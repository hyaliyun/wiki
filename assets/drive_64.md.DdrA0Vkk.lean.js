He is the son of the late Kenneth Monkman, an authority on the writer Laurence Sterne, and of the late Vita née Duncombe Mann. ==Career== Monkman was a pupil at Westminster School where he studied organ and harpsichord, later studying at the Royal Academy of Music, winning the Raymond Russell prize for virtuosity on the harpsichord and becoming a member of the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields. In the late 1960s he founded the rock band Sisyphus, which evolved into the pioneering band Curved Air. He played on their first three albums, leaving after the release of Phantasmagoria (1972) and returning briefly for the tour which resulted in the release of the album Live (1975). He contributed to the Renaissance album Prologue (1972), worked with Al Stewart including contributing to the album Past, Present and Future (1973) as well as Lynsey de Paul on her Surprise album and toured with The Shadows on their 20 Golden Greats Tour (1977). Also in 1977, he collaborated with Phil Manzanera and Brian Eno on the project 801. In 1978, he played all keyboards on Brian Bennett's solo album Voyage. In the late 1970s, he recorded music for television. In 1978, together with guitarist John Williams he founded the classical/rock music fusion band called Sky, with which he stayed until 1980. In 1980, he resumed classical performances and recordings including the soundtrack to the British film, The Long Good Friday. The album Energism included the electronic \\"Achievements of Man\\", from which extracts were used as the theme to the BBC programme Think Again. In 1981 a new album was released, Dweller on the Threshold, with Andy Latimer (guitar). He also composed the piece \\"Current Affairs\\", used by Channel 4 as the introduction to their \\"Engineering Announcements\\" segment, provided by the IBA. ==Instruments (career)== Francis Monkman played guitar as well as keyboards in Curved Air, switching between them when playing live.

Thomas Manton (1620–1677) was an English Puritan clergyman. He was a clerk to the Westminster Assembly and a chaplain to Oliver Cromwell. == Early life == Thomas Manton was baptised 31 March 1620 at Lydeard St Lawrence, Somerset, a remote southwestern portion of England. His grammar school education was possibly at Blundell's School, in Tiverton, Devon.There were two schools in Tiverton at this time: Blundell's and Chilcott's, but the evidence is unclear concerning which one Manton attended. Derek Cooper, The Ecumenical Exegete: Thomas Manton's Commentary on James in Relation to its Protestant Predecessors, Contemporaries, and Successors (Ph.D. thesis, Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia, 2008), 23. His formal education came at Wadham College, University of Oxford, and he eventually graduated BA in 1639 from Hart Hall. Joseph Hall, bishop of Norwich, ordained him deacon the following year: he never took priest's orders, holding that he was properly ordained to the ministerial office. == Ministries at Sowton and Colyton (1640–1645) == He was then appointed town lecturer of Sowton in Devon, where he served from 1640 to 1643, and at Colyton, Devon, from 1643 to 1645. == Ministry at Stoke Newington (1645–1656) == In July 1645 he moved from the rural western counties to the London area, as Colonel Alexander Popham, the patron of St. Mary's parish, brought him east to the tiny town of Stoke Newington, in Middlesex county, outside London proper. Here he began his major mid-week lectures, first on Isaiah 53 (mid-1640s),Based on a comment in Manton's Works, 4:8 then on James (end of the 1640s), and finally on Jude (late 1640s–early 1650s).On the dating, see Cooper, The Ecumenical Exegete, 52–53. While at Stoke Newington he was invited to preach before Parliament for the first of at least six occasions on 30 June 1647, which was a fast day for Parliament. His sermon was based on Zechariah 14:9 and entitled, \\"Meat out of the Eater; or, Hopes of Unity in and by Divided and Distracted Times.\\"Manton, Works, 5:377–409 Exactly one year later, on 30 June 1648, he preached another fast sermon on Revelation 3:20, \\"England's Spiritual Languishing; with the Causes and the Cure.\\"Manton, Works, 5:411–440 He also participated in the Westminster Assembly as one of three clerks, was later appointed to write a preface to the second edition of the Westminster Confession in 1658, and served Oliver Cromwell as a chaplain and a trier (an overseeing body that examined men for the ministry). == Ministry at Covent Garden (1656–1662) == In 1656 he moved to London as he was appointed as a lecturer at Westminster Abbey and most importantly as rector of St. Paul's, Covent Garden, succeeding Obadiah Sedgwick. During this time Cromwell died and England entered a period of great uncertainty. This led Presbyterians such as Manton to call for the restoration of Charles II in 1660, travelling along with others to Breda, The Netherlands, to negotiate his return. After Charles returned, Manton was part of the negotiations called the Savoy Conference, in which the scruples of the Presbyterians and Congregationalists concerning the Prayer Book were formally discussed. Yet since the Cavalier Parliament was filled with Laudians, 1662 saw the enactment of the Act of Uniformity 1662. All ministers were to be ordained or re-ordained by a bishop, they were to renounce the Solemn League and Covenant, promise loyalty to the Prayer Book, and subscribe the Thirty- Nine Articles. Since Manton was on favourable terms with Charles II he was offered the Deanery of Rochester, but he refused on conscience grounds. == Post-Ejection (1662–1677) == Manton's last years were tumultuous. The Act of Uniformity led to the \\"Great Ejection.\\" On 17 August 1662, Manton preached his last sermon at Covent Garden on Hebrews 12:1.Manton, Works, 2:411–421(/ref) The on 24 August 1662, he resigned his living (pastorate) with almost 2,000 other Puritans in protest. Despite his lack of patronage, he continued to preach at home on King Street in Covent Garden. He also continued to write even when imprisoned for refusing to cooperate for six months in 1670 in violation of the Conventicle Act. 1672 saw the Declaration of Indulgence, in which men like Manton were granted a licence to preach at home. Manton then became a lecturer at Pinner's Hall for the so-called \\"morning exercises.\\" Parliament, though, revoked this Indulgence the year after. Manton would later die on 18 October 1677, and was survived by his wife and three children. == Works == Although Manton is little known now, in his day he was held in as much esteem as men like John Owen. He was best known for his skilled expository preaching, and was a favourite of John Charles Ryle, who championed his republication in the mid-19th century, and Charles Spurgeon. Of Manton, Ryle said he was \\"a man who could neither say, nor do, nor write anything without being observed.\\"J. C. Ryle, \\"An Estimate of Manton,\\" in The Works of Thomas Manton, 22 vols. (repr., Homewood, Alabama: Solid Ground, 2008), 2:iv. Spurgeon said his works contained \\"a mighty mountain of sound theology\\" and his sermons were \\"second to none\\" to his contemporaries. He went on to say, \\"Manton is not brilliant, but he is always clever; he is not oratorical, but he is powerful; he is not striking, but he is deep.\\" C. H. Spurgeon, Flowers from a Puritan's Garden (1883, repr., Harrisonburg, Virginia: Sprinkle Publications, 1976), iii.

This was one of the original results that led to the development of Ramsey theory. The happy ending theorem can be proven by a simple case analysis: if four or more points are vertices of the convex hull, any four such points can be chosen. If on the other hand, the point set has the form of a triangle with two points inside it, the two inner points and one of the triangle sides can be chosen. See for an illustrated explanation of this proof, and for a more detailed survey of the problem. The Erdős–Szekeres conjecture states precisely a more general relationship between the number of points in a general-position point set and its largest convex polygon, namely that the smallest number of points for which any general position arrangement contains a convex subset of n points is 2^{n-2}+1 . It remains unproven, but less precise bounds are known. ==Larger polygons== A set of eight points in general position with no convex pentagon proved the following generalisation: :Theorem: for any positive integer N, any sufficiently large finite set of points in the plane in general position has a subset of N points that form the vertices of a convex polygon. The proof appeared in the same paper that proves the Erdős–Szekeres theorem on monotonic subsequences in sequences of numbers. Let f(N) denote the minimum M for which any set of M points in general position must contain a convex N-gon. It is known that * f(3) = 3, trivially. * f(4) = 5.This was the original problem, proved by Esther Klein. * f(5) = 9.According to , this was first proved by E. Makai; the first published proof appeared in . A set of eight points with no convex pentagon is shown in the illustration, demonstrating that f(5) > 8; the more difficult part of the proof is to show that every set of nine points in general position contains the vertices of a convex pentagon. * f(6) = 17.This has been proved by . They carried out a computer search which eliminated all possible configurations of 17 points without convex hexagons while examining only a tiny fraction of all configurations. * The value of f(N) is unknown for all N > 6; by the result of it is known to be finite. On the basis of the known values of f(N) for N = 3, 4 and 5, Erdős and Szekeres conjectured in their original paper that :f(N) = 1 + 2^{N-2} \\\\quad \\\\mbox{for all } N \\\\geq 3. They proved later, by constructing explicit examples, that :f(N) \\\\geq 1 + 2^{N-2}, but the best known upper bound when N ≥ 7 is :f(N)\\\\leq 2^{N + o(N)}.. See binomial coefficient and big O notation for notation used here and Catalan numbers or Stirling's approximation for the asymptotic expansion. ==Empty convex polygons== There is also the question of whether any sufficiently large set of points in general position has an \\"empty\\" convex quadrilateral, pentagon, etc., that is, one that contains no other input point. The original solution to the happy ending problem can be adapted to show that any five points in general position have an empty convex quadrilateral, as shown in the illustration, and any ten points in general position have an empty convex pentagon.. However, there exist arbitrarily large sets of points in general position that contain no empty convex heptagon. For a long time the question of the existence of empty hexagons remained open, but and proved that every sufficiently large point set in general position contains a convex empty hexagon. More specifically, Gerken showed that the number of points needed is no more than f(9) for the same function f defined above, while Nicolás showed that the number of points needed is no more than f(25). supplies a simplification of Gerken's proof that however requires more points, f(15) instead of f(9). At least 30 points are needed: there exists a set of 29 points in general position with no empty convex hexagon.. ==Related problems== The problem of finding sets of n points minimizing the number of convex quadrilaterals is equivalent to minimizing the crossing number in a straight-line drawing of a complete graph. The number of quadrilaterals must be proportional to the fourth power of n, but the precise constant is not known. It is straightforward to show that, in higher- dimensional Euclidean spaces, sufficiently large sets of points will have a subset of k points that forms the vertices of a convex polytope, for any k greater than the dimension: this follows immediately from existence of convex k-gons in sufficiently large planar point sets, by projecting the higher- dimensional point set into an arbitrary two-dimensional subspace. However, the number of points necessary to find k points in convex position may be smaller in higher dimensions than it is in the plane, and it is possible to find subsets that are more highly constrained. In particular, in d dimensions, every d + 3 points in general position have a subset of d + 2 points that form the vertices of a cyclic polytope., Ex. 6.5.6, p.120. Grünbaum attributes this result to a private communication of Micha A. Perles. More generally, for every d and k > d there exists a number m(d,k) such that every set of m(d,k) points in general position has a subset of k points that form the vertices of a neighborly polytope., Ex. 7.3.6, p. 126. This result follows by applying a Ramsey-theoretic argument similar to Szekeres's original proof together with Perles's result on the case k = d + 2. ==Notes== ==References== *. *. *.

The early castle was destroyed in 1028 or 1030 by emperor Conrad II. It was rebuilt and soon became the center of the county of Kyburg which was formed in 1053 as a possession of the counts of Dillingen. In 1079, during the Investiture Controversy, the castle was attacked and partially destroyed by Abbot Ulrich II of St. Gall. By 1096 the counts of Dillingen included count of Kyburg as one of their titles. By 1180, the counts of Kyburg emerged as a cadet line of the Dillingen family. They rose to be the most important noble family in the Swiss plateau beside the Habsburg and the House of Savoy by the 13th century. After the death of the last count in 1264 Rudolph of Habsburg claimed the inheritance for his family. With one interruption the Imperial Regalia of the Holy Roman Empire were kept in the castle between 1273 and 1322. The core of the extant castle originates in the 13th century, with the addition of substantial parts in the course of the 13th and 14th centuries. It is among the largest surviving medieval castle complexes in Switzerland, consisting of a bergfried and palas with additional residential and economic buildings and a chapel, all connected by a ring wall enclosing a large courtyard. In the 1424 the city of Zürich bought the county, and the castle became the seat of the reeve. The dilapidated castle was substantially renovated at this time. The chapel has substantial late Gothic frescoes commissioned by Zürich. Substantial changes to the structure were made under reeve Hans Rudolf Lavater during 1527/8. Further changes were made to the structure in the early modern period. The castle was plundered by the local populace in 1798, but it was again used as administrative seat from 1803 until 1831, when it was sold by auction to one Franz Heinrich Hirzel of Winterthur who intended to use it as a quarry. To prevent its destruction, the castle was bought by the exiled Polish count Alexander Sobansky (1799–1861) in 1835. Sobansky resided in the castle for the next 30 years. In 1865 the castle was opened as a \\"Castle and Art Museum\\" by Matthäus Pfau. Under the next owner, Eduard Bodmer, the museum remained open. In 1917 the Canton of Zurich bought the castle back, since 1999 a society runs it, the Verein Museum Schloss Kyburg. ==Events== Every summer the Kyburgiade, an international chamber music festival, takes place in the inner courtyard of the castle. ==Castle site== Plan of the castle, North is toward left bottom. A - Palas; B - South Wall; C - Knights' Hall; D - West Wall; E - Far Tower; F - Chapel; G - Courtyard; H - Barn and Stable; I - Entrance; K - Well The castle forms an irregular quadrangle with a single courtyard atop a steep hill above the Töss valley. South of the castle, between the medieval neck ditches, is the French formal garden which was designed in 1700 by Caspar Schwarzenbach. The entrance to the castle is through the outer gate located on the north-east corner. The gate house was rebuilt in 1579-80 and decorated with coats of arms by Christoph and Josias Murer. A zwinger or narrow, defensive passage leads from the outer gate to the inner gate. A walkway goes over the zwinger and connects the palas or great hall with the Willenturm (Willen tower) on the north corner of the castle. The inner gate is protected by the bergfried which was built in 1424 with a roof from 1444. ==Views== ==See also== * List of castles in Switzerland ==References== == External links == * *Site of the Verein Category:Museums in the canton of Zürich Category:Castles in the canton of Zürich Category:Cultural property of national significance in the canton of Zürich Category:Historic house museums in Switzerland Category:Illnau-Effretikon ","title":"Kyburg (castle)"},{"id":"2576191","text":"Melville is a noble Scots family name, originally from Fife in eastern Scotland. ==Origins and early history== Most sources state that the family is descended from Galfridus de Melville, a Norman knight who settled in Scotland in the twelfth century. The surname is said to derive from Malleville, a manor in the Pays de Caux. James Melville was one of the leading assassins of Cardinal David Beaton on 29 May 1546. ==House of Monimail== In 1612 Sir Robert Melville of Burntisland, the former Vice-Chancellor and Treasurer Depute of Scotland and an Extraordinary Lord of Session acquired the Palace of Monimail - formerly an official residence of the Archbishops of St Andrews. His younger brother was the famous Sir James Melville of Halhill). Nine years later Melville of Burntisland was created first Lord Melville of Monimail, the title and estate passing after his death in 1621 first to his son, Robert, and then to his great-nephew, John Melville of Raith. The second Lord Melville died in 1643 and was succeeded by his seven-year-old son, George, who built the present Melville House on the estate of Monimail. ==Melville Castle== Melville Castle is a three-storey Gothic castellated mansion situated less than a mile (2 km) west-south-west of Dalkeith, Midlothian, near the North Esk. An earlier tower house on the site was demolished when the present structure, designed in 1786-91 by James Playfair for Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, was built. The original tower house was owned by the Melville family, before passing to Sir John Ross in the 14th century. It subsequently changed hands with the attached lands several times and was sold to David Rennie in 1705. It then passed via the marriage of his daughter to Henry Dundas. ==House of Leslie- Melville== In the United Kingdom the main branch of Melville family is the Leslie-Melville family, Earls of Leven and (since 1690) of Melville as well. The family gained its surname from the 1655 marriage of George Melville, Fourth Lord Melville and First Earl of Melville to Catherine Leslie a descendant of Alexander Leslie, first Earl of Leven. In 1681 their son David Leslie-Melville inherited the title of Earl of Leven. In 1707 he succeeded his father as Earl of Melville. ==See also== * Melville (surname) Category:Scottish families Category:History of Fife ","title":"Melville family"},{"id":"2576198","text":"Wayne Valley High School is a comprehensive four-year public high school, in Wayne, in Passaic County, New Jersey, United States.

The Reliques of Ancient English Poetry (sometimes known as Reliques of Ancient Poetry or simply Percy's Reliques) is a collection of ballads and popular songs collected by Bishop Thomas Percy and published in 1765. ==Sources== The basis of the work was the manuscript which became known as the Percy Folio. Percy found the folio in the house of his friend Humphrey Pitt of Shifnal, a small market town of Shropshire. It was on the floor, and Pitt's maid had been using the leaves to light fires. Once rescued, Percy would use just forty-five of the ballads in the folio for his book, despite claiming the bulk of the collection came from this folio. Other sources were the Pepys Library of broadside ballads collected by Samuel Pepys and Collection of Old Ballads published in 1723, possibly by Ambrose Philips. Bishop Percy was encouraged to publish the work by his friends Samuel Johnson and the poet William Shenstone, who also found and contributed ballads. Percy did not treat the folio nor the texts in it with the scrupulous care expected of a modern editor of manuscripts. He wrote his own notes directly on the folio pages, emended the rhymes and even pulled pages out of the document to give the printer without making copies.W.P. Ker, in The Cambridge History of English Literature, vol. 10, 1913:232ff. He was criticised for these actions even at the time, most notably by Joseph Ritson, a fellow antiquary. The folio he worked from seems to have been written by a single copyist and errors such as pan and wale for wan and pale needed correcting. ==Content== The Reliques contained one hundred and eighty ballads in three volumes with three sections in each. It contains such important ballads as \\"The Ballad of Chevy Chase\\", \\"The Battle of Otterburn\\", \\"Lillibullero\\", \\"The Dragon of Wantley\\", \\"The Nut-Brown Maid\\" and \\"Sir Patrick Spens\\" along with ballads mentioned by or possibly inspiring Shakespeare, several ballads about Robin Hood and one of the Wandering Jew.Reliques of ancient English poetry: consisting of old heroic ballads, songs, and other pieces of our earlier poets, (chiefly of the lyric kind.) Together with some few of later date (Volume 3) - Percy, Thomas, 1729-1811 p.295-301, 128 lines of verse, with prose introduction The claim that the book contained samples of ancient poetry was only partially correct. The last part of each volume was given over to more contemporary works--often less than a hundred years old--included to stress the continuing tradition of the balladeer. The collection draws on the Folio and on other manuscript and printed sources, but in at least three cases anonymous informants, \\"ladies\\" in each case, contributed oral poetry known to them. He made substantial amendments to the Folio text in collaboration with his friend the poet William Shenstone. The work was dedicated to Elizabeth Seymour, Duchess of Northumberland, who was married to Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland. Elizabeth was part of the Percy family and a descendant of Henry Percy, a protagonist of some of the early ballads. Bishop Thomas Percy also claimed to be connected to the family and although this may have been fanciful on his part, it did seem to help him secure his preferment. The dedication to the duchess meant that Thomas Percy arranged the work to give prominence to the border ballads which were composed in and about the Scottish and English borders, specifically Northumberland, home county of the Percies. Percy also omitted some of the racier ballads from the Folio for fear of offending his noble patron: these were first published by F. J. Furnivall in 1868.Bishop Percy's folio manuscript: loose and humorous songs ed. Frederick J. Furnivall. London, 1868. ==Reception== Joseph Wright of Derby - William and Margaret from Percy's 'Reliques of Ancient English Poetry', c. 1785 Ballad collections had appeared before but Percy's Reliques seemed to capture the public imagination like no other. Not only would it inspire poets such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth to compose their own ballads in imitation, it also made the collecting and study of ballads a popular pastime. Sir Walter Scott was another writer inspired by reading the Reliques in his youth, and he published some of the ballads he collected in Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border. The more rigorous scholarship of folklorists would eventually supersede Percy's work, most notably in Francis James Child's Child Ballads, but Percy gave impetus to the whole subject. The book is also credited, in part, with changing the prevailing literary movement of the 18th century, Neo-Classicism, into Romanticism. The classicist Augustans took as their model the epic hexameters of Virgil's Aeneid and the blank verse of John Milton's three epics. The Reliques highlighted the traditions and folklore of England seen as simpler and less artificial. It would inspire folklore collections and movements in other parts of Europe and beyond, such as the Brothers Grimm, and such movements would act as the foundation of romantic nationalism. The Percy Society was founded in 1840 to continue the work of publishing rare ballads, poems and early texts. == Notes == ==External links== *archive.org e-text *PDF scan - The first four pages of the 1765 edition. *Multiple formats at Ex- classics Category:1765 books Category:English poetry Category:Ballad collections Category:Poetry anthologies ","title":"Reliques of Ancient English Poetry"},{"id":"2576202","text":"Inside Wants Out is the debut EP by American singer-songwriter John Mayer.

In 1950 he founded the Glasgow College of Dramatic Art, part of the Royal Conservatoiretoday. Bridie worked with the director Alfred Hitchcock in the late 1940s. They worked together on: * The Paradine Case (1947). Bridie originally wrote the screenplay, and Ben Hecht contributed some additional dialogue. But due to casting, the characters had to be changed. So David O. Selznick had to write another script. * Under Capricorn (1949) * Stage Fright (1950) In 1923, he married Rona Locke Bremner (1897–1985). Their son was killed in World War II.

Denholm is a small village located between Jedburgh and Hawick in the Scottish Borders region of Scotland, UK. The estimated population of Denholm is 600. There is a village green in the centre. It lies in the valley of the River Teviot. Denholm is a Conservation Area listed as 'a planned village as opposed to the traditional unplanned or organic form of village usually found in Roxburghshire.' The village of Denholm is situated in Teviotdale, about halfway between the towns of Hawick and Jedburgh. It lies in gentle rolling countryside between Rubers Law and the Minto Hills, volcanic outcrops which thrust up through the underlying Old Red Sandstone. The original settlement of 'Denum' was sited 'at the valleys' where the broad valley of the River Teviot meets the narrow glen of the Dean Burn. The early hamlet was plundered and burnt during English raids of the 16th century. The village we see today dates from the 17th century when it was laid out around the Green. The population of the village is 653 (in 2011).Census of Scotland 2011, Table KS101SC – Usually Resident Population, publ. by National Records of Scotland. Web site http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/ retrieved Oct 2016. See “Standard Outputs”, Table KS101SC, Area type: Settlement ==History== The village is built around the Green, which in days gone by was let for grazing to the butchers or smallholders. In the middle of the Green stands Leyden's Monument, which was erected in 1861 in honour of Dr John Leyden (1775–1811), poet, antiquarian and orientalist, who was born in Denholm. The monument was designed by the architect Hector H. Orrock, and sculpted by Alexander Handyside Ritchie. The Green has always been at the heart of village life. Weekly and half-weekly fairs used to be held here. Part of the base of an old mercat cross can still be seen inside the railings surrounding the monument. The cross itself was removed and the base hollowed out sometime in the 19th century to make a water trough for cattle. Westgate Hall built in 1663 stands at the western approaches to the village.An inventory of the ancient and historical monuments of Roxburghshire, publ. by Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland, Edinburgh, 1956; p.100, no.132 In Main Street, stands The Text House, a category B listed building, erected about 1910 by John Haddon (1845 - 1924), a medical doctor and author of published works on public sanitation and dietetics. The 3-storey house is in the arts and craft style. One of the texts on the front elevation is a reminder to take care with time before it passes, \\"TAK TENT IN TIME ~ ERE TIME BE TINT\\", the other text reminds the occupier that there were and will be others living in the house, \\"ALL WAS OTHERS ~ ALL WILL BE OTHERS\\".Dr John Haddon & The Text House Council pre-fabs were put up in the Ashloaning at the end of the war followed by the \\"Crudens semis\\" and the \\"Orlits\\". During the 1950s, six more semi-detached houses were built in The Loaning and ten in Murray Place. All through the 1950s the public water supply was inadequate for the post-war village, but in 1963 a proper supply was finally piped in from Alemoor Loch above Roberton. The way was now open for more housing development. Like most villages, Denholm is expanding, and many new houses have been built in the past few years. Denholm Mill and Denholm Hall Farm have both been developed for housing, but the centre of the village around the Green is a conservation area. Denholm was the only village in the civil parish of Cavers and is situated in the north- east corner of the parish.New Statistical Account of Scotland, Vol III Roxburgh, Peebles, Selkirk, publ.William Blackwood, 1845 pp. 425-439 ==See also== *List of places in the Scottish Borders *List of places in Scotland ==Famous sons of Denholm== *Prof.Dr. William Lowrie Professor of Geophysics at the ETH Zurich (1974/2004).

It is housed in the art deco-style former Maritime Services Board Building on the western edge of Circular Quay. The museum was opened in 1991 as the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney, and from 2010 underwent an 58 million expansion and re-development, reopening on 29 March 2012 under its current name as the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia. The collection contains over 4,000 works by Australian artists that have been acquired since 1989. The collection spans all art forms with strong holdings in painting, photography, sculpture, works on paper and moving image, as well as significant representation of works by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists. ==History== Museum of Contemporary Art within the former MSB building. The establishment of the MCA was mandated in the will of Australian expatriate artist JW Power (1881–1943), who bequeathed his personal fortune to the University of Sydney with the express purpose of informing and educating Australians in the contemporary visual arts. In December 1970 the University of Sydney also received the Seymour Bequest for the purposes of a performing arts centre, and sought to combine the two bequests into an arts complex that would include within it the Seymour Centre and the Power Institute facilities, including a home for the Power Gallery. The Seymour centre was opened in 1975 without designs for the Power Institute of Fine Arts being integrated into the final building. This collection of artworks thus took the form of the ‘Power Gallery of Contemporary Art’, a travelling collection of artworks without a permanent address. Between John Power’s death and the eventual establishment of the museum as we know it today, the collection was mainly housed in the University of Sydney. They were stored in the University’s Fisher Library during the 1970s. The collection functioned as an exhibition within the Madsen Building on campus between 1980 and 1989. With the relocation of the Maritime Services Board (MSB) from the 1949 built five-storey building to larger premises in 1989, the building and site was donated by the Government of New South Wales to the Museum of Contemporary Art. Funded by the University of Sydney and the Power Bequest, restoration and refurbishment of the building commenced in 1990 under the direction of Andrew Anderson of Peddle Thorp/John Holland Interiors and in November 1991 the Museum of Contemporary Art officially opened. Extensions made in 2010–2012 were to a design by Sydney architect Sam Marshall. The new extension, called the Mordant Wing, opened in March 2012. The wing was named after the chairperson of the museum’s board, Simon Mordant (2010-2020). In July 2020, Lorraine Tarabay took over the role of chairperson. The MCA is a not-for-profit, charitable organisation which receives ongoing funding and support from the NSW State Government through Arts NSW and the Commonwealth Government through the Australia Council. Every year, the MCA raises approximately 70% of its income from a variety of sources such as exhibitions and events, sponsorship, donations and venue hire. == Architecture == The museum comprises two wings, the main section housed in the former Maritime Services Board (MSB) building, and the newer Mordant Wing on the museum's Northern end opened in 2012. The museum’s George St entrance in The Rocks The architecture of the Museum of Contemporary Art has drawn both criticism and praise from both Australian and international commentators, mainly directed towards the buildings' contrasting facades. The former MSB building is six floors of brick and concrete with an Art Deco exterior. The building’s former offices were renovated into a more open space with movable walls to accommodate exhibition requirements, with some rooms left intact as archival spaces. The building itself is heritage listed both within NSW and federally. The design of the Mordant Wing is by Sydney-based architect Sam Marshall who began planning the extension in 2001, after designs by Japanese and German architectural firms were ultimately rejected in 1997 and 2001 respectively. The Mordant Wing is a more contemporary design inspired by cubism, its facade consisting of overlapping black and white boxes with large angular windows. The Mordant wing includes a range of facilities including a library, classrooms, and a rooftop sculpture terrace with views of the harbour. The extension also created dedicated spaces within the building to exhibit video art. == Collections == What is now the museum’s main collection emerged from the Power Collection in the original founding of the museum. The museum’s initial acquisitions policy, based on the will of John Power, sought to acquire mainly international contemporary art whilst only “very occasionally” purchasing Australian art as complementary to its foreign collection. From 2002, the museum has shifted to increase its emphasis on Australian artists and currently holds over 4500 works.

It exhibits the work of Australian artists aged 35 or younger and runs for several months over the summer. == Programs == The Museum of Contemporary Art holds a number of public programs over its calendar year, including an Indigenous learning program and an 'Art + Dementia' research program. === The Bella Program === The MCA’s Bella Program is a creative program for individuals with disabilities and their families, and has a dedicated space in the Mordant wing in the museum’s Jackson Bella Room. === Genext === 'GENEXT' has been held since 2005 as an public engagement program aimed at young people aged from 12 to 18, run by MCA’s Youth Committee. GENEXT is an after-hours program that includes activities such as live music, discussions, and art workshops. It is held four times annually, and included over 16,000 participants over the course of its first ten years of operation. In collaboration with the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Museum of Contemporary Art takes part in the Sydney Festival and the Biennale of Sydney, with the scheduled 2020 iteration of the latter taking place partially online due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. ==See also== *Sydney Cove West Archaeological Precinct ==References== ==External links== *Museum of Contemporary Art official website *Museum of Contemporary Art Artabase page *Architect Marshall official website * [CC-By-SA] * [CC-By-SA].

This releases additional electrons which accelerate and collide with further atoms, releasing more electrons--a chain reaction. In a gas, this causes the affected region to become an electrically conductive plasma. The avalanche effect was discovered by John Sealy Townsend in his work between 1897 and 1901, and is also known as the Townsend discharge. Electron avalanches are essential to the dielectric breakdown process within gases. The process can culminate in corona discharges, streamers, leaders, or in a spark or continuous arc that completely bridges the gap between the electrical conductors that are applying the voltage. The process extends to huge sparks — streamers in lightning discharges propagate by formation of electron avalanches created in the high potential gradient ahead of the streamers' advancing tips. Once begun, avalanches are often intensified by the creation of photoelectrons as a result of ultraviolet radiation emitted by the excited medium's atoms in the aft-tip region. The process can also be used to detect ionizing radiation by using the gas multiplication effect of the avalanche process. This is the ionisation mechanism of the Geiger–Müller tube and, to a limited extent, of the proportional counter Glenn F Knoll, 'Radiation Detection and Measurement' 3rd edition, 2000, John Wiley and sons Inc. and is also used in spark chambers and other wire chambers. ==Analysis== A plasma begins with a rare natural 'background' ionization event of a neutral air molecule, perhaps as the result of photoexcitation or background radiation. If this event occurs within an area that has a high potential gradient, the positively charged ion will be strongly attracted toward, or repelled away from, an electrode depending on its polarity, whereas the electron will be accelerated in the opposite direction. Because of the huge mass difference, electrons are accelerated to a much higher velocity than ions. High-velocity electrons often collide with neutral atoms inelastically, sometimes ionizing them. In a chain-reaction — or an 'electron avalanche' — additional electrons recently separated from their positive ions by the strong potential gradient, cause a large cloud of electrons and positive ions to be momentarily generated by just a single initial electron. However, free electrons are easily captured by neutral oxygen or water vapor molecules (so-called electronegative gases), forming negative ions. In air at STP, free electrons exist for only about 11 nanoseconds before being captured. Captured electrons are effectively removed from play — they can no longer contribute to the avalanche process. If electrons are being created at a rate greater than they are being lost to capture, their number rapidly multiplies, a process characterized by exponential growth. The degree of multiplication that this process can provide is huge, up to several million-fold depending on the situation. The multiplication factor M is given by M = \\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\int_{X_1}^{X_2} \\\\alpha\\\\, dx} Where X1 and X2 are the positions that the multiplication is being measured between, and α is the ionization constant. In other words, one free electron at position X1 will result in M free electrons at position X2. Substituting the voltage gradients into this equation results in M = \\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\frac{V}{V_\\\\mathrm{BR}}^n} Where V is the applied voltage, VBR is the breakdown voltage and n is an empirically derived value between 2 and 6. As can be seen from this formula, the multiplication factor is very highly dependent on the applied voltage, and as the voltage nears the breakdown voltage of the material, the multiplication factor approaches infinity and the limiting factor becomes the availability of charge carriers. Avalanche sustenance requires a reservoir of charge to sustain the applied voltage, as well as a continual source of triggering events. A number of mechanisms can sustain this process, creating avalanche after avalanche, to create a corona current. A secondary source of plasma electrons is required as the electrons are always accelerated by the field in one direction, meaning that avalanches always proceed linearly toward or away from an electrode. The dominant mechanism for the creation of secondary electrons depends on the polarity of a plasma. In each case, the energy emitted as photons by the initial avalanche is used to ionise a nearby gas molecule creating another accelerable electron. What differs is the source of this electron. When one or more electron avalanches occur between two electrodes of sufficient size, complete avalanche breakdown can occur, culminating in an electrical spark that bridges the gap. == See also == * Townsend discharge * Avalanche breakdown * Avalanche diode * Corona discharge * Multipactor * Geiger–Müller tube * Geiger counter * Spark chamber * Wire chamber * Runaway breakdown * List of plasma (physics) articles == References == * Breakdown effects in semiconductors Category:Electrical breakdown ","title":"Electron avalanche"},{"id":"2576276","text":"Maspalomas (, ) is a tourist town in the south of the island of Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, stretching from Bahía Feliz in the east to Meloneras in the west, including the resort towns of San Agustín and Playa del Inglés. Maspalomas constitutes the southernmost part of the municipality of San Bartolomé de Tirajana, and of the island. ==Overview== Before the era of tourism, Maspalomas was the name of a hamlet in what today is San Fernando de Maspalomas. Its name may derive from that of Rodrigo Mas de Palomar, a settler and soldier from Majorca, or from Francisco Palomar, a Genoese friend of Alonso Fernandez de Lugo who purchased 87 Guanche slaves from Güímar and settled in the area. Present-day Maspalomas is the result of an ambitious development project, organized in the form of an International Ideas Contest (opened to any member of the International Union of Architects), held in 1961 under the auspice of Alejandro del Castillo, owner and promoter of most of the space under construction. The contest was won by the French office SETAP (including the urbanist Guy Lagneau and the economist Michel Weill) and covered the and of coast that constitute the core area of Maspalomas - Costa Canaria. The contest paved the way for a particular way of understanding \\"touristic\\" urbanism that served as a model for later tourist development in other Canary Islands. ==Tourism== Typical tourist apartments in Maspalomas: The Oasis Maspalomas Foresta Unlike the resort-like development model later extended to other locations in the Canary Islands and the Caribbean, Maspalomas has a personality of its own, as it evolved into a fully equipped town much closer to the \\"tourist\\" concept of destinations like Palm Springs, California or Palm Beach, Florida. It has a variety of infrastructure and public institutions rarely seen in other tourist areas, including private clinics and two hospitals, local and foreign schooling institutions (Spanish, English and Swedish schools), shopping and convention centres, two casinos, English-language cinema, golf courses, sports centres, theme parks and a Summer University (in collaboration with the university of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, mainly focused on tourism-related activities). It has a wide range of accommodation on offer, although the urbanism concept speaks of an horizontal expansion (bungalows) rather than high rises. Much appreciated as a winter destination for foreign tourists, mostly from north-European countries (Sweden, Norway, Germany, Netherlands, etc.), it remains the largest tourist destination in the Canary Islands and a worldwide-known destination for LGBT tourism. The Costa Meloneras Hotel features a replica of a church The development of luxury hotels along the coast between Maspalomas and neighbouring Meloneras has resulted in some notable architectural developments. The Lopesan Villa del Conde and the Lopesan Costa Meloneras Hotels have both been designed in a Canarian Spanish Colonial Revival style, partly derived from de la Torre's Hotel Santa Catalina (1890) in Las Palmas. For the Costa Meloneras Hotel, opened in 2005, the architect created a replica of the nearby town of Agüimes (the home town of , founder of the Lopesan Hotel Group), including a distinctive replica of the large, domed , which serves as the hotel reception. Maspalomas serves as the base for Gran Canaria's only English language newspaper,The Canary News, Views & Sunshine which serves a print readership in excess of 20,000 every month and reaches up to another 30,000 readers on-line. In September 2012, the World Tourism Organization organized its World Tourism Day in Maspalomas, as a form of commemoration of its 50 years of existence. ==Landmarks and geography== The seafront at Punta de Maspalomas, the southernmost point of the resort, is dominated by a lighthouse, El Faro de Maspalomas. Completed in 1890, it was built to guide ships travelling between Europe and the Americas. The lighthouse overlooks the popular -long Maspalomas beach. To the east of the lighthouse, the Maspalomas Dunes stretch inland all the way to Playa del Inglés. During the 1960s and 70s, the construction of hotels and the tourist resort began to encroach on the dunes, damaging the natural habitat, and in 1994 a area of dunes was declared a nature reserve to protect native wildlife. El Charco is a natural lagoon at the edge of the dunes which attracts many species of birds, eels and guppies. In the north of Maspalomas San Fernando and El Tablero were built for people working in the tourist industry. In between Sonnenland was constructed, on a crest, to accommodate expats. An array of large satellite dishes visible on a hill from Meloneras is Maspalomas Station, an ESA ground station that supported several NASA space missions, including the Mercury Program, the Gemini Program, the Apollo 11 Moon landings, and Skylab. ==Transport== Maspalomas is served by the Faro de Maspalomas bus station run by the , which is located near the lighthouse at the end of Avenida Cristobal Colon. Bus services operated by provide connections to other tourist resorts and towns in the south of the island, including Playa del Inglés, Mogán, as well as to towns along the east coast and to the island capital, Las Palmas. Plans have existed for several years to construct a rail link, called Tren de Gran Canaria, connecting Maspalomas to Gran Canaria Airport and Las Palmas. A terminus station is planned at Meloneras underneath Av. Cristóbal Colón, near the lighthouse. The scheme, estimated to cost €1,500 million, has not been confirmed due to funding problems. ==Photo gallery== File:VogelschutzgebietLaCharca.jpgBird sanctuary La Charca File:Dunas de Maspalomas.jpgMaspalomas Dunes File:Playa del ingles gran canaria.jpgThe beach of Playa del Inglés File:Hotels in San Agustin.jpgHotels in San Agustín File:GC Faro de Maspalomas R01.jpgMaspalomas Lighthouse File:Lopesan Baobab, Maspalomas, May 2018.jpgLopesan Baobab Resort File:Maspalomas EM1B9180 (25894243208).jpgSand dunes at Maspalomas File:Maspalomas EM1B9192 (27987770619).jpgSand dunes at Maspalomas ==References== ==External links== * El nombre de Maspalomas (etymological study) *Town Hall *Maspalomas Gran Canaria *Panoramic Virtual Tours of Maspalomas Category:Populated places in Gran Canaria Category:Tourism in Spain ","title":"Maspalomas"},{"id":"2576279","text":"Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport The Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport () is a regional university operated by the Arab League which runs programs in marine transportation, business, and engineering. ==The Arab Academy for Science and Technology== AASTMT's name has become the Arab Academy for Science and Technology: \\"A university specialized in maritime transport\\" and its certificates have been made equivalent to those granted by Egyptian universities. ==The Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport (AASTMT)== Over five years (from 1991 to 1996), the educational and maritime training services were funded by the Egyptian Ministry of Transport. Consequently, in 1992, the AASTMT was granted the most modern training ship, \\"Aida 4\\", as a donation from the Japanese government. In 1994 the AASTMT was awarded the most modern simulator in the world (completed in two phases) from the USA administration. Cooperation with the American counterpart continued to found an advanced technology center. Scholarships have exceeded 120,000 for students from 58 countries. The World Bank has chosen the AASTMT from four international organizations representing the Norwegian Swedish Group, the Hungarian Group and the Danish Group to develop maritime education in Bangladesh by a limited tender. The AASTMT proposal was chosen as the best both technically and financially to carry out the project. In October 1996 modified its title from: \\"The Arab Academy for Science and Technology: A university specialized in maritime transport.\\" to \\"The Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport\\" (AASTMT). ==Certificates== The AASTMT has obtained the approval of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Universities for considering the holders of the High Seas Second Officer eligible for the affiliation with any Egyptian University or any 4-year higher education entity which a student can join after high school. The AASTMT has flexibility in the process of transferring marine officers from vocational studies to that which allows them to obtain the bachelor's degree in Marine Navigation Technology. This is due to the application of the American Credit Hours System. In order to show the importance of this achievement, the holder of the High Seas Captain certificate, when sent to the United Kingdom to obtain the bachelor's degree, had to start his studies over regardless of his previous studies. However, due to the flexibility of the current system the AASTMT applies, it opened the door for its officers to obtain the bachelor's degree as well as the eligibility certificate in four years. A report which was prepared by the Japan Transport Cooperation Association in March 1997 tells of the AASTMT progress and the flexibility with which it switched to science and technology then to science, technology and maritime transport. AASTMT has made its certificates equivalent to those granted by Egyptian universities in the fields of engineering and management. ==Services and student activities== Services include dormitories, hostels and restaurants. The girls hostel can accommodate up to 100 girls. Seminars and lectures are organized by the Cultural Activities Department in addition to trips and athletic activities. Students organize the annual Parents Day. ==Community service programmes and continuous education== AASTMT offers educational programmes to serve the community of Alexandria. The programmes enhance the skills of students in language, computing, secretarial work, aviation tickets reservation, marketing and management. The programmes start- over every three months, and run all year round. They are carried out at the AASTMT headquarters in Miami, Sidi Bishr and downtown. The programmes are offered according to an evening schedule. The courses are sometimes designed for groups of employees in a company or organizations. The estimated number of those benefiting from these programmes throughout the year, ranges from 15,000 to 20,000 Alexandrians. There are summer courses for the education of children which benefit around 5,000 children. ==Colleges== *Maritime Transport & Technology *Archaeology and Cultural Heritage *Engineering & Technology *Management & Technology *Computing & Information Technology *Graduate School of Business *International Transport & Logistics *Language & Communication *Fisheries Technology & Aquaculture * College of Pharmacy * College of Law * College of Dental Medicine * College of Artificial Intelligence These colleges can be in Arabic, English or French languages. == Institutes == * Maritime Safety Institute Alexandria. * Productivity & Quality Institut Alexandria. * Technical & Vocational Institute Alexandria. * Institute of International Transport & Logistics Alexandria & Cairo. * Port training Institute Alexandria & Port Said. * Institute for Language Studies Alexandria & Cairo. * Investment & Finance Institute Alexandria. * Arab Institute for Trade & Commodities Exchange Alexandria. * Maritime of Upgrading Studies Alexandria. == Centers == * Academy Publishing Center * Strategic Marketing & Entrepreneurship Center * Industry Service Center Alexandria. * Marine Hotel Center Alexandria. * Information and Documentation Center Alexandria. * Multimedia Center Alexandria. * Regional informatics Center Alexandria. * Computer Services Center Alexandria. * Computer Networks & Data Center Alexandria. * Research & Consultation Center Alexandria & Portsaid. * Business Development Center Alexandria. * Regional Center for Disaster Risk reduction Alexandria. * Arab Center for Transport Study Alexandria. * Arab Center for Media Alexandria. * Maritime Certificates Renewal * International Maritime Transport Forum ==Deaneries== * International Education Programs Deanery Alexandria. * Community Service and Continuing Education Alexandria. * Deanery of Postgraduate Studies Alexandria. * Deanery of Student Affairs Alexandria. * Deanery of Sports Alexandria. ==Complexes== * Integrated Simulators Complex Alexandria & Portsaid. * International Maritime Organization Compound Alexandria. ==Campuses== *Alexandria (Main HeadQuarter). *Cairo. *PortaSaid. * Aswan * Smart Village * Alamein Abroad: *Lattakia, Syria. *Khor Fakkan, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates Branches under construction: *Yemen *Sudan. ==See also== * Colleges and Universities in Alexandria * Education in Egypt * List of universities in Egypt ==References== * AASTMT website * AAST official Facebook page == External links == * AASTMT website * AAST Official Facebook page * Ports Training Institute * League of Arab States * Graduate School of Business * Computing and Information Technology * Human Rights Watch: The Repression of Academic Freedom in Egyptian Universities. * Multimedia Center * Madrastyonline site * https://web.archive.org/web/20091219123347/http://www.mena.eng.vt.edu/ * Egypt: Arab Science and Technology and Maritime College Profile Category:Universities in Syria Category:Education in Alexandria Category:Buildings and structures in Latakia Category:Education in Latakia Category:Educational institutions established in 1972 Category:1972 establishments in Egypt Category:Universities in Egypt ","title":"Arab Academy for Science, Technology &amp; Maritime Transport"},{"id":"2576283","text":"Jacob (Jacobus; sometimes James) Metius (after 1571-1628) was a Dutch instrument-maker and a specialist in grinding lenses.

Hessey had a fairly successful five-year spell at Scottish club Kilmarnock. However, this was marred by a number of serious knee injuries He scored his first professional goal at Kilmarnock in a 2–1 win over Livingston in September 2003. Hessey joined Chester after the club were promoted back to the Football League in 2004 and was a first-choice player for much of his first three years at the club, although he quite often missed games because of injury and suspension problems. The most notable was a five-match ban at the start of the 2006–07 season after an incident in the home game against Stockport County the previous season. Hessey has proved to be a versatile player, operating in both central defensive and full back roles and also in a holding midfield spot. He scored twice at Chester; once in a Football League Trophy tie against Rochdale and once in a league match against Rushden & Diamonds. Chester manager Bobby Williamson, who managed Hessey at Kilmarnock, placed him on the transfer list in the summer of 2007. He did not figure in the Chester 16-man matchday squad in any game for the 2007–08 season and was allowed to join League Two rivals Macclesfield Town on 10 November 2007 in a two-month loan. In January 2008, this was extended until the end of the season. Hessey followed up his successful loan period by signing a two-year contract with Macclesfield who he went on to captain. He Left the club, along with 10 other players at the end of the 2009–10 season. He joined Accrington Stanley in August 2010 on a twelve-month contract and signed a 1-year extension at the end of that season. On 14 May 2012 it was announced Hessey had left Stanley after failing to agree a new contract. He spent the 2012–13 season with Barrow AFC in the Conference National, but left at the end of the season after the club were relegated. He moved to Prestatyn Town of the Welsh Premier Division for the start of the 2013–14 season. Shortly after he joined Marine on loan (initially until January) and made his debut on 30 August 2014 in a 2–1 defeat at home to Buxton. This loan deal was extended, and Hessey subsequently became caretaker manager following the departure of Carl Macauley. An excellent run of form saw Hessey secure the managerial post with 2 games left in the season. The change in form under Sean's leadership saw Marine maintain their place in the Northern Premier League Premier Division for the 2015–16 season ==References== ==External links== * Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:People from Whiston, Merseyside Category:Association football defenders Category:English footballers Category:Leeds United F.C. players Category:Wigan Athletic F.C. players Category:Kilmarnock F.C. players Category:Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players Category:Blackpool F.C. players Category:Chester City F.C. players Category:Macclesfield Town F.C. players Category:Accrington Stanley F.C. players Category:Barrow A.F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Scottish Premier League players Category:Prestatyn Town F.C. players Category:Cymru Premier players Category:Marine F.C. players ","title":"Sean Hessey"},{"id":"2576299","text":"Javadi Hills as seen from Parvathamalai The Javadhu Hills (also Jawadhi, Jawadhu Hills) ( Rainfall clouds producing Hills For North Tamilnadu) ( Ooty of Tirupattur ) are an extension of the Eastern Ghats spread across parts of Vellore and Tiruvannamalai districts in the northern part of the state of Tamil Nadu in southeastern India.

The mall is owned by Ayala Land and operated through its subsidiary, the Ayala Malls. The mall is divided into five sections (named Glorietta 1–5) and contains many shops and restaurants, as well as cinemas, a gym, arcades and a large central activity center, often used to stage events. Glorietta 1-4 is integrated with the nearby Greenbelt, SM Makati, Rustan's Makati and The Landmark. Glorietta 5 is fully detached, located in front of the lot formerly occupied by an open parking area between Hotel InterContinental Manila and Rustan's Department Store. The tenants affected by the October 19, 2007 explosion were given an option to relocate there. ==History== A shot of the central atrium area during an electronics event Glorietta was originally a park surrounded by establishments. The park, with its outdoor stage for event hosting, was built in the 1970s as part of the wider Makati Commercial Center complex, which included several independent small arcades and the Quad cinemas plus retail outlets - some having been opened since the mid-1960s. In the early 1990s, Ayala Corporation decided to redevelop Makati Commercial Center into a new development named the Ayala Center in 1991. The plan called for the redevelopment of Glorietta and the surrounding buildings into a single shopping mall. The new Glorietta mall opened in 1992 with a gross leasable area of 250,000 m2, envisioned as one of the largest malls in the Philippines. The mall was divided into four sections: Quad 1 - which retained the original four Quad cinemas and would operate until 2010; Quad 2 - which had a theme park named Glico's Great Adventure and was soon to become the main setting for a deadly explosion in 2007; Quad 3 - which would soon be the home of international restaurants like Hard Rock Cafe and TGI Fridays; and Glorietta 4, a new hub for entertainment with a Timezone branch and seven additional cinemas, and was also home to Oakwood Premier (now Ascott Makati), a premier hotel that stood on top of the mall and became the setting for the Oakwood mutiny, a political siege led by the Magdalo Group which occurred in 2003. All four components were home to a variety of shops and restaurants. While Quad 1, 2, and 3 all opened in 1992, Glorietta 4 opened in 1998, just six years later, as a result of the construction of Oakwood Premier. With the opening of Glorietta 4, Quads 1, 2 and 3 would be renamed Glorietta 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Tenants that set up shop in Ayala Center prior to Glorietta's development, most notably Mercury Drug, Automatic Center, Jollibee, Max's, and McDonald's also found a new home in Glorietta. The department stores surrounding the mall, SM Makati, The Landmark, and Rustans, were utilized by Glorietta as its anchor tenants for its supermarkets and department stores. By the mid- and late 1990s, Glorietta gained popularity as a premier mall. It has an air-conditioned atrium with water features, an indoor children's playground, and an activity center that hosts concerts and shows. The mall was known as Quad until 1997, when it adopted Glorietta as its present name, though the Glorietta name was used as a secondary branding since 1992. Glorietta is the Spanish word used to describe the public meeting place in Spanish colonial-era designed towns throughout the Philippines. Other new buildings were also constructed between 1999 and 2005, making Glorietta bigger than its original construction plan. Glorietta Building complex in 2008 Glorietta 5 and the under-construction One Ayala Avenue on the background The rebuilt Glorietta 1 & 2 In 2010, Glorietta 1 and 2 were demolished for redevelopment with a new mall, hotel (Holiday Inn and Fairmont Suites) BPO offices and condos (Park Terraces and Garden Terraces). Glorietta 1 was opened on November 5, 2012 with a new activity center, as Glorietta 2 opened in December 7 of the same year. Glorietta 3 is planned to be demolished to finalize a redeveloped Glorietta mall complex, hailed as the crown jewel of Ayala, but was pushed back to a later date for undisclosed reasons. A new roofdeck on top of Glorietta 1 and 2 was built, dubbed as Top of The Glo, after a naming competition held in their Facebook page. Under Mitsubishi's partnership, a Japan-inspired retail area will open at the roofdeck with HalloHallo as its anchor. The roofdeck retail area will have a GLA of 2,500 square meters. An events area will be built for MNL48, the Philippines' version of Japanese idol group AKB48. The roofdeck is connected to the 4th level of Holiday Inn and Suites Makati and via a walkway to Glorietta 4 Cinemas at the same level. The Glorietta 2 section of the roofdeck, which is dubbed \\"Japan Town,\\" opened in June 2019. Almost all of the tenants in Glorietta 5 were closed with Bo's Coffee, Baskin Robbins, Anytime Fitness, and some other tenants left at the mall. The entire ground and second levels of Glorietta 5 were replaced by a flagship Uniqlo store, bigger than its existing store at that wing. The Uniqlo flagship store opened in October 2018. In August 2019, a remodeled Food Choices area in Glorietta 4 was opened. The section opened with more food shops, and the area was extended into the location formerly occupied by Automatic Centre and BLIMS Fine Furniture. Consequently, both these stores were moved to the former location of National Bookstore's third floor location in Glorietta 1 as part of the remodeling project. BLIMS re-opened at its new location in April, while Automatic Centre opened their relocated store in June. A future walkway will connect to the new Ayala Mall built in the One Ayala complex, located in the former Hotel InterContinental Manila site. The main atrium at the center of the mall was closed for a major renovation in early 2019 and reopened on November in the same year. ==Incidents== ===2000 Glorietta 2 Explosion=== On May 17, 2000, thirteen people were injured in an explosion at Glorietta 2. Police said the blast originated from a restroom of a restaurant and affected Timezone, a nearby game arcade center, as well as the ceiling of the bridge connecting Glorietta 2 to the then Park Square 2. Two rival gangs were seen fighting near the restaurant shortly before the blast occurred. ===Oakwood mutiny=== On July 27, 2003, Magdalo soldiers led by Lt. Sr. Grade Antonio Trillanes IV took control of the Oakwood apartments in Makati. Glorietta, where the Oakwood Premier stood, was also closed during the siege. ===2005 Valentine's Day bombings=== On February 14, 2005, a passenger bus was bombed in Makati, near Glorietta. Four people were killed and 36 injured. On the same day, a mall in General Santos City was also bombed. Abu Sayyaf claimed responsibility, with spokesperson Abu Solaiman saying on a radio interview: \\"This is our Valentine gift to Gloria\\". ===2007 Glorietta 2 Explosion=== On October 19, 2007, an explosion in Glorietta 2 killed eleven people and injured a hundred others. Initially, authorities termed it a liquefied petroleum gas explosion in a restaurant, but later began investigating the possibility that the explosion may have been a C-4 bomb. The explosion destroyed much of Glorietta 2's main lobby and vehicles parked outside. Several days later, October 23, 2007, senior government officials expressed \\"a high level of certainty\\" that the explosion was an accident, but the bomb theory has not been totally ruled out. This was brought on by the inability of experts to find bomb components after four days of rigorous investigation. It is believed that the explosion was caused by underground structures in the mall that might have triggered the blast, pending further investigation. ===Fire incidents=== ;Glorietta 4 (2007) Two days after the explosion, October 21, a fire broke out at noon in the kitchen of one of the restaurants in Glorietta 4. It was put out by firemen an hour later. The authorities announced that this incident was in no way associated with the earlier Glorietta blast. Glorietta 4 was closed, right after this disaster, while the authorities indicated that it was business as usual in the open areas not affected by the fire. ;Glorietta 3 (2016) On November 20, 2016 at around 8 in the evening, fire struck a restaurant in Glorietta 3 which was raised at Fire Alarm Number 1. People within the entire Glorietta Mall were evacuated which caused a minor stampede due to the fear of a repeat of the 2007 Blast. After more than an hour the fire was declared to be under control by the authorities with no injuries and casualties. The mall was closed for the rest of the evening to give way for investigations such as arson as well as to allow for the management to assess the damages. ==Awards== • Shopping Center of the Year (Philippine Retailer's Association and Department of Trade & Industry, 2002 & 2004) ==See also== *Ayala Center *List of largest shopping malls *List of largest shopping malls in the Philippines *List of shopping malls in Metro Manila ==References== ==External links== *Glorietta Official Website Category:Shopping malls in Makati Category:Buildings and structures in Makati Category:Makati Central Business District Category:Ayala Malls Category:Shopping malls established in 1991 ","title":"Glorietta"},{"id":"2576310","text":" ","title":"Hitchment"},{"id":"2576314","text":"Bertie Hill riding Stella at the 1952 Olympics Albert \\"Bertie\\" Edwin Hill (7 February 1927 - 5 August 2005) was a British equestrian who competed at three Olympic Games.

She was the wife of the Lübeck senator and grain merchant Johann Heinrich Mann, and also mother of writers Thomas Mann and Heinrich Mann. == Biography == Júlia, a Roman Catholic, was born in Paraty, Brazil,Note: there is some disagreement about her exact birthplace, as some sources (including the German Wikipedia) assert she was born in the nearby town of Paraty, which by 1851 was part of the Angra dos Reis municipality. the daughter of the German farmer Johann Ludwig Herman Bruhns and of Brazilian Maria Luísa da Silva, the daughter of a Portuguese immigrant and a lady who also had South American Indian blood. Júlia's father owned several sugar cane plantations between Santos and Rio de Janeiro. Her mother died in childbirth at 28 when Júlia was six. She had three brothers and one sister. One year after her mother's death, her father decided to send his children back to Germany. They lived in Lübeck, where Júlia had an uncle. At six, Julia didn’t speak a word of German. She stayed in a boarding school until she was 14 years old, while her father was back in Brazil caring for the farms. After the death of her husband and as consequence of a bladder surgery, Júlia went to live in Munich with her children. She wrote an autobiographical work called Aus Dodos Kindheit, in which she described her idyllic childhood in Brazil. Her sons Heinrich and Thomas created characters inspired by her in several of their books, referring to her South American blood and passionate artistic temperament. In his autobiography, Thomas Mann describes Júlia as \\"Portuguese- Creole Brazilian\\". In Buddenbrooks she was the inspiration for Gerda Arnoldsen and Toni Buddenbrook. In Doktor Faustus, she became the wife of Senator Rodde. In Tonio Kröger, she was the mother, Consuelo. In Death in Venice, she appears as the mother of the protagonist, Gustav von Aschenbach. ==Personal life== She married Thomas Johann Heinrich Mann in 1869. She was 17, he 29. They had five children: Heinrich (Luís), Thomas (Paulo), Julia (Elisabeth Therese/Lula), Carla (Augusta Olga Maria), and Viktor (Carl). Her two daughters both committed suicide: Carla poisoned herself in 1910, and Lula hanged herself in 1927. ==Death== In her later years Júlia moved frequently and lived mostly in hotels.

He played as a goalkeeper, who won two England under-21 caps. Born in Swindon, Wiltshire, he began his career with Chelsea, where he stayed five years without playing a game, but had loan spells at three other clubs. In 2003, he moved to his hometown club Swindon Town, where he ended up playing more than 100 games in three seasons. In his final season at Swindon, he won all the club's player of the season awards, but following their relegation to Football League Two, he turned down a new contract offer and instead signed for Blackpool. However, he fell out of favour after less than a year with Blackpool, and initially moved to Bradford City on loan, before he returned to London, with Millwall on a short-term contract. After his contract was not extended, he returned to Bradford City. Despite keeping 17 clean sheets, he left at the end of his first season and moved on to Bristol Rovers and Southend United. ==Club career== ===Chelsea=== Evans started his career in 1998 at Chelsea, with whom he stayed until he was released 2003, having never played a single game. During his time at the club he was sent out on loan to Bristol Rovers in February 2000, with whom he played four games; Queens Park Rangers from November 2001 to April 2002, making eleven appearances; and Leyton Orient from August to November 2002, playing seven games. He also had a spell on trial with Bournemouth before the start of the 2002–03 season, where he impressed, but instead opted to join Leyton Orient. ===Swindon Town=== In August 2003, Evans attracted interest from another Premier League club Bolton Wanderers, but instead joined his local club, Swindon Town, on a free transfer. He made his debut for the club on 12 August 2003, in a League Cup match at Southend United, which Swindon won 3–2. His league debut came on 30 August 2003, in a 2–2 draw against Blackpool. He remained the club's first-choice goalkeeper for the rest of the 2003–04 season, missing just one match with a back injury. The following season, 2004–05, Evans remained the club's first-choice goalkeeper until April 2005 when he was dropped for the first time after a match against Luton Town, although he was installed back in the team after just one match out. With his contract running out at the end of the season he turned down a move to Leeds United and instead signed a one-year contract extension with Swindon. The 2005–06 season began for Evans with a knee injury, when he was forced to play early matches in pain as the club had no back-up goalkeeper available. When Swindon signed Tom Heaton on loan from Manchester United until 2 January 2006, it allowed Evans to have exploratory surgery on the knee. He also spent time at Lilleshall rehabilitation centre before his comeback to the first team in late 2005, when he again established himself. The season ended in relegation for Swindon Town to Football League Two, and Evans won a clean sweep of all the club's \\"player of the season\\" awards. ===Blackpool=== With his contract again up at the end of the season, new Swindon manager Dennis Wise, offered Evans a one-year contract, which Evans turned down as he wished to play at a higher level than League Two. On 1 July 2006, he signed a two-year contract with Blackpool on a free transfer. Evans made 39 consecutive appearances in the 2006–07 league season. On 27 February 2006, he was dropped by Blackpool manager Simon Grayson in favour of then on-loan Paul Rachubka for a match at Oldham Athletic, in which Rachubka kept a clean sheet in a 1–0 win. In April 2007, Evans picked up a hernia injury that required surgery. This kept him out of the side until May. Both the on-loan Rachubka and Blackpool's third-choice keeper, Lewis Edge, also suffered concurrent injuries, which led to Blackpool bringing in Manchester City's Joe Hart on loan as an emergency stand-in. Following promotion to the Football League Championship Rachubka, who by then had signed permanently for the club, remained the first-choice goalkeeper. Evans' only appearances in the first part of the 2007–08 season came in the League Cup against Premier League club Derby County on 28 August 2007, which Blackpool won on penalties after the game ended 2–2 in extra time, and then in the next round of the same competition against Southend United which Blackpool won 2–1 after extra time. On 5 October 2007, Blackpool sent Evans on a month's loan to League Two club Bradford City in order to help him resurrect his career. He made his debut for Bradford against Milton Keynes Dons, his first start in the league since February. However, after just four games, he returned to Blackpool following an injury to his left shoulder, sustained in a 1–1 draw with Grimsby Town on 27 October 2007. While he was at Bradford, Evans had created controversy after publicly criticising the Blackpool fans in an interview with the Telegraph & Argus. He was warned by Blackpool manager Simon Grayson that he would have to accept \\"whatever comes his way\\" when he returned to Blackpool. ===Millwall=== On 22 January 2008, Evans signed for Millwall on a free transfer until the end of the 2007–08 season. He conceded two late goals on his Millwall debut as they lost a two-goal lead to draw 2–2 with Nottingham Forest. Evans played 21 league games and one FA Cup game for Millwall during the season, and although Millwall eventually avoided relegation, manager Kenny Jackett decided not to extend Evans' contract beyond the 2007–08 season. ===Bradford City=== In July 2008, he was given another chance to shine at Bradford City when he was offered a trial by manager Stuart McCall. He played several pre-season friendlies, before he signed a one-year contract on 1 August 2008 ahead of the 2008–09 season. Evans made his debut in the opening game of the season as City won 2–1 against Notts County when he pulled off a number of saves to ensure victory. He was a regular in the City side ahead of understudy Jonathan McLaughlin and earned praise from his manager McCall for one save against Rotherham United, which earned comparison to one made by former England international David Seaman. At the turn of the year, Evans kept four consecutive clean sheets—one short of a club record—before he conceded a deflected free-kick against Accrington Stanley. The run of form prompted Evans to seek a longer contract with the club. The 2008–09 season also saw Evans break his personal record for clean sheets in a season. Evans was an ever-present in the City team during league and cup and was expected to miss his first game in February after he injured his thigh in a game against Darlington. However, after reserve keeper Jonathan McLaughlin suffered concussion in a reserve game, Evans continued to play with a thigh strain. He was released from his contract on 6 May 2009 after the club had to lower the wage budget ===Bristol Rovers=== Evans had a trial with Bristol Rovers, eventually signing a short-term contract. This is his second spell at Rovers, having featured in 2000 on loan from Chelsea. He made his second debut against Aldershot Town in the First Round of the League Cup. He let in one from a penalty, although he also made several vital saves to secure Rovers' passage through. He played because Steve Phillips was in Turkey discussing a move there but rejected a contract and Newcastle would not let Fraser Forster play as he is on loan from the Magpies. He also played in the following round's tie at Cardiff City, as Forster was cup-tied and Steve Phillips has been put on the transfer list, a 2–1 league defeat at Wycombe and a JPT defeat at Hereford. On the 2009 transfer deadline day, he signed a new one-year-deal, Evans made eight appearances in total for Rovers, including four cup outings, before being released along with 14 other players at the end of the 2009/10 season. ===Southend United=== On 22 July 2010, Evans signed a one-year contract with Southend United. At the start of the season, Evans found himself second choice behind Glenn Morris. He made his debut in the Football League Trophy game against Gillingham on 31 August 2010. Evans had to wait until 1 January 2011, to make his league debut for the club in a 2–0 victory over Oxford United. Evans was told that he would not receive a further deal at Southend in May 2011, one of five players to be released by the club. ===Staines Town=== Evans spent part of the 2011–12 campaign following his release training with Conference National side Forest Green Rovers. He then joined Conference South outfit Staines Town and remained at the club until the end of the 2011–12 season. ===Exeter City=== On 18 June 2012, Exeter City announced Evans had signed for the club on a one-year contract. On 30 April 2013, he was released by the Exeter due to the expiry of his contract. ===Hereford United=== Evans agreed to join Hereford United on 1 August 2013 following a successful trial. ===Coaching career=== On 21 May 2015, The Hereford Times reported that Evans had agreed to join Hereford as a coach, taking coaching sessions once a week.http://bullsnews.blogspot.co.uk/2015/05/former-keeper-to-return.html During his time with the Bulls he played for Wimborne Town alongside his coaching responsibilities.Wimborne Town sign former Football League star Rhys Evans Evans was registered as a player at Edgar Street in March 2018.Rhys Evans Moves To Hereford He left the club in October 2018, shortly after the departure of Peter Beadle.Goalkeeping Coach Evans Leaves Hereford In February 2019, Evans signed for Hellenic Football League side Royal Wootton Bassett Town.Royal Wootton Bassett snap up former Swindon Town stopper Rhys Evans for remainder of Hellenic League campaign In June 2019, he joined Swindon Supermarine as goalkeeping coach.

Rubber band guns are often used in live-action games such as Assassins, in which they are common and popular toy weapons. They are also common in offices and classrooms. Rubber band guns have been popular toys that date back to the invention of rubber bands, which were patented in England on March 17, 1845 by Stephen Perry.March 17 - Today in Science HistoryHow rubber bands are made. This reference states that the rubber is vulcanized before it is extruded. The rubber is then \\"cured\\" on mandrels. The \\"Made How\\" reference appears to directly copy text from other sources, some of which appears to be incorrect. The exact same text regarding Thomas Hancock appears in a 1995 book entitled \\"CD's, super glue and salsa: how everyday products are made\\" by Kathleen Witman, Kyung-Sun Lim, Neil Schlager. Contradicting other sources, both credit Thomas Perry rather than Stephen Perry for the invention of the rubber band. == Rubber band gun types == === Clothespin === A simple rubber band pistol using a clothespin as its firing mechanism This is the simplest form of rubber band gun. Its firing mechanism consists solely of a clothespin. The gun may have more than one clothespin, thereby allowing more than one band to be fired. === Repeating === This RBG allows user to load many rubber bands around the handle of the gun, in the firing position. One rubber band is staged in the firing position and is shot by pulling a pivoting trigger. It is usually cheaper than an automatic or semi-automatic gun with fewer moving pieces. === Semi-automatic === A semi-automatic rubber band gun is capable of firing at least three rubber bands when fully loaded. Semi-automatic rubber band guns are available in a variety of semi-realistic shapes, such as Luger- style pistols, rifles, and Tommy guns. The repeater RBG is usually made of wood (although many Lego-based designs have been produced), and has a plastic firing mechanism, consisting of a toothed wheel onto which the bands are hooked, and a sprung trigger or escapement that releases the wheel by one notch, releasing a rubber band every time the trigger is pulled. In Lego designs, a gear is commonly used in place of the toothed wheel, and due to how fine the teeth on the gear are, the escapement allows a rotation of more than one tooth, requiring rubber bands to be loaded a set number of teeth apart. === Automatic === Fully automatic mechanisms for rubber band guns are analogous to automatic firearm mechanisms, in that the energy used to drive the gun's mechanism is derived from the same source as that which provides energy to propel the projectiles (in the case of automatic rubber band guns, the potential energy stored in the stretched rubber band). Fully automatic designs pose significant challenges to designers, such as how to control rate of fire. === Rotary === A rubber band rotary gun consists of between 3 and 12 repeater RBGs arranged on a cylindrical \\"rotor\\" as barrels. The rotor rotates and each individual barrel is fired as it reaches the top of its locus. The Disintegrator atop its tripod The original tripod-mounted rubber band rotary gun, patented by Surefire Products, was featured on the Gadget Show on UK television in March 2007 and January 2010. A twelve-barrel rotary gun using twelve-shot repeater mechanisms can fire 144 rubber bands automatically. It is fired by manually rotating a crank handle and pulling a firing trigger. Motorized RBGs with rotary barrels are among the latest developments in the world of rubber band guns. In November 2007, Anthony Smith completed the Disintegrator, a 288-shot motorized rubber band gun with 2 12-barrel counter- rotating rotors. This gun can be mounted on a tripod or fired from the hip, and can fire more than 40 rounds per second. There are two common versions of the rubber band rotary gun mechanism: ==== String-operated ==== A rotor with a pre-prepared string spooled around it pulls off rubber bands one-by-one as it is unwound from the rotor and off the barrel. The string is wound around one barrel, then a rubber band placed on that barrel, then the next barrel, and so on. ==== Semi-automatic barrels ==== Each barrel has a semi-auto mechanism on it with a trigger that is pressed once the barrel reaches a certain point. ==Materials== Rubber band guns can be created with many different media: === Wood === The majority of lasting, reliable rubber band guns are made of machined wood. Among the most popular wooden RBG designers are parabellum1262, who has developed plenty of magazine-fed automatic and select-fire designs, and the Japanese oggcraft, known for his unique firing mechanisms. === Popsicle sticks === A rubber band alt= A alt= Rubber band guns can be made from Popsicle sticks. The individual sticks are held together by either rubber bands, tape or glue. They can also be cut or carved to the required shape. It is generally limited to pistols and sniper rifles, as only one or two shots can be loaded on most guns, but semi-automatic ice-cream stick guns have been made by determined amateurs. They can also be adapted to fire arrows or other small objects with the rubber bands. In some guns, the handle doubles as a trigger, but having a separate trigger and handle provides much better accuracy. Rubber band guns can be made using only Popsicle sticks, staples, and rubber bands of various styles and sizes. This specialized technique developed and honed by then-high school student Stuart A. Burton is very malleable and can be utilized to develop very advanced and complicated rubber band guns. For instance, using levers and sliding mechanisms, one can make a pump action shotgun. Using simple geometry and specialized positioning, you can easily make semi-automatic and 2-shot burst fire weapons, as well as more complicated fully automatic weapons using paperclips as an axis for a rotating firing piece. Occasionally, other materials (like bamboo skewers, for instance) may be used in the making of the gun. Sights, foregrips and magazines to hold extra rubber bands may also be made according to the owner's preferences. Through creativity and imagination, one can make detachable sights, grips, stocks, silencers, and under-barrel shotguns or grenade launchers. === K'Nex === Rubber band guns can be built from K'Nex. Such constructions can include handheld pistols, automatics and sniper rifles. Some K'Nex guns work using the escapement mechanism seen in semi-automatic rubber band guns, while some more advanced types have hinge triggers that are more reliable, allow for more bands on a barrel, and have a more realistic trigger pull. === Lego === In early 2007, Sebastian Dick built a motorized rubber band rotary gun entirely from Lego. It is capable of firing 11 rounds per second. Many other builders on YouTube followed suit, building string-operated miniguns, while some even shoot actual bricks. Many RBGs can be built out of Lego, from simple hinge guns to extremely complex fire-rate-dampening automatic rifles. Lego rubber band gun mechanisms can also be used to launch light projectiles of various types, from small bricks and paper planes to wooden skewers. Lego rubber band guns are also quite reliable, without all the complexity of K'Nex. Most Lego rubber band guns have been made and posted to YouTube, some even firing small bricks using the mechanism. It is difficult to devise a suitable, practical magazine-fed rubber band gun system out of Lego, due to the elasticity of rubber bands (which requires a mechanism to lock the retention wheel when not connected to the firing mechanism). A young adult under the name of Kaspall was known to make several Lego guns and made an appearance on television in Austria. ==References== ==External links== * Video of the K'nexecutioner, a K'nex Gatling gun, in operation * Video of the Lego Gatling gun in operation * The Disintegrator, a 288-shot, motorised, cordless double rubber band minigun * Video of the Disintegrator in operation * BandGuns.Com, historically accurate surgical tubing guns for reenactors * Category:Toy weapons Category:Rubber toys ","title":"Rubber band gun"},{"id":"2576337","text":"Plac Wilsona (English: Wilson Square) is a station on Line M1 of the Warsaw Metro.

Formerly, Yusupova was the director of the Grozny office of Memorial. Currently, Yusupova is completing a two-year law fellowship in Moscow. ==Biography== Yusupova was born to Chechen father and Russian mother in the city of Grozny. She studied Russian Literature at the Karachaevo-Cherkeski Intstitute. Later she studied law at the Chechen University in the city of Grozny, and served as a professor in that field. During the First Chechen War, she witnessed the tragedy of war, and suffered the loss of several friends, neighbors, colleagues, and family members. In 2000, during the Second Chechen War, she decided to devote her life to human rights, using her legal expertise and personal experience during both wars to help others that were entangled in the bloody conflict. ==Human rights== Yusupova gathers testimony from victims of human rights abuses, and presses their cases with law enforcement and military agencies. Not only does she, to the extent possible, provide the victims with legal assistance, but she also informs the rest of the world on violations of human rights, committed by Russian armed forces and Chechen rebels alike. Yusupova has been described by the BBC News service as \\"the bravest woman in Europe\\", and representatives of Amnesty International have similarly declared her \\"one of the most courageous women in Europe\\".Chechen human rights worker wins prestigious Martin Ennals award Both Yusupova and her organization have been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Yusupova has been awarded the 2004 Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders and the 2005 Professor Thorolf Rafto Memorial Prize. The International Federation of Human Rights reported that Yusupova faced death threats for her work on October 12, 2006. ==Quotes== *\\"Mass-scale human-rights violations and state-level terror still are the order of the day...Everyone now is endangered, not only those who live in Chechnya, but those who live in Russia as well... Society will respond. Some counterweight to this lunacy must emerge, be it in the shape of a new dissident movement, or other forms we don't yet discern. The authorities will as inevitably seek to suppress this movement cruelly and brutally. But suppression will only promote its growth, all the fears notwithstanding.\\" *\\"...we should not give up and say that the situation is hopeless. There is still our conscience, there is still the memory of the victims of this war, there is still our duty to try and prevent further bloodshed. We have to prosecute all the perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\\" *\\"Religious extremism does not lead anywhere, it only leads to an impasse. It has happened before in Chechnya’s history; women had to wear scarves and stand opposite of the men on public transportation. Those rules were ridiculous especially in comparison to all of the serious problems Chechnya had. What about the problems in Chechnya and Ingushetia, have they been solved? How many people are dead or missing? How many people are unemployed, pensioners or disabled? Let us look at these issues and stop talking about how long women’s skirts should be or whether or not they should wear scarves on their heads.\\" ==Awards== *2004 Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders for researching about data of war victims, investigations of murder and kidnapping in Chechen Republic.

The band released their self entitled debut EP in the Summer of 2005 which attracted a flurry of label attention and eventually culminated in the signing of a 5-album contract to Polydor UK/ Universal Music in December 2005. The flaws released three full-length studio albums between 2007 and 2016. The Flaws consist of: Paul Finn on Vocals/Guitar, Paul Mallon on Bass/Backing Vocals, Shane Malone, Lead Guitar and drummer Colin Berrill. ==Career== ===Background=== The original group went to Patrician High School secondary school together in Carrickmacross and formed a band in the early 2000s called Sweet Relief during their Dublin college years. A more serious approach to original music culminated in a band name change, the recruiting of Dundalk music guru Derek Turner of Tumbleweed Studios, Spirit Store and Honey Thieves fame and extensive Irish original music venue touring ensured a sound foundation for the quartet in those early years. Popular venues such as the aforementioned Spirit Store, McHughs Drogheda, Eamon Doran’s, Cypress Avenue, Dolan’s, Auntie Annies, McGarrigles, Voodoo Lounge, Yukon Bar, An Roisin Dubh were frequented as the band shaped their musical niche. The Flaws embarked on an extensive tour during the Summer of 2005 around Ireland with Dublin band Delorentos and Belfast indie outfit Fast Emperors. Other high-profile support slots to The Fratellis and Editors helped bolster the bands growing popularity in the early days. In July 2007 original drummer, founding member Stephen Finnegan left the band for personal reasons. ===Popularity=== The Flaws played the Crawdaddy Stage of Electric Picnic at 13:15 on Sunday 2 September 2007. They did an instore in BPM in Wexford on Sunday 28 October at 15:30. They played \\"Rock 'N Roulette\\" on The Podge and Rodge Show on Tuesday 20 November. The Flaws were nominated for two Meteor Awards in the categories \\"Best Irish Album\\", and \\"Best Irish Band\\" at the 2008 Meteor Awards. Their debut album, Achieving Vagueness was also nominated for the Choice Music Prize. The list of 2008 festival appearances for the band includes a return to the Electric Picnic and slots at Glastonbury, Indie-pendence and Castlepalooza. The Flaws have also had their music played on a number of radio stations and music channels in Italy. ==Discography== The Flaws's four-track EP was recorded in Tumbleweed Studios in Dundalk, County Louth. National commercial radio station Today FM broadcast the track on Alison Curtis's The Last Splash programme, in which she described the lead track \\"16\\" as \\"brilliant\\". The EP also includes the tracks \\"Idolise\\", \\"Everybody's Got to be Somewhere\\" and \\"Fed to the Lions\\". Their debut album, Achieving Vagueness was released on 14 September 2007 to critical acclaim. A Choice Music Prize nomination for the album followed on 10 January 2008. Their debut album was recorded and mixed by acclaimed Irish producer Gareth Mannix (Republic of Loose/Delorentos/Director). October 2010 saw the release of the group's second album, Constant Adventure. The Flaws went on a hiatus for 2 years, infrequently releasing singles until they announced that they would release a third record. \\"Springtime For The Flaws\\", was released 24 April 2015. The Flaws subsequently disbanded in 2016. In May 2020 unannounced song entitled “All Of Us” was released on social media with accompanying video. ==Albums== *Achieving Vagueness, 2007 *Constant Adventure, 2010 *Springtime For The Flaws, 2015 ==Singles== *No Room (March 2006) *Out Tonight (June 2006) *Sixteen (May 2007, IRE No. 29) *1981 (July 2007) *You and I (November 2007) *I Don't Wanna Dance (September 2009) *Part of You (October 2010) *Make Good (February 2011) *Constant Adventure (June 2011) *Million Miles (May 2012) *Let's Fight (July 2012) *Animals (September 2014) *That's What You Get (February 2015) ==References== * Hotpress Yearbook 2007, 2008 ==External links== * * The Flaws Bebo Page * FREE ACOUSTIC SESSION by The Flaws from NvTv Category:Carrickmacross Category:Irish indie rock groups ","title":"The Flaws"},{"id":"2576353","text":"Alan Reeves (born 19 November 1967) is an English former footballer.

The list typically consists of a series of individual data items, each of which is recorded on a Data Item form (DD Form 1423) containing the tailored data requirements and delivery information. The CDRL is the standard format for identifying potential data requirements in a solicitation, and deliverable data requirements in a contract. The purpose of the CDRL is to provide a standardized method of clearly and unambiguously delineating the government's minimum essential data needs. The CDRL groups all of the data requirements in a single place rather than having them scattered throughout the solicitation or contract. Each CDRL data item should be linked directly to statement of work (SOW) tasks and managed by the program office data manager. Data requirements can also be identified in the contract via special contract clauses (e.g., DFARS), which define special data provisions such as rights in data, warranty, etc. SOW guidance of MIL-HDBK-245D describes the desired relationship: \\"Work requirements should be specified in the SOW, and all data requirements for delivery, format, and content should be in the contract data requirements list in conjunction with the appropriate Data Item Description (DID) respectively, with none of the requirements restated in other parts of the contract.\\" Subpart 215.470 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) document requires the use of the CDRL in solicitations when the contract will require delivery of data. Guidance on how to fill in and handle DD Form 1423-1 is provided in publication 5010.12-M. Other US government agencies may include CDRLs in contracts, but these will not use the military's DD Form 1423. Most data items are developed and delivered in compliance with pre-defined data item descriptions (DID). These pre-defined data items may be tailored by deleting any part of a DID that is not applicable to the specific acquisition,.5010.12-M Procedures for the Acquisition and Management of Technical Data, pg 11 DL1.1.27 Tailoring of Data Requirements The CDRL form provides a block for simple citation of which DID it is, as well as where it is mentioned in the SOW and what part(s) of the overall work breakdown structure it is involved with. The remarks block may explain how the DID will be applied, but can not alter or add to the DID. (Language altering the data item description would obviously make it no longer a standard DID available by simple citation, pre-approved, and readily handled by existing Department of Defense processes.) Contracts issued by governments (including their militaries) outside the US also use CDRLs as part of their statements of Work. These CDRLs do not use the US military's DD Form 1423, but may utilize some of the same elements to define their need for documentation. == See also == * Data Item Descriptions (DID) * MIL-STD-498 Software Development standard example of DID usage * Statement Of Work (SOW) == References == == External links == * What is the CDRL?

The first known tropical cyclone of the season, it was observed first as a minimal hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico near Dry Tortugas on August 9\\\\. Moving northwestward, the cyclone quickly intensified into a strong Category 4 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson scale by the following day. Late on August 10, the hurricane made landfall on Last Island, Louisiana, with winds at 150 mph (240 km/h), hours before striking near New Iberia. The system rapidly weakened after moving inland, falling to tropical storm intensity on August 11\\\\. The storm would be last noted over Mississippi on the next day. Offshore, at least 183 people drowned after steamers and schooners sank in rough seas produced by the hurricane. A storm surge between completely submerged Last Island in Louisiana, destroying virtually every structure, including the hotels and casinos, while all crops were ruined. Additionally, Last Island itself was split in two. Inland, heavy rainfall caused the Mermentau River to flood, destroying crops and every house in Abbeville. The storm produced as much as of precipitation in New Orleans. In Plaquemines Parish, rice fields were under several feet of water, while many orange trees lost their fruit. Overall, the hurricane resulted in at least 200 fatalities. ==Meteorological history== The cyclone was first detected in the eastern Gulf of Mexico 125 miles (200 km) west-northwest of Key West, Florida, on August 8, 1856. Because it was already a hurricane when it was first observed, it probably had developed further east than here. It advanced steadily northwest, strengthening to the equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane. The hurricane gradually slowed prior to landfall on August 10, and it attained its estimated peak intensity of 150 mph (240 km/h). It was a tropical cyclone of small diameter, and its maximum sustained winds may have reached Category 5 status, but were unrecorded. During the early evening of August 10 the northeastern edge of the eye crossed over Last Island (Official name: Isle Dernière) before making landfall a few hours later south of New Iberia, Louisiana. The cyclone is believed to have struck southern Louisiana at peak intensity with an approximate central pressure of 934 mbar (27.58 inHg). A ship reported a peripheral pressure of 955 mbar (28.20 inHg), so a lower pressure was based on the small size of the hurricane. It quickly weakened over land, and it diminished to a tropical storm on August 11. It dissipated over southwestern Mississippi on August 12 with fully tropical characteristics. ==Impact and aftermath== ===Last Island=== Many vacationers hoping to escape were awaiting the scheduled arrival of the ship Star, which provided regular service to the mainland. However, the Star was blown off course, barely escaping sailing into the open gulf, directly into the hurricane, where it would have almost certainly been lost. Passenger Tom Ellis, an experienced captain in local waters, and a few other passengers noticed the ship was off course. Ellis alerted Captain Abe Smith, who corrected the course and barely making headway against the winds, managed to pull into the channel behind the hotel. The Star was swept, crashing into shore and beached on the sand, where it stayed through the storm. Visibility during the storm was extremely limited and eyes were blasted by sand until water covered the beaches. Sometime between 4:00 and 5:00 PM the storm surge occurred suddenly, with the water rising several feet in a matter of minutes. The storm surge submerged the entire island and destroyed all of the buildings. The hotel, which held many women and children on the second floor and men on the first, collapsed, crushing many and sweeping others out to sea. Several survivors managed to make their way to the hull of the Star. By tying himself with a rope to the Star, Captain Abe Smith was able to rescue at least 40 people from the storm surge. The Star would serve as a shelter for the survivors until rescuers arrived three days later. Many managed to survive by sheltering in or behind overturned cisterns, which were large wooden cylindrical tanks reinforced with iron hoops. Some clung to the raised foundations of the cisterns and a few to trees. A dozen people survived by clinging to a large piece of rotating playground equipment atop a levee. Many people floated on debris, including wall sections, logs and furniture. A sturdy wooden enclosure that held large terrapins, a regional delicacy, provided enough protection to save several individuals. Another group survived by burying their feet in the sand and holding hands. Some survivors were carried to the marshes on the mainland, although some perished from injuries or lack of food and water. Of the approximately 400 vacationers on the island, 198 were known or presumed dead and 203 were known survivors. Dixon (2009) provides lists of survivors and the dead. Several of the victims were enslaved people. Some of the enslaved people were credited with rescuing others, including several children. The tragedy greatly affected the planter society, which lost many members. At the time of the hurricane approximately two-thirds of the millionaires in the U.S. lived in Louisiana, many of those being plantation owners, especially sugar growers. Of the social group affected, many were friends, acquaintances, or related by marriage or known through business. The family home of three of the Last Island casualties was Shadows- on-the-Teche in New Iberia, Louisiana, now a National Historic Landmark. Mrs. Frances Weeks (Magill) Pruett and her children Mary Ida Magill and Augustine Magill died in the natural disaster. The two children were buried in the plantation's cemetery.http://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GScid;=2352989&GRid;=71058250& The island itself was split into the Last Islands (Isles Dernieres). The island reportedly stayed submerged for several days before parts of it re-emerged as large sandbars. After the storm surge, the remains of the Star were the only sign that an island had ever existed there. Presently, the area is used by pelicans and other birds. ===Elsewhere=== The following is the number of deaths offshore: :Steamer Nautilus: 85 :Steamer Manilla: 13 :Schooner Ellen: 15 :Other losses at sea: 20 The city of New Orleans was inundated with 13.14 inches (335 mm) of rain. Every building in the town of Abbeville, Louisiana, was destroyed. There was severe flooding throughout Plaquemines Parish. ==In print== The disaster became national news as soon as three survivors salvaged a small boat and sailed to the mainland for help. In addition to the several first hand accounts, the story of Lost Island has been republished periodically. The list below includes only a few versions: *In 1871 Harper's New Monthly had a story about the capsizing of the steamer Nautilus and Jim Frisbee, the ship's second steward, the only survivor. *Lafcadio Hearn's novel Chita: A Memory of Last Island (1889), based on the Last Island hurricane of 1856, was a popular story when published; however, it either created or perpetuated several myths about the tragedy. One of the main sources of Hearn's novel was identified as the account written by Iberville Parish sugar planter Michael Shlatre. After publication of Chita, Michael Shlatre's document became lost after being borrowed and not returned. The document was recovered during 1936, when it was found in the Iberville Parish courthouse in Plaquemine, La.. *Bill Dixon's Last Days of Last Island (2009) was written using information from various archives in an attempt to be historically accurate. The numerous references include a newspaper article, a few books, and accounts of the survivors, many of whom are quoted. == Bibliography == * Last Island, by James M.

Two families, the Kleinworts and the Bensons, founded two very different merchant banks in London. They merged in 1961 to create Kleinwort Benson Lonsdale, later Kleinwort Benson. Following its acquisition by Société Générale in June 2016, it was merged with SG Hambros, already a subsidiary of Société Générale, to form Kleinwort Hambros in November 2016. ==History== The 20 Fenchurch Street building occupied by Kleinwort Benson. It was demolished in 2007 ===Kleinworts=== The earliest known Kleinwort to go into banking was 24-year-old Heinrich Kleinwort, a grandfather of Sir Alexander Drake Kleinwort, 1st Baronet. In 1786, Heinrich set up a partnership with Otto Mueller in Holstein to finance trade with England. Kleinworts established a successful trading business in Cuba, profiting from the expansion of the H. Upmann and Sons cigar business.Wake 1997, p. 79 Edward Cohen and James Drake joined the firm in the 1830s and for a while it was known as Drake, Kleinwort and Cohen; it was then renamed Kleinwort, Sons and Company in the 1880s. The firm helped finance Francisco Franco's coup d'état in Spain by approving a credit of 800,000 pounds at 4% interest on 15 September 1937. A month later Kleinworts agreed another loan of 1,500,000 pounds sterling at 3%. ===Robert Benson & Co.=== In 1786, Robert Benson, a Quaker, joined with William Rathbone IV of the existing house of William Rathbone & Co. to form Rathbone & Benson, a Liverpool business trading mainly with America. Over the course of the 19th century, the Benson family, under the control of Robin Benson, grew its wealth through railway finance in Britain, Europe and America. For example it became part of a syndicate that marketed shares in the Illinois Central Railroad in 1852.Wilkins, p. 852 In 1947 Robert Benson and Co. merged with Lonsdale Investment Trust (founded by Leo Lonsdale) to form Robert Benson, Lonsdale and Co.Wake 1997, p. 478 The Benson family interest in the group was watered down but operational control of bank remained with its Chairman, Rex Benson.Jehanne Wake, \\"Benson, Sir Reginald Lindsay [Rex] (1889–1968)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (online edition, Oxford University Press, September 2004).

The merged firm acquired the bullion dealer Sharps Pixley in 1966 thereby securing a seat on the London gold price fixing committee that met twice daily in the offices of N M Rothschild & Sons. Kleinwort Benson worked on several major mergers and acquisitions at this time including the merger of Cadbury with Schweppes in 1969. The firm decided to enter the securities market buying Grieveson Grant, a leading stockbroker, in April 1986.Wake 1997, p. 428 Although, like many other banks at the time, Kleinwort Benson contemplated buying a jobbing firm in order to get into that part of the market, in the end it was saved from having to do so by the defection of a number of senior market-makers from Wedd Durlacher Mordaunt as it was acquired by Barclays Bank. In the 1980s, Kleinwort Benson was a pioneer in privatisation. It managed the reprivatisation of British Aerospace, the first of the British Government's programme of disposals in 1981. It also managed the flotation of Cable & Wireless in the same year.Parker 2009, p. 459 It next advised on the privatisation of Associated British Ports in 1983. It went on to advise the British Government on the sale of 50.2% of British Telecom, the largest ever share issue at the time, in 1984. It assisted with the privatization of Enterprise Oil in the same year. Important private sector transactions at that time included the takeover of Harrods by the Fayed brothers in 1984. The firm also worked on overseas privatisations advising the Italian government on the IPO of Enel in 1993. In the United Kingdom it advised on Carlton Communications' £723 million takeover of Central Television in the same year. ===Dresdner Kleinwort=== In 1995, Kleinwort Benson was acquired by Dresdner Bank and, as Dresdner Kleinwort, became its investment banking arm.

It is a legal concept originating in Roman civil law, but it is essentially the equivalent of the double jeopardy (autrefois acquit) doctrine found in common law jurisdictions. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights guarantees the right to be free from double jeopardy; however, it does not apply to prosecutions by two different sovereignsFor example, see A.P. v Italy, UN HRC CCPR/C/31/D/204/1986 (unless the relevant extradition treaty expresses a prohibition). The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court creates a different form of non bis in idem. == Rome Statute and ad hoc UN tribunals == The Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court (ICC) states that the non bis in idem principle has a peculiar meaning, especially in comparison to European supranational law. The ICC jurisdiction is complementary to national law, and Article 20 of the Rome Statute specifies that even if the principle remains in general terms, it cannot be taken in consideration if there is unwillingness or incapability of the existence of the supranational court's jurisdiction. Article 10 of the ICTY Statute and Article 9 of the ICTR Statute both state that the principle can be enforced mainly to clarify that the ad hoc tribunal's sentences are \\"stronger\\" than the ones in domestic courts. In other words, national courts cannot proceed against the responsible parties of crimes within the tribunal's jurisdiction if the international tribunal has already pronounced sentence for the same crimes. However, the ICTY and the ICTR can judge alleged criminals already sentenced by national courts if both of the following occur: *the sentence defined the crimes as \\"ordinary\\". *the judiciary of the state is not considered impartial or the domestic trial is considered to be a pretense to protect the accused from the legal action of international justice or is considered to be unfair on some fundamental legal basis. ===European Court of Human Rights - Zolotukhin vs Russia=== European Court of Human Rights ruling in the case Zolotukhin vs Russia have had a noticeable impact on practical law in Europe. The double punishment ban applies to all forms. The verdict in the case Zolotukhin / Russia on February 10, 2009 of the European Court of Human Rights is about a Russian military discipline case. The Russian soldier Sergey Zolotukhin took his girlfriend into the military without permission, acted threateningly, used an obscene language and insulted the police officers who arrested him. Eleven years later, the conflict over the Russian soldier's punishment, both administrative and criminal, has had consequences for double punishments throughout Europe. Especially in tax fraud cases the ruling has changed many court cases after the February 10, 2009. The defendant has paid tax fines to the tax authority for incorrect tax declarations, then being sentenced by a district court for tax crimes.

After a successful playing career that spanned 18 years, Stefani Miglioranzi retired from playing professionally and became a Registered Intermediary and licensed FIFA match agent for First Wave Sports International, a full service agency for professional soccer players / footballers. ==Career== ===Early Life and College Career=== Born in Brazil, Miglioranzi moved with his family to the United States when he was 12. He played for FC Westchester as youth player from 12–19 years old. He attended St. John's University in New York City on an athletic scholarship, where he won the 1996 NCAA Championship and also was a member of the 1998 All-American team. Miglioranzi was drafted by the Chicago Fire in the third round of the 1999 MLS College Draft with the final pick of the draft, but turned down the offer, having already been offered a contract to play in England. ===Portsmouth=== He went to England in 1998 to take part in trials with Everton and Portsmouth, where manager Alan Ball offered a 3-year contract. Everton and Bolton Wanderers were also heavily interested at the time. ===Swindon Town=== Miglioranzi signed for Swindon in July 2002, after a successful trial spell prompted Andy King to offer him a deal. Due to worries over a serious knee injury he picked up whilst at Portsmouth, his original contract was on a month-to-month basis. He made his debut for the club on the opening day of the 2002/03 season, in a 3–1 win over Barnsley. Despite the fears for his fitness, Miglioranzi missed just five league games in his first season at the club, and he scored four goals in total - all of which were from the edge of the Penalty area. During this period, there were fears he would be poached, as he remained on a monthly contract - these fears were allayed in May 2003, when, after a good season, he agreed a year's deal, with a second year triggered if a certain number of appearances were reached. A number of nagging injuries during 2003/04 meant that the extension was not automatically triggered. Miglioranzi had another good season, including a game in the League Cup match at Leeds United (where he missed one of the penalties in the shootout), and only struggled for form when he was rushed back to the first team after groin and ankle injuries kept him out of the side during January and March. Injury also meant that he missed the final game of the season, and the first leg of the play-off semi-final against Brighton and Hove Albion - nevertheless, he was offered a new two-year contract in May 2004, which he signed. Miglioranzi started the first four games of the 2004/05 season, but went off injured in the first half at Bristol City, and he missed two league games. Worse was to follow at the end of September however, when he ruptured an abductor muscle in a home match with Bradford City - an injury that kept him out of the first team for nearly four months - his rehabilitation not helped by a lack of reserve team fixtures during his comeback. Eventually, he played seventy minutes of a Wiltshire Premier Shield semi-final tie against Supermarine in mid-December, giving a performance that he himself described as \\"appalling\\". It was another month before he appeared in the first team, coming on as a late substitute in a home game with Blackpool in mid-January, before being recalled to the starting line-up the following week. In truth, it was probably a bit too soon - Miglioranzi looked to lack any sort of match fitness, and he spent most of February back on the substitutes bench. He returned to the starting eleven in mid-March at table-topping Luton Town, and missed just two more matches toward the end of the season with a cyst on the back of his knee, before returning in an unfamiliar central defensive role for the final game of the campaign. Having declared that the past season had been disappointing for him, both on the pitch and in terms of injuries, Miglioranzi saw a consultant and returned to pre-season training early in a bid to put his injury woes behind him. No sooner as he declared that he was feeling the best he had for a long time during the build-up, a sprained ankle picked up in a friendly at Aylesbury United forced him to miss the opening four matches of the season - and his campaign started as a second-half substitute in a 4–2 victory over Yeovil Town at the end of August. Just a month later though, Miglioranzi's injury curse struck again, as he hobbled off part way through a home game with Bradford - the medial ligament strain he sustained keeping him out of action for over a month. He returned to league action with a great performance in a local derby with Bristol City that the Town won 2-1 - but a dead leg he picked up in that game kept him out of the following match - he returned to action the following week and remained in the side for the rest of the year, helping the Town to an undefeated December. Miglioranzi though failed to produce the form of his first two seasons at the club, and in every match in which he featured for the rest of the season, he was either substitute, or substituted - Gareth Whalley taking over his position in mid- March. A first-half substitute appearance versus MK Dons in mid-April proved to be Miglioranzi's last in a Town shirt - a knee injury that lead to surgery preventing him from featuring in any of the Town's last four matches - and come the season's end, it was a mutual decision that he would seek a fresh challenge elsewhere. Several English clubs were rumoured to be interested in Miglioranzi after the announcement that he would leave Swindon - clubs included the Town's bitter rival Oxford United. However, Miglioranzi rejected the chance to talk to the Non-League outfit. ===Return to MLS=== In 2006, Miglioranzi signed with the Los Angeles Galaxy in Major League Soccer, but was traded to Columbus Crew in 2007 after making just three appearances for Galaxy. Miglioranzi spent two years in Ohio, winning the MLS Cup, the MLS Supporters' Shield and the Trillium Cup in 2008, before being traded back to Galaxy on January 9, 2009, in exchange for a conditional fourth-round selection in the 2010 MLS SuperDraft. Miglioranzi was selected by Philadelphia Union in the 2009 MLS Expansion Draft on November 25, 2009.Union select 10 players in expansion draft He stayed with Philadelphia for two seasons. After the 2011 season the club declined his 2012 contract option and he entered the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Miglioranzi was not selected in the draft and became a free agent. === Retirement === After retiring, Miglioranzi became a USSF registered players' agent and holds a FIFA Match Agent License. He currently is the President of First Wave Sports International. ==Honours== ===Columbus Crew=== *Major League Soccer Eastern Conference Championship (1): 2008 *Major League Soccer MLS Cup (1): 2008 *Major League Soccer Supporter's Shield (1): 2008 ===Los Angeles Galaxy=== *Major League Soccer Western Conference Championship (1): 2009 ===St. John's University=== *NCAA Championship (1): 1996 ==Career statistics== Updated October 30, 2011 {border=1 align=center cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2 style=\\"background: ivory; font-size: 95%; border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; clear:center\\" - style=\\"background:beige\\" !rowspan=\\"2\\" !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"2\\" Football League Championship !colspan=\\"2\\"FA Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Europe !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - style=\\"background:beige\\" !App !Goals !App !Goals !App !Goals !App !Goals !App !Goals - rowspan=\\"5\\" align=center valign=centerPortsmouth align=\\"center\\"1998-99 align=\\"center\\"7 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"- align=\\"center\\"- align=\\"center\\"7 align=\\"center\\"0 - align=\\"center\\"1999-00 align=\\"center\\"13 align=\\"center\\"2 align=\\"center\\"1 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"3 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"- align=\\"center\\"- align=\\"center\\"17 align=\\"center\\"2 - align=\\"center\\"2000-01 align=\\"center\\"12 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"2 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"- align=\\"center\\"- align=\\"center\\"14 align=\\"center\\"0 - align=\\"center\\"2001-02 align=\\"center\\"3 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"1 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"- align=\\"center\\"- align=\\"center\\"4 align=\\"center\\"0 - - style=\\"background:lemonchiffon\\" ! colspan=\\"1\\" align=\\"left\\" Club Total !! 35 !! 2 !! 1 !! 0 !! 6 !! 0 !! 0 !! 0 !! 42 !! 2 - - style=\\"background:beige\\" !rowspan=\\"2\\" !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"2\\" Football League One !colspan=\\"2\\"FA Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Europe !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - style=\\"background:beige\\" !App !Goals !App !Goals !App !Goals !App !Goals !App !Goals - rowspan=\\"5\\" align=center valign=centerSwindon Town align=\\"center\\"2002-03 align=\\"center\\"41 align=\\"center\\"3 align=\\"center\\"1 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"1 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"- align=\\"center\\"- align=\\"center\\"43 align=\\"center\\"3 - align=\\"center\\"2003-04 align=\\"center\\"36 align=\\"center\\"4 align=\\"center\\"1 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"2 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"- align=\\"center\\"- align=\\"center\\"39 align=\\"center\\"4 - align=\\"center\\"2004-05 align=\\"center\\"21 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"1 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"- align=\\"center\\"- align=\\"center\\"22 align=\\"center\\"0 - align=\\"center\\"2005-06 align=\\"center\\"26 align=\\"center\\"1 align=\\"center\\"1 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"- align=\\"center\\"- align=\\"center\\"27 align=\\"center\\"1 - - style=\\"background:lemonchiffon\\" ! colspan=\\"1\\" align=\\"left\\" Club Total !! 124 !! 8 !! 3 !! 0 !! 4 !! 0 !! 0 !! 0 !! 131 !! 8 - - style=\\"background:beige\\" !rowspan=\\"2\\" !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"2\\" MLS !colspan=\\"2\\"U.S. Open Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"MLS Cup Playoffs !colspan=\\"2\\"North America !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - style=\\"background:beige\\" !App !Goals !App !Goals !App !Goals !App !Goals !App !Goals - rowspan=\\"2\\" align=center valign=centerLos Angeles Galaxy align=\\"center\\"2006 align=\\"center\\"3 align=\\"center\\"0 align=\\"center\\"?

An allegation, especially made by adherents of the Italian Communist Party, was that the government trumped up and intentionally allowed the attacks of communist radicals as an excuse to arrest other communists, and allowed the attacks of far-right paramilitary organizations as an extrajudicial way to silence enemies. The veracity of parts of these allegations has been disputed; while most sources agree that elements within the Italian government were eager to use the terrorist strikes as a reason to round-up communists, the idea that the government directly worked with said communist groups is more far-fetched. In the same way, some contacts between the government and far-right organizations existed, but allegations of an explicit \\"green light\\" to perform raids and the like are considered less reliable. Various parliamentary committees were held to investigate these crimes as well as prosecute them in the 1990s. A 1995 report from the Left Democrats (the rebranded Communist Party of Italy, PCI) to a subcommittee of the Italian Parliament stated that a \\"strategy of tension\\" had been supported by the United States to \\"stop the PCI, and to a certain degree also the PSI, from reaching executive power in the country\\". Aldo Giannuli, a historian who worked as a consultant to the parliamentary terrorism commission, wrote that he considered the Left Democrats' report as dictated primarily by domestic political considerations rather than historical ones: \\"Since they have been in power the Left Democrats have given us very little help in gaining access to security service archives,\\" he said. \\"This is a falsely courageous report.\\" Giannuli did decry the fact that many more leftist terrorists were prosecuted and convicted than rightist terrorists, though. Swiss academic Daniele Ganser wrote NATO's Secret Armies, a 2004 book that alleged direct NATO support for far-right terrorists in Italy as part of its \\"strategy of tension\\". , December 29, 2006, on Voltaire network's website : \\"It is a tactic which consists in committing bombings and attributing them to others. By the term 'tension' one refers to emotional tension, to what creates a sentiment of fear. By the term 'strategy' one refers to what feeds the fear of the people towards one particular group\\". Ganser also alleges that Operation Gladio, an effort to organize stay-behind guerillas and resistance in the event of a communist takeover by the Eastern bloc of Italy, continued into the 1970s and supplied the far-right neofascist movements with weapons. Ganser's conclusions have been disputed;Olav Riste and Leopoldo Nuti, \\"Introduction: Strategy of 'Stay- Behind',\\" The Journal of Strategic Studies, December 2007, 930. most notably, Ganser heavily cites the document US Army Field Manual 30-31B, which the US state department claims is a 1976 Soviet hoax meant to discredit the US. == See also == * False flag == References == ==External links== * The Strategy of Tension on libcom.org Category:Cold War terminology Category:Years of Lead (Italy) Category:Italian neo-fascism Category:Terrorism in Italy Category:Military strategy Category:Politics of Italy Category:Propaganda Due Category:American influence in post–World War II Europe Category:Neo-fascist terrorism Category:Psychological warfare techniques Category:Public opinion Category:Revolutionary tactics Category:Disinformation operations ","title":"Strategy of tension"},{"id":"2576415","text":"Wilhelm Gegenfurtner is a German Roman Catholic priest.

The series was set primarily in Utterley, a fictional Lancashire mining town in the 1930s, Brass satirized working-class period dramas of the 1970s, most significantly When the Boat Comes In. Unusually for ITV comedies of the time, Brass eschewed a laugh track and utilized a dry sense of humour based in part on convoluted wordplay and subtle commentary on popular culture. The series also parodied the 1977 Granada TV dramatisation of Dickens' Hard Times, which also starred Timothy West. ==Story and characters== The series, created by John Stevenson and Julian Roach, was set around two feuding families—the wealthy Hardacres and the poor, working- class Fairchilds—who lived in a small terraced house rented from the Hardacre empire. The Hardacre family was headed by the ruthless self-made businessman Bradley Hardacre (Timothy West) and his glamorous, alcoholic aristocratic wife Lady Patience (Caroline Blakiston). Bradley spouted Thatcherite rhetoric, while coming up with harebrained schemes to make his businesses more efficient so he could sack workers. The head of the Fairchilds was the stern \\"Red\\" Agnes (Barbara Ewing), who spread militant socialist rhetoric around the Hardacre mine, mill and munitions factory and her doltish, forelock-tugging husband George (Geoffrey Hinsliff; Geoffrey Hutchings in the 1990 series), who is dominated by his wife and his boss. In a twist, Agnes was also Bradley Hardacre's mistress. Other characters in the series were the children of the families. The Fairchilds had two sons—Jack (Shaun Scott), a defiant miner and Matthew (Gary Cady), a sensitive clerk who wrote very poor verse. The Hardacre children were Bentley (deceased; his memorial stone is featured in the first episode), glamorous, nymphomaniac Isobel (Gail Harrison), innocent budding feminist Charlotte (Emily Morgan), ambitious heir to the Hardacre empire Austin (Robert Reynolds) (Patrick Pearson in the 1990 series) and Morris (James Saxon), a gay Cambridge student with a fondness for teddy bears (c.f. Sebastian in Brideshead Revisited). Bentley, Austin and Morris are named after British car manufacturers; Jack and Matt were named after terms used in the game of bowls. Not only were Bradley and Agnes lovers, with Bradley being most likely the father of Matthew but Isobel and Jack were also lovers and afterwards it was revealed that Charlotte was not Bradley's daughter but the result of an affair between Lady Patience and the elderly Lord Mountfast, whom Isobel married. Charlotte married Matthew, to whom Morris Hardacre had at one time been attracted. To complicate matters even further Lady Patience also had a brief fling with Matthew Fairchild. Despite his wealth and social connections, Bradley had been brought up in the Utterley Cottage workhouse and had made his money himself, obviously not legally or fairly. Apart from the Hardacres and the Fairchilds the most significant other character was the Scottish idealist, Dr McDuff, played by David Ashton and satirising Dr Finlay of Dr Finlay's Casebook. ==Series history== Brass ran for two series on ITV, shown between 1982 and 1984 but was brought back for a third series in 1990 on Channel 4, set in 1939. The third series saw the Hardacres move to London and later to a country mansion called Yonderley but making frequent trips to Utterley or Swarfside, where the Hardacre business empire was still based. The Fairchilds had also moved to London as Agnes was now MP for Utterley. ==Filming== Some scenes are set at Croydon Airport but were filmed at Barton Airport, whose distinctive control tower appears in the film. Some of the opening scenes are of Thorn Street in Summerseat, Bury. Greater Manchester. ==Availability on video== The series is available on DVD in the United Kingdom. ==External links== * Category:1980s British comedy-drama television series Category:1990s British comedy-drama television series Category:Channel 4 original programming Category:ITV sitcoms Category:Period television series Category:Television shows produced by Granada Television Category:English- language television shows ","title":"Brass (TV series)"},{"id":"2576432","text":"Sir James Melville (1535–1617) was a Scottish diplomat and memoir writer, and father of the poet Elizabeth Melville. ==Life== The vault of Sir James Melville in the Collessie churchyard, Fife. Melville was the third son of Sir John Melville, laird of Raith in the county of Fife, who was executed for treason in 1548. One of his brothers was Robert, 1st Baron Melville of Monimail (1527–1621). James Melville in 1549 went to France to become page to Mary, Queen of Scots. Serving on the French side at the Battle of St. Quentin in 1557 Melville was wounded and taken prisoner. He subsequently carried out a number of diplomatic missions for Henry II of France. On Mary's return to Scotland in 1561 she gave Melville a pension and an appointment in her household, and she employed him as special emissary to reconcile Queen Elizabeth to her marriage with Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. In June 1566 he attended Mary in Edinburgh Castle, and when Mary Beaton told him of the birth of Prince James, he rode to London with the news.Thomas Thomson, James Melville Memoirs of his own life (Edinburgh, 1827), p. 158. After the murder of Darnley in February 1567, Melville joined Lord Herries in boldly warning Mary of the danger and disgrace of her projected marriage with Bothwell, and was only saved from the latter's vengeance in consequence by the courageous resolution of the queen. During the troubled times following Mary's imprisonment and abdication Melville conducted several diplomatic missions of importance, and won the confidence of James VI when the king took the government into his own hands. Richard Douglas met him at Falkland Palace in 1588 and mentioned that his uncle Archibald Douglas was sending him a pair of virginals from London, for the education of his daughter, Elizabeth Melville.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 3 (London, 1889), p. 398: HMC Salisbury Hatfield: Addenda, vol. 13 (London, 1915), p. 395 Melville was knighted at the coronation of Anne of Denmark on 17 May 1590.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1589-1593, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 300.

Cameron, Calendar of State Papers: 1593-1595, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 697. Having been adopted as his heir by the reformer Henry Balnaves, he inherited from him, at his death in 1579, the estate of Halhill in Fife; and he retired there in 1603, refusing the request of James to accompany him to London on his accession to the English throne. By his wife, Christina Boswell, he had one son and two daughters; the elder of these, Elizabeth Melville, who married John Colville, de jure 3rd Baron Colville of Culross, has been identified with the author of a poem published in 1603, entitled Ane Godlie Dreame. Sir James Melville died at Halhill on the 13 November 1617. He was buried in Collessie churchyard. ==Marriage and children== In 1569 Melville married Christian Boswell (d. 1609), a daughter of David Boswell of Balmuto in Fife.David Laing, The Works of John Knox, vol. 3 (Wodrow Society: Edinburgh, 1846–64), p. 416: National Records of Scotland, RD1/9, f.444v Her father was said to have been a devout Catholic who welcomed a visit of Mary, Queen of Scots as an opportunity for his seven sons to hear mass said in their home.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1563-1569, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), p. 138.

It is a story about a Londoner and his pet otter living on the Scottish coast. The story is fictional, but is adapted from the 1960 autobiographical book of the same name by Gavin Maxwell. Paperback reissue: (1984) . It featured the stars of Born Free, another film about a close relationship between humans and a wild animal. ==Plot== Graham Merrill (Bill Travers) passes a pet shop on his daily walks about London, and takes an interest in an otter (specifically, a male river otter) he sees in its window; eventually, he buys the animal and names him Mijbil or \\"Mij\\" for short. The otter wreaks havoc in his small apartment, and together they leave London for a rustic cottage overlooking the sea on the west coast of Scotland. There they live as beachcombers, and make the acquaintance of Dr. Mary (Virginia McKenna) from the nearby village, and her dog Johnny. Mij and Johnny play in the water and bound across the fields together. One episode involves Graham, trying to find live eels for Mij, which is very difficult, because during the winter, the eels swim in deeper waters, making it tough to fish them out. Also, no fish place on town carried live eels either. Mij's inquisitive and adventurous nature leads him some distance from the cottage to a female otter with whom he spends the day. Ignorant of danger, he is caught in a net and nearly killed. The humans find him and help him recover. Graham spends a significant amount of time drawing Mij, but realises that to show the true agility of the otter he must draw it underwater. He builds a large tank out of old windows so that he can do this. Not long after, Merrill goes to London to look after some affairs and leaves Mary in charge of Mij. While being exercised afield, Mij is killed by a ditchdigger, who did not realize he was a pet. Merrill returns and is crushed to discover the death of his beloved otter. Some time later, Merrill and Mary are surprised by a trio of otter youngsters, accompanied by their mother otter, approaching the cottage. He happily realizes they are Mij's mate and their children who have come to play in their father's swimming pool. Graham has been trying for years to write a novel about the Marsh Arabs; however, after seeing the baby otters playing, he takes pen and paper and begins to write about Mij and what the otter has taught him about himself. ==Cast and characters== * Bill Travers as Graham Merrill * Virginia McKenna as Mary MacKenzie * Peter Jeffrey as Colin Wilcox * Jameson Clark as Storekeeper * Helena Gloag as Mrs. Flora Elrich * W.

York was born enslaved, the son of Old York and Rose who were the slaves of John Clark III, William Clark's father. York was William Clark's lifelong body servant willed to him by his father on July 24, 1799. York was a few years younger than Clark but very large and naturally strong. After experiencing an unprecedented amount of freedom on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, York had trouble adjusting back to the life of a slave. After requesting William Clark for his freedom upon the completion of the expedition, William Clark declined multiple times which led him to become agitated with York and eventually hired him out for work in Louisville, Kentucky. According to Washington Irving, William Clark told Irving he had freed York and given him six horses and a large wagon to start a drayage business driving between Nashville and Richmond. There are conflicting reports on York's death but most historians believe he died from cholera on his way back to William Clark in St. Louis. ==Early life== York was born in Caroline County near Ladysmith, Virginia. He and several members of his family were owned by the Clark family. The will of John Clark III (father of George Rogers and William Clark) states*William English, Conquest of the Country Northwest of the River Ohio, 1778–1783, and Life of Gen. George Rogers Clark. Indianapolis: Bowen-Merrill, 1896, p. 49.: > I give and bequeath to my son Edmund... three negroes, to wit Peter (Vegas > child), and Scipio and Darathy (Rose's children)... I give and bequeath to > my son William... one negro man named York, also old York and his wife Rose, > and their two children, Nancy and Juba; also three old negroes, Tame, Cupid > and Harry. The most plausible family tree based on this description and others is that York was the son of Old York, not by Rose, that Scipio (also spelled Sippo, Seppo, Sep, and Pipo, likely named the same as the Roman general Scipio Africanus) and Daphny (also spelled Dafney, Daphney, and Daphne) were Rose's children not by Old York, and that Nancy and Juba were Old York and Rose's biological children.Dear Brother: Letters of William Clark to Jonathan Clark James J. Holmberg, Yale University Press, 2002 This would make Scipio, Daphney, Juba, and Nancy the half-siblings of York. William Clark called York his \\"playmate\\". York was left to William in his father's will.*William English, Conquest of the Country Northwest of the River Ohio, 1778–1783, and Life of Gen. George Rogers Clark. Indianapolis: Bowen-Merrill, 1896, p. 49. He had a fiancée whom he rarely saw and likely lost contact with her after 1811 when she was sold/sent to Mississippi. It is not known if York fathered any children. ==Lewis and Clark Expedition== During the expedition William Clark only mentioned York three times in journal he kept. York is first mentioned in Clark's journal on December 26th 1803, Clark mentions that York and corporal White House had been working with the whipsaws indicating that he was already working with the other men on the expedition. Clark mentions York again in his journal on June 5th 1804, noting that York had swum to a sand bar from the Keelboat in order to collect some greens for dinner. The majority of the men on the expedition could not swim. At least two men on the expedition including Captain Clark mentioned that on June 20th, York almost lost his eye during a playful altercation when he had sand thrown at him. York was mentioned again in Captain Clark's journal after a small party including York had descended the Spirit Mound Historic Prairie, Clark notes that \\"York was nearly exhausted by the heat, thirst and fatigue. Captain Clark said this is because York is too fat and unaccustomed to walk so fast\\". On September 19th it's noted that while on a hunting party York had killed an elk , there is no record of York having training with a weapon which was not allowed for slaves at that time. Once the party reached the Arikara villages they were fascinated with York since they had never seen a black man before. The natives called him \\"Big Medicine\\", which translates to something that cannot be explained. York would play with the children of the villages and tell them that he was previously a wild animal that was tamed by Captain Clark and that he thought children were very good to eat. While playing these games with the children, he would show them how strong he was and roar at them. The men and women of the villages adored York as well. On October 12th, 1804, it is noted that an Arikara welcomed York to his lodge, where the native man's wife was waiting. The Arikara man stood guard outside for some time in order to permit no interruption of their business. \\"Their women are very fond of caressing our men, and are much pleased with York. He had fun terrifying the children who constantly follow him,\\" October 15th 1804. York was not pleased with all the attention he received though. During a meeting with a Hidatsa chief named Le Borge, York became very angry and pulled a knife on the chief after he had tried to rub York's skin, thinking it was paint. On November 18th 1805, York accompanied Captain Clark to the tree at Cape Disappointment State Park, Washington where Clark added to Lewis's name carved in the tree \\" By Land from the U. States in 1804 & 1805\\". York had become the first black man to reach the Pacific Ocean when he walks nineteen miles from their camp with Captain Clark. Sometime as well in late November, York was allowed to cast a vote on a decision pertaining to the expedition, making him the first black man known to have voted west of the Mississippi. All the men of the expedition were paid according to rank $5 to $30 per month and granted 320 acres for each enlisted men, except for York. Historian Robert Betts says that the freedom York had during the Lewis and Clark expedition made resuming enslavement unbearable. page citation needed After the expedition returned to the United States, every other member received money and land for their services. York asked Clark for his freedom based upon his good services during the expedition. According to one account discussed below, Clark eventually gave him his freedom. \\"It is shown that York had gained a little freedom while on the expedition with Lewis and Clark. It is mentioned in journals that York went on scouting trips and going to trade with villages, experiencing freedom while doing that. Clark named two geographic discoveries after him; York's Eight Islands and York's Dry Creek, indicating that Clark may have respected him. When a poll was taken to decide where the group should stay over one winter, York's vote was recorded. He was also able to swim, unlike some of the men who were with them on their expedition.http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.dunnlib.simpson.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=5&sid;=3a67c719-8ccf-433b-9715-3faa4c9eeeef%40sessionmgr113&hid;=101&bdata;=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVybCx1aWQsY29va2llJnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=a9h&AN;=6902662 ==Later years== As to York's later life and death, Washington Irving was told by William Clark in 1832 that Clark had freed York, but that York regretted being free because he was a failure at business, and died trying to get back to serve his master as a slave again in St. Louis. Some modern historians doubt the credibility of Clark's story because it reflects pro-slavery arguments that Africans were happy to be slaves, and could not lead successful lives as free people.York of the Corps of Discovery: Interpretations of York's Character and His Role in the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Darrell Millner, Oregon Historical Quarterly, Fall 2003, pg 10, 13-4, 57. Others hold out the possibility that, as Clark's childhood playmate and long-time companion, the two men possessed a measure of friendship and mutual respect that was atypical for the time.From Sea to Shining Sea. James Alexander Thom, Ballantine Books, 2010. However, manumission laws and practices of the era often required freed slaves to leave the area, and their family and friends. Another account has led to speculation that York returned west and lived among the Indians. This speculation seems to be based on the account by Zenas Leonard who reported meeting with an African man living among the Crows in north-central Wyoming in 1834, writing: > In this village we found a negro man, who informed us that he first came to > this country with Lewis & Clark—with whom he also returned to the State of > Missouri, and in a few years returned again with a Mr. Mackinney, a trader > on the Missouri river, and has remained here ever since—which is about ten > or twelve years. He has acquired a correct knowledge of their manner of > living, and speaks their language fluently. He has rose [sic] to be quite a > considerable character, or chief, in their village; at least he assumes all > the dignities of a chief, for he has four wives, with whom he lives > alternately. However, the black man who lived among the Crow was most likely the well-known African American Mountain Man, Edward Rose (c.1780-c.1833). Though Leonard's account of this unnamed man came after the reported deaths of both Rose and York. York had experienced freedom on his adventures with Lewis and Clark. He was part of the team, and he contributed just like the rest with hunting, fishing, putting up tents etc. He had crossed rivers and mountains on the expedition and had a taste of what true freedom is like. On the expedition he felt like a free man, but when he returned east he was a slave again. Relations between Clark and York deteriorated and in 1809 was removed from the position of body servant and hired out to a farm owner by the name of Young. It is unclear if he was hired out in such a way as a punishment, Young being notorious for abusing his slaves, or so that York could be closer to his wife, who lived in the region. {{Cite web  url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/york- after-the-lewis-and-clark-expedition.htm  title=York After the Lewis and Clark Expedition} In the PBS series Lewis & Clark: The Journey of the Corps of Discovery, director Ken Burns states that York continued to work for Clark as a slave after the expedition. York asked for his freedom and at first Clark refused but did send him to Kentucky so he could be closer to his wife. Ten years after the expedition Clark granted York his freedom and York worked in the freighting business in Tennessee and Kentucky. In 1832, York died from cholera. ==Legacy== There is no doubt that York played a vital role while reading through the journals written during the expedition. Not only did he fulfill his duties as a laborer along the expedition, the journals also suggest that the color of York's skin intrigued the Native tribes so much they seemingly gave the expedition a pass through the land as well as commencing with trade. The journals also suggest that York had gained the respect of many of the men who were part of the expedition as well. ===Popular culture=== In 1999 Kentucky actor and writer Hasan Davis evoked York through the Kentucky Humanities Council's Chautauqua Living History program. As the Bicentennial Commemoration of the Lewis and Clark Expedition neared, Davis was invited to share York's story along the trail and across the nation as part of the national retelling of the expedition and its impact on the nation, native communities, and future generations. In 2019 Davis' book The Journey of York: Unsung Hero of the Lewis and Clark Expedition was released by Capstone Publishing. Kentucky poet Frank X. Walker has written two books of poetry about York: Buffalo Dance: The Journey of York (2004), and When Winter Come: the Ascension of York (2008). Both books were published by the University of Kentucky Press. In his novel Little Big Man, Thomas Berger mentions York as having likely been the father of some dark-skinned Indians. The opera York (composer Bruce Trinkley and librettist Jason Charnesky), based on York's life, was composed for the first international conference on the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial and performed at Penn State Opera Theatre. The play York was created by actor and African drummer David Casteal and playwright Bryan Harnetiaux, and premiered at Spokane Civic theatre on April 29, 2005, as directed by Susan Hardie and performed by David Casteal, (with performances in New York City in July 2006). In commemoration of Black History Month, the play was again presented on February 27–28, 2016 with David Casteal returning in the lead role as York in a one-man performance. ===Honors=== A statue of York, by sculptor Ed Hamilton, with plaques commemorating the Lewis and Clark Expedition and his participation in it, stands at Louisville's Riverfront Plaza/Belvedere, next to the wharf on the Ohio River. Another statue of York stands on the campus of Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Oregon. Dedicated on May 8, 2010, it does not focus on York's face, since no images of York are known to exist. Instead, it features fragments of William Clark's maps \\"scarred\\" on the statue's back. NW York Street in Portland also commemorates the explorer.

A committed Pagan, Radagaisus evidently planned to sacrifice the Senators of the Christian Roman Empire to the gods, and to burn Rome to the ground.Orosius called Radagaisus a \\"Scythian and a pagan\\" (paganus et Scytha) (VII.37.4). Radagaisus was executed after being defeated by the half-Vandal general Stilicho. 12,000 of his higher-status fighters were drafted into the Roman army and some of the remaining followers were dispersed, while so many of the others were sold into slavery that the slave market briefly collapsed. These Goths later joined Alaric I in his conquest of Rome in 410.Wolfram 1988:171 ==Invasion== Radagaisus's force probably consisted of about 20,000 fighting men.Heather, p. 198 Many of the fighters were accompanied by their families and other noncombatants, meaning that the total size of Radagaisus's group may have approached 100,000. Radagaisus, whose early career and ultimate origins are unknown, fleeing Hunnic pressures, invaded Italy without passing through the Balkans, which indicates that his invasion began somewhere on the Great Hungarian Plain, west of the Carpathian Mountains. Archaeological finds of coin hoards, buried by residents who were apparently aware of Radagaisus's approach, suggest that his route passed through southeastern Noricum and western Pannonia. About this time Flavia Solva was burned out and largely abandoned and AguntumWilhelm Alzinger, \\"Das Municipium Claudium Aguntum\\", Aufstieg und Niedergang der Römischen Welt: Principat II:6 (Berlin, 1977:403), noted in Wolfram 1988:169 note 328. was devastated by fire. An indeterminate number of refugees fled ahead of his army as it marched over the Alps. It was said by contemporaries that Arian Christians swelled his forces.Wolfram :169. The Western Roman Empire under Stilicho mobilized thirty numeri (about 15,000 men) from the Italian field army in response to Radagaisus's invasion.Heather, p. 205 A second contingent of Roman troops, possibly recalled from the Rhine frontier, complemented the Italian forces. In addition, they received help from Gothic foederati under Sarus and Hunnic forces under Uldin. Alaric I remained inactive through the whole episode, committed by treaty to Illyricum.Wolfram 1988:169, notes that Orosius placed them face to face and Isidore of Seville followed him.. Radagaisus's army had the run of northern Italy for at least six months while the Empire mobilized its forces. They eventually made their way to the bridgehead community of Florentia. They blockaded the city, where no less than a third of the Goth's troops and allies were killed. ==Capture, death, and aftermath== Stilicho's army relieved the siege of Florentia as the city was approaching the point of surrender. The Roman counterattack was extremely successful, and Radagaisus was forced to retreat into the hills of Fiesole, about 8 km away. There, Radagaisus abandoned his followers and tried to escape, but was captured by the Romans. Historian Peter Heather hypothesizes that Radagaisus's escape attempt may have been compelled by a revolt within his forces.Heather, p. 206 He was executed on 23 August 406.L.

Mostaert, Meester van d'Oultremont, Master of Oultremont, Jehan Masturd, Jan Mostertsoen (c. 1475 – 1552/1553) was a Dutch Renaissance painter who is known mainly for his religious subjects and portraits. One of his most famous creations was the Landscape with an Episode from the Conquest of America. He was appointed 'painctre aux honneurs' (painter with honors) by Margaret of Austria, the governor of the Habsburg Netherlands but did not become the court painter of Margaret.J.P. Filedt Kok, 'Jan Jansz Mostaert, Portrait of an African Man, c. 1525 - c. 1530', in J.P. Filedt Kok (ed.), Early Netherlandish Paintings, online coll. cat. Amsterdam 2010: hdl.handle.net/10934/RM0001.COLLECT.431086 (accessed 30 March 2019). ==Life== There are very few details about the life of Jan Mostaert that are known with any certainty. The traditional account of his life was based on the biography written by the 16th century Flemish artist and art historian Karel van Mander and included in his Schilder-boeck, published in Haarlem in 1604. Modern scholarship questions many of the assertions about the life of Mostaert made by Karel van Mander. St. Christopher, Museum Mayer van den Bergh Mostaert was born in Haarlem as the son of a mill owner also named Jan and Alijt Dircx. Karel van Mander stated that Mostaert was a pupil of Jacob van Haarlem, the artist who painted the altarpiece of the Carrier's guild in the St. Bavochurch of Haarlem.Jan Mostaert in Karel van Mander's Schilder-boeck, 1604 Mostaert's name first appeared in city records in 1498, the year he bought a house in his birthplace. The artist is documented in Haarlem almost every year from 1498 to 1552 except for a ten-year period between 1516 and 1526. In 1500 Mostaert was commissioned to paint the shutters for a receptacle housing the relics of Saint Bavo in the Groote Kerk, Haarlem. From this date he began to be listed in the records of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke, and continued to be frequently listed until 1549. He became deacon of the painters' guild in 1507, and again in 1543 and 1544. Lamentation, based on the same theme by Geertgen tot Sint Jans Margaret of Austria, the governor of the Habsburg Netherlands, appointed Mostaert 'painctre aux honneurs' (painter with honors) in March 1518. Van Mander wrote that he worked for Margaret for 18 years and was commissioned by her to create portraits. As there is no evidence that he was her court painter, there is no reason to trust Van Mander's statement that he worked at Margaret's court in Mechelen for 18 years. He is missing from the records in Haarlem for a string of only 10 years, and only two documents from 1519 and 1521 give any mention that he was working at her court at the time. The current view of art historians is that Mostaert worked his entire life in Haarlem. Since his house was rented to others in 1553 and payments to him stopped around Easter 1553, it is believed that he died early in 1553 or perhaps late in 1552. In 1554 his name was crossed out from the list of members of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke. Mostaert married Angnyese (Agnes) Martijnsdr, the widow of Claes Claesz Suycker, before 8 June 1498. His wife died before July 1532. Mostaert was commercially successful and owned multiple houses in Haarlem. Van Mander states that Mostaert had a son who was a common painter. It is no longer believed by art historians that Frans Mostaert and Gillis Mostaert were the grandsons of Jan Mostaert.Buyck Jean F., Gillis Mostaert - Christus door Pilatus aan het volk getoond at tento ==Works== Portrait of a Young Man Mostaert was principally a painter of portraits and religious subjects. He also had a fascination with primitive peoples and lands, as seen from his West Indies Landscape. At around 1520–25 he presented the family life of Adam and Eve in First Family as primitives working on their land. Mostaert was interested in combining pagan and Christian interpretations of humanity's origins. Mostaert's teacher Jacob van Haarlem may have actually been the anonymous Master of the Brunswick Diptych. Karel van Mander described several works in detail, including his strange landscape of the West Indies, which he considered to be an unfinished work. Much of Mostaert's work was destroyed in the great fire of Haarlem in 1576, and some paintings once attributed to him are now attributed to Adriaen Isenbrant. His earliest works are noticeably influenced by Geertgen tot Sint Jans, an earlier Haarlem artist. Some believed that Mostaert was actually apprenticed to Geertgen but it is doubtful that the artist had any apprentices or workshop assistants during his career. From Geertgen, Mostaert adopted a refined style and thoughtful compositions for his works, as well as the stiff, angular look of his figures. The banishment of Hagar and Ishmael Between 1510 and 1516 Mostaert developed a delicate style where his doll-like figures inhabited bright, blue-skied landscapes, as for example in his Adoration of the Magi (c. 1520–25, Rijksmuseum). His refined brushwork is precise, with an almost religious attention to detail. Also of note is the landscape, which demonstrates his leanings towards more romantic views with expansive hills. During the 1520s Mostaert was also influenced by Joachim Patinir's take on landscapes. Mostaert's St. Christopher, a painting with a landscape that features a river receding into an expansive and hilly background, was once even attributed to Patinir. Mostaert's portrait work of this earlier period includes a piece entitled Portrait of Abel van den Coulster (c. 1500–10), in which an elegant, thin-faced man is situated in equally elegant surroundings. This painting also contains one of Mostaert's favorite themes, i.e. the Vision of Augustus and the Tiburtine Sibyl. The scene appears in the courtyard in the background of the Portrait of Abel van den Coulster. Another version can be seen in the grisaille reliefs on the pillar and architrave of the gate in his Adoration of the Magi (c. 1520–25, Rijksmuseum).J.P. Filedt Kok, 'Jan Jansz Mostaert, The Adoration of the Magi, c. 1520 - c. 1525', in J.P. Filedt Kok (ed.), Early Netherlandish Paintings, online coll. cat. Amsterdam 2010: hdl.handle.net/10934/RM0001.COLLECT.4657 (accessed 30 March 2019). Mostaert was known for copying original portraits for some of his courtly commissions but, as is the case with the Portrait of Abel, he also painted figures from life and added aristocratic touches. He was known for presenting his portrait sitters in three-quarter-length and placing their hands on cushions. Being an accomplished court painter allowed for Mostaert to make a living off his art and to gain a steady patronage. The last documented reference to him is in 1549 when he petitioned the Haarlem town council for permission to live in Hoorn so that he could complete an altarpiece there. As was common practice in 15th and 16th century Netherlands, Mostaert frequently reproduced portraits of political figures based on original models. In 1521, Mostaert gave Margaret a portrait of her third husband, Duke Philibert of Savoy, as a New Year's present. The portrait was made sixteen years after Duke Philibert's death. ==Portrait of an African Man== Portrait of an African Man Mostaert painted The Portrait of an African Man , which is one of the earliest and the only individual portrait of a black African that has survived. Painted around 1525–30 the work is in the collection of the Rijksmuseum. It is not known exactly who this man was but there are indications that he was either associated with Margaret's court or was an attendant of her nephew, Charles V, who had a black archer, Christophle le More, among his bodyguards. The man wears rich clothes, gloves, and holds a sword, all indicative of his important status. The insignia on his hat and bag allude to possible Spanish or Portuguese origins. Many of the Africans who arrived in Europe in late medieval and early Renaissance times were scholars and advisers. ==West Indies Landscape== Mostaert's most famous work is the West Indies Landscape (c. 1535, Rijksmuseum), which is believed to be a view of the Zuni pueblos in New Mexico. Having never travelled to the Americas, Mostaert had to imagine what the New World looked like. There was speculation that the artist may have seen sketches of the landscapes but this is unlikely since most pictorial documentation of the times was of exotic animals, tools or costumes, rather than panoramic views. Also, the fanciful cliffs seem to be influenced by Patinir's landscape style rather than authentic renderings. It is believed that Mostaert created the painting based on either written or oral accounts of the newly discovered area to which he would have been privy thanks to his contacts at the court of Margaret of Austria, the aunt of Charles V. Although the narrative in the painting was thought to depict a number of different events, including Columbus on the island of Guanaja, Hernán Cortés in Mexico, and the Portuguese invasion of Brazil, it is actually the story of Coronado's search for the Seven Cities of Gold in the Zuni village of Cibola in New Mexico and Arizona in 1540–42. The best evidence that the picture is based on Coronado's story can be found on the right side of the painting, by the base of the cliffs. On his travels, Coronado was stoned at the entrance to the village by the native Indians. He was rescued by two of his officers who came to his aid and warded off the incoming Indians. Mostaert may have added the event to the landscape to lend it a measure of credibility. The landscape's terrain, as well as the look of the natives, also matches the descriptions of Pedro de Castañeda, a member of Coronado's team, made during his travels. According to him, the land was full of cliffs, some with ladders on them reaching to different levels, the people were tall and naked, and their huts were built into the ground and made of straw, the roofs protruding from the ground. Mostaert devotes only a small section of the painting to Coronado and his men, showing us instead the unity and strength of the native peoples fighting for their land. The painting is one of the earliest depictions of the Europeans' invasions of the Americas and of the \\"noble savage.\\" ==References== == External links == * Category:1470s births Category:1553 deaths Category:15th-century painters Category:16th-century Dutch painters Category:Early Netherlandish painters Category:Artists from Haarlem Category:Dutch Renaissance painters Category:Members of the Haarlem Guild of Saint Luke ","title":"Jan Mostaert"},{"id":"2576513","text":"A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z __NOTOC__ Poets are listed alphabetically by surname (or by widely known name, such as a pen name, with multiple names for the same poet listed separately if both are notable).

The opening stage of the Russo-Japanese War began with a pre-emptive strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy against the Russian Pacific Fleet spread among Port Arthur, Vladivostok, and Chemulpo Bay (now part of Incheon, Korea). Command of the Chemulpo operation was given to Rear Admiral Uryū Sotokichi, with six cruisers, three to eight torpedo boats (depending on sources), the aviso (dispatch boat) Chihaya, three transports and 2,500 ground troops. Chemulpo also had strategic significance, as it was the main port for the Korean capital of Seoul, and was also the main invasion route used previously by Japanese forces in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894. However, Chemulpo, with its wide tidal bore, extensive mudflats, and narrow, winding channels, posed a number of tactical challenges for both attackers and defenders. The Japanese protected cruiser had been based at Chemulpo for the past 10 months, and had been keeping watch on the Russian protected cruiser and the aging gunboat , also based at Chemulpo to look after Russian interests. After the Russian transport Sungari arrived at Chemulpo on 7 February 1904, reporting the sighting of a large Japanese force approaching, the gunboat Korietz was ordered to Port Arthur to report and request instructions. In the early morning of 8 February, Korietz spotted Chiyoda outside the Chemulpo roadstead, and mistaking it for a fellow Russian ship, loaded its guns for a salute. On closing in, the crew of Korietz realized their mistake and in the ensuing confusion the guns were discharged. Chiyoda responded by launching a torpedo. Both sides missed, but this was the first actual exchange of fire in the Russo-Japanese War, and it is highly unclear which side actually opened fire first. Korietz retreated back to Chemulpo harbor. Later in the morning of 8 February 1904, Chiyoda rendezvoused with Uryū's squadron outside the entrance to Chemulpo, and reported that several warships from neutral countries were present in the anchorage, including: (Great Britain), Pascal (France), and (Italy). An American warship—the gunboat —was also present, but she was further up the harbor. Uryū reasoned that if the Russians remained anchored in the midst of the neutral ships, they could not attack his transports, whereas if the Russians came out to do battle, he had ample force to deal with them. On the other hand, it was against international law to attack the Russians while they were anchored in a neutral port. Uryū sent a message requesting that the captains of HMS Talbot, Pascal and Elba to shift their anchorage, promising that no attack should be delivered before 16:00. ==Battle== Postcard displaying the Battle of Chemulpo Bay Uryū ordered the cruisers Chiyoda, , and his torpedo boats to proceed up the channel with the troopships to commence the debarkation at once, while the cruisers , and were held in reserve. Three torpedo-boats took refuge near Niitaka far board. At 18:00 on 8 February, Japanese troopships anchored at Chemulpo, mooring next to the Russians, and disembarked four battalions of soldiers of the IJA 12th Division in an operation that continued into the night. To the amazement of the tense Japanese, the Russians aboard Varyag and Korietz took no action, but continued to air out bunting as if on parade. The troop disembarkation was complete by 03:00 on 9 February, and all Japanese warships and transports withdrew from the harbor except for the Chiyoda. The latter delivered a letter to Varyag and neutral vessels, including the British cruiser Talbot, the French cruiser Pascal, the Italian cruiser Elba, and the U.S. gunboat Vicksburg and collier . > HIS IMPERIAL JAPANESE MAJESTY'S SHIP NANIWA > Chemulpo Roadstead, February 8. 1904.

At noon, Captain Denis Bagly of Talbot came to Naniwa with a letter signed by all of the neutral captains except for the captain of Vicksburg, W.A. Marshall, declining the request to change anchorage, on the grounds that Chemulpo was a neutral port. Outgunned and outnumbered, and refusing advice from the neutral captains to surrender, at 11:00 on 9 February, Captain Vsevolod Rudnev of Varyag attempted to make a break for the open sea. Varyag crippled and burning in Chemulpo harbour The gunboat Korietz burns after having been scuttled Japanese marines landing on the Bay From the Varyag logbook: *11:10 All hands on deck on Varyag. *11:20 Cruiser goes to open sea, Korietz in 1 cable length (200 meters) behind.

Japanese torpedo-boats behind cruisers. *11:45 Varyag opens fire with port guns.Note that war correspondent Frederic William Unger wrote that \\"the first gun was fired at twenty minutes to twelve o'clock\\" and that \\"the Russians admitted that the Korietz fired the first shot, and said that it was accidental.\\" Russia and Japan, and a complete history of the War in the Far East (1904), pp. 367–368. *11:47 Asama opens fire with 8-inch gun; all Japanese squadron then open fire. *One of the first Japanese shells that hit cruiser, destroyed the port wing of front bridge, set fire in chart house and broke the fore shrouds. Junior navigating officer midshipman Count Alexey Nirod was killed, all personnel on range finding station #1 were killed or wounded. *Damaged 10.2\\" gun #3, all personnel killed or wounded, battery commander midshipman Gubonin was wounded, but refused to go away until he fall.

With other hits was nearly destroyed main battle top, destroyed range finding station #2, damaged guns #31 and #32, fire in lockers on accommodation deck (was put out lively). *12:05 After passing traverse of \\"Yo-dol-mi\\" island trunk with rudder drive was damaged. At the same time, Captain Rudnev was shell-shocked in head by fragments of another shell, hitting foremast. Staff-bugler and drummer, who stay astride him was deadly killed, helmsman petty officer Snegirev was badly wounded in back, and orderly of captain quartermaster Chibisov was lightly wounded too. Ship from now was steered from steering compartment, but orders were stiffed, so course permanently was corrected with engines. At strong current cruiser steered badly. *12:15 Willing to go out of fire range to repair as possible steering drive and put out fires in different places begin to turn with machines, as cruiser steered badly. Near Yo-dol-mi island engines on full back. *Cruiser was put in disadvantage position relatively to island when steering drive was broken with rudder at 15–20° on port side. *Distance to enemy shortens to 28–30 cable length, fire strengthens, hits increase. *Near the same time large caliber shell hit port side under water, water gushed into huge hole, stokehold #3 begins to full with water, which level raised up to furnaces. Chief Officer and chief boatswain placed patch under the hole, water was pumped all time, its level decreased continuously, but cruiser continue to listing at port side. *With shell passing through officer cabins, which were wrecked, deck was pierced and meal in provision berth was inflamed. Then cot netting at waist under the sick quarters was pierced, wherein fragments get into sick quarters, cots in netting catch fire, which was put out lively. Serious damage forced us to get out of fire range for a more long time, that is why we come to roadstead at full speed, firing with port and bow guns. *Throughout the battle with one shot of 10.2\\" gun #XII bow bridge of Asama cruiser was destroyed and put afire, Asama stop fire for some time. bow turret on her was apparently damaged, as it not fired up to the end of battle. *12:40 With cruiser approached the berth and Japanese fire become dangerous for neutral ships on roadstead, two cruiser pursuing us stop the fire and return to the rest of squadron out of Yo-dol-mi island. *12:45 Distance to the Japanese so increased, that our fire become ineffective, so we stop it. An early film, depicting a re-enactment of the Battle of Chemulpo Bay (Film produced in 1904 by alt=A film of a re-enactment of a naval battle, depicting Russians firing at a Japanese ship with a cannon Although the Russian logbook records damage to Asama, Japanese records indicate that she took no damage. Unable to break past the Japanese squadron by mid-afternoon, Korietz and the badly battered Varyag returned to Chemulpo harbor at 13:15, where both took refuge near the neutral warships. At 16:00, Korietz was scuttled by her crew by blowing up two powder-rooms. Fragments of the blown-up ship landed dangerously close to neutral vessels. Fearing a greater explosion with potential casualties, the captains of the neutral warships present urged Rudnev not to blow up Varyag in a similar manner. At 18:10, scuttled by her crew, Varyag rolled over on her port side and sank. Crewmen from Varyag were dispatched to the Russian transport Sungari, which had remained behind in the harbor during the battle, and set her on fire to prevent her from falling into Japanese hands. ==Outcome== The Battle of Chemulpo was a military victory for the Japanese. Russian casualties on the Varyag were heavy. All of Varyags twelve guns, all of her 12-pounders, and all of her 3-pounders were out of action, she took 5 serious hits at or below the waterline. Her upper works and ventilators were riddled, and her crew had put out at least five serious fires. Of her crew with a nominal strength of 580, 33 were killed and 97 wounded. Most serious cases among the Russian wounded were treated at the Red Cross hospital at Chemulpo. The Russian crews—except for the badly wounded—returned to Russia on neutral warships and were treated as heroes. Although severely damaged, Varyag—not blown up—was later raised by the Japanese and incorporated into the Imperial Japanese Navy as the training ship . ==See also== *List of battles of the Russo-Japanese War ==References== ==Further reading== *Connaughton, Richard.

Fought on August 10, 1861, the battle was the first major American Civil War engagement west of the Mississippi River. In the battle, a Confederate army commanded by Benjamin McCulloch and Sterling Price defeated a smaller Union army commanded by Nathaniel Lyon. However, the Confederates were unable to hold much of Missouri, and a Confederate defeat at the Battle of Pea Ridge effectively solidified Union control of the state. Major features include a five-mile automobile tour loop, the restored 1852 Ray House, and \\"Bloody Hill,\\" the site of the final stage of the battle. The site is located near Republic in southwestern Missouri just southwest of the city of Springfield. It has been a unit of the National Park Service since 1960, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. ==Battle at Wilson's Creek== Battle of Wilson's Creek, by Kurz and Allison, 1893. In early 1861, President Abraham Lincoln issued a call for the state of Missouri to enlist four regiments to fight against the Confederate States of America. However, then-Missouri governor Claiborne F. Jackson refused to call and prepared to use the Missouri State Guard to seize a United States government arsenal in St. Louis, Missouri. In response, Union general Nathaniel Lyon moved aggressively against the pro-Confederate Guard, driving the force away from St. Louis and removing Jackson from official government leadership. The Missouri State Guard, now commanded by Sterling Price, fell back towards the city of Springfield in southwestern Missouri, followed by Lyon and his Union army. Meanwhile, Price had been reinforced by a small Confederate army under the command of Benjamin McCulloch. On August 10, Lyon decided to attack Price and McCulloch's combined forces while the Confederate were encamped along the banks of Wilson's Creek. Lyon split his outnumbered forces into wings commanded by himself and Col. Franz Sigel in order to attack the Confederate camp from both the front and the rear. Sigel's force was soon driven from the field, allowing Price and McCulloch to combine their forces against Lyon's column, which had taken position on Bloody Hill. Lyon was killed, and the Union forces retreated from the field. It was the first major military engagement in the American Civil War to take place west of the Mississippi river. After the battle, Price and McCulloch strongly disagreed over command issues. Price would move towards Kansas, fearing a counterstroke from Union troops there, leaving McCulloch with an army that soon dwindled after terms of enlistments expired and some of the remaining troops were reassigned elsewhere. Price followed up Wilson's Creek with a strike northwards towards the Missouri River, and was victorious at the Siege of Lexington. However, news that Union troops were marching to intercept his army led Price to retreat back towards Springfield. In March of the next year, Price and McCulloch would command wings of a Confederate army under the command of Earl Van Dorn at the Battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas. The Confederate army was defeated and McCulloch was killed. The defeat at Pea Ridge ended any serious Confederate chance of holding a position in Missouri. ==Park history== The battle site was established as Wilson's Creek National Battlefield Park on April 22, 1960, and was re-designated a National Battlefield on December 16, 1970. The battlefield was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. The official area of the park was expanded by 615 acres in 2004 in accordance with Public Law 108-394, and an additional 60 acres were added in 2018 after the land was purchased by the Civil War Trust. The park is located near Republic, Missouri, which is southwest of Springfield in Greene County, Missouri. (includes 3 photographs from 1969, 1975) The Civil War Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield, most of which has been sold to the National Park Service and incorporated into the park. In total, the park preserves 1,750 acres of the battlefield. ==Features== Wilson's Creek National Battlefield is open seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The visitor's center contains exhibits about the battle, a short film, fiber optic maps and a bookstore. The battlefield is accessed by a 5-mile long self-guided automobile-tour loop, which connects eight stops highlighting historically important facets of the battlefield. The tour loop also features hiking trails and a seven-mile long horseback riding trail. On August 10, the anniversary of the battle, the park hosts commemorative events.left The Ray House, which is still preserved on the battlefield, dates to before the Civil War, and was used as a field hospital following the battle. General Lyon's body was brought to the Ray House by Confederate soldiers after the Union army retreated from the field. The house is open for tours during limited hours over the summer. The tour loop also includes a stop at Bloody Hill, the site of heavy fighting during the battle, as well as the site of Lyon's death. The site of Lyon's death is marked with a monument, which was dedicated in 1928. Several cannons are also on display at Bloody Hill. The battlefield also includes several features besides those on the tour road. One of these is the John K. and Ruth Hulston Civil War Research Library, which was founded in 1985. The library contains over 12,000 books about the Civil War, with an emphasis on the Trans-Mississippi Theater. The library also has digital access to Civil War genealogical information and some regimental histories.

Virginia Lieutenant Governor Alexander Spotswood encouraged the immigration by advertising in Germany for miners to move to Virginia and establish a mining industry in the colony. ==Etymology== The name \\"Germanna\\", selected by Lt. Governor Alexander Spotswood, reflected both the German immigrants who sailed across the Atlantic to Virginia and the British Queen, Anne, who was in power at the time of the first settlement at Germanna. Though she was to die only months after the Germans arrived, her name continues to be a part of the area. ==History== As part of a series of land grants awarded to settlers to create a buffer against the French, the Privy Council granted Spotswood in the newly created Spotsylvania County in 1720, of which the Germanna tract was the first, while he was Lieutenant Governor and actual executive head of the Virginia government. He served in this capacity between 1710 and 1722 and, in 1716, he carried out his famous Knights of the Golden Horseshoe Expedition and promoted many reforms and improvements. Spotswood was replaced as the lieutenant governor by Hugh Drysdale some time in 1722. Historians suggest his removal may have been the result of years of disharmony between himself and the Council, as well as when he accepted such a large amount of land, that he showed a disregard for the Crown policy which held that no single person or family could claim more than a thousand acres of Virginia land. Spotswood established a colony of German immigrants on the Germanna tract in 1714, partly for frontier defense but mainly to operate his newly developed ironworks. Germanna was the seat of Spotsylvania County from 1720 to 1732. Spotswood erected a palatial home and, after the Germans moved away to Germantown, continued the ironworks with slave labor. In his later years he served as Deputy Postmaster General for the Colonies. The Germanna Colonies consist primarily of the First Colony of forty-two persons from the Siegerland area in Germany brought to Virginia to work for Spotswood in 1714, and the Second Colony of twenty families from the Palatinate, Baden and Württemberg area of Germany brought in 1717, but also include other German families who joined the first two colonies at later dates. Although many Germanna families later migrated southward and westward from Piedmont Virginia, genealogical evidence shows that many of the families intermarried for generations, producing a rich genealogical heritage. The site of the first settlement, Fort Germanna, is located in present-day Orange County along the banks of the Rapidan River, with subsequent settlements of Germans being established on sites in present-day Culpeper and Spotsylvania counties. Many Germanna families played roles in important events in early American history such as the American Revolution and migration west to Kentucky and beyond. ==Preservation== The site of Fort Germanna is mostly open fields with intervening thickets of second-growth timber. The Fort Germanna site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Traces of the terraces of Spotswood's mansion which came to be known as the \\"Enchanted Castle\\" are still discernible. The Germanna Foundation is conducting archaeological exploration of the Fort Germanna, Siegen Forest, and Salubria sites that it owns in Orange and Culpeper Counties. The Germanna Foundation owns land on the original Germanna peninsula, on both sides of the Germanna Highway, State Route 3, near the site of the original Fort Germanna, once the westernmost outpost of colonial Virginia. The Germanna Foundation operates the Brawdus Martin Fort Germanna Visitor Center on the Siegen Forest side of the Germanna Highway, east of Culpeper and west of Fredericksburg, Virginia. The Foundation also owns a nearby 18th century mansion, Salubria, once the home of Governor Spotswood's widow. In October 2000, Salubria was donated by the Grayson family to the Germanna Foundation for historic preservation.Germanna Foundation website The Foundation maintains a research library, a memorial garden, and plans interpretive walking trails to various historic and archaeological sites. In addition, the Foundation publishes histories and genealogical books, a newsletter, offers educational programs at an Annual Historical Conference and Reunion and to the community, and offers group travel to Germany geared to the origin of the Germanna families. ==Timelines== ===First colony=== The first colony consisted of the family surnames: Albrecht, Brombach, Fischbach/Fishback, Friesenhagen, Hager, Heide/Heite/Hitt, Heimbach, Hoffman, Holtzklau/Holtzclaw, Huttman, Kemper/Camper, Cuntze/Koontz, Merdten/Martin, Otterbach/Utterback, Reinschmidt, Richter/Rector, Spielmann, Weber/Weaver http://germanna.org/things-to-do/research-your-germanna-roots/ *Late spring of 1713: the people left Nassau-Siegen, apparently not in a single group *Summer of 1713: the people arrived in London *January 1714: they left for Virginia on an unknown ship *Late March 1714: Spotswood first learns from Col.

Also during the year they made their commitment to buy land at \\"Germantown.\\" By December 1718, Spotswood says he spent about 60 pounds on the endeavor so there was no iron furnace. *January 1719: some moved to Germantown. Pastor Haeger may not have moved at this time. By this time they had completed the four years of service they committed themselves to live in London. ===Second colony=== *1717: Eighty-odd Germans from Wuerttemberg, Baden, and the Palatinate agree with Capt.

The ITS is an offshoot of Al-Muhajiroun, a pro Al-Qaeda British Islamic extremist group. According to Michael Kenney, a scholar of Islamist extremism at the University of Pittsburgh, by 2014 the group had \\"fallen apart.\\" ==Platform== The group states that it wishes to see a reversal of the Balfour Declaration, the Sykes- Picot Agreement and the San Remo conference. Its members allege that these agreements are part of 'Colonialist Designs' on the Islamic world, and they urge Muslims to consider them illegal, null and void. The group calls for an end to what it says are \\"Colonialist-Imposed Borders,\\" \\"Colonialist-Imposed States,\\" and \\"Colonialist-Imposed Rulers.\\" Its members also show dislike for Jews, Christians, homosexuals and Shi'ites. ITS calls on Muslims to oppose the United States, Christianity and Western society and culture, especially homosexuality, which it sees as Western. ITS is also notable for its hostility to Shi'ites whom its members view as not true Muslims. ==Controversy== ITS is suspected of being an American offshoot of the London-based Al-Muhajiroun, a group that celebrated the 9/11 attacks, referring to the hijackers as \\"the Magnificent 19,\\" and posted a burning picture of the United States Capitol on its website. The Islamic Thinkers Society also used to fly the Al-Muhajiroun flag and distribute Al-Muhajiroun tracts. The Anti-Defamation League called ITS \\"a pseudonym or an offshoot of the British-based Al Muhajiroun, a now- disbanded radical Islamic group that supported terrorism and the imposition of Islamic hegemony worldwide.\\" In the CNN program ParkerSpitzer, the ex-leader of Al-Muhajiroun, Anjem Choudary, was interviewed with the title \\"heinous terrorist\\" and linked to militant groups like Al-Qaeda. Choudary however, denounced these allegations in a press release on his personal website. The ITS has also published a press release in response to the CNN interview supporting Al-Muhajiroun's former leader Anjem Choudary, but denouncing links to violence in a similar fashion, stating \\"as the struggle [of ITS] is always intellectual and political.\\" When the group still called itself Al- Muhajiroun, its members held an event at Queensborough Community College, during which an Al-Muhajiroun speaker said, \\"We reject the U.N., reject America, reject all law and order. Don't lobby Congress or protest because we don't recognize Congress! The only relationship you should have with America is to topple it!\\" Observers such as the Intelligence Summit have called the Islamic Thinkers Society a Fundamentalist Islamic group. ==Activities== The group is based in the largely immigrant community of the Jackson Heights neighborhood in Queens, New York City but operates in the wider New York area. It is composed mainly of second-generation young Arab, Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani Muslim immigrants with a few converts.Elliott, Andrea. \\"Queens Muslim Group Says It Opposes Violence, and America.\\" The New York Times, June 22, 2005 pB1 ===2005=== *On March 19, 2005, the organization protested the intergender Muslim service held at Synod House of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.

Placards were displayed which equated Nazi and Israeli symbols; other signs were emblazoned with the symbol of the Hamas militant group, and proclaimed that \\"Palestine is Islamic Land,\\" \\"Allah Will Destroy the Terrorist State of Israel,\\" and \\"Complete Liberation of Palestine From the Zionist Scum.\\" One of the slogans shouted by the crowd in Arabic was the anti-Jewish slogan: \\"Khaibar, Khaibar ya Yahud, jaysh Muhammad sawfa ya'ud!\\" evoking the historical battle between the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the Jews of the Khaybar oasis. *On March 23, 2004 a rally to mourn the death of the militant leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the founder of the group Hamas was also held in front of the Israeli consulate. The leader of the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge, Imam Red Shata, who was quoted by the NY Daily News, publicly stated, \\"The lion of Palestine has been martyred.\\" In the same speech, he condemned all violence. he stated that \\"we don't hate Jews ...to kill one man is to kill all mankind.\\" *On June 8, 2005 the ITS publicly desecrated and ripped up an American flag on the street in New York City during a rally on 74th Street and 37th Avenue in the borough of Queens. This event, which its members called \\"Operation: Desecrate American Flag\\" was videotaped by the Islamic Thinkers Society and can be seen on the Internet. The group's five-minute video begins with a man speaking in English, \\"Just to show where our loyalty belongs to – you see this flag here? It's going to go on the floor [sic]. And to us, our loyalty does not belong to this flag, our loyalty belongs to Allah ... .\\" Another speaker refers to the mandate for \\"Islam to dominate over all other religions, to dominate the world, even though the non-Muslims may hate it.\\" *The negative reaction by the press led the organization to issue a statement on its website stating, \\"This flag also represents oppression, not only in the Muslim world, but also in other parts of the world which include but are not limited to South America, Vietnam, Japan & Africa. We would like to clarify that we DID NOT BURN THE FLAG as the rumors say. Rather, we stepped on it and ripped it. The video is evident of that.

It was distinguished with a bell tower (lookout or a clock tower). Unlike a regular city hall which may or may not have any specific architectural compositions, ratusz (rathaus) always consisted of a building with a tower. Ratusz was primarily designated as a city hall, traditionally built in the centre of a town or in the middle of a town square or more common market square (freedom of trade as the main goal of Magdeburg rights). Although the old ratusz can still maintain the function of a seat of local government, frequently it is separated from the contemporary city government, the administrative building housing the town council, and often serves as a museum of local history (for example in Ivano-Frankivsk and Tarnów among many others). ==History== Prominent examples of a historic ratusz can be found in at least 82 Polish cities. Some of them date back to the mid-13th century, like the ratusz in Kalisz.Janusz Rosikoń, Ratusze w Polsce Rosikon PressSzlakiem Rynków i Ratuszy w Polsce PTTKElżbieta Zagłoba-Zygler, 20 lat rajdu motorowego PTTK \\"Ratusze w Polsce\\" \\"Gosciniec\\" Polskiego Towarzystwa Turystyczno-Krajoznawczego, PTTK The oldest tower still standing was erected in 1274 in Toruń while the actual building with 365 windows comes from the 14th century.Douglas Stallings, Ratusz (town hall) in Toruń Fodor's Poland. Random House, 2007. . The ratusz in Zamość, built during the Renaissance in Poland, is one of the highest achievements of Renaissance architecture anywhere in the country. It was intentionally placed in the corner of the town square not to outshine the nearby Zamoyski Palace of the city's owners, which it did anyway, once the imposing Baroque staircase was added in the 17th century.Douglas Stallings, Ratusz (town hall) in Zamość Fodor's Poland, p. 238.

Random House, 2007. . Throughout the centuries many Polish town halls have been damaged in foreign invasions, such as the ratusz in Sandomierz, with city rights since 1286, meticulously renovated before being turned into a museum.Wykaz ratuszy z Polski (Compendium of Poland's ratuszes) History and photographs. JakTrafic.org. In the royal city of Kraków, the historic ratusz, built of brick and mortar in the centre of Main Square, originally in 1316, has been torn down not by the occupiers, but by the Cracovians themselves in 1820 because it was not considered pretty enough. What remains of it is the massive town-hall tower, a prominent example of Polish Gothic architecture.Kamil Janicki, Co się stało z krakowskim ratuszem? Ciekawostki turystyczne. A considerable number of heritage city halls became historical museums in the 20th century, including the ratusz in Toruń (Toruń Regional Museum or Muzeum Okręgowe in Polish), with stained glass and gingerbread divisions, in Poznań (Muzeum Okręgowe), with a Chopin division, in Lublin (Muzeum Okręgowe), Siedlce (Muzeum Okręgowe), Białystok (Muzeum Podlaskie), Gdańsk (Muzeum Historii Miasta), Sandomierz (Muzeum Okręgowe), and Szczecin (Muzeum Historii Miasta Szczecina). Others still serve as seats of local government, and sometimes also as civil wedding halls and art galleries, restaurants, and cultural centres. These include Zamość, Kielce, Zielona Góra (also a civil wedding hall, restaurant, and winery), Kętrzyn (also a wedding hall and cultural centre), and Kołobrzeg (also a wedding hall, cultural centre, and gallery of modern art). ==Etymology== The Polish word ratusz to describe a city hall is derived from the German Rathaus (council house) sometime during the Middle Ages. The influence also serves as a metonym for the burmistrz (burgomaster, or mayor), derived from the German bürgermeister. Since 1980, the Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society (PTTK) offers a badge for tourists interested in organizing group excursions across the country with the aim of visiting the maximum number of ratusz towns and cities. The PTTK hands out a special booklet where stamps can be collected for the gold badge awarded for visiting a minimum of twenty ratusz outlets. ==Prominent examples== File:Bielsko-Biała Town Hall.jpg Bielsko-Biała File:Chelmno ratusz 03.jpgChełmno File:PL Jawor Ratusz.JPG Jawor File:PL Kalisz Ratusz..JPG Kalisz File:Kłodzko - Ratusz.JPG Kłodzko File:Lublin Nowy Ratusz.jpg Lublin File:Ns ratusz.jpg Nowy Sącz File:Paczków - Town hall.jpg Paczków File:Ratusz2007.jpgPoznań File:Sandomierz Town Hall 20051004 1200.jpg Sandomierz File:Sulechów-ratusz.jpg Sulechów File:Jarosław Ratusz 2.JPGJarosław File:Toruń - Ratusz nocą.jpgToruń File:Zamosc Town Hall 01.jpg Zamość File:Ziebice-ratusz.jpg Ziębice File:Kolomiya town hall1.JPG Kolomyia File:Lwów - Ratusz.jpg Lviv File:Townhall ivano-frankivsk.jpg Ivano-Frankivsk File:HH Rathaus pano1.jpgCity hall in Hamburg (Rathaus) ==References== Category:Polish words and phrases Category:Gubernatorial titles Category:Architecture of Poland Category:Magdeburg rights ","title":"Ratusz"},{"id":"2576649","text":"Shacklewell Green, September 2005. An old village green encircled by modern London. Shacklewell was a hamlet that developed on Shacklewell Lane in the modern London Borough of Hackney. The settlement core is now often seen as being part of Dalston which was originally a separate hamlet 500 yards to the south and also part of the Ancient Parish of Hackney. Shacklewell took its name from \\"some springs or wells which were of high repute in former days, but the very site of which is now forgotten.\\" Shacklewell has never been an administrative unit, and partly for that reason its extent has only ever been nebulously understood. For a brief time its sphere of influence extended north and north-west beyond its village core but Shacklewell is now mostly forgotten as a place name in everyday use, though the historic street pattern of the original hamlet remains. ==History== The village was one of four small villages within the Parish of Hackney, (Dalston, Newington, Shacklewell, and Kingsland), which were all grouped for assessment purposes, together having only as many houses as the village of Hackney. The village of Shacklewell was settled on the eponymous village green,Hackney: Dalston and Kingsland Road, A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 10: Hackney (1995), pp. 28-33 accessed: 7 December 2007 along Shacklewell Lane.Hackney: Shacklewell, A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 10: Hackney (1995), pp. 35-38 accessed: 11 December 2007 Shacklewell lay a little over 500 yards north of the hamlet of Dalston, which stood on Dalston Lane, with which it was linked by Cecilia Road. Shacklewell had a manor house, which at one time was occupied by the Heron family. Cecilia More, the youngest daughter of Sir Thomas More, the Roman Catholic martyr, married into the family in 1525. The house was later occupied by the Tyssen family, who owned large parts of Hackney. The entrance to Shacklewell Washing Baths, September 2005. One municipal building still standing is the former Shacklewell Washing Baths. This was a communal bath and washhouse. Simple bathhouses like these were once of great importance. Even into the 1960s, in some working-class areas of London many dwellings did not have their own bathrooms. Largely residential in the mid-19th Century, the district gained some light industry later on, including Eyre & Spottiswoode's printworks and a saw mill. Although some industry remains, largely now in Turkish hands, Shacklewell has been superseded as a commercial centre by neighbouring Stoke Newington and Dalston. ==Growth and loss of sphere of identity== During the 19th century the area was urbanising and local identities were more fluid than today. For some of this period, Shacklewell was informally considered to extend north into West Hackney to include Rectory Road and the northern end of Amhurst Road. It also was seen to extend west of Stoke Newington Road to include the most southern part of Stoke Newington. That sphere of self-identification has been almost completely lost. It is no longer common for a Londoner to refer to themselves as living in Shacklewell, the only people to do so now living in the immediate vicinity of the village core, and these would normally also consider the area a part of Dalston. In its way the district is an illustration of the mutable nature of place names in the capital. The lack of a railway station using the name Shacklewell and the consequent omission of the name from railway maps of the capital will have contributed to the decline of the name. ==Electoral Ward== There is a Shacklewell electoral ward for Hackney Council, which, as electoral wards require roughly equal electorates, corresponds only very roughly to the area after which it is named. The post-2014 ward boundaries straddle Stoke Newington Road, with the village core and its immediate surroundings (now part of Dalston) to the east, while the area west of the road is the southernmost part of Stoke Newington ==Transport== The nearest London Overground station is the Dalston Kingsland railway station. ==Education== Primary schools in the area include Shacklewell School and Halley House, and the secondary school the Petchey Academy, located on the site of the former Kingsland Secondary School ==Entertainment== The Shacklewell Arms is a well known pub and live music venue. The pioneering dance music production duo Shut Up and Dance immortalized the Shacklewell Arms in its former life in their track The Green Man.Know Your History: Shacklewell Arms (The Green Man), Minimum Wastage, 6 July 2011 ==In popular culture== * In the book Career of Evil (2015) a murder in Shacklewell leads to the perpetrator being known as the \\"Shacklewell Ripper\\". ==Nearest places== * Dalston * Hackney Central * Stoke Newington * West Hackney ==References== Category:Districts of the London Borough of Hackney Category:Areas of London ","title":"Shacklewell"},{"id":"2576652","text":"Adeline Dutton Train Whitney (pen name, A. D. T. Whitney; September 15, 1824 – March 20, 1906) was an American poet and prolific writer, who published more than 20 books for girls. Her books expressed a traditional view of women's roles and were popular throughout her life. Her first venture was a Book of Rhymes. Then followed: Mother Goose for Grown Folks, Boys at Chequassett, Faith Gartney's Girlhood, Hitherto — a Story of Yesterday, Prince Strong's Outings, The Gayworthys, Leslie Goldthwaite, We Girls, Holy Tides, Real Folks, The Other Girls, Sights and Insights, Odd and Even, Bannyborough Whiten Memories, Daffodils, Pansies, Homespun Yarns, Ascutney Street, A Golden Gossip, Bird Talk, and Just How. ==Early life and education== Adeline Dutton Train was born in Boston, Massachusetts, September 15, 1824. She was the daughter of Enoch Train and Adeline Train (née Dutton). With his cousin, Samuel Train of Medford, Enoch did an extensive mercantile business, owning vessels, and trading to Russia and South America. In later years, he established his line of packet ships between Boston and Liverpool, thereafter known as the \\"Warren Line\\". George Francis Train, a founder of the Union Pacific Railroad, was her cousin. When she was thirteen, her mother presented Whitney with a complete set of the stories of Maria Edgeworth, and gave her unlimited permission to read them. The result was twofold: first, the girl was preserved from reading a great deal of ordinary writing, and secondly, her thoughts were formed and guided by their influence, so that ordinary writing became distasteful to her. Most of Whitney's more mature education was conducted in Boston. She was mainly the outcome of the culture, intellectual and moral, of that city. Like many other Boston girls, Whitney was educated in the school of George B. Emerson, from the age of thirteen through eighteen, from 1837 to 1842, with the exception of one year spent at Northampton, under the care of Margarette Dwight. Emerson was a Unitarian; Dwight was a Calvinist. In those days, there was an excited controversial division between the Unitarian and the Orthodox. Of this she said:— \\"After what has been said, incidentally, concerning alternating religious training and influences, I may suitably say that the result of all has been that I have recently connected myself with the church of the 'Apostles' Creed,' finding there the germ and foundation of all that has either broadened or narrowed from it; and am content to rest in that body which recognizes 'the blessed company of all faithful people,'—claiming the right to interpret those words with all the liberalism which they imply.\\" In the church and Sunday school of Dr. Lyman Beecher, and his successor, Hubbard Winslow, she received her first religious impressions. Afterwards, on her father's second marriage with a woman who belonged to the Unitarian church, the family changed their connection, under the care of Dr. Lowell. \\"Here,\\" she says, \\"I found a somewhat different, though not antagonistic teaching, for those were the early days when there was still a simple faith, even among those who had unbound it from the Puritan rigidity. To Dr. Lowell, Dr. Bartol, and Mrs. Bartol, who as Miss Howard, was my Sunday-school teacher, I owe the beginning of my most earnest thinking.\\" ==Career== The Whitney home in Milton On November 7, 1843, she married Seth Dunbar Whitney, a wealthy merchant of Milton, who was twenty years older than herself. They lived in Milton, where they raised their family. For many years her household obligations prevented her from devoting time to her literary work, apart from an occasional article to a religious journal. Whitney started writing seriously in her thirties, after her children started school. She first published poems and stories in local journals. Her first writing appeared in the Religious Magazine, published by Bishop Frederic Dan Huntington. In the winter of 1859, Rudd & Carleton published for her Mother Goose for Grown Folks, a little jeu d'esprit, for Christmas. In 1861, she wrote Boys at Chequasset, for which, probably, her own son furnished material. In June, 1862, came out Faith Gartney's Girlhood. Both these books were issued by Loring in Boston, and had an immediate success. In 1864, came out under the same publisher The Gayworthys, published simultaneously in England, by Sampson, Low, Son & Co. In 1866, she issued as a serial in Our Young Folks, \\"A Summer in Leslie Goldthwaite's Life\\"; this was published the same year by Fields, Osgood & Co. In the space from 1868 to 1870, she wrote as a serial in the Christian Register, \\" Patience Strong's Outings,\\" which was published by Loring. She also furnished a serial called \\"We Girls\\" to Our Young Folks, which was published in book form by Fields, Osgood & Co. In 1869, she published Hitherto, which appeared simultaneously in England, Whitney securing copyright by being in Montreal at the time of publication. Sights and insights To these followed Real Folks and The Other Girls, published by Osgood & Co., in 1872–73. After this followed Sights and Insights, detailing the experiences of a party travelling in Europe. In the winter of 1877, Whitney compiled a cookbook entitled Just How, and in the spring of 1879, she published her story entitled Odd or Even with the firm of Osgood & Co. After the issue of Odd or Even, Messrs. Houghton & Osgood, having previously purchased of Loring the plates of all Whitney's other books, prepared a uniform edition of all her works. From time to time, Whitney published poetry in the Atlantic Monthly, or other papers; these were collected in a volume entitled \\"Pansies,\\" published by Osgood & Co. in 1872. The 1905, New International Encyclopedia expressed the opinion that with Hitherto (1869) \\"the period of her best work ends.\\" Whitney also patented a set of alphabet blocks for children. ==Personal life== Grave Whitney privately opposed women's suffrage, and took no part in public life (in accordance with the traditional approach for women expressed in her books). Her daughter, Caroline Leslie Field, published prose and verse. She was known to the reading public through her contributions to periodicals. Whitney died in Milton at the age of 81. ==Style and themes== Whitney wrote mainly for young girls and supported conservative values. She promoted the message of the era that a woman's happiest place is in the home, the source of all goodness. As this was popular among parents, her books sold extremely well throughout her life. In the Apostles' Creed, on which Whitney found rest, is the article \\"I believe in the communion of saints,\\" and Whitney, in this poem, expressed the idea of the primitive church, of a living, unbroken sympathy between their departed friends and themselves. They believed that in the services of the church their beloved ones once more drew near to them, and as in family prayers, the whole family in heaven and on earth united. The most suggestive and comprehensive of Whitney's stories is The Other Girls. In her other stories, she has given amiable, sprightly, interesting young people, growing up under circumstances of ease and comfort, with means for a free, unembarrassed development. But in The Other Girls, we have life questions as they present themselves to those to whom life is a perplexity and a battle, and in this field, Whitney has the advantage of a heart full of motherly sympathy. There is no innocent natural feeling of the young female heart for which she has not kindly comprehension and tolerance. In Whitney's stories, we find the tenderest motherly sympathy for this natural feeling of the young girl's heart. Some of the prettiest pages of The Other Girls are given to a description of the raptures and tremors of the beautiful young country girl, Bel Bree, when acting as a lay figure in trying on an exquisite dress which she and her aunt were making up for a customer. Then there is a suggestion of an admiring male spectator, lodging in the same house, who catches through the half-open door a glimpse of all this loveliness. So far there has been only sympathy with young girlhood, but when the story goes on to show how this same admirer, Morris Hewland, captivated by the girl's loveliness, yet unwilling to offend his aristocratic relations, offers her protection and support without marriage, Whitney makes Bel Bree show resistance. She goes to Aunt Blin's Bible for guidance. In treating of the chances, mischances, fortunes, and misfortunes of The Other Girls, Whitney strikes directly across the much- mooted \\"woman question\\" of that day, and here she takes her stand firmly on the ground that family life and the creation of home and its influences is the first duty and the greatest glory of woman. She gives the instance of a young girl who, on the strength of her youthful prettiness, and a lesson or two in elocution, chooses to try the life of a platform reader, and shows the dangers that beset such a course: its interference with womanly duties and family ties, and the slightness of the advantages it brings compared with those which are sacrificed. In contrast come ever so many pretty scenes, as, for instance, when Bel Bree and Kate Senserbo go to live as \\"help\\" in a charming young family, where there is mutual appreciativeness and mutual care on the part both of employer and employed. ==Selected works== Daffodils, 1887 *1857: \\"Footsteps on the Seas\\" (poem) *1859: Mother Goose for Grown Folks (new editions in 1870 and 1882) *1868: Boys at Chequasset *1863: Faith Gartney's Girlhood *1865: The Gayworthys *1866: A Summer in Leslie Goldthwaite's Life *1868: Patience Strong's Outings *1869: Hitherto *1870: We Girls *1871: Real Folks *1872: Pansies (poems) *1873: The Other Girls *1876: Sights and Insights *1878: Just How: A Key to the Cook Books *1880: Odd or Even *1885: Bonnyborough *1886: Homespun Yarns *1886: Holy Tides *1887: Daffodils *1888: Bird Talk *1890: Ascutney Street *1891: A Golden Gossip *1894: Square Pegs *1896: Friendly Letters to Girl Friends *1897: The Open Mystery: A Reading of the Mosaic Story *1900: The Integrity of Christian Science ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * * ==External links== *Selected Poetry of Adeline Dutton Train Whitney (1824–1906) — Representative Poetry Online * * * Category:1824 births Category:1906 deaths Category:19th-century American poets Category:19th-century American women writers Category:American children's writers Category:American women poets Category:People from Milton, Massachusetts Category:Poets from Massachusetts Category:Whitney family Category:Writers from Boston ","title":"Adeline Dutton Train Whitney"},{"id":"2576655","text":"A micrositeBuilding Customer-Brand Relationships.

John Wiley & Sons, 2012. ==Usage== Microsites are typically used in web design to add a specialized group of information either editorial or commercial. Such sites may be linked in to a main site or not or taken completely off a site's server when the site is used for a temporary purpose. The main distinction of a microsite versus its parent site is its purpose and specific cohesiveness as compared to the microsite's broader overall parent website. Microsites used for editorial purposes may be a page or group of pages that, for example, might contain information about a holiday, an event or similar item which gives more detailed information than a site's general content area may provide. A community organization may have its main site with all of the organization's basic information, but creates a separate, temporary microsite to inform about a particular activity, event or similar. Often, microsites will be used for editorial purposes by a commercial business to add editorial value. For example, a retailer of party goods may create a microsite with editorial content about the history of Halloween or some other holiday or event. The commercial purpose of such editorial microsites, (beyond driving product sales), may include adding value to the site's visitors for branding purposes as well as providing editorial content and keywords allowing for greater chances of search engine inclusion. Normally, microsites do not contain web applications. Microsites may be used for purely commercial purposes to create in-depth information about a particular product, service or as editorial support towards a specific product, such as describing a new technology. A car manufacturer, for example, may present a new hybrid vehicle and support the sales presentation with a microsite specific to explaining hybrid technology. With the prevalence of keyword contextual advertising, (more commonly referred to as pay per click or PPC), microsites may be created specifically to carry such contextual advertising. Or along a similar tactic, they're created in order to specifically carry topic-specific, keyword-rich content with the goal of having search engines rank them highly when search engine users seek such content topics. A microsite however, will most likely not lower PPC cost, because it will most likely not improve Quality Score. There are nine factors that go into Quality Score, one of them is the quality of the landing page (how relevant the content is, transparent it is, and the ease of navigation). This factor does not look at the entire website (which can be a common misconception on Quality Score), only the page chosen to land people on from their search query. Thus it does not matter if the website covers a broad spectrum of items, or only one, it matters if that one page's content is specific to that person's search. And considering the other eight factors that go into Quality Score, the main website should typically result in better Quality Scores than a microsite.Google Quality Score Explained ==Criticism== Microsites have been criticized by security expert Rich Baldry who claimed they cause confusion, waste money, and can damage reputation. > When special-purpose domains for campaign microsites appear, it becomes > [...] confusing. At best, people might ignore the microsite domain, keeping > themselves safe but making the marketing dollars a waste. At worst, the > protection and reputation offered by use of known domains is lost and people > end up infected the next time they follow an unknown domain. ==See also== *Minisite *Landing page *Web presence *Weblet ==References== * Ann Handley Microsite User Experience Design.

Since then, the Sestra River has been flowing into this reservoir. The Sestroretsk Overflow is separated from the Gulf of Finland with a ridge of artificial sand dunes. Excess water is dumped into the Gulf of Finland through a canal, which is long. The Sestra served as a natural border between Russia and Sweden (1323–1617) and between Russia and Finland (1812–1940). It currently serves as a border between Vsevolozhsky (east, formerly Soviet Union) and Vyborgsky (west, formerly Finland) districts of Leningrad Oblast. ==References== Category:Karelian Isthmus Category:Geography of Karelia Category:Rivers of Leningrad Oblast Category:Rivers of Saint Petersburg Category:Drainage basins of the Baltic Sea ","title":"Sestra (Leningrad Oblast)"},{"id":"2576659","text":"An aerial shot with El Porto in the background. El Porto is a beach community that is part of northernmost Manhattan Beach, a city in the South Bay area of Greater Los Angeles in Southern California. The boundary of El Porto is 45th Street on the north side, which is the border with El Segundo, and its Chevron oil refinery, to 38th Street, which was the old border with Manhattan; the east-west boundary is Crest Drive, next to the fence of El Segundo's oil refinery, to El Porto State Beach and the Pacific Ocean. The commercial section of El Porto is along Highland Avenue, which is its only main thoroughfare. North of 45th Street, Highland becomes Vista Del Mar Boulevard, which runs along the coast to Playa del Rey. Residents of El Porto are currently zoned to Grandview Elementary School by the Manhattan Beach Unified School District. Fire and Police Services are generally provided by the downtown police and fire facility. ==History== El Porto was subdivided in 1911 on land owned by developer George H. Peck. There were 83 business lots, 225 residential lots, on sandy soil partly covered with large trees, and ocean view sand lots. Included were concrete sidewalks and curbs, oiled streets and artesian water that was piped in the streets. The 30-by-90 foot lots, laid out by Peck, were each between a street and an alley. At first, no names were given to the streets. Numbers were later assigned to the east-west streets and names to the alleys. The alley between 39th and 40th Streets, for instance, is named El Porto Street. Although it is thought to mean \\"The Port\\" in Spanish, the name is actually a misspelling and translates \\"The I Carry.\\" The Spanish word for port should have actually been spelled p-u-e-r-t-o. However, \\"porto\\" is the Portuguese word for \\"port,\\" but its article is \\"O\\" instead of \\"El,\\" which leads one to believe the origin of the name El Porto could have come from both Spanish and Portuguese influences. For over six decades, El Porto was a county island that was part of the El Segundo Unified School District. In November 1980, the unincorporated town of El Porto, consisting of approximately and a population of about 1,185 people, was annexed from the County of Los Angeles by Manhattan Beach. ==See also== *El Porto State Beach ==External links== *Manhattan Beach, CA Category:Neighborhoods in Los Angeles County, California Category:Populated places established in 1911 Category:Manhattan Beach, California ","title":"El Porto, Manhattan Beach, California"},{"id":"2576665","text":"Enrique Santos Discépolo (Discepolín) (27 March 1901 – 23 December 1951) was an Argentine tango and milonga musician and composer, author of famous tangos such as \\"Cambalache\\" and many others performed by several of the most important singers of his time, amongst them notably Carlos Gardel. He was also a film actor, director and screenwriter. ==Life== Discépolo was born in Buenos Aires on 27 March 1901. He was attracted to the arts from an early age and tried acting and theater writing (with moderate success) before finally \\"arriving\\" to Tango. Even when his decision to write popular music wasn't totally separated from his previous exchanges with theater and acting, his older brother Armando resisted this move and therefore in the beginning things weren't easy for Enrique. Armando had taken over his education after his parent died when Enrique was very young. He wrote a few songs (including, the later famous Que vachaché, an old lunfardo phrase meaning \\"Whatcha gonna do\\") with little success until his break came in 1928, when singer Azucena Maizani performed his Esta noche me emborracho (\\"Tonight I'm getting drunk\\"). Days after this performance, the lyrics to this tango circulated across the nation and gave him notoriety. Later on that year, actress and singer Tita Merello rescued Que vachaché, and propelled it to the same popularity as Esta noche me emborracho. To finish a great year in 1928, he also met his partner, Tania, who would be with him for the rest of his life. He continued to gain notoriety in the ensuing years, and, in 1934, he wrote \\"Cambalache\\", a song whose lyrics not only reflected the world political climate of the era, but also almost predicted its future. Argentines sometimes contemplate on how much those lyrics still reflect life in the world today, some 80 years later. Discépolo died after suffering a stroke on Christmas Eve in 1951. ==Style== Discépolo was not as prolific as some other Tango writers (like Enrique Cadícamo, for example), but he was very versatile in his styling. He was not only able to write ironic and moralistic songs (\\"Que vachaché\\", \\"Yira... yira...\\", \\"Que sapa señor\\", \\"Cambalache\\"), but also romantic (\\"Sueño de juventud\\"), sarcastic (\\"Justo el 31\\", \\"Chorra\\"), expressionist (\\"Soy un arlequín\\", \\"Quién más, quién menos\\"), passionate (\\"Confesión\\", \\"Canción desesperada\\") and nostalgic ones (\\"Uno\\", \\"Cafetín de Buenos Aires\\"). His tango songs, as those of most other tango composers, make extensive use of lunfardo, thus making understanding his lyrics an exercise in patience for listeners unused to that dialect. ==Selected Songs== *Infamia (\\"Infamy\\") *Que vachaché (\\"Whatcha gonna do\\") *Yira... yira...

The company produces office furniture, architectural and technology products for office environments and the education, health care and retail industries. It is the largest office furniture manufacturer in the world. It has facilities, offices, and factories in the Americas, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Australia and Africa. ==History== Switch as a datacenter. Steelcase was founded as the Metal Office Furniture Company in 1912 by Peter M. Wege in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Wege was a veteran of the sheet metal and fireproofing industry and had filed approximately 25 patents prior to starting the company. The Metal Office Furniture Company's first products included fireproof metal safes and four-drawer filing cabinets, which Wege invented and manufactured for the Macey Company. Victor wastebasket In 1914, the company received its first product patent for \\"The Victor,\\" a fireproof steel wastebasket. The Victor gained popularity due to its light weight—achieved through a patented process of bending flat steel at right angles to create boxes—and its ability to prevent fires at a time when smoking was common indoors, particularly in the workplace. In 1915, the company began manufacturing and distributing steel desks after designing and producing 200 for Boston's first skyscraper, the Custom House Tower. In 1937, the company collaborated with Frank Lloyd Wright on office furniture for the Johnson Wax Headquarters. The partnership lasted two years and resulted in some of the first modern workstations. The name Steelcase was a result of an advertising campaign to promote metal office furniture over wood and was trademarked in 1921. The company officially changed its name to Steelcase, Inc. in 1954. 1977 Series 90001 The company became known as the leader of the furniture industry in the late 1960s due to the volume of its sales. Steelcase expanded into new markets during the 1970s, including Asia, Europe, and North Africa. In 1973, the company debuted the Series 9000 furniture line, an office system that became a best seller and the company's flagship brand. That same year, the company delivered the largest single furniture shipment to the then-new Sears Tower. The delivery included 43,565 pieces of furniture and furnished 44 floors. During the 1980s and 1990s, Steelcase shifted its approach to designing and creating products in response to changes in the workplace and economy. The company also focused on creativity and internal innovation by working closely with architects and interior designers to develop products as well the company's own workspace in Grand Rapids. The company's current headquarters were built in 1983 on 901 44th St. SE in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 1989, Steelcase opened the pyramid-shaped Steelcase Inc. Corporate Development Center. The center contained ten research laboratories and workspaces meant to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration on product development. Steelcase vacated the Pyramid in 2010, and the Pyramid was sold to Switch (company) in 2016. In 1996, Steelcase became the majority stakeholder in design firm IDEO and the firm's CEO, David M. Kelley, became Steelcase's vice president of technical discovery and innovation. Steelcase sold its shares back to IDEO's managers starting in 2007. Multiple 15 desk In 1996, Steelcase was found at fault in a patent infringement suit brought against them by Haworth, Inc., another furniture company. Steelcase was ordered to pay $211.5 million in damages and interest, thus ending a 17-year dispute with Haworth. Steelcase became a publicly traded company in 1998 under the symbol SCS. During the 2000s, Steelcase reorganized its workforce and began integrating modern technologies in its products. In 2000, the company opened Steelcase University, a center for ongoing employee development and learning. Steelcase's wood furniture plant in Caledonia, MI earned LEED certification in 2001, becoming the first plant to receive the certification. In 2002, Steelcase partnered with IBM to create BlueSpace, a \\"smart office\\" prototype designed using new office technologies. In 2010, Steelcase and IDEO launched new models for higher education classrooms called LearnLabs. ==Company overview== Steelcase is a publicly traded furniture manufacturer headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It is the largest office furniture manufacturer in the world. The company has approximately 80 locations and 11,000 employees worldwide.

His activities were very eclectic, including architecture, lithography, furniture, stained-glass windows, mosaics, tapestries and book covers as well as painting. He also worked in a variety of styles; such as Symbolism, Impressionism and Art Nouveau. ==Biography== He was the son of a house painter. From 1881 to 1887, he was enrolled at the Royal Academy of Art,Biographical timeline @ the Museum Kunstpalast. but left without completing his studies. In 1890, his friend Jan Toorop introduced him to the work of the Belgian art group, Les XX, who he exhibited with. Two years later, Joséphin Péladan gave him a similar introduction to the Salon de la Rose + Croix. Much of his painting, in the Symbolist style, was done during this period, from 1891 to 1895. The Bride (1892) In 1898, he became artistic director of the \\"Arts & Crafts\\" gallery in The Hague, which sold many Art Nouveau items and furnishings in addition to art works. He began designing furniture at this time, inspired by the work of Henry Van de Velde, who he had met in Belgium. That same year, he was married, but his wife died from a miscarriage only a year later. In 1900, he had a falling-out with the gallery's founder, Chris Wegerif (1859-1920), and resigned. The following year he joined with Van Velde and to create the \\"Villa De Zeemeeuw\\" (seagull) in Scheveningen for the dermatologist and art patron W.J.H. Leuring (?-1936); striving to make it a true Gesamtkunstwerk. Despite this success, the clash between his aesthetics and the prevailing art styles, which was behind his departure from the gallery, continued. In addition, his political beliefs caused him to receive bad press (he was an anarchist when most of the Dutch art world favored socialism), which had a negative effect on his ability to obtain work. In 1904, he decided to move to Germany. With help from the art historian and museum director, Friedrich Deneken, he was able to obtain a teaching position in Krefeld at the new \\"Handwerker- und Kunstgewerbeschule\\". This gave him a free hand to create furniture and fabric designs. He also took his students on field trips to show them the pleasures of painting en plein air. In 1910, he left Krefeld for Hagen to participate in the avant-garde movement being sponsored and promoted by Karl Ernst Osthaus. He soon received numerous commissions for murals, mosaics and stained-glass windows, including those at the Gesellenhaus (meeting hall) in Neuss, designed by Peter Behrens. During his stay in Hagen, he was a teacher at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Essen and remarried. His son from that marriage, became a well-known professional motorcycle racer. During the years 1917 and 1918 in Essen, he taught the young Josef Albers his stained-glass making techniques, which impacted greatly Albers’ oeuvre.de Melo, M.

After a short stay in Überlingen from 1919 to 1920, he moved to Munich where he taught glass-painting and monumental art, then transferred to the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, followed by the Cologne Art and Craft Schools in 1926. He remained there until his death.

Suárez was born in the town of Tupiza in the southern part of Potosí, Bolivia in 1929. A self-taught writer, Suárez abandoned elementary school at third grade, following a traumatizing event in which his teacher suffered an epilepsy attack while reading for him. Ironically, his mother, who was also a rural teacher, accepted to home-school him. When he was ten, after reading Dick Sand, A Captain at Fifteen by Jules Verne and Jerry of the Islands by Jack London he promised and swore himself to become, some day, a writer. By the end of the 1950s he decides to fulfill his promise. He quits his job as a banking employee from the Bolivian Mining Bank and buys a truck to travel and know his country in depth. Throughout almost two years of long trips all over Bolivia, he writes simultaneously several of his short stories and finalizes the first draft of his play Vértigo. A few months later he decides to dedicate fully to write literature and make a living out of it.QUIROZ, Luis R. En \\"Cervantes y Don Quijote en Bolivia\\". Chapter dedicated to Gastón Suárez. Pages 70 to 103 He performed diverse activities: railroader, rural teacher, miner, bank employee, truck driver, journalist, etc. He had the opportunity to live and feel the Bolivian life in its diverse social layers. This is reflected with a particular vision in the subjects he writes most about: urban life, the country and the mines. \\"... Suárez goes beyond the simple fact and further than the anecdote. He subtly unveils transcendental situations. Acute observer of the human behavior, he is the most outstanding writer of psychological introversion amongst the boom of Bolivian narrators.\\"RIVERA-RODAS, Oscar. In \\"La narrativa boliviana. Aproximación a sus aspectos formales\\" La Paz. Bolivia. 1972 P. 96 His first work was a story book titled \\"A vigil for the last trip\\" (Vigilia para el último viaje), from which \\"Illuminated\\" (Iluminado) was extracted to be included in several anthologies of Latin American writers, as a remarkable example of brief narration. thumb Amongst his works also stands out \\"The Gesture\\" (El Gesto) another book of short stories from which \\"The stranger and the silver candelabrum (El forastero y el candelabro de plata)\\" and \\"The diary of Mafalda\\" (El diario de Mafalda) are the most outstanding. In 1967, Suárez published his first piece for theatre, Vértigo, a drama of social and philosophical depth that depicts the life of a man being freed after twenty years in prison and his efforts to gather his seven children who have all taken different paths in life. Vertigo was screenplayed and presented in Jornadas Julianas de la Juventud in 1967, winning the first prize. His most famous novel is Mallko, published in 1974. It narrates the life of a humanized Condor (\\"a Mallko\\" as it is named in the Amerindian language Aymara). The novel has elements of fiction and magic realism, but ends up being much more than that. It is at the same time a vivid, real and crude narration of the life of the Andean man. It is a philosophical reflection on the man's faith of meeting his own destiny and the need to survive in isolation and constant need. It is virtually a compulsory text in Bolivia, Spain and in the signatory countries of the Andean Zone. In 1976 Mallko was included in the Honour List of the Hans Christian Andersen Award and described as \\"an exceptional example of literature with international importance\\". thumb In 1979, the International Year of the Child, he published another novel The adventures of Miguelín Quijano (Las aventuras de Miguelín Quijano), in which he works with metaphors and references with respect to the quixotic characters to obtain a beautiful parable that ignites the creative imagination of the children and incites their interest for the immortal book of Miguel de Cervantes. In 1981 he published Beyond the Winter (Despues del Invierno), a drama portraying the dilemma of two brothers (Melitón and Benjamin) facing the decision of staying and caring their old ailing father or to go on with their own lives.

Before the English and Scottish crowns were united under James VI and I, sources indicate it was intended to be used in much the same way the title Prince of Wales was used to designate the heir-apparent to the English throne, although the Scottish heir-apparent was addressed only as Duke of Rothesay until that time. ===Principality of Scotland=== The title of Prince of Scotland originated from a charter granting the Principality of Scotland to the future James I of Scotland (not to be confused with James VI and I), the then heir apparent, granted on 10 December 1404, by Robert III. During the reign of James III, permanency was enacted to the title. The designation \\"Principality of Scotland\\" implied (and implies) not Scotland as a whole but lands in western Scotland, in areas such as Renfrewshire, Ayrshire and Kirkcudbrightshire appropriated as patrimony of the Sovereign's eldest son for his maintenance. In modern times, the Prince remains paramount superior in these lands (whilst The Crown serves this role in the rest of Scotland). The Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, however, abolished most remaining feudal duties and privileges attaching to the Principality,section 58(1), Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000. legislation.gov.uk \\"This Act binds the Crown and accordingly such provision as is made by section 2 of this Act as respects feudal estates of dominium shall apply to the superiority of the Prince and Steward of Scotland and to the ultimate superiority of the Crown; but nothing in this Act shall be taken to supersede or impair any power exercisable by Her Majesty by virtue of Her prerogative\\" leaving the Prince's status as mainly titular. Prior to the 2000 Act the Principality was entirely feued out to tenants and brought in a small income. All title deeds in Ayrshire and Renfrewshire required to be sealed with the Prince's seal. Revenue gained from feudal dealings were counted as income for the Duchy of Cornwall, a more substantial estate held by the monarch's child who is heir apparent. ==Great Steward== The Great Stewardship of Scotland was granted to Walter Fitz Alan by David I, and came to the Sovereign through the accession of Robert II, son of Robert I's daughter Marjorie and Walter Stewart, 6th Great Steward of Scotland, on 9 April 1327. Since that date it has been enjoyed by the Sovereign's eldest son. The titles Prince and Great Steward of Scotland are normally conjoined in legislation. ==Use of titles== Since James VI also became the King of England and Ireland in 1603, the titles have fallen from habitual use, the holder from then on usually also being Duke of Cornwall, Prince of Wales and Duke of Rothesay, which were preferred, and is now seldom referred to, except as the last in the conventional list of the Prince of Wales's titles. Similar to the process of Crown consent (see Prince's Consent), in order for any bill affecting, directly or by implication, the personal property or interests of the Prince and Great Steward of Scotland to be heard in Parliament, Parliament shall not debate any question whether the Bill be passed or approved unless such consent to those provisions has been signified at a meeting of the Parliament. In the Scottish Parliament such consent is signified by a member of the Scottish Government. When the Sovereign had no son, there has been uncertainty as to who should bear and use the titles and enjoy the revenues of the Principality. Both Mary, Queen of Scots, and George II of Great Britain used the titles and styles, but on the accession of George VI there was a difference between the opinion of the Lord Lyon and the advice given by the Scottish Lords of Appeal to the Garter King of Arms. The matter remains unresolved, but is unlikely to be of practical significance for some time. ==References== Category:Titles in Scotland Category:Heirs apparent ","title":"Prince of Scotland"},{"id":"2576731","text":"Neuromantic is Yukihiro Takahashi's self-produced 1981 album and featured his YMO colleagues Haruomi Hosono and Ryuichi Sakamoto on keyboards.

Pablo was born and brought up in the house of his father's maternal uncle, Francisco Lopez de Aponte, Canon of Cordoba, where he received a learned education. At the age of eighteen, in 1556, he was sent to the Universidad Complutense in Alcalá de Henares, and there, devoted himself to the acquirement of Oriental languages and theology. He later moved to Rome where he studied painting under Federico Zuccari. He was in Rome in February 1559, engaged in conducting certain negotiations for the Archbishop Carranza de Miranda, of Toledo, who then stood charged with heresy before the Inquisition of Valladolid. On the 17th of that month he addressed a letter to the prelate, informing him how his business stood at the Vatican, in which he incautiously reflected on the conduct of the Inquisitor-General Valdez, and the Holy Office—an offence which no Inquisitor-General would forgive. This document and others were seized with the primate's papers; he was therefore denounced by the tribunal, and but for his fortunate absence, would have been imprisoned. It is probable that he did not venture back into Spain for many years, until he had covered his sins with the protecting robes of the Church. He remained in Italy for over 20 years and built a reputation as an artist. His only surviving works from that period are the frescoes he painted in the Bonfili chapel at the Santa Trinità dei Monti church in Rome. He returned to Spain in 1577, and was appointed as the canon of the Córdoba cathedral. He continued to write books on antiquarian topics such as the architecture of the temple of Solomon. He befriended Arias Montano. In 1604 he composed his Discourse of Ancient and Modern Painting and Sculpture in which he recounts anecdotes of Renaissance masters of Italy. Among his students was Juan Alfonso Abril. ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== * Category:1538 births Category:1608 deaths Category:People from the Province of Guadalajara Category:16th-century Spanish painters Category:Spanish male painters Category:17th-century Spanish painters Category:Italian art historians Category:Complutense University of Madrid alumni Category:Fresco painters ","title":"Pablo de Céspedes"},{"id":"2576745","text":"Night Moves may refer to: ==Music== * Night Moves (album), a 1976 album by Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band ** \\"Night Moves\\" (song), the title song * \\"Night Moves\\" (Abigail song), a 1996 single by Abigail * Nightmoves, a 2007 album by Kurt Elling * \\"Nightmoves\\", a song from Michael Franks' 1976 album The Art of Tea * Night Moves, a 2002 album by Carolyn Breuer * Night Moves (band), a rock band ==Other media== * Night Moves (1975 film), a 1975 film directed by Arthur Penn and starring Gene Hackman * Night Moves (2013 film), a 2013 film directed by Kelly Reichardt and starring Dakota Fanning and Jesse Eisenberg * \\"The Night Moves\\", an episode of The O.C. * \\"Night Moves\\", an episode of War of the Worlds * Night Moves, a novel in the series Tom Clancy's Net Force * Night Moves and Other Stories (2000), a short story collection by Tim Powers * Night Moves (adventure), for the role-playing game Marvel Super Heroes * Night Moves (TV series), a Canadian TV show from 1986–1993 * Night Moves (poetry collection), a 2013 book by Stephanie Barber * Night Moves (memoir), a 2018 memoir by music critic Jessica Hopper == See also == * Knight Moves (disambiguation) ","title":"Night Moves"},{"id":"2576750","text":"Mill Hill railway station serves the Blackburn suburb of Mill Hill, England, west of Blackburn railway station.

His son Alfred Goldhaber is a Professor at the C. N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics at SUNY Stony Brook. His grandson, David Goldhaber-Gordon is a Physics Professor at Stanford University. ==Education== After beginning his physics studies at the University of Berlin, he earned his doctorate at Cambridge University in 1936, belonging to Magdalene College. ==Career== In 1934, working at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, England he and James Chadwick, through what they called the nuclear photo-electric effect, established that the neutron has a great enough mass over the proton to decay. He moved to the University of Illinois in 1938. In the 1940s with his wife Gertrude Scharff-Goldhaber he established that beta particles are identical to electrons. He joined Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1950. With Edward Teller he proposed that the so-called \\"giant-dipole nuclear resonance\\" was due to the neutrons in a nucleus vibrating as a group against the protons as a group (Goldhaber-Teller model). He made a well-known bet with Hartland Snyder in about 1955 that anti-protons could not exist; when he lost the bet, he speculated that the reason anti-matter does not appear to be abundant in the universe is that before the Big Bang, a single particle, the \\"universon\\" existed that then decayed into \\"cosmon\\" and \\"anti-cosmon,\\" and that the cosmon subsequently decayed to produce the known cosmos. In the 1950s also he speculated that all fermions such as electrons, protons and neutrons are \\"doubled,\\" that is that each is associated with a similar heavier particle. He also speculated that in what became known as the Goldhaber-Christie model, the so-called strange particles were composites of just 3 basic particles. He was Director of Brookhaven National Laboratory from 1961 to 1973. Among his many other awards, he won the National Medal of Science in 1983,Maurice Goldhaber at the President's National Medal of Science the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1985, the Wolf Prize in 1991, the J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize in 1982 (shared with Robert Marshak), and the Fermi Award in 1998. Maurice Goldhaber's brother Gerson Goldhaber was a professor of physics at the University of California Berkeley; his son Alfred Scharff Goldhaber is a professor of physics at SUNY Stony Brook; his grandson (son of Alfred) David Goldhaber-Gordon is a professor of physics at Stanford. ==Death== Goldhaber died May 11, 2011, at his home in East Setauket, New York at 100. ==Legacy== In 2001, Brookhaven National Laboratory created the Gertrude and Maurice Goldhaber Distinguished Fellowships in his honor.

War films and epic films often employ background actors in large numbers: some films have featured hundreds or even thousands of paid background actors as cast members (hence the term \\"cast of thousands\\"). Likewise, grand opera can involve many background actors appearing in spectacular productions. On a film or TV set, background actors are usually referred to as \\"junior artist\\", \\"atmosphere\\", \\"background talent\\", \\"background performers\\", \\"background artists\\", \\"background cast members\\" or simply \\"background\\",Background Actors, Extras or Atmosphere? tophollywoodactingcoach Published by Ross, Mae; 3-2-1 Acting. Accessed 22 May 2018 while the term \\"extra\\" is rarely used. In a stage production, background actors are commonly referred to as \\"supernumeraries\\". In opera and ballet, they are called either \\"extras\\" or \\"supers\\". ==Casting== Extras in the Krak des Chevaliers castle, Syria. Casting criteria for background actors depend on the production. It is not entirely true that background cast members require little or no acting experience, as any type of unrealistic portrayal must include some form of imagination and acting. Punctuality, reliability and the ability to take direction also figure prominently for these cast members. Background actors are often selected on short notice, after all other preparations for the shoot have been finalized. Several casting agencies specialize only in background work, whilst in the UK the directory Contacts published annually by Spotlight lists all accredited agencies and productions. Some agencies charge a registration fee, and some (mostly commercial background casting) will take between 10% and 15% commission from any booked work. Artists may be required to provide a basic one-page A4 sized CV/resume, that states basic personal details and dimensions, any significant skills (e.g. stage combat), and includes two 8x10 inch photographs on the rear: one head shot; one full body shot. When hiring background actors, casting directors generally seek those with a specific \\"look\\", such as \\"high school students\\" or \\"affluent senior citizens\\", consistent with the context of the film. Casting directors may also look for background actors with a special skill for the scene, such as rollerblading, or dancing. A background actor is often expected to bring his or her own wardrobe to the set, although there are also \\"fittings\\" for a specific scene or period. A casting director may favor the one who already has the required costume or prop, such as a police uniform, or a musical instrument. On other occasions, where a costume has already been prepared (for example, to fit another actor who is now unavailable), a background actor may be selected as a \\"costume double\\" simply because they are the right size to fit it. On smaller productions or student films, background actors may be hired en masse with little formality. The length of a background actor's employment on a production largely depends on the needs of the director and the scenes being filmed. Some background actors are needed on the set only for a day or two, while others may remain with the film for an extended period. For instance, on James Cameron's film Titanic, a group of 150 \\"core background actors\\" was hired to play the ship's passengers, and employed throughout the filming. ==Salary and working conditions== ===United Kingdom=== In the United Kingdom, the distinction between an actor and an extra is defined by agreements between the actors trade unions Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph and Theatre Union (BECTU) and Equity, and the various commercial trade and production bodies. These state that once a performer says 13 or more words in any scene, they must become a contracted actor in that production. Minimum pay rates are defined by UK Government minimum wage regulations, and both BECTU and Equity have agreed rates with each body. However, even on non-union productions an extra's pay is an agreed day-rate for ten hours of production time. All performers under agreement with BECTU/Equity are paid on-going royalties. Hence on many advertisements, which are often shown multiple times and distributed internationally, whilst the extra is paid a contracted day-rate, the largest payment is nominally due from ongoing royalties. Due to the resultant complex calculations from multiple international showings, performers under a union managed agreement are often bought-out of their advertisement royalties with a one-off payment. ===United States=== Since 2012, in the US, most major film and television productions fall under the jurisdiction of the SAG-AFTRA union, previously before SAG- AFTRA was AFL-CIO's affiliate, the two unions were separately named as: Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA). SAG-AFTRA signatory AMPTP producers are allowed to hire non-union background actors after a certain number of SAG performers have been cast; non-union background actors are usually paid the minimum wage. On productions outside of union jurisdiction, payment for background actors is at the discretion of the producers, and ranges from union-scale rates to \\"copy and credit\\" (i.e., no pay). Those producers who do not pay their actors may be in violation of state and federal laws about minimum wage for a job. From 1946 until 1992, background actors (in film and television) were largely represented by the Screen Extras Guild. The Screen Extras Guild was dissolved in 1992 (legally dissolved in 1994) and its portrayal was transferred back to SAG as \\"West Coast extras\\". ==In popular culture== The silent film The Extra Girl (1923) portrays a small-town girl who comes to Hollywood and becomes a background actor in her attempt to achieve stardom. The British television sitcom Extras (2005–07) follows the exploits of two professional background actors, Andy and Maggie. They spend most of their time on set looking for a speaking role and a boyfriend, respectively. In the Hindi black comedy film Mithya (2008), the protagonist is a background actor whose facial similarity to an underworld crime boss lands him in trouble. The Filipino comedy-drama film Ekstra (The Bit Player) (2013) centers around the life of a divorcee named Loida Malabanan, whose odd job as a bit player for various acting roles enabled her to send her daughter to college. The movie is a social commentary on the exploitation and mistreatment of the marginalized sector in the television production industry in the Philippines. The Chinese-Hong Kong film I Am Somebody (2015) is about extras working at the Hengdian World Studios. ==See also== * Background dancer * Bit part * Cameo appearance * Central Casting * Character actor * Supporting actor * Under-Five ==References== ==External links== * \\"Extra helping\\", Sam Delaney, The Guardian, 2 April 2005 Category:Stage terminology Category:Acting Category:Filmmaking occupations Category:Television terminology ","title":"Extra (acting)"},{"id":"2576797","text":" HMCS Huron was an that served with the Canadian Forces from 16 December 1972 to 23 October 2000. It served mainly on the western coast of Canada. After decommissioning, its hull was stripped to be used in a live-fire exercise. The ship's hulk was eventually sunk by gunfire from its twin ship, . Huron was the second ship of its class and the second vessel to use the designation . ==History== Huron was laid down on 1 June 1969 by the builder Marine Industries of Sorel, Quebec, and was launched on 9 April 1971. It was officially commissioned into the Canadian Forces on 16 December 1972 and carried the pennant number 281. Huron began a refit known as the Tribal Class Update and Modernization Project (TRUMP) in July 1993, performed by MIL-Davie Shipbuilding at Lauzon, Quebec and concluded on November 25th, 1994. At this time, its classification changed from Destroyer Helicopter (DDH) to Destroyer Guided Missile (DDG). The ship was assigned to Maritime Forces Pacific (MARPAC) and was homeported at Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt. ==Service== Huron served on MARPAC missions protecting Canada's sovereignty in the Pacific Ocean and enforced Canadian laws in its territorial sea and Exclusive Economic Zone. Huron was also deployed on missions throughout the Pacific and to the Indian Ocean; specifically the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea on anti-terrorism operations. As part of Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II, Huron represented Canada in the naval review at Spithead on 28 June 1977. On 12 March 1980, it assisted the crew of the damaged freighter Maurice Desgagnes eventually taking them off when the ship sank. From 19 February to 24 February 1981, Huron was used to carry out trials of the Sea Sparrow system to be added in the TRUMP refit. Later that year it carried the Governor-General Edward Schreyer on a tour of Scandinavian ports. In the summer of 1990 Huron, accompanied by and , visited Vladivostok, the first visit by Canadian warships to Russia since the Second World War. Huron was sent to the Persian Gulf in the winter of 1991 as part of Operation Friction, the Canadian Forces' contribution to Operation Desert Storm (the Gulf War), to replace its twin ship as flagship of the Canadian Naval Task Group. Huron arrived after hostilities had ceased and patrolled for several months before returning to Esquimalt. In 1993 Huron was deployed to the Adriatic Sea as part of Operation Sharp Guard in support of the United Nations naval embargo of the former Yugoslavia. It then departed for the refit that began in July of that year. After completing her TRUMP refit, Huron returned to the west coast in 1995, taking part in most of the major naval exercises in the Pacific Ocean. On 7 September 1999, with Royal Canadian Mounted Police and personnel from Immigration Canada aboard, the warship intercepted a vessel carrying 146 Chinese migrants. The migrant ship was found to be unfit and Huron transported the passengers to Esquimalt. Huron appeared in the episode \\"The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" of the television series Seven Days, representing a new type of US warship under the command of a female captain. ==Paying off and sinking== Despite Huron being the most recently refitted Iroquois-class destroyer, it was placed in mothballed status in 2000, due to a personnel shortage following defence cutbacks during the late 1990s. In 2005 it was paid off from the Canadian Forces and awaited disposal at Esquimalt. In 2006 MARPAC decided to use Huron in what would become the first sink-exercise that Maritime Command (MARCOM) conducted. The exercise was named Operation Trident Fury and was planned to use a variety of MARPAC ships, and US Navy and AIRCOM aircraft, to bombard Huron with artillery, missiles and strafing fire, and finally to sink it with a torpedo launched from a submarine. Huron was stripped of armaments and all environmentally harmful contaminant equipment and fuel in the winter of 2006–2007. On 14 May 2007 it was towed to the MARPAC offshore weapons range west of Vancouver Island. Despite being damaged by with a Sea Sparrow surface- to-air missile, 57 mm gunfire and CIWS rounds, it was 76 mm naval gunfire from its twin Algonquin that was responsible for sinking the hulk of Huron.Canada.com – Navy Ship is sunk during target practice The main gun used by Algonquin had originally been installed on Huron, meaning that Huron was eventually sunk by one of its own weapons. This was the first operational sinking of a Canadian warship in home waters.Lookout Newspaper The sinking was the subject of a 2007 History Television documentary, \\"Sinking a Destroyer\\".History Television: Sinking a Destroyer Retrieved on 28 December 2009 ==Ship's bell== The Christening Bells Project at CFB Esquimalt's Naval and Military Museum includes information from the ship's bell of HMCS Huron, which was used for baptism of babies on board ship from 1973 to 1997.

From 10 February 1919 to 23 August 1920, he was associated with an organization called the Grenzschutz (\\"Border Defense\\"). He was awarded the Iron Cross (First Class). == Nazi career == According to the historian Richard Grunberger, Woyrsch had been a member in the Freikorps during the 1920s.Grunberger, Richard, Hitler's SS (1970), p. 42. Early on, Woyrsch joined the NSDAP (Membership number 162,349) and the SS (Member Number 3,689). Himmler charged him with organising the SS in the Nazi Gau of Silesia; as such Woyrsch became the first commander of the SS-Oberabschnitt Südost. In 1933, Woyrsch was elected to the Reichstag. He was the SS and Police Leader in Elbe, and in 1934 Woyrsch participated in the Night of the Long Knives, ordering the execution of his SS rival Emil Sembach. On 30 June 1934, \\"he took command in Silesia, and on the orders of Göring arrested a number of SA leaders, disarmed all SA headquarters' guards and occupied the Breslau police headquarters. Woyrsch's men executed some of the SA officers as a result of an on-going private feud.\\"Ailsby, Christopher, SS: Role of Infamy (1997), p. 183. Woyrsch had a close friendship with Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich, and was on Himmler's personal staff. On 1 January 1935 he was promoted to SS Obergruppenführer (then the second-highest rank in the SS). === Einsatzgruppe === In September 1939 Woyrsch commanded the Einsatzgruppe (\\"Special Purpose Operational Group\\") specifically charged with terrorizing and murdering the Jewish population of Poland. Woyrsch was responsible for some of the deadliest massacres of Jews in Poland in 1939, where in East Upper Silesia he led the group that murdered 500 Jews in Kattowitz, Będzin, and Sosnowiec. The brutality of this Einsatzgruppe in Kattowitz was such that some Wehrmacht officers interceded with the Gestapo to have it withdrawn.Browning, Origins of the Final Solution, pp. 16-19, 21, and 29. However many junior military commanders actively supported Woyrsch's campaign. Between 20 April 1940 and February 1944, Woyrsch was the Higher SS and Police Leader in military district IV and district leader in Dresden. Woyrsch was removed from office in 1944 for incompetence. According to Richard Grunberger, Woyrsch was part of Himmler's entourage trailing about northern Germany in 1945.Grunberger, Richard, Hitler's SS (1970), p. 102. == Trials and convictions == Woyrsch was interned by the British from 1945 to 1948. In 1948, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the \\"Night of the Long Knives\\" in 1934. However, he was released in 1952. He was tried again in 1957 and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. == Notes == == References == *Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Adelige Häuser A Band VII, Seite 403, Band 34 der Gesamtreihe, C.

The Battlefield is centered on the city of Petersburg, Virginia, and also includes outlying components in Hopewell, Prince George County, and Dinwiddie County. Over 140,000 people visit the park annually. ==Park Units== Petersburg National Battlefield is composed of three major units and an additional managed component. ===Eastern Front Visitor Center and Park Tour Road=== Located off Virginia Route 36 east of Petersburg, the Eastern Front Visitor Center is the main visitor contact station for the Battlefield. Here, visitors can view exhibits and movies about the Siege of Petersburg as well as view Battery #5, an important early site in the Siege. The park entrance fee is also collected on the Eastern Front Visitor Center access road. After leaving the Visitor Center, one can begin their park tour. A motor tour route runs from Virginia Route 36 to US Route 301. Along the way, visitors can view sites such as Fort Stedman and The Crater. ===Five Forks Battlefield=== Located in Dinwiddie County about southwest of downtown Petersburg, this unit contains the site of the Battle of Five Forks, which destroyed a sizable portion of the remaining Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Sometimes called the \\"Waterloo of the Confederacy,\\" Five Forks helped set in motion a series of events that led to Robert E. Lee's subsequent surrender at Appomattox Court House. ===City Point Unit=== Battery XVI in the Main Unit Sited next to the James River in Hopewell, City Point served as a major command and logistics hub for the Union Army during the Siege of Petersburg.

In the 1950s, he was a leading member of the Independent Group in the UK and in the 1960s was an influential writer and curator in the US. He first used the term \\"mass popular art\\" in the mid-1950s and used the term \\"Pop Art\\" in the 1960s to indicate that art has a basis in the popular culture of its day and takes from it a faith in the power of images. From 1954 until his death in 1990, he was married to the painter Sylvia Sleigh. ==Early life and education== Between 1943 and 1947, Alloway studied art history at the University of London, where he met the future critic and curator David Sylvester. Alloway wrote short book reviews for the London Times in 1944 and 1945, at which time he was between 17 and 19 years old. ==Work== ===Early career and the Independent Group=== Alloway started writing reviews for the British periodical Art News and Review (later renamed ArtReview) in 1949 and for the American periodical Art News in 1953. In Nine Abstract Artists (1954) he promoted the Constructivist artists that emerged in Britain after the Second World War: Robert Adams, Terry Frost, Adrian Heath, Anthony Hill, Roger Hilton, Kenneth Martin, Mary Martin, Victor Pasmore, and William Scott. Alloway's theory of art reflecting the concrete materials of modern life gave way to an interest in mass-media and consumerism. Alloway joined the Independent Group in 1952 and lectured on his theory of a circular link between popular cultural \\"low art\\" and \\"high art\\". From 1955 to 1960 he was Assistant Director of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. He organised the exhibition Collages and Objects (1954). In 1956 Alloway contributed to organising the exhibition This Is Tomorrow. When reviewing that show and other works he had seen on a trip to the US in a 1958 article, he first used the term \\"mass popular art\\". ===Career in the US=== In 1961, through his contacts with the American painter Barnett Newman, Alloway was offered a lecturer position at Bennington College in Vermont. He and his wife, the realist painter Sylvia Sleigh, lived in Bennington for only one year before Alloway was appointed curator at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City, a position he held until 1966. In 1963 he organised the pop art show, Six Painters and the Object. He chaired the jury of the 1964 Guggenheim Awards, one of which was refused by the painter Asger Jorn. In 1966, Alloway curated the influential Systemic Painting exhibition that showcased geometric abstraction in American art via Minimal art, Shaped canvas, and Hard-edge painting. He coined the term Systemic Art to \\"describe a type of abstract art characterized by the use of very simple standardized forms, usually geometric in character, either in a single concentrated image or repeated in a system arranged according to a clearly visible principle of organization\\". Alloway was also an ardent supporter of Abstract expressionism and American Pop artists, such as Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, and Andy Warhol. He resigned from the Guggenheim after Thomas M. Messer, the museum's director, overruled Alloway's selections—consisting mostly of sculptures—for the upcoming Venice Biennale. In 1966-67, Alloway was appointed visiting professor at the School of Fine Arts at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, where John McHale and Buckminster Fuller were also on staff. In the 1970s, Alloway wrote for The Nation and Artforum, and lectured at the State University of New York, Stony Brook where he was appointed professor of art history. There he co-founded the magazine Art Criticism with the critic Donald Kuspit. With the rise of the feminist art movement, Alloway championed the work of women; he noted, for example, \\"a 3-to-1 advantage\\" of men over women in the Whitney Annual in 1977. ===Origins of the term Pop Art=== Concerning the origins of the term Pop Art, Alloway said, \\"The term, originated in England by me, as a description of mass communications, especially, but not exclusively, visual ones.\\" In a footnote to his essay Pop Art the words, he also states, \\"The first published appearance of the terms that I know is: Lawrence Alloway, 'The Arts and the Mass Media,' Architectural Design, February 1958, London. Ideas on Pop Art were discussed by Reyner Banham, Theo Crosby, Frank Cordell, Toni del Renzio, Richard Hamilton, Nigel Henderson, John McHale, Eduardo Paolozzi, Alison and Peter Smithson, sculptor William Turnbull, and myself.\\" However there are contradictory recollections as to the origin of the term: according to John McHale's son his father first coined the term in 1954 in conversation with Frank Cordell, and the term was then used in Independent Group discussions by mid 1955. Alloway used the term 'mass popular art' in his oft quoted 1958 article but he did not use the specific term \\"Pop Art\\" in the piece. ==Death== Alloway suffered from a neurological disorder and died of cardiac arrest on 2 January 1990, aged 63. ==References== ==External links== * Lawrence Alloway papers, 1935–2003.

His clients included rock band Badfinger, musician Al Kooper, and singer Lou Christie. Throughout his career, Polley defrauded a number of clients and associates. ==Biography== Polley was born on April 7, 1922 in New York City. After serving as a corporal in the U.S. Army during World War II, he practiced law and worked in retail shops before beginning his managerial career in New York's garment industry. He began artist management after he met Lou Christie in the mid-1960s. It was through his association with Christie that he met and began working with other artists in the New York and Los Angeles entertainment fields. In 1968, Polley formed a company called Five Arts Management, for his work with singer Lou Christie, musician Al Kooper, arranger Charles Calello, TV director Michael Cooper, composer Sandy Linzer and WABC disc jockey Bob Lewis. He formed further companies for legal and accounting purposes to manage artists including composers Irwin Levine and Larry Brown. In 1970, Polley registered Badfinger Enterprises, Inc. as a corporate entity for management of the British rock group Badfinger, which had no American representation at the time. In 1971 Polley was named during US Senate investigation hearings as an intermediary between unnamed crime figures and a New York Supreme Court judge. Most of Polley's American clients said they were already suspicious of their manager by this point, but the publicity of the hearings convinced several to sever ties with him. In 1972, Polley negotiated a record contract with Warner Bros. Records for Badfinger, which called for advances to be paid into an escrow account. In 1974, Warner's publishing division filed a lawsuit against Polley when it was unsuccessful in locating the funds. The legal morass crippled Badfinger financially; band leader Pete Ham committed suicide on April 24, 1975 leaving behind a note pointing the finger at Polley for his financial ruin. Bandmate Tom Evans committed suicide on November 19, 1983. In 1991, Polley pleaded no contest to charges of misappropriating funds and money laundering in Riverside County, California. Aeronautics engineer Peter Brock accused Polley of swindling him out of $250,000 after the two set up a corporation to manufacture airplane engines. Polley was placed on probation for five years and ordered by the court to return all missing funds to Brock, although the complainant said the restitution never materialized.

The group has defined its mission as to promote human rights and social, economic, and environmental justice around the world. It deals with a wide range of issues ranging from the U.S. war in Iraq to worker abuse and fair trade issues. Global Exchange is a 501(c)(3) organization and its board of directors includes Walter Turner, Wanda Whitaker, Dale Wannen, Deborah James, and Allen Gunn. Since inception, Global Exchange has reached thousands of members and supporters, through educating the U.S. public about what it thinks are the root causes of injustice and the impacts of U.S. government policies and corporate practices. The group builds people-to-people ties, engages grassroots education for action and linking social and environmental movements through public education, speaking tours, experiential travel called Reality Tours and activism. ==History== In 1988, Medea Benjamin, Kevin Danaher, Kirsten Moller, and Kathie Klarreich founded Global Exchange. The formation of the organization was rooted in the increasing interdependence of national economies and the subsequent need to build political alliances across national boundaries to promote the group’s ideas about economic, social and political rights. Along with Rainforest Action Network and the Ruckus Society, Global Exchange played a central role in organizing the 1999 Seattle WTO protests against the World Trade Organization (WTO) summit in Seattle in 1999. In 2001, Global Exchange produced a Green Festival in Seattle, WA. In 2011 Global Exchange released a book called, The Rights of Nature: The Case for a Universal Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth, with articles by Maude Barlow, Pablo Solón Romero, Vandana Shiva, Nnimmo Bassey and others. ==Activities and programs== Global Exchange tries to increase public awareness of what it feels are the root causes of injustice. For this it promotes a change from a profit-oriented global economy to what it calls ‘people-oriented local economies’ which, supposedly, respect the rights of workers and nature. Its Community Rights Program assists communities confronted by corporate projects to assert their right to make decisions, which the group says should be to that place ‘the rights of residents above the legal rights of corporations’. It also focuses on advancing the Rights of Nature, a paradigm shift championed by the World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth held in Cochabamba, Bolivia in 2010, by President Evo Morales. The Economic Activism for Palestine project focuses on corporate accountability for human rights and international law violations in Palestine. The program, with an anti-Zionist focus, targets corporations that are directly involved in Israeli settlement activity in the occupied West Bank. The Fair Trade Program promotes fair trade to end child and forced labor in the cocoa industry, as well as educate consumers to purchase fair trade chocolate. Its corporate campaigns targeted among others Starbucks and M&M;'s. In 2012 Global Exchange joined with Green America and the International Labor Rights Forum to pressure The Hershey Company to go fair trade and end child labor in the Theobroma cacao fields. The campaign is called Raise the Bar, Hershey. Global Exchange was part of a coalition of groups that charged US retailers, including Gap, with illegally underpaying workers in their sweatshops in Saipan. The Mexico Program confronts the rising violence and unrest. The program is described as developing dialogue and effective advocacy toward bilateral military policies, gun trafficking, drug policy and democratic reform. The Elect Democracy campaign challenges corporate money in US politics. The campaign's strategy is to expose the impact of the FIRE economy campaign contributions and to provide factual examples of its belief that a political campaign dependency upon corporate campaign contributions and subsequent corporate lobbying can lead to the prioritization of corporate interests over the needs of the We are the 99%. The ultimate goal of the campaign is to increase accountability through campaign finance reform. The Green Economy Leadership Training (GELT) program ran from 2010-2012 to implement green economy solutions (home weatherization, establishing urban gardens, etc.) while training individuals in how to build, work and live in a new green economy/clean energy framework. GELT was based in Highland Park, a low-income community in Detroit. Dozens of full-time volunteers worked side- by-side with Highland Park community members to put energy efficiency and LEED for Neighborhood Development guidelines into practice, demonstrating what the transition to and opportunities in a clean energy economy look like. Global Exchange gives Reality Tours to various countries of the world with the stated aim of educating the visitor with the realities of living in different cultures. Global Exchange Reality Tours organizes trips to over 30 countries in Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Reality Tours offer experiential educational tours, connecting people to issues, issues to movements, and movements to social change social change. Global Exchange offers legal trips to Cuba for US citizens. As part of their campaign to reduce oil consumption, on November 29, 2006, two protesters from Global Exchange and Rainforest Action Network, Mike Hudema and Matt Leonard, at the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show illegally disrupted a press stage where General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner was speaking and tried to get him to sign a pledge making GM the most fuel-efficient car company by 2010.

It is also the closest station to Edgworth. Unlike nearby the station lies outside the Transport for Greater Manchester boundary, meaning that passengers cannot take advantage of their special offers and ticketing. Owing to the remote location and low passenger numbers, Entwistle has been a request stop for several years. It is served by Northern services on the Manchester Victoria/Bolton 'Ribble Valley' Line towards Blackburn and Clitheroe in England. ==History== The original station opened in August 1848, being relocated from Whittlestone Head station to the north. A more substantial stone building was built in 1859, as part of a larger contract, with similar stations being erected along the branch at The Oaks, Bromley Cross and Turton, by Manchester firm Joseph Greenup and Co. Demolition took place around the mid-1970s, several years after the station closed. The station exhibited a large outside wall platform clock. The 1859 contract was for both a station building and staff 'cottage' as erected at other stations along the branch.original railway co minutes held at National Archives, Kew on RAIL 52/4 The station building was actually more extended than the buildings seen at the other stations, with private dwelling accommodation included for the station master. The 1871 Census of Population revealed that resident at Entwistle Station was SM William Davies, 24, his wife Ann, 23 and infant daughter Mary, 1, plus two family visitors, one being the railway telegraph clerk at Clitheroe.microfilm sheet RG10/3930, 1871 Census of Population, Lancashire CC Record Office By the early 1900s, new accommodation was built for railway workers with the new railway terrace of cottages located on Overshores road, the lane beyond The Strawbury Duck Inn. The 1891 OS map surveyLancashire Sheet 10, survey date 1891, pub. 1893 revealed that only two immediately nearby cottages existed - The Strawbury Duck Inn (then called Bridge House) and also a divided cottage alongside, Bridge Cottages. Entwistle served the Black Hill brickworks and Know Mill, sited where the smaller section of Wayoh reservoir occupies. Until recently the remains of an overhead cable railway, connecting the factory to the railway goods yard, were visible in an adjoining woods. The foundation bases for the supports are still visible in at least two locations. The mills were demolished when the level of the Wayoh Reservoir was raised and the station was reduced in size following the Beeching report of 1963 and the singling of the Bromley Cross to Blackburn section of the line a decade later. Entwistle goods yard closed in November 1959. ==Signal box== Typically for this branch line, a Yardley/Smith type 1 brick signal box opened here in 1876, situated on the Down side north of the station, containing an 18 lever Smith frame. This box was replaced in Jan 1904 by a new 60 lever, gantry-mounted size 12 L&YR; box, in connection with the quadrupling of the line through to Waltons Siding 1453 yds to the north. Numerous highly detailed large scale original drawings survive for these track and related works from the early 1900sL&YR; Entwistle - widening of line (7 plans), 1904, at ref A19/4/22. (with other plans available) Greater Manchester County Record Office, Central Library Included with the plans is a letter sent by the railway company secretary to The Board of Trade in April 1904 which discloses that 'the old station has been reconstructed. It now consists of an island platform 596 feet long.' It is also revealed that the station is on a gradient of 1 in 77. The authorisation for it was the L&YR; Act of 1897. The signal box spanned the fast running lines and it is reported that it was a very draughty place of work, with its floorboards lifting like piano keys when a loco steaming hard passed underneath it. The box closed in 1968 when the through fast lines were taken out of use. ==Media appearances== The station has been used as a location for filming on more than one occasion: In the 1986 film adaptation of Jeffrey Archer's novel First Among Equals, the sequences at the fictional Redfern Station were filmed there. In Episode 2 of Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere, the station featured as \\"Middlewood station\\" (not to be confused with a real life station of the same name on the Buxton Line) due to its supposedly rural backwater location. ==Services== Generally there is an hourly service daily northbound to Clitheroe and southbound to Manchester Victoria,GB eNRT May 20 Edition, Table 94. ==References== ==External links== Category:West Pennine Moors Category:Railway stations in Blackburn with Darwen Category:Former Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1848 Category:Northern franchise railway stations Category:Railway request stops in Great Britain ","title":"Entwistle railway station"},{"id":"2576869","text":"'Mazing Man is the title character of a comic book series created by Bob Rozakis and Stephen DeStefano and published by DC Comics.* BobRo Archives: Centurions - A Thirty-Year-Old Interview Transcript of an interview with WCEYE. Blog post by Bob Rozakis, March 4, 2016 The series ran for twelve issues in 1986, with additional special issues in 1987, 1988, and 1990. In addition, 'Mazing Man had an origin story in Secret Origins #16, and an original one-page story that appeared in an ad in Comics Buyer's Guide. == Series overview == The 'Mazing Man series depicts the misadventures of Sigfried Horatio Hunch III, a benignly deranged little man in Queens, New York City, New York who dresses in a homemade costume and performs deeds like unclogging drains and watching out for local children. Viewed as a harmless kook by his neighbors, he saves a child from being hit by a truck in the first issue, earning him some respect and notoriety, not to mention a steady stream of appreciation (and food) from the mother in subsequent issues. \\"'Maze\\" tends to sing Simon and Garfunkel songs when struck on the head. His best friend is Denton Fixx, a writer for BC Comics who looks like a beagle. Hunch is a millionaire, having won first place in a magazine subscription company's sweepstakes. After winning the prize, he felt obligated to subscribe to all of the company's magazines. As a result, he receives a staggering load of publications daily, including the pornographic magazines that he genuinely reads only for the articles. He does not keep his wealth a secret per se; he simply does not mention it and does not live an opulent lifestyle. His friends are unaware of his financial success. ==Reception== The original series, although highly acclaimed, was short-lived. However, comics artist Frank Miller admired the series. Eager to help the property survive, Miller contributed a cover with the lead characters of the extremely popular mini- series Batman: The Dark Knight Returns for the last issue. The resulting exposure created enough interest for three subsequent one-shot issues. A back- up feature, \\"Zoot Sputnik\\", drawn by Fred Hembeck and (ostensibly) written by Denton Fixx, appeared for several issues; it was supposed to be the book Fixx wrote for BC Comics. \\"Zoot Sputnik\\" was a parody of the Golden Age narrative style where stories had no between-issue continuity — Zoot and his team were space adventurers in one issue and cowboys in the next. The team's dog received a shock of energy and gained the ability to remember their disparate adventures. This was Denton's attempt to introduce continuity to the book, but it was met with disapproval by his editor. 'Mazing Man is one of a handful of DC titles to publish an issue not featuring the Comics Code Authority stamp of approval while it was active. In the issue \\"Writer's Block\\", Denton is stuck for a story, and all his friends give their ideas. One of them dealt with an army of zombies. Although there was no gore or violence, any mention of the living dead, specifically the use of the word \\"zombie\\", was forbidden by the Comics Code. The issue was released without the seal, with no publicity, positive or negative. Much later, in the Ambush Bug: Year None miniseries, 'Mazing Man (in the same nonsensical way of the series) is revealed to be on death row. == Other characters == ;Denton Fixx : 'Maze's best friend.

Finegold was born in Detroit, Michigan into a chess family, the son of chess master Ron Finegold and his wife Rita. Stuart Rachels says when he was twelve he saw Ben Finegold and his father Ron hustling in a chess club at Manhattan, offering 8-1 money bets on one-minute-per-player bullet games. Finegold became a USCF master at the age of 14, life master at 15, senior master at 16, international master at 20, and grandmaster at 40. Finegold said he had played in hundreds of tournament games a year when he was young: \\"I loved chess and if I lost it did not matter to me. That's the main thing you have to do to get better at chess - if you lose hundreds of games in a row, that's OK\\". Finegold tied for first place in the 1994 (Chicago, Illinois) and 2007 (Cherry Hill, New Jersey) U.S. Open Chess Championships. He tied for first (and achieved a grandmaster norm) in the 2002 World Open (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), and also tied for first in the 2005 and 2008 National Open Chess Championships (Las Vegas, Nevada). He was ranked as one of the top 40 players in the United States on the August 2013 USCF rating list.

In September 2009, he earned the grandmaster title. He was the grandmaster-in- residence of the Saint Louis Chess Club (formerly the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis) until August 14, 2012, where he filmed a number of chess YouTube videos. He has been a live commentator at the US Chess Championship, U.S. Junior Chess Championship and Sinquefield Cup, and he frequently gave lively and often humorous instructional lectures at the Saint Louis Chess Club.

FRUs allow a technician lacking in-depth product knowledge to isolate faults and replace faulty components. The granularity of FRUs in a system impacts total cost of ownership and support, including the costs of stocking spare parts, where spares are deployed to meet repair time goals, how diagnostic tools are designed and implemented, levels of training for field personnel, whether end- users can do their own FRU replacement, etc. ==Other equipment== FRUs are not strictly confined to computers but are also part of many high-end, lower- volume consumer and commercial products. For example, in military aviation, electronic components of line-replaceable units, typically known as shop- replaceable units (SRUs), are repaired at field-service backshops, usually by a \\"remove and replace\\" repair procedure, with specialized repair performed at centralized depot or by the OEM. ==History== Many vacuum tube computers had FRUs: *Pluggable units containing one or more vacuum tubes and various passive components Most transistorized and integrated circuit-based computers had FRUs: *Computer modules, circuit boards containing discrete transistors and various passive components. Examples: **IBM SMS cards **DEC System Building Blocks cards **DEC Flip-Chip cards *Circuit boards containing monolithic ICs and/or hybrid ICs, such as IBM SLT cards. Vacuum tubes themselves are usually FRUs. For a short period starting in the late 1960s, some television set manufacturers made solid-state televisions with FRUs instead of a single board attached to the chassis. However modern televisions put all the electronics on one large board to reduce manufacturing costs. ==Trends== As the sophistication and complexity of multi-replaceable unit electronics in both commercial and consumer industries have increased, many design and manufacturing organizations have expanded the use of the FRU storage device. Storage is no longer limited to simply identification of the FRU itself, but now also comprises back-up copies of critical system information such as system serial numbers, MAC address and even security information. Some systems will fail to function at all without each FRU in the system being ratified at start-up. Today one cannot assume that the FRU storage device is only used to maintain the FRU ID of the part. ==Notes== Category:Electronic engineering Category:Maintenance ","title":"Field-replaceable unit"},{"id":"2576893","text":"Harare Sports Club is a sports club and the Harare Sports Club Ground is a cricket stadium in Harare, Zimbabwe. Founded in 1900 and known as Salisbury Sports Club until 1982, it is mostly used for cricket matches, and has served as the primary cricket venue in Rhodesia and Zimbabwe since its foundation. Other sports played at the club are rugby, tennis, golf and squash. ==History== The earliest recorded first-class cricket match at Salisbury Sports Club was played in 1910. In the years between World War II and independence from the United Kingdom, the ground hosted several of Rhodesia's home matches in the Currie Cup, South Africa's main domestic first-class competition. The first List A match at the ground was played in September 1980, shortly after independence. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the ground frequently hosted first-class and List A matches between the Zimbabwe national team and touring national 'A', 'B' and youth teams. In July 1992, Zimbabwe became a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC), thus obtaining Test status. Three months later, Harare Sports Club hosted the country's inaugural Test match, against India. Soon after, the ground played host to its first One Day International, also against India. In February 1995, HSC was the site of Zimbabwe's first-ever Test win, against Pakistan.Heatley, pp. 191. ==The venue== The ground is surrounded by Jacaranda trees and with a beautiful gabled pavilion, Harare Sports Club is in the heart of the city. It is bordered by the heavily guarded presidential palace on one side and the prestigious Royal Harare Golf Club on another. The venue hosted Zimbabwe's first Test in October 1992 and has been the country's major Test and one-day venue since. Although the club itself does not possess any of the major stands associated with major sports grounds, the capacity of around 10,000 can be increased by the use of temporary stands a record crowd of 26,000 saw Rhodesia play the MCC in 1956.Heatley, pp. 191. However, that capacity is rarely tested and in recent times only the 2014 Zimbabwe Tri-Series, involving Australia and South Africa, and the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier have drawn sizeable crowds.

DDMS is loosely based on the Dublin Core vocabulary. DDMS defines discovery metadata elements for resources posted to community and organizational shared spaces. It is sometimes (incorrectly) referred to as DoD Discovery Metadata Standard. The project focuses both on the process of developing a central taxonomy for metadata, and defining a way of discovering resources by their metadata using that taxonomy. The DDMS was created in support of the DoD Net-Centric Data Strategy (dated May 9, 2003), and specifies a set of information fields that are to be used to describe any data or service asset that is made known to the DoD Enterprise. The elements in the DDMS are designed to be platform, language, and implementation-independent, and the specification is described with an XML Schema. ==Structure== The DDMS is designed using a layered approach, combining a Core Layer and an Extensible Layer surrounded by the DDMS Resource Header. The Core Layer is composed of five sets of element categories, each with a specific functional focus for describing a data asset: * The Metacard elements describe the DDMS resource itself. * The Security elements enable the description of security classification of the described resource, Need-to-Know (NTK) information, and related notices. * The Resource elements enable the description of maintenance and administration information. * The Summary Content elements enable the description of concepts and topics. * The Format elements enable the description of physical attributes of the asset. * The Extensible Layer is designed to support domain-specific or Community of Interest (COI) discovery metadata requirements, and can be used to extend the element categories identified in the Core Layer. Extensions are expected to be registered in the DoD Metadata Registry. Extensible attribute spaces are also provided on some elements. ==Versioning== The DDMS is currently on version 5.0 released on January 14, 2013. This is the first version to recast DDMS within the bounds of the Intelligence Community's Trusted Data Format specification. In this paradigm, the DDMS metacard is not a standalone top-level construct. Instead, it is a single assertion which decorates a Trusted Data Object, and which is incomplete on its own. DDMS 5.0 also replaces the Geography Markup Language (GML) profile for geospatial information with Time-Space Position Information v2.0 (TSPI).

The area is inhabited by some 15,000 Amerindians. ==Biodiversity== The savannah is divided north from south, by the Kanuku Mountains, Guyana’s most biologically diverse region. According to Conservation International, the \\"area supports a large percentage of Guyana’s biodiversity\\", including 250 species of bird life, 18 of which are native \\"only to the lowland forests of the Guianas.\\" The savannah is teeming with wildlife, including a large variety of bird species. The savannah is also home to the jaguar as well as the Harpy Eagle, the world’s most powerful bird of prey, an extremely rare and endangered species which once ranged the forests of South America and is found in the Rupununi/Kanuku mountain range. ==Population== The Rupununi is the home of the Wapishana, Macushi, Wai-Wai and Patamona peoples.Rupununi people A recent survey recorded a population of 14,689 Amerindians. The Wapishana live mainly in the south savannah, the Macushi in the north. Some 200 Wai-Wai live in near isolation in the remote southeastern region bordering Brazil virtually untouched by modern life. The major occupations or industries in the Rupununi Savannah are cattle ranching for beef, Balatá bleeding to extract latex; farming groundnuts, maize (corn), cassava, and vegetables; fishing and hunting; and craft work such as the manufacture of hammocks, leather articles, Nibbi furniture and beadwork). There are Amerindian villages dotted throughout the Rupununi Savannah, as well as many ranches worked by vaqueros (cowboys), some of whom are descendants of 19th century Scottish settlers. The main town is Lethem, located beside the Takutu River, on the border with Brazil. Owing to the savanna's remoteness from the rest of the country most trade is conducted with Brazil and most people speak Portuguese.

The film was directed by Tom Shadyac, written by Steve Oedekerk, based on the characters created by Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe from the original film. It stars Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman reprising their roles as Evan Baxter and God, respectively, with newcomers Lauren Graham and John Goodman. Production of the film began in January 2006. Several visual effect companies were used to provide CGI for the numerous animals and the climactic flood scene. The main plot is a modern-day retelling of Noah's Ark. By the time the film had completed production, it had become the most expensive comedy film ever (this record was later overtaken by Men in Black 3). In October 2007, the film was released on DVD and HD DVD. The film opened on June 22, 2007, and made less than its budget of $175 million worldwide, while receiving generally negative reviews from critics. Evan Almighty was also a box-office bomb. PETA alleged that the animals used in the film were treated poorly, but Universal Pictures insisted the animals were treated humanely. ==Plot== Newly elected to Congress, former local television news reporter Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) leaves his hometown of Buffalo, New York, and later moves to the community of Prestige Crest, located in the fictional town of Huntsville, Virginia, where his congressional campaign officially declares that he will change the world. Evan prays to God (Morgan Freeman) to give him this opportunity. His wife, Joan (Lauren Graham), also prays that she, Evan and their three sons Dylan (Johnny Simmons), Jordan (Graham Phillips) and Ryan (Jimmy Bennett) will be closer together as a family. On his first day, Evan receives a letter from his greedy boss, Congressman Chuck Long (John Goodman), who provides him with a prime office and the opportunity to join Long as the junior co-sponsor to his Citizens' Integration of Public Lands Act (CINPLAN) bill. Over the next several days, strange events in Evan's life occur: * Eight vacant lots in Prestige Crest are purchased under his name, and ancient tools and gopher wood are delivered there. * Pairs of animals start following him around everywhere he goes. * He uncontrollably starts growing a beard that keeps instantly growing back no matter how many times he shaves. * The number 614 starts appearing in various forms throughout his daily routines. Evan comes to realize that this number actually refers to verse 14 in chapter 6 of the Book of Genesis, where God instructs Noah to build an ark in preparation for a coming flood. Although Evan initially rejects this idea, God himself starts appearing to Evan in various guises, assuring him that a flood will come and the only way Evan can change the world will be to build the ark. Evan himself decides to start building the ark with the tools and materials provided, giving him an opportunity to get closer to his sons, although Joan sees this as a midlife crisis. Although Evan still maintains his career in Congress, his appearance alienates his three staffers, Rita Daniels (Wanda Sykes), Marty Stringer (John Michael Higgins), and Eugene Tennanbaum (Jonah Hill), and the animals that follow him everywhere become very disruptive. God reappears and provides Evan a robe, and warns him the flood will come mid-day on September 22. When Evan dons the robe, he finds he is unable to wear any other clothes, the robe seemingly displacing anything else he wears. Outraged by Evan's slothful appearance, Long has his name removed from the Public Land Act bill. Believing that Evan has gone insane, Joan leaves him, causing Evan to continue building the ark alone. God later disguises himself as a waiter and speaks to Joan in a restaurant, assuring her that she should see this as an opportunity for the entire family to get closer to each other. Joan is inspired and finally returns with the kids to help Evan finish the ark to prepare for the flood. On September 22, Evan's staffers show him evidence that Long had planned to build Prestige Crest after damming off a nearby water source, but Long had cut many corners in building the dam. The staffers suspect Long would do the same with the Public Land Act Bill. With the ark complete, the police try to destroy it with a wrecking ball, as it violates land codes. As animals start to load the ark, and rain falls, Evan realizes that the flood will be a result of Long's dam failing. He warns the onlookers to get aboard the ark as the dam indeed breaks, destroying all of Prestige Crest. The ark later floods the streets of Washington, D.C. and comes to a halt in front of the Capitol, interrupting the vote for the Public Land Act Bill. This results in Evan accusing Long's cost- cutting of being responsible for the dam's failure, leading to several other members of Congress voting against the bill. Long is investigated for profiteering, while all the animals are returned to their natural habitats. Evan is finally reinstated in Congress, with all the changes forced on him by God are no longer remaining. Evan re-encounters God during a hike, and God states that Evan's life is now perfect as he prayed for, being closer to his family and having changed the world for the better through his one Act of Random Kindness (ARK). ==Cast== * Steve Carell as Evan Baxter, a former news reporter who is now a congressman * Morgan Freeman as God * Lauren Graham as Joan Baxter, Evan's wife * John Goodman as Congressman Chuck Long, a senior congressman * John Michael Higgins as Marty Stringer, Evan's chief of staff * Jimmy Bennett as Ryan Baxter, Evan and Joan's youngest son * Graham Phillips as Jordan Baxter, Evan and Joan's middle son * Johnny Simmons as Dylan Baxter, Evan and Joan's oldest son * Wanda Sykes as Rita Daniels, Evan's assistant * Jonah Hill as Eugene Tennanbaum, one of Evan's staffers * Molly Shannon as Eve Adams, the Baxters' real estate agent * Ed Helms as Ark Reporter * Rachael Harris as Ark Reporter * Brian Howe as Builder * Harve Presnell as Congressman Burrows * Madison Mason as Congressman Dodd * Bruce Gray as Congressman Hughes * Paul Collins as Congressman Stamp * Jim Doughan and Meagen Fay as Neighbors * Dean Norris as Officer Collins * Jon Stewart has a cameo appearance as himself * Catherine Bell as Susan Ortega (Uncredited) * Maile Flanagan as Mail Carrier * Lisa Arch and Simon Helberg as staffers * David Barrera and Ed Helms as Ark reporters * Ruth Williamson as neighbor * Jim Doughan as neighbor * Michael Roper as Congressional Reporter * Emily Eby as Animal Wrangler * Bart the Bear 2 and Honey Bump as bears ==Production== ===Screenplay=== The film's screenplay was originally titled The Passion of the Ark and was written by Bobby Florsheim and Josh Stolberg. It became the subject of a seven-studio bidding war in April 2004. The script was sold to Sony Pictures in a deal worth $2,500,000 plus a percentage of the profits, a record for a spec script from previously unproduced writers. Universal Studios immediately made a deal to co-produce the script with Sony and have Steve Oedekerk rewrite it into the sequel to Bruce Almighty. Steve Oedekerk had been involved with Bruce Almighty as an executive producer and co-writer of the screenplay (with Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe, who wrote the story). The studio later discarded the original The Passion of the Ark script completely, and Oedekerk fashioned a new script from scratch (only he received final credit on the finished film as screenwriter). Jim Carrey was asked to reprise his role as Bruce in the sequel and, when he declined, director Tom Shadyac convinced Steve Carell to accept the leading role. Shadyac, reflecting on the first film, stated \\"[Carell] delivered some of the funniest stuff in the movie. We thought, 'Why not take that character and spin him off into a different film?'\\" ===Casting=== Jim Carrey declined to reprise his role from the original Bruce Almighty. Although Carrey did act in a sequel to Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, he has said that he is \\"not a big fan of doing the same character twice.\\" This marked the third time a sequel has been made to a film for which Carrey declined to reprise his role; the others being Dumb and Dumberer and Son of the Mask. ===Budget=== The initial budget, at approximately $140 million, led Evan Almighty to become the most expensive comedy film ever made. Added costs such as set construction, visual effects, and problems with filming multiple animals in a controlled location brought the budget up to $175 million. Once marketing for the film was also included, the film's entire spend was estimated to be around $200 million. The ballooning budget caused Sony to drop the project and hand it over entirely to Universal Studios. Part of the budget was Carell's payroll, where he earned a reported $5 million for his leading role. The Virginia Film Office estimates the film brought $20–25 million to Virginia, with the majority of it in the Charlottesville area. Universal defended the cost of the film, saying it was \\"designed as a four-quadrant film, and therefore poised for bigger [box office] returns than typical comedies.\\" ===Ark design and construction=== The ark being prepared for filming a scene Construction of the ark began in January 2006 and the scenes involving the ark were shot in a Crozet, Virginia subdivision called Old Trail. The ark was designed to meet the actual measurements of the biblical ark, measuring long, wide, and high. The ark's layout was also based on pictures in several children's books that crew members had read in their childhoods. When the characters were filmed during the day building the ark or were on location elsewhere, crew members would further construct the ark at night. A concrete base was built to support the weight of the large ark; after filming was completed, the ark was taken down in a week, and the base in another week. In disassembling the set, everything that was salvageable from the ark was donated to Habitat for Humanity. \\"Leave no trace\\" was the slogan used by the director as part of the DVD's bonus features, \\"The Almighty Green Set\\". ===Costumes and filming locations=== The Ark used for filming was located in Crozet, Virginia. To create Evan's beard and long hair, three designers would take three hours each day adding individual hairs using prosthetic adhesive and making Carell wear custom wigs. The wigs consisted of both human and yak hair. With his new look, Carell was sometimes nicknamed \\"Mountain Man\\", \\"Retrosexual\\", or \\"Unabomber.\\" For his costumes, designers spoke with textile experts, researched historical information on the clothing that was likely worn at the time of Noah, and used aged fibers for the clothing. Scenes for the film were filmed in various locations in Virginia, including areas in and around Crozet, Waynesboro, Richmond, Charlottesville, and Staunton, though some filming did take place at Universal Studios in Hollywood, California. ===Effects=== For the CGI used throughout the film, companies Rhythm & Hues (R&H;) and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) developed different parts of the film. R&H; focused on the animation of the animals, while ILM completed the final scene of the ark rushing through Washington D.C. Lindy De Quattro, the ILM associate visual effects supervisor, revealed that \\"This is the first time where we had to do a whole series of shots that were happening mid-day, where you were going to get a really long look at the water and what it was doing.\\" The company initially experienced problems creating the water effects and had to develop new tools which would choreograph the movements of the water. In addition, ILM used similar tools that were used on their prior film Poseidon. Lighting was also an issue as the characters on the ark had been filmed on a greenscreen stage, and the visual effects company had to ensure that the lighting matched that of the characters and the outside setting. Details were added to the ark for long-distance shots to make the design of the ark more appealing and relate the ark's size to scale in comparison to the amount of water. To complete the scene, ILM used thirty to sixty crew members and produced 200 shots over a yearlong period between April 2006 and May 2007. Signage on a lamppost in downtown Waynesboro, Virginia for Evan Almighty filming. Rhythm & Hues created 300 pairs of animals for use on the ark and fifteen pairs with higher detail for closeup shots. R&H; was also assisted by C.I.S. Hollywood, another visual effects company, who provided a large number of composites, involving hundreds of greenscreen animal elements. In scenes where there are multiple species of animals, crew members would film the animals on the greenscreen and R&H; and C.I.S would digitally add the animals one at a time, sometimes taking several weeks to a couple of months. Andy Arnett, the animation supervisor, declared that \\"The research was extensive. It took six or seven months to perfect the look and feel of the animals before we had the first shot out the door.\\" For the scene in Congressman Long's office, CGI was used the entire time for the fish that follow Evan around from the fish tank. Cafe FX, the visual effects company hired for the scene, ordered ten different kinds of tropical fish from a local store and studied their movements to imitate them on screen using computer animation. Jeff Goldman, the visual effects supervisor, stated \\"Early in the sequence, we mimicked the actual behavior of the fish in our animation, but as the scene plays out, the fish are a counterpoint to Steve Carell's comedic timing.\\" ==Marketing== In late May during production, the media learned that director Tom Shadyac angrily complained to producers, saying \\"I'm not seeing any ads, and I don't know why. I'm not getting answers. People are giving me information that isn't true ... I'm only hearing about all the other summer movies, and nothing about mine.\\" Shadyac also fired his marketing consultants that he had used for prior films due to his thoughts over the mishandling of the marketing. He later apologized for his outburst with producers, and claimed that it was as a result of his nervousness before the film's release. Grace Hill Media, a marketing firm that targets religious Americans and was also used for marketing Bruce Almighty, The Da Vinci Code, and The Passion of the Christ; held exclusive screenings of the film in mid- June in fifty cities in the United States to reach religious moviegoers. Grace Hill provided free screenings to blogs in exchange for publicity on the blogs. The film and its subsequent home video release was marketed to Christians and their churches through a \\"kindness campaign\\" called Ark ALMIGHTY.Ark ALMIGHTY, a \\"kindness campaign\\" that was part of the promotion of the film The first trailer of the film premiered on March 29, 2007 for a marathon of The Office, which also stars Steve Carell and Ed Helms. For online advertising, an eight- minute clip of a scene was released on Yahoo! two days before the release of the film. == Environmental impact == Director Tom Shadyac felt the film reflected environmental themes of how humans are stewards of God's creation. In keeping with the themes, Evan Almighty became NBC Universal's first film to offset the production's carbon emissions. Producer Michael Bostick revealed how the emissions were offset: > We worked closely with The Conservation Fund to calculate our carbon > emissions from what we used on the movie—whether from vehicles used or any > of the construction equipment. Once our carbon emissions were calculated, we > planted trees that will effectively zero out our climate-changing footprint > left behind from the movie. Shadyac accomplished this by requiring crew members to plant 2,050 trees at the Rappahannock River Valley National Wildlife Refuge in Warsaw, Virginia and the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge near Modesto, California. He also bought over 400 bikes for all the cast and crew, to get to work instead of driving. In addition, rather than simply demolishing sets, Shadyac tried to donate houses built for the production and had the Ark set recycled, by donating materials to Habitat for Humanity. During the premiere of the film for cast and crew at Universal Citywalk, the attendees were encouraged to donate to a campaign to plant trees in forests around the world. The after party used recycled cups and plates to offset the use of resources. Shadyac also required that when Industrial Light & Magic developed the climactic scene, that the CGI flood did not appear to harm any of the trees in the scene. The film partnered with the website Get On Board Now, which focused on the importance of conservation during production of the film. Donations were taken at the website for The Conservation Fund, which paid for the planting of 15,000 trees. ==Animal welfare== Two elephants being trained for filming The American Humane Association oversaw the 177 species of animals that were used in the film. In scenes including both predators and prey, the animals were digitally added instead to ensure their safety. The American Humane Association gave its permission for the film to display \\"No animals were harmed in the making of this movie\\" over the closing credits. PETA accused the film's producers of using animals that had previously been abused. Two chimpanzees who appear in the film, Cody and Sable, were surrendered by their owner to settle a lawsuit that documented allegations of beatings and mistreatment. The film's director, Tom Shadyac, said of PETA's criticisms \\"many of these animals have been rescued from other situations and can't be returned to the wild\\" and \\"There's a certain amount of hypocrisy whenever you work with animals, even to show, which we hope we're showing, that respect of all of God's creation ... I don't know. I respect their criticism.\\" PETA was also critical of Birds & Animals Unlimited, the primary animal supplier to the film, for alleged serious and continuing violations of the U.S. Animal Welfare Act, including failure to comply with veterinary care requirements and failure to provide shelter from heat and sunlight, which PETA details and claims it can document. A Universal Studios spokesperson declared: > The live animals used in the filming of Evan Almighty were supplemented by a > great number of computer-generated animals, but it would have been > impossible to depend on CGI exclusively as some key scenes in the film > demonstrate the need for peaceful and productive co-existence between man > and animals. One of the most prominent, inescapable messages of the film is > the responsibility that humans have to protect and care for animals. ==Release== The premiere for the film was held on June 10, 2007 and guests included Adam Sandler, David Hasselhoff, Kate Flannery, Eddie Murphy, Kevin James, and Mindy Kaling, among others. ===Home media=== The film was released on HD DVD and DVD on October 9, 2007 and was the fourth-most rented DVD of the week earning $6.4 million. In the film's first six weeks of release it earned $27,676,676 in domestic DVD sales. The HD-DVD and DVD's special features include deleted scenes, outtakes, cast interviews, and footage of the animals used in the film. The film was released on Blu-ray on August 7, 2012. ===Proposed ban=== Malaysia's Muslim Consumers Association (PPIM) called for a ban on the film, claiming it is offensive to Islam. Secretary-General Maamor Osman claimed that the film was depicting the great flood as comedy and characterized God with the portrayal of a human, both of which are considered blasphemous in Islam. Similarly there was some public protest against Bruce Almighty being shown in theaters, but that movie was released on DVD and was also shown on television broadcasts. Evan Almighty was still released in Malaysia on August 23, 2007. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== Evan Almighty received generally negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 23%, based on 195 reviews, with an average rating of 4.48/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Big on special effects but short on laughs, Evan Almighty underutilizes a star-studded cast that includes Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on reviews from 33 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \\"A-\\" on scale of A to F. In his review of the film, Richard Roeper commended Jim Carrey for declining to reprise his role in \\"three of the worst sequels of all time\\", which included Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd, Son of the Mask and Evan Almighty. He continued: \\"Evan Almighty is a paper-thin alleged comedy with a laugh drought of biblical proportions, and a condescendingly simplistic spiritual message.\\" Several reviewers credit Carell's performance to significantly improving the humor of the film. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone declared the film the year's Worst Epic on his list of the Worst Movies of 2007. Before Evan Almighty was released, it was nominated for \\"Best Summer Movie You Haven't Seen Yet\\" at the 2007 MTV Movie Awards. Competing against seven other nominees, it lost to Transformers. According to box office figures, the film is the second highest- grossing film about \\"Supernatural Comedies with Religious Elements\\" according to Box Office Mojo, directly behind Bruce Almighty. Evan Almighty was nominated for the Worst Prequel or Sequel, but lost to Daddy Day Camp. ===Box office=== Though Evan Almighty was well hyped, especially with churchgoers, and had double the budget of Bruce Almighty, it performed under expectations. On its first weekend, it opened in 5,200 screens in 3,604 theaters and earned $31.1 million (on its first two days the film earned $11.4 million followed by $8.3 million on Sunday). The opening was less than half of the first film's $68 million weekend ($85 million counting Memorial Day). Nikki Rocco, the president of distribution for Universal Pictures declared, \\"We never expected it to be much higher ... it is not unusual for family films to open at a level like this and build. This film will have legs.\\" The film managed to remain at the third spot at the box office in its second week, before dropping to fifth place in its third week. Internationally, the film also opened in first place in Russia and Ukraine, earning $1.5 million in Russia with 329 venues and $179,000 in Ukraine at 64 locations. The gross in the opening weekends for the two countries was 10% and 11%, respectively, bigger than the opening for Bruce Almighty. Altogether, the film has earned $173,418,781 worldwide with $100,462,298 in the U.S. and $72,956,483 in the international box office. ==Soundtrack== Evan Almighty: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture debuted in 2007. The soundtrack debuted on June 19, 2007. \\"Revolution\\" was performed by Rascal Flatts in the film. Their version is not on the soundtrack, but it appears as a bonus track on their album Still Feels Good.

Before the HSNF was established, much of the land was abandoned agricultural land with rapidly eroding soils. These rolling hills are now covered with loblolly and shortleaf pines, and upland hardwoods. The Civilian Conservation Corps used loblolly pine because it was easy to plant, was suitable for the depleted soils of the north central hills, and cast a large load of needles to help prevent further erosion.US Forest Service-Holly Springs District The land owned by the Forest Service is intermingled with private farms and woodlots. The district ranger for the HSNF is headquartered in Oxford, Mississippi. In 1983, the Reagan administration proposed auctioning off the entire national forest to private bidders as part of a nationwide asset management program. The plan was largely abandoned. ==Location== The HSNF is located in northern Mississippi and is divided into two major sections. The largest section lies to the southeast of the city of Holly Springs and straddles U.S. Highway 78. The second section , sits about southwest of the main section, in Yalobusha County, between Coffeeville and Oakland, just east of Interstate 55.

In terms of the Darkover timeline, The Shattered Chain takes place about ten years before Thendara House. The Shattered Chain is the first Darkovan novel to explore the world of the Renunciates - the Free Amazons or comhii letzi. The Renunciates are women who, despite living in a deeply patriarchal and feudal culture, have renounced both the protection and control of men, cutting their hair and living apart, vowing never to marry di catenas with a man. The Shattered Chain is divided into three parts, the first titled 'Rohana Ardais: Comynara', the second 'Magda Lorne: Terran Agent' and the third, 'Jaelle n'ha Melora: Free Amazon', and each follows one female character's experiences with the Free Amazons of Darkover. ==Plot summary== ===Part I: Rohana Ardais, Comynara=== Lady Rohana Ardais, a Comyn woman of middle-age who possesses psychic laran abilities, specifically telepathy, travels with a band of Renunciates to the city of Shainsa. She hopes to free her kinswoman, Melora, who was kidnapped ten years earlier by a Dry Town raider. In the desert Dry Towns, women are literally owned by men and kept in chains as property. While the women manage to free the heavily pregnant Melora and her twelve-year-old daughter Jaelle, Melora dies giving birth to a son, leaving Jaelle in the care of Rohana. Jaelle rejects the Comyn life, rather choosing to stay with the Renunciates. The section ends with the Jaelle's request of her new foster-mother, Kindra: \\"Foster-mother, will you cut my hair?\\" Rohana's experiences with the Renunciates and in the Dry Towns profoundly change her self-perception as a woman, and of the relationship between the sexes. ===Part II: Magda Lorne, Terran Agent=== Twelve years later, Terran agent Magda Lorne assumes Renunciate disguise under the direction of Rohana, in order to save her ex-husband, Peter Haldane, from kidnappers (who believe he is Rohana's son). Just as Rohana's journey to rescue Melora was prompted by her male kin's refusal to jeopardize the Domains' political relationship with the Dry Towns, Magda's Terran employers refuse to rescue Peter for similar reasons. Magda travels alone, hoping to escape notice. She comes across a group of genuine Renunciates led by the now- adult Jaelle. Magda's deceit is uncovered, and she is forced to take the Renunciate oath, the traditional punishment for a woman who takes the guise of a Renunciate without actually being one. Magda agrees to enter Nevarsin Guild House to begin training as a Renunciate, but secretly intends to escape and continue with the original rescue plan. Shortly after parting from the other Renunciates, Magda and Jaelle are attacked by bandits. Jaelle is seriously injured. Magda must choose whether to abandon Jaelle and hold true to her responsibility to her ex-husband, or to uphold her oath to the Renunciates and to the injured Jaelle. Magda chooses to do both, taking Jaelle with her into the mountains, rescuing Peter, and then traveling with both to the Ardais estate. Magda's conflict and eventual decision to abide by her oath to Jaelle and to the Renunciates echoes Rohana's earlier inner conflict in choosing whether to leave her life for the Renunciates or to continue in her life as Comyn nobility. Rohana chooses to continue as a noblewoman, but uses her position as head of a domain for good, taking her epileptic husband's place in the Comyn council and running her estate. Magda eventually chooses to pursue the life of a Renunciate. ===Part III: Jaelle n'ha Melora, Free Amazon=== Jaelle, Magda and Peter shelter for the winter at the mountain estate of Ardais, with Rohana, her husband and children. Peter meets the aggressive and intimidating Kyril Ardais, his doppelganger twin, the man the bandits has intended to kidnap. Jaelle learns that Rohana has chosen to remain a traditional Comyn woman to protect her children from her husband's enraged outbursts, and protect her epileptic husband from himself. Her experiences with the Renunciates have freed her, even if she has chosen a traditional path. Jaelle chooses to become freemate to Peter, and questions both her choice to become a Renunciate at a young age, along with the decision to ignore her developing laran. In the spring, Jaelle, Magda, and Peter return to Thendara, where Jaelle must face her responsibility as an heir to a Comyn domain with powerful and untrained laran. Magda must decide whether to honors her oath to the Renunciates and to her now-dear friend Jaelle, or returns to the Terran zone to continue her work as translator and agent. Jaelle seeks a third choice, choosing to live with Peter as freemates in the Terran zone in Thendara, undertaking Magda's role as translator. Magda chooses to comply with her Renunciate oath, agreeing to train at Thendara Guildhouse. The women's stories are completed in the sequel novel, Thendara House. ==Characters== *Jaelle n'ha Melora (aka Jaelle Aillard), a Renunciate *Magda Lorne (aka Margali n'ha Yasbet), a Terran operative *Peter Haldane, Magda's ex-husband, a Terran intelligence officer *Rohana Ardais, wife of Gabriel Ardais *Melora Aillard, mother of Jaelle *Kindra, a Renunciate *Jalak of Shainsa, Dry Town bandit ==Gender and society == The Shattered Chain presents the Renunciate organization and worldview in greater detail than previous books in the series. The first free Amazon character that Bradley created, Kyla Raineach in The Planet Savers, was a two-dimensional caricature who ended up rather conventionally falling in love with her male employer. As the series developed, the Renunciates evolved into a complex experiment in separatist feminism. The Renunciates are one of the most popular character groups in the Darkover series, resulting in a considerable amount fan fiction, some of which ended up in the 12 short story anthologies. The Shattered Chain is a distinct deviation from the male-dominated narratives of Bradley's previous Darkovan novels, and also as an experiment in feminist writing for an author who had previously written very conventionally male-dominated fiction. Later novels in the Renunciate series, in particular Thendara House, explore issues of female sexuality and matriarchal social structures, with particular emphasis on the character Magda's developing sense of herself as a lesbian, and as an independent woman raised to be a 'traditional Darkovan woman' and yet living a liberated, autonomous life beyond the rule of fathers and husbands. Linda Leith suggests that these novels express Bradley's ambivalence towards Rousseauist society (Darkover) on the one hand, and American technological society (Terran Empire) on the other. The Renunciate characters of Magda and Jaelle offered the author an opportunity to explore the world of women- centered and lesbian-accepting communities within a patriarchal context. Susan Schwartz, writing for the New York Times, noted of this book: \\"Bradley may have followed C.L. Moore in creating Amazons, but she raises her book The Shattered Chain above the level of heroic fantasy by having her characters explicitly debate the varieties of feminist theory, discussing among other things the merits of celibacy, lesbianism and conventional marriage.\\" \\"Women and Science Fiction,\\" Susan Schwartz, New York Times Sunday Book Review, 2 May 1982, https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/books/women-and-science- fiction.html?pagewanted=1 ==References== ==Sources== * ==External links== * Category:Darkover books Category:1976 American novels Category:Novels by Marion Zimmer Bradley Category:American science fiction novels Category:DAW Books books Category:American LGBT novels ","title":"The Shattered Chain"},{"id":"2577009","text":"The Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria,Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria (retrieved 6 Jan 2010) formerly known as the Federated Coast Miwok, is a federally recognized American Indian tribe of Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo Indians.Federal Register Notice at 74 FR 40219, dated August 11, 2009 The tribe was officially restored to federal recognition in 2000 by the U.S. government pursuant to the Graton Rancheria Restoration ActPub.

(2000)Search Results - THOMAS (Library of Congress) == Early history == Prior to European contact, the residents of Marin and Sonoma Counties were bands of Native Californians belonging to two linguistic and cultural groups: the Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo, living in close proximity to each other and indigenous to Marin and southern Sonoma Counties in Northern California. Occupied at various times during more than thirty centuries, over 600 village sites have been identified in the Coast Miwok territory, stretching from Bodega Bay to the north, eastward beyond the towns of Cotati and Sonoma, and along the Point Reyes National Seashore and the shores of Tomales Bay. The year 1579 was the earliest recorded account made by the Europeans of the Coast Miwok people on the coast of Marin in the Point Reyes area, as documented in a diary by Chaplain Fletcher who was aboard Sir Francis Drake's ship. In 1595, The Coast Miwok came into contact with the crew of the San Agustin, a Manila Galleon, captained by Sebastião Rodrigues Soromenho and crewed by Filipino mariners. During the Mission Period of 1779–1823, Mission San Francisco de Asís (also called \\"Mission Dolores\\"), Mission San Rafael Arcángel and Mission San Francisco Solano used Indians, including the Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo people, as a key source of labor. As early as 1830, a Filipino married a Coast Miwok wife, starting a family who later settled in Lairds Landing. The family who descended from this multiracial couple remained there until 1955. Some of the Coast Miwok trace their lineage to this couple. The territorial lands of the Southern Pomo are in Sonoma County, south of the Russian River to the southern Santa Rosa area. The Southern Pomo were the first inhabitants of what is now the town of Sebastopol, with several smaller traditional Southern Pomo villages located southeast of Sebastopol along the Laguna de Santa Rosa. California anthropologist Alfred L. Kroeber stated: :Batiklechawi, at Sebastapol at the head of the slough known as Laguna de Santa Rosa, was an important town, and therefore presumably the headquarters of a division [of the Southern Pomo]. Another group tentatively may be inferred as having occupied the bulk of the shores of the laguna.Kroeber, 233 ==Recent history== Most of the Coast Miwok continued to live in their traditional lands through the 20th century. They worked in sawmills, as agricultural laborers, and fished to supplement their incomes. The Graton Rancheria was a Indian rancheria near Sebastopol in Sonoma County. The rancheria was established for Coast Miwok, Southern Pomo, and other Indians living in the region. In 1920, when Indians began to settle the land, they discovered that all but were inhospitable. The US government terminated the trust agreement (federal recognition) of the Graton Rancheria in 1958.

They have been recognized by music critics and metal fans alike for combining a harsh sound with a high level of technical skill. Origin's music is characterized by almost exclusive use of several specific, difficult playing techniques: blast beats on the drum kit, multiple death growled vocals, and arpeggios and sweep picking on both the guitars and the bass guitar. Their songs often have uneven, shifting time signatures. 2008 saw the band breakthrough in the United States with the release of their fourth studio album, Antithesis which was seen as a hit. ==Biography== ===Beginnings=== Origin grew out of a series of jam sessions in 1997 involving guitarist/vocalists Paul Ryan and Jeremy Turner. The band took shape over a period of about half a year. Bassist Clint Appelhanz and vocalist Mark Manning joined in October 1997, and drummer George Fluke joined in January 1998. The band members then decided to tour under the name Origin. On May 23, 1998, the band opened for Suffocation. That summer, Origin recorded a four-song, self- financed and self-distributed demo, A Coming Into Existence. In October, the band secured an opening slot on the Death Across America Tour, which also featured Nile, Cryptopsy, Oppressor and Gorguts. In February 1999, George Fluke was replaced by John Longstreth and Doug Williams replaced Clint Appelhanz. With the new lineup, Origin secured a show with Napalm Death on April 14. Various other regional shows followed, including a spot at the November to Dismember Metalfest in Texas. On December 16, Origin signed to Relapse Records. ===Debut album=== On July 11, 2000, Origin released its first studio album, Origin. Origin played the March Metal Meltdown in New Jersey and was invited to take part in Contaminated 2000. They shared the stage with Exhumed and Cephalic Carnage, and participated in another November to December in California. Origin joined forces with Poland’s Vader, along with label mates Cephalic Carnage and Dying Fetus, for the high-profile Death Across America 2000 Tour. Soon after, Origin embarked on yet another tour, this time alongside Candiria, Cryptopsy and Poison the Well. They made another Milwaukee Metalfest appearance in 2001, and participated in Summer Slaughter that year (the 1st version of \\"Summer Slaughter Tour\\" under a different booking agency Digger). Origin then secured a headline tour before beginning work on another album. The result, Informis Infinitas Inhumanitas, introduced two new members, James Lee on vocals and Mike Flores on bass guitar. ===Informis Infinitas Inhumanitas=== The band's second album Informis Infinitas Inhumanitas was produced by the band with Colin E. Davis co-producing at Studio One in Racine, Wisconsin. Immediately following its release, Origin hit the road as part of a summer metal tour with Nile, Arch Enemy and Hate Eternal. Following the tour, Jeremy Turner resigned from the band and Clint Appelhanz (this time playing guitar instead of bass guitar) returned. Origin toured with Immolation, Vader, and The Berzerker, followed by another tour with All That Remains, Scar Culture and Crematorium. Unforeseen problems arose, and Origin had to cancel the tour with Nuclear Assault in January 2003. Shortly thereafter John Longstreth resigned from the band; James King was chosen to fill the spot. The band played its first show with the new line-up in September 2003 in Topeka, Kansas. At the concert, they shot a music video for the song \\"Portal,\\" from Informis Infinitas Inhumanitas. The band then landed a headlining west coast tour in January 2004 with Uphill Battle. In the summer, Origin toured the Midwest, playing the Milwaukee Metalfest 2004 and The Texas Death and Grindfest with label mates Soilent Green and Kill the Client. ===Echoes of Decimation=== On March 15, 2005,The news post at Relapse Records' website, announcing the release of this album, is dated February 2, 2004. However, Allmusic and Amazon.com both state that the album was released on March 15, 2005. The news post itself states that the album was recorded in November 2004. The incorrect date arises from confusing post formatting—the post was created on 2004-02-02 but its content was not added until much later. Origin released Echoes of Decimation, its third studio album. Fan reaction was mixed. A review of Echoes in the student newspaper of Metropolitan Community College- Longview in Kansas City called it monotonous, yet nonetheless impressive due to the band members' instrumental prowess. Numerous United States tours immediately followed, including headlining performances at the New England Metal and Hardcore Festival and Ohio Deathfest. The band then joined forces with Malevolent Creation and Animosity for a summer North American tour that was sold out at many venues. The tour for Origin was 52 days long, and only three shows had to be cancelled. In early 2006, James King and Clint Appelhanz left Origin, and had joined death metal/grindcore group Unmerciful, along with Jeremy Turner and Tony Reust. In April, John Longstreth returned to Origin, and in May, the band played their first European show. They also embarked on another summer headlining tour across North America, with Paul Ryan performing all guitar parts. ===Antithesis=== In February and March 2007, Origin played in Europe with label mates Misery Index and Necrophagist, as well as newly signed fellow Topeka locals Diskreet. After the end of this tour, Jeremy Turner rejoined Origin and the band began to work on its next album. They finished recording in February 2008, and the resulting album, Antithesis, was released April 1, 2008, and peaked at No. 21 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. The band released a music video for the Antithesis song \\"Finite\\" on May 23, 2008. The video began to be shown on television the next day, premiering on MTV2's Headbanger's Ball. ===Entity=== The band went to record their fifth album, Entity, as a trio of Paul Ryan, Mike Flores, and John Longstreth. Vocals were done by Ryan and Flores as vocalist James Lee was ejected from the band in late 2010. Lee later went on to join Minnesota based death metal band Face of Oblivion. blabbermouth.et In 2010, the band signed to German-based Nuclear Blast Records and recorded their debut for the label in November. After releasing Entity, Origin recruited Jason Keyser of Skinless for vocal duties. The band embarked on a tour with Hate Eternal, Vital Remains and Abysmal Dawn in North America. Soon after, Origin left to tour Europe with Psycroptic and Leng Tch'e. The band also headlined the American \\"Occupation Domination\\" tour along with Cattle Decapitation, Decrepit Birth, Aborted, Rings of Saturn and Battlecross in 2012. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * Origin (2000) * Informis Infinitas Inhumanitas (2002) * Echoes of Decimation (2005) * Antithesis (2008) * Entity (2011) * Omnipresent (2014) * Unparalleled Universe (2017) ===EPs=== * A Coming into Existence (1998) ===Compilations=== * Abiogenesis – A Coming into Existence (2019) == Members == * Paul Ryan – guitars, backing vocals (1997–present) * Mike Flores – bass, backing vocals (2001–present) * John Longstreth – drums (1999–2003, 2006–present) * Jason Keyser - lead vocals (2011–present) === Former members === * Mark Manning – lead vocals (1997–2001) * Clint Appelhanz – bass (1997–1999), guitars (2002–2006) * Doug Williams – bass (1999–2001) * George Fluke – drums (1998–1999) * James King – drums (2003–2006) * James Lee – lead vocals (2001–2010) * Mica Meneke – lead vocals (2010-2011) * Jeremy Turner – guitars, backing vocals (1997–2002, 2007–2010) ===Timeline=== ImageSize = width:900 height:auto barincrement:20 PlotArea = left:120 bottom:180 top:10 right:20 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1997 till:08/31/2020 ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1997 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1998 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:1 Colors= id:vocals value:red legend:Lead_vocals id:guitar value:green legend:Guitars id:bass value:blue legend:Bass id:drums value:orange legend:Drums,_percussion id:studio value:black legend:Studio_releases id:other value:gray(0.6) legend:Others_releases LineData= at:06/16/1998 color:other layer:back at:07/11/2000 color:black layer:back at:06/11/2002 color:black layer:back at:03/15/2005 color:black layer:back at:04/01/2008 color:black layer:back at:06/07/2011 color:black layer:back at:07/04/2014 color:black layer:back at:06/30/2017 color:black layer:back at:05/03/2019 color:other layer:back BarData= bar:Mark text:\\"Mark Manning\\" bar:James text:\\"James Lee\\" bar:Mica text:\\"Mica Meneke\\" bar:Jason text:\\"Jason Keyser\\" bar:Paul text:\\"Paul Ryan\\" bar:Jeremy text:\\"Jeremy Turner\\" bar:Clint text:\\"Clint Appelhanz\\" bar:Doug text:\\"Doug Williams\\" bar:Mike text:\\"Mike Flores\\" bar:George text:\\"George Fluke\\" bar:John text:\\"John Longstreth\\" bar:James2 text:\\"James King\\" PlotData = width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(11,-4) bar:Mark from:01/01/1997 till:01/01/2001 color:vocals bar:James from:01/01/2001 till:01/01/2010 color:vocals bar:Mica from:01/01/2010 till:01/01/2011 color:vocals bar:Jason from:01/01/2012 till:end color:vocals bar:Paul from:01/01/1997 till:end color:guitar bar:Paul from:01/01/2011 till:01/01/2012 color:vocals width:3 bar:Jeremy from:01/01/1997 till:01/01/2003 color:guitar bar:Jeremy from:01/01/2007 till:01/01/2010 color:guitar bar:Clint from:01/01/1997 till:01/01/1999 color:bass bar:Clint from:01/01/2003 till:01/01/2007 color:guitar bar:Doug from:01/01/1999 till:01/01/2001 color:bass bar:Mike from:01/01/2001 till:end color:bass bar:Mike from:01/01/2011 till:01/01/2012 color:vocals width:3 bar:George from:01/01/1997 till:01/01/1999 color:drums bar:John from:01/01/1999 till:01/01/2003 color:drums bar:James2 from:01/01/2003 till:01/01/2007 color:drums bar:John from:01/01/2007 till:end color:drums ==FootnotesOrigin on Myspace Category:1998 establishments in Kansas Category:American technical death metal musical groups Category:Heavy metal musical groups from Kansas Category:Musical groups established in 1998 Category:Musical quartets Category:Musicians from Topeka, Kansas Category:Relapse Records artists ","title":"Origin (band)"},{"id":"2577026","text":"Bradamante (occasionally spelled Bradamant) is a fictional knight heroine in two epic poems of the Renaissance: Orlando Innamorato by Matteo Maria Boiardo and Orlando Furioso by Ludovico Ariosto. Since the poems exerted a wide influence on later culture, she became a recurring character in Western art. ==In Orlando Innamorato and Orlando Furioso== Bradamante, a female Christian knight, is the sister of Rinaldo and falls in love with a Saracen warrior named Ruggiero, but refuses to marry him unless he converts from Islam. An expert in combat, she wields a magical lance that unhorses anyone it touches, and rescues Ruggiero from being imprisoned by the wizard Atlantes. The two lovers are separated many times in the story, and her parents reject the suitor even after Ruggiero converts to Christianity, preferring a nobleman called Leo. She decides to marry whoever withstands her in combat and Ruggiero overcomes the challenge. At the end, their marriage gives rise to the noble House of Este, who were patrons to both Boiardo and Ariosto. The poems drew from legends of Charlemagne, chansons de geste, and blended recurring motifs found in the Matter of France and the Matter of Britain.DeSa Wiggins, Peter in ==In later works== Bradamante and Fiordispina (1632–1635) by alt= In 1582, French dramatist Robert Garnier wrote a tragicomedy named Bradamante that further develops the love story between the heroine and Roger (Ruggiero). Several eponymous operas have been written about the heroine: *La Bradamante, written by Pietro Paolo Bissari with music composed by Francesco Cavalli, was first performed in 1650 at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo of Venice. *Bradamante, composed by Louis Lacoste with a libretto written by Pierre- Charles Roy, was first performed at the Académie Royale de Musique (the Paris Opera) on 2 May 1707. *Bradamante, written by Heinrich Joseph von Collin with music composed by Johann Friedrich Reichardt, was first performed in Vienna on 3 February 1809. *Bradamante, composed by Eduard Tauwitz, was first performed in Riga in 1844. She also appears as a character in Handel's opera Alcina and Johann Adolph Hasse’s Il Ruggiero. Bradamante appears as one of the leading characters in several novels. For example, in Italo Calvino's surrealistic, highly ironic 1959 novel Il Cavaliere inesistente (The Nonexistent Knight). In cinema, she is depicted by Barbara De Rossi in the 1983 Italian film ' (also known as Paladins—the story of love and arms or Hearts and Armour) – a film based on the legends surrounding the Peers of Charlemagne. She appears as a Lancer class Servant in the mobile game Fate/Grand Order.

Pentair was founded in the US, with 65% of company's revenue coming from the US and Canada as of 2017. PNR was reorganized in 2014, shifting the corporate domicile from Switzerland to Ireland. On April 30, 2018, PNR announced that it had completed the separation of its Water and Electrical businesses. Now the company's primary focus is on residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and infrastructure and agriculture applications. Its fiscal year 2019 revenues were US$3.0 billion and it employs approximately 9,500 people worldwide. ==History== Pentair was founded in August 1966 as Pentair Industries, Inc., with the name derived from the Greek root word \\"penta-\\" (alluding to the company's five founders), and went public several months later. ===Mergers and acquisitions=== Pentair expanded its water product business, acquiring the Fleck Controls control valve business in November 1995. In August 1997, Pentair acquired the General Signal Pump Group. In 1999 under chairman, president, and chief executive officer, Winslow H. Buxton, Pentair made a series of acquisitions. In April 1999, PNR purchased Essef, the global leader in the manufacture of composite water tanks, pumps, filters, and other water equipment used in pools and spas, for the cash-equivalent price of approximately $312 million.

Alejandra Pizarnik (April 29, 1936 - September 25, 1972) was an Argentine poet. As most of her career coincided with military regimes, her poetry carries a clandestine dimension. ==Early life== Alejandra Pizarnik was born on April 29, 1936, in Avellaneda, a city within the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area, Argentina, to Jewish immigrant parents from Rovno (now Ukraine).Biografía literaria She had a difficult childhood, struggling with acne and self-esteem issues, as well as having a stutter. She also had a marked habit of gaining weight. These contingencies seriously undermined her self-esteem. Because of her negative body image and her continual comparisons to her sister, Alejandra's life became even more complicated. This may have been why she began to take amphetamines, to which she became strongly addicted, causing long periods of sleeping disorders such as euphoria and insomnia. ==Career== A year after entering the department of Philosophy and Letters at the Universidad de Buenos Aires, Pizarnik published her first book of poetry, La tierra más ajena (1955). She took courses in literature, journalism, and philosophy at the university of Buenos Aires, but dropped out in order to pursue painting[2] with Juan Batlle Planas. Pizarnik followed her debut work with two more volumes of poems, La última inocencia (1956) and Las aventuras perdidas (1958). She was an avid reader of fiction and poetry. Beginning with novels, she delved into more literature with similar topics to learn from different points of view. This sparked an interest early on for literature and also for the unconscious, which in turn gave rise to her interest in psychoanalysis. Her lyricism was influenced by Antonio Porchia, French symbolists—especially Arthur Rimbaud and Stéphane Mallarmé—, the spirit of romanticism and by the surrealists. She wrote prose poems, in the spirit of Octavio Paz, but from a woman's perspective on issues ranging from loneliness, childhood, and death. Between 1960 and 1964 Pizarnik lived in Paris, where she worked for the magazine Cuadernos and other French editorials. She published poems and criticism in many newspapers, translated for Antonin Artaud, Henri Michaux, Aimé Césaire, Yves Bonnefoy and Marguerite Duras. She also studied French religious history and literature at the Sorbonne. There she became friends with Julio Cortázar, Rosa Chacel, Silvina Ocampo and Octavio Paz. Paz even wrote the prologue for her fourth poetry book, The Tree of Diana (1962). A famous sequence on Diana reads: \\"I jumped from myself to dawn/I left my body next to the light/and sang the sadness of being born.\\" She returned to Buenos Aires in 1964, and published her best-known books of poetry: Los trabajos y las noches (1965), Extracción de la piedra de la locura (1968) and El infierno musical (1971). She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1968, and in 1971 a Fulbright Scholarship. Pizarnik's poetry claims a clandestine and iconic dimension because the majority of her mature output coincides with the military regimes in Argentine.[2] == Death == Pizarnik ended her life on September 25, 1972, by taking an overdose of Secobarbital sodium at the age of 36 one weekend she was on leave from the psychiatric hospital where she was institutionalized. She is buried in the Cementerio Israelita de La Tablada, La Tablada, Argentina. ==Books== *The Most Foreign Country (La tierra más ajena) (1955) **translated by Yvette Siegert (Ugly Duckling Presse, October 2015) *The Final Innocence (La última inocencia) (1956) **translated by Yvette Siegert (Ugly Duckling Presse, October 2016) *The Lost Adventures (Las aventuras perdidas) (1958) *Diana's Tree (Árbol de Diana) (1962) **translated by Yvette Siegert (Ugly Duckling Presse, October 2014) *Works and Nights (Los trabajos y las noches) (1965) **translated by Yvette Siegert (in Extracting the Stone of Madness: Poems 1962-1972, New Directions, September 2015) *Extracting the Stone of Madness (Extracción de la piedra de locura) (1968) **translated by Yvette Siegert (in Extracting the Stone of Madness: Poems 1962-1972, New Directions, September 2015) *A Musical Hell (El infierno musical) (1971) **translated by Yvette Siegert (New Directions, July 2013; reprinted in Extracting the Stone of Madness: Poems 1962-1972 by New Directions, September 2015) *The Bloody Countess (La condesa sangrienta) (1971) *Exchanging Lives: Poems and Translations, Translator Susan Bassnett, Peepal Tree, 2002. ==Further reading== *\\"Unmothered Americas: Poetry and universality, Charles Simic, Alejandra Pizarnik, Giannina Braschi\\", Jaime Rodriguez Matos, dissertation, Columbia University; Faculty Advisor: Gustavo Perez-Firmat, 2005. *“The Sadean Poetics of Solitude in Paz and Pizarnik.” Latin American Literary Review / Rolando Pérez, 2005 *Review: Art & Literature of the Americas: The 40th anniversary Edition\\", featuring Alejandra Pizarnik, Christina Peri Rossi, Octavio Paz, Giannina Braschi,\\" edited by Doris Sommer and Tess O'Dwyer, 2006. *\\"Arbol de Alejandra: Pizarnik Reassessed,\\" (monograph) by Karl Posso and Fiona J.

He worked on nearly two dozen films and TV shows with Astaire. He won both an Oscar and an Emmy for his dance direction. Born in Memphis, Tennessee as the son of a Greek immigrant and a Southern American woman, Pan moved to New York City with his family when he was 14. He started dancing in amateur productions and speakeasies. He was first paid to dance at age 19 and worked in several Broadway productions. In 1930 he moved to California, where he met Astaire in 1933 and began working with him; he choreographed 89 films. ==Early life== Panagiotopoulos mansion, Aigio. Pan was born Hermes Joseph Panagiotopoulos in 1909 in Memphis, Tennessee to Pantelis Panagiotopoulos, a Greek immigrant,John Franceschina, Hermes Pan: The Man Who Danced with Fred Astaire, Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 9 and Mary Aljeanne Huston, a Southerner of English and Scots-Irish ancestry dating to colonial times.Franceschina (2012), Hermes Pan, p. 11 His father was a confectioner by trade, and from a prominent family in Aigio, Greece. His family had opened the first theater in the city. In 1895, at the age of twenty-seven, Pantelis Panagiotopoulos was chosen to represent Aigio at the Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition in Nashville as a \\"Greek Consul to the South.\\"Franceschina (2012), Hermes Pan, p. 10 Initially intending to return to Greece, he stayed in Tennessee after meeting Mary Huston of Nashville in 1900. Her family had roots in the South dating to colonial times. The couple married in 1901.Franceschina (2012), Hermes Pan, p. 12 His brother Alkis also immigrated to the US, initially living in Nashville. In 1903, Pantelis became a United States citizen, he and Mary moved to Memphis, and their first son Panos was born. Their daughter, Vasso Maria, was born there in 1906. Both children were named after Panagiotopoulos's parents. Pantelis became president of the Eutrophia Company, which owned the Eutrophia Hotel and Cafe in Memphis, and the family was well-off.Franceschina (2012), Hermes Pan, p. 13 Hermes, their second son and last child, was born in Memphis in 1909. In 1911, two years after the boy's birth, the family returned to Nashville. Panagiotopoulos opened up his own restaurant.John Franceschina, Hermes Pan: The Man Who Danced with Fred Astaire, Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 13 Hermes was interested in music and dance from an early age. In 1915 \\"Aunt Betty\\" Clark, the children's African-American nanny, took Hermes to her neighborhood, a black enclave of Nashville, to introduce him to jazz music and tap dance. He was greatly influenced by this.Franceschina (2012), Hermes Pan, p. 16 Hermes befriended Aunt Betty's son, Sam Clark, who also worked for his family. Sam, a talented dancer, taught the boy many of the era's popular dances, and Hermes practiced on his own.Franceschina (2012), Hermes Pan, pp. 17-18 His father died of tuberculosis in 1922 in San Antonio. Upset at being excluded from his brother's will, his brother Alkis held the widow Mary, and her children Vasso and Hermes at gunpoint. He burned all their shares and money, saying that if he could not have them, no one would. ==Move to New York== In 1923 Mary shortened the family name to Pan and took her family to New York City, accompanied by Sam Clark.Franceschina (2012), Hermes Pan, p. 20 Initially they had enough money to live comfortably on the Upper West Side, but soon their money ran out.Franceschina (2012), Hermes Pan, p. 21 At their lowest ebb, the family had only potatoes and coffee for a meal. They vowed to commemorate that day; every year on June 13, they wrote down what they did and ate that day in a journal. They made the date a family celebration. But the eldest son, Panos, who had helped support the family, died in 1927. Pan's dance career began with an appearance at age 19 as a chorus boy in 1928 in the Marx Brothers Broadway production of Animal Crackers. Pan first met Ginger Rogers in 1930, when he appeared as a chorus singer in the Broadway musical Top Speed. He also danced in partnership with his sister Vasso. Both Pan and his sister moved to Los Angeles by 1930. The young adults shared a house before Vasso married, along with their mother Mary, and their brother's widow Dorothy and daughter Aljeanne, named for their mother. Pan eventually had a house in Beverly Hills. Vasso Pan performed in the chorus of many of the Astaire-Rogers pictures. Pan had retained links with his father's relatives in Greece. In the 1920s, he made an extensive visit to Aigio and Greece to meet them. Pan was a devout Roman Catholic and took spiritual meaning from his dancing. He was known as a homosexual in his circles, but was very private. ==Collaboration with Fred Astaire== Fred Astaire and Hermes Pan working out a dance routine, c. 1937 Pan met Fred Astaire on the set of Flying Down to Rio (1933), in which he worked as an assistant to dance director Dave Gould. While Astaire was trying to work out a series of steps for \\"The Carioca\\", someone told him that Pan had a few ideas, and the dancer was invited over. Pan demonstrated a brief break he had picked up from his street days in New York. From then on the two began a lifelong professional collaboration and friendship. Pan worked on all the RKO Astaire pictures. He was nominated for Academy Awards for the \\"Top Hat\\" and \\"The Piccolino\\" numbers from Top Hat (1935) and for the \\"Bojangles of Harlem\\"' number from Swing Time (1936). In 1937 he received the Academy Award for Best Dance Direction for A Damsel in Distress (1937), in which Joan Fontaine starred with Astaire. Astaire and Pan (standing third from left) in Second Chorus (1940) The Astaire-Pan collaboration, involving 17 of Astaire's 31 musical films and three of his four television specials, is widely accepted as one of the most important forces in dance choreography of 20th-century film and television musicals. Astaire called Pan his \\"idea man,\\" and while he generally choreographed his own routines, he greatly valued the assistance of Pan not just as a critic, but also as a rehearsal partner for the purposes of fine-tuning a routine. Given Astaire's obsessive rehearsal habits, this was no mean task. Pan also performed the essential function of teaching and rehearsing Ginger Rogers, whose many other commitments during the filming of the Astaire-Rogers musicals often conflicted with Astaire's rehearsal schedule. In addition, Pan recorded Ginger's taps in post production on all their movies made after Roberta (1935). Pan continued to collaborate with Astaire until the latter's last musical picture, Finian's Rainbow (1968), which was a disaster on a number of fronts. The young director, Francis Ford Coppola, had no prior experience with musical films and rode roughshod over Astaire's and Pan's plans for the film's dance routines. Coppola reintroduced the style of dancing camera of the early 1930s, which Astaire had done so much to banish from the Hollywood musical. Eventually Coppola fired Pan, who had a small walk-on part in the film; Coppola has since acknowledged his own primary responsibility for the film's artistic failure. ==Film appearances== Pan's first on-screen appearance is as a clarinetist during the Astaire-Goddard routine, \\"I Ain't Hep To That Step But I'll Dig It,\\" in Second Chorus (1940). He dressed as The Ghost in the deleted (and only) Astaire-Pan routine, \\"Me and the Ghost Upstairs,\\" from that same film. He appeared with Betty Grable in Moon Over Miami (1941 film) and Coney Island (1943). Hermes Pan and Rita Hayworth in the dance routine \\"On the Gay White Way\\" from My Gal Sal (1942) His longest filmed dance routine is a complex tap duet with Grable in Footlight Serenade (1942 film), which reflects his work with Astaire and Rogers. His similarity to Astaire is striking. Pan also appeared with Rita Hayworth in My Gal Sal (1942) and with Betty Grable again in Pin Up Girl (1944). In these films he had non-speaking dancing roles and served chiefly as choreographer. These are his only dance performances on film (except for a brief but credited appearance in Kiss Me Kate as \\"Soldier Boy\\") -- performances which have allowed comparisons between Pan's and Astaire's dance styles. When not working with Astaire, Pan was much in demand as a choreographer throughout the golden age of the Hollywood musical. He has been described \\"as sensitive to the eye of the camera as to the lines of the human body\\", and changing dance for camera, as well as influencing the \\"ways in which Americans watch dance.\\" He assisted LeRoy Prinz in choreographing the all-black musical Lucky Day (1936–7).Brynn Wein Shiovitz, Review, Hermes Pan: The Man Who Danced with Fred Astaire by John Franceschina\\", Dance Journal, Vol. 46, No. 2, August 2014; accessed 22 January 2019 He choreographed Lovely to Look At (1952) and Kiss Me Kate (1953, in which Bob Fosse also choreographed and danced). ==Legacy and honors== *Nominated for Academy Awards for the \\"Top Hat\\" and \\"The Piccolino\\" dance numbers from Top Hat (1935). *Nominated for Academy Award for the \\"Bojangles of Harlem\\"' dance number from Swing Time (1936). *Received the Academy Award for Best Dance Direction for A Damsel in Distress (1937). *Received an Emmy Award for the 1961 television special, An Evening with Fred Astaire. *Received a National Film Award in 1980. *The Joffrey Ballet gave him an award in 1986 for contributions to American dance. ==Filmography== ===Choreographer=== * Flying Down to Rio (1933) (assistant) * The Gay Divorcee (1934) * Roberta (1935) * Old Man Rhythm (1935) * Top Hat (1935) * In Person (1935) * I Dream too Much (1935) * Follow the Fleet (1936) * Swing Time (1936) * Shall We Dance?

According to John Franceschina in his book, Hermes Pan: The Man Who Danced with Fred Astaire, it was well known in the movie industry that Pan was gay. This was not publicly known during Pan's lifetime, and the identity of most of his partners is not known.John Franceschina, Hermes Pan: The Man Who Danced with Fred Astaire, Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 6 He had a daughter, Michelene Laski. Pan's friendships were wide in and outside the world of Hollywood. He became friends with the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who invited him to the country's 2,500 year celebration of Iran's monarchy at Persepolis. He was also close to painter Diego Rivera, who painted his full portrait. He was very close friends with Rita Hayworth, and was a pallbearer at her funeral. Toward the end of his life, Pan visited Greece. He spent time especially in his father's city of Aigio, where he saw the family mansion and met many relatives. ==Death== Hermes Pan died in Beverly Hills, California on September 19, 1990, aged 80, from undisclosed causes. He was survived by his sister Vasso Pan, his daughter Michelene Laski, his nieces Mary Ann Johnson, and Krista Meade, and his nephew Rock Meade. ==Notes== ==References== *Fred Astaire: Steps in Time, Harper & Bros., (1959).

It is located on Hulhulé Island in the North Malé Atoll, nearby the capital island Malé. The airport is well connected with major airports around the world, mostly serving as the main gateway into the Maldives for tourists. It is managed financially and administratively by an independent corporate entity known as Maldives Airports Company Limited (MACL). ==History== ===Hulhulé Airport=== The airport first started out as a small strip of land on the then inhabited island of Hulhulé. Hulhulé Airport was opened on 19 October 1960. The first runway built on Hulhulé Island was made of slotted steel sheets. This runway was . The first aircraft which landed at the airport was a Royal New Zealand Air Force Bristol Freighter, NZ5906, on 19 October 1960 at 13:55hrs. The first commercial flight was an Air Ceylon flight (4R0ACJ) landed on this runway was at 15:50hrs on 10 April 1962. The first aircraft owned by the Maldives landed on the runway of the Hulhulé Airport on 9 October 1974. In May 1964 the government and the people of Malé worked together to construct a new asphalt runway. The four districts of Malé competed for the prize money of 1,000 rufiyaa, awarded to the fastest district. On the first day 108 volunteers were enlisted for the project and 1,563.08 rufiyaa was donated. The new runway was opened on 12 April 1966 at 16:00 by President Ibrahim Nasir. ===Upgrade to Velana International Airport=== When the tourism boom in the Maldives began in 1972, the country was in need of an international standard airport to transport international tourists to the resort islands. So, on 11 November 1981, the airport was officially inaugurated under a new name of \\"Malé International Airport\\". Maldives Airports Company Ltd (MACL) was formed on 1 January 1994 to operate and manage the Male' International Airport. MACL is governed by the board of directors appointed by the President of the Maldives. On 26 July 2011, Malé International Airport was officially renamed as the Ibrahim Nasir International Airport in memory of Ibrahim Nasir, the 2nd President of the Maldives and the founder of the airport. On 1 January 2017, the airport was rebranded as Velana International Airport, referring to the family house name of President Ibrahim Nasir. The rebranding is part of a strategic plan in aligning the airport with the economic vision of the Yameen administration. ===Privatisation of the airport=== In 2010, the Nasheed administration appointed IFC to run a bidding process for the privatisation of the airport. The bid was won by a consortium between GMR Group and Malaysia Airports who provided Rufiyaa 1 billion as upfront fee to the government for the expansion and modernisation of the airport by 2014, and its operation for 25 years. By the end of the year, MACL officially handed over the aerodrome license of the airport to the newly formed GMR Malé International Airport Ltd (GMIAL). GMIAL announced that the development plans included reclaiming more land at the eastern end of the runway; where a new terminal is to be built. This terminal would consist of three separate bridged buildings. Plans for a separate cargo terminal was also announced. However, the project faced numerous delays. In late 2012, the new government of Maldives under the Waheed administration declared that the concession agreement was void ab initio and on 27 November 2012 gave GMIAL a deadline of seven days to 'evict the airport', a decision which drew mass protests from the government's opposition, as well as criticism from the government and media of India. On 7 December, GMR handed over the airport to the government, and MACL was reinstated as the operator. === Expansion of the airport=== On 18 September 2018, the airport opened a new runway. It is 3,400 meters long and 60 meters wide, built to serve larger aircraft. On 26 June 2019, a Maldivian Airbus A320 successfully tested the new southwest apron at Velana International Airport. This was the first live flight operation testing by Maldives Airports Company as they awaited final certification for operations. On 17 July 2019, the new apron was opened for flight operations. The ICAO fully compliant apron has three Code E MARS stands, two dedicated Code E stands and one dedicated Code C stand. On 17 November 2019, a new Seaplane Terminal was opened with operations commencing with a Manta Air flight. Trans Maldivian Airways and Maldivian Seaplane will follow later. In order to allow the new runway 18/36 to begin operating, all TMA Seaplane Terminals will be closed with all operations transferring to the new terminal building by May 2020. The foundation work of the new passenger terminal being constructed at the airport has been completed as of December 2019. The new passenger terminal is being developed at the south of the current international terminal and will have an area of over 78,000 square metres. The current terminal was designed to serve 1 million passengers while the new terminal will have the capacity to serve 7.3 million passengers. Expected completion time of the new terminal is by mid 2022 and will cost about $800 million USD.The expansion project also includes the construction of a cargo terminal that is expected to be completed in 2020. ==Facilities== The airport is at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has 2 asphalt runways designated 18/36 measuring and . The adjacent waterdrome which serves the large seaplane operations at Velana has 4 water runways, designated NR/SL, NC/SC, NL/SR and E/W, measuring , , and respectively. Runway NL is takeoff only and runway SR is landing only due to proximities to flying restricted areas. The airport has three terminals: the International Terminal, the Domestic Terminal and the waterdrome Seaplane Terminal. The airport includes the corporate headquarters of Trans Maldivian Airways.\\"Contact.\\" Trans Maldivian Airways. Retrieved on 21 April 2015. \\"TRANS MALDIVIAN AIRWAYS (Pvt) Ltd.

One of the highest-ranking members of the ruling Cambodian People's Party, he is the current Minister of the Interior and has served as a Deputy Prime Minister since 1992. He also represents the province of Battambang in the Cambodian Parliament. Kheng has been the Minister of the Interior since 1992. Until March 2006, he shared the position with FUNCINPEC party member You Hockry as co-Ministers of the Interior, but then became sole interior minister in a cabinet reshuffle as FUNCINPEC ended its coalition with the CPP. He is currently the second longest serving government minister of Cambodia after Prime Minister Hun Sen. On June 14, 2015, King Norodom Sihamoni awarded Kheng the honorary title of \\"Samdech\\". His official title is \\"Samdech Kralahom Sar Kheng\\" ().http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/samdech-titles-given-chhum- and-kheng Kheng is married to Nhem Sakhan with whom he has three children. ==Background== Kheng is a long-time member of the ruling Cambodian People's Party, which, according to international observers, has dominated politics and held on to power in Cambodia since 1979 through corruption, including extralegal killings, election fraud, control of the media, and at times, open violence such as the 1997 coup and 2015 intimidation of the opposition CNRP deputy leader, Kem Sokha. Within the CPP, Kheng is its Vice President and a standing member of its Central Committee, the body responsible for all core decision making. Kheng is also brother-in-law to former Khmer Rouge commander Chea Sim, who was CPP president until his death in 2015. Kheng and other current leaders of Cambodia, including Hun Sen, Tea Banh, Heng Samrin and Chea Sim, were senior cadre leaders of the Khmer Rouge in the Cambodian Civil War and the resulting Democratic Kampuchea. During the 1980s, Kheng, along with his brother-in-law Chea Sim, were identified as \\"hard-liners\\" in the People's Republic of Kampuchea government. As leaders in the one-party state controlled by the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party (the former name of the CPP), they were accused of operating \\"a police state\\". Human Rights Watch Asia Director Brad Adams described governmental policies that included imprisonment without trial and torture of political activists. By the late 1990s, however, Kheng's name was often floated by Western observers as a possible party \\"reformer\\". ==Minister of the Interior== Kheng became the Minister of Interior in 1992 during the UN protectorate period overseeing the State of Cambodia's transition to the Kingdom of Cambodia. During this time, the CPP formed a coalition with its main rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party. As a result of this arrangement, each party appointed members to \\"share\\" higher offices. Kheng and FUNCINPEC member You Hockry were appointed as co-Ministers of the Interior. This arrangement lasted until the Senate elections of 2006, when FUNCINPEC, which lost many seats while Ranariddh left to form his own party, dissolved the coalition and allied with Sam Rainsy's opposition movement. You Hockry, who chose to follow Ranariddh, was dismissed and Prince Norodom Sirivudh was made co-minister with Kheng. However, Sirivudh was soon also dismissed, leaving Kheng as the sole Minister of the Interior. Throughout this period, a schism slowly developed in the CPP with Hun Sen and his supporters who would hold on to power at all costs on one side and the more moderate Kheng, Chea Sim and Heng Samrin on the other. Hun Sen, who had control and support of the military and National Police emerged as the undisputed leader. His suspicion of Kheng was such that during an aborted coup attempt led by Prince Norodom Chakrapong in 1994, Hun Sen totally bypassed the Ministry of the Interior in his response, not notifying Kheng of troop mobilization or movements until the whole episode had already ended. Three years later, while planning the 1997 coup to oust his popular co-Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Hun Sen personally confronted Kheng to ensure his loyalty and support for the use of force. Further, Kheng could do nothing to reign in Hok Lundy, the head of the National Police force and close confidant of Hun Sen, who was accused of crimes and abuses of power ranging from human trafficking and drug smuggling to the murder of political opponents even though Lundy was under the authority of the Interior Ministry. Kheng continues to attempt to be a mediating force in Cambodia politics. After the October 2015 attacks on opposition CNRP lawmakers by pro-CPP demonstrators, Kheng conducted informal meetings with CNRP leader Sam Rainsy in an attempt to \\"restore a working relationship\\" between the two parties and quell the tension. In September 2015, he warned the authorities of Sihanoukville whom he suspected of taking bribes in return for allowing illegal fishing and smuggling activities off the coast. Also in September, Kheng announced the formation of a seven-person police commission to investigate the 2013 death threats made by CPP Interior Ministry official Lieutenant Colonel Pheng Vannak against CNRP deputy leader Kem Sokha. The investigation has resulted in Kheng removing Vannak from his position. ==References== ==Further reading== *Kheng, Sar. \\"Policy on Decentralization and Local Governance.\\" Workshop on the Medium Term Vision for the SEILA Program: 2000–2003. *Kheng, Sar. \\"Thematic Paper of the Deputy Prime Minister Sar Keng at the National Symposium on Decentralization and Local Governance on 15–16 May 2002.\\".

Its main settlement is Seward, located at the head of the bay. It received its name from Alexandr Baranov, who was forced to retreat into the bay during a bad storm in the Gulf of Alaska. When the storm settled it was Easter Sunday, so the bay and nearby Resurrection River were named in honor of it. Harding Gateway refers to the passage between Rugged and Cheval Islands. Resurrection Bay is the location of Caines Head, at the summit of which Fort McGilvray is situated, 650 feet (198 meters) above sea level. This fortification was constructed by the United States Armed Forces to defend against a possible invasion by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. The bay remains ice-free even in winter, making it easily navigable. It is the central theme to the song \\"Resurrection Bay\\" by John Craigie on his album Montana Tale. It is called the \\"gateway to the Kenai Fjords\\" as many water taxis, kayak tours, anglers, and recreational boaters use the bay to access nearby Kenai Fjords National Park. ==Geography== Resurrection Bay has a maximum depth of 972 feet, near the coast at Caines Head. It contains many deep coves, most notably Thumb, Humpy, Bulldog, Pony and Derby Coves. To the west, Resurrection Bay is bordered by the Aialik Peninsula and the adjacent Aialik Bay. To the east, the bay is bounded by the Resurrection Peninsula and Day Harbor. ==Parks== Several parks are located in and around the bay. Kenai Fjords National Park is primarily accessed by boat from Seward. Caines Head State Recreation Area is here. Many visit it by boat, but there is a trail from Lowell Point State Recreation Site, a park with beach access and trailhead parking. Parts of the trail between the two parks are only accessible at low tide, so visitors must plan accordingly. Sandspit Point State Marine Park is a undeveloped park, popular with kayakers, with beach camping and tidepooling. Sunny Cove State Marine Park is a park on Fox Island. It is also undeveloped and has no source of fresh water. The park consists of a beach area used for camping and landing of small boats, and steep, rocky cliffs. Thumb Cove State Marine Park is one of the few developed parks in the area, featuring offshore mooring buoys for small boats, beach camping, and two public use-cabins. Visitors can view Porcupine Glacier, Spoon Glacier, and Prospect Glacier from the park. ==References== Category:Bays of Alaska Category:Bodies of water of Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska Category:Seward, Alaska Category:Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm National Heritage Area ","title":"Resurrection Bay"},{"id":"2577109","text":"Elizabeth Poole or Pole (25 August 1588 – 21 May 1654) was an English settler in Plymouth Colony who founded the town of Taunton, Massachusetts. She was the first woman known to have founded a town in the Americas. == Biography == Poole was a well-born woman from Shute in East Devon, near Axminster. She was the daughter of Sir William Pole, who was knighted by James I in 1601, and Mary Peryam, the daughter of Sir William Peryam, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer. Until 2009, her family's descendants, the Pole-Carews, lived in the Devonshire house she was born in, Shute Barton a National Trust property which is open to the public on four weekends during the year. (The property is now refurbished and let by the Trust as holiday accommodation). Color representation of Elizabeth Pole Elizabeth sailed from Plymouth, England in 1633 on the Speedwell with two friends, fourteen servants, goods, and twenty tons of salt for fishing provision. She intended to form a settlement and for the conversion of the Native Americans to Christianity. Although the Taunton town seal depicts Poole purchasing land from the local Wampanoag Indians, she was not actually involved in the original transaction. However, together with her brother William Poole, she acquired a large section of this land in 1637. This led to the development of the Taunton settlement in 1638. The next year, on 3 March 1639, the settlement was officially incorporated. At her time of death in 1654, she was a wealthy spinster who had built her own house with an orchard which was occupied by her brother as well as a second home she purchased from Robert Thornton. She was one of the few women at that time who left a will leaving her property, including a 40-acre meadow, to John Poole, her nephew and merchant in Boston. The inscription on her gravestone reads: Here rest the remains of Elizabeth Poole, a native of Old England, of good family, friends, and prospects, all which she left in the prime of her life, to enjoy the religion of her conscience, in this distant wilderness; a great proprietor of the township of Taunton, a chief promoter of its settlement, and its incorporation in 1639-40; about which time she settled near this spot, and having employed the opportunity of her virgin state in piety, liberality, and sanctity of manners, died May 21, 1654, aged 65. ==See also== * First Parish Church (Taunton, Massachusetts) * Neck of Land Cemetery ==References== ===Footnotes=== ===Sources=== * Hurd, Duane Hamilton (1883).

It is situated on Chapeltown Road. The station is just south of the point where the double line merges into one. ==History== Bromley Cross Station in 1963. Grade II-listed Bromley Cross Railway Station was established in June 1848, on a branch line authorised by an Act of 30 June 1845, initially by the Blackburn, Darwen and Bolton Railway and was originally provided with a temporary, timber station 'building', described in one local newspaper report of 1854 as a 'cold wooden shed.' This founding railway co merged to become The Bolton, Blackburn, Clitheroe and West Yorkshire Railway in 1847, which later became part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;) in 1858. Permanent station buildings were provided along the line in 1859, constructed with locally quarried sandstone, by Joseph Greenup and Co of Manchester. The original minutes of the railway company held at National Archives, Kew, reveal that the engineers drew up the plans for the 1859 building, the estimated cost being £350, which also included building a 'detached cottage' which survives next to the signal box.original railway co minutes held at National Archives, Kew on RAIL 52/4 The dimensions of the original station building are approx. 39 ft in length by 15 ft wide. A minute from later that year (6 December 1859) recorded that 'permanent platforms' at the station were now 'in the course of erection.' There was a raising of the platform heights 'fully a foot the whole length' in 1886, the local newspaper reporting 'a goodly number of men being engaged on the work.'The Bolton Chronicle, Saturday 16 January 1886 The working goods yard at the station was a crucial part of a country station's existence and two surviving memos sent in 1874 to Bromley Cross refer to the delivery of cheese and tins of lard etc. to the local Co-op stores and also that goods despatched could have problems; 'all in this truck very wet when received here.'L&YR; (Salford Stn) and also L&NWR; (Broad St.) memos, dated July and Oct 1874, sent to Bromley Cross. At file ZZ354, Bolton Central Library Plans were drawn up around 1891 for an extension to the warehouse, with new goods offices and other track and signalling works. Apart from the main station building, with waiting room built in, there was a 'waiting shed' recorded on both platforms in L&YR; days. After the take over by the LMSR in 1923, plans were drawn up for improved General Waiting Rooms (GWRs) on both platforms, complete with internal stove heating. The free-standing timber GWR positioned along the platform from the main station building has its full specifications revealed in surviving design plans held on County Archives and its dimensions are given as approx 27 ft in length by 10 ft deep, which means it had approx 70 per cent of the length of the original building. It may have been at the time of adding this sizeable additional timber waiting room that the decision was taken to block off the central doorway on the main 1859 building. This originally led into a large waiting area and booking hall, complete with benches around the sides of the room and use of the second smaller internal wall clock face to aid timekeeping. After the change, this original waiting hall became the staff ticket office seen today, which swapped over from the end part of the building where the public now buy tickets. There is a boarded over rear corner fireplace just under the modern train time display screen, hence the chimney seen on the outside rear corner of the building. The GWR on the Manchester platform can be seen in late 1960s photos but must have been removed by around 1970 and by the 1980s a new waiting room extension in stone was added on to the end of the 1859 station building, in place of the gentlemen's lean-to toilets. A small waiting room provided in the station's central section was then closed and reserved for staff use (storage). There was also a detailed LMSR design plan for the proposed reconstruction of the LYR waiting shed into a GWR on the Blackburn platform, measuring approx 25 ft by 7 ft 6in, complete with a 'Princess May No. 1 Stove' and also several 'Littleton Lamps'. This GWR, if built, had become a small closed brick waiting shed as seen on a mid-1960s photo and by the 1970s this appeared to be replaced with the very basic open fronted brick shed (now boarded up) that exists today, alongside which is now its replacement, an open bus shelter type stand with metal swivel seating - all of which represents a substantial reduction in facilities to what had been provided in LYR and LMSR days. There was a road level crossing at the station which closed in 1966/7, with the pedestrian crossing remaining. In the early 1970s, the former goods yard with its shed, to the north of the station, whose sidings were recovered in September 1967, was redeveloped as a housing estate. Though built as double track (and used by expresses to and from Scotland from 1880), the line to the north was singled by British Rail in 1973 as part of the East Lancashire line resignalling scheme. Some of the line southwards toward Bolton was also reduced to single track in 1985 (again due to signalling modernisation work), though the double track portion through the station was retained to act as a passing loop. The station was owned by the London Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923, and the London Midland Region of British Railways, as it was known after nationalisation in January 1948. The London Midland Region ceased to be an operating unit in its own right in the 1980s and was wound up at the end of 1992. ==Services== Latest franchise operator Northern Railway announced a much enhanced all day half-hourly service Weekdays and Saturdays in both directions from Dec 2017, but still hourly on Sundays, rather than merely at morning and evening peak periods as before. The additional services however start/terminate at Blackburn, so the service through to Clitheroe remains hourly. ==Facilities== Parking is adjacent to the station, with overflow parking opposite and neighbouring Turton Media Arts College. The station is staffed on a part-time basis (mornings & early afternoons only, Mon-Sat), with a ticket office & waiting room on the southbound platform. A ticket machine is also available for use outside opening hours and for the collection of pre- paid/advance purchase tickets.Bromley Cross station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 9 December 2016 The platforms are fully accessible for disabled travellers (step-free access to both, northbound via the foot crossing) and there are passenger information screens and a P.A system in place. ==Station Clock== The station clock was probably installed in the early 1900s and is clearly seen on a 1912 photograph,The Lens of Sutton Collection, photograph Neg. No 13642, (railway photo archive, Longridge, Birmingham) with an identical clock noted on a 1905 photograph of once nearby Turton Station. The clock has a London Midland Scottish Railway (LMSR) identity number, an oval brass disc nailed onto the clock's long case (LMS 9994), this number indicating that the clock was installed by the L&YR; before the creation of the LMS in 1923. In 1996 the clock was restored to working order by the Railway Heritage Trust and is a rare survivor being still hand-wound weekly. ==Grade II Listing== The 1848 original low level platform, the 1859 station building, and the 1875 signal box were all Grade II listed in early 2015. ==Signal Box== Bromley Cross Station showing original low level platform and Signal Box The Grade II-listed signal box at the station is a Smith and Yardley type 1 brick box opened in December 1875, almost certainly timed to service the new connections to short sidings that were opened that winter, these works being checked and then approved with minor modifications by the Board of Trade inspector Colonel Hutchinson in documentation dated February 1876. One interesting requirement was that the wicket gates had to be locked by levers in the signal cabin and this basic protection can now be dated with certainty to that time.Board of Trade (Railway Dept) inspection report, Feb 1876, original File No. R1573, now at National Archives MT6/161/30 The box, one of three types, was supplied by Manchester-based Emily Sophia Yardley, a widow who had taken over her late husband's ironmongery business, together with her step-brother William Smith, who was recorded in the April 1861 Census records as being an 'engineer' aged 21. The extension to the goods yard at the station by the early 1900s, together with new loop lines and increased signalling, brought about an enlargement of the lever frame in the signal box. Inserting this new frame probably required the partial removal of some of the front brickwork of the 1875 cabin. This can be seen today in the distinct contrast between much older brick lower down and a quite different brick face on the upper area. The signal box has an operating floor which is 8 ft 7in above the platform level, according to early LYR Engineer's Office drawings. Bromley Cross signal box formerly acted as a 'fringe' to the power boxes at Preston (which controls the line to Blackburn) and Manchester Piccadilly (which supervises the passing loop and line south towards Bolton) - their train description systems were incompatible with each other and so the box here was retained to act as a link between them. Its sole use now is to supervise the adjacent pedestrian foot crossing and the protecting signals (with four working levers), since the interface between the two signalling centres has been upgraded so that they can communicate directly.Jackson, p.192 In circa 2004 the signal box was modernised with timber work replaced in PVC (the windows were replaced in a different pattern), and new steel steps and an oversized metal safety cage finally added. In November 2016 the foot crossing was entirely renewed, also the short timber-topped former link platform running under the front of the signal box removed, so exposing the lowest brick layers of the box for the first time in many decades. ==See also== *Listed buildings in South Turton ==Notes== ==References== Jackson, Allen (2015),Contemporary Perspective on LMS Railway Signalling Vol 1: Semaphore Swansong, Volume 1, Crowood Press Ltd, ==External links== Category:Railway stations in the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton Category:Former Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1848 Category:Northern franchise railway stations ","title":"Bromley Cross railway station"},{"id":"2577127","text":"Ettumanoor, sometimes spelled Ettumanur, is a major town and municipality in the Kottayam district of Kerala, India, located 11 kilometers north-east of Kottayam city, 50 kilometers south of Cochin, and 70 kilometers south of Cochin International Airport.

Lot of people come to this temple on the 8th and 10th day of the festival when seven and half elephants (in Malayalam: ezharaponnaana) made of gold (nearly 13 kg) will be held in public view.this statue was donated to the temple by a travancore maharaja. The temple, the wealthiest Devaswom in Kerala, has many valuable possessions. The Thulabharam is one of the important rituals of this temple. People make offerings to God for favours received. On balance, the child or man for whom offerings were promised to God, is weighed against offerings ranging from gold to fruits. Ettumanoor is an important pilgrim Centre of Hindus. The history of origin of Ettumaanoorappan is from Kattampakk, a small village in Kottayam district. Etumanoor was a temple town; so the great sage vyasa came to the temple as a mahamuni. == Other religious places == Ettumanoor Temple Kalyana Mandapam Wedding Hall Christuraj church (Christ the King Church) is one of the famous churches in Kottayam district. This church is tall and beautiful; the church being renovated recently stands in the heart of the town. Peroor Marthesmooni Jacobite Syrian Church located at Peroor is a famous pilgrim centre. The feast of Marthesmooni is celebrated every year here from 24 July to 1 August. Then St. George Orthodox church, Koduvathanam Church etc. Another famous pilgrim center, Athirampuzha St. Mary's church, is just 2 km from this place. The fireworks on occasion of Athirampuzha Thirunal Festival on the night of 24 January used attract thousands of people every year, even from neighbouring districts. There are few mosques also. Main among them are Ettumanoor Town Juma Masjid, run by Nooraniya family, Parakandam al Madeena Juma Masjid and Parolickal Muhiyudheen Juma Masjid, run by Ettumanoor, and Athirampuzha Muslim Jamaath. The history of the origin of Shiva Lingam in Ettumanoor Mahadeva Kshethram is related to Kottaram Devi Temple, Kattampakk. ==Ettumanur railway station== Ettumanoor railway station was the hub for steel supply for Idukki dams during its construction. Express trains like Venad Express and Parasuram express stop at the railway station.

She is the 1984 Olympic champion in the 3000 metres. One of the greatest female middle-distance runners of the 1980s, she also twice won the World Cross Country Championship (1982, 1984) and broke the world record for the mile in 1982. ==Career== Puicǎ was born in Iași, Romania and competed at the 1976 Montreal Olympics and the 1980 Moscow Olympics, where she finished seventh in the 1500 m. In 1978, she placed fourth in the 3000 m at the European Championships. In March 1982, she won the IAAF World Cross Country Championships. In August, she won a silver medal in the 3000 m at the European Championships behind Svetlana Ulmasova. She also finished fourth in the 1500 m final. A month later in September, she broke Mary Decker's world mile record of 4:18.08 with 4:17.44 in Rieti. Puicǎ missed the 1983 World Championships due to injury, but returned in early 1984 to win her second World Cross Country Championship title. Then in the Summer, she won the inaugural 3000 m title at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, a race remembered more for the collision of Mary Decker and Zola Budd. At those Games, she also won a bronze medal in the 1500 m behind Italy's Gabriella Dorio and Romanian teammate Doina Melinte.Maricica Puică. Sports Reference In July 1986, at the London Grand Prix, she broke Tatyana Kazankina's world 2000 m record of 5:28.72, with a time of 5:28.69. At the 1986 European Championships in Stuttgart, she won a silver medal in the 3000 m, behind Olga Bondarenko. She was also fifth in the 1500 m final. 1987 began with her winning a bronze medal in the 3000 m at the World Indoor Championships in Indianapolis, finishing behind the Soviet pair of Tatyana Samolenko and Bondarenko. Later that year, aged 37, she won a silver medal in the 3000 m at the World Championships in Rome, again behind Samolenko. Puica competed at her fourth and final Olympic Games in Seoul 1988, where she dropped out of her 3000 m heat with just 200 metres to go. In 1989, she spoke on Romanian television in support of the revolutionaries fighting against the regime of Nicolae Ceauşescu. (However Nicolae Ceauşescu ignored the Soviet Union boycott of the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, in contrast to the other East European countries.) ==International competitions== { - !colspan=\\"6\\"Representing - 1976 Olympic Games Montreal, Canada heats 1500 m 4:12.62 - rowspan=21978 World Cross Country Championships Glasgow, Scotland bgcolor=\\"cc9966\\" 3rd   - European Championships Prague, Czech Republic 4th 3000 m 8:40.9 - 1980 Olympic Games Moscow, Russia 7th 1500 m 4:01.26 - 1981 World Cup Rome, Italy bgcolor=\\"silver\\" 2nd 3000 m 8:55.80 - rowspan=41982 European Indoor Championships Milan, Italy bgcolor=silver  2nd 3000 m 8:54.26 - World Cross Country Championships Rome, Italy bgcolor=\\"gold\\"  1st   - rowspan=2European Championships rowspan=2Athens, Greece 4th 1500 m 3:59.31 - bgcolor=\\"silver\\"  2nd 3000 m 8:33.33 - rowspan=31984 World Cross Country Championships New York, United States bgcolor=\\"gold\\"  1st   - rowspan=2Olympic Games rowspan=2Los Angeles, United States bgcolor=\\"cc9966\\"  3rd 1500 m 4:04.15 - bgcolor=\\"gold\\"  1st 3000 m 8:35.96 - rowspan=21986 rowspan=2European Championships rowspan=2Stuttgart, Germany 5th 1500 m 4:03.90 - bgcolor=\\"silver\\"  2nd 3000 m 8:35.92 - rowspan=21987 World Indoor Championships Indianapolis, United States bgcolor=\\"cc9966\\"  3rd 3000 m 8:47.92 - World Championships Rome, Italy bgcolor=\\"silver\\"  2nd 3000 m 8:39.45 - 1988 Olympic Games Seoul, South Korea heats 3000 m DNF - 1989 European Indoor Championships The Hague, Netherlands bgcolor=\\"cc9966\\"  3rd 3000 m 9:15.49 } ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Iași Category:Romanian female middle-distance runners Category:Olympic athletes of Romania Category:Olympic gold medalists for Romania Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Romania Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:World Athletics Championships athletes for Romania Category:World Athletics Championships medalists Category:European Athletics Championships medalists Category:World Athletics Cross Country Championships winners Category:World record holders in masters athletics Category:World record setters in athletics (track and field) Category:Medalists at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Olympic bronze medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Universiade medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Romanian female cross country runners Category:Universiade bronze medalists for Romania Category:World Athletics Indoor Championships medalists Category:Medalists at the 1977 Summer Universiade ","title":"Maricica Puică"},{"id":"2577134","text":"A knee is a joint typical of mammals, birds and arthropods.

In California it is found in: the Peninsular Ranges, Transverse Ranges, California Coast Ranges, Sacramento Valley foothills, Sierra Nevada, and at higher elevation sky islands in the Mojave Desert ranges. It grows at moderate altitudes of . Habitats include: pinyon-juniper woodland with single-leaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla); Joshua tree woodland; and foothill woodlands, in the montane chaparral and woodlands and interior chaparral and woodlands sub-ecoregions. ==Description== Branches and fruit Juniperus californica is a shrub or small tree reaching , but rarely up to tall. The bark is ashy gray, typically thin, and appears to be \\"shredded\\".University of Texas at Austin, Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center: Juniperus californica The shoots are fairly thick compared to most junipers, between in diameter. Foliage is bluish gray and scale-like. The leaves are arranged in opposite decussate pairs or whorls of three; the adult leaves are scale-like, long on lead shoots and broad. The juvenile leaves (on seedlings only) are needle-like and are long. The cones are berry-like, in diameter, blue brown with a whitish waxy bloom, turning reddish brown, and contain a single seed (rarely two or three). The seeds are mature in about 8 or 9 months. The male cones are long, and shed their pollen in early spring. This juniper is largely dioecious, producing cones of only one sex, but around 2% of plants are monoecious, with both sexes on the same plant.Charters (2007) The California juniper is closely related to Juniperus osteosperma (Utah juniper) from further east, which shares the stout shoots and relatively large cones, but differs in that Utah juniper is largely monoecious. Also, its cones take longer to mature (two growing seasons), and it is also markedly more cold tolerant. ==Uses== Juniperus californica provides food and shelter for a variety of native ground and avian wildlife. It is a larval host for the native moth sequoia sphinx (Sphinx sequoiae). ===Native Americans=== The plant was used as a traditional Native American medicinal plant, and as a food source, by the indigenous peoples of California, including the Cahuilla people, Kumeyaay people (Diegueno), and Ohlone people.University of Michigan, Dearborn; Ethnobotany of Juniperus californica They gathered the berries to eat fresh and to grind into meal for baking. ===Cultivation=== Juniperus californica is cultivated as an ornamental plant, as a dense shrub (and eventual tree) for use in habitat gardens, heat and drought-tolerant gardens, and in natural landscaping design. It is very tolerant of alkali soils, and can provide erosion control on dry slopes. California Juniper is also a popular species for bonsai.Las Pilitas Horticultural Database: Juniperus californica (California Juniper) ;Conservation An IUCN least concern listed species, and not considered globally threatened currently.

Thousands of hopeful gold seekers crossed this trail into northern California, which at this point in time consisted of mostly Native Americans, and Californios (the descendants of early Spanish settlers). By the end of May 1849, it is estimated that 40,000+ had entered Native American territory. This added diversity, with the land now containing many different immigrants from Mexico, South America, Europe, Australia, and China. This international mix swelled California's non-Native American population from some 14,000 in 1848 to 200,000 in 1852. ==Outbreak of the War== The gold rush increased pressure on the Native Americans of California, because miners forced Native Americans off their gold-rich lands. Many were pressed into service in the mines; others had their villages raided by the army and volunteer militia. Some Native American tribes fought back, beginning with the Ahwahneechees and the Chowchilla in the Sierra Nevada and San Joaquin Valley leading a raid on the Fresno River post of James D. Savage, in December 1850. In retaliation Mariposa County Sheriff James Burney led local militia in an indecisive clash with the natives on January 11, 1851 on a mountainside near present-day Oakhurst, California. == Mariposa Battalion == An appeal to the Governor John McDougal for help led to the organization of the Mariposa Battalion under \\"Major\\" James D. Savage, commanding companies led by Captain John J. Kuykendall, Captain John Boling, and Captain William Dill. Meanwhile a federal Indian commission, sought a peaceful solution. On March 19, 1851, the Commissioners signed a treaty at Camp Fremont with six tribes. However, the Ahwahneechees and Chowchillas were absent, so the campaign against them began on March 19. === 1st Campaign === Captain Kuykendall's Company A went south to the King's and upper Kaweah Rivers and to the Tulare Valley. Arriving at the King's River, scouts located a large Chowchilla village. A quick march brought the troops to the site. The troops attacked the village, while the Native Americans defended. Company A charged into their camp, routing and killing a number, while others were ridden down and taken prisoner. Kuykendall's Company pursued the survivors. During the pursuit, Kuykendall's men abandoned their horses, which allowed the Chowchilla to escape capture. Kuykendall continued to the headwaters of the Kahweah River, but failed to locate the rest of the surviving Native Americans. A few days later, a Chowchilla delegation entered their camp to sue for peace. The offer of peace was accepted and arrangements were made to transport them to the reservation on the San Joaquin River. Kuykendall returned to the Battalion camp on Mariposa Creek in early April. Meanwhile, in their first campaign, the companies of Boling and Dill followed the natives into the mountains, marching in rain, sleet and 3 to 5 foot snow drifts. They discovered the Ahwahneechees Yosemite Valley refuge on March 27 but found few natives. === 2nd Campaign === The second campaign began on April 13, against the Chowchillas, and destroyed their food stores, but again the natives were able to elude their pursuers. However, the death of their chief induced the Chowchillas to surrender and accept reservation status. === 3rd Campaign === When the Ahwahneechees refused to come to Camp Barbour and make peace, a third campaign was launched against them. The Ahwahneechees were captured at Lake Tenaija (named for their chief) on May 22, and forced to accept reservation life. The company escorted the natives to the reservation and returned to the Mariposa Creek post. On July 1, the Mariposa Battalion mustered out, marking the end of the Mariposa War. ==See also== * California Gold Rush * American Indian Wars * Lafayette Houghton Bunnell * Miwok ==References== * * * California and the Indian Wars: Mariposa Indian War, 1850-1851, by Warren A.

The moderate 5.9 magnitude blind thrust earthquake was centered several miles north of Whittier in the town of Rosemead, had a relatively shallow depth, and was felt throughout southern California and southern Nevada. Many homes and businesses were affected, along with roadway disruptions, mainly in Los Angeles and Orange counties. Damage estimates ranged from $213–358 million, with 200 injuries, three directly-related deaths, and five additional fatalities that were associated with the event. Mercalli intensity values for the greater Los Angeles area varied with ranges from VI (Strong) to VII (Very strong). Only Whittier experienced a level of VIII (Severe), the highest experienced during the event, with the historic uptown area suffering the greatest damage. A separate M5.2 strike-slip event occurred three days later and several kilometers to the northwest that also caused damage and one additional death. Because of the earthquake activity in the Los Angeles Metropolitan area, buildings and other public structures had been equipped with accelerometers, and both the mainshock and the primary aftershock provided additional data for seismologists to analyze and compare with other southern California events. ==Tectonic setting== Beginning with the 1983 Coalinga earthquake, a blind thrust event in the central coast ranges of California, a change in perspective was brought about regarding these types of (concealed) faults. The October 1987 shock occurred on a previously unrecognized blind thrust fault that is now known as the Puente Hills thrust system. The fault was delineated by the mainshock and aftershock focal mechanisms, fault plane reflection studies, and high resolution seismic profiles, which also revealed that the fault runs from downtown Los Angeles to near Puente Hills. The system is considered one of the highest-risk faults in the United States due to its moderate dip and its location under a large metropolitan area. ==Earthquake== The main shock occurred near the northwestern border of the Puente Hills north of the Whittier Narrows at a depth of . First motion polarities, along with modelling of teleseismic P and S-waves, established that the thrust fault responsible for the shock strikes east-west with a dip of 25° dip to the north. The shock was located adjacent to the west-northwest striking Whittier fault, which is primarily a strike- slip fault, but also has a minor thrust component. USGS ShakeMap for the Whittier Narrows mainshock Although most of the Los Angeles metropolitan area saw shaking in line with Mercalli Intensity values of VI (Strong) or VII (Very strong), Whittier experienced effects consistent with MMI values of VIII (Severe). The old commercial district saw the worst damage, as these were the oldest buildings, and were also heavily damaged in the 1929 Whittier earthquake, a shock may have been a result of movement on the Norwalk Fault. ===Damage=== The 7:42 a.m. shock was the strongest in the Los Angeles area since the 1971 San Fernando earthquake and was felt as far as San Diego and San Luis Obispo, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. Communication systems and local media were temporarily impaired and power was cut, leaving numerous early morning workers stranded in disabled elevators. Other minor disruptions included a number of water and gas main breaks, shattered windows and some ceiling collapses. Like the San Fernando earthquake, transportation systems were again affected, but this time it was only the Santa Ana Freeway and San Gabriel River Freeways that were closed near Santa Fe Springs after pieces of concrete were dislodged and cracks were observed in the roadway. Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center took many of the injured, whose injuries were summarized by an emergency room spokesman as very bad to minor, and three people died as a direct result. While total casualties amounted to eight, the destruction of homes was significant. Throughout Los Angeles, Orange, and Ventura counties, 123 homes and 1,347 apartments were destroyed, and an additional 513 homes and 2,040 apartments were damaged. An inspection of a highway bridge on Interstate 605 revealed that there were fractures on the support columns, which resulted in a temporary closure, and minor damage affected 28 other bridges. Other typical failures included more than 1,000 gas leaks, with many resulting in fire, ceramic elements on high-voltage substation equipment breaking, and phone systems becoming overwhelmed. ===Strong motion=== Caltech scientists recorded the events on a cluster of twelve strong motion sensors that were placed throughout the region with a total of 87 channels of recorded data. Nine of these instruments were located on the Caltech campus, two were at the nine story Jet Propulsion Laboratory building 180 (ten miles northwest of the campus) and the final device was placed on a hillside 5 km to the west. Investigation of the accelerograms from these units revealed the strongest shaking lasted 4–5 seconds. The vertical accelerations were considered relatively high and early analysis (pre- digitilization) indicated that the mainshock was complex, with a double train of P-waves arriving with a 1.4–1.8 second interval. The National Strong-Motion Instrumentation Network (NSMIN) (a cooperative effort including the United States Geological Survey and other organizations) also monitored a set of 52 strong motion stations in the Los Angeles area. Most of the stations successfully captured the event, and the closest unit to the mainshock, a rock site at Garvey Reservoir, recorded a peak horizontal acceleration of .47g. A twelve-story steel frame building in Alhambra was outfitted with accelerographs in the basement, at mid-level, and at the top of the structure. The top floor instruments recorded a peak acceleration of .18g during the 1971 San Fernando earthquake and instruments on the sixth floor recorded a peak acceleration of .47g at the time of the Whittier mainshock. A ten-story reinforced concrete building in Whittier (7215 Bright Ave.) saw a peak horizontal reading of .63g in the basement. ===Aftershocks=== A magnitude 5.2 event occurred three days later on October 4, causing additional damage in Alhambra, Pico Rivera, Los Angeles, and Whittier. The shock's effects were assessed at VII (Very strong) on the Mercalli Intensity Scale with damaged chimneys, broken windows, and the collapse of two bell towers at the San Gabriel Civic Auditorium. This event was also responsible for several injuries and one additional death. On February 11 of the following year another small aftershock again damaged chimneys, broke windows, cracked drywall and some homes' foundations in Pico Rivera, Pasadena, and Whittier. The October 4 aftershock struck to the northwest of the mainshock, and was primarily a strike-slip event on a steeply dipping, northwest-striking fault. The origin of faulting for this event was at a depth of , which places it within the hanging wall of the thrust fault that was responsible for the main shock. This aftershock was recorded on thirty of the NSMIN stations at distances of up to . The majority of the stations were located in buildings, but nine were located at dams or reservoirs, and four were at Veterans Administration buildings. Lighter accelerations were observed than the main shock, with peak accelerations in the range of .15g–.33g, all occurring at six stations that were within of the epicenter. ==Other events== The 1929 Whittier earthquake occurred on July 8 with a local magnitude of 4.7 and maximum perceived intensity of VII (Very strong) on the Mercalli Intensity scale. The shock occurred at a depth of and was most intense to the southwest of the city, where a school and two homes were heavily damaged and other homes sustained chimney collapses. In Santa Fe Springs, oil towers were damaged and some short cracks appeared in the ground. This earthquake was felt from Mount Wilson to Santa Ana, and from Hermosa Beach to Riverside. Numerous aftershocks occurred in the first several hours and persisted through early 1931. ==Aftermath== In order to gather funds to help the rebuilding effort, the city of Whittier approved the establishment of a 521-acre earthquake recovery redevelopment area. Through this initiative, property tax revenue is directed to the city rather than to the county and schools, the originally designated recipients. The arrangement will remain in effect until the year 2037. A nonprofit organization called the Whittier Conservancy was formed shortly after the Whittier Narrows earthquake. The group aids in the preservation of the city's historical style of construction. During the earthquake, several notable buildings were destroyed, including the Harvey Apartments. They were built with bricks that appeared to have been made by hand during the 19th century; the mud used to make them came from the San Gabriel River. The Conservancy felt that these bricks were worth saving, not only for the historical value, but also for their aesthetics. Some effort was made to save and use the bricks for rebuilding the historic apartment on the corner of Greenleaf Avenue and Hadley Street. They spent $15,000 to prevent the usable bricks from being taken during the final demolition of the building. The bricks were then cleaned, then stored until they could be used in the rebuilding of the apartment. The Whittier Conservancy also collaborated in the rezoning of the Hadley neighborhood and was able to help control the rate of new multiple- family dwelling construction. ==See also== *List of earthquakes in California ==References == ;Bibliography * * * . == External links == *Whittier Narrows earthquake – Southern California Earthquake Center *M 5.9 - 2km SSW of Rosemead, CA – USGS *M 5.3 - 2km WSW of Rosemead, CA – USGS * 1987 Earthquake Whittier Narrows earthquake Whittier Narrows earthquake Whittier Narrows earthquake Category:Disasters in Los Angeles Category:Geology of Los Angeles County, California Category:Puente Hills Category:San Gabriel River (California) Category:Pico Rivera, California Category:Rosemead, California Category:October 1987 events in the United States ","title":"1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake"},{"id":"2577210","text":"Goody's Powder, also called Goody's Headache Powders, is an over-the-counter aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine–based pain reliever, in single-dose powder form, which is marketed and sold by Prestige Brands.

She served as Minnesota Secretary of State from 1999 to 2007 and now serves in the Minnesota Senate. A member of the Republican Party of Minnesota, she represents District 30, which includes parts of Hennepin, Sherburne, and Wright counties. ==Early life== The oldest of 14 children, Kiffmeyer was raised in Pierz, Minnesota. ==Minnesota Secretary of State== Kiffmeyer was elected secretary of state in November 1998, and was sworn into office on January 4, 1999. She was re-elected in November 2002. She was defeated for re- election in November 2006 by Mark Ritchie. During Kiffmeyer's tenure, Minnesota was the highest voter turnout state for all 8 years as determined by Curtis Ganz of the Center for Democracy. In 2004, Minnesota had 77.7% voter turnout, the highest in the state since 1960. She transformed the Secretary of State website allowing users to find and get directions to their local precincts, and see who their local candidates are in the upcoming election through the \\"My Ballot\\" feature.. During Kiffmeyer's tenure, she convinced the legislature to establish the Safe At Home Program for battered women or other battered victims which was unfunded by the Legislature until the following year. With Kiffmeyer's support and through bipartisan legislation supported by Native American lobbyists, beginning in 2003 and signed into law by the Governor, Minnesota law allowed Native American tribal ID cards to be used by members of tribes living on reservations for election-day registration, but not members living off reservations. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a complaint, ACLU v. Kiffmeyer, on behalf of urban members of Native American bands and the National Congress of American Indians. Judge James Rosenbaum issued a temporary restraining order in October 2004 which sided with the plaintiffs. The case was settled in favor of the plaintiffs in September 2005. The Minnesota Legislature subsequently amended election law to recognize this ruling. Kiffmeyer told the attendees at a 2004 National Day of Prayer event in Minnesota that the \\"five words\\" that are \\"probably most destructive\\" in America today are \\"separation of church and state\\". Kiffmeyer later said, \\"It's not the words that are destructive, it's the way they are interpreted. There are a lot of good church people who don't think they can be involved in government.\\"\\"She's Back! Controversial former SoS Kiffmeyer seeks to replace convicted legislator\\", Minnesota Independent, May 9, 2008 On election day 2006, Kiffmeyer supported using cell phone bills as proof of residency in order to vote. She did not support a decision by local election judges to not allow some University of Minnesota students that lived near the campus to register to vote because they had inadequate proof of residence. A Hennepin County judge overruled this decision the same day, but it was unclear how many of the students returned to the polls. ==Minnesota Legislature== Kiffmeyer was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2008 and re-elected in 2010, representing District 16B. In 2012, she was elected to the Minnesota Senate, representing District 30. Kiffmeyer currently serves as the President Pro Tem of the Minnesota Senate. ==Memberships and business activities== Kiffmeyer is the current state chairwoman for the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and serves as the only board member of the Minnesota Voter's Alliance, a political group that lobbied for the Minnesota voter ID bill which Kiffmeyer authored in the Minnesota House of Representatives. She also served on the Board of Directors of Riverview Community Bank, a \\"Christ-centered\\" savings and loan that the Minnesota Department of Commerce closed due to fiscal mismanagement. ==Controversies== ===Riverview Community Bank closure=== In 2009, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) closed Riverview Community Bank, of which Kiffmeyer was an owner and director. According to the FDIC order to cease and desist, it was concluded that Riverview Community Bank \\"had engaged in unsafe and unsound banking practices and violations of law and/or regulation.\\" Among other citations, the FDIC also cited the bank had \\"operated with a board of directors that has failed to provide adequate supervision over and direction to the management of the Bank.\\" The FDIC said it estimates the cost to its insurance fund will be $20 million. ===Minnesota Majority \\"Racial Purity\\" defense=== In 2006, Kiffmeyer became the executive director of the conservative advocacy group Minnesota Majority. The group came under criticism for racially charged text on its blog earlier this year. \\"It is not surprising that Sweden has a lower infant mortality rate, or that Japan has a longer life expectancy than the United States does,\\" read an article on the site. \\"They are nearly racially pure; we are not.\\" Kiffmeyer defended the text saying that its mention of racial purity must be understood in context, that it \\"is simply descriptive...That's a genetic term,\\" Kiffmeyer told the St. Paul Pioneer Press. \\"It does matter when you are doing medical studies.\\" ===\\"No courage\\" remark=== In 2012, Kiffmeyer referred to fellow Republican State Representative John Kriesel as having \\"no courage\\" for not running for re- election in light of the new Vikings stadium vote. Kriesel, a decorated Iraq War veteran and Purple Heart recipient, had announced earlier that he would not be running for re-election to spend more time with his wife and two young children. ===\\"Hacking\\" remark=== In 2019, Kiffmeyer downplayed concerns of Russian election hacking cited in special counsel Robert Mueller's report. In opposing Minnesota's effort to join the other 49 states in using its share of federal money to bolster cyber defenses in Minnesota's election system, Kiffmeyer stated, \\"People are being hacked all the time. You're being hacked all the time, I am.

The CSCC is part of the California Natural Resources Agency. ==Goals== The agency's official goals are to: *Protect and improve coastal wetlands, streams, and watersheds *Help people get to coasts and shores by building trails and stairways and creating low cost accommodation including campgrounds and hostels *Work with local communities to revitalize urban watersheds *Help solve complex land-use problems *Purchase and hold environmentally valuable coastal and bay lands *Protect Agricultural lands and support coastal agriculture *Accept donations and dedication of land and easements for public access, wildlife habitat, agriculture and open spaces Since its conception, the Conservancy has completed over 2,400 projects along the California coastline and San Francisco Bay, protected over 390,000 acres of coastal land and restored over 33,000 acres of coastal habitat, built over 210 miles of new trail and spent over 1.4 billion dollars on projects. It works in partnership with other public agencies, nonprofit organizations and private landowners, employing 75 people and overseeing a current annual budget of 53 million dollars. The Conservancy was created by the legislature as a unique entity with flexible powers to serve as an intermediary among government, citizens, and the private sector in recognition that creative approaches would be needed to preserve California's coast line. The Conservancy provides technical assistance and grant funding to local communities, nonprofit organizations, other government agencies, businesses, and private landowners to implement multi-benefit projects that: * Protect the natural and scenic beauty of the coast * Enhance wildlife habitat help the public to get to and enjoy beaches and parklands * Keep farmland and timberlands in production * Improve water quality * Revitalize working waterfronts * Prepare communities for the impacts of climate change ==Projects== The conservancy has completed more than 2,400 projects along the California coast line and in the San Francisco bay. These projects have included preserving almost of wetlands, dunes, wildlife habitat, recreation lands, farmland, and scenic open space, building hundreds of miles of access ways and trails along the coast line, and assisting in the completion of more than 100 urban waterfront projects. The Conservancy is currently involved in over three hundred projects in the San Francisco Bay and up and down the California coast, including: ===California Coastal Trail=== Once completed, the California Coastal Trail (CCT) will extend from Oregon to Mexico, making it one of the longest trails in the United States. While informal trails along our coast have been used for centuries, CCT was initiated in 1972 when Californians passed Proposition 20 recommending that a trails system be established along or near the coast. In 1999, the CCT was designated at the state and federal level as Millennium Legacy Trail, and in 2001 state legislation called for its completion. Roughly half of the CCT was complete in 2009. Enacted in 1976, the State Coastal Conservancy Act (Division 21 Section 31000 et al. of the Public Resources Code) calls for the Coastal Conservancy to have a principal role in the implementation of a system of public accessways to and along the state's coastline, including development of the CCT. The Coastal Conservancy pursues this mandate in part by awarding grants to public agencies and nonprofit organizations to acquire land, or any interest therein, or to develop, operate, or manage lands for public access purposes to and along the coast, on terms and conditions the Coastal Conservancy specifies. In addition, the Coastal Conservancy works with other state agencies including the California Department of Parks and Recreation and the Coastal Commission to coordinate trail development. In 2001, the Governor signed Senate Bill 908 directing the Coastal Conservancy to report back to the Legislature on progress made completing the trail. In 2003, the “Completing the California Coastal Trail” Report described the status of the trail and outlined strategies for its completion. SB 908 also directed the Coastal Conservancy to provide grants and assistance to establish and expand inland trail systems that may be linked to the trail, and directed agencies with property interests or regulatory authority in coastal areas to cooperate with the Coastal Conservancy with respect to planning and making lands available for completion of the trail. In 2007, the Governor signed SB 1396 directing the Coastal Conservancy to coordinate development of the Coastal Trail with the Caltrans. This bill also required local transportation planning agencies whose jurisdiction includes a portion of the Coastal Trail, or property designated for the trail to coordinate with the Coastal Conservancy, Coastal Commission, and Caltrans regarding development of the trail. ===Napa Sonoma Marsh Restoration Project=== The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Conservancy, and the California Department of Fish and Game conducted a feasibility study and preparing an Environmental Impact Report / Environmental Impact Statement (EIR/EIS), which involves the technical Analysis of Alternatives for the restoration of of wetlands and associated habitats within the former Cargill salt pond complex in the North Bay. The goals of this project are to restore large patches of tidal marsh that support a wide variety of fish, wildlife and plants, including special status mammals and water birds - specifically the salt marsh harvest mouse, California clapper rail, and black rail, endangered fish - specifically the delta smelt, Sacramento splittail, steelhead trout and Chinook salmon, and aquatic animals. They will also be managing water depth to maximize wildlife habitat diversity, with shallow-water areas for migratory and resident shore birds and deep-water areas for diving ducks. ===Carmel River Reroute and San Clemente Dam Removal Project=== The project involves the Conservancy, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the Conservation League Foundation and the Californian American Water company (CalAm) working together to remove the San Clemente Dam. Since the dams construction in 1921, the Carmel River has suffered from accelerated erosion, and the once vibrant steelhead trout run has dramatically decreased. The benefits of the dam removal include recovery of central coast steelhead trout (a threatened species) by proving unimpaired access to over of spawning and rearing habitat, expansion of public recreation by preserving over of coastal watershed lands, restoration of a natural sediment regime improving the habitat for steelhead trout, reducing beach erosion that now contributes to destabilization of homes, roads and infrastructure, and improvement of habitat for the threatened California red-legged frog. The total project cost for the project is estimated at $83 million. According to the implementation agreement, CalAm will pay an amount equivalent to the estimated cost of buttressing the dam, or approximately $49 million. The Conservancy, with assistance from the NMFS, will secure the additional $34 million from state, federal, and private foundation sources. Construction of the project is expected to take three years - activities will be restricted to approximately April to November to avoid the rainy season and impact to migrating steelhead. During years two and three of construction, the Carmel River and San Clemente Creek will be diverted around the reservoir and dam site, and the reservoir will be emptied. ===Integrated Watershed Restoration Program (IWRP)=== The Integrated Watershed Restoration Program (IWRP; pronounced \\"I Werp\\") for Santa Cruz County was formed in 2002 as a county wide effort to prioritize watershed restoration. The IWRP's objectives are to: * Coordinate agencies on the identification, funding and implementation of watershed restoration projects * Target proposals to critical projects supported by the resource agencies * Facilitate higher quality designs at lower costs * Simplify the permit process for water shed restoration * Effect institutional change to improve water shed restoration efforts * Develop a countywide outreach and education program * Develop a monitoring program geared toward future project identification needs * Develop additional assessments and plans * Serve as a water restoration information hub for Santa Cruz county. The Conservancy awarded 4.5 million to the Resource Conservation District of Santa Cruz County in June 2003 to initiate Phase 1 of the IWRP focused on pre-implementation activities including designs and permits for nearly 100 critical watershed restoration projects in Santa Cruz County including expansion of rural roads, technical assistance programs, comparative lagoon ecological assessment projects, countywide outreach and education program development, watershed education activity and resource guides, and coordination of resources: annual watershed partner forum, reporting, website and technical assistance. ===South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project=== Eden Landing Ecological Reserve San Francisco Bay Area The project is being headed by the state of California and the federal government to restore of Cargill's former salt ponds in San Francisco Bay. In October 2000, Cargill proposed to consolidate its operations and sell lands and salt production rights on 61 percent of its South Bay Operation area. Negotiations were headed by Senator Dianne Feinstein and a framework agreement was signed in May 2002 by the conservancy, the California Resources Agency, the Wildlife Conservation Board, the California Department of Fish and Game, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Cargill and Senator Feinstein. California approved purchase of the property on February 11, 2003. ===Invasive Spartina Project=== The Invasive Spartina Project is a coordinated regional effort among local, state and federal organizations dedicated to preserving California's extraordinary coastal biological resources through the elimination of introduced species of Spartina. Cordgrasses are highly aggressive invaders that significantly alter both the physical structure and biological composition of our tidal marshes, mudflats and creeks. The control program is the \\"action arm\\" of the San Francisco Estuary Invasive Spartina Project, a project of the conservancy. The program uses an Integrated Vegetation Management (IVM) approach to prioritize and implement control efforts. Applying this approach, the control program uses all available scientific information regarding the San Francisco Estuary, the invasive cordgrasses, and the likely economic, sociological, and ecological consequences of both the invasion and the treatment program, to develop a management strategy that is effective, economical, and protective of public and environmental health. To implement the site-specific management strategies, the program relies heavily on partnerships developed with the landowners and managers around the Bay that have non-native Spartina growing on their lands. The conservancy provides treatment and eradication grants to these partners, who subsequently select an appropriate aquatic vegetation control contractor through a competitive bid process, or utilize their own equipment and crews in the case of flood control and mosquito abatement districts. These partners are ultimately responsible for the success of the project through the long-term commitment to monitor and maintain the eradication efforts, and ensure that Spartina is not reintroduced to the system. === Explore the Coast program === The Conservancy's Explore the Coast Grant program is a small grants program supporting programs that encourage all Californian's to explore and experience the coast, with a focus on under- served communities and young people. Since 2013, the Conservancy has awarded over $4 million in 150 separate grants for programs that bring people to the coast, increase stewardship of coastal resources, and provide educational opportunities. These grants prioritize projects that achieve one or more of these objectives: * Provide coastal experiences to lower-income or other underserved populations; * Increase the number of people visiting the coast; * Improve barrier-free access for persons with disabilities; and/or * Provide a valuable recreational, environmental, cultural or historic learning experience; * Increase stewardship of coastal resources; or * Enhance the public's coastal experience in a way that does not currently exist. === Explore the Coast Overnight program === In 2019, the Conservancy introduced its Explore the Coast Overnight program to fund projects and programs to increase Californians' opportunities to stay overnight near or on the coast. The program allocates funding from Proposition 68, the Parks and Water Bond Act of 2018, to support the construction of cabins, campsites and other lodging as well as overnight programming at the coast. The Explore the Coast Overnight grant program and the Conservancy's Explore the Coast Overnight Assessment, were developed in response to AB-250 State Coastal Conservancy: Lower Cost Coastal Accommodations Program (Gonzalez Fletcher). == Leadership == The Conservancy's Executive Officer is Sam Schuchat.

Its guiding force has been the Romanian virtuoso violinist and composer Alexander Balanescu, who has led the quartet across musical frontiers into new uncharted territory. This search to push the limits of the string quartet, has revealed an ensemble nearer to a band rather than a classical group, and reflects Balanescu's passionate belief in the intercommunication and fluidity between different musical fields. From its roots as collaborators with composers such as Michael Nyman and Gavin Bryars, through projects with Lounge Lizard John Lurie, Jack de Johnette, Ornette Coleman, David Byrne, the Pet Shop Boys, Spiritualized, Kate Bush and Kraftwerk, they have developed their own unique writing and performing style setting them apart from any other string quartet. Their live performances are notable for their sheer energy and dynamism. They have played in locations as wildly contrasting as London's South Bank Centre and New York's Knitting Factory - they even opened to 10000 Pet Shop Boys fans at Wembley Arena, and are constantly looking for venues in which to present their music in a new context. They performed the current version of University Challenges title music (since 2000) on BBC2 in the UK. Their early albums were on Mute Records and Argo Records (UK). == Recordings == *Possessed (1992) * Luminitza (1994) * Angels & Insects (1995) (soundtrack) * East Meets East (1997) * Maria T (2005) * This Is The Balanescu Quartet (2011) * Balanescu (2019) * Michael Nyman - String Quartets 1-3 - featuring the Balanescu Quartet (1991) * Balanescu Quartet Play Byrne/Moran/Lurie/Torke - featuring David Byrne, Robert Moran, John Lurie and Michael Torke (1992) * Geoff Smith - Gas • Food • Lodging - featuring the Balanescu Quartet (1993) * Kevin Volans - String Quartets Nos. 2 & 3 - performed by the Balanescu Quartet (1994) * Gavin Bryars - The Last Days - featuring the Balanescu Quartet (1995) * Spiritualized - Pure Phase (1995) * Rabih Abou-Khalil - Arabian Waltz - featuring the Balanescu String Quartet (2002) * Optimo - How To Kill The DJ (Part 2) - featuring music by the Balanescu Quartet (2004) * Michael Torke - Six - featuring the Balanescu Quartet (2005) * Stateless - Matilda featuring the Balanescu Quartet (2011) * Ada Milea & Alexander Balanescu - The Island - featuring the Balanescu Quartet (2011) * Teho Teardo - Diaz - featuring the Balanescu Quartet (2012) (soundtrack) ==References== == External links == * balanescu.com * https://www.facebook.com/BalanescuQuartet/ Category:Musical groups established in 1987 Category:English string quartets Category:Romanian musical groups Category:Contemporary classical music ensembles Category:Mute Records artists ","title":"Balanescu Quartet"},{"id":"2577317","text":"Mission Bay is a neighborhood on the east side of San Francisco, California.

This title has been held since 1993 by , who is the 13th Duke of Brissac. The ancestral home of the Cossé- Brissac family is the Château de Brissac, which the family still owns.Le Figaro Magazine, article by Stéphane Bern, published on 11/07/2008 ==Early history== The fief of Brissac in Anjou had been acquired at the end of the 15th century by a French family named Cossé from the same province. René de Cossé (1460-1540) married into the Gouffier family, which was at that time very powerful at court. He was awarded the title of premier panetier to King Louis XII of France. Two sons of René de Cossé were prominent French military commanders and became Marshals of France. The fief of Brissac was assigned the status of a County in 1560 and allotted to René's elder son, Charles de Cossé, Count of Brissac, who was grand master of artillery and governor of Piedmont and Picardy. It was he who introduced the Italian violin to the French court. The second son of René was Artus de Cossé (1512-1582), who held the offices of Grand Panetier of France and superintendent of finance, and he distinguished himself in the French Wars of Religion. The younger son of Charles de Cossé, Count of Brissac, was Charles II de Cossé. He fought for the Catholic League and, as military governor of Paris, opened the gates of that city to Henry IV of France, who appointed him Marshal of France in 1594. The County of Brissac was raised in status to a Duchy in the Peerage of France in 1611. At that point, Charles II de Cossé became the first Duke of Brissac. ==Subsequent history== Notable Dukes of Brissac include Jean Paul Timoléon de Cossé- Brissac, who was the seventh Duke of Brissac and a Grand Panetier of France. He was a French general during the reign of King Louis XV and was noteworthy for leading the French vanguard at the Battle of Minden, after which he became a Marshal of France. The seventh Duke of Brissac was eventually succeeded by his second son, Louis Hercule Timoléon de Cossé-Brissac. Noted for his devotion to Louis XVI, Brissac served as the commander of the briefly established Constitutional Guard of the King. On 9 September 1792, he was killed during the September Massacres at Versailles. His body was butchered and his head severed. The head was wrapped in a cloth and carried by a peasant mob to the Château de Louveciennes where it was thrown through an open window, landing in the salon of his lover, Madame du Barry. After the death of Louis- Hercule in 1792 without a living male-line descendant, the ducal title passed to Timoléon de Cossé-Brissac, 9th Duke of Brissac (1775-1848). He was the eldest son of Hyacinthe-Hugues de Cossé-Brissac, Duke of Cossé (1746-1813), whose father was René-Hugues de Cossé-Brissac, Count of Cossé (1702-1754). René-Hugues was the third son of Artus de Cossé-Brissac, 5th Duke of Brissac (1668-1709). After Timoléon de Cossé-Brissac died in 1848, the title of Duke of Brissac was held by his successive descendants in the male line, including François, 11th Duke of Brissac and Pierre, 12th Duke of Brissac. The current holder of the ducal title is François de Cossé-Brissac, 13th Duke of Brissac (b. 1929). The heir apparent to this title is his eldest son, Charles-André de Cossé-Brissac, Marquis of Brissac (b. 1962), who has one son and three daughters. ==References== ==External links== * Château de Brissac – official website * Arms of the Dukes of Brissac – Héraldique européenne website ","title":"Duke of Brissac"},{"id":"2577327","text":"Brissac (Languedocien: Briçac) is a commune in the Hérault department in southern France. ==Population== ==Sights== *Castle (11th century), rebuilt in the early 16th century. *Parish church of Saint-Nazaire et Saint-Celse (12th century) *Church of Notre-Dame du Suc *Chapel of Saint-Etienne d'Issensac.

Gandini drew inspiration and cues from two of his Bertone show cars from 1967, the Lamborghini Marzal and the Bertone Pirana. The Espada was a four-seater GT and was initially sold alongside the Islero and the mid-engine Miura. The Espada and the Islero both replaced the 400 GT 2+2 and had similar mechanical underpinnings, with the Espada a more visually daring alternative to the relatively conservative and discrete Islero. The Spanish name \\"Espada\\" () means \\"sword\\", referring to the sword that the torero uses to kill the bull in the corrida. During its ten years in production the car underwent some changes, and three different series were produced. These were the S1 (1968–1970), the S2 (1970–1972) and the S3 (1972–1978). Each model featured interior redesigns, minor mechanical improvements and minor exterior changes. 1,217 Espadas were made, making it the most numerous and longest-running Lamborghini model until the expansion of Countach production in the mid-1980s. ===Series I=== The Espada was launched at the 1968 Geneva Motor Show, alongside the Islero. The Espada was equipped with a Lamborghini V12 engine derived from that used in the 400 GT 2+2, rated at in the series I cars. The design of the series I dashboard was inspired by the Marzal concept car, and featured octagonal housings for the main instruments, topped by an additional binnacle for the secondary gauges. The alloy wheels were made by Campagnolo on knock-off hubs, of the same design seen on the Miura. The tail lights were the same units mounted on the first series Fiat 124 Sport Coupé. 186 were made before January 1970. ===Series II=== At the 1970 Brussels Motor Show Lamborghini unveiled the Espada S2. Outside the only change was the deletion of the grille covering the vertical glass tail panel. Inside changes were more radical: all-new dashboard, centre console and steering wheel were installed. The instrument binnacle was of a more conventional rectangular shape, with round gauges. A wood-trimmed fascia extended along the entire width of the dashboard. The center armrest was also revised and ventilation for rear seat passengers was improved. Power output increased to due to a higher 10.7:1 compression ratio. The brakes were upgraded to vented Girling discs instead of solid discs. CV joints were now used on the rear half-shafts. As on the series I, 205VR15 Pirelli Cinturato CN72 tyres were fitted, suiting the cars handling until power steering was offered as an option. 575 Series II Espadas were made, making it the mass produced variant. ===Series III=== The Espada S3 was launched in 1972. With this revision, the interior now incorporated a redesigned aluminum-trimmed instrument panel that kept all instruments and most controls (including the radio) within easy reach of the driver. Several exterior changes were also made. Newly designed wheels on five-stud hubs replaced the earlier knock-off wheels. These wheels were also used on some late S2 Espadas. They were fitted with wider Pirelli Cinturato 215/70WR15 CN12 tyres. The front grille now had a square instead of hexagonal mesh. New tail lights were used, sourced from the Alfa Romeo 2000. A sunroof was now available as an option. The engine was carried over from the S2. Power steering by ZF and air conditioning were now standard. Spring and shock absorber tuning was altered slightly. In 1974, a Chrysler Torqueflite 3 speed automatic transmission became available as an option. From 1975, large impact bumpers had to be installed to meet United States safety requirements. US emissions requirements also led to the factory adding a secondary air injection pump and special tuning of carburetors and the ignition system. Some people consider these later US-spec cars as a separate fourth series, but Lamborghini did not officially change the model designation. ==Specifications== Lamborghini Espada semi-monocoque chassis The Espada used a semi-monocoque unibody, constructed of pressed sheet steel and square section steel tubing. The hood was constructed of aluminum. This chassis was a new design manufactured by Marchesi of Modena, the firm that also constructed Miura and Islero chassis. Bare chassis were shipped from Marchesi to Bertone, where bodywork, paint and trim were added prior to final assembly at the Lamborghini factory. The steel chassis and bodywork suffered from rust issues, with journalist Denis Jenkinson observing visible rust on a car with 10,000 miles during a 1972 road test. Suspension was based on the earlier 400 GT 2+2 design. It was fully independent, with unequal length double wishbones, coil springs, hydraulic shock absorbers and anti-roll bars. Four wheel disc brakes were manufactured by Girling. All calipers had three pistons, with larger calipers used in the front. Solid disks were used at first, with vented discs added for the Series II Espada. The steering box was a worm-and-peg type manufactured by ZF and mounted at the top front of the chassis, with very long steering column. Power steering would be offered on the Series III Espadas. Series I and II Espadas were originally fitted with Pirelli Cinturato 205VR15 tyres (CN72), while Series II cars used 215/70VR15 Cinturato CN12 tires. Twin fuel tanks held of gasoline. Two fuel fillers were hidden behind black cosmetic grilles in both C-pillars. A Lamborghini Espada's V12 engine The Lamborghini V12 engine was virtually unchanged from the engine used in the 400 GT 2+2. This engine, based on Giotto Bizzarrini's original design for Lamborghini, had an aluminum alloy crankcase with cast-iron cylinder liners, aluminum pistons, 24 valves (two per cylinder) and two chain- driven overhead camshafts per bank. Cylinder bore was 82 mm and stroke was 62 mm. Compression ratio on series I engines was 9.5:1, which increased to 10.7:1 in the series II/II engines. Six Weber 40DCOE side-draft carburetors were equipped, along with a single distributor for ignition. Wet sump lubrication was used, with an oil capacity of . The weight of the engine alone was , or including the transmission. Power output of series I cars was stated as 325 hp at 7,200 rpm, while Series II/III cars produced a stated 350 hp at 7,500 rpm. The Espada's transmission was mounted longitudinally, inline with the engine. Most Espadas were equipped with a Lamborghini-designed 5-speed manual transmission with hydraulically operated clutch. The internal components of this transmission were identical to those used in the Miura and Islero, with the transmission casing also shared with the Islero but differing from the Miura, due to that model's transverse mid-engine layout. From 1974, the Series III Espada could be ordered with a Chrysler Torqueflite 3 speed automatic transmission. This was an unpopular option, as acceleration and top speed were reduced. 55 Espadas were built with this transmission. == Variants and related models == === Prototype === Following the 1967 debut of the Marzal, a prototype of what would become the Espada was constructed by Bertone and the Lamborghini factory. The wooden body buck made for the Jaguar Pirana concept car was used in the construction of this prototype. The design was visually in-between the Lamborghini Marzal, Pirana and the production series I Espada. It had the very low nose and gullwing doors of the Marzal, but a front end treatment much closer to the production Espada. An unusual configuration of multiple large side windows was designed, possibly to improve rear 3/4 vision. The engine, transmission and rear differential were all 400 GT units. This car was completed and driven by Lamborghini test drivers, but was subsequently stored uncovered in a field behind the Lamborghini factory. It is now in the collection of the Museo Lamborghini. === Lancomatic suspension prototype === One Espada was fitted with a prototype hydropneumatic self-leveling rear suspension called \\"Lancomatic.\\" This car was shown at the 1968 Turin Auto Show, but remained a one-off experiment and did not enter production. The suspension system was developed in collaboration with Langen, a German company owned by the suspension component manufacturer Ehrenreich. This system was possibly developed in order to compete with the Ferrari 365 GT 2+2, which was also equipped with self-leveling rear suspension. According to Lamborghini test driver Bob Wallace, the Lancomatic suspension was promising but very costly and had significant technical issues, including seal failure due to heat and friction and harsh ride quality. ===Lamborghini Faena=== The one-off Lamborghini Faena was based on the Espada. The Lamborghini Faena is a one-off 4-door saloon based on a Series II Espada and built by coachbuilder Pietro Frua. It debuted at the 1978 Turin Motor Show, and was later shown at the 1980 Geneva Motor Show. The Faena was built on the chassis of a 1974 Espada Series II (number 8224). Following this conversion, the chassis was renumbered to 18224. The Faena was constructed over a period of eight months. The chassis was reinforced and the wheelbase extended by to accommodate rear seats. As a result, it was significantly heavier than an Espada, weighing almost . The interior was luxuriously finished in white leather and the new bodywork incorporated taillights from a Citroen SM. After being exhibited at the 1980 Geneva Motor Show, the Faena was sold by Lamborghini dealer Lambo-Motor AG in Basel. It is currently owned by a Swiss collector. The name Faena (literally, \\"job\\" or \\"chore\\") refers to the final stage of a Spanish-style bullfight. ===Revival attempts=== In 1999, a new version of the Espada was rumored to be in the works, but it was right at the time Lamborghini wanted to concentrate on a Diablo successor, so little became of the idea aside from a few drawings. In 2006, Edmunds.com reported that Lamborghini intended to revive the Espada in 2009. Lamborghini presented the 4-seat Estoque concept car at the 2008 Paris Motor Show, however no production model has been forthcoming. ==References== ==External links== * Motorbase, Lamborghini Espada * An Espada restoration project * A website about the history of the Espada and a blog by an Espada SI owner Espada Category:1970s cars Category:Grand tourers Category:Cars introduced in 1968 Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Coupés ","title":"Lamborghini Espada"},{"id":"2577343","text":"View from rear corner, showing lean-to section. The Cooper–Frost–Austin House is a historic Colonial American house, built in 1681. It is located at 21 Linnaean Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is the oldest extant home in Cambridge and is owned and operated as a non-profit museum by Historic New England. The house is rarely open for public tours, but private tours can be arranged during the summer months. The house was built by Samuel Cooper on land that his father, Deacon John Cooper, had owned since 1657, and was first documented in 1689 in The Register Book of the Lands and Houses in the \\"New Towne\\" (as Cambridge was then named). Its original structure was a single room and chimney bay in width, two and one half stories in height with an integral lean-to, containing a \\"low room,\\" \\"little room,\\" \\"kitchin,\\" \\"Chamber,\\" \\"kitchin Chamber,\\" \\"Garret,\\" and \\"Cellar,\\" all of which still exist, as do the original chimney and a facade gable. The house was extended ca. 1720 by Cooper's son, and then again between 1807–1816 by Martha Frost Austin and Thomas Austin who added an enclosed porch and Federal style stairway and trim. The house was acquired by Historic New England in 1912. In 2002 the Oxford Dendrochronology Laboratory analyzed wooden beams from the original structure and ascertained that donor trees were felled at the following times: Winter 1675/6, Winter 1680/81, and Spring 1681. The oldest timber may have been stockpiled before construction. ==See also== * National Register of Historic Places listings in Cambridge, Massachusetts ==References== ==External links== * Historic New England – Cooper–Frost–Austin Home Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1682 Category:Houses completed in the 17th century Category:Historic house museums in Massachusetts Category:Landmarks in Cambridge, Massachusetts Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Cambridge, Massachusetts Category:Museums in Cambridge, Massachusetts Category:History of Cambridge, Massachusetts Category:Historic New England Category:1682 establishments in Massachusetts ","title":"Cooper–Frost–Austin House"},{"id":"2577346","text":"Stadtoldendorf is a town in the center of the Holzminden district, Lower Saxony, Germany.

The village of Chipman is located on the banks of the Salmon River at the head of the Grand Lake, the largest freshwater lake in the Maritime provinces. The village itself is located around 73.4 kilometres from the capital city of Fredericton. ==History== Chipman is named after Ward Chipman, Jr. (1787-1851), who served as Chief Justice of New Brunswick from 1834 to 1851. The village of Chipman was founded in 1835, and was made up of portions of the older parishes of Brunswick and Canning. The first settler in what would become the Parish of Chipman was Alexander McClure of County Tyrone, who arrived in 1820 with his wife, Mary McLeod and their five daughters. Earlier settlements upriver at Gaspereau, and downriver at the Range, existed prior to 1820, consisting of local settlers and Maine businessmen who established the first sawmills on the Salmon and Gaspereau Rivers. Immigration to the Chipman area escalated rapidly in the 1820s through the 1850s, with the large majority of new arrivals hailing from the northern counties of Ireland, in particular: Donegal, Londonderry, and Tyrone. The rapidly growing lumbering and sawmill industries were the primary impetus for this growth, which continued through most of the 19th century. The Parish of Chipman quickly became prominent because of its large population in comparison with the surrounding parishes, aided by the lure of employment from the burgeoning lumbermills, the coming of the railways, the development of the coal mining industry, and later in the 1930s, the establishment of L.E. Shaw's brick and tile plant. Captured German artillery gun (WWI) on display in Chipman The first census, taken pre- Confederation in 1851, has not survived. The 1871 census, taken the year the first sawmill was established in Chipman proper, showed that the parish contained some 1,765 people. Compared to the nearby parishes of Brunswick and Cambridge, this was 1,315 and 267 more residents, respectively. By the late 19th century, Chipman and its surrounding area boasted several lucrative lumber mills, large company stores, shipyards, a large scale coal mining industry, covered bridges, a bank, a grocer, a hospital, a cheese factory, a post office, a grist mill, several churches, schools and other businesses, and a passenger and cargo railway. By 1881, the population had maintained itself, and the census recorded numbers of 1,772. Throughout most of the 20th century, Chipman also benefitted from a coal mining boom. Despite its prosperity, economic growth in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was insufficient to provide employment for all the population at a time when families typically produced several children. As a consequence, Chipman experienced its own exodus of surplus labourforce, particularly young men who had gained valuable experience in lumbering and milling. Chipman-area natives became pioneering founders of the embryonic sawmill industries in Montana, Washington state and California, as well as leading businessmen in other ventures in the new western U.S. territories and states.

This is a practice in which a chicken or money is waved over a person's head and the chicken is then slaughtered in accordance with halachic rules. ==Etymology== Lithograph of Kapparot, late 19th/early 20th century Kapparah (), the singular of kapparot, means 'atonement' and comes from the Hebrew root k-p-r, which means 'to atone'. ==Practice== Shochet with Rooster by Israel Tsvaygenbaum, 1997 On the afternoon before Yom Kippur, one prepares an item to be donated to the poor for consumption at the pre-Yom Kippur meal,Shulchan Aruch Rama Orach Chayim 605:1 recites the two biblical passages of and , and then swings the prepared charitable donation over one's head three times while reciting a short prayer three times. ===Using a rooster=== A vendor at Mahane Yehuda Market in Jerusalem sells roosters for kapparot before Yom Kippur. In one variant of the practice of kapparot, the item to be donated to charity is a rooster. In this case, the rooster would be swung overhead while still alive. After the kapparot ritual is concluded, the rooster would be treated as a normal kosher poultry product, i.e., it would be slaughtered according to the laws of shechita. It would then be given to charity for consumption at the pre-Yom Kippur meal. In modern times, this variant of the ritual is performed with a rooster for men and a hen for women. In this case, the prayer recited translates as: ===Using money=== In a second variant of the practice of kapparot, a bag of money is swung around the head and then given to charity. In this case, the prayer recited translates as: ==Sources== The practice of kapparot is mentioned for the first time by Amram Gaon of Sura Academy in Babylonia in 670 and later by Natronai ben Hilai, also of Sura Academy, in 853. Jewish scholars in the ninth century explained that since the Hebrew word Complete Jewish Bible by David H. Stern -1998 means both \\"man\\" and \\"rooster\\", a rooster may substitute as a religious and spiritual vessel in place of a man. ==Historical controversy== The original printing of Joseph ben Ephraim Karo's Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim, ch. 605, states in the chapter heading that kapparot is a nonsensical custom that should be abolished. Later editions removed this. However, according to Samson Morpurgo, (Shemesh Tsedakah, 1:23) the chapter heading was not written by Rabbi Karo but was inserted by the publishers. Kapparot was strongly opposed by some rabbis, among them Nachmanides, Shlomo ben Aderet, and the Sephardi rabbi Joseph ben Ephraim Karo in the Shulchan Aruch. According to the Mishnah Berurah, his reasoning was based on the caution that it is similar to non-Jewish rites. The Ashkenazi rabbi Moses Isserles disagreed with Karo and encouraged kapparot.Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim 605:1 In Ashkenazi communities especially, Rabbi Isserles' position came to be widely accepted, since Ashkenazi Jews will generally follow the halachic rulings of Rabbi Isserles where the Sephardic and Ashkenazic customs differ. It was also approved by Asher ben Jehiel (c. 1250–1327) and his son Jacob ben Asher (1269–1343) and other commentators. The ritual was also supported by Kabbalists, such as Isaiah Horowitz and Isaac Luria, who recommended the selection of a white rooster as a reference to and who found other mystic allusions in the prescribed formulas. Consequently, the practice became generally accepted among the Ashkenazi Jews and Hasidim of Eastern Europe. The Mishnah Berurah agrees with Rabbi Isserles, solidifying support for the practice among Lithuanian Jews as well. The Mishnah Berurah only supports the use of money (i.e., not a chicken) if there might be a problem with the slaughter due to haste or fatigue.Shulchan Aruch O.C. 605:1 In the late 19th-century work Kaf Hachaim, Yaakov Chaim Sofer approves of the custom for Sephardi Jews as well. ==Animal cruelty controversy== Some Jews also oppose the use of chickens for kapparot on the grounds of tza'ar ba'alei chayim, the principle banning cruelty to animals. On Yom Kippur eve 2005, a number of caged chickens were abandoned in rainy weather as part of a kapparot operation in Brooklyn, New York; some of these starving and dehydrated chickens were subsequently rescued by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Jacob Kalish, an Orthodox Jewish man from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was charged with animal cruelty for the drowning deaths of 35 of these kapparot chickens. In response to such reports of the mistreatment of chickens, Jewish animal rights organizations have begun to picket public observances of kapparot, particularly in Israel. The kapparot ritual would seem to be constitutionally protected as an exercise of freedom of religion in the United States, based upon a 1993 Supreme Court of the United States decision in the case of Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah. In that case, the court upheld the right of Santería adherents to practice ritual animal sacrifice, with Justice Anthony Kennedy stating in the decision, \\"Religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection\\" (quoted by Justice Kennedy from the opinion by Justice Warren E. Burger in Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division, ). However, the Supreme Court's principal concern in its decision was that the City of Hialeah specifically targeted as religious ritual, curbing the religious rights of a specific community, which conflicts with the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. ==NYC Department of Health controversy== In October, 2017, public health and animal rights activists in New York City launched a campaign to compel NYC's Health Commissioner, Dr. Mary Bassett, to enforce seven public health codes violated during kapporot. From October 2017 to May 2018, the activists disrupted four of her public speaking engagements and staged four protests in the lobby of the NYC Department of Health (DOH). The activists alleged that Commissioner Bassett was turning a blind eye to the health code violations because the ultra-Orthodox Jews who practiced the ritual represented a powerful voting bloc. A toxicology report submitted to the court as part of an ongoing lawsuit against the DOH stated that the ritual posed a risk to public health in the neighborhoods where it took place. While Commissioner Bassett has not publicly acknowledged the toxicology report or the activists' claims about the health code violations, she has issued a public statement asserting that \\"there remains no evidence that the use of chickens for Kaporos poses a significant risk to human health.\\" ==See also== * Atonement in Judaism * Minhag * Repentance in Judaism * Tashlikh ==References== ==External links== * Kapparah at the Jewish Encyclopedia online * Kaparot: Yom Kippur In Crown Heights - slideshow by The Huffington Post Category:Animal festival or ritual Category:Animal welfare Category:Animal sacrifice Category:Jewish law and rituals Category:High Holy Days Category:Yom Kippur Category:Hebrew words and phrases Category:Judaism-related controversies ","title":"Kapparot"},{"id":"2577375","text":"Blackpill (or Black Pill) is a suburban area of Swansea, Wales, beside Swansea Bay, about southwest of the city centre. == Description == Blackpill falls into the Mayals ward. The area is centred on a seafront building on Mumbles road, which once served as a station and power station for the Swansea and Mumbles Railway; today, it houses a cafe called \\"The Junction\\". The land between Mumbles road and Blackpill beach is used as Blackpill Lido, a family and children's play area which is popular in summer. Also on Mumbles road is 'The Woodman', a local pub, and Blackpill Post Office. Behind the Woodman, to the left of the main entrance to Clyne Gardens, is Clyne Chapel. The chapel was built in 1907 by Graham Vivian, who owned the nearby Clyne Castle and Estate, as the private chapel for his family. Although Vivian specified that it should have no stained glass windows to distract from the beauty of its surroundings, there are within it a range of notable artefacts that he collected on his tours to Italy. Clyne Chapel is a Grade II listed building and serves as the Anglican church for the local community. The southern entrance to the Clyne valley cycle track is just across the road from the boating lake area. This cycle track runs through the Clyne Valley Country Park to Killay, Dunvant, and Gowerton, following the route of a former railway line, which formed the start of the Heart of Wales Line prior to the Beeching Axe of the 1960s. Sloping uphill to the west of Blackpill are Clyne Gardens (Gerddi Clun), the landscaped former park of Clyne Castle. Built in the late 18th century and much altered, the building was for half a century a university hall, but is now converted to flats. Replacing demolished 20th- century student accommodation blocks is a new estate of luxury futuristic houses built by Holder Mathias Architects, which were nominated for a RIBA award. A Territorial Army barracks is just off the Mumbles Road leading up to West Cross. ==Leisure== 'The Woodman' Public House at the entrance to Clyne Gardens Blackpill has leisure facilities such as a former boating lake, which was here for about thirty years and has now been converted into a shallow paddling pool. North of the boating lake was a mini golf course sandwiched between a carriageway and cycle track. Blackpill Pitch-and-Putt, despite its name, is actually within the Sketty electoral ward, and in 2016 was converted to a footgolf course. ==Blackpill Beach== Blackpill Beach is an area known for wildlife and wildlife watchers. Large numbers of wading birds and a variety of gulls, some rare, gather here at high tide. The beach and the stream that flows out of the area is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest. ==Plans== The local council has plans to improve the leisure facilities in the area. Proposals include a new visitor centre for bird watchers at the mouth of the Blackpill Stream, additional car parking, upgrades to the Blackpill Lido to create a children's water park, a cycle hire centre, and improvements to the waterfront skate park.\\"Swansea Bay Strategy Action Plan 27th June 2007\\" A new foot- and cycle-bridge has been proposed, crossing over the dual carriageway, to connect the waterfront promenade to the cycle track in the Clyne Valley. A fourth park and ride site for Swansea is planned to be located at the existing car park at the entrance to the Clyne Valley Country Park. This new park-and-ride facility would serve both Mumbles and the city centre. ==References== ==External links== *BBC South West Wales: Blackpill Dunes *BBC South West Wales: Blackpill Lido * Blackpill – An Amble Through History – Oystermouth Historical Association * Time-Lapse video of high tide at Blackpill Beach Category:Districts of Swansea Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in West Glamorgan Category:Swansea Bay ","title":"Blackpill"},{"id":"2577379","text":"Wigan Wallgate station platforms in 1976, before the buildings were replaced View along the platform in the Manchester direction, with the rear of the main station building visible on the road overbridge.

A 1993 loco-hauled Regional Railways service with a British Rail Class 37 and coaches. Lines around Wigan in 1907 Wigan Wallgate railway station is one of two railway stations serving the town centre of Wigan in Greater Manchester, England. The station serves two routes, the Manchester- Southport Line and the Manchester-Kirkby Line. It is 16 miles north-west of Manchester Victoria (distance via Atherton). The station is managed by Northern Trains, who operate all trains serving it. Wigan's other main station is Wigan North Western, which is about away, on the opposite side of the street named Wallgate. ==Description== There are three platforms, two through platforms and one bay platform for trains departing towards Southport or Kirkby. Platforms are below street level and reached via a flight of stairs from the street level concourse which contains a ticket office and a newsagent. However, a goods lift has been modified for passenger use to ensure step-free access to the platform. The ticket office is manned all week, from 06:00 to 21:00 Monday to Saturday and from 08:00 to 20:00 on Sundays. Automated ticket barriers are in operation. Train running information is provided via digital display screens, timetable posters and automated announcements. Toilets and a waiting room are available at platform level. ==History== * 1848 The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;) opened the line between Liverpool and Lostock Junction (west of Bolton on the Manchester to Preston line) on 20 November 1848. The original L&YR; station at Wigan was located east of the current station, closer to the London & North Western Railway (L&NWR;) station. The early train services on the line ran to Liverpool, Bolton, Bury and Manchester. * 1855 The railway opened between Wigan and Southport on 9 April 1855. Wigan's L&YR; station was then relocated to a position west of where Wallgate station is today. * 1868 The L&YR; introduced a passenger service on 14 September 1868 between Wigan L&YR; station and Chorley, using a newly opened route from Hindley to Blackrod, near Horwich. On 1 November 1869, the Chorley trains were extended to Blackburn. The L&NWR; ran a competing service from Wigan L&NWR; via Boar's Head, which shared the same route from Adlington onwards to Blackburn. * 1888 On 1 October 1888, the L&YR; opened a new line from Pendleton in Salford via Atherton to Hindley. This provided a faster, more direct route for trains from Manchester and avoided the busy bottleneck around Bolton station. The L&YR; then introduced fast, regular trains between Manchester Victoria and Liverpool Exchange, in direct competition with the L&NWR; which used the more direct route between Manchester Exchange and Liverpool Lime Street. * 1889 A bypass line opened on 1 June 1889 between Hindley and Pemberton, passing to the south of Wigan. This allowed a faster journey for the L&YR;'s Manchester – Liverpool expresses by avoiding Wigan station. Express trains from Liverpool continued to serve Wigan on the route to Bury, Rochdale and West Yorkshire. The by-pass line was also used by freight trains to and from Liverpool Docks, which benefited by avoiding the Wigan L&YR; station area. * 1896 The L&YR; opened its Wigan station on its current site on 2 February 1896. The railway company had received extensive criticism regarding the standard of its station and facilities since it opened the line through the town in 1848. In 1896 Wigan finally received a railway station in line with the town's size and importance. * 1924 Renamed from \\"Wigan\\" to \\"Wigan Wallgate\\" on 2 June 1924. * 1960 Passenger trains between Wigan Wallgate, Chorley and Blackburn via Hindley were withdrawn on 4 January 1960. * 1968 The last steam trains ran on British Railways and by this time most services through Wigan Wallgate had been converted to diesel multiple unit (DMU) operation. The steam loco depot just west of Wallgate was closed and the sidings converted for stabling of DMUs. The 1965 British Rail (London Midland) timetable still shows express trains (Liverpool Exchange to Yorkshire and beyond) using or bypassing Wigan Wallgate. * 1969 The direct line from Hindley to Pemberton was closed on 14 July 1969 and all Manchester to Liverpool Exchange trains were routed through Wallgate. * 1970 The line from Bolton to Rochdale via Bury was closed on 5 October 1970. Trains from Liverpool now generally terminated at Bolton. Southport trains provided the main service to and from Manchester Victoria. * 1977 On 30 April 1977, the former L&YR; terminus at Liverpool Exchange was closed. Trains were re-routed onto a new underground line beneath Liverpool city centre to Moorfields and Liverpool Central. Since diesel multiple units could not operate in the tunnels, trains from the Wigan line initially terminated at Sandhills (the last surface station), with passengers transferring to or from electric trains on the Southport or Ormskirk lines for the short trip into Liverpool city centre. * 1977 During the early and mid-1970s, the frequency of British Rail's trains from Wigan Wallgate was reduced. Services operated at irregular intervals, those from the Liverpool line ran only as far as Wigan or Bolton and there were no off-peak trains on the Atherton line. In May 1977, the train service was significantly improved under the financial sponsorship of Greater Manchester PTE. GMPTE subsidised BR to operate a regular interval timetable throughout the day, including stopping trains via the Atherton line. The improved frequency resulted in an increase in off-peak passenger numbers. * 1978 The trains to Liverpool (which had terminated at Sandhills following the opening of the Merseyrail link to Liverpool Central) were cut back to Kirkby. This happened when Merseyrail completed electrification of the western section of line between Liverpool and Kirkby. The diesel train from Wigan was scheduled to meet an electric train from Liverpool at Kirkby and passengers transfer trains to complete their journeys. This arrangement continues at Kirkby today. * 1978 The Victorian-era buildings on the station platform at Wallgate were demolished and new structures erected. The street level building remained largely unscathed. * 1988 Prior to 1988, passengers travelling to Manchester were limited to arriving or departing at one station – the ex-L&YR; terminus at Manchester Victoria. In May 1988 a new rail link was opened in Salford, which allowed trains from Wigan and Bolton to use the lines into either Salford Central and Victoria, or Deansgate, Oxford Road and Piccadilly stations. In addition to an improved choice of central Manchester termini, most local trains from Wigan were extended to suburban destinations on the far side of Greater Manchester, or beyond. In particular, the trains to or from Southport tend to be directed onto longer suburban routes south of Manchester. The exact destination varies with each timetable revision, but in recent years, Southport trains have run through to Buxton or Chester, via Stockport. Currently, the Southport trains run to Manchester Airport (via Bolton) or (via Walkden). * 2003–2004 A major refurbishment of infrastructure was completed in October 2004. The £12 million project involved a complete renewal of the track and signalling at Wallgate station and the adjacent carriage sidings. The LMS-era colour light signalling was replaced with a modern electronic control system. During Summer 2012, the ticket office was rebuilt and refurbished. ==Services== ===Passenger=== All passenger train services are provided by Northern Trains and operated by , and DMUs. DMUs are unable to use this station because the body-side steps under the doors foul the platform coping stones here. During Monday to Saturday daytimes, this is the regular service pattern, however due to the Preston to Manchester electrification works during the 2015 summer timetable, there was an amended timetable throughout this period. There were no train services between Bolton and any Manchester station on Saturdays and Sundays between 2 May to 13 December, trains were routed via Walkden. Monday to Friday: *1 train per hour (tph) Manchester Airport (via Manchester Piccadilly) to / from Southport *1 train per hour (tph) Blackburn (via Manchester Victoria) to / from Wigan Wallgate *1 trains per hour (tph) Manchester Victoria to / from Southport *1 trains per hour (tph) to Bolton to / from Kirkby Saturday: *1 tph Manchester Victoria to / from Southport *1 tph Manchester Airport (via Manchester Piccadilly) to / from Southport *1 tph Manchester Victoria to / from Kirkby via Walkden Sunday: *1 tph Manchester Oxford Road to / from Wigan Wallgate (stopping) *1 tph Manchester Piccadilly to / from Southport (fast) There is no Kirkby service on Sundays. From 14 December 2015, the weekday & Saturday timetable reverted to that used prior to the Farnworth Tunnel blockade. There are 3tph via Bolton toward Manchester (2 to Victoria and 1 to Manchester Airport via Piccadilly) and 2tph via Walkden (both to Victoria). One of the former continues to & and one of the latter to and Blackburn. Two per hour run westwards to Southport and one to Kirkby, whilst two others terminate here. In the evenings there are hourly services to the Airport via Bolton, to Southport and to Victoria via Atherton. The Sunday service pattern is broadly similar, but trains to Piccadilly run onward to Stockport, then either to or via (alternate hours).Great Britain eNRT, December 2016 Edition, Table 82 Previously there was no Sunday service on the Atherton line, this changed in May 2010 when a 12-month trial of an hourly Sunday service began between Wallgate and Manchester Victoria via Atherton (after Greater Manchester PTA agreed a funding package with train operator Northern Rail in December 2009). Transport for Greater Manchester made the Sunday service a requirement of the Northern refranchising from April 2016. Since the introduction of the summer 2018 timetable on 20 May, the timetable underwent a further major change. Trains via Bolton from here have been withdrawn (save for a very limited a.m weekday peak service to Manchester Piccadilly and ) - these now run to/from neighbouring (though connections are available at Hindley). There are now 3tph to Manchester Victoria, all of which run via Atherton. These then continue to either , or (the latter pair via ). The westbound service continues to Southport and Kirkby as before. On Sundays, there are two trains to Manchester per hour and one to Southport. The loss of Bolton service proved unpopular with many regular users of the line and so Northern (Arriva Rail North) agreed to modify the timetable so that the current service to Wigan N.W. from both Manchester stations will be diverted to run to Wallgate and onward to Southport from the December 2019 timetable update. Services from Leeds and Blackburn via Atherton will henceforth terminate/start here (except on Sundays, when the service runs via Atherton to Blackburn). ===Freight=== There was a limited freight service through Wigan Wallgate during the early 2000s, operated by EWS running to Knowsley Freight Terminal on the Kirkby line - these were suspended from 2006 onwards. Most freight services through Wigan run through nearby Wigan North Western on the WCML. As of June 2016, a freight service to Knowsley Freight Terminal has been reinstated which uses Wallgate instead of , where most freight operates. The new service runs to/from Teesside 6 days per week. ==See also== *Wigan Central railway station *Wigan North Western railway station *Wigan Wallgate Carriage Sidings *Listed buildings in Wigan ==References== * ==External links== * The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Society Category:Railway stations in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan Category:Former Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1848 Category:Northern franchise railway stations Category:Buildings and structures in Wigan ","title":"Wigan Wallgate railway station"},{"id":"2577387","text":"Lübeck Museum of Theatre Puppets The Lübeck Museum of Theatre Puppets (in German: TheaterFigurenMuseum Lübeck) is a museum of international puppetry in the Hanseatic city of Lübeck, Germany. ==Collection== Fritz Fey Jr's private TheaterFigurenMuseum Lübeck is located on a narrow street called Kolk situated close to the Holstentor and below the brick Gothic St. Peter's church in the medieval city centre of Lübeck. For decades Fey has collected anything related to the history of puppeteering in Germany and abroad and has exhibited part of his collection in this museum which comprises five medieval brick houses. It can well compete with the internationally renowned corresponding collections of the Münchener Stadtmuseum in Munich or the Dresdner Puppenmuseum in Dresden and is a widely acknowledged enrichment of Lübeck's museum scene, sponsored above all by the City of Lübeck and a private charitable foundation, the Possehl-Stiftung. The museum contains some thousand exhibits from three centuries and three continents (Europe, Africa and Asia). They demonstrate that puppeteers have always and everywhere tried to hold a mirror up to their societies. The puppets they have used are technically quite different: glove puppets, marionettes, rod- and finger puppets, shadow puppets, ventriloquist's dummies, mechanical puppets, five-in-one puppets: all these puppets are represented in this museum. The stars of the museum are the imaginative shadow puppets from Indonesia (Wayang), \\"Moto Rafael, the Electric Drawer\\", the \\"Dog Clown\\" that was used in scenes with real dogs, or the technically sophisticated \\"metamorphoses\\" - to name but a few. In addition to the great variety of puppets the museum displays posters, props, scenery, costumes, musical instruments and even entire puppet theaters, i. e, all the attributes of high-quality puppeteering. By means of a museum quiz youths and their parents can playfully dive into the world of puppeteers. In the video room a short documentary shows puppet plays from all over the world. The museum has a shop and a café in which the visitors can relax among old marionettes and illustrations of gruesome and moralising ballads formerly recited by street singers. == Publications == * TheaterFigurenMuseum Lübeck / Figurentheater Lübeck / UNIMA Deutschland, Fundsache: KRAMER - entdeckt, erkundet, entwickelt, Theaterfiguren im Kolk - Band 1: Sonderausstellung - Filmnacht - Symposium, Puppen & Masken, Frankfurt 2012, * TheaterFigurenMuseum Lübeck / UNIMA Deutschland, Im Reich der Schatten - Chinesisches Schattentheater trifft Peking-Oper, Theaterfiguren im Kolk - Band 2: Katalog zur Sonderausstellung, Puppen & Masken, Frankfurt 2012, ==References== * Urbschat, K.

Gustave Doré's illustration for Idylls of the King (1868) Brocéliande, earlier known as Brécheliant and Brécilien, is a legendary enchanted forest that had a reputation in the medieval European imagination as a place of magic and mystery. Brocéliande is featured in several medieval texts, mostly related to the Arthurian legend and the characters of Merlin, Morgan le Fay, Lady of the Lake, and some of the Knights of the Round Table. It first appeared in literature in the Roman de Rou chronicle by Wace in 1160 and today is most commonly identified as Paimpont forest in Brittany, France. Brocéliande is a place of legend due to its uncertain location, unusual weather, and its ties with Arthurian mythology, most notably the tomb of the legendary figure of Merlin.Lupack, Alan. The Oxford guide to Arthurian Literature and Legend, (New York, NY: Oxford University Press USA, 2007), page 437. According to these accounts, the forest sheltered Morgan's magical Vale of No Return, the faery fountain of Barenton, and the place of Merlin's retirement, imprisonment or death. == Etymology == The etymology is uncertain. The oldest known form, Brecheliant, could be based on the Celtic Brec'h (hill), followed by a man's name. The later form of Brocéliande could be derived from bro (meaning country in Breton), but it is necessary to wait for Chrétien de Troyes to find this variant. A popular etymology breaks it down into \\"broce\\" for forest and \\"liande\\" for heath. ==Medieval historical accounts== First known mention of Brocéliande is found in Roman de Rou, a c. 1160 chronicle Anglo-Norman poet Wace, which covers the history of the Dukes of Normandy from the time of Rollo of Normandy to the battle of Tinchebray.« Mil chent et soisante anz out de temps et d'espace/puiz que Dex en la Virge descendi par sa grace/quant un clerc de Caen, qui out non Mestre Vace/s'entremist de l'estoire de Rou et de s'estrasce/qui conquist Normendie, qui qu'en poist ne qui place/contre l'orgueil de France, qui encor les menasce/que nostre roi Henri la congnoissë et sace. » Wace numbers the Bretons from Brocéliande (Brecheliant), about whom there are many legends (\\"ceux de Brecheliant dont les Bretons disent maintes légendes...\\"), along with the Breton knights.\\"e cil devers Brecheliant/donc Breton vont sovent fablant/une forest mult longue e lee/qui en Bretaigne est mult loee\\" Wace gives the name of the fountain of Barenton (\\"La fontaine de Berenton/sort d'une part lez le perron...\\") and describes how hunters scoop water from it and wet a stone in order to summon rain; he also mentions rumors of fairies and magic. Wace travelled to Brittany in search of these wonders, but found nothing notable and left disappointed: \\"I saw the forest and the land and looked for marvels, but found none. I came back as a fool and went as a fool. I went as a fool and came back as a fool. I sought foolishness and considered myself a fool.\\"Roman de Rou, Part III, lines 6329-98. Brocéliande is briefly mentioned in one historical text in Bertran de Born's 1183 poem dedicated to Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany – the duke to whom Brocéliande belonged. Its unusual weather alone is noted in a handful of texts: Giraldus Cambrensis's c. 1185 expeditionary account, Topographia Hibernica, Alexandre Neckham's c. 1195 work on nautical science, De naturis rerum, and William the Breton's c. 1215 poem, Philippide.\\"Brecelianensis monstrum admirabile fontis\\" ==Arthurian legend== F. A. Fraser's illustration for King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table (1912) In the 1170s, Chrétien de Troyes mentions the forest of Brocéliande in his Arthurian romance, Le Chevalier au lion. While in Brocéliande, Yvain pours water from a spring into a stone, causing a violent storm to erupt. This in turn summons the knight Esclados le Ros who defends the forest. Merlin and Vivien by Henry Meynell Rheam (1895) In the late 12th or early 13th century, Robert de Boron first associates the figure of Merlin with Brocéliande in his poem Merlin. It is also featured in several episodes of the prose adaptations and continuations of the poem, the Vulgate Cycle (Lancelot-Grail), notably in the stories of Merlin and Viviane. Later, Morgan le Fay traps many unfaithful knights in her Vale of No Return within Brocéliande until they are freed by Lancelot. In Jaufré, the Arthurian romance of unknown authorship composed in Catalonia, the forest of Brocéliande is near King Arthur's palace and the site of a mill where Arthur battles a strange bull-like animal, really a shapeshifting mage knight. The dating of Jaufré is debated and may have been written as early as 1183 or as late as 1225-1228. Later, Brocéliande also appears in context of Arthurian knights in Huon de Méry's allegorical poem Tournoiement Antecrist as well as in other texts such as Claris et Laris, where it is the site of Morgan's fairy castle, and Brun de la Montagne. ==Localisations== Merlin's tomb (tombeau de Merlin) megalith within Paimpont forest Early source works provide unclear or conflicting information on the exact location of Brocéliande; different hypotheses exist to place Brocéliande on the map. According to Wace, Brocéliande is in Brittany. Since the 15th century (Jean Cabaret d'Orville), Brocéliande has been linked by some to the forest of Lorge near Quintin in Brittany. Since around 1400 (Ponthus et Sidoine, where the forest is named Berthelien) and commonly in modern times, Brocéliande is considered to be Paimpont forest in Brittany. Some scholars think that Brocéliande is a mythological place and has never existed.Pelan, Margaret, \\"L'influence de Wace sur les romanciers français de son temps\\", p. 56, cité par A.-Y. Bourgès Jean Markale notes that while the forest itself is legendary, it is part of the \\"remainder of the immense forest that covered the entire center of Brittany until the High Middle Ages.\\"Markale, Jean Merlin: Priest of Nature, (Rochester, VT: Inner Traditions International, 1995), page 121. He goes on to point out that the notion of a magical forest in France has its roots in the writings of Lucan who describes a numinous, magical forest full of ominous happenings in Gaul.Markale, Jean Merlin: Priest of Nature, (Rochester, VT: Inner Traditions International, 1995), pages 120-121. ==Modern fiction== === Arthurian === Brocéliande has continued to appear throughout the modern Arthuriana, in works such as the 19th-century poem Idylls of the King by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and in later works such as Edwin Arlington Robinson's 1917 poem Merlin and Alan Seeger's 1916 poem Brocéliande. * Jean Lorrain wrote the play Brocéliande (1898), about Myrddhin (Merlin) and Viviane (Nimue/Elaine); as in many of the earlier Arthurian works, Brocéliande is the location where Viviane entraps Merlin inside an oak tree. * In Bernard Cornwell's Arthurian trilogy The Warlord Chronicles, Broceliande is one of two British (Celtic) kingdoms that form modern-day Brittany, the other being Armorica. * Brocéliande serves as the location of Robert Holdstock's fantasy novel Merlin's Wood. * The television series Once Upon a Time features Brocéliande in the season 5 episode \\"Siege Perilous\\" as the location of a magical toadstool needed for a potion to free the sorcerer Merlin from his imprisonment in a tree. === Other === * Brocéliande is mentioned repeatedly in Andre Norton's Here Abide Monsters using the formula 'Avalon, Tara, Brocéliande, Carnac'. * The name was an inspiration for J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional realm of Beleriand in Middle- earth. The name Broseliand was used in the early sketches of The Silmarillion (1926 to 1930). It is also the setting of Tolkien's poem The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun.Tolkien, JRR. as his horse bore him o'er the land to the green boughs of Broceliande (Welsh Review, 1945). * Several short stories in Sylvia Townsend Warner's collection Kingdoms of Elfin (many of which appeared in The New Yorker in the 1970s) are set in Brocéliande or mention it, among several other enchanted forests where Townsend's Elfin folk live. * It appears in the 2010 film Robin Hood as the place where Robert Loxley is ambushed by the French. * In Michael Swanwick's The Dragons of Babel, Broceliande is a train station where a bomb was dropped in a war between two kingdoms. * Vanni Santoni's novel Terra Ignota - il Risveglio features a magic forest named Brocéliande. * Sarah Singleton's book The Poison Garden features a magic garden called Broceliande. * Cassandra Clare's series The Mortal Instruments features a forest named Brocelind in the fictional Shadowhunter nation of Idris. * Broceliande is the name of a forest in Joan Aiken's young adult novel The Stolen Lake, which, despite taking place in a fictionalized version of South America, has a strong Arthurian theme. * The Witcher novel series by Andrzej Sapkowski features an ancient forest inhabited by magical beings known as Brokilon to humans and Brokiloén in the Elven language. * It is also referenced in Destiny 2's DLC Black Armory. An aptly named Niobe's Torment puzzle defeated the entire community of Destiny gamers for nearly twenty four hours using this word. * A forest called the Brecilian Forest is inhabited by elves and filled with magical ruins in the video game Dragon Age: Origins. * In C. S. Lewis's That Hideous Strength, the tomb of Merlin is located in the fictitious Bragdon Forest. * The forest is tied to the elves in Judith Tarr's historical fantasy The Hound and the Falcon and Alamut series. * Brocéliande is invoked in the short story \\"Main Street: 1953\\" in Joanna Russ' The Hidden Side of the Moon. ==See also== *Locations associated with Arthurian legend ==Notes and references== ==Sources== * Eckhardt, Caroline D.

Some of the settlers include the Leeman and MacKenney families, of which descendants are still living there. In its heyday, Pemberton Ridge probably had a population of 15–20 families comprising 75–100 residents. The community had a post office from 1872 to 1877 and thereafter relied on services in Forest City, as well as rural delivery. The farming community did not have a church but did have a school house and occasionally church services were held in that building. While the larger centers of Canterbury, (34 kilometres) or Danforth (30 kilometres) provided access to the Canadian Pacific Railway, as well as other commodities such as farm supplies and consumer items, Forest City was the service centre for the community.

He was one of five children, one girl and four boys. ===Stonemason and storekeeper=== Augusta Pierce Tabor When he was finished training as a stonemason, Tabor left home at age 19 to work the quarries of Maine and Massachusetts. In 1855, he departed for the Kansas Territory with the New England Emigrant Aid Company to populate that territory with anti-slavery settlers. There he farmed land along Deep Creek in Riley County, near Manhattan, Kansas (known today as Tabor Valley). In January 1856, Tabor was elected to the Free-State Topeka Legislature, but that body was soon dispersed by President Franklin Pierce in favor of the pro-slavery legislature that had been elected under the influence of \\"Border Ruffians\\" from Missouri. In 1857, Tabor returned briefly to Maine to marry Augusta Pierce, daughter of his former employer, William B. Pierce, then returned with her to Riley County. In 1859, as rumors of gold began to spread, the couple moved west with the \\"Fifty-Niners\\" to Denver (still in Kansas Territory at the time). The Tabors arrived in Buckskin Joe, Colorado, in 1861 to operate a store. In a few months they relocated to the Oro City area where Horace sought gold.Evelyn E. Livingston Furman, The Tabor Opera House: a Captivating History. Then they moved to Leadville. Augusta Tabor recorded in her journal her first impression of the South Park area while they were headed to Leadville: \\"I shall never forget my first vision of the park. I can only describe it by saying it was one of Colorado's sunsets. Those who have seen them know how glorious they are.\\"Laura King Van Dusen, Historic Tales from Park County: Parked in the Past (Charleston, South Carolina: The History Press, 2013), , pp. 30-31 Tabor's general store, originally in Buckskin Joe, Colorado, now in the Buckskin Joe theme park near Canon City, Colorado After the Tabors lived a year in Leadville, placer mining declined, and the couple returned to Buckskin Joe, where they remained until 1868. He was postmaster in Buckskin Joe from 1863 to 1868; Augusta apparently handled most of those duties and took in boarders and laundry, while Horace prospected in the mines. In 1868, the Tabors returned once more to Leadville to resume storekeeping. Tabor also continued prospecting while also engaging in business and politics. The couple ran Leadville's general store and postal system and, following his election on January 26, 1878, Tabor served as mayor of Leadville for one year. It was Mayor Tabor who first hired lawman Mart Duggan, who is credited with finally bringing Leadville's violent crime rate under control. ===Silver King=== Tabor Opera House, Leadville Baby Doe, circa 1883 On May 3, 1878, the \\"Little Pittsburg\\" mine claimed by August Rische and George Hook revealed massive silver lodes and kicked off the \\"Colorado Silver Boom.\\" Tabor had provisioned Rische and Hook for free, under a grubstake arrangement, and used his one-third ownership of Little Pittsburg to invest in other holdings. He eventually sold his interest for $1 million and bought sole ownership of the profitable \\"Matchless Mine\\" for $117,000. With his new wealth, Tabor established newspapers, a bank, the Tabor Opera House in Leadville, and the Tabor Grand Opera House and the Tabor Block in Denver. He displayed his philanthropy by, for example, donatingQuit-Claim Deed recorded in Lake County in Book 96, Page No. 171. the land under the Temple Israel in Leadville in 1884. In 1878, Tabor was elected Lieutenant Governor of Colorado and served in that post until January 1884. He served as U.S. Senator from January 27, 1883 until March 3, 1883, following the resignation of Henry M. Teller to become United States Secretary of the Interior in the administration of U.S. President Chester Arthur. Horace and Augusta Tabor, who had a son, Maxey, divorced in January 1883 though Augusta contested the end of the marriage to keep another woman from carrying his name. On March 1, 1883, Tabor finally legalized his relationship with Elizabeth \\"Baby Doe\\" McCourt, whom he had met three years earlier. The two married in a public (and, to some, scandalous) wedding ceremony at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C. The second marriage produced two daughters, Elizabeth Bonduel Lily and Rosemary Silver Dollar Echo. ===Decline, death and burial=== Tabor ran without success for governor of Colorado governor in 1884, 1886, and 1888. Then, in 1893, the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in the administration of President Grover Cleveland, devastated Tabor's fortune and his far-flung holdings were sold off. Still a respected public figure, he was made postmaster of Denver from January 4, 1898 until his death the following year. Matchless mine and Baby Doe Tabor cabin When he became terminally ill with appendicitis in 1899, Tabor's final request of Baby Doe was that she maintain the Matchless claim. Legend reports that she did but later lost control of the mine. She lived in the tool shed of the Matchless mine for thirty years and died in that shed. Augusta Tabor, however, prospered in her later years; on her death in 1895, she was among the wealthiest citizens of Denver. When Horace Tabor died in 1899, flags were flown at half staff and ten thousand people were reported to have attended his funeral. His body was interred at Mt. Calvary Cemetery in Denver and later reinterred at Mt. Olivet Cemetery in Jefferson County, Colorado, where it now rests beside that of Baby Doe. In his remembrance, there is a Tabor Lake at the base of Tabor Peak approximately southwest of Leadville, just south of Independence Pass. The actor Don Haggerty played Tabor in the 1967 episode \\"Chicken Bill\\" of the syndicated television series Death Valley Days, hosted by Robert Taylor. Dub Taylor played the title role of the silver miner Chicken Bill Lovell, who in the story line salts his mine to get Tabor to pay off Lovell's lingering debt and to fund his continued operation. ===Silver Dollar Tabor=== In Silver Dollar, the Story of the Tabors, published in 1932, author David Karsner related that William Jennings Bryan, the politician and orator, visited the Tabors in 1890 shortly after the birth of their second daughter. Hearing the baby gurgle, Bryan exclaimed: \\"Why Senator, that baby's laughter has the ring of a silver dollar!\\" The Tabors had not yet decided on a name for the girl, and this remark was the inspiration for her name: Rosemary Silver Dollar Echo Honeymaid Tabor. After working as a newspaper reporter in Denver, Silver Dollar was ready to write her novel, Star of Blood. Moving to Chicago, and living cheaply, she set to work. Karsner wrote, \\"The best that can be said of Silver's book is that it was printed - not published.\\" It was unpopular. Silver Dollar worked her minor celebrity for all it was worth, but after a string of burlesque and minor acting jobs, she came to a bad end. The one-time \\"Girl of the Nile,\\" says Karsner, liked heavy drinking and \\"Happy Dust.\\" Going by the name of Ruth Norman, among many other aliases, after the men who supported her, she died at the age of thirty-five in 1925 by spilling a large kettle of boiling water on herself while she was extremely intoxicated. ==Footnotes== ==Bibliography== * Judy Nolte Temple, Baby Doe Tabor: The Madwoman in the Cabin.

The house is open on the first and third Saturday of the month from June through October. The house began in 1678 as a simple structure of two or possibly three rooms on land owned by Tristram Coffin, Jr. About 1713 the house was more than doubled in size, with new partitions added. In 1785, two Coffin brothers legally divided the structure into two separate dwellings, each with its own kitchen and living spaces. The property remained within the Coffin family until acquired by Historic New England in 1929. Although the house was traditionally dated to 1654 (by Joshua Coffin, author of the 1845 history of Newbury), recent scientific studies have provided more accurate estimates. In 2002, the Oxford Dendrochronology Laboratory analyzed wooden beams from the structure and ascertained that donor trees were felled in winter 1676–1677 and 1677–1678 for the original structure, and winter 1712–1713 for the addition. This revised dating means that the Coffin House may no longer be the earliest example of the principal rafter/common purlin roof, although even so it is certainly one of the oldest extant examples. Coffin House is owned by Historic New England. == Notes Library of Congress. Historic American Buildings Survey.

Married priests, because of the requirement for abstinence before serving, can not serve the Liturgy daily; however, it is rare for any priest to serve daily. Also, an emergency beyond his control may have prevented him from preparing according to the Rule for Holy Communion, he may have suffered an injury which would not permit him to enter the Sanctuary, etc.There is a certain similarity in concept between the Typica and the Missa Sicca of the medieval Roman Catholic Church at the discretion of the Pastor. When the Liturgy may be celebrated but is not, then the Typica is read at the time the Liturgy is appointed to be celebrated, and it contains the scriptual readings and other propers for the Liturgy. The Typica, like the hours that it is aggregated with, is rarely read in Greek parish churches, but it is relatively common in Slavic churches. The name \\"Typica\\" refers to the \\"Typical Psalms\\" (Psalm 102, Psalm 145, and the Beatitudes), which together with parts of the Liturgy of the Catechumens comprise the non-lenten form of the Typica. == Description == When read in place of the Liturgy's celebration, the Typica is read after the Sixth HourIn the usage of the Old Believers, the Typica is read after the Ninth hour, that is said jointly to the Third and Sixth hours and during the reading of the Typica, in the place where the Liturgy would be celebrated; otherwise it is read after the Ninth Hour. When replacing the Liturgy, the propers of the Liturgy are used, e.g., the troparia inserted between the verses of the Beatitudes, the troparia and kontakia before the Trisagion, and the scriptural readings with their corresponding prokimena. on the weekdays of Great Lent the Psalms are omitted and between the verses of the Beatitudes is inserted \\"Remember us, O Lord, when Thou comest into Thy kingdom\\" with prostrations, there are no readings, and, as is typical of Lenten services, the Prayer of St. Ephraim is used. The Typica is also appointed to be read after the Royal Hours on the Eve of Nativity, the Eve of Theophany, and on Great Friday. == Text === The text of the Typica can be found in English in several places including \\"The Unabbreviated Horologion\\".

It consists of five subdivisions: the central town Bad Brückenau and the four suburbs Staatsbad Brückenau, Wernarz, Volkers and Römershag. The marketplace of Bad Brückenau ==History== ===History of Brückenau=== The early history of the town is sparsely documented. The first buildings were probably erected close to a ford across the Sinn, which was in use by the time of Charlemagne. By the 12th century the settlement had reached the size of a small town and was called Sinn-Au. Earliest mention of the town is made in a document dating back to 1249, when Fulda Abbey granted Sinn-Au certain privileges. In 1260 the Bishop had four castles built around the town, which he granted to various vassals in the area. Around that time, he also fortified the town with a simple town wall. Brückenau with its old bridge. Drawing by H. Girl, before 1876 In 1310 Sinn-Au was granted the rights of a city by King (later Emperor) Heinrich VII. With that, Brückenau gained the rights to maintain its walls, hold markets, have its own council, cut tree in the forests, raise taxes on wine and so on. In 1337, the council made use of its new rights and enlarged the walls and fortified the gates. In 1597 the town received its present name Brückenau, when a bridge (German: Brücke) was built over the Sinn. In August 1876, the town was almost completely destroyed by fire. ===History of the spa=== In the 15th century mention is made of a sour-tasting well four kilometers down the valley in south westerly direction. Even then, the water was known for its curative properties, and in 1747 Bishop Amandus von Buseck of Fulda built a fountain. Under his successor Heinrich von Bibra, the first hotels were built and two more wells discovered. The Baroque ensemble along the main axis of the Kurpark dates back to these days. In 1816, following the Napoleonic Wars, Brückenau became part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. Brückenau became the favorite spa of King Ludwig I of Bavaria, who financed an encompassing renovation. The central building dating back to this era is the Große Kursaal. After the German Revolution of 1848 and the abdication of Ludwig I, the Bavarian government leased the spa to private entrepreneurs. Today, most of the hotels are leased by Dorint. In the first decade of the 20th century, the town, rebuilt after the fire, began to imitate the success of the spa. Three wells were discovered, the town and a group of citizens created two parks. In the administrative reform of 1970, the Staatsbad became part of the town and all of Brückenau was granted the official title \\"Bad\\". ==Culture and Sights== ===Museums=== * Heimatmuseum: This museum is located in the town centre and gives an impression of daily life in Brückenau in the 18th and 19th centuries. * German Bicycle-Museum ===Music=== Großer Kursaal, 2010 * Bayerisches Kammerorchester * Kurorchester ===Architecture=== * Großer Kursaal: The Großer Kursaal was planned in 1827 by the Munich architect Johann Gottfried Gutensohn and built by the Brückenau Master Builder Lorenz Hergenröder.

The lake is surrounded by parkland as part of the Minneapolis Chain of Lakes. The lake has an area of and a maximum depth of . ==History== Lake Harriet is named for Harriet Lovejoy, who lived with her husband Colonel Henry Leavenworth at Fort Snelling. The two came to the area in 1819. The lake and surrounding land was last owned by Colonel William S. King, who donated the land to the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board in 1885. The lake was called Bde Unma (\\"other lake\\") by the local Dakota people. ===The bandshell=== Bandshell at Lake Harriet A public pavilion has been located on the northern side of Lake Harriet since 1888 when a pavilion was erected on the property of Thomas Lowry. It stood on the edge of Lake Harriet until 1891, when it was destroyed by fire. After the fire, Minneapolis hired architect Harry Wild Jones to design the next bandshell. Designed in a pagoda-like style, the second pavilion overlooked the lake until 1903 when it too was destroyed by fire. A third pavilion, in the classical revival style, again designed by Jones, was built in 1904. It was destroyed on July 8, 1925, in a windstorm; two people were killed, among a group which had taken refuge inside it. After the loss of this pavilion, a small bandstand was built on the site as a temporary replacement. The bandstand remained until it was replaced by the current bandshell structure, built in 1986. The current bandshell was originally painted blue, but in 2004 developer Mark McGowan organized an all- volunteer free restoration of the buildings. To complete the restoration, McGowan obtained $650,000 in donated labor and materials from local and national companies. Through these efforts, the bandshell, refectory and sailing club have been repaired and repainted light brown. To celebrate the restoration, an all-day music festival, called \\"Lake Harriet Live!\\", was held on September 19, 2004. During the fall of 2006, construction of a new patio and picnic shelter built to match the design of the original buildings was begun next to the concessions. Construction of the new building and picnic area have been completed. ==Recreational facilities== Lake Harriet is popular for recreation. It offers sailing, two beaches, and a system of bike and pedestrian trails (about for the bike trail and for the pedestrian trail). The trail and parkway system, part of the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway, connects with Bde Maka Ska on the north end of Lake Harriet, via William Berry Parkway, and with the Minnehaha Creek trail system at the southeast side of the lake. The bandshell is used for concerts throughout the summer months. The bandshell complex also contains a picnic area and a seasonal outdoor restaurant, Bread & Pickle.. A preserved section of the Como-Harriet Streetcar Line runs between Bde Maka Ska and the Lake Harriet bandshell area. ==Other features== Plane over Lake Harriet, headed out of Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport The lake is in a direct line with two of the main runways at the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport, and airplanes frequently fly over the area. Lake Harriet's \\"elf house\\" On the walking path near where Queen Avenue meets the perimeter drive around the lake, there is an \\"elf house\\" carved into the base of an ash tree. For several years, one could leave a letter for the elf supposedly living there and find a letter in reply sometime in the next few days. During the winter, the elf door is shut, and a plank appears stating he has \\"moved to his castle in the east.\\" It reopens in the spring. Sailboats on Lake Harriet Other parkland near the lake includes a picnic ground just north of the bandshell, Lyndale Park, and the Thomas Sadler Roberts Bird Sanctuary on the northeast side of the lake. Lakewood Cemetery is located between the southeast side of Bde Maka Ska and the north shoreline of Lake Harriet. Two blocks west of the lake is the shopping district of Linden Hills, often referred to as \\"a small town in the city\\". It was discovered on Google Earth that the silhouette of a twin-engine aircraft can be seen in the water. Most have dismissed this as the shadow of a plane flying over, but an investigation was opened into the matter. Further information has determined that there is no sunken plane but rather it is a photographic anomaly of a plane passing over that, due to the exposure, makes it appear to be under the water. ==Fish== The lake contains black crappie, bluegill, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, muskellunge, northern pike, pumpkinseed, walleye, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. Some guideline restrictions have been placed on the consumption of bluegill, carp, crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye, white sucker, and yellow perch from the lake, because of contamination with mercury and PFOS. In 1998, a dead female lake sturgeon weighing and long washed ashore on the lake. Sturgeon were thought to no longer exist in the lake or the Minnehaha Creek watershed. Minnesota Department of Natural Resources officials speculated it may have been released into the lake when young by a fisheries employee during the mid-20th century. It is also possible the fish was a descendant of sturgeon which migrated into the lake thousands of years ago, prior to the formation of Minnehaha Falls. ==See also== * List of lakes in Minneapolis *List of shared-use paths in Minneapolis ==References== * Minneapolis Park & Recreation Board on Lake Harriet * Lake Harriet Yacht Club * (Lake Harriet Bandshell History) Harriet Category:Parks in Minneapolis Category:Shared-use paths in Minneapolis ","title":"Lake Harriet (Minnesota)"},{"id":"2577493","text":"Defiance is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Broad Top Township, Bedford County, Pennsylvania, in the United States.

Elm in Stillwater, Oklahoma. ==History== Eskimo Joe's was opened by Steve File (who came up with the name) and Stan Clark (who later purchased File's interest and became sole owner), two graduates of nearby Oklahoma State University (OSU), on July 21, 1975. Originally, Eskimo Joe's was only a bar, but when the drinking age was raised from 18 to 21 in 1984, the business became a restaurant as well. The name came from the desire to express that Eskimo Joe's had the coldest beer in town.Eskimo Joe's History The restaurant, also called \\"Stillwater's Jumpin' Little Juke Joint,\\" occupies a two story building with a unique atrium dubbed the \\"Joe Dome\\" featuring a retractable glass roof, built in 1992. Eskimo Joe's is a popular hang-out for OSU students and is located across the street from the main campus. It is an extended part of \\"The Strip,\\" a hang-out zone of bars centered on Washington Street, and often features concerts and other late-night attractions for the college drinking scene, such as Ladies Night or Coin Beer. In early 2003 Eskimo Joe's started a \\"Thirsty Thursday\\" promotion that charged a $5 cover and gave patrons all the domestic beer they cared to drink. This promotion has since changed to \\"bottomless bottles.\\" ==Media references == In the season 9 episode 12 of the ABC sitcom The Middle titled \\"The Other Man\\", the character Brad mentioned to Sue at the 18 minute mark that he and Luke went down the street to Eskimo Joe's. The scene was set where Sue attends college which was in Indiana. In 2005, Sports Illustrated's on- line magazine, SI on Campus, named Eskimo Joe's the third best collegiate sports bar in the U.S.Sports Illustrated at Eskimo Joe's In 1990, during his commencement speech, President George H. W. Bush endorsed Eskimo Joe's cheese fries.Both President George H.W. and George W. Bush's commencement speech mention In 2006, during his commencement speech, President George W. Bush followed his father's footsteps and also mentioned both the restaurant and the cheese fries. ==Merchandise and mascots == Eskimo Joe's is also famous for its branded merchandise. The Eskimo Joe logo, featuring the smiling cartoon Eskimo Joe and his slobbering canine friend Buffy, was created in 1975 by a freshman art student at OSU, Bill Thompson. The company runs a retail outlet connected to the restaurant in Stillwater, as well as a location in Tulsa, and mail- order and online catalog businesses; around the Christmas season, several temporary stores open in malls in cities around the state. ==Restaurants == Eskimo Joe's is part of a chain of themed restaurants, all owned by Clark, that used to be called the \\"Three Amigos.\\" In 1984, Stillwater Bay Oyster Company, a more upscale seafood and steak restaurant, opened; and in 1987, Mexico Joe's rounded out the trio. In 2000, Joseppi's, an Italian-themed restaurant, opened down the street from the relocated Mexico Joe's. The two buildings share the same antique-looking architecture and intricate interior design, and the restaurants share the same price bracket; slightly higher than the burgers and fries of Eskimo Joe's. For a brief time, the four Stan Clark restaurants were referred to as the \\"Fab Four\\" but Stillwater Bay (as its name had been shortened to by then) closed in 2005, returning the chain to the \\"Three Amigos\\" once more. Joseppi's closed on May 24, 2014. The website now informs patrons that a new restaurant, called Mojo’s, would be opening in Fall 2014 that would serve American fare and also contain a bowling alley. It closed in January 2018. Joseppis.com , Retrieved on 30 October 2014. The other restaurants feature mascots - Mexico Joe's is a sombrero and poncho wearing Joe with a donkey (Bucky); Joseppi's is Joe with a twirly Sicilian mustache and chef outfit accompanied by a monkey (Peppino). However, neither version is as popular as Eskimo Joe and Buffy. The restaurant was mentioned by Jimmy Fallon on October 6, 2009 after visiting the establishment for Orange Peel 2009.

He won major nine titles with his main club, including five national championships. ==Club career== Born in Clabecq, Wallonia, Baseggio made an impressive debut for R.S.C. Anderlecht aged 17, against old rivals Standard Liège, and scored his first goal in the same game. At the time a hot prospect for the future, he was in direct competition with Enzo Scifo and Pär Zetterberg, two players whose talent was already confirmed; eventually he became a first-team regular, and then the maestro of the team after the departures of the pair in the late 1990s. With the return of Zetterberg in the summer of 2003, Anderlecht coach Hugo Broos decided that there was no room for both players, and Baseggio found himself with few game opportunities, until the manager was fired in February 2005. After a disappointing end of season, he also played second-choice for new coach Franky Vercauteren; the owner of an extremely powerful shot, he scored the 1–1 equalizer in an eventual 2–1 win against R.A.A.

She is the younger sister of country music entertainer Dolly Parton, and the older sister of singer Randy Parton and actress Rachel Dennison. ==Early life== Stella Mae Parton was born on May 4, 1949, in Sevierville, Tennessee. She is the sixth of 12 children born to Avie Lee Caroline (née Owens; 1923-2003) and Robert Lee Parton, Sr. (1921-2000). Country vocalist Dolly Parton is her elder sister by three years. When Stella was seven, Dolly and she appeared on a local television program, and two years later she debuted on radio. During this time, Stella and her sisters Willadeene and Cassie formed a group who sang gospel music and made commercials around eastern Tennessee. During her high school years, Parton began writing songs. She married Marvin Carroll Rauhuff just prior to her high school graduation in 1966. Parton had one son by this marriage. ==Recording career== In 1967, Parton released her first album, In The Garden (a gospel project with Willadeene, Cassie, and their mother). Shortly thereafter, she moved to Washington, DC and began performing at the Hillbilly Heaven club. Later moving to Nashville, she started her own record label, Soul, Country and Blues, in 1975 and released her debut solo album, I Want to Hold You in My Dreams Tonight. Its title track was a substantial national hit, climbing into the country Top Ten. The success of \\"I Want to Hold You in my Dreams Tonight\\" landed her a major-label deal with Elektra in 1976. Her 1977 duet with Carmol Taylor, \\"Neon Woman\\", was somewhat successful, and she scored three Top 20 hits over 1977-1978 with \\"The Danger of a Stranger\\", \\"Four Little Letters\\", and \\"Standard Lie Number One\\"; she had an additional top-40 hit with her sister Dolly's composition \\"Steady as the Rain\\" in 1979. She recorded a total of three albums for Elektra through 1979. In 1984, Stella performed a song with Kin Vassey for the soundtrack of the movie Rhinestone, in which Dolly starred. Though her chart success tapered off, after she left Elektra in 1980, Stella continued to record, releasing albums for several independent labels, including Accord/Townhouse and Airborne; she is currently with Raptor Records. To date, she has released 22 albums and has had 28 charting singles. Stella has released a DVD, Live in Nashville. The DVD is footage from a 1990 concert in Nashville pulled from the Attic Entertainment archives. It is the first of a planned Vintage Collection Series. ==Television and film work== In 1979, Parton starred in The Dukes of Hazzard episode titled \\"Deputy Dukes\\" as Mary Beth Malone, a woman who impersonates a police officer to settle a family score with a prisoner who ends up being transported by Bo and Luke during a change of venue. During the 1980s and early 1990s, she starred in several Broadway touring musicals, including Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Pump Boys & Dinettes, Best Little Whorehouse In Texas, and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Parton also wrote and staged several Dollywood shows the opening season, as well as appearing on The Dukes of Hazzard (the first country artist to have a dramatic role on the series), Regis, The Today Show, and Good Morning America. She has been on several international radio programs, including Get Focused Radio with host Kate Hennessy. In 2006, Parton made appearances in two films, A Dance for Bethany and Ghost Town, both slated for release in 2007. Each film also includes Stella's music on the soundtrack. Also ready for release in 2007 was her 21st album, which is a collection of original Contemporary Christian songs. Followed in 2008, was her 22nd album, Testimony. Most recently, Stella appeared in Dolly Parton's Coat of Many Colors, an NBC made-for-TV movie based on Dolly's song of the same name that first aired on NBC in December 2015. In 2018, Stella took part in the BBC's Celebrity Masterchef series. ==Social work== She devotes much of her time to causes such as domestic violence, and teaches at the New Opportunity School for Women at Berea College, Kentucky, using her knowledge of hair and makeup to help women build self esteem. Parton has served as national spokesperson for Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the Christian Appalachian Project and National Honorary Country Music Ambassador to the American Cancer Society. ==Consultancy== She also has a consulting business (Attic Entertainment Artist Development and Entertainment Consulting), teaching stage presence, hair, makeup, wardrobe techniques, and video coaching. Parton has also written three cookbooks, including her recipe-packed book State Fairs and Church Bazaars. ==Discography== *In the Garden (1968) *Stella (And the Gospel Carrolls) (1972) *I Want to Hold You in My Dreams (1975) *Country Sweet (1977) *Stella Parton (1978) *Love Ya (1979) *True to Me (1980) *So Far, So Good (1982) *Always Tomorrow (1989) *A Woman's Touch (1995) *Appalachian Blues (2001) *Blue Heart (2002) *Appalachian Gospel (2003) *Songwriter Sessions (2006) *Holiday Magic (2008) *Testimony (2008) *American Coal (2010) *Buried Treasure (2014) *Last Train to Memphis (2015) *Mountain Songbird (2016) *Nashville Nights (2016) *Old Time Singing (2017) *Survivor (2018) ==Awards== Parton received Author of the Year (Artists Music Guild / 2013), Entertainer of the Year, and Album of the Year (Alabama Country and Gospel Music Hall of Fame / 2006), American Old- Time Country Music Hall of Fame (Inductee / 2006), Female Vocalist of the Year (Christian Country Music Association / 2004), and Mainstream Country Artist of the Year (Christian Country Music Association / 2002). ==References== ==External links== *Stella Parton - Country, Gospel & Appalachian Music *Stella Parton on Facebook Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American singers Category:20th-century American women singers Category:21st-century American singers Category:21st-century American women singers Category:American country singer-songwriters Category:American female country singers Category:American Pentecostals Category:Christians from Tennessee Category:People from Sevierville, Tennessee ","title":"Stella Parton"},{"id":"2577541","text":"Robert Post (born Robert Øien Fylling, 1979 in Langevåg, Norway) is a Norwegian singer-songwriter.

Seudot fixed in the calendar (i.e., for holidays and fasts) are also considered seudot mitzvah, but many have their own, more commonly used names. ==Seudat Brit Milah== Attendance at a brit milah (circumcision) and its subsequent seudah is of such great significance that Rabbi Moshe Isserles (\\"the Rama\\") notes that a Talmudic saying that one who is invited but does not participate in the seudat brit milah is ostracized by God.Yoreh De'ah 265:12; see Babylonian Talmud Pesachim 113b; Tosafot Pesachim 114a s.v. \\"Veein\\" For this reason, people are generally not invited, but merely informed of the brit's time and location.Pitchei Teshuva Yoreh Deah 265:18; Arukh HaShulkhan 265:37 Talmudic sages have compared a brit to a Temple sacrifice, and eating at a seudat brit milah to eating a Temple sacrifice. Hasidic Jews generally insist on serving meat at a seudat brit milah since most Temple offerings were meat. Sharing a meal is considered a bonding experience celebrating the covenant between God and the Jewish people.Rabbi Howard Jachter, \\"Minhagim of Brit Milah\\", Kol Torah, accessed March 19, 2006. ==Seudat Pidyon HaBen== Unlike other seudot mitzvah in which the meal (seudah) follows the act or ceremony which warrants the festive meal, the redemption ceremony for a first-born Jewish male child (called Pidyon HaBen in Hebrew), is actually part of the meal. The ceremony is led by a kohen, who ritually washes his hands, recites the blessing over bread, and partakes of some bread before beginning the ceremony. The ceremony, which follows a traditional text, is a verbal exchange between the kohen and the father of the child. The kohen asks the father if he prefers to keep his money, or pay the equivalent of five silver shekels to redeem his child. The father chooses the latter option and hands over the money, as well as recites a special blessing (\\"al pidyon haben\\"). Then the kohen verbalizes the redemption, blesses the child, and says the traditional blessing over a cup of wine, which he then drinks. The seudat mitzvah continues with all guests in attendance washing for bread and partaking of the festive meal. While attending the seudah for a Pidyon Haben, the Vilna Gaon was asked whether it was true that all the Torah's commandments are alluded to in Bereishit, the first portion of the Torah. After the Gaon affirmed this, he was asked where the commandment of pidyon haben was alluded to and the Gaon replied that it was in the word Bereishit, the Hebrew initials which stand for Ben Rishon Achar Sheloshim Yom Tifdeh or \\"a firstborn son after thirty days redeem\\".Rabbi Dov Eliach, \\"Hashem's Torah is Perfect and Complete: The Vilna Gaon's Monumental Torah Edifice\\" , Dei'ah veDibur, accessed March 19, 2006 ==Seudat Bar Mitzvah== Rabbi Shlomo Luria (\\"Maharshal\\") notes that the occasion of a youth becoming obligated to obey the commandments is to be celebrated with a religious feast, usually including a sermon the youth has prepared.Yam Shel Shlomo, Bava Kamma 7:37 It is customary at a bar mitzvah meal for parents to give thanks and praise to God for giving them the merit to raise a child to bar mitzvah and to educate him in the ways of Torah and the commandments.Rabbi Nissan Dovid Dubo, \\"Yalkut Bar Mitzvah: Bar Mitzvah Customs\\" , Chabad Lubavitch, accessed March 16, 2006. Rabbi Ovadiah YosefYabia Omer 2:29 holds that a Bat Mitzvah is also a seudat mitzvah. ==Seudat Siyum Masechet== Based on the Talmud and Midrash, the seudah celebration upon the completion of a Talmudic tractate is considered a seudat mitzvah.Yam Shel Shlomo, Bava Kamma, Merubah 37; Maharam Mintz 119; Shach, Yoreh De'ah 246:37 This seudah is made to rejoice over the accomplishment, and also to motivate and inspire others to do the same. Rabbi Chaim Elazar Shapiro (the \\"Munkatcher Rebbe\\") observes in his work Sha'ar Yissachar that the evil inclination does not want to see this type of shared joy, noting that one of the names of the evil inclination, \\"Sama'el,\\" may be seen as an acronym for Siyum Masechet Ain La'asot, or \\"do not make a siyum\\".Shlomo Katz, \\"Matos-Masei: Power of Prayer\\", Torah.org, accessed March 19, 2006. ==Seudat Hodaa== Seudat HoDaa (Hebrew: סעודת הודיה)sometimes called Seudat HoDaYa literally means a meal of thanksgiving. At a public meal\\".. as a Seudas Hodaa for his recovery ..\\" that is given to recognize the good - Hakarat HaTov - the beneficiary gives something to others - the ability to say blessings - Brachot. ==Seudat Nissuin== During the festive meal following a Jewish wedding ceremony (Hebrew Nissuin), guests participate in the mitzvah (commandment) of L'Sameach Chatan v'Kallah, to bring joy to the groom and bride. The emphasis of the celebration is on entertaining the newlyweds. At Orthodox wedding meals, men and women dance separately - sometimes separated by a divider - for reasons of modesty. At the end of the seudat nissuin, Grace After Meals is recited, and the Sheva Berachot (seven blessings) that were recited under the wedding canopy are repeated. ==Seudat Havraah== Seudat Havraah is the \\"meal of consolation\\" or comfort provided for a mourner upon his or her return from the cemetery following interment of the deceased.Rabbi Mordechai Torczyner, \\"Initial Meal Post-Burial - Seudat Havraah\\", AishDas, accessed March 16, 2006. It usually consists of foods symbolic of life such as boiled eggs and lentil soup. The Talmud states that the lentil stew Jacob was preparing (Genesis 25:29), and for which Esau sold his birthright, was the seudat havraah for his father Isaac who was beginning to sit shiva for his father Abraham.Bava Batra 16b ==Seudat Shabbat and Seudat Yom Tov== These include three meals on the Sabbath, as well as two (dinner and lunch) on each festival day making four each (outside Israel) for Shavuot, Rosh HaShana, Sukkot, two each for Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah, eight (outside Israel) for Passover. The Passover Seders are seudot mitzvah. Except for Seudah Shlishit (the \\"third meal\\" of Shabbat) all of these meals are preceded by Kiddush (the blessing, made over wine, recognizing the holiness of the day). If one recites Kiddush, Jewish law states that one must immediately eat the seudah in the same place that he heard/recited Kiddush.Talmud Bavli, Pesachim 101a At Shabbat meals, it is customary to sing Zemirot (songs), learn Torah (as at meals in general) and discuss the week's portion of Scripture. ==Seudah HaMafseket== Seudah HaMafseketAlt. Seuda mafseket is the \\"separating meal\\" eaten before the fasts of Yom Kippur and Tisha B'Av. The pre-Yom Kippur meal is a festive meal, which may include meat.\\"Yom Kippur: How We Prepare\\" , National Jewish Outreach Program, accessed March 16, 2006. At the pre-Tisha B'Av meal it is forbidden to eat meat, wine, or more than one cooked food.Mishna, Taanit 26b; Babylonian Talmud Taanit 30a Alcoholic beverages should be avoided. The meal is eaten sitting on the ground or a low seat. It is customary to eat a hardboiled egg, and also a piece of bread dipped into ashes, and to say, \\"This is the Tisha B'Av meal.\\" During the meal, three men should not sit together so they will not have to recite the Grace after Meals as a group. None of these restrictions apply when Tisha B'Av occurs on Shabbat or Sunday.\\"Tisha B'Av (The Ninth of Av)\\", Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, accessed March 16, 2006.\\"Tisha BeAv: The Fast of the Ninth of Av\\", Ahavat Israel, accessed March 16, 2006.Taanis,29b: see Rashi ==Seudat Purim== Purim painting, untitled. Safed, Israel, 19th century. Hasidic Jews celebrating Purim with a Sephardic Jew (left). The inscription is part of a passage from the Talmud urging Jews to imbibe enough alcohol so that they will not know the difference between the phrases “cursed is Haman” and “blessed is Mordechai.” On Purim day, typically toward evening, a festive meal called Seudat Purim is held, with wine as a prominent beverage, where drunkenness is not uncommon. The custom of drinking at this meal stems from a statement in the Talmud attributed to a rabbi named Rava that says one should drink on Purim until he can \\"no longer distinguish between arur Haman ('Cursed is Haman') and baruch Mordechai ('Blessed is Mordecai').\\" The reason Rava instituted the custom of drinking was likely as a critique of treating Mordecai as a hero, instead of a villain. Another view is that these phrases have the same numerical value, and some authorities, including the Be'er Hagolah and Magen Avraham, have ruled that one should drink wine until he is unable to calculate these numerical values.) This saying was codified in the Rif, Rosh, Tur, Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim 695), and is interpreted simply (as explained above) by the Chatam Sofer. This interpretation of the Talmudic statement, or the acceptance of the statement itself, is disputed (for various reasons) by the Ba'alei Tosafot (based on the Jerusalem Talmud), Maimonides, Rabbeinu Ephraim, Ba'al HaMa'or, Ran, Orchot Chaim, Be'er Hagolah, Magen Avraham, Taz, Rema, Vilna Gaon, Maharsha, Rashash, Tzeidah LaDerech, Hagahot Maimoniyot, Ra'avyah, Korban N'tan'el, Bach, Maharil, P'ri M'gadim, Kol Bo, Chochmat Mano'ach, Mishnah Berurah (by the Chafetz Chaim), and others. These authorities all advocate drinking wine in some quantity, but all (excepting Hagahot Maimoniyot and Ra'avyah) discourage the level of drunkenness suggested by the Chatam Sofer. The Rema says that one should only drink a little more than he is used to drinking, and then try to fall asleep (whereupon he certainly will not be able to tell the difference between the two phrases indicated by the Talmud). This position is shared by the Kol Bo and Mishnah Berurah, and is similar to that of Maimonides. ==See also== * Shabbat meals * Seudah Shlishit * Melaveh malkah * Psalm 100 * Hakarat HaTov ==References== Category:Gratitude Category:Jewish ceremonial food and drink Category:Jewish festive meals Category:Hebrew words and phrases in Jewish law ","title":"Seudat mitzvah"},{"id":"2577550","text":"Phyllodes are modified petioles or leaf stems, which are leaf-like in appearance and function.

Portlets are pluggable user interface software components that are managed and displayed in a web portal, for example an enterprise portal or a web CMS. A portlet can aggregate (integrate) and personalize content from different sources within a web page. A portlet responds to requests from a web client with and generates dynamic content. Portlets produce fragments of markup (HTML, XHTML, WML) that are aggregated into a portal. Typically, following the desktop metaphor, a portal page is displayed as a collection of non-overlapping portlet windows, where each portlet window displays a portlet. Hence a portlet (or collection of portlets) resembles a web-based application that is hosted in a portal. Some examples of portlet applications are e-mail, weather reports, discussion forums, and news. A portlet is managed by a portlet container. Portlet standards platform independent application programming interfaces that are intended to enable software developers to create portlets that can be plugged into any portal supporting the standards. An example is the Java Portlet Specification. A Java portlet resembles a Java Servlet, but produces fragments rather than complete documents, and is not bound by a URL. A portlet container runs portlets and provides them with the required runtime environment. A portlet container contains portlets and manages their life cycles. It also provides persistent storage mechanisms for the portlet preferences. A portlet container receives requests from the portal to execute requests on the portlets hosted by it. A portlet container is not responsible for aggregating the content produced by the portlets; the portal itself handles aggregation. A portal and a portlet container can be built together as a single component of an application suite or as two separate components of a portal application. == JSR 168 == The Java Portlet Specification V1.0 was developed under the Java Community Process as Java Specification Request JSR 168, and released in its final form in October 2003. The Java Portlet Specification V1.0 introduces the basic portlet programming model with: * two phases of action processing and rendering in order to support the Model-View-Controller pattern. * portlet modes, enabling the portal to advise the portlet what task it should perform and what content it should generate * window states, indicating the amount of portal page space that will be assigned to the content generated by the portlet * portlet data model, allowing the portlet to store view information in the render parameters, session related information in the portlet session and per user persistent data in the portlet preferences * a packaging format in order to group different portlets and other Java EE artifacts needed by these portlets into one portlet application which can be deployed on the portal server. * Portal development as a way to integrate the different web-based applications for supporting deliveries of information and services. ===Portlet Catalog=== Initially Java portal vendors had their own portlet development framework thus those portlets were confined to specific portal servers and couldn't be deployed to the rest of the Java portals. After JSR 168 inception, Java portlets may be deployed on any Java portal servers adhering to JSR 168 specifications. A Portlets Catalog is a set of portlets that are ready-to-use components for enterprise portals. For those who want to adopt portals certainly need many and variety of portlets to deploy and run. Here Portlets catalog are of use. A JSR 168 portlets catalog makes sure that portlets under this catalog may run on any standards–compliant Java portal server. Types of portlet solution (vertical domains and technology) like collaboration, social networking, community, content management, utility, calendaring, HRM all are available in these catalogs. There are many open source and commercial Portlets Catalog available but JSR 168 based solutions are rare. JSR 168 specifications offer suitability to the developers to reuse the code to maintain a set of JSR 168 compliant portlets. For deployers, it's easy to keep a single set of solution and deploy it on many. == JSR 286 == JSR-286 is the Java Portlet specification v2.0 as developed under the JCP and created in alignment with the updated version 2.0 of WSRP. It was released in June 2008. It was developed to improve on the short-comings of the version 1.0 specification, JSR-168. Some of its major features include: * Inter-Portlet Communication through events and public render parameters * Serving dynamically generated resources directly through portlets * Serving AJAX or JSON data directly through portlets * Introduction of portlet filters and listeners == JSR 362 == JSR-362 is the Java Portlet specification v3.0 and was released in April 2017.

The name of the group was taken from the 1927 novel Steppenwolf by German Nobel laureate Hermann Hesse. Also in 1967, in California, the band Steppenwolf named itself after the novel. Their only album Hip (1967) was the first rock album with original Danish lyrics, and has attained near- mythological status in the history of Danish rock. The group was the result of a collaboration between lead singer , who had traveled in the Orient in the early 1960s and wrote the Bob Dylan-inspired, highly symbolic and almost surreal lyrics, and (guitar, vocal), who wrote the drawling, psychedelic, folk-influenced music. The other members were Søren Seirup (bass) and Preben Devantier (drums). A tour in October 1967 came to a chaotic end when a concert was cut short by the police and the group members were arrested for cannabis use. Shortly after being released, Eik Skaløe went on a journey to Afghanistan/Nepal (on the so-called \\"hippie trail\\") and was found dead outside the city of Ferozepore near the Indian/Pakistani border in October 1968, apparently after a drug-induced suicide. Back in Denmark the rest of the group attempted to carry on, but, lacking the characteristic Skaløe as a front figure, quickly dissolved.

The artificial island is being built up by pumping sand from the sea floor, in order to meet the existing and future housing, industrial and commercial development demands of the Malé region. The official settlement was inaugurated by President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom on May 12, 2004. The development and management of the island is undertaken by a government- owned corporation called Housing Development Corporation (formerly Hulhumalé Development Unit/Hulhumalé Development Corporation) which was incorporated on March 23, 2005. Land reclamation has increased the island's area to , making it the fourth largest island in the Maldives. the island has a population of more than 50,000; it is planned to house as many as 240,000 by the mid-2020s. == Location within Malé City == Hulhulmalé is located northeast of the airport island of Hulhulé, to which it is connected by a causeway: ==History== Reclamation of Hulhumalé began on October 16, 1997 on the Hulhulé- Farukolhufushi lagoon off the north west coast of Malé. Initial reclamation (or Phase I) consisting of 45% of land mass, , was carried out by the Ministry of Construction and Public Works (MCPW) at a cost of USD 11 million. The project was then continued by a Belgian Joint Venture Company, International Port Engineering and Management (IPEM) and Dredging International (DI) costing an estimated USD 21 million. All the works involving reclamation and coastal structure development covered in Phase I were completed by June 2002, and 1,000 residents moved to the island in 2004. In the next phase of reclamation, completed in 2015, were added, and by the end of 2019, there were more than 50,000 residents. ==Development== Hulhumalé Road A basis of development known as Phase I was formed under the first Master Plan which was completed in July 2001 by a consortium of consultants from Singapore with the contribution of many government agencies, committees and individuals. It conceptually defines the long-term land use and development strategy (including urban design proposals, transportation plans and utility infrastructure) with considerations for future infrastructure connections to the adjacent Phase II and planned airport extension areas. The Master Plan is to be periodically reviewed and adjusted to include advances in development. Phase I of the Master Plan includes: Hulhumalé Hospital Stage 1A (completed) * A 280-room apartment complex with a combination of 2,3 and 4 bedroom units * An integrated primary and secondary school housing 20 classrooms * A public building for government and social requirements containing 32 units * A hospital with 50 bed capacity * A mosque for 1500 people * Four commercial buildings with a total of 48 units * An asphalt-paved road network approximately long * An adequate land space for the cultivation of indigenous plants and imported varieties Stage 1B (to be completed by December 2005) * 232 condominium housing units * 120 basic housing units * 169 beach plots * 56 standard plots * 132 terraced houses * 280 housing units * 57 residential beach front plots * 109 residential beach plots * 56 residential standard plots * 132 plots for terraced housing * A public building with 32 public units * 15 industrial and commercial land plots with an average of per unit Stage 1C (planned for 2006) * 1900 housing units Stage 2 (targeted for 2016) * 2950 housing units Stage 3 (targeted for 2020) * 3075 housing units Hulhumalé is underutilized relative to other central atolls in the Maldives. It would take the lead of the government to improve utilization by moving government ministers, government departments and public institutions to Hulhumalé and assisting public servants with relocation costs. Pending urban development, greenery landscaping would help make the place more attractive. On 15 January 2015 the second reclamation phase of Hulhumalé was launched, which will include the construction of a youth centre. == Transport == Hulhumalé has road network which was planned together with the development of the island. The network covers the entire island and support all types of road vehicles. The island is connected via a causeway to the airport island Hulhulé Island, allowing road transport to easily travel between the Velana International Airport and Hulhumalé. With the opening of the Sinamalé Bridge between Hulhulé and Malé Island in September 2018, the road networks of the three islands were connected for the first time. ==External links== * Housing Development Corporation * NPR Morning Edition story, 28 Jan 2008 ==References== Category:Islands of the Maldives Category:Populated coastal places in the Maldives Category:Artificial islands of the Maldives Category:Populated places in the Maldives ","title":"Hulhumalé"},{"id":"2577594","text":"Ameen is a surname.

In this context modularity is at the component level, and has a single dimension, component slottability. A modular system with this limited modularity is generally known as a platform system that uses modular components. Examples are car platforms or the USB port in computer engineering platforms. In design theory this is distinct from a modular system which has higher dimensional modularity and degrees of freedom. A modular system design has no distinct lifetime and exhibits flexibility in at least three dimensions. In this respect modular systems are very rare in markets. Mero architectural systems are the closest example to a modular system in terms of hard products in markets. Weapons platforms, especially in aerospace, tend to be modular systems, wherein the airframe is designed to be upgraded multiple times during its lifetime, without the purchase of a completely new system. Modularity is best defined by the dimensions effected or the degrees of freedom in form, cost, or operation. Modularity offers benefits such as reduction in cost (customization can be limited to a portion of the system, rather than needing an overhaul of the entire system), interoperability, shorter learning time, flexibility in design, non-generationally constrained augmentation or updating (adding new solution by merely plugging in a new module), and exclusion. Modularity in platform systems, offer benefits in returning margins to scale, reduced product development cost, reduced O&M; costs, and time to market. Platform systems have enabled the wide use of system design in markets and the ability for product companies to separate the rate of the product cycle from the R&D; paths. The biggest drawback with modular systems is the designer or engineer. Most designers are poorly trained in systems analysis and most engineers are poorly trained in design. The design complexity of a modular system is significantly higher than a platform system and requires experts in design and product strategy during the conception phase of system development. That phase must anticipate the directions and levels of flexibility necessary in the system to deliver the modular benefits. Modular systems could be viewed as more complete or holistic design whereas platforms systems are more reductionist, limiting modularity to components. Complete or holistic modular design requires a much higher level of design skill and sophistication than the more common platform system. Cars, computers, process systems, solar panels, wind turbines, elevators, furniture, looms, railroad signaling systems, telephone exchanges, pipe organs, synthesizers, electric power distribution systems and modular buildings are examples of platform systems using various levels of component modularity. For example, one cannot assemble a solar cube from extant solar components or easily replace the engine on a truck or rearrange a modular housing unit into a different configuration after a few years, as would be the case in a modular system. The only extant examples of modular systems in today's market are some software systems that have shifted away from versioning into a completely networked paradigm. Modular design inherently combines the mass production advantages of standardization, since modularity is impossible without some level of standardization, (high volume normally equals low manufacturing costs) with those of customization. The degree of modularity, dimensionally, determines the degree of customization possible. For example, solar panel systems have 2-dimensional modularity which allows adjustment of an array in the x and y dimensions. Further dimensions of modularity would be introduced by making the panel itself and its auxiliary systems modular. Dimensions in modular systems are defined as the effected parameter such as shape or cost or lifecycle. Mero systems have 4-dimensional modularity, x, y, z, and structural load capacity. As can be seen in any modern convention space, the space frame's extra two dimensions of modularity allows far greater flexibility in form and function than solar's 2-d modularity. If modularity is properly defined and conceived in the design strategy, modular systems can create significant competitive advantage in markets. A true modular system does not need to rely on product cycles to adapt its functionality to the current market state. Properly designed modular systems also introduce the economic advantage of not carrying dead capacity, increasing the capacity utilization rate and its effect on cost and pricing flexibility. ==In vehicles== The modular design of the Unimog offers attachment capabilities for various different implements. Aspects of modular design can be seen in cars or other vehicles to the extent of there being certain parts to the car that can be added or removed without altering the rest of the car. A simple example of modular design in cars is the fact that, while many cars come as a basic model, paying extra will allow for \\"snap in\\" upgrades such as a more powerful engine or seasonal tires; these do not require any change to other units of the car such as the chassis, steering, electric motor or battery systems. ==In machines and architecture== Modular design can be seen in certain buildings. Modular buildings (and also modular homes) generally consist of universal parts (or modules) that are manufactured in a factory and then shipped to a build site where they are assembled into a variety of arrangements. Modular buildings can be added to or reduced in size by adding or removing certain components. This can be done without altering larger portions of the building. Modular buildings can also undergo changes in functionality using the same process of adding or removing components. Modular workstations For example, an office building can be built using modular parts such as walls, frames, doors, ceilings, and windows. The interior can then be partitioned (or divided) with more walls and furnished with desks, computers, and whatever else is needed for a functioning workspace. If the office needs to be expanded or redivided to accommodate employees, modular components such as wall panels can be added or relocated to make the necessary changes without altering the whole building. Later, this same office can be broken down and rearranged to form a retail space, conference hall or another type of building, using the same modular components that originally formed the office building. The new building can then be refurnished with whatever items are needed to carry out its desired functions. Other types of modular buildings that are offered from a company like Allied Modular include a guardhouse, machine enclosure, press box, conference room, two-story building, clean room and many more applications.Allied Modular Products Allied Modular. Retrieved March 27, 2012 Many misconceptions are held regarding modular buildings. In reality modular construction is a viable method of construction for quick turnaround and fast growing companies. Industries that would benefit from this include healthcare, commercial, retail, military, and multi-family/student housing. ==In televisions== In 1963 Motorola introduced the first rectangular color picture tube, and in 1967 introduced the modular Quasar brand. In 1964 it opened its first research and development branch outside of the United States, in Israel under the management of Moses Basin. In 1974 Motorola sold its television business to the Japan-based Matsushita, the parent company of Panasonic. ==In computer hardware== Modular computer design Modular design in computer hardware is the same as in other things (e.g. cars, refrigerators, and furniture). The idea is to build computers with easily replaceable parts that use standardized interfaces. This technique allows a user to upgrade certain aspects of the computer easily without having to buy another computer altogether. This idea was also being implemented in Project Ara, which provided a platform for manufactures to create modules for a smartphone which could then be customised by the end user. A computer is one of the best examples of modular design. Typical modules include power supply units, processors, mainboards, graphics cards, hard drives, and optical drives. All of these parts should be easily interchangeable as long as the user uses parts that support the same standard interface. Similar to the computer's modularity, other tools have been developed to leverage modular design, such as littleBits Electronics, which snap together with interoperable modules to create circuits. ==Integrating the digital twin into modular design== Product lifecycle management is a strategy for efficiently managing information about a product (and product families, platforms, modules, and parts) during its product lifecycle. Researchers have described how integrating a digital twin—a digital representation of a physical product—with modular design can improve product lifecycle management. ==Integrating life-cycle and energy assessments into modular design == Some authors observe that modular design has generated in the vehicle industry a constant increase of weight over time. Trancossi advanced the hypothesis that modular design can be coupled by some optimization criteria derived from the constructal law.Trancossi, M. A response to industrial maturity and energetic issues: a possible solution based on constructal law. Eur. Transp. Res. Rev. (2015) 7: 2. In fact, the constructal law is modular for his nature and can apply with interesting results in engineering simple systems.Bejan A., and Lorente S., \\"Constructal theory of generation of configuration in nature and engineering\\", J. Appl. Phys., 100, 2006, It applies with a typical bottom-up optimization schema: * a system can be divided into subsystems (elemental parts) using tree models; * any complex system can be represented in a modular way and it is possible to describe how different physical magnitudes flow through the system; * analysing the different flowpaths it is possible to identify the critical components that affect the performance of the system; * by optimizing those components and substituting them with more performing ones, it is possible to improve the performances of the system. A better formulation has been produced during the MAAT EU FP7 Project. A new design method that couples the above bottom-up optimization with a preliminary system level top-down design has been formulated.Dumas A, Madonia M, Trancossi M, Vucinic D (2013) \\"Propulsion of photovoltaic cruiser-feeder airships dimensioning by constructal design for efficiency method\\". SAE Int J Aerosp 6(1):273–285. The two step design process has been motivated by considering that constructal and modular design does not refer to any objective to be reached in the design process. A theoretical formulation has been provided in a recent paper, and applied with success to the design of a small aircraft,Trancossi, M., Bingham, C., Capuani, A., Das, S. et al., \\"Multifunctional unmanned reconnaissance aircraft for low- speed and STOL operations\\", SAE Technical Paper 2015-01-2465, 2015. the conceptual design of innovative commuter aircraft,Trancossi, M., Madonia, M., Dumas, A. et al. \\"A new aircraft architecture based on the ACHEON Coanda effect nozzle: flight model and energy evaluation\\".

NetOps includes, but is not limited to, enterprise management, net assurance, and content management. NetOps provides Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) with GIG Situational Awareness to make informed Command and Control decisions. GIG SA is gained through the operational and technical integration of enterprise management and defense actions and activities across all levels of command (strategic, operational and expeditionary forces).DoDI 8410.02, NetOps for the Global Information Grid (GIG), dated December 19, 2008 The GIG includes any DoD system, equipment, software, or service that transmits, stores, or processes DoD information, and any other associated services necessary to achieve information superiority. The three essential tasks are as follows: * GIG Enterprise Management (GEM) * GIG Net Assurance (GNA) * GIG Content Management (GCM) The synergy achieved by each integrated relationship between any two of the essential tasks (GEM, GNA, and GCM) produces the following NetOps desired effects in support of the overall goal of NetOps which is to provide the right information to the edge: * Assured System and Network Availability * Assured Information Protection * Assured Information Delivery The element of NetOps known as Situational Awareness (SA), is the primary ability to improve the quality and timeliness of collaborative decision-making. To be effective, much of the SA must be shared in near-real-time by the decision-makers who have the ability to take this information, conduct critical analysis and act on those decisions with regards to employment, protection and defense of the GIG. This shared Situational Awareness is derived from common reporting requirements using functionally standardized management tools and common data information exchange formats across the Defense Department. These capabilities collect (or receive), and fuse (enterprise management, network defense and configuration management) data in a real time or near real-time fashion to produce defined views of the mission critical GIG information of concern to a commander or NetOps center. The DoD NetOps Community strives to obtain common visibility of network resources so that these can be manage, anticipate and mitigate problems, ensuring uninterrupted availability and protection of the GIG and provide for graceful degradation, self-healing, failover, diversity, and elimination of critical failure points.

United States Strategic Command Official Website ==Background== In 1998, the Department of Defense recognized a growing cyber threat and in response created the Joint Task Force — Computer Network Defense (JTF-CND), which achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) on 30 December 1998 and Full Operational Capability (FOC) by June 1999. In the fall of 2000, in accordance with DoD doctrine, JTF-CND became the Joint Task Force — Computer Network Operations (JTF-CNO). In October 2002, the new Unified Command Plan (UCP), Change 2, re-aligned JTF-CNO under the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM). The JTF-CNO began its largest and most comprehensive transformation in April 2004 when the Commander of US Strategic Command approved the Joint Concept of Operations for GIG Network Operations. This “NetOps CONOPS” provided the common framework and command and control structure to conduct the USSTRATCOM Unified Command Plan (UCP) - assigned mission of Global Network Operations (NETOPS), combining the disciplines of Enterprise Systems (EM) and Network Management (NM), Computer Network Defense (CND), and Information Dissemination Management (IDM). The Secretary of Defense signed a delegation of authority letter on 18 June 2004, designating the Director, DISA as the new Commander of the Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations. With this designation, the new command assumed the responsibility for directing the operation and defense of the GIG. This transformation enhanced the JTF GNO's mission and objectives in achieving the Joint Vision 2020 Objective Force and the evolving concept of Net-Centricity. As new concepts such as Network-centric warfare and Joint Vision 2010 arrived in the mid 1990s, it became clear that the center of gravity for U.S. military warfighting capability was shifting towards the network. A corresponding capability was required to move beyond managing the network as a back-office system into a domain of warfighting.Network-Centric Warfare: Its Origin and Future, By Vice Admiral Arthur K. Cebrowski, U.S. Navy, and John J. Garstka, Proceedings, January 1998 NetOps was originally developed under the leadership of then United States Pacific Command J6 Brigadier General James Bryan during the stand-up of the USCINCPAC Theater C4I Coordination Center (TCCC) at Camp H. M. Smith, Hawaii in 1999.IA Newsletter, Volume 3, Number 4, USPACOM Theater Network Operations, Ensuring Information Superiority for the 21st Century The TCCC initiative was constructed of two distinct components - the technology that formed the vision of the GIG and the NetOps initiative; and the partnerships that made it a reality. Through its working relationships with DISA, the Service Components, Sub-Unified Commands, JTFs, other CINC TCCC's, and the Joint Staff, USCINCPAC TCCC made the initial strides towards achieving Information Superiority and true enterprise-level processes. The USCINCPAC TCCC was a pilot program for the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASD/C3I) NetOps concept. The NetOps concept began with the development of the architectural framework for NetOps, and a USCINCPAC developed Concept of Operations (CONOPS) outlining the key players and their roles and responsibilities necessary to develop the NetOps construct in the Pacific Theater. IA Newsletter, Volume 4, Number 4, Partnership's - The Key to Success for Pacific Theater Network Operations (NetOps) The original NetOps construct consisted of Network Management (NM), Information Assurance (IA), and Information Dissemination Management (IDM). Today the construct has evolved into GIG Enterprise Management (GEM), GIG Net Assurance(GNA), and GIG Content Management which roughly equates to the intent of the original NetOps concept. ==NetOps Vision== “We must change the paradigm in which we talk and think about the network; we must ‘fight’ rather than ‘manage’ the network and operators must see themselves as engaged at all times, ensuring the health and operation of this critical weapons system.” Donald Rumsfeld, United States Secretary of Defense (2001 - 2006) \\"The US government and the US military must become still more joint, more agile, more decentralized, more networked, and better arranged to share information and coordinate actions.\\" Secretary Rumsfeld speaking at a NetCentric Warfare Conference (NCW) 2008. Donald Rumsfeld, United States Secretary of Defense (2001 - 2006) “This version of the NetOps CONOPS documents the lessons learned by Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations and the NetOps community through operations, exercises, and other events. We will continue to work with the NetOps Community as we translate the concepts set forth in this document into doctrine, policy and joint tactics, techniques, and procedures that strengthen the operations and defense of the Global Information Grid in support of warfighter business and intelligence operations.” General James E. Cartwright, Commander, United States Strategic Command(2004- August 2007) “The Strategic Vision for the JTF GNO is to lead an adaptive force that assures the availability, delivery, and protection of the Global Information Grid. The NetOps framework, effects, and organizational relationships described herein formulate a foundation for the operational future of the GIG, but these will not happen automatically, nor will they occur without significant effort from the entire NetOps Community. Attaining the vision will require cooperation, innovation, and execution from all mission partners and everyone who touches the GIG.” (From \\"Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations Strategic Plan, An Adaptive Force Ensuring Information Delivery\\", February 2006. The adaptive force assures availability, delivery and protection of infrastructure, systems, and information.) LtGen Charles E. Croom, Commander, JTF GNO.JTF GNO Strategic Plan, An Adaptive Force Ensuring Information Delivery, February 2006 ==Mission== The Unified Command Plan (UCP) assigns the Cyber Mission to Commander, US Strategic Command. NetOps falls under the Cyber-Umbrella as a construct to \\"operate and defend the GIG.\\" The NetOps mission is to operate and defend the GIG. Unlike many missions with a defined completion date, NetOps has been established as a standing Joint Force mission necessitating dedicated leadership and resources to execute. NetOps provides assured NetCentric services to the DoD in support of full spectrum of warfighting operations, intelligence, and business missions throughout the GIG enterprises, seamlessly, end-to-end. An objective of NetCentric services is to quickly get information to decision makers, with adequate context, to make better decisions affecting the mission and to project their decisions forward to their forces for action. If the decision maker is not getting the needed net-centric services, the GIG NetOps community must collaboratively determine who must take action and how information flow can be optimized. This requires NetOps personnel to have a shared SA as well as the technologies, procedures, and collaborative organizational structures to rapidly assess and respond to system and network degradations, outages, or changes in operational priorities. All functions required to most effectively support GIG operations will be holistically managed. The effectiveness of NetOps will be measured in terms of availability and reliability of net-centric services, across all domains, in adherence to agreed-upon service levels and policies. The method for service assurance in a NetCentric collaborative environment is to establish operational thresholds, compliance monitoring, and a clear understanding of the capabilities between enterprise service/resource providers and consumers through Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Proper instrumentation of the GIG will enable monitoring of adherence to these SLAs, as well as enable timely decision-making, service prioritization, resource allocation, root cause, and mission impact assessment. Subsequent TTPs and SLAs will be formalized with appropriate implementation policies to enforce compliance. == See also == * Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations * United States Strategic Command * United States Cyber Command * Global Information Network Architecture * Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert == References == ==External links== *United States Strategic Command Official Website *Joint Task Force Global Network Operations (JTF GNO) - Requires PKI/CAC *Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Information Assurance/NetOps *DoD IA Policy Chart - Build and Operate a Trusted GIG Category:Warfare post-1945 Category:United States Department of Defense information technology Category:Joint military units and formations of the United States ","title":"NetOps"},{"id":"2577637","text":"Cedar Lake is a lake in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, and part of the city's Chain of Lakes.

He was held up by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia to be a model of a hard-worker in the former Yugoslavia. ==Early life and family== Alija Sirotanović, a Bosniak, was born in Orahovo, a village in central Bosnia near the town of Breza, and grew up in Trtorići, another nearby village. He was born in 1914, while Bosnia and Herzegovina was a part of Austria-Hungary. He had six brothers and two sisters, all of whom were miners. One of his brothers, Ahmed, died in a mining disaster in 1970. ==Mining record and fame== Sirotanović worked in the coal mine in Breza. In 1947 Sirotanović set a record in coal extracting. On 24 July 1949, Sirotanović participated in an inter-mine competition at the mine at Kreka. He and his eight-man crew mined in an 8-hour shift 128 carloads of brown coal, that is, 152 tons of coal in a single shift, some 40 tonnes more than the first record of Soviet 'hero of labour' Alexey Stakhanov, although this is in dispute. The achievements of the Yugoslav miners were published on news front pages for weeks. In September 1949, the first \\"formal meeting of the initiators of the movement for high productivity\\" (svečani sastanak inicijatora pokreta za visoku produktivnost) was held, in which famous productive working record-holders participated, such as Alija Sirotanović, Nikola Skobić, Risto Mijatović, Antun Bičić, Alojz Petek, and others. As there was a Soviet–Yugoslav rift at the time of the contest, his accomplishment was widely praised and publicised by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Josip Broz Tito is said to have offered to fulfill any wish Sirotanović had, but all Sirotanović is reported to have requested was a bigger shovel. Tito granted his wish, and the larger shovel that was designed for him was later named after him: Sirotanovićka. He was offered an appartement in Breza, but he refused and decided to stay in his house in Trtorići. The meeting between Sirotanović and leading politician Svetozar Vukmanović was televised. Sirotanović tried to enter politics, but was unsuccessful. He was a member of the federal parliament for one term. He was retired with pension for merits. He was made an honorable member of the Union of Associations of Engineers and Technicians of Yugoslavia. ==Legacy== He was held up by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia to be a model of a hard-worker. In 1987, Zabranjeno Pušenje recorded a song titled \\"Srce, ruke i lopata\\" (Heart, Hands and Shovel), paying tribute to \\"Comrade Avdija\\", the model of a hard working, modest man. ===Banknote=== dinar banknote, which does not show Sirotanović He was pictured on the 20,000-Yugoslav dinar banknote, but was often wrongly claimed to be pictured on the 10-dinar banknote.

The newer 20,000-dinar banknote was brought out on May Day in 1987. ==References== ==External links== * https://web.archive.org/web/20051126110554/http://www.bhdani.com/arhiva/102/citanka02.htm * https://web.archive.org/web/20050902124953/http://www.bhdani.com/arhiva/186/t18611.shtml * Alija on Leksikon YU mitologije * Text of song Srce, ruke i lopata Category:1914 births Category:1990 deaths Category:People from Breza, Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Bosniaks of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina Muslims Category:Yugoslav coal miners Category:Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ","title":"Alija Sirotanović"},{"id":"2577660","text":"The Portuguese Podengo is hound (sight and scent) breed from Portugal. As a breed, the Podengo is divided into three size categories that are not interbred: small (Pequeno), medium (Médio) and large (Grande). Their coats are either short and 'smooth', or longer and 'wired'. The smooth coated variety is traditional, whereas the wire coated variety is an outcome of the assimilation of various other breeds during the 20th century. In general, the breed is healthy; the Pequeno (small) variety has an average lifespan of approximately 15–17 years. All Podengo types are hardy, intelligent and lively dogs, excelling at agility and making fine companions. Loyal and fearless, Podengos are also good house guards and are amenable to training by dog experienced people and those that enjoy primitive (unrefined, \\"less domesticated\\") dog behavior. Keen hunting dogs, the Podengo has an affinity for game regardless of size. Typically, the dogs hunt in a pack with their handler following. When game is found, they kill and retrieve it, or flush it towards the hunter to be shot. Each size category traditionally hunts game appropriate to their size and temperament. (Pequeno: rabbits; Medio: rabbits and wild boar; Grande: deer and wild boar). ==Registration and representation== * The Portuguese Podengo in the UK is represented by The Portuguese Podengo Club of Great Britain (https://podengos.org) and The Northern Portuguese Podengo Association, and the Podengo Pequeno was recognized by the Kennel Club in 2003. The Breed Standard was approved on January 1, 2006. The Podengo Pequeno was transferred from the Import Register into the Breed Register on January 1, 2008 at the Kennel Club. The Podengo Pequeno now has its own breed classes at Championship Shows and Open Shows (the other sizes are in the process of being included). The Podengo Pequeno was shown at Crufts for the first time in 2009. There are approximately 500 Podengos (primarily Pequeno) now resident in the UK. * All three sizes and varieties of the Portuguese Podengo have been registered at the United Kennel Club since 2004 and are in the Sighthound & Pariah Group. The Podengo Pequeno became AKC recognized in January 2013 and is now registered there. Incorporated in 2009, Portuguese Podengo Pequenos of America is the AKC club for the breed in the US and is mostly in a few western states and the Midwest. The Portuguese Podengo Pequeno Club of America (PPPCA), founded in 2001,Portuguese Podengo Club Yearbook 2010, Great Britain, pp.45–51. is the first and largest club of Podengo Pequeno owners in the US and is in 40 states. They are the only club dedicated to BOTH the wire coat and the smooth coat varieties of the breed. The PPPCA was incorporated in January 2003 in Newport, Rhode Island and 85% of its members own Portuguese Podengo Pequenos. Other organizations that recognize the Podengo (all sizes) in the US are the United Kennel Club, American Rare Breed Association, North American Kennel Club and The American Sighthound Field Association. The Portuguese Podengo Medio and Grande are represented in the United States by The American Portuguese Podengo Medio/Grande Club (APPMGC or 'MGC'). The United Kingdom registers the most Podengos, followed by Finland, the United States and Portugal. In Europe, the Podengo is classified by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) as Group 5: Spitz and primitive type, Section 7: Primitive type hunting dogs. The FCI breed standard, which originates in Portugal, governs all types and varieties of the Portuguese Podengo. In both the United States and the UK the Portuguese Podengo is classified in the Hound Group. == Types and varieties == There are three sizes of Podengos: Podengo Pequeno, Podengo Medio and Podengo Grande. Within each size type are two varieties: smooth (also referred to as smooth coat) and wire (also referred to as wire coat, rough coat, wirehaired or longhaired). All of these types are called 'Portuguese Podengo' as a 'breed,' although none of these six types are interbred. # Portuguese Podengo Pequeno (Smooth) # Portuguese Podengo Pequeno (Wire) # Portuguese Podengo Medio (Smooth) # Portuguese Podengo Medio (Wire) # Portuguese Podengo Grande (Smooth) # Portuguese Podengo Grande (Wire) In its home country, the Podengo is referred to as Small, Medium or Large Podengo. It is acceptable for the hair description to come before or after the 'type' name. In the United States, the American Kennel Club split the Podengo Pequeno from the other two varieties as a separate breed. This was done primarily to prevent the interbreeding of the Pequeno with the Medio. == General information == The Grande (large) was developed for deer and wild boar hunting. It will exhaust and hold down the prey and await the hunter's gun. The Grande is now very rare in its home country. The Medio (medium) was developed for rabbit chasing, flushing, hunting and retrieval. Its hunting style includes catlike stalking and, similar to the Ibizan Hound, it often jumps above the prey before landing on or near it to flush it out of dense brush, rock crevices or burrows. It will dig if necessary to flush prey. The Pequeno (small) was also developed for flushing rabbits from cover. It is also a good mouser. In the United States, the United Kennel Club (UKC) represents the breed as shown in Portugal and all FCI countries — the three sizes, all with two coat varieties — as one breed. The American Kennel Club (AKC) has divided the breed into the Portuguese Podengo Pequeno and the Portuguese Podengo (which includes both the Grande and Medio). The Portuguese Podengo is represented by the American Portuguese Podengo Medio/Grande Club. The Pequeno entered the AKC Miscellaneous Class in January 2011 and entered the Hound Group in January 2013. The Portuguese Podengo (which includes the Grande and Medio) entered the AKC Miscellaneous Class on January 1, 2014. ==Portuguese Podengo Pequeno == ===Appearance=== Smooth Coat Portuguese Podengo Pequeno The Portuguese Podengo Pequeno is characterized by a wedge shaped head, with erect ears and a curved tail. The AKC breed standards include the following points: *Height: *Weight: *Color: yellow or fawn *Coat: wire coat (a rough, single coat — no undercoat; does shed but not very much) or smooth coat (a dense smooth coat with undercoat that is low maintenance. It naturally sheds dust and dirt and dries very quickly) ===Temperament=== Podengo Pequeno are small, friendly, hardy, lively and intelligent companions. They are very active and usually good with children and other animals when socialized from an early age. They enjoy time with their human family. Like their Medio relatives, they are very watchful and observant and will bark when something gets their attention. They enjoy running and sunshine and must have a secure enclosed fence. The Podengo Pequeno is trained well with positive techniques and should be kept on leash all of the time during training as they can be quite autonomous and have their own ideas about what constitutes proper behavior. They can be remarkably silly in the home. A walk with many Pequenos can be a delight and they will continually come back to the owner to make sure they are coming along.Wire Coat Portuguese Podengo Pequeno. ===History=== Wire Coat Pequenos were first shown in the United States in 2001 when Chicharro de Viamonte, owned by Marilyn Piurek and Kip Bergstrom, was exhibited at an ARBA show in Boston. He was the first Podengo to ever be shown in the United States and the first Podengo Pequeno champion in ARBA and Rarities. Smooth coat Pequenos were first shown in the United States in 2003. The Viamonte podengos were the first family of Podengos pequenos in the United States, followed by Gelado de Viamonte \\"Chico\\" in 2004. Wire Coat Pequenos were first imported to the UK in 2002. The smooth coated Pequeno followed in 2004. Most (75%)of the purebred Portuguese Podengos in the United States consist of the Pequeno size, and most of these (85%) are of the wire coat variety. ==Portuguese Podengo Medio == Smooth Coat Portuguese Podengo Médio ===Appearance=== *WIRE COAT The WPM is a medium-sized type with a rough coat that functions as an air conditioner in the hot weather. This coat was preferred in the South of their native Portugal, which is very warm. The single coat (without undercoat) does shed but not very much. *SMOOTH COAT The SPM is a medium-sized type with a dense smooth single layer coat that is extremely low maintenance. It naturally sheds dust and dirt and dries very quickly. For that reason the Smooth Coat variety is preferred in the North of their native Portugal, which has rainy winters. The single coat (without undercoat) does shed but not very much. ===Temperament=== Both kinds of Podengo Medio are friendly, hardy and intelligent companions. They are very active and usually good with children and other animals, including livestock, especially when socialized from an early age. They are watchful and observant and will bark when something gets their attention. Most enjoy digging and need a secure fence, optimally enclosing their own yard. As they are very agile, regular fencing might not be enough, as they are excellent jumpers and climbers. The best way to address this is with a high enough fence to prevent jumping and a \\"fence\\" below the ground, preferably of hardware cloth. When trained, Podengo Medios can have good recall when not on leash. While hiking with them, they generally stay in visual distance and \\"check\\" on their owners frequently, always being aware of their position (although that can mean a few acres away). Of course, they must be trained with a reliable recall first. They are enthusiastic, trainable dogs. This led them to star in a number of movies in the 1990s and 2000s, including Dante's Peak, Three Wishes, Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco, Zeus and Roxanne, Secondhand Lions, Can of Worms and Soccer Dog: The Movie. Also The Lake House ===History=== The Portuguese Podengo Medio, both smooth and wire-haired, has existed, unregistered, in the United States for decades in small numbers with Portuguese-Americans in private home settings, where they have been used for traditional rabbit hunting. They were never really popularized outside of their immigrant homesteads. They are attractive, nice family dogs, with a touch of mischief. The first group of Podengo Medio fanciers met in the US in the early 1990s via the early Internet Gopher system. Registered purebred Smooth Podengo Medios began being shown in America in 2004 and registered purebred Wirehaired Podengo Medios began being shown in America in 2005. The first Wirehaired Podengo Medio to be shown in North America was AM/CDN Ch Evita V.D. Kleiheuvel, owned by Mary Dixon at a United Kennel Club show in Belleville, Michigan. Evita became the first WPM United States Champion (with the United Kennel Club) and the first Canadian Podengo Champion (with the Canine Federation of Canada). The first Podengo Medio born in North America was Ch Marcos de Retrouvaille and was bred by Dixon. The first Podengo to earn an American Kennel Club Tracking Dog title (on February 17, 2008) was Jolena De Retrouvaille WM, bred by Mary Dixon. Still rare, breeders in Portugal primarily breed for rabbit hunting, not pets. They are hunting dogs, often kept in kennels, not in homes. The idea of Wirehaired Podengo Medios being kept more as house pets began with breeders in Europe. ==Portuguese Podengo Grande== Wire Coat Portuguese Podengo Grande ===Appearance=== *WIRE COAT The WPG is a large-sized type with a tough but even temperament and a rough coat that primarily functions as a briar- protectant when hunting wild boar. The single coat (without undercoat) does shed but not very much. Registered WPGs are very rare, even in its home country and is not yet available to export. *SMOOTH COAT The SPG is a large- sized type with a dense smooth single layer coat that also functions as a briar-protectant when hunting wild boar. The registered SPG is still rare in its home country, with very few individuals available for export. ===Temperament=== Both kinds of Podengo Grande are known to be tough, hardy and intelligently observant animals. They must be socialized very well and carefully by a primitive breed-experienced handler. They are used primarily for hunting wild boar in large packs, where they are released from kennel trucks and sent to chase the boar to its den. They then continue to harass it until it emerges in its attack mode. The dogs then jump in and attach to the boar from all angles and dispatch it swiftly. The waiting hunter can then retrieve the prey. They will be good guardians and require a securely fenced yard (at least 6 ft tall). They enjoy digging dens, also, like their other Podengo relations. It is most closely related to the Podengo Medio, in fact, Podengo Medios which grow too tall for the Medio standard may be classified as Podengo Grandes. This arrangement does not exist in any other way within the Podengo group. Training will be firm but fair with the Podengo Grande as it must have respect for its handler and be amenable to training. ===History=== The Portuguese Podengo Grande may have existed, unregistered, in North America with Portuguese-Americans in private home settings, where they have been used for deer and wild pig hunting. The first Podengo Grande was imported to the US in 2008 and the first litter born in 2009 as well as the import of four Grande of the wire coat variety. 2010 brought the second litter of Grande. Breeders in Portugal continue to breed primarily for hunting and the Podengo Grande is kept and raised in kennels. There is a unique system currently in place in Portugal where unregistered dogs (denoted by the kennel club of Portugal as R.I. or 'Initial Registration') may be evaluated by breed experts and used in a breeding program. Succeeding generations, also evaluated by said experts, may eventually result in a three generation pedigree of known, evaluated, 'R.I.' dogs, which would thus create a full pedigree for certain formerly \\"RI\\" Podengos. This process is carried forth under rules established by the CPC and is not exportable to other countries, as it relies on the presence of indigenous wild specimens of the breed. In the United States, the American Kennel Club (AKC) has determined that the Medio and Grande sizes together are to be called the 'Portuguese Podengo' as one breed. It will be registered by the AKC in the Hound Group. == References == Category:FCI breeds Category:Hounds Category:Dog breeds originating in Portugal Category:Rare dog breeds ","title":"Portuguese Podengo"},{"id":"2577666","text":"Douglas Hewitt Hacking, 1st Baron Hacking (4 August 1884 – 29 July 1950) was a British Conservative politician.

Barozzi translated many works of the ancients, including Proclus’s edition of Euclid's Elements (published in Venice in 1560), as well as mathematical works by Hero, Pappus of Alexandria, and Archimedes. ==Mathematics== Admirandum illud geometricum problema tredecim modis demonstratum, 1586 Barozzi helped in the general reappraisal of the geometry of Euclid, and corresponded with numerous mathematicians, including the German Jesuit Christopher Clavius. His original works include Cosmographia in quatuor libros distributa summo ordine, miraque facilitate, ac brevitate ad magnam Ptolemaei mathematicam constructionem, ad universamque astrologiam institutens (1585), which he dedicated to the Duke of Urbino. This work concerns the cosmography and mathematical systems of Ptolemy. Barozzi also discussed 13 ways of drawing a parallel line in his Admirandum illud geometricum problema tredecim modis demonstratum quod docet duas lineas in eodem plano designare, quae nunquam invicem coincidant, etiam si in infinitum protrahantur: et quanto longius producuntur, tanto sibiinuicem propiores euadant (1586). In his Opusculum: in quo una Oratio et due Questiones, altera de Certitude et altera de Medietate Mathematicarum continentur, Barozzi stressed that \\"the certitude of mathematics is contained in the syntactic rigor of demonstrations.\\" Barozzi dedicated this work to Daniele Barbaro.Venice and the Renaissance, Manfredo Tafuri, trans. Jessica Levine, 1989, MIT Press, p. 133 ==Other works== He also wrote Rythmomachia (1572), which he dedicated to Camille Paleotti, a Senator of Bologna, a work that is based on the mathematical game of the same name, also known as \\"The Philosophers' Game.\\" As an antiquarian, he copied many Greek inscriptions on Crete. His collection of inscriptions was later inherited by his nephew Iacopo Barozzi (1562–1617), who edited and expanded it. This collection was later acquired in 1629 by the University of Oxford. They are wide-ranging in date and subject matter and can still be found in the Bodleian Library. ==Charges of sorcery== Barozzi was accused of being a sorcerer, a charge that he did not help refute by publishing his Pronostico Universale di tutto il mondo (Bologna, 1566), a collection of the prophecies of Nostradamus for the years 1565–1570. He also published a special edition of Oracula Leonis in 1577, a collection of cryptic prophecies attributed to the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise and dedicated to the Cretan governor, Giacomo Foscarini. Around 1583, Barozzi was tried by the Inquisition on an unknown charge and found guilty. In 1587, he was charged with apostasy, heresy, and for engaging in the occult. He was accused of causing a torrential rain storm in Crete. Found guilty, he was forced to donate silver crosses at the cost of 100 ducats and received a suspended prison sentence. Barozzi as a student in college also was accused of cutting off someones hair for uses unknown, perhaps his sorcery habits. ==Death and legacy== He died in Venice. The lunar crater Barocius is named after him. ==References== ==External links== * *The Galileo Project *Text of Barozzi's Translation of Hero *Michele Sbacchi, Euclidism and Theory of Architecture (abstract) *Online Galleries, History of Science Collections, University of Oklahoma Libraries High resolution images of works by and/or portraits of Francesco Barozzi in .jpg and .tiff format.

He is also a co-founder of webcomics collectives Blank Label Comics and Halfpixel. Straub and Scott Kurtz have co-created the animated series Blamimation with Kris and Scott, and the live-action comedy webseries Kris and Scott's Scott and Kris Show for Penny Arcade's PATV. He currently hosts the podcast 28 Plays Later alongside Paul Verhoeven. Straub also manages and writes for the horror fiction site Ichor Falls, which is notable for the creepypasta Candle Cove, and creates YouTube videos for his horror anthology channel, Local 58. ==Career== ===As a cartoonist=== Straub launched his first comic, Checkerboard Nightmare, online in 2000. The strip was self-aware, using metahumour extensively, and the title character, Checkerboard Nightmare (Chex) being obsessed with gaining fame as a webcomic character and willing to do anything necessary to achieve it. In 2005, Straub began creating Starslip, a daily science fiction/comedy webcomic. Starslip Crisis was first set in the 3440s, aboard the starship IDS Fuseli, named after painter Henry Fuseli.http://www.starslip.com/concepts.shtml The Fuseli was a former luxury warship which has been converted into a starship museum. It is still capable of military activities. The Fuseli travelled from system to system with its exhibits (using a faster than light \\"starslip drive\\"), the comic chronicling the adventures of the crew. Much of the art featured upon the Fuseli dated from the 20th or 21st centuries. Starslip Crisis was part of the webcomics cooperation collective Blank Label Comics, until Straub split away from Blank Label to merge Starslip with his new collective, Halfpixel, in November 2007. The comic initially ran under the name Starshift Crisis. The nearly identical Starslip Crisis appeared early in the strip's run, with its own website and associated content, differing only in that the term \\"starslip\\" replaced \\"starshift\\". The two ran in parallel, until a strip in August 2005 which definitively ended the plot of Starshift Crisis, but which played out differently in Starslip Crisis. Reportedly the name change was caused by a legal issue. ===Writer and producer=== In December 2006, Straub was named co- writer and co-producer alongside Scott Kurtz on PvP: The Series, a series of animated shorts featuring the PvP characters. In 2007, to coincide with his move to Dallas, Straub repurposed the Halfpixel site to serve as a hub for his and Kurtz's joint creative projects. Halfpixel later expanded to include webcartoonists Brad Guigar and Dave Kellett of the comics Evil Inc. and Sheldon, respectively. The four published How To Make Webcomics through Image Comics in the first quarter of 2008. The book covers a variety of topics of interest for beginning and intermediate webcartoonists.Drawn.ca review of How To Make Webcomics Straub went on to co-produced Blamimation and the Kris and Scott’s Scott and Kris Show for Penny Arcade TV. In 2012, ShiftyLook announced that Straub and Kurtz were co-producing a new animated web series, Mappy: The Beat, in which they also voice all the characters. The series premiered in July 2013 and aired for 13 episodes. Straub manages and writes for his own horror fiction website Ichor Falls, which features his most notable work of short fiction, Candle Cove. Straub's original short story is in the form of a series of forum posts by people reminiscing about a children's show called Candle Cove. Although it seems at first to be a normal children's program, they gradually recall disturbing aspects of the program and a bizarre episode in particular, before discovering that Candle Cove was merely half an hour of TV static which the children believed was a program.Candle Cove , Kris Straub ===Podcast host=== Straub has co-hosted numerous podcasts, most of which center around the online comic industry, daily life, or comedy talk shows. In 2005, while part of the comic collective Blank Label Comics, Straub and Dave Kellett co-hosted the Blank Label Comics Podcast. The podcast interviewed fellow webcomic creators about their comics and creative process. In 2007, leading up to the release of How To Make Webcomics, Straub - alongside the books co-authors, Scott Kurtz, Brad Guigar, and Dave Kellett - produced the podcast Webcomics Weekly.Webcomics Weekly The show featured comic industry news, techniques and general advice on how to create and maintain a successful comic online. In this same time period, Straub and Kurtz also produced two joint podcasts, The Kris and Scott Power Hour and Daily Affirmation. From 2009 to 2012, Straub also hosted comedy internet radio talk show Tweet Me Harder with David Malki. The show was recorded live and had the hosts interact with a Twitter feed of listeners' reactions to the broadcast, occasionally using comments as a springboard for their conversations. Following Tweet Me Harder, Straub then co-hosted Chainsawsuit: The Podcast with Mikey Neumann. The show began in April 2013 and spanned to December 2014 and included contents such as comedic sketches, satire, movie reviews, and general discussion. Beginning in January 2015, Straub and Neumann began hosting Morning Rush, which ended in June 2015 after 16 episodes. In 2016, from July to December, Straub co-hosted horror podcast Scared Yet? with cartoonist Abby Howard. It lasted 6 episodes, with Straub and Howard discussing horror storytelling, writing advice, personal favorite horror stories, as well as personal experiences with writing horror. ==References== ==External links== * Straub's personal hub site * Category:Living people Category:American webcomic creators Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Kris Straub"},{"id":"2577681","text":"Jataí, Goiás, Brazil is a municipality in southern Goiás state, Brazil.

The name Dowd is an Anglicisation of the original Uí Dubhda (pronounced O'duv/ha or O'Dooda), through its more common form O'Dowd. The Uí Dubhda are one of the Clann Uí Fiachrach, one of the major families of Irish clans. ==The Uí Faichrach -- early origins== There are many people of Irish descent who can justly claim an ancestry as ancient and royal as that of any of the famous European dynasties. Among them are the O'Dubhda family (pronounced \\"O'Dooda\\"), including the O'Dowda, O'Dowd and other variant spellings, who are descended (with many other families) from a people in the West of Ireland once known as the Uí Faichrach (\\"Ee Fee-a-crock\\"). This name derived from a 5th Century pagan king of Connacht called Fiachra (\\"Fee-a- cra\\"). His grandson Daithi (\\"Daw-hee\\") also became king and was killed by lightning about A.D. 445. His grandson Aillil (\\"Al-ill\\") succeeded as King of Connacht and later King of Tara until A.D. 482. ==The O'Dubhda surname== The Uí Faichrach provided successive kings of Connacht for a long period, but their sphere of influence became confined to North Connacht. In the late 10th Century, their king was named Aedh Ua Dubhda -- i.e. Hugh, the grandson of Dubhda (\\"Dooda\\"). He was king of an area roughly corresponding to the two counties of Mayo and Sligo. He is recorded as having \\"died an untroubled death\\" in the year A.D. 982, making this surname one of the oldest in Europe. As the use of surnames became more widespread, descendants continued to use the name O'Dubhda to distinguish their own royal family. This is pronounced \\"O'Dooda,\\" but there are as many as forty different variations on the surname. ==The O'Dubhda Taoiseach== The O'Dubhda remained kings of North Connacht until the 13th Century. However, great changes took place in Irish society and they lost control over much of their former lands before being confined to the barony of Tireragh (\\"Tea-rare-ra\\"), meaning \\"the country of Fiachra,\\" in County Sligo. As a result, they gradually dropped the use of the title \\"king.\\" It was replaced in time by the title Taoiseach (\\"Tea-shock\\"), meaning chieftain or leader. This term now is used as the title of the Irish Prime Minister. The man who became Taoiseach generally was referred to by his surname only, e.g. O'Dubhda. In this way he came to be referred to as chief of his name. He was elected according to the old Irish laws and sometimes there was dispute over the leadership. One means of avoiding conflict was by the selection of a Taoiseach-elect, called a Tanaiste (\\"Thaw-nishta\\"). This term is now used for the Irish Deputy Prime Minister. The election and inauguration was presided over by the ollamh (\\"Ulav\\") or professor of the Mac Firbis family of scholars. The O'Dubhda is unique in having a detailed account of the inauguration ceremony of their Taoiseach preserved in an ancient manuscript of the aforementioned Mac Firbis scholars. This manuscript, known as the Great Book of Lecan, was written near Enniscrone in Tireragh between A.D. 1397 and 1418, and now is carefully preserved as one of the Irish national treasures in Dublin. One of the most generous sponsors of the Mac Firbis scholars was Tadhg Riabhach O'Dunhda (Dark Teige), who became Taoiseach of Tireragh in A.D.1417. He is particularly remembered in this manuscript in which his death is recorded at Enniscrone Castle. The unique treasure preserves much of ancient Irish heritage. It contains information relating to the history of hundreds of different Irish families. Its existence is a testament to both the Mac Firbis bardic scholars, who wrote it, and the O'Dubhda rulers, who supported them. ==O'Dowda and O'Dowd, Dowd and Doody, etc.== The ancient laws of Ireland, known as the Brehon Laws, continued in use until the early 1600s. The last Taoiseach to be elected under these was Tadhg Buí O'Dubhda (Blonde Teige) who was inaugurated in 1595. He led his army south to the Battle of Kinsale in 1601 and never came back. Tradition states he survived the battle and settled in County Kerry, where his family later became known as Doody. During the 17th Century, the rest of the O'Dubhda ruling family was displaced from their homeland, where they had owned 24 castles and 52 towns, including Enniscrone. They split into two main branches, and these settled in County Mayo. In dealings with government officials using the English language several different spellings of the surname were introduced, one branch using the spelling of O'Dowda, while the other branch became known as O'Dowd. Two centuries earlier a third branch had left and settled near Dublin, where they became known as Dowd. Although there are more than 40 other variations, Dowd and O'Dowd now are the most common versions of the surname. There are many descendants now living who can trace their ancestry directly to the original O'Dubhda kings. == Some prominent modern-day Dowds == Alice Mary Dowd * Alice Mary Dowd (1855–1943), educator, author * Ann Dowd (born 1956), American actress * Anthony Dowd (born 1957), American jazz musician * Bernard J.

He was born and raised in a traditional Jewish household in Zlotshev, Galicia and brought to Vienna at the age of 12 in 1898 to study commercial art. He then began writing modernist poetry in German.Flanzbaum, Hilene, coordinating editor. Jewish American Literature: A Norton Anthology, pp. 245-6 Upon returning to his hometown in 1907, he switched to writing in Yiddish. One of his best-known poems is a satire about his hometown. In order to avoid the military draft, Halpern emigrated to New York City in 1908 where he became associated with a group of Yiddish poets called Di Yunge (The Young Ones). He published his first book of poetry in 1919, In nyu york (In New York), translated to English by Kathryn Hellerstein That same year he married Rayzele Barron. His son, now called Isaac Halpern, was born in 1923. His second book, Di Goldene Pave (The Golden Peacock), was published in 1924. Halpern also wrote for satirical magazines and Frayhayt (Freedom), a communist Yiddish newspaper. After leaving the Frayhayt in 1928, he lived in Los Angeles for two years. He died of a heart attack in New York in 1932. Ruth Wisse writes about him thus: > Halpern was generally less sociable than his literary colleagues and > everyone who met him in the early immigrant years commented on the solitude > which seemed particularly pronounced in him. His fellow poet, Mani Leib, > recalled that “we, his friends, like all other Jewish immigrants, also bore > the fear of this wondrous unknown called America. But somehow we . . . gave > in, adapted ourselves, ‘ripened’ and gradually became . . . real Americans. > Not Moishe Leib. He could never compromise or bend.” Though he contributed > to the group’s many publications and little magazines, he was slightly apart > from the others, the lone wolf, or, as the play on his name suggested, the > brooding Lion, Moishe Leib. Almost alone among his fellow writers he failed > to find steady work in the small factories, manual trades, or editorial > offices where most of the others eventually made their living, and this > economic precariousness, which continued practically without interruption > until his death, contributed to his image as a troubling nonconformist, and > to his artistic distance. Halpern's importance can be measured in the 50 poems and 400 articles written from 1932 to 1954 on him by his contemporaries, some of whom include Jacob Glatstein, Itzik Manger, and Mani Leib. ==References== ==Further reading and Links== *Ruth Wisse, A Little Love in Big Manhattan *Julien Levinson, Biographical Essay *Entry on Moyshe-Leyb Halpern at the Yiddish Leksikon *Video interview with his son from the Yiddish Book Center Category:Yiddish- language poets Category:Jewish poets Category:Modernist poets Category:American male poets Category:American people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent Category:Ukrainian Jews Category:People from Zolochiv Category:1886 births Category:1932 deaths Category:20th-century American poets Category:20th-century American male writers ","title":"Moyshe-Leyb Halpern"},{"id":"2577734","text":"Former South Dock The Maritime Quarter (including Swansea Marina) is a residential area of Swansea, Wales, UK located immediately south of the city centre shopping core. It falls within Swansea's Castle ward. The area is bounded by Brynmill to the west, Swansea Bay to the South, the River Tawe to the east and the A4067 to the north. The area comprises a mixture of housing ranging from 1980s low-rise apartment blocks around the old South Dock to town houses arranged in quadrangles in the south eastern part of the area, which were built in the 2000s (decade). The Marina, is unusual in that planning approval was given on condition that a significant proportion of the development be sold to Housing Associations for social housing. The tallest building in Wales, the Meridian Quay Tower is located in the area. ==History== Formerly the South Dock, during the 1980s it underwent significant brownfield re-development in the early 1980s with the building of many low rise apartment blocks in the area around the South Dock. On the site of the Sainsbury's superstore, once stood the Weaver building. Built in 1897 by the French architect François Hennebique It was used for corn storage and it was the first steel reinforced concrete building built in Europe. Originally the city council decided to fill in the South Dock. This was done by a developer whose brother was a councillor at the local council. Later on, the same company was paid to dig out the South Dock again to create the marina. The developer is now imprisoned in Swansea Prison. The re-excavated South Dock was laid out into the award-winning Maritime Quarter by architect Robin Campbell, then head of Environmental Design at Swansea Council. The brief was to make the area an extension of Swansea City centre, and not a separate suburb, and to work in walk ways through the overall development being created by numerous building companies. Campbell also worked in partnership with the developers to incorporate art designed by local artists into the buildings, and the creation of an observatory. Unfortunately the accessibility of this area was not achieved. Due to the busy thoroughfare of the Fabian Way the Marina area remains very much a separate area to the city centre. ==Marina== River Tawe barrage The South Dock itself now serves as marina, part of the Swansea Marina complex providing berths for privately owned leisure boats. Sailing and sea angling schools are located in the area. In addition to the Quay Parade road bridge just to the north, there are two pedestrian bridges linking this area to the main Swansea docks area - the Sail bridge and the lock bridge. The Sail bridge as its name suggests is designed to look like a sail shape. The lock bridge is a steel structure built over the Tawe barrage. The western section of the lock bridge is a swing bridge over the lock located on the Tawe barrage. The water areas are not fully protected by railings. Local residents have often expressed concerns over the safety of the lack of railings and indeed, over the years, the marina has seen a number of people drowning after having fallen into the waters by accident. ==Amenities== The headquarters of the local South Wales Evening Post newspaper is located here. Beside the Evening Post building is the Associated British Ports building, now used as a five-star hotel. Just west of the marina is a four star Marriott hotel. A waterside walkway to the north-east of the marina is home to a few cafes, pubs and arcades. On the far western end of the Maritime quarter is the Civic Centre which houses government offices of the City and County of Swansea council.

It is located about north-west of Swansea city centre. Cockett, in common with much of western Swansea, was the result of late Victorian and early twentieth century expansion. More housing estates were developed during the 20th century and further housing was constructed near the Townhill district in the early 2000s. The area now has a broad mix of housing stock. 83 per cent of the property in the Cockett neighbourhood is owner occupied. The South Wales Police regional headquarters for Swansea were based in Cockett, as is Dylan Thomas Community School. The South Wales Police regional headquarters are now located closer to the city centre however. There are a few shops in central Cockett, but the nearest shopping districts are on Carmarthen Road (A483) to the north and the Swansea West Business Park to the north-west. The main road through Cockett is the A4216 road linking Sketty to the south with Fforestfach to the north. Cockett railway station is a currently disused railway station to the north, by Station Road. The old platforms on the West Wales Lines are still in place and there are proposals by South West Wales Integrated Transport Consortium to reinstate this station in the future, which would provide a 10-minute journey to Swansea railway station in the city centre.

The town is located in the district of Heidenheim at the eastern edge of the Swabian Alb, about 30 kilometers northeast of Ulm on the Brenz River. Giengen is the hometown of the Margarete Steiff corporation, who invented the teddy bear. Positioned on the Nuremberg-Ulm-Constance route, one of the main feeder routes of the Compostella Trail, Giengen is visited each year by an increasing number of walking pilgrims on their way to Santiago de Compostella. ==History== The first documentary evidence of the town was contained in a chronicle of the monastery of Peterhausen that reported on the death in battle in 1078 of margrave Diepold II von Vohburg, lord of Giengen. In 1147, Adele, daughter of Diepold III, was married to Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa but was divorced after a few years due to childlessness. Frederick Barbarossa was an occasional visitor and resident and it was probably during his stay in 1171 that he granted market rights and the unicorn coat of arms to the town. Still referred to as a villa (village) in a document dated 1216, Giengen had seemingly attained city (civitas) status by 1252. ===Free Imperial City (1395–1803)=== The city was pawned more than once by successive emperors, and the counts of Württemberg and of Oettingen both vied for control over the city. It was only in 1395 that Giengen’s status as a Free Imperial City, independent of any lord but the Emperor, was finally acknowledged by all. In 1481, the city was exempted from the jurisdiction of any outside court. Giengen, which has been a member of leagues of Swabian Free cities since the late 14th Century, joined the powerful Swabian League when it was set up in 1488. The city took part in the League’s successful war against Württemberg in 1519. According to the celebrated Reichsmatrikel of 1521 - the document that laid down the military and monetary obligations for each of the Imperial Estates – Giengen was obligated to contribute 2 horsemen, 13 foot soldiers and 60 gulden. That contribution ranked near the bottom on the list of the 85 Free Imperial Cities then in existence, reflecting the small size and modest resources of the city (by comparison, the contribution of nearby Ulm was set at 29, 120 and 600 respectively). Yet, Giengen was to be one of the 50 Free Imperial Cities that were to survive the Thirty Years' War and the Peace of Westphalia and continue as quasi-sovereign entities until 1802-03. ====Protestant Reformation==== The Marktplatz The Brenz River at Giengen, circa 1910 Like almost all the other Imperial Cities, Giengen was profoundly transformed by the Protestant Reformation, which made its way into the city- states before it did into the secular and ecclesiastical principalities of the Empire. Even before the advent of the Reformation, there had been much discontent against the pervasive influence of the Church, particularly in the Free Imperial Cities that, while largely independent politically, had to contend with the control of the Church in religious matters such as tithes, ecclesiastical tribunals, etc., not counting the fact that religious property and the clergy, both secular and regular, were largely exempted from taxation and civic control. Therefore, a final break with Rome and the local bishop—in the case of Giengen, the Bishop of Augsburg—meant the end of a severe irritant and a significant increase in the political reach of the new Protestant cities and princes who, from then on, would have full control over the reformed clergy, tithes and religious regulations and foundations. One Kaspar Pfeiffelmann was the first Protestant preacher to preach in Giengen, more specifically at the hospital church in 1528. In 1531, after having been repeatedly requested by local burghers to hire a permanent Evangelical (Lutheran) preacher, the Town Council finally hired preacher and reformer Martin Rauber. The City officially adopted the new Lutheran doctrine in 1537. Later that year, the famous reformer and theologian Martin Bucer from Strasburg visited Giengen. Catholic services were prohibited in 1556 and soon after, following the general trend already well underway in the other Free Cities, Giengen abandoned its conversion policy that relied on quiet persuasion and decreed that all Nonconformists such as the Anabaptists – deemed too radical and a threat to social order and religious peace – had to leave the city if they refused to convert to Lutheranism. The city suffered heavily during the Thirty Years' War and was looted and ransomed repeatedly by Swedish, Imperial/Spanish and French troops and in 1634 a devastating fire destroyed much of the city. The last soldiers billeted in the city left in August 1650, more than a year after the signing of the Peace of Westphalia. Life very slowly went back to normal and money was found to rebuild the schools and churches. The visiting Duke of Württemberg was wined and dined during a visit in 1655: the tiny independent city-state was entirely surrounded by Württemberg territory and good relations with the dukes were important. The population of Giengen, which has stood at close to 2000 on the eve of the War in 1618, was back to 1200 in 1651 and to 1700 in 1671. From the year of the fire to 1672, some 206 individuals - 95 from the area, 20 from Ulm, 29 from Bavaria and 62 from the rest of the Empire - have purchased Giengen's citizenship (Bürgerrecht). A new tax code adopted by the Town Council in 1677 caused considerable popular discontent and following a complaint to the Aulic Council, an imperial commission composed of the count of Oëttingen and members of the Town Council of Ulm, Giengen's powerful neighbor to the south, ruled that the guilds should be involved in the decision process on taxation. The rule was to remain in force until Giengen ceased to be a Free Imperial City in 1802. ====Eighteenth century==== Giengen on an 18th century map The 18th century was somewhat uneventful for Giengen and the city was relatively spared by the War of the Spanish Succession and the other wars of the century. Not much happened in the sleepy city: the belfry of St. Georg’s church’s was rebuilt after a fire and a new baptismal font was donated by a prominent citizen; an organ-making shop opened business; one Jakob Osswald and his daughter are beheaded for “incestua cum filia”. A 1734 survey showed that there were \\"130 horses, 150 heads of cattle, many pigs and 1,000 sheep\\" in the tiny Free Imperial City, which had a distinct rural character. In 1732, the city, imitating other Protestant states, took in 12 Protestant families that, along with hundreds of others, had been expulsed from Salzburg by the Prince-Archbishop. Emperor Charles VII stayed briefly at the Bürgermeister’s house in 1743, and on his way back from Italy in June 1788, Goethe stayed for two nights at the Goldenen Gans Inn, where he spent 2 gulden in victuals. The population then was about 1770, almost unchanged from a century earlier. ====End of free imperial city status==== Giengen circa 1910 In the course of the mediatisation of 1802-03, Giengen was not spared the fate of the great majority of the 50 Free Imperial Cities of the moribund Holy Roman Empire and the city lost its independence. On September 5, 1802, Duke Frederick II of Württemberg wrote to “the Mayor and Town Council of the Imperial City of Giengen” that “they should convince themselves of the necessity for Giengen” to be incorporated into his duchy. The following month, the Duke ordered his bailiff in Heidenheim to enter Giengen and take possession. At that time, the city - one of the 15 Free Imperial Cities to be absorbed into Württemberg between 1802 and 1810 - was home to 464 families, had 1,695 inhabitants, 354 houses, 119 barns, and a budget surplus of 6,000 gulden.This article incorporates information from the German-language site http://www.giengen-brenz.de/ Giengen-an-der-Brenz--Marktstraße.jpgGiengen-an- der-Brenz Giengen-stadtmauer.jpgGiengen-Town wall Giengen a d Br - Rathaus v S.JPGGiengen Town hall Geburtshaus der Margarete Steiff (Lederstraße 26).jpgBirthplace Margarete Steiff Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F008314-0004, Giengen, Firma Steiff.jpgTeddy bear production at Margarete Steiff GmbH, Giengen, 1960 ==Mayors== * 1819–1826: Johannes Oswald * 1826–1848: Martin * 1848–1851: Lorenz David Wencher * 1851–1860: Anton Fink * 1860–1891: Lorenz David Wencher * 1891-1929: Julius Brezger * 1929–1945: Christian Ehrlinger * 1945–1948: Adolf Kolb * 1948–1977: Walter Schmid * 1977–2001: Siegfried Rieg * 2001–2009: Clemens Stahl * since October 2009: Gerrit Elser ==Freemen== The municipality of Giengen awarded the freemanship to the following people:Chronicle of the city Giengen by the city's history working group , 2002 * 1875 Johann Vötsch, teacher (1824 East Village - 1897 Ulm) * 1894 Josef Stocker, forester (1822 Bühlertann - 1895 Giengen) * 1902 Christian Baumann, senior teacher (1830 - 1913, born and died in Giengen) * 1906 Karl Rau, architect of town (1830 - 1913, born and died in Giengen) * 1908 Hans Haehnle, Commerce, member of the Reichstag (1839 Giengen - 1909 Winnental) * 1909 August Dieterlen, professor (1847 Gönningen - 1923 Stuttgart) * 1920 Georg Käumle, Rector (1853 Gärtringen - 1936 Stuttgart) * 1921 Dr. Paul Wörnle, forest official (1869 - 1937, born and died in Stuttgart) * 1929 Julius Brezger, mayor (1861 Giengen - 1930 Göppingen) * 1930 Lina Hähnle, founder and chairman of Bund für Vogelschutz, later transformed in Nature Conservation Union (1851 Sulz am Neckar - 1941 Giengen) * 1977 Walter Schmid, mayor (1910 - 1994 Giengen) * 1988 Hans Otto Steiff, producer (1919 - 1994, born and died in Giengen) * 2001 Siegfried Rieg, mayor (1977-2001). ==Sons and daughters of the town== Margarete Steiff * Jacob Heerbrand (1521-1600), professor of theology, chancellor and prophet in Tübingen * Margarete Steiff (1847-1909), founder of the toy factory Steiff * Max von Zabern (1903-1991 Mannheim), district administrator and banker * Karl Gerold (1906-1973), journalist, editor of the Frankfurter Rundschau * Erich Ehrlinger (1910-2004), mass murderer, SS Brigade Commander and Commander of Security Police Russia Center. * Ursula Späth (born 1937), patron of the National Association \\"Action Multiple Sclerosis ill patients\\" (BLACKBIRD), widow of Lothar Späth * Jörg Knoblauch (born 1949), entrepreneur and author * Jochen Klein (1967-1997), painter * Frank Zeller (born 1969), chess player, coach and author * Andreas Stoch (born 1969), lawyer and politician (SPD), minister of education in Baden-Württemberg 2013-2016 * Franz Garlik, musician and actor ==References== Category:Heidenheim (district) Category:Free imperial cities Category:Swabian Circle Category:Swabian League Category:Former states and territories of Baden-Württemberg ","title":"Giengen"},{"id":"2577835","text":"Warfare systems are tactical systems and tactical mission-support systems, such as weapons, sensors, command and control, navigation, aviation support systems, mission planning, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, interior and exterior communications, topside design, and warfare system networks.

Retrieved on 2019-07-21. ==History== Brown bears were present in Britain until no later than AD 1000, when they had been exterminated through over-hunting. Eurasian brown bears were used in Ancient Rome for fighting in arenas. The strongest bears apparently came from Caledonia and Dalmatia. In antiquity, the Eurasian brown bear was largely carnivorous, with 80% of its diet consisting of animal matter. However, as its habitat increasingly diminished, the portion of meat in its diet decreased with it until by the late Middle Ages, meat consisted of only 40% of its dietary intake. Today, meat makes up little more than 10–15% of its diet. Whenever possible, the brown bear will consume sheep. Unlike in North America, where an average of two people a year are killed by bears, Scandinavia only has records of three fatal bear attacks within the last century. However, in late 2019, brown bears killed three men in Romania in just over a month. == Species origin == Eurasian brown bear resting The oldest fossils are from the Choukoutien, China, and date back about 500,000 years. It is known from mtDNA studies that during the Pleistocene ice age it was too cold for the brown bear to survive in Europe except in three places: Russia, Spain, and the Balkans. Modern researchDet Skandinaviske Bjørneprosjektet has made it possible to track the origin of the subspecies. The species to which it belongs developed more than 500,000 years ago, and researchers have found that the Eurasian brown bear separated about 850,000 years ago, with one branch based in Western Europe and the other branch in Western Europe, Russia, Eastern Europe and Asia. Through research of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), researchers have found that the European family has divided into two clades—one in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balkans, the other in Russia. There is a population in Scandinavia that includes bears of the western and eastern lineages. By analyzing the mtDNA of the southern population, researchers have found that they have probably come from populations in the Pyrenees in Southern France and Spain and the Cantabrian Mountains (Spain). Bears from these populations spread to southern Scandinavia after the last ice age. The northern bear populations originate in the Finnish/Russian population. Probably their ancestors survived the ice age in the ice-free areas west of the Ural Mountains, and thereafter spread to Northern Europe. == Distribution == Brown bears could once be found across most of Eurasia, compared to the more limited range today. Although included as of Least Concern on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (which refers to the global species, not to the Eurasian brown bear specifically), local populations are becoming increasingly scarce. And as the IUCN itself adds: > \\"Least Concern does not always mean that species are not at risk. There are > declining species that are evaluated as Least Concern.\\" The brown bear has long been extinct in Ireland and Britain, but still exists in Northern Europe and in Russia. There is a small but growing population (at least 43 bearsEl futuro del oso en el Pirineo occidental Fundacion Oso Pardo (Spanish)) in the Pyrenees, on the border between Spain and France, which was once on the edge of extinction, as well as two subpopulations in the Cantabrian Mountains in Spain (amounting to around 250 individualsCuantos osos hay y donde viven Fundacion Oso Pardo (Spanish)).

Other clades of brown bear persist in small, isolated and for the most part highly threatened populations in Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, parts of northwest India and central China, and on the island of Hokkaidō in Japan. == Cultural depictions == The historic distribution of bears and the impression the bear has made on people are reflected in the names of a number of localities (some notable examples include Berlin, Bern, Medvednica, Otepää and Ayu-Dag), as well as personal names—for example, Xiong (熊), Bernard, Arthur, Ursula, Urs, Ursicinus, Orsolya, Björn, Nedved, Medvedev and Otso. Bears of this subspecies appear very frequently in the fairy tales and fables of Europe, in particular tales collected by Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm. The European brown bear was once common in Germany and alpine lands like Northern Italy, Eastern France, and most of Switzerland, and thus appears in tales of various dialects of German. The bear is traditionally regarded as the symbol of Russian (military and political) might. It is also Finland's national animal; and in Croatia, a brown bear is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 5 kuna coin, minted since 1993.Croatian National Bank.

It was a Free Imperial City of the Holy Roman Empire for nearly 600 years. The town is in the district of Sigmaringen south of the Danube valley and therefore on the continental divide between the watersheds of the Rhine and the Danube. The area is known as the Linzgau. ==History== The Hauptstraße The 700-year-old house ===Early history=== Pfullendorf was founded by the Alamanni tribe during their third wave of settlement and might have been named after a clan chief named Pfullo. According to another theory, it was named Dorf am Phoul (Pfuol), meaning village on the Phoul. The area around Lake Constance, particularly the Linzgau, Hegau and Vorarlberg, came progressively under the rule of the counts of Pfullendorf from the 8th century onward. The earliest documented bearer of that name was Count Ludwig von Pfullendorf, who is referred to as the ruler of the county of Hegau from 1067 to 1116. Presumably, Pfullendorf expanded due to its proximity to the counts' castle. Count Rudolf, a partisan of the future Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, was able to expand his family's possessions and they eventually owned fiefs from the Danube to the Grisons. Following the death of his son Berthold in 1167, Count Rudolf named the Emperor as his heir and then moved to the Holy Land where he died in 1181. ===Free Imperial City=== Territory of Pfullendorf in the mid-18th century In June 1220, Emperor Frederick II elevated Pfullendorf to the status of Imperial City. However, the prince-bishops of Constance, as the biggest landowners in the Linzgau and patrons of several religious institutions such as Holy Spirit Hospital in Pfullendorf, continued to exert significant political influence over the whole area. At the Council of Constance (1415), King Sigismund granted Blutgerichtsbarkeit (\\"Blood justice\\" or the right to pronounce sentences of death or mutilation) to the town, a status that confirmed the city as being answerable to God and to the Emperor only. Starting in 1383, Pfullendorf ruled itself according to a constitution that gave decisive powers to the town guilds and provided for the annual election of the mayor. A 50-member “High Council” also elected annually, was vested with executive authority alongside a 17-member “Small Council” chaired by the mayor. With brief interruptions, this guild-based constitution remained in force until 1803 and was to serve as a model for other cities. Pfullendorf became a member of the powerful Swabian League in 1488 and took part in the war of 1492 against Duke Albrecht of Bavaria. The city was assigned to contribute 4 footmen, 6 horsemen, 4 wagons and 8 tents for the campaign. Like a few other small Free Imperial Cities in the vicinity of Lake Constance, Pfullendorf was comparatively untouched by the turmoil that engulfed Germany during the Protestant Reformation and it was to be one of the 12 Free Imperial Cities, out of 50, that was to be officially classified as Catholic at the Peace of Westphalia, that also explicitly stated for the first time that Free Imperial Cities enjoyed the same degree of independence (Imperial immediacy) as the other Imperial Estates. Although the Black Death, the Peasants' War, the Reformation, the Thirty Years' War, the War of the Spanish Succession and the French Revolution left their marks on the region, Pfullendorf was able to avoid major destruction. During the Thirty Years's war, the city was fought over for five hours in 1632 and the pilgrimage church of Maria Schray, along with its Gothic choir, was burned down. ===End of the Free Imperial City of Pfullendorf=== Old Pfullendorf in 1900 The Town Hall circa 1905 Like most of the other 50 Free Imperial Cities, Pfullendorf lost its freedom in the course of the mediatisation of 1803 and was annexed to the Margraviate of Baden. The old hospital building in the center of town was sold and in 1845 (it now houses the restaurant Deutscher Kaiser) and a new hospital opened on the site of a former monastery near the Upper Gate. The city was connected to the railway network in 1873-75. Pfullendorf remained an administrative center in the upper Linzgau until 1936. It then became part of the district of Überlingen, and has been a part of the district of Sigmaringen since 1973. During the administrative reforms that occurred from 1972 to 1976, the neighboring villages of Aach-Linz, Denkingen, Gaisweiler, Tautenbronn, Großstadelhofen, Mottschieß, Otterswang, and Zell- Schwäblishausen became part of Pfullendorf. ==Culture== The German Army's Special Operations Training Centre () is located in Pfullendorf, as was the NATO International Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol School following its move from Weingarten to its closure in 1999. In 2001 the United States Army took command of the I-LRRP School in Pfullendorf and the name was changed to the International Special Training Centre (ISTC). ISTC is the International Wing (I-Wing) of the German Ausbildungszentrum Special Operations. ===Twin towns=== * Allschwil in Switzerland since April 13, 1984 * Saint-Jean-de-Braye in France since May 1, 1987 ==Notable Pfullendorfers== * Daniel Schuhmacher, DSDS winner for Season 6. * Sinan Gümüş, Galatasaray, professional football player. * Huw Morris, Project Manager, Kitchens ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Sigmaringen (district) Category:Free imperial cities Category:Baden ","title":"Pfullendorf"},{"id":"2577888","text":"The Outlaw Kid is a fictional Western hero in comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character originally appeared in the company's 1950s iteration, Atlas Comics. A lesser-known character than the company's Kid Colt, Rawhide Kid or Two-Gun Kid, he also starred in a reprint series in the 1970s and a short-lived revival. The Outlaw Kid was Lance Temple, an Old West lawyer and Civil War veteran living with his blinded father on a ranch. Though promising his father he would never take up a gun, he'd nonetheless felt the need to right wrongs expediently on the near-lawless frontier, and created a masked identity in order to keep his gunslinging secret. ==Publication history== Comic-book artist Doug Wildey, later a noted animation designer, illustrated three to four stories per issue of the 19-issue series The Outlaw Kid (cover dated Sept. 1954-Sept. 1957). Joe Maneely provided most of the covers. Backup features were usually \\"The Black Rider,\\" drawn by Syd Shores, or an anthological Western tale. An additional Outlaw Kid story appeared in Wild Western #43 (May 1955). Well over a year after the original series ended, two other Outlaw Kid stories by Wildey, presumably from inventory, saw print, in Kid Colt, Outlaw #82 (Jan. 1959) and Wyatt Earp #24 (Aug. 1959). Comics historian Ken Quattro called the series Wildey's most \\"noteworthy\\" Western work: When Marvel began reprinting the series in The Outlaw Kid vol. 2, #1–30 (Aug. 1970 – Oct. 1975), it became the best-selling among the company's Western reprints.Evanier, Mark. \\"Don Segall, Frank Ridgeway, & Doug Wildey,\\" POV Online (November 18, 1994). Gil Kane, John Severin and Herb Trimpe, among others, provided new cover art. When the 1950s Wildey material ran out, Marvel commissioned new stories, by writer Mike Friedrich, followed by the unrelated Gary Friedrich, with art by Marvel Western veteran Dick Ayers. Yet with these new stories, in issues #10–16 (Oct. 1972 – June 1973), sales dropped, after which the title began re-reprinting Wildey's work. Wildey reprints also appeared in the 1970s Marvel series Mighty Marvel Western (#9) and Western Gunfighters. The Outlaw Kid reappeared in the four-issue limited series Blaze of Glory: The Last Ride of the Western Heroes (2000), by writer John Ostrander and artist Leonardo Manco, which specifically retconned that the naively clean-cut Marvel Western stories of years past were merely dime novel fictions of the characters' actual lives. It was revealed here that Temple's father, who did not want him gunslinging, had died from the shock of learning of his son's alter ego, and that a guilt-wracked Temple, blaming himself for his father's death, developed a split personality and was unaware he was the Outlaw Kid. Indeed, he was actually searching for the Outlaw Kid in the miniseries. He dies in the last issue, helping defend the town of Wonderment. His last act was to use dynamite to kill some opponents, noting his father would have been happy he did not use a gun. As series writer John Ostrander explained, ==Legacy== The mutant Outlaw of Agency X is a descendant of the Outlaw Kid. ==List of Doug Wildey's Outlaw Kid stories== This list is incomplete. * The Outlaw Kid #1 (Sept. 1954) :: \\"The Beginning!\\" :: \\"Jaws of Death!\\" :: \\"A Killer's Trap!\\" * The Outlaw Kid #2 (Nov. 1954) :: \\"The Fast Gun!\\" a.k.a. \\"The Fast Draw\\" (rep.

She was one of America's best selling authors during her writing career and had three silent films adapted from her novels. Johnston was also an active member of the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia, using her writing skills and notability to draw attention to the cause of women's suffrage in Virginia. ==Early life== Mary Johnston was born in the small town of Buchanan, Virginia, the eldest child of John William Johnston, an American Civil War veteran, and Elizabeth Dixon Alexander Johnston. Due to frequent illness, she was educated at home by family and tutors.Brooks, Clayton McClure, Samuel P. Menefee and Brendan Wolfe. Encyclopedia Virginia. She grew up with a love of books and was financially independent enough to devote herself to writing. When Johnston was 16, her father's work with the Georgia Pacific Railroad caused the family to move to Birmingham, Alabama. Shortly after the move, Johnston began attending the Atlanta Female Institute and College of Music in Atlanta, Georgia. She attended the school for three months; this was the only formal education Johnston would receive. After her mother's death in 1889, Johnston acted as her father's companion and as a surrogate mother for her five younger siblings. Johnston's family moved to New York 1892. They returned to Birmingham in 1896, and then moved to Richmond, Virginia in 1902. ==Career== 1902 advertisement for Audrey Johnston wrote historical books and novels that often combined romance with history. Her first book, Prisoners of Hope (1898), dealt with colonial times in Virginia as did her second novel, To Have and to Hold (1900), and later, Sir Mortimer (1904). The Goddess of Reason (1907) uses the theme of the French Revolution, and in Lewis Rand (1908) the author portrayed political life at the dawn of the 19th century. To Have and to Hold was serialized in The Atlantic Monthly in 1899 and published in book form 1900, by Houghton Mifflin. The book proved enormously popular and was the bestselling novel in the United States in 1900. Johnston's next work, titled Audrey, was the fifth bestselling book in the U.S. in 1902, and Sir Mortimer, serialized in Harper's Monthly magazine from November 1903 through April 1904, was published in 1904. Her best-selling 1911 novel on the American Civil War, The Long Roll, brought Johnston into open conflict with Stonewall Jackson's widow, Mary Anna Jackson. Beyond her native America, Johnston's novels were also very popular in Canada and in England. During her long career Johnston wrote, in addition to 23 novels, numerous short stories, two long narrative poems, and one play. Her book titled Hagar (1913), considered to be one of the first feminist novels as well as somewhat autobiographical, captures the early days of women's rights. Johnston's deep focus on female suffrage in the United States is documented by her letters and correspondence with women working for the right to vote. But Hagar created a controversy among men and tradition- minded women, who were upset by the book's progressive ideas. Many refused to purchase it and subsequent Johnston novels. During her life, Johnston was close friends with Gone with the Wind author Margaret Mitchell, who once commented: \\"I hesitate to write about the South after having read Mary Johnston.\\" ===Film adaptations=== Three of Johnston's books were adapted to film. Audrey was made into a 1916 silent film of the same name, and her blockbuster work To Have and to Hold was made into silent films both in 1916 and in 1922. Pioneers of the Old South was adapted as the film ' (1923). == Women's suffrage advocacy == alt= Johnston was an early an active member of the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia (ESL), which was founded in November 1909 by other Richmond-area activists like Lila Meade Valentine, Ellen Glasgow, and Kate Waller Barrett. She chaired the ESL's legislative and lecture committees and served as vice president from 1911 to 1914. On December 12, 1909, the Richmond Times-Dispatch published a pro-suffragist article written by Johnston entitled “The Status of Women.” The ESL would go on to reprint this article, along with another entitled \\"These Things Can Be Done\\" in Virginia Suffrage News, a monthly paper created to increase communication among the suffrage leagues across the state of Virginia. Johnston's writings in support of women's suffrage also appeared in national publications, including the Atlantic Monthly and Woman's Journal and Suffrage News. In 1910, Johnston took elocution lessons to improve her public speaking skills. She would go on to deliver several speeches in support of women's suffrage. In January 1912, she addressed Virginia's General Assembly. In December of that year, she spoke at the governors' conference at its annual meeting in Richmond. She also spoke at the closing event of the woman suffrage parade of 1913 in Washington, D.C. ==Death and legacy== Three Hills, Johnston's home in Warm Springs, Virginia, 1915 Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, Virginia, U.S.alt= In 1936, Johnston died of Bright's disease at her home in Warm Springs, Virginia. She was 65 years old. Johnston was interred in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. Three Hills, her house at Warm Springs, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. Her Richmond home on Linden Row was listed in 1971. Johnston was honored by the Library of Virginia as part of its 2005 class of Virginia Women in History.

An avid reader of science fiction and fantasy, he began writing himself at the age of fourteen in 80-page spiral-bound notebooks, and began to collect the usual quantity of rejection slips. Around his eighteenth birthday, he received a rejection slip from editor Ben Bova, but one with a signature and a handwritten note thanking him for the submission. Heartened, Denning continued to write as he attended Beloit College, where he also played on their Division III football team.\\"Guests: Troy Denning\\" Odyssey Con 14 website ==Career== Denning joined TSR as a game designer in 1981, and was promoted a year later to Manager of Designers, before he moved to the book department. Denning then worked for two years managing the Pacesetter game company. Denning designed the adventure board game Chill: Black Morn Manor (1985) for Pacesetter. When Mayfair Games picked up ownership of the horror game Chill from Pacesetter, Denning also moved to Mayfair at that time; Denning worked with Mayfair staffers David Ladyman, Jeff Leason and Louis Prosperi, to create a second edition of Chill (1990). After his stint at Mayfair Games, Denning went freelance. Denning wrote the third novel in TSRs \\"Avatar Trilogy\\", Waterdeep (1989), which he wrote under the house pseudonym Richard Awlinson; the book became a New York Times bestselling novel.Troy Denning. Alliterates.com. Accessed March 24, 2012. He wrote the novel with Scott Ciencin, and the choice of the surname Awlinson was an inside joke which sounds like \\"all in one\\". In October 1989 he rejoined TSR as a senior designer, co-creating the Dark Sun setting with Tim Brown and Mary Kirchoff. Denning and Brown led the project, alongside fiction editor Kirchoff, and they were soon joined by artist Brom, who contributed the unique illustrations that helped set Dark Sun apart from the other TSR settings, making Dark Sun the first of TSR's world designs with a more artistic sensibility. According to Denning, the three designers envisioned \\"a world for experienced DMs that would push the AD&D; game to its limits and let people do things like play half-giants and thri-kreen and superstrong characters—in short, all the really neat stuff we wanted to do ourselves, but that everybody kept saying would ruin game balance.\\" Denning felt in 1998 that Dark Sun \\"did what we wanted it to, and it has attracted a devoted following. When I go to conventions, it's still what people want to talk about. Talking Brom into being the lead artist early was very fortunate for us; he would sketch weird creatures and settings and equipment, and we'd work them into the game.\\" Brown and Denning also put together the 1991 D&D; \\"black box\\" set, which became a top-seller for TSR, selling half a million copies in the next six years. Denning returned to freelance writing again in 1991, writing the bestselling \\"Prism Pentad\\" for the Dark Sun setting (1991–93), and the Forgotten Realms \\"Twilight Giants\\" trilogy (1994–95). Denning also wrote the Planescape hardcover Pages of Pain (1996): \\"It had to be from the Lady of Pain’s viewpoint—which is something of a problem, since (as every Planescape player knows) she never speaks—and (this was the really good part) the reader must know less about her at the end of the book than he does at the beginning, and nobody knows anything about her at the beginning.\\" Denning recalled that Pages of Pain \\"really made me rethink the way I approach stories, and for that reason alone it was worth writing. It also ended up being a much deeper book than I had ever written before, which I think was a result of the extreme approach I was forced to take. Those who have [read it] seem to think it's my best work. It was certainly the most challenging and—forgive the pun—'painful' to write.\\" Denning continued the story told in Waterdeep's sequel, Prince of Lies (1993) by James Lowder, with the novel Crucible: The Trial of Cyric the Mad. Denning then authored another Forgotten Realms novel called Faces of Deception. Denning's other notable works are Dragonwall and The Parched Sea. Denning wrote the novel The Sentinel for The Sundering, a fictional event set in the expanded D&D; universe. He is also the author of a number of Star Wars expanded universe novels. Including Invincible, the ninth and final book in the Legacy of the Force series, was released in May 2008. He also authored the third and sixth books in the series. He has also been the author for three books in the Fate of the Jedi series. And the 9th book in The New Jedi Order: Star by Star and the Dark Nest Trilogy. Troy was one of the founders of Pacesetter Ltd, a game company formed by a group of former TSR, Inc. executives. ==Personal life== Denning lives in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin with his wife Andria.Author Spotlight at Random House He enjoys many hobbies, including skiing, hiking, mountain-climbing, and Kyuki-do -- a form of tae-kwan-do incorporating judo, boxing, and hapki-do. ==Works== ===Dark Sun=== (listed in order of publication) *The Verdant Passage (October 1991) *The Crimson Legion (April 1992) *The Amber Enchantress (October 1992) *The Obsidian Oracle (June 1993) *The Cerulean Storm (September 1993) ===Forgotten Realms=== (listed in order of publication) *Waterdeep (as Richard Awlinson, October 1989) *Dragonwall (July 1990) *The Parched Sea (July 1991) *The Ogre's Pact (September 1994) *The Giant Among Us (February 1995) *The Titan of Twilight (September 1995) *The Veiled Dragon (June 1996) *Crucible: The Trial of Cyric the Mad (February 1998) *Faces of Deception (November 1998) *Beyond the High Road (December 1999) *Death of the Dragon (written with Ed Greenwood, August 2000) *The Summoning (March 2001) *The Siege (December 2001) *The Sorcerer (November 2002) *The Sentinel (April, 2014) ===Halo=== *Halo: Last Light (September 2015) *Halo: Retribution (August 2017) *Halo: Silent Storm (September 2018) *Halo: Oblivion (September 2019) ===Planescape=== *Pages of Pain (December 1997) ===Stonekeep=== *The Oath of Stonekeep (October 1999) ===Star Wars=== (listed in order of publication) *Star By Star (October 2001) *A Forest Apart (February 2003) *Tatooine Ghost (March 2003) *The Joiner King (July 2005) *The Unseen Queen (September 2005) *The Swarm War (December 2005) *Tempest (November 2006) *Inferno (August 2007) *Invincible (May 2008) *Abyss (August 2009) *Vortex (November 2010) *Apocalypse (March 2012) *Crucible (July 2013) ==References== ==External links== * *Bibliography at Fantastic Fiction *SciFan Page for Troy Denning *Troy Denning at Boardgamegeek * Category:1958 births Category:20th-century American male writers Category:20th-century American novelists Category:21st-century American male writers Category:21st- century American novelists Category:American fantasy writers Category:American male novelists Category:American science fiction writers Category:Beloit Buccaneers football players Category:Beloit College alumni Category:Dungeons & Dragons game designers Category:Living people Category:People from Idaho Springs, Colorado Category:People from Lake Geneva, Wisconsin Category:Role- playing game designers ","title":"Troy Denning"},{"id":"2577977","text":"The Intel Performance Acceleration Technology (PAT) is technology built onto Intel i875 Canterwood mainboards and other Pentium 4 based motherboards that based on the Intel D875PBZ reference board.

The Phoenix models are distinguished by round headlights and fins to the rear.https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2012/09/tychos-illustrated-history-of- chinese-cars-shanghai-sh760/ The front end resembled the American 1955-1956 Packard Patrician and Packard Clipper models. A second Phoenix prototype was produced in January 1959, now with quad headlights. The car was powered by a 150 horsepower V8 for a top speed of , but other sources mentioned that the engine was the new Nanjing CN070, a 3.5 liter inline-six that produced around 70 horsepower. The styling was similar to the 1958 Plymouth. The third prototype, named the Jiaotong, was produced in November 1959 and returned to dual headlights. The grille design featured two dragons incorporated into it, as well as new hood ornaments. This prototype was probably powered by a V8 engine. The final Phoenix prototype was now based on the Mercedes-Benz 220 (W180) instead of the FSO Warszawa, otherwise the styling was similar to the first prototype. In the summer of 1959, the production version of the Phoenix was released. Very few Phoenix models were produced. In December 1964, a modified Phoenix changed its name to Shanghai SH760, and was in full production. A mere fifty cars were built in 1964, but by the mid-seventies factory capacity stood at 5,000 per annum. The SH760 was powered by the Jinfeng (Golden Phoenix) 680Q, a 2.2 litre straight-six engine developing and coupled with a four-speed manual gearbox. As with the basis of the bodywork, this was a copy of 1950s Mercedes-Benz mechanicals, although the engine was OHV instead of OHC. Construction was by hand, with old-fashioned methods and on a small scale. A 1985 visitor described the process as chaotic, with many body parts rusting before they were even painted - but since the metal was so thick, this was not an issue, as they would still easily outlast the engine and transmission. ==Variants== ===SH760A=== In 1974, the SH760A was released. This was a complete redesign of the SH760 with more modern front and rear end design replacing the 1950s styling of the SH760, although the center section was still 1950s Mercedes-Benz. The powertrain was carried over from the SH760. Air conditioning was developed and approved in 1983, but was not available until 1988 with the SH760B. Production continued until around 1989 with some 49,000 units produced. ===SH760B=== Development on a SH760A replacement, the SH760B, was complete by 1980, but the car and its new engine were not available until 1988, after passing evaluation tests in 1987. The SH760B was powered by the Jinfeng 682Q, a new enlarged 2.3 liter version of the 680Q producing 100 horsepower. Two versions were available; one was basically the SH760A but with a black plastic grille while the other featured trim, bumpers, taillights (somewhat modified), steering wheel, mirrors, wheels, and some interior trim pieces straight from the Volkswagen Santana, even though this was in direct contradiction to Shanghai's contract with Volkswagen.Posth, p. 36 The SH760B was produced until 1989 alongside the SH760A. ===SH7221/SH7231=== In 1989, China's automotive designation system changed and the SH760A and SH760B were redesignated as SH7221 and SH7231, respectively, but otherwise remained identical to the previous models. Production ended on 25 November 1991, after a total production run of 79,526 cars. Production peaked in 1984 at around 6,000 units. The SH760 was used as a basis for a four-door convertible, a three-door pickup truck from 1991 to 1994, and a five-door station wagon. Few of these mostly handmade derivatives were produced. ===Proposed replacements=== A replacement for the SH760 was proposed as early as 1966 with the SH763, followed by the SH762 in 1967. Both models used the same engine as the SH760. In 1974 the SH771 was developed as another possible replacement for the SH760. The SH771 was based on a 1970s Mercedes- Benz S-Class (W116) with different front and rear end styling, although the rear end resembled the W116. Unlike the SH760, the SH771 used the 5.6 liter V8 from the Hongqi Red Flag CA770. Never produced, only 30 SH771s were built, and were used for testing until 1978. A third potential SH760 replacement, the SH761S, was developed in the 1980s as a convertible parade car. ==References== ;Works cited * ;Citations Category:Cars of China Category:SAIC Motor vehicles Category:Executive cars Category:Cars introduced in 1964 ","title":"Shanghai SH760"},{"id":"2577994","text":"is a Japanese pop rock singer from Shiogama, Miyagi. She is best known through her songs Bokutachi no Yukue and Aozora no Namida, which were theme songs to animation programs Gundam Seed Destiny and Blood+, respectively. With the former, she became the third artist in to top the Oricon charts with a debut single. ==Biography== ===Pre-Debut=== Hitomi Takahashi was born on April 8, 1989 in the Miyagi Prefecture of Japan. By the influence of her father, she grew up listening to his favorite music, which was classic rock such as Eric Clapton and the Beatles. In 2002, she entered junior-high/middle school. Upon entrance, Hitomi joined the school softball team and joined kendo, where she obtained the level of sho-dan. It was during these years that she expressed an interest in becoming an artist's backup dancer, and began dancing with her friends. During a karaoke singing event in 2003, Hitomi's friends encouraged her to sing live. Though she expressed a disliking for singing karaoke in front of a large crowd, she eventually sang because of her friend's encouragement, and from that time on the desire to become a singer awoke in her. During her second year in junior-high school, in the middle of the summer of 2003, Hitomi applied for the Sony Music Auditions. Because of a change in interest, Hitomi moved from singing dance music to singing rock music. In 2004, Hitomi was selected as the finalist for the Sony Music SD audition (Vo- che3); 20,000 others had auditioned. She had been worried that because of her height (147 cm), she would be overlooked, but her powerful voice attracted the attention of people while she sang live. The end of 2004 found her being chosen to sing the theme song for Gundam Seed Destiny. Recording of her song \\"Bokutachi no Yukue\\" began at the end of the year. ===Sympathy=== In 2005, she was in the middle of high school entrance exams as the title for her 1st single \\"Bokutachi no Yukue\\" was announced. The single was released on April 2005, and debuted at No. 1 on the Oricon charts. This was a huge success, making Hitomi the second female singer to have a debut single in the number one spot, and the third solo artist to have a debut single reach the top spot. The single ended up selling well over 100,000 copies. Hitomi soon entered Shiogama Girls High School,:ja:高橋瞳#.E3.83.A1.E3.83.A2 and started her first radio personality on Date fm (FM Sendai) called Takahashi Hitomi: Sound D・N・A~. The second single from Hitomi, \\"Evergreen\\", was released on August 12, 2005. The song was used as the theme song for the Japanese TV drama \\"New Kids War\\". The single sales were much lower than her previous single, with the single debuting at No. 22 on the Japanese Oricon Charts, and selling a little less than 30,000 copies. Takahashi's third single, \\"Aozora no Namida\\", was soon released on November 30, 2005, and it was used as the 1st opening theme song for the anime Blood+. (It had originally been planned for an October 12, 2005 released, but was pushed back to the later date.) Its first week on the charts found it at number eight on the Oricon charts with 44,629 copies sold, and it eventually sold over 80,000 copies. On February 22, Hitomi's Official Fan Club was revealed, the title being a play on the first letter of her name and her height, \\"H147.\\" Hitomi also won an award at the 20th Japanese Gold Disc Awards for New Artist of the Year, and sang live at the event. The first studio album from the singer, Sympathy, was released on March 1, 2006. The album came in two formats, CD only and CD+DVD (limited edition), and contained 12 tracks in total, with 7 of them being previously unreleased songs. The album debuted at number ten for its first week on the Oricon Charts, and sold over 30,000 copies. For the release of the album, Hitomi held her first live concert on April 1, 2006. Commenting on how much she enjoyed the concert, Hitomi soon decided to hold more concerts for her \\"sympathy\\" album. The concerts were named the Hitomi Takahashi Live \\"Sympathy\\" ~BOXX Series~, and became a way for her to promote new songs. In total, the tour had six lives. ===Bamboo Collage=== Hitomi released her 4th single \\"Communication\\" on July 12, 2006. The song was the ending theme song for \\"MUSIC FIGHTER\\" during the month of July 2006. Once finally released, this single failed to make it in the Top 20 Daily Charts. It also failed to make it in the Weekly Top 30, and was revealed to debut at number sixty on the charts, selling a little more than 2,000 copies in its first week. It was during the eighth month of 2006 that news of a new single surfaced. This single, titled \\"Ko·mo·re·bi\\", was officially announced to be Hitomi's 5th single at the end of August, and was used as the theme song for the movie Tegami, which features actors Takayuki Yamada, Tetsuji Tamayama, and Erika Sawajiri. Similar to her past single, \\"Ko·mo·re·bi\\" failed to chart in the Top 30 Weekly Charts, and debuted at No. 50 for its first week on the charts, only selling about 300 more copies than \\"Communication\\". In spite of this, Hitomi was chosen to be one of many artists to take part in the new tribute album for the new Death Note movie. Following the release of her two unsuccessful singles was the song \\"Candy Line\\", which was officially announced on Christmas Day. The song was chosen to be used as the 4th ending theme for the anime series, Gin Tama. When released, the single became her biggest hit since \\"Aozora no Namida\\", and reached No. 14 during its first week on the Oricon charts, and overall was reported as selling over 15,000 copies. As her 2nd single of 2007, Takahashi released her 7th single, titled \\"Jet Boy Jet Girl\\", which was released on August 1, 2007. The title song was the new opening theme song to the anime \\"Terra e...\\", and her second single to be released in CD only and CD+DVD formats. The single did not receive the same success as \\"Candy Line\\", but sold over double of her 4th and 5th singles. Takahashi also released a new single a little more than one month after \\"Jet Boy Jet Girl\\", with the title \\"Tsuyoku Nare\\". The title song, aptly named \\"Tsuyoku Nare\\", was used as the ending theme song of the movie \\"Hōtai Club\\". As her past four singles, this song was produced by Takuya, and the lyrics were personally written by Takahashi herself. Though heavily promoted via the movie, \\"Tsuyoku Nare\\" failed to match the success of her \\"sympathy\\" era singles. Continuing the speedy releasing of material, Takahashi released her 2nd album Bamboo Collage. The album featured all the singles since the release of \\"Communication\\", and was her first album to reflect her change from pop/rock music to punk-rock, a change which was made because her voice was thought to be better suited to the latter genre. As most of the singles released for promotion of this album, \\"Bamboo Collage\\" failed to enter the Oricon Weekly Top 30. Despite this, though, Takahashi held her first tour, which consisted of four lives during the early parts of December. ===Picorinpin=== Since the album release and tour, Takahashi kept a low profile in the music scene, but was recording for a few months. On March 1, 2008, Takahashi graduated from high school, and moved from Sendai to Tokyo. Her 9th single \\"Atashi no Machi, Ashita no Machi\\", released on June 4, 2008, was used as first opening theme song of the anime Toshokan Sensō, while its b-side, \\"Mother's Song\\" was used as the ending theme of the NHK BS2 TV show Digital Stadium. After more than a year, September 9, 2009, Takahashi released \\"Wo Ai Ni\\" as collaboration with Beat Crusaders. The song was used as the 14th ending theme for anime television series Gin Tama. On September 28, 2011, Takahashi released her third album, Picorinpin, as her last release with Sony Music Records. The album featured productions of several artists, including Chara, Koji Nakamura and Rolly Teranishi. Picorinpin couldn't make into the Top 200 of the Oricon charts, selling less than 500 copies. ==Discography== *sympathy (2006) *Bamboo Collage (2007) *Picorinpin (2011) == References == ==External links== *Hitomi Takahashi Official Site *Sony Site *H147 – Hitomi Takahashi's Official Fan Club *Hitomi's Official Blog *Hitomi Takahashi's Oricon Page Category:1989 births Category:Gr8!

His debut album, Shallow and Profound, released in 2000, brought Eastern European music to the Western European electronic music scene, and was met with critical acclaim by producers Laurent Garnier and Gilles Peterson on Radio Nova and BBC Radio 1 Worldwide respectively, as well as performing at the Sziget festival and the Lowlands festival in 2000. His most notable collaboration so far has been an audio-visual show with British film director legend Peter Greenaway during the Berlin Film Festival of 2009. He has performed on diverse stages over the years, including festivals such as Sónar, Pukkelpop, Lowlands, Big Chill, Sziget, ADE and venues like Razzmatazz, Melkweg, Paradiso (Amsterdam). Yonderboi's music is often licensed to films, TV and fashion shows or video games, and he has scored movies, theater pieces and he has also composed music for art exhibitions like the Swiss Pavilion of the Venice Biennale 2001. == Biography == === Early years === Yonderboi started experimenting with music in his teenage years, and had his first release in 1998 while he was still a high-school student. The song was called Pink Solidism, which was an instrumental cover of Riders on the Storm by The Doors. Later that summer, his first five track EP, Cinnamon Kisses, came out on vinyl, and Yonderboi struck a record deal with UCMG Hungary. Some of the songs got licensed to Western European compilations. === Shallow And Profound === He recorded his first long-player right after graduation, on his own budget, which was almost US$300. This allowed 2 days in a cheap studio to record the acoustic instruments, like vibraphone, accordion, sax and vocals. Everything else like keys, synth, guitars, bass, scratches were recorded at home, and the material got produced and mixed on an average home PC. The album titled Shallow and Profound came out in 2000 and its success put Yonderboi on the international map of electronic music. He was amongst the pioneers of downtempo and trip hop, the youngest member of the movement, and the only one from the former Eastern Bloc. His music was very much in sync with the global culture of the era, yet it was distinctly different with its Eastern European charm. The album invoked and melted together the romance of several decades of the 20th century, from 30's poetry and chanson throughout 50's/60's jazz to cinematic soundtracks. As the title also suggests the record is divided into two main parts, a more vivid and playful, sometimes cartoonish first part and a rather contemplative, dreamy second part. The most successful song of the album (which came out on single as well), the vibraphone ruled Pabadam - sung by Edina Kutzora, a hungarian singer - was widely recognized. Even Laurent Garnier announced and played it on Radio Nova, not to mention that Gilles Peterson has supported the song on BBC Radio 1 in his program Worldwide. The listeners voted the track up to position 9 in the Worldwide Winners 2000. Still today Pabadam is a frequent guest on compilations, fashion shows and radio programs. Other notable tracks are Road Movie (also available as video), Fairy Of The Lake, Pink Solidism, Ohne Chanteuse. Yonderboi also started to perform his music live, supported by his temporary band called Yonderboi Quintet. They played various festival stages, amongst many others Sónar, Lowlands, Oslo and Rotterdam Jazz Festivals and several clubs throughout Europe and Russia, like Melkweg, Supper Club, Razzmatazz, 16tons. === Splendid Isolation === Yonderboi wanted the second album to be substantially different from its predecessor both in content and on the surface. There were more resources available this time, yet his basic approach to recording remained simple, he recorded almost everything at home, from electric guitars through male vocals to cellos and brass. Only one day was spent in a proper studio, to record the children's choir for the opening track All We Go To Hell, which obviously needed a bigger space than Yonderboi's bedroom. The post-production of the material ended up surprisingly in Los Angeles, thanks to the lucky meeting with Dutch producer Tom Holkenborg, who helped Yonderboi to finish up the record. The album was named Splendid Isolation and came out in 2005. Even though it does have some Eastern European qualities, it is much more melted into Western culture than Shallow and Profound. The record has three main parts, a rather downtempo-ish beginning, then a guitar pop inspired core and a mind bending soundtrack-like closing. Two songs were copied on singles, Were You Thinking Of Me? and People Always Talk About The Weather, each had a gorgeous cinematic video directed by Yonderboi himself. Both the songs and videos got played by several stations, amongst others MTV Europe, KCRW, Studio Brussels. Several songs of the album got licensed to films, TV shows and video games, probably most often the ultra-dark and cynical Before You Snap. On the Splendid Isolation Tour Yonderboi was supported on stage by his second temporary band Kings Of Oblivion, in which Edina Kutzora sung as well. They visited many festivals all over Europe like Pukkelpop, 5 Days Off, Sziget and venues like Paradiso, Melkweg, A38 or Uebel and Gefaehrlich. === Passive Control === The goal was to create the female sequel of the quite masculine Splendid Isolation. Yonderboi found the female voice that he was looking for via Myspace, in the person of a previously unreleased young German singer Charlotte Brandi. The recordings of the album took place in Yonderboi's home studio again. However this time only a few instruments got captured, like female vocals, acoustic guitar and a little cello. The rest of the sounds were played and programmed by Yonder, he also produced and mixed the album all by himself. His intention was to compose a rather coherent sonic universe, where the organic and the artificial creates harmony, and the border between them is almost unrecognizable. The album is difficult to place both geographically and in time, it does not really belong anywhere, however it has a strong European character. Both the soundscape and the artwork is created to be futuristic and outmoded at the same time, the album invokes the utopian art deco vibe of early 20th century, 70's folk and 90's electronic music. The new songs got already recognized and played by amongst others Jason Bentley on Morning Becomes Eclectic at KCRW. The German Vogue (magazine) reviewed the album and had Paint Hunting On The Wall on its monthly playlist at position 5. === Yonderboi In House === In 2012, Yonderboi started a remix project called Yonderboi In House, which will be released as an EP series on his own label Yonderland. Until then these tracks can be heard exclusively on his current, similarly titled live act. While creating the show Yonderboi used his DIY skills to design a matching, conceptual stage set: a glowing house frame and a Y-shaped DJ booth. So far the tour included venues like Palác Akropolis in Prague, Sziget Festival or Amsterdam dance event 2012. As a consequence he was able to cross off an important line on his childhood bucket list “tweak a real Roland TB-303 on stage”. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *Shallow And Profound (2000) *Splendid Isolation (2005) *Passive Control (2011) ===Singles=== *Pabadam (2000) *Were You Thinking of Me?

(born January 31, 1940) is a Canadian lawyer and former senator. ==Early life and education== Crest of the Université Laval Born in Quebec City, Bazin earned a Bachelor of Commerce degree and a Licentiate of Laws (LL.L.) from Université Laval in 1964.Dentons: \\"Jean Bazin, Q.C.\\" He was elected president of the Canadian Union of Students for the 1964-65 school year. While at Laval, Bazin became a close friend of another law student, Brian Mulroney, and was part of Mulroney's close circle of friends, including Bernard Roy, Lucien Bouchard, Michel Cogger, Michael Meighen and Peter White.Konrad Yakabuski, \\"Bernard Roy was Brian Mulroney's right-hand man,\\" Globe and Mail, April 15, 2013. Mulroney would go on to be Prime Minister of Canada; Bouchard would be Premier of Quebec; and Bazin, Cogger and Meighen would all become senators. While they were students, Roy was apparently the driving force to get them to study hard for their law degrees, as he did not think any of them had a future in politics. He ended up as Mulroney's chief of staff. ==Legal career== Bazin was called to the Barreau du Québec in 1965, starting with the law firm of Byers Casgrain. He worked there for twenty-two years until he was called to the Senate.Maurice Jannard, \\"Bazin muet sur l'affaire Oerlikon\\", La Presse, February 4, 1987. In 1970-71, Bazin was president of the Association du Jeune Barreau de Montréal (Young Lawyers Bar of Montreal). In that capacity, he was involved in the creation of the Bureau de l’assistance judiciaire du Barreau de Montréal, a forerunner to the provincial Aide juridique (Legal Aid) program. Bazin was also on the executives of the Barreau du Québec et the Barreau de Montréal (1972-1973).Barreau du Quebec - Distinction Avocat émérite - Liste des récipiendaires: Me Jean Bazin, c.r., Ad.E. From 1987 to 1988, he was the national president of the Canadian Bar Association.Canadian Bar Association: Past-Presidents. Bazin was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1984 by the federal government. In 2011, the Barreau awarded him the distinction of Avocat émérite, in recognition of his excellence as a lawyer, his service to the profession, and his long-standing interest in alternative dispute resolution and plain language. ==Political career== The Senate of Canada Bazin was active in the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, and initially supported Joe Clark. However, after becoming disenchanted with Clark's leadership, he joined in the group which was pushing for Mulroney to replace Clark as party leader.John C. Courtney, Do Conventions Matter?: Choosing National Party Leaders in Canada, (Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 1995) p. 192.Les Whittington, \\"The PM's Pals - Same names crop up in Tory activities\\", Southam News - Prince George Citizen - January 30, 1987, p. 5. In 1983, Mulroney was elected party leader. The following year, Mulroney led the Progressive Conservatives to a landslide victory in the 1984 general election. In 1986, the Mulroney government appointed Bazin to the Senate of Canada representing the senatorial division of De la Durantaye, Quebec. He sat as a Progressive Conservative and had the position of Vice-Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs.Parliament of Canada: \\"Bazin, The Hon. Jean, Q.C., B.A., L.LL., B.Comm.\\" In 1987, there was a major political scandal when a piece of land in Quebec was sold at inflated price to the Swiss company OC Oerlikon, which needed the land to fulfill a federal defence contract. Concerns arose that information had leaked to speculators from inside the government about the upcoming defence contract.Kenneth Freed, \\"New Canadian Scandal Accelerates Mulroney's Fall From Grace\\", Los Angeles Times, January 23, 1987.John F. Burns, \\"Scandal Imperils Mulroney's Hold\\", New York Times, January 25, 1987. Bazin's firm, Byers Casgrain, was acting for Oerlikon and Bazin was one of the people who alerted the Prime Minister to concerns about the transaction. Mulroney dismissed a junior Cabinet minister and requested that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigate the matter. Bazin declined to comment publicly on the matter, citing his duty to respect solicitor-client privilege. Bazin resigned from the Senate in 1989. ==Career post-politics== Bazin is currently counsel with the Canadian branch of Dentons, a multinational law firm. Following his time as senator, Bazin returned to the practice of law with his old firm, Byers Casgrain. When that firm merged with Fraser Milner, Bazin continued as a partner in the new firm, Fraser Milner Casgrain.Fraser Milner Casgrain - Merger News - June 6, 2000. In turn, Dentons was formed in 2013 when Fraser Milner Casgrain merged with two other large law firms, the Anglo-American SNR Denton and the French Salans. He acts as commercial arbitrator and mediator in a number of fields. In 2004, there was a serious leadership dispute in the Mohawk community of Kanesatake, triggered by disagreements between the Grand Chief and other chiefs on the Kanesatake council. At one point, the Grand Chief's house burnt down and he left the community. The provincial government of Premier Jean Charest appointed Bazin as mediator, to help resolve the dispute.\\"L'ancien sénateur conservateur Jean Bazin est appelé en renfort - Un médiateur tentera de ramener la paix à Kanesatake,\\" Le Devoir, January 29, 2004.\\"Ex-senator to help resolve crisis at Kanesatake\\", Globe and Mail, January 29, 2004.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1899–1903 and 1907–1914, as a member of the Conservative Party. Ferguson was born in Ontario and came to Manitoba in 1882. He was a farmer and lived in Hamiota during his political career. He first campaigned for the Manitoba legislature in the 1896 provincial election, and lost to Liberal incumbent David McNaught by fifty-four votes in the Saskatchewan constituency. He ran again for Saskatchewan in the 1899 election, and defeated Liberal candidate John Henry McConnell by fifteen votes. The Conservatives won this election, and Ferguson served in the legislature as a backbench supporter of premiers Hugh John Macdonald and Rodmond Roblin. Redistribution forced Ferguson into the Hamiota constituency for the 1903 election, and he lost to Liberal David Jackson by twenty-two votes. He was returned to the legislature for Hamiota in the 1907 election, and won again in 1910. Ferguson served as chair of public accounting during his time in the legislature. His biographical entry in the Canadian Parliamentary Guide indicates that he was popular with both sides of the house. He lost to John Henry McConnell by 398 votes in the 1914 election, and by 347 votes in a 1920 rematch.

It lies in the Ortenaukreis, between the Black Forest and the Rhine. ==History== Zell was settled on territory owned by Gengenbach Abbey. The monastery was founded by the Lords of Geroldseck, to whose sovereign lands belonged much of the modern Ortenau district. The monastery was consecrated within the Zähringen order, with records dating back to 1139. In 1289, Rudolph I invested the monastery as an Imperial abbey and was placed within the Gengenbach order under the Diocese of Strasbourg. However, ownership and the overlordship remained with the Baron of Hohengeroldseck until 1636, with the death of Baron Jacob and the extinction of his line. The city separated from Gengenbach Abbey and authority of the Hohengeroldesecks with the support of nearby cities Gengenbach and Offenburg, which had acquired Imperial immediacy in the years 1366 and 1340, respectively. Zell won immediacy toward the end of the 14th century, and suffered gravely from the Peasants War, the Thirty Years War, and the wars of King Louis XIV of France. In the year 1800, the Imperial city controlled about 50 square miles (English) of territory and shared boundaries with the Free City of Gengenbach on the west, the Imperial Abbey of Gengenbach on the north, the Reichstal or Imperial Valley of the Harmersbach on the east, and the Lordship of Haslach, a possession of the Fürstenberg, on the south.

In around 1700, it came under the control of the Lords of Mayershofen. ; Unterharmersbach : The first documented mention of Unterharmersbach dates to 1139. In 1200 was taken over by the Bamberg Diocese. By way of the dukes of Zähringen, the Earls of Fürstenberg, and the Prince of Geroldseck, Unterharmersbach came under the control of the Strasbourg Diocese. The city is bordered on the north by Nordrach, on the northeast by Oberharmersbach, on the southeast by Fischerbach, on the south by the city of Haslach, in the southwest by Steinach, on the west by Biberach, and on the northwest by the city of Gengenbach. ==Incorporations== * 1974: Oberentersbach * 1975: Unterentersbach, Unterharmersbach ==Political administration== The city is the seat of the arranged administration partnership with the communities of Biberach, Nordrach and Oberharmersbach. ==Local election results== The local council elections on the 13 June 2004 had the following result: 1\\\\.

From 1963 until 2011, the station was a non- commercial radio station licensed to San Francisco, California, broadcast at 90.3 FM MHz. ==KUSF history== KUSF began in 1963 as a campus-only AM station managed by the Associated Students of the University of San Francisco (ASUSF). In 1973, the University of San Francisco (USF) was offered an FM radio station by a small local Bible college that wished to discontinue its radio operations. USF accepted the offer and on April 25, 1977, KUSF became an FM station broadcasting on the 90.3 frequency. The old AM station later became the student-managed KDNZ. Originally broadcasting six hours a day, KUSF began broadcasting 24 hours a day in 1981. In its early days KUSF was a conventional college station, broadcasting programs of interest to the university and greater San Francisco community. However, KUSF soon garnered attention by playing new underground music: it was one of the first radio stations to play punk rock. Many now-famous acts also first gained exposure on KUSF, most notably The B-52's and Metallica. In addition to Metallica, the program Rampage Radio (hosted on Saturday nights on KUSF from midnight to 5AM by Ron Quintana) was responsible for helping launch the careers of heavy metal bands, or giving them their first exposure in San Francisco, such as Iron Maiden, Queensrÿche, Megadeth, Venom, Slayer, Anthrax, Overkill, Manowar, Accept, Anvil and Raven, as well as local Bay Area acts Y&T;, Metal Church, Exodus, Possessed, Testament, Death Angel, Forbidden, Lȧȧz Rockit, Vio-lence and Heathen. On January 18, 2011, USF announced plans to sell the 90.3 FM frequency to the Classical Public Radio Network, which is owned by the University of Southern California. In addition, USC announced that it had reached an agreement with Entercom Communications to take over the intellectual property of local classical outlet KDFC (102.1 FM), and moved the station's programming to the 90.3 FM frequency. The KUSF intellectual property remained with USF, which launched an upgraded online-only station. The KUSF call sign now belongs to a radio station (91.3 FM) licensed to serve Glendale, Oregon, United States. Upon announcement of the sale, KUSF locked its doors, shut down its website temporarily and went off the air. On February 8, 2011, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted 8-3 to oppose the sale. A group of former KUSF volunteers formed KXSF San Francisco Community Radio, a low power FM station broadcasting at 102.5fm in San Francisco. KXSF began broadcasting on September 4, 2018. ==Programming== The station's musical programming varies from rock to hip-hop to world music. New music programming is broadcast Monday through Friday from midnight to 6 PM. Cultural programming takes over weekdays from 6 PM to midnight, and all day Saturday and Sunday.myspace.com/kusf ==Awards and recognition== KUSF was nominated for \\"College/Non-Commercial Radio Station Of The Year\\" in the 2008 PLUG Independent Music Awards. In July 2000, KUSF was named one of twenty recommended radio stations in the United States by US Airways' \\"ATTACHE\\" magazine. KUSF possesses Gold Records from groups including R.E.M., the Bangles, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Cowboy Junkies, Midnight Oil, the B-52's, and Love and Rockets.

This artifact is short and inexpensive to produce early in the analysis or envisioning stages of a software development project. There are a wide array of different process models for software development. Some processes, like the Rational Unified Process, define clear goals for creating the Use Case Survey, while other processes do not mention this artifact at all. In practice, the use case survey can be valuable for the following reasons: # By creating a single list of the use cases, the analyst effectively creates a detailed list of potential scope items for one or more projects. This provides an excellent introduction to the business problem for those individuals who need to learn the context of a project. # With a single list of use cases, an analyst can work with business customers to determine if the elements of business process change envisioned by the tools is sensible, long before prototypes or wire- frames would be useful. # The fact that the use case survey is inexpensive to produce and is fairly easy to understand makes it less difficult to change. No one, including the analyst, is heavily invested in the effort that produces this artifact. # The use case survey is not the scope of the project per se. It is intended to be the scope of the business problem. As a result, each of the aspects of the business problem can be weighed for priority and considered by different stakeholders before the project scope is actually decided. This helps form common consensus and reduces a potential cause of friction later. # The survey itself can be viewed as a holistic view of the business problem. This is a useful tool for analysis because each of the stakeholders can review the list to make sure that their processes are captured and described. Gaps can be easily identified before the project scope is finalized and costs are estimated. This reduces the chance that a project will deliver a solution for one stakeholder that creates an expensive problem for another. # Senior Application Developers, over time, build up the experience needed to create valid estimates of project development cost. By presenting a use case survey to a Senior Developer, a richer understanding of the business problem can be communicated than by most other mechanisms. This allows the developer to produce more accurate and reliable estimates and to provide better development assumptions. The use case survey is a practical way to gather user requirements for most types of business software development including rapid application development but may be less useful for needs such as game development.

Dinkelsbühl is a former free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire. In local government terms, Dinkelsbühl lies near the western edge of the Landkreis (or local government district) of district of Ansbach, north of Aalen. Dinkelsbühl lies on the northern part of the Romantic Road, and is one of three particularly striking historic towns on the northern part of the route, the others being Rothenburg ob der Tauber and Nördlingen. The town lies on the southern edge of the Franconian Heights and on the River Wörnitz, which rises in the town of Schillingsfürst. The population in 2013 was 11,315 ==History== Fortified by Emperor Henry V, in 1305 Dinkelsbühl received the same municipal rights as Ulm, and in 1351 was raised to the position of a Free Imperial City. Its municipal code, the Dinkelsbühler Recht, published in 1536, and revised in 1738, contained a very extensive collection of public and private laws. ===Reformation=== During the Protestant Reformation, Dinkelsbühl was notable for being – eventually along only with Ravensburg, Augsburg and Biberach an der Riß — a Bi-confessional (i.e. roughly equal numbers of Roman Catholics and Protestant citizens, with equal rights) Imperial City () where the Peace of Westphalia caused the establishment of a joint Catholic–Protestant government and administrative system, with equality offices () and a precise and equal distribution between Catholic and Protestant civic officials. This status ended in 1802, when these cities were annexed by the Kingdom of Bavaria. Around 1534 the majority of the population of Dinkelsbühl became Protestant.http://www.dinkelsbuehl.de/ISY/mlib/media/DIN_Streuprospekt_GB.pdf?mediatrace=.383. ===Thirty Years War=== Every summer Dinkelsbühl celebrates the city's surrender to Swedish troops in 1632 during the Thirty Years' War. This reenactment is played out by many of the town's residents. It features an array of Swedish soldiers attacking the city gate and children dressed in traditional garb coming to witness the event. Paper cones full of chocolate and candy are given as gifts to children. This historical event is called the \\"Kinderzeche\\" and can in some aspects be compared with the \\"Meistertrunk\\" in Rothenburg. The name is derived from the two German words for \\"child\\" and \\"the bill for food and drink in an inn\\", and is called such because of the legend that a child saved the town from massacre by the Swedes during the surrender. The legend tells that when the Swedish army besieged the town, a teenage girl took the children to the Swedish general to beg for mercy. The Swedish general had recently lost his young son to illness, and a boy who approached him so closely resembled his own son that he decided to spare the town. ===Present day=== The film The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm (1962) was filmed on location in Dinkelsbühl. The Werner Herzog film The Enigma of Kasper Hauser (German: Jeder für sich und Gott gegen alle; trans. Every Man for Himself and God Against All) premiered on 1 November 1974 in Dinkelsbühl, where it was originally filmed. ==Main sights== Dinkelsbühl is still surrounded by the old medieval walls and towers. There exist a lot of outstanding attractions. The image of this town is very typical for a German town of the 15th to early 17th century. * St. George's Minster was built in the late 15th century Gothic style to designs by Nikolaus Eseler.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1910 to 1914, as a Liberal, making him the first Jewish Canadian to serve in that legislature. Green was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, and was educated at King's College in Windsor, Nova Scotia. He received a law degree in 1906. Green then relocated to western Canada, and in 1907 became the first Jew admitted to the legal profession in Manitoba. He was a member of the firm Chapman and Green, and continued his practice in Winnipeg for several decades. He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1910 election, defeating incumbent Conservative John F. Mitchell by 620 votes in Winnipeg North. He won 27 of 35 polls in the constituency. The Conservatives won the election, and Green served as a member of the opposition for the next four years. He was not a candidate in the 1914 election. He attempted to return to the legislature in 1915, but lost to Social Democrat Richard Rigg by 231 votes. Green's biographical entry in the 1914 Canadian Parliamentary Guide lists him as \\"apparently the first Hebrew to take a seat in any Legislature in Canada\\". This is incorrect: Ezekiel Hart, who was in fact related to him, was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada in 1807 and 1808, although he was expelled from his seat because he was a Jew. Henry Nathan, a federal Member of Parliament from British Columbia in the 1870s, was also Jewish. Green remained an active member of the Liberal Party of Canada after leaving the legislature, and organized meetings for Liberal candidates at Winnipeg's Torah Talmud Hall in the 1920s. He was president of the Winnipeg North Liberal Association in 1930, and supported his party's decision not to field a candidate against Labor incumbent Abraham Albert Heaps in that year's federal election. Green argued that a Liberal candidate could have split the anti- Conservative vote, and allowed the Conservative candidate to be elected. The Liberals nominated a candidate in Winnipeg North for the 1935 election, and on this occasion Green campaigned against Heaps on the grounds that the latter was a socialist. Heaps won the election. The University of New Brunswick's Faculty of Law now offers Hart Green Scholarships as entrance awards, in his honour. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Category:1885 births Category:1969 deaths Category:Jewish Canadian politicians Category:Manitoba Liberal Party MLAs Category:Canadian Conservative rabbis Category:People from Saint John, New Brunswick ","title":"Solomon Hart Green"},{"id":"2578148","text":"To Have and to Hold (1899) is a novel by American author Mary Johnston. Published by Houghton Mifflin, it was the bestselling novel in the United States in the following year (1900). ==Plot summary== To Have and to Hold is the story of an English soldier, Ralph Percy, turned Virginian explorer in colonial Jamestown. Ralph buys a wife for himself - a girl named Jocelyn Leigh - little knowing that she is the escaping ward of King James I, fleeing a forced marriage to Lord Carnal. Jocelyn hardly loves Ralph - indeed, she seems to abhor him. Carnal, Jocelyn's husband-to-be, eventually comes to Jamestown, unaware that Ralph Percy and Jocelyn Leigh are man and wife. Lord Carnal attempts to kidnap Jocelyn several times and eventually follows Ralph, Jocelyn, and their two companions - Jeremy Sparrow, the Separatist minister, and Diccon, Ralph's servant - as they escape from the King's orders to arrest Ralph and carry Jocelyn back to England. The boat they are in, however, crashes on a desert island, but they are accosted by pirates, who, after a short struggle, agree to take Ralph as their captain, after he pretends to be the pirate \\"Kirby\\". The pirates gleefully play on with Ralph's masquerade, until he refuses to allow them to rape and pillage those aboard Spanish ships. The play is up when the pirates see an English ship off the coast of Florida. Ralph refuses to fire upon it, knowing it carries the new Virginian governor, Sir Francis Wyatt, but the pirates open fire, and Jeremy Sparrow, before the English ship can be destroyed, purposefully crashes the ship into a reef. The pirates are all killed, but the Englishmen (and woman) are rescued by the Governor's ship. Aboard the ship, Ralph is tried for piracy after Lord Carnal tells the Governor that he ordered the destruction of the ship, but Jocelyn, having come to love Ralph, speaks for him. Her words are so persuasive that the Governor believes her and frees Ralph. They return to Virginia, though Ralph is forced to remain in a gaol - King's orders. Ralph is lured into a trap, though, by Lord Carnal and is subsequently captured by Indians - but not before putting up a fight and seeing Lord Carnal terribly wounded. The brother of Pocahontas, the Indian Nantauquas, rescues him and Diccon, but only to inform them that all the Virginian Indians plan to massacre the Jamestown settlers. As they are on their way back to Jamestown, Diccon is shot and killed by a hostile Indian, and Ralph is left alone to brave his way back. Returning to the colony, he gives his information, only to be told that Jocelyn had made her way to the forest in search of him after his absence was noticed, with Jeremy Sparrow, and that they had not been found. It is also discovered that Lord Carnal has taken poison and will die within a week. Jamestown is saved, thanks to Ralph's almost-too-late warning, and after things are stabilized, Ralph goes in search of Jocelyn and the minister. After a long and seemingly fruitless search, Nantauquas himself, though he had turned traitor, leads Ralph to where Jocelyn is staying. The two are reunited, and at the end of the story intend to go to England, where Jocelyn's lands have been restored to her and they can finally live in peace. To Have and to Hold was revised and edited by Josh and Sarah Wean for the four-hundredth anniversary of the founding of Jamestown. It is sold in this edition by the Christian company, Vision Forum Inc. ==Publication history== The novel was originally serialized in Atlantic Monthly.

Made for ITV by Central Television, it starred Stephanie Beacham in the title role. 13 episodes were made which were shown throughout the summer of 1985. ==Series history== Written by Ron Hutchinson as a dry commentary on Thatcherite values in the 1980s, the series was set in the East Midlands garment industry and tells the story of a woman returning to the United Kingdom from Greece after eight years in self-imposed exile. She is determined to claw back control of her chain of high street clothes shops that are now controlled by her stepsister, and also get her foot back into the \\"House of Bea\\", a family-owned garment factory run by her father and stepmother, which is now losing money. The series is chiefly memorable for the high-octane performance of Stephanie Beacham as the eponymous Connie, snarling her way through such camp, metaphorical 1980s capitalistic dialogue as \\"My spoon is going into the gravy, my snout is going into the trough. I'm having some of that.\\" It was partly on the strength of Connie that Beacham won the role of Sable in The Colbys, the spin-off series from the American supersoap Dynasty, which subsequently led to a high-profile career for her in American television. Other notable castmembers in the series included Pam Ferris as Connie's conniving stepsister Nesta, George Costigan as her ex-husband Arnie, Richard Morant as her new love interest David Jamieson, Brenda Bruce as her stepmother Bea and Paul Rogers as Hector, Connie's father. Actor Ronald Lacey, best known for his role as the villainous Nazi agent Arnold Toht in Raiders of the Lost Ark, appeared in several episodes as Crawder, a corrupt, wealthy industrialist with whom Connie must tangle. ==Reception== Writing in The Guardian, TV critic Nancy Banks-Smith gave the opening episode a positive review, depicting the series as a \\"gritty soap\\" and stating that the writing has a \\"nice citrus bite to it, sharp and funny.\\" She praised the cast as \\"strong\\", and opined that Beacham \\"has a whiff of big cat about her.\\" ==Releases== ===DVD release=== Network released the full 13-part series on DVD as a 4-disc set on 24 September 2012.Network DVD (Connie) The set includes a photo gallery as a bonus feature.

It is the seat of the Bishop of Newcastle and is the mother church of the Diocese of Newcastle, the most northerly diocese of the Anglican Church in England, which reaches from the River Tyne as far north as Berwick-upon-Tweed and as far west as Alston in Cumbria.Diocese website , URL accessed 30 June 2007] Founded in 1091 during the same period as the nearby castle, the Norman church was destroyed by fire in 1216 and the current building was completed in 1350, so is mostly of the Perpendicular style of the 14th century. Its tower is noted for its 15th-century lantern spire. Heavily restored in 1777, the building was raised to cathedral status in 1882, when it became known as the Cathedral Church of St Nicholas. ==History== Looking down the nave towards the East Window. The choir The cathedral is named after St Nicholas, the patron saint of sailors and boats. This may reflect the cathedral's position on the northern heights above the River Tyne. It was originally a parish church, built in 1091. It was built close to the line of Hadrian's Wall through Newcastle, which may have passed through the churchyard to the south, but unfortunately the exact location of its line through the very centre of the city is currently lost. Close to the south of the cathedral is Newcastle Castle, which gave the city its name, and which was itself built on the site of the Hadrian's Wall fort of Pons Aelius. The Norman church was destroyed by fire in 1216 and the present structure was completed in 1350.Eneas Mackenzie, 'St Nicholas' church: History and architecture', in Historical Account of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne Including the Borough of Gateshead (Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 1827), pp. 235-255 accessed 31 December 2014. The most famous incumbent of the cathedral was the Scottish reformer John Knox, who served as minister from late 1550 until 2 February 1553.Jane Dawson, John Knox, (Yale University Press: 2015). 61-64 In the mid-19th century Newcastle experienced a huge increase in its population, leading to the construction of over 20 new churches in the suburbs. As Newcastle continued to grow, so did its need for a diocese separate from Durham, and so in 1882 the Diocese of Newcastle was formed, with St Nicholas's as its cathedral. With this, Newcastle was designated a City in the same year. The cathedral is notable for its unusual lantern spire, which was constructed in 1448. For hundreds of years, it was a main navigation point for ships using the River Tyne. At its base the tower measures by and it is from the base to the top of the steeple.Tower statistics , URL accessed 30 June 2007 On each corner of the lantern are gilded statues, of Adam eating the apple, Eve holding out the apple, Aaron is dressed as a bishop, and David holds a harp. Following work on the street in the 1860s the tower was found to be cracking and tilting, so two porches were added to buttress the structure. Since then the tower has settled and the ornate wooden font cover, which is suspended from the tower inside, does not hang in line with the font. The interior of the church was badly damaged by Scottish invaders during their brief occupation of the city in 1640, and in 1644, during a nine-week siege, Scottish invaders threatened to bombard the lantern tower, but were deterred when the mayor Sir John Marley put his Scottish prisoners in it.History of the building at GenUKI website, URL accessed 9 March 2007 The tower was repaired in September 1645, 1723 and 1761. A lightning conductor was added in 1777. In 2020, the cathedral is closed to visitors on account of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. However, the building work of the Common Ground in Sacred Space heritage project continues. The east end of the cathedral had previously remained in use and could formerly be accessed via a courtyard on the north side of the building. The current works entail removing the pews, installing underfloor heating, restoring and re-laying up to 130 ledger stones (gravestones), improving the cathedral gardens, and adding an east entrance to the building.stnicholascathedral.org.uk == Bells == The tower contains a complete ring of twelve bells, the tenor bell which weighs almost two tons, plus three 15th-century bells, one of which, \\"St Nicholas\\", is rung for daily services. The addition of a second treble bell (named \\"Gabriel\\") in 1999 has made it possible to ring a lighter peal of ten bells.Description of the bells at the cathedral website , URL accessed 30 June 2007 Among the bells is a bourdon ('The Major') which weighs nearly six tonnes and is hung for swing chiming. Newcastle Cathedral is the second tallest religious building in Newcastle and the sixth tallest structure in the city overall. ==Notable interior features== Medieval Madonna and Child roundel in St Margaret's Chapel The nave furnishings were designed by the local artist and craftsman Ralph Hedley in the early 20th century, after the parish church of St Nicholas became a cathedral in 1882. The high altar depicts Christ in Majesty holding an orb and sceptre, flanked by the Four Evangelists each with their special symbol.Cathedral tour , URL accessed 30 June 2007 Inside the cathedral a finely-carved marble monument commemorates Admiral Lord Collingwood (1748–1810), who took over command at the Battle of Trafalgar (21 October 1805) after the death of Admiral Lord Nelson. Collingwood was baptised and married in St Nicholas's and each year, on 21 October, a wreath is laid in his memory in front of the monument. The cathedral is filled with beautiful stained glass. Much of the original glass was broken during the Civil War and most now dates from the 18th century onwards. St Margaret's Chapel contains the only known fragment of medieval stained glass in the cathedral, a beautiful roundel of the Madonna feeding the Christ Child. More-modern stained glass works such as in St. George's Chapel were erected in honour of two of Tyneside's late 19th-/early 20th-century industrial pioneers, who both died in 1931 within weeks of each other. Other references to industry can be found in the cathedral's stained glass, including in the Charles Parsons window, which features Turbinia, the first turbine-driven steam yacht, with which Parsons astonished the Queen's Navy at the Spithead naval review in 1897. The cathedral contains a number of memorials, the oldest being a 13th-century effigy of an unknown knight, probably a member of the household of Edward I. It is one of the oldest objects in the cathedral. Another is the \\"Thornton Brass\\", a monumental brass to Roger Thornton and his wife; he was a successful merchant, three times Mayor of Newcastle, several times Member of Parliament, and great benefactor to the cathedral. This is one of the finest examples of a Flemish brass and dates from at least as early as 1441 (may be pre-1429); it is believed to be the largest brass in the United Kingdom, and originally it covered Thornton's tomb in the nearby All Saints' Church, Newcastle upon Tyne. This commemoration to Thornton, his wife, seven sons and seven daughters can be seen fixed vertically behind the High Altar. A horizontal replica is kept near the north door of the cathedral for brass rubbing purposes. Just to the north of the cathedral stands a bronze statue of Queen Victoria erected to commemorate 500 years of the Shrievalty (the jurisdiction of a sheriff) of Newcastle. Sculpted by Alfred Gilbert and unveiled in 1903, two years after Queen Victoria's death, the statue was a gift from W. H. Stephenson, a company director and politician who held the office of mayor in Newcastle seven times. ==Dean and chapter== As of 8 August 2019:Cathedral of St Nicholas — Contact Us (Accessed 2 February 2019) *Dean — Geoff Miller (since 20 October 2018 installation) *Canon for Music and Liturgy (i.e. precentor) — Clare MacLaren (since 11 October 2015)St Nicholas Cathedral, Special Evensong, 11 Oct 2015 *Canon for Outreach and Discipleship (i.e. chancellor) — Peter Dobson (since December 2019) *Archdeacon of Northumberland — Mark Wroe (since 24 March 2019 installation) *a Diocesan Canon — vacant since 28 February 2019 retirement of Canon for Evangelism (Diocesan Advisor in Local Evangelism & Mission) ==Music== The T C Lewis — Harrison — Nicholson organ at Newcastle Cathedral.

Prior to its liquidation, Hanjin Shipping was South Korea's largest container line and one of the world's top ten container carriers in terms of capacity. ==Overview== Hanjin shipping formerly operated some 60 liner and tramper services around the globe, transporting over 100 million tons of cargo annually. Its fleet consisted of many container ships, bulk and LNG carriers. Hanjin Shipping had its own subsidiaries dedicated to ocean transportation and terminal operation and it had several branch offices in various countries. On February 17, 2017, Hanjin Shipping Co. was declared bankrupt by South Korean courts. ==Bankruptcy== Hanjin container ===Insolvency=== Hanjin Shipping's insolvency was caused in part by overcapacity in the container ship industry. ===Liquidation=== In April 2016, Hanjin applied to its creditors for debt restructuring, in order to avoid formal insolvency proceedings. On August 31, 2016, Hanjin filed for receivership at the Seoul Central District Court and requested the court to freeze its assets, after losing support from its banks the previous day. After Hanjin's receivership was publicized, creditors confiscated assets and Hanjin vessels experienced access issues in ports globally because service providers were not informed if and how they would be paid to load and unload Hanjin vessels . On September 2, 2016 Hanjin Shipping Co. filed papers in U.S. Bankruptcy court in Newark, New Jersey that would allow its vessels to dock without its ships, cargo or equipment being confiscated by creditors. Shortly after its receivership, experts predicted Hanjin Shipping was likely to be liquidated. In the following months, Hanjin Shipping announced it would shut down offices around the world, lay-off workers, sell remaining assets, and discontinue most services. On February 17, 2017, Hanjin Shipping Co. was declared bankrupt by South Korean courts, with a court order to be liquidated. ===Aftermath and legacy=== Hanjin Shipping was the largest bankruptcy in the container transport industry and it caused worldwide supply chain and shipping disruption as cargo ships were left stuck at ports and canals waiting for cash payments. Hanjin's bankruptcy created a massive ripple effect. Other businesses that rely on physical products found themselves without the expected revenue from inventory that became stuck at sea. The containers of other container ship companies also became stranded on Hanjin vessels. Hanjin collapsed at an especially inconvenient time for retailers furnishing their inventories with imported items in preparation for a seasonal uptick in Thanksgiving, Christmas, Black Friday, and New Year's sales. Although large companies such as Nike were affected, the repercussions were more prominent on smaller companies. In February 2017, SM Line, a new shipping firm formed by Samra Midas (SM) Group, purchased five vessels previously owned by Hanjin. In March, SM Line acquired two of Hanjin Shipping's terminals in Korea, in the cities of Gwangyang and Incheon. In August 2017, a South Korean bankruptcy trustee which was appointed to manage the liquidation of Hanjin Shipping reported that it had only collected 220 million USD from the sale of Hanjin's assets. This sum amounts to only 2% of the US$10.5 billion total debt Hanjin owes to its creditors.http://www.globaltrademag.com/global-logistics/final- bill-hanjin-shipping- bankruptcy-10-billionhttp://www.tradewindsnews.com/finance/1322963/hanjin- shipping-sales-fail-to-plug-usd-105bn- holehttp://business.mb.com.ph/2017/08/09/hanjin-shipping-raises-fraction- of-10-5-b-in-bankruptcy-claims/ ==Services== Hanjin 20 foot containers * Container – Transported approximately 3.7 million TEU containers a year.

She is married to fellow manga artist Tatsuneko, from whom he took the name of . She is a graduate of Mita Senior High School, Tokyo. She currently lives in Setagaya, Tokyo with her husband and daughter. ==Profile== She began her career as a dōjinshi artist creating dōjinshi for works such as Saint Seiya, Captain Tsubasa and Maōden. She debuted in a commercial magazine with the original work Metal Heart (serialized in Kobunsha's Comic VAL from November 1986). After her debut, she continued to contribute on numerous dōjin works. However, the later disbanding of a dōjin circle, Yajō Teikoku, she had founded with Maki Chikura, led to her taking numerous breaks from her commercial works. Due to this, there were incomplete works penned by her during this period. During her years in middle school, she had been a fan of Masami Kurumada's manga series Ring ni Kakero, Fūma no Kojirō, Saint Seiya and B't X (serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump), sending Kurumada numerous fan letters asking to meet him, after which Kurumada finally agreed, inviting her to his workplace. When asked about her penname in an interview in the September 2006 issue of Puff, she responded that she had originally thought of making it Jun Kōga, but subsequently changed it to Yun Kōga. Among her noted works is Loveless, which has been serialized in Monthly Comic Zero Sum since 2002 and is ongoing, as well as her work .

Cockle was born on 14 January 1819. He was the second son of James Cockle, a surgeon, of Great Oakley, Essex. Educated at Charterhouse and Trinity College, Cambridge, he entered the Middle Temple in 1838, practising as a special pleader in 1845 and being called in 1846. Joining the midland circuit, he acquired a good practice, and on the recommendation of Chief Justice Sir William Erle he was appointed as the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland in Queensland, Australia on 21 February 1863; he served until his retirement on 24 June 1879. Cockle was made a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) on 1 June 1865. He received the honour of knighthood on 29 July 1869. He returned to England in 1878. James Cockle at Dictionary of National Biography ==Personal life== Sir James married Adelaide, who became Lady Cockle when he was knighted in 1869. His residence Oakwal in Windsor, Queensland, Brisbane is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. It is believed they derived the name Oakwal from Cockle's birthplace at Great Oakley in Essex and his wife's birthplace of Walton in Suffolk. ==Mathematical and scientific investigations== Cockle is also remembered for his mathematical and scientific investigations. For instance he invented the number systems of tessarines and coquaternions, and worked with Arthur Cayley (1821-1895) on the theory of linear algebra. Like many young mathematicians he attacked the problem of solving the quintic equation, notwithstanding Abel–Ruffini theorem that a solution by radicals was impossible. In this field Cockle achieved some notable results, amongst which is his reproduction of Sir William R. Hamilton's modification of Abel's theorem. Algebraic forms were a favourite object of his studies. He also made contributions to the theory of differential equations, in particular the development of the theory of differential invariants or criticoids. He displayed a keen interest in scientific societies. From 1863 to 1879 he was president of the Queensland Philosophical Society (now incorporated in the Royal Society of Queensland); on his return to England he became associated with the London Mathematical Society, of which he was president from 1886 to 1888, and the Royal Astronomical Society, serving as a member of the council from 1888 to 1892. He died in London on 27 January 1895. An obituary notice by the Revd. Robert Harley was published in 1895 in Proc. Roy. Soc. vol. 59. A volume containing his scientific and mathematical researches made during the years 1864-1877 was presented to the British Museum in 1897 by his widow. Like his father, Sir James became extremely wealthy during his lifetime, leaving an estate of £32,169, which is approximately £2.7 million if adjusted for inflation as of 2008.UK Inflation (CPI) calculator ==Works== Biodiversity Heritage Library has London-Dublin-Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine, series 3 and 4, where articles by James Cockle were published: * 1848: On Certain Functions Resembling Quaternions and on a New Imaginary in Algebra, 33:435–9. * 1849: On a New Imaginary in Algebra 34:37–47. * 1849: On the Symbols of Algebra and on the Theory of Tessarines 34:406–10. * 1849: On Systems of Algebra involving more than one Imaginary, and on Equations of the Fifth Degree 35: 434 to 7 * 1850: On the True Amplitude of a Tessarine, on the Origin of the word Theodolite, and on Light under the action of Magnetism 36:290-2. * 1850: On Impossible Equations, on Impossible Quantities and on Tessarines 37:281–3. * 1851: On the Solution of Certain Systems of Equations series 4, 2: 289 to 93 * 1852: On Algebraic Transformation, on Quadruple Algebra and on the Theory of Equations, series 4, 3 : 436 to 39 * 1852: On the Method of Symmetric Products 4: 492 to 96 * 1853 Method of Symmetric Products, continued 5: 170 to 74 * 1853: Fragment on Multiple Values 6: 444 to 48 * 1854: On Method of Symmetric Products, concluded 7: 130 to 38 Cockle also wrote a series \\"Method of Vanishing Groups\\" for the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal, volumes and pages 2: 267 to 73, 3: 179 to 81, and 4: 174 to 78. ==See also== * Judiciary of Australia * List of judges of the Supreme Court of Queensland ==References* John J.

He entered the Society of Jesus in 1646. The greatest part of his life was spent at Prague, where he taught humanities, philosophy, theology, and scripture, was made rector of the imperial university, and guided for six years the Bohemian province of his order. Not only did Tanner burn to imitate the apostles and martyrs of the society, but, to awaken in his brethren a like desire, he employed his leisure hours in recounting to them the lives and deaths of the most prominent sons of St. Ignatius. His two works, Societas Jesu ad sanguinis et vitae profusionem militans (\\"A history of the lives and deaths of those Jesuits who suffered martyrdom for the faith\\") and Societas Jesu Apostolorum imitatrix (describing the heroic deeds and virtues of the Jesuits who laboured in all parts of the world with extraordinary success for the salvation of souls) were written in this spirit. He paid special attention to reverence and devotion during the holy sacrifice of the Mass. According to his biographer, he used to celebrate with such living piety that he was like a lodestone, attracting the faithful to the altar where he offered the sacrifice. To foster this reverence in others, he wrote two other works, Explanation of the Bloody Sacrifice of Christ in the Unbloody Sacrifice of the Mass, which was re-edited three times, and a pamphlet proclaiming God's wrath against those who should dare to desecrate holy temples by their misbehavior. His name became more widely known through his work, Dialogus controversisticus on the validity of the Holy orders conferred on Andrew Frommens during the lifetime of his wife. He died in Prague on February 8, 1692. ==References== Category:1630 births Category:1692 deaths Category:German Jesuits Category:People from Plzeň Category:German Bohemian people Category:German Catholics ","title":"Matthias Tanner"},{"id":"2578250","text":"An abdominal pregnancy can be regarded as a form of an ectopic pregnancy where the embryo or fetus is growing and developing outside the womb in the abdomen, but not in the Fallopian tube, ovary or broad ligament. Because tubal, ovarian and broad ligament pregnancies are as difficult to diagnose and treat as abdominal pregnancies, their exclusion from the most common definition of abdominal pregnancy has been debated. Others—in the minority—are of the view that abdominal pregnancy should be defined by a placenta implanted into the peritoneum. ==Signs and symptoms== Symptoms may include abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. As this is nonspecific in areas where ultrasound is not available the diagnosis was often only discovered during surgery to investigate the abnormal symptoms. They are typically diagnosed later in the developing world than the developed. In about half of cases from a center in the developing world the diagnosis was initially missed. It is a dangerous condition as there can be bleeding into the abdomen that results in low blood pressure and can be fatal. Other causes of death in people with an abdominal pregnancy include anemia, pulmonary embolus, coagulopathy, and infection. ==Risk factors== Risk factors are similar to tubal pregnancy with sexually transmitted disease playing a major role; however about half of those with ectopic pregnancy have no known risk factors (which include damage to the Fallopian tubes from previous surgery or from previous ectopic pregnancy, and tobacco smoking). ==Mechanism== Implantation sites can be anywhere in the abdomen but can include the peritoneum outside of the uterus, the rectouterine pouch (culdesac of Douglas), omentum, bowel and its mesentery, mesosalpinx, and the peritoneum of the pelvic wall and the abdominal wall. The growing placenta may be attached to several organs including tube and ovary. Rare other sites have been the liver and spleen, giving rise to a hepatic pregnancy or splenic pregnancy, respectively. Even an early diaphragmatic pregnancy has been described in a patient where an embryo began growing on the underside of the diaphragm. ===Primary versus secondary implantation=== A primary abdominal pregnancy refers to a pregnancy that first implanted directly in the peritoneum, save for the tubes and ovaries; such pregnancies are very rare, only 24 cases having been reported by 2007. Typically an abdominal pregnancy is a secondary implantation which means that it originated from a tubal (less common an ovarian) pregnancy and re-implanted. Other mechanisms for secondary abdominal pregnancy include uterine rupture, rupture of a uterine rudimentary horn and fimbrial abortion. ==Diagnosis== A person with an abdominal pregnancy may feel there is \\"something not right\\" or just display the normal signs of pregnancy or have non-specific symptoms such as abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. Suspicion of an abdominal pregnancy is raised when the fetal anatomy can be easily felt, or the lie is abnormal, the cervix is displaced, or there is failed induction of labor. X-rays can be used to aid diagnosis. Sonography can demonstrate that the pregnancy is outside an empty uterus, there is reduced to no amniotic fluid between the placenta and the fetus, no uterine wall surrounding the fetus, fetal parts are close to the abdominal wall, the fetus has an abnormal lie, the placenta looks abnormal and there is free fluid in the abdomen. MRI has also been used with success to diagnose abdominal pregnancy and plan for surgery. Elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels are another clue of the presence of an abdominal pregnancy. ===Ultrasound=== A 23-week abdominal pregnancy on ultrasound showing a normal fetus and amniotic fluid. Most cases can be diagnosed by ultrasound. The diagnosis however may be missed with ultrasound depending on the operator's skill. ===Criteria=== To diagnose the rare primary abdominal pregnancy, Studdiford's criteria need to be fulfilled: tubes and ovaries should be normal, there is no abnormal connection (fistula) between the uterus and the abdominal cavity, and the pregnancy is related solely to the peritoneal surface without signs that there was a tubal pregnancy first. Studdiford's criteria were refined in 1968 by Friedrich and Rankin to include microscopic findings. ===Differential diagnosis=== Depending on gestational age the differential diagnoses for abdominal pregnancy include miscarriage, intrauterine fetal death, placental abruption, an acute abdomen with an intrauterine pregnancy and a fibroid uterus with an intrauterine pregnancy . ==Treatment== Ideally the management of abdominal pregnancy should be done by a team that has medical personnel from multiple specialties. Potential treatments consist of surgery with termination of the pregnancy (removal of the fetus) via laparoscopy or laparotomy, use of methotrexate, embolization, and combinations of these. Sapuri and Klufio indicate that conservative treatment is also possible if the following criteria are met: 1. there are no major congenital malformations; 2. the fetus is alive; 3. there is continuous hospitalization in a well-equipped and well-staffed maternity unit which has immediate blood transfusion facilities; 4. there is careful monitoring of maternal and fetal well being; and 5. placental implantation is in the lower abdomen away from the liver and spleen. The choice is largely dictated by the clinical situation. Generally, treatment is indicated when the diagnosis is made; however, the situation of the advanced abdominal pregnancy is more complicated. ===Advanced abdominal pregnancy=== Advanced abdominal pregnancy refers to situations where the pregnancy continues past 20 weeks of gestation (versus early abdominal pregnancy < 20 weeks). In those situations, live births have been reported in the lay press where the babies are not uncommonly referred to as 'Miracle babies'.BBC News Health. \\"Doctors hail 'miracle' baby\\", BBC News, London, 10 September 1999. Retrieved on 11 November 2014.Jessica Salter. \\"'Miracle baby' who grew outside the womb\\", The Daily Telegraph, London, 31 August 2008. Retrieved on 11 November 2014. A patient may carry a dead fetus but will not go into labor. Over time, the fetus calcifies and becomes a lithopedion. It is generally recommended to perform a laparotomy when the diagnosis of an abdominal pregnancy is made. However, if the baby is alive and medical support systems are in place, careful watching could be considered to bring the baby to viability. Women with an abdominal pregnancy will not go into labor. Delivery in a case of an advanced abdominal pregnancy will have to be via laparotomy. The survival of the baby is reduced and high perinatal mortality rates between 40–95% have been reported. Babies of abdominal pregnancies are prone to birth defects due to compression in the absence of the uterine wall and the often reduced amount of amniotic fluid surrounding the unborn baby. The rate of malformations and deformations is estimated to be about 21%; typical deformations are facial and cranial asymmetries and joint abnormalities and the most common malformations are limb defects and central nervous malformations. Once the baby has been delivered placental management becomes an issue. In normal deliveries the contraction of uterus provides a powerful mechanism to control blood loss, however, in an abdominal pregnancy the placenta is located over tissue that cannot contract and attempts of its removal may lead to life-threatening blood loss. Thus blood transfusion is frequent in the management of patients with this kind of pregnancy, with others even using tranexamic acid and recombinant factor VIIa, which both minimize blood loss. Generally, unless the placenta can be easily tied off or removed, it may be preferable to leave it in place and allow for a natural regression. This process may take several months and can be monitored by clinical examination, checking human chorionic gonadotropin levels and by ultrasound scanning (in particular using doppler ultrasonography. Use of methotrexate to accelerate placental regression is controversial as the large amount of necrotic tissue is a potential site for infection, mifepristone has also be used to promote placental regression. Placental vessels have also been blocked by angiographic embolization. Complications of leaving the placenta can include residual bleeding, infection, bowel obstruction, pre-eclampsia (which may all necessitate further surgery) and failure to breast feed due to placental hormones. Outcome with abdominal pregnancy can be good for the baby and mother, Lampe described an abdominal pregnancy baby and her mother who were well more than 22 years after surgery. ==Epidemiology== About 1.4% of ectopic pregnancies are abdominal, or about 1 out of every 8,000 pregnancies. A report from Nigeria places the frequency in that country at 34 per 100,000 deliveries and a report from Zimbabwe, 11 per 100,000 deliveries. The maternal mortality rate is estimated to be about 5 per 1,000 cases, about seven times the rate for ectopics in general, and about 90 times the rate for a \\"normal\\" delivery (1987 US data). ==History== Al-Zahrawi (936–1013) is credited with first recognizing abdominal pregnancy which was apparently unknown to Greek and Roman physicians and was not mentioned in the writings of Hippocrates; Jacopo Berengario da Carpi (1460–1530) the Italian physician is credited with the first detailed anatomical description of abdominal pregnancy. ==Natural experiment== Because pregnancy is outside the uterus, abdominal pregnancy serves as a model of human male pregnancy or for females who lack a uterus, although such pregnancy would be dangerous.Meryl Rothstein. \\"Male Pregnancy: A Dangerous Proposition\\", Popular Science, Bonnier Corporation, 31 July 2005.

Abdominal pregnancy has served to further clarify the disease pre-eclampsia which was previously thought (1980's) to require a uterus for it to occur, however pre- eclampsia's occurrence in abdominal pregnancy (with the conceptus outside the uterus) helped throw light on pre-eclampsia's etiology.

There are a maximum of four participants per team. The event takes place over the course of two rounds. Each round, the teams receive a batch of puzzles and a logbook, each of which may be solved to a location on the Microsoft campus. By taking the logbook to that location, the team can find a unique rubber stamp with which they may stamp their logbook. The logbook is turned in and scored at the end of each round. Puzzles may be anything from traditional puzzles like crosswords, word searches, cryptograms, jigsaw puzzles, word play and logic problems to wandering around campus to find landmarks or puzzles that have to be solved on location. When arriving at a stamp location, the team may find information about a challenge event. Each year the distribution method for these challenge events change slightly. One common distribution method is a ticket at the stamp location which explains how to find the challenge event at another location. By taking a ticket from this location to the specified challenge event, the team may participate in the event for an opportunity to earn additional points. Some stamp locations also have additional information, either on what the stamp depicts or in a part of a puzzle at the stamp location. Collecting each part of a puzzle will allow the team to solve a meta-puzzle worth additional points. Each correctly solved and stamped puzzle from the current round is worth 10 points. First round puzzles solved in the second round are worth 5 points. Secret challenges are worth 20 points each, and meta-puzzles are worth 40 points each. In 2006, the value of meta-puzzles was reduced to 30 points each. In 2007, the value of meta-puzzles was further reduced to 25 points and the value of challenges was increased to 25 points. In 2008, the value of meta-puzzles was reduced to 20 points and challenges were returned to 20 points.

The tower is one of the major distinctive and recognizable features of the city and is named for the Gulf Oil Corporation, which was one of the leading multinational oil companies of its time, consistently ranking among the largest 10 corporations in the country. In 1984, Gulf and Chevron took part in the world's largest merger ($13.3 billion or $ billion today) to that time. Built as the headquarters for the Gulf Oil Company, and known as the Gulf Building, the structure was designed by the firm of Trowbridge & Livingston and completed in 1932 at a cost of $10.05 million ($ million today). As late as 1981 Gulf Oil employed 3,100 within the building. Now called Gulf Tower, it has 44 floors and rises above Downtown Pittsburgh. The crown of the skyscraper is modeled after the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus in the style of a step pyramid. The building was listed as a Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmark in 1973. On June 13, 1974, a bomb was detonated on the 29th floor of the Gulf Tower. The Weather Underground Organization took credit for the attack, claiming it was in protest to Gulf Oil's involvement in the oil rich regions affected by the Angolan War of Independence. ==Lighting== Prior to the late 1970s, the entire multistory \\"step-pyramid/mausoleum\\" structure at the top of the building was neon- illuminated, changing colors to provide a weather forecast that could be seen for many miles. This concept was developed by the building manager Edward H. Heath. He used the Gulf Oil colors to create a simplified forecast: steady blue meant colder and fair; flashing blue meant colder with precipitation; steady orange meant warmer and fair; flashing orange meant warmer with precipitation. Subsequently, in an effort to conserve energy, the weather forecasting role had been limited to the weather beacon at the pinnacle of the pyramid, which would glow blue for precipitation and red for fair weather. Although the terraced sides were once again illuminated at night (by means of spotlights), the entire pyramid structure no longer changed color with the weather (the pinnacle beacon still had that function). { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"font-size:100%;\\" + Original Weather Beacon -   Blue – steady – fair & colder temperature -   Blue – flashing – precipitation & colder temperature -   Orange red – steady – fair & rising temperature -   Orange red – flashing – precipitation & rising temperature } Since 2001, the opening of PNC Park across the Allegheny River, fans have noticed that after Pittsburgh Pirates home-runs, the \\"beam\\" light flashes in celebration. Recently it was revealed that the afternoon and evening receptionist at the lobby desk was the one responsible for this fan favorite, following the games on her cabinet radio. The slogan \\"Flash the beam, Regina – that one's out of here!\\" has gained popularity among Pirates fans recently. The KDKA Weather Beacon, the most recent weather beacon to adorn the pyramid atop the tower, was officially dedicated on July 4, 2012. In partnership with KDKA-TV, the Gulf Tower has been retrofit with a modern, automated LED weather beacon that will tell a more complete forecast than ever before. The Design concepts were created & implemented by the Design Team of Cindy Limauro and Christopher Popowich of C & C Lighting, LLC. A Pittsburgh based company. It will also feature holiday displays. Hearkening back to the original 1950's beacon, the entire pyramid will once again change colors at night depending on the current weather conditions.

A bomb planted by a Turkish usher at the consulate, who was later arrested and confessed, incited the events. The Turkish press, conveying the news in Turkey, was silent about the arrest and instead insinuated that Greeks had set off the bomb. A Turkish mob, most of whom had been trucked into the city in advance, assaulted Istanbul's Greek community for nine hours. Although the mob did not explicitly call for Greeks to be killed, over a dozen people died during or after the attacks as a result of beatings and arson. Armenians and Jews were also harmed. The police remained mostly ineffective, and the violence continued until the government declared martial law in İstanbul and called in the army to put down the riots. The pogrom greatly accelerated emigration of ethnic Greeks from Turkey, and the Istanbul region in particular. The Greek population of Turkey declined from 119,822 in 1927,http://www.demography- lab.prd.uth.gr/DDAoG/article/cont/ergasies/tsilenis.htm to about 7,000 in 1978.

A large indigenous Greek community continued to live in the multi-ethnic Ottoman capital city. The city's Greek population, particularly the Phanariotes, came to play a significant role in the social and economic life of the city and in the political and diplomatic life of the Islamic but multi-ethnic, multi-religious Ottoman Empire in general. This continued even after rebellions against Ottoman rule in Greece and the establishment of an independent Greek state in 1829, although during the Greek War of Independence massacres against local Greek communities occurred. A number of ethnic Armenians and Greeks, who served in the Ottoman Imperial diplomatic service and were even leading politicians in the 19th and early 20th century, were targeted. Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922), and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, the population exchange agreement signed between Greece and Turkey resulted in the uprooting of all Greeks in modern Turkey (and Turks in Greece) from where many of them had lived for centuries. But due to the Greeks' strong emotional attachment to their first capital as well as the importance of the Ecumenical Patriarchate for Greek and worldwide Orthodoxy, the Greek population of Istanbul was specifically exempted and allowed to stay in place. Nevertheless, this population began to decline, as evinced by demographic statistics. Punitive Turkish nationalist exclusivist measures, such as a 1932 parliamentary law, barred Greek citizens living in Turkey from a series of 30 trades and professions from tailoring and carpentry to medicine, law and real estate. The Varlık Vergisi tax imposed in 1942 also served to reduce the economic potential of Greek businesspeople in Turkey. ===Context=== In early 1950s, Turkey had close relations with Greece. In 1952, Paul of Greece became the first Greek Monarch to visit a Turkish head of state, which was soon followed by Turkish president Celal Bayar's visit to Greece. However, the relations soured starting in 1953, when the armed struggle of the Greek Cypriots, the majority of the island's population, aiming for political union of Cyprus with Greece, started. Soon after, Georgios Grivas formed the armed organization EOKA. This turn of events was politically exploited in Turkey by the Turkish nationalists of Kibris Türktür Cemiyeti (Cyprus is Turkish) organization, although EOKA had never targeted the Turkish Cypriot community before the anti-Greek pogrom events of September 1955. Greece appealed in 1954 to the United Nations to demand self-determination for Cyprus. Britain had the ruling mandate over the mostly ethnic Greek island, and wanted the Cyprus dispute to be resolved without being taken to the United Nations Security Council, where it could be problematically framed as an anti-colonialist struggle. To this end, Britain diplomatically encouraged Turkey to agitate Greece. The British ambassador to Greece also incited, saying in an August 1954 speech that Greco- Turkish ties were superficial, so nothing would be lost if, for example, something were to happen to Atatürk's house in Thessaloniki. More bluntly, an official of the Foreign Office said that some agitation would be much to Turkey's benefit. In any case, said parliamentarian John Strachey, Turkey had a large ethnic Greek minority in Istanbul as a card to play against Greece if it considered annexing an independent Cyprus to Greece. The concerns about the events in Cyprus led to the formation of a number of nationalist student and irredentist organizations in İstanbul, such as the National Federation of Turkish Students (), the National Union of Turkish Students, and Hikmet Bil's (editor of the major newspaper Hürriyet) \\"Cyprus is Turkish\\" Association (), who had protested against the Greek minority and the Ecumenical Patriarchate. In 1955, a propaganda campaign involving the Turkish press galvanized public opinion against the Greek minority, targeting Athenogoras, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, in particular, accusing him of collecting donations for Enosis. Leading the pack was Hürriyet, which wrote on 28 August 1955: \\"If the Greeks dare touch our brethren, then there are plenty of Greeks in Istanbul to retaliate upon.\\" Ömer Sami Coşar from Cumhuriyet wrote on 30 August: Tercüman, Yeni Sabah, and Gece Postası followed suit. The \\"Cyprus is Turkish\\" Association (CTA) stepped up activities in the weeks leading up to the riots, increasing the number of branches from three in August to ten by the time the attacks took place. On September 4, Hikmet Bil ordered students at Taksim Square, the heart of the city, to burn Greek newspapers. The same day, Kamil Önal of the CTA—and the National Security Service—handed out to students twenty thousands banners emblazoned \\"Cyprus is Turkish\\". The intercommunal violence in Cyprus prompted Turkey to transmit a diplomatic note to United Kingdom. United Kingdom then invited Turkey and Greece to a conference in London, which started on August 26. The day before the Tripartite London Conference (29 August–7 September 1955) began, Prime Minister Menderes claimed that Greek Cypriots were planning a massacre of Turkish Cypriots. Seeing the opportunity to extricate Britain, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan advised the Turkish delegates that they should be stern. Foreign minister Fatin Rüştü Zorlu paid heed to Macmillan and launched a harsh opening salvo, stating that Turkey would reconsider its commitment to the Treaty of Lausanne unless Greece reconsidered its position on Cyprus. The Greek delegates, surprised by harshness of the speech, blamed the British. Deflecting domestic attention to Cyprus was politically convenient for the Menderes government, which was suffering from an ailing economy. Although a minority, the Greek population played a prominent role in the city's business life, making it a convenient scapegoat during the economic crisis in the mid-50s which saw Turkey's economy contract (with an 11% GDP/capita decrease in 1954). The DP responded first with inflationary policies, then when that failed, with authoritarianism and populism. DP's policies also introduced rural-urban mobility, which exposed some of the rural population to the lifestyles of the urban minorities. The three chief destinations were the largest three cities: Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir. Between 1945 and 1955, the population of Istanbul increased from 1 million to about 1.6 million. Many of these new residents found themselves in shantytowns (), and constituted a prime target for populist policies. Finally, the conference fell apart on 6 September, the first day the subject of Cyprus would be broached at the conference, when news broke of the bombing of the Turkish consulate (and birthplace of Atatürk) in Greece's second-largest city, Thessaloniki. ==Pogrom events== Main targets of the Istanbul riots. ===Planning=== The 1961 Yassıada Trial after 1960 coup d'état accused Menderes and Foreign Minister Fatin Rüştü Zorlu of planning the riots. Though both of them rejected the claims, it is believed by scholars that Menderes assented to the organization of protests in İstanbul against the Greeks, but the extent of knowledge of Zorlu, who had been in London for the conference, is unclear. Interior Minister Namık Gedik was also accused of involvement, though he was not tried as he committed suicide before the trials started. According to Zorlu's lawyer at the Yassiada trial, a mob of 300,000 was marshaled in a radius of around the city for the attacks. The role of the National Security Service was not clarified at the trials, since the sole aim of the junta was to sentence the DP government.\\"400 kadına tecavüz edildi (400 women were raped)\\", Sabah newspaper, accessed: 2 January 2014 The trial revealed that the fuse for the consulate bomb was sent from Turkey to Thessaloniki on 3 September. During the Yassıada Trial it was claimed that a twenty-year-old university student named Oktay Engin was given the mission of installing the explosives, two sticks of gelignite, in the consulate's garden. The consul M. Ali Balin allegedly first pressured consulate employee Hasan Uçar, but Engin was brought in when Uçar resisted. Both of them were arrested after the attack. Engin was born in the Greek town of Komotini () to Faik Engin, a well-known parliamentarian in the late '40s and one of the three ethnic Turkish members of the Greek parliament between 1946-1950. Oktay Engin became one of the few ethnic Turkish students to graduate from Greek gymnasiums in those years. Turkish officials encouraged him to study law, offering him a scholarship, so that he could promote the interests of Turkish citizens in Greece. He thus entered Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 1953. When he was in his second year, he was accused of incitement in the bombing incident. Engin said that he had been followed by Greek intelligence agents so closely from the start of his university education, that he could name one (\\"Triondafilos\\"). In his 2005 book, Speros Vryonis documents the direct role of the Demokrat Parti organization and government-controlled trade unions in amassing the rioters that swept Istanbul. Ten of Istanbul's 18 branches of the \\"Cyprus is Turkish\\" Association were run by DP officials. This organization played a crucial role in inciting anti-Greek activities. Most of the rioters came from western Asia Minor. His case study of Eskişehir shows how the party there recruited 400 to 500 workers from local factories, who were carted by train with third class-tickets to Istanbul. These recruits were promised the equivalent of 6 USD, which was never paid. They were accompanied by Eskişehir police, who were charged with coordinating the destruction and looting once the contingent was broken up into groups of 20–30 men, and the leaders of the party branches.Dilek Güven, Cumhuriyet Dönemi Azınlık Politikaları Bağlamında 6-7 Eylül Olayları, quoted in While the DP took the blame for the events, it was revealed in 2005 that the riots were in actuality a product of the Turkey's Tactical Mobilization Group; a clandestine special forces unit. Four star general Sabri Yirmibeşoğlu, the right-hand man of General Kemal Yamak who led the Turkish outpost of Operation Gladio under the Tactical Mobilization Group (), proudly reminisced about his involvement in the riots, calling them \\"a magnificent organization\\". Before the events in September 6th, some buildings owned by Greeks and other non-Muslim minorities were marked with cross signs in order to make the arson easier,.\\"55 Yıl Sonra 6-7 Eylül Olayları\\" http://bianet.org/bianet/biamag/124591-55-yil-sonra-6-7-eylul-olaylari\\"Utanç Günü\\" ===Execution=== Municipal and government trucks were placed in strategic points all around the city to distribute the tools of destruction (shovels, pickaxes, crowbars, ramrods and petrol), while 4,000 taxis were requisitioned from the Drivers Association and Motor Vehicle Workers' Trade Union () to transport the perpetrators. In addition, flags had been prepared by the Textile Workers' Union (). A protest rally on the night of 6 September, organised by the authorities in Istanbul, on the Cyprus issue and the bombing of Atatürk's home was the cover for amassing the rioters. At 13:00, news reports of the bombing were announced by radio. However, most people at the time did not have radios, so they had to wait until 16:30, when the daily İstanbul Ekspres, which was associated with the DP and the National Security Service (NSS), repeated the news in print. According to a September 2005 episode of the weekly show Files on the Greek Mega Channel, the accompanying photographs were seen by Salonican photographer Yannis Kyriakidis on September 4 (two days before the actual bombing). The consul's wife had brought the film to the photo studio that belonged to Kyriakidis' father to be printed. The photographs were then photomontaged, according to the program. On the day of the event, the editor, Gökşin Sipahioğlu, called the owner, Mithat Perin, asking for permission for a second run. The weather was bad, so Perin declined thinking the prints would not get sold. The newspaper's main dealer, Fuat Büke, soon called and offered to pay for the run in advance. By the time Perin went to inspect the Tan Press, 180,000 copies had already been printed. Sensing something fishy, Perin tore up the paper and stopped the run. The prototype was still intact however, and the workers secretly resumed printing after Perin left. They had eventually printed 300,000 copies (on paper stocked in advance), of which 296,000 were sold. This was far above the newspaper's average circulation of 30,000–40,000 (by comparison, the best-selling Hürriyet sold 70–80 thousand copies). Perin was arrested the next day. Gökşin Sipahioğlu later alleged the NSS had pressured him to do it, while Perin says Sipahioğlu himself was an agent. Perin's innocence, however, was cast into doubt after intrepid journalist Uğur Mumcu published an excerpt from a 1962 letter between Perin and the undersecretary of the NSS, Fuat Doğu, stating that in his 25 years of journalism, he had acted in full knowledge of the NSS and had not refrained from doing anything. At 17:00, the riots started in Taksim Square, and rippled out during the evening through the old suburb of Beyoğlu (Pera), with smashing and looting of Greek commercial property, particularly along Yüksek Kaldırım street. By six o'clock at night, many of the Greek shops on Istanbul's main shopping street, İstiklal Avenue, were ransacked. Many commercial streets were littered with merchandise and fittings torn out of Greek-owned businesses. According to the eyewitness account of a Greek dentist, the mob chanted \\"Death to the Giaours\\" (non-Turks), \\"Massacre the Greek traitors\\", \\"Down with Europe\\" and \\"Onward to Athens and Thessaloniki\\" as they attacked.\\"Rumlara Ölüm Sloganı\\"http://bianet.org/biamag/biamag/101612-annem-sag-cikamayacagiz-diyordu Predictably, the situation came soon out of control and the mobs were shouting \\"First your property. Then your life\\". The riot died down by midnight with the intervention of the Turkish Army and declaration of martial law. The police, which supported the attacks by preparing and organizing the operations, was ordered to hold a passive stance and leave the mob to roam the streets of the city freely and commit atrocities against the civilian population. The Turkish militia and police that coordinated the attacks refrained from protecting the lives and properties of the victims. Their function was instead to preserve adjacent Turkish properties. However, there were a few cases where police officers prevented criminal activity. On the other hand, the fire brigade, whenever it reached a fire, claimed that it was unable to deal with it. ===Related violence=== According to most sources, between 13 and 16 Greeks and one Armenian (including two clerics) died as a result of the pogrom. However, a number of deaths were never recorded due to the general chaos, so estimates vary. An early source gives the number of dead as 0,\\"A crisis struck at the end of 1955 as political and economic restlessness culminated in the riots of September 6 in Istanbul and Izmir (ostensibly induced by the issue of Cyprus) and a subsequent political shake-up. Contributing reasons for the violence: (1) use of the Greek Orthodox Church as a political instrument by the Greek government, thus sparking latent Moslem-Christian hostilities (which were laid on top of latent Greek-Turkish national hostility); (2) the presence in Istanbul of a large, floating, unemployed, male population of village origin which sought economic gain from looting; (3) popular identification of certain Istanbul merchants of Greek ethnic extraction with hoarding, speculation, and unsavory wealth; (4) deliberate stimulation and organization of the crowds to violent ends by an unknown group. (Communists? Doubtful, none were arrested. Opposition politicians? Equally doubtful; even the government made no such charge. Prime Minister Menderes? Doubtful; the riot ran contrary to every conceivable interest of his, A group of second echelon Democrats seeking to unseat Menderes? Somewhat more likely; an effort within the party was made in December. Religious and racial fanatics? Equally likely. Possibly a combination of the last two constituted the guilty parties. In such event, criminal convictions may have been avoided because those guilty were too closely identified with the Prime Minister. An outstanding feature of the Istanbul riot: no one was killed.) In July 1961, both Menderes and Bayar were found guilty by a revolutionary tribunal of inciting the 1955 riot, but the evidence was not impressive. What was proved was that the government had planned a popular demonstration to support its position in Cyprus. A critic of the Menderes regime commented to the author in 1962 \\"It is now almost generally agreed that these riots were planned, organized, and started by Democratic leaders and local bosses, but developed into far beyond the original plan and intention.\\" It seems to me most likely that the demonstration was deliberately incited to unintended violence by other parties, the identity of whom still remains undisclosed. Local authorities, knowing of the government-sponsored demonstration, apparently did not know how to respond to the violence during the first few destructive hours. But was no evidence to prove that Menderes deliberately planned the type of mass violence that in fact erupted.\\", Richard D. Robinson, The First Turkish Republic: a case study in national development, Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 157. but later sources and witness accounts do not affirm this. According to a number of other sources the total death toll is estimated to be at least 30. Apart from the thirty identified victims, an additional of three unidentified bodies were found inside the shops, while three burned bodies were found in a sack in the region of Besiktas. Moreover, 32 Greeks were severely wounded. Men and women were raped and islamized by force, and according to accounts including those of the Turkish writer Aziz Nesin, men, including a priest, were subjected to forced circumcision by members of the mob. Moreover, an Armenian rite Christian priest died after the procedure. Priests were also scalped and burnt in their beds and Greek women raped. Nesin wrote: ===Material damage and cost=== The material damage was considerable, with damage to 5317 properties, almost all Greek-owned. Among these were 4214 homes, 1004 businesses, 73 churches, 26 schools, two monasteries, and a synagogue. Over 4,000 Greek-owned businesses, over 1,000 Greek-owned homes, 110 hotels, 73 Greek (and other Christian) churches, 27 pharmacies, 23 schools, and 21 factories were badly damaged or destroyed. The American consulate estimates that 59% of the businesses were Greek-owned, 17% were Armenian-owned, 12% were Jewish-owned, and 10% were Muslim-owned; while 80% of the homes were Greek-owned, 9% were Armenian-owned, 3% were Jewish-owned, and 5% were Muslim-owned. Estimates of the economic cost of the damage vary from Turkish government's estimate of 69.5 million Turkish lira (equivalent to 24.8 million US$Turkish currency exchange rates 1923–1990 ), a British estimate of 100 million GBP (about 200 million US$), the World Council of Churches' estimate of 150 million USD, and the Greek government's estimate of 500 million USD. The Turkish government paid 60 million Turkish lira of restitution to those who registered their losses. ====Church property==== Representatives of the World Council of Churches investigating the vandalized sarcophaguses of the deceased Ecumenical Patriarchs, in the Patriarchal cemetery in Balıklı. In addition to commercial targets, the mob clearly targeted property owned or administered by the Greek Orthodox Church. 73 churches and 23 schools were vandalized, burned or destroyed, as were eight baptisteries and three monasteries, about 90 percent of the church property portfolio in the city. The ancient Byzantine church of Panagia in Belgradkapı was vandalised and burned down. The church at Yedikule was badly vandalised, as was the church of St. Constantine of Psammathos. At Zoodochos Pege church in Balıklı, the tombs of a number of ecumenical patriarchs were smashed open and desecrated. The abbot of the monastery, Bishop Gerasimos of Pamphilos, was severely beaten during the pogrom and died from his wounds some days later in Balıklı Hospital. In one church arson attack, Father Chrysanthos Mandas was burned alive. The Metropolitan of Liloupolis, Gennadios, was badly beaten and went mad. Elsewhere in the city, the Greek cemetery of Şişli, as well as the cemetery of the Patriarchates in Balıklı were targeted. Crosses and statues were vandalized, while sepulchers and burial vaults were opened and the remains of the dead were removed and dispersed by the fanatic mobs. At Balıklı cemetery, the sarcophaguses of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchs were desecrated. ===Witnesses=== An eyewitness account was provided by journalist Noel Barber of the London Daily Mail on 14 September 1955: On the occasion of the pogrom's 50th anniversary, a seventy-year-old Mehmet Ali Zeren said, \\"I was in the street that day and I remember very clearly...In a jewelry store, one guy had a hammer and he was breaking pearls one by one.\\" One famous eyewitness was James Bond novelist Ian Fleming, who as an MI6 agent was present under the cover of the International Police Conference on 5 September (which he ditched in favour of covering the riots for The Sunday Times). Fleming's account was published on 11 September, bearing the title \\"The Great Riot of Istanbul\\". It has been said that Fleming may have been tipped off by Nâzim Kalkavan, the Istanbul station chief of the MI6, who appears in 1957's From Russia, with Love as \\"Darko Kerim\\". According to Fleming's biographer, John Pearson, Kalkavan was rather like Kerim bey. A number of Turkish eyewitness accounts were published in 2008 by Ayşe Hür in an article that appeared in Taraf. ===Resistance=== There are accounts of protection offered to the minorities by their fellow citizens that were successful in fending off the mob. The most organized team rallied behind air force captain Reşat Mater. Mater happened to be off duty and visiting his home in Cevizli's Muhasebeciler Street, which was right next to the rally point, İstanbul Caddesi. Mater first hid some of his neighbors in his house, then he took to the street with his gun and his uniform. The boys in the neighborhood joined him, bringing domestic implements as substitute weapons. The mob passed by after seeing the barricade. Mater later rose all the way to Commander of the Air Force, making him third in the military line of command. His son Tayfun, who witnessed the pogrom, maintains ties with those who survived and fled to Greece. ===Secondary action=== While the pogrom was predominantly an Istanbul affair, there were some outrages in other Turkish cities. On the morning of 7 September 1955 In İzmir, a mob overran the İzmir National Park, where an international exhibition was taking place, and burned the Greek pavilion. Moving next to the Church of Saint Fotini, built two years earlier to serve the needs of the NATO Regional Headquarters' Greek officers, the mob destroyed it completely. The homes of the few Greek families and officers were then looted. ===Documentation=== Considerable contemporary documentation showing the extent of the destruction is provided by the photographs taken by Demetrios Kaloumenos, then official photographer of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Setting off just hours after the pogrom began, Kaloumenos set out with his camera to capture the damage and smuggled the film to Greece. Famous Turkish photojournalist of Armenian descent, Ara Güler, also took many photographs during the pogrom.Ara Guler Istanbul Pogromhttp://www.tercumaniahval.com/foto-muhabiri-ara-guler/ ==Reactions== ===In Greece=== In Greece, Oktay Engin and consulate employee Hasan Uçar were arrested on 18 September. Engin was first charged with executing the attack, but he presented an alibi so the charge was dropped to incitement. He was detained for nine months. Three months later, he escaped to Turkey before the Greek courts sentenced him to 3.5 years. In addition, Turkey refused Greece's extradition request. ===In Turkey=== After the events, 3,151 people were immediately arrested, the number of arrested later rose to 5,104. On 7 September, the Menderes government closed the \\"Cyprus is Turkish\\" Association (CTA) and arrested its executives. 34 trade unions were dissolved. The Minister of Internal Affairs Namık Gedik resigned on 10 September. The investigation initially focused on the \\"Cyprus is Turkish\\" Association (CTA). CTA detainee, and spy, named Kamil Önal had one of his CTA associates burn an intelligence report originating from the National Security Service (NSS) that was at the CTA office. In addition, a member from the Kızıltoprak branch, Serafim Sağlamel, was found to be carrying an address list of non-Muslim citizens. However, on September 12, the government blamed Turkish Communists for the pogrom, arresting 45 \\"card-carrying communists\\" (including Aziz Nesin, Kemal Tahir, and İlhan Berktay). This type of \\"false flag\\" anti-Communist propaganda was a staple of the Counter-Guerrilla. When opposition leader İsmet İnönü delivered a speech criticizing the government for rounding up innocent people instead of the actual perpetrators, the communists were released in December 1955. An angry Menderes said that İnönü would not be forgiven for his speech, pardoning the communists. 87 CTA leaders were released in December 1955, while 17 were taken to court on 12 February 1956. The indictment initially blamed the CTA only for inciting some students to burn Greek newspapers in Taksim Square. In response to police chief Kemal Aygün's question about the Cominform's role in the affair, Şevki Mutlugil of the NSS cooked up a report, which concluded that the Comintern and Cominform had conspired to sabotage NATO. As proof, the prosecution submitted some brochures from the Communist Party of Turkey and a pair of letters from Nâzım Hikmet which called on the workers of Cyprus to stand against imperialism. To bolster the claims, the indictment claimed that NSS agent Kamil Önal had contacted the Comintern while on duty in Lebanon and defected, effectively exonerating the NSS. The remaining prisoners were released on 12 January 1957 for lack of evidence, by order of the Istanbul First Penal Court (). ===International=== The chargé d'affaires at the British Embassy in Ankara, Michael Stewart, directly implicated Menderes' Demokrat Parti in the execution of the attack. \\"There is fairly reliable evidence that local Demokrat Parti representatives were among the leaders of the rioting in various parts of Istanbul, notably in the Marmara islands, and it has been argued that only the Demokrat Parti had the political organisation in the country capable of demonstrations on the scale that occurred,\\" he reported, refusing to assign blame to the party as a whole or Menderes personally, however. The Foreign Office pointedly underscored the fact that British citizens were also victims of the attack. Although British ambassador to Ankara, Bowker, advised British Foreign Secretary Harold Macmillan that the United Kingdom should \\"court a sharp rebuff by admonishing Turkey\\", only a note of distinctly mild disapproval was dispatched to Menderes.Holland, Robert. \\"[https://books.google.com/books?id=HI4nxW6ffCEC&pg;=PA76 The Struggle for Mastery, 4 October 1955–9 March 1956],\\" Britain and the Revolt in Cyprus, 1954–59, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998, pp. 75–77. The context of the Cold War led Britain and the U.S. to absolve the Menderes government of direct political blame. The efforts of Greece to internationalize the human rights violations through international organizations such as the UN and NATO found little sympathy. British NATO representative Cheetham deemed it \\"undesirable\\" to probe the pogrom. U.S. representative Edwin M. Martin thought the effect on the alliance was exaggerated, and the French, Belgians and Norwegians urged the Greeks to \\"let bygones be bygones\\". By popular vote, the Cyprus issue was dropped from the U.N. agenda on 23 September 1955. Britain had successfully avoided a potential diplomatic embarrassment. ==Aftermath== ===Compensation payments=== The compensation package allocated by the Turkish Assembly was only 60 million Turkish liras. While 12.7 million Turkish liras were given to churches for compensation out of 39 million Turkish liras claimed for damages, the rest of the 60 million Turkish liras was distributed among applicants. ===Anti-Greek policy and Greek exodus=== Greek population in Istanbul and percentages of the city population (1844-1997). The Turkish policies, after 1923, led virtually to the elimination of the Greek community. Tensions continued, and in 1958–1959, Turkish nationalist students embarked on a campaign encouraging a boycott against all Greek businesses. The task was completed eight years later in 1964 when the Ankara government reneged on the 1930 Greco-Turkish Ankara Convention, which established the right of Greek établis (Greeks who were born and lived in Istanbul but held Greek citizenship) to live and work in Turkey. As a result of tensions over the Cyprus issue, Turkey prohibited all commercial dealings by Greeks holding a Greek passport resulting in the deportation from Turkey of around 40,000 ethnic Greeks.Bahar Rumelili Ph.D., \\"The European Union and Cultural Change in Greek-Turkish Relations\\" p16 They were allowed to take with them only 20 kg of their belongings and cash of 22 dollars. Moreover, the property they left was confiscated by the Turkish state ten years later. As a result of these policies, the Greek community of Istanbul shrank from 80,000 (or 100,000 by some accounts) persons in 1955 to only 48,000 in 1965. Today, the Greek community numbers about 2,500, mostly older individuals. ===Georgian exodus=== The Georgian community in Istanbul was also affected. It is estimated that there were about 10,000 Catholic Georgian residents in Istanbul in 1955. Most of the Georgians emigrated to Australia, Canada, Europe and the United States following the pogrom. As of 1994, there were only about 200 Catholic Georgians and a handful of Jewish Georgian families left in Istanbul. ===Trials in Turkey=== After the military coup of 1960, Menderes and Zorlu were charged at the Yassiada Trial in 1960–61 with violating the constitution. The trial also made reference to the pogrom, for which they were blamed. The accused were denied fundamental rights regarding their defence, and they were found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. ===Later careers of press people involved=== The editor of the Istanbul Ekspres, Gökşin Sipahioğlu, went on to found Sipa Press; an international photo agency based in France. The owner, Mithat Perin, already a DP member, became a parliamentarian. ===2005 exhibition assault=== In 2005, Turkish nationalists attacked a photography exhibition dedicated to the fiftieth anniversary of the 1955 riots held in İstanbul. The exhibition itself was initially heralded as a major step forward for the development of democratic values in preparation of Turkey's admittance into the European Union. The military prosecutor at the time of the riots, vice admiral Fahri Çoker, kept documents and approximately 250 photographs of the events in order to educate posterity. He entrusted them to the Turkish Historical Society, stipulating that they be exhibited 25 years after his death. Two hours prior the opening of the exhibition, a nationalist lawyer and former president of Ülkü Ocakları Ramazan Kirik, Kemal Kerinçsiz, inspected the gallery and angrily walked out. Upon the opening of the exhibition, two people stood in front of the venue shouting and announcing that this exhibition was a misrepresentation of reality and that it wasn't considerate towards the sufferings of the Turkish people. Moments later, a 20–30 militant nationalist mob that belonged to the Ülkücüler nationalist organization raided and defaced the exhibitVick, Karl. \\"In Turkey, a Clash of Nationalism and History\\", Washington Post, 30 September 2005. by hurling eggs at the photographs and trampling over them.\\"Attack Video\\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=towG9RF9R7o&t;=2m39s Some of the photographs were thrown outside windows only to be stamped upon by other raiders. The raiders also distributed pamphlets and flyers that said, \\"Turkey is Turkish, will remain Turkish,\\" \\"death to traitors,\\" \\"love it or leave it,\\" \\"Cyprus is Turkish and will remain Turkish,\\" \\"why not the pictures from Cyprus but these,\\" and \\"don't defend those who set fire to Atatürk's house.\\" The raid was led by Kerinçsiz and nationalist lawyer Levent Temiz who have been taken into custody in 2008 for their suspected connection with Ergenekon. The assault was described by Feyyaz Yaman, the director of the gallery, as a repeat of the 1955 rioting in itself. The President of the Turkish Historical Society Orhan Silier condemned the attacks and stated that such acts of this event \\"will affect Turkey's image abroad.\\" He also mentioned that \\"These protests show that groups based on the same violent methods, fear and paranoia, still exist.\\" The incident was shown in Screamers, a 2006 documentary film about the Armenian Genocide. ===Oktay Engin's later career=== Oktay Engin continued his studies at Istanbul University's Faculty of Law. His school in Thessaloniki refused to share his transcript, but with only a certificate showing he had completed the first year, the university senate allowed Engin to continue from the second. After graduation, he started an internship in Cyprus. However, he was summoned by Orhan Öztırak, the minister of internal affairs, to monitor Greek radio stations. Next he placed first in a government exam that led to his becoming the governor (kaymakam) of the most important district, Çankaya. One year later, the chief of the police force, Hayrettin Nakipoğlu, invited him to be the chair of the Political Affairs Branch (). Under normal conditions, reaching such a position would require 15–20 years of work, starting from his position as a district governor. He remained in the police force thereafter, working his way up to the chief of the security department, and the deputy chief of the entire police force. Finally, in 1991 he was promoted to the governorship of Nevşehir Province. Engin rejects all allegations of culpability —indeed, of even being a spy or an acquaintance of General Yirmibeşoğlu. ==International legacy== In August 1995, the US Senate passed a special resolution marking the September 1955 pogrom, calling on the President of the United States Bill Clinton to proclaim 6 September as a Day of Memory for the victims of the pogrom. ==Current anti-Greek tendencies in Turkey== At present (2013), popular Turkish TV shows are alleged to portray the Greek people in a negative way. This resulted in complaints by representatives of the local Greek communities, since similar tendencies triggered the outbreak of anti-Greek pogroms and massive expulsions during the 1950s and 1960s. ==See also== * Anti-Greek sentiment * 1918 Toronto anti-Greek riot * Greek Town riot * Racism and discrimination in Turkey * Varlik Vergisi * Great Fire of 1660 * Greeks in Turkey * Turkish nationalism * Demographics of Istanbul ==References== ==Further reading== * Alexandris, Alexis.

Hedjkheperre Setepenre Smendes was the founder of the Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt and succeeded to the throne after burying Ramesses XI in Lower Egypt - territory which he controlled. His Egyptian nomen or birth name was actually NesbanebdjedNesbanebdjed meaning \\"He of the Ram, Lord of Mendes\\", but it was translated into Greek as Smendes by later classical writers such as Josephus and Sextus Africanus. According to the Story of Wenamun from , Smendes was a governor of Lower Egypt during the Era of the Renaissance under the reign of Ramesses XI, however, Egyptologists have questioned the historical accuracy of that story. ==Family== Smendes may have been a son of a lady named Hrere. Hrere was a Chief of the Harem of Amun-Re and likely the wife of a high priest of Amun. If Hrere was Smendes' mother, then he was a brother of Nodjmet and through her brother-in-law of the High Priests Herihor and Piankh. Smendes was married to Tentamun B, likely a daughter of Ramesses IX. They may have been the parents of his successor Amenemnisu.Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson (2004) , pp. 196-209 ==Report of Wenamun== Smendes features prominently in the Report of Wenamun. This story is set in an anonymous \\"Year 5\\", generally taken to be year 5 of the so-called Renaissance of Pharaoh Ramesses XI, the tenth and last ruler of the Twentieth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt (1190–1077 BC). However, since Karl Jansen-Winkeln has proposed to reverse the order of the High Priests of Amun Herihor and Piankh, this ascription has become disputed.Karl Jansen-Winkeln, \\"Das Ende des Neuen Reiches\\", Zeitschrift für ägyptische Sprache, 119 (1992), pp.22-37 With the pontificate of Herihor falling later than that of Piankh, who is attested in year 7 of the Renaissance,Nims, Journal of Near Eastern Studies, 7 (1948), 157-162 the date in the heading of Wenamun should rather refer to the successor of Ramesses XI. Following Jansen-Winkeln, Arno Egberts (1991) therefore argues that the story is set in the fifth regnal year of Smendes. Recently, Ad ThijsAd Thijs, The Burial of Psusennes I and “The Bad Times” of P. Brooklyn 16.205, Zeitschrift für ägyptische Sprache, 96 (2014), 209–223 has alternatively ascribed the text to year 5 of king Khakheperre Pinuzem, who is the successor of Ramesses XI in his chronology, which is also based on the reversal of High Priests put forward by Jansen-Winkeln. As the story begins, the principal character, Wenamun, a priest of Amun at Karnak, is sent by the High Priest of Amun Herihor to the Phoenician city of Byblos to acquire lumber (probably cedar wood) to build a new ship to transport the cult image of Amun. Wenamun first visits Smendes at Tanis and personally presented his letters of accreditation to Smendes in order to receive the latter's permission to travel north to modern Lebanon. Smendes responds by dispatching a ship for Wenamun's travels to Syria and the Levant. Smendes appears as a person of the highest importance in Tanis. ==Reign== Detail of the Banishment Stela, which bears the highest known regnal date (25 years) of Smendes. Louvre, C 256 Smendes' nominal authority over Upper Egypt is attested by a single inscribed stela found in a quarry at Ed-Dibabiya, opposite Gebelein on the right bank of the Nile, as well as by a separate graffito inscription on an enclosure Wall of the Temple of Monthu at Karnak, the Temple that was originally constructed during the reign of Thutmose III.J. Cerny, \\"Egypt from the Death of Ramesses III to the End of the Twenty-First Dynasty\\" in The Middle East and the Aegean Region c. 1380-1000 BC, Cambridge University Press, p. 645 The quarry stela describes how Smendes \\"while residing in Memphis, heard of danger to the temple of Luxor from flooding, gave orders for repairs (hence the quarry works), and received news of the success of the mission.\\"K.A. Kitchen, The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100-650 BC), 3rd ed. (Warminster: Aris & Phillips, 1996), p. 256 Smendes is assigned a reign of 26 Years by Manetho in his Epitome.Manetho, fragments 58 & 59; translation in W.G. Waddell, Manetho (Cambridge: Harvard University, 1997), pp. 155-7 This figure is supported by the Year 25 date on the Banishment Stela which recounts that the High Priest Menkheperre suppressed a local revolt in Thebes in Year 25 of a king who can only be Smendes because there is no evidence that the High Priests counted their own regnal years even when they assumed royal titles like Pinedjem I did.Kitchen, p. 260 Menkheperre then exiled the leaders of the rebellion to the Western Desert Oases. These individuals were pardoned several years later during the reign of Smendes' successor, Amenemnisu. Smendes ruled over a divided Egypt and only effectively controlled Lower Egypt during his reign while Middle and Upper Egypt was effectively under the suzerainty of the High Priests of Amun such as Pinedjem I, Masaharta, and Menkheperre. His prenomen or throne name Hedjkheperre Setepenre/Setepenamun—which means 'Bright is the Manifestation of Rê, Chosen of Rê/Amun'—became very popular in the following 22nd Dynasty and 23rd Dynasty. In all, five kings: Shoshenq I, Shoshenq IV, Takelot I, Takelot II and Harsiese A adopted it for their own use. On the death of Smendes in 1052 BC, he was succeeded by Neferkare Amenemnisu, who may have been this king's son. ==References== ==Further reading== *G.

Atropisomers are stereoisomers arising because of hindered rotation about a single bond, where energy differences due to steric strain or other contributors create a barrier to rotation that is high enough to allow for isolation of individual conformers.Anslyn and Dougherty, Modern Physical Organic Chemistry, University Science Books, 2006, ==Etymology and history== The word atropisomer (Gr., άτροπος, atropos, meaning \\"without turn\\") was coined in application to a theoretical concept by German biochemist Richard Kuhn for Karl Freudenberg's seminal Stereochemie volume in 1933. Atropisomerism was first experimentally detected in a tetra substituted biphenyl, a diacid, by George Christie and James Kenner in 1922. Michinori Ōki further refined the definition of atropisomers taking into account the temperature-dependence associated with the interconversion of conformers, specifying that atropisomers interconvert with a half-life of at least 1000 seconds at a given temperature, corresponding to an energy barrier of 93 kJ mol−1 (22 kcal mol −1) at 300 K (27 °C).Ōki, Michinori (1983) Recent Advances in Atropisomerism, in Topics in Stereochemistry, Vol. 14 (N. L. Allinger, E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen, Eds.), Hoboken, NJ:John Wiley & Sons, pp. 1-82; published online in 2007, , see and , accessed 12 June 2014. ==Energetics== The stability of individual atropisomers is conferred by the repulsive interactions that inhibit rotation. Both the steric bulk and, in principle, the length and rigidity of the bond connecting the two subunits contribute. Commonly, atropisomerism is studied by dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, since atropisomerism is a form of fluxionality.Inferences from theory and results of reaction outcomes and yields also contribute. Atropisomers exhibit axial chirality (planar chirality). When the barrier to racemization is high, as illustrated by the BINAP ligands, the phenomenon becomes of practical value in asymmetric synthesis. == Stereochemical assignment == Determining stereochemistry in atropisomers where substituent A has priority over substituent B Determining the axial stereochemistry of biaryl atropisomers can be accomplished through the use of a Newman projection along the axis of hindered rotation. The ortho, and in some cases meta substituents are first assigned priority based on Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules. One scheme of nomenclature in based on envisioning the helicity defined by these groups. Starting with the substituent of highest priority in the closest ring and moving along the shortest path to the substituent of highest priority in the other ring, the absolute configuration is assigned P or Δ for clockwise and M or Λ for counterclockwise. Alternately, all four groups can be ranked by Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules, with overall priority given to the groups on the \\"front\\" atom of the Newman projection. The two configurations are termed Ra and Sa in analogy to the traditional R/S for a traditional tetrahedral stereocenter. == Synthesis == Two examples of atropisomer synthesis Axially chiral biaryl compounds are prepared by coupling reactions, e.g., Ullmann coupling, Suzuki–Miyaura reaction, or palladium-catalyzed arylation of arenes. Subsequent to the synthesis, the racemic biaryl is resolved by classical methods. Diastereoselective coupling can be achieved through the use of a chiral bridge that links the two aryl groups or through the use of a chiral auxiliary at one of the positions proximal to axial bridge. Enantioselective coupling can be achieved through the use of a chiral leaving group on one of the biaryls or under oxidative conditions that utilize chiral amines to set the axial configuration. Individual atropisomers can be isolated by seed-directed crystallization of racemates. Thus, 1,1'-binaphthyl crystallizes from the melt as individual enantiomers. == Scope == Relaying Asymmetry of Transient Atropisomers Structures of BINAP, BINOL, QUINAP Example of use of P,N ligand for asymmetric catalysis In one application the asymmetry in an atropisomer is transferred in a chemical reaction to a new stereocenter. The atropisomer is an iodoaryl compound synthesised starting from (S)-valine and exists as the (M,S) isomer and the (P,S) isomer. The interconversion barrier between the two is 24.3 kcal/mol (101.7 kJ/mol). The (M,S) isomer can be obtained exclusively from this mixture by recrystallisation from hexanes. The iodine group is homolytically removed to form an aryl radical by a tributyltin hydride/triethylboron/oxygen mixture as in the Barton–McCombie reaction. Although the hindered rotation is now removed in the aryl radical, the intramolecular reaction with the alkene is so much faster than is rotation of the carbon–nitrogen bond that the stereochemistry is preserved. In this way the (M,S) isomer yields the (S,S) dihydroindolone. The most important class of atropisomers are biaryls such as diphenic acid, which is a derivative of biphenyl with a complete set of ortho substituents. Heteroaromatic analogues of the biphenyl compounds also exist, where hindered rotation occurs about a carbon-nitrogen or a nitrogen-nitrogen bond. Others are dimers of naphthalene derivatives such as 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol. In a similar way, aliphatic ring systems like cyclohexanes linked through a single bond may display atropisomerism provided that bulky substituents are present. The use of axially chiral biaryl compounds such as BINAP, QUINAP and BINOL, have been found to be useful in the area of asymmetric catalysis as chiral ligands. Their ability to provide stereoinduction has led to use in metal catalyzed hydrogenation, epoxidation, addition, and allylic alkylation reactions. Other reactions that can be catalyzed by the use of chiral biaryl compounds are the Grignard reaction, Ullmann reaction, and the Suzuki reaction. A recent example in the area of chiral biaryl asymmetric catalysis employs a five-membered imidazole as part of the atropisomer scaffold. This specific phosphorus, nitrogen-ligand has been shown to perform enantioselective A3-coupling. == Natural products, drug design == Many atropisomers occur in nature, and some have applications to drug design. The natural product Mastigophorene A has been found to aid in nerve growth. Other examples of naturally occurring atropisomers include vancomycin isolated from an Actinobacterium, and knipholone, which is found in the roots of Kniphofia foliosa of the family Asphodelaceae. The structure complexity in vancomycin is significant because it can bind with peptides due to the complexity of its stereochemistry, which includes multiple stereocenters, two chiral planes in its stereogenic biaryl axis. Knipholone, with its axial chirality, occurs in nature and has been shown to offer good antimalarial and antitumor activities particularly in the M form. The use of atropisomeric drugs provides an additional way for drugs to have stereochemical variations and specificity in design. One example is (–)-N-acetylallocolchinol, a drug that was discovered to aid in chemotherapy cancer treatment. Telenzepine is atropisomeric in the conformation of its central thienobenzodiazepine ring. The two enantiomers have been resolved, and it was found that the (+)-isomer which is about 500-fold more active than the (–)-isomer at muscarinic receptors in rat cerebral cortex. However, drug design is not always aided by atropisomerism. In some cases, making drugs from atropisomers is challenging because isomers may interconvert faster than expected. Atropisomers also might interact differently in the body, and as with other types of stereoisomers, it is important to examine these properties before administering drugs to patients. ==See also== *Dihedral angle ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Stereochemistry ","title":"Atropisomer"},{"id":"2578376","text":"Uakti (WAHK-chee) was a Brazilian instrumental musical group that was composed of Marco Antônio Guimarães, Artur Andrés Ribeiro, Paulo Sérgio Santos, and Décio Ramos. Uakti was known for using custom-made instruments, built by the group itself. ==The name== The name of the group comes from a Tucano native South American legend. Uakti was a mythological being who lived on the banks of the Rio Negro. His body was full of holes, which, when the wind passed through them, produced sounds that bewitched the women of the tribe. The men hunted down Uakti and killed him. Palm trees sprouted up in the place where his body was buried, and the people used these to make flutes that made enchanting sounds like those produced by the body of Uakti. ==History== The group's leader, Marco Antônio Guimarães, studied music at the Universidade Federal da Bahia in Salvador. There he met and took classes with Walter Smetak, who passed on to him his passion for constructing musical instruments. In the years following his training, Marco Antônio played cello with the São Paulo and Minas Gerais symphony orchestras. During the same period he constructed, in the basement of his house, various instruments out of PVC, wood, and metal. In order to have musicians to play these instruments, in 1978 Guimarães had the idea of bringing together some of his colleagues from the Orquestra Sinfônica de Belo Horizonte, to meet at the Foundation for Artistic Education of Belo Horizonte. Various musicians took part; among them were the percussionists Paulo Sérgio Santos and Décio de Souza Ramos, the flutist Artur Andrés Ribeiro, and the cellist Cláudio Luz do Val. These musicians learned how to play the instruments, and the group Uakti was formed. Marco Antônio Guimarães became the principal composer and arranger, although all the participants frequently contributed their own compositions. The group's first recording was of their participation in the soundtrack of the 1979 film Cabaré Mineiro. The score was composed by Tavinho Moura. Through Tavinho, Uakti made contact with musicians in the Clube da Esquina movement. In 1980 they played on Milton Nascimento's album Sentinela and made their first public performance at the museum in Pampulha. Their first album, Uakti - Oficina Instrumental, appeared the following year, as a consequence of the popularity they had acquired through their performances with Nascimento. With the departure of the cellist Cláudio Luz, the guitarist Bento Menezes joined the group, staying until 1984, when they recorded their third album, Tudo e Todas as Coisas. Starting with this album, they began to use traditional instruments less and less frequently. In the period between 1981 and 1987 they established themselves in Brazil and took part in another recording by Milton Nascimento, Ânima. Their first international tour took place in Spain. In 1987 they took part in the album Brazil with the US jazz vocal group The Manhattan Transfer. During a show in the United States, singer and songwriter Paul Simon got to know their music, and invited them to play on his 1989 album The Rhythm of the Saints. During this recording, US composer Philip Glass, who was in Brazil, went to visit Simon and heard Uakti play. This resulted in a contract to record five albums with his Point Music label. The fifth album, MAPA, released in 1992, was a homage to the music of Marco Antonio Pena Araújo, a friend of the members of the group who had died in 1986 (the name MAPA is an acronym of the letters in his name). The international recognition that the group gained resulted in much more work: Uakti travelled to Japan and various countries in Europe. Grupo Corpo, the acclaimed Minas Gerais dance theatre group, commissioned several original compositions by Marco Antônio Guimarães: A lenda, recorded on MAPA, Bach, which he released as a solo effort, and I Ching and 21 which became Uakti albums in 1994 and 1997, respectively. In 1993 Philip Glass was also commissioned by Grupo Corpo to produce a composition for a ballet. Glass then chose Uakti to perform his composition, Águas da Amazônia - Sete ou oito peças para um balé. The arrangement was done by Marco Antônio Guimarães, who adapted the work to Uakti's instruments; this was the first time that Glass's music was arranged by another composer. The recording of this music was released in 1999, under the contract with Point Music. In 2004 Glass invited Uakti to collaborate again, this time on the Orion project. The city of Athens, as part of the 2004 pre-Olympic celebrations, commissioned Glass to do a series of open-air shows. Uakti took part, playing Glass's compositions. In 1994 Uakti joined Stewart Copeland as he headlined an international tour, \\"Stewart Copeland and the Rhythmatists\\", in support of an album and video based on Stewart's experience in Africa. The tour roster featured Stewart Copeland performing with a diverse group of international musicians including: Percussion de Guinnea, a leading drum group from Africa; Vinx, who recently toured with Sting; and Ray Lema, an original performer on the Rhythmatist album and video. Starting in 1998, Uakti recorded fewer original compositions and concentrated on adaptations of classical music and of Brazilian popular songs. The soundtrack of the 1998 film Kenoma, by Eliana Caffé, used mostly compositions by Heitor Villa-Lobos. In 2000 they recorded an album of popular songs with the choral group Tabinha, from Minas Gerais. In 2002, they released the CD Clássicos, containing solely classical arrangements, and in 2005 they explored popular Brazilian themes in the CD Oiapok XUI,The title Oiapok XUI is a play on the phrase \\"From Oiapoque to Chui\\" meaning \\"in the entire country, from north to south\\", because Oiapoque is the northernmost city in Brazil and Chuí is in the extreme south. which, in addition to various popular Brazilian dance themes, contained four variations of Tom Jobim's Águas de Março. Uakti frequently took part in projects with other artists. Besides the already-mentioned Milton Nascimento, Paul Simon and Manhattan Transfer, they worked with Ney Matogrosso, Maria Bethânia, and Zélia Duncan. They also performed in the show Dança das Marés, directed by Ivaldo Bertazzo, Ihú - Todos os Sons, which presented indigenous themes collected and adapted by Marlui Miranda. Their recording \\"Trilobita\\" was used in the closing credits of the Rush in Rio DVD. ==Instruments== The original instruments constructed by Marco Antônio Guimarães are responsible for the group's sound. The list below describes some of these instruments. ===Pans=== All of these follow the same basic principle: PVC tubes of various lengths, assembled so that their ends are aligned. The tubes are struck with a rubber mallet or with the hands. Since each length of tubing produces a different note, these instruments are tuned and can play melodies or chords. Currently, they are used in two sizes: the large pan of bent tubing that allows a larger length and is used as a bass, and the shorter inclined pan, used for principal melodies. ===Marimbas=== These are idiophones consisting of keys struck with mallets with heads made of rubber or felt. They are played like a xylophone or vibraphone. The difference between Uakti's marimbas and these instruments is that the keys are located above two independent sound boxes that can be inverted or moved. This allows the playing of chords or sequences that would be quite difficult using the traditional design. Uakti uses two kinds of marimbas: *Marimba d'Angelim - made of wood used in everyday construction, or Angelim which gives it a rustic sound, since this wood possesses differences in density that produce a different timbre than normal xylophones. *Glass marimba - the keys are made of glass, which produce notes of greater resonance than those made of wood. ===String instruments with bows=== Played by Marco Antônio Guimarães in recordings, they are, in general, inspired by the cello or the viol. *Iarra - A type of cello, with two sets of strings that can be pressed simultaneously with the left hand. A bow is used to play the string. *Chori Smetano - an instrument created by Walter Smetak. Basically it is a string instrument with a sound box for a head. According to its inventor, this instrument can simultaneously create opposing feelings, such as crying and laughing. This is the origin of the name \\"cho-ri\\" (\\"choro\\"=\\"crying\\", \\"riso\\"=\\"laughing\\" in Portuguese). Guimarães built his chori with the arm and bow length of the cello, so that any cellist can play it. *Torre (Tower) - A large PVC tube with a double bass ridge at one end and a handle at the other. Strings are stretched along the sides of the tube. Two musicians are needed to play it. One turns the tube on its axis with the handle. The other uses a bow composed of two rods, and a horsehair viola bow to rub the strings. Since the bow can play several strings at once, it can play chords. Changing the velocity and quantity of notes with the bow gives rise to harmonic variations. It is one of the most astonishing instruments to see in live performances because of the rich harmonics produced and the unusual method of playing. It is normally used as a harmonic base. ===Drums=== The membranophones are also an important part of Uakti's sound, principally the trilobyte, formed out of 10 tuned PVC tubes arranged on a frame, with drum skins over the top ends. Two musicians position themselves facing each other, holding the instrument between them, and use their fingers, drum sticks, or the palms of their hands to strike the skins, producing quite rapid melodies. ===Traditional instruments=== The group also uses some traditional instruments. They use various types of drums such as atabaques and floor toms, and also tablas, traditional (Asian) Indian drums. Occasionally they use string instruments such as the violin or piano, though they usually play them using drum sticks and other alternative techniques. Flutes, played by Artur Andrés Ribeiro, are possibly the traditional instruments most used by the group. They can also be played with a Chinese mouthpiece, a common flute mouthpiece with a membrane that vibrates with the passage of air (somewhat resembling a kazoo), making the flute sound something like a reed instrument. ==References== This article draws heavily on the corresponding article in the Portuguese-language Wikipedia, which was accessed in the version of August 18, 2006. ==Notes== ==Discography== *Uakti - Oficina Instrumental (1981) *Uakti 2 (1982) *Tudo e Todas as Coisas (1984) *Mapa (1989) *I Ching (1993) *21 (1996) *Trilobyte (1997) *Águas da Amazônia (1999) (music by Philip Glass) *Mulungu do Cerrado (2001) (with Tabinha) *Clássicos (2003) *Uakti (DVD, 2003) *Oiapok Xui (2005) *Blindness - Soundtrack (2008) *Beatles (2012) ==External links== * Official page - History, news, and photos of instruments and group members. *Discography Category:Brazilian musical groups Category:Musical groups from Belo Horizonte Category:Percussion ensembles Category:Musical groups established in 1979 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2015 Category:Musical quartets Category:Brazilian percussionists ","title":"Uakti (band)"},{"id":"2578386","text":"The Farmacotherapeutisch Kompas (FK) contains a wide spectrum of information on prescribing and pharmacology, among others indications, side effects and costs of the prescription of all medication drugs available in the Netherlands.

The name is a combination of Old English (cace-, catch) and medieval Latin (pullus, a chick). It derives from the image that people who owed tax were as difficult to catch as farmyard hens.World Wide Words: Issue 825: 30 March 2013, 'Catchpole' The Catchpole name is from Dorset, Southern England. At that time, tax-gathering was contracted out, a system called tax farming. The catchpole paid a lump sum to be authorised to collect taxes from a given area or population, and was then able to keep whatever he could extract, using almost any method he came up with. Later, the duties of the 'catchpole' were those of a legal official, working for the bailiff.

The current (and fourth) station building opened in 2019. Pasila station is used to ease the congestion on the city's central station by serving as an alternate point of departure or arrival within Helsinki.

Pasila station is one of two stations in Helsinki to serve long- distance traffic, the other being the central station. All other stations in Helsinki only serve local traffic. In terms of train lines, the only differences between Pasila station and the central station are the smaller number of tracks with platforms (10 compared to 19). In 2012, the loading and unloading of cars onto trains was moved from Helsinki Central to a new car terminal built north of Pasila.

There is a borough council ward bearing the name 'Pilgrims Hatch' which covers the Bishops Hall and Flower estates (the urban area north of the A12 road) and a small rural area to the north up to Ashwells Road and Days Lane. Pilgrims Hatch usually elects Liberal Democrat councillors. It has a population of around 6,000 people. 'Pilgrims Hatch' literally means Pilgrim's Gate (with 'hatch' being derived from the Old English form of haecc)http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/ins/ - Institute for Name Studies and, until recently, local schools used a large farmer's gate as a symbol of the area. While no longer common it is still the semi-official symbol of the village. One of the local schools that still has the \\"gate\\" incorporated within their school badge is Larchwood Primary School. The name derived from 12th century Thomas Becket pilgrimages to Canterbury through Brentwood, a popular stopping place at the time, before travelling onto Tilbury for the ferry. Pilgrims from the Midlands would pass through Pilgrims Hatch en route to Brentwood.Brentwood Gazette newspaper, 17 September 2008, page 31 At this time Pilgrims Hatch was not recognised as a community as such, having only a few properties in an area which was mainly open countryside and not settled in any numbers until the 20th century. The Chapman & André map of 1777 references 'Pilgrims Hatch Common' and shows limited development along what was to become the modern Ongar Road near the junction with Coxtie Green Road (Cox Green then). The main development of Pilgrims Hatch as a village occurred after World War II.Brentwood - A History by Jennifer Ward - pages 2 & 54 & inside cover for map Although population development may have been quite late, Pilgrims Hatch was home to a critical part of early communications infrastructure with Cable & Wireless having a substantial telegraph radio receiving station built on the junction of Hatch Road and Doddinghurst Road in 1921.Brentwood - A History by Jennifer Ward - page 116 (with the associated transmitting station in nearby North Weald)http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/modern/marconi/marconi.html During World War II this site was considered sufficiently important in the war effort that substantial air defences were also constructed around it. Although some buildings from the site remained early into the 21st century it has now been transfomed into housing developments and an extension to Bishops Hall Park. The Brentwood Centre is situated on the edge of Pilgrims Hatch, and is the centre of sport, leisure, and musical events within the borough. There is an annual festival held at the centre, as well as a traditional fireworks display on or close to Guy Fawkes Night each year. The area relies mainly on Brentwood's high street stores and supermarkets, but does have a number of local shops and businesses. It also is well served by local restaurants, takeaways and pubs. ==References== Category:Borough of Brentwood Category:Villages in Essex ","title":"Pilgrims Hatch"},{"id":"2578420","text":"George H.

As one extended work of literature, the Cycle treats historical topics from the American settlement of the Great Plains and the displacement of the Native American cultures there. Each poem is written as enjambed heroic couplets in several chapters. As Neihardt gained experience with the form, he began to close chapters, and often verse paragraphs, in the middle of a line, with the first line of the next chapter completing both the suspended line and rhyme. The effect is to pull the speaker forward until the only completely resolved couplet is the one at the end of the Song. By internal chronological order, the five songs are (with the date of first) *The Song of Three Friends (1919) *The Song of Hugh Glass (1915) *The Song of Jed Smith (1941) *The Song of the Indian Wars (1925) *The Song of the Messiah (1935) ==The Song of Three Friends== This poem comprises eight cantos. The story begins in 1822—and follows an expedition of Major Andrew Henry during a series of arduous journeys over the Trans-Missouri region: following the Grand, Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers. The poem examines the exploits of three trappers—Will Carpenter, Mike Fink, and Frank Talbeau—who through shared experiences have developed a close friendship. But the bonds of friendship uniting the trio explode after Will succeeds in wooing the Indian girl who had stolen Mike's heart. Mike's jealously leads to murder: the remaining cantos complete the narrative, in which only one of the original three will survive to tell the tale. ==The Song of Hugh Glass== This poem comprises five cantos. The story begins in 1823—just after the Leavenworth campaign against the Arikara Indians—and follows an expedition of Major Andrew Henry during a series of arduous journeys over the Trans-Missouri region. The poem describes the friendship that springs up between two trappers—an older man named Hugh Glass, and a younger named Jamie—who fight, scout and hunt together in the wilds. The story is set when Jamie and a companion betray Hugh: Hugh is abandoned—alive, and badly wounded—to die by the Missouri; to allow Jamie and his companion to safely flee the enmity of hostile Indians in the vicinity. Jamie and his fellow cover their cowardice with a specious lie: that they left only after Hugh died of natural causes, whereupon they first buried him before riding north to rejoin the trapping-party. But against all odds - Hugh survives. Regaining consciousness and finding himself alone, Hugh shrewdly deduces the identity of those who betrayed him. Then—fired by a relentless hate to punish those who left him to die—Hugh claws his painful way back to the land of the living: but only to set out to track down his betrayers and deal out some requisite summary justice. This story is also told in the 2015 film The Revenant and the 1971 film Man in the Wilderness. ==Notes== ==External links== *The Song of Three Friends at the Internet Archive. *The Song of Hugh Glass at the Internet Archive. * Category:American poems Category:Epic poems in English Category:Poetry by John Neihardt ","title":"Cycle of the West"},{"id":"2578445","text":"Gateway House, Manchester (1969).

Charters can bestow certain rights on a town, city, university, or other institution. Colonial charters were empowered when the king gave a grant of exclusive powers for the governance of land to proprietors or a settlement company. The charters defined the relationship of the colony to the mother country as free from involvement from the Crown. For the trading companies, charters vested the powers of government in the company in England. The officers would determine the administration, laws, and ordinances for the colony but only as conforming to the laws of England. Proprietary charters gave governing authority to the proprietor, who determined the form of government, chose the officers, and made laws subject to the advice and consent of the freemen. All colonial charters guaranteed to the colonists the vague rights and privileges of Englishmen, which would later cause trouble during the Revolutionary Era. In the second half of the 17th century, the Crown looked upon charters as obstacles to colonial control and substituted the royal province for corporations and proprietary governments. ==History== The Virginia and Massachusetts charters were given to business corporations. Regular meetings of company officers and stockholders were the only governmental institutions required. The Virginia charter, issued in 1606, and revised in 1609 and 1612, was revoked upon bankruptcy of the sponsoring and organizing Virginia Company of London in 1624. The second Colonial Charter was granted to Massachusetts Bay in 1629, settling at Boston and Salem, a decade after the first \\"New Englanders\\" at Plymouth Colony further south towards Cape Cod. In 1684, the Chancery Court in England voided the charter and changed it to a royal colony. Charles II placed Massachusetts under the authority of the unified Dominion of New England in 1685. After William III and Mary II had ascended to the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland, in addition to the stewardship of the Dutch Republic, they issued Massachusetts Bay a new liberal charter in 1691. Charles II granted Connecticut its charter in 1662 with the right of self-government. When James II ascended the throne in 1685, he tried to revoke the Connecticut charter and sent Sir Edmund Andros to receive it for the Crown. Captain Joseph Wadsworth spirited the precious document out a window and stole the charter and hid it in a hollow oak tree, the \\"Charter Oak,\\" until James was overthrown. Connecticut temporarily lost the right of self-government under the unification of the several colonies into the Dominion of New England in 1687 until it was reinstated 1689. The last charter by Charles II was issued to Rhode Island in 1663. Connecticut and Rhode Island attained colonial charters as already established colonies that allowed them to elect their own governors. As a result of political upheavals, especially after the three English Civil Wars in the 1640s, and the later \\"Glorious Revolution\\" of 1688 with their Roman Catholic-Protestant/Anglican conflicts, which also transformed into struggles between the King and Parliament. As the conflicts traveled across the Atlantic Ocean, most colonies eventually surrendered their charters to the Crown by 1763 and became royal colonies, as the King and his Ministers asserted more centralized control of their previously-neglected and autonomous Thirteen Colonies. By the late 1600s, the colonial Maryland had its Proprietary Charter to the Lords Baltimore revoked and had become a royal colony with its Governor of Maryland, appointed by the Monarch, with the advice of his Ministers and the Colonial Offices and Board of Trade of members from Parliament. By 1776, when the Pennsylvania and its lower Delaware Bay counties remained proprietary colonies under a charter originally granted to William Penn and his heirs. The Province of Connecticut and the Province of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations continued as corporation colonies under charters, and Massachusetts was governed as a royal province that operated under a charter after the unifying of the older \\"Massachusetts Bay\\" colony at Boston and the \\"first landing\\" colony, Plymouth Colony at Plymouth, Massachusetts, with its famous \\"Mayflower Compact\\" from 1620. Further south, the Provinces of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia to the undefined border with Spanish Florida, all had their original charters dismissed with different opinions about the role and powers and taxing authority between the royal governors and their increasingly-restless and defiant colonial Assemblies. Royal authority reasserted itself and becoming governed more directly from London with increasing friction as the 18th century progressed to its revolutionary climax. ==See also== *Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies *Colonial history of the United States *Proprietary colony *State constitution (United States) ==References== * The Avalon Project: Colonial Charters, Grants, and Related Documents Bibliography * Bridenbaugh, Carl.

Having made 109 appearances for them, with loan deals at Bury and Wigan Athletic along the way, he was released on a free transfer to Stockport County for the beginning of the 1998–99 season, and quickly arrived at Burnley in January 1999, signed by the colourful manager Stan Ternent, following a falling-out with then Stockport manager, Gary Megson. Once described by Ternent as a Premiership-standard player, his inability to hold down a regular position either as a left-winger, left-sided or central defender, or striker, saw him never play there. He played more than 200 games for the club. His unpopularity with some supporters was balanced with him becoming something of a cult figure, earning him regular chants of \\"Graham di Branchio,\\" (in reference to the football chant given to Italian footballer Paolo Di Canio), in an effort to boost his confidence and let his more prominent abilities such as pace and height come to the fore. Branch's contract was set to expire at the end of the 2004–05 season before he earned a one-year extension in April 2005. The 2005–06 season held even more promise for the player after his hard work and commitment paid off after he was offered a new one-year extension to his current deal. Although he only scored two goals he played a large role in many victories due to his skill and crossing abilities. The 2006–07 was widely expected to be his last with Burnley and he spent it as a little-used substitute or squad player. However, the season was dedicated as an entire testimonial season for him, culminating on 7 May 2007, when 1,809 fans turned out at Turf Moor to say goodbye to him. In his testimonial, the current Burnley side played a 'Branch XI'. Although no official announcement had been made by that stage, Branch's departure had been confirmed by Steve Cotterill in interviews leading up to this testimonial match. His departure was confirmed on 8 May 2007. In March 2010 he was forced to retire from football after suffering a serious eye injury whilst playing for Colwyn Bay. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Liverpool Category:English footballers Category:Tranmere Rovers F.C. players Category:Bury F.C. players Category:Wigan Athletic F.C. players Category:Stockport County F.C. players Category:Burnley F.C. players Category:Accrington Stanley F.C. players Category:Cammell Laird 1907 F.C. players Category:Colwyn Bay F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Association football midfielders Category:Association football defenders ","title":"Graham Branch"},{"id":"2578478","text":"Remixed is the third album released by the classical crossover string quartet Bond. ==Track listing== ===Japanese edition=== #\\"Victory\\" (Sharp Boys wild string edit) #\\"Viva!\\" (Orion mix) #\\"Wintersun\\" (Bobby D' Ambrosio mix) #\\"Speed\\" (Crash club mix – radio edit) #\\"Fuego\\" (Caliente mix) #\\"Homecoming\\" #\\"Viva!\\" (!Del underground mix) #\\"Atlanta\\" #\\"Shine\\" (Dubshakra mix) #\\"Time\\" #\\"Bond On Bond\\"¹ (Hectic mix) #\\"Duel\\" (Indonesian mix) #\\"Jingle Bell Rock\\" #\\"Innocent\\" ===US edition=== #\\"Viva!\\" (Orion mix) #\\"Victory\\" (Sharp Boys wild string edit) #\\"Wintersun\\" (Bobby D' Ambrosio mix) #\\"Speed\\" (Crash club mix – radio edit) #\\"Fuego\\" (Caliente mix) #\\"Homecoming\\" #\\"Atlanta\\" #\\"Shine\\" (Dubshakra mix) #\\"Time\\" #\\"Duel\\" (Hectic mix) #\\"Bond On Bond\\" (Hectic mix)¹ #\\"Jingle Bell Rock\\" (Pussy Galore mix) ¹Adapted from the \\"James Bond Theme\\" Category:Bond (band) albums Category:2003 remix albums Category:Decca Records remix albums ","title":"Bond Remixed"},{"id":"2578490","text":"The Brodsky Quartet is a British string quartet, formed in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, in 1972 as the \\"Cleveland Quartet.\\" Only Ian Belton and Jacqueline Thomas remain as original members.

It is bound by 34th St. E. on the south, 38th Ave. S. on the west, 27th St. E. on the north, and the Mississippi River Gorge to the east. Bordering neighborhoods are Seward to the north, Longfellow to the west, and Howe to the south. St. Paul's Merriam Park neighborhood is just across the Mississippi River to the east. Cooper was named after the 19th-century author James Fenimore Cooper, best known for writing The Last of the Mohicans (1832). == Geography == The Mississippi River Gorge is unique to this stretch of the entire Mississippi. The river cut an eighty-plus foot gorge as what is now St. Anthony Falls moved upstream over thousands of years, finally stopping at downtown Minneapolis due to engineering work during the city's flour milling boom times. Today, the Mississippi River Gorge is a protected natural landscape. == Schools == 2005 marked the closing of Cooper Elementary School, forcing Cooper's children to move to the neighboring Longfellow Elementary,Longfellow Elementary which itself closed in 2010. The current elementary school for Cooperites is the Hiawatha-Howe dual campus. Minneapolis Public Schools has committed to renovating and re-opening Cooper's school for the 2017-18 school year.

Endothelin constricts blood vessels and raises blood pressure. The endothelins are normally kept in balance by other mechanisms, but when overexpressed, they contribute to high blood pressure (hypertension), heart disease, and potentially other diseases. Endothelins are 21-amino acid vasoconstricting peptides produced primarily in the endothelium having a key role in vascular homeostasis. Endothelins are implicated in vascular diseases of several organ systems, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain. As of 2018, endothelins remain under extensive basic and clinical research to define their roles in several organ systems. ==Etymology== Endothelins derived the name from their isolation in cultured endothelial cells. == Isoforms == There are three isoforms of the peptide (identified as ET-1, -2, -3), each encoded by a separate gene, with varying regions of expression and binding to at least four known endothelin receptors, ETA, ETB1, ETB2 and ETC. The human genes for endothelin-1 (ET-1), endothelin-2 (ET-2), and endothelin-3 (ET-3) are located on chromosomes 6, 1, and 20, respectively. == Mechanism of action and function == Endothelin functions through activation of two G protein-coupled receptors, endothelinA and endothelinB receptor (ETA and ETB, respectively). These two subtypes of endothelin receptor are distinguished in the laboratory by the order of their affinity for the three endothelin peptides: the ETA receptor is selective for ET-1, whereas the ETB receptor has the same affinity for all three ET peptides. The two types of ET receptor are distributed across diverse cells and organs, but with different levels of expression and activity, indicating a multiple-organ ET system. Endothelin-1 is the most powerful endogenous chemical affecting vascular tone across organ systems. Secretion of endothelin-1 from the vascular endothelium signals vasoconstriction and influences local cellular growth and survival. ET-1 has been implicated in the development and progression of several cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and hypertension. Endothelin also has roles in mitogenesis, cell survival, angiogenesis, bone growth, nociceptor function, and cancer onset mechanisms. Clinically, anti-ET drugs are used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension. ==Physiological effects== Endothelins are the most potent vasoconstrictors known. Overproduction of endothelin in the lungs may cause pulmonary hypertension, which was treatable in preliminary research by bosentan, sitaxentan or ambrisentan. Endothelins have involvement in cardiovascular function, fluid-electrolyte homeostasis, and neuronal mechanisms across diverse cell types. Endothelin receptors are present in the three pituitary lobes which display increased metabolic activity when exposed to ET-1 in the blood or ventricular system. ET-1 contributes to the vascular dysfunction associated with cardiovascular disease, particularly atherosclerosis and hypertension. The ETA receptor for ET-1 is primarily located on vascular smooth muscle cells, mediating vasoconstriction, whereas the ETB receptor for ET-1 is primarily located on endothelial cells, causing vasodilation due to nitric oxide release. The binding of platelets to the endothelial cell receptor LOX-1 causes a release of endothelin, which induces endothelial dysfunction. == Clinical significance == The ubiquitous distribution of endothelin peptides and receptors implicates involvement in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes among different organ systems. Among numerous diseases potentially occurring from endothelin dysregulation are: * several types of cancer * cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage * arterial hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, and other cardiovascular disorders * pain mediation *cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure *Dengue haemorrhagic fever *Type II diabetes *some cases of Hirschsprung disease In insulin resistance the high levels of blood insulin results in increased production and activity of ET-1, which promotes vasoconstriction and elevates blood pressure. ET-1 impairs glucose uptake in the skeletal muscles of insulin resistant subjects, thereby worsening insulin resistance. In preliminary research, injection of endothelin-1 into a lateral cerebral ventricle was shown to potently stimulate glucose metabolism in specified interconnected circuits of the brain, and to induce convulsions, indicating its potential for diverse neural effects in conditions such as epilepsy. Receptors for endothelin-1 exist in brain neurons, indicating a potential role in neural functions. ==Antagonists== Earliest antagonists discovered for ETA were BQ123, and for ETB, BQ788. An ETA-selective antagonist, ambrisentan was approved for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in 2007, followed by a more selective ETA antagonist, sitaxentan, which was later withdrawn due to potentially lethal effects in the liver. Bosentan was a precursor to macitentan, which was approved in 2013. == References == == External links == * Category:Peptide hormones Category:Hormones of the blood vessels ","title":"Endothelin"},{"id":"2578538","text":"The Tinkerer (Phineas Mason) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, usually as an adversary of the superhero Spider-Man. Created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, he made his first appearance in The Amazing Spider-Man #2 (May 1963), and is generally depicted as a genius in engineering, who is able to create gadgets from nothing more than spare parts left over from ordinary household appliances. When not trying to eliminate Spider-Man himself, the Tinkerer is usually under the employ of other supervillains, whom he supplies with his gadgets for their personal vendettas against Spider-Man or other heroes. The character has made several appearances in media outside of comics, including television and video games. The Tinkerer made his cinematic debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), portrayed by Michael Chernus. ==Publication history== The Tinkerer is a character that was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, as part of the original publication of The Amazing Spider-Man and made his first initial appearance in April 1963 in The Amazing Spider-Man #2 opposing Spider-Man as a villain. It would, however, be several years before he would return, and in September 1976 in The Amazing Spider-Man #160 made his second appearance, once again opposing Spider-Man in a losing effort. In July 1978, the Tinkerer would be mentioned in The Amazing Spider-Man #182. This became his first mention in the publication as a supporting side character to the other villains. ==Fictional character biography== Phineas Mason is a brilliant inventor and technician who designs advanced weaponry for criminals and sometimes undertakes crimes of his own. As the \\"Terrible Tinkerer\\", he runs an underground fix-it shop disguised as a radio repair shop. On at least one occasion, a potential customer gained the inventor's attention by presenting a transistor radio and telling Mason that \\"I've got a radio that just can't carry a tune\\". Tinkerer's original scheme involved the employment of a team of petty has-been stuntmen and thugs. They specialized in placing bugs into radios and blackmailing state officials and politicians. Tinkerer tried to present himself as an alien to confuse his pursuers by leaving behind a mask that looked like his face when he escaped from Spider-Man in a hovercraft shaped like a flying saucer.The Amazing Spider-Man #2. Marvel Comics. The Tinkerer's next encounter with Spider-Man resulted in deploying the Toy, a hi-tech robot that serves as an assistant and lackey.The Amazing Spider-Man #159 The Toy also helped Tinkerer escape from his hideout when raided by the police.The Amazing Spider-Man #160. Marvel Comics. Tinkerer is known to have created the suit for Mysterio, a man that once worked as one of his alien-suited servants.The Spectacular Spider-Man #51 Much later, he was hired by the Kingpin to rebuild the Spider-Mobile to destroy Spider- Man.Amazing Spider-Man #160.

He has worked for Hammerhead,Fantastic Four #233 the Beetle (Abner Jenkins),Deadly Foes of Spider-Man #1 the Black Cat,The Amazing Spider-Man #369-370 the Jack O'Lantern, Owl, the Ani-Men, Jester, and the Constrictor. Since he is a small business operator who works alone (and arms criminals), the Terrible Tinkerer takes precautions to prevent being cheated. For instance, Killer Shrike commissioned Tinkerer to improve weapon gauntlets. At delivery time, the criminal decided to use the weapons to threaten the inventor and avoid paying. The gauntlets backfired on Killer Shrike, wounding and immobilizing due to a failsafe Tinkerer engineers into his products for such situations.The Amazing Spider-Man #310. Marvel Comics. Phineas is forced to work for the Vulture (Adrian Toomes) interested in freeing Nitro from custody. This falls apart when the heroic mutants Rusty Collins and Skids chance upon the situation and defeat the villains. Tinkerer is arrested off-panel.New Mutants #86 (February 1990). Marvel Comics. Trapster later sued Tinkerer for selling faulty equipment. Trapster's character witnesses in the case against Tinkerer include Beetle, Blacklash, Blizzard, Boomerang, Jack O'Lantern, Mad Thinker, Porcupine, Ringer, Stilt-Man, Spymaster and Taskmaster. When Taskmaster accuses the other villains of not properly using the equipment that Tinkerer provided, it resulted in an in-court brawl that was broken up by She-Hulk which leads to the villains getting arrested. When Tinkerer and Mad Thinker ask She-Hulk who is superior, She-Hulk says to sort it out themselves and storms off.Sensational She-Hulk #59 (January 1994). Marvel Comics. His son Rick Mason is a world-class mercenary for the American government and freelance operative. Despite the two being on opposite sides of the law, father and son remained on good terms and met frequently. Tinkerer even aided his son from time to time, and once provided Rick with information about a coup in South America.The Agent Graphic Novel After Rick was seemingly killed in action, the grief-stricken father decided to mend his ways while still maintaining links to supervillains to give information he could discreetly pass along. In the Secret War miniseries, Nick Fury discovered a link between the weaponry of most of the known technology-based villains in the Marvel Universe and the kingdom of Latveria. Tinkerer was revealed to have received a vast portion of his funding and presumably the resources and technology from which he has developed most of his clients' arsenals over the years from Latveria. This was part of an ongoing \\"terrorist\\" initiative fostered by the kingdom's despotic leader Doctor Doom and minion Countess Luciana Von Bardas. S.H.I.E.L.D. agents discovered Tinkerer's workshop by using Killer Shrike as a mole. When the agents converged on the workshop, the canny villain detected this. Killer Shrike was struck down by Tinkerer's security systems, and Tinkerer fled to Latveria rather than face justice. Early in the Marvel Knights imprint of Spider-Man, Eddie Brock sells the Venom symbiote through an auction put on by Tinkerer.Marvel Knights: Spider-Man #7. Marvel Comics. Frank Castle finds and confronts Tinkerer after a confrontation with the murderous Stilt-Man to which Tinkerer begs for death. Not only was his son Rick dead, but Rick's own son perished in the Stamford, Connecticut explosion that heralded the beginning of the Civil War. Without his beloved son or grandson, he was suicidal and continued his work in the hope that both superheroes and supervillains would wipe each other out. Castle stabs Tinkerer in the back, likely leaving him paralyzed.Punisher War Journal vol 2 Now bound to a wheelchair, Phineas has been contracted by Silas \\"Cyber\\" Burr to subject the resurrected villain's new body to the Adamantium-epidermal bonding process. Phineas agrees to create a \\"pacemaker\\" for the ailing Cyber's heart condition, as well as three carbonadium bullets for Logan in exchange for the use of Logan's mysterious carbonadium synthesizer. Cyber awakens from the procedure to discover the deadly radioactive device permanently attached to the chest and that Logan has disappeared with the C-synth. Phineas is last seen in the enraged Cyber's clutches.Wolverine: Origins #12-15. Marvel Comics. Surviving his encounter with Cyber, he is seen attending the Survivors' Guild, a therapy group for survivors of the Punisher. He is later apprehended by Iron Man for ties to a super WMD black market. During the Secret Invasion storyline, he is freed from Prison 42 to help Johnny Storm, the Ben Grimm, Franklin Richards and Valeria Richards return to the Earth dimension. It is mentioned that Phineas had retired the Tinkerer identity but is imprisoned for breaking the Registration Act anyway. He is initially reluctant to help his old foes, but Franklin's and Valeria's resemblance to his own grandchildren causes him to relent.Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four #3. Marvel Comics. It was revealed Rick is in fact still alive, under deep cover, and in a conspiracy which resulted in Carol Danvers's apparent murder for Norman Osborn in exchange for Phineas's release and cleared record.Ms. Marvel vol. 2 #37. Marvel Comics. Tinkerer is later seen in jail where he repairs Hypno-Hustler's costume.Avenging Spider- Man #13. Marvel Comics. Phil Urich later visits Tinkerer to have the Hobgoblin's gear upgraded to evade Superior Spider-Man. It is shown that Tinkerer has taken in Tiberius Stone as a secret apprentice as Tiberius gets revenge on Hobgoblin by making it so that Hobgoblin's tech fails.The Superior Spider-Man #15. Marvel Comics. ==Powers and abilities== The Tinkerer has a genius intellect, with extensive knowledge in a wide variety of scientific disciplines. He has a high degree of expertise in the design and manufacture of inventive weapons and devices derived from pre-existing technologies. Tinkerer has invented a wide variety of scientific and technological devices, and often has access to these devices as needed. Tinkerer's advanced age limits his physical abilities, and he possesses no superhuman abilities. ==Other versions== ===Ultimate Marvel=== The Ultimate Marvel incarnation of Phineas Mason is a scientific prodigy at Nursery Two, one of the think tanks of young geniuses sponsored by the U.S. government. The Mole Man kidnapped Mason and his fellow students with the intention of using them to seed a new underground civilization in Subterranea. With Fantastic Four's help, the Nursery Two students defeated Mole Man. Rather than return to their lives above ground, Mason and his teammates opted to stay behind and start a civilization on their own terms.Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual #2. Marvel Comics. The Ultimate version of Tinkerer is Elijah Stern, an original character who resembles actor Paul Giamatti.Brucie, Dylan (March 2007). Ultimate Spider-Man. Wizard Xtra!. p. 117. This original iteration was a former employee of the Roxxon Corporation after discovering a way to use vibranium as a power source, and a key indicator of his alias is when he states that he merely \\"tinkers\\". Elijah vindictively hires Killer Shrike, Omega Red and the Vulture (Blackie Drago) to torment his former boss Donald Roxxon as revenge for being fired. When his plan was foiled, he is given a choice to work for Nick Fury or death.Ultimate Spider-Man #90. Marvel Comics. Choosing to work for S.H.I.E.L.D., Elijah later commands his Spider-Slayer robots in going after Spider-Man (Peter Parker), showing a sadistic side.Ultimate Spider-Man #97-105. Marvel Comics.

She was elected in 2012 to be one of the 7 Olmsted County Board of Commissioners and represents a district within Rochester, Minnesota. Olmsted County, Minnesota Commissioners serve on a non- partisan board: there are no party designations or endorsements. Kiscaden is a former Minnesota State Senator from District 30, which includes much of Rochester and nearby rural areas. She was first elected to the Senate in 1992 as a Republican. In 2002, after being denied the Republican endorsement at the senate district convention, she ran as a member of the Independence Party of Minnesota. That fall she defeated the Republican candidate and a Democratic challenger in a three-way race. Despite being elected as a member of the Independence Party, Kiscaden still caucused with the Republicans until they publicly separated from her. She was invited to join the Minnesota Democratic- Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) caucus, which she did, though she did not formally join that party until January 2006. In January 2006, Kiscaden became a candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota with DFLer Kelly Doran in his bid for governor. He dropped out of the race after only a couple of months. Kiscaden had endorsed another member of the DFL to succeed her in the legislature. Her most recent term in the State Senate ended in January 2007. Although recruited to run for Congress and to return to the Minnesota State Senate, Kiscaden chose to run for County Commissioner. In that role she has served on the State Community Health Advisory Council, chairing a Health Equity Task Force in 2015, and serving on the Future of Public Health Task Force in 2017. As a State Senator she had a lead role in health care and human services policy. That policy interest and expertise has led to serving on a variety of state commissions and task forces since being elected to the County Board. This includes serving on the State Community Health Advisory Council, for which she chaired a work group on Health Equity, and serving on the Future of Public Health Task Force. She created a task force that is examining the consequences of parental incarceration on children and considering state and local policies to reduce the long-term negative developmental impacts on children. Her expertise in health, human services, and corrections was developed from her years as human services planner and program manager at the county level as well as her 25 years of experience as and organizational development consultant for government and non-profit organizations. A graduate of the University of Minnesota in Education where she was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, she also earned a master's degree in Public Administration from the University of Southern California. She used a Bush Leadership Fellowship to earn a second master's degree in Participation, Development and Social Change from the Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex, Brighton, England. She has extensive experience as an engaged community volunteer and has been the founder of several local initiatives, including the Beat the Odds Scholarship Program, Rochester Issues Forum, SE MN Together, and More Women on the Move.

They are tied as the fifth-longest cantilever bridges in the world. Each span carries four general-use automobile lanes; additionally the westbound span has two reversible HOV lanes across the river. It is the farthest downstream bridge on the Mississippi River. It is also the widest and most heavily traveled bridge on the lower Mississippi; the only other comparable bridges on the Mississippi are in the St. Louis area, those being the Poplar Street Bridge, the Jefferson Barracks Bridge, and the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge. ==History== What later became known as the Crescent City Connection was the second bridge to span the Mississippi south of Baton Rouge, the first being the Huey P. Long Bridge, a few miles upriver from the city, and it is the first bridge across the river in Orleans Parish, coterminous with the city of New Orleans. The Mississippi River Bridge Authority, known since 1989 as the Crescent City Connection Division (CCCD), began construction of the first span in November 1954, which opened in April 1958 as the Greater New Orleans Bridge. At its opening, the bridge was the longest cantilever bridge in the world although in terms of main span length, it was third, after the Forth Bridge and the Quebec Bridge. It carried two lanes of traffic in each direction and spurred growth in the suburban area known as the West Bank (named for its location on the western bank of the river although it is geographically southeast of New Orleans). Construction of the second span began in March 1981. Despite promises that it would be ready for the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition, it did not open to traffic until September 1988. The second span was originally designated as the Greater New Orleans Bridge No. 2. Both bridges were designed by Modjeski & Masters, Inc.. As soon as the new span was opened, the old span was temporarily closed in phases to replace the asphalt-on-steel deck with concrete. All the exits and entrances to the bridge were replaced as well. After the completion of the second span, a public contest was held in 1989 to rename the bridges, which was won by Jennifer Grodsky, of St. Clement of Rome School in Metairie, Louisiana, on March 17. The name was selected over the second-place finisher, the Greater New Orleans Superspan, as the name for the spans. Other names voted on for the naming of the spans included: the Crescent City Twins, the Delta Twins, the Crescent City Bridge, the New Orleans Metro Span, the Crescent City Gateway, the Crescent City Twin Span, the Crescent City River Bridge, The Big Easy and the Li'l Easy, the Jazz City Bridge, the Big East Twin Spans, The Pelican Bridge, the Fleur-de-Lis, the Greater Mississippi River Bridge, the Unity Bridge, the Mississippi River Twins, The Friendship Connection, The Pelican Pride, the Riverview Bridge, the Creole Crossing, the Jazz Gate Bridge, the Greater New Orleans Twin Bridges, and the Crescent Bend Bridge. Following this contest, the Louisiana Legislature officially designated the bridges as the Crescent City Connection. (The bridge is commonly known among local Vietnamese Americans as , the \\"Pelican Bridge\\", due to blue signs at either end that feature a pelican from the state flag.) Beginning in 1989, it was maintained and policed as a toll bridge by the CCCD, a special division of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, although a 2013 vote removed the tolls, and the crossing is now overseen by the Louisiana Department of Public Safety. This separate state police agency used elsewhere in the state, is required because of the high traffic volume and the fact that the two spans briefly cross into Jefferson Parish and the city of Gretna, Louisiana. Since renaming of the twin bridges, some local residents refer to the bridge as \\"The GNO\\", in spite of the name change from decades past. Most people refer to it as the \\"CCC\\", whereas the proper name of \\"Crescent City Connection\\" is used mainly in the media. Due to the Mississippi River's winding course through the New Orleans area (the river is flowing north at the place where the two bridges cross), the bridge contains two wrong-way concurrencies, with the eastbound span carrying Business US 90 West, while the westbound span carries Business US 90 East. The Crescent City Connection was the fifth most traveled toll bridge in the United States in 2006, with annual traffic exceeding 63 million vehicles. The bridge is the centerpiece of the Crescent Connection Road Race (CCRR) or Bridge Race as it is locally known, an annual event held on the first Saturday in September following Labor Day. The bridge remains open to vehicular traffic during the race, which only uses the two HOV lanes. The CCRR was originally started as a fundraiser for the bridge's decorative lights. These lights line the top profile lines of both bridges; 64 lights along each string for a total 256 lights. ===Hurricane Katrina=== As Hurricane Katrina approached the city in August 2005, the CCCD halted toll collections on August 26 to aid in speed of evacuation of the Metro area. Two overhead signs were blown down on the older span, but no other damage occurred to either bridge. After the storm hit on August 29, 2005, much of the east bank of New Orleans flooded severely (see Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans). With all other major and minor highways out of town flooded in both directions, the CCC was the only open highway into or out of the east bank of Orleans Parish. (One other route, Leake Avenue/Old River Road, a small road along the Mississippi River levee, was initially blocked by debris but was cleared by local volunteer work). Two days after the storm passed, the Gretna police set up a roadblock on the bridge, refusing passage to evacuees. In the initial weeks following the storm, only emergency personnel and contractors were permitted to use the bridge. The bridge reopened to traffic in mid-September as decreasing water levels on the East Bank of Orleans Parish allowed Interstate 10 to reopen and residents to return, but then was temporarily closed to regular traffic again when another evacuation was declared due to Hurricane Rita, with the bridge again reopening in late September. Toll collection resumed on October 10 after a six-week suspension, as the revenue was needed to maintain operations. Long lines at the toll booth lanes during non-rush times became common, due to a shortage of toll collectors and electronic toll tags, combined with heavy usage of the bridge due to the many New Orleanians staying with friends and relatives on the Westbank while they worked on gutting and repairing their flooded Eastbank homes. ===Proposed Future Interstate 49 designation=== In addition to the CCC's designation as Business US 90, the bridge, along with its approach roads, the Pontchartrain Expressway and Westbank Expressway were proposed to also serve as Interstate 910. This proposed designation was federal only and no signs identify the bridge as I-910. This is a temporary designation until Interstate 49 is completed between New Orleans and Lafayette, at which time the bridge will be signed as I-49. This proposed designation currently does not have funding to support all the needed infrastructure to accomplish the plan and has largely been dropped. ==Tolls== Westbank toll plaza in March 2007 The tolls collected on the Crescent City Connection were defined in Louisiana state law R.S. 47:820.5(B). This law said that from October 1, 1994 through December 31, 2012, tolls were to be collected at a rate of $0.20 per axle for toll tag users, and $0.50 per axle for cash users. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, annual toll collections averaged $20 million. There have been investigations conducted by the Louisiana Office of Legislative Auditor regarding bridge employees pocketing toll revenue for their own use and supervisors falsifying reports to hide the theft. There were citizen action groups who were actively opposing the tolls and their potential renewal in 2012. The Times-Picayune newspaper wrote an editorial recommending that the tolls not be renewed at the end of 2012. The Bureau of Governmental Research, an independent watchdog group in New Orleans, released a detailed financial study on the CCC tolls which showed that the majority of the toll money collected in tolls does not benefit those who pay the tolls. The full BGR report is available as well. On March 5, 2013, toll collection was nullified on the Crescent City Connection due to 19th Judicial District Judge William Morvant's decision to nullify the November 2012 toll vote. A new referendum held on May 4, 2013, defeated the toll extension and officially ended tolls on the Crescent City Connection. The referendum was defeated by 78% of voters in Orleans, Jefferson and Plaquemines Parishes. ===GeauxPass=== The Crescent City Connection introduced toll tags on January 4, 1989, becoming the first toll facility in the United States to use electronic toll collection. The system was originally designed and installed by TransCore, who managed the system until tolls were ended in 2013. However, in the first quarter of 2005, the CCCD awarded a contract to Electronic Transaction Consultants (ETC) Corporation to design, develop and implement a replacement toll collection system. The \\"GeauxPass\\" was announced in the summer of 2009 as the new statewide electronic toll system for Louisiana. GeauxPass is compatible with the Crescent City Connection, the LA-1 Tollway, and all future Louisiana toll roads. There are currently over 100,000 tags in operation. To encourage use of the toll tags, the Crescent City Connection offered several benefits to commuters until 2013, including: *Reduced Toll: $0.40 *Dedicated Toll Tag lanes *Use of HOV lanes when carrying Eastbank-bound traffic ==Use as a film setting== As an iconic part of the city's skyline, the spans have been a favorite of movie production crews. The HOV lanes are frequently used for filming, as they are not heavily used and are separated from normal traffic by barrier walls. Both spans were briefly closed on April 9, 2006, to allow filming with stunts and pyrotechnics for the Denzel Washington film Déjà Vu. The spans also served as the anchor for the background in most of the outdoor scenes in the film A Love Song for Bobby Long. ==See also== * List of crossings of the Lower Mississippi River * List of longest bridges ==References== ==External links== * Crescent City Connection Division within the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development * Category:Bridges in New Orleans Category:Bridges over the Mississippi River Category:Great River Road Category:Intracoastal Waterway Category:Electronic toll collection Category:Bridges completed in 1958 Category:Bridges completed in 1988 Category:Road bridges in Louisiana Category:U.S. Route 90 Category:Bridges on the United States Numbered Highways Category:Former toll bridges in Louisiana Category:Steel bridges in the United States Category:Cantilever bridges in the United States Category:1958 establishments in Louisiana ","title":"Crescent City Connection"},{"id":"2578570","text":"A spread is a food that is spread, generally with a knife, onto foods such as bread and crackers.

Residues that are conserved across all sequences are highlighted in grey. Below each site (i.e., position) of the protein sequence alignment is a key denoting conserved sites (*), sites with conservative replacements (:), sites with semi-conservative replacements (.), and sites with non-conservative replacements ( ). In evolutionary biology, conserved sequences are identical or similar sequences in nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) or proteins across species (orthologous sequences), or within a genome (paralogous sequences), or between donor and receptor taxa (xenologous sequences). Conservation indicates that a sequence has been maintained by natural selection. A highly conserved sequence is one that has remained relatively unchanged far back up the phylogenetic tree, and hence far back in geological time. Examples of highly conserved sequences include the RNA components of ribosomes present in all domains of life, the homeobox sequences widespread amongst Eukaryotes, and the tmRNA in Bacteria. The study of sequence conservation overlaps with the fields of genomics, proteomics, evolutionary biology, phylogenetics, bioinformatics and mathematics. ==History== The discovery of the role of DNA in heredity, and observations by Frederick Sanger of variation between animal insulins in 1949, prompted early molecular biologists to study taxonomy from a molecular perspective. Studies in the 1960s used DNA hybridization and protein cross- reactivity techniques to measure similarity between known orthologous proteins, such as hemoglobin and cytochrome c. In 1965, Émile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling introduced the concept of the molecular clock, proposing that steady rates of amino acid replacement could be used to estimate the time since two organisms diverged. While initial phylogenies closely matched the fossil record, observations that some genes appeared to evolve at different rates led to the development of theories of molecular evolution. Margaret Dayhoff's 1966 comparison of ferrodoxin sequences showed that natural selection would act to conserve and optimise protein sequences essential to life. ==Mechanisms== Over many generations, nucleic acid sequences in the genome of an evolutionary lineage can gradually change over time due to random mutations and deletions. Sequences may also recombine or be deleted due to chromosomal rearrangements. Conserved sequences are sequences which persist in the genome despite such forces, and have slower rates of mutation than the background mutation rate. Conservation can occur in coding and non-coding nucleic acid sequences. Highly conserved DNA sequences are thought to have functional value, although the role for many highly conserved non-coding DNA sequences is poorly understood. The extent to which a sequence is conserved can be affected by varying selection pressures, its robustness to mutation, population size and genetic drift. Many functional sequences are also modular, containing regions which may be subject to independent selection pressures, such as protein domains. ===Coding sequence=== In coding sequences, the nucleic acid and amino acid sequence may be conserved to different extents, as the degeneracy of the genetic code means that synonymous mutations in a coding sequence do not affect the amino acid sequence of its protein product. Amino acid sequences can be conserved to maintain the structure or function of a protein or domain. Conserved proteins undergo fewer amino acid replacements, or are more likely to substitute amino acids with similar biochemical properties. Within a sequence, amino acids that are important for folding, structural stability, or that form a binding site may be more highly conserved. The nucleic acid sequence of a protein coding gene may also be conserved by other selective pressures. The codon usage bias in some organisms may restrict the types of synonymous mutations in a sequence. Nucleic acid sequences that cause secondary structure in the mRNA of a coding gene may be selected against, as some structures may negatively affect translation, or conserved where the mRNA also acts as a functional non-coding RNA. ===Non- coding=== Non-coding sequences important for gene regulation, such as the binding or recognition sites of ribosomes and transcription factors, may be conserved within a genome. For example, the promoter of a conserved gene or operon may also be conserved. As with proteins, nucleic acids that are important for the structure and function of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) can also be conserved. However, sequence conservation in ncRNAs is generally poor compared to protein-coding sequences, and base pairs that contribute to structure or function are often conserved instead. ==Identification== Conserved sequences are typically identified by bioinformatics approaches based on sequence alignment. Advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing and protein mass spectrometry has substantially increased the availability of protein sequences and whole genomes for comparison since the early 2000s. ===Homology search=== Conserved sequences may be identified by homology search, using tools such as BLAST, HMMER, OrthologR, and Infernal. Homology search tools may take an individual nucleic acid or protein sequence as input, or use statistical models generated from multiple sequence alignments of known related sequences. Statistical models such as profile-HMMs, and RNA covariance models which also incorporate structural information, can be helpful when searching for more distantly related sequences. Input sequences are then aligned against a database of sequences from related individuals or other species. The resulting alignments are then scored based on the number of matching amino acids or bases, and the number of gaps or deletions generated by the alignment. Acceptable conservative substitutions may be identified using substitution matrices such as PAM and BLOSUM. Highly scoring alignments are assumed to be from homologous sequences. The conservation of a sequence may then be inferred by detection of highly similar homologs over a broad phylogenetic range. ===Multiple sequence alignment=== A sequence logo for the LexA-binding motif of gram-positive bacteria. As the adenosine at position 5 is highly conserved, it appears larger than other characters. Multiple sequence alignments can be used to visualise conserved sequences. The CLUSTAL format includes a plain- text key to annotate conserved columns of the alignment, denoting conserved sequence (*), conservative mutations (:), semi-conservative mutations (.), and non-conservative mutations ( ) Sequence logos can also show conserved sequence by representing the proportions of characters at each point in the alignment by height. ===Genome alignment=== OTX2 gene. Top: Gene annotations of exons and introns of the OTX2 gene. For each genome, sequence similarity (%) compared to the human genome is plotted. Tracks show the zebrafish, dog, chicken, western clawed frog, opossum, mouse, rhesus macaque and chimpanzee genomes. The peaks show regions of high sequence similarity across all genomes, showing that this sequence is highly conserved. Whole genome alignments (WGAs) may also be used to identify highly conserved regions across species. Currently the accuracy and scalability of WGA tools remains limited due to the computational complexity of dealing with rearrangements, repeat regions and the large size of many eukaryotic genomes. However, WGAs of 30 or more closely related bacteria (prokaryotes) are now increasingly feasible. ===Scoring systems=== Other approaches use measurements of conservation based on statistical tests that attempt to identify sequences which mutate differently to an expected background (neutral) mutation rate. The GERP (Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling) framework scores conservation of genetic sequences across species. This approach estimates the rate of neutral mutation in a set of species from a multiple sequence alignment, and then identifies regions of the sequence that exhibit fewer mutations than expected. These regions are then assigned scores based on the difference between the observed mutation rate and expected background mutation rate. A high GERP score then indicates a highly conserved sequence. LIST (Local Identity and Shared Taxa) is based on the assumption that variations observed in species closely related to human are more significant when assessing conservation compared to those in distantly related species. Thus, LIST utilizes the local alignment identity around each position to identify relevant sequences in the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and then it estimates conservation based on the taxonomy distances of these sequences to human. Unlike other tools, LIST ignores the count/frequency of variations in the MSA. Aminode combines multiple alignments with phylogenetic analysis to analyze changes in homologous proteins and produce a plot that indicates the local rates of evolutionary changes. This approach identifies the Evolutionarily Constrained Regions in a protein, which are segments that are subject to purifying selection and are typically critical for normal protein function. Other approaches such as PhyloP and PhyloHMM incorporate statistical phylogenetics methods to compare probability distributions of substitution rates, which allows the detection of both conservation and accelerated mutation. First, a background probability distribution is generated of the number of substitutions expected to occur for a column in a multiple sequence alignment, based on a phylogenetic tree. The estimated evolutionary relationships between the species of interest are used to calculate the significance of any substitutions (i.e. a substitution between two closely related species may be less likely to occur than distantly related ones, and therefore more significant). To detect conservation, a probability distribution is calculated for a subset of the multiple sequence alignment, and compared to the background distribution using a statistical test such as a likelihood-ratio test or score test. P-values generated from comparing the two distributions are then used to identify conserved regions. PhyloHMM uses hidden Markov models to generate probability distributions. The PhyloP software package compares probability distributions using a likelihood- ratio test or score test, as well as using a GERP-like scoring system. ==Extreme conservation== ===Ultra-conserved elements=== Ultra-conserved elements or UCEs are sequences that are highly similar or identical across multiple taxonomic groupings. These were first discovered in vertebrates, and have subsequently been identified within widely-differing taxa. While the origin and function of UCEs are poorly understood, they have been used to investigate deep-time divergences in amniotes, insects, and between animals and plants. ===Universally conserved genes=== The most highly conserved genes are those that can be found in all organisms. These consist mainly of the ncRNAs and proteins required for transcription and translation, which are assumed to have been conserved from the last universal common ancestor of all life. Genes or gene families that have been found to be universally conserved include GTP-binding elongation factors, Methionine aminopeptidase 2, Serine hydroxymethyltransferase, and ATP transporters. Components of the transcription machinery, such as RNA polymerase and helicases, and of the translation machinery, such as ribosomal RNAs, tRNAs and ribosomal proteins are also universally conserved. == Applications == ===Phylogenetics and taxonomy=== Sets of conserved sequences are often used for generating phylogenetic trees, as it can be assumed that organisms with similar sequences are closely related. The choice of sequences may vary depending on the taxonomic scope of the study. For example, the most highly conserved genes such as the 16S RNA and other ribosomal sequences are useful for reconstructing deep phylogenetic relationships and identifying bacterial phyla in metagenomics studies. Sequences that are conserved within a clade but undergo some mutations, such as housekeeping genes, can be used to study species relationships. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, which is required for spacing conserved rRNA genes but undergoes rapid evolution, is commonly used to classify fungi and strains of rapidly evolving bacteria. ===Medical research=== As highly conserved sequences often have important biological functions, they can be useful a starting point for identifying the cause of genetic diseases. Many congenital metabolic disorders and Lysosomal storage diseases are the result of changes to individual conserved genes, resulting in missing or faulty enzymes that are the underlying cause of the symptoms of the disease. Genetic diseases may be predicted by identifying sequences that are conserved between humans and lab organisms such as mice or fruit flies, and studying the effects of knock-outs of these genes. Genome- wide association studies can also be used to identify variation in conserved sequences associated with disease or health outcomes. ===Functional annotation=== Identifying conserved sequences can be used to discover and predict functional sequences such as genes. Conserved sequences with a known function, such as protein domains, can also be used to predict the function of a sequence. Databases of conserved protein domains such as Pfam and the Conserved Domain Database can be used to annotate functional domains in predicted protein coding genes. == See also == * Evolutionary developmental biology * Segregating site * Sequence alignment * Sequence alignment software * UCbase * Ultra-conserved element ==References== Category:Bioinformatics Category:Computational phylogenetics Category:Nucleic acids Category:Protein structure Category:Population genetics Category:Molecular genetics Category:Evolutionary developmental biology ","title":"Conserved sequence"},{"id":"2578586","text":"Suya or tsire is a spicy meat skewer which is a popular food item in West Africa.

Outside the Bay Area, the A's radio network of 18 stations (three of them nights and weekends only) reach baseball fans in Northern California and Nevada. The team also has an in-market online radio station branded as A's Cast which is available on iHeartRadio. The Athletics' radio broadcast team consists of Ken Korach, Vince Cotroneo and occasionally (former All-Star major league catcher) color commentator Ray Fosse (for radio- only broadcasts). Korach, A's play-by-play announcer since 1996, moved up to the lead position with the death of Bill King. Cotroneo has had 13 years of major-league experience, most recently with the Texas Rangers. King, who died on October 18, 2005, was the lead radio voice of the Athletics for 25 years, from 1981 through 2005, the longest tenure for an A's announcer since the team's games were first broadcast in 1938 (they were the Philadelphia Athletics from 1901 to 1954, and the Kansas City Athletics from 1955 to 1967, before owner Charles O. Finley moved them to Oakland). King was paired in the booth with Lon Simmons from 1981 through 1995. Former A's catcher Ray Fosse has served as the broadcast team's analyst since 1986. For several years starting in 2001, Steve Bitker served as a back-up play-by-play announcer, averaging about 20 games per season. He had limited appearances in 2006, filling in when Korach was on vacation. Robert Buan held the position of Athletics' broadcasting manager from 1995 to ~ 2006. He also hosted the \\"Extra Innings\\" postgame radio talk show, which fans called to talk about the A's with Buan or a guest. The show often emanated from the stadium or in a studio, and certain select ones were broadcast from local bars or restaurants before a live audience. He also did Internet-only play-by-play of spring training games. He was succeeded by Chris Townsend and Rick Tittle. King, a native of Bloomington, Illinois, was perhaps the most well-known sports announcer in the Bay Area, having previously handled play-by-play work for football's Oakland and Los Angeles Raiders (1966–1992) and basketball's San Francisco and Golden State Warriors (1962–1983). His trademark catchphrase \\"Holy Toledo!\\" was familiar to Northern California sports fans for over forty years. King and his fellow Athletics radio announcers, Ken Korach and Ray Fosse, were ranked as the second-best broadcast team in the American League by USA Today in 2005. === Television === A's games are telecast on NBC Sports California. Glen Kuiper, brother of San Francisco Giants broadcaster Duane, is the A's television play-by-play announcer. For over two decades former major league catcher, Ray Fosse has analyzed the games. When not doing so in the television booth, Fosse adds to the radio broadcast team. Scott Reiss hosts A's Pregame Live and A's Postgame Live with analyst Eric Chavez; Chavez also substitutes for Fosse as game analyst on 20 telecasts per season. === Stadium announcer === Roy Steele was the Athletics' official stadium announcer at the Coliseum every year since the team's move to Oakland in 1968. His booming baritone voice has earned him the Voice of God moniker among A's fans, although it was first bestowed upon him by sports announcer Jon Miller after a visit to the Coliseum as a fan sitting in the stands. Steele had been an independent Baptist minister for 17 years before being named stadium announcer and finds the name \\"a little overpowering\\". From 1968 through 2004, Steele had missed fewer than ten home games, but in September 2005, an illness (achalasia, a rare disorder of the esophagus) prevented him from announcing several games including most of the final homestand. The 73-year-old Steele was ill for most 2006, and remained at his home in Auburn while recovering. His interim replacement was Dick Callahan, who also announced for the Golden State Warriors. Steele returned behind the microphone beginning with the A's exhibition game vs. the Giants on April 1, 2007. However, health issues sidelined Steele for the entire 2009 season, with Callahan returning to the post. Steele made another return on his own Bobblehead Giveaway Day on April 17, 2010 with the A's facing the Baltimore Orioles, announcing every inning (with the exception of the visiting half of the first inning) and throwing out the ceremonial first pitch. Steele died on May 28, 2020. == Previous broadcasters == === Philadelphia years === In 1938, a young Texan named Byrum Saam became the first radio voice of the A's. Saam, later joined by Claude Haring, broadcast all the Athletics’ home games on station WIBG. Because Saam and Haring also broadcast Phillies’ home games as well, A's road games were only broadcast when there was no conflict with a Phillies home game. Even so, the team's road game broadcasts were what were called \\"ticker tape games\\" in that era. Saam and Haring would broadcast from studios in Philadelphia, reconstructing the game from telegraphic feeds brought in by assistants. Beginning in 1950, the Athletics began broadcasting all games, home and away, on WIBG with Saam and Haring accompanying the team on road trips. (The Phillies hired their own announcers in 1950 and broadcast their games on a different radio station.) Their tenure as A's broadcast announcers came to an end after the 1954 season, when the team was sold and moved. === Kansas City years === When the Athletics moved to Kansas City for the 1955 season, Merle Harmon and Billy Ray were hired as play-by-play announcers. Harmon remained the voice of the A's until 1962, when then-owner Charles O. Finley replaced him with Monte Moore, an Oklahoma native along with George Bryson a veteran announcer from the Cincinnati Reds. On September 16, 1964, Betty Caywood, previously a television weather analyst, was hired by owner Finley to join the broadcasting crew, becoming the first female play-by-play broadcaster in major league baseball. She finished out the 1964 season, but did not return in 1965. === Since the move to Oakland === Moore came west with the team's move to Oakland in 1968, remaining the team's principal radio/TV voice through the 1977 season. He was hired by NBC to announce the Saturday Game of the Week with Wes Parker and Maury Wills. He also was the announcer with Parker on the USA Network's USA Thursday Game of the Week. He came out of retirement in 1988 when the A's asked him to be the announcer on the A's telecasts with Ray Fosse as analyst. Moore broadcast those games through the 1992 season, commuting from Porterville, California, where he had moved his family and purchased the radio stations KTIP/KIOO. The last year the A's were in Kansas City, there was an incident on a plane trip involving some players and a complaint by a passenger to a hostess. Moore was accused of telling about it to Finley, but years later, at a memorial service for Finley at the Oakland Coliseum, Moore was the emcee and following the program, Finley's youngest son, Paul, who was travelling with the A's on that trip, admitted to Moore and some others around there, that it was he who told his dad about the incident and that he had felt bad all these years that he knew Moore had not been the one who told Finley, and he wanted to apologize for the misery caused. During Moore's tenure, he had a number of co-announcers with him in the booth, including Harry Caray, Bob Elson, Al Helfer, Red Rush, and Jim Woods, all of whom had achieved fame as major-league broadcasters elsewhere before joining the A's, and Jon Miller, who went on to success with the Orioles and Giants. Former major league players Curt Flood, Reggie Jackson, Harmon Killebrew, and Jim Piersall served as A's announcers at one time, as did former player and manager Bill Rigney. As noted above, the late Bill King announced the A's games on radio from 1981 to 2005. He partnered on A's broadcasts for 15 years with future Hall-of-Famer Lon Simmons, with Ken Korach replacing Simmons for the 1996 season. Simmons had previously been an announcer for the Giants, the National League \\"crosstown\\" (actually cross-Bay) rivals of the American League A's, for many years (since their 1958 arrival from New York); Simmons rejoined the Giants broadcast team on a part-time basis from 1996 to 2002. === Broadcasters through the years === { - valign=\\"top\\" * Shooty Babitt 2014* * Larry Baer 1978 * Steve Bitker 2001–2011 *Dallas Braden 2017–present * George Bryson 1963–1964 * Harry Caray 1970 * Herb Carneal 1954 * Betty Caywood 1964 * Eric Chavez 2015** *Vince Cotroneo 2006–present (radio) * Ed Edwards 1957–1958 * Bob Elson 1971 * Lynn Faris 1966–1967 * Curt Flood 1978 *Ray Fosse 1986–present (television) * Bud Foster 1978 * Hank Greenwald 2004–2005 * Bill Grigsby 1958–1961 * Wayne Hagin 1981–1984 * Claude Haring ca. 1940–1954 * Merle Harmon 1955–1961 * Scott Hatteberg 2012–2013*** * Al Helfer 1968–1969 * Reggie Jackson 1991–1992 * Harmon Killebrew 1981–1982 * Bill King 1981–2005 *Ken Korach 1996–present * Bob Kozberg 1978 width=\\"50\\" valign=\\"top\\" *Glen Kuiper 2004–present * Jon Miller 1974 * Monte Moore 1962–1980, 1985–1992 * Greg Papa 1990–2003 * Jim Peterson 1978 * Jim Piersall 1972 * Hal Ramey 1979 * Larry Ray 1955–1956 * Bruce Rice 1962 * Bill Rigney 1974, 1983–1984, 1991–1992 * Ted Robinson 1980, 1985–1987 * Tim Roye 2004–2006 * Red Rush 1965, 1971, 1979–1980 * By Saam 1938–1954 * John Shrader 1988–1989 * Lon Simmons 1981–1995 * Dick Stockton 1993–1995 * Chuck Thompson 1946–1948 * Dom Valentino 1980 * Wayne Walker 1976–1980, 1985 * Bob Waller 1975–1977 * Ken Wilson 1996–1998 * Jim Woods 1972–1973 } *Babitt substituted for Fosse for several games during the 2014 season. **Chavez substituted for Fosse for several games during the 2015 season. ***Hatteberg substituted for Fosse for several games during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. == See also == * List of current Major League Baseball broadcasters == References == * Jordan, David M.

App. 1988) (available through LexisNexis and Westlaw) ===Misinformation about health of fetus=== In a case of the second type, the woman seeks advice concerning the health and bodily integrity of her fetus (see genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis), and decides to undergo an abortion after being told that the fetus is deformed or disabled. Here, too, it is eventually realized that the information was wrong.Johnson v. United States, 810 F. Supp. 7 (D.D.C. 1993)Breyne v. Potter, 574 S.E.2d 916 (Ga. Ct. App. 2002)Martinez v. Long Island Jewish Hillside Med. Ctr., 512 N.E.2d 538, 538 (N.Y. 1987) ==Analogous terms== ===Wrongful pregnancy/conception=== \\"Wrongful abortion\\" is comparable to other types of birth-related malpractice. One category of birth-related malpractice consists of cases in which negligence by the defendant resulted in the birth of a healthy yet unwanted child. The negligence may manifest itself in the manufacture, provision, or installation of contraceptives; in the performance of vasectomy or tubal ligation; or in the carrying out of an abortion. These cases are usually labeled \\"wrongful pregnancy\\" (or \\"wrongful conception\\" in appropriate cases). In a way, they represent a mirror image of wrongful abortion cases, although they are not exact reflections. In cases of wrongful pregnancy, the doctor's negligence makes the fulfillment of the parents’ will impossible, while in wrongful abortion cases the doctor's negligence instigates, but does not necessitate, a decision that turns out to be inconsistent with such will. ===Wrongful birth/life=== Another category of birth-related malpractice, more closely related to wrongful abortion, consists of cases in which a woman seeks medical advice regarding the health of her fetus, and decides to conceive or to continue her pregnancy once the adviser maintains that the fetus will not be born with congenital disabilities, a statement that is later found to be incorrect. The parents’ cause of action for their resulting losses is labeled \\"wrongful birth,\\" while the infant’s cause of action for their own losses is termed \\"wrongful life.\\" Wrongful birth is a more accurate mirror image of wrongful abortion.Appel, Jacob. Physicians, Wrongful Life and the Constitution Medicine & Health, Rhode Island Volume 87, Number 2. February 2004. The former deals with the non-prevention of the birth of an unwanted child, whereas the latter deals with the prevention of the birth of a wanted child. In both cases the defendant’s negligence does not make the fulfillment of the parent’s will physically impossible, but instigates a decision that turns out to be inconsistent with such will. ==See also== *Wrongful life *Bioethics ==References== ==Further reading== * * Perry, Ronen & Adar, Yehuda.

She and her group mates, Diana Ross (then known as Diane), Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard, signed a recording contract with Motown founder Berry Gordy on January 15, 1961 as the Supremes, a name that Ballard had chosen (as she was the only group member in the studio at the time) from a list provided by Motown songwriter Janie Bradford; the group became part of the Motown stable of performers. While recording a handful of early singles, none of which became hits, Martin, Wilson, Ross, and Ballard worked as studio backing singers, providing vocals and rhythmic effects, such as hand claps, for Motown's leading groups. In October 1961, Martin became pregnant. Her husband supported her decision to stay in the group, but, she left in the early spring of 1962 – leaving Ross, Wilson and Ballard a trio.Slonimsky, Nicolas & Kuhn , Laura Diane. \\"Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians\\".

The film tells the story of Soe Hok Gie, a graduate from University of Indonesia who is known as an activist and nature lover. The film is based on a diary Catatan Seorang Demonstran written by Soe himself. The plot of this film is an interpretation of the filmmakers, and scenes portraying Soe's private life may be partly fictionalised for dramatisation. The film received 11 nominations at the 2005 Indonesian Film Festival, winning three for \\"Best Film\\", \\"Best Actor\\" (in a leading role) for Nicholas Saputra, and \\"Best Cinematography\\". ==Plot== Soe Hok Gie grew up in a lower-middle class Chinese Indonesian family in Jakarta. In his early teens, young Gie had developed a fascination in concepts and idealisms advocated by world class intellectuals. Combined with a fighter's passion, faithfulness to friends, and a heart filled with genuine care for others and for his country, young Gie grew to become intolerant with injustice, and dreamt of an Indonesia that is truly founded on justice, equality, and righteousness. This passion was frequently misunderstood by others. Even Soe's best friends, Tan Tjin Han and Herman Lantang posed the question \\"What is all this fighting for?\\" which Soe would calmly respond with his awareness that freedom has a price tag that must be paid. Soe's motto, as written on the movie poster, is translated as \\"It is better to be singled out than to surrender to hypocrisy\\". Soe's teen and college years was spent under the regime of Indonesia's founding father Sukarno, which was characterised with conflict between the military and the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). Soe and his friends insisted that they were politically neutral; and as much as Soe has respect for Sukarno as Indonesia's founding father, Soe detested Sukarno's dictatorship which caused the poor and the oppressed to suffer. Soe was well aware of the social inequality, power abuse, and corruption under the government of Sukarno, and courageously spoke out against it in discussion groups, student unions, and wrote sharp criticisms in the media. Soe also abhorred the fact that too many students appeared to others as advocates of positive change, who in fact were just taking advantage of the political situation to make personal gain. This attracted much sympathy as well as opposition. Many interest groups sought Soe to support their campaigns, while many enemies of Soe jump at any opportunity to intimidate him. Tan, Soe's childhood friend, had always deeply admired Soe's prudence and courage but lacked that fighter's spirit himself. In their twenties, the boys were reunited again for a short time. Soe finds out that Tan had become seduced and deeply involved with the PKI but was ignorant as to what this implied or what consequences awaited. Soe urges Tan to relinquish his ties with the PKI and hide out, but Tan did not listen. Soe and his friends spend their leisure time hiking and enjoy nature with the Nature-Loving Students of the University of Indonesia (Mapala UI). Other things they enjoyed doing included watching and analysing movies, attending traditional Indonesian performing arts, and hanging out at parties. ==Cast== *Nicholas Saputra as Soe Hok Gie *Jonathan Mulia as Young Soe Hok Gie *Thomas Nawilis as Tan Tjin Han *Christian Audi as Young Tan Tjin Han *Sita Nursanti as Ira *Wulan Guritno as Sinta *Lukman Sardi as Herman Lantang * Angelo Bondoc as Yong Herman Lantang ==Additional characters== Ira and Sinta are two girls that represented the women in Soe's life. While in real life Soe did date several girls in the UI, Ira and Sinta in this movie are fictional characters because the women that were in fact close to Soe refused to make themselves known and reveal details of their relationship with Soe. Soe's diary mentioned his involvement with three women; however, it did not clearly indicate whether he was in love with any one of them. Ira was an intellectual young woman that shared Gie's idealistic dreams and fighter's spirit. Ira was Soe's best supporter and friend and present both during Gie's productive and leisure activities. Subtle hints of romance seemed to spark between the two every now and then, but neither had the nerve to follow it through. As the years unwinded, along came Sinta, an attractive girl with rich parents who admired Soe's writings. It was obvious that Gie and Sinta were physically attracted to each other, but failed to find the heart- to-heart connection. Sinta seemed to merely delight in Gie's company and the comfort and pride of being the girlfriend of a well-respected character, but did not have a genuine interest for the things that are close to Gie's heart. Vice versa, Gie was clueless about keeping Sinta entertained, and felt dissatisfied with the relationship. Sinta's presence caused a chill between Gie and Ira. The romance between Soe in the movie and Sinta may be based on Soe's closest girlfriend in real life. She was the daughter of a wealthy couple who admired Soe's work. However, as the relationship intensified, the girl's parents began to find excuses to prevent Soe and their daughter from seeing each other because the parents did not want to risk having their daughter married to a man who was struggling to make ends meet financially and was frequently the target of hate speech and other threats. In the movie, however, there was not much parental intervention portrayed or suggested in Soe and Sinta's relationship—it simply features several (often speechless) scenes of Soe and Sinta which leaves the audience to draw their own conclusions as to what may be going on at the back of Soe and Sinta's heads. Tan Tjin Han, young Soe's best friend, is in fact a fictional character. He is inspired by two personal friends of Soe, Djin Hok and Effendi. Djin Hok was the friend of Soe who experienced domestic abuse in his aunt's house, while Effendi was the friend who was abducted for his alleged involvement in the PKI. Other additional characters include Denny (a humorous and outspoken friend of Soe), Jaka (promoter of the Catholic student union who turned out to only have used politics as a means of obtaining personal gain) and Santi (a prostitute introduced to Soe as the boys' attempt to stimulate Soe to do something about his potentially romantic relationship with Ira). ==Awards and nominations== *Official entry from Indonesia for Best Foreign Language Film at the 78th Academy Awards *In competition in the ASEAN category at the 2006 Bangkok International Film Festival *Awarded Best Film at the 2005 Indonesian Film Festival ==Original Motion Picture Soundtrack== * Gie- Eross SO7 Feat.

Abbreviations Dictionary. CRC Press, 2001. 1202 . Retrieved 23 August 2010. , . juvenile detention, juvenile hall, or more colloquially as juvie/juvy, is a prison for people under the age of majority, often termed juvenile delinquents, to which they have been sentenced and committed for a period of time, or detained on a short-term basis while awaiting trial or placement in a long-term care program. Juveniles go through a separate court system, the juvenile court, which sentences or commits juveniles to a certain program or facility. ==Overview== Once processed in the juvenile court system there are many different pathways for juveniles. Some juveniles are released directly back into the community to undergo community-based rehabilitative programs, while others juveniles may pose a greater threat to society and to themselves and therefore are in need of a stay in a supervised juvenile detention center. If a juvenile is sent by the courts to a juvenile detention center, there are two types of facilities: secure detention and secure confinement. Secure detention means that juveniles are held for usually short periods of time in facilities in order to await current trial hearings and further placement decisions. By holding juveniles in secure detention, it ensures appearance in court while also keeping the community safe and risk-free of the juvenile. This type of facility is usually called a \\"juvenile hall,\\" which is a holding center for juvenile delinquents. On the other hand, secure confinement implies that the juvenile has been committed by the court into the custody of a secure juvenile correctional facility for the duration of a specific program, which can span from a few months to many years. Juvenile detention is not intended to be punitive. Rather, juveniles held in secure custody usually receive care consistent with the doctrine of parens patriae, i.e., the state as parent. The state or local jurisdiction is usually responsible for providing education, recreation, health, assessment, counseling and other intervention services with the intent of maintaining a youth's well-being during his or her stay in custody. Generally speaking, secure detention is reserved for juveniles considered to be a threat to public safety or the court process, though in many cases, youths are held for violating a court order. Status offenders, i.e., juveniles charged with running away from home, alcohol possession, and other offenses that are not crimes if committed by adults, may only be held for 24 hours or less,NCC.state.ne.us while initial case investigation is completed, and other alternatives are arranged. Within the categories of secure detention and secure confinement for juveniles, the overarching name of these facilities is residential programs. Five overarching types of residential programs where a juvenile may be placed while in court custody: The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention found the five types of residential programs for juveniles to be a broad range, which included detention, corrections, camp, community based, and residential treatment. The reason for the wide variety in placement options of juveniles is that there does not currently exist a uniform definition of residential treatment programs. As a result, this creates a lack of uniformity across states and a large variety of names for secure detention and secure confinement centers for juveniles. ==Services provided to the youth== Many services are supposed to be provided to the youth at both detention centers and confinement facilities. Services vary from facility to facility, but in general the programs and services provided to the youth are geared toward the juvenile's needs. At the core, juvenile facilities function as rehabilitative institutions for youth. Education is seen by many as the primary rehabilitative service that must be provided to detained youth. Highly effective schools within juvenile facilities provide high school curriculum, opportunities for General Equivalency Diploma (GED) preparation, special education services, certified teachers, small student to teacher ratio, connection with families, and vocational training opportunities. Despite state and federal requirements, there are many problems with the educational systems in juvenile detention centers. Many institutions do not provide basic education services, and in others, children only receive a fraction of the state-mandated instructional time, and classes are not based on a coherent curriculum.(Katherine Twomey, The right to Education in Juvenile Detention Under State Constitutions, p. 766). Some facilities do not have designated classrooms, libraries, or even books, and the teachers are often poorly trained, and are not trained in how to deal with special needs of children in detention. (Id. at 767.) Despite these shortcomings, there have been very few consequences to states for violating the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act, (Id. at 779.); therefore, states do not have much incentive to improve standards to achieve compliance. ===Mental health=== There is a long-standing connection found in research between youth who commit crimes and mental health concerns. A remarkably high population of juveniles present serious mental health illness within juvenile facilities. Since juvenile detention facilities operate on the foundation of rehabilitating the youth, different mental health programs are provided by facilities to help the youth rehabilitate. It is the expectation that juvenile detention centers and juvenile institutions provide mental health services to their residents. The incarcerated youth population requires careful and structured intervention, which must be provided by the facilities. Many different mental health treatment strategies exist for juveniles. It is the responsibility of case management to decide what type of intervention strategy works best for each youth in his or her mental health treatment plan. Mental health services that can be provided to the youth include, individual counseling, group counseling, crisis counseling, family intervention, medication management, and transition planning. ===Education=== Education is seen by many as the cornerstone of youth rehabilitation. Many landmark court cases, such as the 1981 case of Green v. Johnson, have given way to juveniles receiving their educational rights while incarcerated. Green v. Johnson (1981) ruled that incarcerated students do not have to give up their rights to an education while incarcerated. Despite research stating the need for strong educational programs in juvenile detention facilities, there does not exist a uniform standard for education in juvenile facilities as education settings in juvenile facilities greatly vary across the country. The overseer of the school within the juvenile facility differs from state to state. Some schools within juvenile detention facilities are decentralized, some are centralized and run by school districts, and others are overseen by a State education agency. ====Special education==== There is a large percentage of incarcerated juveniles who are diagnosed as students with special needs. Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), youths with disabilities in correctional facilities are entitled to special education and related services regardless of incarceration status. The Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) requires State Education Agencies to ensure that special education services are being provided at juvenile facilities. Being that there is a wide variety of juvenile detention and confinement facilities across the nation, the type and quality of special education services provided to the youth greatly varies. There has been a history of juveniles with disabilities not receiving their mandated accommodations and modifications. With the passing of IDEA in addition to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, juvenile correctional facilities have become seen as federally funded institutions and thus there prevails the mandated right to serve all students with disabilities as such institutions regardless if it is a short term or long term stay. There is a grave presence of juveniles who are classified as youth with disabilities. The disabilities most prevalent in incarcerated juveniles include mental retardation, learning disabilities, and emotional disturbances. Surveys and studies have found that a high number of incarcerated youth suffer from emotional disturbance disabilities as opposed to youth in general public schools. Even with key court decisions and acts, it has been found that a large number of juveniles held at both detention centers and confinement facilities are not being served the special education services they should be provided by law. It has been found that many juvenile detention institutions have struggling special education programs, especially for those centers that detain youth for short periods of time. ====Zero Tolerance Policies in Juvenile Court Schools==== Juvenile Court Schools provide public education for juveniles who are incarcerated in facilities run by county probation departments. These schools are located in juvenile halls, juvenile homes, day centers, ranches, camps, and regional youth education facilities and are operated by the county board of education. Even though court schools have the same school curriculum, they are often more strict in discipline that is more punitive than holistic. The most disadvantaged and \\"troubled\\" students are filling up schools in the juvenile justice system. These students are often further behind in credits and with more personal and structural problems than their counterparts at traditional schools. The majority of these teenagers struggle with learning disabilities, which ties with noticeable behavioral problems, and are experiencing emotional and psychological problems at home. Zero tolerance policies seem to be more strict in the juvenile justice system than in other traditional schools. In a juvenile court school, when a student violates a zero tolerance rule they automatically are prone to suspension and eventually going back to a detention center for its violation. In contrast, a student from a traditional school is more likely to get a second chance for its violation. Zero Tolerance policies are enforced in a greatly manner in juvenile court schools than in other traditional schools. The rules at Juvenile Court Schools are strict and are based on zero tolerance policies. Zero Tolerance Policies may serve more to \\"push students further out of school and into the school-to-prison pipeline than to re engage them\\".journal Kennedy-Lewis, B. (2015). Second Chance or No Chance? A Case Study of One Urban Alternative Middle School. Journal of Educational Change, 16(2), 145. Students are being harshly punished for minor incidents that should be fixed without having to involve severe consequences. Zero tolerance policies have taken over the role of education. The definition of Zero Tolerance Policies is described in the article, A Study of Zero Tolerance Policies in Schools: A Multi-Integrated Systems Approach to Improve Outcomes for Adolescents, as “…a widespread application to minor offenses can be attributed to the \\"Broken Windows\\" theory of crime. This theory analogizes the spread of crime to a few broken windows in a building that go un-repaired and consequently attract vagrants who break more windows and soon become squatters\\".journal Teske, S. C. (2011). A study of zero tolerance policies in schools: A multi‐integrated systems approach to improve outcomes for adolescents. Journal of Child And Adolescent Psychiatric Nursing, 24(2), 88-97 Stephen Hoffman in his article, \\"Zero Benefit: Estimating the Effect of Zero Tolerance Discipline Policies on Racial Disparities in School Discipline\\" states that, “...zero tolerance discipline policies are associated with poorer school climate, lower student achievement, higher dropout rates…”Hoffman, S. (2014). Zero Benefit: Estimating the Effect of Zero Tolerance Discipline Policies on Racial Disparities in School Discipline. Educational Policy, 28(1), 69. At Juvenile Court Schools, students are expected to follow a set of rules. The rules at the Court Schools differ from those at traditional schools; they are more punitive. ==Concerns and criticism== Juvenile detention centers and long-term confinement facilities have constantly been discussed and debated around two major concerns: overcrowding and ineffectiveness. As the number of juvenile cases has increased in the past 15 years, so has the number of juveniles spending time in secure and confined facilities. As a result, the systems have become overpopulated and overcrowded and many times this leads to the issue of too many residents and not enough empty beds. Overcrowding has been found to exist in many facilities for juveniles. In cases where the administration is not prepared to handle the large number of residents, overpopulation in juvenile detention centers and juvenile correctional facilities can occur to create instability and increased violence. Furthermore, overcrowding may also lead to the decrease in availability to provide the youth with much needed and promised programs and services while they are in the facility. If funding is an issue with a specific facility, overcrowding can reduce the availability of services such as education and mental health to all of the youth. In addition to overcrowding, juvenile secure facilities are questioned for their overall effectiveness in the bigger-picture life of the youth. What causes many critics to question the overall effectiveness of secure detention centers and confinement facilities is the high juvenile recidivism rate. If juvenile centers are to provide the basic needs of the youth it serves, another large criticism by many is that the centers fail to meet the basic educational, mental health, and necessary rehabilitative needs of the youth. Part of the reason why overall effectiveness is a concern for juvenile secure settings is also due to the belief that all special education services may not be upheld to all youth in need while staying in the facility. Additionally, many juvenile centers have been found to lack basic educational programs for the youth. Education is seen by many as a direct link to recidivism as is mental health needs of juveniles. Another area of concern in the bigger picture of juvenile facilities is the adequacy of mental health programs. It has been found that many juvenile facilities have well executed mental health programs for the youth. Some Youth Detention centers were known as \\"Gladiator Schools\\" by the wards who were incarcerated there. ==Systems== ===United States=== There were 45,567 total juveniles in detention facilities in 2016. 32,301 juveniles were in a public facility. 13,266 were in a private facility.JRFC Databook, accessed 22 August 2018. ====Connecticut==== In 1870, Long Lane School was built on donated land in Middletown. However, it became the Connecticut Juvenile Training School (CJTS) in 2003. CJTS is a treatment facility dedicated to delinquent boys from age 12–17. There have been numerous controversies and scandals associated with CJTS between 1998–2005. In 2005, Governor Jodi Rell attempted to close the facility, but it was instead reformed in 2008 by The Department of Children & Families. The new CJTS features a therapeutic model which was developed with assistance from The Boys & Girls Clubs of America. The school was shut down without replacement in 2018. ====District of Columbia==== The Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services (DYRS) is the District of Columbia's head juvenile justice agency and is responsible for placing DC community youth who are in its oversight in detention, commitment, and aftercare programs. DYRS's mission involves advancing the public safety and providing court-involved juveniles experiences and opportunities to better their lives and a become a better citizen and community member. Part of DYRS's vision is to place the youths in the least- restrictive environment possible for each case. At the foundation of the DYRS mission is its vision to provide court-involved youths and their families supportive programming to increase the lives of all involved. DYRS offers and operates a range of services and placements for their committed youth. The secure centers that DYRS operates are Youth Services Center (YSC) and New Beginnings Youth Development Center. YSC is the District's secure detention center. New Beginnings Youth Development Center is a secure confinement facility for the District's committed youth. YSC is operated by DYRS as the District of Columbia's secure juvenile detention center, which was opened in 2004. It is an 88-bed facility for male and female detained (not committed) youth who have been accused of delinquent acts and are awaiting their court hearings. YSC's meets the required needs of the youth it serves. Education services in YSC are provided by the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS), which delivers a range of services to the residents. The facility also provides programs and services to meet the essential mental health, emotional, physical, and social needs of the youth. YSC provides a secure and humane environment and coordinates all court meetings and team meetings for its youth. Above all else, YSC makes certain that the protection of the legal rights of the juveniles are being upheld. New Beginnings Youth Development Center is another secure DYRS operation. The center is a 60-bed, all-male secure center for DC's most serious youth delinquents. The $46 million facilityPierre, Robert E. \\"Oak Hill Center Emptied And Its Baggage Left Behind .\\" The Washington Post. Friday 29 May 2009.

New Beginnings replaced the Oak Hill Youth Center, which was located away in unincorporated Anne Arundel County. The main goal of New Beginnings is to provide residents with 24-hour supervision as well as programs and services that allow for successful transitions back into the DC community. The services provided include educational, recreation, medical, dental, and mental health programs. DYRS created a partnership with the See Forever Foundation to provide the educational services of Maya Angelou Academy for the residents. Behavioral health staff oversee the mental health programs. The facility is a 9–12-month program, which is modeled after the very successful Missouri Model. Maya Angelou Academy was founded in 2007, first at Oak Hill Youth Center, and now is the education program serving DYRS committed youth at New Beginnings Youth Development Center. Maya Angelou Academy is part of the Maya Angelou Charter School Network in the DC area. The academy provides a safe, structured, and intensive learning environment to the youth it serves at New Beginnings Youth Development Center. ====Pennsylvania==== PA Child Care is a detention center in Pennsylvania, USA. It was part of the Kids for cash scandal in which judges were given kickbacks in exchange for imposing harsh sentences on youth offenders so that the detention centers would get business. ==See also== *Boot camp *Reform School *Solitary confinement#Juveniles *Young offender Nation specific: *Australia **Punishment in Australia **Northern Territory ***Juvenile detention in the Northern Territory *United States **Juvenile delinquency in the United States **Youth incarceration in the United States *Youth Offending Team *Philippines **Children in jail in the Philippines *Indonesian children in Australian prisons ==References== ==External links== * \\"Children Behind Bars\\" – TIME * The National Center on Education, Disability and Juvenile Justice * The Closing of California's Most Violent Juvenile Prison * Gladiator School: Stories from Inside YTS * Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention * The Coalition for Juvenile Justice * Education Week: School Offers Model Lessons for D.C.'s Jailed Youths * Campaign for Youth Justice *National Center for Juvenile Justice *Department of Youth Rehabilitative Services *Justice Policy Institute *National Center for Mental Health and Juvenile Justice Category:Imprisonment and detention pl:Schronisko dla nieletnich ","title":"Youth detention center"},{"id":"2578677","text":"Antonio Nemesio Taylor Sánchez (December 19, 1935July 16, 2020) was a Cuban baseball second baseman who played nineteen seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB).

After spending two seasons with the organization, he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in 1960, the same year he was selected twice as an All-Star. He was subsequently dealt in mid-1971 to the Detroit Tigers, who released him after two seasons. He returned to the Phillies and played his last game on September 29, 1976. ==Early life== Taylor was born in Central Alava, Matanzas Province, on December 19, 1935. He was of American descent through his father, who died in 1957. His mother's parents were Chinese; they changed their name to Sánchez upon arrival in Cuba, Taylor's younger brother, Jorge, also played baseball with a minor league affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds in 1960. Taylor also had a sister (Estrella). He started playing baseball when he was seven or eight years old. He was signed as an amateur free agent by the New York Giants in April 1954. ==Professional career== Taylor posted a career .261 batting average with 75 home runs and 598 RBI in 2195 games. Taylor signed at age 18 as a third baseman in the New York Giants organization. He debuted in the major leagues with the Chicago Cubs in 1958; he was their starting second baseman in 1958 and 1959. Taylor had a small role in one of baseball history's weirdest plays. It took place on June 30, 1959, when the St. Louis Cardinals played the Cubs at Wrigley Field. Stan Musial was at the plate facing Bob Anderson with a count of 3–1. Anderson's next pitch was errant, the ball evaded catcher Sammy Taylor and rolled all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called \\"ball four\\", but Anderson and Sammy Taylor contended that Musial foul tipped the ball, which would mean the ball was still in play. While Delmore was embroiled in an argument with Anderson and Sammy Taylor, Musial ran for second base. Seeing that Musial was running to second, third baseman Alvin Dark retrieved the ball, which briefly wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark recovered it. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore produced a new baseball and gave it to Sammy Taylor. When Anderson saw Musial trying for second, he took the new ball from Sammy Taylor and threw it towards Tony Taylor covering second base, and the ball went over the latter's head into the outfield. Meanwhile, Dark threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see the throw and he was declared out when the tag was made. Taylor as a player with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1961 Taylor was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies along with Cal Neeman for Don Cardwell and Ed Bouchee early in the 1960 season. Despite the fact that Philadelphia was a mediocre team, Taylor established himself and was named to the National League All-Star team that year. A solid and dependable performer, Taylor set a Phillies team record by playing 1,003 games at second base (later broken by Chase Utley), and his six steals of home ranks him second on the Phillies' all-time list. Taylor appeared on a live satellite broadcast feed on July 23, 1962, in the first live transatlantic broadcast, relayed by Telstar in the 20 minutes that it orbited over the Atlantic Ocean. As lead-in filler before a speech by President John F. Kennedy, a 90-second clip of a game between the Phillies and the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, featuring Taylor hitting a ball pitched by Cal Koonce to right fielder George Altman, was captured and broadcast live to Europe. In 1963, Taylor hit .281 and collected career highs in runs (102) and hits (182), and the next season, he made the defensive play that saved Jim Bunning's perfect game. In 1970, he hit a career-high .301 average with 26 doubles, nine triples and nine homers. Dealt to the Detroit Tigers in the 1971 midseason, Taylor helped them to a division title a year later. A free agent before the 1974 season, he signed again with the Phillies and became a valuable utility man and pinch hitter for his final three major league seasons. ==Later life== After retiring as a player, Taylor became a major league coach for the Phillies from 1977 to 1979, and again from 1988 to 1989. In the intervening time, he was manager in the organization's minor league system and a roving instructor. He served as a minor league coach with the Giants starting in 1990. Two years later, he became minor league coordinator of the Florida Marlins, before becoming their major league coach from 1999 to 2001, and again in 2004. Taylor was enshrined in the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame in 1981. He was subsequently inducted into the Philadelphia Phillies Wall of Fame in 2002, and the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame two years later. Taylor died on July 16, 2020, at the age of 84. He had suffered a stroke one year before at the conclusion of an event for retired players at Citizens Bank Park, and died due to complications arising from it. ==See also== * 1972 American League Championship Series * List of Major League Baseball career hits leaders * List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders * List of Major League Baseball players from Cuba * List of Major League Baseball career runs scored leaders ==References== ==External links== *Tony Taylor at SABR (Baseball BioProject) *Tony Taylor at Baseball Almanac *Tony Taylor at Baseball Library Category:1935 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Dallas Eagles players Category:Danville Leafs players Category:Afro- Cuban Category:Deaths from cerebrovascular disease Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Florida Marlins coaches Category:Major League Baseball bullpen coaches Category:Major League Baseball first base coaches Category:Major League Baseball players from Cuba Category:Major League Baseball second basemen Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:National League All-Stars Category:Philadelphia Phillies coaches Category:Philadelphia Phillies players Category:Place of death missing Category:Reading Phillies managers Category:St. Cloud Rox players Category:Texas City Pilots players Category:Cuban people of Jamaican descent Category:Cuban expatriate baseball people Category:Cuban emigrants to the United States ","title":"Tony Taylor (baseball)"},{"id":"2578686","text":"The William Clapp House (1806) is a historic house located at 195 Boston Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts.

Weinberg was born in New York City and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a B.A. in History. She has completed all course work for a Master of Public Administration from Fairleigh Dickinson University. ===Run for State Senate=== Weinberg ran for the New Jersey Senate after fellow District 37 legislator Byron Baer resigned from the Senate on September 8, 2005. From the outset of his term, the resignation of the often-ailing Baer had been the subject of much speculation and maneuvering. In a January 7, 2004 article for PoliticsNJ.com, political reporter Steve Kornacki wrote, \\"Depending on whom you listen to, the 74-year- old Baer will step down sometime between the next few months and January 2008, when his term expires.\\" Kornacki identified a number of \\"potential successors\\" to Baer, including Hackensack Police Chief and former Assemblyman Charles \\"Ken\\" Zisa, who had briefly mounted a challenge to Baer's 2003 re-nomination before withdrawing it in what some have said was a deal brokered by Bergen County Democratic Organization Chairman Joe Ferriero; Bergen County Freeholder Valerie Huttle; Englewood Mayor Michael Wildes; and Weinberg. \\"But,\\" wrote Kornacki, \\"whether Weinberg, who backed Zisa in his brief bid to topple Baer last year, does want it [the Senate seat] is an open question.\\" Sixteen months later, that question appeared to have been answered. In a May 3, 2005 PoliticsNJ.com article, Kornacki reported, \\"Weinberg essentially admitted to striking a deal with Ferriero. She said the chairman agreed to back her for [Assembly] majority leader, while she pledged to support a candidate of his choosing to replace state Senator Byron Barer when the 75-year-old steps down...some say she also had pledged support to Valerie Vainieri Huttle, a freeholder, for the Senate spot.\\" Following Baer's resignation, Ferriero backed Zisa to fill the vacancy, as expected. Huttle prepared to challenge Zisa for the nomination. Weinberg then let it be known she was interested, and on September 11, 2005, United States Senator Jon Corzine, the Democratic candidate for Governor of New Jersey, endorsed Weinberg for Baer's seat. Huttle bowed out of the race and endorsed Weinberg. The Bergen County Democratic Organization caucused on September 15, 2005, to select a candidate. In balloting to replace Baer on an interim basis, Weinberg lost by a 114-110 margin to Zisa. In a separate vote, by a 112-111 margin, Zisa was selected over Weinberg to be the party's candidate on the November ballot. Though she congratulated Zisa in remarks made after results were announced at the September 15 caucus, Weinberg stated that inclusion of several uncounted ballots might change the results in her favor.Jones, Richard Lezin. \\" After Democratic Squabble, Corzine Ally Loses Bid to Fill State Senate Seat\\", The New York Times, September 16, 2005. Accessed April 1, 2008. Weinberg filed a legal challenge to the caucus results to have the unopened ballots included, which she believed were cast for her. On September 20, 2005, New Jersey Superior Court Judge Peter Doyne refused to interfere in what he held was a party matter and upheld the decision of the election mediator, Rep. Steve Rothman, to exclude the five ballots. On September 23, 2005, an Appellate Court panel sent the case back to Judge Doyne, ruling that he did have the authority to address a party issue and that the five uncounted ballots cast by Tenafly Democratic Committee members could be counted irrespective of the failure to file their names within the specified 30-day window. Zisa announced on September 26, 2005, that he would appeal the Appellate panel's decision to the New Jersey Supreme Court. Judge Doyne's hearing on September 28 to readdress the issues was underway when the Supreme Court issued a ruling upholding the Appellate Court's decision and affirming that the 30-day rule for submission of new County Committee members could not be enforced. Judge Doyne decided on October 3, 2005, in Weinberg's favor, ruling that ballots from the \\"Tenafly Five\\" should be counted.Fallon, Scott. \\"Judge's ruling clears Weinberg's way to Senate\\", The Record (Bergen County), October 4, 2005.

The \\"Tenafly Five\\" ballots were opened by Judge Peter Doyne, and each ballot was cast for Loretta Weinberg, thus giving her the slim margin of victory. Weinberg defeated Zisa by one vote in balloting to fill Baer's vacated seat on an interim basis, 115-114, and won the contest for the Democratic ballot spot in November, by a total of 116-112.Fallon, Scott. \\"Opened ballots confirm Senate victory\\", The Record (Bergen County), October 6, 2005.

Born in Steyninghttp://www.britannica.com in East Sussex and educated at Whitgift School in Croydon, Harman had six brothers and five sisters. At the age of 16, he left school to work for Lazard, and became an influential figure in early 20th-century corporate finance in the City of London. In June 1919, Harman moved to Chaldon, Surrey, where he lived with his wife Amy Ruth Harman (née Bodger) and their four children. In 1926, he donated land he owned in the village to the National Trust which was subsequently named \\"Six Brothers Field\\" at his request. Harman bought Lundy island and its supply boat the MV Lerina in 1925 for £25,000 (approx. £1,500,000 in 2019). In 1927, the GPO ended postal services to the island. For the next two years, Harman handled, and covered the costs of all the island's postage himself. On 1 November 1929, Harman introduced his own \\"Puffin\\" stamps to offset this cost. One Puffin is equivalent to one English penny, and printing of the stamps continues today covering the cost of shipping to the mainland, and postage in the UK and abroad. He later issued an independent Lundy currency of half Puffin and one Puffin coins, which were nominally equivalent to the British halfpenny and penny. This resulted in his prosecution by UK authorities for issuing illegal coinage under the Coinage Act 1870. He was found guilty in 1931, and was fined £5 with fifteen guineas (£15 15s) expenses. The coins were withdrawn and have since become collectors' items. In 1928, Harman established the Lundy pony. By 1928, Harman controlled a portfolio of companies worth an estimated £12 million. However, in 1931, his wife Amy died of kidney failure aged 47, and one year later Harman was declared bankrupt. As Lundy had been held in trust, Harman was able to keep his ownership of the island despite his bankruptcy. In November 1933, Harman was found guilty on charges of conspiracy to defraud in connection with a Korean syndicate, and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Harman's son, John Pennington Harman was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross in Kohima, India in 1944.

It is one of the oldest Christian religious centres in Western Europe. The abbey was a focal point for the spread of Christianity throughout Scotland and marks the foundation of a monastic community by St. Columba, when Iona was part of the Kingdom of Dál Riata. Saint Aidan served as a monk at Iona, before helping to reestablish Christianity in Northumberland, on the island of Lindisfarne Iona Abbey is the spiritual home of the Iona Community, an ecumenical Christian religious order, whose headquarters are in Glasgow. The Abbey remains a popular site of Christian pilgrimage today. ==History== ===Early history=== In 563, Columba came to Iona from Ireland with twelve companions, and founded a monastery. It developed as an influential centre for the spread of Christianity among the Picts and Scots. At this time the name of the island and so the abbey was \\"Hy\\" or \\"Hii\\"; \\"Iona\\" only seems to date from the 14th century, as a mis-transcription of a Latinized \\"Ioua\\" for \\"Hy\\".Meyvaert, 7-8 ====Lifestyle and practice==== The prime purpose of the monastery was to create 'a perfect monastery as an image of the heavenly city of Jerusalem' – Columba wanted to 'represent the pinnacle of Christian virtues, as an example for others to emulate' - rather than explicitly missionary activity.Iona Official Guide, published by Historic Scotland, 2018 The monks worshipped and worked daily, following Celtic Christianity practices and disciplines. They also managed assets and were involved with the local and wider community. ====Construction and buildings==== Like other Celtic Christian monasteries, Columba's monastery would have been made up of a number of wattle and timber, or wood and thatch, buildings. These would have included a central church or oratory, the common refectory or kitchen, the library or scriptorium, monk cells or dormitories, and a guest house for visitors including pilgrims. It is believed that around 800AD the original wooden chapel was replaced by a stone chapel. Columba's monastery was surrounded by a ditch and earth bank, part of which is believed to have pre-existed Columba's arrival, and part of which can still be seen to the north west of the current abbey buildings. Columba's day room Adomnán describes a building on a small mound, Torr an Aba, in the monastery grounds where St Columba worked and wrote. Charred wood has been dated from what is believed to be this site, and a socket to hold a cross (which is believed to have been erected later) is visible there. ====Manuscript and book production==== The production of Christian manuscripts, books and annals was an important activity in the Iona monastery. The Chronicle of Ireland was produced at Iona until about 740. The Book of Kells, an illuminated manuscript, is believed to have been produced by the monks of Iona in the years leading up to 800. Book of Kells: This page (folio 292r) contains the lavishly decorated text that opens the Gospel of John ====Stone crosses==== Stone crosses, both standing and lying, were used to mark graves in the Iona monastery. Large stone crosses were also erected, perhaps to broadcast key Christian messages, particularly in 800-1000. Their design reflected precious metal crosses. Some were carved from stone imported 50 miles by boat from Loch Sween. ====Other technology==== Remains of wood- turning and metal-working have been found at Iona, and of glass (windows and beads) that may date from the 7th century. ====Trade==== The Iona monastery's position in what was then a well-used seaway would have facilitated trade, as would St Columba's personal aristocratic background. Pigments from the south of France were used in Iona. ====Viking attacks, and subsequent movement between Abbeys==== The Iona Abbey was first attacked by Viking raiders in 795, with subsequent attacks taking place in 802, 806, and 825.Yeoman, Peter (2014). Iona Abbey and Nunnery, p. 61. Historic Scotland, Edinburgh. During the 806 Viking attack, 68 monks were massacred in Martyrs' Bay, and this led to many of the Columban monks relocating to the new Columban Abbey of Kells in Ireland. The building at Kells took from 807 until the consecration of the church in 814. In 814, Cellach, Abbot of Iona, retired to Kells, but, contrary to what is sometimes claimed, it is clear from the Annals that Iona remained the main Columban house for several decades, despite the danger of Viking raids.Meyvaert, 11 In 825, St Blathmac and those monks who remained with him at Iona were martyred in a Viking raid, and the Abbey was burned. But only in 878 were the main relics, with Columba's reliquary shrine specified in the records, moved to Ireland, with Kells becoming the new main Columban house. Though not mentioned, this might well have been when the Book of Kells came to Kells. However, Iona Abbey was probably not deserted as its continued importance is shown by the death there in 980 of Amlaíb Cuarán, a retired King of Dublin. St Columba established several monasteries, although he was mainly based at Iona. Other monks from Iona moved to the Continent, and established monasteries in Belgium, France, and Switzerland. ===Benedictine abbey=== In 1114 Iona was seized by the King of Norway, who held it for fifty years before Somerled recaptured it, and invited renewed Irish involvement in 1164: this led to the construction of the central part of the cathedral. Ranald, Somerled's son, now the 'Lord of the Isles', in 1203 invited the Benedictine order to establish a new monastery, and an Augustinian Nunnery, on the Columban Monastery's foundations. Building work began on the new abbey church, on the site of Columba's original church.Information boards at Iona Abbey. Historic Scotland The following year, in 1204, the site was raided by a force led by two Irish bishops. This was a response by Ireland's Columban clergy to the loss of its connections and influence at this significant site founded by St Columba.Yeoman, Peter (2014). Iona Abbey and Nunnery, p. 64. Historic Scotland, Edinburgh. View of the Abbey remains in the late 19th century, showing the Church and claustral buildings as roofless ruins. The Iona Nunnery, a foundation of the Augustinian Order (one of only two in Scotland - the other is in Perth), was established south of the abbey buildings. Graves of some of the early nuns remain, including that of a remarkable prioress, Anna Maclean, who died in 1543. Clearly visible under her outer robe is the rochet, a pleated surplice denoting the Augustinian Order. The nunnery buildings were rebuilt in the fifteenth century and fell into disrepair after the Reformation. The abbey church was substantially expanded in the fifteenth century, but following the Scottish Reformation, Iona along with numerous other abbeys throughout the British Isles were dismantled, and abandoned, their monks and libraries dispersed.

The medieval church Engraving of the ruined abbey church in 1761 ===Modern abbey=== In 1899 the Duke of Argyll transferred ownership of the ruined remains of the Abbey and Nunnery sites to the Iona Cathedral Trust, which undertook extensive restoration of the Abbey church. In 1938, the inspiration of Reverend George MacLeod led a group which rebuilt the abbey, and founded the Iona Community. The reconstruction was organised by the architect Ian Gordon Lindsay having generously been passed the project from his senior mentor and friend Reginald Fairlie.National Dictionary of Scottish Architects:Reginald Fairlie. The surrounding buildings were also re-constructed during the 20th century by the Iona Community. This ecumenical Christian community continues to use the site to this day. The simple square font was added in 1908 and dedicated to the memory of the Very Rev Theodore Marshall DD, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in that year. In 2000 the Iona Cathedral Trust handed over the care of the Abbey, Nunnery, and associated sites to Historic Scotland.Yeoman, Peter (2014). Iona Abbey and Nunnery, p. 69.

St. Martin's Cross outside the abbey. } Many early Scottish kings (said to be 48 in total), as well as kings from Ireland, Norway and France, are said to be buried in the Abbey graveyard. However, modern scholars are sceptical of such claims, which were likely mythic associated with increasing the prestige of Iona. Numerous leading Hebrideans, such as various Lords of the Isles and other prominent members of West Highland clans, were buried on Iona, including several early MacLeod chiefs. The site was much loved by John Smith, 20th- century leader of the Labour Party, who was buried on Iona after his death in 1994. Several high crosses are found on the island of Iona. St Martin's Cross (dated to the 8th century) still stands by the roadside. A replica of St John's Cross is found by the doorway of the Abbey. The restored original is located in the Infirmary Museum at the rear of the abbey. The contemporary Jedburgh-based sculptor Christopher Hall worked for many years on carvings on the cloisters of the abbey, which represent birds, flora and fauna native to the island. He also was commissioned to carve John Smith's gravestone. ==Media and the arts== Iona Abbey is mentioned in Tori Amos' song \\"Twinkle\\" from her 1996 album Boys for Pele: \\"And last time I knew, she worked at an abbey in Iona.

It does not include nominally private spaces which are open to the public, such as bars, restaurants and stadiums. The purpose of these laws is to restrict public intoxication, especially the dangerous act of operating a vehicle while intoxicated. Open container laws are state laws, rather than federal laws; thus they vary from state to state. == Open containers in public == The majority of U.S. states and localities prohibit possessing and/or consuming an open container of alcohol in public places, such as on the street, while 24 states do not have statutes regarding public consumption of alcohol. However, the definition of \\"public place\\" is not always clear. California is unique in that it does have a state law on the books, but similar to states that have no law, the state law only applies to areas in which the \\"city, county, or city and county have enacted an ordinance\\". Open container restrictions are not always rigorously enforced, and open containers may in fact be legally permitted in nominally private events which are open to the public. This is especially true in downtown districts and during holidays and sporting events; see tailgate party. === Places where legal === There are public places in the United States where open containers are explicitly permitted: * Hood River, Oregon. This port city that rests along the Columbia River has no open container laws, and allows drinking in public. * The city of Butte, Montana, prohibits open containers only between 2am and 8am. Drinking openly in the street is allowed throughout the city (and elsewhere in Montana where no local laws exist) during the other 18 hours of the day. A recent attempt to pass a comprehensive open container prohibition in Butte met with widespread opposition and was dropped. However, Montana state law does prohibit open containers in vehicles on a highway. * In the Power & Light District of Kansas City, Missouri, a special Missouri state lawSection 311.086, Revised Statutes of Missouri preempts Kansas City's ordinary local law against open containersSections 10-134 and 10-135, Kansas City Code of Ordinances and allows the possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages on the street in open plastic containers.Rick Alm, \\"Drinking to be allowed on street in Power & Light District,\\" The Kansas City Star, July 27, 2005 Although Missouri has no statewide open container law, the Power & Light District remains the only part of Kansas City where open containers are allowed actually on the street, and throughout the rest of Kansas City, open containers remain expressly prohibited. * In unincorporated Clark County, Nevada (including the Las Vegas Strip) the laws allow the possession and consumption on the street of alcoholic beverages except within parking lots or, if the alcohol was purchased in a closed container, on the premises of or within 1000 feet of the store from which it was purchased. It is also illegal to possess a glass or aluminum beverage container on specially designated streets during special events, such as the Strip on New Year's Eve. * The city of New Orleans, Louisiana allows the possession and consumption on the street of any alcoholic beverage in an open plastic container (not in glass bottles or containers). In some parts of Louisiana, however, open containers are still prohibited, despite the fact that drive-thru frozen daiquiri stands are legal.See Louisiana Revised Statutes 32:300(B)(3)(b). * In the Savannah Historic District of downtown Savannah, Georgia, city law allows possession and consumption on the street of one alcoholic beverage in an open plastic container of not more than 16 ounces.Savannah City Code Section 6-1215 Because Georgia has no state public open container law, the city law governs. Throughout the rest of Savannah, however, open containers remain prohibited. * Within an approximately 80-acre area of downtown Dalton, Georgia, city law allows possession and consumption on the street of one alcoholic beverage in an open paper or plastic cup of no more than 16 ounces between 12:30 p.m. and midnight. The boundaries of the permitted area are Hawthorne Street, the western right-of-way of the L&N; Railway, Morris Street, and Thornton Avenue. The beverage must be dispensed by a licensed establishment in the designated area in a cup that meets specifications issued by the Downtown Dalton Development Authority. Throughout the rest of Dalton, however, open containers remain prohibited. * The town of Fredericksburg, Texas allows open containers of beer or wine (no liquor) in its Main street shopping district. * The state of Ohio, since 2015, allows cities to create a limited number of designated \\"outdoor refreshment areas\\" where alcoholic beverages are permitted (Sub. H.B. No. 47). Cities that have created these districts include Canton, Delaware, Hamilton, Lancaster, Lorain, Middletown and Toledo. * The city of Mobile, Alabama allows open plastic containers with a commercially printed name and/or logo of a designated licensee.PRESCOTTE STOKES III, Open-container enforcement will get stricter in Downtown Mobile July 13, 2016 * The city of Tampa, Florida allows up to two drinks in plastic containers per person on the Tampa Riverwalk, purchased from one of the licensed facilities along it, between 11am and 1am. * As of August 28th, 2020, Governor Phil Murphy has signed a bill making public drinking allowed in tourist spots such as the beach and boardwalk of Atlantic City, New Jersey Indiana actually has no restrictions on the open carrying of alcohol in public spaces.

(accessed November 16, 2009). Tanton, James. \\"homogeneous.\\" Encyclopedia of Mathematics. New York: Facts On File, Inc., 2005. Science Online. Facts On File, Inc. \\"A polynomial in several variables p(x,y,z,…) is called homogeneous [...] more generally, a function of several variables f(x,y,z,…) is homogeneous [...] Identifying homogeneous functions can be helpful in solving differential equations [and] any formula that represents the mean of a set of numbers is required to be homogeneous. In physics, the term homogeneous describes a substance or an object whose properties do not vary with position. For example, an object of uniform density is sometimes described as homogeneous.\\" James. homogeneous (math). (accessed: 2009-11-16) A uniform electric field (which has the same strength and the same direction at each point) would be compatible with homogeneity (all points experience the same physics). A material constructed with different constituents can be described as effectively homogeneous in the electromagnetic materials domain, when interacting with a directed radiation field (light, microwave frequencies, etc.).Homogeneity. Merriam- webster.comHomogeneous. Merriam-webster.com Mathematically, homogeneity has the connotation of invariance, as all components of the equation have the same degree of value whether or not each of these components are scaled to different values, for example, by multiplication or addition. Cumulative distribution fits this description. \\"The state of having identical cumulative distribution function or values\\". ==Context== The definition of homogeneous strongly depends on the context used. For example, a composite material is made up of different individual materials, known as \\"constituents\\" of the material, but may be defined as a homogeneous material when assigned a function. For example, asphalt paves our roads, but is a composite material consisting of asphalt binder and mineral aggregate, and then laid down in layers and compacted. However, homogeneity of materials does not necessarily mean isotropy. In the previous example, a composite material may not be isotropic. In another context, a material is not homogeneous in so far as it is composed of atoms and molecules. However, at the normal level of our everyday world, a pane of glass, or a sheet of metal is described as glass, or stainless steel. In other words, these are each described as a homogeneous material. A few other instances of context are: Dimensional homogeneity (see below) is the quality of an equation having quantities of same units on both sides; Homogeneity (in space) implies conservation of momentum; and homogeneity in time implies conservation of energy. ===Homogeneous alloy=== In the context of composite metals is an alloy. A blend of a metal with one or more metallic or nonmetallic materials is an alloy. The components of an alloy do not combine chemically but, rather, are very finely mixed. An alloy might be homogeneous or might contain small particles of components that can be viewed with a microscope. Brass is an example of an alloy, being a homogeneous mixture of copper and zinc. Another example is steel, which is an alloy of iron with carbon and possibly other metals. The purpose of alloying is to produce desired properties in a metal that naturally lacks them. Brass, for example, is harder than copper and has a more gold-like color. Steel is harder than iron and can even be made rust proof (stainless steel).Rosen, Joe. \\"Alloy.\\" Encyclopedia of Physics. New York: Facts On File, Inc., 2004. Science Online. Facts On File, Inc. accessed 2009-11-16 ===Homogeneous cosmology=== Homogeneity, in another context plays a role in cosmology. From the perspective of 19th-century cosmology (and before), the universe was infinite, unchanging, homogeneous, and therefore filled with stars. However, German astronomer Heinrich Olbers asserted that if this were true, then the entire night sky would be filled with light and bright as day; this is known as Olbers' paradox. Olbers presented a technical paper in 1826 that attempted to answer this conundrum. The faulty premise, unknown in Olbers' time, was that the universe is not infinite, static, and homogeneous. The Big Bang cosmology replaced this model (expanding, finite, and inhomogeneous universe). However, modern astronomers supply reasonable explanations to answer this question. One of at least several explanations is that distant stars and galaxies are red shifted, which weakens their apparent light and makes the night sky dark.Todd, Deborah, and Joseph A. Angelo Jr. \\"Olbers, Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus.\\" A to Z of Scientists in Space and Astronomy. New York: Facts on File, Inc., 2005. Science Online. Facts On File, Inc. Olbers, Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus (accessed 2009-11-16) However, the weakening is not sufficient to actually explain Olbers' paradox. Many cosmologists think that the fact that the Universe is finite in time, that is that the Universe has not been around forever, is the solution to the paradox. The fact that the night sky is dark is thus an indication for the Big Bang. ==Translation invariance== By translation invariance, one means independence of (absolute) position, especially when referring to a law of physics, or to the evolution of a physical system. Fundamental laws of physics should not (explicitly) depend on position in space. That would make them quite useless. In some sense, this is also linked to the requirement that experiments should be reproducible. This principle is true for all laws of mechanics (Newton's laws, etc.), electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, etc. In practice, this principle is usually violated, since one studies only a small subsystem of the universe, which of course \\"feels\\" the influence of the rest of the universe. This situation gives rise to \\"external fields\\" (electric, magnetic, gravitational, etc.) which make the description of the evolution of the system depend upon its position (potential wells, etc.). This only stems from the fact that the objects creating these external fields are not considered as (a \\"dynamical\\") part of the system. Translational invariance as described above is equivalent to shift invariance in system analysis, although here it is most commonly used in linear systems, whereas in physics the distinction is not usually made. The notion of isotropy, for properties independent of direction, is not a consequence of homogeneity. For example, a uniform electric field (i.e., which has the same strength and the same direction at each point) would be compatible with homogeneity (at each point physics will be the same), but not with isotropy, since the field singles out one \\"preferred\\" direction. ===Consequences=== In the Lagrangian formalism, homogeneity in space implies conservation of momentum, and homogeneity in time implies conservation of energy. This is shown, using variational calculus, in standard textbooks like the classical reference text of Landau & Lifshitz. This is a particular application of Noether's theorem. ==Dimensional homogeneity== As said in the introduction, dimensional homogeneity is the quality of an equation having quantities of same units on both sides. A valid equation in physics must be homogeneous, since equality cannot apply between quantities of different nature. This can be used to spot errors in formula or calculations. For example, if one is calculating a speed, units must always combine to [length]/[time]; if one is calculating an energy, units must always combine to [mass]•[length]²/[time]², etc. For example, the following formulae could be valid expressions for some energy: :E_k = \\\\frac 12 m v^2 ;~~ E = m c^2 ;~~ E = p v ; ~~ E = hc/\\\\lambda if m is a mass, v and c are velocities, p is a momentum, h is Planck's constant, λ a length. On the other hand, if the units of the right hand side do not combine to [mass]•[length]2/[time]2, it cannot be a valid expression for some energy. Being homogeneous does not necessarily mean the equation will be true, since it does not take into account numerical factors. For example, E = m•v2 could be or could not be the correct formula for the energy of a particle of mass m traveling at speed v, and one cannot know if h•c/λ should be divided or multiplied by 2π. Nevertheless, this is a very powerful tool in finding characteristic units of a given problem, see dimensional analysis. Theoretical physicists tend to express everything in natural units given by constants of nature, for example by taking c = ħ = k = 1; once this is done, one partly loses the possibility of the above checking. ==See also== *Translational invariance *Miscibility *Phase (matter) ==References== Category:Dimensional analysis Category:Concepts in physics ","title":"Homogeneity (physics)"},{"id":"2578754","text":"The Kiriyama Prize was an international literary award awarded to books about the Pacific Rim and South Asia.

It has been around almost as long as the Amiga itself, although it was not initially called by any particular name. Before it was known as ADF, it was used in commercial game production, backup and disk virtualization. ADF is a track-by-track dump of the disk data as read by the Amiga operating system, and so the \\"format\\" is really fixed-width AmigaDOS data tracks appended one after another and held in a file. This file would, typically, be formatted, like the disk, in OFS. == ADF == Most ADF files are plain images of the Amiga-formatted tracks held on cylinder 0 to 79 of a standard 3.5-inch double-density floppy disk, also called an 880 KiB disk in Amiga terms. The size of an ADF will vary depending on how many tracks have been imaged, but in practice it is unusual to find ADF files that are not 901,120 bytes in size (80 cylinders × 2 heads × 11 sectors × 512 bytes/sector). Most Amiga programs were distributed on double-density floppy disks. There are also 3.5-inch high-density floppy disks, which hold up to 1.76 MB of data, but these are uncommon. The Amiga also had 5.25-inch double- density disks. The WinUAE Amiga emulator supports all three disk formats, but 3.5-inch double-density is the most common. ADF files can be downloaded and copied to Amiga disks with the EasyADF application and various applications freely available on the Internet. As they are plain disk images, they can be handled by the unix tool dd. On Linux and NetBSD, which support the most common Amiga filesystems, ADF files can be mounted directly. There is a program called ADF Opus, which is a Microsoft Windows-based program that allows people to create their own ADF files. This program supports creating double density (880 KB ADF files, the most common) and high-density (1.76 MB) ADF files. ADF Opus also allows people to convert ADF files into ADZ files. There is also a GPL command line program called unADF, which allows you to extract files from an ADF file. The part of utility pack amitools contains a set of programs named xdftool. It is under GPL and can read, write, format, and do other operations with ADF-images. == ADZ == An ADZ file is an ADF file that has been compressed with gzip. The typical file extension is \\".adz\\", derived from \\".adf.gz\\". == IPF == The ADF file format can only store disks that have legal AmigaDOS format tracks. Disks with non-standard tracks may be available in ADF format, albeit cracked in order to create a regular AmigaDOS volume. However, the Amiga itself was not limited to storing data in these standard tracks. The Amiga's floppy disk controller was very basic but transparent, and for that reason very flexible allowing disks of other and custom formats to be read and written as well. Disk handling is not locked down like the one in a modern PC, and so most of the work to read and write disks is done by the operating system itself. 070820 softpres.org However, because programmers did not have to use the operating system routines, it was quite normal for games developers to create their own disk formats 070820 softpres.org and also apply many different sorts of copy protection. 070820 softpres.org As it was, most full-price commercial Amiga games had some form of custom disk format and/or copy protection on them. For this reason, most commercial Amiga games cannot be stored in ADF files unaltered, but there is an alternative called Interchangeable Preservation Format (IPF) which was specifically designed for this purpose. The Software Preservation Society Interchangeable Preservation Format (.IPF) is an open format for which the source code of the official library is available.http://forum.kryoflux.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t;=265 == DMS == ADF files were sometimes compressed using the Disk Masher System, resulting in .dms files. == FDI == FDI (from Formatted Disk Image) is a universal disk image file format specification originally published by Vincent Joguin in 2000. The FDI format is publicly documented, 20111011 oldskool.org and accompanied by open source access tools. Because the format can store raw low- level data, as is for example required to support copy protection schemes and other non-standard formats, FDI files can be larger than disk image files in other formats. The typical file extension is \\".fdi\\". Because of the universal design of the FDI format, files in other disk image formats, such as ADF, ADZ and DMS, can in theory be converted to FDI. == See also == * Floppy disk == References == ;Notes * The .ADF (Amiga Disk File) format FAQ * The Amiga Guru Book, Chapter 15, Ralph Babel, 1993 * Rom Kernel Reference Manual : Hardware, pages 235-244, Addison Wesley * Rom Kernel Reference Manual : Libraries and Devices, Appendix C, Addison Wesley * La Bible de l'Amiga, Dittrich/Gelfand/Schemmel, Data Becker, 1988.

In statistics, homogeneity and its opposite, heterogeneity, arise in describing the properties of a dataset, or several datasets. They relate to the validity of the often convenient assumption that the statistical properties of any one part of an overall dataset are the same as any other part. In meta-analysis, which combines the data from several studies, homogeneity measures the differences or similarities between the several studies (see also Study heterogeneity). Homogeneity can be studied to several degrees of complexity. For example, considerations of homoscedasticity examine how much the variability of data- values changes throughout a dataset. However, questions of homogeneity apply to all aspects of the statistical distributions, including the location parameter. Thus, a more detailed study would examine changes to the whole of the marginal distribution. An intermediate-level study might move from looking at the variability to studying changes in the skewness. In addition to these, questions of homogeneity apply also to the joint distributions. The concept of homogeneity can be applied in many different ways and, for certain types of statistical analysis, it is used to look for further properties that might need to be treated as varying within a dataset once some initial types of non- homogeneity have been dealt with. ==Examples== ===Regression=== Differences in the typical values across the dataset might initially be dealt with by constructing a regression model using certain explanatory variables to relate variations in the typical value to known quantities. There should then be a later stage of analysis to examine whether the errors in the predictions from the regression behave in the same way across the dataset. Thus the question becomes one of the homogeneity of the distribution of the residuals, as the explanatory variables change. See regression analysis. ===Time series=== The initial stages in the analysis of a time series may involve plotting values against time to examine homogeneity of the series in various ways: stability across time as opposed to a trend; stability of local fluctuations over time. ===Combining information across sites=== In hydrology, data-series across a number of sites composed of annual values of the within-year annual maximum river-flow are analysed. A common model is that the distributions of these values are the same for all sites apart from a simple scaling factor, so that the location and scale are linked in a simple way. There can then be questions of examining the homogeneity across sites of the distribution of the scaled values. ===Combining information sources=== In meteorology, weather datasets are acquired over many years of record and, as part of this, measurements at certain stations may cease occasionally while, at around the same time, measurements may start at nearby locations. There are then questions as to whether, if the records are combined to form a single longer set of records, those records can be considered homogeneous over time. An example of homogeneity testing of wind speed and direction data can be found in Romanić et al., 2015.Romanić D. Ćurić M- Jovičić I. Lompar M. 2015. Long-term trends of the ‘Koshava’ wind during the period 1949–2010. International Journal of Climatology 35(2):288-302. DOI:10.1002/joc.3981. ===Homogeneity within populations=== Simple populations surveys may start from the idea that responses will be homogeneous across the whole of a population. Assessing the homogeneity of the population would involve looking to see whether the responses of certain identifiable subpopulations differ from those of others. For example, car-owners may differ from non-car-owners, or there may be differences between different age-groups. ==Tests== A test for homogeneity, in the sense of exact equivalence of statistical distributions, can be based on an E-statistic. A location test tests the simpler hypothesis that distributions have the same location parameter. ==See also== *Homogeneity and heterogeneity describes uses of this terminology in wider contexts ==References== * Hall, M.J.

The contingent fought alongside the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) and included George Orwell, who subsequently wrote about his experiences in his personal account Homage to Catalonia. ==Contingent membership== The main body of the ILP contingent consisting of about 25 men departed from England on 1 January 1937, under the leadership of Bob Edwards, later a Member of Parliament for the Labour Party. The ILP had begun organising volunteers in November 1936 following the return to Britain of Bob Edwards from delivering an ambulance sent by the ILP for the POUM militia. Though there had been five times the number of volunteers, the ILP would only accept unmarried men for its contingent and 25 men left Britain on 8 January as the vanguard of a larger force to be sent later. However, the day after the contingent left, the British government announced that it would prosecute anyone going to fight in Spain and the ILP did not try to recruit any more volunteers.Durgan, Andy “International Volunteers in the POUM Militias” On arriving in Barcelona, they had two weeks of very basic training, and were joined by Bob Smillie, grandson of the well-known Scottish socialist and miners' leader of the same name. Smillie had been in Barcelona working with John McNair as the representative Youth section of the International Bureau for Revolutionary Socialist Unity. However, he became convinced that he would be of most service at the front and persuaded McNair to let him sign up when the ILP contingent came over. He later died in Valencia. The ILP contingent was attached to the POUM’s English-speaking contingent, as part of the centuria commanded by Georges Kopp. Once at the front, the initial group of twenty-five was sent to the front at Monte Oscuro, within sight of Zaragoza, some 12 miles to the south west, where they joined by a number of others who had arrived at the front a few weeks earlier, including Eric Blair, not yet using his pen name George Orwell; an Australian, Harvey Buttonshaw; US Revolutionary Workers League member Wolf Kupinski; and Bob Williams, a Welshman married to a Spanish woman who joined up with his brother-in-law, Ramon. With these, and other, additions the ILP contingent numbered somewhere between thirty and thirty-five. They left the front, with the POUM militia, in mid-February 1937 to take part in the siege of Huesca, some 50 miles away. Eric Blair's background, prep school and Eton and his experience in Burma as police officer, are well known. The backgrounds of the other members of the contingent were diverse. Members were recorded as coming from South Africa (Buck ParkerThe Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 1 - An Age Like This 1945-1950 p.298 (Penguin)), the United States (Harry Milton, Wales, Belfast (Paddy O'Hara), Chorley, Larkhall, Glasgow (Charles Doran), Anglesey, Manchester, Bristol (Tom Coles), Dartford, Bingley, Twickenham and Golders Green. Four had fought in the First World War: Martin, who had gone to Spain driving the ambulance with Edwards and who, because of his experience in artillery, had stayed on; Doran; Harry Thomas of London and Arthur Chambers, who died in 1938 after transferring to a CNT unit. Few others, apart from Harry Webb, the stretcher-bearer and O'Hara, who had some training in first aid, had either military or medical experience. ==War experiences== Arriving at the Lenin Barracks in Barcelona, where they were initially stationed, on 10 January, a discussion circle was formed. Whilst the discussion group centred on political issues the group was not solely concerned with such topics. A social secretary was also appointed to 'arrange concerts and entertainments' and a sports secretary was elected with a hasty football match organised between the ILPers and a team of Spanish militia-men. The training received at the Barracks was notoriously short and at the end of January the ILP contingent, as the British section of the POUM militia, began their journey, stopping off at Lerida, where they were visited by the ILP's representative in Spain, John McNair, before leaving for the area surrounding Huesca on the Aragon Front on 2 February. At the front, the contingent took over three advanced posts, about 100 yards distant from the others, joined by communication trenches. The outposts, on the slope of the hills looking west, were about two hundred yards from the nearest Nationalist lines on the opposite slopes looking east. Bob Edwards, reporting in the New Leader, the ILP's weekly paper, was keen to stress the most 'exciting' aspects of the unit's work. He wrote about scouting within hearing distance along the Nationalist lines with Blair, of holding their position and dealing with the desertion of Nationalists. The main descriptions of fighting against the Nationalists which appears both in Homage to Catalonia and in the New Leader, concerned a night attack in which some of the contingent took part resulting in injuries to Reg Hiddlestone, Paddy Thomas and Douglas Thompson. Injuries were also sustained at other times, Blair himself was famously shot through the throat by a sniper. However, the reality of the contingent's activity was more mundane. It largely consisted of building roads from their dug-out to the nearest Spanish position and creating a dug-out for community purposes where they could meet to talk and receive instructions. In terms of military combat the contingent saw relatively little action. As Orwell later put it: :Meanwhile nothing happened, nothing ever happened. The English had got into the habit of saying that this wasn't a war it was a bloody pantomime. ==Suppression of POUM== Although the ILP contingent did not play a major part in the military side of the Spanish Civil War it was famously and controversially involved in the events surrounding the battles between rival Republican groups in Barcelona, known as the Barcelona May Days. The ILP contingent, although on leave in Barcelona, were split into groups during this fighting and none of the ILP contingent were drawn into the fighting in any extended way. However, the significance of Barcelona for the ILP lay not so much in the events themselves as in the reaction to the situation. Immediately after the events the Communist press began to attack POUM, claiming they were solely responsible for the fighting and were in league with the fascists in doing so. These accusations were quickly published in the Daily Worker, appearing in the 11 May issue. The New Leader of 21 May carried extensive comment on the 'Counter-Revolution in Spain'. ILP General Secretary Fenner Brockway argued that the Communists were on the wrong side of the barricades and were now 'committed to the defence of property', suggesting that the Communist Parties not only in Spain, but everywhere, had ceased to be revolutionary parties. The Communist Party responded by accusing the ILP of 'taking part in the fascist rising'. On 16 June, the POUM was made illegal, accused of collaborating with the enemy. Its leaders were arrested and Andreu Nin murdered. ILP leader John McNair arrived in Barcelona on 18 June with money and documents to organise the evacuation of the ILP contingent and was promptly arrested as a \\"POUM agent\\" but was released when he had proven his identity. He then went into hiding with Orwell and Cottman and managed to leave the country. Most of the rest of the contingent returned to Britain over the next six months. Meanwhile, in Britain, the Communist Party press had been accusing both the ILP and POUM of being agents of fascism. The press published two interviews with former contingent member Frank Frankford claiming he had witnessed fraternisation at the front with the enemy, that Kopp was receiving his orders from Huesca and that the Nationalist faction even supplied the POUM with arms. The situation for the members of the ILP contingent in Spain was made extremely uncomfortable by the attacks on POUM and it became more so as the Communists banned the ILP's Spanish 'brother party'. The ILP made considerable efforts to get its members home safely and several of the ILP contingent made furtive returns home escaping police arrest. For example, Cottmann, McNair, Blair and his wife Eileen O'Shaughnessy, who had been working for McNair at the ILP office, made an escape across the border by train posing as wealthy English businessmen.Newsinger, John \\"Orwell and the Spanish Revolution\\" International Socialism Journal Issue 62 Spring 1994 The author states that evidence discovered at the National Historical Archives in Madrid in 1989 of a security police report to the Tribunal for Espionage and High Treason described 'Eric Blair and his wife Eileen Blair, as \\"known Trotskyists\\" and as \\"linking agents of the ILP and the POUM\\". Newsinger goes on to state that given Orwell's precarious health, \\"there can be little doubt that if he had been arrested he would have died in prison.\\" Of those closely associated with the ILP contingment, the arrest of Kopp, the unit commander, and Milton, one of the American members of the contingent,\\"Harry Milton - The Man Who Saved Orwell\\" The Hoover Institution. Retrieved on 2008-12-23 were of particular concern. However, both were eventually released. Milton did not spend long in jail, as McNair ensured his release. Kopp on the other hand, despite attempted intervention on his behalf by the ILP, remained in prison for a further eighteen months. However, most attention both at the time and since, has focused on the case of Bob Smillie who died in jail in Valencia, officially of appendicitis, on 13 June. Smillie's death has been surrounded in mystery, and has been the subject of much speculation, focussing on accusations that he was \\"done to death\\" by the Communists. Although the issue remains controversial, recent scholarship tends to concur with the contemporary findings of the official ILP report into the investigation, conducted by David Murray of Motherwell ILP, found that the authorities were guilty of carelessness rather than violence or direct malice. Smillie, the first foreigner associated with the POUM to become a mortal victim of the Stalinist repression, had been detained at the French border accused of \\"carrying arms\\" - a dud hand-bomb was found among the various souvenirs he had with him. By November 1937, there were claimed to be 15,000 anti-fascist prisoners in the Republic’s jails, about 1,000 of them from the POUM. The Right Opposition and other marxist groupings organised an international campaign in solidarity with the POUM prisoners which probably saved their leaders from a similar fate to Nin’s. The IBRSU also sent several delegations to Spain to visit the party’s prisoners and try to secure their release, the first headed by its General Secretary, Fenner Brockway. In August, another delegation arrived including the ILP MP James Maxton. A third delegation went in November headed by another ILP MP, John McGovern. Despite the suppression of POUM, not all of the ILP contingent returned home immediately. Arthur Chambers, Bob Williams and Reg Hiddlestone all stayed on to fight in Spain. Williams returned home in December 1938 after being injured three times, Hiddleston was the final member of the contingent left in Spain, returning home in February 1939, leaving Barcelona only hours before Barcelona fell. Chambers was the only member of the ILP contingent to be killed in combat in Spain when he was shot by a sniper in August 1938 after transferring to a Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) unit. == ILP Contingent == *Agnew, John *Avory, Lewis ErnestHall, Christopher, 'Not Just Orwell': The Independent Labour Party Volunteers and the Spanish Civil War, Warren and Pell, 2009 *Bennett, William *Blair, Eric (George Orwell), corporal; wounded by sniper 20.5.37 *Braithwaite (Branthwaite), John *Buttonshaw, Harvey *Castle, Les *Chambers, Bill, corporal, killed after transferring to another unit 8/37 *Clarke, William *Clinton, Arthur, wounded in shoulder during shelling 3/37 *Coles, Tom *Connor, Jock *Cottman, Stafford *Donovan, (Paddy) John, sergeant *Doran, Charles *Edwards, Bob, driver of ILP ambulance 9/36; Poum captain - returned to Britain in March 1937 for ILP conference, but because of British anti-volunteer policy he couldn’t return to Spain, *Evans *Farrell, James *Frankford, Frank *Gross, George *Hiddlestone, Reg, wounded in night attack 4/37 *Hunter, Philip, leg injury 4/37 *Jones, Uriah, served until early 1938; after the disbanding of the Poum militia joined Psuc unit *Julius *Justessen, Charles *Kupinsky/i, Wolf, (\\"Harry Milton\\"), In Barcelona's Modelo prison 13.8.37. - released after pressure from US consulate *Levin, Louis *McDonald, Robert *Mcneil, Hugh *Martin, W.

The line includes a machine for drinks, snacks, frozen foods, and an ATM (ATM not in picture). A full-line vending business sets up several types of vending machines that sell a wide range of products, such as soft drinks and snacks. Soft drinks are usually sold in 12 fl. oz. (355 ml) and 20 oz. (591 ml) in the United States and sometimes Australia, or 330ml and 500ml in Europe, Canada, and other areas. Snacks, bags of chips, and similar edibles are usually about 1-3 oz. ==Trends== A typical American snack vending machine In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was a trend in the U.S. for large national retailers to have contracts with the national vending companies to provide full line vending services to all their branches' lunch / meal rooms. In most cases, managers and staff of individual stores objected to this, because the national vending companies were not necessarily responsive when making the product choices for the machines. As a result, this trend began to reverse. Most full line vending operators are independent and are small operations. Often, they can have the existing vending machines removed and get permission to install their own machines by promising to lower prices, stock the machine with the manager's favorite candies, or provide better service (e.g. servicing the machine the same day if a coin jam or bill validator becomes jammed). ==Business description== For operators, soda/snack machines have the advantage that many locations recognize the need for such machines. Many locations will, in fact, take the initiative to contact a vending company to request installation of a machine. Moreover, companies recognize the difficulty in moving these machines and are less likely to request removal, unless the operator does a poor job of servicing the machine. Almost all soda and snack machines have vend counters that track how many items are sold, making it difficult for an employee to steal money. The machines themselves, being large and heavy, are difficult to steal without drawing attention, compared to most bulk vending machines. Soda and snack machines are relatively expensive, unless they are obtained through a third-party vending program. Compared to bulk vending machines, full line vending machines take a long time to service - as much as an hour for a soda machine that is low on inventory. The product also tends to take up more space. Breakdowns are difficult to repair, due to the complexity of the machines; do-it-yourself repairs may void the warranty. The machines are difficult to move; this task may require the help of professional movers. Moreover, some locations expect a commission. ==Nature of the business== There are many types of machines available. One type is the combo machine that sells both sodas and snacks. These combo machines have the disadvantage of not holding much of any product, and therefore requiring frequent servicing. Most operators use separate snack and soda machines. Finding a good location can be difficult, since many locations already have vending machines, don't want one, or are too tiny to get enough business. An operator may end up paying the store owner a 10% commission, which requires separate accounting for that machine. If the locations are too far apart, the operator may spend so much time driving between locations when filling them that the same amount of time could more profitably be spent working for someone else. Vendors occasionally enroll in a \\"charity program\\", in which the vendor makes a monthly charity donation in exchange for displaying stickers supporting the chosen charity. Some vending machines are too heavy to carry without special equipment and/or helpers, especially if the machine has to go up or down stairs. As with bulk vending, turnover of accounts (in the event of a store closure or relocation, for instance) requires a repeat of the process of finding a location and moving the machine. Snacks and soda also have lower gross margins than bulk candy. Attention must be paid to the expiration dates on potato chips, sodas, and other products. The flexibility of a bank in handling coins is an important consideration when choosing the business' financial institution. A bank may not want a bucket of coins, so it may be necessary to find another bank or use machinery to organize coins into rolls. The government will expect taxes, tax forms, tax recordkeeping, and a business license. ==See also== * Automat *Vending Times, trade magazine for the U.S. vending industry ==References== *Krug, Bryon: Vending Business-in-a-Box, BooksOnStuff, 2003.

It was built in 1846 by Sam Barlow and Philip Foster, with authorization of the Provisional Legislature of Oregon, and served as the last overland segment of the Oregon Trail. Its construction allowed covered wagons to cross the Cascade Range and reach the Willamette Valley, which had previously been nearly impossible. Even so, it was by far the most harrowing of the nearly Oregon Trail. Before the opening of the Barlow Road, pioneers traveling by land from the east followed the Oregon Trail to Wascopam Mission (now The Dalles) and floated down the Columbia River to Fort Vancouver, then a perilous and expensive journey. It was also possible to drive livestock over Lolo Pass on the north side of Mount Hood, but that trail was too rugged for vehicles and unsuitable for wagons. A trading post (allowed by the Department of War) had been built where river crossings could be made along with the disassembly of wagons to make rafts suitable for floating down the remainder of the Columbia. The Barlow Road begins at Wascopam Mission and heads south to Tygh Valley (some consider Tygh Valley the origin), then turns west and roughly parallels the White River on the north and then west, crosses the south shoulder of Mount Hood at Barlow Pass, follows Camp Creek and the Sandy River for some way, and finally leads to Oregon City. The road was rendered largely irrelevant in the early 1900s by the construction of the Mount Hood Highway. It still exists as a dirt road in some places, while many other parts have been paved over by newer streets and highways. == Planning and construction == Eleven Years in the Rocky Mountains. When Sam Barlow arrived at The Dalles late September 1845, as many as sixty families were waiting for river transport. The expected wait was more than ten days, and the transportation \\"exorbitantly\\" priced. Local inquiries turned up little information about traveling over the mountains except that water, timber, and grazing were plentiful. Barlow and H. M. Knighton set out to determine the feasibility of a route, seeking a more expedient and less expensive way to the Willamette Valley. Knighton decided it was impractical after 20 or 25 miles (30–40 km) and returned. Barlow forged on with a train of seven wagons, intending to return for river transport if the mountain passage proved impractical. On October 1, 1845, Barlow and three men scouted ahead of their company and entered Mount Hood's foothills from the east near Tygh Creek, about from the mouth of the Deschutes River. They came within perhaps of Mount Hood. They thought they had glimpsed the Willamette Valley, and learned from the Indians of a trail leading to Oregon City, but returned to Tygh Creek about five days after their departure. There Joel Palmer was waiting for him with a 23 wagon party. Palmer had followed Barlow for a better route, and had just returned from exploring the same area.Palmer, p. 125–129 The combined company organized road clearing through the forest, mostly by burning. A marker on the Barlow Road, near its crossing with Oregon Route 35 The clearing party made it to the top of a ridge, now known as Barlow Pass, where they were effectively lost. Barlow, Palmer, and a man named Harrison Porter Locke hiked the south face of Mount Hood west of Palmer Glacier to scout a westward route off the mountain. Palmer, in better physical condition than his companions, climbed high on the glacier (likely Zigzag Glacier), and took detailed notes on the surrounding ridges and rivers. They returned to the group, arranged for guards for their wagons at a place they named Fort Deposit.believed by some to be the site of present-day Devil's Half-Acre Meadow, several miles south-southeast of the junction of US 26 and Oregon Route 35. See Devils Half Acre Meadow by Online Highways.com Several families in wagons ill-suited for travel through the wilderness remained at Fort Deposit, while the remainder returned to The Dalles. Barlow's group followed the Sandy River west on foot. Palmer noted an intersection with a trail coming from The Dalles by way of Lolo Pass, around the north side of Mount Hood, which had previously been the only overland trail traversed by pioneers.Palmer (1847), p. 152. Near the present-day city of Sandy, they turned southwest to reach Eagle Creek and Philip Foster's farm near present- day Clackamas. That autumn, Barlow considered the route over the mountains and petitioned the Provisional Legislature of Oregon for permission to build a road on December 9, 1845, claiming that his estimated cost of $4000 was lower than that of others familiar with the route. Permission was granted with a vote of 8-2 on December 17, 1845, approved by Speaker pro-tem Henry A. G. Lee, and signed into law by Governor George Abernethy. The road's toll was authorized for two years effective January 1, 1846 and specified toll rates at five dollars (about a week's wages, equivalent to about $ today) for each wagon and ten cents for each head of horse, mule, ass, or horned cattle. The grant named the route \\"Mount Hood Road\\"—but it was immediately known as the \\"Barlow Road.\\" The road was built with the financial backing of Philip Foster and a crew of forty men. Five toll gates were eventually built along the route. Barlow's estimate of $4000 (equivalent to $ today) had underestimated the number of trees to be cut down and forgotten the numerous challenging bridges that would have to be built over rivers such as the Sandy, Zigzag, White, and Salmon. The White River continues to challenge its bridges to this day.Highway 35 was washed out by the White River on November 6, 2006 and remained closed for 32 days; repair work continued through February. In its first season of operation, Barlow recorded the passage of 152 wagons, 1300 sheep, 1559 mules, horses, and cattle. Despite ongoing maintenance, the general condition of the road was considered to vary from \\"rough to barely passable.\\" == Early use == Wasco County that travelers would have seen approaching Mount Hood from the east along the Barlow Road—taken above Pine Hollow The direction of travel was effectively one-way until 1861, when a better road was blasted through Laurel Hill. Despite the expense and difficulties of passage, the road was very popular, with more than a thousand immigrants and approximately 150 wagons recorded in the first year of operation. Approximately three-quarters of the pioneers entering the Willamette Valley traveled the Barlow Road, with most of the remainder choosing the Columbia River route. Barlow's concession expired in 1848, and he and Foster terminated their largely unprofitable partnership on November 29, 1848. Barlow turned the road over to the state, but it fell into disrepair, and became almost impassible.Barlow, Mary S. (1902): History of the Barlow Road, Oregon Historical Quarterly. Others continued to operate the toll road, but weather and mountain conditions made this a financial struggle. By 1863, the toll had decreased to $2.50 per wagon and team. In 1849, a military wagon train destined for Oregon forts passed over the road. It carried 250 tons of munitions in more than 400 wagons pulled by 1700 mules. From the beginning of Barlow Road to the camp the soldiers made at what has been known since as Government Camp, they abandoned 45 wagons after dozens of mules died of starvation. == Later use and historic designations == Various owners operated the road until 1882. Ownership then passed to the Mount Hood & Barlow Road Company. E. Henry Wemme purchased that company in 1912, and made improvements to the road. Wemme's attorney, George W. Joseph, became the owner upon Wemme's death in 1914, in a probate dispute so contentious that it shaped the 1930 race for Governor of Oregon. Joseph and his wife donated the road to the people of Oregon in 1919. The 1923 Oregon Legislative Assembly designated the path from Idaho to the Pacific Ocean as the \\"Old Oregon Trail\\" route and approved signage with a prairie schooner and oxen for motor travelers to navigate. In 1978, the entire Oregon Trail, including the Barlow Road, was named a National Historic Trail by the U.S. Congress. In 1992, the Barlow Road was placed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. In 2005, part of it was incorporated into the Mount Hood Scenic Byway. The Oregon Trail, Barlow Road Segment is a small segment of an alternate route, near Wemme, that was separately listed on the National Register in 1974. Also Rock Corral on the Barlow Road, a campsite on the Barlow Road near Brightwood, was also separately NRHP-listed in 1974. == Today == Barlow Road in September 2008 On the western side of the Cascades, U.S. Route 26 follows more or less the same route from Sandy to Government Camp; south of Government Camp, US 26 follows a valley just west of the Barlow Road's route along Barlow Creek. The route is concurrent with a few miles of the southern end of Oregon Route 35, and much of the Mount Hood Highway. The Barlow Road is intact as a dirt road in a roughly north–south stretch along Barlow Creek; other portions are pristine ruts up to six feet deep. The easternmost part of the original Barlow Road in Wasco County traverses an unpopulated area within Mount Hood National Forest and follows small Forest Service roads and \\"Jeep trails\\", then Rock Creek Dam Road, and finally Wamic Market Road, north of the White River, from the Cascades to Tygh Valley. The areas east of Mount Hood National Forest have always been sparsely populated. Good rut viewing is possible at Pioneer Woman's Grave near Bennett Pass and in several other places. Much of the Clackamas County side is buried under US 26. Overall, about twenty percent of the road is still visible today. A roadside marker and trail at Laurel Hill (just west of Government Camp) provides history and access to the portion where a sixty percent grade was present in the early Barlow Road. Wagons were lowered down the hill winched by ropes wrapped around trees. == See also == * Applegate Trail built by Jesse Applegate * Lolo Pass * Meek Cutoff * Mount Hood Corridor * Santiam Wagon Road * William Barlow House * Dufur Ranger Station == References == == External links == * Barlow, Mary S.

It does not hear complaints about journalism in other media. (See main article.) == News councils in the United States == The idea of a news council has met considerable resistance from U.S. journalists, many of whom fear that it could lead to government regulation of the press. Advocates of news councils often pointed to the Minnesota News Council, which was started by the Minnesota Newspaper Association and inspired by a predecessor to Britain's Press Complaints Commission. The Minnesota News Council started hearing complaints since 1971, using a panel made up of half people from news organizations and half from the public. About half of the complaints were upheld. The organization shut down in 2011 because of reductions in funding and the number of people filing complaints. The Minnesota News Council said it got about 40% of its money from non-news companies, 20% from news organizations, 30% from foundations and 10% from individuals. It seeks contributions from all sources except the government. It hears complaints about all news media, including broadcast and online news. The Washington News Council, serving Washington state, was based on the Minnesota group. It held its first hearing in 1999 and operated for 15 years before closing in 2014. In 2005, the Washington and Minnesota groups said they would award $75,000 to each of two nonprofit groups interested in starting new news councils in other states. ==News council in Bolivia== Bolivia's National Council of Journalist Ethics includes a National Tribunal of Journalistic Ethics, which monitors the behavior of journalists according to ethical criteria.

The call letters changed to WEGO and the format changed to Spanish Christian. Programming included syndicated shows plus local programming from Iglesia Luz Admirable Assemblies of God. The Spanish format was short-lived however, as on July 4, 2012, new owners Ralph Epperson Broadcasting Inc. switched the format from Spanish back to English. The station now is News/Talk and features many of the same local personalities who worked at WSJS. The Eagle signed former longtime WSJS newsman Smith Patterson to be the news director and morning show host. Bill Flynn (formerly of WMAG and WPTI) will join Patterson on air on the morning show. WEGO became the flagship radio station of Wake Forest University Demon Deacons football and basketball. Syndicated hosts include Dennis Prager, Michael Savage, Laura Ingraham\\"SAM,\\" Winston-Salem Journal, 2012-07-06, p. 2A. and Mike Gallagher. On January 5, 2015, WEGO added Bill Bennett and shortened Flynn's show, taking it off entirely on some Mondays to air Bennett and Ingraham in their entirety. ===WTOB=== At noon on December 18, 2015, WEGO switched to classic hits from the late 1950s to the late '70s, with the first song \\"Fly Like an Eagle\\" by Steve Miller Band, and began calling itself \\"Classic Hits WTOB\\". After new owners changed WTOB in November, employees of the former WTOB formed Southern Broadcast Media LLC to license a new station. Ingraham, Bennett and Savage have been dropped, but Wake Forest sports remain. Mark Richards, one of those in charge, said, \\"We’re all about live, community radio and bringing back a radio style that was almost forgotten.\\" Southern Broadcast Media consummated the purchase of WEGO from Truth Broadcasting effective June 6, 2016, at a price of $164,000. On November 15, 2016, application was made to the Federal Communications Commission for WEGO to change its call letters to WTOB. The call letter change was made effective Tuesday November 22, 2016. On that day at 8:00 a.m., Announcers Mark Richards, Randy Simpson, and Bob Scarborough announced the change of call letters.

De la Penne was born in Genoa, where he also died. De la Penne graduated from the Italian Naval Academy in Livorno in 1934. He joined the Decima MAS in 1935. ==Iride submarine crew rescue action== On 22 August 1940, in the Gulf of Bomba, the Italian submarine Iride, being a human torpedo carrier, was sunk by a torpedo released by a British Fairey Swordfish bomber. The air attack happened during an exercise, in shallow water, when four human torpedo squads were around, including officers Teseo Tesei and Luigi Durand de la Penne. The divers were able to make an immediate rescue action. Of the 12 Iride crewmen who survived, two died during an unsuccessful attempt to surface, nine were retrieved alive (two of them died soon, due to wounds), and one was too shocked to leave the sunken submarine. De la Penne tried to persuade him to surface, and even gave him his own aqualung, but the seaman refused surfacing and died. ==Sinking of Valiant== HMS Valiant As part of a team of divers he took part in the human torpedo attacks on British vessels in the Mediterranean. In December 1941, he was one of a team of six (Emilio Bianchi, his second; Antonio Marceglia with Spartaco Schergat; Vincenzo Martellotta with Mario Marino) that attacked Alexandria harbour. They used an Italian human torpedo known as S.L.C. (Siluro Lenta Corsa, also known as \\"maiale\\"), actually a small underwater assault vehicle with a crew of two. As a result, four ships were disabled: the British battleships (by Marceglia and Schergat) and (by Martellotta and Marino), and the oil tanker Sagona and the destroyer . De la Penne personally placed the limpet mine under the hull of Valiant. A Human Torpedo SLC or \\"Maiale\\", exhibited in the Museo Sacrario delle Bandiere delle Forze Armate, in Rome, Italy. Of the three teams of frogmen, only de la Penne and Bianchi were captured before the devices exploded. The other two teams were able to get the coast, but they were captured the day after in Alexandria. As de la Penne refused to inform the ship's captain (Charles Morgan) of the mines, he and his mate were confined in a cell under-deck, actually in a place just above where the mine had been placed. A few minutes before the detonation, De la Penne informed Captain Morgan of the imminent explosion, in order to allow the British to evacuate the ship, but continued to refuse to disclose where the mine had been placed. The two frogmen were immediately sent back to their confinement place. Few minutes later, the mine exploded. Although hurt by the explosion, the frogmen reached the deck of Valiant just in time to see the other mines explode under Queen Elizabeth, Sagona and Jervis. Although both ships settled on the sea bed, their decks were still clear of the waterline. As all six frogmen were eventually captured and both vessels appeared to be operational, the success of the attack in neutralising the British ships became known by the Italian Navy only after some days. For this action, de la Penne was awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valour, the Italian highest military decoration awarded for valour \\"in the face of the enemy\\" (equivalent to the Victoria Cross). In May 1945, at the end of the war, the then Admiral Charles Morgan – who was Valiants captain at the time of the attack in Alexandria – wanted to confer himself the medal to de la Penne in a ceremony in Taranto. == With the Allies in La Spezia == After the 8 September 1943 Armistice, de la Penne was offered the opportunity to be released from prison and fight for the Allies. He accepted and returned to duty as a frogman. On 22 June 1944, he participated in a joint Italian/British operation against the Germans. A team formed of British and Italian divers was transported by the Italian destroyer in an attack on La Spezia harbour, at the time in German hands. They sank the cruisers and before they could be used to block the harbour entrance. == Post-war career == After the war, Durand de la Penne stayed in the Marina Militare. He was promoted to Capitano di Fregata (Commander) in 1950 and Capitano di Vascello (Captain) in 1954. In 1956 he was appointed as naval attaché in Brazil. He was also Deputy of the Parliament of Italy for the second through the sixth legislatures as an independent candidate. He retired with the rank of Ammiraglio di Squadra (Vice-Admiral). In the 1962 film The Valiant he was played by Ettore Manni. In his honour, the Marina Militare (Italian Navy) named its new series of destroyers of 1993 as the .

Since 2010 it is available under an open source community-based model. Its goal is improving creative thinking and communication. People build with Lego bricks 3-dimensional models of their ideas and tell stories about their models. Hence the name \\"serious play\\". ==Origins== Johan Roos and Bart Victor created the \\"Serious Play\\" concept and process in the mid-1990s as a way to enable managers to describe, create and challenge their views on their business. Dr. Roos is now Chief Academic Officer at Hult International Business Schoolhttp://johanroos.se/prof-johan- roos and Dr. Bart Victor is Cal Turner Professor of Moral Leadership at Vanderbilt University. They created Serious Play while they were both professors at IMD in Switzerland. The conceptual foundation of Serious Play combines ideas from constructivism (Piaget 1951), constructionism (Harel and Papert 1991), complex adaptive system theory (Holland 1995) and autopoietic corporate epistemology (von Krogh and Roos 1994; 1995) applied to the context of management and organizations. It also relies on action research. The empirical foundation of the concept of Serious Play stems from Roos and Victor's experiments with leadership teams in Tetra Pak, Hydro Aluminium and TFL and during an IMD program for the top 300 leaders in the Lego Group. They presented their early ideas in a short article published by IMD in 1998 entitled \\"In Search for Original Strategies: How About Some Serious Play?\\" and in the 1999 article \\"Towards a New Model of Strategy-making as Serious Play\\" published by European Management Journal. In 2004 the journal Long-Range Planning published their article \\"Playing Seriously with Strategy\\" (with Matt Statler), which serves as the foundation for Lego Serious Play concept. ==From experiment to open source product== The development of the Lego Serious Play product line in LEGO Company involved several teams and more than 20 iterations. Work at LEGO Company began with the owner Mr. Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen. Initially he was hesitant but presented with the early findings he became convinced that Roos and Victor's ideas had business value and decided to encourage and sponsor a commercial application under the auspices of the Lego Company. As the method developed in real-time sessions with various companies, results were robust and reproducible. In 1999, LEGO Group submitted the application to protect Serious Play trademark. While the Lego Serious Play methodology is currently open source, its trademark is still owned and protected by LEGO Group.The trademark applies to LEGO product line with dedicated Lego Serious Play kits. Initially in 2001, the subsidiary of LEGO Company called Executive Discovery submitted the application to patent the methodology and the material product line . Later in 2006 Executive Discovery re-submitted the patent application. However, U.S. patent office never issued the official patent because by 2008 the application was abandoned by the applicant. Therefore, LEGO Serious Play methodology was never patent protected.. Finally in 2010, Lego company decided to make the methodology open source, releasing the Lego Serious Play methodology under a Creative Commons community-based licence. Main Lego Serious Play communities are: Serious Play Pro, Global Federation of LSP Master Trainers, Association of Master Trainers. In 2019, Playmobil released their competing material product Playmobil Pro that uses a similar set of plastic figurines and toys for story telling. ==The research effort== In 2000, the systematic research effort on Lego Serious Play methodology focusing on the idea of playing seriously in organizations first started at the Swiss-based think tank Imagination Lab Foundation. The Imagination Lab’s main task was researching the use of the method for strategy development in organizations. Their team of researchers wrote 3 books, 74 working and research papers, and 12 short articles. Imagination Lab ceased to exist in 2004 and created European Academy of Management iLab Foundation Award . Since 2004, David Gauntlett published a number of books on combination of Lego Serious Play in media studies.Anthea Lipsett (2005), 'Lego and professor click over research', The Times Higher Educational Supplement, 8 April 2005 This approach makes use of metaphor and invites participants to build metaphorical models of their identities. The process of making something, and then reflecting upon it, is claimed to give a more nuanced insight into participants' feelings or experiences.Representing Identities, part one (2008), video about creative methods research, on YouTube Since 2007, Louise Møller Haase (née Louise Møller Nielsen) from Aalborg University published her dissertation, subsequent books and articles on personal- and shared experiential concepts and product development and prototyping approaches focusing on Lego Serious Play research projects at TC Electronic, The Red Cross, Daimler AG, and Copenhagen Living Lab. In 2009, the Lego Serious Play method was further developed for use in schools. Teachers are trained to use it with students from six years old. The method has also been adapted for use in higher education as a tool for teaching and learning, research, and ideation (Nolan 2009). Subsequently, IJMAR has published a special issue on Lego Serious Play applications. By 2011, Loizos Heracleous from Warwick Business School and Claus D. Jacobs from the University of St. Gallen finished their 2-year research project on embodied metaphors, which elaborated on Lego Serious Play action research at BASF and Unicef. Crafting Strategy: Embodied Metaphors in Practice The webatelier.net Lab of the Università della Svizzera italiana (University of Lugano, Switzerland) has further developed the methodology, releasing in 2011 URL (User Requirements with Lego) under the Creative Commons licence. Since 2014, Alison James from the University of Winchester and her research team have researched the use of Lego Serious Play in various tertiary educational institutions . Research on Lego Serious Play methodology continues at various academic institutions. See the expanding list of publications below. ==Critique== Lego Serious Play facilitators have vested business interests in promoting the use of the method. Therefore, most available case studies focus on success stories. No comparative studies using control groups have measured the effect and usefulness of Lego Serious Play methodology in comparison with conventional workshops. Some authors are critical of Lego Serious Play methodology. Journalist Dan Lyons has suggested based on his experiment that Lego Serious Play is just a toy therapy, which is useless, in par with New Age psychology. He suggests: \\"Lego workshops are just one example of the nonsense that is creeping into the workplace. ... The problem isn’t just that these exercises are pointless and silly. For a lot of people, this stuff can be really stressful. For older workers — say, people over 50 — these workshops compound the fear they already have about being pushed out of their jobs. But younger workers hate them too. “It feels like you’ve joined a cult,” says a thirtysomething software programmer whose department spent a day doing a Lego workshop. “The purpose seems to be to indoctrinate people to follow orders.”\\" ==Publications== * Beltrami G., 2017, LEGO SERIOUS PLAY: pensare con le mani, Franco Angeli * Blair, S., Rillo M, 2016, 'Serious Work: How to Facilitate Lego Serious Play Meetings and Workshops.'

The storm surge caused approximately 23 breaches in the drainage canal and navigational canal levees and floodwalls. As mandated in the Flood Control Act of 1965, responsibility for the design and construction of the city's levees belongs to the United States Army Corps of Engineers and responsibility for their maintenance belongs to the Orleans Levee Board. The failures of levees and floodwalls during Katrina are considered by experts to be the worst engineering disaster in the history of the United States. By August 31, 2005, 80% of New Orleans was flooded, with some parts under of water. The famous French Quarter and Garden District escaped flooding because those areas are above sea level. The major breaches included the 17th Street Canal levee, the Industrial Canal levee, and the London Avenue Canal floodwall. These breaches caused the majority of the flooding, according to a June 2007 report by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The flood disaster halted oil production and refining which increased oil prices worldwide. Between 80 and 90 percent of the residents of New Orleans were evacuated before the hurricane struck, testifying to some of the success of the evacuation measures. Despite this, many remained in the city, mainly those who did not have access to personal vehicles or who were isolated from the dissemination of news from the local governments. The Louisiana Superdome was used to house and support some of those who were unable to evacuate. Television shots frequently focused on the Superdome as a symbol of the flooding occurring in New Orleans. The disaster had major implications for a large segment of the population, economy, and politics of the entire United States. It has prompted a Congressional review of the Army Corps of Engineers and the failure of portions of the federally built flood protection system which experts agree should have protected the city's inhabitants from Katrina's surge. Katrina has also stimulated significant research in the academic community into urban planning, real estate finance, and economic issues in the wake of a natural disaster.John A. Kilpatrick and Sofia Dermisi, \\"The Aftermath of Katrina: Recommendations for Real Estate Research\\", Journal of Real Estate Literature, Spring, 2007. ==Background== Flooding in the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans after Hurricane Betsy in 1965. New Orleans was settled on a natural high ground along the Mississippi River. Later developments that eventually extended to nearby Lake Pontchartrain were built on fill to bring them above the average lake level. Navigable commercial waterways extended from the lake into the interior of the city to promote waterborne commerce. After the construction of the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal in 1940, the state closed these waterways causing the town's water table to lower drastically. In 1965, heavy flooding caused by Hurricane Betsy brought concerns regarding flooding from hurricanes to the forefront. That year, Congress passed the Flood Control Act of 1965 which, among other issues, gave authority for design and construction of the flood protection in the New Orleans metropolitan area to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, subject to cost sharing principles, some of which were waived by later legislation. The local municipalities were charged with maintenance once the projects were completed. After 1965, the corps built a levee system around a much larger geographic footprint that included previous marshland and swamp. Many new subdivisions were developed to cater to those who preferred a more suburban lifestyle but were open to remaining within the city limits of New Orleans. Historians question why the area farthest east was developed, since it was viable wetlands and because ringing this region with levees did nothing significant toward protecting the city. What expansion accomplished was to increase the amount of land that could be developed, and it was a reason for the Army Corps to expand the size of its project. In addition the structures caused subsidence of up to in some areas due to the consolidation of the underlying organic soils. A 1999–2001 study, led by Richard Campanella of the Tulane School of Architecture, used LIDAR technology and found that 51% of the terrestrial surface of the contiguous urbanized portions of Orleans, Jefferson, and St. Bernard parishes lie at or above sea level, with the highest neighborhoods at above mean sea level. Forty nine percent lies below sea level, in places to equivalent depths. When authorized, the flood control design and construction were projected to take 13 years to complete. When Katrina made landfall in 2005, the project was between 60–90% complete with a projected date of completion estimated for 2015, nearly 50 years after authorization. Hurricane Georges in September 1998 galvanized some scientists, engineers and politicians into collective planning, with Scientific American declaring that \\"New Orleans is a disaster waiting to happen\\" in October 2001.Fischetti, Mark (October 2001), p.70 However, even the most insistent calls from officials to evacuate ahead of Katrina did not warn that the levees could breach. On August 29, 2005, flood walls and levees catastrophically failed throughout the metro area. Many collapsed well below design thresholds (e.g., 17th Street and London Canals). Others (like the Industrial Canal) collapsed after a brief period of overtopping caused “scouring” or erosion of the earthen levee walls. In eastern New Orleans, levees along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway failed in several places because they were built with sand and erodible materials instead of clay, an obvious construction flaw. == History of New Orleans’ Law Enforcement Offices == Prior to Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans’ law enforcement was in disarray. It was inundated with corruption from higher up officials and had underpaid officers manning the streets. This enforcement lacked the trust of its citizens and failed to keep police brutality rates low. The city's lack of organization caused for the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) and its prison, Orleans Parish Prison (OPP), to have insufficient funding for proper equipment and emergency planning. Along with the law enforcement, the city's district attorney's office had very little funding as well. Each prosecutor was only paid $30,000 starting off and the public defenders only $29,000. These public defenders’ income came from the traffic tickets and court fees of the city residents. These earnings were oftentimes very inconsistent, in turn causing these low wages. New Orleans only had 30 public defenders to handle all of its cases annually. In the days leading up to the storm, Orleans Parish Prison's lack of preparation caused the overlooking of evacuation plans. This absence of preparation later led to the suffering of its prisoners during one of America's most damaging hurricanes. ==Pre-Katrina preparations== The eye of Hurricane Katrina was forecast to pass through the city of New Orleans. In that event, the wind was predicted to come from the north as the storm passed, forcing large volumes of water from Lake Pontchartrain against the levees and possibly into the city. It was also forecast that the storm surge in Lake Pontchartrain would reach , with waves reaching 7 feet (2 m) above the storm surge. On August 28, at 10:00 a.m. CDT, the National Weather Service (NWS) field office in New Orleans issued a bulletin predicting catastrophic damage to New Orleans and the surrounding region. Anticipated effects included, at the very least, the partial destruction of half of the well-constructed houses in the city, severe damage to most industrial buildings, rendering them inoperable, the \\"total destruction\\" of all wood-framed low-rise apartment buildings, all windows blowing out in high-rise office buildings, and the creation of a huge debris field of trees, telephone poles, cars, and collapsed buildings.National Weather Service/New Orleans, Louisiana. August 28, 2005. Lack of clean water was predicted to \\"make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\\" It was also predicted that the standing water caused by the storm surge would render most of the city uninhabitable for weeks and that the destruction of oil and petrochemical refineries in the surrounding area would spill waste into the flooding. The resulting mess would coat every surface, converting the city into a toxic marsh until water could be drained. Some experts said that it could take six months or longer to pump all the water out of the city.Galle, Julie. \\"Special Report: Vulnerable Cities: New Orleans, LA .\\" The Weather Channel. Accessed on April 30, 2006. ===Evacuation order=== On Saturday night, Max Mayfield, director of the National Hurricane Center, did something he had done only once before. He called the governors of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi to warn them of the severity of the coming storm. He issued a special warning to Mayor Ray Nagin, telling him that some levees in the greater New Orleans area could be overtopped. Later, Mr. Mayfield would tell Brian Williams with NBC Nightly News that he went to bed that night believing he had done what he could. On Sunday, he made a video call to U.S. President George W. Bush at his farm in Crawford, Texas about the severity of the storm. Carnival Cruise Ships Ecstasy and Sensation docked in Port of New Orleans while used for housing purposes for victims. Many New Orleans residents took precautions to secure their homes and prepare for possible evacuation on Friday the 26th and Saturday the 27th. On August 27 the state of Louisiana was declared an emergency area by the Federal Government, and by mid-morning of that day, many local gas stations which were not yet out of gas had long lines. Nagin first called for a voluntary evacuation of the city at 5:00 p.m. on August 27 and subsequently ordered a citywide mandatory evacuation at 9:30 a.m. on August 28, the first such order in the city's history. In a live news conference, Mayor Nagin predicted that \\"the storm surge most likely will topple our levee system\\", and warned that oil production in the Gulf of Mexico would be shut down. Many neighboring areas and parishes also called for evacuations. By mid-afternoon, officials in Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Charles, Lafourche, Terrebonne, Jefferson, St. Tammany, and Washington parishes had called for voluntary or mandatory evacuations.\\"Nolan, Bruce. \\"Katrina Takes Aim .\\" Times-Picayune. August 28, 2005. Although Mayor Ray Nagin ordered a mandatory evacuation of the city, many people refused to leave or were unable to do so. In Plaquemines Parish, an official described those remaining behind as \\"gambling with their own lives.\\"Staff Writer. \\"New Orleans braces for monster hurricane .\\" CNN. August 29, 2005, Reasons were numerous, including a belief that their homes or the buildings in which they planned to stay offered sufficient protection, lack of financial resources or access to transportation, or a feeling of obligation to protect their property. These reasons were complicated by the fact that an evacuation the previous year for Hurricane Ivan had resulted in gridlocked traffic for six to ten hours. The fact that Katrina occurred at the end of the month before pay checks were in the hands of many was also significant.Elizabeth Fussell \\"Leaving New Orleans: Social Stratification, Networks, and Hurricane Evacuation .\\" A \\"refuge of last resort\\" was designated at the Louisiana Superdome. Beginning at noon on August 28 and running for several hours, city buses were redeployed to shuttle local residents from 12 pickup points throughout the city to the \\"shelters of last resort.\\"Olsen, Lise. \\"City had evacuation plan but strayed from strategy .\\" Houston Chronicle. September 8, 2005. By the time Hurricane Katrina came ashore early the next morning, Mayor Nagin estimated that approximately one million people had fled the city and its surrounding suburbs. By the evening of August 28, over 100,000 people remained in the city, with 20,000 taking shelter at the Louisiana Superdome, along with 300 National Guard troops. The Superdome had been used as a shelter in the past, such as during 1998's Hurricane Georges, because it was estimated to be able to withstand winds of up to and water levels of . While supplies of MREs (Meals ready to eat) and bottled water were available at the Superdome, Nagin told survivors to bring blankets and enough food for several days, warning that it would be a very uncomfortable place. ==Direct effects== The flood of New Orleans from a boat on Canal Street (early September 2005). Checkpoint in the Ninth Ward at the Industrial Canal. Residents were allowed in to examine and salvage from their property during daylight. October 25, 2005. Hurricane Katrina made its second and third landfalls in the Gulf Coast region on August 29, 2005, as a Category 3 hurricane. On Monday, August 29, 2005, area affiliates of local television station WDSU reported New Orleans was experiencing widespread flooding due to breaches of several Army Corps-built levees, was without power, and that there were several instances of catastrophic damage in residential and business areas. Entire neighborhoods on the south shore of Lake Pontchartrain were flooded. The extensive flooding stranded many residents who were forced to stay in place long after Hurricane Katrina had passed. Stranded survivors dotted the tops of houses citywide. Some were trapped inside attics and were unable to escape. Many people chopped their way onto their roofs with hatchets and sledge hammers, which Mayor Nagin had urged residents to store in their attics in case of such events. Clean water was unavailable, and power outages were expected to last for weeks. By 11:00 p.m. August 29, Mayor Nagin described the loss of life as \\"significant\\" with reports of bodies floating on the water throughout the city, though primarily in the eastern portions. Some hotels and hospitals reported diesel fuel shortages. The National Guard began setting up temporary morgues in select locations. ===Communications failures=== Coordination of rescue efforts August 29 and August 30 was made difficult by disruption of the communications infrastructure. Many telephones, including most cell phones, and Internet access were inoperable because of line breaks, destruction of base stations, or power failures, even though some base stations had their own back-up generators. In a number of cases, reporters were asked to brief public officials on the conditions in areas where information was not reaching them any other way. All local television stations were disrupted. Local television stations and newspapers moved quickly to sister locations in nearby cities. New Orleans CBS-affiliate WWL-TV was the only local station to remain on the air during and after the storm, broadcasting from Baton Rouge. Broadcasting and publishing on the Internet became an important means of distributing information to evacuees and the rest of the world, with news networks citing blogs like Interdictor and Gulfsails for reports of what was happening in the city. Amateur radio provided tactical and emergency communications and handled health-and-welfare enquiries. By September 4, a temporary communications hub was set up at the Hyatt Hotel in downtown New Orleans. The first television pictures out of New Orleans shown on national TV were from Houston's ABC owned and operated KTRK which flew its helicopter to New Orleans in the days after the storm. ===Damage to buildings and roads=== Superdome is at the center where many people stayed through the course of Katrina. Most of the city's major roads were damaged. The only route out of the city was east to the West Bank of New Orleans on the Crescent City Connection bridge. The I-10 Twin Span Bridge traveling east towards Slidell, suffered severe damage; 473 spans were separated from their supports and 64 spans dropped into the lake. The long Lake Pontchartrain Causeway escaped unscathed but was only carrying emergency traffic. On August 29, 2005, at 7:40 a.m. CDT, it was reported that most of the windows on the north side of the Hyatt Regency New Orleans had been blown out, and many other high rise buildings had extensive window damage.Transcript from, The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer. \\"Hurricane Damages Gulf Coast.\\" PBS. August 29, 2005. The Hyatt was the most severely damaged hotel in the city, with beds reported to be flying out of the windows. Insulation tubes were exposed as the hotel's glass exterior was completely sheared off. Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport was closed before the storm but reported no flooding in airplane movement areas or inside of the building itself. By August 30, it was reopened to humanitarian and rescue operations. Commercial cargo flights resumed on September 10, and commercial passenger service resumed on September 13.Staff Writer. \\"New Orleans Airport To Reopen This Week .\\" Airwise . September 11, 2005. Retrieved on November 24, 2006. The Superdome sustained significant damage, including two sections of the roof when waterproof membrane had essentially been peeled off by the wind. On August 30, Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco ordered the complete evacuation of the remaining people that sought shelter in the Superdome.Rourke, Matt. \\"New Orleans outlook bleak; 100 dead in Miss. \\" USA Today. August 30, 2005. They were then transported to the Astrodome in Houston, Texas. ===Levee failures=== Flooded I-10/I-610 interchange and surrounding area of northwest New Orleans and Metairie, Louisiana As of mid-day Monday, August 29, 2005, the eye of Hurricane Katrina passed east of the City subjecting it to hurricane wind conditions, but sparing New Orleans the worst impact. The city seemed to have escaped most of the catastrophic wind damage and heavy rain that had been predicted. Most buildings came through well structurally. Satellite photos of New Orleans taken in March 2004, then on August 31, 2005, after the levee failures. However, the city's levee and flood walls designed and built by the US Army Corps of Engineers breached in over fifty locations. Additionally, the levees were built on soil that vary in compression and consolidation rates. Therefore, it is difficult to systematically predict subsidence of the ground under the levees. Storm surge breached the levees of the Mississippi River- Gulf Outlet Canal (\\"MR-GO\\") in approximately 20 places and flooded all of Saint Bernard Parish, the east bank of Plaquemines Parish and the historic Lower Ninth Ward. The major levee breaches in the city included breaches at the 17th Street Canal levee, the London Avenue Canal, and the wide, navigable Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, which left approximately 80% of New Orleans flooded.Murphy, Verity. \\"Fixing New Orleans' thin gray line .\\" BBC News. October 4, 2005. There were three major breaches at the Industrial Canal; one on the upper side near the junction with MR-GO, and two on the lower side along the Lower Ninth Ward, between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue. The 17th Street Canal levee was breached on the lower (New Orleans West End) side inland from the Old Hammond Highway Bridge, and the London Avenue Canal breached in two places, on the upper side just back from Robert E. Lee Boulevard, and on the lower side a block in from the Mirabeau Avenue Bridge. Flooding from the breaches put the majority of the city under water for days, in many places for weeks. Many roads and buildings were damaged by Hurricane Katrina. In a June 2006 report on the disaster, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers admitted that faulty design specifications, incomplete sections, and substandard construction of levee segments, contributed to the damage done to New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina. A report released by the American Society of Civil Engineers in June 2007 concluded that two-thirds of the flooding in the city could have been avoided if the levees had held. The failure of the Hurricane Protection Project of New Orleans has prompted many government officials to call for many congressional committee hearings and investigations. The group Levees.org led by Sandy Rosenthal called for 8/29 Commission to investigate both the engineering and decision-making behind the collapse of a flood protection system that should have held against Katrina's storm surge. Six Flags New Orleans still flooded 2 weeks after the levee failures ===Loss of life=== A U.S. Coast Guard aircrew searches for survivors in New Orleans during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Preliminary reports indicate that the official death toll, according to the Louisiana Department of Health, was 1,464 people. The first deaths were reported shortly before midnight on August 28, 2005, as three nursing home patients died during an evacuation to Baton Rouge. On September 4, Mayor Nagin speculated that the death toll could rise as high as ten thousand after the clean-up was completed. Some survivors and evacuees reported seeing bodies lying in city streets and floating in still-flooded sections, especially in the east of the city. The advanced state of decomposition of many corpses, some of which were left in the water or sun for days before being collected, hindered efforts by coroners to identify many of the dead. Successful rescue of a pregnant woman There were six deaths confirmed at the Superdome. Four of these were from natural causes, one was the result of a drug overdose, and one was a suicide. At the Convention Center, four bodies were recovered. One of these four is believed to be the result of a homicide.Thevenot, Brian; Russell, Gordon. \\"Reports of anarchy at Superdome overstated .\\" Seattle Times. September 26, 2005. Body collection throughout the city began on approximately September 9. Prior to that date, the locations of corpses were recorded, but most were not retrieved. Later studies determined that most of New Orleans' Katrina dead were elderly persons living near levee breaches in the Lower Ninth Ward and Lakeview neighborhoods. ==Aftermath== ===Civil disturbances=== A fire raged in a downtown business the morning of September 2. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina was characterized by extensive reporting of looting, violence, shooting against rescuers, murder and rape. While some criminal acts did occur, such as the emptying of an entire Walmart, many reports were also exaggerated, inflated, or simply fabricated. Several news organizations went on to issue retractions. There were reports of snipers taking potshots at rescue helicopters; these were false. Reports of gangs roving the city shooting police officers and survivors were also false, as only one policeman was shot in the aftermath of Katrina and no indictments were brought forward against the supposed gang members.Rebecca Solnit, A paradise built in hell, Chapter V, Penguin Books, 2009 Many reported instances of \\"looting\\" were in fact stranded survivors scavenging necessary supplies such as food, water, clothing, and shelter.Peter Berkowitz, \\"We Went into the Mall and Began 'Looting'\\":A Letter on Race, Class, and Surviving the Hurricane , September 5, 2005, [Accessed 16/07/2013] Some instances of looting were later found out to have been carried out by a small number of NOPD officers.CNN, Witnesses: New Orleans cops took Rolex watches, jewelry , September 25, 2005 [Accessed 16/07/2013] Civil disturbances in post-Hurricane Katrina were consistent with all existing research on disaster sociology, which concludes that \\"[post- disaster] widespread looting [is] a myth\\",Lauren Barsky, Joseph Trainor, Manuel Torres, \\"Disaster Realities in the Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina:Revisiting the Looting Myth\\", Disaster Research Center, University of Delaware, 2006 and were vastly overstated by the media, ultimately fueling a climate of suspicion and paranoia which greatly hampered rescue efforts and further worsened the conditions of the survivors.Jim Dwyer and Christopher Drew, \\"After Katrina, crimes of the imagination\\", The New York Times, 29 September 2009 [Accessed 16/07/2013] Some initial reports of mass chaos, particularly in stories about the Superdome, were later found to be exaggerated or rumor.Dwyer, Jim; Drew, Christopher. \\"Fear Exceeded Crime's Reality in New Orleans .\\" The New York Times. September 29, 2005. In the Superdome, for example, the New Orleans sex crimes unit investigated every report of rape or atrocity and found only two verifiable incidents, both of sexual assault. The department head told reporters, \\"I think it was an urban myth. Any time you put 25,000people under one roof, with no running water, no electricity and no information, stories get told.\\" Based on these reports, government officials expected hundreds of dead to be found in the Superdome, but instead found only six dead: four natural deaths, one drug overdose, and one suicide. In a case of reported sniper fire, the \\"sniper\\" turned out to be the relief valve of a gas tank popping every few minutes. A Lincoln Town Car disabled by the flooding from Katrina. Additional acts of unrest occurred following the storm, particularly with the New Orleans Police Department. In the aftermath, a tourist asked a police officer for assistance, and got the response, \\"Go to hell, it's every man for himself.\\"Parry, Ryan. \\"MISSISSIPPI BURNING: Pollution hell as fires, explosions and oil spills follow the hurricane .\\" The Daily Mirror. September 3, 2005. Retrieved on September 20, 2006. Also, one-third of New Orleans police officers deserted the city in the days before the storm, many of them escaping in their department-owned patrol cars. This added to the chaos by stretching law enforcement thin. Additionally, several NOPD officers were arrested weeks after Katrina for suspicion of vehicle theft. ===Gretna controversy=== The City of Gretna on the West Bank of the Mississippi River received considerable press coverage when, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina (late August 2005), displaced and dehydrated survivors who attempted to escape from New Orleans by walking over the Crescent City Connection bridge over the Mississippi River were turned back at gunpoint by City of Gretna Police, along with Crescent City Connection Police and Jefferson Parish Sheriff's deputies, who set up a roadblock on the bridge in the days following the hurricane. ===Re-establishing governance=== A United States National Guard humvee patrols Poydras Street outside of the Superdome. U.S. Army Infantry on patrol in New Orleans in an area previously underwater, September 2005. By September 1, 6,500 National Guard troops had arrived in New Orleans, and on September 2 Blanco requested a total of 40,000 for assistance in evacuation and security efforts in Louisiana.Breen, Allen G. \\"Explosions Fill New Orleans Sky With Smoke. \\" ABC News. September 2, 2005.Barringer, Felicity; Longman, Jere. \\"Police and Owners Begin to Challenge Looters .\\" The New York Times. September 1, 2005. In addition, the Louisiana State Guard and state defense forces from several states were activated to aid the National Guard in sheltering the large number of refugees leaving Louisiana and assist in other disaster recovery operations. Some concern over the availability and readiness of the Louisiana National Guard to help stabilize the security situation was raised. Guardsman Lieutenant Colonel Pete had commented that \\"dozens of high water vehicles, humvees, refuelers, and generators were abroad.\\"Zunes, Stephen. \\"A Hurricane of Consequences .\\" Alternet. September 4, 2005. At the time of the hurricane, approximately 3,000 members of the Guard were serving a tour of duty in Iraq. With total personnel strength of 11,000, this meant that 27% of the Louisiana National Guard was abroad.Berger, Julian; Campbell, Duncan. \\"Why did help take so long to arrive?\\" The Guardian. September 3, 2005. However, both the White House and the Pentagon argued that the depletion of personnel and equipment did not impact the ability of the Guard to perform its mission—rather, impassable roads and flooded areas were the major factors impeding the Guardsmen from securing the situation in New Orleans. Before Hurricane Katrina, the murder rate in New Orleans was ten times higher than the U.S. average. After the situation in New Orleans was brought under control, criminal activity in New Orleans dropped significantly.Ripley, Amanda. \\"What Happened to the Gangs of New Orleans? \\" Time magazine. May 22, 2006. In response to the increase in criminal activity in New Orleans, makeshift prisons were constructed to house prisoners for short periods of time. Camp Greyhound was a temporary prison that housed more than 200 suspected looters in New Orleans until they could be transferred to other institutions. With room for 700 prisoners, the facility was guarded by officers from one of the United States' toughest prisons, the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. The station's bus terminals were converted into chain-link prison cells that could hold up to fifteen prisoners each. These prisoners were kept in conditions that included a portable toilet and military issued meals, but excluded a mattress or cot. Law enforcement constructed the necessary offices of a police station in the general areas of the bus station, which included the offices of the District Attorney and the Justice Department. Camp Greyhound did have several issues with police records due to flooding, and prisoners who had committed minor infractions were kept in the same areas as those with more serious allegations. The facility was run on backup generators and outdated fingerprinting methods were used, which added to the confusion of the facility. ===The Superdome=== Displaced people bringing their belongings and lining up to get into the Superdome. Damage to the Superdome as a result of Katrina. As one of the largest structures in the city, evacuees were brought to the Superdome to wait out the storm or to await further evacuation. Many others made their way to the Superdome on their own, hoping to find food, water, shelter, or transport out of town. On August 29, 2005, Katrina passed over New Orleans with such force that it ripped two holes in the Superdome roof. On the evening of August 30, Maj. Gen. Bennett C. Landreneau, of the Louisiana National Guard, said that the number of people taking shelter in the Superdome had risen to around 15,000 to 20,000 as search and rescue teams brought more people to the Superdome from areas hard-hit by the flooding.Staff Writer. \\"Governor: Evac Superdome, Rescue Centers .\\" Fox News/Associated Press. August 30, 2005. As conditions worsened and flood waters continued to rise, on August 31, Governor Blanco ordered that all of New Orleans, including the Superdome, be evacuated. The area outside the Superdome was flooded to a depth of , with a possibility of if the area equalized with Lake Pontchartrain. Governor Blanco had the state send in 68 school buses on Monday to begin evacuating people.Anderson, Ed. \\"School buses used to evacuate .\\" Times-Picayune. September 1, 2005. Despite increasingly squalid conditions, the population inside continued to grow. The situation inside the building was described as chaotic; reports of rampant drug use, fights, rape, and filthy living conditions were widespread. At the time, as many as 100 were reported to have died in the Superdome, with most deaths resulting from heat exhaustion, but other reported incidents included an accused rapist who was beaten to death by a crowd and an apparent suicide.Staff Writer. \\"Britons describe hurricane ordeal .\\" BBC News. September 6, 2005. Despite these reports, though, the final official death toll was significantly less: six people died inside (4 of natural causes, one overdose, and an apparent suicide) and a few more in the general area outside the stadium. FEMA had announced that, in conjunction with Greyhound, the National Guard, and Houston Metro, the 25,000 people at the Superdome would be relocated across state lines to the Houston Astrodome. Roughly 475 buses were promised by FEMA to ferry evacuees with the entire evacuation expected to take two days.Anderson, Ed; Moller, Jan. \\"Update on Superdome Evacuation .\\" Times- Picayune. August 31, 2005. By September 4, the Superdome had been completely evacuated. Although the Superdome suffered damage by water and wind to the overall interior and exterior structures, as well as interior damage from human waste and trash, the facility was repaired at a cost of US$140 million and was ready for games by the autumn of 2006.Staff Writer. \\"NFL, at Saints' urging, kicks in $20 million for dome repairs .\\" KCEN-TV. January 31, 2006. ===New Orleans Convention Center=== Because of Hurricane Katrina, the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center suffered a loss of water pressure and electricity, and one of its convention halls had a large hole in its ceiling. The center was otherwise only lightly damaged.Haygood, Wil and Tyson, Ann Scott. \\"It Was as if All of Us Were Already Pronounced Dead \\". The Washington Post. September 15, 2005. Retrieved on November 24, 2006. On August 29, as people were being turned away at the Superdome and rescues continued, rescuers began dropping people off at the Convention Center, which, at above sea level, easily escaped the flood. Captain M.A. Pfeiffer of the NOPD was quoted as saying, \\"It was supposed to be a bus stop where they dropped people off for transportation. The problem was, the transportation never came.\\" By the afternoon of the 29th, the crowd had grown to about 1,000 people. The convention center's president (who was there with a small group of convention center employees at this time) addressed the crowd near dark, informing them that there was no food, water, medical care, or other services. By late on the evening of the 29th, the convention center had been broken into, and evacuees began occupying the inside of the convention center. A contingent of 250 National Guard engineering units occupied one part of the convention center beginning August 30 and remained there until September 1, at times barricaded in their location. The units were never given orders to control the crowd, and were not expected to be prepared for such a task, as engineering units. The number of people at the convention center continued to grow over the next three days by some estimates to as many as 20,000 people. Reasons for arriving included being sent to the convention center from the overwhelmed Superdome, being dropped off there by rescuers, or hearing about the convention center as a shelter via word of mouth. No checking for weapons was done among the crowd as was done at the Superdome, and a large store of alcohol kept at the Convention Center was looted. Reports of robberies, murder, and rape began to surface.Gifford, Alec. \\"40 Rapes Reported in Hurricane Katrina, Rita Aftermath .\\" WDSU. December 23, 2005.Burnett, John. \\"More Stories Emerge of Rapes in Post-Katrina Chaos .\\" National Public Radio. December 21, 2005. In general, those who died, regardless of cause of death, were not moved or removed and were left to decompose. By September 1, the facility, like the Superdome, was completely overwhelmed and declared unsafe and unsanitary. However, even though there were thousands of people who were evacuating at the center, along with network newscasters, pleading desperately for help on CNN, FOX, and other broadcast outlets, FEMA head Michael Brown and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff both claimed to have no knowledge of the use of the Convention Center as a shelter until the afternoon of September 1.Staff Writer. \\"The big disconnect on New Orleans .\\" CNN. September 2, 2005. A sizable contingent of National Guard arrived on September 2 to establish order and provide essential provisions, and on September 3, buses began arriving at the convention center to pick up the refugees there. The Convention Center was completely evacuated by September 4. ===Evacuation efforts=== Hurricane evacuees in Metairie, Louisiana, being helped by the US Air National Guard on September 3. On August 31, a public health emergency was declared for the entire Gulf Coast, and Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco ordered a mandatory evacuation of all those remaining in New Orleans. Relief organizations scrambled to locate suitable areas for relocating evacuees on a large scale. Many of the survivors in the Superdome were bussed to the Reliant Astrodome in Houston, Texas. Houston agreed to shelter an additional 25,000 evacuees beyond those admitted to the Astrodome, including one \\"renegade bus\\" that was commandeered by private citizen Jabbar Gibson, who had been released on bond from the Orleans Parish Prison just days before the storm hit, and had a previous criminal conviction. By September 1, the Astrodome was declared full and could not accept any more evacuees. The George R. Brown Convention Center nearby was opened to house additional evacuees. San Antonio, Texas also agreed to house 25,000 refugees, beginning relocation efforts in vacant office buildings on the grounds of KellyUSA, a former air force base, and Reunion Arena in Dallas, Texas was mobilized to house incoming evacuees, and smaller shelters were established in towns across Texas and Oklahoma. Arkansas also opened various shelters and state parks throughout the state for evacuees. Expected to last only two days, the evacuation of remaining evacuees proved more difficult than rescue organizations anticipated as transportation convoys struggled with damaged infrastructure and a growing number of evacuees. By the morning of September 1, Governor Blanco reported that the number of evacuees in the Superdome was down to 2,500. However, by evening, eleven hours after evacuation efforts began, the Superdome held 10,000 more people than it did at dawn. Evacuees from across the city swelled the crowd to about 30,000, believing the arena was the best place to get a ride out of town. Evacuation efforts were hastened on September 2 by the wider dispersal of evacuees among newly opened shelters. Louis Armstrong International Airport was reopened to allow flights related to relief efforts, and began to load evacuees onto planes as well. Elements of the 82nd Airborne Division arrived in New Orleans September 3. The flooding was a challenge for the paratroopers when they first arrived. The division had just four boats at the time, however, the division quickly started getting Coast Guard, Navy and Marine assets placed under their control. Army Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, the 82nd's commanding general, noted: \\"We eventually became the 82nd 'Waterborne' Division,\\" the general said, \\"and that really was our forte\\" during search-and-rescue and security missions in flooded sections of the city. Rescue teams evacuating residents from flooded areas. Task Force Katrina Commander Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honore also charged the paratroopers to straighten out the evacuation situations at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, the New Orleans Convention Center and the Superdome. In all, 3,600 of the division's paratroopers were deployed to New Orleans to participate in Task Force All-American. The unit worked in tandem with state, local and other federal authorities to feed, process and transport evacuees to other accommodations; the division's soldiers helped evacuate 6,000 New Orleans residents. By September 18, the 82nd Division medical personnel had treated 1,352 people and given 2,047 immunizations, according to unit documents. By September 19, 82nd Division military engineers had cleared 185 city blocks of debris, cleared 113 streets, and removed 218 trees, according to unit documents.Gerry J. Gilmore, American Forces Press Service. \\"Airborne Division Becomes Waterborne in New Orleans.\\"Retrieved on July 18, 2008. On September 3, some 42,000 evacuees were evacuated from New Orleans, including those remaining in the Superdome and Convention Center. Efforts turned to the hundreds of people still trapped in area hotels, hospitals, schools and private homes.Staff Writer. \\"House-to- house rescues under way in New Orleans .\\" CNN. September 5, 2005. On September 6, Mayor Ray Nagin ordered a forced evacuation of everyone from the city who was not involved in clean up work, citing safety and health concerns.Staff Writer. \\"New Orleans will force evacuations .\\" CNN. September 7, 2005. The order was given not only as an attempt to restore law and order but also out of concern about the hazardous living conditions in the city. Eviction efforts escalated three days later when door-to-door searches were conducted to advise remaining residents to leave the city. Despite this, a number of residents defied the eviction order. While initially lax in enforcing evictions, National Guard troops eventually began to remove residents by force.Dwyer, Timothy; Tyson, Ann Scott. \\"Troops Escalate Urgency of Evacuation .\\" The Washington Post. September 9, 2005. === Orleans Parish Prison === During Hurricane Katrina, Orleans Parish Prison housed many different inmates. There were inmates who were serving weekend time due to public intoxication all the way to convicted murderers. There were many inmates who just began their sentences when Katrina hit the city. After the hurricane made landfall, most of the city's power was affected. This caused for Orleans Parish Prison to be without power. During this outage, many of the prisoners were locked in their cells due to the doors solely opening electronically. After being left in the dark due to the wind damage, the breaking of levees throughout the city flooded New Orleans and affected the prison. These prisoners were left by guards and deputies alike in the prison with chest high water and no food or water. Due to the lack of power, the inmates took it upon themselves to start fires in the facility despite lack of ventilation. Though most left, there were some prison guards who stayed in the city during the storm. These guards allegedly assaulted the prisoners during this time. Most prisoners were shot, beaten, and maced. The prisoners feared for their lives during these encounters with the guards. The inmates endured these living conditions for three to five days before being relocated by officials. Once official teams came in to rescue the prisoners, they were all moved to I-10, the major interstate in New Orleans. Inmates who were not able to be easily rescued were left in the prison. While located on I-10, the inmates were given water and food, though for some this was given too late. There were many inmates who passed out due to dehydration. The police brutality also remained high while prisoners were on the interstate. Guards would shoot at the prisoners for any outburst and continue to beat them similar to conditions in Orleans Parish Prison. While the inmates continued to endure these conditions, there were a total of six public defenders who were managing the cases of all of New Orleans prisoners. Many of the incarcerated served longer sentences due to the public defender's lack of manpower. The prisoners were later sent off to different prisons around the state of Louisiana while the city was still underwater. After the flood waters receded, many of the inmates of Orleans Parish Prison served longer sentences due to the lack of government in New Orleans. The Criminal Justice System was out of order in the city for months and did not release its first prisoner on bond until October 2006. ===Health effects=== Sick and injured people being evacuated aboard a C-17 Globemaster III There was a concern that the prolonged flooding would lead to an outbreak of health problems for those who remained in the city. In addition to dehydration and food poisoning, there was also potential for the spread of hepatitis A, cholera, tuberculosis, and typhoid fever, all related to the growing contamination of food and drinking water supplies in the city compounded by the city's characteristic heat and stifling humidity. Survivors could also face long-term health risks due to prolonged exposure to the petrochemical tainted flood waters and mosquito-borne diseases such as yellow fever, malaria, and West Nile fever. On September 2, an emergency triage center was set up at the airport. A steady stream of helicopters and ambulances brought in the elderly, sick, and injured. Baggage equipment was used as gurneys to transport people from the flight line to the hospital, which was set up in the airport terminal. The scene could be described as, \\"organized chaos\\", but efficient. By September 3, the situation started to stabilize. Up to 5,000 people had been triaged and fewer than 200 remained at the medical unit. Hospital evacuations continued from other area hospitals that were flooded or damaged. Reports from the Methodist Hospital indicated that people were dying of dehydration and exhaustion while the staff worked unendingly in horrendous conditions. The first floor of the hospital flooded and the dead were stacked in a second floor operating room. Patients requiring ventilators were kept alive with hand-powered resuscitation bags. Among the many hospitals shut down by damage related to the hurricane was the public hospital serving New Orleans, Charity Hospital, which was also the only trauma center serving that region. The destruction of the hospital's structure has forced the continued closure as funding for a new building is sought out. === Pediatric evacuation === Multiple children's hospitals around the United States including Arkansas Children's Hospital, Texas Children's Hospital, Children's of Alabama, Le Bonheur Children's Hospital, Cook Children's Medical Center, and Children's Mercy Kansas City sent helicopters, fixed wing aircraft, ambulances, and personnel to Tulane Medical Center, Ochsner, and CHNOLA in order to help evacuate pediatric patients from the hospital. ===Economy=== Before Katrina's landfall in 2005, the economy of New Orleans relied heavily on its usefulness and income derived from being a port city. The population grew and the economy peaked in the late 19th century. However, in the recent years, after rapid industrialization and the development of faster methods of transporting goods, the economy of New Orleans has been in a steady decline.Vigdor, Jacob, \\"The Economic Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina,\\" 'The Journal of Economic Perspectives' 22 (2008): 135–138. As a result, New Orleans came to rely on three major industries for economic revenue: transportation, entertainment, and public services.Vigdor, Jacob, \\"The Economic Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina,\\" 'The Journal of Economic Perspectives' 22 (2008): 141. However, after Katrina's landfall, these sectors, including the overall economy, were reduced and heavily affected by the natural disaster. After the hurricane, the labor force diminished and wages decreased by staggering amounts. In July 2005, 9,592 people applied for unemployment services and the payroll of metropolitan firms declined by 13.6% between July 2005 and July 2007, indicating an estimated loss of 70,000 jobs.Vigdor, Jacob, \\"The Economic Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina,\\" 'The Journal of Economic Perspectives' 22 (2008): 148. The sectors most affected were service-related industries, fluctuating with the population. The only sector to truly thrive after landfall was construction, which was in high demand to make needed repairs and rebuild destroyed homes. In the first initial months following Katrina, the labor force reduced faster than the demand and unemployment rates skyrocketed. However, as of September 2006, the unemployment rates have never fallen below the national average, indicating improvement.Vigdor, Jacob, \\"The Economic Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina,\\" 'The Journal of Economic Perspective' 22 (2008): 149. In the second quarters of both 2005 and 2007, the firms' wages were increased by 21%, twice more than national increases, indicating even further improvement, although the gains were varied across the sectors.Vigdor, Jacob, \\"The Economic Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina,\\" 'The Journal of Economic Perspectives' 22 (2008): 149. There have been some suggestions concerning the usage of natural capital to further aid New Orleans's economy. One such proposal is to avoid rebuilding on flooded lands, instead restoring acres of wetlands to profit from the economic wealth. The Mississippi Delta provides the United States with one of the largest fisheries and the most important flyway terminus, enabling New Orleans to profit from these ecological industries.Costanza, Robert, et al, \\"A New Vision for New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta: Applying Ecological Economics and Ecological Engineering,\\" 'Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment' 4 (2006): 470 Furthermore, by increasing the wetlands, it would help create a natural barrier that could aid New Orleans in future storms.DETAILS OF REF It is estimated that if New Orleans was to restore of wetland lost before 2005, the natural capital would be worth an estimated $6 billion/year, or $200 billion at the present value. While New Orleans has made numerous efforts in rebuilding their economy, and has been successful with tourist-attracting events such as Mardi Gras, the natural capital provided could further assist the city in returning to its pre-Katrina wealth and economy. ==Racial disparities== Following Katrina, many said that the hurricane had greater impact on black and less economically privileged people and that it had relatively less impact on predominantly white, and wealthier people. \\"The city’s remarkable recovery has, to a troubling degree, left behind the African-Americans who still make up the majority of its population,\\" according to FiveThirtyEight. They based this on statistics showing that black residents of New Orleans are more likely to be unemployed than when the storm hit, and more likely to be living in poverty. Household incomes of blacks have also fallen, and the wage gap between black and whites has grown. All these changes are attributed in some way to Katrina. About 175,000 black residents departed New Orleans over the year following the storm, while only 100,000 returned, pushing the African American population to 59 percent, from 66 percent previously. The biggest impact has been on the middle-class blacks, given that most black professionals are older and more advanced in their careers, and the majority of the affluent and middle class are white. These setbacks to the black population in New Orleans corresponded with a large number of educated white arrivals, contributing to a high rate of business formation in the city. These newcomers have had the effect of driving up housing prices, making rent less affordable for the majority of black residents. The influence of blacks in the city receded politically, too: in 2010 New Orleans elected its first white mayor in 32 years, a white majority (5-2) took control of the City Council, which had previously been black, and a white police chief and district attorney were elected. Lance Hill of Tulane University said: \\"The perception among most African-Americans is that they are living politically as a defeated group in their own city.\\" After Hurricane Katrina, many African-Americans suffered from mental illnesses—such as PTSD—at higher rates than their Caucasian counterparts. Populations experiencing mental illnesses, especially after a natural disaster, is not uncommon. African-Americans, however, \\"had approximately two-fold greater odds of screening positive for PTSD\\" after Hurricane Katrina than whites. It is deduced that African-Americans exhibit PTSD at higher frequencies than whites because they \\"were more likely to experience frequent mental distress.\\" For example, African-Americans \\"report more negative events and chronic stressors --witnessing violence, receiving bad news, death events, lifetime major discrimination, daily discrimination--than whites, which negatively affects their mental health.\\" African-Americans \\"are more segregated than any other racial/ethnic group in the United States, and racial segregation is associated with poorer quality housing and neighborhoods that have limited resources to enhance health and well-being.\\" Another study found that the \\"[b]lack race was associated with greater symptom severity\\" of PTSD than other races. It is known that \\"[m]inority status itself has been shown to increase the risk of PTSD after trauma, though this effect may be largely because of differential exposure to poverty in violence.\\" Additionally, the \\"largely Black population of New Orleans bore a disproportionally heavy burden of predisaster chronic disease complicated by inadequate health care access.\\" ==See also== * Disaster Recovery Personal Protection Act of 2006 * Effects of Hurricane Katrina in Mississippi * Hurricane on the Bayou (film) * New Orleans diaspora * Posse Comitatus Act * Reconstruction of New Orleans * Seabrook Floodgate * Six Flags New Orleans * U.S. Army Corps of Engineers civil works controversies (New Orleans) * When the Levees Broke (film) * Zeitoun (book) ==References== ==External links== *Levees.Org (non-profit flood protection group in New Orleans) * Photos taken of Hurricane Katrina's aftermath * Video, aftermath of Hurricane Katrina * NOVA scienceNOW: Hurricanes : New Orleans' unique vulnerability to hurricanes. * U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Levee Maps * Independent Levee Investigation Team Draft Report * Orleans Parish Prison Before and After Katrina * Sexual Assault During and After Hurricane Katrina 2005 * Village Voice essay on the flood * GiveThemBack.com A National Rifle Association documentary spotlighting firearm seizures following Hurricane Katrina. * Chicago Tribune article on Katrina's destructive impact on jazz memorabilia * Katrina: The Catastrophe that Uncovered America's Race and Class Issues\\" from Tulane University Graduate * \\"The X-Codes: A Post-Katrina Postscript\\", by Dorothy Moye, Southern Spaces, August 26, 2009 * Four Years After Katrina, New Orleans Still Struggling to Recover from the Storm – video report by Democracy Now! * News Coverage, critical 26min. video compilation of cable news coverage as Katrina makes landfall – by Cultural Farming. * Imagining New Orleans Oral History Project Collection.

The phonetic part represents the exact or almost-exact pronunciation of the character when the character was first created; characters sharing the same phonetic part had the same reading. Linguists rely heavily on this fact to reconstruct the sounds of ancient Chinese. However, over time, the reading of a character may be no longer the one indicated by the phonetic part due to sound change and general vagueness.Cf. Qiu Xigui, Chinese Writing, trans. Gilbert L. Mattos and Jerry Norman, Early China Special Monograph Series No. 4, Berkeley: The Society for the Study of Early China and the Institute of East Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley, 2000, §8.6. When one encounters such a two-part character and does not know its exact pronunciation, one may take one of the parts as the phonetic indicator. For example, reading 詣 (pinyin: yì) as zhǐ because its \\"side\\" 旨 is pronounced as such. Some of this kind of \\"folk reading\\" have become acceptable over time - listed in dictionaries as alternative pronunciations, or simply become the common reading. For example, people read the character 町 ting in 西門町 (Ximending) as if it were 丁 ding. It has been called a \\"phenomenon of analogy\\", and is observed in as early as the Song Dynasty.Zhu Jianing 竺家寧, \\"Songdai yuyin de leihua xianxiang\\" 宋代語音的類化現象, in Jindai yin lunji 近代音論集, Taipei: Taiwan xuesheng shuju, 1994, pp. 159-172. ==See also== * The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy ==Notes== ==External links== * Feng, Shouzhong (S: 冯寿忠, T: 馮壽忠, P: Féng Shòuzhōng), 《与读半边有关的常用字》 (Archive), 语言文字网 Yǔyán Wénzì Wǎng。 Category:Chinese characters ","title":"Youbian dubian"},{"id":"2578925","text":"Rafael Paulo de Lara Araújo, nicknamed \\"Baby\\" and later \\"Bàbby\\" in Brazil, (; born August 12, 1980) is a Brazilian retired professional basketball player. He played for three years in the National Basketball Association. ==College career== After attending Padre Anacleto High School in São Paulo, Araújo went to the United States to play college basketball, attending Arizona Western College in Yuma, Arizona. In his freshman season (2000–01), he averaged 12.1 points and 8.4 rebounds per game.Prospect Profile: Rafael Araujo (Ha-fay-el Ar-RU-joe) Araújo later explained that AWC coach Kelly Green gave him $400 to get his visa and establish himself in Yuma, despite coaches being forbidden to do so. As a sophomore, he tallied 17.9 points and 10.7 rebounds per game, leading the Matadors to a 28-3 record and a top ten national ranking among junior colleges. He was named Region Most Valuable Player and 2nd Team NJCAA All-American. At the same time Araújo was drafted for the Brazil national basketball team at the 2002 World Championships, as NBA player Nenê could not attend the tournament. After finishing his junior college career, Araújo moved to Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah where as a junior (2002–03), he averaged 12.0 points and 8.9 rebounds per gameBrigham Young Cougars Statistics - 2002-03 (second in the Mountain West Conference). In his senior season, Araújo led BYU in scoring (18.4 points per game), rebounding (10.1 rebounds per game), steals (43 total), and blocked shots (25).Brigham Young Cougars Statistics - 2003-04 He was named Co-Player of the Year in the Mountain West Conference, sharing the honor with Air Force's Nick Welch.Araujo still eligible for MWC tourney He was named 2nd Team NCAA All-American by Basketball Times and Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press. With his size and strength, the 6-foot-11, 295-pound Araújo impressed many pro scouts during his senior season. On December 6, 2003, he dominated a tough Oklahoma State team, totaling 32 points and 17 rebounds in BYU's 76-71 upset victory.BYU 76, Oklahoma State 71 He concluded his collegiate career with a 24-point, 12-rebound performance in the Cougars' 80-75 loss to Syracuse in the NCAA Tournament.McNamara drains nine 3s for career-high 43 ==Controversy== During the 2002 World Championships in Indianapolis, Araújo tested positive for the steroid nandrolone. He was given a 24-month suspension from international play. He was subsequently found clean during tests while a player at BYU, and the NBA did not test players for steroid use.Deseret Morning News  Araujo finishing steroid suspension Araújo explained that the tests went positive because at the time he consumed a dietary supplement containing androstenedione, but he could still play because he was only suspended by FIBA, who does not sanction college basketball. Araújo was involved in multiple on-court incidents during his senior season at BYU. On March 6, 2004, Araújo was reprimanded by the Mountain West Conference (MWC) for hitting UNLV guard Jerel Blassingame during an 89-88 win.Mountain West Conference Reprimands Araujo, March 9, 2004 Six days later on March 12, in a 54-51 loss to Utah, Araujo was charged with a technical foul for elbowing the Utes' Andrew Bogut in the head in the MWC Tournament.GAME 29 RECAP -- HEARTBREAKER ENDS COUGARS VICTORY STREAK ==Professional career== The Toronto Raptors selected Araújo with the eighth pick in the 2004 NBA Draft, making him the first college senior drafted that year, one pick ahead of future NBA finals MVP Andre Iguodala. His NBA career was mostly disappointing with him seeing limited action as a rookie, averaging 3.3 points and 3.1 rebounds in 12.5 minutes per game.Rafael Araújo Player Page He set a career-high with 14 rebounds against the Sacramento Kings on January 5, 2005. Days later, on January 9, he scored a career-high 14 points against the Golden State Warriors. He later matched that total against the Kings on November 25, 2005. In the 2005-06 season, he again struggled through a disappointing year and had trouble getting playing time, averaging 11.6 minutes a game, 2.3 points, and 2.8 rebounds while shooting a dismal 36.6% from the field. Shortly after that season, Toronto GM Rob Babcock was fired, and it was rumored that the firing, in part, had to do with the drafting of Araújo.Raptors Trade Bust Araújo to Jazz The player claimed he did not play much with the Raptors because then- coach Sam Mitchell held a grudge against Babcock, and thus he did not want to put Babcock's draft pick on the court. On June 8, 2006, Araújo was traded to the Utah Jazz with an undisclosed amount of money for Kris Humphries and Robert Whaley. Many viewed this as a new beginning for Araújo, a chance for him to change the direction of his career. He worked hard in Utah, dropping his weight from 295 pounds to 275 in an effort to improve his athleticism.Big Loss for Araújo He also expressed much interest as he already played in Utah during college. However, he did not fit in well in Utah's offense, which was already set with Carlos Boozer, Andrei Kirilenko and Mehmet Okur in the frontcourt, and Araújo played sparingly during the 2006-07 season. He averaged 2.6 points and 2.4 rebounds per game in 28 games, averaging only 8.9 minutes per appearance. Araújo's rookie contract expired after the 2006-07 season, and Jazz owner Larry H. Miller said publicly that he liked Araújo and hoped he could return to the team the following season.Miller Hopes To Re-sign Araujo Araújo played for Utah in the 2007 Rocky Mountain Revue, but the Jazz signed 7-foot-1 Kyrylo Fesenko during the offseason, filling the roster spot that Araújo held previously. With that opportunity gone, and his NBA career likely over, Araújo signed a 1-year, $500,000 contract to play for Spartak St. Petersburg in Russia.Araujo finds a home with Russian Team Araújo claimed that despite the easy adaptation, his lack of European passport and Spartak's underperformances led him to leave. Araújo was in training camp with the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves for 2008 but was waived before the 2008-09 season.Timberwolves Waive Center Rafael Araujo He claimed that this happened because of the arrival of Kevin Love, and because Araújo was not in top shape due to an injured knee.Baby: “Não tive muitas chances (na NBA) e as que tive não foram justas” After a brief and failed stint at the Shanghai Sharks, in January 2009, Araújo signed with Brazilian club Flamengo for the 2009 season. The details of his contract were not revealed. He became the star of the club's team alongside Marcelinho Machado.Ex-pivô da NBA já treina no Flamengo Six months later, at the end of the 2009 season, he signed a deal with Paulistano for the 2009-10 season, and in June 2010 he transferred back to Flamengo signing a two-year contract. For his second stint at Flamengo, Araújo, for numerology reasons, changed the spelling of his nickname to \\"Bàbby\\" and his jersey number from 55 to 66. Araújo made headlines in January 2011 by shattering a glass backboard with a powerful dunk during a game in the FIBA Americas League. Video of the play was widely circulated across the Internet.Rafael Araújo Shatters Backboard In June 2011, he signed a deal with Franca Basquetebol Clube. In 2012, Araújo decided to retire, though he was open to return to basketball if he had a good proposal. In October 2012, Araujo returned to basketball, signing with Mogi das Cruzes.Baby is back after retirement He moved to Pinheiros in 2014. ==NBA career statistics== :(Correct as of 30 May 2009)Rafael Araújo NBA Stats === Regular season === -  align=\\"left\\"  2004–05  align=\\"left\\"  Toronto  59  41  12.5  .434  .333  .782  3.1  .3  .4  .1  3.3 -  align=\\"left\\"  2005–06  align=\\"left\\"  Toronto  52  34  11.6  .366  .000  .536  2.8  .3  .5  .1  2.3 -  align=\\"left\\"  2006–07  align=\\"left\\"  Utah  28  0  8.9  .415  .000  .621  2.4  .4  .2  .1  2.6 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Career  139  75  11.4  .405  .250  .679  2.8  .3  .4  .1  2.8 === Playoffs === -  align=\\"left\\"  2007  align=\\"left\\"  Utah  5  0  5.6  .375  .000  .417  2.2  .2  .2  .0  2.2 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Career  5  0  5.6  .375  .000  .417  2.2  .2  .2  .0  2.2 ==References*NBA Draft Busts *Player profile @ Flamengo.com.br *Ex-Toronto Raptor Rafael Araujo shatters backboard in Brazil (Video) Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Arizona Western Matadors men's basketball players Category:BC Spartak Saint Petersburg players Category:Brazilian expatriate basketball people in Canada Category:Brazilian expatriate basketball people in the United States Category:Brazilian expatriates in Russia Category:Brazilian men's basketball players Category:BYU Cougars men's basketball players Category:Centers (basketball) Category:Club Athletico Paulistano basketball players Category:Esporte Clube Pinheiros basketball players Category:Expatriate sportspeople in Canada Category:Flamengo basketball players Category:Franca Basquetebol Clube players Category:Mogi das Cruzes Basquete players Category:National Basketball Association players from Brazil Category:Novo Basquete Brasil players Category:Sportspeople from Curitiba Category:Toronto Raptors draft picks Category:Toronto Raptors players Category:Utah Jazz players Category:2002 FIBA World Championship players ","title":"Rafael Araújo (basketball)"},{"id":"2578926","text":"Wheel alignment sometimes referred to as breaking, or tracking is part of standard automobile maintenance that consists of adjusting the angles of wheels to the car manufacturer specifications. The purpose of these adjustments is to reduce tire wear and to ensure that vehicle travel is straight and true (without \\"pulling\\" to one side). Alignment angles can also be altered beyond the maker's specifications to obtain a specific handling characteristic. Motorsport and off-road applications may call for angles to be adjusted well beyond normal, for a variety of reasons. An increasing number of modern vehicles have advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) such as electronic stability control, anti-lock brakes, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control and traction control. These systems can be affected by mechanical alignment adjustments. This has led many manufacturers to require electronic resets for these systems after a mechanical alignment is performed. == Primary angles == The primary angles are the basic angle alignment of the wheels relative to each other and to the car body. These adjustments are the camber, caster and toe. On some cars, not all of these can be adjusted on every wheel. These three parameters can be further categorized into front and rear (with no caster on the rear, typically not being steered wheels). In summary, the parameters are: * Front: Caster (left & right) * Front: Camber (left & right) * Front: Toe (left, right & total) * Rear: Camber (left & right) * Rear: Toe (left, right & total) == Secondary angles == The secondary angles include numerous other adjustments, such as: * SAI (Steering Axis Inclination) (left & right) * Included angle (left & right) * Toe out on turns (left & right) * Maximum Turns (left & right) * Toe curve change (left & right) * Track width difference * Wheelbase difference * Front ride height (left & right) * Rear ride height (left & right) * Frame angle * Setback (front & rear) Setback is the difference between right side and left side wheelbase length. It can also be measured as an angle. Setback less than the manufacturer specified tolerance (for example about 6mm) does not affect car handling. That's because, when the vehicle is turning, one wheel is ahead of the other by several centimetres and therefore the setback is negligible. There are even some car models with different factory setting for right and left side wheelbase length, for various design reasons. An off-spec setback may occur because of a collision or a difference between right and left caster. Rake is the difference between the front ride heights and the rear ride heights, a positive number when the rear ride height is larger. == Measurement == A camera unit (sometimes called a \\"head\\") is attached to a specially designed clamp which holds on to a wheel. There are usually four camera units in a wheel alignment system (a camera unit for each wheel). The camera units communicate their physical positioning with respect to other camera units to a central computer which calculates and displays. Often with alignment equipment, these \\"heads\\" can be a large precision reflector. In this case, the alignment \\"tower\\" contains the cameras as well as arrays of LEDs. This system flashes one array of LEDs for each reflector whilst a camera centrally located in the LED array \\"looks for\\" an image of the reflectors patterned face. These cameras perform the same function as the other style of alignment equipment, yet alleviate numerous issues prone to relocating a heavy precision camera assembly on each vehicle serviced. == Camber == Camber is the angle which the vertical axis of the wheel makes with the vertical axis of the vehicle. This angle is very important for the cornering performance of the vehicles. Generally a Camber around 0.5-2 degrees is given on the vehicles. Depending upon wheel orientation, Camber can be of three types. 1\\\\. Positive Camber The Camber would be called positive when the top of the wheels lean outwards. Positive Camber is generally used in off-road vehicles. This is because, it improves the steering response and decreases the steering efforts required for turning the vehicle. Positive Camber is also provided in load carrying vehicles. This is because the heavy load on these vehicles cause outward leaning wheels to straighten up, improving the vehicle stability. 2\\\\. Zero Camber The vehicle is said to have zero Camber when the wheels stand perfectly straight on the ground. 3\\\\. Negative Camber Negative Camber is encountered when the top of the wheels lean inwards. Providing Negative Camber improves the cornering performance. When the vehicle turns on a corner, it performs a circular motion. Hence, it experiences equal and opposite centripetal & centrifugal forces. The centripetal force is experienced in the form of friction on tyres. The centrifugal force experienced by the car tries to throw it away from the turning center. This increases the normal reaction on the outer wheels. Due to increase in normal reaction, the frictional force on the outer tyres also increase. This friction acts as centripetal force and tries to bend the outer tires inwards. The tires get deformed due to bending and the contact area between the wheels and the ground decreases. This in turns decreases the frictional force between the outer tires and the ground causing the vehicle to drift during cornering. Hence a negative Camber is given to the vehicles. The negatively cambered wheels lean inwards. So during cornering when the frictional forces try to deform the outer wheels, they just simply get flat on ground increasing the friction with road surface. == Signs of a Bad Wheel Alignment == * The vehicle pulls to one side * The steering wheel doesn’t return to center * The steering wheel is off center * Excessive tire wear in certain spots * Loose steering == See also == * Auto mechanic * ASE * Car handling * Car maintenance * Tire balance * Tire rotation ==References== == External links == * Wheel Alignment Category:Motor vehicle maintenance Category:Vehicle dynamics Alignment ","title":"Wheel alignment"},{"id":"2578934","text":"Seal of the Prelature of Opus Dei and the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross The Priestly Society of the Holy Cross is an association of Catholic diocesan priests which is integrally united to the Prelature of Opus Dei. Part of the society is made up of the clergy of the Opus Dei prelature—members of the priesthood who fall under the jurisdiction of the Opus Dei prelature are automatically members of the Priestly Society. Other members in the society are traditional diocesan priests--- clergy who remain under the jurisdiction of their diocesan bishop. Technically speaking, such diocesan priests have not \\"joined\\" Opus Dei membership, although they have joined a society that is closely affiliated with Opus Dei. ==Foundation and mission== The Priestly Society of the Holy Cross was begun by St. Josemaría Escrivá on 14 February 1943, and received its first canonical approval a few months later. He was always concerned that his message of sanctification of ordinary work be transmitted also to the secular clergy. He even said that he was willing to leave Opus Dei, as Abraham offered up his son Isaac, to be able to help the clergy. But on February 14, 1943, he said he received an illumination from God on how to continue serving both the laity and the diocesan clergy. During Mass at the women's center of Opus Dei, he was shown the seal of Opus Dei and of the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross: a cross embracing the world. He was also shown the juridical solution to put the two together. The priests would be part of a society united to Opus Dei, but the diocesan priests would continue to be priests of their dioceses, and thus there will be no conflict with the bishops. The first priests of the Priestly Society were the numerary members of Opus Dei, who as such are automatically members of the Society. The first three priests ordained as members of the Society were: Álvaro del Portillo, José Luis Muzquiz and José María Hernández Garnica. The need for this type of association has been explained in the following way: :As many priests can testify, loneliness can be the most difficult Cross to embrace. However, there are remedies for loneliness, and priests are free to seek for that help upon which their happiness largely relies. Diocesan priests can certainly establish their own support groups for prayer, socializing, exercise, and relaxation. But normally that is not enough. In #29 of the DLMP, the document, echoing the Second Vatican Council (Presbyterorum ordinis, #8) and the Code of Canon Law (C 550, n. 2), highly praises “those associations which support priestly fraternity, sanctity in the exercise of their ministry, and communion with the Bishop and with the entire Church”. ==Establishment by Pope John Paul II == According to the Apostolic Constitution Ut sit issued by John Paul II: “From its beginnings, this (Opus Dei) has in fact striven, not only to illuminate with new lights the mission of the laity in the Church and in society, but also to put it into practice; it has also endeavored to put into practice the teaching of the universal call to sanctity, and to promote at all levels of society the sanctification of ordinary work, and by means of ordinary work. Furthermore, through the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, it has helped diocesan priests to live this teaching, in the exercise of their sacred ministry.” Through this document, John Paul II, aside from erecting Opus Dei as a personal prelature, also erected the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross “as a priestly Association intrinsically united to the Prelature.” ==Composition== It is made up first of all of the clergy of the Prelature who are automatically members. Secondly, it is made up of diocesan priests, deacons, and bishops. Some Opus Dei members also serve as bishops in various dioceses throughout the world, including the United States, Europe, South America, Africa and China. The prelate of Opus Dei is the president of the society. These diocesan clergy of the Priestly Society are not incardinated into the presbyterate of the Prelature. They depend solely on their bishop and receive spiritual help from the Society to fulfill their priestly duties well. According to the Annuario Pontificio, there were 1996 priests of the Prelature in the year 2009. John Allen stated there were roughly two thousand diocesan priests who belonged to society who were not clergy of the prelature, thus the total membership of the society is around 4000 priests. ==Formation== The priests are given the same formation as the lay faithful of Opus Dei. St. Josemaría always said that he has “the same cooking pot” for his children: classes on doctrine, ascetical formation, spiritual direction, recollections, retreats, etc. ==Membership== There are around 4000 priests, bishops and deacons around the world who are members of the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross.

He was born in today's Chungcheongbuk-do, South Korea, and was taken to Japan during the Japanese occupation of Korea when he was eight years old. Choi later stated that he became a student of Takeda Sōkaku, and studied a form of jujutsu known as Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu (大東流合気柔術) while in Japan.허인욱의 무인이야기 장보고와 정년 그리고 송징 This is disputed by some parties, due to the historically acrimonious relationship between Japan and Korea, and lack of clear documentary evidence (see below). Choi returned to Korea after the end of World War II and in 1948 began teaching his art at a brewery owned by the father of his first student Seo Bok-Seob (; Suh Bok-Sub). He first called his art \\"Yu Sul ()\\" or \\"Yawara (; 柔術)\\" later changing it to \\"Yu Kwon Sool (; 柔拳術)\\" and \\"Hap Ki Yu Kwon Sool (; 合氣柔拳術)\\" and eventually Hapkido.Hentz, Eric (editor), Taekwondo Times Vol. 16, No. 8. Tri-Mount Publications, Iowa 1996. \\"The Beginning of Hapkido; An Interview with Hapkido Master Seo, Bok-Seob\\" by Mike Wollmershauser. Choi Yong-Sool was honored with the titles doju (; 道主), which can be translated as \\"Keeper of the way\\", and changsija (; 創始者), which simply means \\"founder\\". The arts of Hapkido, modern Hwa Rang Do, Kuk Sool Won, as well as lesser known arts such as Han Pul all show influence of the teachings of Master Choi.Kim, He-Young. Hapkido (alternately The Hapkido Bible). Andrew Jackson Press, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 1991. == Biography == It is generally accepted that Choi was born in the year 1904, although some sources place his birth in 1899. Confusion about his age stem from a combination of being orphaned, delays in registering newborns with the government (common in impoverished Korea) and the way in which age is reckoned in Korea. His mother died when he was 2 years old, and his father died sometime after that, leaving Choi in the care of his aunt. According to Choi he was abducted from his home village of Yong Dong in Chungcheongbuk-do in 1912 by a Japanese sweet merchant named Morimoto who had lost his own sons and wished to adopt Choi. Choi resisted and proved so troublesome to the candymaker that he was abandoned in the streets of Moji, Japan. Choi made his way to Osaka as a beggar and, after having been picked up by police, was placed in a Buddhist temple which cared for orphans in Kyoto. The abbot of the temple was a monk named Wantanabe Kintaro.Posthumously Released Interview with Choi Yong-Sool (1982) . Choi spent 2 years at the temple and had a difficult life there, not only in school but with the other children due to his poor Japanese language skills and his Korean ethnicity, which made him stand out in Japan. When Watanabe asked Choi what direction that he wished for his life to take he expressed interest in the martial arts. This matched the boy's temperament: Choi had a tendency to get into fights and he had an intense interest in the war scenes depicted in the temple's murals. The temple monk (Wantanabe Kintaro) was reputedly a friend of Takeda Sōkaku, the founder of the Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu system, which is a Japanese martial arts system emphasizing empty handed methods based upon the sword styles and jujutsu tactics in which Takeda was an expert. Later Takeda Sōkaku would also famously teach Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of aikido. During the Japanese occupation of Korea, all Koreans working in Japan were required to take on a Japanese name. Choi is said to have been assigned the Japanese name Asao Yoshida (吉田朝男) when he was 11 years old, according to a posthumously released interview, or Yoshida Tatujutsu, according to Seo Bok-Seob. Choi says he was taken to Takeda's home and dojo in Akita on Shin Shu mountain where he lived and trained with the master for 30 years. The interview also asserts that: Choi traveled with Takeda as a teaching assistant, Choi led Takeda's demonstration team that presented in Hawaii (circa 1932), Choi was employed to catch war deserters, and that Choi was the only student to have a complete understanding of the system taught by Takeda. Note that Choi's claim to having studied under Takeda is quite controversial in Daito-ryu circles, but is nevertheless quoted by many contemporary hapkidoists. Other sources place Choi as a mere servant in the Takeda household, while still others assert that Choi had no connection to Takeda beyond attending some of Takeda's seminars. Kisshomaru Ueshiba, son of Morihei Ueshiba, stated that his father had told him that Choi had attended seminars held by Takeda with his father in Hokkaidō and that his father had been Choi's senior.Pranin, S. (1988). Aikido Journal, AikiNews, 77. Interview with Kisshomaru Ueshiba: The Early Days of Aikido . Choi apparently contacted Kisshomaru upon hearing the news of Morihei's death. Retouched photograph of Takeda Sōkaku circa 1888 Regardless of the circumstances of Choi's martial arts training, he returned to Korea after World War II and settled in Daegu, first selling sweets and later raising hogs. In 1948, after becoming involved in an altercation with several men in a dispute over grain at the Seo Brewing Company, the son of the chairman of the brewery, Seo Bok-seob, was so impressed by his self-defense skills that Seo invited Choi to teach the brewery's employees at a makeshift dojang that Seo had created on the premises for that purpose. In this way, Seo Bok-seob became Choi Yong-sool's first student. Later Choi became a bodyguard to Seo's father, who was an important congressman in Daegu. == Spreading the art == In 1951, Choi and Seo opened up the Daehan Hapki Yu Kwon Sool Dojang (), the first formal school to teach the art. In 1958 Choi Yong-sool opened up his own school using the shortened name Hapkido for the first time. Both schools were located in Daegu. Some of the more important students from this period of time were Kim Moo-Hong () and Moon Jong-Won (). Apparently Choi also taught people on his farm during the early years of the art and it was in this way that Ji Han-Jae (), one of the great exploiters of the art, came to learn from Choi.이소룡과 대결했던 합기도고수 지한재 방한 세미나 2010-01-12 chosun.com The founders of two arts, Lee Joo-Bang () of modern Hwa Rang Do and Seo In-Hyuk (; Suh In-Hyuk) of Kuk Sool Won, are thought by some to have trained with Choi Yong-Sool, although this is controversial. Others assert that their training came from Kim Moo-Hong's hapkido school in Seoul, with which they were known to have been associated. In 1963, Choi became the first Chairman of the Korea Kido Association (Daehan Ki Do Hwe; ) and appointed one of his most senior students, Kim Jeong-Yoon (; also rendered Kim Jung-Yun) as Secretary General. Later, Kim separated from the hapkido organizations to form his own Han Pul Hapkido organization, although his art remains firmly based in the teachings of Choi Yong-sool.Kim, Jeong-Yoon. Personal interview with Matthew Rogers. Seoul. 1995. Another prominent top student who became crucial to the survival of Doju Choi's full system was Chinil Chang, the personally chosen second Doju (Grandmaster) and the only man awarded the 10th Dan and the title of Doju directly from Doju Choi. Students of importance who were trained by Choi during the later periods of his teaching were Kim Jeong-yoon, Kim Yoon-Sang () who later went on to form his own offshoot Hapki yusul organization to fabricate and support his erroneous and misguided claims of being the surviving grandmaster of hapkido.Spiedel, Rod. \\"Yong Sool Kwan; History of the Hapkido Hapkisul Headquarters\\". Taekwondo Times. Nov. 2006/Vol.26. No.6. Article compiled by Barrie Restall. and Park Jeong-Hwan (), who trained under Choi for only three years, is one of the later students that opened a Hapkido school in America, several of which still function today.Master Park Doju Choi made a special trip to the United States in 1982, several years prior to his death, to visit his highest ranked instructor Chinil Chang in New York City and to preside over the creation of the US Hapkido Association. Master Mike Wollmershauser, who was the only American to have trained under Choi Yong-sool himself, documented part of this historic visit on videotape, which is in the hands of Doju Chinil Chang. Doju Choi's final wishes were to spread Hap Ki Do all over the world as well as to unite the art as one family, although Doju Choi had realized at that point that the system had splintered into too many political and warring factions for that to ever happen. He also wished to keep his original system intact and for the lineage to be passed in a complete manner to his successor, which he accomplished. Master Wollmershauser attempted to spread this word of unity throughout the world until his death in December 2002. Doju Chang maintains the integrity and purpose of his mission while continuing to teach his students as he has since arriving in the United States decades ago. == Controversy == Choi's claims of being a student of Daito-ryu under Takeda Sokaku are contested and unsupported by the fee and attendance records of Takeda Sokaku that still exist today. However, according to Kisshomaru Ueshiba, son of Aikido founder Morihei Ueshiba, a young Korean was present at several of Takeda's seminars, suggesting that some Korean nationals had some formal training in Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu. One can only speculate as to why Choi's name is not on the otherwise meticulous records. The claim by some that the lack of documentation was due to his Korean ancestry is difficult to uphold since other Korean students are mentioned in the records. Others claim that, since Choi was Takeda's house servant, it is logical to assume he was trained by him or at least in his dojo. There is a strong similarity to the techniques taught in Daito-ryu and the techniques of Hapkido. The source of the name Hapkido is also disputed. Choi Yong-Sool's student, Ji Han-Jae, claims to have coined the name for the art. Seo Bok-Seob states in a 1980 interview that Jung Moo Kwan first used the term to refer to the art as well as introducing the symbol of the eagle to represent the art. == Successor == A direct student of Choi, Chinil Chang inherited the title of Doju in Choi's personal and complete system of Hapkido on January 15, 1985, becoming the second direct lineage Grandmaster. On April 5, 1985 Choi personally awarded Chang the only existing 10th Dan certificate in Hapkido history. Chang also had the privilege and honor of being the first Hapkido master awarded the 9th Dan certificate by Choi in 1980. A large inauguration ceremony followed on April 11, 1985. The historic event was covered and documented by Korea Sports News and MBC Korean Television. Choi Young-sool, Chang, and Choi's son, the late Choi Bok-Yeol, were in attendance. Chang is the only Hapkido master ever awarded the 10th Dan and Doju title directly from Choi. Choi left the full documentation and recordings of the system to Chang, who continued to research and document the full history and development of Hapkido. Furthermore, the future Grandmaster, who was a personally trained, closed-door disciple of Choi, was given Letter of Appointment certificates, the second dated December 1, 1977 and the third dated March 5, 1980. This gave Chang more progressive power and authority in Choi's Hapkido Association. These specific certificates, along with his 9th Dan ranking in 1980, and 10th Dan ranking in 1985, amply demonstrate that Choi was grooming Chang to be the future Grandmaster of Hapkido. Chang's intimate video interview(one of several over decades) with his teacher Doju Choi during his visit to New York City has been abused through numerous interpretations and translations. Some have even claimed erroneously to have conducted the interview themselves, further clouding and distorting the truth and gravity inherent in the interview. These endless distortions were generally rebutted in various media each time they appeared. In 2013, Doju Chang was teaching a small group in NYC dedicated to the preservation of Hapkido, after previously maintaining a commercial school for decades, as well as a stint teaching Hapkido at the United Nations. Many detractors have spread endless conjecture about him. One lineage created further controversy by stating Choi passed the system to his only son, Choi Bok-Yeol, which is incorrect, misleading, and insulting to the legacy and wishes of Choi. Black Belt Magazine, respecting Chinil Chang as the second lineage successor, asked him to write a brief obituary on Choi that appeared in the April 1987 issue. Doju Chang passed away peacefully in his sleep on February 23, 2018 at the age of 77 as a result of Hypertensive Cardiovascular Disease. == Students == Many people have claimed to be students of Choi Yong- sool, and it is often hard to verify whether or not these claims are valid. This is a list of people who were long time students of Choi. *Chinil Chang (the second direct lineage Grandmaster was awarded the only 10th Dan in Hapkido and the title of second direct lineage Doju by Dojunim Choi on January 15, 1985.) * Seo Bok-Seob (; Choi's first student in 1946) * Ji Han-Jae (; student #14 of Choi in 1955, Founder of the Korea Hapkido Association and Sin Moo Hapkido, and Sung Moo Kwan in Andong) ** Kwon Tae-Man (; First founder of a hapkido dojang in Incheon) ** Kim Yong-Jin (; Founder of the Ulchi Kwan) ** Myung Jae-Nam (; Founder of Hankido and Hankumdo) ** Oh Se-Lim (; former president of Korea Hapkido Federation) ** Myung Kwang-Sik (; Founder of the World Hapkido Federation) * Kim Moo-Hong (; Choi's student in 1955, Founder of the Korean Hapkido Association and Shin Moo Kwan in Daegu) ** Kim Jung-Soo (; still teaching in Daegu) ** Won Kwang-Hwa (; Founder of the Moo Sool Kwan) * Lim Hyun-Soo (; He was promoted to 9th Dan(No. 2) by Choi Yong-Sool.

It was merged into a new promotional organisation, TheCityUK, in 2010. It was formerly known as British Invisibles.Litterick, David. \\"British Invisibles given makeover,\\" The Telegraph (London). 5 February 2001; Beder, Sharon. (2006). Suiting Themselves :How Corporations Drive the Global Agenda, p. 138. ==History== British Invisibles itself originated in the Committee on Invisible Exports, set up in April 1968 by the Bank of England and then became the British Invisible Exports Council. It was largely the idea of Cyril Kleinwort who realised that the government was paying much attention to the UK's balance of trade in goods, but little to the UK's invisible earnings from services. In 1984 Patrick Pery, 6th Earl of Limerick had become Chairman of the organisation by which time invisible earnings were accounting for a third of the UK's earnings. He stayed until 1991. On 19 October 1990 the organisation (registered as a company) became British Invisibles. In January 1998 it merged with CEENET, a company set up by the Corporation of London to promote financial services to Eastern Europe, and re-branded itself as BI. It acquired a new Chief Executive, Jeremy Seddon, and a new Deputy Chief Executive, Henrietta Royle. Charlie Haswell joined the executive team, and later the Board, on secondment from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to develop links with British Embassies and High Commissions around the world. The company was a membership organisation and focused on running promotional events abroad for its members (primarily in the emerging markets), undertaking research on the performance of the financial services industry and providing the secretariat for financial services lobbying in the WTO. BI became known as IFSL on 1 February 2001. Invisibles historically have consisted of services (financial and legal), investment income and transfers. The organisation has in the past published The City Table, giving the order of financial services companies. With effect from 1 June 2010 IFSL, the independent organisation representing the UK financial services industry internationally, has merged its activities, staff and business membership into TheCityUK, the new promotional body for the UK-based industry. TheCityUK is continuing IFSL's work of promoting the industry around the world, influencing trade policy and regulation, and publishing definitive research on the sector. ==Membership== IFSL had a membership drawn from across the spectrum of the UK's financial and related business services, including trade and professional associations, exchanges, the Bank of England, the City of London Corporation and leading international financial service companies that based in London. IFSL also worked closely with Government departments, including UK Trade & Investment, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, HM Treasury, and the Office for National Statistics. ==Aims== IFSL promoted the international activities of UK-based financial institutions, through business events in the UK and worldwide. Through its Liberalisation of Trade In Services (LOTIS) Committee, IFSL brought together government and the industry in working for the removal of barriers to trade in financial services. It also promoted public-private partnerships (PPPs), which involve large quantities of private finance. ==Structure== Its last chairman was Lord Levene of Portsoken, and its last president was the Duke of Kent. ==Notes== ==References== * Beder, Sharon.

He was the son of John Jay Phelps, a successful New York City merchant and financier, and was born in Dundaff, Pennsylvania. Prior to being elected to the United States House of Representatives he had a successful banking career in Manhattan, settling in Teaneck, New Jersey, across the Hudson River. ==Early life== Young Phelps' first school experience was at Mount Washington Institute in New York. He was described by contemporaries as a round-faced, rosy-cheeked boy, with sparkling dark eyes; active though not physically strong. Phelps then attended private school at Golden Hill near Bridgeport, Connecticut, where his academic advancement was so rapid that he was fully prepared for college at the age of 15. He graduated from Yale University in 1860, valedictorian of his class and a member of Skull and Bones. In the same year he married Ellen Maria Sheffield of New Haven, Connecticut. They traveled in Europe, where, in Paris, in 1861, their first child, John Jay II, was born. Phelps attended Columbia Law School, graduating in 1863. Following this, he practiced corporate law in New York City. In 1864, their second child, Sheffield, was born. Phelps followed the family career in banking and industry, serving as a director for the National City Bank, the Second National Bank of New York, the United States Trust Co., the Farmer's Loan & Trust Co. and nine railroads. After the birth of his two sons, he bought a summer home in Bergen County an old-fashioned Dutch farmhouse on the \\"Teaneck Ridge,\\" an area of Teaneck now adjacent to Route 4 that had been the Garret-Brinkerhoff House in Revolutionary War days. Phelps extensively renovated the old homestead, converting it into one of the most beautiful and celebrated mansions of its time. In 1868, the last child, Marian, was born; she would go on to give birth to his grandson Phelps Phelps. In 1869, following the death of his father, John Jay, Phelps retired from his law practice and moved the family full-time to Teaneck. ==Congressman== William Walter Phelps Combining eloquence with an interest in politics, Phelps, a Republican, sought and won a seat in the United States House of Representatives in 1872 at the age of 34, representing New Jersey in the 43rd congress. During his first term in Congress. Phelps was considered by his colleagues to be a serious, well-versed and mature public servant - a successful young lawyer, ambitious, with money and energy who was expected to make his mark on politics and statesmanship. Phelps failed in his first bid for reelection, in 1874. After his term ended, Phelps returned in 1875 to his Teaneck home, where he planned improvements to the homestead and looked for additional land investments nearby. In the next year, he embarked upon a European tour, partly to regain his health which had suffered from a bout of typhoid fever. While abroad, Phelps investigated institutions of learning and art in England, France and Germany, and enjoyed the society of scholars, authors and scientists. ==Arboriculturist== Returning to the United States, Phelps spent most of his time resting and working on his most important hobby—his estate. His great passion was trees and the woods; he was a devotee of arboriculture. Between 1875 and 1880 Phelps was responsible for planting approximately 600,000 trees of numerous varieties. In 1880 Phelps was selected to manage the Republican Presidential campaign but he was unable to complete the assignment because of feeble health. In 1881, President James A. Garfield named Phelps as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Austria- Hungary, but he held this post for only a few months, resigning after Garfield was assassinated. Still active in politics, Phelps was re-elected to Congress in 1883, 1885 and again in 1887. ==Art collector== In 1886 the Phelps mansion was completed. At Christmas time the family held a glorious celebration with people from all over the country viewing the mansion for the first time. Phelps' favorite room was a gallery which he had designed himself to hold his priceless collection of art treasures from the ends of the earth. It was nearly midnight on April 1, 1888 when Phelps, returning to his apartments in Washington, D.C. after an evening with friends, found on the table in his bedroom two telegrams which told him that his mansion in Teaneck, where his family then was, had been totally destroyed by fire, with a loss of nearly all its valuable contents. He disturbed no one upon receiving this startling news, but very early in the morning awakened his secretary, told him what had happened, and said that he was going to take an immediate train for New York. He left on the train without once alluding to the great calamity. The mansion, once the most beautiful in the area, became known as \\"Phelps' Ruin\\" and local residents picnicked near the destroyed home, marveling at what it once had been. Phelps immediately began renovation of the house. ==German Ambassador== In 1889, William Phelps was appointed by president Benjamin Harrison as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Germany. On October 11, 1889, William Phelps was presented to the German Empress at a gala performance at the Royal Opera House, given in honor of the Czar of Russia. Phelps remained in the post for one year until a case of homesickness prompted his request for a short leave of absence. He sailed for America in September 1890. In his diary Phelps wrote, Phelps returned to Germany a year later, remaining in this post until January 1893, when his health began to suffer due to the climate. He traveled south, vacationing in Spain, Morocco, Tunis, Algiers and Italy, hoping the climate would improve his health. ==State judge and final days== While Phelps was vacationing, Governor of New Jersey George T. Werts appointed him Judge of the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals, then the state's highest court. Turning over the affairs of the legation to his successor, Phelps again returned to the United States to be sworn into his judicial role on June 20, 1893. In February 1894, Phelps' throat began to trouble him seriously, and the illness confined him to his home for days. He continued to try to keep up with his work and was present until the adjournment of the term. A few days later he traveled to the Hygeia Hotel at Old Point Comfort in Virginia, a resort that in the past had been a place of rest for him. Phelps became withdrawn and quiet, an attitude brought on by his physical inability to converse. The last entry in his diary is dated April 10, 1894. Phelps moved himself to Hot Springs, Virginia, where he enjoyed a temporary return of strength. Finding no lasting improvement in his health in Hot Springs, Phelps returned to his home in Teaneck on May 18. By May 31 he was bedridden, and in June he lapsed into a coma. He died June 17, 1894. Hundreds of people lined the streets of Teaneck and Englewood to honor his funeral procession. The trees he had planted himself lined the path of this final journey. At the time of his death, Phelps owned half of what is presently Teaneck. ==References== ==External links== *Teaneck Public Library Virtual Village Website *William Walter Phelps, Congressman, Ambassador, and Judge *William Walter Phelps at The Political Graveyard * Category:1839 births Category:1894 deaths Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from New Jersey Category:New Jersey Republicans Category:Ambassadors of the United States to Austria-Hungary Category:Ambassadors of the United States to Germany Category:19th-century American railroad executives Category:New Jersey state court judges Category:New York (state) lawyers Category:Yale University alumni Category:Columbia Law School alumni Category:People from Teaneck, New Jersey Category:19th-century American diplomats Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Virginia Republicans ","title":"William Walter Phelps"},{"id":"2579000","text":"Braised duck, Teochew style Chinese angelica In cooking and gastronomy, duck or duckling is the meat of several species of bird in the family Anatidae, found in both fresh and salt water. Duck is eaten in many cuisines around the world. It is a high-fat, high-protein meat rich in iron. Duckling nominally comes from a juvenile animal, but may be simply a menu name. One species of freshwater duck, the mallard, has been domesticated and is a common livestock bird in many cultures. The Pekin duck is another livestock species of importance, particularly in North America. Magret refers specifically to the breast of a mulard or Muscovy (or Barbary) duck that has been force fed to produce foie gras. == Duck meat == Duck meat is derived primarily from the breasts and legs of ducks. Like all poultry meat, the meat is categorically classed as white meat despite the colour being slightly darker than normal poultry. The meat of the legs is darker and somewhat fattier than the meat of the breasts, although the breast meat is darker than the breast meat of a chicken or a turkey. Being waterfowl, ducks have a layer of heat-insulating subcutaneous fat between the skin and the meat. Duck breast topped with foie gras De-boned duck breast can be grilled like steak, usually leaving the skin and fat on. Internal organs such as heart and kidneys may also be eaten; the liver in particular is often used as a substitute for goose liver in foie gras. Duck is particularly predominant in the Chinese cuisine—a popular dish is Peking duck, which is made from the Pekin duck. Duck meat is commonly eaten with scallions, cucumbers and hoisin sauce wrapped in a small spring pancake made of flour and water or a soft, risen bun known as gua bao. The Pekin duck is also the most common duck meat consumed in the United States, and according to the USDA, nearly 26 million ducks were eaten in the U.S. in 2004. Because most commercially raised Pekins come from Long Island, New York, Pekins are also sometimes called \\"Long Island\\" ducks, despite being of Chinese origin. Some specialty breeds have become more popular in recent years, notably the Muscovy duck, and the mulard duck (a sterile hybrid of Pekins and Muscovies). Unlike most other domesticated ducks, Muscovy ducks are not descended from mallards. == Nutrition == Duck meat is very high in cholesterol and fat, particularly saturated fat. It is also very high in protein and iron and is generally nutritious and filling for those who can tolerate the high fat content. Slow cooking using methods of cooking which allow drainage of the grease can partially alleviate the high fat content, though duck meat will always be a high-fat food. == Duck dishes == Duck rice Peking duck Duck is used in a variety of dishes around the world, most of which involve roasting for at least part of the cooking process to aid in crisping the skin. Some dishes use parts of the duck as an ingredient along with other ingredients. Notable duck dishes include: * Ballotine * Balut is a developing bird embryo boiled and eaten from the shell. It is sold as street-food in the Philippines and around Southeast Asia.Regional names. * Bebek Betutu – a famous traditional dish from Bali, Indonesia. The duck is first seasoned with pungent roots and various herbs, wrapped with banana leaves, and roasted. Chicken is also used to prepare Betutu. * Chicken and duck blood soup * Duck blood and vermicelli soup * Duck confit – duck legs that have been cured (partly or fully) in salt, then marinated and poached in duck fat, typically with garlic and other herbs. The French word confit means \\"preserved\\", and the French name for duck confit is \\"confit de canard\\". * Czernina – a sweet and sour Polish soup made of duck blood and clear poultry broth. It was once considered a symbol of Polish culture until the 19th century, customarily served to young men and is even featured as a plot device in a famous epic poem called Pan Tadeusz. * Duck à l'orange – a classic French dish in which the duck is roasted and served with an orange sauce. * Duck rice – A traditional Singaporean dish made of roast duck and white rice * Duck Bamboo Curry – a traditional dish of Sylhet region * Foie gras – a specially fattened and rich liver, or a pâté made from the liver, sometimes taken from a goose but usually from a duck. * Long Island roast duckling – this is a whole roasted bird, sometimes brined previously. When done properly, most of the fat melts off during the cooking process, leaving a crispy skin and well-done meat. Some restaurants on Long Island serve this dish with a cherry sauce. * Guyanese duck curry * Kamo nabe – duck hot pot * Kamo Nanban – soba or udon with duck meat and leeks * Lemon duck * Nanjing Salted Duck * Oritang – a variety of guk, Korean soup made with duck and various vegetables. * Peking duck – a famous Chinese dish originating from Beijing, prepared since the Ming Dynasty era. It is prized for the thin, crispy skin, with authentic versions of the dish serving mostly the skin and little meat, and eaten with pancakes, scallions, and hoisin sauce or sweet bean sauce. * Pressed duck – a complex dish originally from Rouen, France. * Rouennaise sauce – prepared using puréed duck liver as an ingredient * Tiết canh * Turducken: an American dish that comprises a turkey, stuffed with a duck, which is in turn stuffed with a chicken. * Wuhan duck * Yuhwang ori * Zhangcha duck – a quintessential dish of Sichuan cuisine. It is first prepared by smoking a marinated duck over tea leaves and twigs of the camphor plant, then steamed, and finally deep fried for a crisp finish. Also called tea-smoked duck. == Pollution contaminating wild duck == Ducks caught in the wild may be contaminated from pollution of rivers and other bodies of water, because they eat fish and other aquatic life.

A Democrat, he served in the California State Senate and, for approximately three months, in the California State Assembly. Alarcon first served as an assistant to Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley before gaining a seat on the City Council to represent the 7th District in 1993. One year into his second term as a City Councilman, Alarcon resigned to become a State Senator in 1998, representing the 20th Senate district. Term limits prevented him from seeking a third Senate term in December 2006. Among Alarcon's accomplishments while in the California Senate were workers' compensation reform and recovery funding for the community of Northridge following the deadly earthquake of 1994. Alarcon served as Majority Whip during all eight of his years in the State Senate. During the San Fernando Valley secession movement of 2002, there was talk that if the Valley seceded, Alarcon might become mayor of the new city. Alarcon decided not to run for Valley mayor, and instead opposed secession.Raphael Sonenshien, The City at Stake, p. 231 Alarcon's council district was the most opposed to secession of any district in the San Fernando Valley. In 2005, Alarcon ran for mayor of Los Angeles. He finished a distant fifth, gaining less than 2% of the vote, behind Bernard Parks, Bob Hertzberg, incumbent James Hahn, and Antonio Villaraigosa. After serving as a state senator for 8 years, in 2006 Alarcon ran unopposed for California's 39th State Assembly district representing the San Fernando Valley area. Shortly after winning office, Alarcon announced his intention to seek a third term in 2007 as Los Angeles City Councilman in the 7th district, replacing Alex Padilla, who was resigning after winning a seat on State Senate. In the special election, held in March, Alarcon won easily (receiving 54% to 29% for his closest opponent). He resigned from the Assembly soon thereafter. His 102-day tenure in the Assembly was the shortest service in the California legislature since 1981, excluding one person elected but not sworn in. Richard Alarcon has four children who were educated in public schools in the San Fernando Valley. He is a former teacher. Alarcon lost a son to a fatal car accident. He is a graduate of California State University, Northridge. He is Roman Catholic. ==Residency scandal== In August 2010 Alarcon was indicted on perjury and voter fraud charges for not living in his district and lying in campaign disclosure documents about his official residence. Six members of his staff—chief of staff Saeed Ali as well as Becca Doten, Ackley Padilla, Lidia Soto, Nancy Hodges and John de la Rosa—testified in front of a grand jury on July 7. He has raised at least $9,000 from donors to cover legal fees he may face as the investigation continues. The charges were dismissed by Judge Kathleen Kennedy in May 2012, but District Attorney Steve Cooley refiled them. Alarcon was charged with 18 counts involving false declaration of candidacy, fraudulent voting, and perjury. On July 23, 2014, Alarcon was convicted of three counts of voter fraud and one count of perjury. After serving his full sentence through 51 days of house arrest, his conviction was overturned by an appeals court. Charges were again refiled. ==External links== * Official City Council website * ==References== # Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:People from Glendale, California Category:California Democrats Category:California state senators Category:Members of the California State Assembly Category:Los Angeles City Council members Category:California State University, Northridge alumni Category:20th-century American politicians Category:21st-century American politicians ","title":"Richard Alarcon"},{"id":"2579028","text":"Sergio García Ramírez (born February 1, 1938) is a Mexican jurist and politician who currently serves as a judge at the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.

Overlooking Darling Harbour, The Star, owned by Star Entertainment Group features two gaming floors, eight bars, seven restaurants, 351 hotel rooms and 130 serviced and privately owned apartments. It also includes the 2,000 seat Sydney Lyric theatre and Event Centre. Its gaming operations are overseen and controlled by the New South Wales Casino Control Authority and is licensed to be the only legal casino in New South Wales. In late 2007, it was granted a 12-year extension of its exclusivity and licence. In December 1994, a consortium of Leighton Properties and Showboat was announced by the NSW Casino Control Authority as the successful applicant for New South Wales' first casino licence. A temporary casino was opened by Acting Prime Minister Kim Beazley on 13 September 1995 on the site of former wharves 12/13. The permanent casino, designed by Sydney architect, Philip Cox, opened in November 1997, was one of the largest building projects ever carried out in Australia.Star City Casino Leighton Contractors The complex is now owned by The Star Entertainment Group. ==Gaming== The harbour side of The Star The harbour side of Star City Casino prior to expansion The Star, a light rail station on the Dulwich Hill Line, provides direct access The casino features two gaming floors — the main gaming floor on level one for general entry and the Sovereign Room on level three. The Sovereign Room table bet ranges from $25 to $75,000 and also contains the Inner Sanctum, with table bet ranges of $100 to $500,000. The two areas are only available to high rollers and international guests following an application for membership and review by The Star's management. The Inner Sanctum pits are frequently used for junket players. Star City returned to junket play in 2005 after taking a number of large losses in 2002. Recent rebuilding works have added extra gaming areas for the main gaming floor with the addition of the Oasis Lounge and the 36 Degrees Bar although these new areas have not increased the number of tables or machines available in total. The main gaming floor is divided into three major parts — Table Games, Electronic Gaming, and Poker. The number of poker tables has been steadily increased and now stands at 40 tables. The Sovereign Room has been upgraded and now includes four additional private gaming rooms and extra dining and lounge amenities. These extensions have an estimated cost of $7,000,000. Another recent upgrade is the addition of a new \\"ultra exclusive\\" area directly above the Sovereign Room called the Chairmans Lounge. This is accessed by invitation only, and there are currently fewer than 500 Diamond Card Members that are entitled to use the Chairmans Lounge. Star City has recently opened the sports bar as well. ===Table games=== The Star provides many traditional casino games, including Mini Baccarat, Blackjack, Caribbean Stud, Craps, Pai Gow, Poker, Pontoon, Roulette, Rapid (semi- electronic) Roulette, Sic Bo and Three card poker Two-Up was available at Star City but was removed at the end of October 2003 as the game was not considered to be economically viable. The pit typically required three dealers and two games supervisors, consequently management felt that returns were not as high as they could be and with Tabcorp insisting on large reductions in overheads and increased profit, this iconic game was closed. In December 2005, a new game Double-Chance was trialed but was discontinued soon after; Players, referring to the game's high house advantage, dubbed the game 'No-Chance'. At the end of 2006, Star City introduced a new game, three card baccarat, following minor reorganization of its main gaming floor in preparation for the smoking ban in July 2007 and planned extensions to its gaming floors. This game was also removed from the floor shortly after due to lack of interest from players. ===Electronic gaming=== The Star provides a selection of electronic gaming machines, including slot machines, bingo, rapid roulette and video poker machines. Rapid Big Wheel was introduced in early 2006 to replace the often slow-paced table game version, which has now been reintroduced, and the Rapid Big Wheel removed in August 2007. The Star has just over 1490 electronic gaming machines but is limited to a maximum 1500. ===Security=== As in most casinos, the gaming floors of the venue are constantly monitored by a security camera system. Cameras mounted on the roof and in the table signs are used to ensure that all actions are logged. The footage can be used to settle player disputes, identify cheating, and be used in the Australian court system for prosecution. In 2000 the $500 chips were removed from the casino after fraudulent chips were found. Some chips did make their way into the bank due to limited security features on the chips. ==Restaurants and bars== The Star has a large variety of restaurants including five star fine dining. Not all the restaurants are managed by The Star with a number of outlets being privately managed. The Star's Harvest Buffet is known for its all you can eat buffet with seafood buffet over the weekend. The Star operates eight bars within the complex with a further two outlets designated as bars and another two external independent outlets able to serve alcohol. Bars within the gaming area are not accessible to minors (persons under 18). Some bars have live entertainment, mostly on weekends. The Lagoon Bar and Glo Bar closed in 2009 as part of the refurbishment project ==Marquee== A new nightclub, called Marquee, opened on 31 March 2012. ==Redevelopment== In 2009, Tabcorp, the then-owners of Star City, announced an A$475 million refurbishment and expansion program called Project Star which involved the re-orientation of the casino towards Sydney Harbour, including a new \\"iconic\\" entrance as well as a drop-off zone on the harbour side of the casino site. Work began in late 2009 and was completed late 2012. Despite initial cost estimates, according to Echo Entertainment Group CEO, Larry Mullin the final cost was estimated to be around A$961 million. On 16 September 2011, the casino reopened under the name \\"The Star\\". Views of The Star from Sydney Tower before and after the redevelopment. ==Popular culture== The venue has featured awards nights including playing host to the annual film and television AACTA Awards. The first 12 episodes of the 2005-06 Australian television series Joker Poker was filmed in a private gaming room at the casino. The game was dealt by experienced The Star croupiers; however the show was not a success. Also filmed there were several episodes of Beauty and the Geek Australia. The now defunct Ralph magazine shot its swimsuit model of the year competition at Turbines Health Club (pool and gym for the hotel and apartments). ==References== ==External links== * *NSW Casino Control Authority Category:Boxing venues in Australia Category:Buildings and structures in Sydney Category:Casinos in Australia Category:Casinos completed in 1997 Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1997 Category:Hotels in Sydney Category:Tourist attractions in Sydney Category:1995 establishments in Australia Category:Casino hotels Category:Philip Cox buildings Category:Pyrmont, New South Wales Category:Star Entertainment Group ","title":"The Star, Sydney"},{"id":"2579055","text":"Timothy David Gardam (born 14 January 1956), is a British journalist, media executive and educator.

Turrella is located 10 km south of the Sydney central business district on the southern bank of Wolli Creek in the local government area of Bayside Council. Turrella is a mostly residential area. Some light industrial developments are located around Turrella railway station and north along the railway line. A footbridge from Turrella over Wolli Creek links Henderson Street to the eastern side of Earlwood, formerly known as Undercliffe. The footbridge was closed in 2012 by Canterbury Council after it was deemed to be structurally unsound but was repaired and re-opened in November 2013. ==History== In 1842 William Favell and his wife Eleanor were farming a property named Hillside on this site. Their neighbours were the families of Thomas Curtis and Henry Blackwell, who were orchardists and gardeners. The farms and orchards were subdivided when the railway came through. The railway station opened on 21 September 1931. The light industrial buildings were built close to the railway line and one of the biggest factories in the area was the Streets Ice Cream factory, which has since closed. The post office was originally known as West Arncliffe when it opened on 26 April 1933 but in January 1948 became known as Arncliffe West. It became Turrella in August 1952 but closed on 21 December 1970.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , Page 257 == Heritage listings == Turrella has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 18 Loftus Street: Cairnsfoot * Thompson Street: Wolli Creek Aqueduct ==Wolli Creek and Bardwell Valley== Turrella borders a piece of remnant bushland, the Wolli Creek Valley, beside Wolli Creek. There have been active movements fighting for its preservation in the face of demands for land. The most successful of these prevented the building of the M5 South Western Motorway through the valley, resulting in the road being built as a tunnel under the valley known as the M5 East. Nevertheless, community concern remains over plans to extend the M5 at Bexley. ==Schools== Arncliffe West Infants School is located in Loftus Street. The former Cairnsfoot Special School premises is located opposite. The original Cairnsfoot building is heritage listed. One well known headmistress of Arncliffe West Infants School was Miss Knight, who served there in the 1950s and 1960s. ==Transport== Turrella railway station is on the Airport & South Line of the Sydney Trains network. Turrella is also serviced by the 473 State Transit Authority route which runs from Rockdale, Bardwell Valley, Arncliffe, Turrella, Bardwell Park station, Earlwood, Clemton Park, and on to Campsie. The M5 South Western Motorway runs beneath parts of Turrella, in a 4 km tunnel. The nearest entrances to travel south-west towards Beverly Hills and Liverpool are located at Arncliffe and Bexley North. The nearest entrances to travel north-east towards Botany and the city are located at Arncliffe.

Previously the frontman of The Icicle Works, McNabb has since embarked on a solo career and performed with Ringo Starr, Neil Young/Crazy Horse, Mike Scott (of The Waterboys), and Danny Thompson of folk band Pentangle. McNabb's first book, an autobiography entitled Merseybeast, was published in October 2008. ==Early life== Robert Ian McNabb was born in Lourdes Hospital (now Spire Liverpool Hospital) in Mossley Hill, Liverpool, the first and only child of Patricia (née Forsyth) and Robert Gerard McNabb. At 18 months old he contracted pneumonia, leaving him with a damaged left lung. He had a brief stint as a child model, and a resultant photo was later featured on the album art of Potency: The Best of Ian McNabb. Following seeing 2001: A Space Odyssey as a child, McNabb has been an avid space-enthusiast. He has also been a supporter of Liverpool F.C. since childhood. McNabb cites his earliest musical influences as being from watching T. Rex's \\"Born to Boogie\\" and That'll Be the Day starring David Essex at the age of 10. After this he began attending guitar and music theory lessons. McNabb's first musical performance was playing \\"You're Sixteen\\" at Fairfield Conservative Club in Liverpool in 1974. In 1975, he auditioned and joined the young cabaret group Daybreak (Later renamed \\"Young World\\"). The group played at men's clubs around the North-West of England during the mid-1970s. The group unsuccessfully auditioned for television talent show Opportunity Knocks. Chris Sharrock later joined the group, where McNabb first became friends with him, he would go on to drum for The Icicle Works. McNabb wrote his first song at age 15, titled \\"Apologise (I Will)\\". McNabb quit Young World near the end of 1976 and joined an all-male teen cabaret group called City Lights. In 1977 the group auditioned for ITV's New Faces but were unsuccessful. McNabb began attending the Mabel Fletcher College of Music and Drama. He quit City Lights in February 1980, having agreed to start a band with Chris Sharrock. ==The Icicle Works== McNabb became the lead vocalist and songwriter for the band, which was founded in 1980. The band's other members were Chris Sharrock on Drums and Chris Layhe on bass guitar and backing vocals. During 1981, McNabb auditioned for the role of Barry Grant in Brookside but was unsuccessful. He also played extras in many television dramas at this time. The Icicle Works had success in the UK with the top 20 single \\"Love Is a Wonderful Colour\\" in 1983. They also hit the top 40 in the United States and Canada with the single \\"Whisper to a Scream (Birds Fly)\\" in 1984. The Icicle Works continued recording through the 1980s with limited success. In the UK, several of the band's follow-up singles charted, although none reached higher than No. 52\\\\. In the US, they briefly made the Modern Rock charts in 1988, but achieved no further mainstream recognition and were regarded in the US and Canada as a one-hit wonder. The original line-up of The Icicle Works broke up in 1988. McNabb put together a new \\"second generation\\" Icicle Works line-up in 1989, which released one album in 1990. However, the album was commercially unsuccessful and the band broke up the following year. In October 2006, after 15 years as a solo artist, McNabb unexpectedly revived the name The Icicle Works for a series of UK concerts. However, this new version of McNabb's old band did not feature any original Icicle Works members other than McNabb himself. In essence, McNabb seemed to be re-branding himself, using a somewhat more successful trade name in order to give his work increased exposure. Throughout 2007 and into early 2008, McNabb played dates as both a solo artist and with The Icicle Works. He then retired the name for a few years, before playing a handful of \\"30th Anniversary\\" shows as The Icicle Works in 2011. ==Solo career== ===1991–1997: This Way Up era=== McNabb at the Metro Club, London Around the time of the split of the Icicle Works in 1990, McNabb spent some time as a de facto member of The Wild Swans, playing guitar and singing background vocals. The Wild Swans dissolved in late 1990, and McNabb then issued two solo singles in 1991 to little notice. He then resurfaced in 1993 with a collection of demos which would form the basis of his first solo album, Truth and Beauty. Recorded on a shoestring budget in Oldham, Greater Manchester, it won him a record deal with Andrew Lauder's new 'This Way Up' Label. The album's first single \\"If Love Was Like Guitars\\" became a minor UK hit in 1993. Following this, the 1991 single \\"Great Dreams of Heaven\\" was re-released. The next single pulled from the album, \\"I'm Game\\", failed to chart. \\"(I Go) My Own Way\\" was re-recorded with The Stone Roses producer John Leckie, but it too failed to significantly impact on the UK chart. Label boss Andrew Lauder then suggested that McNabb go to record in America, which McNabb was sceptical about. He facetiously suggested to Lauder that his new material sounded like Neil Young and Crazy Horse, and if Lauder could get Crazy Horse to play on the record, he would go to America. A few phone calls later, McNabb found himself in a Los Angeles studio with Crazy Horse drummer Ralph Molina and bassist Billy Talbot. This rhythm section appeared on four of the ten tracks on Head Like a Rock, including the No. 54 UK hit \\"You Must Be Prepared to Dream\\". The album's other single, \\"Go into the Light\\", did not feature Crazy Horse and peaked at UK No. 66\\\\. Head Like a Rock was subsequently nominated for the 1994 Mercury Music Prize, and although M People would end up taking the award, Head Like A Rock peaked at No. 29 in the UK Albums Chart. Molina and Talbot toured with McNabb in 1994, featuring on the short live bonus CD which accompanied his next album, Merseybeast (1996). This performance also featured Noel Gallagher of Oasis on uncredited rhythm guitar as the group covered The Seeds' \\"Pushin' Too Hard\\". Merseybeast saw McNabb with a new backing band called The Afterlife. The album's first single, \\"Don't Put Your Spell on Me\\" reached UK No. 72\\\\. The second single, the album's title track \\"Merseybeast\\" fared even worse, hitting UK No. 74\\\\. In 1997, This Way Up parted company with McNabb, and released a 'best-of' collection entitled My Own Way: The Words & Music of Ian McNabb. ===1998–present: Fairfield Records era=== On returning to performing his own material, McNabb focused on acoustic music, leading to a residency at the Birmingham club of Ronnie Scott. The material arising out of this became the low-key album A Party Political Broadcast on Behalf of the Emotional Party, released by McNabb on his own Fairfield label in 1998. Aside from McNabb, the only other musicians on the album were Waterboys Mike Scott and Anthony Thistlethwaite, and bassist Danny Thompson. The album also produced one single, \\"Little Princess\\" which failed to chart. McNabb followed APPBOBOTEP with a live acoustic album, Live at Life (2000), compiled from a pair of Christmas gigs in 1999. The album included one newly written track, \\"Why Are the Beautiful So Sad\\", which continued to chronicle McNabb's dislike of celebrity culture as noted earlier in \\"Don't Patronise Me\\". Ian McNabb Performing at Canterbury Festival 2003 Photo: Gerry Gardner Ian McNabb (2001) marked McNabb's full-band return, and was issued by Sanctuary Records. The album's opening track, \\"Livin' Proof (Miracles Can Happen)\\", was written for the Go-Go's reunion which had recently taken place, but was declined by that band. McNabb's version was pressed as a promo single. The album was moderately received critically, with reviewers complaining of a lack of variety in the rock bombast of the record as compared to its two predecessors. 2001 also saw the issue of a demos and outtakes collection, Waifs and Strays, which included previously unreleased material and alternate versions of familiar McNabb chestnuts. McNabb returned to his own Fairfield label in 2002, and issued the low-key The Gentleman Adventurer. Best described as a semi-acoustic album, it is similar in spirit to his first solo album, Truth and Beauty, with occasional use of the drum machine to accompany more upbeat numbers such as \\"Ain't No Way to Behave\\". Almost entirely performed by McNabb (with help from his long-time collaborator and bassist in the latter-day Icicle Works Roy Corkill), the album takes in a variety of styles from rock, through ballads, a touch of funk, and acoustic storytelling. Another \\"bits and pieces\\" collection, Boots followed in 2003, the title being both McNabb's nickname (after his penchant for wearing Beatles-style boots in the mid-1980s while with The Icicle Works), and a reference to the 'official bootleg' nature of the release. The double disc set includes some very hard to find items, demos, and alternative versions. 2004 saw McNabb issuing a second 'Best Of' album, Potency: The Best of Ian McNabb. This covered his whole solo oeuvre, showcasing his eclectic musical taste and output. In 2005, McNabb successfully pushed a single, \\"Let The Young Girl Do What She Wants To\\" to No. 38 on the UK Singles Chart. This was McNabb's highest-ever chart placing as a solo artist, and his biggest hit since The Icicle Works' \\"Love Is a Wonderful Colour\\" reached No. 15 in early 1984, a span of over 21 years. This unexpected chart success was assisted considerably by his loyal fanbase buying several different formats of the single in an attempt to gain greater publicity and recognition for his then-current album, Before All of This. But despite support from a number of prominent DJs such as Jeremy Vine and Janice Long on BBC Radio 2, further widespread success continued to elude McNabb. Later in 2005, McNabb released People Don't Stop Believin, an album of b-sides and outtakes from Before All of This. In December 2007, McNabb's second live album, How We Live: At the Philharmonic, was issued. The album was culled from two June 2007 shows at Liverpool's Philharmonic Hall. In January and February 2008, McNabb was involved with \\"The Number Ones Project\\", a concert and compilation album celebrating Liverpool's fifty-six No. 1 singles on the UK charts. McNabb played at the January concert, and subsequently appeared on the album, released in February, with his studio cover of John Lennon's \\"Woman\\". In late 2008, McNabb participated in a concert reunion of City Lights]. At the end of the year, McNabb released his autobiography, entitled Merseybeast: A Musical Memoir. McNabb's eighth studio album, Great Things, was first made available at gigs in September 2009. As of November, it was made available for sale on McNabb's website. His ninth album, Little Episodes was available exclusively through his website beginning in February 2012. McNabb's tenth studio album, Eclectic Warrior, was created as a pledge music project, and was released on 18 March 2013. The Liverpudlian band Cold Shoulder played on the record, and toured with McNabb on the subsequent tour. In June 2014, McNabb joined radio station 'Radio Wirral' and was appointed to host a regular Friday night slot from 10 pm until 12 midnight. This slot, titled 'The Ian McNabb Show', started broadcasting on 20 June 2014 and continued for a few months. In August 2015, McNabb released the side album Krugerrands, his second release in collaboration with Cold Shoulder. He also revived The Icicle Works moniker and current lineup for a sporadic set of concerts throughout the rest of the year and on into 2016. In March 2016, McNabb released his first album of covers, titled Respectfully Yours. Star Smile Strong, his eleventh studio album, was released in April 2017. Part 1 of a trilogy. Our Future In Space, his twelfth studio album, was released in June 2018. Part 2 of a trilogy. Currently Ian is working on his next studio album (part 3 of a trilogy), which will be titled Utopian and will be a double album (with 20 tracks to celebrate that this will be his 20th studio album, starting with the five he recorded with The Icicle Works) released in 2021. Originally the plan was to release the album in 2020 and than tour the country, but the pandemic changed this much to the chagrin of Ian according to the posts on his blog. ==Solo discography== See Ian McNabb discography & List of songs recorded by Ian McNabb ===Albums=== * Truth and Beauty (1993) * Head Like a Rock (1994) * Merseybeast (1996) * A Party Political Broadcast on Behalf of the Emotional Party (1998) * Ian McNabb (2001) * The Gentleman Adventurer (2002) * Before All of This (2005) * Great Things (2009) * Little Episodes (2012) * Eclectic Warrior (2013) * Star Smile Strong (2017) * Our Future in Space (2018) ===Side albums=== * Waifs and Strays (2001) * Boots (2003) * People Don't Stop Believin (2005) * Krugerrands (2015) * Respectfully Yours (2016) ==Collaborations with other artists== Around the time the \\"second generation\\" Icicle Works were winding down, McNabb became a de facto member of The Wild Swans, playing guitar and singing back-up vocals on their second studio album, 1990's Space Flower. As well, he worked with Ian Broudie on Broudie's studio project The Lightning Seeds, providing backing vocals on the band's first three albums, released between 1990 and 1994. McNabb also co-wrote a total of two songs with Broudie that wound up on The Lightning Seeds' second and third albums, 1992's Sense and 1994's Jollification. 1998 saw McNabb as part of a touring band for Mike Scott and The Waterboys, playing bass and sometimes keyboards. He also had occasion to serve as a touring bassist for one of his heroes, Ringo Starr, whose son Zak Starkey had had an early music industry break in 1988 when McNabb hired him to be a member of a late-running version of The Icicle Works. McNabb has also contributed guitar on Amsterdam's album The Journey (2005) and Gary Cooke's debut album Songs for Everyday Use (2006). ==References== ==Other sources== *\\"The Crazy Dreamer\\", review of Head Like a Rock, from Vox, 1994. *Allmusic.com entry for Icicle Works *[ AllMusic.com] entry for Ian McNabb. *Information posted by Ian McNabb on Yahoo!Groups discussion list *Biography on official Ian McNabb website *Liner notes to McNabb albums, particularly Waifs and Strays, Boots *The Right to Imagination & Madness, by Martin Roach (London: Independent Music Press, 1994) . *Guinness Rockopedia, by David Roberts (London: Guinness World Records Ltd., 1998) . *The Great Rock Discography, by M.C.

It is part of the Forest District and Northern Beaches region.Gregory's Sydney Street Directory, Gregory's Publishing Company, 2007 Terrey Hills is a very leafy suburb and in some areas semi-rural, with many people boarding their horses in the area. Terrey Hills owes its name to the two original land holders Samuel Hills and Obediah James Terrey. Obediah Terrey acquired in 1881 and Samuel Hills owned nearby.Book of Sydney Suburbs, Francis Pollon, Angus and Robertson, 1990, page 254 The area was used by Indigenous people prior to European settlement, and rock carvings exist in some places. One set of carvings is located near Larool Road Gregory's Sydney Street Directory, Gregory's Publishing Company, 1983-1984 and depicts hunting scenes with kangaroos, human figures and footprints. Terrey Hills Post Office opened on 17 June 1935. ==History== For the older (geological) history, Terrey Hills is noted as the \\"laterite capital\\" of the Sydney Basin for those interested in how laterite forms (which has commonly been taken as indicator of climate change, and signalling former hotter and wetter conditions). The laterite of Terrey Hills was used for early road-making and also has been used for rock wall coastal defence at Collaroy Beach. It is the only place in New South Wales where fossils (meagre plant fibres) have been noted in laterite. The main laterite quarry (now the Terrey Hills playing field), and a smaller one at Tumbledown Dick, are on the National Estate (a Commonwealth heritage listing) and also have been nominated to the NSW Government local-significance heritage listing which in this area is administered by the Northern Beaches Council. A small struggle has been ongoing for years to better protect the laterite exposure at Tumbledown Dick from the announced effects of Mona Vale road widening plans. The laterite was worked during the Great Depression when Australia had one third of the workforce out of work. The Warringah Shire Quarry or 'gravel pit' at Terrey Hills was an important place for the distribution of government relief work funding. Gai Halstead in 1988 wrote a bicentennial compilation which was sponsored by Dick Smith's \\"Australian Geographical\\" organisation which was then headquartered at Terrey Hills - \\"The story of Terry Hills and Duffys Forest\\". In this it is noted that married men were given work at the rate of two weeks on and one off, whereas the single men worked at the 'gravel pit' at the rate of one week on and two off. Apart from this work there was little other work available at the time and Ms Halstead recorded the people at Terrey Hills were generally impoverished. For a week's work digging laterite gravel with pick and shovel there was received £1. To be paid that, they had to walk to the 'relief office' at Narrabeen. Besides digging the laterite, the relief workers based at Terrey Hills also built or improved the roads from Terrey Hills to Mona Vale, Cottage Point and Coal and Candle Creek. The area is generally poor in fossils and the only further thing of note is that a member of the local volunteer bush fire brigade found a fossil footprint in stone fallen from the bank of McCarr's Creek near the Duck Hole. ==Climate== Owing to its elevation and close proximity to the ocean, as well as its extensive tree canopy cover, the weather station at Terrey Hills records the mildest temperatures of any weather station in the Greater Sydney region. Under Köppen's scheme, the suburb has a borderline humid subtropical (Cfa) and oceanic climate (Cfb) with warm summers and cool winters. ==Commercial area== The shopping centre includes a Friendly Grocer supermarket, a Post Office, specialty shops and a number of restaurants and landscaping and plant suppliers. Northern Beaches Council has its Volunteer Services Centre located in Thompson Drive. Terrey Hills is home to the Rural Fire Service (RFS), State Emergency Service (SES), Marine Rescue NSW, Citizens Radio Emergency Services Team (CREST) & the Wireless Institute Civil Emergency Network (WICEN) under the auspices of the Radio Society (MWRS). In addition Terrey Hills has its own Rural Fire Station located in the car park adjacent to the Frank Beckman Reserve on Yulong Road. The volunteer brigade is the primary fire-fighting agency for the village and is equipped to fight both bush fires and structural / car fires with a Hino Category 11 village pumper & an Izuzu Category 1 4x4 bush fire tanker, fire engines and a Toyota Hilux support vehicle. Terrey Hills is also home to the Manly-Warringah Media Co-Operative and the Radio Northern Beaches radio stations after its relocation from Belrose in 2013. ==Transport== Terrey Hills is well served by buses and is also home to the Forest Coach Lines depot. Bus services operate to the CBD (L70 & 270), Chatswood (283 / 284), Gordon (196), Macquarie Park (197), North Sydney (260), Mona Vale (196 /197) and the special event service to Sydney Olympic Park. The buses to Chatswood and Gordon stop at the railway stations, enabling passengers to access train services. Mona Vale Road is the main road through Terrey Hills, connecting it to the rest of the Northern Beaches to the east, and suburbs such as Chatswood, Hornsby and North Ryde to the west. ==Education== Terrey Hills is home to six schools: * Northern Beaches Christian School * The Sydney Japanese School\\"School Location.\\" Sydney Japanese International School.

He was educated in Bruton, Somerset and the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. He was commissioned Second Lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 6 June 1838 and was promoted First Lieutenant in 2020, Second Captain in 1847, First Captain in 1854, Brevet Major in 1858, and Lieutenant-Colonel in 1862. He undertook his professional training at Chatham and was then posted to Canada in 1839. He returned to England in 1845 and spent a year in Portsmouth before being posted back to Canada in June 1846. He was in charge of surveying the western half of the boundary between Canada and New Brunswick, which had been ceded to Britain by the United States, until November 1848, when he returned to England with his new wife, Mary Murphy. He spent the next two years based at Gravesend. ==Comptroller-General of Convicts and Director of Prisons== When Western Australia became a penal colony in 1850, Henderson was appointed the colony's first Comptroller-General of Convicts. He travelled to Western Australia with the first convicts on board the Scindian, arriving on 1 June 1850. He found the colony completely unprepared for the convicts, lacking even a jail large enough to house them. Henderson secured lodging for the convicts at a ware house owned by Captain Scott, the harbour master. Henderson then began construction of a place for the warders to stay and in time the Convict Establishment, later known as Fremantle Prison.The Convict Era , Fremantle Prison, accessed 31 August 2013 He was \\"a kindly and just man, moderate and understanding, opposed to the harsher forms of discipline. He thought that flogging as a punishment did more harm than good, and might be abolished except in rare cases, and that putting men in chains was useless and aggravating.\\"1 Henderson married Mary Murphy in 1848. Following her death in 1855, he visited England with his son the following year and in 1857 married Maria Hindle. Henderson returned to Australia in 1858. He finally resigned as Comptroller-General of Convicts and left the colony in January 1863. On his return to Britain, he was appointed Chairman of Directors and Surveyor-General of Prisons and Inspector-General of Military Prisons on 29 July 1863, succeeding Sir Joshua Jebb. He sold his army commission in 1864 and was made a Companion of the Bath (CB) in 1868. ==Commissioner of Police== In 1869, Henderson was appointed to succeed Sir Richard Mayne as second sole Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. He was an ideal compromise candidate between those who wanted a military man as Commissioner and those who thought the job should go to a civilian. Although a former army officer, Henderson had served in civilian appointments for the last eighteen years. He was also unknown to the British public, allowing him to establish a reputation only on his achievements as Commissioner. Henderson immediately endeared himself to his men by abolishing or relaxing some of the petty regulations imposed by Mayne and his first colleague, Sir Charles Rowan. For the first time, for instance, officers were permitted to grow facial hair. They were also allowed to vote for the first time, having initially been prevented by regulations forbidding them to take part in political activity. Henderson clashed with Receiver Maurice Drummond over an increase in pay for his men, a rivalry which was to continue for the rest of his tenure. In order to spread his constables more widely and make them more available, Henderson established the fixed point system. He increased the Detective Branch to over 200 men and started the Habitual Criminals Register. He grouped the Divisions into Districts and introduced Schoolmaster Sergeants in each division to increase the literacy of his constables. However, Henderson faced problems. The authorities decided, against his advice, to reduce pensions and this, coupled with low wages, led to the first police strike in 1872. The Commissioner dealt with the situation efficiently, dismissing the ringleaders and then allowing most of them to rejoin the force. Although the reputation of the Met was harmed by this incident, Henderson himself was not criticised by the press. He faced an even more serious situation in 1877, when four senior officers of the Detective Branch were put on trial for corruption (Trial of the Detectives), but survived it with his reputation intact. In 1878, he was made a Knight Commander of the Bath (KCB). But, by this stage, Henderson was starting to lose his control of the force. He ignored the fact that the District Superintendents were becoming ineffective and that two of the four posts had fallen vacant. When the Fenian bombing campaign opened in 1883, he left its handling largely to his assistants, particularly Howard Vincent, James Monro and Robert Anderson. On 8 February 1886, the mishandling of the Trafalgar Square Riot exposed his inefficiency, and he immediately resigned. ==Notes== # Hasluck (1959), page 56. ==References== * *.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 5, 2002. In the episode, Homer and his wife Marge discover that convenience store owner Apu is having an affair with the Squishee delivery lady working in his store. \\"The Sweetest Apu\\" was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Matthew Nastuk. It features Inside the Actors Studio host James Lipton as himself. It also features references to The New Yorker, photographer Richard Avedon and the film Wild Wild West. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 7.1 million viewers and finished in 37th place in the ratings the week it aired. Following its home video release on August 24, 2010, the episode received mixed reviews from critics. ==Plot== Apu sells Homer a beer keg for the American Civil War reenactment of the Battle of Springfield. At the reenactment, Principal Skinner watches as Springfielders disobey him and hold a rather inaccurate battle (featuring an orange plaid clad \\"East\\" faction, a roller skating Stonewall Jackson, and a giant robotic spider made by Professor Frink). After the battle, Homer brings the empty, dented keg back to Apu at the Kwik-E-Mart in an attempt to get the deposit. There, he hears a giggle coming from a closet and finds Apu making love with the woman who delivers Squishees to Kwik-E-Mart, Annette. He then walks backwards in shock all the way home to his bed and then relives the encounter in his dreams when he falls asleep. Marge figures out what Homer saw from the movements of his pupil. They decide not to tell Manjula but while they are playing badminton, Homer and Marge act awkwardly with Manjula and Apu looking at them, trying not to give out hints Apu cheated on Manjula. They then confront Apu and he says he will break up with Annette. However, he breaks his promise (as it gets his mind off the octuplets and she forces him). Later, Manjula watches the surveillance footage of Apu cheating and kicks him out. To help get them together, Homer and Marge invite them both to dinner, but do not tell them that the other one is coming. After a failed attempt with Bart and Lisa, Apu tries to promise to Manjula that he will change, but Manjula refuses to listen and demands a divorce. Homeless, Apu moves into the apartment complex where Kirk Van Houten lives. The octuplets then speak their first words, which put together, say \\"Mommy, will you let daddy come back...cookie!\\" Marge and Manjula go to Apu's and arrive in time to prevent him from committing suicide by hanging. Apu is then subjected to several tasks to redeem himself, including breaking up with Annette, though Manjula says it will take time for everything to get back to normal. In bed, Manjula, finally satisfied with what he has done, kisses Apu while Homer watches from the window, on a ladder. The couple continues and Homer, traumatized, hops backwards on the ladder all the way home, without falling, mimicking what he did earlier. ==Production and cultural references== Talk show host James Lipton guest starred as himself in the episode. \\"The Sweetest Apu\\" was written by former Simpsons writer John Swartzwelder and directed by director Matthew Nastuk. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 5, 2002. After seeing Apu cheating on Manjula with the squishee girl, an extensive scene in which Homer dramatically backs out of the room, into the Simpson house and into his bed is shown. The scene was conceived by episode writer Swartzwelder. Another scene in the episode shows Apu breaking up with the Squishee lady in front of her house. Originally, police chief Clancy Wiggum would be seen in a robe inside the house, implying that other men in Springfield cheat on their wives as well, however it was dismissed because the writers thought it would look \\"too sad\\".Selman, Matt. (2010). Commentary for \\"The Sweetest Apu\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Originally, Swartzwelder wanted the kama sutra sex position in the episode to show several arms and legs \\"sticking out in crazy positions\\", however it received a censor note and the Simpsons staff were allowed to show \\"less and less\\" of it as time progressed. The episode features American writer and actor James Lipton, host of the television program Inside the Actors Studio, as himself. The divorce lawyer was portrayed by series regular voice actor Hank Azaria,Castellaneta, Dan. (2010).

The episode finished in 37th place in the ratings for the week of April 29-May 5, 2002.

Al Jean, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Matt Selman, Tim Long, Dan Castellaneta, James Lipton and Matt Warburton participated in the audio commentary of the episode. Following its home video release, \\"The Sweetest Apu\\" received mixed reviews from critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote \\"I don’t recall ever being particularly excited by other Manjula episodes, and 'Sweetest' does nothing to alter that perception.\\" He praised Homer's reaction to seeing Apu cheating on Manjula, but maintained that \\"much of the remaining gags tend to be lackluster.\\" He concluded by writing \\"This ends up as a pretty flat, forgettable show.\\" Project-Blu's Nate Boss called it \\"An average episode, by this season's standards,\\" describing it as \\"a bit too cut and dried for my taste.\\" Writing for Blu-ray.com, Casey Broadwater wrote that \\"The Sweetest Apu\\" is \\"near-laughless\\", and Ryan Keefer of DVD Talk wrote \\"The less said about this episode, the better.\\" Ryan Keefer of DVD Talk wrote, \\"Does Jean manage to get The Simpsons to reclaim some of the tarnish off the crown? Sure, but it's not without its duds; 'The Sweetest Apu' and 'The Old Man and The Key' were borderline painful'. On the other hand, giving the episode a positive review, Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B, praising the \\"Badminton [scene] and its many double entendres\\" as the episode's \\"highlight\\". ==References== ==External links== *\\"The Sweetest Apu\\" at The Simpsons.com * * * Category:The Simpsons (season 13) episodes Category:2002 American television episodes Category:Television shows written by John Swartzwelder Category:Television episodes about adultery ","title":"The Sweetest Apu"},{"id":"2579168","text":"Scolopendra gigantea, also known as the Peruvian giant yellow-leg centipede or Amazonian giant centipede, is one of the largest centipedes of the genus Scolopendra with a length up to . This species is found in various places in South America and the Caribbean, where it preys on a wide variety of animals, including other sizable arthropods, amphibians, mammals and reptiles. == Distribution and habitat == It is naturally found in northern South America. Countries from which verified museum specimens have been collected include Aruba, Brazil, Curaçao, Colombia, Venezuela (including Margarita Island) and Trinidad. Records from Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Honduras are assumed to be accidental introductions or labeling errors. Scolopendra gigantea can be found in tropical or sub-tropical rainforest and tropical dry forest. == Behavior and diet == It is a carnivore that feeds on any other animal it can overpower and kill. It is capable of overpowering not only other invertebrates such as large insects, spiders, millipedes, scorpions, and even tarantulas, but also small vertebrates including small lizards, frogs (up to 95 mm long), snakes (up to 25 cm long), sparrow-sized birds, mice, and bats. Large individuals of S. gigantea have been known to employ unique strategies to catch bats in which they climb cave ceilings and hold or manipulate their heavier prey with only a few legs attached to the ceiling. == Venom == At least one human death has been attributed to the venom. In 2014, a four-year-old child in Venezuela died after being bitten by a giant centipede which was hidden inside an open soda can.

Holt had built Sutherland House on the foreshore of Gwawley Bay in 1818, on the eastern side of Sylvania, which took its name from the original wooded vegetation. He established the Sutherland Estate Company in 1881 and a village grew there, with a post office opening in 1883. The school opened in 1884 but closed in 1891 and was not reopened until 1925. Sylvania Heights Public School opened in 1955. Sylvania Waters Estate was developed by LJ Hooker in the 1960s, with much of the land reclaimed from the bay, effectively destroying the mangrove ecosystem to provide water frontages with boating facilities. James Goyen won the tender to design the estate, construct the houses, and promote the new suburb. Streets of the development were named after Australian rivers – such as Shoalhaven, Tweed, Murrumbidgee, Hawkesbury and Barwon – to emphasize the association with water.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 251 ==Commercial area== Sylvania Waters is mostly residential, with three small shopping strips located on Belgrave Esplanade: Sylvania Shopping Village near Box Road, Sylvania Shopping Centre near Murrumbidgee Avenue, and the Richmond Centre near Richmond Avenue.

The suburb became infamous when the series screened across Australia and then internationally. One of the artificial islands in Sylvania Waters (James Cook Island) was used in the filming of the movie Superman Returns (2006) as the location of Lois Lane's house. ==Population== In the , Sylvania Waters had a population of 3,125 people. The median age of residents was 41 years, slightly older than the national median of 37. Children aged under 15 years made up 18.3% of the population, and people aged 65 years and over made up 16.9% of the population. Almost one-third (32.3%) were born overseas, similar to the national average of 30.2%.

A meeting chaired by Agnes O'Farrelly on 2 April 1914 marked the foundation of Cumann na mBan.Chronology (Ireland, 1912–1998) in Joost Augusteijn (ed.), The Irish Revolution, 1913–1923 (Houndmills, England: Pelgrave, 2002), p. 233. Branches, which pledged to the Constitution of the organisation, were formed throughout the country and were directed by the Provisional Committee.Cumann na mBan manifesto (1914), in Bourke (ed.), FDA, Vol V, p. 104. The first branch was named the Ard Chraobh, which held their meetings in Brunswick Street before and after the 1916 Easter Rising.Conlon, pp. 8–10 ==Aims== The constitution of Cumann na mBan contained explicit references to the use of force by arms if necessary. At the time the Government of Ireland Bill 1914 was being debated and might have had to be enforced in Ulster. The primary aims of the organisation as stated in its constitution were to \\"advance the cause of Irish liberty and to organize Irishwomen in the furtherance of this object\\", to \\"assist in arming and equipping a body of Irish men for the defence of Ireland\\" and to \\"form a fund for these purposes, to be called 'The Defence of Ireland Fund'\\". ==Membership== In addition to their local subscriptions (i.e. involvement in other nationalist associations or organisations), members of Cumann na mBan were expected to support the Defence of Ireland Fund, through subscription or otherwise.Cumann na mBan (1914), in Bourke (ed.), FDA, Vil V, p.104. Its recruits were from diverse backgrounds, mainly white-collar workers and professional women, but with a significant proportion also from the working class. In September 1914, the Irish Volunteers split over John Redmond's appeal for its members to enlist in the British Army. The majority of Cumann na mBan members supported the rump of between 10,000 and 14,000 volunteers who rejected this call and who retained the original name, the Irish Volunteers.Conlon, p. 13Cambell, Fergus: Land and Revolution: Nationalist Politics in the West of Ireland, 1891–1921, p. 196 A few Cumann na mBan branches affiliated directly to Redmond's National Volunteers; other ex- members joined short-lived Redmondite associations, like the Volunteer Aid Association, or the \\"Women's National Council\\" formed by Bridget Dudley Edwards in 1915.McCarthy 2007 pp.36–41 ==Role in the 1916 Easter Rising== On 23 April 1916, when the Military Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood finalised arrangements for the Easter Rising, it integrated Cumann na mBan, along with the Irish Volunteers and Irish Citizen Army, into the 'Army of the Irish Republic'. Patrick Pearse was appointed Commandant-General and James Connolly Commandant-General of the Dublin Division. On the day of the Rising, Cumann na mBan members, including Winifred Carney, who arrived armed with both a Webley revolver and a typewriter, entered the General Post Office on O'Connell Street in Dublin with their male counterparts. By nightfall, women insurgents were established in all the major rebel strongholds throughout the city except Boland's Mill and the South Dublin Union held by Éamon de Valera and Eamonn Ceannt. The majority of the women worked as Red Cross workers, couriers or procured rations for the men. Members also gathered intelligence on scouting expeditions, carried despatches and transferred arms from dumps across the city to insurgent strongholds.McCallum, Christi (2005) And They'll March with Their Brothers to Freedom - Cumann na mBan, Nationalism, and Women's Rights in Ireland, 1900–1923 Some members of Cumann na mBan were also members of the Citizen Army and as such were combatants in the Rising. Constance Markievicz is said to have shot and killed a policeman at St Stephen's Green during the opening phase of the hostilities. She carried out sniper attacks on British troops and with Mary Hyland and Lily Kempson, was among a small force under Frank Robbins which occupied the College of Surgeons opposite the Green and failed to rifles that were believed to be held there by the college's Officer Training Corps.Frank Robbins, Under the Starry Plough (Dublin 1977), pp.94-6 Helena Molony was among the Citizen Army company which attacked Dublin Castle and subsequently occupied the adjacent City Hall, where she and other women sniped.McCallum, Christi (2005), p. 62 At the Four Courts the women of Cumann na mBan helped to organise the evacuation of buildings at the time of surrender and to destroy incriminating papers. More typical was the General Post Office (GPO), where Pearse insisted that most of them (excluding Carney, who refused to leave the injured James Connolly) leave at noon on Friday, 28 April. The building was then coming under shell- and machine-gun fire and many casualties were anticipated. The following day the leaders at the GPO decided to negotiate surrender. Pearse asked Cumann na mBan member Elizabeth O'Farrell (a mid-wife at the National Maternity Hospital) to act as a go-between. Under British military supervision she brought Pearse's surrender order to the rebel units still fighting in Dublin. Over 70 women, including many of the leading figures in Cumann na mBan, were arrested after the insurrection and many of the women who had been captured fighting were imprisoned in Kilmainham; all but twelve had been released by 8 May 1916. ==After the Rising== Cumann na mBan protest outside Mountjoy Prison, 23 July 1921 Revitalized after the Rising and led by Countess Markievicz, Cumann na mBan took a leading role in popularising the memory of the 1916 leaders, organising prisoner relief agencies and later in opposing conscription, and canvassing for Sinn Féin in the 1918 general election, in which Countess Markievicz was elected Teachta Dála. Jailed at the time, she became the Minister for Labour of the Irish Republic from 1919 to 1922.Conlon, pp. 33–40 During the Anglo-Irish War, its members were active. They hid arms and provided safe houses for volunteers, helped run the Dáil Courts and local authorities, and in the production of the Irish Bulletin, official newspaper of the Irish Republic. In the Irish elections of May 1921, Markievicz was joined by fellow Cumann na mBan members Mary MacSwiney, Dr. Ada English and Kathleen Clarke as Teachtaí Dála. ==The Treaty== On 7 January 1922 the Anglo- Irish Treaty was approved by the Second Dáil by a close vote of 64–57. On 5 February a convention was held to discuss this, and 419 Cumann na mBan members voted against as opposed to 63 in favour. In the ensuing Civil War, its members largely supported the anti-Treaty Republican forces. Over 400 of its members were imprisoned by the forces of the Provisional government which became in December 1922 the Irish Free State. Some of those who supported the Treaty changed the name of their branches to Cumann na Saoirse, while others retained their name but gave allegiance to the Free State Government.Conlon, pp. 268–270 ==After the Treaty== Cumann na mBan continued to exist after the Treaty, forming (alongside Sinn Féin, the Irish Republican Army, Fianna Éireann and other groups) part of the Irish republican milieu. The government of the Irish Free State banned the organisation in January 1923 and opened up Kilmainham Jail as a detention prison for suspect women. Its membership strength was adversely affected by the many splits in Irish republicanism, with sections of the membership resigning to join Fianna Fáil, Clann na Poblachta and other parties. Máire Comerford, a lifelong member from 1914, reflected in later years that it became a 'greatly weakened organisation' that 'gathered speed downhill' from the founding of Fianna Fáil in 1926. ==Present day== Republican Sinn Féin linked Cumann na mBan at Bodenstown in 2004. Cumann na mBan supported the Provisional wing in the 1969/70 split in the IRA and Sinn Féin. Sinn Féin vice-president and leading Cumann na mBan member Máire Drumm was killed by loyalists in 1976. In Northern Ireland Cumann na mBan was integrated into the mainstream Irish Republican Army during the conflict, although the organisation continued to exist. In 1986, Cumann na mBan opposed the decision by the IRA and Sinn Féin to drop the policy of abstentionism and aligned itself with Republican Sinn Féin and the Continuity IRA. In 1996, RSF general secretary and Cumann na mBan member Josephine Hayden was jailed for six years on charges relating to the possession of a sawn-off shotgun and a revolver. In 2014 Cumann na mBan celebrated the Centenary of their foundation in Wynn's Hotel, Dublin, where they were founded in 1914. Cumann na mBan is a proscribed organisation in the United Kingdom under the Terrorism Act 2000, but it is not listed as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the United States.

It is well known for its large waterfront properties and restaurants. Sylvania is mostly residential but also contains areas of native bushland and some commercial developments on the Princes Highway and Port Hacking Road. Sylvania Heights is a locality in the western part of the suburb. Sylvania Waters and Kangaroo Point share the same postcode (2224). ==History== The traditional owners of Sylvania are the Dharawal Aboriginal people and their archaeological heritage is evident in a number of registered middens, burial and art sites in rock shelters on the Georges River. After European settlement, this land was acquired by John Connell Laycock as a Crown grant. Thomas Holt (after whom Holt Road is named), a prominent landowner, financier and politician, acquired it a few years later as part of the Holt-Sutherland Estate, some . The name of the suburb relates to its original wooded vegetation (‘sylvan’ which means wooded or inhabiting the woods). The native vegetation of the suburb is now fast disappearing, as a result of increased development. Thomas Holt built Sutherland House on the foreshore of Gwawley Bay in 1818, on the eastern side of Sylvania. He established the Sutherland Estate Company in 1881 and a village grew here, with a post office opening in 1883. The school opened in 1884 but closed in 1891 and was not reopened until 1925.

They include the original St Mark's timber church (now a Sylvania Public School class room) timber residence in Evelyn Street associated with the Holt Estate; 'Glenn Robin', built by William Glenn Wade on land he acquired in 1949 and completed in 1954; and 'Green Gables' built by Sidney and Clarisse Bayer between 1946 and 1952 on Kangaroo Point.*http://www.doryanthes.info/pdf/GreenGables.pdf In 1913 the 3 hectare area bounded by Florida Street, Harrow Street, Mowbray Street and Illawarra Road (now the Princes Highway) was known as the Swastika Estate. Much of the land of Sylvania Waters was 'reclaimed' from Gwawley Bay, effectively destroying the highly integrated mangrove flora of the bay. Sylvania Waters Estate was developed by L.J.Hooker in the 1960s; land offered had water frontages with boating facilities. Streets were named after Australian rivers to emphasise the association with water, such as Shoalhaven, Tweed, Murrumbidgee, Hawkesbury and Barwon. The suburb has been identified as an area that is particularly vulnerable to inundation, should predictions of climate change, global warming and rising sea levels prove correct.

Philip Cowley is a British political scientist and an academic at Queen Mary University of London in the School of Politics and International Relations. He previously held the same title at the University of Nottingham. Within academia he is particularly notable for his analysis of Parliamentary voting behaviour in the UK House of Commons and House of Lords and secondly his opposition to a lowering of the UK voting age below 18. ==Parliamentary Revolts== Cowley is involved in the continuous production of highly detailed and closely analysed briefing papers and reports of divisions in the UK Parliament, with eye-witness accounts of whipping practices in action, counts and comparisons of rebellious voting by Parliamentarians and discussion of how such activity impacts on its political context. He co-ordinates this work through the maintenance of a website produced in a blog format. He is assisted by his colleagues Mark Stuart, also of the University of Nottingham, and Lord Norton of the University of Hull. They are funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and through previous research by their respective universities and the Leverhulme Trust. The project is not affiliated to any political party, nor does it receive funding from any other source. ==\\"Votes for Adults\\"== He has produced a website entitled \\"Votes for Adults\\" in which he claims to dismiss comprehensively the arguments put forward in support of a reduction of the voting age to 16. This is in opposition to the Votes at 16 campaign, supported by a broad coalition of youth charities and other organisations. ==See also== *Nuffield Election Studies ==References== ==Bibliography== *Developments in British Politics 8, Macmillan, 2006 (ed.

The Sumerians are regarded as the first everyday users (in agricultural applications) of pictographs (of which scholars have catalogued some 15,000 individual symbols). ===Contextual handwriting/cuneiform=== Contextual handwriting is said to have begun with the development of Cuneiform (from the Latin Cuneus and referring to the styluses used in creating the pictographs of the aforesaid). Cuneiform would be applied in the recording of the Akkadian language and several other languages of Mesopotamia as the usage of Sumerian began to fade as a spoken language. ===Convergence in Mesopotamia and Egypt=== As both Mesopotamians and Egyptians began to regard writing as an indicator of one's privilege/rank in societal hierarchy, instructors of the times were given rein to develop drilling (reading/identification, and so on) and memorisation techniques still in operation in modern language instruction. This may have also been assisted by the eventual availability of papyrus as well as the evolution of the hieroglyphs into the more comprehensible forms of Hieratic (from the Greek 'hieros' meaning 'sacred' and coined by Herodotus (c. 484-424 BCE)) and Demotic. These would diminish one another in their own swiftness and would be key elements in the deciphering of the Rosetta Stone by Jean-François Champollion. ===Initial alphabets=== While it is thought that the Phoenician alphabet is the first veritable alphabet, it contained only consonants (an abjad). Upon reaching the shores of Greece via sailing merchants, it is proposed that the Greek alphabet was developed by a combination of the Phoenician form and the Egyptian Demotic. Although it would fall out of common usage in or around 1100 BCE (except for, or almost exclusively in the university/scholarly realm, as well as in its mother country), its presence would be felt in more modern languages such as Latin and later English. ===Aramaic and the worth of Biblical texts=== As a great number of Biblical texts were transcribed in Aramaic (arising in Aram (modern day Syria) in or near 800 BCE), along with the rising popularity of the Gospels, teachings of both the language and theological aspects therein became more prevalent in society. This would be furthered by the eventual translations of the Aramaic into Hebrew and/or Yiddish which began to flourish in the Arabic peninsula and the surrounding areas along with the established language found in Qur'anic texts. And although there are spotty connections with their Phoenician systems, it is clear that the transcription of the 'scriptures' mentioned into dialects still spoken, to some degree, today allowed for written as well as verbal language to reach a larger portion of the masses. ===Chinese language/East-Asian calligraphy/handwriting=== The intricate system of characters defined by their radicals (214 in the Chinese system, with an alternative 79 radical system in the later developed Japanese interpretation known as Kanji (漢字)) is believed to have come to use around 2000 BCE. It was furthermore codified about 1500 BCE and finally systemised between 200 BCE-400 CE. It is considered one of the most consistently unchanged systems of writing and is held in high regard in its influence of nearby languages. Its forms, when written, may range from bloc (the most visible form generally not using brushes) to semi- and fully cursive styles which require a certain degree of skill and devotion (through constant practice and memorisation) and remain in wide use. ===English/European development of script=== In the words of Philip Hofer (1941, p. 2), in the latter portion of the 7th century 'English calligraphy became important and influential on the course of writing styles for the first time' (often credited in part to Alcuin of York). Eventually a form of English handwriting would form to follow the function of the daily business affairs of merchants, clerks and professional scribes for a more masterful and consistent means of correspondence. During the same period (around the 17th-18th centuries), as English trade came more to the forefront of mainland Europe and the New World, a significant amount of copy books came about which made use of the finery of English script of the time. In some time a more common system of joined/cursive handwriting would be developed for usage in the same vein along with its promotion in the education system. ===Some key figures of chirography=== *Herodotus *Qin Shi Huang(秦始皇)(260-210 BCE) *Alcuin (735-804 CE) *Johann Gutenberg (1398-1468 CE) *Ludovico Arrighi (1475-1527 CE) *Samuel Pepys (1633-1703 CE) *Jean-François Champollion (1790-1832 CE) ==Modern chirography== Although, to a certain degree, modern widespread and efficient means of printing coupled with computer technology have pushed stylistic and complex handwriting techniques to the backdrop of linguistic aspects, the aforementioned practices remain in use often in the fields of academia for study. Calligraphy remains a commonplace facet of many modern East Asian languages as well as forms of cursive Arabic. However dated they may seem, they are necessary in order to grasp archaic or other older forms of current languages in the field of linguistics, as there are still mysteries to resolve (such as the near indecipherable Indus Script). ==See also== * Asemic writing * Calligraphy * Graphology * Penmanship ==Sources== *Bickham, George and Philip Hofer (1941).

His working life began as a farmer in Rochester, New York, then moved on to being a machinist's apprentice in Almonte, Ontario, Canada. In 1873 journeyman Neilson worked in Brockville, Ontario, moving on in 1889 to a retail store. Afterward he sold his store in 1890 and moved to Toronto, Ontario and began a grocery store that eventually failed. Leaving his family behind, he moved to North Dakota to work as a farmer with his brother Jessie. ==Founding of William Neilson Limited== Returning to Toronto, still in debt, he purchased some cows and began the sale of milk. Neilson then obtained ice-cream manufacturing equipment. In 1893 the firm, William Neilson Limited, was started. Ice-cream and mincemeat were the first products, and these fueled the growth of the company. Expansion and modernization started in 1904 with a new location and the addition of new equipment. By 1905 production was at two thousand gallons of ice-cream per day, and mincemeat production was discontinued. Chocolate was added to the product mix in 1908. This required further expansion and a new building was added, and by 1915 a new site was required and the production moved to Beachville, Ontario. By 1928, the company employed a thousand people in all departments and production was at one thousand gallons of ice-cream per hour, and the company opened branches in South America, South Africa, Japan, China, Australia and New Zealand. William Neilson Limited, now headquartered in Georgetown, Ontario, was held by George Weston Limited from 1947 to 2008 and is now held by Saputo Incorporated. ==Marriage and family== Neilson married Mary Eva Kaiser on October 6, 1875 in Brockville, Ontario. They were the parents of five children, of which the sons continued the business after the death of their father in 1915. Fred Harry Morden Neilson, the family's official churner, ran the business as president until his death in 1947. Charles Edward Neilson was secretary-treasurer and James William Allen Neilson was a vice-president. The Neilson family are buried at Forest Lawn Mausoleum in north Toronto. ==References== Middletown, Jesse Edgar, The Municipality of Toronto - A History, Dominion Publishing, 1923 == External links == *Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online * Neilson Dairy at www.neilsondairy.com Category:1844 births Category:1915 deaths Category:Canadian businesspeople Category:People from Lanark County Category:Canadian people of Scottish descent ","title":"William Neilson (businessman)"},{"id":"2579201","text":"Koppers Building is a historical building in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, commissioned by Andrew W.

Sydenham is located 8 kilometres south of Sydney central business district and is part of the local government area of Inner West Council. Sydenham is surrounded by the suburbs of Marrickville, St Peters and Tempe. ==History== Sydenham developed after the Illawarra railway line came through the area to Hurstville in the late 1800s. It was named after Sydenham, a suburb of London, similar for its close proximity to the city and a railway junction. The station was originally known as Marrickville when it opened on 15 October 1884. It was changed to Sydenham on 19 March 1895 when a new line was being built to Bankstown and the first station was to be called Marrickville. The post office opened in April 1899 as Tempe Park and was only renamed Sydenham in 1964.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 251 Marrickville Council proposed the Sydenham Creative Hub—a commercial area of bars, cafes and galleries—near Sydenham Station sometime after 2011. On 12 December 2017, the Inner West Council voted to shrink the proposed precinct to an area immediately adjacent to the Station only. Sydenham has a number of heritage-listed sites, including Sydenham railway station. ==Population== In the 2016 Census, there were 1,145 people in Sydenham. 51.9% of people were born in Australia and 51.0% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion, 35.6%, Catholic 20.1%, Buddhism 11.9%, Not stated 9.3% and Eastern Orthodox 6.7%. ==Transport== Sydenham railway station is a junction for three lines on the Sydney Trains network: the Illawarra, Airport & South and Bankstown lines. ===Former tram/light rail service=== A cross country line connected the Cooks River Line and the Dulwich Hill line via Sydenham, operating along Railway Road and Sydenham Road in Sydenham. ==Features== Sydenham is a small suburb extending southeast from the railway station to the Princes Highway. It has a mixture of residential and industrial developments. A small group of shops is located around the intersection of Unwins Bridge Road and Railway Road, close to Sydenham railway station. Commercial developments are also located along Sydenham and Marrickville Roads heading towards Marrickville. Marrickville Metro Shopping Centre is also very close to Sydenham. ===Sydenham Green=== This suburb is directly under the flight path of Sydney Airport. To deal with noise complaints from residential properties between Unwins Bridge Road and the Princes Highway, the government compulsory acquired these properties and converted them into a recreational park.https://sydneysinnerwest.kidsizeliving.com.au/content/sydenham-green- sydenham The park now occupies a large portion of the small suburb. Sydenham Green is located on either side of Railway Road, named after the park of the same name in Sydenham, London. Two heritage buildings along Railway Road were retained, a sandstone terrace house and St Marys Church which was later controversially demolished after a suspicious fire.) In the park, a series of oversized 'living room' sculptures - lamp, chairs and fireplace pays homage to the residential houses that formerly occupied the site. ==References== ==External links== * [CC-By-SA] Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:Inner West Council ","title":"Sydenham, New South Wales"},{"id":"2579207","text":"A portrait of Abe Schwartz from the cover of Die shaine yugend score (1922) Abe Schwartz (Yiddish: אבּ שװארץ or אייב שווארץ) (Born near Bucharest, Romania in 1881, died 1963 in Bronx, New York City) was a well-known klezmer violinist, composer, Yiddish theater and ethnic recordings bandleader from the 1910s to the 1940s. In his various orchestras, he recorded many of the leading klezmer musicians of the early twentieth century, including Naftule Brandwein and Dave Tarras. ==Biography== Schwartz was born outside of Bucharest, Romania on April 15, 1881. It is unclear what musical education he received there, but according to klezmer researcher Henry Sapoznik, his father was a tinsmith who tried to discourage Abe from becoming a musician. Schwartz emigrated to the United States with his parents in 1900 or possibly 1902. In the US he eventually married and had a son Louis, as well as four daughters: Mary, Ida, Bebe, and Sylvia, who recorded a few times accompanying her father on the piano. In the 1900s and 1910s he worked as a dance band leader in the New York City area. He was among a cohort of Romanian-born klezmer bandleaders that included Max Leibowitz, Abe Katzman, and Milu Lemisch. At some point he met David Nodiff, Artists and repertoire (A&R;) man for Columbia Records. In 1917 Nodiff hired Schwartz to organize instrumental performances of ethnic music for the label as well as to seek out new Jewish talent for future recordings. Among these discoveries were Naftule Brandwein, the \\"king of klezmer clarinet\\", who could be heard playing clarinet on some of Schwartz's recordings around 1920, before he formed his own orchestra at the competing Victor Records. As Jeffrey Wollock put it, \\"an independent contractor for Columbia's East European (and possibly other ethnic) records, [...] it was Schwartz's job to put bands together.\\" Wollock continues: \\"Schwartz was a \\"house conductor\\" in the foreign department, and his bands consisted of whomever he hired for the session. Since he often did without written arrangements, relying on his players to \\"know what to do,\\" the playing on most of his band recordings is vernacular, spontaneous, and somewhat ramshackle.\\" By 1919 Schwartz published his first song \\"Dos Zekele mit Koilen\\" and recorded it with Yiddish language singer Abraham Moskowitz, marking Schwartz's entry into the world of Yiddish theater music. In that year he also recorded a number of non-Jewish recordings under pseudonyms such as Orkiestra Wiejska and Russky Narodny Orkestr. In 1920, in preparation to record another round of klezmer tunes, he copyrighted roughly 35 pieces, which are viewable through the Library of Congress today. His most famous tune, which is still performed today, was Di Grine Kuzine (the Green cousin). The song was so successful that it spawned a number of imitator in the world of published scores, such as Hyman Prizant's Mayn Kuzine and Jacob Leiserowitz's Di Grine Kuizine. It was also recorded by several artists, including Abraham Moskowitz, Joseph Feldman and Morris Goldstein. The success of the song compelled Schwartz to write and publish a number of other Yiddish theater songs. In 1923, when Naftule Brandwein left his orchestra to start his own at a competing label, clarinet player Schloimke (Sam) Beckerman replaced him Schwartz's orchestra. In 1927, he helped put together another ensemble, the Boiberiker Kapelye, which performed on the radio and on records for five years, and which included such soloists as Dave Tarras, Alex Fiedel, and Berish Katz. Schwartz continued to record and compose through the 1930s, slowing down somewhat by the 1940s. His 1941 recording Ikh bin a Boarder bay mayn vayb was a notable success of his later career. He was still able to get regular and well-paying gigs playing klezmer music in the late 1940s, as reported by Marty Levitt who played with Schwartz in 1949. To him, Schwartz was just an elderly violinist, but many of the audience had followed his career since the 1920s and saw him as \\"an icon, a cult figure\\". In the 1950s he retired from the music industry. Schwartz died in the Morrisania Hospital in the Bronx at age 75 on May 7, 1963. ==Discography== == External links == * Handwritten and published scores by Abe Schwartz in the Library of Congress Yiddish American Popular Sheet Music collection * Selection of public domain Abe Schwartz Orchestra recordings at the Florida Atlantic University Judaica collection *Abe Schwartz at the Discography of American Historical Recordings *allmusic.com Abe Schwartz profile *discogs.com Abe Schwartz profile ==References== Category:1881 births Category:1963 deaths Category:People from Bucharest Category:American people of Romanian-Jewish descent Category:Columbia Records artists Category:Klezmer musicians Category:Apollo Records artists Category:20th-century violinists ","title":"Abe Schwartz"},{"id":"2579229","text":"A.J.

But Calgary rallied, saving their season with an 8–10 record, good for a second-place finish in the West Division. The Stampeders secured their berth in the Grey Cup with playoff victories over B.C. and Edmonton. Calgary's opponent was a strong Winnipeg Blue Bombers club which had the CFL's best regular season record of 14–4. But it was clear regular season play didn't matter as the Stampeders built a 17–4 lead at halftime. Trailing 4–3 late in the second quarter, Calgary quarterback Marcus Crandell hit a streaking Marc Boerigter down the left hash marks for a 68-yard touchdown. The Stampeders struck again before intermission when Calgary flooded the right side with receivers and Crandell hit Travis Moore for a nine-yard score. It seemed to be the wake-up call the Blue Bombers needed. On their first possession of the second half, quarterback Khari Jones hit Arland Bruce III for a 23-yard touchdown completion. But the turning point came at 5:37 of the fourth quarter. With the Blue Bombers trailing 17–12, Calgary's Aldi Henry -- playing the game in his hometown -- blocked Bob Cameron's punt attempt. Willie Fells recovered the ball and ran 11 yards for a Calgary touchdown. The Blue Bombers fought back, as Jones hit Milt Stegall who made a remarkable 23-yard touchdown reception. But once again the Stampeders pulled further ahead. Stuck on the Calgary 11 with time ticking down, Crandell threw to running back Kelvin Anderson on a sideline pattern. Anderson slipped past Marvin Coleman for a 44-yard gain. Three plays later, Mark McLoughlin kicked a 24-yard field goal. There was one final comeback attempt by Winnipeg. With the Blue Bombers on the Calgary 36 with time running out, Jones was driven by Stampeders defensive tackle Joe Fleming into the turf for a game-ending sack. It was a game of missed opportunity for the Blue Bombers, who repeatedly got near or into Calgary territory and came away empty handed. Winnipeg kicker Troy Westwood missed three of four field goal attempts. ==Trivia== * The attendance of 65,255 at Montreal's Olympic Stadium was the third-largest crowd to witness a Grey Cup. * The Calgary Stampeders became the second team (and second consecutive team) with a losing regular season record to win the Grey Cup. ==2001 CFL playoffs== ===West Division=== Semi-final (November 11 @ Calgary, Alberta) Calgary Stampeders 28–19 BC Lions Final (November 18 @ Edmonton, Alberta) Edmonton Eskimos 16–34 Calgary Stampeders ===East Division=== Semi- final (November 11 @ Hamilton, Ontario) Hamilton Tiger-Cats 24–12 Montreal Alouettes Final (November 18 @ Winnipeg, Manitoba) Winnipeg Blue Bombers 28–13 Hamilton Tiger-Cats ==External links== * Grey Cup Grey Cup Category:Grey Cup Category:Grey Cups hosted in Montreal Category:Winnipeg Blue Bombers Category:Calgary Stampeders Category:2000s in Montreal Category:2001 in Quebec Category:2001 in Canadian television Category:November 2001 sports events in Canada ","title":"89th Grey Cup"},{"id":"2579237","text":"The Graces were a US band in the late 1980s and early 1990s featuring Charlotte Caffey, Meredith Brooks, and Gia Ciambotti.

When a spherical non-rotating body of a critical radius collapses under its own gravitation under general relativity, theory suggests it will collapse to a single point. This is not the case with a rotating black hole (a Kerr black hole). With a fluid rotating body, its distribution of mass is not spherical (it shows an equatorial bulge), and it has angular momentum. Since a point cannot support rotation or angular momentum in classical physics (general relativity being a classical theory), the minimal shape of the singularity that can support these properties is instead a ring with zero thickness but non-zero radius, and this is referred to as a ringularity or Kerr singularity. A rotating hole's rotational frame- dragging effects, described by the Kerr metric, causes spacetime in the vicinity of the ring to undergo curvature in the direction of the ring's motion. Effectively this means that different observers placed around a Kerr black hole who are asked to point to the hole's apparent center of gravity may point to different points on the ring. Falling objects will begin to acquire angular momentum from the ring before they actually strike it, and the path taken by a perpendicular light ray (initially traveling toward the ring's center) will curve in the direction of ring motion before intersecting with the ring. ==Traversability and nakedness== An observer crossing the event horizon of a non-rotating and uncharged (or Schwarzschild) black hole cannot avoid the central singularity, which lies in the future world line of everything within the horizon. Thus one cannot avoid spaghettification by the tidal forces of the central singularity. This is not necessarily true with a Kerr black hole. An observer falling into a Kerr black hole may be able to avoid the central singularity by making clever use of the inner event horizon associated with this class of black hole. This makes it theoretically (but not likely practically)Roy Kerr: Spinning Black Holes (Lecture at the University of Canterbury, timecode 49m8s possible for the Kerr black hole to act as a sort of wormhole, possibly even a traversable wormhole. ==The Kerr singularity as a \\"toy\\" wormhole== The Kerr singularity can also be used as a mathematical tool to study the wormhole \\"field line problem\\". If a particle is passed through a wormhole, the continuity equations for the electric field suggest that the field lines should not be broken. When an electrical charge passes through a wormhole, the particle's charge field lines appear to emanate from the entry mouth and the exit mouth gains a charge density deficit due to Bernoulli's principle. (For mass, the entry mouth gains mass density and the exit mouth gets a mass density deficit.) Since a Kerr singularity has the same feature, it also allows this issue to be studied. ==Existence of ring singularities== It is generally expected that since the usual collapse to a point singularity under general relativity involves arbitrarily dense conditions, quantum effects may become significant and prevent the singularity forming (\\"quantum fuzz\\"). Without quantum gravitational effects, there is good reason to suspect that the interior geometry of a rotating black hole is not the Kerr geometry. The inner event horizon of the Kerr geometry is probably not stable, due to the infinite blue-shifting of infalling radiation. This observation was supported by the investigation of charged black holes which exhibited similar \\"infinite blueshifting\\" behavior. While much work has been done, the realistic gravitational collapse of objects into rotating black holes, and the resultant geometry, continues to be an active research topic. ==See also== *Black hole *Black hole electron *Gravitational singularity *Geon (physics) ==Further reading== * Thorne, Kip, Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy, W.

He married Julia Rebecca Weld on April 17, 1855. Their children were Joseph Williams Bradlee, Caroline Lousia Bradlee, Elizabeth Lydia Bradlee, Eleanor Collamore Bradlee, and Hellen Curtis Bradlee. Bradlee designed many of the townhouses in Boston's South End, and was president of the Cochituate Water Board. The Bradlee Basin at the Chestnut Hill Reservoir, Newton, Massachusetts, completed in 1870, was named in his honor. In 1876 Bradlee ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Boston. From 1866 to 1896 his family lived in the Alvah Kittredge House, a Greek Revival mansion (built 1836) at 10 Linwood Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts. He vacationed in Altamonte Springs, Florida in what is now known as the Bradlee-McIntyre House (built 1885), probably the best example of Victorian Cottage Style architecture in Central Florida. In 1885, Henry Herman Westinghouse, younger brother of George Westinghouse, built a nearby house whose plan was a mirror image of the Bradlee-McIntyre House. Westinghouse also had Bradlee design homes of 12 to 15 rooms near Boston Avenue in town. Bradlee died unexpectedly in Bellows Falls, Vermont while on a train from Boston to Keene, New Hampshire. His papers are archived in the Boston Athenæum. ==Legacy== Bradlee's early 1860s Jordan Marsh department store, an ornate brownstone edifice with a landmark corner clock tower in what is now known as Boston's Downtown Crossing, sparked a major historic preservation movement in the city when it was torn down in 1975. Local architect Leslie Larson had founded a coalition called the City Conservation League to try to save the old building — one of the few survivors of the Great Boston Fire of 1872 — but it made way for a low modern brick structure that sits there today as Macy's. Some outraged customers cut up their credit cards in protest of the demolition. These protests and preservationist grassroots efforts led to the creation of the Boston Landmarks Commission. He built for Royal Robbins of Waltham Watch Co.

Other member organisations of the coalition consist of the Electoral Reform Society, YMCA, the National Youth Agency and the European Youth Forum among many more. === Current Members Organisations=== ==Parliamentary activity== Aside from youth organisations, The Votes at 16 coalition has a vast supportive network of politicians who have backed the call to lower the voting age to 16 in the UK. These politicians range from local UK councils, Members of Parliament, Lords, and Members of European Parliament to Members of Scottish Parliament, Members of Legislative Assembly and Welsh Assembly Members. In 2008 members of the coalition met a few MPs ahead of the second reading of the Voting Age (Reduction) Bill in the UK Parliament, but the bill was talked down by Stewart Jackson, Conservative MP for Peterborough. The Labour Party's Conference in 2008 voted to accept the recommendation of Labour's National Policy Forum to support Votes at 16. A number of attempts were made to bring forward Bills to reduce the voting age including Jim McMahon's Private Members Bill Representation of the People (Young People's Enfranchisement and Education) Bill 2017-19, which again was talked out when it received its Second Reading in 2017. The Welsh Assembly signalled its support for Votes at 16 and included the issue in a wider consultation on local government reform in 2019. In November 2019, legislation was passed to reduce the voting age to 16 for local and Assembly elections in time for the next Welsh parliament elections in 2021. === Scottish Independence Referendum (2014) === The Scottish National Party (SNP), who are currently in government in Scotland, have officially called for the voting age to be lowered to 16 and lowered the voting age to 16 for the referendum on Scottish Independence. However, when the SNP put forward a motion in the Scottish Parliament for a second independence referendum on the 28 March 2017, the party omitted the right for 16 and 17 year-olds to be able to vote in it. This led to the Scottish Green Party putting forward an amendment to the proposal to allow those age 16 and 17 to be able to vote in a second Scottish independence referendum. The proposal for a second independence referendum, along with the amendment to lower the voting age for it, was passed by the majority of MSPs in the Scottish Parliament.Scottish Parliament votes in favour of a second independence referendum.

Members of Youth Parliament debate five issues chosen by ‘Make Your Mark’, a ballot of young people from across the UK, and vote to decide which two issues should become the UKYP priority campaigns for the year ahead. Votes at 16 is a reoccurring issue that has been selected as one of the top five topics multiple times since 2011, the most recent being in 2018, with over 80,000 11–18-year-olds voting in favour of the campaign. Out of the five times Votes at 16 has been brought to debate, it has been chosen as a UKYP priority campaign a total of four times and is currently the lead UK wide campaign for 2019. === Westminster Hall Debate (2019) === On 3 April 2019, a Westminster Hall Debate was held on the issue, put forward by Jim McMahon. Jim McMahon MP, who in 2017 tabled a Private Members’ Bill on votes at 16, said: “Less than 50 years ago, 18, 19 and 20-year-olds were denied the right to vote [...] Our democracy and our franchise have always been evolving.” He later added that it was “scandalous” MPs have not voted on the issue. Minister for the Constitution, Chloe Smith, said it would not be given further consideration as lowering the age would break the Conservative Party manifesto. ===Votes at 16 All Party Parliamentary Group=== The All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Votes at 16 is a group of cross-party Members of Parliament allowing parliamentarians to meet to discuss a lower voting age, first established in March 2018. The purpose of the APPG is to bring together key voices from across Parliament to listen to evidence on the case for votes at 16, and to present this evidence to the Government. The current APPG Chair is Danielle Rowley. Current Vice-Chairs are Peter Bottomley, Vicky Foxcroft and Norman Lamb. Additional members of the group include Nicky Morgan, John Lamont, Jim McMahon, Jo Stevens, Paul Tyler and Hugh Gaffney. The APPG's secretariat is the British Youth Council. At the APPG's AGM held on Tuesday 2 April 2019, the Group published a Campaign Report reflecting on progress over the previous year. ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Politics of the United Kingdom Category:Youth rights Category:Electoral reform in the United Kingdom ","title":"Votes at 16"},{"id":"2579279","text":"St Peters is a suburb in the Inner WestAustralian Suburb Guide: Sydney Inner West Retrieved 7 August 2013. of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is 7 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Inner West Council.Gregory's Sydney Street Directory, Gregory's Publishing Company, 2007 ==History== St Peters was named by its association with St Peters Anglican Church, which was consecrated in 1838. St Peters is the third oldest Anglican church in Sydney and has been claimed to be the first church built in Australia using non-convict labour. The church is on the Princes Highway. It was designed by Thomas Bird and built in 1838-39. In 1875, alterations were carried out under the supervision of Edmund Blacket. The church is now listed on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/44 The graveyard is the burial place of a few notable people, including solicitor and merchant Frederick Wright Unwin, who had Unwin Road and Unwin's Bridge named after him. It is also the burial place of people who committed suicide, patients of the Bayview Mental Asylum at Tempe, and victims of unsolved murders. Graveyard history tours are conducted monthly.Inner West Courier, 2013-5-7, p.8 In 2009, the church was given a grant of $30,000 from the state government for carrying out much-needed renovations. The grant was aimed at repairing cracked walls and sealing windows. Pastor Shane Rogerson said the building was \\"ill-fated from the beginning\\" because it was built on clay-based soil, which meant it will always have problems with cracking. The first large land grant in the area was made in 1799 to Provost-Marshal Thomas Smyth. His stretched from the Cooks River to the present Campbell Street. After Smyth's death in 1804, the land was acquired by Robert Campbell (1769–1846), a wealthy merchant who built some of the early warehouses along the Sydney Cove waterfront. Alexander Brodie Spark (1792–1856) was a wealthy merchant who named the suburbs of Tempe after his mansion Tempe House that he built at what is now Wolli Creek and the suburb of St Peters that developed around the church. Barwon Park House was a large residence erected by Spark in 1815 on land leased from Robert Campbell. It was demolished in 1953. Campbell sold his property in 1830 but reserved land for the church. St Peters was described in the 1840s as one of the most fashionable and aristocratic suburbs of Sydney. St Peters Town Hall on Unwins Bridge Road. St Peters was a separate municipality from 1871 to 1948, when it amalgamated with the Municipality of Marrickville but now falls under the governance of Inner West Council. The St Peters town hall in Unwins Bridge Road was built in 1927 just across the suburb boundary in Sydenham and now houses the St Peters branch of Inner West Library and a small community centre. The railway station opened on 15 October 1884 and the post office opened in October 1851.Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon (Angus and Robertson) 1990, page 239 ===Brickworks=== In the 1870s, St Peters was an important brickmaking centre with a large brickworks on the site now known as Sydney Park, on the corner of Mitchell Road (now Sydney Park Road) and the Princes Highway, close to St Peters railway station. The brickworks closed after World War II and for most of the 1960s and 1970s the site was used as a rubbish tip, with the vast clay pits eventually filled by domestic and commercial refuse. After the tip closed in the 1980s, Sydney Park was created on the site. The area was covered, landscaped and revegetated so that several large artificial hills were created with sweeping views south to Botany Bay and north to the city. Four towering chimneys that carried exhaust from the brick kilns remain standing and have been incorporated into the Sydney Park site along with some of the kilns and various pieces of large brickworks machinery. The remains of the brickworks were heritage-listed.State Heritage Register The brickworks are well known in paleontology for the discovery of a full, intact skeleton of a Paracyclotosaurus davidi in 1910.The Journal of Paleontology, \\"Triassic isopod Protamphisopus wianamattensis (Chilton) and comparison with extant taxa (Crustacea, phreatoicidea)\\".

For a significant period during their early stages they were a seven-piece band, with members gradually coming and going until they ended up with what is considered the original lineup. The band played a support slot for visiting UK rockers Gay Dad in Houston in 2001. Lead singer Cliff Jones was very taken with the band and returned to Austin, the band's base, to record demos at Chris \\"Frenchie\\" Smith's Bubble studios. These recordings were issued as a 7-inch single on Leo Silverman's Rex Records boutique imprint. More demos including \\"Tommy Shots\\" were recorded and the band signed to XL Records. The resulting album, Mouthful of Love, was critically acclaimed by the UK music press. Jones co-wrote and produced the album, which was recorded at the Bubble and at Willie Nelson's ranch studio on the Austin City limits. The band played several UK tours including an arena tour with The Darkness, and toured Australia with seminal rockers The Specimens. In July 2004, Shuffield left the band to rejoin Fastball. He was replaced in YHA by Taylor Young. Young lived in Dallas, Texas, which made it very awkward to meet for rehearsal, and the lineup soon began to fall apart. Young then left the band to go back to university. Shuffield rejoined the band just prior to their mini UK tour, which started at the end of May 2005. After only one studio album, in early 2006 Young Heart Attack announced they were splitting up and ceased work on their second album. However the band regrouped later in 2006.

The church foundation stone was laid on 22 November 1837 by Bishop Broughton. It is one of the oldest churches in New South Wales that still has regular services. The church is heritage-listed.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company (1981) p.2/58 Internees in the church cemetery include the wife of Philip Gidley King, Governor of New South Wales, plus numerous members of the King family. The land was donated by King's son and the bricks were made on his estate. King, Gidley and Lethbridge Streets were named after various members of the King family. The site is believed to have been chosen by the mother of Phillip Parker King. The property had been acquired from John Oxley in 1828 by King, the original grant having been made in 1823. Other land grants in the area included those to Anna Josepha King in 1807 (Dunheved), Samuel Marsden (Mamre), and Mary Putland (Frogmore). The area was first called South Creek because European settlement was originally centred along the banks of the creek. The land grants became working holdings because of the permanent water supply. The rich alluvial soil along the banks of the creek ensured an expanding agricultural community and its location on what was then called the Great Western Road, later renamed to the Great Western Highway, meant that it became a convenient staging post. The name St Marys was first used when the St Mary's Post Office was opened on 1 October 1840. The township formed part of a grant to Mary Putland (later married Sir Maurice O'Connell), the daughter of Governor William Bligh (former master of , during the famous mutiny in 1789).

It is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. ==History== St Johns Park was originally home to the Cabrogal people who inhabited the broad Liverpool-Fairfield area. When the First Fleet arrived in Australia, the colonial administration designated this area the parish of St John. Nineteenth century maps indicate a St Johns Farm in the area and it is through this connection that the suburb gained its name. By the 1890s there was a public school on Parkes Road (now Edensor Road), a post office (opened in 1888), and a growing community, with an unusual number of Italians, who had arrived in the 1880s after the failure of the Marquis de Rays's expedition to New Ireland. The Bellotti and Gava families established vineyards on Bulls Road. Yugoslav migrants Theodore and Samuel Serovich arrived in 1885, also cultivating wine grapes. Both the Italian and Yugoslav communities were renewed and expanded during the period of postwar migration in the 1940s, and St Johns Park is still a very multicultural area. Members of the Gava and Serovich families still live in the area. Chicory and wild fennel growing along the banks of Clear Paddock Creek are relics of the early European farmers. ==People== According to the 2016 census, St Johns Park had a population of 6,119 people with a median age of 41, which was higher than the national median age of 38.

He served the 29th District of California from January 3, 1957 to January 3, 1963. He was the first Asian American, the first Indian American and the first member of a non-Abrahamic faith to be elected to the United States Congress. ==Biography== Photo of Dalip Singh Saund. Born in Chhajulwadi, Amritsar district, Punjab Province, British India (now Chhajjalwaddi, Punjab, India), to an Indian Punjabi Sikh family, he received his bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Punjab in 1919. He emigrated to the United States (via Ellis Island) originally to study agriculture at the University of California, Berkeley. While at the university, he obtained a master's degree (1922) and a PhD (1924), both in mathematics. His studies were sponsored by Stockton Gurdwara in Stockton, California as he lived in the gurdwara-owned Guru Nanak Khalsa Hostel. Stockton Gurdwara was \\"the first permanent Sikh American settlement and gurdwara in the United States.\\" He thereafter remained in the United States, becoming a successful farmer. He married Marian Kosa in 1928. They had three children. In 1930, Saund was commissioned by Stockton Gurdwara to write a book called “My Mother India\\" which pleaded for an end to the British Empire's occupation of the Indian subcontinent. Saund wrote that his book was intended to “answer various questions that commonly arise in the minds of the American people regarding the cultural and political problems of India.” His book addressed India's caste system as one of those questions and \\"pleaded for the civil rights of the downtrodden in India as he compared caste in India to racism in America and elsewhere.\\" Later, he campaigned to allow people of South Asian descent to become naturalized citizens. After the Luce- Celler Act was passed in 1946, he applied for naturalization and became an American citizen in 1949. He ran for election in 1950 as a Justice of the Peace for Westmoreland township, California, and won the election, but his election was thrown out as he had been a citizen for less than a year. He later ran again for the same post and won. In November 1955, he announced his campaign to run for the House of Representatives as a Democrat and won an election for an open seat against a famous Republican aviator, Jacqueline Cochran. He was re-elected twice, becoming the first Sikh American, the first Asian American, the first Indian American and first member of a non-Abrahamic faith to be elected to Congress. On May 1, 1962, Saund suffered a severe stroke on an airplane flight which left him unable to speak or walk without assistance. Though unable to campaign, he won the June Democratic primary (running in the newly numbered 38th district) but was defeated for reelection in the November general election by Republican Patrick M. Martin by a 56% to 44% margin. Following his defeat, his condition slightly improved allowing him to be moved from a hospital in Bethesda, Maryland to California. He had a second stroke about 10 years later and died on April 22, 1973 at his Hollywood home. ==Publications authored== * This book was written as a critique to the sensational Mother India, by Katherine Mayo, which argued against Indian self- rule.

His association with DJ Quik helped him secure a record deal with Select Records, who he signed to in 1991. That same year, he released his debut album, Bitch Betta Have My Money, which featured the singles \\"Jiggable Pie\\", \\"Bitch Betta Have my Money\\", \\"Vertical Joyride\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Yo Ho\\". AMG produced almost the entire album by himself, with DJ Quik serving as an additional producer on one song. The album was a moderate success commercially, reaching No. 63 on the US Billboard 200. AMG is known for his sexually explicit lyrics, and most notably for songs like \\"Bitch Betta Have My Money\\" and \\"Jiggable Pie\\". The British electronica group Hardknox later sampled \\"Bitch Betta Have My Money\\" on their single, \\"Who's Money?\\", which was originally sampled by AMG from Big Daddy Kane's song \\"Pimpin' Ain't Easy\\". Ludacris also borrowed three lines of lyrics for his song \\"Area Codes\\". AMG appeared on porn star-turn-singer Midori's album Miss Judged in 2001.

The mansion still stands at the southern end of St Helens Park Drive but it's not the oldest building in the suburb. That honour goes to a farmhouse on Appin Road called Denfield and Curtilage which was built in the 1830s by John Farley of Fisher's Ghost fame. Both buildings are listed on the Register of the National Estate. By the 1940s, the St Helens Park property had become a fly spray testing laboratory and acquired the local nickname Blowfly Farm. It was later restored as a residence and grazing property. In 1975, Campbelltown Council designated the area for suburban development and in 1976, it was formally named St Helens Park. Although development was slow at first, it continued throughout the 80s, 90s and into the 21st century. == Heritage listings == St Helens Park has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Appin Road: Denfield * St Helens Park Drive: St Helen's Park ==Schools== There are two primary schools in the suburb. Woodland Road Public at the northern end of the suburb was opened in 1980. St Helens Park Public to the south was opened in 1995. The nearest secondary school is Ambarvale High.UBD Sydney Street Directory, Universal Publishing, 2007 ==Housing== St Helens Park is one of the more modern suburbs of Campbelltown, with new subdivisions taking place as of 2006. The vast majority of new development in the suburb is in the form of detached housing. ==Demographics== According to the 2006 census, St Helens Park recorded a population of 6,136. There were higher than average numbers of families (80%) and the median family income of $1154 per week was slightly higher than the national average. The majority of residents were Australian born (72%) and spoke only English (78%) although there were substantial minorities speaking Spanish (2.2%), Lao (1.2%) and Arabic (1.0%). St Helens Park is well connected by road to both Campbelltown and Wollongong via Appin Road. The suburb is also serviced by Campbelltown's local bus company, Busabout. It is serviced by two bus routes (887 and 888), one directly from St Helens Park to Campbelltown and one on the route from Campbelltown to Appin and Wollongong.Local Bus Map ==References== Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:Towns in the Macarthur (New South Wales) ","title":"St Helens Park, New South Wales"},{"id":"2579322","text":"García Sánchez III (; 1012 – 15 September 1054),Europäische Stammtafeln: II #56, III.1 #145; Moriarty, Plantagenet Ancestry of King Edward III and Queen Philippa of Hainault, p80, 109 nicknamed García from Nájera (, ) was King of Pamplona from 1034 until his death. He was also Count of Álava and had under his personal control part of the County of Castile. As the eldest son of Sancho III he inherited the dynastic rights over the crown of Pamplona, becoming feudal overlord over two of his brothers: Ramiro, who was given lands that would serve as the basis for the Kingdom of Aragón; and Gonzalo, who received the counties of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza. Likewise, he had some claim to suzerainty over his brother Ferdinand, who under their father had served as Count of Castile, nominally subject to the Kingdom of León but brought under the personal control of Sancho III. ==Biography== García Sánchez inherited the crown of Pamplona after the death of his father Sancho III in 1035, bypassing the late king's eldest son Ramiro, who was illegitimate. In 1043 he defeated his half-brother in battle, setting the eastern border of the kingdom. García Sánchez III took advantage of the weakened state of the numerous Islamic taifa kingdoms that arose after the dissolution of the Caliphate of Córdoba to push the southern border over their territory, taking the city of Calahorra in 1045. He also inherited from his father the County of Álava and a great part of the County of Castile (La Bureba, Trasmiera, Montes de Oca, the Encartaciones and Las Merindades). In the year 1037 he joins his brother Ferdinand, the nominal Count of Castile, in a battle against the Kingdom of León that took place near the river Pisuerga and that came to be known as Battle of Tamarón. Bermudo III, King of León, was defeated and killed in battle, ending a dynasty of monarchs that went back to Peter of Cantabria. Ferdinand would then be crowned King of León.Bernard F. Reilly, The Contest of Christian and Muslim Spain 1031–1157, (Blackwell Publishers Inc., 1995), 27. The relationship between the two brothers would however turn sour by the conflictive distribution of the lands of Castile between León and Pamplona, leading to the Battle of Atapuerca, where García Sánchez would perish.Joseph F. O'Callaghan, A History of Medieval Spain, (Cornell University Press, 1975), 195. ==Marriage and family== García Sánchez III married Stephanie of Foix in Barcelona in 1038. Stephanie was the youngest daughter of Bernard-Roger, Count of BigorreSalazar y Acha agrees with the opinion of Languedoc historians who held that she was the daughter of Bernard-Roger, Count of Bigorre and his wife Gersenda, explaining Stephanie's presence in Barcelona as a lady in the court of her maternal aunt Ermesinde of Carcassonne married to Ramon Borrell, count of Barcelona. They had nine children: * Sancho Garcés, nicknamed Sancho the Noble, who became King of Pamplona and ruled as Sancho IV from 1054 until his death in 1076. He married Placencia of Normandy. * Urraca Garcés, married in 1074 to García Ordóñez, lord of Nájera and Grañón. * Ermesinda Garcés, married to Fortún Sánchez, lord of Yéqueda. * Ramiro Garcés, lord of Calahorra. * Fernando Garcés, lord of Bucesta, Jubera, Lagunilla and Oprela. * Ramón Garcés, lord of Murillo and Agoncillo. Ramón became known as the fratricidal, after he murdered his brother and King Sancho IV. Afterwards he escaped to the Taifa of Zaragoza. In an 1134 charter, Marquesa, wife of Aznar López, referred to her grandfather \\"rex Raymundi\\" (literally 'king' Ramón).

It is 39 kilometres westdistance St Clair to Sydney of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Penrith and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. St Clair is within view of the Blue Mountains. ==History== St Clair takes its name from a residential housing development established in 1970. The current St Clair Post Office opened on 17 March 1981. ===Aboriginal culture=== Traditionally, the area was inhabited by the indigenous Dharug people. By the year 1816 however, the Dharug people had been decimated by clashes with settlers and by contracting diseases brought to the area by Europeans. As time passed, the traditional culture declined as it did across the entire continent and they became increasingly dependent on the settlers for their survival. Although they had always maintained a camp on or around the Mamre estate (which is found adjacent to St Clair, in the suburb of St Marys the Rev. Samuel Marsden now sought to encourage them to work in exchange for food and clothing. right ===European settlement=== The area was part of an area named South Creek. It was later, unofficially, known as South St Marys, with the southern section being named Erskine Park. The original site of St Clair was once part of Chatsworth Nursery, a branch of Darling Nursery, which had been established in 1827 during the reign of King George IV. The owner Thomas Shepherd developed an irrigation system utilizing water from Eastern Creek and a large portion of the area was covered with Camelia orchards. The nursery, known for its camellias, was moved to Colyton and existed until the end of the 19th century. The area remained largely rural until a new housing development in the 1970s. The name \\"St Clair\\" has no historical links with the area. It was the name given to a residential housing development established in 1970 by the Latex Finance Company, a subsidiary of the Cambridge Finance Company which went bankrupt in the year 1976. The Land Commission of New South Wales acquired the land after a bankruptcy declaration and extended the area to create a large suburb. The Geographical Names Board of New South Wales eventually made the decision in late 1981 to divide the area into two separate suburbs named St Clair and Erskine Park, rather than call the whole area Erskine Park as many people had desired. Its population has soared since 1981 and is now a well established suburb with modern facilities with close access to the M4 Motorway and shopping centre. ==Location== The suburb is bordered by Erskine Park Road to the east, the M4 Motorway on the north and Mamre Road along its western boundary. The suburb to the south and east of St Clair is Erskine Park. Considerable parklands provide open space for recreational activities and St Clair is renowned for having a family oriented atmosphere. Next to St Clair is Erskine Park but once called \\"Fox Dale\\", which is located on the eastern and southern sides of Erskine Park Road. Erskine Park is not as big as St Clair in housing and population, but a massive new industrial area to the south encompassing developments on Lenore Lane and James Erskine Drive is partially developed and bringing new opportunities to the area. The new development is expected to bridge Old Wallgrove Rd with Lenore Lane and Archibold Road in the future. This will create a freight corridor connecting the area's three main industrial areas at Minchinbury, Erskine Park and Wonderland, along with the two mines in the area, encouraging heavy vehicles down non-suburban back roads, freeing up the existing roads for car traffic, and substantially reducing travel time from the current 45 minutes in heavy traffic to 10 minutes. ==Schools== The suburb has one public high school which is located on Endeavour Avenue, named St Clair High School. Some St Clair residents are zoned to go to the nearby Erskine Park High School. Private high schools near St Clair include Emmaus Catholic College and Mamre Anglican School. Primary schools in St Clair include St Clair Public School, Banks Public School, Blackwell Public School, Clairgate Public School and Holy Spirit Catholic School. A fire occurred at St Clair High School in the early morning hours of 29 June 2014.http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/breaking-news/high-school-badly- damaged-in-sydney-fire/story-fni0xqi3-1226970804781 Fire and Rescue NSW reported later that morning that the fire was extinguished by 0545, but that 80% of a two-storey building was destroyed. There were no victims. ==Commercial area== St Clair shopping centre has recently undergone a major refurbishment with new specialty stores, a food court area, and outdoor seating. It contains medical facilities including X-ray, pathology and optometrist, food outlets, news, fashion and jewellery, electronics, the local library, and a petrol station. Two local schools border the shopping centre to the west and south, as do soccer fields to the north containing a recently constructed skate bowl. Theres also 3 BWS bottle shops located in this small suburb in close proximity The Blue Cattle Dog Hotel is the only pub located in St Clair or Erskine Park. It is on the corner of Mamre Road and Banks Drive. ==Politics== St Clair is in the federal Division of McMahon, held by Australian Labor Party's Chris Bowen and the state district of Mulgoa, held by Liberal Tanya Davies. It was previously in the federal Division of Prospect. ==Leisure Centre== St Clair has an indoor leisure centre, located behind St Clair Shopping Centre. The centre is managed by the local government authority Penrith City Council.http://www.penrithcity.nsw.gov.au/stlclairleisurecentre ==Neighbourhood Centre== St Clair Youth and Neighbourhood Team Inc.

The area was used for cattle and dairy farming for the next 150 years or so. In 1957, the first plans were announced by the state government to create a large satellite city in the area but the idea foundered after locals opposed it because the land was such good farming land. Nevertheless, the sprawl of Sydney towards Campbelltown couldn't be halted. In 1976, the name St Andrews was approved for the suburb and in 1977, Landcom began building homes in the area. The following year a primary school was opened and the suburb was well established. ==Population== In the 2006 Australian Bureau of Statistics Census, the suburb of St Andrews had a population of 5,952 people, with higher than average numbers of Australian citizens (90%) and people born overseas (28%).

The biography is composed of 19,214 lines, in rhyming octosyllabic couplets, and was written in the Anglo- Norman language. It is the major extant text documenting Marshal's life.

He was also known as Raffaello Capponi after his adoptive family. The appellation \\"del Garbo\\" comes from the location of his workshop on the street formerly known as the via del Garbo, now the via della Condotta. He was also called Raffaelle de' Carli and signed at least one altarpiece, in situ in the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Valli, Siena, as \\"Raffaello de Florentia\\" [i.e. Raphael of Florence]. He was a pupil of Filippino Lippi, with whom he remained until 1490, if not later. He accompanied Filippino to Rome, where, according to Vasari, he painted the anteroom of the chapel of St. Thomas Aquinas (Carafa Chapel) in the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. Vasari thought the artist died at Florence in 1524, but he was certainly alive in 1527, when he was described as fit for military duty. He probably succumbed to the plague that ravaged Florence between 1527 and 1528. His pupils reportedly included Andrea del Sarto and the young Bronzino. ==Works== Raffaellino produced altarpieces, frescoes and small scale religious works for domestic interiors. His activity was focused on Florence and its environs. Four extant altarpieces are signed and dated: *Madonna and Child with Saints Francis, Zenobius and Two Donors, dated 1500, once at the Ospedale di Santa Maria Nuova, Florence, and now at the Museo del Cenacolo di San Salvi, Florence. *Mass of Saint Gregory, dated 1501, originally in the Antinori chapel, Santo Spirito, Florence, and now at the Ringling Museum of Art, Sarasota, Florida. *Madonna and Child with Two Angels, Saints Jerome and Bartholomew, dated 1502, originally in the Corsini chapel, Santo Spirito, Florence, and now at the Palace of the Legion of Honor, San Francisco, California. *Madonna and Child in Glory with Saints Bernardo degli Uberti, Mary Magdalen, John the Baptist and a Bishop Saint, dated 1502, in its original location over the high altar of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Valli, Siena. Madonna and Child with saint Joseph and an AngelOther altarpieces include the Pietà of about 1497, originally in the Nasi chapel in Santo Spirito, Florence, and now at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich; the Resurrection of about 1498 for the church of the Benedictine monastery of Monte Oliveto, Florence, now in that city's Galleria dell'Accademia; and the Madonna and Child with Saints John the Evangelist, Lawrence, Stephen and Bernard for the Segni chapel in Santo Spirito, which remains in its original location, in its original frame, and is inscribed with the date of 1505. In 1503 he frescoed the Miracle of the Loaves in the refectory of the Florentine convent of the Cestello (now called Santa Maria Maddalena dei Pazzi), now detached and displayed alongside its sinopia (underdrawing) in the church of Sant'Antonino a Bellariva in the outskirts of Florence.

The bridge opens at set times to allow yachts with high masts to pass. The Spit is the site of the Middle Harbour Yacht Club and a marina. ==History== From as early as 1834, a ferry operated by Barney Kearns carried passengers across the waters of Middle Harbour. From the 1850s, a punt operated by Peter Ellery, carried passengers across for sixpence and horse-drawn vehicles were charged 1s 6d. If the horses swam across, there was a reduction of sixpence. In 1889, it was replaced by a government steam punt. A wooden bridge was opened in 1924 after the electric tram lines were extended to the Spit. This was replaced by the bascule bridge in 1958, which was needed to cope with heavy traffic from the Sydney CBD to the Northern Beaches. Chinamans Beach was named after the Chinese residents who had market gardens and salt pans there.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 245, it is now a popular children's location. ==Heritage listings== The Spit has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Monash Crescent (East Side): Middle Harbour Syphon ==References== Category:Sydney localities Category:Mosman, New South Wales ","title":"The Spit, New South Wales"},{"id":"2579352","text":"Damasonium alisma is a species of flowering marsh plant known by the common name of starfruit.

Numbers have declined as a result of the loss of pond habitats. It was not recorded in the wild in 2006 and is classified as endangered within the United Kingdom. Seeds from the (extinct) Headley Heath population were germinated in undisturbed ponds managed by Surrey Wildlife Trust in 2013, and have grown there each year since (at least up to 2018). == Ecology == Damasonium alisma grows in acidic ponds. In Great Britain it went into decline along with the village pond. It once grew in many English counties from Sussex north to Shropshire, but by 1900 was reduced to two ponds in Buckinghamshire and one in Surrey. It is gradually starting to make a comeback due to intense conservation efforts. It requires open, well-lit, shallow water to grow in and regularly churned-up mud for its seeds to germinate. It is very variable in form according to the depth of the water it is growing in. Dwarf plants with aerial leaves occur growing sub- terrestrially on mud. The number of ovules vary. Usually there are two in each carpel, but carpels with four to many occur over the range. Multi-ovulate forms from southwestern Europe and Sicily were originally described as D. polyspermum. The shape of the follicles depends on the number of seeds; the beak (empty upper part) of the carpel is elongated in two-seeded plants, whereas in many-seeded plants the seeds occupy more of the follicle and the beak is relatively shorter and less well defined. == Taxonomy == It was first described by Carl Linnaeus as Alisma damasonium in 1753, but was assigned to the genus, Damasonium, in 1768 by Philip Miller. ==ReferencesCategory:Alismataceae Category:Flora of Kazakhstan Category:Flora of Moldova Category:Flora of Ukraine Category:Flora of Russia Category:Flora of Greece Category:Flora of Italy Category:Flora of Spain Category:Flora of Portugal Category:Flora of France Category:Flora of Great Britain Category:Plants described in 1768 Category:Freshwater plants Category:Endangered species of the British Isles Category:Taxa named by Philip Miller Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Damasonium alisma"},{"id":"2579359","text":"Spit Junction is an urban locality in the suburb of Mosman in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

North Strathfield and Strathfield are separate suburbs, to the north. Strathfield South is located between Liverpool Road (Hume Highway) and the Cooks River, bordered on the east by Coronation Parade and to the west by the Enfield Marshalling Yards. ==History== Most of Strathfield South is located on two early land grants - the 1808 grant to James Wilshire (later known as the Redmire Estate) and the 1837 grant to Father John Joseph Therry, which became the Village of St Anne's. Wilshhire's grant was subdivided in 1867 and marketed as the 'Redmire Estate'. Roads in Strathfield South such as Dean Street and Water Street were established in this subdivision. A few early Victorian and Federation style homes survive from this early period of development. Father John Joseph Therry was granted in March 1837. To finance the building of the original St. Anne's Church (foundation stone laid July 1841) Father Therry offered blocks for £25, but insufficient money being available, a further 134 allotments were offered for sale in 1854 and the streets of the subdivision named after Saints or dignitaries of the Church. St Anne's Church is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register. The area around St Anne's Village and to the west of Cooks River was locally known as Bark Huts. Bark Huts was a hotel on Liverpool Road, halfway between Sydney and Liverpool, and a small settlement was established around the hotel. The Village of St Anne’s and the southern part of the Redmire Estate became known as Druitt Town. This name was given to the area by Joshua Judge Josephson, who owned large areas of land in the area, in honour of his friend Major George Druitt. Druitt Town Public School opened in 1881. thumb The area became part of Enfield Municipal Council in 1889, shortly after which \\"Druitt Town\\" ceased to be used: addresses in the suburb instead became listed under the suburb of Enfield. The Druitt Town post office was moved to Enfield. Druitt Town public school was renamed Strathfield South Public School. The area was reincorporated into Strathfield Municipality in 1949, after which Strathfield Council renamed the part of former Enfield Municipality between Liverpool Road and the Cooks River as \\"Strathfield South\\".

He was one of the figures in the generation of European musicians whose successful careers were prematurely terminated by the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany and whose works have been rarely noted or performed. ==Life== Schulhoff was born in Prague into a German-Jewish family. His father Gustav Schulhoff was a wool merchant from Prague and his mother Louise Wolff from Frankfurt.http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz117302.html (26 February 2016) The noted pianist and composer Julius Schulhoff was his great-uncle. Antonín Dvořák encouraged Schulhoff's earliest musical studies, which began at the Prague Conservatory when he was ten years old. He studied composition and piano there and later in Vienna, Leipzig, and Cologne, where his teachers included Claude Debussy, Max Reger, Fritz Steinbach, and Willi Thern. He won the Mendelssohn Prize twice, for piano in 1913 and for composition in 1918. He served on the Russian front in the Austro-Hungarian army during World War I. He was wounded and was in an Italian prisoner-of-war camp when the war ended.Patricia Ann Hall, Berg's Wozzeck (Oxford University Press, 2011), 40–1 He lived in Germany after the war before returning in 1923 to Prague, where he joined the faculty of the conservatory in 1929. He was one of the first generation of classical composers to find inspiration in the rhythms of jazz music.Peter Demetz, Prague in Danger: The Years of German Occupation, 1939–45 (NY: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2008), 108 Schulhoff also embraced the avant- garde influence of Dadaism in his performances and compositions after World War I. When organizing concerts of avant-garde music in 1919, he included this manifesto: Schulhoff occasionally performed as a pianist in the Prague Free Theatre.Holzknecht, p. 305 He also toured Germany, France and England performing his own works, contemporary classical compositions, and jazz.Donald L. Niewyk and Francis R. Nicosia, The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust (Columbia University Press, 2000), 395 His 1921 Suite for Chamber Orchestra, in one critic's words, \\"is stylistically mixed, with jazz-like numbers...encompassing two slow affecting ones...as if the clown of Die Wolkenpumpe has let the mask slip as he recalled the horrors and absurdities of the trenches.\\" He wrote his friend Alban Berg in 1921:Chris Woodstra, Gerald Brennan, Allen Schrott, All Music Guide to Classical Music: The Definitive Guide to Classical Music (All Media Guide, 2005), 1213 Olin Downes praised a Salzburg performance of his Five Pieces for String Quartet in 1924: Downes reported that following the performance Schulhoff played American ragtime numbers on piano at a local inn \\"till the walls tottered\\". In 1928, the Flonzaley Quartet played the String Quartet No. 1 at their farewell New York concert between works of Beethoven and Brahms, and it was greeted enthusiastically. A 1930 performance of Schulhoff's Partita by Walter Gieseking proved to be the audience's favorite work of the recital \\"to judge from the applause and laughter\\" wrote one reviewer, \\"which greeted the sections bearing such titles as 'All Art Is Useless' and 'Alexander, Alexander, You Are a Salamander'.\\" He composed his Concerto for String Quartet and Wind Orchestra in 1930, which provides, in one critic's estimation, \\"a fascinating inversion of the traditional concerto grosso style, with winds providing the framework of the piece as a whole, within which the string quartet appears as contrast and solo.\\" The Boston Symphony gave the U.S. premiere on 23 February 1995 with the hawthorne String Quartet. In the 1930s, Schulhoff faced mounting personal and professional difficulties. Because of his Jewish descent and his radical politics, he and his works were labelled degenerate and blacklisted by the Nazi regime. He could no longer give recitals in Germany, nor could his works be performed publicly. His communist sympathies, which became increasingly evident in his works, also brought him trouble in Czechoslovakia. In 1932 he composed a musical version of The Communist Manifesto (Op. 82). Taking refuge in Prague, Schulhoff found employment as a radio pianist, but earned barely enough to cover the cost of everyday essentials. When the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia in 1939, he had to perform under a pseudonym. In 1941, the Soviet Union approved his petition for citizenship, but he was arrested and imprisoned before he could leave Czechoslovakia. In June 1941, Schulhoff was deported to the Wülzburg concentration camp near Weißenburg, Bavaria. He died there on 18 August 1942 from tuberculosis. ==Musical style== This bust of Erwin Schulhoff in the fortress Wülzburg near Weißenburg in Bayern was created by Reinhart Fuchs and inaugurated on 2 October 2004. Schulhoff went through a number of distinct stylistic periods, ranging, in Anne Midgette's words, \\"from the endearing self-consciousness of talented youth in the Suite for Chamber Orchestra to the fierce somber aggression of the Fifth Symphony.\\" She found that even as his style changed there was a certain commonality, so that even the \\"angular, forceful, even raw style\\" of the late Fifth Symphony reflected \\"the late Romantic tradition of orchestral color\\". His early works exhibit the influence of composers from the preceding generation, including Debussy, Scriabin, and Richard Strauss. Later, during his Dadaist phase, Schulhoff composed a number of pieces with absurdist elements. Anticipating John Cage's 4′33″ by more than thirty years, Schulhoff's In futurum (part of Fünf Pittoresken for piano, written in 1919) is a silent piece composed entirely of rests, with the interpretative instruction \\"tutto il canzone con espressione e sentimento ad libitum, sempre, sin al fine\\" (\\"the whole piece with free expression and feeling, always, until the end\\"). The composition is notated in great rhythmic detail, employing bizarre time signatures and intricate rhythmic patterns. Schulhoff's work is itself predated by humorist Alphonse Allais's nine-measure silent work of 1897 Funeral March for the Obsequies of a Deaf Man. A 1923 report of a Bochum performance puts Schulhoff in the context of his contemporaries: Schulhoff's third period dates from approximately 1923 to 1932. The pieces composed during these years, his most prolific years as a composer, are the most frequently performed of his works, including the String Quartet No. 1 and Five Pieces for String Quartet, which integrate modernist vocabulary, neoclassical elements, jazz, and dance rhythms from a variety of sources and cultures. He thought of jazz as a dance idiom and in a 1924 essay expressed the view that no one, including Stravinsky and Auric, had yet successfully blended jazz and art music. Performers of his Sonata for Violin and Piano No. 2 (1927) have described how it \\"draws liberally on the composers interests and abilities as a bona fide jazzman, acerbic wit and dance aficionado\\" and said its andante has \\"the kind of expressivity you find in the music of Berg\\". One critic has written that \\"Schulhoff's notion of what constitutes jazz are as surreal as some of the Dadaist texts he set...; some of the music is rather more indebted to de Falla and Russian Orientalism than ragtime or anything trans-Atlantic.\\" He thought that innovations like an entire movement of the Suite for Chamber Orchestra (1921) for percussion alone and the use of the siren in another \\"would have seemed outlandish enough in 1921, even if it all sounds a bit tame now [1995].\\" A New York Times critic in 1932 called the Duo for violin and cello (1925) \\"long-winded and even insincere\\", while a performance in 2012 noted it was dedicated to Janáček, evokes Ravel's Sonata for Violin and Cello and \\"blends folk and contemporary elements\\" while employing \\"a range of sonorities and effects like dramatic pizzicatos\\" while \\"vivacious Hungarian fiddle playing enlivens the Zingaresca movement\\". His jazz oratorio H.M.S. Royal Oak tells the story of a naval mutiny against a superior who prohibits jazz on board ship.Demetz, Prague in Danger, 109 The final period of his career was dedicated to socialist realism, with Communist ideology frequently in the foreground. In general, Schulhoff's music remains connected to Western tonality, though—like Prokofiev, among others—the fundamentally triadic conception of his music is often embellished by passages of intense dissonance. Other features characteristic of Schulhoff's compositional style are use of modal and quartal harmonies, dance rhythms, and a comparatively free approach to form. Also important to Schulhoff was the work of the Second Viennese School, though Schulhoff never adopted serialism as a compositional tool.New Grove Dictionary of Music, 2nd ed.

Prior to 2004, HCEOs were known as sheriff's officers and were responsible for enforcing High Court writs on behalf of the high sheriff for each county, but they are now directly responsible for such writs. HCEOs operate only in England and Wales. ==Role and history== High Court enforcement officers are authorised by the Lord Chancellor, and assigned to one of a number of enforcement districts. Historically they would be assigned to the shrieval county (roughly the historic shire) of the corresponding high sheriff, but under the Courts Act 2003, this connection is severed and the districts are not necessarily coterminous with the shrievalty. The officers retain the common law powers of a sheriff, and, like the sheriff previously, can delegate this authority to others acting in their presence and on their behalf; every constable is obliged, upon their request, to assist them in executing a writ. ==Power of the High Court== Unlike a bailiff, who is an officer of a lower court, an HCEO is an officer of the High Court, and consequently has much greater power. No notice is required to the party on which the writ is executed; commercial premises can be broken into by the officer by any means they choose; and once present in a property they cannot be forcibly removed. Obstructing an HCEO in the execution of a writ is considered to amount to a contempt of court, as was historically the case with sheriff's officers. == Writs == The most common writ is the writ of control, known until 2014 as a writ of fieri facias. This writ is essentially for debt collection, but it actually takes the form of an order to the officers to seize goods from the judgment debtor worth a particular amount of money; the HCEO will attend the debtor's premises, seize the goods, and then sell them at auction. Once the writ is awarded, the judgment debtor can avoid the removal and sale of assets by either paying in full or agreeing a repayment plan. If they take this action, the assets will still technically remain seized and belong to the court until the debt is fully cleared, but are normally left in situ under a walking-possession agreement. Any proposed repayment schedule will have to be agreed by the claimant. Should the judgment debtor subsequently default on a payment, the claimant can instruct the HCEO to attend to remove and sell the seized assets; if the debtor disposes of the assets, they are committing contempt of court. The debt does not need to be argued in the High Court; provided the amount owed is at least £600 (in 2014), the debt did not arise in a matter covered by the Consumer Credit Act 1974, and payment has not been made within the specified time, a County Court judgment can be transferred to the High Court for enforcement. The High Court fee for issuing a writ of control is £66; together with the HCEO's fees, this £66 court fee is added by the writ to the amount to be recovered from the debtor. ==References== Category:Law enforcement occupations in the United Kingdom Enforcement officer ","title":"High Court enforcement officer"},{"id":"2579429","text":"The Grant Building is 40-story, skyscraper at 310 Grant Street in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The Art Deco building's facade is built with Belgian granite, limestone, and brick. It was famous for a radio antenna that rose roughly from the roof of the tower and had an aviation beacon that spelled out .--. .. - - ... -... ..- .-. --. .... or P-I-T-T-S-B- U-R-G-H in Morse Code. The beacon could be seen as far away as on clear nights. A smaller version of the beacon, still flashing out the name of the city remains to this day, although malfunctions with the relay switch caused it to spell \\"P-I-T-E-T-S-B-K-R-R-H\\", and eventually \\"T-P-E-B-T-S-A-U-R-G-H\\" before being repaired on July 27, 2009. The tower on the roof also served as the broadcast antenna for radio station KDKA Pittsburgh which made the first commercially licensed radio broadcast on election night of 1920. At 7:00 AM on its 14th birthday (February 2, 1934), the radio station inaugurated new studios on the Grant Building's third floor.

(, literally \\"What's Up with Cinta?\\") is a 2002 Indonesian Film directed by Rudy Soedjarwo. The Indonesian title is a play on words, as Cinta (Indonesian for \\"love\\") is also the name of the main character. As such, the title can be translated as \\"What's Up with Love?\\" as well as \\"What's Up with Cinta?\\", meaning the person. The film is coloured with Indonesian mainstream as well as sidestream values, elements of classical culture and politics, and real issues encountered in teen life. The film raised censorship controversies among conservative Muslims in Indonesia, being the first Indonesian teen movie that featured a scene of a passionate kiss. The movie is known as Beautiful Days in Japan. Shortly after its success, What's Up with Cinta? was adapted into a sinetron (soap opera) version. In 2014, Japanese chatting software LINE released a promotional short film featuring the cast of What's Up with Love? titled Ada Apa dengan Cinta? 2014 that portrays Rangga contacting Cinta via LINE after 12 years. The short's success led to a full-length feature film sequel, Ada Apa Dengan Cinta? 2 in 2016 that serves as an official follow up to this movie, ignoring the events from the short film. The sequel was met with much success. == Plot == Cinta (Dian Sastrowardoyo) is a popular teenage girl living a comfortable lifestyle. She is gifted and accomplished, surrounded by a group of faithful friends consisting of the wise Alya (Ladya Cheryll), the tomboyish Karmen(Adinia Wirasti), the sassy Maura (Titi Kamal), and the ditzy Milly (Sissy Priscillia). She also has caring and supportive parents. The story begins with Cinta and her four best friends crying on each other's shoulders for Alya, who was the victim of domestic abuse by her father. Cinta recites the group's pledge to the buku curhat, a diary or scrapbook shared by the girls, that a problem one of them is going through is to be shared with all of them. Cinta is a school poet who has been honored for her work, and, in her final year of high school, she submits a beautiful poem to the yearly poetry contest. However, much to the students' surprise, Cinta does not win. The grand prize in the contest is awarded to a boy named Rangga (Nicholas Saputra), whose name is not well known in the school. However, Rangga, rather than going to the podium to receive his prize, takes offence and retreats to a hiding spot. Cinta is somewhat jealous of Rangga's unexpected victory, but is careful not to show it. This leads Cinta to search for Rangga and request an interview for the school bulletin. However, Rangga immediately detects insincerity in Cinta's congratulations and walks away, leaving Cinta to be irritated by his perceived arrogance. As it turns out, Rangga never entered his poem for the contest; it was submitted on his behalf by his only best friend, the school janitor Mr. Wardiman (Mang Diman). Cinta and Rangga start to dislike each other, and so do her friends. They briefly warm up to each other after Rangga thanks Cinta for returning his book. It doesn't last long since Rangga offends Cinta in a bookstore. When Rangga tries to apologize to Cinta the next day, he is beaten up by Borné (Febian Ricardo), a guy who had been trying to start a relationship with Cinta. Rangga and Cinta start to become friends when Cinta visits Rangga in his house, where she discovers that Rangga lives in a lower- middle-class neighbourhood with his father Yusrizal, whose outspokenness has led to bomb threats from pro-government thugs. Moreover, his parents divorced because of his father's dismissal from a government office for exposing government corruption. Alya, who regularly tells Cinta her broken home problems, is the only one Cinta tells of her budding closeness with Rangga. The secret friendship causes changes in Cinta's behaviour, resulting in problems with Cinta's group of girl friends. She starts to regularly lie to her friends in order to spend more time with Rangga. The problem reaches its climax when Cinta ignores Alya's desperate request to talk with her because she is going on a date with Rangga. When she comes home, she is told that Alya is in the hospital because she attempted suicide. At the hospital, the friends realize that Cinta has been lying all along, straining their friendship. Thinking it was all her fault, Cinta then shuts Rangga out, hurting him. When Alya recovers, she discusses Rangga with Cinta, which Karmen, Maura, and Milly overhear and finally discover the formerly budding relationship between Cinta and Rangga. Cinta apologizes to them and Maura advises her to forget Rangga. Cinta does so, and she goes on with her life. Meanwhile, Karmen sees Rangga give Mr. Wardiman a goodbye hug. Noticing that Cinta turns quiet and uncommunicative, her friends realize the error of their ways and Cinta confesses that she is in love with Rangga, but is not ready to admit it. Karmen tells her she doesn't have much time since she saw Rangga leave. Mr. Wardiman tells the girls that Rangga is heading to the airport. In a rush, they force their nerdy schoolmate Mamet (Dennis Adhiswara), whom they ridicule throughout the film, to lend his car so they can go to the airport. Cinta manages to catch Rangga, as he and his father are moving to New York City. They profess their love for each other and share a kiss, but Rangga has to go, leaving Cinta heartbroken. Before departing, Rangga gives Cinta a book and tells her to read the last page. They bid each other one last farewell, and he boards the plane. In the car, Cinta reads the last page, which contains a poem Rangga wrote about her. The last line says that he will return before the full moon. Suddenly, the girls freak out when they realize they have left Mamet in the airport. == Cast == * Dian Sastrowardoyo as Cinta * Nicholas Saputra as Rangga * Ladya Cheryl as Alya * Titi Kamal as Maura * Sissy Priscillia as Milly * Adinia Wirasti as Karmen * Dennis Adhiswara as Mamet * Febian Ricardo as Borné * Mang Diman as Mr. Wardiman * Gito Rollies as Limbong == Music == Ada Apa dengan Cinta? is the soundtrack to the 2002 film of the same name by musician Melly Goeslaw and Anto Hoed under Aquarius Musikindo label.

The band self released two demo records in the late 1990s one titled \\"Vex Red\\" released in 1998 and the second \\"Sleep Does Nothing for You\\" the following year. In 1999 the band recruited vocalist and guitarist Terry Abbott to complete the line up. Entering into a demo tape competition by Kerrang! and Ross Robinson the band were quickly signed to Robinson's Virgin Records imprint, I Am. In 2001 the band released their first single \\"Itch\\". The second single \\"Can't Smile\\" was delayed but was finally released on 18 February 2002. The single was a modest success charting at number 45 on the UK Singles Chart, spending two weeks in the top 100. The band's debut album produced by Ross Robinson, \\"Start with a Strong and Persistent Desire\\" was released on 4 March 2002. The album charted at number 48 on the UK Albums Chart and also spent two weeks on the chart. Shortly after the release of the debut album the band were dissatisfied with their time on Robinson's I Am record label decided to leave the label. Virgin Records being in turmoil at the time lead to some office closures and cuts. This coupled with the band citing wrong vocal takes being used on \\"Itch\\" and various release dates confusingly being issued for the follow up single \\"Can't Smile\\" and the debut album, the band managed to litigate their release. In 2003 lead singer Terry Abbott departed the band, citing unhappiness in the project and his desire to work on side projects. The band initially wished to continue without Abbott and moved on to form the alt rock outfit Scenes recruiting vocalist Fraser McGuinness. Locking themselves away in a converted Oast House Studio in Hampshire to write new material, Scenes went on to play a number of shows with artists such as Oceansize and Scan, but disbanded in early 2005. ===2015-present: Reformation and new music=== The band reunited in 2015, announcing that they would be playing shows and making new music. In July 2016, they announced on their Instagram that Dave Neale formally of Death in Vegas and Rooster would be joining the band as the new drummer. On 5 December 2016 the band released their first new music since 2002 with the single \\"Burn this Place\\". It was also announced they would play a handful of shows UK in January 2017. In early 2018 the band played a handful of shows supporting Hell is for Heroes in celebration of the 15th Anniversary of their debut album The Neon Handshake, including a sold out show at the London O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire. In 2018 Vex Red were one of only a handful of artists to be personally invited by Robert Smith of The Cure to play his Meltdown Festival at London’s Southbank Centre.

The purpose of TE buffer is to solubilize DNA or RNA, while protecting it from degradation. == Recipe == A typical recipe for making 1X TE buffer is: * 10 mM Tris, bring to pH 8.0 with HCl * 1 mM EDTA, bring to pH 8.0 with NaOH TE buffer is also called as T10E1 Buffer, and read as \\"T ten E one buffer\\". To make a 100 ml solution of T10E1 Buffer, 1 ml of 1 M Tris base (pH 10-11) and 0.2 ml EDTA (0.5 M) are mixed and made up with double distilled water up to 100ml. Add microliter amounts of high molarity HCl to lower the pH to 8. Based on nuclease studies from the 1980s, the pH is usually adjusted to 7.5 for RNA and 8.0 for DNA. The respective DNA and RNA nucleases are supposed to be less active at these pH values, but pH 8.0 can safely be used for storage of both DNA and RNA . EDTA further inactivates DNase, by binding to metal cations required by this enzyme. Genomic and plasmid DNA can be stored in TE Buffer at 4 °C (39.2 °F) for short-term use, or -20 °C (-4 °F) to -80 °C (-112 °F) for long-term storage. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided. == Low TE or TE Low EDTA == The operation of the TE buffer is based on chelating metal cations such as Mg2+. The problem is that the PCR polymerase also requires Mg2+ to function, so if the amount of EDTA is too high it can affect the PCR. There is a version of TE buffer with 10 times less amount of EDTA that is very frequently used for the forensic STR kits. Due to the use of kits with multiplex amplification, it is necessary to have a lower amount of EDTA in the sample so as not to interfere with the Mg2+ present in the reaction. If regular TE buffer is used to dilute the sample, an imbalance will be observed in the DNA profile, while Low TE will have a better balance. The Low TE buffer or TE Low EDTA buffer is composed of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) + 0.1 mM EDTA. ==See also== *LB buffer, lithium borate buffer, a similar buffer containing lithium ions in place of Tris *TAE buffer and TBE buffer are often used in procedures involving nucleic acids, the most common being electrophoresis. ==References== ph7.4 TE buffer=100mM/L Tris(pH7.4)+10mM/L EDTA(pH8.0) from Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual == External links == * Category:Buffers ","title":"TE buffer"},{"id":"2579483","text":"Eduard Yefimovich Gufeld (19 March 1936 – 23 September 2002) was a Soviet International Grandmaster of chess, and a chess author. ==Chess career== Gufeld began participating in chess tournaments in 1953 and won the junior championship of Ukraine the following year.

It is an owned-and-operated station of the national K-Love Contemporary Christian network, covering the South Coast of Massachusetts from a tower located on the campus of the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Prior to 2006, WTKL was the student-run radio station at the university, when it was known as WUSM and later WSMU-FM; in conjunction with the sign-on of higher-power WUMD 89.3, UMass sold the 91.1 license to the Educational Media Foundation. ==History== ===College radio=== Southeastern Massachusetts University, as it was then known, built and signed on WUSM in September 1974. The station operated with 10 watts at 90.5 MHz and broadcast from studios in the basement of the university residents' cafeteria before moving into the campus center. New Bedford television station WTEV (channel 6) petitioned against the grant of the facility and a series of other educational stations in the area, worried about interference; their petition delayed the station from getting a construction permit by 18 months; obtaining office space on the campus was its own challenge. The station's early years featured a bumpy stretch in 1977, when the general manager and program director were forced out by the governing board over unstated allegations. However, they also featured growth. Through the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System, WUSM obtained a hookup with ABC; programming from the American FM Network began airing on the station on February 19, 1979. Also in 1979, WUSM was granted a construction permit to move to 91.1 MHz and increase its effective radiated power to 300 watts. On November 13, 1979, the station's existing antenna collapsed in a windstorm, after work had already begun on implementing the frequency change and power increase. The improvements did not take effect, however, until March 27, 1981. On that date, after months of delays, WUSM premiered at its new dial position; as part of its upgraded facilities, the radio station began broadcasting the Talking Information Center, a radio reading service for the blind, on its subcarrier. Approval of a second power increase, to 1,200 watts, came in 1982, after WUSM had already noted an increase in local interest from the first upgrade. In 1986, WUSM suffered a series of technical challenges: a power surge in the campus center damaged the transmitter and forced the expensive replacement of other parts, and then the station was forced to go to air from its secondary production studio after wires in the main studio board burned out. Throughout the late 1980s, WUSM broadcast a more mainstream alternative format than most college radio stations because it was the only station in the format on the South Coast; the nearest rock station was in Providence. The station changed its call letters from WUSM to WSMU-FM in 1989. The change allowed another university to trade in call letters it did not want. The University of Southern Mississippi had operated its student radio station as WMSU since the 1970s. When the WUSM calls were made available, they were picked up the next month by that station which now operates as WUSM-FM; that university's president, Aubrey Lucas, announced the change on air, and the station's program manager said, \\"Obviously we would rather have anything other than MSU\\". The station's variety format had several long-running features. DJ Don Dread's reggae show \\"Roots Radical\\" went on the air in 1982 and only left WUMD's air in 2012 when he died of a brain tumor. ===UMD move to 89.3 and sale to EMF=== In 1993, UMass Dartmouth made an application to build a new radio station at 89.3 MHz, which would have a wider coverage area and be able to serve more listeners. (The application came a year after an adjacent-channel Boston station, WBUR proposed to have WSMU relocate in order to improve its own coverage area. The article does not mention which station specifically, but the only adjacent-channel station in Boston is WBUR, and a catalog of records of the Office of the Dean of Students includes a 1993 file on \\"WSMU- WBUR Negotiations\\".) The application was approved by the Federal Communications Commission in 2003, and in 2006, construction was completed on WUMD. In January 2006, the university sold the WSMU-FM license for $700,000 to the Educational Media Foundation, with the transmission facility remaining at the university; the sale price helped fund the construction of the new WUMD facility. The sale was a notable step forward for EMF, which prior to acquiring WSMU-FM had little presence in New England due to the price and scarcity of stations in the area; it was also cited as the \\"first major foray\\" by FM Christian broadcasting into the region. UMass Dartmouth programming moved from 91.1 to 89.3 in June 2006, enabling K-Love programming to debut on the new WTKL in early July. ==References== Category:K-Love radio stations TKL Category:Dartmouth, Massachusetts Category:Mass media in Bristol County, Massachusetts Category:Radio stations established in 1974 Category:1974 establishments in Massachusetts Category:Educational Media Foundation radio stations TKL ","title":"WTKL"},{"id":"2579547","text":"William Bartlett may refer to: *William B.

The Badami Chalukyas were exponents of early architectural achievements in Deccan. Aihole, Badami and Pattadakal were their centers of art. They were succeeded by the Rashtrakutas and the Kalyani Chalukyas. The temple has ornate pillars with intricate sculpture. The sanctum enshrines three Shivalingams. The temple has chiseled stone screens and carved figurines. There is a shrine to Saraswati within the Trikuteshwara temple complex, with exquisite stone columns. Inclined slabs that serve as balcony seats are decorated with figurative panels and are overhung by steeply angled eaves. Inside the hall, the columns have figures arranged in shallow niches. The east sanctorum has three lingas representing Brahma, Maheshwara and Vishnu; the one to the south is dedicated to the goddess Saraswati. Just by the side is another temple dedicated to three devis -- Saraswathi, Gayathri and Sharada. Only the statues are in a new style; the temple is in old architecture. ==History== The temple dates back to the Kalyani Chalukyas who ruled this region from around 1050 to 1200 CE, during which time about 50 temples were built. Saraswathi temple has been vandalised by miscreants in the early age and hence pooja is not offered here. But the architecture is superb.

It is chemically activated and has a relatively low explosive content, typically maiming rather than killing. ==Overview== The Dragontooth was designed during the Vietnam War as part of a number of programs designed to prevent infiltration into South Vietnam. Dragontooth was one of a number of airborne land mines tested, being preferred by the military because they could be used to deny access to large areas to foot traffic. Its area denial qualities were exemplified in the fact that the explosive content of any individual mine was readily capable of killing the victim, being powerful enough to remove a person's foot, but potentially incapable of even flattening the tire of a truck passing over it.United States, 1971. p. 138 The use of Dragontooth mines in Vietnam went largely unnoticed, likely as a product of its essentially classified usage primarily in Laos as part of Operation Igloo White. Production of the system had ceased by 1970, and it was predicted that existing stocks would be exhausted by the end of 1971. In stark contrast to the lack of public commentary on the Dragontooth system, the subsequent Soviet analogue, the PFM-1, spurred a lot of controversy after being used in Afghanistan during the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, being a key element leading to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. == Design == The mine itself is made out of plastic, and is hydraulically activated and contact/pressure detonated. The color of the plastic varied and could be olive drab, tan, brown, or camouflaged, and had no painted or molded markings. Each mine contained a small amount of liquid nitromethane/nitroethane explosive and was designed with a shape that would cause it to spiral down to the ground, removing the need for a parachute. A chemical self-neutralization system was used in the mines, rendering the main explosive content inert after a period of time after activation. The two major variants, the BLU-43/B and BLU-44/B, differ only in the process by which they were thus \\"sterilized.\\"Parsch, Andreas. Designation-Systems.net. 4 February 2008.

The complete Dragontooth system involved the loading of either the BLU-43/B or BLU-44/B (or its variant BLU-44A/B) into complete cluster munitions. A total of 120 BLU-43/B fit into a single CDU-2/B cluster adapter, forty of which were then loaded into a SUU-13/A cluster dispenser to form the complete CBU-28/A cluster munition.

Richards studied radio broadcasting at Loyalist College in Belleville, Ontario. In 1988 he launched his radio career at CJTN in Trenton, Ontario, close to Belleville; he also worked at CIHI in Fredericton, New Brunswick, CJCH in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He hosted a popular morning show at CFJB Rock 95 in Barrie, Ontario, north of Toronto, and was nominated for medium-market morning show of the year in 1990. From the early 1990s to 1996, he worked periodic shifts including a Saturday morning show on Toronto sports talk station The Fan. At the Fan, he gave George Stroumboulopoulos his first exposure as an on-air personality; the young board operator contributed regularly to Richards' shows. In 1994, a difficult year for sports media with both a Major League Baseball strike and National Hockey League lockout, the station gave Richards a midday shift with sports broadcaster Barb DiGiulio. In the summer of 1996, he left the Fan to work at Toronto rock station Q107 and the Rock Radio Network, hosting overnight rock music programming syndicated across Canada for the latter. He joined news-talk station CFRB in 1997. At CFRB, he hosted late evening talk show The Nightside. In 2004, Mark Elliot took over The Nightside and Richards moved to an earlier shift, weekday evenings from 8 to 11. Known officially as The Jim Richards Show, Richards also bills it as the \\"Showgram\\", \\"The Nighttime Friendly\\", \\"The Feel-Good Edition\\" and \\"The Three Hours of Love.\\" In late 2005, with the departure of Michael Coren, Richards' shift briefly moved from 7 to 10 for several weeks until Kelly Cutrara was appointed Coren's replacement and Richards returned to the 8 to 11 slot. Richards was on the 10am-noon and 1pm-3pm time slot, to replace Leslie Roberts and Paul and Carol Motts respectively but now he hosts the 12pm to 2pm time slot weekdays. ==References== ==External links== *Jim Richards' NewsTalk 1010 bio & podcast page * Category:1966 births Category:Anglophone Quebec people Category:Living people Category:People from Markham, Ontario Category:People from Montreal Category:People from Toronto Category:Canadian sports talk radio hosts Category:Canadian talk radio hosts ","title":"Jim Richards (broadcaster)"},{"id":"2579580","text":"Haapamäki is a village in the municipality of Keuruu, Finland.

Miller, Jr. is an American philosopher. He was, until his retirement in 2013, the Dexter Ferry Professor in Philosophy at Vassar College. The majority of his work concerns the late dialogues of Plato, but he has also written on Hesiod, Parmenides, and Hegel. ==Career== Mitchell “Mitch” Miller earned his bachelor's degree from Stanford University and his MA and PhD from the State University of New York at Buffalo. He joined Vassar’s Philosophy Department in 1972, rising to the rank of professor in 1984. He served as chair of the department from 1984 to 1987, in 1988, and again from 1994 to 1996. In 2009, he was appointed to the Dexter M. Ferry Jr. Chair. Miller is an exponent of the significance of the so-called \\"unwritten teachings\\" of Plato, as Miller holds the controversial idea that Plato taught advanced concepts to his students at the Academy beyond those explicitly discussed by Socrates and other principal interlocutors in Plato's dialogues. The idea, which is dismissed by many Plato scholars, is based on a brief description of such teachings by Aristotle in his Metaphysics and Physics. The Seventh Letter, which was attributed to Plato in antiquity, was later considered inauthentic for a time, and is now regarded by most scholars as genuine, also includes indications of such teachings. Miller has argued that evidence of these teachings can be found in the dialogues, but only through careful reading of structure and irony within them. Miller's work has focused on several of the late dialogues, notably the Parmenides, Statesman, and Philebus, as well as the Republic. In his book on the Parmenides, Miller argues that the eight bewildering and contradictory hypotheses that end the dialogue form an ironic guide that allows the informed reader to interpret the whole, revealing through what Miller has called \\"psychagogy\\"—a transformation of the philosophical disciple's soul—the true nature of Plato's conception of the forms. That is, the ultimate purpose of the text is not to teach the reader didactically but to draw them into a different kind of thinking. ==Books== *The Philosopher in Plato's Statesman.

The skeletal remains date to the Mesolithic (ca. 9100 BP, 7100 BC) and it appears that he died a violent death. A large crater-like lesion just above the skull's right orbit suggests that the man may have also been suffering from a bone infection. Excavated in 1903, Cheddar Man is Britain's oldest complete human skeleton. The remains are kept by the Natural History Museum in London in the new Human Evolution gallery. Analysis of his nuclear DNA indicates that he was a typical member of the western European population at the time, probably with lactose intolerance, light eyes (most likely green but could be blue or hazel), Supplementary Material (p.18): \\"This individual has light or blue/green eye colour, it is not light blue, there are elements of brown/yellow in the eye to give a proposed perceived green colour.

The genetic markers suggested (based on their associations in modern populations whose phenotypes are known) that he probably had green eyes, lactose intolerance, dark curly or wavy hair, and dark to very dark skin. These features are typical of the Western European population of the time, now known as West European Hunter-Gatherers. This population forms about 10%, on average, of the ancestry of Britons without a recent family history of immigration. ==Genetic change since the Mesolithic== Brown eyes, lactose tolerance, and light skin are common in the modern population of the area. These genes came from later immigration, most of it ultimately from two major waves, the first of Neolithic farmers from the Near East, another of Bronze Age pastoralists, most likely speakers of Indo-European languages, from the Pontic steppe. Cheddar Man's Y-DNA belonged to an ancient sister branch to modern I2-L38 (I2a2). The I2a2 subclade is still extant in males of the modern British Isles and across other parts of Europe. The mitochondrial DNA of Cheddar Man was of haplogroup U5b1. Some 65% of western European Mesolithic hunter-gatherers had haplogroup U5; today it is widely distributed, at lower frequencies, across western Eurasia and northern Africa. In 1996, Bryan Sykes of the University of Oxford first sequenced the mitochondrial DNA from one of Cheddar Man's molars.Sykes, Bryan, Blood of the Isles (Bantam, 2006) pp. 5–12 == See also == * Boxgrove * Genetic history of the British Isles * Happisburgh footprints * Kents Cavern * List of human evolution fossils * List of prehistoric structures in Great Britain * Pakefield * Prehistoric Britain * Paviland * Pontnewydd * Swanscombe Heritage Park == References == ==External links== * *Lyall, Sarah (24 March 1997). \\"Tracing Your Family Tree to Cheddar Man's Mum\\".

PFM-1 schematic PFM-1 (, short for противопехотная фугасная мина, protivopekhotnaya fugasnaya mina-1, \\"anti- infantry high-explosive mine 1\\"; NATO name: Green parrot, also known as butterfly mine) is a land mine of Soviet production, very similar to the BLU-43 US Army landmine. Both devices are very similar in shape and principles, although they use different explosives. == Action == The mine consists of a plastic container containing explosive liquid. The mine is stored with a pin restraining a detonating plunger. Once the arming pin is removed, the plunger is slowly forced forward by a spring until it contacts the detonator, at which point it is armed. This takes between one and forty minutes, allowing the mine to be deployed manually, or air dropped. Deformation of the soft plastic skin of the mine forces the arming plunger to strike the detonator, detonating the mine. Because the body of the mine is a single cumulative pressure primer, it is extremely dangerous to handle the mine: A single press of 5 kg or more will make it function. The charge is usually nonlethal, although sufficient to destroy part of the foot if stepped on. The shape of the PFM-1 derives from close-packing within the dispenser casing. The resultant shape and bright colour is attractive to children, inspiring Western media claims that they were deliberately designed to look like a toy. This has always been denied by the Soviets. The plastic body can be moulded in a variety of colours for best camouflage. As existing stocks were in European green, rather than sand coloured, the first examples used in 1980s Afghanistan were green and so easily visible. This led to their name of 'green parrots' and encouraged the deliberate toy theory. The mine can be deployed both from helicopters and by infantry. In the latter variant, a number of mines are spread over a circle with a diameter of ~15 meters. Once the fuze on a PFM-1 mine is armed it cannot be disarmed. A variant of the mine, PFM-1S, self-destroys after one to forty hours, with 85% of the mines destroyed by 80 hours. The standard render-safe procedure is to destroy the mine on site by detonating a small explosive charge next to it. == Military use == PFM-1 was mainly used during the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan, allegedly resulting in a high number of casualties among children from being mistaken for a toy due to its shape and coloring.Tanner, Stephen. \\"Afghanistan: A Military History\\" As the mine exploded, it often resulted in hand and head trauma, which was frequently lethal.

Launched as KADL in 1960 by Jefferson County Broadcasting Company, as part of the Southwestern Broadcasting group, KPBA had its license cancelled by the FCC in 2005. ==History== ===Beginning=== Jefferson County Broadcasting Company was granted a construction permit by the Federal Communications Commission for a new AM radio station in July 1959. Authorized to transmit with 5,000 watts of daytime-only power on a frequency of 1270 kHz, KADL began licensed broadcast operations on August 19, 1960. At launch, Louis Alford was the station's general manager with Philip D. Brady acting as technical director and Albert Mack Smith serving as secretary-treasurer. License holder Jefferson County Broadcasting Company was in turn owned by Southwestern Broadcasting and operated as one of several stations owned by that group across the Arkansas and Mississippi. Southwestern Broadcasting was originally jointly owned by Louis Alford, Philip D. Brady, and Albert Mack Smith. ===1960s and 1970s=== By 1961, Albert Mack Smith took over as general manager of KADL with Chester Pierce serving as both station manager and commercial manager. By 1965, the station was playing at least 50 hours of country & western music each week and Leon Soles joined the staff as chief engineer. By 1971, KADL had transitioned to a \\"100%\\" country & western music format. The station would maintain this music format throughout the 1970s with Albert Mack Smith still serving as general manager of the station and Chester Pierce serving as both station manager and chief engineer. In the late 1970s, the FCC authorized KADL to broadcast with 5,000 watts of power on an unlimited basis, no longer just during daylight hours. ===Decade of changes=== After nearly 23 years of operation as KADL, the station was assigned new call sign KABS by the FCC on April 6, 1983. The station's call sign was changed to KZLR on March 30, 1987, in support of a new format under new ownership but faced with serious economic challenges, the station went dark until new ownership could be found. The station resumed broadcasting in 1988 with new owners and the call sign was changed yet again, this time to KPBA on December 29, 1988. (The KPBA call letters had been previously used at 1590 AM, which became KYDE in 1976.) Those owners also struggled financially in the shrinking media market of Pine Bluff and by the early 1990s the station was under the ownership of Family Time Ministries of Berlin, New Jersey. Dr. R.J. Lightsey, a minister and later founder of the Jubilee Christian Center, served as KPBA's general manager from August 1991 through April 1993 when the station was sold to Wheeler Chapel Missionary Baptist Church. ===Jackie Harris years=== In October 1996, the FCC approved the sale of KPBA by the church to National Football League player Jackie Harris, a native of Pine Bluff. Harris, then a tight end with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that he decided to buy KPBA shortly after giving an interview on the station. Harris continued KPBA's Christian radio format. By 1999, he had expanded his media holdings to three radio stations, all playing a Christian radio format. In June 2001, Jackie Harris and his wife Letrece were honored for their \\"commitment to downtown Pine Bluff\\" as Small Business Persons of the Year by the Greater Pine Bluff Chamber of Commerce. Six weeks later, Harris and his company, Metro Media Group Inc. of Pine Bluff, were being sued for non-payment of debts related to the purchase of two sister stations to KPBA. Harris owed Delta Radio Inc. more than $150,000 for the purchase of those two stations, one in Pine Bluff and the other in Dumas, and owed Claud Solley back rent for the relay tower used by the Dumas station. The suits were dropped after Harris paid both Delta Radio Inc. and Claus Solley in full on August 8, 2001. After completing two years of a four-year contract to play for the Dallas Cowboys, Harris was released by the team in late February 2002 to \\"create salary cap room\\". This deprived Harris of a scheduled $400,000 roster bonus and effectively ended his NFL career. A creditor in the August 2001 lawsuit noted that Harris \\"lives from contract to contract\\" and that he relied on his income as a professional football player to subsidize his many business ventures. ==Shutdown== On July 22, 2002, the Federal Communications Commission's New Orleans Enforcement Bureau issued a Notice of Apparent Liability (NAL) against the station's licensee, Metro Birch Enterprises, Inc., a license-holding subsidiary of Metro Media Group Inc. of Pine Bluff. The NAL states that \\"The agent observed that the station's antenna tower, which had radio frequency potential at the base, was not enclosed inside a fence or other protective enclosure. Additionally, the station's public inspection file consisted of only a few letters from the public.\\" On January 28, 2003, the station was fined $17,000 \\"for wilfully violating Sections 73.49 and 73.3526(a)(2) of the Rules.\\" KPBA was deleted from the FCC database on June 24, 2005. ==References== PBA Category:Defunct radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1960 Category:Radio stations disestablished in 2005 Category:Pine Bluff, Arkansas Category:Defunct religious radio stations in the United States Category:1960 establishments in Arkansas Category:2005 disestablishments in Arkansas PBA Category:Arkansas radio station stubs PBA ","title":"KPBA (1270 AM)"},{"id":"2579694","text":"David Thomas Ackles (February 20, 1937 – March 2, 1999) was an American singer-songwriter, pianist, and child actor.

Not on your life!\\" He studied English literature at the University of Southern California, spending his junior year at the University of Edinburgh, where he studied \\"West Saxon, the origins of the English language\\". He earned a master's degree in Film Studies at USC. In 1997, when asked why he chose to major in English rather than music, he said, \\"I wanted to learn to do it all, which meant learning the construction of poetry, so I could write my own lyrics and play construction so that I could write the book to whatever musical I was creating. In the end, it in no way limited my horizons, being an English major. In fact it opened up the possibility to do so many things.\\" His wife said, \\"His ultimate goal when he was younger was to write, produce, direct, design the sets, do the music, and star in his work. And he could have done it. That's where his heart was.\\" While working a string of rent-paying jobs after college—\\"private detective, security guard, and circus roustabout\\"—he was simultaneously composing \\"musicals, ballet scores, and choral pieces. These early experiences and enthusiasms were to leave a mark on his songwriting, and helped form a distinctively theatrical singing style.\\" ==Starting music career== Ackles began his recording career as a staff songwriter for Jac Holzman at Elektra Records. None of the songs he wrote were right for any of Elektra's artists, and Holzman suggested that Ackles record his own work. His first album, the eponymous David Ackles (1968), did not achieve commercial success, even when reissued in 1971 as The Road to Cairo, but it was influential among singer-songwriters. It featured future members of the group Rhinoceros. This and his follow-up 1969 release, Subway to the Country, contained songs that melded strong theatrical influences with piano- based rock. His songs reflected the views of their character-narrators, many of whom were societal outcasts. In this way he presaged many of the songs of Bruce Springsteen and Steve Earle. Subway to the Country was given a larger budget. At first he and Al Kooper tried recording the tracks in a \\"stripped- back country-rock style,\\" then classically trained composer Fred Myrow was brought in to arrange and conduct. Twenty-two musicians are credited on the album. Now that Ackles could employ strings, winds, brass, and choruses, his elaborate musical style began to develop. He toured with his songs when he had to, but in spite of his stage experience he was not a showman.Consummate showman Elton John, who greatly admired Ackles's studio work, watched him perform every night during their shared Troubadour gig in 1970. \\"To see the audience just chatting away while he sang those lovely songs just tore me apart.\\" Brend p. 54. His wife recalled that performing live \\"was very difficult for him....I just don't think he was comfortable being up there as David Ackles. If he was asked to go on and sing and play as Oscar Levant, it might have been easier for him. Any theater piece would have been fine. But to be out there just kind of exposing your soul, I think, was extremely difficult.\\" ==American Gothic (1972)== American Gothic, released in 1972, was produced by Elton John's lyricist Bernie Taupin. Taupin and Ackles became acquainted when Ackles was selected to be the opening act for Elton John's 1970 American debut at the Troubadour in Los Angeles. Taupin said of Ackles' style, \\"There was nothing quite like it. It's been said so many times, but his stuff was sort of [like] Brecht and Weill, and theatrical. It was very different than what the other singer-songwriters of the time were doing. There was also a darkness to it, which I really, really loved, because that was the kind of material that I was drawn to.\\"Unterberger, Richie (2000). Liner notes for 2000 reissue of Subway to the Country. Richie Unterberger Though the album was recorded and mixed in about two weeks, Ackles worked for two years on its conception and \\"immensely complex\\" orchestral arrangements. Of Ackles' four albums, it was the only one recorded in England rather than in America. He used musicians from the London Symphony and a Salvation Army band chorus (\\"'The only trouble is, it's not the same as the American Salvation Army, so they were elongating all their a's, and he kept saying, \\"No no no, you've got to get rid of that accent\\"'\\").Unterberger, Richie (2000). Liner notes for 2000 reissue of American Gothic. Richie Unterberger Elektra gave Ackles his biggest budget to date to complete the project and advertised it pre-release as \\"The Album of the Year.\\"Advertisement image. Excerpts from reviews of American Gothic (1972) SuperSeventies Elektra sent a pre-release copy to Chris Van Ness, the music editor of Los Angeles Free Press, who wrote an enthusiast review comparing it to Sgt. Pepper. Elektra then sent a copy of the review to the press, whose reviews, including the Sgt. Pepper comparison, followed the lines of Van Ness's original. Melody Maker called it a classic and British music critic Derek Jewell of The Sunday Times described it as \\"the Sgt. Pepper of folk.\\" But sales were again disappointing; it reached only #167 on the US charts.Ruhlmann, William (1995). The All-Music Guide to Rock. Excerpts from reviews of American Gothic (1972) SuperSeventies And Ackles himself felt he couldn't agree with Van Ness's \\"comparison to Sgt. Pepper\\" and his \\"overpraising\\". ==Later career== After three albums for Elektra, Ackles left the label. He was signed to CBS/Columbia Records by legendary record executive Clive Davis, then president of the company and a long-time Ackles admirer. As he tried to create his first album for Columbia he felt the pressure of expectations engendered by American Gothic's glowing reviews. All too aware that his last album had been called \\"a milestone in pop and a study in excellence\\" and \\"a new direction in pop music\\" and himself \\"'an important artist whose work eludes categorisation,'\\" Ackles began to second-guess himself. \\"[E]very idea he came up with he discarded, thinking, 'This is not as good as American Gothic.'\\"Ackles said later, \\"It got outrageous and undeserved praise, praise which put it in the category of being just impossible to follow up.\\" \\"American Gothic — The Road to David Ackles.\\" August 1998. Terrascope Online He withdrew from the recording studio and produced Five and Dime at home on a four-track recorder. Uncharacteristically he brought in \\"a modest and simple record\\" on time and under budget. But before Five and Dime was released, Clive Davis was abruptly dismissed by CBS over an expenses dispute. With the loss of the only executive who had championed it, the new Ackles album fared poorly. It was perfunctorily released—the same month Davis was—only in the US, and Columbia would not finance a tour to promote it. Columbia did not renew his contract and Ackles, hurt and frustrated, did not search for another record deal. ==Personal life== After leaving Columbia Records in 1973, Ackles concentrated on fulfilling his publishing contract with Warner Bros., writing songs to order for the company's artists. As had been the case in Ackles's early Elektra days, none of the songs were recorded by the artists to whom they were pitched. He worked on musical theater and screenplays from the home base he shared with his wife and son, a six-acre horse farm in Tujunga, near Los Angeles. He sold some screenplays to television; one that was broadcast was Word of Honor (1981) starring Karl Malden and Ron Silver. In 1981, his car was hit by a drunk driver. Ackles's left arm was nearly severed and his left thighbone \\"virtually pushed out through his back.\\" He remembered his wife \\"standing outside the operating theater, shouting, 'Don't cut off his arm! He's a piano player!'\\" He spent six months in a wheelchair, eventually receiving a steel hip. Though by 1984 he was able to play piano for short periods, his arm's nerves never recovered, and he \\"may have been in considerable pain for the rest of his life.\\" In the 1980s he returned to USC, first in administration, then teaching musical theater. At USC in 1997 he directed productions of Good News and The Threepenny Opera,Parker, Andrea. \\"A heart-to-heart with USC play director.\\" USC School of Theatre First published in The Daily Trojan April 10, 1997. and in the 1990s completed Sister Aimee, a musical based on the life of Aimee Semple McPherson, which was performed in Los Angeles in 1995 and in Chicago in 2004. He and Rob Dickins of Warner Music UK discussed recording Sister Aimee. He was the executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Society of Fund-Raising Executives (now the National Association of Fundraising Professionals) and was a part of the Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop in Los Angeles (now the Academy of New Musical Theatre). Ackles died of lung cancer on March 2, 1999, at the age of 62. ==Legacy== When Elvis Costello was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003, he cited Ackles in his speech as one of his major influences. In the November 2000 issue of Vanity Fair magazine, Costello identified two of Ackles's albums among his \\"500 Greatest Albums Ever,\\" describing Ackles as \\"perhaps the greatest unheralded songwriter of the late 60s.\\" When Phil Collins was on the British BBC radio show Desert Island Discs, he selected Ackles's song \\"Down River\\" as one of his eight all-time favorite songs. He said of Ackles: \\"He taught me that writing songs didn’t have to be moon/spoon/June. That you could write intelligently about more serious subjects.\\"\\"American Gothic — The Road to David Ackles.\\" August 1998. Terrascope Online Elton John and Elvis Costello—two of Ackles's most fervent admirers—chose \\"Down River\\" to perform as their first-ever duet together for the finale of the premiere episode of Costello's TV series Spectacle: Elvis Costello with....Spectacle: Elvis Costello With... Elton John. Season 1, Episode 1. The Sundance Channel Interviewed in 1990 for the booklet accompanying his To Be Continued retrospective box-set, Elton John recalled his incredulity when he discovered that Ackles had been selected to be his co-headlining opening act for his American debut at the Troubadour club in Los Angeles in August 1970. \\"I could not believe that I was on the same stage with someone like David Ackles who opened for me at the Troubadour. David Ackles was one of my heroes.\\"Buckley, David (2007). Elton: The Biography. Chicago: Chicago Review Press, p. 106. Google Books At the Troubadour John made a point of watching Ackles play every night. He was \\"flabbergasted\\" to discover that Ackles was far better known in England than in the United States, or even L.A. He dedicated 1970's Tumbleweed Connection to Ackles with the line, \\"to David with love.\\" Almost thirty years later, though Ackles had not recorded since 1973, John said, \\"He's one of the best America has to offer.\\" Ackles's songs were occasionally covered. In 1968, Julie Driscoll & the Brian Auger Trinity had a minor UK hit with Ackles's song \\"Road to Cairo.\\" This song was also covered by Howard Jones in 1990 on Elektra Records' compilation Rubáiyát. Martin Carthy covered one of his songs, \\"His Name is Andrew,\\" on his 1971 album Landfall, and Spooky Tooth's 1970 album The Last Puff included their version of \\"Down River,\\" which the Hollies also covered in 1972 on their album Romany. His first three albums were reissued in 1994 and again in 2000. The 1994 Elektra reissues generated modest sales and a number of praise-filled articles, which raised hopes that Ackles was on the verge of a new career as a rediscovered cult favorite. Not long before his death in 1999, there was a resurgence of interest in the UK. After his death, there were obituaries in several major British newspapers that eulogized Ackles's talent.Mathieson, Brian. Obituary: David Ackles.

The band quickly established itself as a major presence within the UK's metal scene. Raging Speedhorn featured two vocalists, a style largely inspired by the UK hardcore band Hard to Swallow, (which featured Bloody Kev who would join Raging Speedhorn as their second vocalist after the departure of Frank Regan in 2005). The band's first single, \\"Thumper\\" (produced by industrial veteran, Marc Heal) was released in 2000 to significant critical acclaim. In 2001 they charted in the UK Singles Chart with \\"The Gush\\". On early Raging Speedhorn recordings the music can be characterised by pounding basslines, heavily distorted riff-thick guitarwork and subject content consisting generally (but certainly not exclusively) of hedonism, drug-use, violence, antipathy for major band labels and depression. Before The Sea Was Built was the only album the band produced with Larry Hibbitt, of Hundred Reasons. It was released on 11 September 2007 through Steamhammer, a subsidiary of SPV Records. On 25 March 2008, it was announced the band would split after a final tour. Members joined other bands elsewhere, including Cardiff, Wales and Stockholm, Sweden. John Loughlin, Jay Thompson and Dave Thompson were in metal band, The Death Of Us as of 2013. On 18 February 2014 it was announced that the band would reform to perform at Damnation Festival in November 2014. Both John Loughlin and Frank Regan would feature on vocals, with the band showcasing tracks from their debut and sophomore albums. The band have also been confirmed to play the UK leg of the 2014 Sonisphere festival. On 3 July 2014, the band played a sold-out hometown show with support from The Darkhorse and Heart of a Coward as a warm-up prior to playing at Sonisphere two days later. On 7 July 2014, an eleven-date UK tour was announced. In January 2016 the band recorded their new full-length record, Lost Ritual, with Russ Russell at the Parlour Studios, Kettering. On 14 September 2018 it was announced that guitarists Jim Palmer and Jamie Thompson had left the band. On 6 October 2018 the band performed a 20th Anniversary show at the Electric Ballroom, London with the original lineup; John Loughlin, Frank Regan, Gordon Morison, Tony Loughlin, Gareth Smith & Darren Smith. On 19 December 2018 it was announced that James Palmer and Dave Leese had joined the band on guitars. It was announced on 3 September 2019 that Daniel Cook would be replacing John Loughlin after 21 years. ==Current line-up== *Daniel Cook - vocals *Frank Regan - vocals *James Palmer - guitar *Dave Leese - guitar *Andy Gilmour - bass *Gordon Morison - drums ==Tours== * UK Tour with earthtone9 in 1999 * UK Tour with Will Haven and Skindred in 1999 * UK Tour with Tribute To Nothing and Charger in 2000 * UK Tour with Medulla Nocte in 2000 * UK dates with Kittie in 2000 * UK Headline Tour with Brutal Deluxe and Defenestration in 2000 * Europe Tour with Biohazard and Nucleus in 2000 * Europe Tour with Amen in 2000 * UK Headline Tour with Charger and Vex Red in 2001 * Europe Tour with Mudvayne in 2001 * Japanese Tour with Amen in 2001 * Europe dates with Slipknot in 2001 * Ozzfest in the UK in 2001 * UK Headline Tour with Misdemeanor and Scurge in 2001 * \\"Tattoo The Planet\\" UK dates with Slayer, Pantera, Cradle Of Filth and more in 2001 * UK Headline Tour with Candiria and Clutch in 2002 * Summer Sonic Festival in Japan in 2002 * Scandinavia Tour in 2002 * Japanese Tour in 2002 * UK Tour supporting Rammstein in 2002 * Joint headline UK Tour with Ill Niño in 2002 * Europe Headline Tour in 2003 * Download Festival in the UK in 2003 and 2005 * With Full Force in Germany in 2003 and 2005 * UK Headline Tour with Johnny Truant in 2005 * US Tour with Nile, Hypocrisy, Soilent Green and more in 2006 * Europe Tour with Twelve Tribes and Bridge To Solace in 2007 * UK Headline Tour with Shaped by Fate in 2007 * UK shows supporting Dir en grey in 2007 * Europe Tour with Carnivore in 2007 * Scandinavian Tour with Victims in 2008 * Final European Headline Tour with My City Burning in 2008 * Final UK and Ireland Headline tour with Take A Worm For A Walk Week and The Mirimar Disaster in 2008 * Final Japanese Tour with Palm in 2008 * Reunion show at Corby Zombie Hut Corby in July 2014 * Two sets at Sonisphere Festival in 2014 (Jägermeister stage and VIP backstage show) * Damnation festival 2014 * Reunion Tour - UK 2014 * Hammer fest 2015 * Bloodstock 2015. * Will Haven tour May 2015. * UK winter tour 2015. * 2016 UK Tour with Stoneghost and By Any Means *2019 UK Tour supporting Phillip H Anselmo and the Illegals ==Studio Albums== *Raging Speedhorn (2000) *We Will Be Dead Tomorrow (2002) *How the Great Have Fallen (2005) *Before the Sea Was Built (2007) *Lost Ritual (2016) *Hard To Kill (2020) ==Live Albums== *Live and Demos (2004) *20 Year Anniversary Show (2018) ==References== ==External links== * Official site Category:British nu metal musical groups Category:English heavy metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1998 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2008 Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2014 Category:Sludge metal musical groups ","title":"Raging Speedhorn"},{"id":"2579759","text":"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia may refer to: * Precursor T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, a form of lymphoid leukemia and lymphoma * Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, a rare cancer of the immune system's own T-cells ","title":"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia"},{"id":"2579760","text":"Esplanade most commonly refers to a raised walkway.

He took 309 Test wickets, only the second player (after Fred Trueman) to pass 300, the first spinner to pass that milestone, and had an exceptional economy rate of under two runs per over. In 2009, Gibbs was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. ==Biography== Gibbs made his first-class debut in 1953–54, playing for British Guiana against MCC at his home ground of Bourda. In MCC's first (and indeed only) innings, he bowled Denis Compton for 18 to leave the tourists precariously poised at 51/3. Gibbs also took the wicket of Tom Graveney – but by then a mammoth fourth-wicket partnership of 402 between Graveney and Willie Watson had propelled MCC towards an innings victory, so Gibbs did not get a second chance to bowl. Gibbs played a few more first-class games for British Guiana over the next few years, and some good performances (including 4/68 in the final of the Quadrangular Tournament against Barbados in 1956–57) gained him selection for the West Indies side to host Pakistan the following season. He made his debut in the second Test at Port-of-Spain, taking four wickets in the match, and retained his place for the rest of the five-match series, his first five-wicket haul in first-class cricket coming when he claimed 5/80 in the fourth Test at Bourda. He went on the tour to India in 1957–58, but played in only one Test, in which he went wicketless. The tour of Pakistan that immediately followed was a little more fruitful, with eight wickets in three games. However, it was the 1960–61 tour of Australia that was to prove a turning point in Gibbs' international career: he played only in the last three Tests, but took 19 wickets at 20.78: eight at Sydney, five at Adelaide (including a hat-trick) and six at Melbourne. The early 1960s were Gibbs' most productive period in Test cricket, and his greatest achievements came in the 1961–62 home series against India. Over the course of five Tests he picked up 24 wickets at just 20.41 apiece, including one of the game's greatest spells of bowling at Bridgetown, where he single- handedly reduced the Indians from 149/2 to 187 all out with eight wickets in 15.3 overs at a total cost of just six runs; Gibbs' final innings return of 8/38 was his best in a Test match. In 1963, West Indies toured England, and Gibbs had another highly successful series, taking 26 wickets at 21.30 including 5/59 and 6/98 in a ten-wicket triumph at Manchester. Further successful series followed: indeed, in eight successive series topped and tailed by the 1960–61 and 1968–69 tours to Australia, Gibbs never took fewer than 18 Test wickets and took five or more wickets in an innings on 12 occasions. In 1967, Gibbs played for Warwickshire in the English County Championship, for whom he would continue to appear each season until 1973, although his appearances in 1969 and 1973 were reduced because of his commitments with West Indies' tours of England. In 1970, after a winter spent with South Australia, he took a career-best 8/37 against Glamorgan, but by far his most successful season in England was 1971 in which Gibbs claimed 131 first-class wickets at only 18.89, with nine five-wicket hauls. This exceptional performance gained Gibbs a Wisden Cricketer of the Year award in the following year's Almanack. He has been retrospectively ranked by the ICC as the top bowler in Test cricket for five consecutive years starting from 1964. In 1973, at the age of almost 39, Gibbs made his One Day International debut against England at Leeds as part of the Prudential Trophy tournament, taking the wicket of England captain Mike Denness. He played only two further ODIs: the first again being against England two days later at the Oval (11–4–12–1 and the wicket of John Jameson), and a single outing against Sri Lanka at Manchester in the 1975 World Cup, in which he bowled just four overs without success. Gibbs' last Test matches were played on the tour of Australia in 1975–76. Although he played in all six Tests, and took 5/102 in the first innings of the first Test at Brisbane, his 16 wickets came at an average of over 40, the worst of his five series against these opponents. He passed the milestone of 300 Test victims at Perth by dismissing Gary Gilmour. His last Test match, and indeed his last appearance in senior cricket of any description, was at Melbourne, his 309th and final Test wicket being that – again – of Gilmour. He was, however, a very poor batsman, who never made a half-century in first-class cricket. After his retirement from the game, Gibbs emigrated to the United States, but returned to prominence briefly in 1991 when he managed West Indies' tour to England. Gibbs is involved with the Lawrence Rowe Foundation, which helps at-risk kids. Gibbs is the cousin of another West Indies cricketer, Clive Lloyd, with whom he appeared for West Indies on a number of occasions. ==Record== Gibbs is the oldest player to reach 300 Test wickets, doing so at the age of 41 in 1975/76http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/638762.html. == References == ==External links== * Category:West Indies Test cricketers Category:West Indies One Day International cricketers Category:Guyanese cricketers Category:Demerara cricketers Category:South Australia cricketers Category:Warwickshire cricketers Category:Guyana cricketers Category:Commonwealth XI cricketers Category:International Cavaliers cricketers Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:Test cricket hat- trick takers Category:Cricketers at the 1975 Cricket World Cup Category:World Series Cricket players Category:1934 births Category:Living people Category:Afro-Guyanese people Category:Sportspeople from Georgetown, Guyana ","title":"Lance Gibbs"},{"id":"2579765","text":"Yesü Möngke (died 1252) was head of the ulus of the Chagatai Khanate (1246 or 1247-1252).

KBPA broadcasts in HD Radio; its second subchannel broadcasts a rhythmic contemporary format as Mega 103-5 HD2. ==History== ===Rock and adult contemporary=== The station signed on the air on June 1, 1971 at 103.7 FM as KRMH. The station was known as \\"Good Karma\\", a suitable name for a progressive rock station on the fringe of Austin (\\"Broadcasting from beautiful downtown Buda!\\") in its \\"Hippy-Dippy\\" age. It was licensed to San Marcos on 103.7 MHz. KRMH was owned by, and named for, Advance Inc., whose president was R. Miller Hicks. The station was one of the few to broadcast in quadraphonic stereo. In 1976, the Pioneer Broadcasting Company of Austin, which also owned 1490 AM KNOW, acquired KRMH and shifted it to an adult contemporary sound as KCSW; the call letters changed on July 26, 1976. Five years later, the station was acquired by Hicks Communications Inc. of Dallas; upon closing, KCSW changed its call letters to KEYI and rebranded as Key 103, keeping the adult contemporary format. In 1983, the station moved from 103.7 FM to 103.5 FM with a power increase to 100,000 watts. Hicks sold the station to Degree Communications for $15.5 million in 1988; the limited partnership restructured, giving GE Capital control, three years later. That transaction amounted to receivership; a year later, KEYI was sold to San Antonio businessman Van Archer, doing business as Mercury Broadcasting, for $3 million. ===Oldies 103=== KEYI moved to oldies as \\"Oldies 103\\" in 1994 in the wake of Austin's oldies station, KFGI-FM, flipping to hot adult contemporary. Two years later, Clear Channel Communications bought KEYI and KFON AM for $3.1 million. Clear Channel attempted to sell KEYI and 44 other stations, in divestiture action spurred by its merger with AMFM, to Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation in a 2000 deal that was scuttled when the United States Department of Justice denied it over equity ties between Clear Channel and HBC; Clear Channel then sold KEYI to Secret Communications. Secret owned KEYI less than a year before selling it in 2001 to LBJS Broadcasting Company, a partnership of the LBJ Company and Sinclair Telecable (no relation to Sinclair Broadcast Group). LBJ would exit radio after six decades by selling its majority interest in the partnership to Emmis Communications in 2004, a $105 million purchase. The new partnership was named Emmis Austin Radio Broadcasting Co., LP. ===Bob FM=== In September 2004, KEYI-FM flipped to adult hits as \\"Bob FM\\", changing its call letters to KBPA on September 8. Sinclair Telecable acquired Emmis's stake in its Austin radio stations in June 2019 for $39.3 million. The FCC approved the transaction, requiring a waiver since it maintained a grandfathered cluster not permissible under current radio ownership rules. In early 2019, Emmis filed with the Federal Communications Commission to relocate the KBPA transmitter site and city of license to Austin proper and decrease power slightly. The move is part of a multi-station allocation shuffle being led by the Educational Media Foundation and will allow EMF to add a signal serving the core of San Antonio on 103.7 MHz; the FCC approved the changes in January 2020. ==HD Radio== In 2009, KBPA brought back KXMG's former Dance Top 40 format and placed it on its HD2 channel, calling it \\"Mega 103-5 HD-2\\". In 2010 the format returned to the terrestrial broadcasting airwaves as a simulcast, broadcasting on translator K288FJ at 105.5 FM in Bastrop, Texas. In November 2010 the HD2 signal began simulcasting over the air on 102.7 (K274AX), which is licensed to Austin and can be heard within the central business area. That simulcast ended on December 13, 2010 at 12:06am, with the translator going silent. At around 9am that day K274AX switched to a simulcast of adult album alternative-formatted KGSR 93.3 FM Cedar Park, Texas. ==References== ==External links== * BPA-FM Category:Adult hits radio stations in the United States Category:Bob FM stations Category:Emmis Communications radio stations Category:Radio stations established in 1971 Category:1971 establishments in Texas ","title":"KBPA"},{"id":"2579770","text":"Dulo may refer to: *Dulo clan (or House of Dulo), from which descended the earliest Bulgarian Dynasty *Dulo, Mandara, the capital of the historical Mandara kingdom in what is now Cameroon == See also == * Dolo (disambiguation) * Jennifer Dulos * Dulu (disambiguation) ","title":"Dulo (disambiguation)"},{"id":"2579774","text":"South Penrith is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia.

Hoffmann was the eldest of nine children born into a family of strict Roman Catholics. Her father was a prosperous attorney, and her parents were stalwart supporters of the Army–McCarthy hearings held to expose Communist government infiltration. The Hoffmann children were required to watch the televised proceedings. Raised in devout Catholicism, she considered becoming a nun. Viva began her career in entertainment as a model and painter. She retired from both professions however, claiming that she believed painting to be a dead medium, and describing her time as a model as \\"...a period of my life I would rather forget.\\"\\"Viva Viva Viva\\".

She appeared in several of Warhol's films and was a frequent guest at the Factory. Viva's film career began in 1967, when she began filming Ciao! Manhattan, which was not completed until 1972. Viva approached Andy Warhol about being in one of his films, on the suggestion of her friend, actress Abigail Rosen McGrath. Warhol agreed, but only on the condition that Viva take off her blouse for the role. Viva responded by adhering bandaids to her breasts and visiting Andy at The Factory. Viva appeared in many of Warhol's films. The first, Tub Girls, consists of Viva lying in a bathtub with various people of both sexes, including Brigid Berlin and Rosen McGrath.Tub Girls, IMDb.com, August 2015. She appeared in Bike Boy, a film centered around a motorcyclist trying to find himself;\\"'Bike Boy' Opens at the Hudson Theater\\", The New York Times, October 6, 1967, pg. 31 and The Nude Restaurant, in which she played a waitress, opposite Taylor Mead.Viva Hoffman. \\"Warhol Superstar Viva Remembers Andy, His Mother & The Artist's Early Brush With Death\\", Bio.com, August 11, 2015.

Viva played opposite Louis Waldon. The film consists of improvised dialogue between Viva and Waldon about a multitude of topics, including The Vietnam War, President Nixon, and various mundane tasks. These conversations are interrupted by the main event of the film, in which Viva and Waldon actually perform sexual acts in front of the camera. The film was seized by New York City Police for obscenity, and the theater manager, projectionist, and ticket-seller at the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre arrested for possession of obscene materials.

Viva never saw Mrs. Warhola again after that. Viva's first starring role in a non-Warhol film was in Agnès Varda's Lions Love in 1969.

White settlement began in the area in the early 19th century. Smithfield was originally known as Chilsholm's Bush. In 1803, homeless children were becoming a problem after convicts turned their children out into the streets. As a consequence, Governor Philip Gidley King, put aside a large area of for a Male Orphan School. By 1836, some of this land was offered for sale by the colonial government of the time. John Ryan Brenan (1798–1868), an attorney who was appointed Police Magistrate in 1836, bought here. Early settlers were attracted to Smithfield by its good soil, dependable water supply and easy access to the Colony's established towns. Some of the best farming land was in the district to the west and southwest of the Smithfield area. In 1867, Smithfield was a semi-rural settlement populated by vine growers, gardeners, wood timber cutters, orchards and tanneries. Brenan planned to make money with a meat market and a cattle sale yard. He subdivided the estate and named it Smithfield after the meat markets of London and Dublin. Saleyards opened in 1841 but the project to establish a village around the yards failed. Despite this, Smithfield did become a thriving commercial centre and remains a significant employment centre in south-western Sydney as part of the Wetherill Park/Yennora industrial block. Smithfield still has the street patterns Brenan planned and the street names he chose. In the subdivision, Brenan offered an extra adjoining allotment to any buyer who built a cottage with a brick chimney and enclosed the property with a fence. The public school opened in 1850 and by the 1880s Smithfield was well provided with churches, many of which still remain today as important relics of Smithfield's rich local heritage. ==Transport== The Horsley Drive is the major road that runs through Smithfield.

It plays a central role in the complement system and contributes to innate immunity. In humans it is encoded on chromosome 19 by a gene called C3. == Function == C3 plays a central role in the activation of the complement system. Its activation is required for both classical and alternative complement activation pathways. People with C3 deficiency are susceptible to bacterial infection. One form of C3-convertase, also known as C4b2a, is formed by a heterodimer of activated forms of C4 and C2. It catalyzes the proteolytic cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b, generated during activation through the classical pathway as well as the lectin pathway. C3a is an anaphylotoxin and the precursor of some cytokines such as ASP, and C3b serves as an opsonizing agent. Factor I can cleave C3b into C3c and C3d, the latter of which plays a role in enhancing B cell responses. In the alternative complement pathway, C3 is cleaved by C3bBb, another form of C3-convertase composed of activated forms of C3 (C3b) and factor B (Bb). Once C3 is activated to C3b, it exposes a reactive thioester that allows the peptide to covalently attach to any surface that can provide a nucleophile such as a primary amine or a hydroxyl group. Activated C3 can then interact with factor B. Factor B is then activated by factor D, to form Bb. The resultant complex, C3bBb, is called the alternative pathway (AP) C3 convertase. C3bBb is deactivated in steps. First, the proteolytic component of the convertase, Bb, is removed by complement regulatory proteins having decay-accelerating factor (DAF) activity. Next, C3b is broken down progressively to first iC3b, then C3c + C3dg, and then finally C3d. Factor I is the protease that performs these cuts but it requires the help of another protein (Factor H, CR1, MCP or C4BP) to supply cofactor activity. == Structure == Several crystallographic structures of C3 have been determined and reveal that this protein contains 13 domains. == Biochemistry == === Biosynthesis === In humans, C3 is predominantly synthesised by liver hepatocytes and to some degree by epidermis keratinocytes. == Clinical use == Levels of C3 in the blood may be measured to support or refute a particular medical diagnosis. For example, low C3 levels are associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=167&contentid;=complement_c3_blood and some types of kidney disease such as post-infectious glomerulonephritis, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and shunt nephritis. .c3 may be lost in urine in nephrotic syndrome == Interactions == Complement component 3 has been shown to interact with Factor H. ==Pathology== Deficiencies in C3 lead to genetic infections, usually fatal to the newborn. == References == == Further reading == * == External links == * GeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Atypical Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome * OMIM entries on Atypical Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome * GeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Dense Deposit Disease/Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis Type II * * Category:Complement system ","title":"Complement component 3"},{"id":"2579839","text":"The Asciburgius mons or Askibourgion oros is a mountain of greater Germany mentioned by the ancient geographer, Ptolemy, of unknown location today.

Though a Midwesterner, Sandburg and his family moved to this home in 1945 for the peace and solitude required for his writing and the more than of pastureland required for his wife, Lilian, to raise her champion dairy goats. Sandburg spent the last twenty-two years of his life on this farm and published more than a third of his works while he resided here. The 264-acre site includes the Sandburg residence, the goat farm, sheds, rolling pastures, mountainside woods, 5 miles (8 km) of hiking trails on moderate to steep terrain, two small lakes, several ponds, flower and vegetable gardens, and an apple orchard. Visitors to the site can tour the Sandburg residence and visit the dairy barn housing Connemara Farms' goat herd, representing the three breeds of goats Lilian Sandburg raised. From mid-June until mid-August, live performances of Sandburg's Rootabaga Stories and excerpts from the Broadway play, The World of Carl Sandburg, are presented at the park amphitheater. ==The Memminger years== In the middle 1830s Christopher Memminger, of Charleston, South Carolina, took a tour of Flat Rock in an attempt to find a summer home. Unable to find a home he liked, he purchased land from Charles Baring, one of the more prominent land holders in the area. In 1838 he hired an architect to begin work on a large summer home in the Greek-Revival-style. The kitchen house and stable were actually completed first in the summer of 1838. The house was not complete until 1839. A cook's house was added in 1841, a wagon shed in 1843, and an icehouse in 1845. An addition to the main house was constructed over the course of 1846-1849, and servant quarters were built in 1850.Galen Reuther. The Carl Sandburg Home: Connemara, (Charleston, Chicago, Portsmouth, San Francisco: Arcadia Publishing, 2006), 7-9. Memminger called his summer home “Rock Hill,” possibly because the main house was constructed on the gradual slope of Big Glassy Mountain. In 1855, he had a stream in front of the house dammed up to create a small, artificial lake. The Memminger family spent most of their summers after 1839 at Rock Hill, not to be confused with Rock Hill, South Carolina. They lived there full-time from 1864 until the end of the Civil War. During the war, the house was fortified and used as a shelter for friends who needed protection from raids by Union soldiers and Confederate deserters turned bandits.Ibid. 9. ==The Gregg and Smyth years== After Memminger's death, his son Edward sold Rock Hill to Colonel William Gregg, Jr., a Confederate veteran. During his ownership, he built new steps at the front of the house, since the originals had been removed during the war for defense. He also installed a bay window and fireplace mantles. The Greggs used Rock Hill as their summer home for about ten years before they sold it in 1900 to Captain Ellison Adger Smyth.Ibid. 21. Smyth changed the name of the house from “Rock Hill” to “Connemara,” after his ancestral district in Ireland.David H. Wallace, Historic Furnishings Report: Carl Sandburg Home Main House and Swedish House: National Historic Site / North Carolina, (Frederick, Maryland: 1984), 6. The Smyths winterized the house and enclosed the porch to convert it to a dining room.Elena Miller Park Ranger and Louise Williamson volunteer, interview by author, 9 February 2007, Flat Rock, tour of Carl Sandburg Home National Historic site. They also painted the house green for a brief period and even installed an eight-hole golf course in the pastures. The captain and his family used Connemara as a summer home until 1925 when they decided to make it their permanent residence. Smyth died in 1942, and the house remained vacant until 1945. ==The Sandburg era== Sandburg purchased Connemara on October 18, 1945 for $45,000 . Mrs. Sandburg had been looking for a new farm in a warmer climate to raise her Chikaming dairy goats. When she showed Connemara to her husband, he reportedly said, “This is the place. We will look no further.”Reuther, Connemara, 41 Upon buying the house, the Sandburgs immediately began remodeling. Contractors were hired to work on the heating, plumbing, electrical, the roof and the cement floor of the basement. The Sandburgs installed new chimneys and bathrooms, as well as dozens of bookshelves for his large library. They also repainted the house and installed a new indoor kitchen, having turned the original kitchen building into a three- car garage. The entire remodeling process lasted for some two and a half years. In addition, more than of personal belongings, primarily Sandburg's library, were sent by train from their old house in Harbert, Michigan.Wallace, Furnishings Report, 8-19. The Sandburgs lived at Connemara from October 1945 to July 1969. Mr. and Mrs. Sandburg lived there along with their three daughters, Margaret, Janet, and Helga, as well as Helga's two children, John Carl and Karlen Paula. Sandburg published more than a third of his works while living at Connemara, and it was at this house he died of natural causes in 1967. After his death, his wife decided to sell Connemara to the U.S. government to preserve the house as a memorial to her husband. The Secretary of Interior and family friend Stewart Udall visited the house in October 1967, and Mrs. Sandburg signed a deed of gift in June of the following year. On October 18, 1968, President Johnson approved a congressional act making the home a historic site. The home officially opened to the public in 1974. The National Park Service restored the house and installed Plexiglas covers over the bookcases during the time between the purchase and its opening.Ibid. 20-26. ==The site today== Today Carl Sandburg Home National Historic site attracts more than 85,000 visitors a year.

Article 3 of the Organic Charter lists the objectives of this Institution: “The bank aims to promote, to the extent of its powers and within the framework of the policies established by the national government, monetary stability, financial stability, employment and economic development with social equity.” ==Establishment== Established by six Acts of Congress enacted on May 28, 1935, the bank replaced Argentina's currency board, which had been in operation since 1899. Its first president was Ernesto Bosch, who served in that capacity from 1935 to 1945. The Central Bank's headquarters on San Martín Street (in the heart of Buenos Aires' financial district, known locally as the city), was originally designed in 1872 by architects Henry Hunt and Hans Schroeder. Completed in 1876, the Italian Renaissance-inspired building initially housed the Mortgage Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires. The Central Bank's offices were transferred to an adjacent address upon its establishment, and were expanded to their present size by the purchase of the Mortgage Bank building in 1940, as well as by the construction of a twin building behind it. Drawing from a 1933 study on Argentine finance by Bank of England director Sir Otto Niemeyer, the institution's charter was drafted by Argentine economist Raúl Prebisch; Prebisch would serve as general manager until 1943. The Central Bank was a private entity during its first decade, and British Empire interests held a majority stake; the president of the Central Bank was appointed by the president of Argentina, but 11 of its 12 directors were private bank CEOs. Pursuant to the Roca–Runciman Treaty of 1933, Central Bank reserves accrued from Argentine trade surpluses with the United Kingdom were deposited in escrow at the Bank of England, and this clause, which had led to nearly US$1 billion in inaccessible reserves (more than half the total) by 1945, prompted the BCRA's nationalization by order of Juan Perón on March 24, 1946.Lewis, Paul. The Crisis of Argentine Capitalism. University of North Carolina Press, 1990. ==Modern history== Normally subordinate to the Economy Ministry in matters of policy, the Central Bank took a more prominent role during the Latin American debt crisis when, in April 1980, it enacted Circular 1050. This measure, enacted to shield the financial sector from the cost of receiving payments in suddenly devalued pesos, bankrupted thousands of homeowners and businesses by indexing mortgages to the value of the US dollar locally, which had risen around fifteenfold by July 1982 when Central Bank President Domingo Cavallo rescinded the policy. During the years of Cavallo's Convertibility Law, which established a 1:1 fixed exchange rate between the Argentine peso and the United States dollar on April 1, 1991, the BCRA was mainly in charge of keeping foreign currency reserves in synch with the monetary base. The policy deprived the Central Bank of exchange-rate flexibility, however, and ended at the depth of a record economic crisis a decade later. The repeal of the Convertibility Law in January 2002 was accompanied by a 70% devaluation and depreciation of the peso to nearly 4 pesos, and the Central Bank's role afterward was the accumulation of reserves in order to gain a measure of control of the exchange rate. The BCRA buys and sells dollars from the market as needed to absorb large foreign trade surpluses and keep the official exchange rate at internationally competitive levels for Argentine exports and to encourage import substitution. As part of a wider debt restructuring effort that brought Argentina out of its default three years earlier, in December 2005 President Néstor Kirchner announced the payment of Argentina's IMF debts in a single, anticipated disbursement. The payment was effected on January 3, 2006, employing about US$9.8 billion from BCRA reserves. This decreased the amount of reserves by one third, but did not cause adverse monetary effects, save from an increased reliance on the local bond market, which requires somewhat higher interest rates. The Central Bank's Reconquista Street entrance, built in 1940 in imitation of its older, opposite entrance. The BCRA continued to intervene in the exchange market, usually buying dollars, though occasionally selling small amounts (for example, reacting to rumors of a possible increase of the Federal Reserve's reference rate, which caused a minor spike in the dollar's value). Its reserves reached US$28 billion in September 2006, recovering the levels prior to the IMF payment, and rose to US$32 billion at the close of the year. The exchange rate was maintained relatively undervalued, prompted by the BCRA's market intervention as a buyer. While fiscal policy remained fairly tight, monetary policy was highly expansionary with growth in Argentina's money supply of over 23% annually from 2003 to 2007. Citing its disapproval of this policy, the influential Global Finance magazine gave Martín Redrado, President of the Central Bank, a D grade in its October 2006 survey of global central bankers. The magazine held that Redrado \\"missed the opportunity to act to curb inflation when the economy was expanding at its fastest, with inflation expected to reach 12% in 2006, up from 7.7% in 2005 and 4.4% in 2004.\\" Price controls helped keep inflation that year to 9.8%, though the public's perception of it was higher due to the sample composition used to measure the index; differences between official and private inflation estimates widened dramatically from 2007 onward. The BCRA, however, obtained exceptionally high returns on investment funded by its reserves, for a total of US$1.4 billion (a yearly rate of 5.7%) in 2006, and continued to do so in subsequent years. Fallout from the 2008 financial crisis later forced President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's administration to seek domestic financing for growing public spending, as well as for foreign debt service obligations; her administration, like many of her predecessors, has used the nominally independent Central Bank to prop up government finances and to support political goals. The president ordered a US$6.7 billion account opened at the Central Bank for the latter purpose in December 2009, implying the use of the Central Bank's foreign exchange reserves, and drawing direct opposition from Redrado. He was dismissed by presidential decree on January 7, 2010, prior to which Economy Minister Amado Boudou had announced that Mario Blejer (who had expressed support for the measure) would be appointed in his stead. Following an impasse, Redrado was ultimately replaced by Mercedes Marcó del Pont, President of the National Bank of Argentina, on February 3. Redrado's removal triggered a vocal rebuke from opposition figures in Congress, who, citing the need to preserve the Central Bank's nominal autarky, expressed doubts as to the decree's legality. A court injunction blocked Kirchner's planned use of reserves for the retirement of high-interest bonds, a move that could have provided numerous vulture funds (holdouts from the 2005 debt restructuring who had resorted to the courts in a bid for higher returns on their defaulted bonds) a legal argument against the central bank's autarky, and thus make judgement liens against the central bank's overseas accounts possible. The BCRA acquired a greater role as a commercial lender subsequently. The Bicentennial Fund, established in January 2010 as the vehicle for the controversial refinancing plan that led to Redrado's removal, financed fixed investment projects totaling US$2.4 billion in its first two years; a change proposed by President Fernández de Kirchner to the bank's governing statutes would allow it to function as a commercial lender outright. The Argentine Senate approved a reform of the Central Bank charter on 22 March 2012. Under the new regime the government will be free to pay public debt using the Central Bank's reserves. The bank would also be enabled to expand its lending capacity to the Treasury, effectively giving a boost to the government's finances. Marcó del Pont's successor, National Bank President Juan Carlos Fábrega, shifted monetary policy to an anti-inflationary stance during 2014, however, raising the benchmark 3-month note interest rate to over 28%. The rate hike had the effect of reducing Central Bank operating profits, which reached a record US$12 billion in 2014, by up to 90%; but it also absorbed around US$5 billion in liquidity from the economy, and contributed to a reduction in inflation from an estimated 37% in 2014 to around 25%. This policy was largely continued by Fábrega's successor, former National Securities Commission President Alejandro Vanoli. The Central Bank's foreign exchange reserves, which from early 2008 to early 2012 hovered between US$47 billion and US$50 billion, declined by 2014 to less than US$30 billion (an eight-year low) before stabilizing and recovering slightly. This reduction had two major facets: annual current account deficits of US$5 billion brought about by smaller merchandise trade surpluses, growing spending by Argentine tourists abroad, and interest payments on bonds held overseas (foreign debt); and a capital account deficit that reached US$7 billion in 2013 amid a foreign exchange control policy that proved counterproductive and was substantially eased in January 2014. The official exchange rate, which had oscillated around 3 pesos per dollar since early 2003, was adversely impacted by the international 2008 financial crisis, and likewise weakened to 8 pesos per dollar by the first half of 2014. A parallel, \\"blue\\" exchange market - a fixture of Argentine finance in the 1970s and '80s - reemerged when foreign exchange controls were tightened in 2012; it similarly stabilized at around 13 pesos when controls were eased in 2014. One of the first changes to economic policy from the Macri administration, just seven days after Macri had taken office, was to remove the currency controls that had been in place for four consecutive years. The move signified a 30% devaluation of the peso, and was met with both criticism and praise. ==See also== * List of presidents of the Central Bank of Argentina * Argentine peso * Banco Alas * Economy of Argentina ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Economy of Argentina Category:Banks of Argentina Argentina Category:Buildings and structures in Buenos Aires Category:Government buildings in Argentina Category:Government buildings completed in 1876 Category:Government agencies established in 1935 Category:1935 establishments in Argentina ","title":"Central Bank of Argentina"},{"id":"2579981","text":"KOVC (1490 AM) is a radio station based in Valley City, North Dakota, United States.

After about three years of study at the polytechnical school of Stuttgart, Renevier in 1851 went to Geneva to study under F. J. Pictet. In 1854 he went to Paris to attend the lectures of Hébert and to study fossil nummulites found in the limestone of the Alps. From 1859 to 1881 he was an associate professor of geology and mineralogy, then a full professor of geology and paleontology at the Academy in Lausanne (1881–1906). In 1890 the academy attained the name and status of a university. In 1898–90 he was rector of the University of Lausanne. For many years, he also served as curator of the cantonal museum of geology (1874–1906). Dictionnaire historique de la Suisse Renevier, Eugène He is distinguished for his researches on the geology and paleontology of the Alps, on which subjects he published numerous papers in the proceedings of the scientific societies in Switzerland and France. With F. J. Pictet he wrote a memoir on the Fossiles du terrain aptien de la Perte-du-Rhone (1854). In 1894 he was appointed president of the Swiss Geological Commission, and also of the International Geological Congress held that year at Zurich, in the previous meetings of which he had taken a prominent part. He published a noteworthy Tableau des terrains sédimentaires (1874); and a second more elaborate edition, accompanied by an explanatory article Chronographe géologique, was issued in 1897 as a supplement to the Report of the Zurich Congress. This new table was printed on colored sheets, the colors for each geological system corresponding with those adopted on the International geological map of Europe. ==References== Category:1831 births Category:1906 deaths Category:Swiss geologists Category:Swiss paleontologists Category:University of Lausanne faculty Category:People from Lausanne ","title":"Eugène Renevier"},{"id":"2580012","text":"Caiga Quien Caiga (Whoever May Fall), also known as CQC, is an Argentine television show. Under the format of the production company Cuatro Cabezas, CQC has also been adapted in Spain, France, Chile, Italy, Brazil, Portugal and briefly in Israel and the Netherlands. It won an International Emmy for Best Non-Scripted Entertainment in 2010. ==Overview== CQC is a weekly news roundup that takes a humorous and ironic approach to reporting current affairs, show business and sports. CQC's reporters are known for asking politically incorrect questions to celebrities, which in some cases leads to visible discomfort in the interviewees. One of the trademarks of the show is the heavy editing of the interviews to add cartoons and sound effects with the goal of highlighting (by ridicule) the interviewee's reactions. Reporters sometimes give controversial gifts to celebrities. Hosts and reporters all dress in black suits and wear black glasses, inspired by the characters in Quentin Tarantino’s movie Reservoir Dogs. The name of the show in Spanish is a commonly used phrase meaning \\"whatever it takes\\" (literally: \\"whoever might fall\\"), as a reference to the unorthodox interviewing methodology. A recurring segment is \\"Proteste Ya\\" (\\"Protest Now\\"), which involves the people of a certain neighborhood or home area sending an e-mail to an e-mail address especially reserved for \\"Proteste Ya\\", complaining about government negligence in their neighborhood. The CQC journalists then go to that neighborhood, find out about the problem and try to force the person responsible to make a commitment to improve the situation, often taking something from their office as a \\"collateral\\". ==CQC around the world== ===Argentina=== The Argentine edition of CQC was hosted by Mario Pergolini, Eduardo de la Puente and Juan di Natale until 2009. The new anchor is Roberto Pettinato.http://www.eltrecetv.com.ar/cqc-2013/conduccion It started broadcasting in Canal 2 (currently known as América TV), in 1995. This first stage ended in 1999, with a special show transmitted live from the Gran Rex Theatre in Buenos Aires. In 2001, there was a special show (made in the same theatre) to announce the new season of the show for the next year, this time in Canal 13. In 2005, Canal 13 hired Marcelo Tinelli, who is frequently argumented in the programme and has been a longtime rival of Mario Pergolini. This resulted in CQC (and all of the shows produced by Cuatro Cabezas) moving to Telefé. The show went on the air every Monday at 10:30 pm (local hour). On 15 December 2008, Pergolini officially retired from the show . The journalist cast in Canal 2 were Clemente Cancela, Andy Kusnetzoff, Guillermo López, Daniel Malnatti, Gonzalo Rodríguez and Daniel Tognetti. The cast in Canal 13 were Clemente Cancela, Diego Della Salla, Guillermo López, Daniel Malnatti and Gonzalo Rodríguez. ===Chile=== The Chilean edition started broadcasting in 2002, it is currently transmitting in Mega on Sundays at 10:00 pm. The hosts are Nicolás Larrain, Gonzalo Feito and Iván Guerrero. The journalist cast is composed of Sebastian Eyzaguirre, Jean Philippe Cretton and Pamela Le Roy, as well as the hosts Feito and Guerrero. Previously in the show were reporter Marcelo Arismendi, Fernando Lasalvia and hosts Felipe Bianchi and Pablo Mackenna. With the show being broadcast on a Christian channel, they are restricted from talking to people related to the church. The show is produced with the support of the Chilean production company Edu. Some of their most popular memes is El Hombre de Trabajo Trabajo y TrabajoEl hombre de trabajo trabajo trabajo en YouTube con MEGA arriba and Eduardo Bonvallet. ===Spain=== The Spanish version was broadcast by Telecinco from 1996 to 2008 (except in 2003 and 2004 when the show was cancelled), by La Sexta from May 2008 to December 2008, and by Cuatro in 2010. The first period (1996 to 2002) was produced by GloboMedia, while Cuatro Cabezas was in charge from 2002 to 2010. In their first stage, the show was hosted by El Gran Wyoming. Some of the reporters (like Pablo Carbonell) were already experienced TV journalists, while the rest started their television careers in CQC such as Javier Martin and Arturo Valls. Despite enjoying a high rating and the numerous awards given to the programme and its presenter, Telecinco decided to cancel the show at the end of 2002 alleging business reasons. On the weeks after the cancellation was announced, the program experienced a rise in its audience rating. The announcement was made after the reporters suggested to include a section about Ana Botella, wife of the former Spanish prime minister, though Telecinco denied that the cancellation had any connection to that. In 2005 the programme returned to Telecinco, this time hosted by Manel Fuentes, Arturo Valls, Eduardo Aldán and Deborah Ombres as the first woman in the cast. The good ratings made the show renew their contracts for a second season, hosted by Arturo Valls, Manel Fuentes and Juan Ramón Bonet (Juanra) with the reporter cast of Toni Garrido, Fernando González (Gonzo) and Christian Gálvez, having also Arturo Valls as reporter. In the third season, Toni Garrido was replaced by Eugeni Alemany and Francisco Rodríguez was introduced after winning a contests of reporters; later Christian Gálvez left the programme for another projects in Telecinco and Maldo made his appearance in the team of reporters. The fourth season, which began in Autumn 2007, had Manel Fuentes, Juan Ramón Bonet and Leandro Rivera as hosts, the latter in replacement of Arturo Valls. In 2008, La Sexta bought the rights of the programme from rival channel Telecinco.La Sexta arrebata 'Caiga quien Caiga' a Telecinco  elmundo.es This new period of the programme began on the 14th of May 2008 with many new faces, as some of the old hosts and reporters had a contract with Telecinco (like Manel Fuentes) or decided to leave for another projects (like Gonzo). The host in this period was Frank Blanco, a radio presenter, accompanied by Juan Ramón Bonet and Toni Garrido, who come back to the show after two seasons. Estíbaliz Gabilondo, the comical duo Niño y Fox and Miguel Martín were the new reporters. The show was cancelled in December 2008 after 17 episodes because of low ratings.La Sexta arrebata 'Caiga quien Caiga' se despide de laSexta por no alcanzar los resultados esperados In 2010, TV channel Cuatro decided to pick up the format with a female trio of presenters. The host in this new period were Ana Milán, Silvia Abril and Tània Sarrias.Ana Milán, Silvia Abril y Tània Sarrias conducirán el nuevo \\"Caiga quien caiga\\" The show was not renewed due to low ratings. ===Italy=== The Italian version is called Le Iene, which is the Italian title of Tarantino's movie Reservoir Dogs. It started in 1996, currently transmitting on Italia 1. ===France=== There has been an edition of CQC as \\"Les Hyènes\\" in France,called \\"Les Hyènes\\" and hosted by Caroline Diament.\\"TV FOR EXPORT\\" - Revista Nueva transmitting on France 2. ===Israel=== The Israeli edition of CQC aired in 2001, but was cancelled after one season for low ratings. The lack of success is attributed to the heavy competition by other satirical shows already established. ===Brazil=== The Brazilian edition of CQC is called Custe o Que Custar (\\"Whatever it Takes\\") and is aired on Rede Bandeirantes (Band) on Monday nights (10:15 PM, Brazilian time) and reprised on Saturdays (12:00 AM, same time zone) from March 17, 2008 to December 28, 2015. The show is hosted by Marcelo Tas, Marco Luque and Oscar Filho (nicknamed the Pequeno Pônei (Little Pony) of the team, due to his short stature), and its journalist crew is also comprised by Felipe Andreoli, Rafael Cortez, Monica Iozzi (who won the contest Quem quer ser o 8º integrante do CQC? - \\"Who Wants To Be The 8th Member Of CQC?\\"), joined by Maurício Meirelles in late 2011 and Ronald Rios in 2012. Meirelles and Rios entered the show as replacements to former co-host Rafinha Bastos (who took a leave from the show after making an inappropriate joke about singer Wanessa's pregnancy, being subsequently dismissed by Band following revile from the media; he would go on to present the short-lived Brazilian version of Saturday Night Live on RedeTV!, as well as his own show on cable channel FX) and Danilo Gentili (formerly known as \\"the unexperienced reporter\\"), who left to star on his own project in Band, the talk show Agora é Tarde (\\"Now It's Too Late\\"), which in its last year (2014) was helmed by Bastos while Gentili left for SBT, where he presents another talk show in the same mold, The Noite com Danilo Gentili, which is airing to this day. In later years, as the reporters became bigger media figures and got scoped out by other networks, the show's turnover rate increased, with actor Dan Stulbach replacing Marcelo Tas in the show's final year. ===United States=== Cuatro Cabezas is planning to export the show to the United States, and shot a pilot in Argentina with hosts Dominic Monaghan, Zach Selwyn and the late Greg Giraldo.Political comedy show 'CQC' has eye on U.S. Clips of the pilot and interviews of the hosts (and Monaghan's girlfriend Evangeline Lilly) aired in the June 23, 2008 edition of the Argentine show. ===Portugal=== The Portuguese version of the show, Caia Quem Caia, premiered on TVI on October 25, 2008. The show was fronted by Pedro Fernandes, José Pedro Vasconcelos, and Joana Cruz. Additional field reporting was done by João Santos, Miguel Rocha, and Filipe Cardoso. The show's regular slot was Saturday nights, although it occasionally got bumped to the following evening. The first series ended on January 17, 2009, with no indication that it would come back in the future. ===Netherlands=== A Dutch adaptation of CQC was broadcast since August 2009 on Veronica, and was presented by Dutch TV presenters Beau van Erven Dorens, Pieter Jouke and Daan Nieber. It ended on April 5 of the following year. ==References== ==External links== * Official Argentine site * Official Italian version site * Official Spanish version site * Formerly official Spanish version site * Official Chilean version site * Official Brazilian version site * Official Portuguese version site * CQC Monography * TV for export in Argentina.ar * Official Dutch site Category:1995 Argentine television series debuts Category:Mega (Chilean TV channel) original programming Category:Telecinco original programming Category:Argentine comedy television series Category:1990s Argentine television series Category:El Trece original programming Category:International Emmy Award for Best Non-Scripted Entertainment winners ","title":"Caiga Quien Caiga"},{"id":"2580021","text":"There for Me may refer to: * \\"There for Me\\" (La Bionda song), also recorded by Sarah Brightman * \\"There for Me\\", a song by Mariah Carey, B-side to \\"Never Too Far/Hero Medley\\" * \\"There for Me\\" (Bonnie Piesse song) ","title":"There for Me"},{"id":"2580024","text":"Historias de sexo de gente común () is a television show about common people's lives revolving around sex in Argentina, produced by Endemol and aired by Telefé. ==References== ==Cast== *Juan Gil Navarro *Carlos Santamaría *Jazmín Stuart *Carolina Peleritti Category:2000s Argentine television series Category:2004 telenovelas Category:2004 Argentine television series debuts Category:2005 Argentine television series endings Category:Argentine telenovelas Category:Telefe telenovelas Category:Spanish-language telenovelas ","title":"Historias de sexo de gente común"},{"id":"2580027","text":"Matthew Werkmeister (born 30 January 1992)Date of birth in publicity received by post from Neighbours from Channel 10Date of birth in publicity received by post from Neighbours from Channel 10Date of birth in publicity received by post from Neighbours from Channel 10 is an Australian stage and television actor. He is best known for his role as Zeke Kinski in the soap opera Neighbours from 2005 to 2011. ==Career== Werkmeister began his career with the Children's Performing Company of Australia and is represented by the Talent Company of Australia. Prior to appearing in Neighbours, Werkmeister appeared in a stage production of The Full Monty. It was for this portrayal that he was nominated in 2005 for a Music Theatre Guild of Victoria: Awards for Excellence award in the category of Junior Performer (Male). The award was won by Daniel Todd for the stage production of Kiss Me Kate. It was whilst he was appearing in The Full Monty that Werkmeister landed the role of Zeke Kinski in the Australian soap opera Neighbours. He almost missed out on the role when his father took the call about the audition and refused it because it was a five- hour drive to there. Werkmeister has said that he was \\"horrified\\" when he found out and called his agent back to find out if he could still attend the audition. He joined the cast in 2005 initially in a recurring role before becoming a regular cast member. His portrayal of Zeke Kinski led to a nomination in 2008 for Best Young Actor at the Inside Soap awards alongside fellow cast member Fletcher O'Leary (Mickey Gannon). During his time on Neighbours, Werkmeister met British singer Lily Allen when she filmed a cameo role with him. Speaking about the cameo appearance, Werkmeister admitted he was \\"freaking out\\". In 2008, he joined the judging panel of the Inkys, Australia's only teenage choice book award judged by people under 20 years of age. The aim of the reward is to encourage young people to read. Of his judging role Werkmeister said \\"Finding the time is the difficult part but some of the books are great so the reading part has been fun.\\" In 2009, Werkmeister was shortlisted for two Logie Awards. He was nominated for \\"Most Popular Actor\\" alongside fellow cast members Steve Bastoni (Steve Parker), Alan Fletcher (Karl Kennedy), Ryan Moloney (Toadfish Rebecchi) and Ian Smith (Harold Bishop). He was also shortlisted for \\"Most Popular Personality on TV\\" alongside fellow cast members Pippa Black (Elle Robinson), Carla Bonner (Stephanie Scully) and Tom Oliver (Lou Carpenter). 2010 saw Werkmeister shortlisted for \\"Most Popular Actor\\" again. In October 2010, it was announced that Werkmeister was to leave Neighbours along with Jane Hall (Rebecca Robinson) and Erin Mullally (Declan Napier). Speaking about his decision to leave, Werkmeister said \\"When I started on Neighbours I was only thirteen, I didn't shave or drive a car so I really have grown up on the show, I've learnt so much, worked with some great people who are now some of my closest friends.\\" His final episode was broadcast on 11 March 2011. In 2012, Werkmeister made a cameo appearance in Australian band Eagle and the Worm's music video for their single \\"Give Me Time\\". In the video, he played a roller- skating sex symbol. From May to June 2013, Werkmeister performed as Roger Boothby in Barry Lowe's acclaimed stage play The Death of Peter Pan at Melbourne's Chapel Off Chapel. In April 2014 Werkmeister made a brief return to Neighbours as part of his on-screen family, the Kennedys' 20th anniversary. ==Personal life== Werkmeister was educated at St Peters College in Cranbourne, Victoria and did most of his schoolwork by correspondence due to his acting commitments. In 2010 he attended his Débutante Ball. His hobbies include skimboarding, playing chess, oil painting, playing guitar and eating. Since leaving Neighbours, Werkmeister has kept a low-profile. In February 2017, he moved to the United States. == References Matthew Werkmeister at TV.com * Matthew Werkmeister at PerfectBlend.net Category:Australian male soap opera actors Category:Australian male stage actors Category:Living people Category:1992 births Category:21st-century Australian male actors ","title":"Matthew Werkmeister"},{"id":"2580028","text":"The Haxtur Award (Premios Haxtur) is a Spanish award for comics published in Spain.

It is not the first such island in the bay (See Umi-no- mori :ja:海の森公園), however at current fill rates there will be no more room for waste landfill in the bay without affecting shipping lanes by around 2050, likewise Osaka Bay and Ise Bay also are slowing being consumed by waste landfill islands, e.g. Rinku Town. ==History== The island was originally conceived in the 1930s as a site for a new Tokyo Municipal Airport to replace Haneda Airport. The airport plan was finalized in 1938 and work on the island began in 1939, but fell behind schedule due to resource constraints during World War II. The airport plan was officially abandoned following the war, as the Allied occupation authorities favored expanding Haneda rather than building a new airport. A public beach opened on the island in 1947, at which time the \\"Yumenoshima\\" name was adopted. The beach closed in 1950, and from 1957 the island was used for garbage disposal. ==Places== Shin-Koto Incineration Plant Yumenoshima is a fairly small district, and contains: * Yumenoshima Park, a public park with an array of facilities, including a tropical botanical garden, a sports complex, a barbecue area, a colosseum, a yacht marina, and a track and field stadium * Yumenoshima Stadium, a football and athletics stadium used for youth competitions and lower league football matches. * Yumenoshima Baseball Field, a baseball field for local youth teams * Koto Incineration Facility, an incineration facility for Koto ward Today, Yumenoshima also houses the Daigo Fukuryū Maru, a wooden fishing boat exposed to nuclear fallout during the Bikini Atoll test in 1954; the boat was modified as a training vessel following the exposure, and later abandoned near Yumenoshima. == 2020 Summer Olympics == Yumenoshima Park is set to be the venue for archery events in the 2020 Summer Olympics. It will also host archery events for the 2020 Summer Paralympics. ==External links== * ==References== Category:Artificial islands of Tokyo Category:Districts of Kōtō Category:Islands of Tokyo ","title":"Yumenoshima"},{"id":"2580045","text":"Normann (\\"The Norminator\\") Stadler (born February 25, 1973 in Wertheim) is a retired professional triathlete from Germany. He is the winner of the 2004 and 2006 Ironman Triathlon World Championship in Hawaii. Stadler was a member of the Tri Dubai triathlon team until it disbanded at the end of the 2006 triathlon season. Up until 2011, he was a member of the Commerzbank Triathlon Team. ==Career== Stadler ran his first marathon at 11 years old. Later, he became a triathlete and was a member of the German national team in 1988. He won a world duathlon title in 1994. He first competed at the Ironman World Championship in 1999 as an age-group athlete.http://www.athlinks.com/Events/24555/Courses/37076 He took third place in 2000, fourth place in 2001 and 2003, and then he won in 2004.http://www.trijuice.com/2011/09/interview_normann_stadler_im_thankful_that_im_still_here_- _commerzbank_team.htmhttp://www.athlinks.com/Events/24564/Courses/37089/ Following his 2004 Ironman World Championship, Stadler was expected to do well in the 2005 Ironman. However, he withdrew from the race after suffering three tire punctures and a bleeding bee sting on the thigh. In 2006, Normann returned to Kona to compete in the Ironman World Championships. Stadler swam fast enough to exit the water only moments behind the race leaders. Once on the bike course, Stadler managed to gain over 10 minutes on the chase pack, setting a bike course record at 4:18:23 (26 mph).

When regulatory capture occurs, a special interest is prioritized over the general interests of the public, leading to a net loss for society. Government agencies suffering regulatory capture are called \\"captured agencies.\\" The theory of client politics is related to that of rent-seeking and political failure; client politics \\"occurs when most or all of the benefits of a program go to some single, reasonably small interest (e.g., industry, profession, or locality) but most or all of the costs will be borne by a large number of people (for example, all taxpayers).\\" ==Theory== Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) as Barrier-to-Competition: Applications- to-Operate vs In-Operation For public choice theorists, regulatory capture occurs because groups or individuals with a high-stakes interest in the outcome of policy or regulatory decisions can be expected to focus their resources and energies in attempting to gain the policy outcomes they prefer, while members of the public, each with only a tiny individual stake in the outcome, will ignore it altogether.Timothy B. Lee, \\"Entangling the Web\\" The New York Times (August 3, 2006). Retrieved April 1, 2011 Regulatory capture refers to the actions by interest groups when this imbalance of focused resources devoted to a particular policy outcome is successful at \\"capturing\\" influence with the staff or commission members of the regulatory agency, so that the preferred policy outcomes of the special interest groups are implemented. Regulatory capture theory is a core focus of the branch of public choice referred to as the economics of regulation; economists in this specialty are critical of conceptualizations of governmental regulatory intervention as being motivated to protect public good. Often cited articles include Bernstein (1955), Huntington (1952), Laffont & Tirole (1991), and Levine & Forrence (1990). The theory of regulatory capture is associated with Nobel laureate economist George Stigler, one of its major developers.Edmund Amann (Ed.), Regulating Development: Evidence from Africa and Latin America Google Books. Edward Elgar Publishing (2006), p. 14\\\\. . Retrieved April 14, 2011 Likelihood of regulatory capture is a risk to which an agency is exposed by its very nature.Gary Adams, Sharon Hayes, Stuart Weierter and John Boyd, \\"Regulatory Capture: Managing the Risk\\" ICE Australia, International Conferences and Events (PDF) (October 24, 2007). Retrieved April 14, 2011 This suggests that a regulatory agency should be protected from outside influence as much as possible. Alternatively, it may be better to not create a given agency at all lest the agency become victim, in which case it may serve its regulated subjects rather than those whom the agency was designed to protect. A captured regulatory agency is often worse than no regulation, because it wields the authority of government. However, increased transparency of the agency may mitigate the effects of capture. Recent evidence suggests that, even in mature democracies with high levels of transparency and media freedom, more extensive and complex regulatory environments are associated with higher levels of corruption (including regulatory capture).Hamilton, Alexander (2013), Small is beautiful, at least in high-income democracies: the distribution of policy-making responsibility, electoral accountability, and incentives for rent extraction , World Bank. === Relationship with federalism === There is substantial academic literature suggesting that smaller government units are easier for small, concentrated industries to capture than large ones. For example, a group of states or provinces with a large timber industry might have their legislature and/or their delegation to the national legislature captured by lumber companies. These states or provinces then becomes the voice of the industry, even to the point of blocking national policies that would be preferred by the majority across the whole federation. Moore and Giovinazzo (2012) call this \\"distortion gap\\". The opposite scenario is possible with very large industries, however. Very large and powerful industries (e.g. energy, banking, weapon system construction) can capture national governments, and then use that power to block policies at the federal, state or provincial level that the voters may want, although even local interests can thwart national priorities. ===Economic rationale=== The idea of regulatory capture has an economic basis: vested interests in an industry have the greatest financial stake in regulatory activity of any social agent and are thus more likely to be moved to influence the regulatory body than relatively dispersed individual consumers, each of whom has little particular incentive to try to influence regulators. When regulators form expert bodies to examine policy, these invariably feature current or former industry members, or at the very least, individuals with lives and contacts in the industry to be reviewed. Capture is also facilitated in situations where consumers or taxpayers have a poor understanding of underlying issues and businesses enjoy a knowledge advantage. Some economists, such as Jon Hanson and his co-authors, argue that the phenomenon extends beyond just political agencies and organizations. Businesses have an incentive to control anything that has power over them, including institutions from the media, academia and popular culture, thus they will try to capture them as well. This phenomenon is called \\"deep capture\\".Jon D. Hanson and David G. Yosifon, The Situation: An Introduction to the Situational Character, Critical Realism, Power Economics, and Deep Capture Abstract at Social Science Research Network. University of Pennsylvania Law Review, Vol. 152, p. 129 (2003-2004); Santa Clara University Legal Studies Research Paper No. 06-17; Harvard Public Law Working Paper No. 08-32. Retrieved April 12, 2011 Regulatory public interest is based on market failure and welfare economics. It holds that regulation is the response of the government to public needs. Its purpose is to make up for market failures, improve the efficiency of resource allocation, and maximize social welfare. Posner pointed out that the public interest theory contains the assumption that the market is fragile, and that if left unchecked, it will tend to be unfair and inefficient, and government regulation is a costless and effective way to meet the needs of social justice and efficiency. Mimik believes that government regulation is a public administration policy that focuses on private behavior. It is a rule drawn from the public interest. Irving and Brouhingan saw regulation as a way of obeying public needs and weakening the risk of market operations. It also expressed the view that regulation reflects the public interest. == Development == The review of the United States' history of regulation at the end of the 19th century, especially the regulation of railway tariffs by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1887, revealed that regulations and market failures are not co-relevant. At least until the 1960s, in terms of regulatory experience, regulation was developed in the direction of favoring producers, and regulation increased the profits of manufacturers within the industry. In potentially competitive industries such as the trucking industry and the taxi industry, regulations allow pricing to be higher than cost and prevent entrants. In the natural monopoly industries such as the electric power industry, there are facts that regulation has little effect on prices, so the industry can earn profits above normal profits. Empirical evidence proves that regulation is beneficial to producers. These empirical observations have led to the emergence and development of regulatory capture theory. Contrary to regulatory public interest theory, regulation capture theory holds that the provision of regulation is adapting to the industry's need for regulation, that is, the legislator is controlled and captured by the industry in regulation, and the regulation institution is gradually controlled by the industry. That is, the regulator is captured by the industry. The basic view of the regulatory capture theory is that no matter how the regulatory scheme is designed, the regulation of an industry by a regulatory agency is actually \\"captured\\" by the industry. The implication is that regulation increases the profits of the industry rather than social welfare. The above-mentioned regulatory capture theory is essentially a purely capture theory in the early days, that is, the regulators and legislators were captured and controlled by the industry. The later regulatory models such as Stiegler (Stigler Model)-Pelzmann (Pelzmann Model)-Becker (Becker Model) belong to the regulatory capture theory in the eyes of Posner (1974) and others. Because these models all reflect that regulators and legislators are not pursuing the maximization of public interests, but the maximization of private interests, that is, using \\"private interest\\" theory to explain the origin and purpose of regulation. Aton (1986) argues that Stigler's theoretical logic is clear and more central than the previous \\"capture theory\\" hypothesis, but it is difficult to distinguish between the two. Regulatory capture theory has a specific meaning, that is, an experience statement that regulations are beneficial for producers in real life. In fact, it is essentially not a true regulatory theory. Although the analysis results are similar to the Stigler model provide interpretation and support for the regulatory capture theory is beneficial for producers, however the analysis methods of the latter are completely different. Stigler used standard economic analysis methods to analyze the regulation behavior, then created a new regulatory theory - regulatory economic theory. Of course, different divisions depend on the criteria for division, and they essentially depend on the researchers' different understanding of specific concepts. Justice Douglas’ dissent in Sierra Club v Morton describes concern that regulatory agencies become too favorable with their regulated industries. == Types == There are two basic types of regulatory capture: * Materialist capture, also called financial capture, in which the captured regulator's motive is based on its material self-interest. This can result from bribery, revolving doors, political donations, or the regulator's desire to maintain its government funding. These forms of capture often amount to political corruption. * Non-materialist capture, also called cognitive capture or cultural capture, in which the regulator begins to think like the regulated industry. This can result from interest-groups lobbying by the industry. Highly specialized technical industries can be at risk of cultural capture, because the regulating agency typically needs to employ experts in the regulated area, and the pool of such experts typically consists largely of existing or former employees from the regulated industry. Another distinction can be made between capture retained by big firms and by small firms. While Stigler mainly referred, in his work, to large firms capturing regulators by bartering their vast resources (materialist capture) – small firms are more prone to retain non-materialist capture via a special underdog rhetoric. ==See also== * Campaign finance * Concentrated benefits and diffuse costs * Corporate welfare * Crony capitalism * Inverted totalitarianism * Iron triangle (US politics) * Occupational licensing * Regulator shopping * Regulatory capitalism * Rent seeking * State capture ;Literature * 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs, by Arthur Kallet and F.J.

Lambert was a member of the board of directors of the American Psychological Association from 1984 to 1987. ==Biography== Lambert was born in Ephraim, Utah, and raised in West Hollywood, California. After earning an undergraduate degree at the University of California, Los Angeles and a master's degree at Cal State University Los Angeles, she received a Ph.D. in psychology from University of Southern California. Her doctoral studies focused on psychometrics. She taught at University of California, Berkeley and founded the school psychology program at the education school in 1964, her first year there. The National Institute of Mental Health supported the program for 18 years. Lambert's latest research was on the measurement of adaptive functioning, and on the developmental course of ADHD. A Fellow of the American Psychological Association, she has also served on its board of directors (1984–87) and chaired its Board of Educational Affairs from 1992-94. Lambert wrote such instruments in school psychology as the AAMD Adaptive Behavior Scale (1981 and 1993 editions) and the Children’s Attention and Adjustment Survey (1992).

The DS2 system was notable in that its authors proved that it was possible to perform significant and useful serious computing tasks on a hardware platform with such severely limited resources that even the manufacturer called it only a \\"game machine\\". The Commodore-64 was a simple computer, based on the MOS Technology 6502 8-bit microprocessor, with 64 kilobytes of RAM, only 38k of which was available for program code and variables that could be used by the built-in BASIC programming language interpreter. Nevertheless, several different BBS programs were developed (including DS2) by various independent programmers (mostly hobbyists not affiliated with any large software publisher) that enabled a System Operator (SysOp) to run a single-user, multiple member online community supporting threaded topical discussions, on-line games; information reference library, live chat mode with the console operator, file-sharing library and the ability to create a customized user experience in BASIC, thus the Developers System title. From an engineering standpoint, C-Net DS2 was remarkable in its use of Machine language modules, early multitasking technology, relocatable code, and modular program overlays. Although the user experience was entirely text-based and non-graphical, fast performance could be attained through the use of memory expansion modules, IEEE-488 interface hard drives, and modem speeds including the mid-1980s state of the art 19,200 bit/s. Although the emergence of widely available public internet services has made private BBS systems obsolete in most of the developed free world, a dedicated core of enthusiasts continue to tinker with vintage computers and keep software like DS2 running, despite the quaint limitations of the simple linear message threading system and the primitive keyboard-based, non-graphical games. C-Net 64 DS2 also had networking capabilities using Gary O'Brien's DS2 Network developed in 1989. This modification or add-on to C-Net DS2 BBS allowed it to connect to other C-Net BBS's and transfer a single file packet composed of all messages, email and stats from online games since the last connection. The packet would be uploaded to the receiving BBS and another packet tagged for that BBS would be downloaded. Both systems would then sort and file the packets on their systems making the new information available on each system. Gary continued to develop DS2 Network until mid-1993, then turned over rights and development to Michael Bendure. Michael eventually took over support and distribution of both C-Net 64 DS2 BBS and DS2 Network from 1993 to 1998. An article in Commodore World Magazine; Issue 3 Volume 1, Number 3 that detailed DS2 Network features and network structure was published in 1994. Michael worked with BBS programmers on other platforms to develop a standard packet structure that all BBS Networks could convert into their existing Networks. This project later became known as CommNet and covered hundreds of BBS's all over the world running C-Net DS2, C-Net 128, Image, Color64 and even some FidoNet BBS's. C-Net DS2 is currently in development.

Dilawar kept wicket for India in three Test matches. On his debut, Dilawar was made to open the innings against England on a green wicket in Calcutta in 1933-34. He was hit on the head by a delivery from Morris Nichols and retired. He returned with a bandage over his head, and was hit on the thumb by Nobby Clark, but top scored with 59. He made 57 in the second innings and is one of the few Test cricketers to top-score in both innings on debut. He had started his first-class career making 64 and 112 in his first match. His last appearance came about in the 1936 Indian tour of England; Dilawar was studying at Cambridge University at the time and joined the team in England. Cota Ramaswami has painted an exquisite picture of Dilawar: He was a tall and bulky person with a prominent stomach and invariably played with a clean shaven head without any hat or cap or any kind of head gear. He always wore very loose pants and after batting for a while or keeping wicket for sometime his shirt will be hanging out of the trousers and somebody must tuck it in, now and then. He had a rather ugly and uncouth stance at the wicket as he held his bat very low and bent his body forward so much that his head was practically in line with the top of the wickets. Those who watched him from the on side could only see his prominent hind portion of the body sticking up while the head, bat and the rest of Dilawar Hussain were hardly visible. However, he had a very sound defence and so it was very difficult to get him out. He was the most selfish batsman that I have ever seen. He played first- class cricket in India from 1925 to 1941, with a gap between 1935 and 1938 while he was studying at Cambridge. Richard Cashman writes that he had an encyclopedic memory which enabled him to recall cricket score sheets at will and was also a \\"great eater and talker\\", \\"who could liven the passing hour with an unbroken monologue on any subject from philosophy ... to the art of seasoning a good curry\\". Dilawar was known as \\"Professor\\" in his later years. He took a doctorate in Philosophy and was a double MA degree holder.

Russell Lea is located 8 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Canada Bay. Russell Lea sits on the western shore of Iron Cove, on the Parramatta River. It is a quiet tree-lined suburb with large waterfront homes as well as more traditional federation homes. ==History== Russell Lea takes its name from one of its original settlers, Russell Barton, who was a pastoralist, mine owner and politician. He developed the \\"Russell Lea Estate\\" on a grant.Scottish Place Names - Sydney, Australia Russell Lea was once encompassed in the Five Dock Farm estate of surgeon John Harris. In 1790 this outspoken Irishman arrived in the infant colony, for which he displayed an instant dislike. However his rapid acquisition of Crown land may have served to change his tune. After being appointed court magistrate in 1794, Harris received in the Parramatta region which now bears the name Harris Park. Subsequent to this he received land at Ultimo and South Creek, earning him the distinction of being one of the principal landholders in New South Wales. It was in 1806 that Harris added Five Dock Farm to his holdings. All land between Iron Cove and Hen and Chicken Bay, totalling some , was granted to Harris from the Crown. Harris was called to London for the trial of Governor William Bligh soon after. Siding with the rebellious New South Wales Corps, Harris found it necessary to resign his military post. At age 60 he returned to Sydney, accompanied by his 24-year-old bride Eliza. Two years prior to the surgeon's death in 1838, Harris sold Five Dock Farm to the prominent Sydney auctioneer Mr Samuel Lyons. Although a modest residence stood on Harris' land, it appears he preferred to reside at his Ultimo Place mansion or Shanes Park, South Creek. It was at the latter that the surgeon died in 1838. Aged 84, the widowed Harris had achieved a prominent public profile, leaving an estate worth an estimated 150,000 pounds. Samuel Lyons proceeded to subdivide Five Dock Farm into substantial estates. This made way for the grand mansions, some of which spawned suburbs of their own. These included Drummoyne House, Abbotsford, and Barton Russell's grand residence Russell Lea. Russell Barton was born in Penge near London in 1830. As a young man he accompanied his family to the colony, settling a station in the then remote state of South Australia. In 1855 he married Miss J. M. Davie, and within a decade acquired two stations on the Barwon River. Barton could turn his hand to any task. In addition to stock handling, farming, horse breaking and shepherding, Barton proved himself adequate as a butcher, blacksmith, builder, carpenter, contractor and stonemason. In 1874 he invested in the Cobar mine, eventually rising to serve as its Managing Director. Displaying much skill in this industry, Barton was soon elected to no less than 11 mining company boards. From 1880 to 1886 Barton served as parliamentary member for Bourke.Barton, Russell (1830 - 1916) Biographical Entry - Australian Dictionary of Biography Online It was during this time he erected the imposing Victorian Italianate mansion Russell Lea, whose estate occupied the suburb which bears its name.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , pages 87 & 104 Transportation improvements in the late nineteenth century occasioned residential development in the Drummoyne municipality. By 1874 a regular horse bus serviced the local residents, and in 1881 the original Gladesville Bridge was completed. Not only did this connect the Drummoyne region with the inner Sydney suburbs, it served as the sole roadway between Port Jackson and the lower Parramatta River environs until the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932. The Gladesville Bridge was followed closely by the Iron Cove Bridge, spanning Iron Cove in 1882. In 1890, a tramway was connected between Five Dock and Leichhardt. By 1902, when the local government bodies of Five Dock and Drummoyne were merged into the Borough of Drummoyne, the regional population stood at 2,800. Russell Barton's Russell Lea estate survived intact until 1913, when it was subdivided and auctioned by Hardie and Gorman.http://www.villagevoice.com.au/article/99999999/LOCAL01/61127006/Russell+Lea Village Voice ==Landmarks== *Russell Lea Infants School is one of the oldest landmarks in the area. *Cambell park, a large soccer field home to Abbotsford Juniors Football Club *The main roads running through Russell Lea are Lyons Road and Hampden Road. ==Population== In the , Russell Lea has a population of 5,001 persons, of whom 2,621 (52.4%) were female and 2,380 (47.6%) were male. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:City of Canada Bay ","title":"Russell Lea, New South Wales"},{"id":"2580167","text":"Rushcutters Bay is a harbourside eastern suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 3 kilometres east of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Sydney.Gregory's Sydney Street Directory, Gregory's Publishing Company, 2007 The suburb of Rushcutters Bay sits beside the bay it takes its name from, on Sydney Harbour.

He was well educated at the cathedral school, was a monk and later abbot at Agali, a spiritual student of Saint Eugene II, and archbishop of Toledo. He was the first bishop to have primacy over the entire Iberian Peninsula—a position he has been accused of securing by being complicit in 680 in the supposed poisoning of Wamba, king of the VisigothsRoger Collins regards this as being \\"quite unnecessarily Machiavellian\\"; see his Early Medieval Spain; Unity in Diversity, 400-1000, 2nd ed., New York: St. Martin's Press, 1995, pp. 77-78.—and he helped centralize the Iberian Church in Toledo. His elevation to the position of primate of the Visigothic church was a source of great unhappiness among the kingdom's clergy. And his views regarding the doctrine of the Trinity proved distressing to the Vatican. He presided over several councils and synods and revised the Mozarabic liturgy. A voluminous writer, his works include Prognostics, a volume on death (and by far his most influential work); a history of King Wamba's war with dux Paul in Septimania (a Sallustian work, and one of the few examples of historical writing from the late Visigothic kingdom); and a book on the future life (687). A lost work, apparently dedicated to King Erwig, dealt with the issue of Jews owning Christian slaves. He encouraged the Visigothic kings in Hispania to deal harshly with the Jews. For example, in presiding over the Twelfth Council of Toledo, he induced King Erwig to pass severe anti-Jewish laws. At Erwig's request, in 686, he wrote De Comprobatione Aetatis Sextae Contra Judaeos, a work dealing with messianic prophesies of the Bible in a way intended to convert the Jews. He died at Toledo in 690 of natural causes. Julian's memorial is held March 8. He is commemorated by way of a portrait in the cathedral of Toledo.

These subdivisions are more well known as Upper Chase and Lower Chase. North of Warringah Road (Upper Chase), the residential development is lighter and is largely surrounded by bushland. The area is defined by the gully of Moores Creek to the west and north, plus Middle Harbour to the east. Much of the surrounding bushland is contained within Garigal National Park.Gregory's Sydney Street Directory, Gregory's Publishing Company, 2007 ==History== Captain Arthur Phillip's search for \\"good land, well watered\\" led to the discovery and colonisation of the rough shores of Roseville Chase, where Samuel Bates built a farm at Echo Point on the edge of what is now Middle Harbour. The area was also inhabited by Aboriginal people, who left their mark in the form of hand stencils that can be seen in rock shelters in the area. Later, the area was settled by Europeans like David Mathew and Richard Archbold, whose property eventually extended to Moores Creek and became the site of an orchard.Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon, Angus and Robertson, 1990 During World War I the area was used as a training area for army engineers under the command of John (later Sir John) Madsen. Many people lived in the Sydney bush during the Great Depression.Sydney and Blue Mountains Bushwalks, Neil Paton, Kangaroo Press, 2004 Remains of dwellings can still be found in the bush at Roseville Chase. Remains of a bush dwelling Roseville Chase Post Office opened on 2 March 1953 and closed in 1994. Contemporary historians unanimously agree, Roseville Chase's greatest moment of the \\"modern era\\" was on 14 September 2000, when the Olympic Torch passed through the suburb, on its journey from Mt Olympus in Greece, to Stadium Australia (as it was then known), in Homebush Bay. The Torch traversed through the suburb from south to north along Babbage Road, before crossing the Roseville Bridge on its journey bound for Manly. Well-wishers young and old lined the streets to cheer on the Torch and a VIP viewing area was also established around the Malga Ave Overpass, where VIP Patrons were able to enjoy the Hospitality Marquee that had been erected with the aid of direct sponsorship from First Choice Crown on the Hill and other local businesses. Sausage Sizzlers were available, as well as cans of Forrie Bitter, 3 for $6. ==Population== In the 2016 Census, there were 1,616 people in Roseville Chase, of whom 68.0% were Australia and 76.0% of whom spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were \\"No Religion\\" 31.6%, \\"Catholic\\" 24.8% and \\"Anglican\\" 21.2%. ==References== Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:Ku-ring-gai Council ","title":"Roseville Chase, New South Wales"},{"id":"2580235","text":"Rossmore is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is bound to the east by Kemps Creek, the west by South Creek, the north by Fifteenth Avenue, and the south by Rileys Creek in the southwest and a non natural border from there. The main road through the centre of the suburb is Bringelly Road. ==History== Rossmore was originally known as Cabramatta after the parish of Cabramatta. It was the subject of a novel called The Cabramatta Store by Mary Theresa Vidal, which is believed to be the first novel published by a woman in Australia. In 1856, the railway line was extended from Granville to Liverpool and a station was established at what is now the modern-day Cabramatta. There was a horse stud in the area called Rossmoor Stud which is believed to have been named after Rossmore Lodge, a famous horse stud in Kildare, Ireland. To avoid confusion with the new station of Cabramatta, the old town of Cabramatta became known as Rossmore. Rossmore Post Office opened on 22 March 1897. == Heritage listings == Rossmore has a number of heritage- listed sites, including: * 130 Rossmore Avenue West: Church of the Holy Innocents ==Demographics== According to the 2016 census, Rossmore had a population of 2,286 people with a median age of 39, which was slightly higher than the national median age of 38.

About half (55.0%) of people only spoke English at home, with Arabic (10.2%), Italian (7.1%), Cantonese (4.4%), Maltese (2.5%) and Serbian (1.9%) forming the top responses for other languages spoken at home. ==Housing== As at the 2016 census, Rossmore had a total of 716 private dwellings, of which 99.4% were detached houses. Of these occupied private dwellings, 45.0% were owned outright, 30.5% were rented and 19.6% were owned with a mortgage. ==Churches== The Church of the Holy Innocents in an Anglican church situated in Church Street, just off Bringelly Road. Its foundation stone was laid on 28 December 1848 or Holy Innocents Day. It is a parish church in the Gothic Revival style and was designed by Richard Cromwell Carpenter and Edmund Blacket. It features steep roofs covered with shingles, an open timber porch, a nave, chancel, belfry and vestry. The church is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register and on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/42 The suburb is also home to two Buddhist temples: the Lin Ying temple in Clementson Drive and the Vat Ketanak Khmer Kampuchea Krom in Wynyard Avenue. ==Transport== Bringelly Road connects Rossmore to Liverpool and the Westlink M7, a pay road providing relatively quick connection to Sydney CBD and other parts of greater Sydney. The only public transport in the area is the Route 855/856 bus service connecting Bringelly to Liverpool via Rossmore, Austral, Hoxton Park and Cartwright.Route Map Interline Bus Service In 2015, a stabling facility opened in Rossmore as part of the South West Rail Link, though the terminus station is located at Leppington. ==References== Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:City of Liverpool (New South Wales) Category:Camden Council (New South Wales) ","title":"Rossmore, New South Wales"},{"id":"2580238","text":"Mitchell (postcode: 2911) is a light-industrial estate of Canberra, Australia in the district of Gungahlin.

Roselands is located 16 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district in the City of Canterbury-Bankstown. ==Geography== Roselands lies in the Cooks River watershed. The soil is clay, based on Wianamatta shale and is on the eastern edge of the great Cumberland Plain which extends westward to the Hawkesbury River and into the Blue Mountains. The topography is low rolling hills. Before settlement, the vegetation was open eucalypt woodland. ==History== ===Aboriginal=== The first inhabitants of surrounding areas were Australian Aboriginals who arrived about 40,000 years ago. At the time of British settlement in 1788 the inhabitants were Aborigines of the Darug language group and they called themselves Kuri or Koori. Land grants by the new colonial government began in about 1810. ===European=== This area was originally part of the suburb of Punchbowl and still shares its postcode of 2196. H.R. Morgan was granted land in the area in 1842. John Fenwick bought in about 1880 from Matthew Norman in the area between Canterbury, Canarys and Bonds Roads. He built Belmore House on this land, which was demolished for the construction of Roselands Shopping Centre. The closest railway line was built to the neighbouring suburb of Belmore in 1895 and extended to Bankstown in 1909. The suburb takes its name from the plant nursery that originally occupied the land. Later a golf course was built with same name which was taken over to build the shopping centre. It became a suburb on 9 February 1987, after some years of agitation by local residents and members of parliament.History of Canterbury suburbs - Roselands ==Commercial area== Roselands Shopping Centre was the third fully enclosed shopping precinct in Australia, opened in October 1965 (predated by Monaro Mall [March 1963] in Canberra and Miranda Fair [March 1964] in Sydney). Older open-air shopping precincts in Australia included Chermside Drive-in Shopping Centre (May 1957) in Brisbane, Top Ryde Drive-in Shopping Centre (November 1957) in Sydney, Chadstone Shopping Centre [October 1960] in Melbourne and Warringah Mall (April 1963) in Sydney. Roselands was built on the site of a golf course. It boasted a large Grace Bros Department Store (now Myer), a single movie cinema, an indoor rainfall water feature (the 'raindrop fountain'), tennis courts and the first food court in Australia (Four Corners, demolished in 2000, remade as the Raindrop Food Court in December 2000). Many local bus services were diverted to service the new shopping centre upon its opening, but the centre was primarily designed for the age of the automobile with plenty of parking as it was distant from any railway stations. It has since had many upgrades although it remains smaller than other Sydney shopping centres. ==Transport== King Georges Road is the main road through Roselands. It is a ring road which connects the northern suburbs of Sydney and the north coast motorways of New South Wales to the southern beaches of Sydney and the south coast motorways of New South Wales. King Georges Road also connects Roselands to the M5 South Western Motorway which links to Sydney's International Airport (15 minutes drive east) and west to Canberra and Melbourne. ==Sport and recreation== The Lantern Club is located in Roselands Avenue. Roselands Aquatic Centre is located in Centre Avenue, opposite the shopping centre. Roselands soccer club is located at Bennett Park. ==Demographics== According to the 2016 Census, 44.5 per cent of Roselands residents stated they had been born overseas. Lebanon was the birthplace of the most foreign-born residents in Roselands at 5 per cent, followed by those born in People's Republic of China at 3.8 per cent. In terms of ethnicity, the largest group in 2016 were those claiming Greek ancestry with 12.4 per cent of the responses, followed by those claiming Lebanese background at 12.3 per cent, and thirdly by those claiming Australian descent with 11.3 per cent.Roselands 2016 Census statistics Australian Bureau of Statistics English only is the most common home language in Roselands, used by a plurality of 35.9 per cent of residents, followed by Arabic — the home language of 16.6 per cent — and Greek spoken by 12.2 per cent at home. According to the census, Christianity was the most followed faith in Roselands with 60.5 per cent of residents reporting that they were Christian. However, Christians in the area belong to many denominations, with the largest proportions being Catholic at 24.3 per cent, Orthodox with 17.3 per cent. Islam is the second largest religious group, accounting for 18.8 per cent of residents. ==Politics== Roselands is in the state electorates of Lakemba and Canterbury, both of which are safe Labor seats. ==Gallery== Roselands Memorial.JPGMemorial, Roselands Avenue Roselands Centro 2.JPGRoselands Shopping Centre Roselands shopping centre 1.jpgRoselands Shopping Centre Roselands Bowling Club.JPGRoselands Bowling Club ((Old clubhouse demolished, replaced by Lantern Club) Poker Machine Club) Roselands Sculpture.JPGUnused Water Fountain, Roselands Avenue ==References== ==External links== Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:City of Canterbury-Bankstown ","title":"Roselands, New South Wales"},{"id":"2580280","text":"Rosehill may refer to: ==Places == === Australia === * Rosehill, New South Wales, in Sydney, Australia ===Canada=== * Rosehill, Ontario, a neighborgood in Caledon, Ontario * Rosehill, Toronto, a neighborhood in the Toronto-St. Paul electoral district === Ireland === * Rosehill, Templeport, a townland in County Cavan, Ireland === New Zealand === * Rosehill, New Zealand, a suburb of Auckland === United Kingdom === * Rosehill, Aberdeenshire, an area of Aberdeen, Scotland * Rosehill, Cornwall * Rosehill, Greater Manchester, England, a U.K. location * Rosehill, Lancashire, England, a U.K. location * Rosehill, London * Rosehill, North Tyneside, England, a U.K. location * Rosehill, Pembrokeshire, Wales, a U.K. location * Rosehill, Shropshire, a U.K. location * Rosehill Quarry Community Park, Swansea, Wales === United States === * Rosehill Cemetery, Chicago, Illinois * Rosehill (Gambrills, Maryland), a historic home on the National Register in Anne Arundel County, Maryland * Rosehill, Mississippi, Marion County, Mississippi * Rosehill, Philadelphia, a place in Pennsylvania ==Other uses== * Rosehill (elm hybrid) (Ulmus × intermedia Rosehill) * Jay Rosehill (born 1985), professional ice hockey player * SS Rosehill, a 1911 English steam cargo ship ==See also== * Rose Hill (disambiguation) * ","title":"Rosehill"},{"id":"2580286","text":"The Bluestone River is a tributary of the New River, 77 mi (124 km) long, in southwestern Virginia and southern West Virginia in the United States.Columbia Gazetteer of North America entry Via the New, Kanawha and Ohio rivers, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River.

They formed a constituent part of the Maison militaire du roi de France (\\"Military Household of the King of France\\") under the Ancien Régime. The French Guards, who were located in Paris, played a major part in the French Revolution as most of the guardsmen defected to the revolutionary cause and ensured the collapse of absolute monarchy in France. French Guards led the Storming of the Bastille and formed the cadre for the National Guard. ==History== The regiment was created in 1563 by Charles IX. With a strength of 9000 men it counted 30 companies in 1635 with 300 fusiliers per company. They were armed with a form of musket (\\"fusils\\") or steel-handled pikes, and were allowed to conduct a normal civilian life in times of peace. In practice this meant that they could undertake civilian employment when not required on duty. At Catherine de' Medici's insistence, they were at first spread over several garrisons, but after the attempted kidnapping of King Charles IX near Meaux by Huguenots, the Gardes were brought back together specifically to protect the monarch. thumb ===Privileges, role and organisation=== In times of war the Gardes Françaises had the privilege of choosing their own battle positions (usually in the centre of the first line of infantry). Other privileges included leading the assault when a wall was breached during a siege, the first choice of barracks and special rights of trial. When on parade, they took precedence over all other regiments in the Royal Army. They shared responsibility for guarding the exterior of the Palace of Versailles with the Gardes Suisses. In addition, the French Guards had responsibility for maintaining public order in Paris, in support of the various police forces of the capital. Fontenoy in 1745. Lord Charles Hay, a British officer, reportedly said, \\"Tell your men to fire\\". The Count d'Auteroche, officer of the Gardes françaises, replied, \\"No, we never fire first\\".N.Y. Times, 25 December 1897 In 1789, the Gardes Françaises constituted the largest element of the Household troops (Maison Militaire du Roi). Six grenadier and 24 fusilier companies were divided into the six battalions that comprised the full regiment. The total number of Gardes Françaises amounted to about 3,600 men. The regimental colonel usually held the rank of Marshal of France. Captains of the grenadier companies ranked as colonels in the infantry of the line. There was one grenadier company (109 officers and men) and four fusilier companies (each numbering 132 officers and men) to each battalion.Terry Crowdy, \\"French Revolutionary Infantry 1789-1802\\", ===Image and recruitment basis=== The subsequent image of the Gardes Françaises as a socially-élite palace unit led solely by courtier officers may be largely incorrect. Most of the regimental officers were from outside Paris, and some, such as the future Maréchal Abraham de Fabert, did not have even the status of provincial aristocrats.Philip Mansel, \\"Pillars of Monarchy\\", The rank and file were recruited from all over France but through marriages and off-duty employment, they quickly established local ties in Paris, which were to influence their behaviour at the outbreak of the French Revolution. Guardsmen were enlisted for a minimum of eight years and were required to be French nationals with a minimum height of 1.73 m (5'8\\"), compared with the 1.68 m (5'6\\") of line infantry soldiers. The reported incident at the Battle of Fontenoy in which officers of the Gardes Françaises and their English counterparts invited each other to fire first (see illustration above) is sometimes cited as an example of excessive chivalry amongst aristocratic opponents. However, in 18th-century warfare, the unit that held its fire until it was closest to the enemy would be able to deliver the most effective volley. On this occasion the Gardes Françaises fired first, with limited effect, and sustained heavy casualties, of 411 dead and wounded. ===Uniform=== During the years 1685 to 1789 the regiment wore dark \\"king's blue\\" coats, with red collars, cuffs and waistcoats. Breeches were red (later white), and leggings were white. Grenadiers had high fur hats, and the fusilier companies wore the standard tricorn of the French infantry. Coats and waistcoats were heavily embroidered in white or silver (for officers) braid.Liliane and Fred Funcken, \\"L'Uniforme et les Armes des Soldats de La Guerre en Dentelle\\", ===French Revolution=== Rebel Gardes Françaises (in blue uniforms at left and centre-right) took part in the storming of the Bastille and the arrest of its governor, the Marquis de Launay, shown above. The sympathy shown by the Gardes Françaises for the French Revolution at its outbreak was crucial to the initial success of the rising. The other two units of the Maison militaire du roi de France at the time, the Swiss Guards and the Bodyguard, were loyal to the king, but they were smaller units than the Gardes Françaises and lacked the Parisian connections of the latter regiment. During weeks of disturbances prior to early July 1789 leading up to the fall of the Bastille, the regiment initially obeyed orders and on several occasions, it acted against the increasingly- unruly crowds. In April, during a riot at the Réveillon wallpaper factory, guardsmen had fired on a hostile crowd, killing and wounding several hundreds. However, in addition to local ties with the Parisians, the regiment was resentful of the harsh Prussian style discipline introduced by its colonel, the Duc du Châtelet, who had taken up his appointment the year before. The officers of the regiment had negligently left day-to-day control in the hands of the non-commissioned officers, and had limited interaction with their men. These factors led to desertions from 27 June onward, followed by an incident on 12 July in which French Guards fired on the Royal-Allemand Regiment and the final defection of most of the rank and file on 14 July. Reportedly, only one of the sergeants stood by the officers when they tried to reassemble their men in the courtyard of the Paris barracks of the Guard. Of the six battalions (sub-units of about 600 men each) in the whole of the regiment, the equivalent of only one battalion remained obedient to orders. The mutineers played a key role in the attack on the Bastille, where they were credited with both the effective use of artillery cannons and with preventing a massacre of the garrison after surrender. Following the fall of the Bastille, the Gardes Françaises petitioned to resume their guard duties at Versailles. However, this proposal was declined, and the regiment was formally disbanded on 31 August 1789. On 15 July 1789 all the officers of the Gardes Françaises, led by their colonel, had resigned their commissions. In a letter dated 21 July, addressed to the marquis de Lafayette, King Louis XVI authorized 3,600 rank and file members of the regiment, including the regimental band, to enter the newly raised Garde Bourgeoise. The Gardes Françaises subsequently provided the professional core of the Garde Nationale. As such, they acted under the command of the Marquis de Lafayette to restore order when a mob from Paris invaded the Palace of Versailles at dawn on 6 October 1789, and escorted the Royal Family to Paris in the afternoon of the same day. In October 1792, the former Gardes Françaises were distributed among the new volunteer units that were being mobilised for war. In their final role, the erstwhile royal guardsmen provided cadres (officers and senior non-commissioned officers) for the revolutionary armies of 1792 to 1802. Following the Bourbon restoration of 1814, attempts were made to recreate most of the various military units that had formerly made up the Royal Household. However, the defection of the Gardes Françaises at a crucial point in the revolution could not be forgotten, and no attempt was made to re-establish that regiment. ==Battles== *Saint-Denis (1567) *St. Bartholomew's Day massacre (1572) *Day of the Barricades (1588) *La Rochelle (1627-1628) *Lens (1648) *Fleurus (1690) *Steenkerque (1692) *Ramillies (1706) *Malplaquet (1709) *Dettingen (1743) *Fontenoy (1745) *The Storming of the Bastille (1789) ==Notable members== *Pierre de Montesquiou d'Artagnan *François d'Aubusson de La Feuillade *Charles de Blanchefort *Nicolas Catinat *Abraham de Fabert *Louis Friant *Armand Louis de Gontaut *Antoine III de Gramont *Antoine Galiot Mandat de Grancey *Lazare Hoche *François Joseph Lefebvre *Filippo di Piero Strozzi ===Gallery=== ==References== Category:Guards regiments of France Category:Infantry regiments of the Ancien Régime Category:Military units and formations established in the 1560s Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1789 ","title":"Régiment des Gardes Françaises"},{"id":"2580326","text":"Rosebery is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is 6 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district and is part of the local government areas of the City of Sydney and the Bayside Council. Rosebery has a mix of residential, commercial and industrial developments but the landscape is being redeveloped as high-density housing, displacing many industrial businesses and affecting the heritage of the suburb. This is happening in the northern parts of Rosebery and the adjacent Green Square. ==History== Rosebery was named after Archibald Phillip Primrose, the fifth Earl of Rosebery, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1894–95. The suburb was named in his honour after his visit to Australia for two months in 1883–84. Rosebery was once the site of Rosebery Racecourse, which first opened as a pony track in 1906. Race meetings held by the Associated Racing Clubs became as popular as those at Randwick, especially in the 1920s. The track became an army camp during World War II. After the war, it became a training track used by the Sydney Turf Club. In 1961, much of the land was purchased by the Rosebery Town Planning Company and developed as an industrial area. The housing commission purchased the remaining acres for high density public housing. The area north of Gardeners Road was developed by Richard Stanton (1862–1943) and the same company that developed Haberfield, with the result that Rosebery is known as a 'garden suburb'. Garden competitions were held in the suburb prior to the 1990s. Houses are predominantly single-storey California bungalows, Federation Bungalows or \\"standard\\" suburban detached homes.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, , p.227 ===Trams=== The Rosebery tram line opened in 1902 and initially ran via Chalmers and Redfern Streets and south along Elizabeth Street to Zetland. In 1924, the line was extended to Epsom Road in Rosebery. In 1948, to facilitate construction of the Eastern Suburbs Railway, a new line was constructed down Elizabeth Street between Devonshire Street and Redfern Street and the route was deviated to run down this new section. The line was electrified double track throughout. The line was closed in 1957. ==Demographics== In the 2016 Census, there were 10,117 people in Rosebery. The most common ancestries in Rosebery (NSW) (State Suburbs) were Chinese 15.8%, English 12.8%, Australian 11.7%, Greek 8.3% and Irish 6.7%. 44.0% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were China 11.0%, Greece 3.7%, Indonesia 3.0%, England 2.5% and New Zealand 2.1%. 44.0% of people spoke English only at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 11.1%, Greek 8.8%, Cantonese 3.4%, Indonesian 3.1% and Russian 2.3%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 30.0%, Catholic 23.8% and Eastern Orthodox 12.0%. ==Commercial area== A small shopping centre is located on Gardeners Road. Commercial and industrial developments are also located on and around Botany Road. ==Schools== Gardeners Road Primary School is the public school for the area and is located at the junction of Gardeners Road and Botany Road.Gardeners Road Public School On Rosebery Avenue is the Sydney International Film School. St Joseph's Catholic primary school is on Rosebery Ave. ==Parks== There is a large park in the middle of Rosebery called Turruwul Park, which is bounded by Harcourt Parade and Hayes Road. A smaller park is Crete Reserve, situated at the southern end of Rosebery Avenue. Other small parks are located at Lever Street, where there is a scout hall, and at the corner of Harris and Coward Streets. There is also a park in Kimberley Grove. However, the nighttime lighting of Turruwul Park results in a more active night sport situation. Turruwul Park is the home of the Redfern Raiders Soccer Club. ==Gallery== Image:Rosebery7.JPGCharacteristic Federation Bungalow, Gardeners Road Image:Rosebery10.JPGCalifornia bungalow, Tweedmouth Avenue Image:Rosebery 2.JPGShopping strip, Gardeners Road ==References== Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:Bayside Council ","title":"Rosebery, New South Wales"},{"id":"2580332","text":"The Mortuary Station in Rookwood Cemetery c. 1865 Rookwood is a suburb in western Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia located 14 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Cumberland Council. Rookwood Cemetery is the largest cemetery in the Southern Hemisphere. ==History== Rookwood was named from a title of an 1834 novel by William Harrison Ainsworth (1805–1882). A railway station called Haslam’s Creek was opened in this area in 1859, on the railway line from Sydney to Parramatta. Samuel Haslam owned various grants beside the creek from 1804. Haslam’s Creek was the site of the first railway disaster in New South Wales in July 1858, which resulted in two deaths. When the necropolis opened in 1867, it was known as Haslam’s Creek Cemetery. Residents disliked the association with the burial ground and in 1876 the suburb was renamed Rookwood. The name of the railway station was changed to Rookwood in 1878; and, by the 1880s, shops were established in the area. In 1891, the Municipality of Rookwood was incorporated (renamed Lidcombe in 1913). Over time, the necropolis had become known as Rookwood Cemetery. By 1898, residents were again agitated about the association of their suburb with the cemetery; and, in 1914, the railway station and the residential part of the suburb became Lidcombe. Later, Rookwood railway station that served the Rookwood Cemetery was located between the bridge over Arthur street and the westernmost junction of the Flemington rail yard. The Municipality of Lidcombe amalgamated with Auburn from 1 January 1949. ==Transport== Rookwood railway station was on Sydney's Main Suburban railway line until its closure in 1967. The Rookwood Cemetery Line serviced Rookwood Cemetery and originally ran from Mortuary railway station, on Regent Street near Central railway station but has since closed. The Cemetery railway line opened on 22 October 1864. At the time of its opening the line went as far as Cemetery Station No. 1. On 26 May 1897 an extension of the line to Cemetery Station No. 3 was opened. The extension required the removal of a waiting room on the rear wall of the Cemetery Station No. 1, so the line could pass right through the building. A final extension, to Cemetery Station No. 4 opened on 19 June 1908. The line closed in 1948. ==References== *The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia Category:Suburbs of Sydney

usually the quarterback. The offensive team then attempts to distract and confuse the defense by pretending that a ball carrier is running in one direction while another offensive player retrieves the ball from the turf and runs in a different direction, hoping to gain significant yardage before the defense realizes which player is actually carrying the football. The fumblerooski traces its roots back to deceptive plays from the early days of football, and the infrequent usage of the play and its variations in the modern game often draws much fan and media attention. The NCAA banned the original version of the play following the 1992 season. In the NFL, the play has been considered an \\"intentional forward fumble\\" for many years, which would make the play an incomplete pass, but a version in which the quarterback places the ball behind him is still legal.https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/cs-070201askjerrymarkbreit- story.html ==Description== The fumblerooski typically begins with the quarterback deliberately placing (or in some cases bouncing) the ball on the turf immediately upon receiving the snap from the center, technically fumbling it.Jim Vangordon, the Coach Behind the Trophy\\", New York Times, December 8, 2006. The quarterback then either runs as if he still has the ball or pretends to hand it to another player in an attempt to trick the defense into thinking that the offense is executing a conventional running play, often towards the sideline. Once the flow of the defense is moving away from the ball, a predetermined offensive player (often an offensive lineman) secretly picks it up and runs in a different direction, trying to gain as many yards as possible before the defense realizes that they are not pursuing the actual ball carrier. There are several variations on the play, but they all rely on the element of surprise and misdirection, as the play is easily stopped and a turnover could result if a defender notices the ball being placed on the turf. ==Origin and notable uses== The origin of the fumblerooski goes back to the early days of football, when similar trick plays were relatively common, and has been attributed to pioneering coach John Heisman. An early documented use of the fumblerooski came in 1930, when University of Tennessee quarterback Bobby Dodd called the fumble play in a game against Florida. The play, which Dodd later said he had also run with his high school team, went for a long gain on the Volunteers' only offensive scoring drive during their win. It was also used by Greenville High School during the 1933 Texas High School Football Championship. In the 1984 Orange Bowl game, #1 ranked Nebraska trailed Miami 17–0 after the first quarter. Early in the second quarter, Nebraska coach Tom Osborne called for the play, whereby Nebraska quarterback Turner Gill effectively \\"fumbled\\" the snap from center Mark Traynowicz, by setting it on the turf. The ball was picked up by offensive guard Dean Steinkuhler, who ran the ball 19 yards for a touchdown. Nebraska had run the play before, having first tried it twice in a 17–14 loss to Oklahoma in 1979. Reflecting on the game years later, Miami coach Howard Schnellenberger denounced the use of the play: The play was used by the Oklahoma Sooners four years later in the 1988 Orange Bowl game, also against the Miami Hurricanes, who fell prey to the fumblerooski in a national championship game for a second time. Sooner quarterback Charles Thompson left the ball for offensive guard Mark Hutson, who proceeded to run for a touchdown. Oklahoma, like Nebraska four years earlier, would suffer the same fate in that they would eventually lose to Miami 20–14, costing them their undefeated season and their national championship. On October 20, 1990 Florida State tried to run the play against Auburn in the 4th quarter while holding a 7-point lead. However, an Auburn defender saw the football on the field and fell on the intentional fumble before FSU's guard could get to it. Auburn would score the tying touchdown on the ensuing drive and eventually win on a last-second field goal by Jim Von Wyl, marking one of the very rare occasions that the play failed. Tulane appeared to execute the play for a 21-yard touchdown run against Alabama in a game on October 10, 1992; however, guard Andy Abramowicz's knee was on the ground as he picked up the ball, resulting in him being down at the spot. Nebraska used the play again on October 31, 1992 in a 52–7 victory over Colorado. The ball was carried by offensive guard Will Shields, who gained a first down but did not score. Like the NFL in the 1960s, the NCAA banned the use of the fumblerooski after the 1992 season, making intentional fumbles illegal. In April 2006, the NFHS followed suit, banning intentional fumbles, according to the Los Angeles Times. However, longtime former NFL referee Jerry Markbreit says the play is still legal, provided the quarterback places the ball on the ground behind himself, rather than in front (the forward fumble was banned as the result of another play, the Holy Roller). Direct handoffs to offensive linemen are still thoroughly legal, meaning that the play can still be executed as originally devised, except the ball must be handed off instead of left on the ground to be picked up. Furthermore, since 2008, the center himself can execute the fumble (which in NFL rules is a backward pass, distinct from a fumble) and the ball will be live once the ball hits the ground. On November 23, 2013, the Fresno State Bulldogs successfully executed a fumblerooski on their home field against the New Mexico Lobos, scoring on a 26-yard touchdown run by senior wide receiver Isaiah Burse with 10:27 remaining in the second quarter. The Bulldogs would go on to defeat the Lobos 69–28 and clinch the 2013 Western division of the Mountain West Conference. ==Similar plays== ===Bumerooski=== A variation of the play is known as the Bumerooski. The Bumerooski is named after former NFL head coach Bum Phillips. In this variation a handoff is made to a player between his legs. This play is still legal in the NFL and NCAA as the ball never touches the ground. On December 10, 2006, the San Diego Chargers ran a successful bumerooski, against the Denver Broncos that resulted in a 4-yard touchdown run for fullback Lorenzo Neal's first touchdown of the season. Wide receiver Vincent Jackson was lined up in the backfield with running back LaDainian Tomlinson. The ball was snapped to quarterback Philip Rivers, who handed the ball to Neal between his legs. After the handoff, Rivers and Tomlinson both sprinted right, with Rivers faking a handoff to Jackson faking an end-around right. At the same time, Neal faked a block, and, with the defense still unaware that he had the ball, sprinted left for the touchdown. Bum Phillips' son Wade was the defensive coordinator for the Chargers. In the 2009 Pro Bowl, Le'Ron McClain scored a touchdown on a modified fumblerooski, closely resembling the Bumerooski. The Carolina Panthers used a variation of the bumerooski on December 18, 2011 in a regular season game against the Houston Texans which resulted in a touchdown by fullback Richie Brockel. Newton handed off the ball to Brockel through his legs and faked the run to the right, while Brockel went left. ===Bounce rooski=== Another variation is the \\"bounce rooski\\", in which the quarterback throws a pass behind him that bounces along the ground and to a wide receiver, attempting to fool the defense into thinking it was an incomplete pass. Once the defense is relaxed, the wide receiver (or even an ineligible receiver such as an offensive tackle) can then simply throw it to a player downfield, since a backwards incomplete pass counts as a fumble, and not an incomplete pass. Texas A&M; used this play, calling it the \\"Texas Special\\", in a 1965 game against the University of Texas, taking a 17–0 lead in what was nearly a big upset before eventually falling 21–17. Colorado State used this to upset #10 Wyoming in 1966. Nebraska completed this against Oklahoma in the 1982 NCAA season, with Turner Gill throwing a one-bounce backwards pass to Irving Fryar, who then threw a forward pass to Mitch Krenk. Wisconsin successfully executed this play against Illinois in 1982. During their first game of the 2010 NCAA season, Wake Forest fell for the bounce rooski run by Presbyterian College. Immediately after the snap, Presbyterian quarterback Brandon Miley threw what appeared to be an incomplete short pass to the side, to WR Derrick Overholt. The ball bounced off the ground but into the hands of Overholt, who then feigned disappointment. The Wake Forest defenders fell for Overholt's incomplete-pass theatrics, not realizing the pass was backwards, making it a live ball. Overholt then threw the ball downfield to waiting WR Michael Ruff who was wide open and subsequently ran the ball into the end zone for a 68-yard touchdown. Wake Forest would, however, go on to win the game by a score of 53–13.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1MdEbWaP0U ==In other popular culture== The fumblerooski is featured as a play setting up the climax of the 1994 film Little Giants, in which the Little Giants score on the game's final play. In the film, the play was called \\"The Annexation of Puerto Rico\\", though the opposing coach played by Ed O'Neill correctly identifies the play, shouting \\"Fumblerooski! Fumblerooski!\\" This scene later served as the inspiration for the aforementioned December 2011 play by the Carolina Panthers. The fumblerooski was used in the 2005 remake of The Longest Yard to bring the prisoners within one point of the officers on the last play of regulation (pending the two-point conversion). It was also featured in the 2008 film The Longshots, starring Ice Cube. ==See also== * American football strategy *Hidden ball trick * Flea flicker (American football) * Holy Roller (American football) * Statue of Liberty play * Trick play ==References== Category:American football plays Category:Nebraska Cornhuskers football ","title":"Fumblerooski"},{"id":"2580347","text":"Rodd Point is a suburb in the Inner WestAustralian Suburb Guide: Sydney Inner West Retrieved 8 August 2013. of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia.

Rodd had a large family of 12 children and many of the local streets are named after members of the Rodd family: Brent, Brisbane, Burnell, Clements, Janet, Lenore, Rodd, Trevanion and Undine. Barnstaple Road takes its name from Barnstaple Manor, Rodd's family home which in turn took its name from his birthplace in Britain. The Rodd Point memorial in Rodd Park was originally the Rodd family mausoleum. The bodies were moved to Rookwood Cemetery in 1903. Rodd Island, which is close to Rodd Point, is also named after Brent Clements Rodd.

Deaerators are commonly used to remove dissolved gases in feedwater for steam-generating boilers. Dissolved oxygen in feedwater will cause serious corrosion damage in a boiler by attaching to the walls of metal piping and other equipment and forming oxides (like rust). Dissolved carbon dioxide combines with water to form carbonic acid that may cause further corrosion. Most deaerators are designed to remove oxygen down to levels of 7 ppb by weight or less, as well as essentially eliminating carbon dioxide. The deaerators in the steam generating systems of most thermal power plants use low pressure steam obtained from an extraction point in their steam turbine system. However, the steam generators in many large industrial facilities such as petroleum refineries may use whatever low-pressure steam is available. Deaerators are also used to remove dissolved gases from products such as food, personal care products, cosmetic products, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals to increase the dosing accuracy in the filling process, to increase product shelf stability, to prevent oxidative effects (e.g. discolouration, changes of smell or taste, rancidity), to alter pH, and to reduce packaging volume. Cochrane and Permutit are two of the oldest Deaerator Manufacturers in the USA. ==Types== There are many different deaerators available from a number of manufacturers, and the actual construction details will vary from one manufacturer to another. There are these basic types of deaerators: * The thermal deaerators **The spray & tray-type (also called the cascade-type) includes a vertical or horizontal domed deaeration section mounted on top of a horizontal cylindrical vessel which serves as the deaerated boiler feedwater storage tank. ** The spray-type consists only of a horizontal (or vertical) cylindrical vessel which serves as both the deaeration section, and a storage tank for boiler feedwater. * The vacuum rotating disc deaerators for low to high viscous products * The ultrasound deaerator for very viscous products Figures 1 and 2 are representative schematic diagrams that depict each of the two major types of deaerators. ===Spray and tray-type deaerator=== Figure 1: A schematic diagram of a typical tray-type deaerator. The typical spray & tray-type deaerator in Figure 1 has a vertical domed deaeration section mounted above a horizontal boiler feedwater storage vessel. Boiler feedwater enters the vertical deaeration section through spray valves above the perforated trays and then flows downward through the perforations. Low-pressure deaeration steam enters below the perforated trays and flows upward through the perforations. Combined action of spray valves & trays guarantees very high performance because of longer contact time between steam and water. Some designs use various types of packed beds, rather than perforated trays, to provide good contact and mixing between the steam and the boiler feed water. The steam strips the dissolved gas from the boiler feedwater and exits via the vent valve at the top of the domed section. Should this vent valve not be opened sufficiently the deaerator will not work properly, causing high oxygen content in the feed water going to the boilers. Should the boiler not have an oxygen-content analyser, a high level in the boiler chlorides may indicate the vent valve not being far enough open. Some designs may include a vent condenser to trap and recover any water entrained in the vented gas. The vent line usually includes a valve and just enough steam is allowed to escape with the vented gases to provide a small visible telltale plume of steam. The deaerated water flows down into the horizontal storage vessel from where it is pumped to the steam generating boiler system. Low-pressure heating steam, which enters the horizontal vessel through a sparge pipe in the bottom of the vessel, is provided to keep the stored boiler feedwater warm. External insulation of the vessel is typically provided to minimize heat loss. ===Spray-type deaerator=== Figure 2: A schematic diagram of a typical spray-type deaerator. As shown in Figure 2, the typical spray-type deaerator is a horizontal vessel which has a preheating section (E) and a deaeration section (F). The two sections are separated by a baffle (C). Low-pressure steam enters the vessel through a sparger in the bottom of the vessel. The boiler feedwater is sprayed into section (E) where it is preheated by the rising steam from the sparger. The purpose of the feedwater spray nozzle (A) and the preheat section is to heat the boiler feedwater to its saturation temperature to facilitate stripping out the dissolved gases in the following deaeration section. The preheated feedwater then flows into the deaeration section (F), where it is deaerated by the steam rising from the sparger system. The gases stripped out of the water exit via the vent at the top of the vessel. Again, some designs may include a vent condenser to trap and recover any water entrained in the vented gas. Also again, the vent line usually includes a valve and just enough steam is allowed to escape with the vented gases to provide a small and visible telltale plume of steam. The deaerated boiler feedwater is pumped from the bottom of the vessel to the steam generating boiler system. Silencers (optional) have been used for reducing venting noise levels in the Deaerator equipment industry. Welding of the steel pressure vessels during the manufacturing process sometimes require Post Weld Heat Treatment, XRAY, Dye Penetration, Ultrasonic, and other type non-destructive testing. ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, NACE International, and HEI (Heat Exchange Institute) have recommendations on the type of testing required. ===Vacuum rotating disc type deaerator=== As shown in Figure 3, the product is distributed as a thin layer on a high speed spinning disc [3] via special feed system [1]. The centrifugal force slings it through a perforated screen onto the inner wall of the vessel, which is under vacuum . Air (gas) pockets are released in the process and are drawn off by the vacuum [4]. A discharge pump [2] carries the deaerated product to the next process in the production line. For high viscous products the rotating disc is replaced with static one. Figure 3: A schematic diagram of rotating disc deaerator ==Principles of operation== Deaeration relies on the principle that the solubility of a gas in water decreases as the water temperature increases and approaches its boiling point. In the deaerator, water is heated up to close to its boiling point with a minimum pressure drop and minimum vent. Deaeration is done by spraying feedwater into a chamber to increase its surface area, and may involve flow over multiple layers of trays. This scrubbing (or stripping) steam is fed to the bottom of the deaeration section of the deaerator. When steam contacts the feedwater, it heats it up to its boiling point and dissolved gases are released from the feedwater and vented from the deaerator through the vent. The treated water falls into a storage tank below the deaerator. ===Oxygen scavenging=== Oxygen scavenging chemicals are very often added to the deaerated boiler feedwater to remove any last traces of oxygen that were not removed by the deaerator. The type of chemical added depends on whether the location uses a volatile or non-volatile water treatment program. Most lower pressure systems (lower than ) use non-volatile treatment programs. The most commonly used oxygen scavenger for lower pressure systems is sodium sulfite (Na2SO3). It is very effective and rapidly reacts with traces of oxygen to form sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) which is non-scaling. Most higher pressure systems (higher than ) and all systems where certain highly alloyed materials are present are now using volatile programs, as many phosphate-based treatment programs are being phased out. Volatile programs are further broken down into oxidizing or reducing programs [(AVT(O) or AVT(R)] depending whether the environment requires an oxidizing or reducing environment to reduce the incidence of flow-accelerated corrosion. Flow- accelerated corrosion related failures have caused numerous accidents in which significant loss of property and life has occurred. Hydrazine (N2H4) is an oxygen scavenger commonly used in volatile treatment programs. Other scavengers include carbohydrazide, diethylhydroxylamine, nitrilotriacetic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and hydroquinone. ==See also== * Air preheater * Economizer * Feedwater heater * Fossil fuel power plant * Thermal power station * Degasification * Defoamer ==References== ===Citations=== ===Sources=== * * * ==External links== *Association of Water Technologies *Deaerator design *Vacuum deaerator Category:Power station technology Category:Chemical equipment Category:Nuclear power plant components Category:Gas-liquid separation ","title":"Deaerator"},{"id":"2580399","text":"Linda Eisenstein is an American playwright and composer. ==Career== Linda Eisenstein is an author, composer, journalist and activist for the rights of women playwrights.

The camp operates as a non-profit organization and is affiliated with the Jewish Community Center Association. The camp is located in Groveland, California, although the nearest town is actually a tiny area called Buck Meadows. Tawonga has its main office in San Francisco. Many attendees come from the San Francisco Bay Area, but attendees from Israel, Los Angeles, and other states are often present as well. ==History== Camp Tawonga was established by Louis and Emma Blumenthal in 1925 and was originally established in 1928 as separate camps known as Camp Kelowa for Boys, and Singing Trail for Girls at Huntington Lake just below the alpine level at 7,000 feet, located in the High Sierras, 65 miles Northeast of Fresno, and closed for several years during the Second World War. Camp Tawonga moved to its current site on the middle fork of the Tuolumne River in 1963. During 2003-2007, Camp Tawonga ran the Oseh Shalom-Sanea al Salam—the Palestinian-Jewish Family Peacemakers Camp—in cooperation with the Jewish- Palestinian Living Room Dialogue.[Terror in the Holy Land: Inside the Anguish of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, Judith Kuriansky, editor. Connecticut: Praeger Publishers, 2006, p. 260] On July 3, 2013, a tree fell at the camp, killing an Arts and Crafts specialist and injuring several others as campers were evacuated to the girls' side field. In August 2013, the camp was in the path of the Rim Fire. After the camp was evacuated, a staff member returned to the camp to rescue a Torah scroll which had previously survived the Holocaust. The camp lost three buildings to the fire; other damage was described as repairable and is now rebuilt. Late 2015, Camp Tawonga announced a director transfer. Ken Kramarz, the former Executive Director, moved into Tawonga's future. Jamie Simon, the former Camp Director, assumed Kramarz's position. Former Assistant Director, Becca Meyer, took on a new role as Camp Director. On July 31, 2018, just two days into the last summer session of the year, all of Camp Tawonga evacuated due to dangerous air quality caused by the local Ferguson Fire and the firefighters' \\"back burning\\" techniques. ==Facility== Camp Tawonga's capacity is about 250 attendees at one time during the summer, with about 2,000 attendees and staff participating each year. There are around 30 rustic-style cabins without electricity, running water, and heating, used for campers in the summer. There are around 20 heated or powered cabins that are used for other guests. There is a lodge-style dining hall equipped with a Kosher kitchen and back porch overlooking a lake. An Arts-and-Crafts shed, Olympic sized swimming pool, team building ropes course, and outdoor amphitheater are just some of Tawonga's many on-site buildings.

It is 56 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Penrith, and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. It is located on the eastern bank of the Nepean River, just south of Jamisontown. ==History== ===European settlement=== Following the arrival of the First Fleet land was granted to British settlers by the colonial administration. The first land grant in this area was to the Irish- born Surgeon-General of New South Wales, Thomas Jamison, who had arrived in 1788 aboard the Sirius. After Thomas' death in London in 1811, the land (at what is now Jamisontown) was taken up by his son, John, also a surgeon, who had served under Admiral Horatio Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar, and was knighted for his medical services to the Royal Navy by the Prince Regent of the United Kingdom, later King George IV, in 1813. Sir John Jamison arrived in Sydney in 1814 and progressively established himself during the ensuing two decades as one of the colony's biggest and wealthiest land owners. In 1823-24, he built a magnificent Georgian-style, sandstone mansion on a rise overlooking the Nepean River. He named the mansion Regentville House in honour of the Prince Regent. Sir John held so many lavish balls, banquets and other social activities at the mansion that he became known as the \\"hospitable knight of Regentville\\". He later erected a multi-storey tweed mill on his extensive estate and established a dairy, a thoroughbred horse stud, ornamental gardens, a cemetery, and a school for the children of his work force. Other parts of the estate were given over to an orchard, a terraced vineyard, and grazing paddocks for sheep and cattle. Sir John died at Regentville House in 1844, aged 68, having lost much of his fortune in a severe economic downturn then afflicting the colony. He is buried in St Stephen's churchyard, Penrith. The Regentville estate passed to his children but the land was gradually sold off in chunks, following an acrimonious inheritance dispute. Regentville House was later turned into an asylum and then leased out as a hotel. Sadly, however, it burned down in suspicious circumstances in 1868. Today, only the house's cellars and drains survive, along with some meagre sections of its masonry walls. Sir John's tweed mill has disappeared, too, but the overgrown terracing of the estate's vineyard can still be discerned. The area around the site of Regentville House has remained largely rural, if hemmed in somewhat by the modern residential suburbs of Jamisontown and Glenmore Park. It has been the subject of archaeological excavations undertaken by the University of Sydney and images of the house are extant in various public and private collections. Regentville Post Office opened on 1 October 1953 and closed in 1979. === Heritage listings === Regentville has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 427 Mulgoa Road: Glenleigh Estate ==Transport== Mulgoa Road is the main road in the suburb, connecting with both Penrith and the M4 Western Motorway which in turn provides quick connection to greater Sydney and the Blue Mountains. The nearest railway station is at Penrith on the Western Line of the Sydney Trains network. Busways provides three bus services in the area with the 799 connecting the majority of Regentville with both Glenmore Park and Penrith, while Route 797 and Route 795 travels along Mulgoa Road towards Glenmore Park and Warragamba/Wallacia respectively. ==Education== The only school in the suburb is Regentville Public School. The nearest high school is located in Glenmore Park. ==Population== === Demographics === The recorded population of Regentville in the 2006 census was just 714. The majority of residents are Australian born (81%) with small minorities born in England (4%) and Malta (2%). The most common religious affiliation is Anglican (34%), almost double the national average, followed by Catholic (32%), those with no religion (9.2%), Presbyterian (3.8%) and Jehovah's Witnesses (2.2%). The median income ($535 per week) was slightly higher than the national average ($466). ==Governance== At a local government level, Regentville is part of the south ward of Penrith City Council, represented by Jim Aitken, Mark Davies, Karen McKeown, Susan Page and Gary Rumble.

It is part of the Macarthur region. ==History== Raby took its name from Raby Road. In 1976, the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales approved the name 'Raby', using the justification that the new suburb was to be located off Raby Road, which for more than 150 years had trailed across the hills linking the old Riley family property to Campbelltown. ==European settlement== Alexander Riley (1778-1833) was a merchant and pastoralist who in 1809 was granted on the corner of Bringelly and Cowpasture Roads. He called his estate Raby in honour of his mother, who had been Miss Margaret Raby. Apparently \\"Raby\\" had also been the name of a family property in England. He used his new Australian farm for sheep breeding, and also introduced the first cashmere goats into the colony. As a suburb of Campbelltown, Raby began to be developed as private subdivisions in the late 1970s. In 1978, the City of Campbelltown Council decided to use \\"airplanes of the world\\" as its theme to name the new streets being created. The first land releases were located between three roads named in honour of famous fighter planes - Mustang Drive, Sopwith Avenue and Spitfire Drive. By the early 1990s, most of the suburb had been completed, although a few pockets were still being released. As late as March 1992, Council was allocating additional street names such as Arrow Place and Skyfarmer Place on the site of the old Heathfield Public School which is adjacent to the Raby Shopping Complex. This was not only the name of a farm which stood on the site in the 1970s, but was also the name of the Landcom estate that saw the creation of nearby streets. ==Landmarks== The old Bunbury- Curran Creek has now been developed as Raby Sports Complex, used by Campbelltown-Camden District Cricket Club as its home ground in the Sydney Grade Cricket competition, and Sunderland Reserve (named after an adjoining road). An old farm dam has been retained as Lake Burrendah Reserve, which is Aboriginal for \\"place of the swan\\". Nearby Kooringa Reserve is derived from the Koori word for \\"sheoak.\\" Blain Reserve notes an old family which had lived in the area since the 1800s. ==Schools== The first school in the suburb was Heathfield Public School, which was named after a local farm owned by the Blain family. Heathfield Public School stood in demountable classrooms to the west of the modern site of Raby shopping centre, off Hurricane Drive. This temporary school closed in 1986, when Robert Townson Public School opened to replace it. The original site of Heathfield Public School was subdivided for residential housing developments. Robert Townson Public School opened in 1986 under Principal Lyle Whan. The school motto is 'Aim High', which is encapsulated in the school's commitment to pursuing excellence in all teaching/learning programs with high expectations of student success and broad based opportunities for all students across the Key Learning Areas. Robert Townson High School opened in 1987, is a comprehensive co-educational high school serving the needs of students from the surrounding areas of St Andrews, Kearns and Varroville. The school motto \\"We Strive to Achieve\\" encourages students to achieve their very best. Both Robert Townson Public School and Robert Townson High School take their name from a local pioneer. The geographic location of the schools foster a close partnership between them which supports an effective transition process for students moving from primary to secondary schooling. Mount Carmel High School, is a local Catholic school situated on a large area of land at the foot of the neighbouring suburb of Varroville and adjacent to Mount Carmel Catholic Parish. ==Population== Demographics (2016 Census): * Population: 5,944 * Australian Born: 71.7% * Main Overseas Birthplace: United Kingdom 3%, India 1.7%, New Zealand 1.7% * Main Religions: Catholic 32.2%, Anglican 18.3%, Islam 5.8% ==References== ==External links== * History of Varroville * History of Raby * Campbelltown City Council community profile * Alexander Riley * Robert Townson Public School Web Site Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:City of Campbelltown (New South Wales) ","title":"Raby, New South Wales"},{"id":"2580469","text":"From Sea to Sea and Other Sketches, Letters of Travel is a book containing Rudyard Kipling's articles about his 1889 travels from India to Burma, China, Japan, and the United States en route to England.

It is a member of the substituted amphetamine, substituted cathinone and substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamine classes. Methylone is the substituted cathinone analog of MDMA and the 3,4-methylenedioxy analog of methcathinone. The only structural difference of methylone with respect to MDMA is the substitution of 2 hydrogen atoms by 1 oxygen atom in the β position of the phenethylamine core, forming a ketone group. Methylone was first synthesized by the chemists Peyton Jacob III and Alexander Shulgin in 1996 for potential use as an antidepressant. Methylone has been sold for recreational use, taking advantage of the absence of legal prohibition of this compound in many countries . == Effects == === Resemblance to MDMA === Structural similarities between some amphetamine-like stimulants and their 3,4-methylenedioxy- derivatives. Left: amphetamine, methamphetamine and methcathinone. Right: MDA, MDMA, and methylone Methylone substitutes for MDMA in rats trained to discriminate MDMA from saline. Methylone does not substitute for amphetamine or for the hallucinogenic DOM in animals trained to discriminate between these drugs and saline.TA Dal Cason, R Young, RA Glennon. Cathinone: an investigation of several N-alkyl and methylenedioxy-substituted analogs. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 58, 1109–1116 (1997) Further, also in common with MDMA, methylone acts on monoaminergic systems. In vitro, methylone has one third the potency of MDMA at inhibiting platelet serotonin accumulation and about the same in its inhibiting effects on the dopamine and noradrenaline transporters.NV Cozzi, MK Sievert, AT Shulgin, P Jacob III, AE Ruoho. Methcathinone and 2 methylamino-1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)propan-1-one (methylone) selectively inhibit plasma membrane catecholamine reuptake transporters. Soc. Neurosci. Abs., 24, 341.8 (1998).NV Cozzi, AT Shulgin, AE Ruoho. Methcathinone (MCAT) and 2-methylamino-1-(3,4 methylenedioxyphenyl)propan-1-one (MDMCAT) inhibit [3H]serotonin uptake into human platelets. Amer. Chem. Soc. Div. Med. Chem. Abs., 215, 152 (1998). In spite of these behavioral and pharmacological similarities between methylone and MDMA, the observed subjective effects of both drugs are not completely identical. Alexander Shulgin wrote of the former: == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Methylone acts as a mixed reuptake inhibitor/releasing agent of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. In comparison to MDMA, it has approximately 3x lower affinity for the serotonin transporter, while its affinity for the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters is similar. Notably, methylone's affinity for the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is about 13x lower than that of MDMA. The results of these differences in pharmacology relative to MDMA are that methylone is less potent in terms of dose, has more balanced catecholaminergic effects relative to serotonergic, and behaves more like a reuptake inhibitor like methylphenidate than a releaser like amphetamine; however, methylone has relatively robust releasing capabilities, perhaps due to its ability to phosphorylate the monoamine transporters being similar in potency relative to MDMA. === Pharmacokinetics === The two major metabolic pathways in mammals for methylone are N-demethylation to methylenedioxycathinone (MDC), and demethylation followed by O-methylation of the 3- or 4-hydroxy group to 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethcathinone (HMMC) or 3-hydroxy-4-methoxymethcathinone (3-OH-4-MeO-MC). When 5 mg/kg of methylone was administered to rats, it was found that around 26% was excreted as HMMC within the first 48 hours (less than 3% excreted unchanged).Xenobioica.

Because methylone is not registered officially, it is forbidden to trade in methylone. The Minister of Health has asked the Coordination point Assessment and Monitoring new drugs group (CAM) to gather information about this substance, resulting possibly in an official risk assessment.van Amsterdam et al., 2004 Until now, no research has been conducted on the toxicity of methylone, so nothing is known about the harmfulness of this new drug. ===New Zealand=== In New Zealand, although methylone is not explicitly scheduled and falls outside the strict definitions of an \\"amphetamine analogue\\" in the Misuse of Drugs Act, it is considered to be \\"substantially similar\\" to methcathinone and is thus considered by law enforcement authorities to be a Class C illegal drug. Methylone was sold in New Zealand for around 6 months from November 2005 to April 2006 as an MDMA substitute, under the name \\"Ease\\". The product was withdrawn after legal disputes with the government.\\"EASE trial terminated after conflicting advice,\\" scoop.co.nz (April 9, 2006). ===UK=== In the UK, methylone is illegal since the 16/04/2010 revision of the misuse of drugs act. Before this it was not specifically mentioned in United Kingdom (U.K.) law as the β-ketone was not covered under the Misuse of Drugs Act. In March 2010, plans were announced to make methylone and other cathinones, Class B drugs, \\"within weeks\\". While delayed by dissatisfaction in the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, the revision was rushed through by the government with little regard for the views of the council. The importation of the compounds was banned immediately. ===Sweden=== Sveriges riksdag added methylone to schedule I (\\"substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use\\") as narcotics in Sweden as of Oct 1, 2010, published by Medical Products Agency in their regulation LVFS 2010:23 listed as Metylon, 2-metylamino-1-(3,4-metylendioxifenyl)propan-1-on. Methylone was first classified by Sveriges riksdags health ministry Statens folkhälsoinstitut as \\"health hazard\\" under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of Nov 1, 2005, in their regulation SFS 2005:733 listed as 3,4-metylendioximetkatinon (Metylon). ===Canada=== Although not listed as a Schedule 1 substance, Health Canada reports that methylone falls under the scheduling as an analogue of amphetamine. However, Methylone bears the exact chemical difference between amphetamine and cathinone – and cathinone is listed as not being an analogue of amphetamine, possibly implying that methylone is unscheduled in Canada. The CDSA was updated as a result of the Safe Streets Act changing amphetamines from Schedule 3 to Schedule 1; however, methylone was not added. ===United States=== As of October 21, 2011 the DEA has issued an emergency ban on methylone. It is illegal to possess and distribute. * Arizona: ::Effective February 16, 2012, methylenedioxymethcathinone (methylone) was classified as a dangerous drug, making it a felony to knowingly possess, use, possess for sale, manufacture, administer, transport for sale, import into the state, or offer to transport for sale or import into this state, sell, transfer or offer to sell or transfer. A.R.S. 13-3401(6)(c)(xliii), 2012 Ariz. Legis. Serv. Ch. 1 (H.B. 2356). * Florida: ::In January 2011, it was reported that Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi issued an emergency ban on MDPV, Methylone, Mephedrone, 3-methoxymethcathinon, 3-fluoromethcathinone, and 4-fluoromethcathinone as media attention on products labeled as \\"bath salts\\" grew. These chemicals are now Schedule I under Florida law. * Louisiana: ::In January 2011, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal emergency scheduled 3,4-methylenedioxymethcathinone (methylone), 3,4-methyenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), 4-methylmethcathinone (mephedrone), 4-methoxymethcathinone (methedrone), 4-fluoromethcathinone (flephedrone), and 3-fluoromethcathinone (3-FMC). * Tennessee: ::On May 5, 2011, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam signed a law making it a crime to knowingly produce, manufacture, distribute, sell, offer for sale or possess with intent produce, manufacture, distribute, sell, or offer for sale any product containing 3,4-methylenedioxymethcathinone (methylone), 3,4-methyenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), 4-methylmethcathinone (mephedrone), 4-methoxymethcathinone (methedrone), 4-fluoromethcathinone (flephedrone), and 3-fluoromethcathinone (3-FMC). * Texas: ::In September 2011, Texas added 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylcathinone to the Penalty Group 2 listing of the Health and Safety Code. Possession of a substance in penalty group 2 is a minimum of a state jail felony. * Michigan: ::Schedule 1 controlled substance in 2012. As of 4/12/2013 the DEA placed Methylone as a Schedule 1 substance under the CSA. == Etymology == \\"Methylone\\" is also a trademarked brand name for an injectable form of methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid hormone used to treat arthritis and severe allergic reactions; hence, methylone may be confused with it. Aside from context, they can be distinguished by the fact that the name will usually be capitalized when referring to the prescription drug. A proposed alternate name is βk-MDMA, or beta-keto-MDMA. While this nomenclature has not caught on because the name \\"methylone\\" became widely used before the conflicting Methylone trademark was noticed, the analogous names for related chemicals βk-MDEA and βk-MBDB have become the established names for those substances. == References == Category:Benzodioxoles Category:Cathinones Category:Designer drugs Category:Entactogens and empathogens Category:Euphoriants Category:Serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agents ","title":"Methylone"},{"id":"2580494","text":"The Epicranium is the medical term for the collection of structures covering the cranium.

He contributes to the \\"Economic View\\" column, which appears every fifth Sunday in The New York Times. Frank has published on the topic of wealth inequality in the United States. ==Career== Born in Coral Gables, Florida, in either 1939 or 1945. Frank graduated from Coral Gables High School in 1962.\\"Robert H. Frank\\". Who's Who in America, 65th edition. Accessed via LexisNexis on March 25, 2013. Frank received a B.S. in mathematics from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1966, M.A. in statistics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1971, and Ph.D. in economics from UC Berkeley in 1972. Until 2001, he was the Goldwin Smith Professor of Economics, Ethics, and Public Policy in the Cornell University College of Arts and Sciences. For the 2008–09 academic year, Frank was a visiting professor at the New York University Stern School of Business. Frank has also been a Peace Corps volunteer in rural Nepal, the chief economist for the Civil Aeronautics Board, a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (1992 to 1993), and a Professor of American Civilization at École des hautes études en sciences sociales in Paris (2000–01). In 2008, Frank received an honorary doctorate in Economics from the University of St. Gallen ==Notable theories== ===Positional arms race=== This theory is an analytical examination of the socioeconomic concept of keeping up with the Joneses and conspicuous consumption. His book Choosing the Right Pond discusses the importance of status, and how much people pay for status. Frank argues that the race for status is bad for society as a whole, as there cannot be improvement in overall status available, because every time person A rises above person B, the sum of their status remains the same. The only thing that changes is which person is where in the hierarchy. He reasons that this race for status explains partly why increases in wealth do not increase well-being, or do not increase it much. According to Frank, if most earnings are spent on pursuing status, there will not be much improvement in intrinsic quality of life. ===Winner take all=== In his book The Winner-Take-All Society, he discusses the contemporary trend toward concentration of wealth. He argues that more and more of the current economy and other institutions are moving toward a state where very few winners take very much, while the rest are left with little. He attributes this, in part, to the modern structure of markets and technology. ===The strategic role of emotions=== In various economic papers and in the book Passions Within Reason, he discusses the idea that emotions have important roles in decision making and personal interactions, even when they seem to be irrational. For example, the emotions of love give more value to long term romantic commitment. A \\"rational\\" person would dump his partner as soon as he found a better partnership. Emotional attachment gives more long term meaning to the relationship. Put poetically: \\"Those sensible about love are incapable of it.\\" Similarly, anger can be used as a precommitment device. Frank states that envy can be useful in that it enforces more fair distributions. By acting \\"irrationally\\" when treated unfairly, a person can obtain better results in situations which resemble the ultimatum game if their opponent anticipates their emotional response and adjusts their strategy accordingly. ===Prisoner's dilemma and cooperation=== Frank, Gilovich, and Regan (1993) conducted an experimental study of the prisoner's dilemma. The subjects were students in their first and final years of undergraduate economics, and undergraduates in other disciplines. Subjects were paired, placed in a typical game scenario, then asked to choose either to \\"cooperate\\" or to \\"defect\\". Pairs of subjects were told that if they both chose \\"defect\\" the payoff for each would be 1. If both cooperated, the payoff for each would be 2. If one defected and the other cooperated, the payoff would be 3 for the defector and 0 for the cooperator. Each subject in a pair made his choice without knowing what the other member of the pair chose. First year economics students, and students doing disciplines other than economics, overwhelmingly chose to cooperate. But 4th year students in economics tended to not cooperate. Frank et al. concluded, that with \\"an eye toward both the social good and the well-being of their own students, economists may wish to stress a broader view of human motivation in their teaching.\\" ===Negative effects of studying economics=== In a highly cited work, Frank showed that the study of economics reduces cooperation in games. The idea is that much of the time cooperation and consideration of other's perspective are irrational in the narrow sense of the word. Thus, learning that cooperation is irrational in some situations is influencing the behavior of the students towards less cooperation, presumably to the negative. ==Publications== === Books === * Choosing the Right Pond: Human Behavior and the Quest for Status.

The crime drama ending has a few shocking and unexpected moments. This film is now in the public domain. ==Plot== Former soldier Frank Prior arrives in London to visit a wartime girlfriend, whom he hasn't seen in six years. His plane's landing at the airport coincides with a fellow passenger being killed by a sniper. Scotland Yard inspector Braddock and detective Cameron are assigned to investigate. The dead man, identified as Kendal Brown, is carrying forged documents as well as a photograph that leads them to Pauline French, an actress. Pauline is the woman Frank has come to see. She also happens to be an expert marksman with a rifle. After they kiss, Pauline tells Frank that she had tried unsuccessfully to notify him to delay his visit. An autographed picture of another actress, Helene Castle, is found in Kendal Brown's flat. The detectives learn that Helene is the victim's ex-wife. In the meantime, Frank spends a few hours with Pauline on her boat. When they later go to a pub, a limping man seems to menace and unnerve Pauline, who runs away. Pauline confesses to Frank that she once let Kendal Brown use her boat for a smuggling operation. He began blackmailing her with letters she wrote, which Helene now possesses. At the theatre, the limping man turns out to be George, the stage manager. But to everyone's shock, the late Kendal Brown turns up very much alive. The victim on the plane was a man he'd hired to impersonate him. After knocking the limping man unconscious, Kendal Brown ends up in a fistfight with Frank in the theatre's balcony. But as these events reach their climax, a huge surprise is revealed, one involving Frank and his fellow passengers from the plane. == Cast == == External links == * ==References== Category:1953 films Category:British films Category:English-language films Category:Film noir Category:Films directed by Cy Endfield Category:Films based on British novels Category:British crime films Category:Films set in England Category:Films set in London Category:1953 crime films Category:Lippert Pictures films ","title":"The Limping Man (1953 film)"},{"id":"2580510","text":"Birch River in Nicholas County in 2007 The Birch River is a tributary of the Elk River in rural central West Virginia in the United States, on the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau.

The station is owned by Denali Media Holdings, a subsidiary of local cable provider GCI. KTVA's transmitter is located in Spenard—covering the Anchorage bowl and much of the adjacent Matanuska-Susitna Valley. KTVA was affiliated with CBS from its sign-on in December 1953. That relationship ended on July 31, 2020, when the CBS affiliation in Anchorage was moved to KYES-TV (channel 5) as that station's parent company, Gray Television, acquired KTVA's non-license assets.\\"GCI announces sale of broadcast business\\", KTVA.com, 31 July 2020. KTVA signed off on September 3, 2020 after the completion of the transition, and its fate is currently unknown. In the past, KTVA was a partner of the service of low-power translators through the Alaska Rural Communications Service (ARCS). ==History== Station's logo until early 2020; for the last few months it existed in the year, the red logo in the infobox was utilized. Legendary Alaskan broadcast pioneer August G. \\"Augie\\" Hiebert (1916–2007) applied for the license in May 1953 through his company, Northern Television. He received FCC approval for construction permits in July 1953, and KTVA signed on the air on December 11, 1953 broadcasting (initially from 2 p.m. to 11:30 p.m.). The studio and office were originally housed on the first floor and the transmitter on top of the pink 14-story McKinley Tower, with an analog signal on VHF channel 11./ The station aired a few NBC programs in the late 1960s, until KHAR-TV (channel 13, now ABC affiliate KYUR) took the NBC affiliation in 1970. The station was a DuMont affiliate in the early 1950s. KTVA also carried Sesame Street from 1970 until PBS member station KAKM (channel 7) signed on in 1975. On January 3, 1971, KTVA aired Anchorage's first-ever live satellite broadcast from the U.S. mainland, the 1970 NFC Championship Game. Until the 1980s, when the networks went to full satellite distribution, KTVA and other TV stations in Alaska aired network programming on a tape-delayed basis via kinescoped and, later, videotaped recordings of network programs provided by fellow CBS affiliate KIRO-TV in Seattle (and KING-TV during KTVA's NBC affiliation), which were then flown to Alaska. Hiebert retired in 1997, and three years later in 2000, KTVA was acquired by the newspaper publisher MediaNews Group.http://peninsulaclarion.com/stories/032900/ala_032900ala0040001.shtml Retrieved November 14, 2013 KTVA brought in $6.8 million of revenue in 2009, second to NBC affiliate KTUU-TV (channel 2) with $10 million (40% of the market). On November 9, 2012, GCI, through subsidiary Denali Media Holdings, announced plans to purchase KTVA, as well as KATH-LD and KSCT-LP in Southeast Alaska. The Federal Communications Commission approved the deal on October 29, 2013. The sale was formally closed on November 1.https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn;=101587216&formid;=905&fac;_num=49632 On December 2, 2013, KTVA moved to a new high definition-capable studio on the second floor of the headquarters of the Anchorage Daily News, and unveiled a new set and logo. KTVA became the first television station in Alaska to broadcast local news in high definition. In 2017, KTVA was received a prestigious James Beard Award for its Harvesting Alaska series, beating out CBS This Morning and WLS-TV in Chicago. KTVA has also received many accolades, including an Emmy, RTNDA awards, NPPA awards, Alaska Press Club awards and Alaska 'Goldie' Awards. Channel 11's studios were severely damaged following major earthquakes that hit Anchorage on the morning of November 30, 2018, which also knocked the station off the air. Part of the structure, equipment and water were strewn about the facility, which one reporter for the station called \\"absolutely destroyed.\\" In 2020, GCI/Denali Media Holdings announced their intention to sell its broadcast holdings. Atlanta-based Gray Television, which already owned KTUU-TV and KYES-TV (channel 5) in Anchorage, and NBC affiliate KTVF in Fairbanks, purchased KATH-LD and KSCT-LP in May.https://www.rbr.com/gray-grabs-nbc-se-alaska/ On July 31, Gray and GCI/Denali announced that the former company had acquired KTVA's non-license assets, including its news department and CBS affiliation, and would move that programming to KYES-TV; the on-air transfer took place that same day. As Gray already owned two full-power stations in Anchorage, it could not directly purchase nor operate KTVA; a GCI spokesperson said that it had not determined its plans for the KTVA license and facilities. However, KYES-TV was simulcast on KTVA for a period for the benefit of viewers. On August 13, KYES-TV's CBS service permanently moved to GCI channel 5, while KYES-DT4, which also launched on August 1 and carries the former primary schedule and MyNetworkTV affiliation of KYES-TV, moved to GCI channel 11. After the final newscast for the KTVA news operation aired on August 30, 2020, the station notified the FCC it would go dark as of September 3, as it searches for a buyer. It stated that the expected time off the air is 6 months, although it must resume broadcasting by September 3, 2021 to avoid automatic cancellation of its license. Its website was then directed to a new combined KTUU/KYES website, with that news operation now known as \\"Alaska's News Source\\". ==Digital television== ===Analog-to-digital conversion=== KTVA shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 28. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 11. ==News operation== KTVA broadcast 22 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with four hours each weekday and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays). Weekday news offerings included a one- hour morning newscast called Daybreak at 6 a.m. with an additional hour at 9 a.m. (which premiered on September 12, 2016), two half-hour evening newscasts at 5 p.m. and 10 p.m. and a one-hour newscast at 6 p.m. The station dropped its morning and weekend newscasts on April 18, 2012,http://www.ktva.com/home/top-stories/KTVA-Announces-Programming-Changes- End-to-Morning-Weekend-Newscasts-147991495.html but they were reinstated in December 2013. News programming was simulcast on KYES in August, subsequent to the sale of non-license assets to Gray, until the last newscasts aired on August 30, 2020. KTVA's newscast focused more on enterprise and investigative reporting, and less on crime, in contrast to its main competitor, KTUU. However, ratings remained weak and in 2018, the newscasts changed to a traditional format, with continued poor ratings until the newscast's termination. On September 21, 2014, during the outro of a story regarding the state's November Measure 2 ballot issue, which would allow recreational use of marijuana, reporter Charlene Ebge, who used the on-air pseudonym Charlo Greene, revealed that she was the president of the medical cannabis organization Alaska Cannabis Club, which campaigned for the legalization of the drug in Alaska. She ended the outro with a profane statement, resigned on- air and walked off the set. Ebge later admitted that she did this in order to \\"draw attention\\" to the issue of legalization of marijuana. Following the incident, Bert Rudman, the station's news director, issued a formal apology. As the incident occurred after 10 p.m. local time past the FCC's safe harbor provisions, FCC action was not pursued, and a fine was not assessed. Measure 2 won voter support and was passed in the November 4 election. ==ReferencesCategory:1953 establishments in Alaska Category:Independent television stations in the United States Category:Television channels and stations established in 1953 TVA ","title":"KTVA"},{"id":"2580525","text":"Alghu (d. 1265 or 1266) was a khan of the Chagatai Khanate (1260–1265/6). He was the son of Baidar and the grandson of Chagatai Khan. In 1260 he was appointed as head of the ulus of the Chagatai Khanate by the Great Khan claimant Ariq Böke, in opposition to the child khan Mubarak Shah and his mother Orghina. In 1261 he was sent to Central Asia, where he quickly established control of much of the Chagatai Khanate, as well as other areas, particularly those that were formerly under the control of the Blue Horde. He also seized control of Samarkand and Bukhara, which before had been ruled jointly between the Chagatai Khan and the Great Khan. Alghu supported Ariq Böke in the Toluid Civil War against Kublai Khan, but later deserted him. In 1262 he rebelled against Ariq Boke, and the conflict saw a series of violent clashes over the next two years. Alghu gained the support of the Great Khan's governor of Turkestan, Mas'ud Beg, as well as Orghina. The revolt severely weakened Ariq Böke's power and contributed to his eventual loss to Kublai Khan. In 1263 Alghu declared his allegiance to Kublai, and then attacked Kaidu, whose lands bordered his, under the pretext that the latter had supported Ariq Böke. Kaidu turned to Berke, Khan of the Blue Horde, for assistance; the latter provided him with resources and an army. Alghu found his territories invaded, and was defeated by Kaidu in battle. However, Alghu struck back and was victorious in a new battle, and would have pressed his advantage had he not died in the end of 1265 or the beginning of 1266.

With nearly 1000 sites monitored annually, the Tucson Bird Count is among the largest urban biological monitoring programs in the world. ==Methods== Each spring, TBC participants collect data on bird abundance and distribution at hundreds of point count locations arrayed across the Tucson basin. The TBC is an example of citizen science, drawing on the combined efforts of hundreds of volunteers. So that data are of suitable quality for scientific analysis and decisionmaking, all TBC volunteers are skilled birdwatchers; many are also professional field guides or biologists. TBC methods are similar to those employed by the North American Breeding Bird Survey, although the TBC uses more closely spaced sites (one site per 1-km2 square) over a smaller total area (approximately 1000 km2). For full details of TBC methods, see the TBC web page at tucsonbirds.org or Turner (2003). The TBC's spatially systematic monitoring is complemented by a TBC park monitoring program that surveys parks, watercourses, or other areas of particular interest multiple times throughout the year. ==Uses of Data== Uses of Tucson Bird Count data include monitoring the status of the Tucson-area bird community over time, finding the areas and land-use practices that are succeeding at sustaining native birds, and investigating the ecology of birds in human-dominated landscapes. Tucson Bird Count results have led to scientific publications, informed Tucson-area planning, and contributed a variety of projects, from locating populations of imperiled species to estimating risk to humans from West Nile Virus. The TBC and several associated research projects are examples of reconciliation ecology, in that they investigate how native species can be sustained in and around the places people live, work, and play. Researchers have also used TBC data to explore the extent to which urban humans are separated from nature (Turner et al. 2004) Recently, the city of Ottawa, Canada has initiated an urban bird survey that is largely modeled on the Tucson Bird Count. The Ottawa Breeding Bird Count will conduct its inaugural season in 2007. By collaborating among cities, urban surveys like the Tucson Bird Count and the Ottawa Breeding Bird Count, will help researchers discover ways to create habitat for biodiversity in the places where people live and work. ==Basic Results== The Tucson Bird Count began in spring 2001 and is ongoing. As of summer 2005, the TBC had recorded 192,000 individual birds belonging to 212 distinct species. About 115 of these species are known or suspected to breed in the Tucson area; the remainder are migrants (either to higher latitudes, or to higher elevations in nearby mountain ranges such as the Catalinas) or vagrants. Because the data are entered directly by participants into the Tucson Bird Count web site, results are publicly available on-line with little delay after observations are made. Among the project's more basic, yet striking results are distribution maps for species in the Tucson area. Many species show strong patterns with respect to development intensity, presence of various habitats, or other factors. For example, the non-native rock pigeon, common in urban areas worldwide, is generally restricted to Tucson's urban core. In contrast, Gambel's quail, a characteristic species of Sonoran Desert upland habitats, shows the inverse pattern, common near Tucson's periphery yet absent from most of the more heavily developed central portion of the city. ==See also== *Australian Bird Count (ABC) *BioBlitz (\\"24-hour inventory\\") *Breeding Bird Survey *Christmas Bird Count (CBC) (in the Western Hemisphere) ==References== * Tucson Bird Count (Official Website) * Turner, W.

Despite its name, the Polish rabbit likely originated in England, not Poland. The breed known in the UK as Polish is the breed known in the US as Britannia Petite. The breed known in the US as Polish is unknown in the UK. ==Appearance== FOR COMPARISON A Netherland Dwarf rabbit (Note the short ears, 240px 240px Today, the Polish rabbit in the US is used as a fancy exhibition breed and as a pet. Polish rabbits are small, with short ears that touch each other all the way from the base to the tip. This breed has a short head with full cheeks and bold eyes. Due to its small size, the Polish rabbit is often confused with the Netherland Dwarf, although the Polish is a little larger and its head is not rounded. There are many other differences between the two breeds, such as coat structure, body type and colors. The accepted weight a 6-months-or-older Polish rabbit in the US is 2½ to 3½ pounds, with the ideal weight being 2½ pounds. Until the 1950s, most Polish rabbits in the US were white with either red eyes or blue eyes. The ruby-eyed white is a true albino. The blue-eyed white has the Vienna breed's white gene and is not a true albino. Since the 1950s, colored Polish varieties have been recognized by rabbit clubs. In 1957, the American Rabbit Breeders' Association recognized a black as well as a chocolate color in Polish rabbits. In 1982, the blue variety was recognized, and in 1998 the broken variety was approved. ==Personality and care== Despite their small size, Polish rabbits need space in cage and barn facilities. They need to be out about 5-6 hours a day. Cage bottoms should not be slippery, as this can cause hip injuries and splay leg. Cage bottoms should never be wired as this causes bruises and their feet to become damaged. The American Polish rabbit is generally calm and friendly, especially the bucks. Does can be territorial if not spayed. Children should always be supervised when handling rabbits, to ensure that the rabbit is not inadvertently injured. Rabbits can be easily trained to use a litter box and to accept a harness with leash when out of their cage. Rabbit- proofing a room where a rabbit is roaming freely is critical. Rabbits will chew on carpets, baseboard and especially electrical cords. ===Feeding=== Polish rabbits should be fed about 1/4 cups of pelleted feed every other day depending on the activity level of the rabbit. It is vital that rabbits have access to unlimited fresh hay to ensure good dental health, gastrointestinal health, urinary tract health, weight control and for environmental enrichment. http://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/171/8/192.extract Treats such as fruit and carrot should be fed sparingly; typically a portion no larger than the tip of the thumb. Carrots are high in sugar so best to avoid it. Fresh young dandelion leaves, parsley and spinach are nutritious choices for treats. Vegetables in the cabbage family and high-sugar foods such as corn should be avoided, as these can cause gastroenteritis. Seed should never be given to rabbits. Iceberg lettuce is has no nutritional value. Remember the darker the lettuce the healthier. A healthy rabbit should be well fleshed but not flabby. This is tested by running one's hand over the rabbits back. A firm layer of flesh over the ribs and spine together with the ribs and spine should be felt, indicating proper nutrition. A prominent spine indicates under nutrition and is corrected by increasing the feed. Inability to feel the spine indicates over nutrition and likewise, the amount of feed is decreased. ===Health concerns=== As with other rabbits, Polish rabbits do not do well in high temperatures, but can withstand low temperatures if they are kept dry and out of drafts. They are prone to hairball obstructions and matted coats if not cared for properly. Other health concerns include ear mites, Pasturella, respiratory disease, dental problems, urinary bladder stones and fractured backs. Be quick to notice any changes in diet or litter box habits and contact a rabbit veterinarian immediately. The average life span of a breeding Polish rabbit is 5 to 6 years and 8-10 with being spayed or neutered.http://www.petplace.com/small-mammals/choosing-a-polish- rabbit/page1.aspx ==See also== *Rabbit *Domestic rabbit *List of rabbit breeds ==References== ==External links== *American Rabbit Breeder's Association *American Polish Rabbit club *Polish Rabbit Breed History *Breeds of Rabbits Chart Category:Rabbit breeds Category:Rabbits as pets Category:Rabbit breeds originating in England ","title":"Polish rabbit"},{"id":"2580555","text":"In mathematics, the Bernoulli scheme or Bernoulli shift is a generalization of the Bernoulli process to more than two possible outcomes.P. Shields, The theory of Bernoulli shifts, Univ. Chicago Press (1973)Michael S. Keane, \\"Ergodic theory and subshifts of finite type\\", (1991), appearing as Chapter 2 in Ergodic Theory, Symbolic Dynamics and Hyperbolic Spaces, Tim Bedford, Michael Keane and Caroline Series, Eds. Oxford University Press, Oxford (1991). Bernoulli schemes appear naturally in symbolic dynamics, and are thus important in the study of dynamical systems. Many important dynamical systems (such as Axiom A systems) exhibit a repellor that is the product of the Cantor set and a smooth manifold, and the dynamics on the Cantor set are isomorphic to that of the Bernoulli shift.Pierre Gaspard, Chaos, scattering and statistical mechanics(1998), Cambridge University press This is essentially the Markov partition. The term shift is in reference to the shift operator, which may be used to study Bernoulli schemes. The Ornstein isomorphism theorem shows that Bernoulli shifts are isomorphic when their entropy is equal. ==Definition== A Bernoulli scheme is a discrete-time stochastic process where each independent random variable may take on one of N distinct possible values, with the outcome i occurring with probability p_i, with i = 1, ..., N, and :\\\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i = 1. The sample space is usually denoted as :X=\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,N \\\\\\\\}^\\\\mathbb{Z} as a shorthand for :X=\\\\\\\\{ x=(\\\\ldots,x_{-1},x_0,x_1,\\\\ldots) : x_k \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,N\\\\\\\\} \\\\; \\\\forall k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\\\\\}. The associated measure is called the Bernoulli measure :\\\\mu = \\\\\\\\{p_1,\\\\ldots,p_N\\\\\\\\}^\\\\mathbb{Z} The σ-algebra \\\\mathcal{A} on X is the product sigma algebra; that is, it is the (countable) direct product of the σ-algebras of the finite set {1, ..., N}. Thus, the triplet :(X,\\\\mathcal{A},\\\\mu) is a measure space. A basis of \\\\mathcal{A} is the cylinder sets. Given a cylinder set [x_0, x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n], its measure is :\\\\mu\\\\left([x_0, x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n]\\\\right)= \\\\prod_{i=0}^n p_{x_i} The equivalent expression, using the notation of probability theory, is :\\\\mu\\\\left([x_0, x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n]\\\\right)= \\\\mathrm{Pr}(X_0=x_0, X_1=x_1, \\\\ldots, X_n=x_n) for the random variables \\\\\\\\{X_k\\\\\\\\} The Bernoulli scheme, as any stochastic process, may be viewed as a dynamical system by endowing it with the shift operator T where :T(x_k) = x_{k+1}. Since the outcomes are independent, the shift preserves the measure, and thus T is a measure-preserving transformation. The quadruplet :(X,\\\\mathcal{A},\\\\mu, T) is a measure-preserving dynamical system, and is called a Bernoulli scheme or a Bernoulli shift. It is often denoted by :BS(p)=BS(p_1,\\\\ldots,p_N). The N = 2 Bernoulli scheme is called a Bernoulli process. The Bernoulli shift can be understood as a special case of the Markov shift, where all entries in the adjacency matrix are one, the corresponding graph thus being a clique. ==Matches and metrics== The Hamming distance provides a natural metric on a Bernoulli scheme. Another important metric is the so-called \\\\overline f metric, defined via a supremum over string matches. J. Feldman (1976) New K-automorphisms and a problem of Kakutani. Israel Journal of Mathematics, 24 (1): 16 - 38. Let A = a_1a_2\\\\cdots a_m and B = b_1b_2\\\\cdots b_n be two strings of symbols. A match is a sequence M of pairs (i_k, j_k) of indexes into the string, i.e. pairs such that a_{i_k}=b_{j_k}, understood to be totally ordered. That is, each individual subsequence (i_k) and (j_k) are ordered: 1\\\\le i_1 < i_2<\\\\cdots and likewise 1\\\\le j_1 < j_2<\\\\cdots The \\\\overline f-distance between A and B is :\\\\overline f(A,B) = 1-\\\\frac{2\\\\sup M}{m+n} where the supremum is being taken over all matches M between A and B. This satisfies the triangle inequality only when m=n, and so is not quite a true metric; despite this, it is commonly called a \\"distance\\" in the literature. ==Generalizations== Most of the properties of the Bernoulli scheme follow from the countable direct product, rather than from the finite base space. Thus, one may take the base space to be any standard probability space (Y,\\\\mathcal{B}, u), and define the Bernoulli scheme as :(X, \\\\mathcal{A}, \\\\mu)=(Y,\\\\mathcal{B}, u)^\\\\mathbb{Z} This works because the countable direct product of a standard probability space is again a standard probability space. As a further generalization, one may replace the integers \\\\mathbb{Z} by a countable discrete group G, so that :(X, \\\\mathcal{A}, \\\\mu)=(Y,\\\\mathcal{B}, u)^G For this last case, the shift operator is replaced by the group action :gx(f)=x(g^{-1}f) for group elements f,g\\\\in G and x\\\\in Y^G understood as a function x:G\\\\to Y (any direct product Y^G can be understood to be the set of functions [G\\\\to Y], as this is the exponential object). The measure \\\\mu is taken as the Haar measure, which is invariant under the group action: :\\\\mu(gx)=\\\\mu(x). \\\\, These generalizations are also commonly called Bernoulli schemes, as they still share most properties with the finite case. ==Properties== Ya. Sinai demonstrated that the Kolmogorov entropy of a Bernoulli scheme is given byYa.G. Sinai, (1959) \\"On the Notion of Entropy of a Dynamical System\\", Doklady of Russian Academy of Sciences 124, pp. 768–771.Ya. G. Sinai, (2007) \\"Metric Entropy of Dynamical System\\" :H = -\\\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i \\\\log p_i . This may be seen as resulting from the general definition of the entropy of a Cartesian product of probability spaces, which follows from the asymptotic equipartition property. For the case of a general base space (Y, \\\\mathcal{B}, u) (i.e. a base space which is not countable), one typically considers the relative entropy. So, for example, if one has a countable partition Y'\\\\subset Y of the base Y, such that u(Y')=1, one may define the entropy as :H_{Y'} = -\\\\sum_{y'\\\\in Y'} u(y') \\\\log u(y') . In general, this entropy will depend on the partition; however, for many dynamical systems, it is the case that the symbolic dynamics is independent of the partition (or rather, there are isomorphisms connecting the symbolic dynamics of different partitions, leaving the measure invariant), and so such systems can have a well-defined entropy independent of the partition. == Ornstein isomorphism == The Ornstein isomorphism theorem states that two Bernoulli schemes with the same entropy are isomorphic.Donald Ornstein, \\"Bernoulli shifts with the same entropy are isomorphic\\", Advances in Math. 4 (1970), pp.337–352 The result is sharp,Christopher Hoffman, \\"A K counterexample machine\\", Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 351 (1999), pp 4263–4280 in that very similar, non-scheme systems, such as Kolmogorov automorphisms, do not have this property. The Ornstein isomorphism theorem is in fact considerably deeper: it provides a simple criterion by which many different measure-preserving dynamical systems can be judged to be isomorphic to Bernoulli schemes. The result was surprising, as many systems previously believed to be unrelated proved to be isomorphic. These include all finite stationary stochastic processes, subshifts of finite type, finite Markov chains, Anosov flows, and Sinai's billiards: these are all isomorphic to Bernoulli schemes. For the generalized case, the Ornstein isomorphism theorem still holds if the group G is a countably infinite amenable group. D. Ornstein and B. Weiss. \\"Entropy and isomorphism theorems for actions of amenable groups.\\" J. Analyse Math. 48 (1987), pp. 1–141.Lewis Bowen (2011), \\"Every countably infinite group is almost Ornstein\\", ArXiv abs/1103.4424 ==Bernoulli automorphism== An invertible, measure-preserving transformation of a standard probability space (Lebesgue space) is called a Bernoulli automorphism if it isomorphic to a Bernoulli shift.Peter Walters (1982) An Introduction to Ergodic Theory, Springer-Verlag, == Loosely Bernoulli== A system is termed \\"loosely Bernoulli\\" if it is Kakutani- equivalent to a Bernoulli shift; in the case of zero entropy, if it is Kakutani-equivalent to an irrational rotation of a circle. ==See also== * Shift of finite type * Markov chain * Hidden Bernoulli model ==References== Category:Markov models Category:Ergodic theory Category:Symbolic dynamics ","title":"Bernoulli scheme"},{"id":"2580559","text":"Imipenem/cilastatin, sold under the brand name Primaxin among others, is an antibiotic useful for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. It is made from a combination of imipenem and cilastatin. Specifically it is used for pneumonia, sepsis, endocarditis, joint infections, intra-abdominal infections, and urinary tract infections. It is given by injection into a vein or muscle. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and pain at the site of injection. Other side effects may include Clostridium difficile diarrhea and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the baby. Imipenem is in the carbapenem family of medications and works by interfering with the bacteria's cell wall. Cilastatin blocks the activity of dehydropeptidase I which prevents the breakdown of imipenem. Imipenem/cilastatin was first sold in 1987. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. ==Medical uses== Imipenem/cilastatin is used for lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal infections, gynecologic infections, bacterial sepsis, bone and joint infections, skin and skin structure infections, endocarditis and polymicrobic infections. It is a broad-spectrum beta-lactam containing equal quantities of imipenem and cilastatin. ==Side effects== Common side effects for both forms are: * Upset stomach * Vomiting * Stomach pain Major side effects requiring medical attention: * Diarrhea * Rash * Fever * Facial swelling * Difficulty breathing * Unusual bleeding * Seizures This medicine is passed through breast milk, so its use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should only be done when clearly needed. Primaxin is cleared from the body by the kidneys, so it is important to tell one's doctor about any other drugs being taken that are also cleared through the kidneys (such as other antibiotics), especially for older patients, as kidney function declines with age. Patients who are allergic to penicillin, cephalosporins, and related drugs may react to imipenem. It is important tell one's doctor or pharmacist one's medical history, especially of brain disorders (e.g., seizures, head injury, tumor), kidney disease, liver disease, and stomach/intestinal diseases (e.g., colitis). === Hepatotoxicity === In large clinical trials, imipenem was associated with transient and asymptomatic elevations in serum aminotransferase levels in about 6% of patients given the drug for five to 14 days. More serious hepatic injury from imipenem/cilastatin is rare, but jaundice and liver test abnormalities have been reported in 0.1% of patients in prospective trials of the agent. Several instances of cholestatic jaundice arising during or shortly after therapy have been reported with imipenem- cilastatin and other carbapenems. The latency to onset has been within one to three weeks, and the pattern of enzyme elevations is usually cholestatic. Immunoallergic features can occur, but autoantibodies are rare. The course is usually self-limiting, but at least one case of vanishing bile duct syndrome related to the carbapenems has been reported. Imipenem and other carbapenems have not been linked to cases of acute liver failure. === Mechanism of liver injury === The cause of the mild, transient serum enzyme elevations during imipenem-cilastatin therapy is not known. The cholestatic hepatitis attributed to imipenem-cilastatin and the carbapenems is probably immunoallergic and resembles the rare, clinically apparent liver injury that has been linked to penicillins and cephalosporins. === Outcome and management === The liver injury due to the carbapenems is usually mild and self-limited. Rarely, the carbapenems can cause a clinically apparent acute cholestatic hepatitis that is usually self-limiting and not requiring therapy or intervention. In patients with vanishing bile duct syndrome, corticosteroids are often used but have not been shown to be beneficial and are best avoided. Some patients may benefit from symptomatic therapy of the pruritus associated with cholestasis using antihistamines, ursodiol, or cholestyramine. Little information is available on possible cross-sensitivity to liver injury among the different betalactam antibiotics, but patients with clinically apparent liver injury due to imipenem should probably avoid the other carbapenems. ==Interactions== * valproic acid (Depakene, Stavzor) * ganciclovir (Cytovene) * probenecid (Benemid) * penicillin antibiotics such as amoxicillin (Amoxil, Augmentin), ampicillin (Omnipen, Principen), dicloxacillin (Dycill, Dynapen), oxacillin (Bactocill), or penicillin (Beepen-VK, Ledercillin VK, Pen-V, Pen-Vee K, Pfizerpen, V-Cillin K, Veetids, and others); or * cephalosporin antibiotics such as cefaclor (Ceclor), cefuroxime (Ceftin), cefadroxil (Duricef), cephalexin (Keflex), and others. ==Mechanism of action== Imipenem/cilastatin has the ability to kill a wide variety of bacteria. Imipenem is the active antibiotic agent and works by interfering with their ability to form cell walls, so the bacteria break up and die. Imipenem is rapidly degraded by the renal enzyme dehydropeptidase if administered alone (making it less effective); the metabolites can cause kidney damage. Imipenem is a broad- spectrum betalactam antibiotic used for severe bacterial infections caused by susceptible organisms. Because imipenem is rapidly inactivated by renal dehydropeptidase I, it is given in combination with cilastatin, a DHP-I inhibitor which increases half-life and tissue penetration of imipenem. Imipenem/cilastatin, like other carbapenems, binds to bacterial penicillin- binding proteins and interferes with bacterial cell wall integrity and synthesis. It has activity against many aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. viridans- group streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus species. Imipenem/cilastatin was approved for use in the United States in 1985. Imipenem/cilastatin is indicated for the treatment of severe or complicated skin, tissue, joint, respiratory tract, intra-abdominal, urinary tract and urogenital infections, but not meningitis (as it does not pass through the blood brain barrier), endocarditis, and sepsis due to susceptible organisms. Its use is generally restricted to severe infections largely in hospitalized patients. The recommended dosage is 250 mg to 1 gram given intravenously every 6 to 8 hours or in intramuscular doses of no more than 1.5 gm daily, usually for five to 14 days. It is commercially available as Primaxin as 250-mg or 500-mg infusion bottles for IV use or 500-mg or 750-mg vials of lyophilized powder for IM injection. The most common side effects of imipenem are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, skin rash, pruritus, and injection-site reactions. ==Pharmacology== === Mechanism of action === Imipenem inhibits bacterial cell-wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins; cilastatin prevents renal metabolism of imipenem. === Bioavailability === Intramuscular injection: * imipenem: 60–75% * cilastatin: 95–100% === Distribution === The drug is distributed rapidly and widely to most tissues and fluids, including sputum, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, interstitial fluid, bile, aqueous humor, reproductive organs, and bone; highest concentrations occur in pleural fluid, interstitial fluid, peritoneal fluid, and reproductive organs; low concentrations occur in CSF; it crosses the placenta, and enters breast milk === Protein binding === * imipenem: 13–21% * cilastatin, 40% === Metabolism === Imipenem is metabolized in the kidney by dehydropeptidase 1; activity is blocked by cilastatin. === Elimination === Half-life (both drugs): 60 min; prolonged with renal impairment. Excretion (both drugs): Urine (~70% as unchanged drug) ==Availability and description== Primaxin IV is a combination of imipenem, cilastatin sodium, and sodium bicarbonate which is added as a buffer. Primaxin IM lacks the sodium bicarbonate buffer. ==See also== * Imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam ==References== ==External links== * Category:Combination antibiotics Category:Peripherally selective drugs Category:Merck & Co. brands Category:World Health Organization essential medicines Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate ","title":"Imipenem/cilastatin"},{"id":"2580562","text":"Antonio García nom de guerre of Eliécer Erlington Chamorro Acosta (born 10 January 1956 in Mocoa, Putumayo Department), one of the main commanders of the Ejército de Liberación Nacional (usually abbreviated to ELN), or National Liberation Army.

This is to accommodate itself to neck movements such as those of the pharynx in deglutition; and facial movements such as those of the mandible, lips, and cheeks. Superficial dissection of the right side of the neck, showing the carotid and subclavian artery. Branch of facial artery labeled == Relations == In the neck, its origin is superficial, being covered by the integument, platysma, and fascia; it then passes beneath the digastric and stylohyoid muscles and part of the submandibular gland, but superficial to the hypoglossal nerve. It lies upon the middle pharyngeal constrictor and the superior pharyngeal constrictor, the latter of which separates it, at the summit of its arch, from the lower and back part of the tonsil. On the face, where it passes over the body of the mandible, it is comparatively superficial, lying immediately beneath the dilators of the mouth. In its course over the face, it is covered by the integument, the fat of the cheek, and, near the angle of the mouth, by the platysma, risorius, and zygomaticus major. It rests on the buccinator and levator anguli oris, and passes either over or under the infraorbital head of the levator labii superioris. The anterior facial vein lies lateral/posterior to the artery, and takes a more direct course across the face, where it is separated from the artery by a considerable interval. In the neck it lies superficial to the artery. The branches of the facial nerve cross the artery from behind forward. The facial artery anastomoses with (among others) the dorsal nasal artery of the internal carotid artery. ==Branches== The branches of the facial artery are: * cervical ** Ascending palatine artery ** Tonsillar branch ** Submental artery ** Glandular branches * facial ** Inferior labial artery ** Superior labial artery ** Lateral nasal branch to nasalis muscle ** Angular artery - the terminal branch ==Muscles== Muscles supplied by the facial artery include: * buccinator * levator anguli oris * levator labii superioris * levator labii superioris alaeque nasi * levator veli palatini * masseter * mentalis * mylohyoid * nasalis * palatoglossus * palatopharyngeus * platysma * procerus * risorius * styloglossus * transverse portion of the nasalis ==Additional images== Image:Gray176.pngMandible.

It manages more than 40.8 million print volumesFacts and Figures: UC Libraries Accessed July 27, 2020. in 100 libraries on ten campuses. The purpose of these libraries is to assist research and instruction on the University of California campuses. While each campus library is separate, they share (through the UC library system) facilities for storage, computerized indexing, digital libraries and management. For example, each campus maintains its own computerized library catalog and simultaneously participates in the systemwide union catalog, MELVYL. The UC libraries also manage a digital library, the California Digital Library or CDL. They also hold special collections and electronic archives of research documents. Special collections include historical archives on California history, federal depositories, law libraries, specialized collections for medical and scientific research, and a series of periodicals. A major concern of the library system is the rising cost of scientific journal subscriptions, and the costs of renting article databases. The library is leading an effort to publish science research online in a persistently-available electronic format, primarily through a digital repository called the eScholarship repository. The physical collections are scattered across the UC campuses. Their collections and stand-alone library buildings are listed below. In the 1980s, to relieve overcrowding in existing on-campus library buildings, the UC system constructed two regional library facilities: the Northern Regional Library Facility at UC Berkeley's Richmond Field Station (opened 1982), and the Southern Regional Library Facility on the western edge of the UCLA campus (opened 1987). As of 2019, Northern Regional Library Facility is home to 7.4 million volumes, while Southern Regional Library Facility is home to 6.5 million. Each facility receives items from all UC campuses in its respective region of the state, and has climate controls and high-density stacks. Items are shelved two deep and are arranged in a sequence that results in efficient use of space (but is not quite as intuitive as traditional library indexing systems). As a result, casual browsing is prohibited, and the shelves are accessible only by library clerks trained to retrieve and put back items properly. Users must page materials to an on-site reading room or to a library at their home campus. ==List of collections by campus== Doe Memorial Library, Berkeley ===Berkeley (18 university libraries and 11 affiliated libraries—including Law)=== *Doe Memorial Library (Main Collections and Main Stacks) *Moffitt Library (Undergraduate) *Bancroft Library (Special Collections) *Hargrove Music Library ===Davis (11 major libraries—including Law and Medical)=== *Peter J.

In addition, all campuses allow any California resident to apply for a library card and thus gain limited borrowing privileges for libraries on that campus, although there is typically a charge for these cards. Materials may be borrowed between the UC campus libraries or from the regional library facilities through interlibrary loan; it is generally possible for a student or other university associate to order a nonfragile, unreserved item and have it within a few days. Books may take between a day to a week to be delivered between campuses. ==Librarians Association of the University of California== The Librarians Association of the University of California (LAUC) is the statewide organization of librarians employed at least half-time in the UC Library system. Each campus also supports its own division. Librarians are academic appointees but not faculty. LAUC's objectives are to: advise the University on professional and governance matters, to make recommendations concerning UC librarians’ rights, privileges, and obligations, and to promote full utilization of UC librarians’ professional abilities. LAUC also awards research grants to its members to support librarian research and professional development. ==See also== * California Digital Library — the digital library branch of the UC Libraries * Melvyl — the catalog of the UC Libraries ==References== ==External links== *The University of California Libraries *The Melvyl Catalog *the California Digital Library *the eScholarship repository *Librarians Association of the University of California Category:University and college academic libraries in the United States ","title":"University of California Libraries"},{"id":"2580582","text":"Anne Digby (born 5 May 1943 in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey) is a prolific British children's writer best known for the Trebizon series published between 1978 and 1994.

The Astrolite family consists of two compounds, Astrolite G and Astrolite A. Both are two-part liquid-state high explosive mixtures, composed of ammonium nitrate oxidizer and hydrazine rocket fuel. The explosives were extensively studied, manufactured, and used in many countries because of their advantages of high energy, excellent performance, and wide application. They still find some use in commercial and civil blasting applications, but have mostly been superseded by cheaper and safer compounds, largely due to the expense and exceptionally poisonous nature of the hydrazine component. == Astrolite G == Astrolite G, the most common type of Astrolite, is a mixture of ammonium nitrate and hydrazine at a ratio of 2:1, measured in weight, forming a clear, viscous liquid approximately the consistency of motor oil. It is a relatively stable (secondary) high explosive compound, requiring a blasting cap to detonate. It has a detonation velocity of approximately 8,600 m/s, twice the explosive strength of TNT. It has been widely referred to as the \\"world's most powerful non-nuclear explosive\\", caused largely by a comparison of Astrolite G's detonation velocity to that of first and second-generation high explosives such as nitroglycerine and TNT. Current-generation high explosive compounds such as PETN and RDX can feature comparable detonation velocities and brisance to Astrolite G. == Astrolite A == Astrolite A, a secondary (and less common) type of Astrolite, is synthesized by the addition of finely powdered aluminium to the Astrolite G mixture. Though it has a lower detonation velocity (approximately 7,600 m/s) than Astrolite G, the addition of the aluminium increases both its density and brisance, moderately increasing its overall effectiveness. == Persistency == A notable characteristic of the Astrolite family is its remarkable degree of persistency for a liquid explosive compound. Due to its low volatility, it can be dispersed in an area, be absorbed by the soil, and still retain its full explosive characteristics for a period of approximately 4 days. This has shown to be true even when rainwater had also been absorbed by the soil. ==References== ==Further reading== * The Controversial Chem Lab * Yarchive astrolite usenet postings page including posts by Gerald Hurst, the inventor Category:Explosives Category:Liquid explosives ","title":"Astrolite"},{"id":"2580610","text":"One Oxford Centre is one of the major distinctive and recognizable features of Downtown Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, United States. The complex is named for Oxford Development, the developer and previous owner. Among the commercial tenants of One Oxford Centre are the law firms of Buchanan, Ingersoll & Rooney PC, HFF, The Federal Reserve Bank, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, Thorp Reed & Armstrong, and other Class A office tenants Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney PC, Pittsburgh Office information ==History== The proposed tower was announced and submitted for county approval in October 1978 as the \\"Grant Land project\\". In April 1983, DeBartolo Company, which constructed the tower, announced plans for \\"Two Oxford Centre\\" to the immediate northeast of the main tower and across the street from Pittsburgh City Hall and the Frick Building. Two Oxford Centre was to be noticeably taller than One Oxford, however the plans and development were dependent on securing a majority tenant which never materialized. ==Design== Completed in 1983, One Oxford Centre has 46 floors in its main tower and rises 615 feet (187 m) above Downtown Pittsburgh. Although its address is simply One Oxford Centre, the building is located on the 300 block of Grant Street. The tower has nearly of office and high-end retail space. Since the towers opening it has been home to a full-service health/business club, The Rivers Club. The complex also contains a multi-level parking garage and some street level retail and office space one block west of Grant Street. At night, forty-three 1,500-watt spotlights illuminate the Centre with a total of 54,500 watts that create a glowing effect that is said to be greater than any other highrise in the United States. One Oxford Centre was developed by Oxford Development Company and designed by architecture firm Hellmuth, Obata, & Kassabaum. ==In popular culture== A composite image of the main tower of PPG Place and Oxford Centre is used as the Fiddler's Green luxury high-rise in the movie Land of the Dead. Another interesting fact is that a street (Cherry Way) passes through the tower on its lower levels. The building is featured in Episode 1656 of the television program Mr. Roger's Neighborhood on \\"Up and Down.\\" Mr. Rogers and the \\"Speed Delivery\\"-man Mr. McFeely ride the building's escalators and elevators up and down.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZKPAuZPhHE The tower is used for exterior shots of the Newman tower on the CBS daytime soap opera, The Young and the Restless. ==Building Ownership== Since developing the Property in 1983, Oxford Development had been the sole owner and operator. In January 2016 San Francisco-based Shorenstein Properties acquired One Oxford Centre under its Shorenstein Realty Investors Eleven LP, a $1.2 billion fund. CBRE Group was appointed as the leasing agent to fill up the remaining vacant space in the building.

Designed to lower the energy consumption of server computers, the CPU typically uses 72 W of power at 1.4 GHz. Afara Websystems pioneered a radical thread-heavy SPARC design. The company was purchased by Sun, and the intellectual property became the foundation of the CoolThreads line of processors, starting with the T1. The T1 is a new-from- the-ground-up SPARC microprocessor implementation that conforms to the UltraSPARC Architecture 2005 specification and executes the full SPARC V9 instruction set. Sun has produced two previous multicore processors (UltraSPARC IV and IV+), but UltraSPARC T1 is its first microprocessor that is both multicore and multithreaded. Security was built-in from the very first release on silicon, with hardware cryptographic units in the T1, unlike contemporary general purpose processor from competing vendors. The processor is available with four, six or eight CPU cores, each core able to handle four threads concurrently. Thus the processor is capable of processing up to 32 threads concurrently. UltraSPARC T1 can be partitioned in a similar way to high-end Sun SMP systems. Thus, several cores can be partitioned for running a single or group of processes and/or threads, while the other cores deal with the rest of the processes on the system. ==Cores== floorplan pipeline The UltraSPARC T1 was designed from scratch as a multi-threaded, special-purpose processor, and thus introduces a whole new architecture for obtaining high performance. Rather than try to make each core as intelligent and optimized as they can, Sun's goal was to run as many concurrent threads as possible, and maximize utilization of each core's pipeline. The T1's cores are less complex than those of current high end processors in order to allow 8 cores to fit on the same die. The cores do not feature out-of-order execution, or a sizable amount of cache. Single-thread processors depend heavily on large caches for their performance because cache misses result in a wait while the data is fetched from main memory. By making the cache larger the probability of a cache miss is reduced, but the impact of a miss is still the same. The T1 cores largely side-step the issue of cache misses by multithreading. Each core is a barrel processor, meaning it switches between available threads each cycle. When a long-latency event occurs, such as cache miss, the thread is taken out of rotation while the data is fetched into cache in the background. Once the long-latency event completes, the thread is made available for execution again. Sharing of the pipeline by multiple threads may make each thread slower, but the overall throughput (and utilization) of each core is much higher. It also means that the impact of cache misses is greatly reduced, and the T1 can maintain high throughput with a smaller amount of cache. The cache no longer needs to be large enough to hold all or most of the \\"working set\\", just the recent cache misses of each thread. Benchmarks demonstrate this approach has worked very well on commercial (integer), multithreaded workloads such as Java application servers, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) application servers, email (such as Lotus Domino) servers, and web servers. These benchmarks suggest each core in the UltraSPARC T1 is more powerful than the circa 2001, single-core, single-threaded UltraSPARC III, and at a chip to chip comparison, significantly outperforms other processors on multithreaded integer workloads. ==Physical characteristics== The UltraSPARC T1 contained 279 million transistors and had an area of 378 mm2. It was fabricated by Texas Instruments (TI) in their 90 nm complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) process with nine levels of copper interconnect.McGhan, Harlan (6 November 2006). \\"Niagara 2 Opens the Floodgates\\". Microprocessor Report. Each core has L1 16kB instruction cache and 8KB data cache. L2 cache is 3MB and there is no L3 cache. ==Systems== Sun Fire T1000 server The T1 processor can be found in the following products from Sun and Fujitsu Computer Systems: * Sun/Fujitsu/Fujitsu Siemens SPARC Enterprise T1000 and T2000 servers * Sun Fire T1000 and T2000 servers * Sun Netra T2000 Server * Sun Netra CP3060 Blade * Sun Blade T6300 Server Module ==Target market== The UltraSPARC T1 microprocessor is unique in its strength and weaknesses, and as such is targeted at specific markets. Rather than being used for high-end number- crunching and ultra-high performance applications, the chip is targeted at network-facing high-demand servers, such as high-traffic web servers, and mid- tier Java, ERP, and CRM application servers, which often utilize a large number of separate threads. One of the limitations of the T1 design is that a single floating point unit (FPU) is shared between all 8 cores, making the T1 unsuitable for applications performing a lot of floating point mathematics. However, since the processor's intended markets do not typically make much use of floating-point operations, Sun does not expect this to be a problem. Sun provides a tool for analysing an application's level of parallelism and use of floating point instructions to determine if it is suitable for use on a T1 or T2 platform. In addition to web and application tier processing, the UltraSPARC T1 may be well suited for smaller database applications which have a large user count. One customer has published results showing that a MySQL application running on an UltraSPARC T1 server ran 13.5 times faster than on an AMD Opteron server. ==Virtualization== T1 is the first SPARC processor that supports the Hyper-Privileged execution mode. The SPARC Hypervisor runs in this mode, and it can partition a T1 system into 32 Logical Domains, each of which can run an operating system instance. Currently, Solaris, Linux, NetBSD and OpenBSD are supported. ==Software licensing issues== Traditionally, commercial software suites such as Oracle Database charge their customers based on the number of processors the software runs on. In early 2006, Oracle changed the licensing model by introducing the processor factor. With a processor factor of .25 for the T1, an 8-core T2000 requires only a 2-CPU license. The \\"Oracle Processor Core Factor Table\\" has since been updated regularly as new CPUs came to market. In Q3 2006, IBM introduced the concept of Value Unit (VU) pricing. Each core of the T1 is 30 PVUs (each T2 core is 50 PVUs, and T3 is 70 PVUs) instead of the default value of 100 PVUs per core. ==Weaknesses== The T1 only offered a single Floating Point unit to be shared by the 8 cores, limiting usage in HPC environments. This weakness was mitigated with the follow-on UltraSPARC T2 processor, which included 8 floating point units, as well as other additional features. Furthermore the T1 was only available in uniprocessor systems, limiting vertical scalability in large enterprise environments. This weakness was mitigated with the follow-on \\"UltraSPARC T2 Plus\\", as well as the next generation SPARC T3 and SPARC T4. The UltraSPARC T2+, SPARC T3, and SPARC T4 all offer single, dual, and quad socket configurations. The T1 had outstanding throughput with massive numbers of threads supported by the processor, but older applications burdened with single thread bottlenecks occasionally exhibited poor overall performance. Single threaded application weakness was mitigated with the follow-on SPARC T4 processor. The T4 core count was reduced to 8 (from 16 on the T3), the cores were made more complex, the clock rate was nearly doubled - all contributing to faster single thread performance (from between 300% to 500% increase over previous generations. Additional effort was made to add the \\"critical thread API\\", where the operating system would detect a bottleneck and would temporarily allocate the resources of an entire core, instead of 1 (of 8) threads, to the targeted application processes exhibiting single threaded CPU bound behavior. This allowed the T4 to uniquely mitigate single threaded bottlenecks, while not having to compromise in the overall architecture to achieve massive multi-threaded throughput. ==Contemporary and subsequent designs== The \\"Coolthreads(TM)\\" architecture, beginning with the UltraSPARC T1 (with its positive and negative aspects), was certainly influential in the concurrent and future designs of SPARC processors. === \\"Rock\\" === The original UltraSPARC T1 was designed for single CPU systems only and is not capable of SMP. \\"Rock\\" was a more ambitious project, intended to support multiple-chip server architectures, targeting traditional data-facing workloads such as databases. It was seen as more a follow-on to Sun's SMP processors such as UltraSPARC IV, rather than a replacement for the UltraSPARC T1 or T2, but was canceled in the timeframe of Oracle's acquisition of Sun. === UltraSPARC T2 === Formerly known by the codename Niagara 2, the follow-on to the UltraSPARC T1, the T2 provides eight cores. Unlike the T1, each core supports 8 threads per core, one FPU per core, one enhanced cryptographic unit per core, and CPU embedded 10 Gigabit Ethernet network controllers. === UltraSPARC T2 Plus === In February 2007, Sun announced at its annual analyst summit that its third- generation simultaneous multithreading design, code-named Victoria Falls, was taped out in October 2006. A two-socket server (2 RU) will have 128 threads, 16 cores, and a 65× performance improvement over UltraSPARC III. At the Hot Chips 19 conference, Sun announced that Victoria Falls will be in two-way and four-way servers. Thus, a single 4-way SMP server will support 256 concurrent hardware threads. In April 2008, Sun released 2-way UltraSPARC T2 Plus servers, the SPARC Enterprise T5140 and T5240. In October 2008, Sun released 4-way UltraSPARC T2 Plus SPARC Enterprise T5440 server. === SPARC T3 === In October 2006, Sun disclosed that Niagara 3 will be built with a 45 nm process. The Register, reported in June 2008 that the microprocessor will have 16 cores, incorrectly suggesting each core would have 16 threads. During the Hot Chips 21 conference Sun revealed the chip has a total of 16 cores and 128 threads.Sanjay Patel, Stephen Phillips and Allan Strong. \\"Sun's Next- Generation Multi-threaded Processor - Rainbow Falls: Sun's Next Generation CMT Processor \\".

Chromosomes are attached to kinetochore microtubules via a multiprotein complex called the kinetochore. Polar microtubules interdigitate at the spindle midzone and push the spindle poles apart via motor proteins. Astral microtubules anchor the spindle poles to the cell membrane. Microtubule polymerization is nucleated at the microtubule organizing center. Astral microtubules are a subpopulation of microtubules, which only exist during and immediately before mitosis. They are defined as any microtubule originating from the centrosome which does not connect to a kinetochore.Mitosis, Molecular Biology of the Cell, Albert et al 4th Edition. Astral microtubules develop in the actin skeleton and interact with the cell cortex to aid in spindle orientation. They are organized into radial arrays around the centrosomes. The turn-over rate of this population of microtubules is higher than any other population. The role of astral microtubules is assisted by dyneins specific to this role. These dyneins have their light chains (static portion) attached to the cell membrane, and their globular parts (dynamic portions) attached to the microtubules. The globular chains attempt to move towards the centrosome, but as they are bound to the cell membrane, this results in pulling the centrosomes towards the membrane, thus assisting cytokinesis. Astral microtubules are not required for the progression of mitosis, but they are required to ensure the fidelity of the process. The function of astral microtubules can be generally considered as determination of cell geometry. They are absolutely required for correct positioning and orientation of the mitotic spindle apparatus, and are thus involved in determining the cell division site based on the geometry and polarity of the cells. The maintenance of astral microtubules is dependent on the integrity of centrosome. It is also dependent on several microtubule-associated proteins such as EB1 and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). ==References== Category:Mitosis Category:Centrosome ","title":"Astral microtubules"},{"id":"2580661","text":"The Chrysler Norseman was a four-seat fastback coupe built in 1956 as a concept car. Although designed by Chrysler's stylists, actual construction was contracted out to the Italian coach-building firm of Carrozzeria Ghia. The concept car was lost during the sinking of the . ==Design== Virgil Exner, working in Chrysler's Advanced Styling Group, developed lower, sleeker, and more aggressive-looking automobiles for Chrysler in the 1950s. Exner also wanted maximum all-around visibility from the car's interior and he took the design of the Norseman to the limit. The dream car was named for Exner's ancestry. The Norseman was designed by the Chrysler Corporation Engineering Division and built by Ghia of Turin, Italy. Ghia had experience in the construction of low-volume vehicles and one-off prototypes. Chrysler wanted a fully drivable vehicle, not just a rolling mockup, so all normal systems for the powertrain, braking, suspension, were installed. Power was from a modified Chrysler Hemi engine producing with a pushbutton-controlled Powerflite automatic transmission. The body panels on the car were made of aluminum with \\"a sharply sloping hood, upswept tail fins and a covered, smooth underbody for aerodynamic efficiency.\\" The Norseman combined a \\"sweeping fastback rear end design and Chrysler's own take on a tailfin and bumper treatment.\\" More difficult to fabricate was its unusual cantilevered roof, which was secured to the body only at the rear C pillars. There were no side pillars, and at the front the roof rested only lightly on a fully frameless windshield. An advanced 12 square foot power sliding glass panel sunroof feature was difficult to integrate into a slender roof structure lacking A-pillar support at the front. The windshield and roof glass was specially made by PPG Industries to provide strength and be shatterproof. The door glass was ventless (having no small vent window at the front), a styling theme that would become popular some fifteen years later. The interior featured four bucket seats and the reel-type seatbelts were mounted in the door and fastened across the occupants to the full-length center console. Other features included concealed automatic headlights, door handles, and concealed trunk lid opening device. Building the complicated car, with its advanced features, took fifteen months and the car was finally delivered to the freight forwarder. it was estimated to cost US$150,000 (in 1956 dollars). The car missed its intended cargo shipment from Italy and was instead put into a container on the next available ship, the passenger ocean liner SS Andrea Doria. ==Legacy== The car was to be a featured attraction of Chrysler's auto show exhibit for 1957 and was shipped from Turin by Ghia to New York City in July 1956. The car was shipped on the ocean liner SS Andrea Doria, which was involved in a collision off the coast of Massachusetts and sank, with the loss of fifty-one lives and all cargo. The beautiful, one-of-a-kind automobile was a \\"fascinating casualty\\" of the sinking of the Andrea Doria. As a result, the car was never shown to the public and was never seen by most of the stylists who worked on it. It is known to automotive historians, however, through photographs and specifications. Chrysler never used the cantilevered roof design in any subsequent vehicle. Automotive designer Dick Teague, who worked for Chrysler as a stylist during the mid-1950s, was responsible for many of American Motors' vehicles and the \\"Norseman's resemblance to the 1965 Rambler Marlin fastback coupe, or vice versa, was uncanny.\\" ==References== Norseman ","title":"Chrysler Norseman"},{"id":"2580675","text":"UMP is a three letter acronym that could mean: *Ulba Metallurgical Plant *Ultra metal-poor star, refers to a type of star with extremely low levels of heavier elements *Ulyanovsk Mechanical Plant *Uniformly most powerful test, in statistical hypothesis testing *United Midwestern Promoters, a racing sanctioning body *Universal Machine Pistol, as in Heckler & Koch UMP, a submachine gun *Universal mapping property *Universiti Malaysia Pahang, a university in Malaysia *Uridine monophosphate, a nucleotide *Uzumba-Maramba- Pfungwe, a district in Mashonaland East Province, in Zimbabwe ;In economics *Utility maximization problem ;In politics *Union for a Popular Movement or UMP, as of 2015 the former name of the main right-wing political party in France *Union of Moderate Parties or UMP, the main Vanuatuan francophone and conservative party *Universities' Model Parliament, a Canadian youth parliament organization ==See also== \\"Ump\\", a slang term for \\"umpire\\" :*WUMP, a sports radio station in Huntsville, Alabama, known as SportsRadio 730 The UMP ","title":"UMP"},{"id":"2580683","text":"MathSciNet is a searchable online bibliographic database created by the American Mathematical Society in 1996.

The kingdoms were all ruled by Jiménez kings who were first cousins: Sancho II of Castile, Sancho IV of Navarre, and Sancho Ramírez of Aragon, all grandsons of Sancho the Great. The primary source for the war is the thirteenth-century Primera crónica general. The brief war was ignited in part by the strife left over from the division of the kingdom of Sancho the Great in 1035. That division had left Navarre with a supremacy over the \\"petty kingdoms\\" (regula) of Castile and Aragon, but by 1065 Navarre was a vassal of Castile (now joined with the Kingdom of León). In 1065 Ferdinand the Great, the Castilian monarch died and his kingdom was divided between his sons, with the eldest, Sancho, taking Castile. Sancho of Castile was covetous of the lands of Bureba and Alta Rioja. Ferdinand had helped reconquer them from the Caliphate, but then had ceded them to his elder brother García Sánchez III of Navarre, the father of Sancho IV. After an initial series of frontier raids, Sancho IV of Navarre asked for an alliance from Sancho Ramírez of Aragon. Most of the war took place in the region of Burgos and La Rioja. The war was also fought over Castile's ability to take part in the Reconquista, a capacity which had been diminished by the division of Ferdinand's kingdom in 1065. Sancho of Castile did try to extend his influence over the Muslim taifa of Zaragoza, which owed him parias. According to the twelfth-century Crónica Najerense, a battle was fought during which campaign his alférez, Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, defeated his Navarrese counterpart, Jimeno Garcés, and gained the nickname campi doctor or \\"master of the field [of battle]\\", later to become famous in Spanish literature as el Campeador.The historicity of this event, which is not mentioned by contemporaries, has been suspected. José María Lacarra and Bernard Reilly, however, accept it. Between August and September 1067 Sancho Ramírez led a counterattack against Castile. Tradition is divided over who had the victory, the Chronicle of San Juan de la Peña attributes a rout to the Navarrese and Aragonese at Viana, while the Primera crónica attributes victory to Sancho of Castile. Ramón Menéndez Pidal and Bernard F. Reilly accept the latter tradition, Reilly citing a donation of December 1167 to the monastery of Oña by a Flaino Oriolez dominator Tetelie, a landholder in the Trespaderna district of the upper Ebro Valley. The participation of a Castilian magnate from the Navarrese border in an act by which Sancho formally defined the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Oca (the only bishopric in Castile) strongly suggests that Sancho was in a strong position.Reilly, pp. 40-41. The chronicler of San Juan de la Peña, a Navarrese source, wrote that Sancho of Castile was forced to raise the siege of Viana and flee on a horse bedecked only in its halter; that he subsequently convinced Abd ar-Rahman of Huesca to go to war with Aragon; and that Sancho Ramírez eventually made peace with him anyway. Castile retook Álava, the Montes de Oca, and Pancorvo, as well as Bureba and Alta Rioja, but the conflict ended in a stalemate 1067 when the death of Sancha of León, Ferdinand's widow, opened the way to war between Ferdinand's sons.Chaytor, p. 38. The central issue in the conflict, the possession of the border territories, was resolved in 1076 when Sancho IV of Navarre was assassinated by his own brother and his kingdom partitioned between Sancho Ramírez of Aragon, who became king of Navarre as Sancho V, and Alfonso VI of León and Castile, who received the disputed lands. ==Notes== ==References== *Constable, Olivie Remie, ed. \\"Concerning King Sancho I of Aragon and His Deeds\\" trans.

Hubrick (1858 - January 22, 1930) was an Alaskan adventurer, hunter, newsman and photographer best known for his panoramic photographs of the Wrangell mountain range through the early 1900s. A resident of McCarthy, Alaska, Hubrick started the town's first newspaper, the Cooper Bee in February 1916. The paper lasted for only three issues, however, and as such Hubrick's real legacy is derived from his photographic work. Hubrick's photographic talent is evident in his breathtaking panoramas of the Alaskan countryside. The panoramas can be over six feet long and some are hand-tinted in supreme detail. Some carry scenes from the past. In the Hubrick panorama \\"Goat Trail,\\" you can see many goats walking the trail. In the panorama \\"Taken From Nicolai Hill,\\" you get a little snapshot of the Hubrick party at a photography shoot. You can see two riding horses, pack animals, and his guide. It is said that most of Mr. Hubrick's photographs were personally sold in or around McCarthy, Alaska circa 1916-1930. The best count (guess) of known existing original photographic prints puts the number around 25. There are also some negatives. Hubrick copies are sold in Alaska for around $45. In addition to art, panoramas like those of J.P. Hubrick have other uses. They are used today to measure and compare changes in snow pack, providing valuable evidence on issues such as global warming. And herd sizes? How many goats, do you think, would be walking that trail today? Hubrick died of diabetes in 1930. His works are considered very rare.

It uses the NES Zapper light gun and is a capture the flag-style game played with paintball guns loaded with simulated paintballs. The game was loosely based on the 1985 Universal Studios film Gotcha!, starring Anthony Edwards. The player's mission is to get through the level, capture the enemy flag by shooting it, and return it to your base. This is while simultaneously trying not to get shot by the other team, run out of ammo, or run out of time. A light gun is necessary for this game, but one needs to also use the controller. The directional pad will move the screen left and right. Ammo boxes can be found sitting on the ground or carried by enemies in the background. It seems that only misses cost you ammo, so if one's aim is precise, they will receive a significant bonus for leftover ammunition. There are three levels in the game: Woods, Warehouse District and Snow Fields. The Woods and Snow Fields levels feature enemies in military garb, while the Warehouse District features enemies modeled after early 1980s punks. These rounds repeat in this order infinitely; each time around, the reaction time needed for the enemies to aim and fire is reduced. ==Paintball guns== In addition to the video game, Entertech (a division of LJN) produced and sold paintball guns—and related gear—for kids using the same name and logo as the video game. * The Enforcer, double pistol set * The Commando * protective glasses * targets * suits ==External links== * The Gotcha!

Matlock is a renowned, folksy yet cantankerous defense attorney who is worth every penny of his $100,000 fee. Known for visiting the scene of the crime to discover clues otherwise overlooked and his down-home style of coming up with viable, alternative theories of the crime in question (usually murder) while sitting in his office playing the banjo ukulele or polishing his shoes. Matlock also had conspicuously finicky fashion sense, and an insatiable appetite for hot dogs. Despite his high fees and apparent wealth, he is something of a cheapskate. Andy Griffith initially did not like the character due to his vanity and cheapness. Matlock is reported to be based on Georgia defense attorney Bobby Lee Cook. ==Early life== In high school, Ben played baseball, and hit a home run in the 9th inning (The Umpire). Ben worked for nine years prior to attending Harvard Law School, and accordingly was significantly older than his law school classmates. As such, Ben was not treated exceptionally well by his classmates, and one classmate purposely kept him out of Harvard's Law Review. (The Reunion) He ultimately graduated from Harvard Law in 1967.(The Reunion) While attending Harvard Law School, Ben tried to quit law school. His professor, Erskine Tate, threatened to beat him up. Later Ben recalled that Tate was his favorite professor and that he owed the professor a lot.(The Professor) Ben Matlock's first big case was defending a black cook, Cyrus Jordan (portrayed by Stan Shaw) in 1962, who was accused of murdering the sheriff in Mt. Harlan. Ben had become dissatisfied with being a D.A., and wanted to defend people, and decided to take Cyrus' case. ==Family== Ben Matlock is a widower who had two daughters, Charlene and Leanne, who both became lawyers in their own right and who both worked alongside their father at one point or another. His father, Charlie Matlock, was an auto repairman in Ben's hometown. He also had a goddaughter, Laura Miller (portrayed by Laura Robbins), whom he had not seen for the last 11 years since her mother's funeral. She worked at a clothing store at an Atlanta mall (The Godfather). ==Legal practice== Ben Matlock had been in practice since the early 1960s, has represented over 400 criminal cases (Diary of a Perfect Murder), and chose his cases based on the belief that his client was innocent. His retainer is $100,000. Ben Matlock had several assistants over the years, both as lawyers and private investigators. His lawyer assistants were his daughters Charlene Matlock and Leanne MacIntyre as well as Michelle Thomas and Cliff Lewis. His private investigators were Tyler Hudson, Conrad McMasters, Cliff Lewis, and Jerri Stone. His associates often walked into his house without knocking, eating with Ben, and having barbecue with him (The Confession). At times, Matlock has taken divorce and custody cases. One such case, concerning Carla Evans and her husband, was an unusual case for Matlock because he lost. Five years afterward, Carla was charged with murdering her ex-husband, and Matlock took the case pro bono as a way of apologizing to Carla (The Stripper). Losing a case was a rarity for Matlock, but he has had the occasion to correct that, as with Lester Matthews (The Convict), when Lester was tried for murdering a fellow inmate. Another one he lost was when Ken Wilson was arrested for killing his wife (The Black Widow). It took Matlock's client seven years for him to get out of custody. After his release, he was accused a second time, hence, his lawyer traveled to Los Angeles to reopen the case, a second time. He was found innocent. The third case he lost was to Dave Travis (The Pro), who was then convicted for killing Victor Tomasio. There was also (The Brothers) where Matlock lost the case when he got the other brother to admit to being involved in the murder and subsequently telling where the defendant was & his involvement. Matlock won in that he caught the killers but albeit in a different way that wouldn't break client-lawyer privilege as well as living up the agreement he'd made earlier to his client to defend him. A case he'd won where Drew Carey (The Fugitive), was found innocent for not killing Uncle Edwin. Although he didn't do it, the judge recommended Drew perform an indefinite community service, despite his volatile behavior, inside and outside of court. TV Actor Andy Griffith portrayed Ben Matlock for the duration of the Matlock television series. He also portrayed Charlie Matlock, Ben's father, in flashbacks. ==Songs Ben Matlock sings in Matlock== *My Buddy by Anne Murray in The Starlet, accompanied on banjo. ==See also== *List of characters in Matlock ==References== ==External links== *The Unofficial Matlock Website Category:Fictional American lawyers Category:Fictional Harvard University people ","title":"Ben Matlock"},{"id":"2580712","text":"Yogi's Great Escape is a 1987 animated made-for-television film produced by Hanna-Barbera as part of the Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10 series. The two-hour film aired in syndication. ==Plot== One spring, Yogi and Boo Boo awake from hibernation to discover three orphaned bear cubs left at the front door of their cave. Despite their initial reservations, Yogi and Boo Boo take the bear cubs into their home and take care of them. Meanwhile, Jellystone Park has gone over budget and the park commissioner orders Ranger Smith to close it down. This means that Yogi, along with the other bears at the park, must be sent to a zoo. Because Yogi can't stand the thought of being cooped up in a zoo for the rest of his life, he hatches an elaborate escape plan. Salvaging car parts from a failed fishing expedition, he constructs a getaway \\"Supercar,\\" complete with a picnic basket rumble seat for the three orphaned cubs. Together they make their escape from the park to find a new home. After Ranger Smith initially fails to capture Yogi, he hires a professional trapper and his hound Yapper. However, it turns out that Trapper and Yapper are more of a hindrance to Ranger Smith's efforts rather than a help. Yogi and his friends go through several adventures along their journey. Their first stop is at a watermelon patch. After eating their fill of watermelons, the bears retire to a seemingly abandoned tree house. It turns out to be the secret clubhouse of the Bike Brigade, three boys who ride bicycles and operate a shortwave radio. When the boys return, they believe the bears are alien invaders and attack them with their squirt guns. After Yogi surrenders, they recognize him and decide to help him in his escape. Using their radio, the boys call ahead to their cohorts in other clubs around the country to watch for Yogi and help him in his getaway. Next they find themselves in a western ghost town. Apparently the only remaining resident is the sheriff, Quick Draw McGraw, who mistakes Yogi and Boo Boo for two bank robbers and throws them in jail along with the three cubs. The Lone Raiders, another club in league with the Bike Brigade, help spring Yogi from jail and capture the real robbers, who turn out to be close look-alikes to Yogi and Boo Boo. Yogi and his friends then find themselves on the bayou. Wally Gator, another zoo fugitive, inhabits a spooky steamboat, complete with ghostly illusions intended to scare away zookeepers. He takes in Yogi and his friends and serves them a fabulous dinner. When Ranger Smith, Trapper, and Yapper show up, Wally and the bears attempt to scare them away. However, the sudden appearance of a real ghost makes everyone run for their lives. While the anonymous ghost pursues the hunters, Yogi and his friends are rescued by another club, the Swamp Foxes. The Supercar next stops at a carnival where the bears meet up with Yogi's old friend Snagglepuss. Snagglepuss hides the bears from Ranger Smith by disguising them in his stage show of Egyptian dancers. When Ranger Smith sees through the disguises, the bears escape to a hot air balloon and take off. As the balloon floats across the country, Ranger Smith and his cohorts follow in hot pursuit. After the Trapper and Yapper attempt to grapple the balloon from the top of Mount Rushmore, they fall and are not seen again. The balloon finally snags on the antenna of the Empire State Building in a dense fog. Ranger Smith approaches the balloon in a helicopter and hands Yogi a telephone; the President of the United States tells Yogi that he is not going to let Jellystone Park close after all, and that Yogi and his friends may return to their home. ==Character voices== *Daws Butler as Yogi Bear *Susan Blu as Buzzy, Little Cowgirl, Swamp Fox Girl, Girl and Swamp Fox Kid #2 *William Callaway as Dad and Trapper *Hamilton Camp as Li'l Brother Bear *Dustin Diamond as Chubby Kid *Patrick Fraley as Cowboy Kid #1, Reporter and Swamp Fox Kid *Edan Gross as Bitsy *Allan Melvin as Bandit Bear *Tress MacNeille as Boy, Cowboy Kid #2, Mom and Swamp Fox Boy *Scott Menville as Leader Kid *Don Messick as Boo Boo Bear and Ranger Smith *Josh Rodine as Skinny Kid *Frank Welker as Bopper, Real Ghost and Yapper ===Uncredited=== *Daws Butler as Quick Draw McGraw, Wally Gator and Snagglepuss ==Computer game== A platform video game based on the movie was released in 1990.

Patients with symptoms of dizziness or lightheadedness, with or without a loss of consciousness (fainting), suspected to be associated with a drop in blood pressure or positional tachycardia are good candidates for this test. The procedure tests for causes of syncope by attempting to cause syncope by having the patient lie flat on a special table or bed and then be monitored with ECG and a blood pressure monitor which measure continuous, beat to beat, non- invasively. The table then creates a change in posture from lying to standing. ==Preparations== Before taking the test, the patient may be instructed to fast for a period before the test will take place and to stop taking any medications. On the day of the tilt table test, an intravenous line may be placed in case the patient needs to be given medications quickly; however, this may influence the results of the test and may only be indicated in particular circumstances. More recently, most investigators monitor cerebral perfusion pressure using mean flow velocity recording with transcranial Doppler ultrasound in supine horizontal position, during and after head-up tilt. An 18 MHz ultrasound transducer is placed on the temporal bone above the cheekbone, using headgear to hold the probe in place. ==Procedure== A tilt table test can be done in different ways and be modified for individual circumstances. In some cases, the patient will be strapped to a tilt table lying flat and then tilted or suspended completely or almost completely upright (as if standing). Most of the time, the patient is suspended at an angle of 60 to 80 degrees. Sometimes, the patient will be given a drug, such as Glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerin) or isoproterenol, to create further susceptibility to the test. In all cases, the patient is instructed not to move. Symptoms, blood pressure, pulse, electrocardiogram, and sometimes blood oxygen saturation are recorded. The test either ends when the patient faints or develops other significant symptoms, or after a set period (usually from 20 to 45 minutes, depending on the facility or individualized protocol). ==Diagnostic symptoms== A tilt table test is considered positive if the patient experiences symptoms associated with a drop in blood pressure or cardiac arrhythmia. A normal person's blood pressure will not drop dramatically while standing, because the body will compensate for this posture with a slight increase in heart rate and constriction of the blood vessels in the legs. If this process does not function normally in the patient, the test could provoke signs and symptoms ranging from minor lightheadedness to a very severe cardiac episode, depending on the person. A common side effect during tilt table testing is a feeling of heaviness and warmth in the lower extremities. This is due to blood pooling in the legs and, to onlookers, the patient's lower extremities may appear blotchy, pink, or red. Dizziness or lightheadedness are also likely to occur in susceptible patients. Tilt table testing could provoke fainting or syncope. It is the purpose of the test to provoke these symptoms, in order to aid in diagnosis. It may not be appropriate, or indeed even possible, to stop the test before fainting occurs, as the drop in blood pressure or pulse rate associated with fainting can come on in seconds. This is why the patient's blood pressure and ECG should be continuously monitored during the test. If at any time in tilt table testing a patient loses consciousness, he or she will be returned to a supine or head down position and will be given immediate medical attention, which could include being given fluids or perhaps atropine or a sympathomimetic drug like epinephrine or ephedrine which will raise blood pressure and heart rate rapidly. In extreme cases, tilt table testing could provoke seizures or even cause the heart to stop. The heart resumes beating normally upon being returned to a flat or head-down position. A drop in blood pressure during the tilt table test is indicative of orthostatic hypotension. A marked increase in heart rate in the absence of orthostatic hypotension is indicative of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. ==See also== * Dix–Hallpike test ==References== ==External links== * 2004 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines on Management (Diagnosis and Treatment) of Syncope.

Schulz. It was originally aired on the CBS network on October 30, 1981. It was released to DVD on January 2, 2004 as a bonus feature with the special A Charlie Brown Valentine. In this special, Charlie Brown looks for a girl he saw at a football game, with Linus's help. ==Synopsis== Charlie Brown is watching a football game on television when he spots a girl from a honey shot in the stands that just made his heart melt. He is then crushed when the game ends and he feels he may never see her again. Not determined to lose what he feels is his true love, he enlists Linus to help him find her. First they go to the football stadium to try to locate where she was sitting. Charlie remembers she was sitting next to tunnel #13 \\"because that's [his] lucky number.\\" Then he has Linus sit where he determined she was sitting to recreate the shot in his head. Charlie and Linus try asking someone in the ticket booth who she was, but they do not know, and suggest to check the season ticket records downtown, and that is where they go. Meanwhile, Snoopy and Woodstock are, unbeknownst to either of them, following behind. In the stadium, Woodstock attempts to kick and catch a punted football from Snoopy to no avail, then go into an exercise room where Woodstock gets a laugh out of watching Snoopy in a very sophisticated exercise machine. Linus is asked by an overly nervous Charlie to ask who it was. Linus is given a list of names, addresses and phone numbers of those who were sitting in that space, and they are on their way. Meanwhile, Snoopy and Woodstock are still behind them, and Snoopy tries to help Woodstock get a drink of water in the drinking fountain, but ends up almost drowning him. Charlie and Linus go to the first house, where the first girl (voiced by Nicole Eggert) is as young as them but is not pretty. Linus, who is doing the talking due to Charlie's nervousness, then gets the thumbs-down from Charlie, and they move on to the next house, but not before Linus almost ditches Charlie out of annoyance. At the next house, they meet a teenage girl who is rather stunning but has a very raspy voice. As soon as she finds out it is Charlie who likes her, she gets rather upset that it is a kid, and tells both of them to leave. Finally they make their way to a property called the Happy Valley Farm (after Charlie himself almost abandons the whole thing because getting there was so far out of town) where the third girl lives. Snoopy and Woodstock are already there, and after Snoopy has some major problems getting across the cattle guard at the intersection of the main driveway, he and Woodstock encounter a rather mean bobcat (Similar to the cat that was in Race For Your Life, Charlie Brown) who chases them back across those rollers (where Snoopy has problems again), where they finally meet up with Charlie and Linus. Charlie dismisses Snoopy's attempts to warn him of the bobcat, and he and Linus walk in past the cat petting him as they go...then they both learn for themselves. Linus learns on the phone of another entrance, and is warned that the bobcat is actually very sweet but does not like strangers much. They finally get to the house, where Linus encounters the correct girl, but completely forgets about Charlie and has fallen for her when he realizes she also carries a security blanket, and realizes she feels the same for him. He goes in, leaving Charlie behind. Charlie, after being chased out of the yard by the bobcat, just decides to wait, completely clueless of the situation. In the meantime, Snoopy and Woodstock manage to get in the house without a hitch after Snoopy scares the bobcat up a tree. Meanwhile, Charlie continues to wait. Eventually Snoopy and Woodstock leave and do not pay any attention to Charlie. Finally Linus leaves (and the bobcat is shown warming up to him), and is so smitten by the girl (whose name is Mary Jo), he is completely oblivious of Charlie's protests. Realizing Linus had stolen her from him, he runs off screaming in disbelief. As Charlie is walking home, he appears to be depressed, but appears to also be somewhat happy and floating, apparently hoping it was all just a dream. He gets home, sleeps for the rest of the night, until there is a knock at the door the next morning. Hoping it is Mary Jo, it turns out to be Snoopy asking to be fed, but he ignores him and walks on by depressed again. He meets Linus at the wall, and they discuss the previous day. It eventually ends when Linus checks his watch and realizes he needs to leave, because he was invited to a barbecue at Mary Jo's farm. Charlie stays and pulls out a book, reads a couple of old sayings about lost love, then closes the book with a sigh, resigning to the fact that he and Mary Jo were never meant to be. ==Voice cast== *Grant Wehr as Charlie Brown *Earl Reilly as Linus Van Pelt *Bill Melendez as Snoopy and Woodstock *Nicole Eggert as First girl *Jennifer Gaffin as Mary Jo *Melissa Strawmeyer as Teenager ==References== ==External links== * Category:Animated television specials Category:CBS television specials Category:Peanuts television specials Category:Television programs directed by Phil Roman Category:1980s American television specials Category:1981 television specials Category:1981 in American television ","title":"Someday You'll Find Her, Charlie Brown"},{"id":"2580746","text":"Tompkins County Public Library (TCPL) is the public library for residents of Tompkins County, New York. The library has one branch which is located in Ithaca, New York. ==History== Cornell Free Library, Seneca and Tioga streets, 1864 to 1960. Tompkins County Public Library, 312 N. Cayuga Street, 1969 to 2000. Ithaca's first public library was founded by Ezra Cornell as the Cornell Free Library and chartered by the New York State Legislature in 1864. Circulation began on March 4, 1867. It stood at the southeast corner of Seneca and Tioga streets from 1864 to 1960. Early classes and commencement of Cornell University took place in the library. In 1967 the library was re-designated as the county's library when the county paid for the construction of a new $1.7 million building. This new building opened at 312 North Cayuga Street in February 1969. By the 1990s, the library had outgrown the space at North Cayuga Street. In November 2000, the library moved to a renovated former Woolworths department store, which was double the size of the old building. This current building is located at the corner of Cayuga and Green Street (New York Route 79) just south of the Ithaca Commons. In November 2010 the library celebrated ten years in the current building. The Library began celebration for its Sesquicentennial in 2014. As part of that celebration, a mural of founder Ezra Cornell was hung on the exterior wall of the library building in October 2016. ==Description== The Library serves as the Central Library of the five-county Finger Lakes Library System http://www.flls.org/ and provides free and equal access to residents of Tompkins, Cayuga, Cortland, Seneca, Schuyler and Tioga counties. TCPL hosts nearly one million visitors each year, making it the single, largest driver of traffic to downtown Ithaca. The library provides access to digital resources, including wireless internet access, databases and eBooks, as well as an extensive print collection. It also serves as the cultural hub of Tompkins County, providing museum quality art exhibits, opportunities for civic engagement and programs for children, teens and adults. The library's primary budget allocation comes from Tompkins County, with additional support from the Tompkins County Public Library Foundation and The Friends of the Tompkins County Public Library. In November 2014, The Tompkins County Public Library Foundation announced a $2.75 million Campaign for a 21st Century Library in support of the construction of a digital literacy lab, a teen center, collection expansion and endowment building.http://www.tcplfoundation.org/#! Another $1.4 million was granted in 2016 for the creation of a teen center and renovations to the interior. Part of the Campaign for a 21st Century Library is the LEGO Library, which was led by Peter and Andrew McCracken. It features a 6' by 6' model of the library post-renovation.https://www.tcplfoundation.org/tcpl-lego-build Support from the Friends of the Tompkins County Public Library is funded by the Friends of the Tompkins County Public Library Booksale.

Adhesins are a type of virulence factor. Adherence is an essential step in bacterial pathogenesis or infection, required for colonizing a new host. Adhesion and bacterial adhesins are also a potential target for prophylaxis or treatment of bacterial infections. ==Background== Bacteria are typically found attached to and living in close association with surfaces. During the bacterial lifespan, a bacterium is subjected to frequent shear-forces. In the crudest sense, bacterial adhesins serve as anchors allowing bacteria to overcome these environmental shear forces, thus remaining in their desired environment. However, bacterial adhesins do not serve as a sort of universal bacterial Velcro. Rather, they act as specific surface recognition molecules, allowing the targeting of a particular bacterium to a particular surface such as root tissue in plants, lacrimal duct tissues in mammals, or even tooth enamel. FimH is a bacterial adhesin that helps bacteria such as Escherichia coli to bind to host cells and their receptors (here: the human proteins CD48 and TLR4, or mannose residues). Most fimbria of gram- negative bacteria function as adhesins, but in many cases it is a minor subunit protein at the tip of the fimbriae that is the actual adhesin. In gram-positive bacteria, a protein or polysaccharide surface layer serves as the specific adhesin. To effectively achieve adherence to host surfaces, many bacteria produce multiple adherence factors called adhesins. Bacterial adhesins provide species and tissue tropism. Adhesins are expressed by both pathogenic bacteria and saprophytic bacteria. This prevalence marks them as key microbial virulence factors in addition to a bacterium's ability to produce toxins and resist the immune defenses of the host. ==Structures== Through the mechanisms of evolution, different species of bacteria have developed different solutions to the problem of attaching receptor specific proteins to the bacteria surface. Today many different types and subclasses of bacterial adhesins may be observed in the literature. The typical structure of a bacterial adhesion is that of a fimbria or pilus. The bacterial adhesion consists primarily of an intramembranous structural protein which provides a scaffold upon which several extracellular adhesins may be attached. However, as in the case of the CFA1 fimbriae, the structural protein itself can sometimes act as an adhesion if a portion of the protein extends into the ECM. ===FimH adhesin—structure=== The best characterized bacterial adhesin is the type 1 fimbrial FimH adhesin. This adhesin is responsible for D-mannose sensitive adhesion. The bacterium synthesizes a precursor protein consisting of 300 amino acids then processes the protein by removing several signal peptides ultimately leaving a 279 amino acid protein. Mature FimH is displayed on the bacterial surface as a component of the type 1 fimbrial organelle. In 1999, the structure of FimH was resolved via x-ray crystallography. FimH is folded into two domains. The N terminal adhesive domain plays the main role in surface recognition while the C-terminal domain is responsible for organelle integration. A tetra-peptide loop links the two domains. Additionally, a carbohydrate-binding pocket has been identified at the tip of the N-terminal adhesive domain. This basic structure is conserved across type 1 fimbrial adhesins though recent studies have shown that in vitro induced mutations can lead to the addition of C-terminal domain specificity resulting in a bacterial adhesion with dual bending sites and related binding phenotypes. ==As virulence factors== The majority of bacterial pathogens exploit specific adhesion to host cells as their main virulence factor. \\"A large number of bacterial adhesins with individual receptor specificities have been identified.\\" Many bacterial pathogens are able to express an array of different adhesins. Expression of these adhesins at different phases during infection play the most important role in adhesion based virulence. Numerous studies have shown that inhibiting a single adhesin in this coordinated effort can often be enough to make a pathogenic bacterium non-virulent. This has led to the exploration of adhesin activity interruption as a method of bacterial infection treatment. ==Vaccines based on adhesins== The study of adhesins as a point of exploitation for vaccines comes from early studies which indicated that an important component of protective immunity against certain bacteria came from an ability to prevent adhesin binding. Additionally, Adhesins are attractive vaccine candidates because they are often essential to infection and are surface-located, making them readily accessible to antibodies. The effectiveness of anti-adhesin antibodies is illustrated by studies with FimH, the adhesin of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Work with E. coli stems from observations of human acquired immunity. Children in third world countries may suffer from several episodes of E. coli associated diarrhea during the first three years of life. If the child survives this initial period of susceptibility, infection rates typically drop substantially. Field studies show that this acquired immunity is directed primarily against bacterial adhesins. Recent studies from Worcester Polytechnic Institute show that the consumption of cranberry juice may inhibit the action of UPEC adhesins. Using atomic force microscopy researchers have shown that adhesion forces decrease with time following cranberry juice consumption. This research has opened the door to further exploration of orally administered vaccines which exploit bacterial adhesins. A number of problems create challenges for the researcher exploring the anti-adhesin immunity concept. First, a large number of different bacterial adhesins target the same human tissues. Further, an individual bacterium can produce multiple different types of adhesin, at different times, in different places, and in response to different environmental triggers. Finally, many adhesins present as different immunologically distinct antigenic varieties, even within the same clone (as is the case in Neisseria gonorrhoeae). Despite these challenges, progress is being made in the creation of anti-adhesion vaccines. In animal models, passive immunization with anti FimH-antibodies and vaccination with the protein significantly reduced colonization by UPEC. Moreover, the Bordetella pertussis adhesins FHA and pertactin are components of three of the four acellular pertussis vaccines currently licensed for use in the U.S. Additionally, anti-adhesion vaccines are being explored as a solution to urinary tract infection (UTIs). The use of synthetic FimH adhesion peptides was shown to prevent urogenital mucosal infection by E. coli in mice. ==Specific examples== ===Dr family=== The Dr family of adhesins bind to the Dr blood group antigen component of decay-accelerating factor (DAF). These proteins contain both fimbriated and afimbriated adherence structures and mediate adherence of uropathogenic Escherichia coli to the urinary tract. They do so by inducing the development of long cellular extensions that wrap around the bacteria. They also confer the mannose-resistant hemaglutination phenotype, which can be inhibited by chloramphenicol. The N-terminal portion of the mature protein is thought to be responsible for chloramphenicol sensitivity. Also, they induce activation of several signal transduction cascades, including activation of PI-3 kinase. The Dr family of adhesins are particularly associated with cystitis and pregnancy-associated pyelonephritis.Identified Virulence Factors of UPEC : Adherence, State Key Laboratory for Moleclular Virology and Genetic Engineering, Beijing. Retrieved July 2011 Multivalent Adhesion Molecules Multivalent Adhesion Molecules (MAMs) are a widespread family of adhesins found in Gram negative bacteria, including E. coli, Vibrio, Yersinia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MAMs contain tandem repeats of mammalian cell entry (MCE) domains which specifically bind to extracellular matrix proteins and anionic lipids on host tissues. Since they are abundant in many pathogens of clinical importance, Multivalent Adhesion Molecules are a potential target for prophylactic or therapeutic anti- infectives. The use of a MAM targeting adhesion inhibitor was shown to significantly decrease the colonization of burn wounds by multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in rats. ===N. gonorroheae=== N. gonorrhoeae is host restricted almost entirely to humans. \\"Extensive studies have established type 4 fimbrial adhesins of N. gonorrhoeae virulence factors.\\" These studies have shown that only strains capable of expressing fimbriae are pathogenic. High survival of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) characterizes Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections. Additionally, recent studies out of Stockholm have shown that Neisseria can hitchhike on PMNs using their adhesin pili thus hiding them from neutrophil phagocytic activity. This action facilitates the spread of the pathogen throughout the epithelial cell layer. ===E. coli=== Escherichia coli strains most known for causing diarrhea can be found in the intestinal tissue of pigs and humans where they express the K88 and CFA1. to attach to the intestinal lining. Additionally, UPEC causes about 90% of urinary tract infections. Of those E. coli which cause UTIs, 95% express type 1 fimbriae. FimH in E. coli overcomes the antibody based immune response by natural conversion from the high to the low affinity state. Through this conversion, FimH adhesion may shed the antibodies bound to it. Escherichia coli FimH provides an example of conformation specific immune response which enhances impact on the protein. By studying this particular adhesion, researchers hope to develop adhesion-specific vaccines which may serve as a model for antibody-mediation of pathogen adhesion. ==See also== * Fungal adhesin * Trimeric autotransporter adhesins (TAA) ==References== Adhesins are also used in cell communication, and bind to surface communicators.

Schulz. It was originally aired on the CBS network on March 19, 1979, making it the last Peanuts TV special of the 1970s. It has been released to DVD by Warner Home Video as a bonus feature to You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown. It appeared in remastered form in the Peanuts 1970s Collection Vol. 2. ==Synopsis== Charlie Brown decides to enter the Junior Olympics at his school after it is revealed he and his family are not going on vacation after all (even though he thought he would). The decathlon is the only thing left open, and Charlie Brown accepts the challenge (of course after everyone else there refused to take on such a tough event before Charlie Brown showed up). Peppermint Patty, who is the school's coordinator for the Junior Olympics, oversees Charlie Brown's rigorous training for the event. Marcie also watches (and gives encouragement), and Snoopy works out with him (showing how in-shape he is and how out of shape Charlie Brown is in the process). During a review of the ten events, Patty worries about whether or not he could win and decides to enter Marcie to back him up. On day one, Charlie Brown is introduced to his competitors: Marcie, Freddie Fabulous from Fremont (defending Decathlon champ and smug egotist who calls Charlie Brown \\"Pumpkin head\\"), and Snoopy's alter ego from Ace Obedience School, The Masked Marvel (making his first appearance since You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown four years earlier). He places well in the first five events, enough to place him in third after the day is over. Lucy states she is annoyed that Charlie Brown cannot be a total blockhead by his third-place ranking, as the Masked Marvel came in dead last (even after winning the final event of the first day, the 400m dash). Day two starts off bad for Charlie Brown. First, he feels nervous due to the increased pressure, then he performs badly in the 110m high hurdles (knocking down all but one hurdle and finishing last by a mile). However, after a tough talk from Peppermint Patty, a great showing in the pole vault and first-place finishes in the discus and javelin throw catapult him into first place. Now it's all on the 1500m run to finish it all off and be the school's hero. When Charlie Brown gains the lead over Freddie Fabulous, Lucy is aghast that the world must be ending as Charlie Brown is coming in first. Unfortunately, after taking the lead, Charlie Brown closes his eyes and daydreams of his victory and winds up running off the track, off the school grounds...and out of contention. Peppermint Patty sees this and cries (since Charlie Brown was daydreaming), \\"Good grief! He ran off the track! He lost the race!\\" It is learned afterward that their school still won the Junior Olympics, due to Marcie winning the 1500m (and thus the decathlon) and the disqualifications of Freddie Fabulous and The Masked Marvel (for fighting on the track).

She starred in a number of films in the 1950s, including Bend of the River (1952) opposite James Stewart and Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954). She was also known for her small screen role as Paula Denning on the 1980s soap opera Capitol and recurring role of Eve Simpson on Murder, She Wrote. ==Early years== Julie Adams was born as Betty May Adams on October 17, 1926 in Waterloo, Iowa, the daughter of Arkansas-born parents Esther Gertrude (Beckett) and Ralph Adams, who was a cotton buyer. Her family moved a great deal; the longest she lived in one town was eight years in Blytheville, Arkansas. In 1946, at the age of 19, she was crowned \\"Miss Little Rock\\" and then moved to Hollywood, California to pursue her acting career. Adams worked as a part-time secretary and began her film career in B movie westerns. ==Career== Jack Kelly in Maverick ===Film=== She used her real name until 1949, when she began working for Universal-International, the same studio where she met future stars such as James Best, Piper Laurie, Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis. She then became \\"Julia\\" and eventually \\"Julie\\". In 1954, she explained the latter change, \\"The studio picked Julia, but I never have felt comfortable with it. I just like the name Julie better, and the studio has given me permission to make the change.\\" Her first movie role was a minor part in Red, Hot and Blue (1949), followed by a leading role in the Lippert western The Dalton Gang (1949). Adams was featured as the bathing beauty Kay Lawrence in the science-fiction film Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954).Exclusive Interview: Julie Adams on THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON at Mile High Horror! , fangoria.com; accessed October 13, 2016. Adams co-starred in 1950s films opposite some of Hollywood's top leading men, including with James Stewart in 1952's Bend of the River, with Rock Hudson in The Lawless Breed (1953) and One Desire (1955), with Tyrone Power in The Mississippi Gambler (1953), with Glenn Ford in The Man from the Alamo (1953), with Charlton Heston in The Private War of Major Benson (1955), with Dan Duryea in Slaughter on Tenth Avenue (1957) and with Joel McCrea in The Gunfight at Dodge City (1959). Adams co-starred with Rory Calhoun, known for his role in How to Marry a Millionaire (1953), in the film The Looters (1955), the story of a plane crash in the Rocky Mountains. Part of the picture was filmed about Tarryall Creek at what is now Eleven Mile State Park in Park County in central Colorado.

Adams was famously menaced in the 1954 horror classic Creature from the Black Lagoon Adams also starred in 1957's Four Girls in Town, a romantic comedy about four young women competing for the leading role in a new movie, featuring an international cast. She appeared with Elvis Presley in the musical-comedy Tickle Me (1965). Adams thought highly of her co-star, noting: \\"Despite his status as a superstar singer and stage performer, Elvis took his acting very seriously. He was always prepared, and did a good job in the roles he was given. When he did his musical numbers in Tickle Me, sometimes walking from table to table in a nightclub set, he did them perfectly in one take.\\" ===Television=== Julie Adams (1953) On television, Adams appeared on The Andy Griffith Show portraying Mary Simpson, a county nurse and romantic interest of Sheriff Andy Taylor in a 1962 episode. She also made four guest appearances on Perry Mason; the most memorable was the 1963 episode, \\"The Case of the Deadly Verdict,\\" when she played Janice Barton, Mason's only convicted client during the show's nine-year run on CBS. The Case Of Lovers Leap” 4/4/1963. In 1964, she played Janice Blake in \\"The Case of the Missing Button\\". In 1965, she played the role of defendant Pat Kean in \\"The Case of the Fatal Fortune.\\" Adams appeared on The Rifleman as a dubious vixen and romantic interest of lead character Chuck Connors. She guest-starred in five episodes of 77 Sunset Strip, on Alfred Hitchcock Presents three times, and on Maverick twice. More guest-star roles in popular television series followed, including McMillan & Wife, Police Woman, The Streets of San Francisco, The Incredible Hulk, Cannon, Quincy, M.E., and Cagney & Lacey. Adams co-starred with James Stewart in The Jimmy Stewart Show on NBC in 1971-1972. Stewart played a professor, and Adams played his wife.Brooks, Tim & Marsh, Earle (1979). The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network TV Shows: 1946-Present. Ballantine Books. . P. 307. She was cast in the recurring role of real estate agent Eve Simpson for ten episodes of CBS's Murder, She Wrote. ===Writing=== Adams, along with her son, Mitchell, authored a book on her life and career, The Lucky Southern Star: Reflections From The Black Lagoon, which was published in 2011. A limited test print run of 100 copies with an interview DVD of the audio book version was completed. Her son served as producer. ===Appearances=== Adams joined three other cast members from Creature from the Black Lagoon for a 50th anniversary celebration of the film at Creaturefest in November 2003. The festival was held at Wakulla Springs, just south of Tallahassee, Florida, where underwater scenes were filmed in 1953. In August 2012, she was a guest of honor at the Los Angeles Comic Book and Science Fiction Convention held at the Shrine Auditorium. (She attended the same convention in May 2012.) She also appeared at the CineCon Classic Film Festival on August 31, 2012 at the Loews Hollywood Hotel. She was a scheduled guest at The Hollywood Show in Chicago from September 7–9, 2012. An additional book signing was held at Century Books in Pasadena, California, on September 20, 2012. On October 13, 2012, she was back in Berwyn, Illinois for a book signing party. In October 2012, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences selected Creature from the Black Lagoon as one of 13 classic horror films to screen to honor the 100th anniversary of Universal Pictures. The film was shown (in 3D format) on October 16 at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California. After the screening, Adams appeared on stage for a Q&A; session where she shared personal memories of her role in the film, as well as several other career projects on which she had worked. ==Personal life and death== Adams was married to screenwriter Leonard B. Stern from 1950/1951 to 1953. She was then married to actor-director Ray Danton from 1954/55 until their divorce in 1981. They had two sons: Steven Danton (b. 1956), an assistant director, and Mitchell Danton (b. 1962), an editor. Adams died on February 3, 2019 in Los Angeles, California, aged 92. She is survived by her two sons. Her remains are buried at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Malvern, Arkansas. ==Awards== In 1999, Adams received a Golden Boot award for her work in Westerns. She was inducted into the Arkansas Entertainers Hall of Fame in 2000. At CineCon in 2011, Adams was honored with a Film Career Achievement Award. In 2012, she won the Rondo Award for the Monster Kid Hall of Fame at the annual Wonderfest in Louisville, Kentucky. ==Selected filmography== *Your Show Time (1949, TV Series) ....

William Kingdon Clifford coined the term motor for a kinematic operator in his \\"Preliminary Sketch of Biquaternions\\" (1873). He used split-complex numbers for scalars in his split- biquaternions. Motor variable is used here in place of split-complex variable for euphony and tradition. For example, :f(z) = u(z) + j \\\\ v(z) ,\\\\ z = x + j y ,\\\\ x,y \\\\in R ,\\\\quad j^2 = +1,\\\\quad u(z),v(z) \\\\in R. Functions of a motor variable provide a context to extend real analysis and provide compact representation of mappings of the plane. However, the theory falls well short of function theory on the ordinary complex plane. Nevertheless, some of the aspects of conventional complex analysis have an interpretation given with motor variables. ==Elementary functions of a motor variable== Let D = \\\\\\\\{ z = x + jy : x,y \\\\in R \\\\\\\\}, the split-complex plane. The following exemplar functions f have domain and range in D: The action of a hyperbolic versor u = \\\\exp(aj) = \\\\cosh a + j \\\\sinh a is combined with translation to produce the affine transformation :f(z) = uz + c \\\\ . When c = 0, the function is equivalent to a squeeze mapping. The squaring function has no analogy in ordinary complex arithmetic. Let : f(z) = z^2 \\\\ and note that f(-1)=f(j)= f(-j) = 1. \\\\ The result is that the four quadrants are mapped into one, the identity component: :U_1 = \\\\\\\\{z \\\\in D : \\\\mid y \\\\mid < x \\\\\\\\}. Note that z z^* = 1 \\\\ forms the unit hyperbola x^2 - y^2 = 1 . Thus the reciprocation :f(z) = 1/z = z^*/\\\\mid z \\\\mid^2 \\\\text{where} \\\\mid z \\\\mid^2 = z z^* involves the hyperbola as curve of reference as opposed to the circle in C. On the extended complex plane one has the class of functions called Möbius transformations: :f(z) = \\\\frac {az + b} {cz + d}. Using the concept of a projective line over a ring, the projective line P(D) is formed and acted on by the group of homographies GL(2,D). The construction uses homogeneous coordinates with split-complex number components. On the ordinary complex plane, the Cayley transform carries the upper half-plane to the unit disk, thus bounding it. A mapping of the identity component U1 into a rectangle provides a comparable bounding action: :f(z) = \\\\frac {1}{z + 1/2}, \\\\quad f:U_1 \\\\to T where T = {z = x + jy : y < x < 1 or y < 2 – x when 1 ≤ x <2}. ==Exp, log, and square root== The exponential function carries the whole plane D into U1: :e^x = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty {x^n \\\\over n!} = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {x^{2n}} {(2n)!} + \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {x^{2n+1}} {(2n+1)!} = \\\\cosh x + \\\\sinh x . Thus when x = bj, then ex is a hyperbolic versor. For the general motor variable z = a + bj, one has :e^z = e^a (\\\\cosh b + j \\\\ \\\\sinh b) \\\\ . In the theory of functions of a motor variable special attention should be called to the square root and logarithm functions. In particular, the plane of split-complex numbers consists of four connected components and the set of singular points that have no inverse: the diagonals z = x ± x j, x ∈ R. The identity component, namely {z : x > y }, is the range of the squaring function and the exponential. Thus it is the domain of the square root and logarithm functions. The other three quadrants do not belong in the domain because square root and logarithm are defined as one-to-one inverses of the squaring function and the exponential function. Graphic description of the logarithm of D is given by Motter & Rosa in their article \\"Hyperbolic Calculus\\" (1998). ==D-holomorphic functions== The Cauchy–Riemann equations that characterize holomorphic functions on a domain in the complex plane have an analogue for functions of a motor variable. An approach to D-holomorphic functions using a Wirtinger derivative was given by Motter & Rossa:A.E. Motter & M.A.F. Rosa (1998) \\"Hyperbolic Calculus\\", Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras 8(1):109-28 The function f = u + j v is called D-holomorphic when :0 \\\\ = \\\\ ({\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial x} - j {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial y}) (u + j v) := \\\\ u_x - j^2 v_y + j (v_x - u_y). By considering real and imaginary components, a D-holomorphic function satisfies :u_x = v_y, \\\\quad v_x = u_y. These equations were publishedGeorg Scheffers (1893) \\"Verallgemeinerung der Grundlagen der gewohnlichen komplexen Funktionen\\", Sitzungsberichte Sachs. Ges. Wiss, Math- phys Klasse Bd 45 S. 828-42 in 1893 by Georg Scheffers, so they have been called \\"Scheffers' conditions\\"Isaak Yaglom (1988) Felix Klein & Sophus Lie, The Evolution of the Idea of Symmetry in the Nineteenth Century, Birkhäuser Verlag, p. 203 The comparable approach in harmonic function theory can be viewed in a text by Peter DurenPeter Duren (2004) Harmonic Mappings in the Plane, pp. 3,4, Cambridge University Press It is apparent that the components u and v of a D-holomorphic function f satisfy the wave equation, associated with D'Alembert, whereas components of C-holomorphic functions satisfy Laplace's equation. ==La Plata lessons== At the National University of La Plata in 1935, J.C. Vignaux, an expert in convergence of infinite series, contributed four articles on the motor variable to the university's annual periodical.Vignaux, J.C. & A. Durañona y Vedia (1935) \\"Sobre la teoría de las funciones de una variable compleja hiperbólica\\", Contribución al Estudio de las Ciencias Físicas y Matemáticas, pp. 139–184, Universidad Nacional de La Plata, República Argentina He is the sole author of the introductory one, and consulted with his department head A. Durañona y Vedia on the others. In \\"Sobre las series de numeros complejos hiperbolicos\\" he says (p. 123): :This system of hyperbolic complex numbers [motor variables] is the direct sum of two fields isomorphic to the field of real numbers; this property permits explication of the theory of series and of functions of the hyperbolic complex variable through the use of properties of the field of real numbers. He then proceeds, for example, to generalize theorems due to Cauchy, Abel, Mertens, and Hardy to the domain of the motor variable. In the primary article, cited below, he considers D-holomorphic functions, and the satisfaction of d’Alembert's equation by their components. He calls a rectangle with sides parallel to the diagonals y = x and y = − x, an isotropic rectangle since its sides are on isotropic lines. He concludes his abstract with these words: :Isotropic rectangles play a fundamental role in this theory since they form the domains of existence for holomorphic functions, domains of convergence of power series, and domains of convergence of functional series. Vignaux completed his series with a six-page note on the approximation of D-holomorphic functions in a unit isotropic rectangle by Bernstein polynomials. While there are some typographical errors as well as a couple of technical stumbles in this series, Vignaux succeeded in laying out the main lines of the theory that lies between real and ordinary complex analysis. The text is especially impressive as an instructive document for students and teachers due to its exemplary development from elements. Furthermore, the entire excursion is rooted in \\"its relation to Émile Borel’s geometry\\" so as to underwrite its motivation. ==Bireal variable== In 1892 Corrado Segre recalled the tessarine algebra as bicomplex numbers.G. Baley Price (1991) An introduction to multicomplex spaces and functions, Marcel Dekker Naturally the subalgebra of real tessarines arose and came to be called the bireal numbers. In 1946 U. Bencivenga published an essayBencivenga, U. (1946) \\"Sulla Rappresentazione Geometrica Della Algebre Doppie Dotate Di Modulo\\", Atti. Accad. Sci. Napoli Ser(3) v.2 No 7 on the dual numbers and the split-complex numbers where he used the term bireal number. He also described some of the function theory of the bireal variable. The essay was studied at University of British Columbia in 1949 when Geoffrey Fox wrote his master's thesis \\"Elementary function theory of a hypercomplex variable and the theory of conformal mapping in the hyperbolic plane\\". On page 46 Fox reports \\"Bencivenga has shown that a function of a bireal variable maps the hyperbolic plane into itself in such a manner that, at those points for which the derivative of a function exists and does not vanish, hyperbolic angles are preserved in the mapping\\". G. Fox proceeds to provide the polar decomposition of a bireal variable and discusses hyperbolic orthogonality. Starting from a different definition he proves on page 57 :Theorem 3.42 : Two vectors are mutually orthogonal if and only if their unit vectors are mutually reflections of one another in one or another of the diagonal lines through 0. Fox focuses on \\"bilinear transformations\\" w = \\\\frac {\\\\alpha z + \\\\beta} {\\\\gamma z + \\\\delta} , where \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\gamma, \\\\delta are bireal constants. To cope with singularity he augments the plane with a single point at infinity (page 73). Among his novel contributions to function theory is the concept of an interlocked system. Fox shows that for a bireal k satisfying : (a − b)2 < < (a + b)2 the hyperbolas : = a2 and = b2 do not intersect (form an interlocked system). He then shows that this property is preserved by bilinear transformations of a bireal variable. ==Polynomial factorization== Two staples of introductory algebra include factorization of polynomials and the fundamental theorem of algebra. With the adoption of motor variables the traditional expectations are countered.Note that similar adjustments to traditional expectations are necessary for the idea of the square root of a matrix. The reason is that (D, +, × ) does not form a unique factorization domain. Substitute structures for the motor plane were provided by Poodiack and LeClair in 2009. They prove three versions of the fundamental theorem of algebra where a polynomial of degree n has n2 roots counting multiplicity. To provide an appropriate concept for multiplicity, they construct a matrix which contains all the roots of a polynomial. Furthermore, their method allows derivation of a similar theorem for polynomials with tessarine coefficients. The article in The College Mathematics Journal uses the term \\"perplex number\\" for a motor variable, and the term \\"hyperbolic number\\" for a tessarine. A basic example of the non-unique factorization is :(z - 1)(z + 1) = z^2 - 1 = (z - j)(z + j) exhibiting the set {1, −1, j, −j } of four roots to the second degree polynomial. Another example is :(z + 2)(z + 3) = z^2 + 5z +6 = (z + \\\\frac{5}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}j)(z + \\\\frac{5}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{2}j) In general, a quadratic polynomial with two real roots can be factored in two ways as follows: :a(z + \\\\frac{b - \\\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a})(z + \\\\frac{b + \\\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}) = az^2 + bz +c = a(z + \\\\frac{b}{2a} - \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}j)(z + \\\\frac{b}{2a} + \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}j) ==Compactification== The multiplicative inverse function is so important that extreme measures are taken to include it in the mappings of differential geometry. For instance, the complex plane is rolled up to the Riemann sphere for ordinary complex arithmetic. For split-complex arithmetic a hyperboloid is used instead of a sphere: H = \\\\\\\\{(x, y, z) : z^2 + x^2 - y^2 = 1 \\\\\\\\} . As with the Riemann sphere, the method is stereographic projection from P = (0, 0, 1) through t = (x, y, 0) to the hyperboloid. The line L = Pt is parametrized by s in L = \\\\\\\\{ (s x, s y, 1 - s) : s \\\\in R \\\\\\\\} so that it passes P when s is zero and t when s is one. From H ∩ L it follows that :(1 - s)^2 + (sx)^2 - (sy)^2 = 1 , \\\\text{ so that} \\\\quad s = \\\\frac {2}{1 + x^2 - y^2} . If t is on the null cone, then s = 2 and (2x, ±2x, – 1) is on H, the opposite points (2x, ±2x, 1) make up the light cone at infinity that is the image of the null cone under inversion. Note that for t with y^2 > 1 + x^2 , s is negative. The implication is that the back-ray through P to t provides the point on H. These points t are above and below the hyperbola conjugate to the unit hyperbola. The compactification must be completed in P3R with homogeneous coordinates (w, x, y, z) where w = 1 specifies the affine space (x, y, z) used so far. Hyperboloid H is absorbed into the projective conic \\\\\\\\{ (w, x, y, z) \\\\in P^3R : z^2 + x^2 = y^2 + w^2 \\\\\\\\}, which is a compact space. Walter Benz performed the compactification by using a mapping due to Hans Beck. Isaak Yaglom illustrated a two-step compactification as above, but with the split-complex plane tangent to the hyperboloid. In 2015 Emanuello & Nolder performed the compactification by first embedding the motor plane into a torus, and then making it projective by identifying antipodal points.John A. Emanuello & Craig A.

It is located north-west of the Sydney central business district on the northern bank of the Parramatta River. Its local government area is the City of Ryde. ==History== Evidence of the Walumedegal clan remains around Morrisons Bay and Glades Bay, with 4 distinct sites including shelters amongst the sandstone overhangs, open rock engraving site, sheltered stencil (art site) and an axe grinding site. The area of Putney and Ryde was originally known Eastern Farms and then as Kissing Point by the British colonists. It was one of the first areas of British settlement in the colony. One of the earliest settlers within the present day suburb was the brewer James Squire who settled there in 1792. He established his brewery the Malt Shovel near the present day Kissing Point. The eastern section of Putney was part of a land grant to Nicholas Bayley. The land was later sold to Eugene Delange who subdivided the land calling it the Village of Eugenie. The name was later changed to Putney, derived from its namesake Putney on the River Thames in London. Parramatta River had been known as the 'Thames of the Antipodes' and other nearby suburbs were also named after Thames localities of Greenwich, Woolwich and Henley. Putney was also the midpoint for watching World Championship rowing races from the 1880s to 1930s. The first regatta was held in 1847 at Kissing Point. The following decade, Sydneysiders were mad about rowing, and lucrative prizes were given to local and national championships. By the 1880s the river was a focus for thousands watching the world championship sculling races. The course ran between Kissing Point and Uhr's Point (south east side of Ryde Bridge). The local addiction to sculling fever was called \\"water on the brain\\". World Championships were contested on the course, results eagerly awaited in both Britain and America. Men and women alike discussed water conditions, racing times, and technicalities of boats. Most of the champions trained at Ryde. Local, national, and international races were held on the Parramatta River. Inter- varsity and GPS schools also had their annual regattas on the river between 1893–1935. Banjo Paterson recalled; \\"from twenty-five to thirty men could be seen on any fine morning swinging along in their sculls at practice – and such men! From riverside farms, and from axe men's camps in the North Coast timber country, from shipyards and fishing fleets, they flocked to the old river as the gladiators flocked to Rome in the last days of the Empire.\\"Ryde River Walk Masterplan at Ryde City Council left A punt service was established before 1896, crossing the river between Putney Point and Mortlake Point. This service was driven by hand. A cable ferry was opened in 1928, and was officially called the Mortlake Ferry. It is the last surviving punt in the Sydney metropolitan area.Parramatta River Walk, Department of Planning, New South Wales, 1989, p.19 In 1943, during World War II, Slazengers (Australia) Pty Ltd established a ship building yard on Pellisier Road, Putney. The company manufactured wartime equipment for the United States Army and the Australian Government. During the war, the Putney shipyard built scows and landing craft; however Slazengers also built military huts, houses for munition workers, military canteens, hospitals, small arms, ammunition boxes and gas masks. Ship contracts included trawlers, tugboats, landing craft, life boats, scows and high speed work boats. Morrisons Bay is named after Archibald Morrison, a soldier who received a land grant in 1795 of 55 acres. One of the colony's wealthiest settlers, Captain William Raven, owned 100 acres that ran between Glades Bay to Morrisons Bay. The land was subdivided in 1887. Named after Lord Alfred Tennyson, the Tennyson Estate was promoted as having front seat views to the Championship rowing course. Two world Champion rowers, Beach (1884) and Kemp (1887) have streets named after them. The Eastern side of Morrison's Bay was a textile mill, the Head of bay is a reclaimed mangrove flat and River baths were established 1918. ==Transport== Putney is served by State Transit route 507, which travels between the city and Macquarie University via Meadowbank. The Kissing Point ferry wharf, located in the suburb, provides access to the Parramatta River ferry services, with a 40-minute ferry service to Circular Quay. Meadowbank railway station is located beyond the suburb's northwestern boundary. ==Landmarks== Putney's facilities include a primary school, post office, sporting fields, parks, a shopping area and a few restaurants. Putney is also home to St Chad's Anglican Church, Delange Road, which was founded in 1912 and whose building is of historical significance. It is named after St Chad of Mercia, who lived in the 7th century and was abbot of several monasteries, as well as a bishop. Cleves Park is the possible burial site of Bennelong and contains a memorial plaque.

The name of the strip is a portmanteau created from the pair's surnames. The name was also given to a comedy TV series, broadcast on the Danish channel DR2 in 2005. The strip changed its name to 'WUMO' in June 2012. == Publication history == WUMO debuted in 2001 as a comic strip competition entry named Kalzone, completed a few hours before the entry deadline. Submitted under the pseudonym \\"Pernille Richter Andersson\\", the strip won the competition, and a one-month run in the national newspaper Politiken. The strip became a regular feature on DR's internet culture portal in 2002, and in October 2003 it became a regular daily newspaper strip in Politiken. As of June 2012, WUMO is printed daily in Politiken (Denmark), Aftonbladet (Sweden), Dagbladet (Norway), Die Welt (Germany), Helsingin Sanomat (Finland) and online-only in De Telegraaf (Netherlands) – and on its own website, wumo.com. In November 2013, WUMO began appearing in newspapers across the United States, including The Washington Post and the New York Daily News, replacing the comic strip Get Fuzzy. == Style and content == The comic has a very distinct style, featuring shaky line drawings and coloring that appears to be computer-generated. Most installments are delivered in a single panel, avoiding the more traditional format of boxed divisions to signify progress or movement in time. Recurring characters in WUMO tend to be more of a running gag than a legitimate continuing narrative. For a period, humans portrayed in the comic wore no clothes. According to the comic's website, Morgenthaler \\"was fed up with the tiresome meticulousness of drawing clothes on people so he just stopped doing it.\\" Sometimes, when the situation called for a specific outfit to denote a specific role, humans would appear clothed. Lately characters have all started to appear fully clothed, and older comics have been edited to add clothes. Content ranges from sideways social satire to complete non-sequitur, and relies on both intelligent humor and simple slapstick. Reading WUMO is often an exercise of the imagination, as it has a habit of juxtaposing supremely ordinary characters in supremely unusual situations, or vice versa. \\"Punchlines\\" are delivered by way of dialogue or with one-liners written in a caption below the image. Because the comic is drawn in a non-serial format, delivery and timing are especially important (and difficult to maneuver), and as a result most of the humor in WUMO relies on the quality of the writing itself rather than the element of surprise that usually lends itself to the traditional comic-strip punchline. == Plagiarism == The strip was for a period the focus of a debate concerning plagiarism, as the strip's followers voiced their concern over an advertising campaign by the Danish office of advertising agency DDB promoting the Volkswagen Golf GT, having appropriated its joke from a Wulffmorgenthaler strip. In a reversed issue, Wulffmorgenthaler was accused of plagiarising a photograph that had circulated on internet, to which Anders Morgenthaler conceded that the duo had been inspired by the image and based a strip on it in the belief that it was a privately forwarded photograph. == Television series == WUMO was also broadcast as a television series, in the style of a parodied show for children in Denmark, in which Wulff, Morgenthaler and their puppet friends Dolph, a fascist hippo and Margit, a politically correct female squirrel, introduce various short films. The only recurring character from the comic is the Toucan Kid. New characters include Ansgar and Loke, a very sexually active archeologist and his colleague who is deadly afraid of \\"the Vagina\\", the contestants on a fifties game show. Another recurring feature on the show was a \\"Reality show\\" starring a hapless school photographer, Bent, and his retarded assistant Bubber, the brothers Lefevre, who are carpet salesmen trying to be actors, Asger Lesniak who has a personal vendetta against a guy who frequents the places he works, and Bimmer, a character obsessed with life in the tropic nether regions. The TV-series evolved in the second season into Dolph og Wulff, in a documentary style, with The Fascist Hippo Dolph as the dominating main character. The second season further evolved to a third season, this time in the style of a late night talk show, on 17 March called Dolph og Wulff – med venner (Dolph and Wulff – with friends). The friends are a sex-crazed, English-speaking beaver named Rocco and an orangutan called \\"Finn\\". Rocco was actually created as a sex-crazed squirrel for the first season, but it was ultimately decided to not use him, so the Rocco puppet was used as Margit instead. In 2011, Wulff & Morgenthaler created a TV show – the animated sitcom, 'The Pandas' (Pandaerne), which ran for 3 seasons. A Canadian-American remake of The Pandas was announced to be in production from Corus Entertainment and Bento Box Entertainment. The series was planned to air in 2016, but has since been postponed. == Notes == == External links == * Wulffmorgenthaler official English site * Wulffmorgenthaler on VKontakte * Wulffmorgenthaler on MTV * 1st season 2nd season 3rd season (Dolph og Wullf med venner) of Wulffmorgenthaler TV show Category:2001 comics debuts Category:Webcomics Category:Danish comic strips Category:Satirical comics Category:Danish webcomics ","title":"Wumo"},{"id":"2580848","text":"Prestons is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 37 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Liverpool. ==History== Prestons was named after a local Irish family who in the 1910s ran a small post office on the corner of Romana Square (which has since been removed in the urbanization stages of Preston's development).

In 2011, Wolseley Road was ranked as the ninth-most expensive street in the world, at $38,900 per square metre. ==Location== The suburb of Point Piper sits on Sydney Harbour, beside the suburbs of Rose Bay, Bellevue Hill and Double Bay. The streets in Point Piper are: Buckhurst Avenue, Longworth Avenue, New South Head Road, Redvers Street, Saint Mervyn's Avenue, Wolseley Road, Wolseley Crescent, Wingadal Place, Wentworth Place, Wentworth Street, Wunulla Road, and Wyuna Road.Gregory's Sydney Street Directory, Gregory's Publishing Company, 2007 ==History== Point Piper House (also called Henrietta Villa) 1840s Point Piper was named after Captain John Piper (1773–1851). Piper was a Scottish- born military officer of Cornish parentage, who arrived in the colony in 1792 and built a neo-Palladian mansion on the point, on of land granted by the governor in 1816. After a review of Piper's performance as head of the Customs Department showed that he had mismanaged funds (although he was not actually accused of being corrupt), Piper attempted to drown himself in Sydney Harbour. He subsequently sold his holdings at Point Piper, Rose Bay, Neutral Bay, and Petersham for £5,000 and moved to the country. In 1834, Piper's former residence was leased by Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787-1873), the newly arrived Collector of Customs for New South Wales and a Crown appointee to the colony's Legislative Council. Colonel Gibbes and his family resided at Point Piper House (also known as \\"Henrietta Villa\\" or \\"Naval Villa\\") until 1844, when they moved to Wotonga, on Kirribilli Point.

It is stationed at Langley Air Force Base, Va. where it is a tenant unit, being supported by the 633d Air Base Wing. Its 1st Operations Group (1 OG) is a successor organization of the 1st Fighter Group, one of the 15 original combat air groups formed by the Army before World War II. The 1 OG is the oldest major air combat unit in the United States Air Force, its origins formed on 5 May 1918. The wing was initially part of Tactical Air Command being formed at March Field, California in 1947 and was one of the first wings to be equipped with the North American F-86 Sabre in February 1949. Briefly a part of Strategic Air Command in 1949, it was reassigned to Air Defense Command in 1950 and provided air defense of the Upper Midwest of the United States until being reassigned to Tactical Air Command in 1970. The 1 FW was the first operational wing equipped with the F-15A/B Eagle in 1976; and in 2005, was the first operational wing equipped with the Lockheed Martin F-22A Raptor air superiority fighter. ==History== : For additional lineage and history, see 1st Fighter Group ===Origins=== 71st Fighter Squadron Lockheed P-80s at March AFB, CA, c. 1948. The 1st Fighter Wing was activated at March Field California on 15 August 1947. It was assigned to Twelfth Air Force, Tactical Air Command (TAC). In December 1948 Twelfth Air Force was assigned from Tactical Air Command to Continental Air Command (ConAC), established on 1 December 1948. ConAC assumed jurisdiction over both TAC and the Air Defense Command (ADC). This move reflected an effort to concentrate all fighter forces deployed within the continental United States to strengthen the air defense of the North American continent. The move was largely an administrative convenience: the units assigned to ConAC were dual-trained and expected to revert to their primary strategic or tactical roles after the air defense battle was won. The 1st Fighter Wing was subsequently transferred from Twelfth Air Force/TAC to Fourth Air Force/ConAC on 20 December 1948. Organizational and equipment changes continued throughout 1949. The first F-86 Sabre, assigned to the 94th Fighter Squadron, arrived on 15 February. By the end of June the wing had received seventy-nine of its eighty-three authorized F-86s. On 1 May the wing transferred from ConAC to Strategic Air Command (SAC) and the Fifteenth Air Force. The wing was subsequently attached to the 22d Bombardment Wing on 1 July.O'Connell, Charles F. (1987), First Fighter, A History of America's First Team, 1918–1983. Office of TAC History, Headquarters, Tactical Air Command, Langley AFB, Virginia. At March, the wing trained in large formation flying and competed to establish various formation records. The 71st Fighter Squadron struck first in September 1949, when it launched a twelve and later an eighteen-aircraft formation. The 27th and the 94th countered on 21 October. On that day the 94th launched three thirteen-plane formations, but the 27th topped this with two twenty-one plane formations, The purpose of this exercise became clear in early January 1950, when the wing deployed a sizable contingent of aircraft to participate in the filming of the RKO film Jet Pilot. The group claimed a final formation record on 4 January when it passed a twenty-four plane formation (consisting of eight aircraft from each squadron) before the cameras. The group formed its own aerial demonstration team in January 1950. The team, dubbed the \\"Sabre Dancers\\", was composed of five members of the 27th Fighter Squadron. The Sabre Dancers made what was probably their most widely viewed flight on 22 April 1950, when they performed before an Armed Forces Day audience at Eglin AFB, Florida, that included President Harry S. Truman, most of his Cabinet, and numerous other political leaders. ===Air Defense Command=== ====Korean War era==== 94th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-86DAircraft is North American F-86D-60-NA Sabre serial 53–892. Taken near Selfridge Air Force Base, Michigan in 1955 Effective 16 April 1950 the 1st Fighter Wing was redesignated the 1st Fighter-Interceptor Wing, the same designation that was simultaneously applied to the group and its three squadrons. The wing had, some days previously, been relieved from its attachment to the 22d Bombardment Wing. The organizational changes the wing had experienced since 1947 paled in comparison to the multitude of changes the unit underwent during the last six months of 1950. As of 30 June 1950, the 1st Fighter-Interceptor Group was assigned to the 1st Fighter-Interceptor Wing, which was itself assigned to Fifteenth Air Force and SAC. On 1 July the wing was relieved from assignment to Fifteenth Air Force and SAC and assigned to the Fourth Air Force and ConAC. Two days later the wing issued orders establishing advanced parties of its headquarters and component organizations at Victorville (later George) AFB, California. On 22 July an advanced party of personnel from Headquarters, 1st Fighter-Interceptor Group and the 27th and 71st Fighter-Interceptor Squadrons departed for Griffiss AFB, New York. A letter directing the wing to send the group headquarters and the 27th and the 71st to Griffiss for attachment to the Eastern Air Defense Force (EADF), ConAC, arrived on 30 July. Headquarters, 1st Fighter-Interceptor Wing and the 94th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron were assigned to the Western Air Defense Force, ConAC, on 1 August, while the group headquarters and the 27th and 71st were attached to the EADF on 15 August. The wing was attached to the 27th Air Division, WADF, on 20 September. Finally, one month later, the 71st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron moved from Griffiss AFB to Pittsburgh International Airport, Pennsylvania. As of 31 December 1950 Headquarters, 1st Fighter-Interceptor Wing and the 94th were stationed at George AFB, assigned to the WADF, and attached to the 27th Air Division. Headquarters, 1st Fighter-Interceptor Group, while still assigned to the wing, was stationed at Griffiss AFB with the 27th. The 71st was at Pittsburgh. The units on the East Coast were attached to the EADF. Air Defense Command was reestablished as a major command on 1 January 1951, and the wing was assigned to ADC. In May, the 27th and the 71st were attached to the Connecticut Air National Guard 103d Fighter Interceptor Group, which provided administrative and logistical support and operational control, although the squadrons remained assigned to the 1st Fighter Group. Headquarters, 1st Fighter Group was relieved from attachment to the Eastern Air Defense Force and moved from Griffiss back to George without personnel or equipment. Meanwhile, at George AFB, the New Mexico Air National Guard 188th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was attached to the 1st Fighter-Interceptor Wing, which provided administrative support and operational control. All of these constant moves and reassignments as well as the fact that the wing headquarters stationed in California could provide only limited control and virtually no support to a group headquarters and squadrons deployed on the East Coast. While the policy of attaching units to higher headquarters established an ad hoc means of supplying the needed support, it was a cumbersome procedure that blurred organizational lines and did nothing for morale or unit cohesion above the squadron level. With the exception of the Headquarters and Headquarters Squadron, and the three fighter-interceptor squadrons, all 1st Fighter-Interceptor Wing organizations and the group headquarters were reduced to a strength of one officer and one enlisted man on 30 November 1951, at which time the wing moved from George Air Force Base, California, to Norton Air Force Base, California. The squadrons were reassigned to newly organized \\"defense wings\\": the 27th to the 4711th Air Defense Wing (ADW), Eastern Air Defense Force, the 71st to the 4708th Air Defense Wing, EADF, and the 94th to the 4705th Defense Wing, WADF. Headquarters, Air Defense Command inactivated the 1st Fighter-Interceptor Wing on 6 February 1952. ====Selfridge AFB==== Squadron personnel of the 71st Fighter-Interceptor SquadronTaken about 1964. F-106 serial 58–773 is in the background. 94th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-106Aircraft is F-106A serial 58-0786. Taken near Selfridge AFB Michigan in 1965 The organizational instability of the early 1950s was rooted in the demands of the Korean War. With the end of the war in Korea the Air Defense Command found itself in a position to return to a more traditional command structure. The 1st Fighter- Interceptor Wing was redesignated the 1st Fighter Wing (Air Defense) on 14 September 1956 and activated on 18 October 1956 at Selfridge AFB, Michigan. It was assigned to the Eastern Air Defense Force. After enduring a six-year period of frequent organizational changes, the wing began a period of stability. For approximately the next thirteen years it remained at Selfridge. Both the 71st and the 94th FIS traded their F-86s for F-102 Delta Dagger interceptors between 1958 and 1960. While the wing and its units operated from Selfridge AFB the 27th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron remained on the east coast. As of 31 December 1961 it was stationed at Dow AFB, Maine, and assigned to the Bangor Air Defense Sector, 26th Air Division. At that time the squadron was equipped with F-106 Delta Darts, and was not part of the 1st Fighter Wing. In October 1962 the wing responded to the Cuban Missile Crisis by deploying aircraft, support personnel, equipment and supplies to Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, and Volk Field, Wisconsin. From 19 October through 27 November wing aircraft flew 620 sorties and 1,274 hours, most from Patrick AFB, while maintaining a mission-ready rate of approximately eighty percent. Wing life reverted to more normal training routines at year's end, and the pattern continued through 1963 and 1964. On 15 March 1963 two Soviet bombers overflew Alaska and Alaskan Air Command F-102s were unable to intercept them.McMullen, Richard F. (1964) \\"The Fighter Interceptor Force 1962–1964\\" ADC Historical Study No. 27, Air Defense Command, Ent Air Force Base, CO (Confidential, declassified 22 March 2000), p. 27 The response to this intrusion was to deploy ten F-106s from the 325th Fighter Wing to Alaska in what was called Operation White Shoes.McMullen, pp. 28–29 While the 325th wing upgraded its F-106s, the 1st Fighter Wing relieved it from March to June 1964. While deployed in Alaska, two of the wing's F-106s were damaged in the Good Friday earthquake.McMullen, pp. 32–34 Beginning in about 1965 the wing began to transfer pilots to other units in or en route to South Vietnam. While the wing itself did not participate in the Vietnam War, its units were soon manned by personnel who had completed tours in Southeast Asia, with the 1st serving as a transition unit for many pilots en route to or returning from Southeast Asia. Organizational changes continued to whittle away at the wing's strength in 1966 and 1967. The wing was assigned to the 34th Air Division, First Air Force, on 1 April 1966. This organization changed again on 16 January 1967, when the 71st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which had won top prize in the F-106 category at the 1965 William Tell weapons competition at Tyndall AFB, Florida, was transferred to the 328th Fighter Wing (Air Defense), Tenth Air Force, at Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base, Missouri. This reorganization left the 1st Fighter Wing with only one fighter squadron, the 94th. However, the reduced wing stayed busy. From 24 July through 4 August 1967 Selfridge became the hub of federal activities mobilized during the 1967 Detroit riots. Elements of the 3d Brigade, 82d Airborne Division and the 2d Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, a total of some 12,000 combat and support personnel, eventually passed through the base. From 1500 on 24 July to 1500 the next day, the base received 4,700 troops and 1,008 tons of cargo. On 1 August the base handled 363 C-130 Hercules sorties, 6,036 troops, and 2,492 tons of cargo. By the time the tactical command post at Selfridge was closed at 1130 on 4 August, the base had processed 1,389 C-130 sorties, 12,058 troops, and 4,735 tons of cargo. In September 1968 the detached 71st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was relieved from assignment to the 328th Fighter Wing, and transferred to the 28th Air Division, Tenth Air Force, at Malmstrom AFB, Montana, where it became a self-contained unit operating on the SAC base. Between 20 May and 5 November 1969, the 94th FIS deployed to Osan Air Base, Korea, for exercise College Cadence. It was to be the 1st Fighter Wing's last major air defense effort. On 1 December 1969 the 94th was transferred to Wurtsmith AFB, Michigan, pending the inactivation of the 1st Fighter Wing, which was assigned to the 23d Air Division on that date. On 31 December 1969 the wing, with no units under its control, transferred to Hamilton AFB, California, and was assigned to the 26th Air Division. The wing's personnel and equipment were transferred to the 4708th Air Base Group, 23d Air Division, at Duluth International Airport, Minnesota, on 1 January 1970. ===Tactical Air Command=== On 1 August 1968, General William W. Momyer became commander of Tactical Air Command. While he devoted most of his attention to the pressing problems the command faced during the war in Vietnam, General Momyer also concerned himself with the designation of the units under his command. The movement of units to and from Vietnam left TAC with a mixed force. Some of its organizations had long and honorable tactical traditions. Others used a provisional, four-digit, command-controlled designations that gave them no history or traditions. General Momyer therefore directed the TAC planning staff to replace the provisional four-digit designations with those of units that had a combat record dating from either World War 11 or Korea. He also directed the staff to \\"retain illustrious AFCON designators for the active tactical forces.\\" This policy, plus the training demands caused by the war in Vietnam, led to the 1st Fighter Wing's return to Tactical Air Command in October 1970. ====MacDill AFB==== 94th Tactical Fighter Squadron McDonnell F-4ETaken ar MacDill AFB in August 1972. Aircraft in foreground is McDonnell F-4E-31-MC Phantom II, serial 66–295. 4530 CCTS B-57GAircraft is Martin B-57G-MA, serial 53-3877. Headquarters, United States Air Force authorized the reassignment of the 1st Fighter Wing (Air Defense) from Aerospace Defense Command to Tactical Air Command on 30 July 1970. Three days later, HQ ADC directed the commander of the 26th Air Division to move Headquarters, 1st Fighter Wing (Air Defense) from Hamilton AFB, California, to MacDill AFB, Florida. All units moved without personnel or equipment. The personnel and equipment formerly of the 15th Tactical Fighter wing were reassigned to the 1st TFW. The squadrons of the 15 TFW were assigned to the historic wing: the 45th, 46th, and 47th Tactical Fighter Squadrons. Another organizational change effective 1 July 1971 transferred the wing from the 836th Air Division, inactivated on that date, to Ninth Air Force. Completing the Wing's historic preservation, the commanders of the three squadrons participated in a shoot- out at the Avon Park Air Force Range to determine which squadrons would receive the designations of the 27th, 71st, and 94th. The commander of the 47 TFS marked the highest score, and chose the 94 TFS; the 46 TFS placed second, choosing the 27 TFS, leaving the 45 TFS with the squadron having the shortest history, the 71 TFS. The wing spent the next four years providing advanced tactical training to F-4 Phantom II and B-57 Canberra aircrews, most of whom later saw service in the Vietnam War. On 1 October 1971, HQ TAC inactivated the 4530th Tactical Training Squadron, which, in addition to other duties, had trained Australian F-4 aircrew members and maintenance personnel during project Peace Reef. The 4501st Tactical Fighter Replacement Squadron, equipped with F-4s, assumed the 4530th's place in the wing's structure on the same date. The command inactivated the 4424th Combat Crew Training Squadron, the wing's B-57 training unit, on 30 June 1972, leaving the wing with four flying squadrons. All conducted advanced F-4 tactical training. On 14 March 1974, the Air Force publicly announced plans to station the Air Force's first operational F-15 wing at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. Langley was chosen due to its heritage and ideal location for TAC's secondary air defense mission. After studying the heritage of its wings, TAC selected the 1st Fighter Wing as the unit to receive the first Eagle. On 6 June 1975, Tactical Air Command directed Ninth Air Force to move the 1st Fighter Wing from MacDill to Langley AFB. Although the designation of the unit moved, the majority of MacDill personnel remained in place, and served under the newly designated 56th Tactical Fighter Wing which continued to conduct F-4 training. ====Langley AFB==== First F-15A arrives at Langley AFB, January 1976 1st Tactical Fighter Wing personnel spent six months preparing for the arrival of the F-15. By the end of 1975, the Wing was ready for its new air superiority weapon, and on 18 December 1975, Lt Col John Britt, Operations Officer, flew the Wing's first F-15 (a two-seat trainer) into Langley. Official welcoming ceremonies were held on 9 January 1976, when Lt Col Richard L. Craft, 27th Fighter Squadron Commander, landed with the Wing's first single seat F-15. In recognition of its accomplishment of introducing the F-15 into the Air Force's operational inventory, the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing received its first Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, for the period 1 July 1975 – 31 October 1976. After achieving operational ready status, the Wing took the experience they had earned and utilized it on a program nicknamed \\"Ready Eagle.\\" The 1st helped prepare the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing at Bitburg Air Base, Germany, for their reception of the F-15. The 1st assisted in the training of maintenance personnel and pilots. By 23 September 1977, the wing provided Bitburg with 88 operationally ready pilots, 522 maintenance specialists, and later trained an additional 1,100 maintenance personnel at Bitburg. On 15 April 1977, the 1 TFW acquired a new mission. The wing assumed responsibility for the 6th Airborne Command and Control Squadron's EC-135 aircraft and crews, previously assigned to the 4500th Air Base Wing at Langley. The 6 ACCS flew EC-135 airborne command posts in support of U.S. Commander in Chief, Atlantic Command (USCINCLANT) with deployments throughout the Atlantic region until early 1992. 1st Fighter Wing participation in worldwide deployments and training exercises continued through the 1980s. The Wing served in countries throughout Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Central America. The final F-15s left the 1st Fighter Wing on 3 September 2010, after operating the weapon system for nearly 35 years. ====Southwest Asia operations==== 1st TFW F-15 Eagle on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force. The training and experience gained was called upon in the summer of 1990, when Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait. On 7 August 1990, the 27th and 71st Tactical Fighter Squadrons began deploying to Saudi Arabia as the first American combat units on the ground in Saudi Arabia, in support of the defense of the Arabian peninsula from further Iraqi aggression—an operation dubbed Operation Desert Shield. In all, the 1 TFW deployed 48 aircraft to the Persian Gulf. By 16 January 1991, when Desert Shield came to a close, the Wing amassed 4,207 sorties patrolling the Kuwait and Iraq border areas. At 0115 local Saudi Arabia time, on 17 January 1991, sixteen 1st Tactical Fighter Wing F-15s departed King Abdul-Aziz Air Base and flew toward Iraq to participate in Operation Desert Storm, the liberation of Kuwait from the Iraqis. During the first night of the operation, Captain Steven W. Tate of the 71st Tactical Fighter Squadron, shot down an Iraqi Mirage F-1, which turned out to be the wing's only kill during the war. It was also the first combat credit awarded to the wing under command of the U.S. Air Force. Upon its return on 8 March 1991, the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing had amassed a total of 2,564 sorties during Operation Desert Storm. The end of the First Gulf War did not bring an end to the Wing's support in Southwest Asia. Monitoring the southern no-fly zone, the 1st provided six-month coverage every year under Operation Southern Watch and Operation Northern Watch. In October 1994, when Saddam Hussein again placed forces near the Kuwaiti border, the Wing participated in a short-notice deployment, Operation Vigilant Warrior. Operation Vigilant Warrior demonstrated the need for an Air Force capability of providing combat air power globally at short notice. This requirement resulted in the concept of the Air Expeditionary Force (AEF.) During AEF II, the 1st Fighter Wing deployed 12 F-15s and over 600 personnel to Shaheed Mwaffaq Air Base, Jordan, from 12 April – 28 June 1996. Wing members built and operated from the bare base, and provided support to Operation Southern Watch, supporting UN sanctions and enforcing the no-fly zones in Iraq. On 25 June 1996, a fuel truck loaded with explosives detonated outside the Khobar Towers Housing area, in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The bomb killed 19 Air Force members, including five airmen of the 71st Rescue Squadron, and consequently the 1st Fighter Wing relocated its Southwest Asia operations from Dhahran to Prince Sultan Air Base, Al Kharj. ===From 1991=== 27th Fighter Squadron F-15C firing an AIM-7M Sparrow missile. On 1 October 1991, the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing was redesignated 1st Fighter Wing; the 1st Fighter Group was redesignated as the 1st Operations Group and reactivated as part of the wing. The 1st Fighter Wing assumed responsibility of three additional missions—air control, airlift, and search and rescue: :—On 15 March 1992, the 74th Air Control Squadron was transferred to the 1st Fighter Wing. The 74th provided command and control of air operations for worldwide operations. :—On 1 February 1993, the 41st and 71st Rescue Squadrons, and the 741st Maintenance Squadron were assigned to the 1st Fighter Wing. Stationed at Patrick AFB, Fla., the units provided search and rescue for NASA's space shuttle missions, and support of combat search and rescue operations in Southwest Asia. Additionally, :—On 1 April 1993 C-21 operational support aircraft were assigned to the Wing with the establishment of Detachment 1, 1 OG. On 1 May, the detachment inactivated and the 12th Airlift Flight, with the same mission, activated. The 1st Rescue Group was activated as part of the 1st Fighter Wing on 14 June 1995, to provide operational control of the Search and Rescue mission. Two realignments ordered by Air Combat Command took effect on the same day, 1 April 1997. The most substantial one had been the 1st Rescue Group's reassignment to the 347th Wing at Moody Air Force Base. This move meant the loss of two types of aircraft, the HC-130P \\"Hercules\\" gunship, and the HH-60G \\"Pave Hawk\\" helicopter. When the Air Force decided to transfer 12th Airlift Flight to Air Mobility Command, another type of aircraft, the C-21, was removed from the 1st Fighter Wing's possession exactly four years after it had been assigned. What made the wing's valued participation in this contingency unique is the fact it sent no aircraft in support of it, exemplifying the diversity of the 1st Fighter Wing's comprehensive mission. More than 150 personnel from 11 units within the 1st Fighter Wing deployed to the European theater in direct support of Operation Allied Force and associated operations such as Noble Anvil and Shining Hope. Responsible for the worldwide mobility commitment to execute command and control operations, the 74th Air Control Squadron provided the largest contingent of 1st Fighter Wing personnel and equipment to Operation Noble Anvil. The 74th ACS set up their equipment outside Budapest, Hungary, to provide joint forces and theater commanders with an accurate air picture for conducting offensive and defensive missions. During Operation Allied Force, the 74th Air Control Squadron deployed to provide critical air control in the European Theater of Operations. ====After September 11 terrorist attacks==== F-22A of the 27th Fighter SquadronTaken at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, 2005. The 27th was the first squadron to receive the F-22A. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the 1st Fighter Wing took to the skies to simultaneously defend the east and west coasts of the US against further terrorist attacks. The wing's F-15s were among the first fighters on scene over Washington D.C. and remained on station continuously for the next six months. The 1st Fighter Wing simultaneously participated in the US homeland defense mission in Operation Noble Eagle; maintained its lead wing status in the USAF's Air Expeditionary Force rotations to Southwest Asia and Turkey, enforcing no-fly zones in Operation Southern Watch/Operation Northern Watch until 2003; and deployed fighters to Keflavík, Iceland to fulfill NATO treaty obligations. During the first stages of the Iraq War in 2003, the 71st Fighter Squadron deployed again to Southwest Asia. In 2005, the 27th and 94th Fighter Squadrons became the first squadrons in the world to achieve operational status flying the F-22 Raptor. ====Joint basing==== The 1st Fighter Wing served as the host unit of Langley AFB from 1975 until 7 January 2010. The wing relinquished two of its four groups to the newly reactivated 633d Air Base Wing, which assumed host duties for Langley AFB. The change of command also was a pivotal step in the realignment consolidation of Langley AFB and Fort Eustis into Joint Base Langley-Eustis, which stood up in January 2010. ==Lineage, assignments== * Designated as: 1st Fighter Wing on 28 July 1947 : Organized on: 15 August 1947The 1st Fighter Wing (an experimental Table of Distribution wing) was discontinued on 24 August 1948, it was replaced by the 1st Fighter Wing (a permanent Table of Organization wing) that was constituted on 15 June 1948 and activated on 22 August 1948.

The liquefaction of gases is a complicated process that uses various compressions and expansions to achieve high pressures and very low temperatures, using, for example, turboexpanders. ==Uses== Liquefaction processes are used for scientific, industrial and commercial purposes. Many gases can be put into a liquid state at normal atmospheric pressure by simple cooling; a few, such as carbon dioxide, require pressurization as well. Liquefaction is used for analyzing the fundamental properties of gas molecules (intermolecular forces), or for the storage of gases, for example: LPG, and in refrigeration and air conditioning. There the gas is liquefied in the condenser, where the heat of vaporization is released, and evaporated in the evaporator, where the heat of vaporization is absorbed. Ammonia was the first such refrigerant, and is still in widespread use in industrial refrigeration, but it has largely been replaced by compounds derived from petroleum and halogens in residential and commercial applications. Liquid oxygen is provided to hospitals for conversion to gas for patients with breathing problems, and liquid nitrogen is used in the medical field for cryosurgery, by inseminators to freeze semen, and by field and lab scientists to preserve samples. Liquefied chlorine is transported for eventual solution in water, after which it is used for water purification, sanitation of industrial waste, sewage and swimming pools, bleaching of pulp and textiles and manufacture of carbon tetrachloride, glycol and numerous other organic compounds as well as phosgene gas. Liquefaction of helium (4He) with the precooled Hampson–Linde cycle led to a Nobel Prize for Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in 1913. At ambient pressure the boiling point of liquefied helium is . Below 2.17 K liquid 4He becomes a superfluid (Nobel Prize 1978, Pyotr Kapitsa) and shows characteristic properties such as heat conduction through second sound, zero viscosity and the fountain effect among others. The liquefaction of air is used to obtain nitrogen, oxygen, and argon and other atmospheric noble gases by separating the air components by fractional distillation in a cryogenic air separation unit. ==History== ==Liquid air== ===Linde's process=== Air is liquefied by the Linde process, in which air is alternately compressed, cooled, and expanded, each expansion results in a considerable reduction in temperature. With the lower temperature the molecules move more slowly and occupy less space, so the air changes phase to become liquid. ===Claude's process=== Air can also be liquefied by Claude's process in which the gas is allowed to expand isentropically twice in two chambers. While expanding, the gas has to do work as it is led through an expansion turbine. The gas is not yet liquid, since that would destroy the turbine. Commercial air liquefication plants bypass this problem by expanding the air at supercritical pressures. Final liquefaction takes place by isenthalpic expansion in a thermal expansion valve. ==See also== * Air Liquide * Air Products & Chemicals * Air separation * The BOC Group * Chemical engineer * Compressibility factor * Fischer–Tropsch process * Gas separation * Gas to liquids * Hampson–Linde cycle * Industrial gases * The Linde Group * Liquefaction * Liquefaction point * Louis Paul Cailletet * Praxair * Siemens cycle * Turboexpander ==References== == External links == *Liquefaction of Gases *History of Liquefying Hydrogen - NASA Category:Phases of matter Category:Industrial processes Category:Gas technologies Category:Industrial gases it:Condensazione ","title":"Liquefaction of gases"},{"id":"2580901","text":"Picnic Point, a suburb of local government area City of Canterbury-Bankstown, is 23 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the state of New South Wales, Australia.

Its postcode is 2036. ==Description== Phillip Bay is one of the smallest suburbs in Randwick Municipality, in spite of including Yarra Bay and Bicentennial Park. It is a low-density residential area with a large variety of housing types, including villas, cottages, blocks of flats up to three storeys and townhouses. It has an extremely high percentage of detached homes: 80%, compared to the average of 28% in the Randwick Municipality. Semidetached homes are relatively few as a percentage of total housing: 6.4% compared to an average of 15% in the municipality.Randwick Municipality Website Catholic and Baptist churches can be found in Yarra Road and an Aboriginal Evangelical Church in Adina Avenue, although it was disused as of 2009. La Perouse Primary School is situated in Yarra Road, Phillip Bay. Beach and recreational areas are situated along Yarra Bay. Yarra Bay House is located on Yarra Point, between Frenchmans Bay and Yarra Bay. ==History== ===Aborigines=== Aboriginal people were the first to live at Phillip Bay and La Perouse. Their presence was recorded by Arthur Phillip and the French expedition led by Lapérouse who arrived within six days of each other in January 1788. A camp was established at Phillip Bay in 1883, under the Aborigines Protection Board. The settlement has been run by a variety of church and welfare groups over time. The reserve was moved back from the unstable sand to around the Elaroo Avenue area, at the end of the 1920s. The area is now owned by Aboriginal people, as is Yarra Bay House and the headland between Frenchmans Bay and Yarra Bay. ===Europeans=== The First Fleet ship HMS Supply carrying Captain Arthur Phillip arrived in Botany Bay on 18 January 1788. The anchorage was named \\"Phillip Bay\\". Examination of the immediate vicinity by Phillip concluded the area 'unsuitable for habitation'.Phillip's First Three Days After the arrival of Captain John Hunter in HMS Sirius on the 20th of January, Phillip, Hunter and two other men explored the coast northwards by boat, eventually finding Port Jackson. The fleet was then relocated to what became Sydney Cove. The adjacent suburb La Perouse was named after Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse who arrived at Botany Bay on 26 January 1788 just as the First Fleet was being relocated. \\"Phillip Bay\\" was eventually renamed \\"Yarra Bay\\" based on its Aboriginal name while the suburb has retained the original European name. The area around La Perouse developed as many seaside suburbs did through outdoor pastimes and weekend visitors, especially after the tram line was built in around 1900. Many unemployed people built makeshift homes in the Phillip Bay area during the Great Depression of the 1920s and 1930s. \\"Happy Valley\\" and \\"Hill 60\\" were to the north and mostly housed white people, while Aboriginal people mostly lived in the \\"Frog Hollow\\" area to the south.Randwick Municipality Website ===Yarra Bay House=== Yarra Bay House was built in 1903 as an addition to the Cable Station at La Perouse. When a second cable was laid in 1890, extra room was needed to house the workers. When the Cable Station became obsolete after 1917, the house was home to various government departments including the Director of Public Instruction (later the Education Department) and the Department of Youth and Community Services. In 1985, the title was given to the Aboriginal Land Council. A freshwater billabong has been constructed at the Back of Yarra Bay House to encourage the return of local frogs and birdlife. Restoration of the building was being carried out as of 2009. ==Population== In the 2016 Census, there were 704 people in Phillip Bay. 70.7% of people were born in Australia and 75.7% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion in Phillip Bay were Catholic 37.3%, No Religion 21.0% and Anglican 15.4%. ==Landmarks== * Yarra Bay House, Yarra Bay Sailing ClubYarra Bay Sailing Clubs Website * Yarra Bay, Yarra Point, Bumborah Point, Bicentennial Park. ==Gallery== Image:PhillipsBay2.JPGCatholic Church, known as The Reconciliation Church, Yarra Road Image:PhillipsBay3.JPGLighthouse Baptist Church, Yarra Road Image:PhillipsBay6.JPGColebrook Memorial Aboriginal Evangelical Church, Adina Avenue Image:PhillipsBay5.JPGMemorial to HMS Supply anchoring in Yarra Bay in 1788, Bicentennial Park Image:Yarra_Bay_House_2.JPGYarra Bay House Image:Yarra_Bay_House_1.JPGYarra Bay House Image:PhillipsBay1.JPGHome in Tudor Revival style, Yarra Road Image:PhillipsBay4.JPGHome combining Federation Bungalow and California Bungalow styles, Yarra Road ==References== Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:Botany Bay ","title":"Phillip Bay, New South Wales"},{"id":"2580911","text":"Now! is an album by jazz vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson, released on the Blue Note label.

It was Australia's first attempt to spin and weave cotton from cotton farms that the company owned in Queensland. Lancashire was the centre of England's cotton industry, and Pendle Hill is a hill in the heart of the Lancashire cotton industry. It seems likely this is where the town gained its name. George Bond was originally in the business of importing hosiery and underwear but during World War I began manufacturing hosiery in Redfern and by 1925 was producing a quarter of Australia's output of hosiery and knitted garments. Bond Industries Limited became a public company in 1927. The railway station at Pendle Hill opened here on 12 April 1924. The first government school opened in 1955 and the first post office was opened in 1956 by Postmaster Sqn. Ldr.[Rtd] Richard R. Purdie M.B.E. and his wife Elsie.

The player explores a standard 2-D overworld but is transported into space for side-scrolling shooter random battles. The story focus on a space pilot named Ian Recker who goes undercover against Earth's enemies, the Krill, in a battle to save the planet. ==Gameplay== There are two distinct portions of the game: an overworld where the player control Recker directly, and side- scrolling shooter random battles. ===Overworld=== In the overworld, Recker travels around either talking to people to advance the plot or searching for items and data on one of several planets. As the game progresses, his abilities expand: he is given more weapons to fight the local flora and fauna, and he receive power-ups that lets him pass different barriers to his progress. ===Ship Battles=== As the player traverse the various planets, they are frequently transported into space to pilot the Krill defense fleet surrounding each planet. The ships are biological in nature and semiautonomous: they only require a pilot when they sense danger. In most battles, the player are required to shoot down a certain number of enemies to end the sequence. The ship battles are where the RPG elements of the game come in: as the player kill enemies, they drop experience bubbles, which power up the offensive and defensive capabilities. The player can further increase their abilities through the Gun Data system. Unlike many shooters, there is no need to have a fixed ship in this game. The player are transported to a different ship in one of half a dozen classes, chosen randomly by the game. In some battles they will fly a small, agile attack ship, in some a bomber, and in some a lumbering cargo vessel. ===Gun Data=== The Gun Data system allows the player to customize how their ship fires its weapons. There are three categories that can be changed: cannon, bullet, and impact. The cannon alters the direction and manner in which the bullets fire (forwards, backwards, rapid fire, etc.), Bullet alters the shot type (large, long-range, chargeable, etc.), and Impact determines what the bullet does when it hits an enemy (explodes, drops health, etc.). The game includes dozens of different options for each data, mostly found by exploration in the overworld. The total number of combinations is 15,680, although only one can be used in any given battle. ==Story== The main character is Ian Recker, a decorated pilot who goes undercover to investigate the enemy species known as Krill. The Krill attacked Earth by gouging out a hole the size of Canada under the Atlantic Ocean, which caused the oceans to boil, nearly destroying all life on Earth. Recker gets \\"captured\\" by the Krill, who outfit him with a Krill parasite suit that makes him stronger and faster than a normal human being, and enables him to fly their biological ships. He quickly becomes embroiled in a race across several planets for control of mysterious \\"bio-matter\\" in the cores of the planets. After several betrayals, it becomes apparent that the \\"bio-matter\\" is in fact a monstrous weapon, and both the Krill High Command and Recker's superiors are after it. The plot is complicated by the existence of a virus, first considered a biological weapon against the Krill, but which turns out to destroy the \\"bio-matter\\". ===Characters=== Much of the game revolves around the shifting relationships between Recker's female companions: the Krill pilot, Psyme, and the human scientist, Scarlet. Neither trusts the other, and Recker is torn between maintaining his cover with Psyme and protecting his fellow human Scarlet from the Krill. Other important characters include the commanders of various Krill starbases, Commander Tierney, Recker's commanding officer, and Blune, a Krill officer who complicates matters as the game goes on. Tierney is named after Adam Tierney, part of the development team for the game. ===Endings=== Depending on the actions taken in the last chapter of the story, there are four different endings with different scenes at the end; specifically, the ending depends on whether Psyme and/or Scarlet die in the last chapter. Although Psyme can be saved in the first playthrough, Scarlet will die in the first playthrough and cannot be saved unless the player resumes from a New Game+ game. Also, a special ending is shown if both Psyme and Scarlet are saved and all of the Gun Data is collected. ==Reception== Sigma Star Saga received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Greg Kasavin of GameSpot praised the game's original ideas of blending elements from the shoot 'em up genre with the role-playing genre, but noted that gameplay can get tedious after backtracking certain areas of the game. ==References== ==External links== *Official website * Category:2005 video games Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:Game Boy Advance-only games Category:Namco games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Scrolling shooters Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Sigma Star Saga"},{"id":"2580971","text":"Pagewood is a suburb in southern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 8 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district.

All versions of Manetho's Epitome reports that Amenophthis (Amenemope's Hellenised name) enjoyed 9 years of reign, a duration more or less confirmed by archaeological sources.Kitchen, §§ 3-4; 31 Neither children nor wives are known for him, and he was succeeded by the seemingly unrelated Osorkon the Elder. According to the analysis of his skeleton performed by Dr. Douglas Derry, Amenemope was a strongly-built man who reached a fairly advanced age., p. 149 It seems that the king suffered a skull infection which likely developed into meningitis and led to his death.Goyon, p. 164 ==Burial== Full view of the Royal Necropolis of Tanis (NRT). Amenemope was originally buried in NRT IV and later reburied in NRT III, left granite chamber, next to Psusennes I Amenemope was originally buried in the only chamber of a small tomb (NRT IV) in the royal necropolis of Tanis; a few years after his death, during the reign of Siamun, Amenemope was moved and reburied in NRT III, inside the chamber once belonging to his purported mother Mutnedjmet and just next to Psusennes I.Goyon, pp. 87; 163 His undisturbed tomb was rediscovered by French Egyptologists Pierre Montet and Georges Goyon in April 1940, just a month before the Nazi invasion of France. Montet had to stop his excavation until the end of World War II, then resumed it in 1946 and later published his findings in 1958. When the excavators entered the small burial chamber, they argued that it was originally made for queen Mutnedjmet. The chamber contained an uninscribed granite sarcophagus, some vessels including the canopic jars and the vessel once containing the water used for washing the mummy, and a heap of around 400 ushabtis; a wooden coffin covered with gold leaf was placed within the sarcophagus and contained Amenemope's mummy. On the mummy were found two gilt funerary masks, two pectorals, necklaces, bracelets, rings and a cloisonné collar. Four of these items bore the name of Psusennes I.Goyon, p. 163, p. 156 The funerary masks depict the king as young, although Goyon stated that at the moment of discovery the masks had an expression of suffering and pleading, later softened after restoration. The mummy and funerary goods are now in Cairo Museum. Amenemope was buried with far less opulence than his neighbour Psusennes I: for comparison, the latter was provided with a solid silver coffin and a solid gold mask, while the former's coffin and mask were merely gilt. ==See also== * List of pharaohs ==References== ==Bibliography== * Derry, D.E., Report on Skeleton of King Amenemopet, ASAE 41 (1942), 149. * * * ==External links== *Sarcophagus of Amenemope Category:11th-century BC Pharaohs Category:10th- century BC Pharaohs Category:Pharaohs of the Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt Category:Ancient Egyptian mummies Category:11th-century BC births Category:992 BC deaths Category:Deaths from meningitis Category:11th century BC in Egypt Category:10th century BC in Egypt Category:11th-century BC rulers Category:10th-century BC rulers ","title":"Amenemope (pharaoh)"},{"id":"2580978","text":"Galactica may refer to: *Galactica (moth), a moth genus * Battlestar Galactica, a fictional spacecraft and an American science fiction franchise * Imperium Galactica, a computer game * Galactica (roller coaster), at Alton Towers in Staffordshire, England ==See also== * Galaxia (disambiguation) * Galaxy (disambiguation) ","title":"Galactica"},{"id":"2580985","text":"The List of Kuge families were the high level bureaucrats and nobles (kuge) in the Japanese Imperial court.Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric.

It is located 26 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the Sutherland Shire. ==Location== Oyster Bay is a natural feature on the southern bank of the Georges River. Green Point and Caravan Head are localities within the suburb of Oyster Bay. Green Point is home to the Green Point Observatory, home of the Sutherland Astronomical Society. Coronation Bay is also located on the Georges River between Green Point and Caravan Head. At Coronation Bay there is a large mangrove area that creates a diverse and dynamic eco-system, which supports a variety of bird-life. Carina Bay is located on the western boundary of the suburb.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 195 ==History== Oyster Bay takes its name from the abundance of oysters that were found in the bay. The name had appeared on maps prepared by Surveyor Wells in 1840. Oyster Bay was part of the Thomas Holt Estate of 12,000 acres purchased in 1861 by Thomas Holt (1811-1888), pastoralist and at one time, Colonial Treasurer of New South Wales. His estate covered most of present-day Sutherland Shire. Parish maps dating from 1880 show Scylla and Carina Roads clearly dissecting the area known as Oyster Bay. These were boundary lines between the individual Holt acreages. The Parish Map of 1913 shows a subdivision, called “By the Water Estate”, with an early alignment of Caravan Head, Como and Oyster Bay Roads. The first house, situated at 19 Como Road was built in 1910. It belonged to Samuel and Eliza Hall. A general store was opened in 1925. The 1925 Parish Map has “The Village of Oyster Bay” written on it. The suburb's name was officially recognised in 1933. Oyster Bay Public School was opened in 1945. Oyster Bay developed after this with post World War II migration creating a need for the release of land for housing. A feature of Oyster Bay is that steps and pathways, which were built during the 1930s, provide pedestrian access from the highest part of the suburb to the shops beside the bay. Steps and a pathway also lead from Green Point to Como, giving access to the old Como railway station and to Como Public School (est. 1921). ==Commercial area== A small group of shops is located at the intersection of Como Road and Oyster Bay Road, almost at sea level. It includes a post office, chemist, a liquor-stop, a corner store, a coffee store/restaurant, a newsagency and a bakery. Oyster bay Public School is nearby in Sage Ave. A dance school is located on Como Road at the Community Centre. The nearest gym is in Jannali/Kareela. ==Churches== Churches in Oyster Bay include St Joseph Catholic Church, located on the border with Como, Oyster Bay Baptist Church, located at Green Point and Kingsway Community Church. There is also a Community Hall. ==School== Oyster Bay Public School holds it annual Arts and Craft festival every year in the last weekend of May. The year 2010 was the 40th anniversary of the festival and takes place annually. Oyster Bay Public School is split between two locations on Phillip Street: primary students (Years 3-6) and the infants department (K-2), 300 metres up the road. There are two pre-schools in Oyster Bay. One is at Caravan Head between the former general store and business centre, and another at Green Point along the track to the Green Point Observatory. ==Parks== Oyster Bay Oval lies on the bay. It was reclaimed in the 1960s from the Mangroves which surround the bay. It is home to the Georges River Soccer Club, also known as the Tigers - http://www.georgesriversoccer.org.au aerial view of Georges River Crescent There is also a small public park at the corner of Green Point and Caravan Head Roads. The Green Point Observatory was built here in 1969. Caravan Head Bushland Reserve is located on the northern part of Oyster Bay. ==Sport== In addition to the Tigers, there are a number of local clubs in other sports covering Oyster Bay. The local baseball club is Comets http://www.comets.org.au and the local hockey club is Tartans http://www.tartanshockey.org.au ==Transport== The area is serviced by Transdev NSW buses, which travel around Caravan Head 10 times per day. It is a short distance from both Jannali railway station and Como railway station. Roads connect the suburb to the nearby Princes Highway at Kareela and to Sutherland. ==Population== According to the 2006 Australian Bureau of Statistics Census of Population, there were 4,907 people usually resident in Oyster Bay. 15.0% stated they were born overseas with the top countries of birth being United Kingdom 5.1%, New Zealand 1.2% and South Africa 0.6%. English was stated as the only language spoken at home by 90.7% of residents and the most common other languages spoken were Greek 1.8%, Italian 0.9% and Cantonese 0.7%.

Adjoining the Frogmore Estate was the York Estate, originally owned by the York family. When it was subdivided in the late 1880s, the land was mainly sold for orchards and vineyards. By the early 1900s a rural community had established in the area and a village developed. The Mount Hope Methodist Church was built in 1904 and the York Estate Public School was built in 1910. Until this time the area had no consistent name being known by different people as Frogmore, York and Mount Hope.

The terminology is based on the teachings of St. Thomas Aquinas, who said: \\"God alone satisfies\\" (Exposition of the Apostles’ Creed 1). This is based on the Bible: \\"Come to me all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\\" (Gospel of Matthew 11: 28); \\"Only God is good\\" (Gospel of Luke 18:19). Aquinas in his philosophy also discussed summum bonum, the greatest good. ==Biblical basis== Jesus Christ, whom Christian theology considers as God, said: \\"Come to me all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me: for I am gentle and lowly in heart: and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden light.\\" (Mt 11: 28-30) Jesus Christ also said: \\"Consider the lilies, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass which is alive in the field today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O men of little faith! And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, nor be of anxious mind. For all the nations of the world seek these things; and your Father knows that you need them. Instead, seek his kingdom, and these things shall be yours as well. (Lk 12:27-31) In his discussion with a young man, he also said: \\"Only God is good.\\" (Luke 18:19) David says to God in a Psalm, \\"You open your hand; you satisfy the desire of every living thing.\\" (Psalm 145:16) These and dozens of other scriptures refer to God as satisfaction for mankind. ==Theological and philosophical basis== ===On the part of man=== According to Christian philosophy, the basis of the doctrine that only God satisfies the human soul is that the faculties of man which makes him really human are the intellect and will. These two faculties, which distinguishes him from animals, are \\"open to the infinite.\\" This means that with his intellect or mind, man can always \\"know more\\" i.e. he can keep on receiving new information, new meaning without ever filling up. He can also \\"love more\\", i.e. he can always expand the quantity of the people and things he loves, and he can also improve the quality of that love. Thus only the Infinite God can satisfy the human spirit that is open to the infinite. St. Thomas in Summa contra Gentiles states: \\"the will's desire is satisfied by the divine good alone as its last end.\\" ===On the part of God=== Peter Kreeft, a Christian philosopher who follows the steps of Thomas Aquinas, says that only God wins in the list of Candidates for the Greatest Good. He lists other candidates which people seek: pleasure, power, money, honor, virtue, wisdom. And they all pale in comparison with God because they are temporary, limited, and many are means to an end and not the end itself. :Salary is no longer the sole satisfier, nor the key to employee loyalty. Instead, loyalty is tied to the feelings workers get from their workplaces, and the values and ethics that are transmitted from the leadership. Just like Tom Cruise's character in the movie Jerry McGuire, employees are seeking deeper meaning and inspiration from their work, evaluating their companies' ethics and searching for their own. ==Saints== ===Cyprian=== Cyprian is one of the Fathers of the Church. :To those who seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness, he has promised to give all else besides. Since everything indeed belongs to God, he who possesses God wants for nothing, if he himself is not found wanting before God. ===Augustine=== Augustine is the foremost Western Father of the Church. In modern language, he was, before his conversion to Christianity, considered a playboy and a cafeteria believer, choosing whatever faith suited him. These did not satisfy him thus he wrote one of his most famous words: :You have made us, O Lord, for yourself, and our heart is restless until it rests in you. (Confessions of St. Augustine, 1) :We all want to live happily; in the whole human race there is no one who does not assent to this proposition, even before it is fully articulated. How is it, then, that I seek you, Lord? Since in seeking you, my God, I seek a happy life, let me seek you so that my soul may live, for my body draws life from my soul and my soul draws life from you. ===Thomas Aquinas=== Aquinas wrote the Summa Theologiae, a comprehensive summation or compendium of theology. :Eternal life is the perfect fulfillment of desire, because each of the blessed will have more than he desired or hoped for. In this life, no one can fulfill his desires, nor can any creature satisfy a man’s craving. God alone satisfies and infinitely surpasses man’s desires, which therefore can never rest except in God. ===Teresa of Avila=== Teresa of Avila was a Mystic and is a Doctor of the Church. God as the Sole Satisfier of human longing is one of the central teachings of the Discalced Carmelite reform that she and St. John of the Cross collaborated upon in the 16th century. :Let nothing trouble you :Let nothing frighten you :Everything passes :God never changes :Patience :Obtains all :Whoever has God :Wants for nothing :God alone is enough. ===Josemaria=== Josemaria is the founder of Opus Dei who preached about the universal call to holiness. :After twenty centuries, we have to proclaim with complete conviction that the spirit of Christ has not lost its redemptive force, which alone can satisfy the desires of the human heart. Begin by feeding that truth into your own heart, which will be perpetually restless, as Saint Augustine wrote, until it rests entirely in God. :Once we recognise the insignificant and contingent nature of our earthly endeavours, the way is then open for true hope, a hope which upgrades all human work and turns it into a meeting point with God. ... Perhaps there is no greater tragedy for man than the sense of disillusionment he suffers when he has corrupted or falsified his hope, by placing it in something other than the one Love which satisfies without ever satiating. :'Stay with us; it is towards evening, and it is far on in the day,' night is coming on. That's just like us. Always short on daring, perhaps because we are insincere, or because we feel embarrassed. Deep down, what we are really thinking is: 'Stay with us, because our souls are shrouded in darkness and You alone are the light. You alone can satisfy this longing that consumes us.' For 'we know full well which among all things fair and honourable is the best: to possess God for ever.' ==Catholic authorities== ===Catechism=== The Catechism of the Catholic Church is the result of four centuries of scholarship and teaching after the Catechism of Trent of the 16th Century. :The Beatitudes respond to the natural desire for happiness. This desire is of divine origin: God has placed it in the human heart in order to draw man to the One who alone can fulfill it. :The beatitude we are promised confronts us with decisive moral choices. It invites us to purify our hearts of bad instincts and to seek the love of God above all else. It teaches us that true happiness is not found in riches or well-being, in human fame or power, or in any human achievement - however beneficial it may be - such as science, technology, and art, or indeed in any creature, but in God alone, the source of every good and of all love. ===Benedict XVI=== In his book, Jesus of Nazareth, Pope Benedict XVI stressed that \\"The issue is the primacy of God.\\" He said that God is \\"the reality without which nothing else can be good... If man's heart is not good, then nothing else can turn out good either. And the goodness of the human heart can ultimately come only from the One who is goodness, who is the Good itself.\\" Benedict XVI also asked rhetorically: \\"What did Jesus actually bring, if not world peace, universal prosperity, and a better world? The answer is very simple: God. He has brought God. ....He has brought God, and now we know his face, now we can call upon him. Now we know the path that we human beings have to take in this world. Jesus has brought God and with God the truth about our origin and destiny: faith, hope, and love. The importance of \\"faith, hope and love\\" was already emphasized by the then Cardinal Ratzinger in his book God and the World. There he quotes Sor Lucia on what is the real message of Fatima. Sor Lucia told him to tell the world this: Don't take notice of the other things related to the Fatima story. The only message that is important is \\"faith, hope and love.\\" Benedict's first two encyclicals are on love and hope. == See also == *Eastern Catholicism *Eastern Orthodoxy *Fall of man *Foolishness for Christ *Hermit *Hesychasm *Kenosis *Theosis ==Notes== Category:Attributes of God in Christian theology ","title":"Sole Satisfier"},{"id":"2581033","text":"Blow Up is a live album by jazz vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson, released on the Jazz Music Yesterday label.Mortensen, Scott. \\"Bobby Hutcherson & Harold Land - Blow Up.\\" Bobby Hutcherson Discography.

Cangas del Narcea is the oldest municipality in the Principality of Asturias in Spain. It is also the largest municipality in Asturias. It is in the southwest of Asturias, on the Asturian border with León. Formerly, Cangas del Narcea was known as Cangas de Tineo (Asturian: Cangas de Tinéu).

In 2002 a new natural park was created, the Natural Park of Fuentes del Narcea, Degaña, and Ibias (Parque Natural de Fuentes del Narcea, Degaña e Ibias), an area of 550 km² (212 sq mi). The natural park provides the core area of the biosphere reserve with a buffer zone. The park's formation prompted legal action by landowners, but a management plan for the protected area was approved in 2006.

The name was chosen because it is descriptive of its location, a woodland area in the north. Mrs Davy also built a ferry at her own expense, so that her family could travel to the city by ferry.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia For the early history of Northwood see John and Pam Ball, Exploring the early history of Northwood, Riverview, 2016. == Heritage listings == Northwood has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 1 Private Road: Northwood House ==Transport== The nearest railway station is St Leonards and buses run frequently through the area.

It is located 6 kilometres north of the Sydney Central Business District, in the local government area of the City of Willoughby. The Suspension Bridge, linking the suburb to Cammeray, has become a recognised symbol of Northbridge, completed in January 1892 and purchased by the state government in 1912. The suburb celebrated its centenary in 2013. ==History== Northbridge took its name from its location, north of a sandstone suspension bridge built in 1892. The bridge was constructed by a team of land developers at a cost of A£42,000 and originally known as North Sydney Bridge. The engineer responsible for the construction was J. E. Coyle and the style was Federation Gothic, with medieval motifs as \\"unexpected embellishments\\". It has been known as the Northbridge and Cammeray Suspension Bridge but is now called the Long Gully Bridge.http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/constructionmaintenance/majorconstructionprojectssydney/long_gully/index.html The land where the suspension bridge was built belonged to William Twemlow, a Sydney jeweller. In 1868 he purchased the land extending from Fig Tree Point to the head of Long Bay, (now Northbridge). He initially regarded the land as valueless but changed his mind when he made a handsome profit by selling some of it to an English syndicate who built the suspension bridge. Twemlow decided to build a two storey home called The Hermitage, on Fig Tree Point, from sandstone quarried on the estate, which took a year to cut. As this was the first house built in this locality, transport was a problem and Twemlow had to sail through The Spit and around Middle Head to Circular Quay, from where he walked to his shop at Sydney Arcade. Northbridge Post Office opened on 25 November 1920. ==Commercial area== Northbridge Map Clock Dedication Northbridge Plaza is a shopping centre owned by AMP Capital. It is located on the corner of Eastern Valley Way and Sailors Bay Road, and it features a Woolworths supermarket, banks, groceries, a butchery, a bakery, a chemist, and a range of specialty shops. Northbridge is also home to several cafes and wine stores, including those at Bond's Corner (voted Australia's best wine store 2013 and 2014). Bond's Corner is a heritage listed building. ==Transport== Bus routes 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208 and 209 from Wynyard, in the Sydney CBD, travel through Northbridge. A bus stop is located at the major intersection between Strathallen Avenue and Sailors Bay Road. At the 2011 census, 22% of employed people travelled to work on public transport and 52% by car (either as driver or as passenger). ==Community== The Northbridge Progress Association Incorporated (NPA) is a non-profit community organisation that has been representing the residents of Northbridge since November 1919. Today, the NPA’s activities remain focused on preserving our open space and family-friendly facilities.

It was written at the invitation of the U.S. Office of War Information, in order to understand and predict the behavior of the Japanese in World War II by reference to a series of contradictions in traditional culture. The book was influential in shaping American ideas about Japanese culture during the occupation of Japan, and popularized the distinction between guilt cultures and shame cultures.Ezra F. Vogel, Foreword, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword (Boston: Houghton Mifflin 1989) Although it has received harsh criticism, the book has continued to be influential. Two anthropologists wrote in 1992 that there is \\"a sense in which all of us have been writing footnotes to [Chrysanthemum] since it appeared in 1946\\". Plath, David W., and Robert J. Smith, \\"How 'American' Are Studies of Modern Japan Done in the United States\\", in Harumi Befu and Joseph Kreiner, eds., Otherness of Japan: Historical and Cultural Influences on Japanese Studies in Ten Countries, Munchen: The German Institute of Japanese Studies, as quoted in Ryang, Sonia, \\"Chrysanthemum's Strange Life: Ruth Benedict in Postwar Japan\\", accessed January 13, 2007 The Japanese, Benedict wrote, are > both aggressive and unaggressive, both militaristic and aesthetic, both > insolent and polite, rigid and adaptable, submissive and resentful of being > pushed around, loyal and treacherous, brave and timid, conservative and > hospitable to new ways...Ruth Benedict, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, > page 2, 1946 The book also affected Japanese conceptions of themselves.Kent, Pauline, \\"Japanese Perceptions of the Chrysanthemum and the Sword,\\" Dialectical Anthropology 24.2 (1999): 181.

Embree, The Japanese Nation: A Social Survey (New York: Farrar & Rinehart, 1945 is an instance of \\"culture at a distance,\\" the study of a culture through its literature, newspaper clippings, films, and recordings, as well as extensive interviews with German-Americans or Japanese-Americans. The techniques were necessitated by anthropologists' inability to visit Nazi Germany or wartime Japan. One later ethnographer pointed out, however, that although \\"culture at a distance\\" had the \\"elaborate aura of a good academic fad, the method was not so different from what any good historian does: to make the most creative use possible of written documents.\\"Vogel, Foreword, p. x. Anthropologists were attempting to understand the cultural patterns that might be driving the aggression of once-friendly nations, and they hoped to find possible weaknesses or means of persuasion that had been missed. Americans found themselves unable to comprehend matters in Japanese culture. For instance, Americans considered it quite natural that American prisoners of war would want their families to know that they were alive and that they would keep quiet when they were asked for information about troop movements, etc. However, Japanese prisoners of war apparently gave information freely and did not try to contact their families. ==Reception in the United States== Between 1946 and 1971, the book sold only 28,000 hardback copies, and a paperback edition was not issued until 1967. Benedict played a major role in grasping the place of the Emperor of Japan in Japanese popular culture, and formulating the recommendation to President Franklin D. Roosevelt that permitting continuation of the Emperor's reign had to be part of the eventual surrender offer. ==Later reception and criticism== More than two million copies of the book have been sold in Japan since it first appeared in translation there. John W. Bennett and Michio Nagai, two scholars on Japan, pointed out in 1953 that the translated book \\"has appeared in Japan during a period of intense national self-examination -- a period during which Japanese intellectuals and writers have been studying the sources and meaning of Japanese history and character, in one of their perennial attempts to determine the most desirable course of Japanese development.\\" Hardacre, Helen, \\"The Postwar Development of Japanese Studies in the United States\\", (Brill: 1998), via Google Books; the Bennett-Nagai quote may be from John W. Bennett and Nagai Michio, \\"The Japanese critique of Benedict's The Chrysanthemum and the Sword,\\" American Anthropologist 55 :401-411 [1953], mentioned at Web page titled \\"Reading notes for Ruth Benedict's The Chrysanthemum and the Sword (1946)\\" at the Web site of William W. Kelly, Professor of Anthropology & Sumitomo Professor of Japanese Studies, Yale University; both Web sites accessed January 13, 2007 Japanese social critic and philosopher Tamotsu Aoki said that the translated book \\"helped invent a new tradition for postwar Japan.\\" It helped to create a growing interest in \\"ethnic nationalism\\" in the country, shown in the publication of hundreds of ethnocentric nihonjinron (treatises on 'Japaneseness') published over the next four decades. Although Benedict was criticized for not discriminating among historical developments in the country in her study, \\"Japanese cultural critics were especially interested in her attempts to portray the whole or total structure ('zentai kōzō') of Japanese Culture,\\" as Helen Hardacre put it. C. Douglas Lummis has said the entire \\"nihonjinron\\" genre stems ultimately from Benedict's book. The book began a discussion among Japanese scholars about \\"shame culture\\" vs. \\"guilt culture,\\" which spread beyond academia, and the two terms are now established as ordinary expressions in the country. Soon after the translation was published, Japanese scholars, including Kazuko Tsurumi, Tetsuro Watsuji, and Kunio Yanagita criticized the book as inaccurate and having methodological errors. American scholar C. Douglas Lummis has written that criticisms of Benedict's book that are \\"now very well known in Japanese scholarly circles\\" include that it represented the ideology of a class for that of the entire culture, \\"a state of acute social dislocation for a normal condition, and an extraordinary moment in a nation's history as an unvarying norm of social behavior.\\" Japanese ambassador to Pakistan Sadaaki Numata said the book was a \\"must reading for many students of Japanese studies.\\" According to Margaret Mead, the author's former student and a fellow anthropologist, other Japanese who have read it found it on the whole accurate but somewhat \\"moralistic.\\" Sections of the book were mentioned in Takeo Doi's book, The Anatomy of Dependence, but he is highly critical of her analysis of Japan and the West as respectively shame and guilt cultures. In a 2002 symposium at The Library of Congress in the United States, Shinji Yamashita, of the department of anthropology at the University of Tokyo, added that there has been so much change since World War II in Japan that Benedict would not recognize the nation she described in 1946. Wolfskill, Mary, \\"Human Nature and the Power of Culture: Library Hosts Margaret Mead Symposium\\", article in Library of Congress Information Bulletin, January 2002, as accessed at the U.S. Library of Congress Web site, January 13, 2008 Lummis wrote, \\"After some time I realized that I would never be able to live in a decent relationship with the people of that country unless I could drive this book, and its politely arrogant world view, out of my head.\\" Lummis, C. Douglas, \\"Ruth Benedict's Obituary for Japanese Culture\\", article in Japan Focus an online academic, peer-reviewed journal of Japanese studies, accessed October 11, 2013 Lummis, who went to the Vassar College archives to review Benedict’s notes, wrote that he found some of her more important points were developed from interviews with Robert Hashima, a Japanese-American native of the United States who was taken to Japan as a child, educated there, then returned to the US before World War II began. According to Lummis, who interviewed Hashima, the circumstances helped introduce a certain bias into Benedict's research: \\"For him, coming to Japan for the first time as a teenager smack in the middle of the militaristic period and having no memory of the country before then, what he was taught in school was not 'an ideology', it was Japan itself.\\" Lummis thinks Benedict relied too much on Hashima and says that he was deeply alienated by his experiences in Japan and that \\"it seems that he became a kind of touchstone, the authority against which she would test information from other sources.\\" ==Reception in China== The first Chinese translation was made by Taiwanese anthropologist Huang Dao-Ling, and published in Taiwan in April 1974 by Taiwan Kui-Kuang Press. The book became a bestseller in China in 2005, when relations with the Japanese government were strained. In that year alone, 70,000 copies of the book were sold in China. ==See also== * Bushidō * Honne and tatemae ==Notes== ==Further reading== * Kent, Pauline, \\"Misconceived Configurations of Ruth Benedict,\\" Japan Review 7 (1996): 33-60. * Kent, Pauline, \\"Japanese Perceptions of the Chrysanthemum and the Sword,\\" Dialectical anthropology 24.2 (1999): 181. * Sonya Ryang, \\"Chrysanthemum’s Strange Life: Ruth Benedict in Postwar Japan,\\" Asian Anthropology 1: 87-116. * Christopher Shannon, \\"A World Made Safe for Differences: Ruth Benedict's The Chrysanthemum and the Sword,\\" American Quarterly 47 (1995): 659-680. ==External links== * * \\"Ruth Benedict, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword\\" (Allison Alexy Yale University, archived July 22, 2015) Category:1946 non-fiction books Category:Anthropology books Category:Books about Japan Category:Houghton Mifflin books Category:Works about Japan ","title":"The Chrysanthemum and the Sword"},{"id":"2581104","text":"Denis O.

The group's programs are intended to promote social and political equality in the areas of economics, education, health care, housing, the environment and social justice. The group is a member of the Black Leadership Forum and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. Rev. Lennox Yearwood Jr., President & CEO of the Hip Hop Caucus is a former co-creator of P. Diddy's \\"Vote or Die\\" campaign of 2004. In 2003 and 2004 he was the Political and Grassroots Director for Russell Simmons' Hip Hop Summit Action Network, as well as a Senior Consultant to Jay-Z's Citizen Change \\"Voice Your Choice\\" campaign. == Campaigns and events == === Respect My Vote === Respect My Vote! is a voter mobilization campaign that aims to educate, register and mobilize young people of color between the ages of 18-39 who live in urban communities, do not attend college, people with felony records who are unaware of their voting rights, and students at historically black colleges and universities. In 2008, the Hip Hop Caucus and the hip hop artist T.I. launched the \\"Respect My Vote\\" youth voting campaign. There was a higher number of young voters at the 2008 election, subsequent to higher turnout seen in 2004 and 2006. Analysis of the 2008 electorate showed that while overall numbers of voters did not increase as dramatically as expected, the composition of the electorate was notably different, with increased participation seen among minority youth voters, the Hip Hop Caucus' target demographic. ==== One Vote Day ==== The Hip Hop Caucus' Respect My Vote! Campaign, along with Radio One registered more than 30,000 voters during its national “One Vote Day” voter registration drive on September 30, 2008. Sixteen cities across the country participated in events aimed at mass voter registration. Radio One stations broadcast live from central locations in each of the participating cities urging unregistered voters to attend their local registration site to register onsite. Artists such as Nelly and Raheem DeVaughn helped draw large crowds to registration stations, allowing Hip Hop Caucus volunteers to register voters. ==== Respect My Vote! National Bus Tour ==== During the 2008 general elections The Respect My Vote! campaign traveled to 20 cities on the “Respect My Vote! Get Out The Vote Bus Tour” to encourage voting by distributing pledge cards and having celebrities discuss the value of voting. The tour included the largest ever Get Out the Vote Rally at Florida A&M; University. === Green 2 Live === Green 2 Live aims to raise awareness within low-income communities of color about what they believe to be the impacts of climate change on their communities, and train leaders in sustainable energy activism, for which the Hip Hop Caucus created \\"Green the City\\" and \\"Green the Block\\" campaigns. Events have included the \\"Hip Hop Caucus Clean Energy Now Tour\\", with the Alliance for Climate Protection and the \\"Historically Black College and University Tour\\" with the National Wildlife Federation ==== Green the Block ==== \\"Green the Block\\" is a national campaign and coalition created by the Hip Hop Caucus and Green For All. This campaign is aimed at promoting activism for sustainable energy in low-income communities of color. The campaign, which was launched at the White House on President Barack Obama's birthday (August 4, 2009), aims to educate and encourage people to take better care of the environment. Green the Block has helped organize over 100 community service projects in cities around the U.S. including Memphis, Tennessee, Oakland, California, Washington, D.C., and Miami. The campaign hosted a 16-city \\"Campus Consciousness Tour\\" featuring hip-hop artist Drake to encourage college students to join sustainable energy efforts. ==== Green the City ==== Launched in 2010 as a joint campaign between the National Conference of Black Mayors and the Hip Hop Caucus Education Fund, Green the City works with African American mayors and city residents to promote activism for sustainable energy. June 28–30, 2010 the Hip Hop Caucus Education Fund and the National Conference of Black Mayors hosted the \\"Green the City Advocacy Summit\\" that brought 25 mayors to Washington, DC, to attend a \\"Green the City\\" campaign and to meet with members of the United States Congress, Obama administration officials, and heads of the United States Environmental Protection Agency to advocate for sustainable energy in the U.S. === March on Gretna === On November 7, 2005, Rev. Yearwood led the first post- Hurricane Katrina march in Gretna, Louisiana to protest the alleged racial profiling of survivors. The march attracted 150 participants, including many displaced residents. As a result of this effort, police officers were convicted of denying human rights to African-American families displaced by Hurricane Katrina. === Gulf Coast Renewal === The Hip Hop Caucus implemented the Gulf Coast Renewal campaign after the disaster of Hurricane Katrina. The campaign focused on the affected areas of the Gulf Coast including Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Rev. Yearwood and the Hip Hop Caucus organized partnerships with national and grassroots organizations to advocate for the rights of Hurricane Katrina survivors. After public mobilization, two marches in Washington, DC, testimony to Congress and other work by the group, the Federal Emergency Management Agency ceased preemptive temporary housing evictions of Katrina Survivors. To continue addressing the issue of displaced citizens in New Orleans and Iraq, due to the war the \\"We Care\\" concert was organized with Amnesty International. In 2005 the Institute for Policy Studies awarded the Hip Hop Caucus their Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award for the Gulf Coast Renewal Campaign, an annual award given by the Institute for Policy Studies to those helping to advance human rights. === Stop the Violence in New Orleans === Fifteen months after Hurricane Katrina, the Hip Hop Caucus hosted the \\"Stop the Violence\\" town hall meeting at McDonogh No. 35 Senior High School in New Orleans, LA. Hip-Hop artists and community activists gathered with youth, parents and other citizens, aiming to address the issue of gun violence in the city. Panelists included rappers Doug E. Fresh, Slim Thug and many local rappers, along with President Kenneth Barnes Sr. of ROOT Inc. (Reaching Out to Others Together), community activist Ronald Coleman, and Councilmen James Carter. Audience members and panelists discussed possible steps to be taken to put an end to the violence in the streets of New Orleans. === Enough is Enough === In 2007, the Hip Hop Caucus began to address the issues of violence, alleged police brutality, and hate crimes. On November 17, 2007, the Hip Hop Caucus organized a rally called \\"Enough is Enough, Stop Police Brutality and Hate Crimes\\" on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. This rally aimed to bring attention to the cases of Sean Bell, Megan Williams, Martin Lee Anderson, Deonte Rawlings and other young African-American victims of alleged police brutality and hate crimes. === Make Hip-Hop Not War === The Hip Hop Caucus launched the \\"Make Hip-Hop Not War\\" campaign in 2007 aiming to promote activism in the anti-war movement for young people. The Hip Hop Caucus along with hip-hop artists and Iraq War veterans, campaigned in 16 cities through a national bus tour. The tour consisted of rallies and round table discussions, intended to inform young people about the war in Afghanistan and the Iraq War, and to encourage them to speak out against war. This campaign also worked to lobby Congress to stop funding the war in Iraq. The \\"Make Hip- Hop Not War\\" campaign received the Walter E. Fauntroy No FEAR Institute Award on May 14, 2008 for its efforts to speak out against the government and war- supporting institutions. === Shut it Down, Stop the Torture === Hip Hop Caucus and Amnesty International organized the \\"Shut It Down, Stop the Torture\\" event in Washington, D.C. to advocate the closure of the U.S. Guantánamo Bay detention camp in Cuba. The informational briefing and concert was intended to raise awareness on human rights and the events that took place at Guantanamo Bay. The event was held on Juneteenth (June 19, 2007), in order to symbolically link the emancipation of slaves in the U.S. and the current situation at Guantanamo Bay. === Hip-Hop Help Haiti === After the 2010 Haiti earthquake that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, the Hip Hop Caucus created HipHopHelpHaiti.org, a network aimed at helping people to take action in response to the crisis. The 500 member online network is updated periodically and provides information on people can be involved and provide assistance to the Haitian population. === HOME === On 14 November 2014, the ensemble announced plans to release a full-length album entitled HOME. Scheduled for release via iTunes on 2 December 2014, the albums features songs from prominent artists such as Elle Varner, Ne-Yo and Crystal Waters. The first single from the album, \\"Mercy Mercy Me\\" by recording artist Antonique Smith has been released. == Discography == *HOME (2014) == References == ==External links== *Hip Hop Caucus Official Website *Hip Hop Caucus YouTube *Rev.

The nematode infects the roots of soybean, and the female nematode eventually becomes a cyst. Infection causes various symptoms that may include chlorosis of the leaves and stems, root necrosis, loss in seed yield and suppression of root and shoot growth. SCN has threatened the U.S. crop since the 1950s, reducing returns to soybean producers by $500 million each year and reducing yields by as much as 75 percent.Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service United States Department of Agriculture. 2000. Keeping the Profits in Soybeans It is also a significant problem in the soybean growing areas of South America and Asia. ==Biology== The second-stage juvenile, or J2, nematode is the only life stage that can penetrate roots. (The first-stage juvenile occurs in the egg, and third- and fourth-stages occur in the roots). The J2 enters the root moving through the plant cells to the vascular tissue where it feeds. The J2 induces cell division in the root to form specialized feeding sites. As the nematode feeds, it swells. The female swells so much that her posterior end bursts out of the root and she becomes visible to the naked eye. In contrast, the adult male regains a wormlike shape, and he leaves the root in order to find and fertilize the large females. The female continues to feed as she lays 200 to 400 eggs in a yellow gelatinous matrix, forming an egg sac which remains inside her. She then dies and her cuticle hardens forming a cyst. The eggs may hatch when conditions in the soil are favorable, the larvae developing inside the cyst and the biological cycle repeating itself. There are usually three generations in the year. In the autumn or in unfavorable conditions, the cysts containing dormant larvae may remain intact in the soil for several years.AgroAtlas Although soybean is the primary host of SCN, other legumes can also serve as hosts. Segment of soybean root infected with soybean cyst nematode. Signs of infection are white to brown cysts filled with eggs that are attached to root surfaces. ==Pathology== The aboveground symptoms of SCN infection are not unique to SCN infection, and could be confused with nutrient deficiency, particularly iron deficiency, stress from drought, herbicide injury or another disease. The first signs of infection are groups of plants with yellowing leaves that have stunted growth. The pathogen may also be difficult to detect on the roots, since stunted roots are also a common symptom of stress or plant disease. Observation of adult females and cysts on the roots is the only accurate way to detect and diagnose SCN infection in the field. ==Locations== *Africa: Egypt *Asia: Iran (Golestan Province and Mazandaran Province), China (Hebei, Hubei, Heilongjiang, Henan, Jiangsu, Liaoning), Indonesia (Java), Korean peninsula, Japan, Taiwan (unconfirmed), Russia (Amur District in the Far East). *North America: Canada (Ontario), USA (Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin). *South America: Argentina (unconfirmed), Brazil (unconfirmed), Chile, Colombia, Ecuador. ==Control== Cultural practices, such as crop rotation and the use of resistant cultivars, are used to limit the damage due to SCN. Because SCN is an obligate parasite (requires a living host), a crop rotation involving non-host plants can decrease the population of SCN and has been shown to be an effective management tool. Plants that are already stressed are more susceptible to infection, so good cultural practices, like maintaining soil fertility, pH and moisture can reduce the severity of infection. Chemical control with nematicides is not normally used because the economic and environmental costs are prohibitive. ==Notes== ==References== *Davis, E.L. and G.L. Tylka. 2000.

Members of this genus include several destructive agricultural pest species. == Range == Corn rootworms are one of the most economically significant consumers of maize in the United States. The western corn rootworm, D. virgifera virgifera, and the northern corn rootworm, D. barberi, are the most significant rootworm species in Iowa, a major corn-growing area. A third species, the southern corn rootworm, D. undecimpunctata howardi, causes much economic damage in other regions.Staff, Purdue University Extension Service. Corn Rootworms The range of this genus extends farther south into South America, Diabrotica speciosa causes damage in Argentina. Corn rootworm larvae can destroy significant acreage of corn if left untreated. In the United States, current estimates show of corn, out of 80 million total are infested with corn rootworm. Estimates of economic damage to corn growers from the pest are about $1 billion.Marra, M.C., Piggott, N.E., & Goodwin, B.K. (2012).

Western corn rootworm Diabrotica was unknown in Europe until the late 1990s and was forbidden even in laboratories because of the difficulty in eliminating it with insecticides. It appears to have entered Europe from the US in large numbers during the Yugoslav wars and is especially widespread around US military airports, whose planes were likely to have transported the pest. It has since spread primarily in Italy, France and Germany.Miller N et al. Multiple Transatlantic Introductions of the Western Corn Rootworm == Species == Several species of Diabrotica are significant insects of North America, including: * D. balteata - banded cucumber beetle * D. barberi - northern corn rootworm * D. undecimpunctata ** D. u. howardi - spotted cucumber beetle (southern corn rootworm) ** D. u. tenella - western cucumber beetle ** D. u. undecimpunctata - western spotted cucumber beetle * D. virgifera ** D. v. virgifera - western corn rootworm ** D. v. zeae - Mexican corn rootworm == D. undecimpunctata == Adults of D. undecimpunctata are greenish-yellow with six large black spots on each elytron. They are about long. The larvae are yellowish and wormlike. == D. virgifera == Adult rootworms are about long. Western corn rootworm adults are yellowish with a black stripe on each wing cover. Northern corn rootworm beetles are solid in color and vary from light tan to pale green. The eggs are deposited in the soil during the summer, and are football-shaped, white, and less than long. Larvae hatch in late May or early June and begin to feed on corn roots. Newly hatched larvae are small, less than long, white worms. They go through three larval instars, pupate in the soil and emerge as adults in July and August, with one generation per year. Larvae have brown heads and a brown marking on the top of the last abdominal segment, giving them a double-headed appearance. Larvae have three pairs of legs, but these are not usually visible without magnification. After feeding for several weeks, the larvae dig a cell in the soil and molt into the pupal stage. The pupal stage is white and has the basic shape of the adult. == References == == External links == * Diabrotica balteata on the UF / IFAS Featured Creatures Web site * Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi on the UF / IFAS Featured Creatures website.

The general idea is to provide the weakest constraints on players while still requiring that players are rational and this rationality is common knowledge among the players. It is more permissive than Nash equilibrium. Both require that players respond optimally to some belief about their opponents' actions, but Nash equilibrium requires that these beliefs be correct while rationalizability does not. Rationalizability was first defined, independently, by Bernheim (1984) and Pearce (1984). == Definition == Given a normal-form game, the rationalizable set of actions can be computed as follows: Start with the full action set for each player. Next, remove all actions which are never a best reply to any belief about the opponents' actions -- the motivation for this step is that no rational player could choose such actions. Next, remove all actions which are never a best reply to any belief about the opponents' remaining actions -- this second step is justified because each player knows that the other players are rational. Continue the process until no further actions are eliminated. In a game with finitely many actions, this process always terminates and leaves a non-empty set of actions for each player. These are the rationalizable actions. == Constraints on beliefs == { border=\\"1\\" align=right cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" + align=bottomCoordination game  ! A ! B - ! a  1, 1  0, 0 - ! b  0, 0  1, 1 } Consider a simple coordination game (the payoff matrix is to the right). The row player can play a if he can reasonably believe that the column player could play A, since a is a best response to A. He can reasonably believe that the column player can play A if it is reasonable for the column player to believe that the row player could play a. She can believe that he will play a if it is reasonable for her to believe that he could play a, etc. { border=\\"1\\" align=left cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" + align=bottom Prisoner's Dilemma  ! C ! D - ! c  2, 2  0, 3 - ! d  3, 0  1, 1 } This provides an infinite chain of consistent beliefs that result in the players playing (a, A). This makes (a, A) a rationalizable pair of actions. A similar process can be repeated for (b, B). As an example where not all strategies are rationalizable, consider a prisoner's dilemma pictured to the left. Row player would never play c, since c is not a best response to any strategy by the column player. For this reason, c is not rationalizable. { border=\\"1\\" align=right cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\"  ! L ! R - ! t  3, -  0, - - ! m  0, -  3, - - ! b  1, -  1, - } Conversely, for two- player games, the set of all rationalizable strategies can be found by iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies. For this method to hold however, one also needs to consider strict domination by mixed strategies. Consider the game on the right with payoffs of the column player omitted for simplicity. Notice that \\"b\\" is not strictly dominated by either \\"t\\" or \\"m\\" in the pure strategy sense, but it is still dominated by a strategy that would mix \\"t\\" and \\"m\\" with probability of each equal to 1/2. This is due to the fact that given any belief about the action of the column player, the mixed strategy will always yield higher expected payoff. This implies that \\"b\\" is not rationalizable. Moreover, \\"b\\" is not a best response to either \\"L\\" or \\"R\\" or any mix of the two. This is because an action that is not rationalizable can never be a best response to any opponent's strategy (pure or mixed). This would imply another version of the previous method of finding rationalizable strategies as those that survive the iterated elimination of strategies that are never a best response (in pure or mixed sense). In games with more than two players, however, there may be strategies that are not strictly dominated, but which can never be the best response. By the iterated elimination of all such strategies one can find the rationalizable strategies for a multiplayer game. == Rationalizability and Nash equilibria == It can be easily proved that every Nash equilibrium is a rationalizable equilibrium; however, the converse is not true. Some rationalizable equilibria are not Nash equilibria. This makes the rationalizability concept a generalization of Nash equilibrium concept. { border=\\"1\\" align=right cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" + align=bottomMatching pennies  ! H ! T - ! h  1, -1  -1, 1 - ! t  -1, 1  1, -1 } As an example, consider the game matching pennies pictured to the right. In this game the only Nash equilibrium is row playing h and t with equal probability and column playing H and T with equal probability. However, all the pure strategies in this game are rationalizable. Consider the following reasoning: row can play h if it is reasonable for her to believe that column will play H. Column can play H if its reasonable for him to believe that row will play t. Row can play t if it is reasonable for her to believe that column will play T. Column can play T if it is reasonable for him to believe that row will play h (beginning the cycle again). This provides an infinite set of consistent beliefs that results in row playing h. A similar argument can be given for row playing t, and for column playing either H or T. ==See also== * Self-confirming equilibrium ==Footnotes== == References == *Bernheim, D.

North Richmond is located 67 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Hawkesbury. It is separated from Richmond to the south-east by the Hawkesbury River. ==History== The traditional land owners of the town and surrounding district are the Darug people. In the early years of European Settlement, the area was known as Enfield. The name was changed at a later date during the 19th century to avoid confusion with Enfield in Sydney's west. While located to the west of the town of Richmond, it is thought to have been named North Richmond because it was north of Richmond Hill. This hill was named by Governor Philip when travelling up the Hawkesbury River in 1789. In 1833 the \\"Woolpack Inn\\" was opened on higher ground near the river crossing, by John Town, a prominent local landowner. In 1874 the name changed to the \\"Travellers' Rest\\". In 1933 a more modern hotel was built next to the old inn and in 1940 was renamed the \\"North Richmond Hotel\\". In the 1860s a wooden bridge was built across the Hawkesbury River to provide an easier crossing than the ferry or punt which had been used. In 1905 it was replaced by a higher-level bridge which was the largest reinforced concrete bridge to be constructed. It remained so for 20 years. In 1926 a railway branch line between Richmond and Kurrajong was opened. The railway bridge was built right next to the concrete bridge. The line curved to the right at the western end of the bridge before curving back around to cross Bells Line of Road at an angle near the intersection with Grose Vale Road. North Richmond had a railway station. When the line closed in 1952, the railway bridge became part of the roadway. Beside a hotel and school, North Richmond also had a police station and lockup and a Wesleyan (Methodist) Chapel. ==Population== According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 4,977 people in North Richmond. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 4.4% of the population. * 83.4% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 4.5%. * 90.8% of people spoke only English at home. * The most common responses for religion were No Religion 25.7%, Anglican 25.3% and Catholic 24.7%. ==Landmarks== North Richmond has three main roads. These are Grose Vale Road, Bells Line of Road and Terrace Road. North Richmond has a shopping mall consisting of a Coles supermarket and various shops including Domino's Pizza and Subway. There is the local primary school called Richmond North Public School and the high school, Colo High School. West of the town is the mountains and east is the Hawkesbury River. A Panthers Club is located in North Richmond. There are three main parks in North Richmond, John Wellington Oval, Turnbull Oval and Inalls Lane. Cricket is played at John Wellington Oval and Turnbull Oval. Soccer is played at Turnbull Oval and Inalls Lane. The Colo Cougars Soccer Club are based at Inalls Lane. == Heritage listings == North Richmond has the following heritage listings: * 108 Grose Vale Road: Yobarnie Keyline Farm ==Schools== Richmond North Public School on Grose Vale Road was established in 1871. It replaced the Church of England Denominational School which had operated at Enfield (as North Richmond was then known) for many years. Mr George Sanders, formally in charge of the Denominational School, was appointed the first teacher. The 1871 building was demolished to make way for new school buildings in the mid-1960s. Colo High School was established in 1978 in demountable buildings at North Richmond. The current permanent site was occupied in 1980. The blue and white colours were chosen to match colours selected by the Uniform Committee. Mr Sam Weller, the school's first Deputy Principal, suggested using the school building plan as a basis for the logo. Mr David Stone, founding Mathematics teacher, drew up the design which was accepted as the school badge. The shape also represents the Tree Of Knowledge, and its three sections, Students, Staff and the Community. ==References== Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:City of Hawkesbury Category:Hawkesbury River ","title":"North Richmond, New South Wales"},{"id":"2581146","text":"Typhoon Thompson in Search for the Sea Child is a 1988 computer game created by Dan Gorlin.

His widow, the puppeteer Margaret Robinson, also worked on many Hammer films. The knack that Bernard possessed was that he managed to give Hammer's films a very expensive look working from a tiny budget. Both space and materials were extremely limited at Bray Studios. Robinson got over this by ingeniously disguising previously used sets for different films, sometimes even for different scenes within the same film. Many films set he designed such as the hallways of the castle in Horror of Dracula (1958, pictured), for instance, doubled as the Holmwood crypt, and Dracula's crypt from the same year was recycled as Frankenstein's laboratory in Revenge of Frankenstein. Perhaps his biggest challenge was the 1962 Phantom of the Opera, which required a huge water-tank to be constructed for the Phantom's underground lair. Once again he proved his ability to work miracles out of the barest of resources, creating one of Hammer's most memorable and haunting set pieces. His sets on the Bray back lot were mammoth works of construction that would usually be employed for two or three films before being replaced. Among his best were the 1958 Castle Dracula/Baskerville Hall for Horror of Dracula and The Hound of the Baskervilles, respectively, the Gothic castle doubling for Dracula, Prince of Darkness and Rasputin, the Mad Monk in 1965, and perhaps supremely, the 19th- century Cornish village that provided the setting for The Plague of the Zombies and The Reptile in 1966. In Bernard's spare time, which was very limited, he wrote about antique furniture and was preparing a book on the subject before his untimely death. Another passion was paintings- but painting for himself and his particular sense of humour. In his painting the Tax Inspectors we see Bernard's humour bounce through with a crazed inspection in of tax officials going over a corpse with magnifying glass and probe. In The Au pair Robinson take on the foreign au pair invasion of the 1970s, this au pair, in casual wear, tennis racket to the ready and a general coolness to the sight of the parents and children within the interior - Mother on her knees and father laying a table while holding a dangling child. The style of Bernard Robinson's paintings could be associated with the great cubists or abstract painters of the period such as Picasso and Braque; his handling of paint bear him out as a phenomenal painter who knew his craft and, like Picasso's heavy narrative, he informs by subtle messages conveyed with a rigour of style and oil to canvas that its hard not to be impressed and informed at once. These paintings form part of a private collection of oils that will be shown next year (2013). Bernard Robinson is survived by his widow, the artist and Hammer film mask maker, Margaret Robinson. ==Selected filmography== * The Night Won't Talk (1952) ==References== Category:1912 births Category:1970 deaths Category:British film designers Category:Film people from Liverpool ","title":"Bernard Robinson (production designer)"},{"id":"2581172","text":"North Narrabeen is a suburb in northern Sydney, New South Wales, Australia 25 kilometres north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Northern Beaches Council. North Narrabeen is part of the Northern Beaches region. North Narrabeen lies on the northern shores of Narrabeen lagoon, bounded by Warriewood to the north, Elanora Heights to the west and extends east to the ocean at Narrabeen Head. Narrabeen is opposite on the southern shore of the lagoon. The northern section of Narrabeen Beach is known as North Narrabeen Beach. This ocean beach, together with the North Narrabeen Surf Lifesaving Club, are to the south of the lagoon in the suburb of Narrabeen. ==History== The first land grants were made to John Lees (40 acres), Philip Schaffer, (50 acres), and James Wheeler, (80 acres), along the south bank of Mullet Creek. Alex Macdonald was granted at the beach in 1815 and west of this land JT Collins had by 1857. During the nineteenth century travellers had to ford the lake until the 1880s when the first bridge opened. A second bridge at the mouth of the lagoon in Ocean Street was built in 1925. The extension of tram services to Narrabeen in 1913 provided easier transport, and the whole area around the lake became popular for holidays and camping. A large camping ground became established on the north shore of the lagoon. In 1946 the Wakehurst Parkway was opened to North Narrabeen connecting the whole Pittwater area directly to Frenchs Forest and Seaforth. Prior to the Second World War, the German Labour Front operated a cottage at Deep Creek to host Nazi Party meetings, as well as more relaxed events for German sailors, officers and other passing Germany dignitaries such as Felix von Luckner. There were rumours that that the camp was used to collect intelligence, but a post-War Defence Department investigation failed to find any evidence of espionage activity. It was also rumoured that sailors expressing anti-Nazi sentiments were taken to the camp to be flogged. Several rocks in the area are engraved with swastikas, eagles and the names of German ships, presumably made by the German visitors. ==Population== In the 2016 Census, there were 5,852 people in North Narrabeen. 73.8% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were England 6.9% and New Zealand 1.7%. 85.9% of people only spoke English at home.

The name Curl Curl Lagoon was originally applied to Manly Lagoon, which empties into the ocean at Queenscliff, and the current Curl Curl Lagoon was named Harbord Lagoon. This was a result of the land grant of 'Harbord' originally being much larger than the suburb that later bore this name.

The tower was built by and is named for Henry Clay Frick, an industrialist coke producer who created a portfolio of commercial buildings in Pittsburgh. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The tower was built directly adjacent to a building owned by his business partner and rival Andrew Carnegie, on the site of Saint Peter Episcopal Church. Frick, who feuded with Carnegie after they split as business associates, had the building designed to be taller than Carnegie's in order to encompass it in constant shadow.\\"The World's Work: A History of Our Time\\", Volume 14, by Walter Hines Page & Arthur Wilson Page, page 8856. The Frick Building was opened on March 15, 1902 and originally had twenty floors. It was the tallest building in the city at that time.\\"The Spectator and the Topographical City\\", by Martin Aurand, page 38. A leveling of the surrounding landscape that was completed in 1912 caused the basement to become the entrance, so some sources credit the building with twenty-one stories. It rises 330 feet (101 m) above Downtown Pittsburgh. Its address is 437 Grant Street, and is also accessible from Forbes and Fifth Avenues. The building's architect was Daniel H. Burnham of D.H. Burnham & Company, Chicago.City of Pittsburgh website. The top floor, which was reserved for The Union Club of Pittsburgh, includes a balcony around the perimeter of the building, a high, handcrafted ceiling, and heavy, elaborate brass door fixtures. Originally, H.C. Frick used it as his personal office and as a meeting place and social club for wealthy industrialists. On the 19th floor was Frick's personal shower. At the time, no other shower had been built that high above ground level, because water could not easily be pumped that high with the technology of the time. The shower, non-functioning, still exists on the 19th floor today. Fittingly for a building created for a man who vowed to be a millionaire by age thirty, the lobby features an elegant stained-glass window by John LaFarge, depicting \\"Fortune and Her Wheel\\" (1902).Emporis Corporation description of the Frick Building. The two bronze sentinel lions (1904) in the lobby were created by sculptor Alexander Proctor. A bust of Frick by sculptor Malvina Hoffman (1923) is displayed in the rear lobby, which extends from Forbes to Fifth Avenue. For a time, the building was home to the headquarters for Frick's family whiskey business, Old Overholt. The headquarters oversaw a network of sales offices around the United States. ==References== ==Further reading== * * Glenn A.

The discipline requires panels of human assessors, on whom the products are tested, and recording the responses made by them. By applying statistical techniques to the results it is possible to make inferences and insights about the products under test. Most large consumer goods companies have departments dedicated to sensory analysis. Sensory analysis can mainly be broken down into three sub-sections: * Analytical testing (dealing with objective facts about products) * Affective testing (dealing with subjective facts such as preferences) * Perception (the biochemical and psychological aspects of sensation) == Analytical testing == This type of testing is concerned with obtaining objective facts about products. This could range from basic discrimination testing (e.g. Do two or more products differ from each other?) to descriptive analysis (e.g. What are the characteristics of two or more products?). The type of panel required for this type of testing would normally be a trained panel. There are several types of sensory tests. The most classic is the sensory profile. In this test, each taster describes each product by means of a questionnaire. The questionnaire includes a list of descriptors (e.g., bitterness, acidity, etc.). The taster rates each descriptor for each product depending on the intensity of the descriptor he perceives in the product (e.g., 0 = very weak to 10 = very strong). In the method of Free choice profiling, each taster builds his own questionnaire. Another family of methods is known as holistic as they are focused on the overall appearance of the product. This is the case of the categorization and the napping. == Affective testing == Also known as consumer testing, this type of testing is concerned with obtaining subjective data, or how well products are likely to be accepted. Usually large (50 or more) panels of untrained personnel are recruited for this type of testing, although smaller focus groups can be utilised to gain insights into products. The range of testing can vary from simple comparative testing (e.g. Which do you prefer, A or B?) to structured questioning regarding the magnitude of acceptance of individual characteristics (e.g. Please rate the \\"fruity aroma\\": dislikeneitherlike). ==See also== *European Sensory Network *Food Quality and Preference *Journal of Sensory Studies *Pangborn Sensory Science Symposium == Notes and references == == Bibliography == * ASTM MNL14 The Role of Sensory Analysis in Quality Control, 1992 * ISO 16820 Sensory Analysis - Methodology - Sequential Analysis * ISO 5495 Sensory Analysis - Methodology - Paired Comparisons * ISO 13302 Sensory Analysis - Methods for assessing modifications to the flavour of foodstuffs due to packaging * Sensory Evaluation Techniques- Morten C.

Extra breasts may appear with or without nipples or areolae. It is a condition and a form of atavism which is most prevalent in male humans, and often goes untreated as it is mostly harmless. In recent years, many affected women have had a plastic surgery operation to remove the additional breasts, for purely aesthetic reasons. A related condition, in which extra nipples form, is called \\"supernumerary nipple\\" or \\"polythelia\\". ==Presentation== In some cases, the accessory breast may not be visible at the surface. In these cases, it may be possible to distinguish their appearance from normal breast tissue with MRI. In other cases, accessory breasts have been known to lactate, as illustrated in a woodcut showing a child nursing at ectopic breast tissue on the lateral thigh. There is some evidence that the condition may be more common in Native American populations. ==Cause== Polymastia typically occurs in the womb during the development. During normal development, breast tissue will develop along the milk line, and additional tissue will disintegrate and be absorbed into the body.

While popular belief has it that the term was first referenced by the 1st Sgt TOW Co. 3rd Tank Battalion 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade (Task Force Ripper) prior to deployment of Operation Desert Shield from MCAGCC 29 Palms, Ca. on August 15, 1990. \\"Marines, My platoon commander in Nam used to tell us 'Semper Gumby, Always Flexible'.\\" The 3rd Battalion, 11th Marines has \\"always flexible\\" as part of their official motto. Semper Gumby is also a common phrase used in the field of emergency management. ==References== * ==External links== * * Category:Military mottos Category:United States Marine Corps lore and symbols Category:Dog Latin words and phrases ","title":"Semper Gumby"},{"id":"2581239","text":"Kevin Dallas Martin Jr. (born February 1, 1983) is an American retired professional basketball player who played 12 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for Western Carolina University, where in his junior year, he averaged 24.9 points per game, which ranked second in the nation. After three years at Western Carolina, he entered the 2004 NBA draft and was selected with the 26th overall pick by the Sacramento Kings. ==Early life== Martin was born in Zanesville, Ohio, to Kevin Sr. and Marilyn Martin. He grew up idolizing Michael Jordan. He played for Zanesville High School and was fourth in the voting for Ohio Mr. Basketball as a Senior, finishing behind the first Sophomore winner LeBron James. ==College career== He received a full scholarship to Western Carolina University, where he majored in sports management. On November 22, 2002, Martin scored a college career-high 46 points in a loss against Coastal Carolina. On November 21, 2003, Martin scored 44 points in a loss against Georgia. He ranks fourth all-time on Western Carolina's scoring list with 1,838 points. Martin averaged 23.3 points, 4.5 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game during his three years in college. ==Professional career== Martin was a standout while at Western Carolina. Due to his success, he was selected by the Sacramento Kings with the 26th overall pick in the 2004 NBA draft. ===Sacramento Kings (2004–2010)=== Martin during his tenure with the Kings In the 2004–05 season, Martin averaged 2.9 points, 1.3 rebounds and 0.5 assists per game, and played sparingly, averaging just 10 minutes a game. Martin showed much improvement the following year, averaging 10.8 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 1.3 assists. Martin also started from time to time during the 2005–06 season in part by the injury of Bonzi Wells. This included a start at small forward due to Ron Artest being suspended for Game Two of the team's first-round playoff series against the San Antonio Spurs following a flagrant foul (elbow to the head) on Manu Ginóbili. He is best known in that series for making the game winning buzzer beater in Game 3 in Sacramento that gave the Kings a 1–2 series against the Spurs. His shot was also over the San Antonio Spurs' Tim Duncan. When interviewed on a segment by TNT during a game, Martin credited Doug Christie for helping him learn how to defend in the NBA. Likewise, Martin also credited Cuttino Mobley for helping him with his shooting. Martin played behind both guards during their tenure with the Kings. In the general managers' survey at the start of the 2006–07 NBA season, Martin tied for second as the player most likely to have a breakout campaign, behind the Orlando Magic's Dwight Howard. During the 2006–07 season, Kevin Martin proved himself to be among the top scorers in the NBA, averaging 20.2 points per game, while averaging 4.3 rebounds and 2.2 assists, all career highs. He is also one of the best shooters in the league with a 47.3% shooting percentage from the field and 38.1% from beyond the three-point arc (along with 84.4% FT shooting). Kevin finished second to Monta Ellis in the NBA Most Improved Player Award. Ellis edged Martin by three points in the closest voting in the award's history. On March 17, 2007, Martin led the Kings to a 95–83 road win over the Orlando Magic and joined Nate Archibald as the only other player in NBA history to score at least 20 points in a game with only one field goal made. Martin tallied 20 points on 1-8 FG from the field (1–1 3pt) while knocking down 17-20 FT from the foul line. On August 28, 2007, the Sacramento Kings and Martin agreed to a 5-year, $55 million deal. Martin got off to a fast start to the NBA season, while in the first 15 games was the NBA's leading scorer with 29.6 PPG. Martin finished the season 6th in the NBA in scoring at 23.7 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 2.1 APG and averaging 45% from the court and 40% from three-point range. However, he missed 17 games due to a groin injury. Also during the year, on March 7, 2008, Martin scored 48 points in a loss against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Martin became the leader of the team following the Ron Artest trade during the offseason. He started the season strong, however he suffered an ankle injury which kept him out 15 games. He returned, but re-aggravated his injury shortly thereafter. After returning again, he helped the Kings snap a 6-game losing streak. Martin averaged 24.6 points per game during the remainder of the season, including an overtime loss on April 1, 2009, against the Golden State Warriors, in which he scored a career-high 50 points and became the first King to score 50-plus since Chris Webber in 2001. On November 2, 2009, Martin scored 48 points including 7–10 from three-point range to lead the Kings to an overtime victory over the Memphis Grizzlies. ===Houston Rockets (2010–2012)=== Martin was traded during the 2009–10 season to the Houston Rockets on February 18, 2010, as part of a three-way trade including the New York Knicks and the Sacramento Kings. In his debut as a Rocket, Martin scored just 3–16 from the field, but 8–9 from the line, ending the game with 14 points, in a 125–115 loss to the Indiana Pacers. On April 12, in his first game back in Sacramento's Arco Arena, Martin scored 39 points, scoring 11 of 20, making all 16 of his foul shot attempts. On December 11, 2010, Martin scored 40 points in a 110–95 win against the Cleveland Cavaliers and went on to score a season-high 45 points in a loss against the Portland Trail Blazers on January 5, 2011. By the end of the season he averaged 23.5 points per game in 32 minutes per game. Martin shot .383 at the three-point line, and he was also near .900 from free throw range. Martin averaged 7.4 made free throws per game, second in the NBA to only Kevin Durant. After commissioner David Stern, acting as owner of the New Orleans Hornets at the time, vetoed a three-team deal involving the Rockets and the Los Angeles Lakers that would have sent Martin, Luis Scola, Goran Dragić, and Lamar Odom to New Orleans, he stayed with Houston for the lockout-shortened season. Martin suffered a shoulder injury on February 2. He tried to play through the injury but ended up re-aggravating the injury when he ran into a screen against the Cleveland Cavaliers on March 11. An MRI revealed a labral tear in his right shoulder, and he missed the rest of the season. With new rules regarding foul calls, in addition to playing injured, Martin's numbers dropped, averaging just 17.1 points per game, the worst in his career as a full-time starter. While he was still able to make a high percentage of his free throws, he only got to the line about half as often as the previous season. ===Oklahoma City Thunder (2012–2013)=== On October 27, 2012, Martin was traded along with Jeremy Lamb and three future draft picks to the Oklahoma City Thunder for James Harden, Daequan Cook, Lazar Hayward, and Cole Aldrich. In game six of the Western Conference Quarterfinals, Martin scored 25 points in a 103–94 win, as the Thunder eliminated his former team the Houston Rockets. ===Minnesota Timberwolves (2013–2016)=== On July 2, 2013, it was reported Martin had agreed to sign a four-year, $28 million contract with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Martin reportedly also received interest from the Oklahoma City Thunder, New Orleans Pelicans, and Milwaukee Bucks that sent the rights to Szymon Szewczyk to Oklahoma City and Luke Ridnour to Milwaukee. On July 11, 2013, he was officially acquired by the Timberwolves as part of a three-team trade involving the Thunder and the Bucks. On November 3, 2013, Martin scored 30 points, including 5–5 three-pointers as the Timberwolves defeated the New York Knicks. On November 25, 2014, Martin was sidelined for six to eight weeks after undergoing surgery to repair a fracture in his right wrist. On March 1, 2016, Martin was waived by the Timberwolves in a buyout agreement. ===San Antonio Spurs (2016)=== On March 9, 2016, Martin signed with the San Antonio Spurs. His best effort as a Spur came on April 8, 2016, when he scored 17 points against the Denver Nuggets. Martin's final appearance came on May 12, 2016, in the Spurs' loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 6 of the Western Conference semi-finals; he recorded two rebounds in just under six minutes off the bench. ===Retirement=== On November 24, 2016, Martin announced his retirement from the NBA. ==Player profile== Martin attacking the rim during a game in 2014. Standing at six feet, seven inches tall and weighing in at 199 pounds, Martin played the shooting guard position. With a career points-per-game average of 17.4, he established himself as one of the most efficient scorers in the NBA. Despite his unorthodox shooting stroke and skinny frame, he made significant contributions offensively. He was also known for his quickness. Martin went to the free throw line frequently and shot a great percentage; he led the NBA in free throws made in 2010–11. He was considered an average defender who had good awareness but lacked strength. In a 2010 interview, Reggie Miller was asked which NBA players reminded him of his own playing style. Miller responded: \\"Game-wise I would say Richard Hamilton and Kevin Martin. Thin, great coming off screens, can knock down treys.\\" ==NBA career statistics== ===Regular season=== -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Sacramento  45  0  10.1  .385  .200  .655  1.3  .5  .4  .1  2.9 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Sacramento  72  41  26.6  .480  .369  .847  3.6  1.3  .8  .1  10.8 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Sacramento  80  80  35.2  .473  .381  .844  4.3  2.2  1.2  .1  20.2 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Sacramento  61  57  36.3  .456  .402  .869  4.5  2.1  1.0  .1  23.7 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Sacramento  51  46  38.2  .420  .415  .867  3.6  2.7  1.2  .2 24.6 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Sacramento  22  21  35.2  .398  .355  .819  4.3  2.6  1.0  .2  19.8 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Houston  24  22  35.8  .435  .310  .924  2.9  2.3  1.0  .1  21.3 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Houston  80  80  32.5  .436  .383  .888  3.2  2.5  1.0  .2  23.5 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Houston  40  40  31.6  .413  .347  .894  2.7  2.8  .7  .1  17.1 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Oklahoma City  77  0  27.7  .450  .426  .890  2.3  1.4  .9  .1  14.0 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Minnesota  68  68  32.0  .430  .387  .891  3.0  1.8  1.0  .1  19.1 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Minnesota  39  36  33.4  .427  .393  .881  3.6  2.3  .8  .0  20.0 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Minnesota  39  12  21.4  .377  .369  .880  2.1  1.2  .4  .0  10.6 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" San Antonio  16  1  16.3  .353  .333  .933  1.8  .8  .6  .1  6.2 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Career  714  504  30.2  .437  .384  .870  3.2  1.9  .9  .1  17.4 ===Playoffs=== -  align=\\"left\\"  2006  align=\\"left\\"  Sacramento  6  1  32.8  .407  .316  1.000  5.0  .5  .5  .3  13.2 -  align=\\"left\\"  2013  align=\\"left\\"  Oklahoma City  11  0  29.4  .380  .370  .907  3.1  1.3  .6  .3  14.0 -  align=\\"left\\"  2016  align=\\"left\\"  San Antonio  5  0  9.8  .400  .500  .667  .8  .6  .2  .0  4.4 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  Career  22  1  25.9  .389  .370  .933  3.1  .9  .5  .2  11.6 ==Post-playing career== On October 1, 2019, the Brisbane Bullets of the National Basketball League (NBL) announced their new ownership group, which included Martin. ==Personal life== In 2007, Martin traveled to Johannesburg, South Africa to participate in the Basketball Without Borders Program and Habitat for Humanity.

Narwee is located 18 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district and is part of the St George area. Narwee is in local government areas of City of Canterbury-Bankstown and Georges River Council. The postcode is 2209, which it shares with neighbouring Beverly Hills. The main street of Narwee is Broadarrow Road, which runs from King Georges Road in Beverly Hills to just past Bonds Road in Riverwood. Broadarrow Road is also the boundary line between the southern part of the City of Canterbury- Bankstown and the northern part of the Georges River Council areas. ==History== Narwee is an Aboriginal word meaning \\"sun\\", an appropriate name for an area once called 'Sunning Hill Farm'.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 184 The language and dialect it was derived from is unclear. A number of Sydney suburbs developed during the 1930s have similar allegedly Aboriginal names, the origins of which are uncertain, including nearby Panania, and Jannali. Jannali supposedly means \\"moon\\" and was apparently named at the same time as Narwee, as a \\"sister suburb\\". The name Narwee was adopted when the railway station opened on 21 December 1931. People living there at the time were mostly poultry farmers and market gardeners, and a city florist had a large garden west of the railway station. After the railway came through, people bought up land for residences. Little building was done during the Depression and World War II, but the suburb grew rapidly in the 1950s, when the area was settled by young families. The post office opened in 1948. Narwee Primary School is built on land given in 1809, to Richard Podmore, a free settler, who came to New South Wales as a soldier in the N.S.W. Corps in 1792, on the ship \\"Pitt\\". Land between today's Penshurst Road and King Georges Road belonged to Richard Tuckwell, another soldier from the same Company. At the time of the land, the area was covered with a very thick ironbark forest. Tuckwell and Podmore sold their grants to Patrick Moore and Robert Gardner, both ex-convicts, in 1819 and 1820, and \\"Bob the Gardener\\", as he was known, began to clear trees and develop a farm on Podmore's grant, which he called \\"Sunning Hill Farm\\". The property was later extended to cover Emery's grant next door. This was farmed by Gardner's adopted son, Thomas Gardner Whitehall. At that stage there were very few farms in the district. Men earned a living by cutting down the trees and selling the logs for firewood and timber to build houses and boats. Narwee did not exist as a locality; it was called \\"Bob the Gardner's Farm\\", and there were so few people living in the area that bushrangers could easily hide for weeks in the forest without being discovered.History of Narwee www.wiki.jeremymacpherson.net ==Commercial area== The main shopping strip is located in Broad Arrow Road parallel with and adjacent to Narwee railway station. Like many small suburbs, Narwee was formerly served by two banks (Westpac and Commonwealth) and many small shops. Both banks have now closed, although the post office remains. Narwee Hotel is located just 2 mins from Narwee train station ==Transport== Hannans Road subway, the main access to Narwee railway station Narwee railway station is on the Airport & South Line of the Sydney Trains network, with Riverwood to the west and Beverly Hills to the east. For details of bus services see Narwee railway station. ==Churches== The largest church in the area is Narwee Baptist Church.Bringing the hope of Jesus to our local community and the world Narwee Baptist Church ==Schools== Narwee has a public school and once had a high school. Narwee High School was located at the suburb's highest point but closed in 2001. It has been redeveloped into a complex of residential houses. ==Population== Autumn in the residential area of Narwee, New South Wales According to the , there were 4,956 people usually resident in Narwee. 43.7% stated they were born in Australia with the top overseas countries of birth being China (15.1%), Hong Kong (4.0%), Indonesia (2.0%), Lebanon (1.8%) and Greece (1.8%). English was stated as the only language spoken at home by 35.0% of residents and the most common other languages spoken were Cantonese 15.1%, Mandarin 11.5% and Arabic 4.9%. The most common responses for religious affiliation were Catholic (21.4%), no religion (20.9%) Anglican (8.7%), Buddhist (8.4%), and Orthodox (7.2%). ==References== Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:Georges River Council Category:City of Canterbury-Bankstown ","title":"Narwee, New South Wales"},{"id":"2581251","text":"Clive Robertson Caldwell, (28 July 1911 – 5 August 1994) was the leading Australian air ace of World War II. He is officially credited with shooting down 28.5 enemy aircraft in over 300 operational sorties, including an ace in a day. In addition to his official score, he has been ascribed six probables and 15 damaged.Stephens 2006, pp. 81–83.Watson 2005, p. 4. Caldwell flew Curtiss P-40 Tomahawks and Kittyhawks in the North African Campaign and Supermarine Spitfires in the South West Pacific Theatre. He was the highest- scoring P-40 pilot from any air force and the highest-scoring Allied pilot in North Africa.Alexander 2006, p. 85. Caldwell also commanded a Royal Air Force (RAF) squadron and two Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) wings. His military service ended in controversy, when he resigned in protest at the misuse of Australian First Tactical Air Force's fighter units and was later court martialed and convicted for trading liquor. ==Early life== Caldwell was born in the Sydney suburb of Lewisham, and educated at Albion Park School, Sydney Grammar School and Trinity Grammar School. He was at Sydney Grammar School from June 1924 until May 1927, but did not complete his Leaving Certificate there (he rowed in the 4th IV and was a member of the Games Committee). He learned to fly in 1938 with the Aero Club of New South Wales. When World War II broke out, he joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), with the intention of becoming a fighter pilot. As he was over the age limit for fighter training, Caldwell persuaded a pharmacist friend to alter the details on his birth certificate.Alexander 2006, p. 8.Watson 2005, pp. 21–22. He was accepted by the RAAF and joined the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS; also known as the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan and similar names). ==World War II== ===Middle East and North Africa=== Caldwell posing beside his Supermarine Spitfire. Caldwell's first, brief combat posting was a British Hurricane unit, No. 73 Squadron, Royal Air Force, in the early stages of the North African campaign. He had gained only a few operational hours when he was transferred to No. 250 Squadron RAF as it converted to the new P-40 Tomahawk, one of the first units in the world to operate P-40s. According to some accounts,Alexander 2006, p. 25. on 6 June 1941, Caldwell as Flying Officer Jack Hamlyn's wingman, was involved in the P-40's first ever kill, of an Italian CANT Z.1007 bomber, over Egypt. However, the claim was not officially recognised. (Hamlyn and Sergeant Tom Paxton scored the first official kill two days later, another CANT.) Soon afterwards, Caldwell served with the squadron over Syria and Lebanon. After struggling to acquire the skill of gunnery deflection, Caldwell developed a training technique, known as \\"shadow shooting\\", in which he fired at the shadow of his own aircraft on the desert surface. This was later widely adopted by the Desert Air Force. The squadron returned to North Africa. On 26 June 1941, while escorting bombers attacking Gazala, Libya, Caldwell destroyed an aircraft in air-to-air combat for the first time, during his 30th sortie.Alexander 2006, pp. 28, 32, 230. He downed a German Messerschmitt Bf 109E, piloted by Leutnant Heinz Schmidt of I gruppe, Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27—Fighter Wing 27), over Capuzzo, he followed this claim with a 'half share' of a Bf 110 on III./ZG 26 and 2 Ju 87s of II./Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 (StG 2—Dive Bomber Wing 2) on 30 June.Shores and Williams 1994, pp. 162–163. On 4 July 1941, Caldwell saw a German pilot shoot and kill a close friend, Pilot Officer Donald Munro, who was descending to the ground in a parachute.Alexander 2006, p. 28. This was a controversial practice, but was nevertheless common among some German and Allied pilots. One biographer, Kristin Alexander, suggests that it may have caused Caldwell's attitude to harden significantly. Months later, press officers and journalists popularised Caldwell's nickname of \\"Killer\\", which he disliked. One reason for the nickname was that he too shot enemy airmen after they parachuted out of aircraft. Caldwell commented many years later: \\"... there was no blood lust or anything about it like that. It was just a matter of not wanting them back to have another go at us. I never shot any who landed where they could be taken prisoner.\\" (In later life, Caldwell said that his thoughts often turned to one Japanese airman or passenger, who survived Caldwell's last aerial victory but could not be rescued.)Alexander 2006, p. 150. A more commonly cited reason for the nickname was his habit of using up ammunition left over at the end of sorties, to shoot up enemy troop convoys and vehicles.Alexander 2006, pp. xviii–xxii. During his war service, Caldwell wrote in a notebook: \\"it's your life or theirs. This is war.\\" While flying to his base alone, over northwest Egypt on 29 August 1941, Caldwell was attacked by two Bf 109s, in a simultaneous approach at right angles. His attackers included one of Germany's most famous aces, Leutnant Werner Schröer, also of JG 27, in a Bf 109E-7. Caldwell sustained three separate wounds from ammunition fragments and or shrapnel. His Tomahawk was hit by more than 100 7.9 mm bullets and five 20 mm cannon shells, but he shot down Schröer's wingman, and heavily damaged Schröer's \\"Black 8\\", causing Schröer to disengage.Dragicevic, George. \\"Clive 'Killer Caldwell: Stuka party.\\" WWII Ace Stories. Retrieved 7 March 2006. On 23 November, Caldwell shot down an Experte, Hauptmann Wolfgang Lippert, Gruppenkommandeur (Group Commander) of II./JG 27, who bailed out. Lippert had struck the stabiliser and following capture had his legs amputated but 10 days later, a gangrene infection set in and he died on 3 December.Weal 1994, p. 72.Weal 1994, p. 90. For this action, Caldwell was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Caldwell claimed five Junkers Ju 87 (Stuka) dive bombers in a matter of minutes on 5 December. For this he was awarded a Bar to his DFC.Odgers 1984, p. 83. His report of that action reads: The citations for both the original DFC and the Bar were published in the same issue of the London Gazette, a supplement to that of 23 December 1944, dated 26 December 1944. The first citation described Caldwell as continuing to \\"take his toll of enemy aircraft\\" and that \\"he personally shot down 5 of the enemy's aircraft bringing his total victories to 12.\\" The second that he \\"has performed splendid work in the Middle East operations\\", \\"shown dogged determination and high devotion to duty which have proved an inspiration to his fellow pilots\\", and that after receiving \\"wounds on his face, arms and legs...he courageously returned to the attack and shot down one of the hostile aircraft.\\" On 24 December 1941, Caldwell was involved in an engagement which mortally wounded another Luftwaffe ace, Hpt. Erbo Graf von Kageneck (credited with 69 air victories) of III./JG 27. Caldwell only claimed a \\"damaged\\" at the time, but postwar sources have attributed him with the kill.Alexander 2006, pp. 224–228. Note: Kageneck's brother and biographer, August von Kageneck, who later corresponded with Caldwell, was among those who held this theory. In January 1942, Caldwell was promoted to squadron leader and given command of No. 112 Squadron RAF, becoming the first EATS graduate to command a British squadron.Brown 2000, p. 78. 112 Sqn at that time included several Polish aviators, and this was why Caldwell was later awarded the Polish Krzyż Walecznych (KW; \\"Cross of Valour\\"). Caldwell scored another striking victory in February 1942, while leading a formation of 11 Kittyhawks from 112 Sqn and 3 Sqn. Over Gazala, he sighted a schwarm of Bf 109Fs flying some 2,000 ft higher. Caldwell immediately nosed into a shallow dive, applied maximum power and boost, then pulled his Kittyhawk up into a vertical climb. With his P-40 \\"hanging from its propeller,\\" he fired a burst at a Bf 109 flown by Leutnant Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt of I./JG 27, who was lagging behind the others. Stahlschmidt's fighter \\"shuddered like a carpet being whacked with a beater\\" before spinning out of control. Although the Kittyhawk pilots thought that the Bf 109 had crashed inside Allied lines, Stahlschmidt was able to crash-land in friendly territory.Pentland 1974, p. 9. When Caldwell left the theatre later that year, the commander of air operations in North Africa and the Middle East, Air Vice Marshal Arthur Tedder described him as: \\"[a]n excellent leader and a first class shot\\". Caldwell claimed 22 victories while in North Africa flying P-40s, including ten Bf 109s and two Macchi C.202s. He had flown some 550 hours in over 300 operational sorties. Test Pilot Herbert O. Fisher shakes hands with Curtiss-Wright fire chief; note Caldwell in background, August 1942. While on a tour of the United States, Caldwell visited Curtiss-Wright in Buffalo, New York. On 6 August 1942, he was invited to come on an acceptance re-flight of a Curtiss C-46 Commando, the latest transport aircraft destined for overseas use. The aircraft was also loaded with Curtiss executives, and flown by Chief Production Test Pilot Herbert O. Fisher. The landing gear became stuck in a three-quarters down position, and after an extended eight- hour attempt to release the gear, Fisher calmly belly-landed the C-46. With the weight of the aircraft gently pushing the gear back into the wheel wells, a minimum of damage resulted. Caldwell had taken over as the co-pilot on the eight hours of circling over Buffalo, receiving certification that he was checked out on the C-46, under the tutelage of Fisher. Finishing his tour at Curtiss-Wright, Caldwell went on to visit the North American Aviation factory and was able to personally evaluate their new P-51 fighter, then in development.Alexander 2006, pp. 165–166. ===South West Pacific=== Caldwell with his Spitfire on Morotai in December 1944 During 1942, Australia came under increasing pressure from Japanese forces, and Caldwell was recalled by the RAAF, to serve as the wing leader of No. 1 (Fighter) Wing, comprising No. 54 Squadron RAF, No. 452 Squadron RAAF and No. 457 Squadron RAAF. The wing was equipped with the Supermarine Spitfire and in early 1943 was posted to Darwin, to defend it against Japanese air raids. Caldwell claimed two kills in his first interception sortie over Darwin, a Mitsubishi A6M Zero (also known by the Allied codename \\"Zeke\\") fighter and a Nakajima B5N \\"Kate\\" light bomber.RAAF Historical Section 1995, pp. 128–131.Alexander 2006, pp. 109–111. The Spitfire pilots found Japanese fighter pilots reluctant to engage Allied fighters over Australia, due to the distance from their bases in the Dutch East Indies. The wing initially suffered high losses, due to the inexperience of many of its pilots, and teething mechanical problems with their newly \\"tropicalised\\" Mark VC Spitfires. This was viewed with concern by high commanders, to such extent that the Allied air commander in the South West Pacific, Major General George Kenney, considered sending the wing to the New Guinea campaign, and returning US Fifth Air Force fighter units to Darwin. Caldwell scored what was to be his last aerial victory, a Mitsubishi Ki-46 \\"Dinah\\" of the 202nd Sentai, over the Arafura Sea on 17 August 1943. He claimed a total of 6.5 Japanese aircraft shot down. Later in 1943, Caldwell was posted to Mildura, to command No. 2 Operational Training Unit (2OTU). He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in November 1943. By 1944, with the Japanese forces retreating north, Caldwell was again posted to Darwin, this time commanding No. 80 (Fighter) Wing, equipped with the Spitfire Mark VIII. In April 1945, while serving at Morotai in the Dutch East Indies with the Australian First Tactical Air Force, as Officer Commanding No. 80 Wing, Caldwell played a leading part in the \\"Morotai Mutiny\\", in which several senior flyers resigned in protest at what they saw as the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to dangerous and strategically worthless ground attack missions. An investigation resulted in three senior officers being relieved of their commands, with Caldwell and the other \\"mutineers\\" cleared.Stephens 2006, pp. 123–124.Alexander 2004. Prior to the \\"mutiny\\", Caldwell had been charged over his involvement in an alcohol racket on Morotai, where liquor was flown in by RAAF aircraft and then sold to the sizeable US forces contingent in the locality.Shores 1999, p. 56. He was court martialled in January 1946 and reduced to the rank of Flight Lieutenant. Caldwell left the service in February.Watson 2005, pp. 228–239. ==Personal life== On 13 April 1940 Caldwell married Jean Main, whom he had known twelve years, a daughter of George and Mary Main of \\"Retreat\\" station, Illabo, New South Wales. George was well-known as chairman of the Australian Jockey Club. A pre-wedding reception was held at Cootamundra and the service at the tiny chapel at Dirnaseer, adjacent \\"Retreat\\". On his return to Australia, the couple lived in Illabo until at least 1947. ==Later years== After the war, Caldwell was involved as a purchasing agent obtaining surplus aircraft and other military equipment from the US Foreign Liquidation Commission in the Philippines. The aircraft and equipment were exported to Australia in 1946. After the successful conclusion of this venture, Caldwell joined a cloth import/export company in Sydney and shortly after became its managing director. He became a partner in 1953 and later served as chairman of the board. The firm, Clive Caldwell (Sales) Pty Ltd, achieved considerable success under Caldwell's direction and expanded through subsidiaries worldwide.Musciano 1966, p. 70.

It had a population of 501 in 2001; at the 2011 census this had increased to 529. It is situated southeast of the border with Nottinghamshire. The village is situated above sea level. The neighbouring hamlets of Wartnaby and Holwell form part of the civil parish of Ab Kettleby. ==History== A Roman mosaic and pavement were found beneath the present churchyard, indicating the presence of a villa. Ab Kettleby was first recorded in the Domesday Book as Chetelbi. Ab Kettleby is of Danish origin; its meaning is Ketil's homestead later differentiated from Eye Kettleby by Ab (a later holder of this land).Ekwall, E. (1940) The Concise Dictionary of English place-names; 2nd ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press; p. 261 The name Wartnaby is also of Danish origin, meaning Waerenoth's homestead. The name Holwell however is of Old English origin meaning spring or stream in a hollow. This may refer to the spring at Holwell Mouth which is close to the Six Hills to Eastwell road. St. James's Church has a Norman font, and a memorial to Everard Digby one of the Gunpowder plotters. The remains of the villa, and a ditch running from north to south underneath the nave have caused serious structural problems for the church. The church closed in 2006 due to its structural problems and, following the raising of over £250,000 for repairs, it re-opened in 2013. The church was mostly built in the 13th century but restored in 1852-3. The north aisle is Victorian. St Michael's Church, Wartnaby was built in the 13th century and restored in 1867-8. It has a double bellcote with a saddleback roof on the tower and medieval wall painting inside.Pevsner and Willamson Page419 === Iron ore === Iron ore was obtained in all three parts of the parish. ==== Holwell ==== Holwell was the most important centre. Iron ore was first quarried to the north of Holwell on the south side of the narrow part of Landyke Lane in 1875 and continued in various places to the north and east of the hamlet until 1930. From 1931 until 1943 iron ore was mined rather than quarried east of Brown's Hill. The mine was a drift mine and the tunnel emerged from the north side of the hill in 1943. Quarrying was resumed at that point and continued until 1962. The last quarrying took place close to the road to Scalford Hall. Quarrying was done by hand with the help of explosives at first. The first quarrying machine was a petrol paraffin digger introduced in 1930. The first diesel digger arrived in 1943. The ore was at first taken away by horse and cart, but the Holwell Iron Company built a standard-gauge mineral railway in 1877 which connected with the Midland Railway's Syston to Peterborough line west of Melton Mowbray. Most of this mineral railway was taken over and improved by the Midland in two stages: first as part of their Nottingham to Melton line and then as their Holwell branch (connecting with that line) in 1887. This was extended the same year northwards to Wycomb Junction on the Great Northern's Waltham branch. This branch transported the ore from Holwell as well as some of that from Eaton. The Holwell company built their own iron works close to the Holwell Branch which operated from 1881. The works was called Holwell Works because it was built by the Holwell Company but was actually at Asfordby Hill. The quarries and the mine fed the standard gauge line by means of narrow-gauge tramways. These were at first worked by gravity or horses, but diesel locomotives were introduced in 1933. The tramways were replaced by lorries in 1948. Part of the quarry area has been landscaped and returned to agriculture; part has been left and retained as a nature reserve. One entrance to the mine tunnel has been blocked; the other entrance only partly blocked to allow bats to roost in the mine. In 1986, the area above the mine carried warning notices that the land is liable to subsidence. The railway has been lifted. Brown's Hill Quarry - at Holwell showing entrance to drift mine. geograph.org.uk - 1183115 ==== Wartnaby ==== Iron ore was quarried to the east and west of Wartnaby, to the west of the A606 and to the north of the village on both sides of the Six Hills to Eastwell Road. Quarrying began in 1879 near to Stonepit House on the north side of the latter road. The last ore was obtained close to the A606 south of the crossroads in 1929. Quarrying always seems to have been done by hand with the help of explosives. No mechanical diggers were used. The ore was taken away by narrow gauge tramway to a tipping dock on the Midland Railway's Nottingham to Melton line to the north of the Old Dalby tunnel. From there it was taken by train to the Stanton Ironworks near Nottingham. The part of the tramway close to the tipping dock was a cable-operated incline, the loaded wagons going down the incline. The line from the quarries to the top of the incline was worked by horses at first but steam locomotives were introduced in 1880. The quarries were shallow but traces can be seen near to Stonepit House (marked now on OS maps as Berlea Farm). Elsewhere as a result of the quarrying the fields are at a lower level than the roads. However at one place the Six Hills Road was diverted onto land that had already been quarried and then the old course was quarried. Parts of the tramway's earthworks can still be seen. ==== Ab Kettleby ==== Quarrying took place at Ab Kettleby between 1892 and 1907. The quarries were to the north of the village: on either side of the lane to Holwell (which probably started first); in the triangle between the A606, the Six Hills to Eastwell road and the lane to Holwell Mouth from Ab Kettleby; and on the north side of the Six Hills to Eastwell road. Quarrying was done by hand with the aid of explosives and the ore was taken by narrow gauge tramway to a tipping dock at the Midland Railway Holwell Branch north of Potter Hill. From there the ore was taken by train to Holwell Iron Works at Asfordby Hill. The lower end of the tramway was a cable-worked incline. At the quarry end the line was probably worked by horses which were later replaced by steam locomotives. The gauge was, unusually, . The main sign of quarrying now is that some of the fields are at a lower level than the roads. In 1986 there was still an upturned quarry wagon at the site of the old tipping dock. ==Facilities and sites of interest== The parish has a primary school, a public house named after Sugarloaf Mountain, a community centre, a guest house, a 17th-century manor house, and medieval farmhouses and farm buildings. One of those farms was home to the racehorse Desert Orchid for several years. It also has a village duck pond next to a large horse-chestnut tree and megalithic spring. A public telephone box, once a common sight throughout the UK but now a protected building, has been released to the protection of Ab Kettleby's council. Within the boundaries of the village is a holy well. === Ab Kettleby Manor === Ab Kettleby Manor is an early 17th-century house in the village of Ab Kettleby, Leicstershire. Built of ironstone with a central brick chimney, the house is cruciform in plan. ==Gallery== File:Ab Kettleby, The Sugar Loaf.jpgThe Sugar Loaf File:Main Street Ab Kettleby.jpgHouses on Main Street File:St James the Greater church, Ab Kettleby-geograph.org.uk-2815176.jpgSt James's church File:Church of St Michael and All Angels, Wartnaby - geograph.org.uk - 212156.jpgSt Michael's church, Wartnaby ==References== ==External links== *GENUKI article *Ab Kettleby Bell Ringing Category:Civil parishes in Leicestershire Category:Villages in Leicestershire Category:Borough of Melton ","title":"Ab Kettleby"},{"id":"2581260","text":"The Meier & Frank Building is a fifteen-story, glazed terra cotta building located in downtown Portland, Oregon, across from the northeast corner of Pioneer Courthouse Square. The building is the former flagship store and headquarters building for the Meier & Frank department store chain, which was taken over by Macy's in 2006. In 2006–2007, the building's lower floors were remodeled into an updated Macy's department store, while the upper floors were renovated in 2008 into a luxury hotel known as The Nines. In 2016, Macy's announced that it planned to close the store in spring 2017, and the store closed in April 2017. The building site is a full block, bounded by SW Fifth and Sixth Avenues and Morrison and Alder Streets. The present building was constructed in stages, starting in 1909 with major expansions occurring in 1915 and 1932. It replaced an earlier Meier and Frank store built in 1898. ==History== The project was the first major commission for prolific Portland architect, A. E. Doyle. Although the original commission was an annex to the original building, Doyle took a trip to Chicago with the company's co-founder Sigmund Frank to survey department stores. Frank was very impressed with what he saw, and plans for the building changed into a full-block fully modern department store. Frank's death in 1910 ended those plans and resulted in the building's construction in piecemeal segments over several decades, which led to anomalous differences in which elevators and which stairways reached which floors. However, A.E. Doyle first used glazed terra-cotta in this building, resulting in later use of it in many other Portland structures by his and other firms. The building hosted the corporate headquarters of the Meier & Frank chain. After the acquisition of Meier and Frank by May Department Stores in 1966, the chain became a division which was based out of the former corporate offices. The interior of the building has been modernized over the years with few interior historic elements remaining. However, several notable exceptions to this were the Georgian Room restaurant and seasonal Santaland, both on the 10th floor (highest retail floor in the building). The historic Georgian Room had remained virtually unchanged for at least the last 50 years. Santaland, which closed after the 2005 Christmas season, was an annual holiday favorite for generations of Portland families. Santaland operated a \\"kiddie\\"-sized overhead monorail around the ceiling of Santaland; first installed in 1959,Chuang, Angie (December 25, 2004). \\"Santaland monorail may have made last round on 10th floor\\". The Oregonian, p. D1. it last operated during the 2005 holiday season. There was also a holiday model railroad layout and Santa Clauses. Pneumatic tubes were used throughout the store to convey messages and money from upper to lower floors and back again. The remnants of this system could still be found in some stairwells and back areas. The Meier & Frank Building featured the first escalator installation in Portland, and housed the company's own radio station. KFEC signed on the air October 19, 1922. The studio was on the 5th floor and was also used as the library and reading room for employees. The transmitter towers were atop the building. KFEC operated until March 22, 1929, when it was sold and moved to Yakima, Washington, which still operates today as KIT. terracotta. Until August 1962, the building at was the second tallest in Portland after the Public Service Building. The building has two primary lower levels and a third service level beneath these. The first lower level was used for retail space until the mid-1980s. The levels beneath that were used for storage and various seasonal needs. The bank of hand-controlled elevators originally operated by store employees was closed to the public with the construction of new automatic elevators, but were still used to transport merchandise into the 1990s out of public view. At its peak, the store housed everything from a pharmacy to a pet store. Actor Clark Gable worked in the store's tie department in 1922. Several delis and food vendors operated out of various levels. As demand for these services declined, the store changed focus. During the 1980s the store began to concentrate more on soft lines such as clothing, as well as small goods such as housewares. Several floors were modified to serve as corporate offices. Other floors were simply shut down and turned over to cold storage. The store was able to operate in this configuration until finally doomed by the development of the nearby Pioneer Place mall and increased competition from stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Portland Mall In 2005, the May Company was acquired by Federated Department Stores, corporate parent of Macy's and other chains. The Meier & Frank stores were renamed Macy's in September 2006. Already in late 2005, a $100 million renovation of the building began, and this was to include work to turn the top nine floors of the building into a 330-room luxury hotel called The Nines, a Starwood Luxury Collection Hotel. Renovation of the Meier & Frank store in the lower floors of the building began first, in late 2005, and was still under way when the store was rebranded in September 2006 as a Macy's (as were all other then-remaining Meier & Frank stores). Macy's later decided to temporarily close the store, in order to accelerate the remodeling work, and the temporary closure began in December 2006. The remodeled stored, named Macy's at Meier and Frank Square, reopened on October 26, 2007. The hotel opened in late summer 2008. In 2016, Macy's announced that it planned to close the store in spring 2017, because of declining sales. A clearance sale began in January, and the store closed permanently in April 2017. In March 2018, Japanese retailer Muji announced they would be taking over 15,000 square feet in the building to open their first store in the Pacific Northwest. ==Other historic buildings== Meier and Frank also owned and operated two other buildings in the downtown area, namely, the Delivery Depot and Warehouse, both of which are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Both structures have been transformed into other uses. On August 18, 2010, Vestas Wind Systems, a Danish wind turbine manufacturer, announced that it will lease the historic Meier & Frank Delivery Depot in the Pearl District. After renovations completed in 2012, the space now houses the company's U.S. headquarters. ==See also== *Architecture of Portland, Oregon *Departure Restaurant and Lounge *Urban Farmer ==References== ==External links== *Meier & Frank Building (Emporis) Category:Skyscrapers in Portland, Oregon Category:National Register of Historic Places in Portland, Oregon Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Oregon Category:1909 establishments in Oregon Category:A.

Narellan Vale is located 60 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Camden Council and is part of the Macarthur region. ==History== The area now known as Narellan Vale was probably originally home to the Tharawal people, based in the Illawarra region, although the Western Sydney-based Darug people and the Southern Highlands-based Gandangara people were also known to have inhabited the greater Camden area. Very early relations with British settlers were cordial but as farmers started clearing and fencing the land affecting food resources in the area, clashes between the groups arose until 1816 when a number of indigenous people were massacred and the remainder retreated from direct conflict with the settlers. In 1805, wool pioneer John Macarthur was granted 5,000 acres (20 km²) at Cowpastures (now Camden).

Haught was born on November 12, 1942 to Paul and Angela Haught. His wife is Evelyn. ==Academic Career and Systemic Theology== Haught graduated from St. Mary's Seminary and University in Baltimore in 1964 and subsequently received his PhD in theology from The Catholic University of America in Washington DC in 1968 (Dissertation: Foundations of the Hermeneutics of Eschatology).Templeton Foundation. Participant biography . Accessed 8 Dec. 2006 From 1969 to 2005 Haught taught in the Department of Theology at Georgetown University in Washington D.C., serving as theology department chair between 1990 and 1995. In addition, he has been a Landegger Distinguished Professor and Thomas Healey Distinguished Professor, and held the D’Angelo Chair in Humanities at St. John’s University (2008), and was visiting professor at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome (2010). === Inspiration and Influence === In his early 20s, John Haught started reading the works of the Jesuit priest and geologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. As an undergraduate student at St. Mary’s Seminary and University, Haught had majored in philosophy and completed graduate work in philosophical theology, though he was never ordained. While teaching science and religion at Georgetown University and writing books on the topic, he specialized in the areas of cosmology and biology. During his studies, he concluded that Thomistic metaphysics could not adequately contextualize the discoveries of evolutionary biology and Big Bang physics. As the intellectual backbone of his courses, he turned to science-friendly 20th century philosophers such as Alfred North Whitehead, Michael Polanyi, Bernard Lonergan, and Hans Jonas. His books Science and Religion: From Conflict to Conversation (1995) and more recently Science and Faith: a New Introduction (2012) reflect an approach developed over many years of teaching at Georgetown University. During the 1990s, he became increasingly involved in issues relating to evolution, especially because of their growing importance in the intellectual world and the claims by creationists and prominent evolutionists alike that Darwinian science and belief in God are irreconcilable. The American cultural warfare over the teaching of Intelligent Design led Haught to write such books as God After Darwin, Deeper than Darwin, and Making Sense of Evolution. These and other works have led to numerous lectures on theology and evolution nationally and internationally. In his works, John Haught argues that an open-minded search for intelligibility requires a plurality of distinct “horizons of inquiry,” allowing for the harmonious cohabitation of science (including evolutionary biology) and religious belief. Haught views science and religion as two different and noncompeting levels of explanation, asserting that \\"science and religion cannot logically stand in a competitive relationship with each other.\\" In 2005, Haught testified on behalf of the plaintiffs at the Harrisburg PA trial against the teaching of Intelligent Design in public schools. His testimony earned him the “Friend of Darwin” award from the National Center for Science Education. === Science and Religion === John Haught’s lectures and works focus on a vision of reality that provides room for both scientific inquiry and a biblical understanding of God. In Haught’s perspective, everything should be open to scientific study, including human intelligence, ethical aspiration, and religion. Haught posits that science is one of many avenues to providing a fruitful understanding of nature since there are distinct and noncompeting levels of explaining all natural phenomena. By allowing for different reading levels, one can avoid the conflation of science and religion whereby physics spills into metaphysics, or evolutionary biology into a whole worldview. According to Haught, a major obstacle to adopting a plurality of reading levels is the persistence of biblical literalism which erroneously looks to the Bible as a source of scientific truth. In his view, approaching ancient religious texts with modern scientific expectations is the source of unnecessary and anachronistic confusion that makes the Bible, and the biblically based faith traditions, seem incompatible with modern science. In works, such as God and the New Atheism, Haught aims to show that Daniel Dennett, Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, and Jerry Coyne have adopted the same misplaced biblical literalism as their creationist opponents. Haught disputes the contention of New Atheists that God is a quasi-scientific hypothesis now rendered obsolete by modern cosmology, geology, and evolutionary biology. Emphasizing that science and theology represent two distinct horizons for looking at the story of life and the universe, Haught argues in his various lectures and writings that “it is the mission of a theology of nature to integrate them into a synthetic vision wherein differences do not dissolve but instead contribute in distinct ways to the larger and longer human quest for meaning and truth.” Haught emphasizes that theology looks for levels of meaning and truth that scientific method is not wired to receive. “Theology has its own horizon of inquiry. It is grounded in a qualitatively distinct set of questions from those asked by scientists and ethicists. The data that give rise to distinctively theological questions include an easily recognizable set of beliefs and ethical commitments that do not show up within the horizon of scientific inquiry, but which every scientist must embrace in order to do science at all. *1. Belief (faith or trust) that the world, including the horizon of scientific inquiry, is intelligible. *2. Belief that truth is worth seeking. *3. Belief that honesty, humility, generosity, and openness in sharing one’s ideas and discoveries are unconditionally right (and hence that the pursuit of virtue is not irrelevant to successful scientific work.) *4. Belief that one’s own mind has the capacity to grasp intelligibility and to distinguish what is true from what is false.” === Recognition and awards === Haught was the winner of the 2002 Owen Garrigan Award in Science and Religion and the 2004 Sophia Award for Theological Excellence. In 2009, in recognition of his work on theology and science, Haught was awarded the degree of Doctor Honoris Causa by the University of Louvain and the Friend of Darwin Award from the National Center for Science Education. === Peer Evaluations === In the May 25 - June 1, 2015 issue of America: The National Catholic Review, Robert E. Lauder, Professor of Philosophy at St. John’s University, provided a review of John Haught’s works, including, What is God? How to Think About the Divine (1986), God After Darwin: A Theology of Evolution, and Mystery and Promise. Other expert evaluations of the works of John Haught include Carter Phipps, the author of Evolutionaries: Unlocking the Spiritual and Cultural Potential of Science’s Greatest Idea (2012). Phipps’ article, “A Theologian of Renewal”, won a Gold Folio award for editorial excellence.

Dover Area School District. He testified that the effect of the intelligent design policy adopted by the Dover School board would \\"be to compel public school science teachers to present their students in biology class information that is inherently religious, not scientific in nature.\\"Report of John F. Haught, PhD. Expert Witness Pre-Trial Statement for Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District. April 1, 2005. He also testified that materialism, the philosophy that only matter exists, is \\"a belief system, no less a belief system than is intelligent design. And as such, it has absolutely no place in the classroom, and teachers of evolution should not lead their students craftily or explicitly to ... feel that they have to embrace a materialistic world-view in order to make sense of evolution.\\"Transcript of Proceedings of Bench Trial.

These are common in Australia. The terms sole plate or sill plate are used for the members at the bottom of a wall at the foundation but are most often just called a sole or sill without the word plate. Other load bearing timbers use the term plate but are not in the wall such as crown plate, a purlin-like beam carried by crown posts in roof framing, and a purlin plate which supports common rafters. ==Platform framing== In platform framing there are three types of wall plates and are located at the top and bottom of a wall section, and the two hold the wall studs parallel and spaced at the correct interval. Each type continues in a piecewise fashion around the whole perimeter of the structure. * Sill plates -- a lower wall plate which is bolted or strapped securely to the top of a foundation wall or concrete slab.

In September 1956, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Radford indicated within the U.S. government that the military's intention was to introduce atomic weapons into Korea, which was agreed to by the United States National Security Council and President Eisenhower. However paragraph 13(d) of the Korean Armistice Agreement mandated that both sides could not introduce new types of weapons into Korea, so preventing the introduction of nuclear weapons and missiles. The U.S. decided to unilaterally abrogate paragraph 13(d), breaking the Armistice Agreement, despite concerns by United Nations allies. At a 21 June 1957 meeting of the Military Armistice Commission, the U.S. informed the North Korean representatives that the U.N. Command no longer considered itself bound by paragraph 13(d) of the armistice. In January 1958, nuclear-armed Honest John missiles and 280mm atomic cannons were deployed to South Korea, followed within a year by atomic demolition munitions and nuclear-armed Matador cruise missiles capable of reaching China and the Soviet Union. North Korea denounced the abrogation of paragraph 13(d) as an attempt to wreck the armistice agreement and turn Korea into a U.S. atomic warfare zone. It responded by digging massive underground fortifications resistant to nuclear attack, and forward deployment of its conventional forces so that the use of nuclear weapons against it would endanger South Korean and U.S. forces as well. In 1963, North Korea asked the Soviet Union for help in developing nuclear weapons, but was refused. China later, after its nuclear tests, similarly rejected North Korean requests for help with developing nuclear weapons. In North Korea, the departure of the People's Liberation Army in October 1958 allowed Kim Il-Sung to consolidate his power base and embark on the Chollima Movement of collectivised agriculture and industrialization to build a base for reunifying Korea by force. North Korea remained dependent on the Soviet Union for technology and on China for agricultural assistance. Following the war, South Korea remained one of the poorest countries in the world for over a decade. In 1960, its gross domestic product per capita was $79, lower than most Latin American and some sub-Saharan African countries. The April Revolution that forced President Syngman Rhee from office in April 1960 was followed by a brief period of democracy before a coup d'état led to General Park Chung-hee seizing power in May 1961. Despite the political turmoil, the South Korean economy continued to grow, led by the industrial sector. Rapid industrial growth started in the late 1960s, with gross domestic product per capita rising from $100 in 1964 to $1000 in 1977. On 10 December 1962, Kim proposed a new military strategy to the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, with increased emphasis placed on irregular warfare, agitation and propaganda, to be achieved by the end of the current Seven-Year Plan in 1967. In June 1965, President Park signed a treaty normalizing relations with Japan, which included payment of reparations and the making of soft loans from Japan and led to increased trade and investment between the two countries. In July 1966, South Korea and the United States signed a Status of Forces Agreement, establishing a more equal relationship between the two nations. With its growing economic strength and the security guarantee of the United States, the threat of a conventional invasion from the north seemed increasingly remote. Following the escalation of the Vietnam War with the deployment of ground combat troops in March 1965, South Korea sent the Capital Division and the 2nd Marine Brigade to South Vietnam in September 1965, followed by the White Horse Division in September 1966. The start of the hostilities can be traced to a speech given by North Korean leader Kim Il-sung on 5 October 1966, at the Workers' Party of Korea Conference, where the status quo of the 1953 Armistice Agreement was challenged. He apparently perceived that the division of effort by the South Korean military and the ever-growing escalation of the US commitment in Vietnam had created an environment where irregular warfare could succeed in a way conventional warfare could not. Kim believed that he could force a split between the U.S. and South Korea through armed provocations targeting U.S. forces that, together with other worldwide commitments and small wars, would force the U.S. to reassess or relinquish its commitment to South Korea, allowing North Korea to incite an insurgency in the South that would topple the Park administration. There were ongoing propaganda campaigns between the north and south, such as loudspeaker broadcasts across the DMZ at each other. Leafleting of North Korea had been resumed, such as Operation Jilli from 1964 to 1968 which delivered a few hundred million leaflets to the north. ==Military forces== ===North Korea=== In 1966, the Korean People's Army (KPA) deployed eight infantry divisions along the DMZ, backed by eight more infantry divisions, three motorized infantry divisions, a tank division and a collection of separate infantry and tank brigades and regiments. Its total armed forced personnel numbered 386,000. While strong, this conventional force was smaller than the South's ground forces of about 585,000, and it was unlikely that the North could deliver a knockout blow before the U.S. could deploy additional forces. The main unconventional warfare arm was the Reconnaissance Bureau of the Ministry of Defense under the operational control of the Liaison Department of the Workers' Party of Korea which included the 17th Foot Reconnaissance Brigade and the all-officer Unit 124 and 283rd Army Units. These units were all highly trained and indoctrinated, skilled in demolitions and small-unit tactics, they would usually operate in small teams of 2–12 men, lightly armed with either PPS submachine guns or AK-47s. The Reconnaissance Bureau also controlled the 23d Amphibious Brigade, which used specially made infiltration boats to operate along the South Korean coastline. The Reconnaissance Bureau could also use conventional KPA and Korean People's Navy forces to support the infiltration and exfiltration of its teams.{[rpCh1 Enemy/> In addition to the offensive irregular forces, North Korea also deployed several thousand operator-agitators to select, train, and supervise informants and guerrilla recruits, while others attempted to cause individual defections and unit dissatisfaction in the ROK military and generally undermine the morale of both the ROKs and the Americans. ===United States and South Korea=== The major U.S. ground combat units in Korea were the 2nd Infantry Division (2ID) and 7th Infantry Division (7ID), I Corps and 8th Army. 2ID stood with the 3rd Brigade manning 29.8 km of the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) essentially due north of Seoul on either side of Panmunjom, with another nine Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) Divisions manning the remaining 212.8 km of the DMZ. All U.S. and ROKA forces were under the unified operational control of United Nations Command (Korea) (who was also the commander United States Forces Korea), General Charles H. Bonesteel III. Both U.S. Army Divisions were seriously under strength as Vietnam had priority for manpower and equipment. Troops were equipped with M14 rifles rather than M16s, the only available tanks were older gasoline powered M48A2Cs, and there were a total of only 12 UH-1 Huey helicopters in South Korea seriously restricting the ability to hunt and engage infiltrators. Troops were generally draftees serving a 13-month tour, while experienced officers and NCOs preferred service in Vietnam to Korea. The ROK Divisions were well trained and highly motivated with many of the officers and NCOs veterans of the Korean War, but all their equipment dated back to that war; their standard rifle was still the M1 Garand. The main operational objective of the US and ROK Divisions was to defend against a conventional invasion from North Korea in a repeat of the attack of June 1950. While there were regular infiltrations into the South for intelligence-gathering, unconventional warfare was not seen as a particular threat and the troops were not generally trained or equipped for this role. No counter-guerilla units or village militias existed in South Korea in 1966 and infiltrators were variously hunted by the ROK Army, Police and the Korean Central Intelligence Agency with no unified control. In 1976, in now- declassified meeting minutes, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William Clements told Henry Kissinger that there had been 200 raids or incursions into North Korea from the south, though not by the U.S. military. Details of only a few of these incursions have become public, including raids by South Korean forces in 1967 that had sabotaged about 50 North Korean facilities. Up to 7,700 South Korean soldiers and agents infiltrated North Korea from the end of the Korean war until 1972, an estimated 5,300 of whom never made it back. The ground forces were supported by fighter-bombers of the USAF 314th Air Division and by the Republic of Korea Air Force. The seas around Korea were under the control of the United States Seventh Fleet and the Republic of Korea Navy. As with the Army, the war in Vietnam was the main focus of the USAF and the USN in the Pacific. ==Defense strategies== From October 1964 the North Koreans increased the infiltration of intelligence-gatherers and propagandists into the South. By October 1966, more than 30 South Korean soldiers and at least 10 civilians had been killed in clashes with North Korean infiltrators; however, no similar clashes had taken place along the U.S.-controlled section of the DMZ. In October 1966, South Korea staged a retaliatory attack without seeking the approval of General Bonesteel, causing tension between the U.S. command, which wished to avoid violations of the armistice, and the South Koreans, who were suffering ongoing losses.Bolger, Chapter 2 Following the first KPA attack on US forces in November 1966, General Bonesteel formed a working group to analyse the North Korean strategy and develop a counter-strategy to defeat it. Finding the existing U.S. Army tactical doctrines to be inapplicable to the situation they were facing, the working group developed its own doctrine to meet its operational needs. Three types of operations were identified: first to guard against infiltration across the DMZ; second was a similar naval effort along the coasts; and third was counterguerrilla operations in the interior. All three types of operations had to be accomplished without jeopardizing the conventional defense of South Korea or escalating the conflict from low-intensity to a full war.Bolger, Chapter 2 The Doctrinal Void ===Demilitarized Zone=== A South Korean DMZ Guard Post Starting in 1967 the UN Command developed a layered defense of the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The Armistice restricted fortification within the DMZ, where defences were limited to patrols and observation posts without heavy weapons. More aggressive patrolling of the DMZ was ordered with patrols going out for twenty-four hours, reconnoitring by day and establishing ambushes at night; most U.S. casualties occurred during these patrols. The observation posts were fortified with sandbags and machine-guns and recoilless rifles were frequently kept hidden there in breach of the Armistice. General Bonesteel obtained $30m in funding from the U.S. Army Combat Developments Command to create a DMZ test Barrier along the portion of the DMZ occupied by the 2ID and the ROKA 21st Infantry Division. Beyond the southern boundary or \\"south tape\\" of the DMZ, no defensive restrictions applied and a combined U.S.-Korean engineer force constructed an in-depth Barrier comprising a 3m tall chain-link fence, topped by triple strands of concertina wire and reinforced by interwoven saplings and steel engineer pickets, behind it a narrow, raked-sand path paralleled the fence to highlight footprints. Behind the sand strip was a 120m wide cleared kill zone in which mines and tanglefoot wire fronted a line of conventional defensive positions of interlocking machine guns and pre-registered mortar and artillery fire which dominated the kill zone. Observation towers stood at intervals along the trace to permit clear view of the open areas. Various electronics and sensors were tested on the Barrier similar to the McNamara Line in Vietnam, but with the exception of Starlight scopes they were largely ineffective. The Barrier could not prevent infiltration (it was estimated that the North Koreans could cut through the fence in 30–40 seconds), rather it was intended to slow movement and provide easy observation. Behind the Barrier were the quick-reaction forces of mechanized infantry, tanks and armored cavalry that would hunt down infiltrators. The rules of engagement were also loosened to allow the frontline troops to use artillery and mortar fire against known KPA elements in or south of the DMZ and against KPA firing from north of the Military Demarcation Line, although in practice this was only used sparingly. A new 4 monthly rotation scheme was introduced in October 1967 to ensure that each Battalion received only its fair share of time manning and patrolling the Barrier. 7ID sent one infantry battalion at a time to augment the 3rd Brigade, 2ID, this increased the defense to four Battalions on the line plus the quick-reaction forces.Bolger, Chapter 2 Anti-Infiltration: The Sea Approaches South Korea launched at least three retaliatory cross-border raids in late 1967 using small teams of North Korean defectors. The raids killed 33 KPA soldiers. ===Korean coastline=== Preventing infiltration at sea created an impossible challenge for the UN Command, which lacked suitable aircraft, ships, radar and communications. The ROK Navy possessed only 72 vessels to patrol over 7,000 kilometers of rugged coastline. Along the coasts, some 20,000 unarmed coastwatchers, sometimes supplemented by ROKA reservists, patrolled the beaches and when signs of landings were discovered these would be reported to the National Police and quick reaction forces would be deployed. Poor communications and a lack of helicopters meant that the quick reaction forces seldom arrived in time before the infiltrators dispersed in the Korean hinterland. ===Counterinsurgency operations=== During 1966 and into 1967, there was no coordinated counterinsurgency plan in South Korea. Infiltrations were dealt with on an ad hoc basis by the ROKA, National Police, Army counter-intelligence units and the KCIA usually depending on the estimate of the threat and whichever units happened to be nearby. President Park was reluctant to raise and arm a civilian militia as he did not fully trust the loyalty of the populace to his government. General Bonesteel regarded counterinsurgency as entirely an internal responsibility for the South Korean Government and while he provided some material support including his helicopters and several Special Forces A-Teams from the 1st Special Forces Group on Okinawa to train the ROKA and the newly formed Combat Police in counterinsurgency tactics, he declined to take responsibility for counterinsurgency operations. By late 1967 it was clear that the North Koreans were attempting to develop a full-scale insurgency in the South with strongholds in the Taebaek Mountains and around Jirisan mountain. President Park, in consultation with General Bonesteel, developed a counterinsurgency strategy in the form of Presidential Instruction #18. The instruction established a national coordinating council with clear chains of command for all classes of incidents ranging from individual agent sightings to province- level unrest. Eight (later ten) new ROKA counter-infiltration battalions were to be formed, together with further expansion of the Combat Police.Bolger, Chapter 2 Counterinsurgency: The Interior ==January 1968== ===The Blue House Raid=== The Blue House complex in Seoul, South Korea, in April 2007. It serves as the executive office and official residence of the South Korean president. On the night of 17 January 1968, 31 men of Unit 124 penetrated the 2ID sector of the DMZ by cutting through the chain-link fence and passing undetected within 30m of a manned 2ID position. The mission of Unit 124, as explained to them by KPA Reconnaissance Bureau chief, Lieutenant General Kim Chung-tae, was \\"to go to Seoul and cut off the head of Park Chung Hee\\". It was believed that by assassinating Park, the South would be thrown into turmoil, causing the South Korean populace to rise up and fight against the South Korean government and American soldiers, leading to reunification.Bolger, Chapter 3 The Blue House Raid On the afternoon of 19 January Unit 124 encountered 4 woodcutters, but rather than killing them the Unit 124 commander proceeded to try to indoctrinate them with details of the coming insurrection and the glories of North Korean communism. The North Koreans released the woodcutters with warnings not to notify the authorities. The woodcutters notified the Police as soon as possible, and an alert went up the chain of command in accordance with Presidential Instruction #18. By the morning of 20 January the police and military were on full alert, but not knowing the mission of Unit 124 they were attempting to guard important sites as well as the approaches to Seoul. Unit 124 entered Seoul in 2–3-man cells on 20 January, and noting the heightened security and by eavesdropping of ROKA radio frequencies they devised a new assault plan. Changing into uniforms of the 26th Infantry Division they proceeded to march the last 2 km to the Blue House, posing as a unit returning from a counter-guerilla patrol. After passing several ROKA and Police units, Unit 124 was stopped by a Police unit only 800m from the Blue House. The Police began questioning the Unit 124 members and when a Police officer grew suspicious and drew his pistol he was shot by a Unit 124 member. A running gun battle then developed in which 2 members of Unit 124 were killed. The ROKA, Police and U.S. Army began a massive manhunt as the remaining members of Unit 124 attempted to escape north and cross the DMZ. A further 26 members of Unit 124 were killed, one captured (Kim Shin-Jo) and two missing presumed killed (though at least one member of the Unit apparently survived and returned to North Korea) while 26 South Koreans and 4 U.S. Army servicemen were killed. ===The Pueblo Incident=== On 23 January 1968 North Korean patrol boats operating under cover of MiG-21 fighters captured the in international waters northeast of Wonsan, killing one crewman. General Bonesteel was unaware of the mission of the Pueblo and the 314th Air Division had no suitable aircraft available to give assistance to the Pueblo. By the time that attack aircraft could be sent to the area, the Pueblo and her remaining 82 crewmen were in captivity in Wonsan harbour.Bolger, Chapter 3 The Damned Pueblo ===American- South Korean reactions=== The seizure of the Pueblo was one of a number of crises facing the Johnson Administration in January 1968: in Vietnam, the Battle of Khe Sanh had commenced on 21 January. President Johnson ordered a show of force with a massive deployment of U.S. air and navy assets to Korea under the code-names Operation Combat Fox (200+ combat aircraft) and Operation Formation Star (6 aircraft carriers plus support vessels) as well as the partial mobilization of reservists for the first time since the Cuban Missile Crisis.Bolger, Chapter 3 The Conventional Response: A Show of Force Despite this military buildup, President Johnson wished to avoid escalating the existing conflict in Korea and instructed General Bonesteel to begin negotiations for the return of the Pueblo crew with the North Koreans through the Military Armistice Commission at Panmunjom. Even as the extra forces were deploying to South Korea, the Tet Offensive in South Vietnam began on 30 January 1968. President Johnson regarded the seizure of the Pueblo and the timing of the Tet Offensive to have been coordinated to divert U.S. resources away from Vietnam and to force the South Koreans to withdraw their two Divisions and Marine Brigade from South Vietnam.Bolger, Chapter 3 The Moment of Crisis Unlike President Johnson, General Bonesteel saw no such connection. He regarded the Blue House Raid as having been planned at the highest levels in North Korea, while the seizure of the Pueblo seemed merely opportunistic and the timing of the Tet Offensive as helpful but coincidental. He saw no change to his mission of defending South Korea and preventing an escalation of the existing low-intensity conflict. The South Koreans saw things differently. They regarded the Blue House Raid and the seizure of the Pueblo as signs of a North Korean threat that had to be dealt with strongly by both the ROK and the U.S.. When news of negotiations between the U.S. and North Koreans at Panmunjom became public on 6 February, the Park Administration accused the U.S. of a policy of appeasement. Newspaper editorials and Government officials suggested that the Korean units in South Vietnam should be recalled to deal with the North Korean threat, while various advisers coaxed President Park to \\"Go North\\" with or without the Americans. President Park refused to negotiate seriously with either General Bonesteel or Ambassador William J. Porter. It appeared that the split that Kim Il-Sung hoped to create between the ROK and the U.S. was becoming a reality. On 10 February Cyrus Vance arrived in Seoul to negotiate with President Park on behalf of President Johnson. Vance met with Park on 11 February and set out the Johnson Administration's position: there would be no wider war in Korea, any ROK cross-border action was subject to approval by General Bonesteel who would himself need approval from President Johnson and the U.S. would negotiate as necessary to secure the release of the Pueblo crew. Vance offered Park $100M in immediate military aid (including F-4D Phantom II fighter jets) with more to follow, provided Park agreed not to \\"go North.\\" Four days later Park agreed to Vance's terms. ==Implementing the American and South Korean strategy== The Blue House Raid and the Pueblo Incident both served to raise the profile of the low-intensity conflict being fought in South Korea and finally brought in the resources needed to fully implement the joint U.S./ROK counterinsurgency strategy. The massive surge deployment of U.S. warships and combat aircraft in operations Formation Star and Combat Fox served to deter further large-scale incursions. Once the immediate threat subsided, the U.S. Seventh Fleet withdrew its ships by mid-1968, while the U.S. Air Force gradually reduced its Combat Fox deployment over a period of 16 months. DMZ south boundary fence and guard towers, 14 August 1968 On 1 April 1968, the Department of Defense on the recommendation of General Bonesteel declared the DMZ-Imjin River area as a hostile fire zone, entitling service members stationed in the area to hostile- fire pay and later for the award of the Combat Infantryman Badge and Combat Medical Badge to all qualified men serving north of the Imjin River.Bolger, Chapter 2 The Conventional Response: Resources This change in designation also meant that Korea would now receive priority second only to South Vietnam. In addition to the $100M promised to the ROK by envoy Vance, Congress also allocated $230M to improve U.S. and ROK facilities and combat readiness across the DMZ. $32M worth of material for the construction of the DMZ barrier and communications equipment was airlifted to South Korea, allowing the completion of the improved anti-infiltration barrier along the entire DMZ by 30 July 1968. The 6th Aviation Platoon which was en route to South Vietnam was instead deployed to South Korea, with its 12 UH-1D Hueys more than doubled the number of UH-1s available, allowing some to remain on alert with quick reaction forces while others conducted counter-infiltration operations. Several thousand additional enlisted men were allocated to Eighth Army alleviating manpower shortages while the Imjin Scout programme improved training in counterinfiltration tactics. Dog-tracker teams were deployed allowing improved detection of infiltrators, while several hundred M16 rifles were procured allowing patrols to match the firepower of KPA infiltrators. These improvements taken together resulted in a dramatic increase in the detection and elimination of KPA infiltrators in 1968.Bolger, Chapter 3 The Unconventional Response: The DMZ The Blue House Raid convinced President Park to make one crucial change to Presidential Directive #18, in February 1968 he ordered the creation of the Homeland Defense Reserve Force (HDRF), publicly announced in April, within 6 months more than 2 million South Korean citizens had volunteered forming more than 60,000 local defense platoons and companies. Park also ordered the establishment of 20 Reconstruction Villages just south of the DMZ, populated by armed ex-soldiers and their families and the dispatch of ROKA civic action Medical/Enlightenment Teams into remote areas, particularly in the Taebaek and Jiri Mountain areas.Bolger, Chapter 3 The Unconventional Response: The Interior ==Ulchin-Samcheok landings== While the DMZ became increasingly difficult to penetrate during 1968, South Korea's coastline, despite some improvements in ROK Navy capabilities, remained vulnerable to infiltration.Bolger, Chapter 3 The Unconventional Response: The Sea Approaches PPS-43, compasses, grenade and fake ID from the Ulchin-Samcheok Landings at the War Memorial of Korea On the night of 30 October 1968, 120 men of Unit 124 landed at 8 separate locations between Ulchin and Samcheok in Gangwon province and moved inland on a 30-day mission to create guerilla bases in the Taebaek Mountains. On the morning of 31 October they entered several villages and began indoctrinating the villagers, several of whom slipped away to alert the authorities. ROKA forces soon arrived in the area aboard the UH-1 Huey's of the 6th Aviation Platoon and some of the new UH-1s provided to the ROKA under the Military Assistance Program. The 36th Homeland Defense Infantry Division, parts of two other Divisions, an ROK Marine Corps battalion, Combat Police companies, an ROK Special Forces Group and thousands of Home Defense Reserves took part in the manhunt that followed. Within two weeks most of the infiltrators had been killed. On 9 December several commandos murdered 10-year-old Lee Seung-bok and 3 other members of his family at their home on the remote northern slope of Gyebang mountain. By the time President Park suspended the operation on 26 December 110 North Koreans had been killed and 7 captured, for the loss of 40 regular army, police and militia and 23 civilians.Bolger, Chapter 3 The Ulchin-Samcheok Landings ==North Korean strategy changes== By the end of 1968 it was apparent that despite two years of unconventional operations, North Korea had failed to ignite an insurgency in the South, the U.S.-ROK relationship was stronger than ever and President Park had cemented his legitimacy with the population. In late December Kim Il- Sung purged the senior military officers responsible for the unconventional warfare campaign accusing them of failing to correctly implement the Party line, there could be no suggestion that the KWP line simply did not appeal to South Koreans. Defense Minister, General Kim Chongbong and KPA Political Bureau chairman, General Ho Pong-haek were both executed, while the chief of the General Staff, the Reconnaissance Bureau chief, the KPN commander and the commanders of three frontline KPA Corps were all imprisoned. Units 124 and 283 were disbanded and special warfare capabilities were made explicitly subordinate to conventional military operations. The KPA was transformed by the institution of a Commissar system in all units down to Company level to ensure KWP control over all military activity. Despite the change in strategy North Korea continued to conduct infiltrations, apparently as cover while the purge and restructuring was carried out.Bolger, Chapter 4 A Purge in Pyongyang The UN Command did not initially appreciate the changes in Pyongyang, regarding the reduction in infiltrations as being caused by effective UN action rather than the abandonment by Pyongyang of its failed strategy; limited intelligence sources and few published speeches by Kim Il-Sung gave few clues as to the KWP's policy change. In mid-March the combined forces Exercise Focus Retina began in South Korea, this exercise was condemned by the North as a dress rehearsal for an invasion and KPA regulars began a series of attacks and infiltrations against 2ID position on the DMZ that lasted until mid-May.Bolger, Chapter 4 The North Strikes Back On 15 April 1969 (birthday of Kim Il-sung), two KPAF MiGs shot down a USAF EC-121M Warning Star on an electronic intelligence mission 167 km off the east coast of North Korea, killing all 31 crewmen. President Richard Nixon and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger considered a reprisal air strike or an aerial escort linked to a diplomatic complaint at the truce table, both initially favored an air strike on the basis that force should be met with force. Nixon's advisers opposed an airstrike fearing that this could provoke a full-scale war when the U.S. was already committed in Vietnam and they were supported in this by General Bonesteel and Ambassador Porter. On 18 April Nixon announced that future intelligence flights would have fighter escorts (which had been the case until the end of 1968 when the tensions on the Korean peninsula were believed to have subsided) and a protest was lodged with the North Koreans at Panmunjom which was accepted without comment. From 19 to 26 April the Seventh Fleet's Task Force 71 (including 4 carriers and their escorts) conducted operations off the east coast of North Korea as a show of force. ==Conflict diffusion== By May 1969, the level of intensity of the conflict had reduced substantially. Isolated incidents continued to occur particularly along the ROKA-controlled sectors of the DMZ, but it had become clear that the North had abandoned its hopes of starting an insurgency in the South. Qualitative improvements in the ROK Army meant that the U.S. could start to contemplate reducing its military presence in South Korea. On 25 July 1969, President Nixon announced his Nixon Doctrine that, henceforth, the U.S. expected its allies to defend themselves with U.S. air and seapower support (and the nuclear umbrella), but not U.S. ground troops. While aimed primarily at South Vietnam, this policy would also apply to South Korea (however, Nixon assured President Park that his commitment to South Korea was unchanged). On 1 October 1969 General Bonesteel handed over command of USFK to General John H. Michaelis. One of General Michaelis' early tasks was negotiating the release of three U.S. soldiers captured when their OH-23 helicopter was shot down after straying across the DMZ; their release on 3 December 1969 is regarded as the official end of the conflict.Bolger, Chapter 4 The Torch Passes ==Timeline== Major incidents - Korean DMZ, 1964–1969 ===1966=== * 2 November: 2nd Infantry Division (2ID) patrol (1st Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment) ambushed south of DMZ.

The CD has an increased focus on drummer/vocalist, Francis Mark; after the release of the album it was confirmed by the band (after Benjamin Perri had left) that this was due to Ben not contributing as much lyrically or vocally to the album as with previous efforts, and his discontent about being in the band at the time. The album lyrics were mainly written by the band without Benjamin Perri, which may explain why the lyrics have a different slant on them than previous FATA albums. Also contrary to their previous two albums, Melanie Wills of One True Thing is absent on this release. ==Background and release== It has also been said that Josh Eppard of Coheed and Cambria is responsible for naming the song \\"Placentapede\\". It was said that when at a festival with Coheed & Cambria, FATA planned to play the song live, and they didn't have a name for it because the album wasn't out yet and the song was still in its early stages.

Mulgoa is located approximately west of the Sydney central business district. Mulgoa covers an area of , south of the suburbs of Regentville and Glenmore Park. ==History== ===Aboriginal culture=== Mulgoa takes its name from the Mulgoa people who were the indigenous inhabitants of the area and spoke the Dharug language. The name is believed to mean black swan. The Mulgoa weren't the only inhabitants of the area. They shared the Mulgoa Valley with the Gandangara people of the Southern Highlands, whose territory extended up into the Blue Mountains. They lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle governed by traditional laws, which had their origins in the Dreamtime. Their homes were bark huts called 'gunyahs'. They hunted kangaroos and emus for meat, and gathered yams, berries and other native plants. ===European settlement=== Following the arrival of the First Fleet in Sydney, there were a number of bloody battles between the British settlers and the local indigenous people in this area, however, it is believed that the Mulgoa people were generally peaceful and most of the clashes were with the Gandangara. The first government land grants in the area were made in 1810 to Edward Cox, the four- year-old son of Captain William Cox, who constructed a famous road across the Blue Mountains in 1814. William Cox built The Cottage on the land in about 1811. Fernhill, a much grander residence with associated gardens, now heritage-listed, was completed in the 1840s, although the proposed second- storey was never added. Not far away dwelt Cox's friend Sir John Jamison, who erected the colony's finest mansion, Regentville House, in 1824, on an eminence overlooking the Nepean River. In 1821, three large land grants were made on the Nepean at Mulgoa to the Norton family: James Norton, the founder of Sydney's first law firm and his father and brother, Nathaniel.\\"Norton, James (1795–1862)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University. Retrieved 16 September 2011. The centre of Mulgoa's spiritual life in the colonial era was St Thomas' Anglican Church, which dates from 1838. It was the first public building in the Mulgoa Valley and was constructed out of sandstone and cedar on paddocks donated by the Cox family, with Sir John Jamison serving as one of its patrons. The Reverend Thomas Cooper Makinson was St Thomas' inaugural rector. Attached to the church was Mulgoa's first school which operated until 1871–72, when the Mulgoa Provisional School replaced it. In 1893, Mulgoa's population was sufficiently large to be granted the status of a municipality. Its area extended beyond the current suburb boundaries. In 1949, however, council rationalisations led to it merging with Penrith, St Marys and Castlereagh into a larger Penrith Municipality. These days, Mulgoa is still primarily a rural area. Mulgoa Post Office opened on 1 September 1863. === Heritage listings === Mulgoa has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Fairlight Road: Fairlight Homestead * Mulgoa Road: Fernhill, Mulgoa * 754-760 Mulgoa Road: Glenmore, Mulgoa * St Thomas Road: St Thomas' Anglican Church, Mulgoa * 2 St Thomas Road: Cox's Cottage ==Transport== Mulgoa Road is the main road in the suburb, connecting with Penrith. Busways provides a bus bus route 795 which runs from Warragamba to Penrith along Mulgoa Road. The iconic Mulgoa speedhump is known amongst the locals for its inability to slow cars down. ==Education== There is a government-run primary school, Mulgoa Public School, and a privately run school, Nepean Christian School. == Demographics == The recorded population of Mulgoa in the was 1,898. The majority of residents are Australian born (79 per cent) with small minorities born in England (2.8 per cent), Germany (1.6 per cent), and Malta (1.5 per cent). The most common responses for religion were Catholic 36.7%, Anglican 24.7% and No Religion 14.1%. There are a large number of couples with children (52 per cent) and most houses are owned outright (42.6 per cent) or being paid off (41.9 per cent). The number of renters (12.9 per cent) was substantially less than the national average of 30.9 per cent. The median household income ($2,217 per week) was higher than the national average ($1,438). ==Notable residents== * Edward Cox, a son of William Cox, and politician; and his son, Edward King Cox, also a politician. * Captain William Cox (1764–1837), Mulgoa pioneer, military officer, landowner and road-builder. * Robert Dulhunty (1803–1853), landowner, police magistrate, alderman and founder of the Dubbo district in central-western New South Wales. * Sir John Jamison Kt, MD (1776–1844), landowner, physician and Member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales. * The Reverend Thomas Cooper Makinson (1809–1893), Mulgoa's first resident Anglican clergyman and schoolmaster, who later converted to Catholicism. * Emmanuel Margolin, entrepreneur and former operator of El Caballo Blanco, which contained Sydney's largest private zoo. * Senator The Honourable Marise Payne. * David Stove (1927-1994), philosopher. ==Governance== At a local government level, Mulgoa is part of the south ward of Penrith City Council, represented by Jim Aitken, Mark Davies, Karen McKeown, Susan Page and Gary Rumble.

Sir Henry Ellis (29 November 177715 January 1869) was an English librarian and antiquarian, for a long period principal librarian at the British Museum. ==Early years== Born in London, Henry Ellis was educated at the Mercers' School, and at Merchant Taylors' School, where his brother, the Rev. John Joseph Ellis, was assistant- master for forty years. Having gained one of the Merchant Taylors' exhibitions at St John's College, Oxford, he matriculated in 1796. ==Librarian== In 1798, through his friend John Price, Ellis was appointed one of the two assistants in the Bodleian Library, the other being his future colleague in the British Museum Henry Hervey Baber. He took the degree of B.C.L. in 1802. He was a Fellow of St John's till 1805. In 1800 he was appointed a temporary assistant in the library of the British Museum, and in 1805 he became assistant-keeper of printed books under William Beloe. The theft of prints which cost Beloe his appointment in the following year raised Ellis to the headship of the department, and Baber became his assistant. Ellis's promotion coincided with a period of increased activity at the museum. The printed catalogue of the library was at that time comprised in two folio volumes, full of inaccuracies, but provided with a manuscript supplement, and to a considerable extent revised and corrected in manuscript by Beloe's predecessor Samuel Harper. Ellis and Baber commenced their work of reconstruction in March 1807, and completed it in December 1819. Ellis had meanwhile been moved to the manuscripts department (1812), accepted (1814) the then almost sinecure office of secretary to the museum, and in the same year became secretary to the Society of Antiquaries of London. During the forty years for which he held the post, he only missed two meetings. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1811. In 1827 Joseph Planta, the principal librarian, died, and Ellis, who had for nine years taken on much of his duties, expected to succeed him. When two names for the vacancy were submitted to the Crown, Henry Fynes Clinton, a protégé of Archbishop Charles Manners-Sutton, was placed before Ellis. Ellis intrigued successfully for the post, it is said by pursuing the carriage of the royal physician, Sir William Knighton, and enlisting his good offices with the king. He was appointed on 20 December 1827. In 1832 he was made a Knight of Hanover, an honour which he shared with John Herschel, Frederic Madden, and others; and he was knighted in 1833. ==In the face of reform== The museum was at a low ebb in the 1830s. William Cobbett campaigned against it, and Benjamin Hawes used a complaint from an ex-employee as a pretext to set up a parliamentary enquiry. Ellis told the parliamentary committee of 1835 that if the museum were not closed for three weeks in the autumn, \\"the place would positively become unwholesome\\", and that it would never do to open it on Saturdays, when \\"the most mischievous part of the population was abroad\\". The committee's conclusions were enough to force the trustees to change management practices. They devolved the heaviest of the principal librarian's duties on the secretary, who became the most important officer in the museum. Josiah Forshall took on the position of secretary in 1837, who took control, with Madden and Anthony Panizzi under him. Ellis, though seemingly unconscious of any change in his position, was virtually superseded as chief officer; and when the committee of 1848–9 united the offices of secretary and principal librarian, Panizzi was the real ruler of the museum. ==Later life== Ellis shared the secretary position at the Society of Antiquaries from 1848 with John Yonge Akerman, who took over in 1853. He was director of the Society from 1853 to 1857. Excellent health and the absence of any machinery for compulsory retirement kept Ellis at his post until February 1856, when he resigned on a pension, and lived thirteen years more close to the museum. He died at his house in Bedford Square on 15 January 1869. ==Works== A pillory, illustration from Ellis's Observations on Popular Antiquities (1842). In 1798 Ellis published at the age of twenty-one his History of St. Leonard's, Shoreditch, and Liberty of Norton Folgate. As an antiquarian, his contributions to Archaeologia were numerous. In 1813 he edited John Brand's Popular Antiquities, a work going back to Henry Bourne. His catalogue of the manuscripts of the Society of Antiquaries was published in 1816. Also in that year he published on behalf of the Record Commission the indexes and additional texts to Domesday Book: his general introduction to Domesday, written in 1813, also appeared in separate form (in two volumes) in 1833. With John Caley and others, he published a new edition of William Dugdale's Monasticon between 1817 and 1833. He used his position as head of the manuscript department to publish Original Letters illustrative of English History, mostly drawn from originals in the Museum: three series of this collection appeared, in 1824, 1827, and 1846 respectively, the first in three volumes, the others each in four. He also drew up, as secretary, guides to the departments of the British Museum. Ellis completed portions of the British Museum catalogue, from A to F and from P to R inclusive, Baber doing all the rest. He was assisted by Thomas Dampier; but his portion of the catalogue was criticised by his successor Panizzi. For Rees's Cyclopædia, Ellis contributed articles on Antiquities and other subjects, but the topics are not known. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1777 births Category:1869 deaths Category:People educated at Mercers' School Category:Fellows of St John's College, Oxford Category:English librarians Category:Directors of the British Museum Category:Employees of the British Library Category:English knights Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London Category:Businesspeople from London Category:Historians of England Category:19th-century antiquarians Category:Knights of the Royal Guelphic Order ","title":"Henry Ellis (librarian)"},{"id":"2581337","text":" Abberwick is a hamlet near the River Aln in the English county of Northumberland.

Production continued until 1915. Cars produced in 1914 have flutes in the bonnet that fade out a short way behind the radiator. ==Road test== left This 1914 car described below was very familiar to the writer who was a colleague and a close friend of its owner, Laurence Pomeroy junior, the designer's son. This car was owned from new by W T Badgery until bought in 1946 by L E W Pomeroy and it was later the property of Reg Long. \\"A casual glance suggests its engine is a completely uninspired design, side valves along one side of the cylinders and the carburetter on the other but this simplicity makes it lighter than more complicated machinery, the chassis too with its \\"wheel at each corner\\" and conventional semi-elliptic springs and light unsprung parts—the brake drums on the back axle are remarkably small. The driver immediately notices the heaviness of the flywheel. The clutch, a beautifully smooth Hele-Shaw multi-plate, hisses as it engages and the heavy flywheel gives the car a lumbering gait but then, and it is a shock, the engine shows it is longing to 'rev'. The gear-change is delightful and with each new higher gear the whole car seems to gather new life with a magnificent beat from the exhaust. The engine is by no means silent. Exhaust and tappet noise with a continuous if subdued howl of pinions all merge with other unidentifiable sounds but there is no suggestion these noises may not be maintained so long as the driver wishes with unflagging regularity for hour after hour. The seat puts the driver up high and its easy to underestimate road speed. It is one thing to go fast in a straight line but quite another to cover a distance at high average speed. This car has truly amazing roadholding, it is high and narrow yet it passes through roundabouts almost as if there were none there. It is the designer's perfect balance of the whole chassis which makes this phenomenon possible. The brakes would probably not seem inadequate in the world of 1914. The foot brake operating on the transmission is exceedingly powerful but gets very hot and needs regular adjustment to maintain effectiveness. The handbrake on the rear wheels can be used for long descents but the drums are too small to provide dramatic stopping power. Front brakes would make a big difference but in 1914 front brakes were still the exception rather than the rule. The Prince Henry Vauxhall was not ahead of its time yet in spite of its heavy flywheel it is in all essentials a vintage car. It stands on the threshold of a new era and one can accurately describe it as the first of the vintage and the last of the veteran cars.\\" –Kent Karslake, 1956 ==Name== \\"The evolution of this model has been interesting. In 1910 there was organised in Germany the event now famous as the Prince Henry Tour. Having an idea of opening an agency in Germany, the Vauxhall company thought that to enter for this competitive run would be useful to them. There were penalties for involuntary stops, as in most road trials, but there was also a speed test in which marks were awarded according to a figure of merit based upon a hypothetical relationship between car-speed and rated horse-power. It was obvious, however, that the big engine was in the most favourable position to win in the speed test, and hence, reliability being equal, to gain the premier award. Nevertheless, the Vauxhall people entered their 90 by 120 mm., engined model, doing all they knew to get the maximum power from it. Weight also being included in the formula, a lighter chassis was designed. Further, as the width and shape of the dashboard was virtually fixed by the regulations, a body was designed with a bulbous back to give a reasonable stream-line form, and to be consistent, the Prince Henry radiator and bonnet were adopted. This was one of the first cases of a British car having its bonnet merging into the scuttle without an intermediate no- man's land of exposed dashboard. \\"Of the three Vauxhalls which ran in the Prince Henry Tour, two got full marks for reliability, and all did about 65 miles an hour in the speed trial, which was really quite good for that engine with a four-seated body and a full complement of passengers. So many people desired cars of this special type that in 1911 it was made a regular product of the Vauxhall works, and, during the last year or so a new style has sprung up. In this the engine dimensions are 95 by 140 mm., the old bore-stroke ratio having penalised the car under many hill-climbing formulae. All such formulae which do not involve the cubic capacity of the engine are by common acceptance considered advantageous to engines with small bore and long stroke. The chassis follows the lines of the original Prince Henry, but has rather a longer wheel base.\\" H.

The village is included in the eight hamlets and villages called The Rodings. It is in west Essex, north from Chipping Ongar, and west from the county town of Chelmsford. ==History== According to A Dictionary of British Place Names, Roding derives from \\"Rodinges\\", as is listed in the Domesday Book and recorded earlier as such at c.1050, with the later variation 'Roinges Abbatisse' recorded in 1237. The 'Abbess' refers to the manorial possession by a man called 'Aitrop' held under the ownership of the Abbess of Barking Abbey.Mills, Anthony David (2003); A Dictionary of British Place Names, Oxford University Press, revised edition (2011), p.392. Abbess Roding In the Domesday account Abbess Roding is listed as in the Hundred of Ongar. The manor held 18 households, seven villagers, two smallholders, five slaves, and one freeman, with 2 lord's plough teams, 3.5 men's plough teams, of meadow, and a woodland with 20 pigs. In 1066 there were 10 cattle, 40 pigs, 100 sheep and a cob. In 1086 there were 14 cattle, 60 pigs, 131 sheep, and three cobs. Before the Conquest, lordship was held by Wulfmer of Eaton Socon; after given to Eudo Dapifer who was also Tenant-in-chief to William the Conqueror. \\"Abbess Roding\\", Open Domesday, University of Hull.

The technology has encompassed two main fields. Either creating aesthetic surfaces (class A surfaces) that also perform a function; for example, car bodies and consumer product outer forms, or technical surfaces for components such as gas turbine blades and other fluid dynamic engineering components. CAD software packages use two basic methods for the creation of surfaces. The first begins with construction curves (splines) from which the 3D surface is then swept (section along guide rail) or meshed (lofted) through. A surface being created from curves. The second method is direct creation of the surface with manipulation of the surface poles/control points. Surface edit by poles From these initially created surfaces, other surfaces are constructed using either derived methods such as offset or angled extensions from surfaces; or via bridging and blending between groups of surfaces. Animated version == Surfaces == Freeform surface, or freeform surfacing, is used in CAD and other computer graphics software to describe the skin of a 3D geometric element. Freeform surfaces do not have rigid radial dimensions, unlike regular surfaces such as planes, cylinders and conic surfaces. They are used to describe forms such as turbine blades, car bodies and boat hulls. Initially developed for the automotive and aerospace industries, freeform surfacing is now widely used in all engineering design disciplines from consumer goods products to ships. Most systems today use nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) mathematics to describe the surface forms; however, there are other methods such as Gordon surfaces or Coons surfaces . The forms of freeform surfaces (and curves) are not stored or defined in CAD software in terms of polynomial equations, but by their poles, degree, and number of patches (segments with spline curves). The degree of a surface determines its mathematical properties, and can be seen as representing the shape by a polynomial with variables to the power of the degree value. For example, a surface with a degree of 1 would be a flat cross section surface. A surface with degree 2 would be curved in one direction, while a degree 3 surface could (but does not necessarily) change once from concave to convex curvature. Some CAD systems use the term order instead of degree. The order of a polynomial is one greater than the degree, and gives the number of coefficients rather than the greatest exponent. Example surface pole map The poles (sometimes known as control points) of a surface define its shape. The natural surface edges are defined by the positions of the first and last poles. (Note that a surface can have trimmed boundaries.) The intermediate poles act like magnets drawing the surface in their direction. The surface does not, however, go through these points. The second and third poles as well as defining shape, respectively determine the start and tangent angles and the curvature. In a single patch surface (Bézier surface), there is one more pole than the degree values of the surface. Surface patches can be merged into a single NURBS surface; at these points are knot lines. The number of knots will determine the influence of the poles on either side and how smooth the transition is. The smoothness between patches, known as continuity, is often referred to in terms of a C value: *C0: just touching, could have a nick *C1: tangent, but could have sudden change in curvature *C2: the patches are curvature continuous to one another Two more important aspects are the U and V parameters. These are values on the surface ranging from 0 to 1, used in the mathematical definition of the surface and for defining paths on the surface: for example, a trimmed boundary edge. Note that they are not proportionally spaced along the surface. A curve of constant U or constant V is known as an isoperimetric curve, or U (V) line. In CAD systems, surfaces are often displayed with their poles of constant U or constant V values connected together by lines; these are known as control polygons. == Modelling == When defining a form, an important factor is the continuity between surfaces - how smoothly they connect to one another. One example of where surfacing excels is automotive body panels. Just blending two curved areas of the panel with different radii of curvature together, maintaining tangential continuity (meaning that the blended surface doesn't change direction suddenly, but smoothly) won't be enough. They need to have a continuous rate of curvature change between the two sections, or else their reflections will appear disconnected. The continuity is defined using the terms *G0 – position (touching) *G1 – tangent (angle) *G2 – curvature (radius) *G3 – acceleration (rate of change of curvature) To achieve a high quality NURBS or Bézier surface, degrees of 5 or greater are generally used. == History of terms == The term lofting originally came from the shipbuilding industry where loftsmen worked on \\"barn loft\\" type structures to create the keel and bulkhead forms out of wood. This was then passed on to the aircraft then automotive industries who also required streamline shapes. The term spline also has nautical origins coming from East Anglian dialect word for a thin long strip of wood (probably from old English and Germanic word splint). == Freeform surface modelling software == == See also == *Bézier surface *Solid modelling *Computer representation of surfaces *Steven Anson Coons *NURBS *Parametric surface *Freeform surface machining ==References== Category:Computer-aided design Category:3D computer graphics Category:Surfaces ","title":"Freeform surface modelling"},{"id":"2581365","text":"Blackball (also known as National Lampoon's Blackball) is a 2003 British sports comedy film, based on the game of lawn bowls. The screenplay was written by Tim Firth, and the film was directed by Mel Smith. The film features James Cromwell as a master bowls player, and Paul Kaye as a naturally talented player who have differing social backgrounds; who are placed together by Vince Vaughn to play for England against Australia. Its fictional plot is based on the bowls player Griff Sanders, who was also referred to as \\"The Bad Boy of Bowls\\". ==Background== In addition to the main character being modelled after Griff Sanders, the film also spoofs Bjørge Lillelien's infamous commentary from Norway's 2–1 defeat of England at football in 1981. This theme was first riffed by David Baddiel and Frank Skinner on their TV show Fantasy Football League, and the other commentator for the match was Angus Loughran, who played 'Statto' on Fantasy Football. Blackball was filmed on the Isle of Man and Torquay during October and November 2002. It was released on DVD on 16 February 2004. Various internet games were created in promotion of the movie.https://web.archive.org/web/20031117141030/http://www.badboybowls.com/BadBoyBowls_v14.swf Crackerjack an Australian bowls based film that pre-dates Blackball has been described in some circles as the true inspiration for the English version. ==Plot== Cliff Starkey (Paul Kaye), is a rebellious young bowls player, brought up on \\"the Lynx Estate\\", with his friend Trevor (Johnny Vegas), and grandfather Mutley (Bernard Cribbins) as a painter and decorator. He dreams of playing for his country but always preferring to play by his own rules, was always disapproved by the local Torquay bowls club. He learns of Australian brothers (Carl and Mark Doohan) future tour of England, and plans to get selected for the national team. Starkey would play through the tournament undefeated, defeating veteran player (and thirteen times champion) Ray Speight (James Cromwell). After winning the competition, and becoming eligible to play for England, Speight, the head of the local lawn bowls association, bans Starkey for fifteen years for writing an expletive on an opponent's scorecard. Angry about the ban, Starkey gatecrashes the celebration party for Speight, who was declared champion; launching a wood across the dinner table at Speight. Cliff Starkey being presented by Rick Schwartz as the \\"bad boy of bowls\\". Starkey is then picked up by sports agent Rick Schwartz (Vince Vaughn), where Starkey is re branded as the \\"bad boy of bowls\\", turning the normally sedate sport into a glitzy, in your face competition. Having defeated many lower key players in unofficial matches, using his variety of trick shots Starkey develops a romance with Kerry Speight (Alice Evans), Ray's daughter. Schwartz proposes a way to get the ban on Starkey lifted, by using this relationship, where the two are spotted by national press, setting Ray Speight to swear at a public address, causing the ban to be removed. With the sport's popularity at an all-time high, both Speight and Starkey become media celebrities. Schwartzs organises both Starkey and Speight take on Australia's unbeaten Doohan brothers in \\"The Ashes\\", a one off tournament in a custom made bowls arena in Torquay. Schwartz; afraid that the relationship with Kerry is affecting Starkey's game; ends his relationship without his consent causing Starkey to fire Schwartz. Both players have a wide disdain for each other, and are made to use custom bowls for the game. After failing with his woods, and the pressure of the game getting to him, Starkey throws his own woods (and signature carrier bag) into a canal. With both players failing at half time, Trevor and Kerry talk to the pair, and get them to work as a team to make a comeback. Starkey would dive into the canal, followed by Ray Speight, who thought Starkey was trying to drown himself, but was in fact rescuing his own bowls. The two return to the arena, wet and make a comeback thanks to Speight's experience and Starkey's extravagance, to force the game into an extra name (humorously titled the \\"golden bowl\\"), much to the disbelief of Carl and Mark Doohan. The final end, a one bowl play-off, sees a perfect front toucher from Mark Doohan. Speight gives the bowl to Starkey, but stops him from playing his intended fire shot, and instead instructs him to play his own signature large inswinging bowl. The shot works, and the two celebrate having defeated the Australian team, and make amends with Trevor and Mutley. ==Cast== * Paul Kaye as Cliff Starkey * Johnny Vegas as Trevor * Vince Vaughn as Rick Schwartz * Alice Evans as Kerry Speight * Kenneth Cranham as Chairman Collins * Bernard Cribbins as Mutley * James Cromwell as Ray Speight * Imelda Staunton as Bridget * James Fleet as Alan The Pipe ==Reception== Critical response to the film was mixed.

The Pantelimon district is named after Saint Pantaleon (Pantelimon in Romanian), and hosts Arena Națională, the largest football stadium in Romania. Pantelimon Avenue is the backbone of the district. A Cora hypermarket is situated in this neighbourhood. Several car showrooms (Renault & Dacia, Peugeot, Skoda, Fiat) have been built in the east side of the district. The area was a small houses neighborhood until systematisation started in 1971. The first apartment blocks were completed in 1974, followed by the completion of the \\"Delfinului\\" housing complex in 1976-1978, construction having continued until the 1980s, specifically west of the 23 August Stadium and on Chișinău Avenue. Most of the buildings constructed in the 1970s feature structures typically filled out with mortar, whilst some of them use prefabricated concrete panels. Ultimately, in the 1980s, the predominant construction technique was using prefabricated concrete panels, and most buildings of the same type can be seen one after the other, being \\"copy-pasted\\" in a typical fashion of the era. A famous area of the district is \\"Capătu' lu' 14\\" (or \\"Capu' lu' 14\\", literally \\"the terminus of (tram) line 14\\"), which is situated in the east side of the neighbourhood, and features \\"Confort 2\\" block buildings with 4 stories.

In 1939, Cheng Zhi school, together with Tsinghua University, moved to Kunming following the Japanese invasion and became part of the joint secondary school of the National Southwestern Associated University. The school moved back to Beijing in 1946 after the war and became a combined middle/elementary school. ===Rename and reorganization (1952-1960)=== * In 1952, the middle school part of Cheng Zhi and the middle school affiliated to Yenching University merged and formed the Tsinghua University Fushe Zhongxue (清华大学附设中学, Zhongxue as an add-on to Tsinghua University). * In 1958, the preparatory school established in 1951, intended to prepare cadre workers and farmers for education in the university, was merged into Fushe Zhongxue. * In 1960, Tsinghua University backed a further expansion of Qinghua Fuzhong, for the first time established its high-school section, and gave it its current name. ===Prosperity (1960-1966)=== The reason why Tsinghua invested in and reorganized Qinghua Fuzhong came from the university's own problem with its incoming students: many of them excelled in nothing but exams. To solve this problem, Tsinghua decided to prepare its incoming students themselves. While other Middle and High schools in Beijing are administered by the local government, Tsinghua University directly appoints the headmaster and other keynote figures of Qinghua Fuzhong and backs it with financial support. Students are freed from repetitive training of exam questions, instead, they are encouraged to learn foreign language, participate in sports, and art performances. On top of that, born and bred in families of university faculty members and high-level government officials, most of the students in Qinghua Fuzhong already comes with good education. ===The Cultural Revolution (1966-1978)=== After Mao Zedong drew the line between bourgeois and proletarian, the war between children of university faculties and those of Party officials began. On May29th, 1966, the first Red Guard organization was established among Qinghua Fuzhong students who felt ill-treated by the school during its effort to stop the war. On June 2, the first 'big-character poster' signed by a 'Red Guard' is posted on the classroom building, declaring that they will fight with 'mid-age bourgeois' until they are destroyed. Apparently the mid-age bourgeois refers to the school's administration, which is appointed by the university. In mid June, Red Guards start to publicly criticize and denounce the school headmaster and other faculty members. The Red Guards took control of the school in August. ===Split and reunion (1978-)=== In 1978, the students came back after the 'Down to the Countryside Movement'. To accommodate them, Qinghua Fuzhong Erbu (清华附中二部), a new school later renamed to Qinghua Er Fuzhong (Second Zhongxue affiliated to Tsinghua) was founded, offering only middle school grades. In 1984, the middle school section from Qinghua Fuzhong was relocated into Qinghua Er Fuzhong, making Qinghua Fuzhong a dedicated high school. 15 years later, in 1999, the Er Fuzhong moved into newly completed buildings inside the campus of Qinghua Fuzhong. In 2003, the registration of Qinghua Er Fuzhong was cancelled and merged back into Qinghua Fuzhong. By then Qinghua Fuzhong was already known as the 'high school' of Tsinghua. ===International School=== In the 2009 school year an international school affiliated to Tsinghua Fuzhong opened, called Tsinghua International School or THIS. It is tied to and shares facilities with Tsinghua Fuzhong but remains an independent school. The school has around 430 students from grades 1-12. The colleges attended by alumni are impressive for a small school, including names like Columbia, Brown and MIT. ==Location== The school is located in the northern part of picturesque Tsinghua University campus, close to the famous Old Summer Palace in the west, and next to Yuanmingyuan Park. The laboratories, teaching devices, the library and the swimming pool of the university are used by the students. Over half the pupils of the school live on the campus. ==Faculty== Many scholars worked in the school such as scientists Prof. Zhou Peiyuan and Qian Weichang, philosopher Prof. Feng Youlan, literati Mr. Zhu Ziqing and language educationist Mr. Zhang Xiong. Scholars and academicians from Tsinghua University, Peking University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other institutions of higher learning have been invited to the school to give lectures and instructions. A group of professors from Tsinghua University teach the pupils of “senior middle school science experimental class” and “John Ma athletic class” of the school. Some of the school's teachers have been commended by the Education Ministry, Beijing municipal government, Haidian District authority and Tsinghua University. Mr. Xu Zhong-yuan, the vice-principal, won the title of outstanding teacher of Beijing municipality. Ms. Zhou Jie, another vice- principal has the title of outstanding moral education worker of Beijing municipality. Mr. Xie Juzhao, Ms. Han Qingying, Mr. Li Xuesen, and Ms. Li Zeng-ling are commended as excellent teachers in charge of a class in Beijing municipality awarded “Forbidden Cup”. ==Achievement in teaching and training== Since 1983, the high school graduates have entered institutes of higher learning every year, and 100% of the pupils entered college, among them, more than 1000 graduates entered Tsinghua University and Peking University.

It is also the first Pink Panther film to be released since Son of the Pink Panther released in 1993. In this film, Inspector Jacques Clouseau is assigned to solve the murder of a famous football coach and the theft of the famous Pink Panther diamond. The film was directed by Shawn Levy, stars Steve Martin as Clouseau and also co-stars Kevin Kline, Jean Reno, Emily Mortimer, and Beyoncé Knowles. The film grossed $159million worldwide. The Pink Panther was theatrically released on February 10, 2006, and was released on DVD and Blu- ray on June 13, 2006. A sequel was released on February 6, 2009. ==Plot== Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus recounts a soccer match between France and China: French coach Yves Gluant arrives wearing the priceless Pink Panther diamond ring, and embraces his girlfriend, pop star Xania. After France wins the game in sudden death, Gluant is killed by a poison dart, with the Pink Panther diamond nowhere to be found. Eager to win the Légion d'honneur, Dreyfus promotes clumsy small-town policeman and \\"village idiot\\", Inspector Clouseau, to the rank of Inspector and assigns him to the Pink Panther case. Dreyfus assembles a secret team of top investigators to actually crack the case, allowing Clouseau to draw media attention as the public face of the investigation. Dreyfus assigns Gendarme Gilbert Ponton as Clouseau's assistant to keep Dreyfus informed of Clouseau's actions. Ponton befriends Clouseau, who falls in love with secretary Nicole Durant. Bizu, a French player who blamed Gluant for “stealing away” Xania, is the prime murder suspect, but is shot in the head in the team's locker room. Gathering information at a casino, Clouseau encounters British Agent 006, Nigel Boswell, who foils a robbery by the \\"Gas Mask Bandits\\", using Clouseau's trench coat to hide his identity. Clouseau mistakenly receives credit for the deed and is nominated for the Légion d'honneur, much to Dreyfus's dismay. Following Xania to New York City, Ponton insists that she is a suspect because Gluant cheated on her, but Clouseau decides Xania is innocent. In New York, Clouseau discovers his love for hamburgers. Gluant’s poison is determined to have been derived from Chinese herbs, leading Dreyfus to conclude that the killer is a Chinese envoy, Dr. Pang. Dreyfus has an officer swap Clouseau's bag with one full of weapons at the airport, setting off the metal detector, and Clouseau is mistakenly arrested because of his inability to pronounce 'hamburger' correctly (he tried to smuggle some hamburgers onto the flight back to Paris). Returning to France, Clouseau is vilified by the press, and Dreyfus strips him of his rank of Inspector. Dreyfus plots to publicly arrest Dr. Pang at the Presidential Ball, where Xania will perform. Clouseau returns home and sees an article about his arrest online; deducing from a photograph of the arrest that Gluant and Bizu were killed by the same person and the killer will target Xania next, Clouseau, Ponton, and Nicole hurry to the Élysée Palace and sneak into the Presidential Ball. While Dreyfus arrests Dr. Pang for Gluant's murder, Clouseau and Ponton save Xania's life by capturing her would-be assassin Yuri, the team trainer. Jealous of Gluant and feeling overlooked for the team's success, Yuri used his knowledge of Chinese herbs to kill him; Yuri had jabbed the poison dart unseen into Gluant's neck. Yuri killed Bizu for blackmailing him after overhearing Yuri's rants against Gluant, using Russian military tactics to target Bizu’s occipital lobe. Yuri targeted Xania for ignoring him and dating Gluant. Clouseau reveals that the Pink Panther was not stolen, but sewn into the lining of Xania's purse, which had belonged to Josephine Baker and which Xania was restoring; the photograph of Clouseau’s arrest also showed an X-ray of the purse at airport security. Xania confesses that she received the diamond from Gluant as an engagement ring, which she worried could implicate her in his murder. Clouseau concludes that Xania is the ring's rightful owner, and Yuri is taken into custody. For solving the case, Clouseau wins the Légion d'honneur. Leaving the ceremony with Ponton, Clouseau gets Dreyfus' suit caught in his car door, remaining oblivious to Dreyfus' screams as he is dragged behind the car. Visiting Dreyfus in the hospital with Ponton and Nicole, Clouseau accidentally releases the brake on Dreyfus' bed, which rolls through the hospital corridors and throws Dreyfus into the Seine. ==Cast== *Steve Martin as Inspector Jacques Clouseau, a bumbling police officer from a small village in France. *Kevin Kline as Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus, the head of the French police who is obsessed with winning the Medal of Honour. *Jean Reno as Gendarme Gilbert Ponton, a capable police officer who is assigned to report to Dreyfus on Clouseau's actions. *Emily Mortimer as Nicole Durant, a secretary and romance interest of Clouseau. *Henry Czerny as Yuri, a Russian assassin and trainer of the French national football team. *Kristin Chenoweth as Cherie, an employee of the French national football team. *Roger Rees as Raymond Laroque, a wealthy casino owner and friend of Yves Gluant. *Beyoncé as Xania, a famous pop star and girlfriend of Gluant. *William Abadie as Bizu, a player on the French national football team *Scott Adkins as Jacquard, another player on the French national football team *Jean Dell as Justice Minister Clochard *Anna Katarina as Agent Corbeille *Jason Statham as Yves Gluant (uncredited), the head coach of the French national football team, whose murder is under investigation. *Clive Owen as Nigel Boswell/Agent 006 (uncredited), an MI6 secret agent and parody of James Bond. *Boris McGiver as Vainqueur (uncredited), the current head coach of the French national football team. ==Production== A re collaboration between Steve Martin and producer Robert Simonds, the successful teaming behind Cheaper by the Dozen, The Pink Panther had a production budget of US$80million.

It is 17 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Canada Bay. ==Transport== Mortlake sits on the southern bank of the Parramatta River and is home to the southern bank of the Mortlake Ferry or commonly known as the Putney Punt, the last surviving punt service in Sydney. Mortlake is also The Terminus for bus routes 439 & L39 (to Circular Quay via Five Dock Shops and Leichhardt) and 464 (to Ashfield railway station). ==History== Mortlake was originally known as Bottle Point. The suburb's name is derived from its namesake Mortlake, by the banks of the Thames in London. Parramatta River had been known as the 'Thames of the Antipodes' and other nearby suburbs were also named after Thames localities of Greenwich, Woolwich and Putney. Mortlake was notable as the site of the Australian Gas Light Company (AGL) gas works, which first purchased land here in 1883. Colliers from Newcastle or Hexham brought coal to the gasworks wharf at Mortlake. When a new Gladesville Bridge was opened in 1964, it was built to replace a bridge that needed to close every time the swing section on the southern end of the bridge had to be opened to permit large vessels to pass through. The gas works closed and the land redeveloped into the Breakfast Point residential development. During WWII, the Green Point Naval Boatyard at Mortlake assembled Fairmile B motor launches. Until 1948, an electric tramway connected Mortlake south to the suburbs of Burwood, Enfield and Ashfield.D. Keenan: Tramways of Sydney.

Mortdale is located 20 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district and is part of the St George area. Mortdale is situated in the local government area of Georges River Council. Mortdale extends south to Lime Kiln Bay, on the Georges River. Mortdale Heights is a locality in the western corner of the suburb. ==History== Mortdale has been known in the past as Mort's Road, Mort's Hill, Mort's Crossing, Mort's Township and Mort Dale. The suburb was named after Sydney industrialist Thomas Sutcliffe Mort (1816–1878) who was famous for pioneering the refrigeration of shipping meat and the construction of Mort's Dock, Balmain. Thomas Mort purchased the land from Robert Townson (1763–1827), who had been granted land in the Hurstville area with his brother John Townson. A small farming community started when the land around Mort's Road was subdivided into 17 farms. The Hurstville Steam Brick Company (better known as Judds Brickworks) was established in 1884 by William George Judd. The large brick-making chimneys were easily seen from around the district. The first residences were built opposite the Brickworks in 1885. The railway was extended through the district around the same time. The railway divided two of the main farms, Kemp's orange orchard and Parkes's farm near Victoria Avenue, and these were subdivided for housing by 1894. The official title for the suburb was set as Mortdale when the railway station opened with that name on 20 March 1897. The school opened in January 1889, and the post office and grocery store opened in November. Mortdale became a popular residential suburb in 1920s for soldiers returning from World War I.Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon (Angus and Robertson) 1990, page 178 In 1921, there was a movement for Mortdale to split from Hurstville and form a separate municipality. An official 1923 inquiry into the proposed Municipality of Mortdale decided against the change, despite the separation movement having the law behind them. At the same time there was also a push to have the name of Mortdale changed due to its similarity with the suburb of Mortlake and the association with its literal translation from Latin ('Valley of the Dead'). Suggestions by various groups over several years included: Leyton, Montrose, Morella, Kingrose and Boronia. A final list approved by the Department of Lands were: Carruthers, Princemead, Wyargine, and Storrieville, but the matter was never resolved.Mortdale in Early Days ==Commercial area== Mortdale consists mainly of residential dwellings with some commercial and industrial developments in the north-west corner. The main shopping centre is located on Morts Road and Pitt Street, near Mortdale railway station. Commercial and industrial developments are located along Boundary Road. A number of streets near the commercial area are named after notable streets in the Sydney CBD; These include: George Street, Martin Place, Pitt Street, Macquarie Place and Oxford Street.

The folk vernacular traditions diversified and spread across the nation, while a number of prominent composers of European art music also arose. ==Shape note== The sacred music of The First New England School of composers quickly spread south, facilitated by the invention of shape notes, a system in which four different note heads corresponded to the four syllables (fa, sol, la and mi) then used in musical instruction. In 1801, William Smith and William Little published The Easy Instructor, a sacred tunebook introducing this system. While the shape-note system itself never took root in New England, The Easy Instructor and similar collections were instrumental in spreading the music of New England composers to the western and southern states, where tunebook compilers added settings of folk and popular melodies (including \\"folk hymns\\" and revival choruses) to the popular New England repertory. Popular collections included Ananias Davisson's Kentucky Harmony (Harrisonburg, Virginia, 1817), Allen Carden's Missouri Harmony (Cincinnati, 1820), William Walker's Southern Harmony (1835) and B.F. White and E.J. King's Sacred Harp (1844). As the popularity of seven-syllable (doremi) solmization increased in the antebellum period, some teachers and publishers experimented with seven-character shape notes as well; the system of Jesse B. Aikin in The Christian Minstrel (Philadelphia, 1846) eventually won out in the years after the Civil War. ==African American music== ===Africans in Louisiana=== In Louisiana, drums remained legal well into the 19th century. There, African slaves, many from the Caribbean islands, danced in large groups, often in circle dances. As of 1817, dancing in New Orleans had been restricted to the area called Congo Square, which was a hotbed of musical fusionism, as African styles from across America and the Caribbean met. Nevertheless, by 1820, opposition from whites in New Orleans and an influx of blacks elsewhere in the U.S. caused the decline of Congo Square's prominence. The tradition of mass dances in Congo Square continued sporadically, though it came to have more in common with minstrelsy than with authentic African traditions. Caribbean dances known to have been imported to Louisiana include the calinda, congo, counjai and bamboula. The Congo had also been known earlier, mentioned as a social dance in colonial Richmond, Virginia. ===Spirituals=== In the 1830s, a Great Awakening of fervent Christianity began, leading to popular spiritual song traditions. During this period, the country was undergoing a religious revival that centered around outdoor worship gatherings (camp meetings), where hymns (camp songs) were sung, as well as itinerant preachers called circuit riders. The period began early in the century, with the first camp meeting occurring in July 1800 in Logan County, Kentucky. This was followed by an 1801 meeting in Cane Ridge, Kentucky which lasted for six days and attracted ten to twenty thousand people. Though originally run by Presbyterian ministers, Methodists and Baptists soon took over. Methodists brought with them hymns, written by John Wesley and his followers, which became very popular. Many songs were semi-improvised, stitched together out of wandering verses that were used in a number of different songs. The Shakers also played a role in the Great Awakening, and their music, which included both hymns and songs, began diversifying greatly during this period (1837–1848). The most well-known Shaker song, \\"Simple Gifts\\", by Joseph Brackett and adapted by Aaron Copland in Appalachian Spring), came from this period. Many of the new Shaker spirituals were called \\"gift songs\\", and were revealed to the initiate in a vision by the spirits of Mother Ann, the sect's founder, angels, other historical figures or other races, such as Native Americans. They were not written at first, but eventually the Shakers created their own form of musical notation, and composers like Issachar Bates became renowned. By the end of the 1840s, Shaker meetings were a popular entertainment for non-Shakers. African- Americans, still mostly enslaved, were not generally allowed to participate, they watched, and were inspired to use African vocal styles and rhythms with the English hymns. These songs were called Negro spirituals. While many were songs praising God or Jesus, others contained coded messages to fellow slaves and rhetoric or symbolically demanding freedom. Spirituals like \\"Steal Away To Jesus\\" communicated an impending escape, while \\"Let my people go\\" and \\"Go Down Moses\\" overtly concerned Biblical Hebrew slaves as a symbol for African slaves. Musically, spirituals were a descendant of New England choral traditions mixed with African rhythms and call-and-response forms. Shape-note hymns from the First New England School spread south, and were popular there long after New England had moved on. The hymns were simplified to the extreme, until they were nothing more than a tune and some religious lyrics; interacting with African American slave songs, the result was the spiritual tradition. ==Popularization of slave music== In the 1820s, genteel English- styled ballads were popular in urban areas. Many of the songwriters, however, were looking for something new, and were connected with the growing abolitionism movement, which sought to abolish slavery; these included most famously the Hutchinson Family Singers. The 1840s saw increased awareness of African American musical traditions, culminating in the publication of the first collection of African American songs, The Negro Singer's Own Book (1846). Some songwriters, including John Hill Hewitt and Stephen Foster, sought to incorporate what was then called Ethiopian music into their compositions. Songs with simple melodies and delicately incorporated ornamentations like suspensions and appoggiaturas were popular, including \\"Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair\\" and \\"Oh My Darling Clementine\\". These songs, especially those by Foster, could be considered the beginning of American popular music. It has been called beginning of the \\"increasing influence of the Afro-American style of song and dance in American life\\" (Stearns and Stearns, Jazz Dance, quoted in Chase, 232). ===Blues=== Following the Civil War, a form of song developed with some distinctive characteristics that may be of ancient origin, perhaps related to the call-and-response format. These songs consisted of three 4-bar phrases. The first two were identical and described a problem, beginning on the implied tonic and subdominant harmonies respectively. The third phrase indicates a reaction to the problem described and begins on the implied dominant harmony. All three phrases cadence on a sustained tonic occupying the third and fourth bar. ===American songwriters=== Main articles: Daniel Decatur Emmett and Stephen Foster Often said to be the first two important composers in American musical history, Emmett and Foster were songwriters, focusing on minstrel songs. They wrote many of the most popular songs of the century, some of which are still remembered today. Emmett was born in Ohio to a family who immigrated from Virginia. He was uneducated but musically gifted, and eventually wound up in the Virginia Minstrels. He was familiar the music of the southern states, and his songs reflected his awareness of southern culture. These included \\"Old Dan Tucker\\" and \\"De Boatman's Dance\\". Emmett's \\"Johnny Roach\\" includes the first use of the word Dixie to describe the south (Chase, 240). That song is one of several from the period written from the point of view of an escaped slave who pines for the plantation he has escaped from. Emmett wrote this song after joining Bryant's Minstrels in 1858, when tensions across the country were high, and controversy raged surrounding slavery, state's rights and the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act. Emmett's use of Dixie was as a personal name, given to a black postboy, and may have been used as to indicate that the character, played by a white actor, was in fact black. Emmett's later song \\"I Wish I Was in Dixie's Land\\", later popularized simply as \\"Dixie\\", was the beginning of the term's use to refer to the south. The song was an instant success, and soon became embroiled in a copyright dispute between several publishers. The song was so popular it was even played at the inauguration of Jefferson Davis, and was re-claimed as a patriotic northern song by Abraham Lincoln at the end of the war. Stephen Foster wrote numerous songs that remain well-known today, including \\"Camptown Races\\", \\"Oh! Susanna\\", \\"Old Folks at Home\\" and \\"Ching a Ring Chaw\\". The last, technically titled \\"Sambo's Address to He' Bred'rin\\", urges its audience to emigrate to \\"Hettee\\" (Haiti, perceived as a \\"Negro Republic\\" in the Western Hemisphere). Foster was born in 1826 to a farming family in Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. He played the piano as a youth and learned the rules of the \\"genteel\\", or upper-class traditions, though he was also fascinated by comin blackface songs. His first published composition was 1844's \\"Open Thy Lattice, Love\\", which was based on words by George Pope Morris and had previously been adapted for music by Joseph Philip Knight. In addition to the renowned blackface songs, Foster also wrote such parlor songs as \\"What Must a Fairy's Dream Be?\\" and \\"Molly! Do You Love Me?\\". ===Banjo=== The banjo entered the American national consciousness in the middle of the 19th century. Though originally only four-stringed, a five-stringed banjo was standard by the 1840s; this change is often credited to Virginia's only major blackface performer, Joel Walker Sweeney. The instrument is widely used in many kinds of African American folk music, though it was originally developed in Arabia, and is likely descended from one or more African or Asian instruments. It is now a major element of popular music, especially country and bluegrass. ==Brass bands== Band of the 10th Veteran Reserve Corps, Washington, D.C. April, 1865 The early 1850s saw a growth in the development of brass band music. Brass bands were made up of brass and woodwinds, especially the E-flat cornet and soprano saxhorn. Many of these bands were associated with an Army regiment, while others were associated with the workers at a particular factory. Employers urging their employees to form bands were common in the United Kingdom at the time, and the practice spread through immigration to the US. These factory bands' concerts were probably rowdy affairs, with musicians and listeners dancing wildly with no spatial split between them. British bands were all amateurs, but America produced many professional ensembles as well. John C. Linehan described the spirit of American brass bands, and specifically the Fisherville Cornet Band, formed immediately before the Civil War: :(The band's) engagement by the Horse Guards, although a matter of pride, was nevertheless an occasion of dismay, for the boys for the first time in their lives had to play on horseback. As nearly all of them were novices in this direction the outlook was serious, for it is a question if there were half a dozen of the number that had ever straddled a horse. When the proposition was first broached in the band room, one of the saddest looking men was the leader, Loren Currier. He said he would vote to accept on one condition, and that was if a horse could be secured large enough to have them all ride together and give him a place in the middle. The proposition was, however, accepted. . . . It was a moving sight (the moving was all towards the ground, however), and the bucking broncos of the Wild West Show furnished no more sport, while it lasted, than did the gallant equestrians of the Fisherville Band while trying to train their horses to march and wheel by fours. Besides the English tradition, German, Italian and Irish immigrants also had a major impact on the American brass band tradition. Forty-two professional German musicians, for example, formed the Seventh Regiment Band, one of the most famous brass bands during the 1850s and the only exclusively regimental band of the period; the bandleader, who went by the name Noll, used brass and reed instruments in duo proportion. German bandleader Friendrich Wilhelm Wieprecht was also influential, collecting full scores for his compilation of instrumentations of popular works, für die jetzige Stimmenbesetzung. Instruments included the bassoon, contrabassoon, bass tuba, trumpet, trombone, clarinet, piccolo, oboe, French horn, saxhorn, drums and cymbals. Wieprecht was recognized at the time as a key figure in the reorganization of the Prussian military bands in meticulous, regimented detail and strict rules of conduct, rehearsal and musicianship. The Italian influence on American brass bands is perhaps best demonstrated by Francis Scala, a Naples-born immigrant who led the U.S. Marine Band. He was a clarinetist who always placed his instrument prominently in his band, and is largely responsible for popularizing the instrument in brass bands. Irish bandleader Patrick Sarsfield Gilmore was also influential, having introduced a wide range of reed instruments as well as developing instrumentation that allowed a large wind ensemble to approximate the effects of a full orchestra. With the coming of the Civil War, the popularity of brass bands continued to grow. Promises of a famous band being attached to a regiment were used to induce recruitment, and the brass band tradition flourished. Following the war, huge peace jubilee concerts were held, where thousands of performers sometimes played. ==Music of other immigrant communities== ===Creole and Cajun music=== The city of New Orleans has long been a center for cultural innovation, and the pre-eminent city of the Gulf Coast. It is fitting, then, that the first major American classical composer was from New Orleans -- Louis Moreau Gottschalk. Gottschalk achieved fame in Europe, the first American composer to do so, and is well- remembered for his fusion of themes from ethnic folk dances in Louisiana into his piano compositions. With French-Canadians from Acadia, white settlers of Scots-Irish, French and Spanish descent, Native Americans and an abundance of slaves from the West Indies, New Orleans and the surrounding area was a cultural melting pot. ===Mexican-Texans=== Texas was part of Mexico until the mid-19th century, after the Mexican–American War, and its Mexican-American inhabitants played a mixture of ranchera, bolero and polka music called conjunto. To some extent an American version of accordion-led Mexican música norteña, conjunto was popular throughout Mexican communities in Texas. ==Sound samples== Bice'waan Song is a recording from the Library of Congress, collected by Alice Cunningham Fletcher and Francis La Flesche and published in 1897. The singer is George Miller, who was probably born in about 1852. It was described as: \\"The true love-song, called by the Omaha Bethae waan, an old designation and not a descriptive name, is sung generally in the early morning, when the lover is keeping his tryst and watching for the maiden to emerge from the tent and go to the spring. They belong to the secret courtship and are sometimes called Me-the-g'thun wa-an—courting songs. ... They were sung without drum, bell or rattle, to accent the rhythm, in which these songs is subordinated to tonality and is felt only in the musical phrases. ... Vibrations for the purpose of giving greater expression were not only affected by the tremolo of the voice, but they were enhanced by waving the hand, or a spray of artemesia before the lips, while the body often swayed gently to the rhythm of the song (Fletcher, 1894, p. 156).\\" ==References== * Struble, John Warthen.

Unlike italic type, however, it does not use different glyph shapes; it uses the same glyphs as roman type, except slanted. Oblique and italic type are technical terms to distinguish between the two ways of creating slanted font styles; oblique designs may be labelled italic by companies selling fonts or by computer programs. Oblique designs may also be called slanted or sloped roman styles. Oblique fonts, as supplied by a font designer, may be simply slanted, but this is often not the case: many have slight corrections made to them to give curves more consistent widths, so they retain the proportions of counters and the thick-and-thin quality of strokes from the regular design. Type designers have described oblique type as less organic and calligraphic than italics, which in some situations may be preferred. Contemporary type designer Jeremy Tankard stated that he had avoided a true italic 'a' and 'e' in his design Bliss due to finding them \\"too soft\\", while Hoefler and Frere-Jones have described obliques as more \\"keen and insistent\\". ==Obliques and italics== A simply slanted (L) and corrected (R) example of oblique type. Italic designs are not just the slanted version of the regular (roman) style; they are influenced by handwriting, with a single- storey a and an f that descends below the line of text. Some may even link up, like cursive (joined-up) handwriting. Obliques by contrast are \\"simply\\" sloped. In addition, italic styles are often quite noticeably narrower than roman type, while oblique styles are not. ===Specific typefaces=== Few typefaces have both oblique and italic designs, as this is generally a fundamental design choice about how the font should look. A font designer normally decides to design their font with one or the other. ===Serif fonts=== Norwegian banknote of 1807. Serif typefaces with an oblique are rare, but the Central Type Foundry's \\"De Vinne\\" (the words \\"American Lining System\\" in this specimen) is an early exception. Historically, it was normal for all Latin-alphabet serif fonts to have true italics, but in the late nineteenth century some \\"sloped romans\\" were created by European and American foundries, particularly for display type and headings. Notable typefaces in this style include Bookman Old Style in metal type (although not many recent versions), Linn Boyd Benton's \\"self-spacing\\" type and the Central Type Foundry's \\"De Vinne\\" wedge-serif display face. European examples included Genzsch Antiqua from Genzsch & Heyse. Almost all modern serif fonts have true italic designs. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a number of type foundries such as American Type Founders and Genzsch & Heyse offered serif typefaces with oblique rather than italic designs, especially display typefaces, but these designs (such as Genzsch Antiqua) have mostly disappeared. An exception is American Type Founders' Bookman, offered in some releases with the oblique of its metal type version. An unusual example of an oblique font from the inter-war period is the display face Koch Antiqua. With a partly oblique lower case, it also makes the italic capitals inline in the style of blackletter capitals in the larger sizes of the metal type. It was developed by Rudolph Koch, a type designer who had previously specialised in to blackletter font design (which does not use italics); Walter Tracy described his design as \\"uninhibited by the traditions of roman and italic\\". The printing historian and artistic director Stanley Morison was for a time in the inter-war period interested in the oblique type style, which he felt stood out in text less than a true italic and should supersede it. He argued in his article Towards an Ideal Italic that serif book typefaces should have as the default sloped form an oblique and as a complement a script typeface where a more decorative form was preferred. He made an attempt to promote the idea by commissioning the typeface Perpetua from Eric Gill with a sloped roman rather than an italic, but came to find the style unattractive; Perpetua's italic when finally issued had the conventional italic 'a', 'e' and 'f'. Monotype Imaging: Perpetua Morison wrote to his friend, type designer Jan van Krimpen, that in developing Perpetua's italic \\"we did not give enough slope to it. When we added more slope, it seemed that the font required a little more cursive to it.\\" A few other type designers replicated his approach for a time: van Krimpen's Romulus and William Addison Dwiggins' Electra were both released with obliques. Morison's Times New Roman typeface has a very traditional true italic in the style of the late eighteenth century, which he later wryly commented owed \\"more to Didot than dogma\\". ===Sans-serif fonts=== Many sans- serif typefaces use plainer oblique designs instead of italic ones. This is especially true with grotesque designs like Helvetica, which have a spare, industrial aesthetic, and geometric ones like Futura. (As many sans-serif fonts were intended for use on headings and posters, especially early ones, some were not designed with italics at all because these were considered unnecessary.) italics\\". News Gothic, a 1908 grotesque design, has an oblique. Gothic Italic no. 124, an 1890s grotesque, has a crisp true italic resembling Didone serif families of the period. Seravek, a modern humanist family, has a more informal italic in the style of handwriting. Humanist sans-serif typefaces, however, often use true italic styles since they are more influenced by calligraphy and traditional serif fonts. Notable humanist sans- serif typefaces include Gill Sans, Goudy Sans, FF Meta and FF Scala Sans; all have italic designs. Adrian Frutiger and other prominent designers have defended obliques as more appropriate for the aesthetic of sans-serif fonts, while Martin Majoor has supported the use of true italics. ==Automated obliques, or \\"fake italics\\"== Some computer programs handling text may simply generate an oblique form, a \\"fake italic\\", by slanting the normal font when they find no italic or oblique style installed. It may not be clear to the user where the oblique form comes from (whether it is a correctly installed oblique font or an automatically slanted design, which may look worse) unless they check their installed fonts. Slanting the regular style to create an oblique was particularly often done on early computer and phototypesetting systems in the 1970s and -80s to save time and memory space, especially in lower-quality printing of ephemera and newspapers. ==See also== * ==References== ==Notes== ==External links== * Typographica: Ain't What ITC Used to Be * Compare \\"Univers 65 Bold Oblique\\" and \\"Univers 66 Bold Italic\\" * CSS font-style: oblique vs italic\\" Category:Typography ","title":"Oblique type"},{"id":"2581456","text":"Woy Woy Bay in the early 1900s Woy Woy is a coastal town in the Central Coast region of New South Wales, Australia, located on the southern reaches of Brisbane Water north of Sydney. It is an important population centre within the local government area. Woy Woy is located in the northern half of the Woy Woy Peninsula, a densely populated estuarine peninsula that also includes the districts of Umina Beach, Ettalong Beach, Booker Bay and Blackwall, in addition to several small sub-districts. The Woy Woy Peninsula is the most populous area of the Central Coast. The historical and commercial core of Woy Woy is located around the railway station at the northern tip of the peninsula while its residential districts merge imperceptibly southwards with Umina and Ettalong. (Woy Woy officially ends at Veron Road and Gallipoli Avenue; and Umina begins beyond this.) Woy Woy is considered a dormitory town or commuter town of Sydney. ==History== ===Origin of name=== The double name is a corruption of the indigenous term apparently taken from the local Darkinjung Aboriginal people, and reputedly means 'big lagoon' or 'much water', referring to the deep tidal channel adjacent to the town centre. It was originally known as Webb's Flat, named for James Webb, the first European settler of the Brisbane Water region in 1823, and was first explored by a party led by Governor Arthur Phillip in 1789. ===Small coastal settlement=== Electrification of the Main Northern rail line running through Woy Woy to Gosford in 1960 prompted rapid residential development in and around Woy Woy in the 1960s and 1970s as its relatively low-priced properties became an important part of the Sydney commuter belt, with rail journey times of just over an hour to reach Sydney's central business district. In December 1948, there were private enterprise plans announced to develop 1259 acres of light industrial land, 800 acres of accompanying housing, a railway connection with the existing main line and the conversion of the World War II era airstrip at Ettalong Beach into an airport. If the concept had proceeded all costs would have been covered by the developer, including water, sewerage and other amenities. At the time it was predicted that up to 50,000 jobs would have been developed within 10 to 25 years. The $24 million Peninsula Leisure Centre opened on 29 October 2005 after significant delays. == Heritage listings == Woy Woy has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Woy Woy Road: Woy Woy Tunnel ==Population== According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 10,643 people in Woy Woy. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 4.7% of the population. * 76.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 4.7%, New Zealand 1.7% and China 1.2%. * 86.5% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin at 1.3%. * The most common responses for religion were No Religion 27.5%, Catholic 25.6% and Anglican 22.6%. ==Schools== Woy Woy has one Catholic school, St John the Baptist Primary School, located in Dulkara Road, Woy Woy. Schooling offered by the Sisters of St. Joseph commenced in Woy Woy in 1922 at the original St John the Baptist Church (Parish hall since 2007) located on the corner of Blackwall and Victoria Roads, Woy Woy.St John the Baptist Primary School Official websiteSt John The Baptist Catholic Parish Official website There are also two public primary schools, Woy Woy South and Woy Woy, with the senior campus of Brisbane Water Secondary College also located within Woy Woy. ==Business== Woy Woy comprises 34,000 square metres of commercially zoned land of which 60% consists of retail businesses together with a mix of professional services and major supermarkets including Deepwater Plaza and Peninsula Plaza. Woy Woy represents the commercial heart of the Peninsula and vital commuter transport hub. The town centre is enhanced by the Woy Woy waterfront precinct and Woy Woy Channel with ferry links to Davistown. The Woy Woy commercial centre is represented by the Peninsula Chamber of Commerce which is an affiliated member of the NSW Business Chamber. Woy Woy is recognised as the commercial hub of the Peninsula accommodating numerous legal practices, medical centres, banks and professionals. It is largely focused around the Woy Woy Rail Station (major transport hub) and bus interchange with a heavy retail concentration at Deepwater Plaza shopping centre on western edge of the commercial centre and Peninsula Plaza adjacent to the heritage listed Woy Woy Library. Small cafés and restaurants have clustered along the Woy Woy waterfront adjacent to the heritage listed Bayview Hotel and Woy Woy Hotel on Brickwharf Road. The traditional main street (Blackwall Road) has struggled in recent years from pressure from the major shopping centres and the resurgence of the thriving Umina Beach town centre. ==Culture== An annual Brisbane Water Oyster Festival is held on the first Sunday in November at Ettalong Beach after being relocated from the Woy Woy waterfront in 2005 due to space restrictions. The event outgrew the location with over 20,000 people attending annually. The \\"Brisbane Water\\" Oyster Festival was inaugurated in 2000 and is organised by the Peninsula Chamber of Commerce. The Woy Woy Little Theatre Company perform four plays every year at The Peninsula Theatre, the sister theatre to Laycock Street Theatre in Gosford. Performances are generally based on strict plays rather than devised or improvised theatre forms and have been doing so since 1962. After their retirement, the parents and younger brother of comedian Spike Milligan (1918–2002) moved to Woy Woy; as a result, Spike spent some time in the town and was occasionally jocularly referred to as \\"the boy from Woy Woy\\". Woy Woy was the home to the now defunct festival known as \\"Spike Fest\\", which celebrated Milligan's life and works. Milligan famously named Woy Woy \\"the largest above ground cemetery in the world\\" when visiting in the 1960s. He made numerous references to Woy Woy in the radio series The Idiot Weekly. In July 2007, a new cycle bridge near Woy Woy was named the \\"Spike Milligan Bridge\\" Another internationally known resident of Woy Woy was Olive Riley (1899–2008), of the Woy Woy Community Nursing Home, who became recognised as the world's oldest known blogger. From February 2007, aged 107, she started an internet blog and also appeared in a number of YouTube videos.List of Olive Riley's YouTube videos. (YouTube search page.) Her last post was made on 26 June 2008, two and a half weeks prior to her death on 12 July, aged 108. ==Notable residents== * Graham Eadie (born 1953) Australian Rugby League and Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles great known as Wombat. * Minard Fannie Crommelin M.B.E. (1881–1972), postmistress and environmental conservationist, spent 5 years as postmistress in Woy Woy. * Megan Anderson (born 1974), International Netball player, grew up in Woy Woy. * Karise Eden, winner of the first season of TV singing competition The Voice. * Ray Hall, (born 1980), former Australian rules football player * Spike Milligan (Terence Alan Milligan 1918-2002) British Irish comedian, writer and actor lived in Woy Woy with his parents for periods of time in the 1960s. * John Monie, Rugby League coach and player grew up in Woy Woy. * Mark Gregory Pegg (born 1963), world-renowned medieval historian and author, now based in US. * Janice Petersen, (born 1977), television presenter, grew up in Woy Woy. * Olive Riley (1899–2008), second oldest online blogger and YouTube user. * Josh Ross (born 1981), Indigenous track-and-field Olympian, from the age of seven attended Woy Woy Public School. * Simon Townsend (born 1945), journalist, television host and presenter, spent some time in Woy Woy. * Liesl Tesch (born 1969), wheelchair Basketball player ,sailor and politician, lives in Woy Woy. ==Sports== Woy Woy is also home to several sporting teams which compete in Central Coast competitions, including the Roosters (rugby league - competed in Sydney's Jim Beam Cup, but not any more), Sharks (cricket), Woy Woy FC (since 1965) (football), Lions (rugby union) and the Peninsula Swans (Australian rules). Woy Woy is also home to the Woy Woy Tennis Club, one of the oldest Tennis clubs on the Central Coast. ==Churches== *St Luke's Anglican Church *St John the Baptist Catholic Church *PeninsulaEV Church ==Transport== Woy Woy railway station's waterfront location. Woy Woy railway station is on the NSW TrainLink network. It is a major commuter hub which moves significant numbers of local workers into Sydney and Newcastle each day. The station is also a major bus interchange with Busways services connecting Woy Woy with other Peninsula centres including Umina Beach and Ettalong Beach. Central Coast Ferries services also operate from the Woy Woy wharf connecting with villages around Brisbane Water including Davistown. ==See also== * List of reduplicated Australian place names ==References== ==External links== *Geographical and historical information Category:Suburbs of the Central Coast (New South Wales) Category:Towns in New South Wales Category:Central Coast Council (New South Wales) ","title":"Woy Woy, New South Wales"},{"id":"2581463","text":"Minto Heights is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 50 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Campbelltown. It is part of the Macarthur region. ==History== The Tharawal people were the original inhabitants of the region. The open space of the blocks hints at the farming history of the area while the larger homes being built the suburb point to a more recent change in land use.Liston, C: Campbelltown: The Bicentennial History, Allen & Unwin, 1988: p.1-2. The bushland began to be cleared in the late 19th century to be replaced by orchards and other small farms. The area escaped major subdivision during Campbelltown's population boom of the 1970s when the Council zoned the suburb a \\"Scenic Protection Area\\" with minimum land sizes of . Until then, the area was known as East Minto and, like its neighbour, was named after the Earl of Minto, Gilbert Elliot-Murray- Kynynmound, who was Viceroy of India from 1807–1814. In 1973, Campbelltown Council proposed changing the name to Warby, which was rejected by locals who insisted it be called East Minto. This, in turn, was rejected by the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales, which had a policy against \\"East\\" and other compass points being added to suburb names. Eastminto, Myrtlefield, Hansen and Kyngmount were also rejected by one side or the other until consensus was reached with Minto Heights in 1976. ==References== ==External links== * [CC-By-SA] * [CC-By-SA] Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:City of Campbelltown (New South Wales) ","title":"Minto Heights, New South Wales"},{"id":"2581467","text":"The latter part of the 19th century saw the increased popularization of African American music and the growth and maturity of folk styles like the blues. ==African American music== ===Rag=== In the 1890s, more sophisticated African-American styles of the cakewalk and then ragtime music started to become popular. Originally associated primarily with poor African Americans, ragtime was quickly denounced as degenerate by conservatives and the classically trained establishment. In spite of the denigration, however, the style continued to gain widespread popularity and became mainstream; it was adopted by Tin Pan Alley at the start of the 20th century. Ragtime shared similarities with both blues and jazz, the two rival forms of African American music at the time. It was primarily piano-based, and could be performed by a single person (more like the blues) or by an entire orchestra (more like jazz). Scott Joplin was the most famous ragtime musician. Rag also shares strong similarities with German polka music, with the strong emphasis on beats 2 and 4. Both styles also rely upon 7th and 9th chords, resulting in a more sophisticated harmonic palette. From the Caribbean islands and other sources, Rag adopted strong syncopations in both the left and right hands of piano music. ==Minstrelsy== Solo performers in blackface were well known by the middle of the 19th century. Similar parodies of Africans had been popular during the late 18th century in England, and they spread across the Atlantic through the efforts of comedians like Charles Mathews, Thomas Rice and George Washington Dixon. Rice remains perhaps the best known, chiefly through the historical importance of his \\"Jump Jim Crow\\". The first minstrel group was probably the Virginia Minstrels, who performing in 1843 in New York City (Chase, 232), though E. P. Christy's four-man show in Buffalo, New York the year before is another contender. Many other groups soon followed, usually using a banjo, violin, castanets and tambourine. Thomas Rice and other blackface entertainers adapted to minstrelsy; Rice wrote operas like Bone Squash Diavolo before his popularity declined in the 1850s. Another minstrel opera group was the Kneass Opera Troupe, which did blackface parodies of Rossini's La Cenerentola, Balfe's The Bohemian Girl and Auber's Fra Diavolo. These parodies were given titles like Son-Am-Bull-Ole for a parody of Bellini's La somnambula, the invented title being a humorous reference to the violinist Ole Bull. Minstrel shows spread to London by 1846m and remained a major fixture in London until at least the 1880s. ===Black minstrels=== Banjo player Horace Weston By the end of the civil war, minstrel groups had appeared featuring actual black performers. Though their styles were no more similar to actual slave practices than those of the white minstrels, these groups billed themselves as more \\"authentic\\" and grew popular. Since many of the performers were light-skinned, black performers still rubbed their faces in cork, and entertained in blackface. This practice peaked in about 1872, having produced such stars as banjoist Horace Weston and comedian Billy Kersand. ===Blackface=== A component of minstrel shows, blackface performances included white (or, more rarely, African American) singers dressed in bizarre costumes, their faces marked black with burnt cork, singing in a caricature of African American Vernacular English. Composers included E. P. Christy, Daniel Decatur Emmett and Thomas Rice; the latter's \\"Jump Jim Crow\\" was an immensely popular song, so well known and widely played that foreign leaders mistook it for the American national anthem. Other songs typically performed in blackface included \\"Camptown Races\\", \\"Old Dan Tucker\\", \\"Dixie\\", \\"Old Folks at Home\\", \\"Old Black Joe\\", \\"Turkey in the Straw\\" and \\"O Dem Golden Slippers\\". ==Military marches== Military-style march music enjoyed great popularity, and most towns had brass bands that performed this genre of music. The most popular of the U.S. march composers were John Philip Sousa, Henry Fillmore, and Karl King. Patrick Sarsfield Gilmore was, in many minds, on par with Sousa. Some though more highly of Gilmore than of Sousa. Both men composed works for bands, and for other ensembles. Military music was not a significant source of entertainment in the U.S. until after the Civil War. After the War ended, many of the bands dispersed and their members surely influenced musical activities in their home towns. During and after the War military band performed in parades, in outdoor concerts, and at encampment (reunions for veterans). The band gazebo was an architectural invention so that bands could perform outdoors with some protection against the weather. The motion picture \\"The Music Man\\" is based upon detailed research into the rise of small city bands in the midwest. Prior to military and later community bands, little organized music making was available in small towns due to cost, and many other factors. With the increased demand for wind instruments, east coast U.S. musical instrument manufactures began heavily marketing their wares and the wares of European manufacturers throughout much of the U.S. To assist in marketing their wares (instruments, sheet music, etc.), many regional music houses began publishing music periodicals. Community bands continued until around World War I. By World War II, community bands had suffered significant declines. Cost, changing musical tastes, and the introduction of radio and record players undercut public interest in community bands. ==Eastern European immigrants== Starting in the 1880s, Eastern European Jews immigrated to the US in large numbers. They brought with them klezmorim, or musicians who played klezmer music at weddings and other community events. Soon, the United States became the international center for klezmer music, and it became a major influence on jazz and other genres. Into the 20th century, immigration from Italy, Ireland, Armenia, China, Germany, Finland and elsewhere was widespread. Most of these immigrant communities kept their folk traditions alive. Some produced musicians of great stature, such as Ukrainian fiddler Pawlo Humeniuk in the 1920s and 1930s. Much later, Armenian oud player Richard Hagopian also became popular at home and abroad. The Slovenian polka master, Frankie Yankovic, has had perhaps more crossover success than these other stars; his period of greatest popularity was in the 1940s. In addition to peoples immigrating to the United States, many of Europe's finest musicians, singers, and actors, toured heavily in the United States. Jenny Lind, Ole Bull, Enrico Caruso, and Oscar Wilde made highly publicized tours often to great acclaim. ==Composers and conductors== During the 19th century, many composers born in the U.S. traveled to Europe for the music education. They then returned to the U.S. and shared their knowledge of the latest European styles. As such, many of these composers wrote in typical styles of the time. Louis Moreau Gottschalk was one such composer who outpaced many of his contemporaries. His associate Charles Kunkel - who often performed duets with Gottschalk while on tour - was a composer in his own right. Theodore Thomas (conductor) was considered to be a leading conductor during the 1880s and 1890s. Thomas too championed works by leading European composers. He also conducted works by leading U.S. composers. Today, the vast majority of 19th century U.S. composers are all but lost to history. This was also the era when women composers and African American composers started to see their music published in increased numbers. ==Tin Pan Alley== In the later decades of the 19th century, the music industry became dominated by a group of publishers and song-writers in New York City that came to be known as Tin Pan Alley. Tin Pan Alley's representatives spread throughout the country, buying local hits for their publishers and pushing their publisher's latest songs. Song demonstrators were fixtures at department stores and music stores across the country, and traveling song demonstrators made circuits of rural areas. The industry was driven by the profits from the sales of sheet music. A piano was considered a must in any middle-class or higher home. Major 19th century Tin Pan Alley hits included \\"Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage\\" and \\"After the Ball Is Over\\". ==References== *Struble, John Warthen.
