His style of gospel-centered songs range from pop to folk to gospel and they all embrace a childlike simplicity. Lenny is best known in Christian music circles for writing the international worship standard \\"Our God Reigns\\" in 1973. Many popular Christian artists have covered this song including Phil Driscoll, Evie Tornquist, John Michael Talbot, Jimmy Swaggart, The Gaithers, Ken Copeland, New Life Worship, Carlton Pearson, Dana, LifeWay, and Marilla Hess, Word, Integrity Music, PTL, Maranatha! Music and Brentwood/Benson and Ronn Huff. In 2010, \\"Our God Reigns\\" was sung during the Papal Mass for Pope Benedict XVI in Bellahouston Park. It was a favorite of Pope John Paul II and was used during his visit in 1999 to North America and during a few of his convocations in South America.  Early life and education  Leonard Earl Smith Jr. was born in 1942 in Philadelphia, PA, at the Naval Hospital. He is the only son and second child of a career military father (U.S. Marine Corps) and a Catholic mother. Their family moved frequently, living in Philadelphia, Virginia, California, North Carolina, Guam, and finally settled in South Jersey. In 1960, Lenny left New Jersey and entered Jordan Evangelical Theological Seminary in Menominee, Michigan. He then attended Mount St. Paul Seminary in Waukesha, Wisconsin. His last four years were spent at Mount Saint Mary's Seminary in Emmitsburg, MD., where he studied for the Catholic priesthood. He received his B.A. in Classical Philosophy in 1965. He pursued a master's in English Literature at Villanova, but never completed it. In 1968, Lenny left the seminary and taught high school at Paul VI High School in Haddon Township, NJ. He was a guidance counselor for the freshman class. At the end of the year he was asked to leave; the reason given by the principal was a strained working relationship. Earlier in the year, a freshman girl's grades dropped from straight A's to D's and Lenny called her into his office to see what was going on. After finding out that the girl was being sexually abused by the science teacher, Lenny addressed the issue with the principal, forcing him to dismiss the science teacher. At the end of the year, Lenny was also dismissed. In 1969, Lenny taught religion at Gloucester Catholic High School in Gloucester, NJ. This year was wonderful and very satisfying, but he wanted to teach at a public school, so the following year he taught Latin and English at Cinnaminson High School in Cinnaminson, NJ. This was the year Lenny got involved with the Charismatic Movements and had a dramatic spiritual awakening. He became a bit of a fanatic and decided to teach his regular course material Monday through Thursday, but taught the Bible every Friday, even though many of the kids attending this public school were Jewish. The kids loved the Bible classes but in a couple of months three sets of parents came in to complain. Lenny refused to stop and at the end of the year, he was let go. In 1970, he returned to Gloucester Catholic High School, teaching religion. Instead of sticking with just the standard curriculum, he brought his guitar to class, sang, prayed, and read the Bible, having \\"little\\" revivals at times in the classroom. Once a month, Lenny held a prayer gathering in town for his students in an auditorium. Lenny thought it was a huge success, but the priests were worried he was starting a cult. At the end of the year, Lenny was let go. Lenny started painting houses and doing carpentry. In 1972 he started teaching religion at Bishop Eustace Preparatory School in Cherry Hill, NJ. He continued to bring his guitar to class and led mass in the chapel. The head of the religion department refused to let Lenny teach that Jesus was the only Messiah. He wanted Lenny to teach that there were many messiahs, like Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi. When Lenny refused, he was forced to resign. He went back to painting houses and eventually expanded to remodeling and building houses. He did that for 35 years—the whole time writing songs at night and leading worship on Sundays with his '69 Gibson J45 guitar at various churches.  Music career   Early career  In 1965, at Mount Saint Mary's Seminary, Lenny started writing songs for the guitar masses that were being introduced at the seminary. The first song he wrote is called, \\"The New Jerusalem\\". He introduced it in the chapel in 1965 which was received with mixed feelings. Slowly, Lenny introduced more original songs which were well received. In 1967, Lenny left the seminary, but continued to lead mass at different Catholic churches. In 1969, Lenny and his wife Marian became involved in the Catholic Charismatic Movement, which involved expressive worship, dancing, and speaking in tongues. In 1970, they attended a Protestant Charismatic Church in Philadelphia called The Gospel Temple, which was a multi-cultural church lead by Pastor John Poole. An off-shoot was formed in New Jersey called, the \\"Living Word Community,\\" where Lenny led worship for two years. Lenny resigned over great concern about the church's embrace of the doctrine and practice of \\"shepherding,\\" also called \\"discipling.\\" this pyramid-like leadership model eventually imploded.  Our God Reigns  In 1973, Lenny was out of work and mildly depressed. One morning he read Isaiah 52:7 from the Bible, \\"How lovely on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news....\\" He was so moved and encouraged by the passage that he wrote \\"Our God Reigns\\" in five minutes—one verse and the chorus. Bob Mumford, a traveling evangelist, visited The Living Word in NJ and heard Lenny sing \\"Our God Reigns.\\" Bob loved the song and taught it at each church and conference he visited all over the world during the next couple of years. An Australian company, Scripture in Song, released a songbook 1979 called \\"Scripture in Song Volume I\\" which included two of Lenny's songs--\\"Our God Reigns\\" (which they entitled \\"How Lovely on the Mountains\\") and \\"City O City.\\" This songbook was sold and brought world-wide attention to these songs. A Catholic Prayer community in Ann Arbor, MI. also released a songbook and album which brought much attention to the song. \\"Our God Reigns\\" became extremely popular in England. A pastor in England decided to add additional verses to the song, which at the time only had one verse. Lenny contacted him, asking him not to add additional verses and the pastor insisted he would anyway. To this day, in the UK the version of \\"Our God Reigns\\" is known with the pastor's additional verses. This motivated Lenny to write the next four verses which took a couple of years to finish. \\"Our God Reigns\\" is still being used and circulated today around the world. It has been recorded on over 55 albums and printed in 35 songbooks and hymnals and exists in over 20 languages.In 2010, \\"Our God Reigns\\" was sung for the Papal Procession at Bellahouston Park in Glasgow, Scotland.  Papal Procession  Lenny received four different phone calls regarding papal masses in which they would use \\"Our God Reigns\\" in large gatherings. Pope John Paul II had said that \\"Our God Reigns\\" was his favorite contemporary liturgical song in English. The song became a consistent part of the Catholic Songbooks and Hymnals and Missalettes. In 2010, \\"Our God Reigns\\" was sung for the Papal Procession at Bellahouston Park in Glasgow, Scotland. Evie also sang the song at a Papal Mass in UK  Broadening His Ministry  Lenny was raised Protestant even though his mother was a devout Catholic. His mother Marie would attend mass each Sunday but drop her three children off at the local Protestant church at the insistence of her non-religious husband. When Lenny was 12, he started to attend the Catholic church with his mother, after his father left them. He became fascinated by Catholicism and entered the seminary after high school to study for the priesthood in 1960. In 1969 Lenny became involved with the Catholic Charismatics. He would intermingle with the Protestant Charismatics and the Pentecostals at this time because the groups were interested in the same things. He visited The Gospel Temple, a Protestant charismatic church in Philadelphia, and that became his church home for the next several years.  Musical style  Smith is known for his smooth voice and his folk-style guitar playing. His songs are an equal mix of country/folk/and rock filled with scripture and are known for their simplicity, singability, and joy. Lenny plays a 1969 Gibson J45 guitar which he bought brand new in 1969.  Personal life  Smith married his wife Marian in 1970. He and Marian have five children-- Daniel, Rachel, Megan, David, and Andrew. Their oldest son Daniel formed the band \\"Danielson Famile\\" or \\"Danielson\\" in which all five children perform. Daniel also started a record label called Sounds Familyre Records. Their eldest daughter Rachel also writes and records worship music on Great Comfort Records. Leaving behind his five years of teaching high school, Lenny became a carpenter and homebuilder for the next 35 years. After retiring from carpentry, he is still working with his music and his label Great Comfort Records and his publishing company New Jerusalem Music.

Seiter, and starring Douglas MacLean, John Steppling, Margaret Loomis, William Courtright, Emily Gerdes, and Eugene Burr. The film was released by First National Pictures on January 19, 1923. Plot As described in a film magazine, college graduate Harry Elrod (MacLean) wishes to marry actress Kitty Clyde (Loomis), but his Uncle Ellrey Elrod (Steppling) has picked out Angela Fish (Gerdes) as a wife for his nephew. Harry arranges an elopement with Kitty. His uncle's suspicions are aroused and he trails Harry continuously. Miss Fish and her father the Reverend Doctor Wilbur Fish (Courtright) call. Harry in desperation starts a fire in his room. He is rescued by the fire brigade and then stages a run through the streets in the fire chief's car, intending to catch another train and follow Kitty. He escapes the pursuing firemen, boards the train, and arrives safely at the Philadelphia hotel where Kitty will meet him. There he finds that she has changed her mind, coming to believe that he must have his uncle's consent. He then receives a telegram from his uncle, disowning him. Broke, Harry takes a job as a hotel bell boy. In uniform, he enters where Kitty is dining with Mr. Haskell (Steers), her press agent, and sits down, but is dragged away by the indignant hotel manager. Uncle Ellrey comes to the hotel but is shown the wrong room by Harry, so he demands that Harry be fired. The manager, ever ready to make a guest happy, is ready to oblige him, but Harry turns Bolshevist and induces the entire hotel staff to go on strike. The end result is that the uncle is defeated, and Harry wins Kitty.

He became the first Chair of Sculpture at the Slade School of Art in London. He was known for his painstakingly precise sculptures resulting from elaborate and time-consuming processes for achieving sculptural realism. He emerged from the same roots as the \\"New Sculpture\\" in Britain, and his career runs parallel to (and in dialogue with) that movement.  Biography  Thomas first studied at the Bristol School of Art, then at South Kensington. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1872. In 1879, he went to Paris to study at the École des Beaux-Arts under Pierre-Jules Cavelier. In 1885, he exhibited his marble statue Slave Girl to much acclaim in London. Thomas was associated with the New English Art Club and its attempts to reform the Royal Academy of Arts. In 1887-88, he served as Secretary for the Provisional Committee for Securing a Suffrage in the National Exhibition of the Arts, and this prominent role insured that Thomas would never be elected to the Royal Academy for the remainder of his career. Soon after the failed attempt to reform the academicians, in 1889, Thomas departed for Italy. He lived in Naples, Valle di Pompeii, and, most extensively, Capri, where he studied the lives of peasants, while also designing a system by which he could accurately determine the three- dimensional representation of the human form. He became a fixture of the expatriate community in Capri, and he was the inspiration for the character of Count Caloveglia in Norman Douglas's novel South Wind (1917). In keeping with his disdain for the Royal Academy, Thomas repudiated the techniques of academic sculpture. Instead, he developed an elaborate system to accurately measure the complex topography of the human body and to translate it into a three-dimensional medium. Taxingly for his models, Thomas would take weeks to minutely map the human body using an armature that allowed him to translate the complex forms into a numerical system which, in turn, allowed it to be recreated in a sculptural material (his preference came to be wax over mahogany). James Havard Thomas, Lycidas, 1902-08, London, Tate Thomas resettled in London in 1906. Upon returning to Britain, his statue Lycidas (1905) was intended as an exemplar of his hard-won method. A complex and awkward statue, it aimed to reproduce exactly the body of his model, a Pompeiian named Antonio. It eschewed traditional compositional rules and the standard techniques sculptors used to pose and to render human bodies. Thomas deliberately made the work resistant to interpretation of its symbolism, gesture, or expressivity. Norman Douglas claimed to have suggested the name to Thomas so as to \\"convey no definite suggestion; he wanted something vague and yet distinguished. I hit upon Lycidas because it belonged to three or four persons in antiquity, none of any great importance.\\" The statue was both unorthodox and rigorously Classical. It created a scandal when it was rejected by the Royal Academy in 1905. The sculptor Hamo Thornycroft — a contemporary of Thomas's and a long-standing academician whose innovations of the 1880s had calcified into a conservative narrowness by the twentieth century — was most likely instrumental in the statue's rejection. One newspaper described the rejection as \\"one of the most scandalous infringements of [the Royal Academy's] public duty of which they have ever been convicted.\\" Lycidas was instead shown at the New Gallery in London and became a symbol of the renewed desire to reform the Royal Academy. This cemented Thomas's reputation as an alternative to the Academy, leading in a few years to his invitation to teach sculpture at the Slade School of Art in 1911 and being named as its first Chair of Sculpture in 1914. Thomas was instrumental in teaching a generation of women sculptors working with direct carving: at the Slade his students included Dora Clarke, H. W. Palliser, and Ursula Edgcumbe. Thomas was an important foundation for the development of modernism in British sculpture, and his work contributed to the interest in direct carving and to the break with the expectations of the statuary tradition. Jacob Epstein, for instance, sought out Thomas soon after he moved to England. Roger Fry purchased a relief sculpture for the Metropolitan Museum in New York, and Michael Sadler purchased versions of Lycidas for Manchester and for the Tate. Though overlooked today, Thomas was a significant player in the debates around sculptural representation and the modernization of the Classical tradition in the early twentieth century.

Biography Born in Paraná to Sergio and Silvia Patriarca, he is one of three brothers and learned his tennis at the local Club de Tenis Urquiza. Patriarca, who played right-handed, turned professional in 2000 and won regular titles on the Futures circuit during his career. In 2005 he won two Challenger tournaments in doubles and was singles runner-up at the Geneva Open Challenger, along the way beating Andreas Vinciguerra and Óscar Hernández. He took part in the qualifying draw of the men's singles at the 2006 Wimbledon Championships and a month later qualified for the Austrian Open Kitzbühel, his only main draw appearance on the ATP Tour. In the first round he played an Austrian, Andreas Haider-Maurer, who beat him in three sets. An ankle injury forced him to retire from professional tennis aged 24 and he instead turned to coaching. He was the coach of Juan Mónaco in the 2013 season and has since moved to the Mexican city of Acapulco to run a tennis school.

The event caused a number of direct casualties and widespread environmental damage. It was the single worst incident in a region of arid, mountainous western Kyrgyzstan, with a collection of shuttered Soviet-era uranium mining and processing sites, a legacy of extensive radioactive waste dumps, and a history of flooding and mudslides. As of 2017, despite recent remediations funded by the World Bank and others, the treatment of radioactive waste at Mailuu-Suu still poses serious health and safety risks for local residents.  Background  Oil was discovered here in the early 1900s. Deposits of radium-bearing barites had been discovered by Alexander Fersman in 1929, during his national mineralogical resources survey for the new Soviet government. Uranium mining began in 1946, organized by the \\"Zapadnyi Mining and Chemical Combine\\". In addition to mining, two uranium plants would process more than of uranium ore, by ion exchange and alkaline leach, to produce uranium oxide for Soviet atomic bomb projects. The processed ore was both mined locally and imported from elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc.Djenchuraev, N. Current environmental issues associated with mining wastes in Kyrgyzstan. Department of Environmental Sciences and Policy of Central European University, Budapest, 1999. The town was classified as one of the Soviet government's secret cities, officially known only as \\"Mailbox 200\\". Uranium mining was halted in 1968. Operations left behind some 23 separate uranium tailings dams and 13 waste rock dumps, poorly designed on unstable hillsides above a town of 20,000 people in an area prone to both landslides and earthquakes, holding a total of material containing radionuclides and heavy metals. No attempt to stabilize or seal the material was done when Soviet mining ceased.  Dam failure  On April 16, 1958, with mining and processing plants still operational, a combination of poor design, neglect, heavy rainfall and a reported earthquake caused the #7 tailings dam at Mailuu-Suu to fail. About 50% of the entire volume of the dam flowed into the swift Mailuu-Suu River, only downhill from the breach. The waste then spread about downstream across the national border into Uzbekistan then into the heavily populated Fergana Valley. The Mailuu-Suu River is a tributary of the Kara Darya, used for agricultural irrigation in the valley. Some fatalities, building destruction, and contamination of the flood plain were reported as the direct result of the mudflow. Lack of any public response by officials makes it difficult to identify fatalities from the April 1958 event, especially as distinguished from everyday exposure.  Aftermath  Longterm health effects are more measurable. Grave threats to long-term residents persist, with residents experiencing far higher rates of cancer, goiter, anemia, and other illnesses related to radiological exposure. Mailuu- Suu was found to be one of the 10 most polluted sites in the world in a study published in 2006 by the Blacksmith Institute. Annual spring flooding and the lack of maintenance pose a continued threat of further releases of radioactive material. In 1994, a new landslide temporarily dammed the Mailuu-Suu River. In 2002 a flood caused by a mudslide nearly submerged a tailings pit. The World Bank approved a US$5 million grant to reclaim the tailings pits in 2004, and approved an additional $1 million grant for the project in 2011. The United Nations Development Programme, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have also funded programs.

In 1890s, he joined the Polish Socialist Party and other socialist groups advocating workers' rights. The police forced him to flee to Switzerland where he received engineering education and firefighting training. During World War I, he was fire chief in Vilnius from 1915 to 1918. In 1918, he was elected to the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic and co-opted to the Council of Lithuania. Initially, he was a supported of a union between Lithuania and Belarus along the lines of the old Grand Duchy of Lithuania but later shifted to more fully support Lithuania. He represented Lithuania at the Paris Peace Conference and during the negotiations of the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty. In 1920–1922, he was Minister for Belarusian Affairs. He then retired from politics and devoted his time to firefighting. Biography Semashko was born into a family of poor nobles from Raseiniai. He was born in Vilnius though in his autobiography he noted Surdegis as his birth place. He studied at the Real Gymnasium in Vilnius but was expelled for anti-Tsarist activities after he joined the Polish Socialist Party. In 1895, he moved to Kamianske on the Dnieper river in Ukraine to work in a factory. There he joined a volunteer firefighter brigade and a union advocating for workers' rights. For that, he was searched by the Tsarist police and had to escape to Lviv in then Austria-Hungary in 1898. There he joined workers' organization Borba (fight, struggle), was arrested by the police, and exiled to Switzerland. He completed firefighting courses in Biel/Bienne and a technical school in Winterthur in 1902. In 1903, he joined Polish socialists in London and helped them publish various revolutionary brochures in Belarusian. He returned to the factory in Kamianske during the Russian Revolution of 1905. He again joined the volunteer fire brigade. He returned to Vilnius in 1911 and organized a fire brigade in Šnipiškės in 1914. Semashko rallied the men into a militia to protect the city from hooligans and fires when the Russian Imperial Army abandoned the city during the Great Retreat in mid 1915. He became city's fire chief (brandmajor) and commanded both local and German Ober Ost firefighters during fire. At the same time, he turned away from Polish political activists towards Belarusian and Lithuanian causes. He was a contributor to the Belarusian newspaper Homan and was elected to the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic in January 1918. He participated in the declaration of independence of the Belarusian People's Republic and drafted plans for establishing a Belarusian university, named after Adam Mickiewicz, in Minsk. On 23 April 1918, he participated in discussions with the Council of Lithuania regarding the territory of Lithuania and Belarus after the war and ideas on resurrecting the old Grand Duchy of Lithuania. On 27 November 1918, Semashko and five other Belarusians were co-opted to the Council of Lithuania. In January 1919, as a representative of the Belarusian minority, Semashko was sent by Lithuania to the Paris Peace Conference. His role at the conference became more prominent after a Belarusian delegation, led by Prime Minister Anton Luckievich, arrived to Paris in summer 1919. In mid-June 1919, Semashko issued a memorandum that unconditionally recognized the territories of the former Vilna and Grodno Governorates to Lithuania. It was a clear anti- Belarusian statement and meant that Semashko came to fully support Lithuania's independence at the expense of the Belarusian causes. In April 1920, he was sent as a representative of the Council of Lithuania to the negotiations of the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty. However, he played a minimal role and was quickly recalled to Kaunas. After the elections to the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania in May 1920, Jazep Varonka was replaced by more pro-Lithuanian Semashko as the Minister for Belarusian Affairs without portfolio. As the minister, he published weekly two-page Belarusian newsletter Pahonia (Пагоня, name of Belarusian coat of arms) from July to October 1920. Its circulation was 2,000 copies. Activities of the ministry were minimal and the Belarusians did not trust or support Semashko. He resigned in August 1922 but continued as acting minister until the cabinet change in February 1923. Lithuanians could not find a suitable replacement and the position was temporarily taken by Ernestas Galvanauskas, who at the same time was Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs. The last ministry employees were dismissed by end of 1923. After 1922, Semashko withdrew from politics and devoted his energy to firefighting. Notably, he did not join any Belarusian organizations. He established and briefly edited monthly journal Lietuvos gaisrininkas (Lithuanian Fireman) in 1923 and published a book on firefighting techniques in 1926. He was a special consultant on firefighting to the Ministry of the Interior from 1924 to his death. Semashko assisted in organizing firefighter units in Kaunas and elsewhere. For his efforts, he was awarded the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas. He was also a freemason and a member of the Lithuania Lodge. He died in 1932 after getting an inflammation in his lungs.

The urban area of Intibucá is an important transit and commercial site in the South-West region of Honduras. Located 1,850 meters above sea level, Intibucá has a cool and often foggy climate, hence the nickname \\"La ciudad del manto blanco\\" (the city of the white mantle). Potato production, celebrated by the annual Festival de la Papa (Potato Festival), is the principle basis of the economy for the municipality. The city of Intibucá is merged indistinguishably with the city of La Esperanza, the head of the neighboring municipality of La Esperanza and capital of the department. Intibucá is the older of the twin cities and was originally an indigenous Lenca community, while La Esperanza is the newer ladino community. Although the two cities have separate municipal governments, they are often referred to jointly as La Esperanza as they are only separated by a city street that crosses the city. Residents of Intibucá are traditionally referred to as intibucanos and residents of La Esperanza as esperanzanos.  Location  The municipality borders to the north with the municipalities of San Francisco de Ojuera and San Pedro Zacapa, to the south with the municipalities of Marcala and La Esperanza, to the east with the municipalities of Masaguara and Jesús de Otoro and to the west with the municipalities of Yamaranguila and La Esperanza. The cities of La Esperanza and Intibucá are located on a flat area in the center of the Opalaca Mountain Range. Stratigraphic samples contain limes, clays, sand, gravel and remains of vegetation, indicating that a lake existed in the past. Many wet or swampy areas along with water in the upper layers of the subsoil provide evidence of the transition from a lake bed.  History  The region was occupied by indigenous peoples since the Archaic Period. Pre-Columbian peoples mined obsidian deposits in the area, which was crafted into artifacts and traded among groups in Mesoamerica as early as 1,000 BC. Obsidian was an object of trade throughout Honduras from at least 700 to 900 BC, and trace analyses have identified La Esperanza obsidian from between 800 and 400 BC. At the time of the Spanish conquest, the region was populated predominantly by Lencas, whose origin is still a source of ongoing debate among anthropologists and historians. Although the Lencas in the region accepted the language and religion imposed on them by the Spanish, they retained many elements of their pre-Hispanic culture, including agrarian and domestic rituals, myths, beliefs and other cultural elements that define Lencas as a distinct ethnic group. The indigenous Lenca in Intibuca maintained the Auxíliaria de la Vara Alta (Auxiliary of the High Majesty), which was the pre-Hispanic political and religious organization of the Lencas. The Auxíliaria de la Vara Alta collected and maintained common food supplies, collected taxes, oversaw land titles, and generally maintained the validity and respect of traditional culture. Before the Spanish conquest, there were two towns in this region, Lentercali and Eramani, while name Intibucá appeared in a report made in 1582 by the governor Alonso de Contreras Guevara of Honduras. The Spanish crown appointed Francisco de Cerdá mayor to govern and settle disputes among the indigenous people of the region. In a document dated 10 November 1647, he delimited the municipality of Intibucá to include villages with names of the Lenca dialect. In the population count of 1791 Intibucá was already the head of the parish. It was categorized as a village on 22 September 1848. In 1866 during the administration of president José María Medina it was designated a municipality of the department of Gracias (renamed Lempira in 1943). In 1883 it became a municipality in the new department of Intibucá. The territories of the municipalities of Intibucá and La Esperanza resemble the earlier territories of the towns of Lentercali and Eramani, respectively, except that parts of what were Lentercali are now within La Esperanza. Ladino merchants and ranchers came from Comayagua and other Honduran towns, Guatemala, and El Salvador and bought and appropriated lands from the indigenous residents of Eramani. The settlers founded La Esperanza, which was converted into the capital of Intibucá when the department was created in 1883. Rivalries arose over land and religion between the Lenca residents of Intibucá and the ladino residents of La Esperanza. Rather than fight with their neighbors, the Lencas abandoned buildings in the town center, including their church, the first and oldest of the region constructed in 1790, and their cemetery. These are now located within the border of La Esperanza, so residents of Intibucá cross over into La Esperanza to attend church and bury their deceased relatives. Residents of Intibucá also share the central park, Parque López, which is now also located in La Esperanza. Residents of Intibucá are still predominantly Lenca although the names of the villages were changed during the colonial period to names of Catholic saints. The organizational structure of the Auxiliaria de la Vara Alta, while lost elsewhere in the region, was retained into the 20th century in the municipalities of Intibucá and Yamaranguila. As the Auxiliaria lost political power, it gained importance in religious and cultural rituals. Particularly important among these was the Guancasco that celebrates relationships among villages on 2 February. In this celebration, the patron saint, in Intibucá La Virgen de Candelaria, is carried to alternating villages in succeeding years. The presence of Catholic characteristics in this celebration is due to the Church's effort to give a religious aspect to an event that was so important for the indigenous people. The use of rods, masks, flags, and music of drums and chirimía provide ancient symbols from antiquity that after a long fight agreement was reached to bring peace.  Climate The climate is determined by its tropical position, height, relief and distance from the city to the sea. Intibucá and La Esperanza have a subtropical high altitude climate with characteristics of an oceanic climate. According to the Köppen climate classification the climate is Cwb, typical of cities located at high altitude. It is characterized by having pleasant temperatures, even cold by Honduran measures. The annual difference between the coldest month (December) and the warmest month (April) is 5 °C. The climate is favorable for the cultivation of potatoes, strawberries, blackberries, peaches, and vegetables in general. Intibucá has only two poorly defined seasons, one wet and one dry, but for the inhabitants there are three. The first season is the hot season that goes from the month of March to the month of May, with high temperatures, which often exceed 25 °C. The inhabitants refer to this as summer. After this, comes a monsoon season, also called \\"the hurricane season\\", which is characterized by high levels of humidity, thunderstorms, short torrential rainfalls, sometimes with hail. This goes from July to October. And finally the cold dry season, referred to as winter. This runs from November to February, with freezing temperatures during the night and a cool climate during the day. Rains during this period are usually mild and fall in the form of showers. Thick fogs often form at this time. The temperature is lower, depending on altitude, varying between 2 or 4 degrees °C from lower to higher elevations of the municipality. The temperature range during the winter season is from 20 °C to 10 °C, during the summer season from 25 °C to 12 °C and in the rainy season from 23 °C to 15 °C. The annual average of the climate is 16.4 °C. As for its rainfall, the city is determined by the two dry and wet seasons. Precipitation is influenced by the tropical monsoon. The dry season is from November to April, February being the month with the least rainfall with an average rainfall of 12 mm, while the wet season is from May to October, September being the most rainy with an average rainfall of 316 mm. The average annual rainfall is 1548 mm and the average annual humidity is 75%.  Population Centers  The municipality has 20 villages (aldeas) and 127 hamlets (caseríos). The urban area consists of 19 neighborhoods (barrios).

Inverramsay is a neighbourhood in Goomburra ().  Geography  Goomburra is on the Darling Downs. It is the valley of Dalrymple Creek which flows from east to west away from the Great Dividing Range towards Allora. The creek eventually becomes a tributary of the Condamine River, part of the Murray-Darling river system.  History  The town's name came from the name of a pastoral run operated by pastoralist Patrick Leslie from 1840 to 1841. It is an Aboriginal word which is either a corruption of gooneburra meaning fire black tribe, or which means a shield derived from the kurrajong tree. Goomburra State School opened on 25 April 1881. It closed temporarily in 1905 due to low student numbers. It closed permanently on 14 June 1925. Goomburra Township Provisional School opened on 10 March 1904. On 1 January 1909 it became Goomburra Township State School. Following a fire which destroyed the school, it was closed on 3 January 1972. St John's Anglican Church was dedicated in 1911 by The Venerable Arthur Richard Rivers. Its closure circa 2012 was approved by Archbishop Phillip Aspinall. Goomburra was the terminus of the Goomburra railway line which opened in 1912 and closed in 1961. Inverramsay State School opened on 2 February 1914 and closed on 22 August 1965. On 31 December 1919 in the public hall, Littleton Groom (the member for Darling Downs) unveiled the town's honour board, listing the 32 names of those who had performed military service in World War I including 10 who died in the war.

Life  Born in Charlevoix, Michigan, Acheson was the daughter of artist Jane C. Stanley and granddaughter of John Mix Stanley; her father Louis was a railroad lawyer. She grew up in Detroit. She majored in art at Wellesley College, where among her classmates was the sister of Dean Acheson, who introduced the couple; the two married in May 1917, the same month in which she graduated from college. She continued her artistic studies both before and after moving to Washington, D.C. with her husband, taking lessons at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Corcoran School of Art, and the school at the Phillips Collection. From 1919 she was active in as an artist in Washington, eventually joining and exhibiting with the Society of Washington Artists, from which she received an honorable mention in 1940; she was also an active member of the Washington Water Color Club, the Artists Guild of Washington, and the National Association of Women Artists. For the duration of World War II she abandoned painting to pursue agriculture in support of the war effort, also teaching painting and drawing to wounded servicemen at the Forest Glen annex of Walter Reed Army Medical Center. She took it up again when her husband was appointed United States Secretary of State, but she refused to exhibit until he returned to private life, feeling she would be using his fame to further her own career. Acheson was described as a fashionable woman who, though she took scant interest in foreign affairs, was devoted to her husband and would defend him against any ill feeling. The couple were the parents of three children, all of whom survived her, as did six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. She was also noted for her passion for Scrabble and for her independent spirit, at 85 telling off a teenage mugger who attempted to rob her. Acheson died at her home in Washington, and was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery alongside her husband.  Works  Acheson worked in pastels, watercolor, and oils during her career, progressing from a representational style to something approaching abstraction. Four of her works are in the collection of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, part of the original bequest by Joseph Hirshhorn; they include a still-life in oil, dated before 1956; an undated landscape in oil; a 1975 watercolor view of Phnom Penh; and a 1970 collage titled The City. Two undated watercolors are owned by the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Other pieces are owned by the Phillips Collection, the National Museum of Women in the Arts, and the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum. Her work was formerly in the collection of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, and may be found as well at American University and in the Barnett-Aden Collection. Several of her linoleum cut prints were used to illustrate New Roads in Old Virginia by Agnes Rothberg in 1937. A vertical file pertaining to Acheson's work is at the library of the Phillips Collection; other papers may be found with her husband's private documents at the Yale University Library. She is also featured in some materials held among her husband's official papers at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum.

The book won the Naguib Mahfouz Medal for Literature in 2017. The novel depicts several Palestinian women experiencing tragic love stories under the compelling circumstances and within the ultraconservative community of Baqa'a refugee camp in Jordan. The original title \\"مُخْمَل\\", which in English means \\"Velvet\\", is the all-time favorite kind of fabric to Qamar, a widowed lonely tailoress and one of the main female characters in the novel. The female protagonist of the novel, whose name is Hawwa, meets Qamar and becomes a protégé of hers. In addition to tailoring, Hawwa learns a lot about life from Qamar; and along the way, the love of velvet is passed on by the mentor to the apprentice. Unlike most other Arabic novels with content closely or remotely related to Palestine, \\"Velvet\\" is almost bereft of any political or patriotic themes pertaining to the Palestinian issue; it rather employs the narrative to portray the utterly humane dimensions of common Palestinians — particularly the women — with little or no attention to politics. Rasheed El Enani, one of the members of the committee that awarded the Naguib Mahfouz Medal for Literature in 2017, described the novel by saying, \\"It is not about the political cause, the resistance, the dream of return. It is rather about ordinary Palestinians whose lives go on meanwhile, unnoticed and unrecorded, in the background, while the high dramas of politics occupy center-stage.\\" Conception and writing Baq'a refugee camp in Jordan — the place where the events of Huzama Habayeb's \\"Velvet\\" take place. Although \\"Velvet\\" is entirely fictional, the setting is inspired by Huzama Habayeb's own upbringing and familiarity with the Palestinians' status quo within Jordan, as well as the fact that she is a descendant of a refugee family and has friends and acquaintances who live in Baq'a refugee camp, the place where most of the novel's events occur, as she stated in an interview with Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper. Her father, along with other paternal relatives, was also among the Palestinians who were displaced in 1948 and settled in Zarqa refugee camp in Jordan. In the acceptance speech she delivered on 11 December 2017 at the American University in Cairo (AUC) when she received the Naguib Mahfouz Medal for Literature for \\"Velvet\\", Huzama Habayeb tearfully evoked her father's displacement experience at the end of her address. As for the duration Habayeb spent on writing the novel and conducting the needed research, it was around two and a half years, as she stated in an interview on Al-Ghad TV. Habayeb also said — during the same aforementioned interview — that she purchased huge amounts of fabric, perused the history of fabrics and textiles, learned sewing and tailoring, and conducted interviews with seamstresses just to provide the readers with a plausible tailoring-related content. In the last 8 months of the process, Habayeb wrote every day for 12 hours.  Main characters   Hawwa  Hawwa is the protagonist of the novel. She is a forty-something dreamy woman who is in a tireless pursuit of love that seems to be unattainable. It is worth mentioning that the name \\"Hawwa\\" is the Arabic equivalent of \\"Eve\\", which obviously holds a lot of symbolism.  Qamar  Qamar is a seamstress with both a vague history and her own tragic love story. She is Hawwa's mentor, adviser, and role model.  Musa  Musa is Hawwa's father. He is an abusive construction worker who beats his wife, molests his own daughters, and casts fear in the hearts of all family members. Rab'a Rab'a is Hawwa's mother. She was forced to marry Musa, who constantly inflicts serious physical and emotional injuries on her. Rab'a is portrayed as a helpless wife who suffers from an emotional drought.  Nayfeh  Nayfeh is Hawwa's paternal grandmother. From the outside, she is depicted as a tough, angry, discontented woman; yet from the inside, she is crushed. Nayfeh is the one who orchestrates the arranged marriage between Hawwa and Nathmi.  Nathmi  Nathmi is Hawwa's undesired husband. He is a younger, but equally cruel, version of her abusive father.  Lutfi  Lutfi is Hawwa's elder brother. He keeps himself isolated from his family's issues and lives in a world of his own, indifferent to the tribulations surrounding him.  Ayed  Ayed is Hawwa's younger brother. He also gets his own share of beating from his ruthless dad, Musa, especially in the mornings when Ayed's bed is found wet due to his nocturnal enuresis.  Qays  Qays is Hawwa's son, who grows up to possess a similar character of his father (Nathmi).  Ayah  Ayah is Hawwa's daughter. She and her mother have some things common: Both have been physically and emotionally abused by their fathers, and both have demonstrated a lack of emotions toward their mothers.  Muneer  Muneer is Hawwa's lover who becomes the soon-to-be second husband after she divorces Nathmi.  Reception   Media and critics  Shortly after it was published, the novel was critically acclaimed in a review posted by Al- Jazeera's website. The review acknowledges Huzama Habayeb as \\"one of the most prominent novelists in the Arabic narrative scene.\\" Al-Hayat newspaper commended Habayeb's writing style and deemed \\"Velvet\\" an \\"added value to the Palestinian novels, in particular, as well as the Arabic novels in general.\\"  Naguib Mahfouz Medal for Literature  Huzama Habayeb receives the 2017 Naguib Mahfouz Medal for Literature at the AUC from Francis J. Ricciardone Jr. On 11 December 2017, Huzama Habayeb's \\"Velvet\\" won Naguib Mahfouz Medal for Literature. The award — which was handed to Habayeb by Francis J. Ricciardone Jr., the president of the American University in Cairo (AUC) — includes a silver medal, cash prize, and a publication of an English translation of the novel. The award committee hailed \\"Velvet\\" as a \\"new kind of Palestinian novel\\" that concentrates on the marginalized common Palestinians in diaspora and avoids the pretentious display of spurious patriotic themes revolving around the political struggle. The novel was also commended for its \\"poetic prose and skillful deployment of vocabulary choice.\\" Shereen Abouelnaga, a professor of English literature at the AUC and a member in the award committee, said \\"The author of 'Velvet' has managed to create a parallel world for the reader to perceive the harsh and arid life in the camp.\\" Authors and publishers are the ones who usually submit nominations to the AUC to be considered for Naguib Mahfouz Medal for Literature. However, the award committee itself may select a novel even if it was not nominated by any authors, publishers, or anyone; and that was the case in 2017 — neither Huzama Habayeb nor her publisher nominated \\"Velvet\\" for the medal; the members of the award committee were the ones who selected the novel directly, which was a \\"big surprise\\" to Habayeb, as she said in an interview with MBC.net website — a surprise that \\"reiterated a principle\\" in which she had always believed: \\"Innovative writing that is characterized by genuineness and makes a difference is capable eventually to impose itself and have its say.\\"  Adaptations  There have been no official announcements yet that the novel will be made into a movie, but numerous critics have reiterated the possibility of adapting the book as a film due to the cinematic style that dominates the narrative; and when asked whether she perceived the novel would turn into a movie, Habayeb replied: \\"Why not? As a matter of fact, when I write, I see. I don't think of the words, sentences, characters, or the way I should phrase the words; I rather see the words, sentences, and the characters being created in front of me visually.\\"  References  Category:Arabic- language novels Category:2016 novels ","title":"Velvet (novel)"},{"id":"56168560","text":"Huitonglu station (), is a station of Line 4 of the Nanjing Metro.

Since 2015, he's been part of the Prosecution trial team in the case of Laurent Gbagbo and Charles Blé Goudé at the International Criminal Court. Publications Demirdjian has published articles about topics dealing with international criminal law procedure as well as on the Armenian genocide. He edited and co-authored an interdisciplinary volume called The Armenian Genocide Legacy for the centennial anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.

Demirdjian published a 2005 paper with Rodney Dixon, a member of Association of Defence Counsel of the ICTY, about plea-bargaining at the ICTY, where they noted that defense attorneys advising clients must be extremely resourceful in exploring all possible grounds for mitigation given the broad discretionary powers of the Trial Chambers. They noted that sentence reductions were unlikely due to the serious nature of the crimes brought before the Trial Chambers, adding that in most cases, the Trial Chambers would follow the recommendations of the OTP. They identified several key \\"mitigating circumstances\\" including the resources of the tribunal, protecting the interests of the victims and a genuine admission of guilt.

(a small village 2 km west of Tipperary, Ireland). He migrated to Australia at the time of the gold rush, worked at the diggings, and in 1853 gained employment as a warder at Pentridge Stockade then the hulk President, was promoted to chief warder of the hulk Success, was transferred to Collingwood Stockade, then governor of Portland Gaol, finally to become around 1868 the notoriously hard-driving governor of Castlemaine Gaol. On 24 September 1862, he married Mary Georgina Anne \\"Georgina\\" Penfold, only child of Dr. Christopher Rawson Penfold (2 August 1811 – 26 March 1870) and Mary Penfold, née Holt (1816From death notice; some references put her birth at 1810 or 1820. – 31 December 1895) of \\"The Grange\\", Magill. :Dr. Penfold, son of John Penfold, vicar of Steyning, Sussex, was trained at St Bartholomew's Hospital, and practised medicine at fashionable Brighton from 1838 to 1844. He married Mary, daughter of Dr. Thomas Holt of Edmonton, London, on 26 May 1835. They migrated to South Australia aboard Taglioni, arriving in June 1844 with their daughter Georgina, and servant Ellen Timbrell. He was in straitened finances: apart from the cost of the voyage, he had spent £1200 on their Magill property, purchased sight unseen from Robert Cock and William Ferguson. He had borrowed £200 from his cousin Thomas Brooks Penfold before leaving England; three years later the cousin, who followed him a year later aboard Augustus, was anxious for its return, with interest. some references have Thomas as Penfold's brother. Thomas B. Penfold returned to England c. 1855; his wife Emma died in 1859, and he died before 1864. :He had brought vine cuttings from England and France, mostly Grenache, their cut ends sealed with wax. He planted a vineyard near the house, and within a few years was making red wines, carefully stored in small French oak casks. Mary is known to have had a major part in its production and blending. Soon they had more than enough for his grateful patients (in those days fortified red wine, particularly port,No mention has been found of where the brandy spirit for fortifying the wine came from. Did he have his own still? was it imported? or did he purchase it from someone like A. J. Tolley? was considered beneficial for anemia and other complaints, and Penfold had no faith in the efficacy of the imported product), and enjoyed modest sales in Victoria as well as South Australia. :Penfold was a successful doctor and popular figure in the area. He was on the building committee of St. George's Anglican Church, Woodforde, South Australia, the first Anglican church building in the colony, and still in use.He was not the 1854 clerk to the District Council of East Torrens; that was his cousin, Capt. Thomas Brooks Penfold (died before 1864), late of the Honorable East India Company, who had a nine-roomed house and a few acres in Magill for sale in 1856. then in 1856 the first chairman of the District Council of Burnside. Ellen Timbrell died on 3 September 1857. Many references imply she was working with Mary Penfold twenty years later. The Hylands' daughter Inez Kathleen Hyland was born 16 August 1863, and from age eight lived with her grandmother at The Grange, Magill. She was not a strong child, and her parents believed the clear air and moderate climate of Magill would be beneficial to her health. A strong bond grew between the two: Inez was a brilliant and imaginative child and Mary encouraged her writing, especially her poetry. Even well into her late 20s, Inez seems to have no other life; perhaps she was an invalid. She died from typhoid fever on 11 January 1892, and Mary left for Melbourne shortly after, never to return. She published a collection of her granddaughter's work, as In Sunshine and in Shadow in 1893, which received some excellent, if mixed, reviews. :Dr. Penfold died in 1870 after a long illness and was buried in St. George's churchyard. Mary by then had taken full control of the vineyard and winery, and in 1869 had hired as assistant Joseph Gillard (1846–1927). His father, Joseph Gillard I (1823–1891) was a winemaker; they emigrated 1849 aboard David Malcolm Gillard became manager of the Magill \\"Grange\\" vineyards in 1881. Hyland recommended to Mary Penfold, presumptuously some reckon, This article supports the possibility Mary married at age 15, not uncommon among the uneducated families, but much less likely among the debutante class. that she sell the business and retire, a not unrealistic suggestion, as the property and business had become quite valuable and the sale would enable her to live in comfort indefinitely, but she was adamant: the winery was her life, and like Ann Bickford twenty years earlier, determined to keep alive the business her husband started. Another reading could be that Hyland, who would have known his mother-in-law well, was offering his moral support whichever route she chose. On 14 September 1881 they signed an arrangement: that Hyland should be Penfolds' accountant and their marketing agent for Victoria, where he would continue to live, leaving Mary to run the winery, and receive 10% of profits. Hyland, who had in 1876 taken 12 months' leave of absence in 1876 preparatory, it was thought, to retiring, finally retired from Castlemaine Gaol and the Penal Department in 1883. Mary died in 1895; the following year some members of the family adopted the style \\"Penfold Hyland\\", recognising the importance of the name \\"Penfold\\". It later frequently appeared in print hyphenated as \\"Penfold-Hyland\\", but with what justification it is difficult to ascertain. Under Hyland's guidance, the company established vineyards and wineries at McLaren Vale and Nuriootpa in South Australia, and Dalwood and Minchinbury in New South Wales and offices in Adelaide, Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, and London.

He was born in Hingham, Massachusetts, and was a nephew of William F. Sturgis, a Boston merchant. In the 1830s he was owner and captain of ships plying the California hide trade with the Hawaiian Islands. After his first wife died in Massachusetts in 1840, he became a permanent resident of Yerba Buena, taking Mexican citizenship in 1842 and marrying Ygnacio Martinez's daughter Susana. He enjoyed a close friendship with Juan Bautista Alvarado, and helped him in his efforts to secure the governorship of Alta California against a competing claim from Carlos Antonio Carrillo. He was elected alcalde in 1844, and in that year ordered the construction of a bridge across the creek between San Francisco Bay and a small saltwater lagoon lying at what is now the intersection of Montgomery and Jackson Streets. This modest construction was regarded as a novelty by many residents at the time, who had formerly had to wade tidal muds or jump across the creek to travel between the settled area to the south and ship embarkments to the north.

It is managed by the local planning authorities on basis of guidance from central government. Geography The green belt was first proposed in 1958, but only formalised and approved by central government in 1975. Land area taken up by the belt is , 0.5% of the total land area of England (2010). All the Oxfordshire district council areas contain some portion, and it extends for some five miles from the city's limits. The smallest tracts are within the city and West Oxfordshire districts, with South Oxfordshire containing the largest expanse. Key suburbs, villages and towns within the realms of the green belt include Dean Court, Kennington, Kidlington, Wheatley, and Yarnton.

Development  The background of Jones and Jones Multimedia employees included theatre, fiction, literature, and art, and the company's video game output (including this game) combined these aspects together. They aimed to include genuine art and historical information to make it appealing and long-lasting. They set the game in locations that had an air of mystery and fascination. The team spent more than a year doing art history research to have a better understanding of the architectural worlds which were being created in the game. They turned their research into 3D representations; while they didn't recreate existing structures, they incorporated elements that they observed. The team aimed to add 2D animation and sound effects to as many screens as possible to give a sense of a lived-in world, for instance a bird flying across the sky. A unique game engine was made for the title.  Critical reception  Quandary thought the game's short length let it down.

The film was directed and co-written by Bernard MacMahon and stars Nas, Alabama Shakes, Elton John, Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Jack White, Taj Mahal, Ana Gabriel, Pokey LaFarge, Beck, Ashley Monroe, Los Lobos, The Avett Brothers, Bettye LaVette, Rhiannon Giddens, Raphael Saadiq, Edie Brickell, Steve Martin, and others. The film employed a diverse line-up of performers both ethnically and musically to represent the breadth of cultures that were first given a national platform through the invention of this recording machine. It also explored the extent to which the recordings made on it in the 1920s influenced and inspired contemporary music.  Development  The film involved a decade of work restoring the machine, which was pieced together from spare parts scattered across the globe, in order to better understand the origins of modern recording technology, Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, pp. 238-239 and the influence the machine had on world culture. The machine would go on to put sound on motion pictures.[1]Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, p. 243 The recreation of a live 1920s-style recording session, explored the essence of what makes a great recorded performance.[1]Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, p. 261 The film resulted in unexpected insights into how sound recording was developed and perfected and its impact on how musicians communicate on recordings today. MacMahon filmed the live performances like a Hollywood musical in single unedited takes to focus on the music, the sound the machine produced, and the impact it had on the artists performances.[1]Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, p. 254 The technical aspects of the recording were covered in sequences interspersed throughout the film where, with rigorously filmed tracking shots and extreme close-ups using a macro lens, the viewer could observe and understand the inner workings of the machine. The film received widespread acclaim for its direction, musical performances, sound and cinematography. The film won the Discovery Award and the Audience Award at the Calgary International Film Festival, was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award, Bernard MacMahon and Allison McGourty were nominated as Breakthrough Talents by the British Academy Film Awards and won a Grammy Award for the Alabama Shakes performance of “Killer Diller Blues”.  Film synopsis  The film's title sequence begins with a series of cards announcing that “In 1925 the invention of electrical sound recording revolutionized the phonograph industry. In 1926 this equipment was taken across America to record rural music for the very first time – blues, gospel, Cajun, country, Hawaiian, Native American and more…Only a few of these machines were made, and none are known to have survived. All the musical performances in this film are live. The audio you hear is taken directly from the discs it was recorded to, with no editing or enhancements.” Thereafter a series of contemporary musicians enter an exact replica of a 1920s recording studio and record songs live onto a single microphone attached to the first electrical recording system and a pulley driven cutting lathe. Their performances are filmed in single takes. Some of the performers are seen arranging their songs and Elton John is seen actually writing his song live on camera. These scenes are interspersed with interviews with engineer Nicholas Bergh explaining how the machine works, its cultural and technological importance, how the 1920s field recording sessions were organized and the observations of the contemporary performers participating. Some of the artists’ performances are prefaced by ethereal scenes where the camera explores the dark corridors of the empty studio, accompanied by the recordings that were made on the machine 90 years ago distantly playing in the background, while the camera zooms in on framed portraits of those long-deceased musicians hanging on the walls of the studio. These ghostly scenes are followed by a contemporary artist covering the same song.[1]Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, p. 241 Numerous potentially fatal disasters befall the machine during the sessions including the pulley cable that holds the weight breaking, which Jack White repairs at an upholstery shop, the amplifier overheating and blowing up during an Avett Brothers recording and a fraught 13 take session where Beck's 12-piece choir battle with an overdriven and distorting microphone. To capture the eclecticism of a 1920s recording session, a very diverse selection of artists is seen participating in the film, from Hispanic performers like Ana Gabriel and Los Lobos to Hawaiian steel guitar bands like The Hawaiians and Cajun acts like The Lost Bayou Ramblers, pop singers like Elton John, rock and roll groups like Alabama Shakes and Jack White and hip hop artists like Nas. The film culminates with the last filmed performance of Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson recording a song, Haggard has written for the film, “The Only Man Wilder Than Me” followed by a cover of Bob Wills’ “Old Fashioned Love” closing the film with the lines; “Although the land may change to sea, There'll be no change in me, I've got that old fashioned love in my heart.”  Origins  MacMahon stated that the idea for the film was born out of a desire to understand on a practical level how the pivotal 1920s recordings were made, “you can only truly appreciate history, and understand why things were done the way they were done, by actually going out and doing them yourself.”[1]Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, p. 255 Two initial sessions were filmed at the producers' expense prior to the commissioning of the films by the BBC and PBS.[1]Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, pp. 240-241 These were with Frank Fairfield and The Americans. This was done, according to MacMahon, “as a proof of concept and to ensure the look and style of the film was indelibly stamped from the outset with our own artistic sensibilities and thereby limit the level of outside interference.” He also added “The American Epic Sessions film was the carrot to get the three historical films made. This meant we shot Sessions way ahead of the production of the rest of the films to engender an incentive to tackle the vast undertaking that was the historical films. Making Sessions was like the Olympic 100 metres. The historic films were the marathon.”MacMahon, Bernard (September 28, 2016). \\"An Interview with Bernard MacMahon\\". Breakfast Television (Interview). Interview with Jill Belland. Calgary: City MacMahon has commented that he prefers to shoot the endings of films first so he can determine the pace to the climax more effectively.  Film production   Location  The film was shot in one main location: Vox Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. Originally built in 1936 and named Electro-Vox, the studio is “said to be the oldest private recording studio in the world”. The studio was emptied of all current sound recording equipment and furniture, then dressed in period fixtures and fittings before bringing in the Western Electric Recording System. The set designer attempted to make the studio feel as close to how a studio would have felt in the 1920s in an attempt to give the musicians the feeling of being taken back in time to an actual recording session as described in the American Epic documentary series. The film had one secondary location, Sophie's Seat Design in Hollywood, California, which was featured when former upholsterer, Jack White, took the broken belt of the recording lathe to be re-sewn.  Artist selection  The artists were principally chosen by MacMahon in consultation with the film's producers and co-writers Duke Erikson and Allison McGourty, and executive producers T Bone Burnett and Jack White. The performers were chosen for their musical and ethnic diversity and their ability to record in a rigorous and demanding manner. MacMahon insisted on having three previously unrecorded acts at the sessions; The Americans, Christine Pizutti and Jerron “Blind Boy” Paxton.  Song selection  The musicians were encouraged to record both a vintage song and a song they had written. MacMahon and Erikson compiled a list of old songs that they wanted to feature in the film and in some cases specifically chose songs for particular performers; “Mal Hombre” for Ana Gabriel, “On the Road Again” for Nas, “Tomi Tomi” for the Hawaiians and “Nobody's Dirty Business” for Bettye LaVette. Other performers researched the period and selected their own vintage songs; Jack White unearthed “Matrimonial Intentions”, the Avett Brothers chose “Jordan Am a Hard Road” and Rhiannon Giddens chose “One Hour Mama”. Most of the performers recorded two songs although the duration of the film precluded all these performances appearing in the finished film. Some performers wrote songs specifically for the film like Merle Haggard who composed “The Only Man Wilder Than Me” as a duet for him and Willie Nelson to perform. Elton John arrived at the studio with a lyric entitled “Two Fingers of Whiskey” that Bernie Taupin had written specifically for the film. Elton John then proceeded to write the melody live on camera and arrange the song with Jack White and recorded the song live direct to disc without leaving the room during the whole process. All the performances in the film and many additional songs not featured in the film were released by Columbia Records/Lo-Max on Music from The American Epic Sessions: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack.  Score  A non-diegetic score was occasionally used in the film. There were four main instances, a section revealing how the Western Electric Amplifier Rack and Microphone work, a section discussing the social impact the Western Electric Recording System had on the world and its eventual demise, the arrival of the final two musicians in the film, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard, and finally, the closing credits. The score was written by Duke Erikson and Bernard MacMahon and performed by Duke Erikson and Chris Wagoner.  Cinematography  The film was storyboarded extensively by MacMahon in advance of the shoot along with detailed diagrams of the lighting designs. He explained; “I’d have an idea in advance of what the set-up might be musically so I painted out lighting design and storyboards in advance. Those were in a constant state of flux,” Producer Allison McGourty commented “It was like a theatrical production—Bernard designed different lighting for each session to give [each song] a different feel.” MacMahon said that he wanted the film to look like a painting “I wanted a rich color palette so it looks like a Velázquez painting,” he said, with the lighting falling off to heavy shadows in the corners of the picture to conceal the dolly tracks in the studio. MacMahon filmed principally on an Arri Alexa on a camera dolly. The decision to have the camera in a constant state of subtle motion was designed to give the film a musical rhythm and momentum. As the musicians in the film were forced to record their tracks in a single unaltered take, MacMahon decided the camera should do the same and choreographed complex single take moves to mirror the tempo of the music whilst landing on the musicians the moment their part came to the foreground. McGourty explained “he would rehearse with our house band before the performers arrived, and rehearse the camera crew with all the dolly moves so they would know when the lead vocalist would be singing; then it would go into a chorus, then the guitar or the banjo. There was a huge amount of preparation, because it was not just the music that had to be captured in one three-minute take—we had to capture the whole experience on film, and make it look natural, and do it smoothly enough that we didn’t interfere with the performers.” MacMahon said he took some of his inspiration from John J. Mescall's cinematography on James Whale productions like the Bride of Frankenstein. MacMahon wanted viewers to feel like they were standing in the studio watching the performance, so the camera never moved lower than a crouch or higher than someone standing on their tip toes, nor did the camera zoom in closer than a guest in the studio would stand. A test session was filmed with Frank Fairfield and The Americans to perfect the cinematic style of the film. In stark contrast to this policy was his use of extreme macro photography when the film discusses the recording system. Shot using macro lenses, the cinematography used in these sections was designed to take the viewer inside the inner workings of the 1920s Western Electric amplifier and microphone and the 1920s Scully cutting lathe, and to give the recording system a larger than life persona. Exterior shots of the dilapidated and nondescript studio building were occasionally employed with pedestrians walking by oblivious to the activities going on inside. MacMahon said this was to “remind people that behind every door there are a thousand stories.”  Sound recording  = Western electric recording system = In 1925, Western Electric launched a new electronic recording process that could capture the nuances of the human voice and subtle instrumental shadings that had eluded the old acoustic systems. The machine revolutionized the recording of music because it could record every type of instrument and voice whereas the acoustic horn recordings that predated it were severely limited in what they could record effectively.[1]Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, p. 15 The new system consisted of an electrical microphone whose signal was amplified by a 6’ amplifier rack. The amplified signal was then sent to a cutting head that cut a wax disc on a Scully lathe that was pulley powered by a 100Ib brass weight. In the 1920s as radio took over the pop music business, record companies were forced to expand their markets and leave their studios in major cities in search of new musical styles and markets. They organized field recording sessions across America and recorded blues, gospel, Cajun, country, Hawaiian, Native American and many other hitherto unrecorded types of music using the Western Electric system which technologically made these recordings possible. These recordings would go on to have vast cultural impact in North America and the rest of the world. The recording system was leased out to the major record labels who had to pay a royalty on every record sold to Western Electric. The success of music recordings led to the system being leased by the major Hollywood studios for talking pictures after initial resistance. Although there are no records of how many of these machines were leased out to the record companies, estimates range from a dozen to two dozen. Prior to the release of The American Epic Sessions the recording system was mysterious and had not been seen in almost 80 years.[1]Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, p. 235-237 Engineer Nicholas Bergh explained, “I had two mentors when I was getting into audio who started their careers in the late 1930s in America and both of them told me that even by the late ‘30s this system was basically mythical and they had never seen any components of it or even pictures. So even in ten years it had basically disappeared off the face of the earth.” = Restoring the recording system = At the outset of the pre-production of the American Epic documentary series there were no known photos or film footage of the full Western Electric system. Locating visual documentation became of paramount importance to the producers. Midway through the research on the film, MacMahon and McGourty were introduced to sound engineer Nicholas Bergh as a possible collaborator. After a year of getting to know each other, Bergh revealed he had spent almost a decade attempting to restore the Western Electric system. Bergh had scavenged spare parts from around the world, in places as far away as Japan and Europe, in his quest to complete the system. “All the individual items had to come from different places, often thousands of miles apart” he explained “I was able to confirm my progress by studying the few crude music studio pictures that started to show up.” However, Bergh was missing a vital part of the set up – the pulley driven Scully lathe. On an exploratory trip to the Scully family, looking for photographs, MacMahon and McGourty discovered perhaps the only surviving 1924 Scully lathe in the family's basement and persuaded them to loan it to the production.[1]Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, p. 240 MacMahon then set about persuading Bergh to engineer a session with contemporary artists recording on the system. Bergh was nervous about doing this as “moving that [the recording system] into a production environment, that was a major change.” MacMahon persuaded Bergh to participate in a test session with two new artists so as to limit the pressure. Frank Fairfield and The Americans were the first musicians to record on the system in over 80 years. “The results were satisfactory” MacMahon explained “but Nick wanted to operate the machine more effectively”. Producer and co-writer Allison McGourty gained access to the AT&T; archive which kept the research documents for Western Electric. Within the archive they located engineers’ casebooks and accounting forms that gave some more clues as to how to operate the machine. They also managed to locate 1920s photographs of the recording system being used in the Western Electric laboratory. Armed with this new information Bergh agreed to MacMahon's plan to attempt to film a full recording session with twenty artists. MacMahon hired T Bone Burnett and Jack White to produce and arrange songs for the sessions and booked all the artists.[1]Wald, McGourty, MacMahon 2017, pp. 241-243 = Recording process = The Western Electric system was a live direct-to-disc recording method. The earliest condenser microphone was wired into a six-foot amplifier rack comprising a preamplifier, a first level meter, a monitor amplifier, a line amplifier to drive the cutting head which etched the grooves onto a wax disc on the turntable of a Scully cutting lathe that was rotated by a pulley system and a 100lb weight. The performers gathered around the microphone and carefully positioned themselves to achieve the correct balance. The performers were cued into when they needed to start and stop playing by a light system operated by the sound engineer that hung in the live room.The pulley allowed approximately three and a half minutes to record before the weight hit the floor. The calibration of the lathe has determined the length of the pop single to this day.The Western Electric recording system favored small vocal led groups and this had a fundamental influence on them being the dominant musical aggregation to this day. The recording system did not allow for any changes to be made to the live recording. The Scully lathe itself predated the switch from acoustic to electric recording. In the acoustic era, the lathe was connected to a large conical horn which the musicians had to gather around and sing and play at the loudest possible volume to create enough air pressure to physically vibrate a diaphragm attached to the cutting head. During the filming, MacMahon persuaded Jack White and his band to make an acoustic recording on the lathe, replacing the microphone with two horns – the first such recording made in 90 years. A rough cut of the film containing this sequence was screened at the BFI London Film Festival but it was subsequently cut from later versions to bring the film's duration to under two hours.  Editing  The editing style of the film was designed to feel like a dance between the camera and the musicians and was devised between editor, Dan Gitlin, and MacMahon. The use of cutaways were infrequently employed in favor of full takes of the musical performances, to make clear that the performances were live and unaltered. Before each performance, as the cutting head needle was lowered onto the disc, the production audio was replaced with a needle drop of the unadorned mono master disc recording. Tracking shots of the dark corridors of the studios accompanied by the audio of vintage performances recorded on the equipment, were used as a recurring theme in the film to signify trips into the past where original recordings of songs that are about to be recorded in the film are heard. These sequences were constructed to give the viewer an understanding of the music from the 1920s and 30s.  Reception   Release  The film was previewed as a work in progress at film festivals around the world throughout 2016, including a Special Event at Sundance hosted by Robert Redford, SXSW, International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam, Denver International Film Festival, Sydney Film Festival,\\"Sydney Film Festival Announces Sounds on Screen” . Sff.org.au. 2016. Retrieved 2017-12-28. and the London Film Festival. The film was completed in February 2017 and aired on PBS in the US and BBC in the UK in May and June 2017. An NTSC DVD and Blu-ray of the series was released in the US in June 2017.  Critical reception  The film was released to widespread critical acclaim, with many publications praising the direction, performances, the quality of the sound, the cinematography and lighting. Joe Boyd wrote in The Guardian “for two hours we revel in filmed performances in front of that single microphone, as the camera lovingly follows the sound through anaconda- like cables to the cutting head. As soon as the blank disc starts spinning, our soundtrack switches from the film-maker’s 21st-century handheld digital stereo to the glorious mono of the single microphone. There are no faders; if Burnett or White want more of this musician and a bit less of that one, they move them closer to or away from the microphone. It’s brilliant theatre, beautifully filmed and makes for glorious television. Miss it at your peril.” Stephen Dalton in The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film was “a mammoth project with worthy intentions and a big heart - a feast of musical and educational riches.” Steve Appleford in Rolling Stone observed that “in the final performance of Sessions, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard perform the duet \\"The Only Man Wilder Than Me.\\" Haggard has a look of complete joy on his face throughout the session in the old-timey recording set-up once used by his musical heroes.” Mike Bradley in The Observer said The American Epic Sessions was “one of the most interesting music programmes ever broadcast. Wonderful.” Michael Watts in The Economist wrote the film was “unmissable and uncovers the origins of popular music.” Iain Shedden in The Australian noted “one of the highlights (and audience prizewinner) of last year’s Sydney Film Festival was the American Epic series of documentaries by British filmmaker Bernard MacMahon and producers Allison McGourty and Duke Erikson. The American Epic Sessions, brought together a wealth of contemporary talent. It’s an exquisite representation of the primitive power of American roots music and its enduring charm - music that stirs the soul.” Greil Marcus in The Village Voice praised the film for “performances so good you can hardly listen without thinking of how close each recording is to not existing at all.” Liz Jobey in the Financial Times hailed the film as “an extraordinary journey back through American song recording” and Ludovic Hunter-Tilney in the same paper remarked that “New York Rapper Nas does a superb cover of the Memphis Jug Band’s “On the Road Again”, exposing the hip-hop blueprint within the 1928 stomper.” Danny Eccleston in Mojo pointed out that “in one of the series’ most extraordinary moments, Elton John arrives toting a box-fresh lyric by Bernie Taupin and works it up in an instant, the song materializing in front of the viewers eyes before John and Jack White go for the take. There's the magic right there.” L. Kent Wolgamott in the Lincoln Journal Star praised it as “a fascinating picture. Among its highlights: A killer performance in Spanish by Ana Gabriel on a song originally done by Lydia Mendoza; Taj Mahal’s powerhouse take on Charley Patton’s “High Water Everywhere”; and Bettye LaVette's heartfelt recollections of being pushed away from early blues as “Uncle Tomish” in the ‘60s before she nails “When I Woke Up This Morning.” Stephen Thompson at NPR wrote that “watching Alabama Shakes' members tear into this brief but potent cover of \\"Killer Diller\\", you get insights into the magic of the equipment and studio, the timelessness of the song, and Alabama Shakes' own genre-and era-busting charisma.” James Moore in Gigwise observed “This need for greatness within that three-minute take is captured perfectly in the film, moments of silence before a blue light indicates “go” seeping with nail- biting tension and atmosphere. In every case, the results are astounding and the artists always deliver. When you watch, this cinematic choice feels absolutely perfect, the lack of cuts capturing the immediacy of the song and reflecting the fact that the musicians have no choice to cut and start again either. Oh, and the sound...Wonderfully visceral, raw and untampered with, every original recording is layered with character and charisma, the beautifully complex machine always manages to draw the very best from its chosen subject. Handled with wonderful care, romanticism and respect for the technology and the incredible talent it facilitated, the film is a viewing experience like no other and should be sought out by music fans of all tastes and ages.” Brian McCollum in the Detroit Free Press wrote that the film “brings a lost musical era back to life” and praised “a documentary which pairs a scholarly eye for detail with a buoyant fan passion.” Chris Willman in Variety praised the film for being “all about romance” and posited that “the ultimate star of this show is a meticulously reconstructed recording machine from the 1920s that seems to have talismanic qualities on those who enter its orbit even 80 years after it was last in use. This antiquated, cleaned up piece of studio equipment is so fetishistically photographed, it relegates the 19 musical acts that drop by for an old-school session to supporting players. Fortunately, it’s a stunt that pays off, in pristine contemporary recordings you can scarcely believe went directly through a cutting stylus direct to disc. Bernard MacMahon, who championed this project for the better part of this century, makes the best case for this beautiful monstrosity of a machine representing the pre-homogeneity democratization of American music.” Robert Lloyd in the Los Angeles Times confided \\"I don’t mind telling you I got a little emotional watching this, and you might too.\\" Kurt Gardner in Blogcritics called the film “An amazing journey through musical history. Lovers of music and early Americana alike will be fascinated by Bernard MacMahon and Allison McGourty’s The American Epic Sessions. The enormous device, made of pulleys, flywheels, weights, and wood, was set up in a Los Angeles recording studio whose nondescript exterior gave no hint of the magic taking place inside. There, the film is lit in nostalgic, burnished hues, and loving close-ups of the marvelous contraption in operation are interspersed with performances by such talents as The Avett Brothers, Los Lobos, Alabama Shakes, Taj Mahal, Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, and Elton John. Historically fascinating and musically entertaining, The American Epic Sessions was the perfect film to watch during SXSW at Austin’s historic Paramount Theatre, surrounded as we were by the ghosts of entertainers who’d graced the stage over its 100-year history.” James Jackson in The Times wrote “none of these machines survive, but for this high-class film the engineering has been lovingly reassembled for today’s stars to try. It’s all very muso, but completely enriching too – watching Elton John compose a song with Jack White is a thrill.” Euan Ferguson, in The Observer summarized “I have to say all acquitted themselves phenomenally. Everyone who has ever been even the tiniest bit interested in music should watch this.” The film has received a number of awards, including the Foxtel Audience Award at the 2016 Sydney Film Festival,“63rd Sydney Film Festival Complete Foxtel Movies Audience Award Announced” . SFF.org. 2016. Retrieved 2017-12-28.. At the 2016 Calgary International Film Festival, it won the Audience Award and garnered director Bernard MacMahon the Discovery Award. The film was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy 2017 for Outstanding Musical Direction, Bernard MacMahon and Allison McGourty were nominated by the British Academy Film Awards in 2018 as Breakthrough Talents for The American Epic Sessions and the film won a Grammy Award for Alabama Shakes performance of “Killer Diller Blues\\".

Both are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council and mainly adhere to Islam, Oman follows Ibadi Islam while Saudi Arabia follows Sunni Islam. Both being gulf states, make them strong allies, however, Oman has a more lenient approach when it comes to Iran. The two countries share a long border, second in length only to the Saudi Arabia–Yemen border. History Khawarij movement The Khawarij, a radical Islamic group formed after the death of Prophet Muhammad in what would be today Saudi Arabia, was responsible for the revolt against Caliph Ali. However, some of them, following the more moderate and disagreed with the Khawarij, refused the authority of Khawarij and moved into South Arabia, which would be today Oman. Thus, the moderate party formed the Ibadi movement, in which later became the core of Omani culture. The Ibadi is the only surviving force of the Khawarij movement. Modern relations As both Oman and Saudi Arabia's modern political approach formed amidst the withdrawal of British Armed Forces, they established relationship at 1971. However, Oman has chosen a moderate approach in political agenda in comparing to Saudi Arabia. Oman has been acting as a mediator that keeping relationship with Iran when Iran has tensions with other Arab countries, and since then has become a bridge connecting relationship between two countries. Also, Oman doesn't participate in the Saudi-led coalition at the Yemeni Civil War. Recently, Oman also plays as moderate mediator during the current standoff between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and provides an alternative route to bypass the blockade of Qatar by Saudi Arabia and its allies.

It as an above-average season for tropical cyclones for the third consecutive year. Though the season officially began on June 1, 2018 and ended November 30, 2018, dates adopted by convention and historically describe the period during each year when most tropical cyclones form, it effectively started with the formation of Tropical Storm Alberto on May 25. The season's final storm, Hurricane Oscar, dissipated on October 31. The year produced sixteen tropical depressions, all but one of which further intensified into named tropical storms. Of the fifteen named storms, eight developed into hurricanes, and two further intensified into major hurricanes, which are rated Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson scale. These two major hurricanes contributed to a majority of the season's severe destruction and loss of life, mainly in the United States. Hurricane Florence formed near Cabo Verde on August 31, steered toward the west-northwest with little exception by a large area of high pressure to its north. The cyclone strengthened amid favorable environmental factors, becoming a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) at its peak, but weakening occurred before Florence struck the coastline of North Carolina near Wrightsville Beach on September 14, with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). Florence dealt a devastating blow to the Carolinas as it meandered across the region. Catastrophic, record-breaking flooding contributed to a majority of the storm's $24 billion in damage and 52 deaths, though significant storm surge along the coastline as well as an inland tornado outbreak caused severe damage as well. In early October, Hurricane Michael formed in the western Caribbean Sea, resulting in significant flooding across Central America and Cuba. However, the majority of the storm's impact was felt in the Florida Panhandle, where Michael struck the coastline near Mexico Beach as a Category 5 hurricane, with winds of 160 mph (260 km/h). This constituted the first landfall of a Category 5 hurricane in the United States since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and only the fifth in recorded history, alongside \\"Labor Day\\", Camille, and \\"Okeechobee\\". In addition, Michael became the third deepest by atmospheric pressure, the fourth strongest by maximum winds, and the latest Category 5 hurricane to strike the United States on record. Michael killed 74 people and caused $25 billion in damage. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.

It carries National Highway 66 (NH 66) over the tidal part of the Mandovi River. It is long, making it the third longest cable-stayed bridge in India. Two wheelers, three wheelers and bullock carts are prohibited from using the Atal Setu due to its height of . It officially opened on 5 February 2019. Illuminated bridge at night  History  The Atal Setu is one of the most famous and longest bridges in Goa. It is the third bridge to be built over the Mandovi River. Before the First Mandovi Bridge was built, the ferry was the main mode of transport across the Mandovi River in the 1970s, between Panaji and Betim village. Due to heavy traffic, the first bridge was built in the 1970s. In 1986 the first bridge collapsed and was rebuilt. The second bridge was constructed in 1998 to accommodate heavy transport vehicles. Construction began on the third bridge in 2014. The reason for the third cable-stayed bridge is to accommodate heavy traffic, especially during the peak year-end tourist season. The bridge was inaugurated on 27 January 2019.  Construction  On 14 June 2014, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the third Mandovi bridge. The bridge was completed on 27 January 2019 and inaugurated by the Central Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari; and later by Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar in the presence of former deputy Chief Minister of Goa Sudin Dhavalikar, who was the State Minister for Roads at the time. This bridge was named Atal Setu after former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. On 5 February, the bridge was opened for vehicular traffic. alt= Larsen and Toubro (L&T;) were awarded the EPC contract at a bid of ₹ 403.00 crore to build and design the bridge. It is a cable-stayed bridge constructed between the first and second parallel bridges and is 15 meters higher than the existing two bridges. This is Goa's longest bridge and India's third longest cable-stayed bridge. The bridge is a 900 m four lane bridge with a 550 m cable stay portion and a 3.2 km viaduct approach. The main bridge is 600 m in length with two end spans of 75 m and three interior spans of 150 m. The main bridge superstructure consists of a 21 m wide externally strutted segmented concrete box girder with a dual carriageway of 2 x 8.5 m with a 3 m wide median at the centre. The box girder is supported by stay cables anchored in the pylon and stressed from a box girder bottom. Another flyover arising from the Merces-Old Goa bypass road joins the Mandovi bridge for traffic from Ponda towards Panjim. The revised cost of construction of the bridge was ₹ 860 crore and the cost could increase by ₹ 50 crore. The Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) said that almost 10 crore litres of water was saved while building the bridge.  Finance  During the laying of the foundation stone, the Government of Goa claimed that the bridge would be funded independently. The loan agreement was signed on 8 June 2015 between the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and the nodal agency, who granted a loan amount of ₹ 462.60 crores. The original cost was estimated to be ₹470 crores, that has risen to ₹860 crores. With a re-payment period of 12 years, the government is supposed to pay an interest of ₹48 crores annually for the loan. The total amount to be repaid to NABARD by the end of June 2027, therefore, stands at ₹ 866.44 crore. The bridge is the most expensive in Goan history. On 20 March 2018, the Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Nitin Gadkari, said that the central government would bear 50 percent of the bridge's cost, which is ₹400 crores and an additional ₹50 crores for the road connecting the bridge.  Incidents  On 26 December 2016, a worker died on the construction site after suffering from 90 percent burns after a fire broke out in an 8 meter deep vertical tunnel of the under construction bridge pillar. On 30 December 2017, a fire broke out on an under construction pier supporting the cable-stayed bridge; however, there were no casualties and the situation was brought under control.  Traffic  Mandovi Bridge is one of the most heavily used bridges in Goa. According to GSIDC sources, almost 66,000 vehicles travel over the bridge every day. Due to high wind speeds, GSIDC announced that two- wheelers and three-wheelers are prohibited from using Atal Setu.  Criticism   Environmental issues  The construction of the third bridge was challenged by the Goa Foundation, who alleged that it is being constructed without an Environment Clearance. It also challenged the destruction of some 247 mangrove trees for constructing ramps to access the bridge. According to the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation's Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report as requested by National Green Tribunal, the construction of the bridge would destroy mangroves and impact marine ecology. The EIA stated that there would be no loss to flora and fauna. However, the mangroves will be replaced at suitable sites identified by the Forest Department, and marine ecology will be restored as stated by the EIA.

He began shooting in Redmond on July 1, the day after the premiere of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie. The 25-member cast also included veteran Jeff Harry Woolf and newcomer Sarah Wayn, and animatronic and computer animated rats were added as the villains. The actors shot their scenes in front of a blue screen.https://www.grnrngr.com/documents/maxmouze/prnl81.txt The game contains 3D computer graphic environments created from Silicon Graphics. The game had a budget in excess of $1 million. It contained an original screenplay and soundtrack. The CD Rom version of the game was underwent testing in August 1995. It was be distributed through Broderbund Software's Affiliated Label Program. A 45-minute video version of \\"Piper\\" was created by Splash Studios for broadcast and home video release, and the game's assets were adapted into an online adventure game called \\"Midas Valley Gold Rush\\" for the Splash Kids forum on then-upcoming MSN platform. In creating this game, Splash Studios intended to create a new genre: \\" a movie kids can watch in episodes, punctuated by interactive games\\".  Plot  The game takes place in Midas Valley, and in gold mines located underneath the town.  Gameplay  The game merges time-sensitive puzzles with a linear storyline. Each of the four episodes give the player the option to listen to Beavis and Butt-Head-style commentary on the action. The game contains six songs, which were included as a bonus audio disk.  Critical reception  The Seattle Times deemed it a \\" technically stunning interactive movie \\", and noted that their play testers enjoyed replaying scenes to learn lines of songs and sing along. The game was highly recommended by Billboard, noting that it pushed the boundaries rather than being another Living Books clone.

In April 2011, GVB, Amsterdam ordered 70 Citea. In January 2013, VDL received an order for 60 Citea LLEs from Rheinbahn. The two test vehicles of the lightweight model previously achieved higher fuel savings in a two-year test than a hybrid vehicle, which was also tested by the Rheinbahn in the same period. In 2014, the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) signed a supply contract with VDL for up to 236 VDL Citea, which was to modernise the fleet of Berlin's public transport companies by 2019. The first 40 vehicles were delivered in 2015, until 2016, the delivery of another 70 vehicles. In October 2016, the BVG announced not to retrieve all 236 vehicles from the contract. It remains with the 110 previously delivered vehicles. A justification why not all vehicles are retrieved from the supply contract has not been formally named.

History  Old Wolfstein was probably built under Emperor Frederick Barbarossa around 1160/70 to guard and administer the Imperial Estate around Kaiserslautern. The castle is first recorded in 1275 as Woluistein.Magnus Backes: Staatliche Burgen, Schlösser und Altertümer in Rheinland-Pfalz. At that time it was occupied by imperial ministeriales. In the 14th century the castle acted as security (Pfandobjekt), and, as an imperial pledge (Reichspfand), ended up in the possession of the counts of Sponheim and counts of Veldenz. Baldwin of Luxembourg made several unsuccessful attempts to acquired the castle through an imperial mortgage (Reichspfandschaft). Repeated raids on the castle defenders, who came from Sponheim ministeriales families, led to armed conflicts. In 1362 the Bishop of Speyer occupied the castle; in 1400 the Archbishops of Mainz and Trier, the Duke of Lorraine and Count Palatine Rupert III besiegd the castle. As a consequence, Electoral Palatinate received a quarter of the castle. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Electoral Palatinate and the Duchy of Zweibrücken fought for possession of the castle. The dispute ended in 1504 with its destruction by Prince-Elector Philip of the Palatinate. After that, Old Wolfstein was allowed to fall into ruin. In the 19th and 20th centuries the ruins came into the possession of the Kingdom of Bavaria and, since 1963, have been managed by the Castle Authorities of Rhineland-Palatinate (Schlösserverwaltung von Rheinland-Pfalz). The latter carried out safety work on the walls in the years 1979 to 1981 and 1985 to 1986. The remains of the castle ruins include a 20-metre-high bergfried.  Site  From the platform of the pentangular bergfried there is a very good view of the surrounding area. The walls of the small cast are a well preserved example of High Hohenstaufen architecture. Another feature of this design is the elongated tip of the side of the bergfried facing the likely direction of attack. To the north of the ruins on a steep hillside is rubble from an old wall, which is evidence of the formerly, lower lying outer ward of the castle. From 1961 to 1975 remains of a castle residence (Burghaus), a gate tower and a water well were uncovered.  Accident  A close observation of the interior wall of the ruined bergfried reveals at a certain height the handle and rear part of a trowel. This tool was probably embedded there by workmen in memory of a colleague who fell and was killed during restoration work. This trowel is supposed to have been worked into the wall at the exact height from which the man fell (the exact date must be before 1970, but cannot be more precisely estimated).

Her youngest sister, Margaret married a Miles Hobart whose identity is unclear, in later years Theodosia Dudley moved to Norwich to be near Margaret. On 11 July 1605 Mary married the wealthy Scottish widower Alexander Home, 1st Earl of Home (c. 1566 – 1619), a marriage perhaps arranged by James VI and I and intended to effect the Anglicization of Scottish aristocracy.Keith Brown, ‘The Scottish Aristocracy, Anglicisation and the Court, 1603-1638’, The Historical Journal, vol. 36 no. 3 (September 1993), pp. 543-576, 546, 551-2.

Lady Home bought and extended Lauderdale House at Highgate She kept detailed inventories of her houses which record purchases made in London, listing beds, tapestries, and her books including volumes of sermons and a work penned by Esther Inglis.Marie-Louise Coolahan & Mark Empey, 'Women's Book Ownership and the Reception of Early Modern Women's Texts', in Leah Knight, Micheline White, Elizabeth Sauer, Women’s Bookscapes in Early Modern Britain: Reading, Ownership, Circulation (Michigan, 2018), pp. 234, 238. She had distilling equipment, loadstones, telescopes, a weather glass, and bronzes by Francesco Fanelli. She listed paintings by subject and noted that some were bought from George Geldorp (d. 1665), others from the New Exchange, many with religious subjects including the Nativity and Christ and the Samaritan Woman. She also acquired items with Harrington knot heraldry from the sale of the effects of her cousin the Countess of Bedford. These inventories include notes she wrote for her housekeepers and their written replies which form short dialogues. Lady Home wrote of an unsatisfactory inventory that it \\"has byn wildely tacken in & are no way to bee trusted tow for comparein them with my own little book.

Family and Legacy In May 1622 at Whitehall Palace her son James, Earl of Home, married Catherine Cary daughter of Henry Cary, 1st Viscount Falkland (c.1575 – 1633) and Elizabeth Cary née Tanfield. John Chamberlain noted that the marriage had been arranged by the king.Norman Egbert McClure, The Letters of John Chamberlain, vol. 2 (Philadelphia, 1939), p. 437. In Scotland, before the wedding, following the king's instructions, the lawyer Thomas Haddington convened a meeting of the six lairds of the Home surname to tell them about the marriage plans. They promised to help the earl, but had reservations, hoping that Lady Home would \\"make her intentions and courses known to them\\" and she would \\"hear and respect their faithful advice\\" concerning the earl, and if she neglected to consult them, they could have \\"no contentment in the business.\\"The Melros Papers, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1837), pp. 403-4. After Catherine's death in childbirth in 1625, James married Grace Fane, daughter of Francis Fane, 1st Earl of Westmorland (1583/4–1629).Barbara Kiefer Lewalksi, Writing Women in Jacobean England (Cambridge, Mass, 1993), pp. 184-5: Meikle (2008). James still had legal guardians called \\"curators\\" including the Earl Marischal, the Earl of Morton, and Sir Robert Kerr of Ancram, a gentleman in the king's bedchamber. Mary wrote to Morton (who was in England) for help over dowry payments, wanting an installment of £1000 Sterling cash sent to her in Scotland rather than allow the Earl of Westmorland to invest the money in a project in England and buy land. She hoped the rest of the curators would agree with her, deferring to their \\"wiser judgements\\" but insisting \\"I will bee the last consentor to such a bisnes\\". She wanted the cash for dowries for her daughters.The Home/Fane marriage contract is held at Northampton Record Office and letters from Mary Sutton at the National Library of Scotland, Morton Papers MS 80/2. Mary Mildmay Fane, Countess of Westmorland wrote letters to her daughter Grace in Scotland solicitous of her health, including passages in cipher, one referring to loss of her hair through illness. She hoped Grace would come to London to take her sisters to see the masques at court in 1631, Love's Triumph Through Callipolis and Chloridia. James died in London in February 1633, attended by the court physician Théodore de Mayerne,Marilyn M. Brown & Michael Pearce, 'The Gardens of Moray House, Edinburgh', Garden History 47:1 (2019), p. 6. and Grace died soon afterwards at Apethorpe. The two countesses continued a bitter lawsuit over their children's properties. Westmorland complained that Home had the advantage in Scottish courts from her continual residence and acquaintance in Edinburgh.Calendar State Papers Domestic, Charles I: 1635, vol. 8, p. 610: TNA SP14/305 f.210. The earldom passed to a distant cousin James Home, 3rd Earl of Home (1615–1666). Mary wrote to Sir David Home of Wedderburn from Aldersgate after James' death about the future of the Home family, name, and \\"ancient raice\\", asking him to \\"express your love both to the living and to the dead\\".HMC Milne Home of Wedderburn Castle (London, 1902), p. 98 no. 219, the letter was written by her Scottish secretary. Lady Moray and Lady Lauderdale A Scottish author Patrick Hannay (fl. 1616–1630) dedicated A happy husband or, Directions for a Maide to choose her Mate, As also, a Wives behaviour towards her Husband after Marriage (Edinburgh, 1618/1619?) to Mary's eldest daughter Margaret Home (d. 1683), who married James Stewart, 4th Earl of Moray in 1628. Hannay's title refers to Sir Thomas Overbury. In 1632 Mary's younger daughter Lady Anne Home married John Maitland later Duke of Lauderdale. Anne inherited her mother's properties and furnishings in London. Lady Home's will Mary made a will in 1638 reflecting her English and Scottish properties and identity. She hoped her granddaughters would inherit her furnishings and collection, dividing house contents in London and Scotland between them, according to the inventories of each house. She was aware that this was problematic, writing \\"And I am not ignorant that my houses both in Edinborough as Canongate and in Aldersgate Street being inheritance I cannot dispose so of them by this my late will neither by the laws of England nor Scotland\\". Amongst personal bequests to her family and servants, she left a purse of gold coins to her nephew, Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg, the son of her sister Anne (Dudley) Sutton. The will appointed her granddaughter Lady Mary Stewart (d. 1668) as executor, but she was still a minor when the countess died in London in March 1644. Her daughters and their husbands instead acted as executors.Marilyn M. Brown & Michael Pearce, 'The Gardens of Moray House, Edinburgh', Garden History 47:1 (2019), p. 5, citing 'Will of Maria Soton, Countess of Home', TNA Prob/11/272/611 ff. 403-6, and NLS MS. 14547. The will and the Commonwealth In 1648 Lauderdale's share of her possessions and furniture in London was forfeited by his delinquency and given to John Ireton and William Geere. Claims that the furnishings belonged to his daughter or had been sold to a Scottish merchant in London, Robert English, were disregarded. Some goods at Aldersgate were sold in October 1648. It also came to light that Mary had lent £2,000 to the Earl of Cleveland and obtained property in Hackney and Stepney, and £1000 to Elizabeth Ashfield, a neighbour in Aldersgate, gaining her lands at North Barsteed in Suffolk.Calendar of the Proceedings of the Committee for Advance of Money, 1642-1656, part 2 (London, 1888), p. 948-952, the National Library of Scotland holds related papers and charters from the archive of the Tweeddale archive, including the Lauderdale's marriage contract, and the executry papers MS 14547. A challenge to the administration of the will by a third-party William Dudley, demonstrating that goods belonged not to Lauderdale but to his daughter, and that the executors had not been lawfully appointed, failed in 1658. Lauderdale was enabled to recover his property at the Restoration. It is due to the complexities of dividing her goods and this legal battle that her inventories survive to give a unique insight into the material culture of Anglo-Scottish aristocrat in the 1630s.Marilyn M. Brown & Michael Pearce, 'The Gardens of Moray House, Edinburgh', Garden History 47:1 (2019), p. 5. The inventories include a set of portraits after Van Dyck now at Darnaway Castle.Karen Hearn, Van Dyck & Britain (Tate: London, 2009), p. 178. Children Lady Home had seven children, all of whom were born in Scotland attended by Mrs Cuthbert, an English midwife.Will of Maria Soton, Countess of Home, TNA Prob/11/272/611 ff. 403-6, and NLS MS. 14547. Three reached adulthood; James, Margaret and Anne. One child was born in Scotland in October 1612. Anne of Denmark sent instructions to the chamberlain of her Dunfermline estates, Henry Wardlaw of Pitreavie, to distribute presents of money at the christening, and Ann Hay, Lady Winton was to be her representative.John Fernie, A History of the Town of Dunfermline (Dunfermline, 1815), p. 105.

Law On February 27, 1929, the government passed the Dangerous Drugs Act which dealt with drug offences in the Bahamas, including cannabis. In 1962, Act 26 amended the Act, providing a new definition of Indian hemp which, \\"includes all parts of the plant Cannabis Sativa whether growing or not from which the resin has not been extracted; the resin extracted from any part of such plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt derivative, mixture or preparation of such plant or resin. Possession =Offence= Section 29(6) of the Dangerous Drugs Act deals with simple possession of cannabis: :Where any drug to which this Act applies is, without the proper authority, found in the possession of any person or stored or kept in a place other than a place prescribed for the storage or keeping of such drug, such person, or the occupier or owner of such place or the owner of or other person responsible for the keeping of such drug unless he can prove such drug was deposited there without his knowledge or consent, shall be guilty of an offence against this Act. =Sentence= Anyone convicted of possession of cannabis, is liable: :on conviction on information: ::a fine of $125,000.00 or imprisonment for 10 years, or both, pursuant to Section 29(2)(a) of the Act. :on summary conviction, ::a fine of $50,000.00 or imprisonment for 5 years, or both, pursuant to Section 29(2)(a) of the Act.

Economy The Bahamas role as a transit country for cannabis is noted as beginning in 1968, when 300 pounds of cannabis were flown from Jamaica to Bimini. As recently as 2010 the country was noted as a midpoint for Jamaican cannabis being smuggled to the United States. Historically the Bahamas was a drug trafficking country, but not a drug producing one, until a 1991 seizure of 40,000 cannabis seedlings and 1,000 adult plants on Andros Island called that assumption into question. Present-day status In January 2018, the Caribbean Community Regional Commission held a town hall meeting in Nassau on the issue of decriminalizing cannabis. CARICOM Regional Commission on Marijuana published a report recommending the declassification of marijuana as a dangerous drug in all legislation and the reclassification of the drug as a controlled substance, similarly to tobacco and alcohol. The report stated that the Bahamas could see a financial benefit of around $5 million from the legalization of the substance and regulation of its sale. The Bahamas National Commission on Marijuana has been tasked with exploring and making recommendations to the government on the issue of cannabis. It is expected to deliver its first draft to the government by August 2019, after receiving a three-month extension to present its findings.

She was the daughter of Else Levy Heinemann and Hugo Heinemann, a socialist lawyer who defended trade unionists and political activists in court. This environment nurtured her interest in politics and during the First World War she became a member of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany. In 1924 she married Walter Fabian, a fellow social democratic activist. She became disillusioned with the politics of the Social Democratic Party of Germany and joined the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany. Exile After being detained by the Nazis in March 1933, she decided to leave Germany rather than risk re-arrest. She fled first to Prague, then Paris, finally arriving in London on 8 September 1933. She had an invitation from John Paton, a leading figure in the Independent Labour Party. She had sufficient funds to be allowed to stay for a month with the proviso she did not work. Death She was found dead alongside Mathilde Wurm in their London flat in Guilford Street on 4 April 1935. The coronial inquest attracted a great deal of interest and was attended by Fenner Brockway, James Maxton, Ben Riley as well as by Ernst Toller, who travelled from Paris to attend. Karl Korsch was a witness, having been in a relationship with Fabian. Indeed he had ended the relationship and this was used as an argument to suggest that Fabian was suffering from depression.

Freeling on the north-western boundary The town of Nuriootpa is at the north eastern corner of the hundred. Other towns within the hundred are Freeling, whose the southern and oldest parts straddle the north border of the hundred, and Greenock, also in the hundred's north. The localities of Nain, Kingsford, Shea-Oak Log, Daveyston, Seppeltsfield, Marananga, Stone Well and Gomersal as well as parts of Templers, Roseworthy, Concordia, Rosedale, Lyndoch, Rowland Flat and Tanunda are also within the hundred.

Local government Apart from the very small portion of land occupied by the Town of Gawler at the south-western corner of the hundred, the earliest local government in the hundred was established in 1867 with the establishment of the District Council of Nuriootpa, spanning the remainder of the hundred. In 1892 the Nuriootpa council annexed a portion of the District Council of Light to the north-west, bringing the township of Freeling (on the hundred's north border) under the governance of a single body. In 1910 the township of Nuriootpa in the hundred's north-east corner was annexed by the District Council of Angaston but the vast bulk of the hundred remained under the governance of the Nuriootpa council. In 1918 the Nuriootpa council changed its name to Freeling in line with the location of the council seat. In 1977 Freeling and Mudla Wirra council (to the west) were amalgamated to form the new District Council of Light (the second of that name). In 1996 the Light council amalgamated with the District Council of Kapunda (to the north) to form the present-day Light Regional Council. The Nuriootpa township portion of the hundred at the north- east corner remained under the governance of Angaston council until 1996 when Angaston was amalgamated with Tanunda and the old Barossa district councils to form the present-day Barossa Council.

It is a form of divorce (though invalid) and if a husband says these words to his wife, it is not lawful for him to have intercourse with her unless he recompense by freeing a slave or fasting for two successive months or feeding sixty poor people.  Background  Zihar was accepted as a declaration of divorce among pre-Islamic Arabs and it is mentioned in the Quran in reference to Khawla bint Tha'labah, who was divorced by this formula in the chapter 58, verses 1-4:  Legality  Zihar is illegal and considered an insult in the Islamic law. It implies that the man, declaring his wife akin to his mother or sister, is guilty of the sin of forbidding the lawful things. It has been proscribed by law and the act does not ensue in divorce. It is condemned in the law. Thus, penalties in the form of setting free a slave, fasting, or feeding the poor have been imposed for it.

Starting at the age of six as a chorister at Coventry Cathedral, and achieving greatest prominence as founder, leader, musical director and producer of Harvey and the Wallbangers, he has worked in a wide range of musical genres including classical, early music, pop and soul, jazz, folk and world music. __TOC__  Early life  Born in Coventry, Brough's musical education began at the age of six when he became a chorister at Coventry Cathedral. By the age of thirteen, he was a featured soloist on recordings including music by Bach and Britten. At the age of 17, he studied oboe at the Royal Academy of Music, taught by Evelyn, Lady Barbirolli. When he was seventeen, his elder brother Lester, then a medical student at Clare College, Cambridge, was killed in a motorcycle accident at the age of nineteen. This formative influence later became the inspiration for his composition Requiem in Blue. In 1978, Brough himself went to Clare College to study music as an undergraduate, where he was taught by the composer John Rutter. Whilst there, he founded, directed and sang in his own consort, the Cambridge University Consort of Voices, whose members included Mark Padmore, Charles Daniels, Gerald Finley and Christopher Purves. He also worked closely with Rutter's own ensemble, the Cambridge Singers.  Harvey and the Wallbangers  Whilst at Cambridge, Brough also formed his own band, Harvey and the Wallbangers. As well as Brough himself, the band's members included Christopher Purves, Jeremy Taylor, Jonny Griffiths, Neil McArthur (who performed under the name Reg Prescott), Richard Allen and Andrew Huggett. Each band member but Huggett, the drummer, contributed vocally to the music as well as playing a variety of instruments. The Wallbangers’ music drew on a variety of musical genres, including doo-wop, blues rock and vocal harmony. As well as performing, Brough acted as musical director and producer for the band. Harvey and the Wallbangers’ first performance was at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1981; they subsequently performed in a number of venues before becoming a full-time enterprise in 1983. Between then and 1987, they performed new stage shows regularly and in a variety of venues, including the Royal Albert Hall, Sadler's Wells Theatre, The Forum, Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club and the Tempodrom in Berlin, and made many television appearances. The band also performed at the Royal Variety Performance in 1984, and recorded an album with Simon Rattle in 1987. At the same time, he continued to play as a session musician with consorts including the Tallis Scholars, the Taverner Choir and other ensembles.  Early composing and arranging career  After Harvey and the Wallbangers’ final performance in May 1987, Brough's professional focus turned towards production and composition. During this time, he specialised in several genres, notably pop, jazz and film music. His work in pop included collaborations with Simon Law and Jazzie B, including the contribution of arrangements to Soul II Soul’s album Volume V Believe in 1995. His jazz career centred around a long collaboration with John Dankworth and his family; this acted as a key formative influence in his orchestration. With Jacqui Dankworth whom he married, he formed the band Field of Blue in 1996; they released two albums, a self-titled debut (1996) and Still (2000). Brough's composition career at that time was focused on film and television. Credits include the television series Paris for Channel 4, and BBC Radio 4's soap opera Citizens. His collaboration with composer Jocelyn Pook led to contributions to the soundtracks for the film Eyes Wide Shut and the television series In A Land of Plenty.  Requiem in Blue  Brough's most significant work from this time was his composition Requiem in Blue. This marked a transition for him from solely composing music to also writing lyrics. It combines the words of the requiem mass with a modern musical idiom that combines a wide range of styles, including choral music, folk songs, early music and jazz: the range of his influences to that point. The piece was commissioned by East England Arts and Wingfield Arts. It premiered at Eye Church, Suffolk in 1998, and was the winner of the first Andrew Milne Memorial Prize. It was recorded by Smudged Discs in 2010 with the choirs of Clare College Cambridge and Portsmouth Cathedral, alongside Brough's 2004 pieces Valete in Pace and i carry your heart.  Middle and later composing and arranging career  By the beginning of the twenty-first century, Brough's career largely centred on composition, predominantly working for commission and in partnership with other artists. Notable pieces composed during this time include Valete in Pace (2004), commissioned for the 60th anniversary of D-Day by Portsmouth City Council and the City of Caen and premiered at L'Abbaye aux Hommes, Caen on 6 June 2004. Stumbing over Infinity, a one-act opera written in collaboration with librettist Roswitha Gerlitz, was performed at the Firsts Season in the Linbury Studio Theatre at the Royal Opera House in 2007. The oratorio Thecla was commissioned by the Church of St Peter and St Paul, Wantage as part of an Arts Council-funded project, with a libretto by James Runcie. The suite A Fairy Dream, inspired by Purcell’s The Fairy Queen, was premiered at the Barbican Centre in 2009. The opera Beached, written in collaboration with Lee Hall, was commissioned by Opera North and performed at Bridlington Spa in 2011, with a cast of 300 singers. At the same time, Brough continued his work as a theatre musical director and working as a producer and arranger for other artists. From 2006 to 2009, he was musical director and producer for Natacha Atlas, acting as producer and arranger for her album Ana Hina. In 2006, he began a long-standing collaboration with singer Clara Sanabras that continues to this day, acting as producer and arranger for her work. The performance of her suite A Hum About Mine Ears at the Barbican Centre in 2016, with two choirs and the Britten Sinfonia, also featured his composition Take This Slave of Music.  Independent musical work and Vox Holloway  The formation of choir Vox Holloway in 2009 marked the beginning of Brough's career as an independent composer. As Vox Holloway's musical director and composer-in- residence, he has written a series of works that have been performed by the choir at St Luke's, West Holloway. New works by Brough that have been premiered by Vox Holloway include A Particulare Care, The Year of Jubilee, Adolesce, Cry Palestine, Linguis, Incantation of Eden, The City in the Sea and Music on the Mind. The choir has also performed works that have been premiered elsewhere, including Requiem in Blue, The Prophet, Thecla, Ona’s Flood and A Fairy Dream.  Other musical and academic appointments  In 2012, Brough was appointed Turner Sims Professor of Music at the University of Southampton. This permanent role was created for him so that he could take on the role of leader of the university's community choir, University of Southampton Voices; the choir performs his original works as well as other music. Brough has also worked extensively with children's choir Young Dissenters; children singing is a notable feature of his work. In May 2017, he was invited to conduct the junior LSO Discovery Choir for the London Symphony Orchestra between September 2017 and Easter 2018, replacing Lucy Griffiths.  Music and social activism  Brough's musical work is often themed around the opportunity to raise awareness of social injustice or other political issues. His composition Ona’s Flood, written as a companion piece to Britten’s Noye's Fludde, draws centrally on themes of climate change. A Particulare Care, written in response to a moving exhibit at the Foundling Museum, highlights the plight of orphans and the increasing problem of homelessness. Other works also carry significant social themes: The Year of Jubilee (2013) tells the story of the Fisk Jubilee Singers in a dramatic and moving depiction of slavery in the American South, while Music on the Mind (2015) is based on themes of mental illness; its premiere featured a performance from the Mind and Soul Community Choir, based at the Maudsley Hospital.

Some authorities list the species as being a Victorian endemic now extinct whilst others list is as occurring in New South Wales and extant. Descriptions of the species also differ. It has a single tube-shaped leaf and up to thirty five white flowers with purple or mauve marks. Description According to the National Herbarium of New South Wales, Prasophyllum suttonii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf up to long. Up to thirty five fragrant, crystalline white flowers with purple or mauve marks are crowded along a flowering stem which reaches to a height of . As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped to lance-shaped and up to long. The lateral sepals are up to long and usually free from each other, sometimes joined by a thin membrane. The petals are shaped like a spatula up to long. The labellum is broad lance-shaped to egg-shaped, about long and wide and turns sharply upwards near its middle, extending above the lateral sepals. The upturned edges of the labelled are crinkled or folded and there is a green, channelled callus along the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from January to March. The Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria and David Jones describe the species as having fewer flowers on the flowering stem, each with most of the flower organs smaller and appearing in December. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum suttonii was first formally described in 1912 by Richard Sanders Rogers and Bertha Rees and the description was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria from a specimen collected on Mount Buffalo. The specific epithet (suttonii) honours Charles Stanford Sutton, a medical practitioner, amateur botanist and long-time member of the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria. Distribution and habitat The mauve leek orchid grows in wet bogs in alpine and subalpine heath and grassland, mainly in the Kosciuszko National Park in New South Wales. Victorian authorities list the species as endemic to that state and \\"Presumed Extinct\\", not having been collected since 1902. Conservation The buffalo leek-orchid is not listed under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act but is listed as \\"Threatened\\" under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988.

Despite the name, it is located north-west of the city, near the historic site of Antipatris (Tel Afek). The station no longer serves passengers, but it remains operational as a freight terminal, and there are plans to reinstate the passenger service.  History  Ras al-Ayn railway station was built in 1915 by the Ottoman authorities in Palestine as part of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I. To allow rapid deployment of their troops southward, the Turks built the Eastern Railway from Afula, where it connected to Jezreel Valley railway, southwards via Jenin and Tulkarm to Lydda, where it connected to the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway and the Railway to Beersheba. The line was built as narrow gauge (1050 mm) like the rest of the Ottoman railways in the region, and was situated relatively inland to avoid the reach of naval guns from Royal Navy warships patrolling the Mediterranean coast. After the British conquered the area, they converted the Eastern Railway to standard gauge and extended it further northwards via Hadera, connecting Haifa with Lydda for onward journey west to Jaffa, east to Jerusalem, or south via Gaza City to El Kantara, Egypt. Thus, Ras al-Ayn railway station became part of the Palestine Railways main line. In 1921, a branch line was built from Ras al-Ayn station westwards to Petah Tikva. During the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, Jewish passengers on southbound main line trains alighted at Ras al-Ayn and changed onto buses, in order to avoid passing through Lod. In 1946, Irgun militants bombed the station building, which at this time was mainly used by British troops stationed in the area.מקומות The city of Rosh HaAyin, founded in 1949, later became the main settlement served by the station, and so the station was renamed. After the establishment of State of Israel, the branch line to Petah Tikva railway station, dubbed Yarkon Railway, was extended further westwards, reaching Tel Aviv North railway station in 1949, and later connected to the Coastal Railway in 1953. When the passenger service on the Eastern Railway ceased in 1969, Rosh HaAyin railway station was closed. Yet, on 3 June 2000, the station reopened as the eastern terminus of the new Yarkon Railway passenger service between Tel Aviv and Rosh HaAyin. In 2003, this service was extended into Hod HaSharon; for this, a new connection between Yarkon Railway and Eastern Railway was built, which avoided the need to reverse the train at Rosh HaAyin. The old Rosh HaAyin station thus remained inaccessible to the extended service, and the new Rosh HaAyin North railway station opened on 13 September 2003 at a location about 2 km north of the old one. Since then, Rosh HaAyin South railway station is only used by the freight services between the north of Israel and Lod, in order to bypass the congested Ayalon Railway.  Future plans  The government of Israel announced plans to revive the Eastern Railway at a projected cost of NIS 8 billion (appx. US$ 2.2 billion), reinstating a service from Haifa via Hadera and Rosh HaAyin to Lod which would bypass the congested Coastal railway. The rebuilt Rosh HaAyin South railway station would be connected to the city with a footbridge over Highway 6. However, the construction is not expected to start before 2020.

Both two nations were once part of Spain, having shared cultural and linguistic tie developed from Spanish rule, and also embracing democracy and allies of the United States. Therefore, two countries enjoy a close tie and fond between each other. Both are members of Pacific Alliance, MERCOSUR, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and Organization of American States. Chile maintains an embassy and a consulate in Bogotá while Colombia maintains an embassy and a consulate in Santiago. Embassy of Chile in Bogotá Historical As both nations were colonized by Spanish Empire, Chile and Colombia developed a strong tie based on Hispanic heritages over two nations. Both two nations later were active at the Latin American wars of independence from Spain, and as such, gave such revered heroes like Bernardo O'Higgins and Simón Bolívar. In the later part, Chilean stability had been an attractive destination for Colombian immigrants who wanted to escape from the country's instability, especially during the Colombian conflict. Chile had protected Colombian sovereign border during the Panama crisis of 1885, when the United States sent a short-lived military intervention. Colombia had remained neutral during the War of the Pacific. Modern relations Trade between two countries, however, have been still modest level as for 2009, however both have expressed to expand the relationship into a larger level. There are over 20.000 Colombian nationals living in Chile. (in Spanish) However, several concerns, such as racism, still exists in Chile towards Colombian immigrants, as Chile has a higher economic development comparing to Colombia.

The park's major source of energy is solar energy. The Park is located on Al Warqa 5 on the Hatta Road. The park has 2,500 animals from more than 250 species.

On May 15, 2018, the Park closed for renovations and improvements and remained closed for the next nine months.  History  The old Dubai zoo was replaced to Dubai Safari Park when It only had a collection of 1000 animals. The park consist of 12.8 Million square feet of area. The old park had faced criticism internationally about the conditions the animals were kept in: Caged up, very little space, barely able to move. It was obvious that there had to be a much larger, more open, more modern habitat for the animals. Keeping in mind the tourism increase in Dubai, the municipality took a decision of increasing and moderating the Dubai zoo. $40.8 million where allocated to the project. The Project was given to meraas, a UAE conglomerate. Parques Reunidos is hired as operation manager. The Park was opened on 12 December 2017, but closed for renovations and improvements in May 2018.  Villages  Addaxes at Dubai Safari Park The Park have major five Areas named as Safari village, Arabian Village, Asian Village, African Village and Wadi Village.

Eisenhower not to eject lesbian members of the WAC as he had been ordered by President Truman. Early life Johnnie Phelps was born in North Carolina as Nell Louise Phelps on April 4, 1922, and was raised with an adoptive family. Military career Johnnie Phelps joined the first Women's Army Corps battalion during World War II and she arrived to the rank of Sergeant. She first served in the South Pacific working as a medic and later she reenlisted and was sent to Germany as part of the Post-WWII Occupation forces (under?) Eisenhower. Wounded in action in Philippines, she received the Purple Heart and was honorably discharged in 1945. She re-enlisted in 1946 and was assigned to head the motor pool for General Eisenhower. She claimed in an interview with Bunny MacCulloch in 1982, that in 1947 she was told by General Eisenhower, \\"It's come to my attention that there are lesbians in the WACs, we need to ferret them out....\\" Phelps replied, \\"If the General pleases, sir, I'll be happy to do that, but the first name on the list will be mine.\\" Eisenhower's secretary added, \\"If the General pleases, sir, my name will be first and hers will be second.\\" Phelps then told Eisenhower, \\"Sir, you're right, there are lesbians in the WACs – and if you want to replace all the file clerks, section commanders, drivers, every woman in the WAC detachment, I will be happy to make that list. But you must know, sir, that they are the most decorated group – there have been no illegal pregnancies, no AWOLs, no charges of misconduct.\\" Eisenhower dropped the idea. Later Phelps said, \\"There were almost nine hundred women in the battalion. I could honestly say that 95 percent of them were lesbians\\". She was honorably discharged a second time. Later career Phelps left the army to establish her own printing business, which she ran for years. Phelps joined the National Organization for Women and founded the San Gabriel Valley - Whittier chapter in 1979. She chaired the California Lesbian Task Force (a branch of California NOW), and spearheaded protests on behalf of the Norton Sound Eight - eight female crew members aboard the USS Norton Sound who were charged with \\"homosexual misconduct.\\" In addition, she joined the Southern California Women for Understanding organization and served on the Los Angeles County Veterans' Advisory Commission. A recovering alcoholic, she also served as president of the Alcoholism Center for Women. She was appointed by Gloria Molina to the Los Angeles Commission on Veterans' Affairs and resigned in 1996 due to severe health problems. She appeared in the Before Stonewall documentary, and she was interviewed for books, including, My Country, My Right to Serve by Mary Ann Humphrey, and Conduct Unbecoming by Randy Shilts. She appeared in the Trailblazers: Unsung Military Heroines of WWII documentary by Mindy Pomper, shown ad infinitum at the Women's Memorial in Washington D.C. Personal life Phelps married a Navy man, but the marriage was unhappy, and to escape it, she joined the military in 1943. Johnnie Phelps' first female lover died when their boat was bombed as they landed on Leyte, Philippines in 1944. Living in Southern California, Phelps became politically active in the 1970s. It was around this time that she met Grace Bukowski, her last partner, who survived her. Phelps died on December 30, 1997 at the Veterans Home in Barstow, and her ashes were buried with full honor in the U.S. Veterans Cemetery in Westwood, Los Angeles. Legacy In 1993, Veterans for Human Rights organized the annual Sgt. Johnnie Phelps Annual Awards Banquet in Portland, Oregon.

Madrid is the only city that had derby matches in the UEFA Champions League Final (2014 UEFA Champions League Final, 2016 UEFA Champions League Final) Introduction Madrid is home to La Liga football club giant Real Madrid, who play their home games at the Santiago Bernabéu. Their supporters are referred to as Madridistas or Merengues (Meringues). Real Madrid was voted by fans as the best club of the 20th century (FIFA Club of the Century), being the current leader of the European teams ranking and the most valuable sports team in the world. Real Madrid have won the European Cup (UEFA Champions League) a record 13 times. The latest of their 34 La Liga titles came in 2020. Their successful hometown rivals, Atlético Madrid, are also well-supported in the city and play their home games at the Wanda Metropolitano. Their supporters are referred to as Atléticos or Colchoneros (The Mattressers), in reference to the team's red and white jersey colours. Atlético is considered a European elite team, having reached in the last five seasons, two UEFA Champions League finals. Historically, Atletico has won 10 national league titles and 10 national cup titles. The final matches for the UEFA Euro 1964 and the 1982 FIFA World Cup, were held at Bernabéu, thus making Madrid the first city in Europe to host both a UEFA European Championship and a FIFA World Cup final. Some of Spain's top footballers are Madrilenas (born in Madrid), including Real Madrid former captains Emilio Butragueño (and co- teammate of La Quinta del Buitre, \\"The Vulture's Cohort\\"), Raúl or Iker Casillas and Atlético Madrid player Fernando Torres. Nowadays you can join amateur pick up sessions by signing up on the www.footballinmadrid.es platform. This is a really interesting way to play your favorite sport and meet people at the same time. With football, you'll never be alone in Madrid.  History  In 2018, Madrid produced two clubs, UEFA Champions League winner - Real Madrid CF and Europa League winner - Atlético Madrid winner.

Bambu made use of blackface, a persona Radical would later adopt in majority of his early visuals. 2015 After supporting Young Fathers on tour, Radical later released \\"Open Hand\\" a record that saw him adopt a much more political stance in his music. premiering the visual at Tate Britain in 2015. Radical aimed to offer an alternative outlook on socio-political issues. He later followed up with a record called \\"Kwame Nkrumah\\" before releasing the 23Winters EP in February 2016. \\"Kwame Nkrumah\\" was written in honour of the first Ghanaian president and Ghana's independence. The 23Winters EP was a personal analysis of a relationship between father and son, with themes of religion, society, family, love, new-age revolution and African diaspora narrated by Kojey's father. The project includes production from KZ The Producer, Fwdslxsh, Lupus Cain, Selvsse, Niels Kirk & New Machine as well as collaborations from Tom Grenan, Ray Blk & Bobii Lewis. It has been described as \\"a supreme phonic proclamation of one’s ethnicity, history and future.\\" In an interview with The Source Magazine Radical stated his intention was to \\"...create a body of work that voices my ideas and philosophies while also offering another sense of perspective... \\" 23Winters also saw Kojey nominated for two MOBO Awards, one for Best Newcomer and one for Best Video. The project independently debuted at no.3 in the UK Rap & Hip Hop Albums Charts, while simultaneously entering the UK top 40. 2017 2017 saw Radical return with his longest project to date, In Gods Body. with features from Shola Ama, Ghetts, Tamera Foster, Miloh Smith, Dance music producer Potè, Obongjayar and British actress and screenwriter Michaela Coel who recites a poem written by Kojey that serves as a central narration to the project. The project was a continuation of 23Winters honing in on some of the messages recited by Radical's father and developed into a journey of self discovery. Radical deconstructed the politics of black identity and race while introducing conversations about sexuality and love. Since the release of 23Winters Radical has toured the world independently playing in Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, South Africa, Russia and much of Europe His longest lasting brand relationship has been with Adidas. Radical and Adidas teamed up to create a short film about mental health and depression alongside director Max Luz and international fashion platform SSense.

This lake extends into the townships of La Ronde, Marin, Margry, Lespérance, Lesueur and Le Tac. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector. Recreational tourism activities come second with a navigable water body of across Lake Lichen, plus an extension of with the Wachigabau Lake. Lake Lichen is formed by an enlargement of the Opawica River and integrates into Wachigabau Lake which includes a dam at its mouth. The northwestern portion of the Lichen Lake hydrographic slope is accessible through the forest road route 113 passing north-west of Opawica Lake and connecting Chibougamau to Lebel-sur-Quévillon. The north side of the lake is accessible via the Canadian National Railway which passes over a strip of land between Opawica Lake and Wachigabau Lake. The surface of Lichen Lake is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice movement is generally from mid- November to mid-April.  Geography  Formed by a widening of the Opawica River, this lake has a length of , a maximum width of and an altitude of . The shape of the lake looks like a big Z spilled and lying on its side. The southwestern part of the lake has an extension of where the Céré Lake outlet discharges. Lichen Lake is mainly fed by: * the Opawica River (coming from the Northeast), which is the outlet of Lessard Lake which is at higher, and * the Nicobi River (coming from the South). The Opawica River from the East first crosses the Lichen Lakes and Wachigabau before discharging into Opawica Lake via two entry points which are located at each end of Gull Island (length: ; width: ). This island and the two peninsulas (one extending westward on from the east shore, and the other from the west stretching on ) form a strip of land of in length that runs the full length of the Canadian National railway. The mouth of this lake Lichen is located north of the western part of the lake, in the canton of Lespérance, that is to say: * south-west of the mouth of Wachigabau Lake; * South of the mouth of the Opawica River; * south-east of the village center of Waswanipi; * southeast of the mouth of Goéland Lake (Waswanipi River); * south-east of the mouth of the Nottaway River; * east of downtown Matagami; * south-west of downtown Chibougamau.Distances measured from the Atlas of Canada (published on the Internet) of the Department of Natural Resources Canada. The main hydrographic slopes near Lake Lichen are: *North side: Wachigabau Lake, Opawica Lake, Opawica River, Chibougamau River, Waswanipi River; *East side: Opawica River, Germain Creek, Germain Lake, Lessard Lake, Doda Lake; *South side: Margry Creek, Margry Lake, Nicobi River, Nicobi Lake, Pierrefonds River; *West side: Wachigabau Lake, Auger Creek, Bachelor River, Lake Waswanipi, Pusticamica Lake. From the dam at the mouth of Opawica Lake, the course of the Opawica River flows over first northeasterly to an elbow river, then northwest to its confluence with the Chibougamau River. This confluence of these two rivers becomes the head of the Waswanipi River. Toponymy Lichen is a plant material growing in northern or semi- northern environments.

The rule was proposed around 1980 by Norman Zadeh (son of Lotfi A. Zadeh), and has entered the folklore of convex optimization since then. Zadeh offered a reward of $1,000 to anyone who can show that the rule admits polynomially many iterations or to prove that there is a family of linear programs on which the pivoting rule requires subexponentially many iterations to find the optimum. Algorithm Zadeh's rule belongs to the family of history-based improvement rules which, during a run of the simplex algorithm, retain supplementary data in addition to the current basis of the linear program. In particular, the rule chooses among all improving variables one which has entered the basis least often, intuitively ensuring that variables that might yield a substantive improvement in the long run but only a small improvement in a single step will be applied after a linear number of steps. The supplementary data structure in Zadeh's algorithm can therefore be modeled as an occurrence record, mapping all variables to natural numbers, monitoring how often a particular variable has entered the basis. In every iteration, the algorithm then selects an improving variable that is minimal with respect to the retained occurrence record. Note that the rule does not explicitly specify which particular improving variable should enter the basis in case of a tie. Superpolynomial lower bound Zadeh's rule has been shown to have at least super-polynomial time complexity in the worse-case by constructing a family of Markov decision processes on which the policy iteration algorithm requires a super-polynomial number of steps. Running the simplex algorithm with Zadeh's rule on the induced linear program then yields a super-polynomial lower bound. The result was presented at the \\"Efficiency of the Simplex Method: Quo vadis Hirsch conjecture?\\" IPAM workshop in 2011 by Oliver Friedmannhttps://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/efficiency-of-the- simplex-method-quo-vadis-hirsch-conjecture/?tab=schedule.

He was the first Northern Minister of Education and Social Welfare, and later Minister of Finance and Treasurer of the NPC. Early life Aliyu Makama Bida was born in 1905 in Bida, Niger State. His father was a respected Qur'anic scholar in the Court of the Nobility. His admission into an elementary school was through the influence of his father. Typically for the Northern region, Aliyu started his early education in Quranic School in Bida, before registering in the provisional Elementary school of Bida town. Less usually, he did not end his education at that level. He went on to Katsina College, where he met majority of the Co-Northerners. They were to take charge and responsibility in shaping the political, economic and social fortunes of the North and lead the region to self-government. Career After completing his secondary education at Katsina College in 1927, Aliyu was employed to teach in Niger Middle School. He later became a headmaster. In 1942, he was employed by the Bida Native Authority (N.A) as a Councillor in charge of District Administration of education. Aliyu climbed the career ladder when he went for a course in Local Government in the United Kingdom around 1945. Later, he was a member of the African Conference. In 1952, he returned to the United Kingdom for the Cambridge Conference on Education. He was among the select few who attended the 1953 Constitutional talks, with some top Northerners from Nigerian society, in the United Kingdom. While he was serving in traditional Council of the Etsu Nupe, Aliyu Mahmud as he was well known was honoured with the traditional title of Makama Nupe. In 1955, Aliyu performed the first pilgrimage to Mecca in the company of Sir Ahmadu Bello, Sardauna Sokoto and other Ministers. A year before that pilgrimage, the Colonial Administration had seen the ability, courage and steadfastness of Aliyu, who was always dedicated to any assignment given to him. As a man who had shown great promise, the Sherwood Smith administration appointed Aliyu as the Northern Region's First Minister of Education and Social Welfare in 1952. The Ministry of Education and Social Welfare needed proper handling as a responsible place for laying a foundation for the future generation and that is why he was put in charge. Political career From teacher to headmaster, to N.A. Councillor and a Senior Minister with a responsible portfolio in Education, Aliyu Makama became a titan in the affairs of the North and as a member of Northern Peoples Congress (NPC). He rose to the position of Party Treasurer and took charge of the financial aspects of the NPC. He held the position throughout the existence of the Party. Though he is older than Sardauna of Sokoto, he was generally regarded as one of the closest allies and confidants to Sardauna. It was all due to the ultimate show of trust by the Sardauna of Sokoto to Aliyu Makama Bida. Aliyu frequently acted as Premier of Northern Nigeria any time the Premier travelled outside and the appointment was by Sardauna himself. Aliyu also served as the Northern Minister of Finance throughout the life span of their government. Aliyu Makama Nupe was also a member of the Civil Defence before he became Sector Commander for Niger. He was Chairman Jama’atu Nasrul Islam. The tough, dogged and trustworthy politician was also an athlete in his school days. He left an unbroken record of 30 years in 100 yards sprint. The elder statesman died in 1980 as the first Patron of then ruling National Party of Nigeria (NPN); a party considered as an offshoot of the Northern People Congress (NPC). Aliyu Mahmud Makama Bida was honoured with officer of Order of British Empire, (OBE) before he died. Death Alhaji Aliyu Makama died in 1980 of unknown causes.

He was the author of several books about Western artists like Pablo Picasso, Hieronymus Bosch, Paul Cézanne, Hans Holbein and Damien Hirst. In Totalitarian Art, he contended that totalitarian art looked the same regardless of the regime. Early life Igor Golomstock was born on 11 January 1929 in Kalinin, Soviet Union (now Tver, Russia). After his Karaite Jew father, Naum Kojak, was sent to a gulag, his parents divorced and Igor took his mother's name. From 1939 to 1943, as he was a teenager, Golomstock and his mother lived in Kolyma, a labour camp in the Russian Far East. Golomstock graduated from Moscow University, where he studied art history. Career Golomstock began his career by working for the Soviet Ministry of Culture. He was also a resident scholar at the Pushkin Museum, and he taught art history at his alma mater, Moscow University. After emigrating to the United Kingdom in 1972, he taught art history at University of Essex, the University of St Andrews and the University of Oxford. In 1977, he \\"co-curated the exhibition Unofficial Art from the Soviet Union at the Institute of Contemporary Arts\\" in London. He subsequently worked as a radio presenter on the BBC Russian Service. Golomstock was the author of several books. His first book, co-written with Andrei Sinyavsky, was about Pablo Picasso. His other books were about Hieronymus Bosch, Paul Cézanne, Hans Holbein and Damien Hirst. He was best-known for Totalitarian Art, first published in 1990 and republished in 2011, in which he contended that totalitarian art looked the same regardless of the regime. In particular he showed that both Nazism and Stalinism depicted \\"industrious families, idealistic soldiers and compassionate leaders.\\" Golomstock found similar features in Fascist and Maoist art. Golomstock authored his memoir in 2011. Personal life and death Golomstock married Nina Kazarovets in 1960; they had a son, Benjamin.

Research and students  Ben Aryeh Debby has published numerous scientific papers and has supervised Ph.D. and master's students. In her research, she is showing how the knowledge of history will help us to understand art. First Book Her first book \\"Renaissance Florence in the Rhetoric of Two Popular Preachers: Giovanni Dominici (1356-1419) and Bernardino da Siena (1380-1444)\\" focuses on historical research of Dominican and Franciscan preachers and analyzes sermons. It also includes a large, critical edition of an unpublished manuscript of mendicant sermons. Second Book Her second book \\"The Renaissance Pulpit: Art and Preaching in Italy, 1400-1550\\" which appeared in Italian as Il Pulpito Toscano tra 300 e 500. Roma: Istituto Poligrafico e Zecco: 2009, addresses visual material and examines the relationship between preaching and art, i.e., the use of works of art in sermons and the pulpit itself. It examines sculpted marble pulpits from an interdisciplinary perspective focusing on the connections between art, literature and religion. Third Book Her third book \\"The Cult of St. Clare of Assisi in Early Modern Italy\\" focuses on the cult of St. Clare of Assisi in visual images and textual sources. This work examines the representations of St Clare in the Italian visual tradition from the thirteenth century on, but especially between the fifteenth and the mid- seventeenth centuries, in the context of mendicant activity. Through an examination of such diverse visual images as prints, drawings, panels, sculptures, minor arts, and frescoes in relation to sermons of Franciscan preachers, the book highlights the cult of women saints and its role in the reform movements of the Osservanza and the Catholic Reformation and in the face of Muslim-Christian encounter of the early modern era. This book appeared in Italian as \\"L'iconografia di Santa Chiara d'Assisi. Fourth Book In her fourth book \\"Crusade Propaganda in Word and Image in Early Modern Italy: Niccolò Guidalotto’s Panorama of Constantinople\\" she concentrated on a seventeenth-century panorama of Constantinople, which is an exceptional visual representation of the city. This panorama is viewed as an elaborate piece of anti- Ottoman propaganda designed by the Venetian Franciscan friar Niccolò Guidalotto da Mondavio. Fifth Book Her fifth book is a collection of essays entitled \\"Predicatori, artisti e santi nella Toscana del Rinascimento\\" focusing on art and preaching in Tuscany during the Renaissance. She is also the editor of two books with Sally Cornelison and Peter Howard \\"Word, Deed & Image: Mendicant to the World\\" and with Katrin Kogman Appel and Ingrid Baumgarten \\"Maps and Travel: Knowledge, Imagination and Visual Culture\\", forthcoming.

History In as early as 1902, the British banned the production of \\"opium\\" in Uganda, noting that opium \\"includes... also the preparation known as bhang, ganja, churus, and chandoo natron\\". A 1902 British ethnological work noted that cannabis was used in Uganda, only by men, and particularly smoked in a water pipe. Young men of fighting age were not allowed to smoke cannabis. Cultivation Although cannabis is grown all across the country, the total cultivated area, based on the 1998 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, is less than . Locally known as bhang, it is believed to be the only drug grown in Uganda. Cultivation is most prevalent in eastern Uganda, especially in Bugiri, Busia, Iganga, Kayunga, Mayuge, and Mukono. Ugandan cannabis is mainly smuggled to neighbouring African countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan. Legality Although cannabis in Uganda is illegal, law enforcement is poor. The 2010 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report highlighted that there were only two detection dogs for conducting drug searches and no drug test kits or X-ray machines to detect drugs, along with the fact that the local police were both corrupt and inadequately trained. From 2008 to 2010, the government's Anti-Narcotics Unit (ANU) seized of cannabis and officially arrested some 482 people for possession of the drug. The ANU also reported that of cannabis plants were destroyed from 2008 to 2009. The export of cannabis for medicinal purposes was approved by the Ugandan Ministry of Health in January 2020, which stipulated among other things that all cannabis exporters had to have a minimum capital of 18.3 million Ugandan shillings or US$5 million. Prior to this, however, Industrial Hemp Uganda, a private company based in Hima, Kasese District, had already been exporting medicinal cannabis to Germany and China.

He narrowly avoided an assassination attempt by Julio Guillen, a disgruntled barber who threw a grenade on the speaker's platform. José Avelino, the Senate President, saw the bomb and gave it a kick. Castañeda then kicked it further down a set of steps as he covered the President with his own body. The grenade exploded near the audience, killing two people and injuring others. Guillen was arrested and executed via the electric chair on 26 April 1950. Castañeda was conferred the Medal of Valor as a consequence of his actions that night.

As First Lady, Atiyeh lobbied for House Bill 2139, a mandatory children's immunization bill, which was passed in 1981, and championed a proposed mandatory seat belt rule for children under 5-years-old. The mandatory seat belt rule for children, a controversial proposal in the 1980s, became law in 1983. Biography Atiyeh was born Dolores Hewitt, on November 8, 1923, in Portland, Oregon. She graduated from Washington High School in Portland, where she also met and began dating her future husband, Victor Atiyeh. Following high school, both Hewitt and Atiyeh enrolled at the University of Oregon, where Hewitt studied art at the university's honors college. However, neither graduated from the University of Oregon due to the outbreak of World War II. The couple married on July 5, 1944, and later had two children, Tom and Suzanne. Coinciding with her husband's career political career, Dolores Atiyeh developed her own charitable, social and volunteer work going back to the 1960s. She served as First Lady of Oregon from 1979 to 1987 during Governor Atiyeh's two terms in office. In addition to the more traditional roles as first lady, Atiyeh championed a range of policy issues related to health, safety, and the arts during her tenure. She helped to shepherd a mandatory children's immunization bill through Oregon legislature, which was signed into law in 1981. However, the first lady faced a tougher political fight over a proposed seat belt rule for children under 5-years-old during Governor Atiyeh's second term. The children's seat belt bill proved controversial, but ultimately passed in 1983 due to lobbying by First Lady Atiyeh. According to Denny Miles, Governor Atiyeh's former press secretary, the seat belt rule was \\"not a softball issue,\\" but Atiyeh fought for its passage, noting \\"It's kind of controversial, and she took the lead.\\" Governor Victor Atiyeh credited his success as a state a legislator and governor to Dolores Atiyeh. Atiyeh reportedly didn't always relish her role as a politician's wife, but she developed her own campaign style and often worked the room during a rally or fundraiser, a task that her husband did not always like to do. During the governor's 1982 re-election campaign, the first lady would put a sticker on the lapel or jacket of everyone the room whom she spoke with. She could then easily identify anyone in the room whom she might have missed by checking for the stickers. She chaired the Governor's Conference on Historic Preservation in 1981 and served as honorary chairperson of the Oregon Citizens for Immunization Inc. Closer to home, the Governor and First Lady lived in a rented home in Salem, Oregon, during their two terms. (Mahonia Hall, the official governor's residence, wasn't acquired until 1988, after they left office.) Atiyeh painted the home before moving into it. As the state's first lady, Dolores Atiyeh was expected to supply all of the serving ware, china, and utensils needed to host official state guests and functions, as these items were not provided by an official residence like other states. She later noted in a 1987 interview with The Oregonian, \\"It was my silver, my crystal, my dishes and my furniture.\\" There was also no paid, official speechwriter or housekeepers at their home, so Atiyeh performed those tasks as well, in addition to her other duties as first lady, \\"There was almost no help with the housework. I kept books, answered letters, made speeches...I liked it, but it was physically difficult to keep up the pace without help.\\" Former Governor Atiyeh died in 2014 shortly after their 70th wedding anniversary. Dolores Atiyeh died from complications related to old age two years later at a nursing facility in Portland on August 29, 2016, at the age of 92. She was survived by her two children, Tom and Suzanne, and five grandchildren. Dolores Atiyeh's papers and archives are housed at Pacific University as part of the Victor Atiyeh Collection.

It is located north of the Village of Cooperstown and is accessible via State Route 80. In the summer months it is also a public swimming beach and offers changing rooms, a picnic area, and a pavilion. In the winter months it serves as a place for ice fishers to park. History James Fenimore Cooper returned from Europe to live in Cooperstown in 1836. When he returned, he noticed that Three Mile Point which he owned was being used as public property, and that there had been extensive vandalism. In a magazine article that Cooper wrote in 1842, he said \\"The public cut down a tree that had a peculiar association connected with my father, and which I would not have permitted to be cut down for any ordinary reason.\\" James Fenimore Cooper had left Three Mile Point to all his descendants and when he died in 1851, it was left to William Cooper. William was angered by the vandalism, and in July 1837 placed an announcement in the Freeman's Journal. It said \\"the public is warned against trespassing on the three mile point... has not, nor has ever had, any right to the same, beyond what has been conceded by the liberality of the owners.\\" Few residents of the Village of Cooperstown viewed it as being owned by the Cooper family, and many were outraged. A public meeting was held to denounce James Fenimore Cooper for closing the point, said Judge Cooper had left it to the community, and requested Cooper's works be removed from the village library. The New York press used the story to denounce Cooper as an \\"aristocratic snob\\". Cooper's successful libel suits against these papers contributed to the development of New York libel law. Cooper included it in detail in his novel Home as Found, which describes the differences in social climates of New York City and Cooperstown as Cooper saw them. Three Mile Point remained in the Cooper family until it passed to William Storrs Cooper. In 1871 he leased it to the Village of Cooperstown. In 1899 a public appeal raised money to acquire the point for the village, and has since been a public park. In 1904 the northern edge was purchased by Adolphus Busch and he built a boathouse. In 1928 a proposal was made by the Busch family to acquire the remaining parts of the point, in exchange for property further up the lake. This was soon rejected by the Village of Cooperstown trustees. Appearance in literature In The Deerslayer, Three Mile Point is the location where Hetty Hutter docks to seek the Huron Indian camp which was further south at Muskrat Cove. She was going to the camp to plea for her father's release. Then later in the novel, it is the site of the second Huron camp where Chingachgook rescues Hist (Wah-ta-Wah) and Deerslayer, but Deerslayer is captured. As Cooper describes it: > The whole projection into the lake contained about two acres of land, and > the part that formed the point, and on which the camp was placed, did not > compose a surface of more than half that size. It was principally covered > with oaks.... Beneath, except the fringe of thick bushes along the shore, > there was very little underbrush.... The surface of the land was tolerably > even, but it had a small rise near its centre, which divided it into a > northern and southern half.... A brook also came brawling down the sides of > the adjacent hills, and found its way into the lake on the southern side of > the point. It had cut for itself a deep passage through some of the higher > portions of the ground, and, in later days, when this spot has become > subjected to the uses of civilization, by its windings and shaded banks, it > has become no mean accessory in contributing to the beauty of the place.... > There was a delicious spring on the northern side of the point.... (Chapter > 16) In Home as Found, Three Mile Point is referred to as Fishing Point. The Effingham family have the same controversy over the point that Cooper had in real life. The family discussed in chapter 14: \\"That point has been ours ever since civilized man has dwelt among these hills; who will presume to rob us of it?\\".

Jaehyeong started busking with Hajoon later in the year after the two met while practicing in the same studio, and the duo set out in search of another member. By the end of 2015, Jaehyeong recruited Dojoon, who had left his company and returned to busking. The trio started the indie band Windfall and began to write their own music, while posting musical covers on YouTube and performing in the streets. When the band decided to search for their fourth and final member, Dojoon worked to recruit Woosung, who he had met through a mutual friend. In 2016, the band entered J⋆ Company.  2017–2018: Mainstream debut, Paint it Rose Tour, Void and Dawn  On August 3, 2017, the band debuted its mainstream single, \\"Sorry\\", penned by Hajoon and under a new name, The Rose. Later that month, the Rolling Stone India lauded The Rose's single for being \\"a fantastic introduction to the band’s soft-rock vibe\\" and described \\"Woosung’s immense control over his raspy vocals... particularly impressive.\\" The group then made a subsequent comeback on October 31 with its second single, \\"Like We Used To.\\" On December 14, Billboard named The Rose's \\"Sorry\\" as one of the best Korean pop songs of 2017.

The article wrote that it is \\"rare for rock-leaning bands to make a major K-pop impression upon debut, but The Rose's gorgeously emotive \\"Sorry\\" was able to do that, scoring a spot on Billboard's year-end critics' song list and confirming themselves a multifaceted, new talent on the scene.\\" On January 24, Soompi announced The Rose as one of the nominees for Rookie of the Year for its 13th Annual Soompi Awards. On March 17, the band headlined the closing ceremony concert of the 29th Korean American Students Conference, hosted by Northwestern University in Chicago. On April 16, The Rose released their first mini-album entitled Void.

In their suit, the band alleged that the agency failed to provide any payment since their debut and that it demanded a rigorous promotional schedule. The Rose cited J⋆'s pledge to provide them with monthly revenue reports which never materialized, as well as the company's unilateral decision to plan a 17-city American tour spanning 32 days, which would have required a concert every other day. J⋆ Company denied the accusations and plan to \\"take all necessary legal measures\\". On March 4, J⋆ Company released a secondary statement that refuted The Rose's claims and accusations against the company, saying the group was being deceptive, and broke integrity and dignity. The label stressed their intent to take counter legal actions for violation of contract, defamation of character, and more. On July 6, Dojoon enlisted for his mandatory military service.

It was built in 1940, as one of sixteen pillboxes alongside the Stroudwater Navigation, a canal that links Stroud to the Severn Estuary. It has an octagonal floorplan based on the Type 24 pillbox, the ground floor being constructed of reinforced concrete and the upper storey is red brick. It is situated on the north side of the canal, across from the former Bond's Mill, which was being used during the war by Sperry as a dispersal factory to manufacture gyroscopic compasses. After the war it was adapted for use as a gatehouse for the mill and later to include hydraulic controls for the bridge that crosses the canal. In 1994 the original bridge was replaced with the world's first composite plastic lift bridge for vehicular traffic.

He is, together with Hugh Lygon, considered the main inspiration for Sebastian Flyte in Brideshead Revisited. Biography \\"Come and drink with me somewhere\\": photograph sent by Graham to Evelyn Waugh Alastair Hugh Graham was born on 27 June 1904 to Hugh Graham (1860-1921), of Barford House, Barford, Warwickshire, and Jessie, daughter of Andrew Low, of Savannah, Georgia. His father was the younger son of Sir Frederick Ulric Graham, 3rd Baronet (1820–1888), of the Graham Baronets of Netherby, and Lady Jane Hermione Seymour (1832–1909), daughter of Edward Seymour, 12th Duke of Somerset.Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 107th edition, vol. 2, ed. Charles Mosley, Burke's Peerage Ltd, 2003, p. 1624 Jessie Graham, a cotton heiress, would later appear as Lady Circumference in Decline and Fall and as Mrs. Kent-Cumberland in Winner Takes All both by Evelyn Waugh. Alastair Hugh Graham was educated at Wellington College, Berkshire, and Brasenose College, Oxford University,Mosley, Charles, editor. Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes. Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003 where he met Evelyn Waugh around Christmas 1923 or slightly before. At Oxford Graham was part of the Hypocrites' Club with Waugh. Graham sent Waugh a nude photo of himself near a waterfall, asking Waugh to \\"Come and drink with me somewhere\\". The Graham family's early 19th-century country house, Barford House, Barford, Warwickshire, between Warwick and Stratford-upon Avon, was where Alastair entertained Waugh as a guest. Graham was Waugh's closest friend from 1924 to 1929. In Brideshead Revisited, Waugh has Charles Ryder revisiting Brideshead Castle, and remembering \\"I had been there before, first with Sebastian more than twenty years ago on a cloudless day in June...\\". According to Philip Eade and others, Waugh is here remembering his own love affair with Graham, started at Barford House in 1923 when Graham was 19. In his memoirs, Waugh stated that Graham was the inspiration of Lord Sebastian Flyte even more than Hugh Lygon. In the manuscript of Brideshead Revisited, the name \\"Alastair\\" sometimes occurs instead of \\"Sebastian\\". In Waugh's autobiography, A Little Learning... an autobiography (1964), Graham appears under the name of Hamish Lennox, and Waugh said of him he was \\"the friend of my heart\\". Elizabeth Harmon (the future Lady Longford) in 1924 When Waugh left Oxford one term short of the degree requirements in August 1924, he went to live with Graham in a caravan in a field near Beckley, and from there they went on holiday to Ireland. It was after this trip that Graham converted to Roman Catholicism. When Graham went to visit his sister and her husband in Kenya in mid-September 1924, the friendship between Graham and Waugh took a step back, but in August 1926, Graham, his mother and Waugh went to Scotland; and on their return, Graham and Waugh went to France together with Richard Plunket Greene. Around this time, Graham, who owned a small printing press and was then apprenticed at the Shakespeare Head Press, printed Waugh's essay P.R.B.: An Essay on the Pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood 1847–54. Alastair Hugh Graham was an honorary attaché in Athens between 1927 and 1929, where Waugh visited him for the Christmas holidays. In Greece, Graham lived with another attaché, Mark Ogilvie-Grant. In 1929, both were transferred to Cairo with Vivian Cornelius until 1933. During World War II, Graham was attached to the US Navy. From 1933 he lived as a recluse on the Welsh Coast, at Plas-y-Wern Lodge, Gilfachrheda. Graham died in 1982.

He was judged guilty of making a Satanic pact, and was the last person executed for witchcraft in Denmark. Johan Pistorius was a soldier in the Danish army with the rank of grenadier. He was arrested and accused of the crime of making a pact with the Devil. He was not put on trial by the Danish authorities, but by a military court. He was judged guilty and sentenced to be executed by a military court martial. He confessed to the crime. He claimed to have been inspired to the pact after reading a book about Doctor Faust. The court faculty of Professors in Copenhagen recommended the king to confirm his sentence after they had interrogated him - which was unusual - and deemed that his regret was not sufficient, and that he should be executed as a public warning against the crime of Devil's Pact after having made a public confession of regret, which resulted in the public burning of the infamous pact at Nytorv square, followed by the execution of Pistorius the following day.Tyge Krogh, Louise Nyholm Kallestrup, Claus Bundgård Christensen, Cultural Histories of Crime in Denmark, 1500 to 2000 While Anne Palles is often called the last witch to be executed in Denmark, she was in fact only the last woman to be executed for witchcraft in Denmark, as Johan Pistorius was executed circa thirty years after her. There were death sentences for witchcraft in Denmark long after this. In 1733 a student, and in 1752 a farmer, were sentenced to life imprisonment with forced labor for Satanic pact, and as late as in 1803, two craftsmen received death sentences for the same crime, although none of the sentences were actually carried out. People were also lynched for witchcraft in Denmark long after the formal persecution stopped: the most known cases being that of Dorte Jensdatter, who was apprehended by the villagers who tied her up in her own home and burned it down after having accused her of causing death by magic, and the last lynching of witchcraft, in which Anna Klemens was lynched after having being pointed out for sorcery by a cunning woman in Brigsted at Horsens in 1800.

Distribution Neritina turrita is Indo-Pacific in distribution, with specimens recorded from locations including Madagascar, Papua New Guinea, the Pacific Islands, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Japan. Description Native to brackish tidal waters such as mangrove swamps, this snail is also classified as Vittina turrita, and is sold in the freshwater aquarium trade under the common name \\"tiger nerite\\" or \\"tiger snail.\\" Adults may thrive in fresh water with sufficient dissolved minerals. The species has separate male and female individuals; females lay eggs, which hatch into larvae that can survive only in brackish water. Adults grow to about 2.5 cm, and show a pale tan body with a darker tan shell, sometimes brownish or reddish, marked by black bands of varied width. The head has two short antennae which protrude from beneath the shell, each with a small eye at the base (generally invisible benath the shell). Nerites are slow-moving snails that travel over rocks or hard substrates and do not burrow. Like other members of its genus, the species grazes on algae which it rasps from surfaces with its radula. It may opportunistically feed on other debris, but does not pursue animal food. Because a variety of common names including \\"zebra nerite\\" can be used to refer to both species, it is sometimes confused with Neritina natalensis. { Apertural view of a shell of Neritina turrita. Scale bar is 10 mm. Abapertural view of a shell of Neritina turrita. Scale bar is 10 mm. Narrow banded form of Neritina turrita. } Human use Neritina turrita is common in the pet trade for freshwater aquaria. It is considered a desirable snail for home aquarists because of its attractive pattern, compatible requirements with common freshwater aquarium fish, and the fact that it consumes algae without eating plants or overpopulating in home freshwater tanks.

He became president of the International Space University in 2011. Early life and education Peeters was born in Antwerp on 28 June 1950. He completed primary school in Ekeren at the St.-Lambertusinstituut and afterwards at the Royal Atheneum in Antwerp. He obtained an engineering degree in nuclear engineering, a degree in Applied Economics at the Catholic University of Louvain, and an MBA with the thesis on 'Fleet Size Scheduling' (Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium, 1982). Later he obtained a doctorate in engineering at the Technical University of Delft with a doctoral thesis on \\"The appropriate use of contract types in development contracts.\\"The appropriate use of contract types in development contracts: A systems approach with emphasis on the European space sector Delft University of Technology. (Reprinted by ESA Publication Division, ESTEC, Noordwijk as ESA STR-222, ). 152 pages. Career Peeters worked as engineer in the construction sector and in the petrochemical sector, specializing in the field of project planning. In 1983, he joined the European Space Agency (ESA) and was involved in several control and project management functions. Initial assignments were related to the extension of test facilities at ESA’s technology center ESTEC in Noordwijk before joining the Hermes project in Toulouse. After several redesign phases the mass of the Hermes spacecraft continued to increase as well as the estimated cost-to- completion; at the end the ESA Member States decided to terminate the project. Upon creation of the European Astronaut Center (EAC) in Cologne, he became Head of the astronaut coordination office and acted in Star City, by Moscow, as coordinator of the astronaut operations during the EUROMIR missions in 1994 and 1995. As far as academic activities are concerned, after a sabbatical year he published the book ‘Space Marketing’ in 2000 and joined the International Space University (ISU) as Professor in space business and management. In 2004 he was named as dean of the university, which was highly noted in the Belgian press,Gazet Van Antwerpen, Studenten in Space, GVA (15 Nov. 2004) p. 20.Athena, Une famille mondiale : à l’heure spatiale, 215 (Nov. 2005), pp. 117-119.Trends, Ruimte-Belg, (15 Nov. 2007) pp. 100-103. and since 2011 elected as president.ISU Announces Newly Appointed President and Dean; 14 September 2011. Since October 2018 he has been nominated as President-Emeritus at ISU. Research activities are focused on the commercialization of space activities as well as the development of New Space activities. Specific attention is dedicated to the transition from experimental sub-orbital space tourism to commercial spaceflights, leading to a publication for the International Academy of Astronautics on sub-orbital space tourism. In 2009 he was elected as Founding Director of the International Institute of Space Commerce (IISC). Special interests include the role of space activities as a catalyst of international cooperation, as presented inter alia at Facing Tomorrow in Jerusalem. It also led him to propose in 2014 the International Space Station as a candidate for the Peace Noble Prize;SpaceNews 25(7) (2014), p. 19. however, the geopolitical context (situation in Ukraine) at that time were not beneficial for this proposal. Recent emphases of Peeters includes consulting of governments such as the Baltic States (from 2011 onwards), Luxembourg (2017), South-Australia (2017) and Oman as well as assisting young space entrepreneurs in business plan development and start-up activities.

Sophia's husband, Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick- Lüneburg, planned its replacement with a large baroque palace, and began construction with the \\"Galerie\\", but their son, elector George Louis, who in 1714 succeeded to the British throne as King George I, gave up the palace building project and concentrated on adding water features to the garden. The next king, George II, planned again for a new palace in better proportion with the \\"Großer Garten\\", but never realized it. His successor George III, who never visited Herrenhausen, had the palace modernised in neoclassical style by Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves. During World War II Herrenhausen Palace suffered immense damage in a British bombing raid on 18 October 1943. The ruins of the palace were almost completely torn down after the war; the outside staircase once leading up to the entrance was salvaged from the debris and moved next to the Orangerie building where it can be seen today. Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover sold his remaining property at Herrenhausen Gardens in 1961, but kept the nearby Princely House, a small palace built in 1720 by George I for his daughter Anna Louise. It is now his grandson Ernest Augustus's private home, along with Marienburg Castle. In 2009, the city of Hanover took the decision to rebuild the palace. The Volkswagen Foundation received the plot and sponsored the reconstruction. The palace was reopened on 18 January 2013Herrenhausen Palace and Museum in a ceremony attended by Their Royal Highnesses, Princess Beatrice of York and Princess Eugenie of York, as well as by Prince Ernst August of Hanover. The reconstructed baroque palace houses the Museum Schloss HerrenhausenMuseum Schloss Herrenhausen with a cafeteria and a bookshop, as well as exhibition and meeting spaces sponsored by the Volkswagen Foundation. Gardens The palace's extensive gardens extending beyond the original \\"Großer Garten\\" are an important example of baroque and later garden design and contain many significant period garden buildings. The gardens were reinstated following damage in World War II, and became a major leisure resource for the city of Hanover, with new additions including an aquarium. Births, deaths and burials King George II of Great Britain was born in Herrenhausen Palace in 1683. Three of his daughters were born there: * Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange * Princess Amelia of Great Britain * Princess Caroline of Great Britain Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick- Lüneburg, George II's grandfather, died in Herrenhausen Palace in 1698. After World War II the remains of King George I of Great Britain along with his parents' were removed from the chapel of Leineschloss in Hanover and reinterred in the 19th-century \\"Welfenmausoleum\\" of Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover, in the \\"Berggarten\\" at Herrenhausen.Helmut Knocke and Hugo Thielen (2007).

It was reported that the then Energy and Power Development Minister of Zimbabwe Samuel Undenge pressured the Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) to pay Chivayo's company called Intratek Zimbabwe $5 million despite the absence of a bank guarantee.  Background and career  In January 2018, Zimbabwe's Energy and Power Development Minister Simon Khaya-Moyo said the contract between the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority's subsidiary ZPC and Chivayo was discussed in Cabinet (government) and his predecessor, Minister Samuel Undenge, failed to give a convincing explanation on why ZPC proceeded to pay Chivayo when no progress had been made on the project site. On 22 January 2018 it was reported that ZPC actually paid Chivayo's company Intratek $7 million instead of the $5 million advance payment that was initially reported. Chivayo single handedly sponsored the Zimbabwe national football team but later withdrew that sponsorship. Chivayo was part of an audience that attended a meeting in South Africa held by current Zimbabwean president Emmerson Mnangagwa. President Emmerson Mnangagwa went to South Africa in December 2017, to address potential Zimbabwean investors based in that nation. Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa had plans to investigate Wicknell Chivayo over $1 billion worth of tender business from the Zimbabwean government. According to the Zimbabwean government's state broadcaster ZBC Chivayo was placed under oath by the Zimbabwean parliament and asked to explain how he used the money allocated to his company, Intratrek. It was also reported that Chivayo then disowned Intratrek while the company's CEO Yousouf Ahmed through his lawyer claimed he was not aware of how Chivayo had spent the money and distanced himself from the charge.  Controversy  Mchabezi, Gwanda, the town of the projects in question In 2017 the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) and the Zimbabwean Parliament probed Chivayo's electricity power contracts that included a USD$200 million dollar power contract for Gwanda, a small town in Zimbabwe and other power contracts that had an accumulated value in excess of USD$600 million of which none were ever delivered. In late January 2018, general secretary of the Energy Sector Workers' Union of Zimbabwe (ESWUZ), Gibson Mushunje, claimed that Chivayo was involved in power contracts reaching up to USD$684 million. In March 2018, Chivayo drew attention for buying shoes worth R20 000 South African rand and compared himself to Adolf Hitler for having so many shoes  Arrests  In 2004 Chivayo was charged with fraud involving ZAR 837 000 South African rand while other's believed the amount to exceed R2 000 000 South African rand and was incarcerated at Chikurubi Prison, a maximum security prison in Zimbabwe. In December 2017 Chivayo was arrested over a $5 million United States dollar ZESA contract. Zimbabwean politics Chivayo questioned Nelson Chamisa’s claim at a Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai rally that Zimbabwe will have bullet trains. Grace Mugabe, Zimbabwe's former first lady is believed to be associated with Chivayo. Energy Sector Workers Union of Zimbabwe accused the Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) of providing funds to Chivayo and Grace Mugabe. Chivayo apologised to former higher education minister Jonathan Moyo and offered to donate education material worth $50 000 to a Tsholotsho District school of his choice, a development that was likely viewed as support to the Generation 40 (G40) faction of Zanu PF.  Personal life  In 2017 Chivayo married Sonja Madzikanda and it was reported that a bride price of USD$50 000 was paid. Popular international artist Oliver Mtukudzi serenaded guests at Chivayo's wedding. In 2018 Chivayo made news for publishing his son's (John Chenjera- Chivayo) DNA test results to prove that the child was his son.

Elements of his career are sometimes confused with his identically named father Jacob Richards. His two younger brothers Michael Richards and John Richards were both noted artillery officers.Ostwald p. 113 Background Richards was born in Ireland, and partly grew up on the family's estates in County Wexford which had been granted to his grandfather Solomon Richards during the Cromwellian era. He had two brothers Michael Richards and John Richards who also pursued army careers. A sister, Elizabeth, married the politician James Craggs.Hugill p. 66 The family were Protestants, although John converted to Catholicism. Siege of Buda Having apparently been part of the Tangier Garrison, Richards joined the English ordnance during the 1680s. In order to improve his knowledge of artillery he was sent in 1685 to Vienna to serve with the Imperial forces then taking part in the Great Turkish War. As a staff officer to General Taffe, he saw action at the Siege of Buda in 1686.Manning p. 337 He returned to England and was sent to Hull to supervise the defence of the River Humber against potential foreign invasion. During the Glorious Revolution of 1688 he was part of James II's Army that assembled on Salisbury Plain, but switched his support to William of Orange.Manning p. 337 Ireland In 1689 Richards accompanied General Percy Kirke's expedition to relieve Derry which was then being besieged by the Jacobite Irish Army of James II. He served at the successful siege of Carrickfergus and was present at the Battle of the Boyne the following year. He served under Marlborough during the capture of Cork. In 1691 he fought at the Battle of Aughrim and took part in the final Siege of Limerick which ended the war in Ireland.Lee p. 213 Flanders In 1692 Allied troops were shifted from Ireland to Flanders to join the coalition forces fighting against Louis XIV. Jacob and his brother Michael served in the Allied artillery train at the hard-fought Battle of Steenkirk and then at the Battle of Landen the following year.Lee p. 213 Later career In 1695 he accompanied a British raiding expedition on the French coast which launched an attack on St. Malo. Following the Peace of Ryswick in 1697 he was appointed Third Engineer of Great Britain. The following year he was promoted to Colonel and the first peacetime ordnance unit was formed and placed under his command.Lee p. 213 However, he left to take up service in the Army of the Republic of Venice and served in Greece.

In: Grace's Guide. Retrieved on 30 December 2017 after free-of-charge log-in. The Addis's Single Rail Tramway was a patented monorail system invented in 1869 by William Judson Addis.  History  William Judson Addis from Thane (previously Tanna) in India invented, patented and developed a tramway with a single rail, on which a bullock cart ran with two double flanged wheels, which could take all, or nearly all, the weight, and two ordinary stabilising wheels, which served to prevent over-turning. A cart, loaded with three tons, could easily be drawn by two bullocks.Addis System Monorail auf Fibis. Addis was granted his first patent in 1869,UK Patent No 1850. Granted on 14 January 1869. and in 1870 a further patent was granted concerning improvements to the track system.UK Patent No 90. Granted on 12 January 1870. The investment cost for sleepers and rails was less than 50 % of an ordinary narrow gauge railway. The monorails were laid at the sides of an existing road, one for up traffic and the other for down traffic, leaving the centre part of the road for ordinary traffic. The rails protruded only 1½-2 inches (40-50 mm) above the surface of the road to limit the interferences with the ordinary road traffic. The cost of tramway was claimed ed to be Rs 4000-5000 per mile. For demonstrating the advantages, Mr. Addis has laid down a length of rail in the grounds of his ironworks at Thane, upon which he has placed two carts or wagons specially constructed by him for the tramway. A portion of the rail was laid at an incline of 1 in 40, and another portion, on level ground, described a 10 ft (3 m) radius curve. This experimental line has been visited by many government officials and others, who have seen with satisfaction the ease with which a pair of bullocks drew three tons along the tramway. The flanged centre wheels were attached to a screw, by which the framework of the cart could be raised, so that on level ground the ordinary side wheels were set to be 1-2 inch (25-50 mm) above the surface of the road, and the entire weight of the burden rested on the rail. The side wheels touched the ground only occasionally, but the main weight was borne by the centre wheels, resulting in very low friction. In some experiments, a large log of wood was placed on the ground, over which one of the side wheels would pass without derailing. When a small hole was dug in the line of a side wheel, this could also be passed without an accident. A line was laid between Kalyan and Kalyan Bunder over a distance of 1¼ mile (2 km) to transport salt. A 3½ miles (5,6 km) long double line was planned to be built between Mhyjee station of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR) and the Mhyjee fair ground, also known as Maheji or Chinchkhed.Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 17, p. 8.

Two restaurants located in the upper floors of the Trade Housing Building, 1 Above and Mojo's Pub, had been licensed by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai to use one-third of the rooftop space, with the remaining two- thirds to be reserved as an open area. Both restaurants constructed illegal temporary structures over the entire rooftop space, with canopies, to provide additional space for serving food and drinks. The restaurant 1 Above,was served notices by the Greater Mumbai Municipal Corporation of India on August 4, September 22 and October 27, 2017, for using the rooftop to serve drinks and food without permission. In August, some temporary construction on the rooftop by 1 Above was demolished by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, as it had been constructed illegally. In October, the MCGM found that the same space was still being used illegally, and confiscated furniture that had been placed on the rooftop. Both, Mojo's Pub and 1 Above had also been served notices for illegally serving hookahs, a device used to vaporise inhale flavoured substances such as cannabis, by heating them up with charcoal.  Fire   Initial Fire  The fire began at 00:22 IST on 29 December 2017, in a bar called 1 Above, which was located on the rooftop of the three-storey Trade House Building in the Kamala Mills Compound. The fire spread to a bamboo canopy constructed over the rooftop eating area, and spread from there to the adjacent Mojo's Pub, which was separated from 1 Above by a partition. Both, 1 Above and Mojo's Pub were located alone one arm of the L-shaped building; from these two places, the fire spread along the other arm, damaging the offices of five media offices also located on the rooftop. The entire upper part of the building was engulfed in fire in about 30 minutes. There were approximately 200 people inside the building when the fire began. Access to the roof top consisted of one narrow staircase which lead to an elevator. A door on the terrace remained locked through the incident. As the fire burned, the rooftop collapsed, and parts which were made of combustible materials caught fire. This caused difficulties for the persons trying to escape the fire, as well as limited access for fire fighters. Several people who were not able to exit the rooftop attempted to take shelter in a washroom located on the rooftop. The collapsed roof damaged the exits of the offices of a news channel, TV9 Marathi, which was located on the floor below 1 Above.  Fire Fighting Response  Emergency services were contacted about the fire at 12:30 IST. The Mumbai Fire Brigade responded to the fire, with eight fire tenders, and five water tankers, along with several ambulances. The fire was brought under control by 2:45 IST and was doused completely by 6:30 a.m. The Mumbai Fire Brigade initially classed the fire as Level II, but later upgraded their classification to Level III. Some people were able to escape to a nearby lobby, and were rescued by fire fighters using ladders to access the top of the lobby.  Impact   Deaths  The fire caused the deaths of fourteen persons, most of whom were at Mojo's Pub or 1 Above when it began. Thirteen were found dead on the scene of the fire, and one person died in the hospital of injuries relating to carbon monoxide inhalation. All fourteen were located by fire fighters, trapped inside washroom stalls, without any burn injuries, suggesting that the deaths were due to smoke inhalation. The injured and dead were taken to K.E.M. Hospital and Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital. Post-mortem reports confirmed that all fourteen deaths were the result of asphyxiation. A deputy fire officer of the Mumbai Fire Brigade confirmed, based on eye witness reports, that several of those who died had attempted to lock themselves into the washrooms on the rooftop to escape the fire.  Damage to Property  The fire affected transmission of many television channels as several media companies had their broadcasting office in the compound. Times Now, Mirror Now and ET Now resumed transmission while Movies Now, Movies Now HD, MNX HD, MN+ HD, MNX, Romedy Now, Romedy Now HD and Zoom channels were not transmitting due to major infrastructure losses.  Aftermath   Technical Investigation by the Mumbai Fire Brigade  A technical investigation was conducted by the Mumbai Fire Brigade, to establish the causes of the fire. The Mumbai Fire Brigade released its technical investigation report on 5 January 2018. The report examined evidence from the scene of the fire, as well as examining eyewitness accounts from survivors to establish the cause and spread of the fire. Initial reports suggested the fire broke out in a rooftop restobar, 1 Above, and rapidly spread to next door pub Mojo's Bistro, and may have been caused by a short circuit. Initial statements from the Mumbai Police also indicated that 1 Above did not have permission to function on the roof top, and had illegally constructed several structures there, including a toilet. The Mumbai Fire Brigade also made initial statements, confirmed that 1 Above and Mojo's Pub did not have a fire exits on the rooftop or fire fighting equipment, such as fire extinguishers. The technical investigation conducted by the Mumbai Fire Brigade indicated that the fire actually started at Mojo's Bistro, probably due to ‘flying embers’ from a hookah, which is a device used to inhale vaporised substances, using charcoal to heat the apparatus. The Mumbai Fire Brigade's report indicated that the fire spread from Mojo's Pub to the adjacent 1 Above, via flammable material including curtains, decorative flowers, and the bamboo canopies that had been illegally constructed on the roof. Mumbai Fire Brigade's deputy chief fire officer R. Chaudhary said both 1 Above and Mojo's Bistro did not have functioning emergency exits or working fire safety equipment. This was confirmed in the technical investigation report, which also found that the only emergency exit from the rooftop was locked, and had been further obstructed by stacks of beer kegs, which later exploded during the fire. The technical investigation report also found that neither 1 Above nor Mojo's Pub had been able to produce the licenses and permissions needed to provide hookahs, serve alcohol, or food, on the rooftop. The technical investigation report also noted that the managers did not alert emergency services when the fire began, and that the fire brigade was only called when a security guard in the building raised an alarm. The fixed fire extinguishing system in the building was not working and fire exits on lower flowers were obstructed by illegal construction and construction, causing persons to become trapped and limiting escape routes.  Departmental Investigation by the MCGM  On 29 December 2017, immediately after the incident, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis directed the MCGM to conduct an inquiry into the incident. Municipal Commissioner Ajoy Mehta had initially suspended five officials immediately after the incident, including assistant divisional fire officer Sandeep Shinde, designated officer Madhukar Shelar, junior engineer Dharmaraj Shinde, sub-engineer Dinesh Mahale, and medical health officer Satish Badgire. The Commissioner's detailed investigation report was filed with the state government of Maharashtra, and found 12 MCGM officials, including the 5 already suspended, to be guilty of misconduct. Two senior officials, the assistant municipal commissioner of G South Ward, Prashant Sapkale and his predecessor, Bhagyashree Kapse, were found guilty of failing to conduct adequate supervision over licensing and regulation. Three officers were nominated for dismissal, and others faced disciplinary action with the MCGM. The day after the fire, the MCGM also immediately suspended five officials and one officer of the Mumbai Fire Brigade, and transferred an Assistant Municipal Commissioner. The MCGM Commissioner, Ajoy Mehta, opened an investigation into the causes of the fire, and sent a preliminary report to the Maharashtra State Government on 29 December 2017, stating there was 'gross negligence' in maintaining safety regulations. In 2019, data obtained under the Right to Information Act 2005 revealed that the MCGM had failed to take disciplinary action against those identified by their internal investigation in the Kamala Mills fire. An additional investigative report submitted in 2020 by the MCGM indicated that 23% of the land developed for commercial use in the Kamala Mills compound had been done on a fraudulent basis, and that 11.93% of the development was in violation of fire safety norms.  Arrests and Suspensions  = Arrests = Immediately after the fire, the Mumbai Police filed an accidental death report. Preliminary reports from fire fighters indicated that 1 Above did not have any fire exits, and consequently, the Mumbai Police filed an investigation report against the three partners and manager of 1 Above. Kripesh Sanghavi, Jigar Sanghavi and Abhijeet Mankar, the who owned Sigrid Hospitalia, the parent company of 1 Above, were to be investigated for the offences of causing hurt by endangering lives, and culpable homicide not amounting to murder, under the Indian Penal Code. The two managers of 1 Above, Kevin Bawa and Gibson Lopez, were also arrested and detained in police custody. The owners of 1 Above initially fled, avoiding arrest, but were caught and detained by the Mumbai Police on 11 January 2018. Following an investigation by the Mumbai Fire Brigade, which found that the fire may have actually begun at Mojo's Pub, the owners of Mojo's Pub were also arrested. Yug Pathak, one of the owners, was arrested on 12 January 2018. Yug Tulli, the other owner of Mojo's Pub, initially evaded the police and was eventually arrested a year later after he surrendered to the Mumbai Police at N.M.Joshi Marg Station. = Suspensions =  Trial  As of July 2020, the trial in the case of the Kamala Mills Fire is still ongoing. In April 2018, a Sessions Court in Mumbai denied bail to seven persons accused in the case, including Ravind Patil, a Fire Officer responsible for certifying the two restaurants where the fire began; Yug Pathak(one of the owners of Mojo's Pub); Kripesh Sanghavi, Jigar Sanghavi and Abhijit Mankar (the owners of 1 Above) and Ramesh Govani and Ravi Bhandari (the owners of the Kamala Mills Compound). The two managers of 1 Above, Kevin Bawa and Lisbon Lopez, were released on bail. The other owner of Mojo's Pub, Yug Tulli, was arrested after evading the police for several months, and his bail application was also rejected. On 27 March 2018, Ravi Surajmal Bhandari, one of the owners of the Kamala Mills commercial complex, withdrew a challenge to his arrest and detention in police custody at the Supreme Court, in connection with the 2017 fire, preferring instead to apply for bail at the trial court. Bhandari and the other owner of the Kamala Mills complex, Ramesh Govani, were both granted bail by the Bombay High Court on 19 May 2018. On 15 December 2018, the Supreme Court of India released Kripesh and Jigar Sanghavi, the owners of 1 Above on bail, pointing out that while bail had been granted to them by the Bombay High Court, their release had been delayed because they had not been provided with copies of the bail order. In June 2018, Ravind Patil, the Fire Officer accused in the case, was granted bail, and in April 2019, the last remaining accused person in custody, Sayyid Ali, a waiter at 1 Above, was granted bail.  Public Interest Litigation and Judicial Inquiry  In 2018, Julio Ribeiro, a former police commissioner in the Mumbai Police, filed a Public Interest Litigation petition in the Mumbai High Court, asking the High Court to constitute a judicial inquiry into the causes of the Kamala Mills fire, including the licensing and regulation of the two restaurants where the fire broke out, by the MCGM. The Bombay High Court ordered the constitution of a three-member panel to conduct such an investigation, consisting of a retired judge, A V Savant, an architect, Vasant Thakur, and former municipal commissioner K Nalinakshan. On 12 September 2018, the three-member judicial panel filed their report with the Bombay High Court. The panel found that the owner of the Kamala Mills land had breached regulations by illegally constructing commercial spaces for lease, in violation of the permitted development of FSI. In addition to breaches by the owner of the land, the panel found that the two restaurants, 1 Above and Mojo's Pub, were functioning in violation of several building and fire safety norms established by the MCGM. The panel found the two restaurants had illegally converted the rooftop into a seating and dining area, and had further illegally stocked flammable materials there as well, including alcohol, kerosene, and coal. The panel recommended criminal action against the owner of the Kamala Mills premises as well as the owners of the two restaurants where the fire initially spread, and called for a departmental inquiry at the MCGM and the State Excise Department. The High Court Panel criticised the MCGM and State Government for granting permissions without adequate checks and balances under programs aimed at improving the ease of doing business in Maharashtra. The panel also recommended that the interior designers and architects responsible for the rooftop constructions at 1 Above and Mojo's Pub should be investigated for professional misconduct and inadequate qualifications, finding that one of the architects for 1 Above, Sumesh Menon, had failed to meet minimum training requirements.  Fire Safety  After the Kamala Mills Fire, the Mumbai Fire Brigade launched a special safety drive to review compliance with fire safety norms at restaurants and bars in the city, and ordered 87 establishments to be shut down for failure to comply with regulations. The Kamala Mills fire incident led to other cities in India revisiting fire safety regulations and compliance to prevent similar incidents. Immediately after the incident, the Government of Delhi asked the Delhi Fire Service to inspect restaurants and bars for compliance with safety regulations, citing the Kamala Mills fire as a reason. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation also conducted a review of rooftop bars and restaurants and demolished unauthorised constructions.

He showed by far his best form a juvenile in 1990 when he won two of his three races including the Washington Singer Stakes and the National Stakes before his career was interrupted by a serious leg injury. He failed to win again for two years before taking two minor races in the autumn of 1992. He later stood as a breeding stallion in Australia with limited success. Background Heart of Darkness was a brown horse bred in England by his owner Paul Mellon. Like many of Mellon's European runners, he was trained throughout his racing career by Ian Balding at Kingsclere in Hampshire. He was one of the best flat horses sired by Mellon's stallion Glint of Gold who won six Group 1 races as well as finishing second in the Epsom Derby. Heart of Darkness was the first foal of his dam Land of Ivory, a successful racemare who won three races and was placed in both the Lupe Stakes and the Prix Cléopâtre. As a granddaughter of the American broodmare Natashka (foaled 1963), she was closely related to Margarula, Questing, Elusive Quality and Dark Lomond. Racing career 1990: two-year-old season Heart of Darkness began his career in a maiden race over six furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse on 4 August in which he started at odds of 9/1 and finished fourth of the eight runners, six and a quarter lengths behind the winner Majlood. Thirteen days later he was stepped up in class and distance for the Listed Washington Singer Stakes over seven furlongs at Newbury in which he was ridden, as on his debut by Steve Cauthen. Starting the 11/2 outsider of the four runners, he raced at the rear of the field before accelerating into the lead inside the final furlong and winning by one and a half lengths from the Barry Hills-trained Caerdydd. The Irish jockey Pat Shanahan took the ride when the colt was sent to Ireland to contest the Group 1 National Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 8 September. He was made the 7/4 favourite ahead of Malvernico, a Jim Bolger-trained colt who had won both the Curragh Stakes and the Anglesey Stakes. The other six runners included Caerdydd, Poets Dream (from the Vincent O'Brien stable), Prodigal Blues (third in the Chesham Stakes) and Smooth Performance (runner-up in the Orby Stakes). Heart of Darkness tracked the leaders as Malvernico set the pace, but began to make progress inside the last quarter mile. He caught the Bolger colt in the final strides and won by a head, with Prodigal Blues a length away in third place. Heart of Darkness was being prepared for a run in the Dewhurst Stakes when he fractured a cannon bone in a training gallop. 1991: three-year-old season Heart of Darkness was off the racecourse for over a year before returning for four races in the late autumn of 1991. He finished second in a minor event at Newwbury and then came home sixth in the Listed Main Reef Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse, fading in the closing stages after leading for most of the way. He went on to run second to Susurration in the Darley Stakes and ended his campaign by finishing runner-up to Mohican Girlwhen favourite for the James Seymour Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket on 1 November. 1992: four-year-old season In 1992 Heart of Darkness was mainly campaigned in handicap races but had little success for most of the year and finished unplaced in his first eight races. He eventually returned to winning form at Warwick Racecourse on 5 October, taking the seven furlong Queen Bess Stakes \\"comfortably\\" by three lengths from the three-year-old Talb. Seventeen day later he followed up by winning a one-mile handicap at Newbury under a weight of 140 pounds. As in his victory at Warwick he was ridden by Ray Cochrane and wore a visor. On his last two starts Heart of Darkness ran third in a handicap at Newmarket and then came home eighth of the twelve runners in the Group 3 Prix Perth at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 8 November. Stud record At the end of his racing career Heart of Darkness was retired to become a breeding stallion in Australia where he sired several minor winners but no top-class performers. He reportedly died at Gundaroo on 25 May 2011 at the age of twenty-three.

Today the ruins are a cultural monumentLandesamt für Vermessung und Geobasisinformation Rheinland-Pfalz: Kaiserslautern-Nord -  History  Not much is known about the origins of the castle. It was probably built by Rudolph of Habsburg between 1275 and 1324 in connexion with the founding of the town of Wolfstein, as part of the town's defences. It is first recorded in 1324 as Hus zu Wolvenstein.Magnus Backes: Staatliche Burgen, Schlösser und Altertümer in Rheinland-Pfalz - In 1503, during the War of the Succession of Landshut, the castle was badly damaged. In 1609 it was demolished and rebuilt. In 1688 it was destroyed by the French and rebuilt yet again in order to serve as a barracks for French soldiers. This was in turn partly destroyed by cannon fire in 1713 on the orders of Marshal Villar and the Kingdom of Bavaria then used the ruins as a quarry. From 1720 to 1771, St. George's Chapel at the castle was used by the borough of Wolfstein as a church. In 1792 the site was recorded as being in a poor state. Two years later French soldiers used the castle as a chapel and medical post. Until 1798 the building was still used as a vicarage. After that the castle was left to fall into ruins.Manfred Czerwinski: Burgen - stolze Zeugen einer großen Zeit -  Present use  The ruins are used today as a war memorial. Since 1963, they have belonged to the state of Rhineland-Palatinate.  Description  Of the old castle, the remains of the neck ditch, the 1.2-metre-thick enceinte, the shield wall, the castle gate and the foundations of the palas have survived.  Legend  According to legend there was a deep well at New Wolfstein that has long since been filled in. French cavalry are supposed to have fallen into it one after another when they left their route at night. Reportedly, 30 troopers met their death.Viktor Carl: Pfälzer Sagen und Legenden -  Literature and sources   External links  * Burg Neu- Wolfstein at burgenwelt.de Category:Heritage sites in Rhineland-Palatinate Category:Castles in Rhineland-Palatinate Category:Electoral Palatinate Category:Kusel (district) ","title":"New Wolfstein Castle"},{"id":"56171983","text":"Cyber Group Studios is a Paris-based developer, producer and distributor of animated television series and movies for children in France and internationally.

Adams in San Antonio Heights after the inauguration of the electric tram had made them obsolete. Ranch work was apparently far below their dignity and when hitched to a harrow, they persistently refused to budge, and coaxing and force were equally without effect. The farmer had to motivate them by attaching a bell from the old rail car to his harrow.

It was built in 1938 to the designs of local architects Stonham & Sons and Fenning. The church hall is a good example of the architecture of the period. St E's, as it is affectionately referred to, is an Anglican church within the Diocese of Chichester. The original derelict church building, which is set for demolition in 2019 and 2020, once contained chancel paintings by the art historian and conservator, Ernest William Tristram (1882-1952). Now housed in the new domed church building next door, the Tristram Panels depict the life of John the Baptist and his parents, the priest Zacharias and his wife Elizabeth. (Tristram also painted a limited number of original works, including the panels at St Elisabeth's and paintings at York Minster and St Fin Barre's Cathedral in Cork City). In addition, St Elisabeth's crypt contained a series of large wall paintings by the artist Hans Feibusch (1898-1998). Through this work he came to the attention of Charles Herbert Reilly, professor of architecture, and George Bell who provided Feinbusch with the opportunity to create a mural of his own design at St Elisabeth's in 1944. Feibusch chose the allegory of Pilgrim's Progress as a vehicle for his own story as a refugee fleeing Nazi Germany and his eventual acceptance in 1940s Britain. Feibusch enlisted the help of local people to complete the mural, which is now a registered War Memorial dedicated to civilian casualties of war. thumb Gallery File:Christmas at St E's.jpgChristmas File:Worship space at St E's.jpgWorship space File:Under the Dome at St E's.jpgThe dome File:Christingle at St E's.jpgChristingle File:St E's Main Hall.jpgMain hall See also *List of places of worship in Eastbourne *Listed buildings in Eastbourne References External links * * Summary of the church at Sussex Parish Churches website Category:1935 establishments in England Category:Churches completed in 1938 Category:Church of England church buildings in East Sussex Category:Grade II listed churches in East Sussex Category:Churches in Eastbourne ","title":"St Elisabeth's Church, Eastbourne"},{"id":"56172181","text":"Roman Moravec (30 December 1950 - 2 November 2009) was a Slovak athlete.

As a castle the site was first mentioned in a document as early as 1390.  History  From 1602 to 1618, a castle (the so-called \\"old castle\\" or Alte Schloss) was built outside the actual town walls by the counts of Nassau-Weilburg, who had their permanent residence at Schloss Weilburg in Weilburg on the Lahn. A new building was erected between 1738 and 1740 under Prince Charles Augustus of Nassau-Weilburg. Charles Augustus was an imperial prince and wanted a modern building. Guillaume d'Hauberat was engaged as architect and master builder; he also built Mannheim and Schwetzingen Palaces for the Elector of the Palatinate. A schlossgarten was to be laid out in a terraced design at the new schloss, the irrigation of which was to be taken from the copper pits of the nearby village of Haide. Some of these water channels have survived to this day. After the occupation of nearby Mainz by the French, Prince Frederick William of Nassau-Weilburg fled in 1793 from Kirchheimbolanden to Bayreuth. This ended the castle's function as a princely residence, and thus also the reign of the princes of Nassau-Weilburg over this region. In 1807, the castle and gardens were declared as French national property and could thus be sold. The site was auctioned in Mainz in 1807, as Mainz was now the administrative seat of the Department of Mont-Tonnerre. It was purchased by landowner and textile manufacturer, Daniel Andreas, from Mülheim an der Ruhr. He had the central structure and the left wing of the palace demolished and moved his private apartment into the remaining right wing of the palace. After the end of French rule, Mont-Tonnerre fell to the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1816. The region was initially referred to as the Circle of the Rhine (Rheinkreis) and, later, as Rhenish Palatinate (Rheinpfalz). Entrance to the castle park On 21 March 1839, Schloss Kirchheimbolanden was sold to Bavarian master builder, Leo von Klenze from Munich. He had extensive structural changes made, but did not take up permanent residence at the castle. In 1841, he sold the property to pensioner, Heinrich Seligmann from Mainz, who, in 1844, sold it to farmer, Friedrich Brunck, from nearby Winterborn/Alsenz. In 1848/49, the Palatinate Freischärler declared the castle to be their headquarters, but they were soon driven out by Prussian troops. On 3 November 1861, the east wing of the castle burnt down. Friedrich Brunck had it rebuilt in a simplified form with two floors and a hipped roof. In 2003, the old U-shape of the castle was rebuilt as Schloss Kirchheimbolanden Old People's Home (Seniorenresidenz Schloss Kirchheimbolanden), only the east wing being structurally reminiscent of its former form and splendour. But in this way the general shape of the old castle has been recreated as a three-winged complex. Frankfurt garden designer, Heinrich Siesmayer, was commissioned by Dr. Heinrich Ritter von Brunck to design the palace garden. Siesmayer had been commissioned by the grandson (Duke Adolph of Nassau) of the last prince residing in Kirchheimbolanden, who then fled, with the sale of his extensive collection of plants and trees from Schloss Biebrich near Wiesbaden, because the Prussians annexed his Duchy of Nassau in 1866.

P. Mda was a South African teacher, lawyer, political activist and co founder of the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL). He was also one of the founders of the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania. Personal life Peter Mda was born the 6 April 1916 in the Herschel District of the Eastern Cape. He was given the name “Ashby” as he was born on Ash Wednesday. He took the name “Peter” after joining the Catholic church.S. Dubow, A. Jeeves. South Africa’s 1940’s: World’s of Possibilities. Juta and Company, 2005 His mother, Mildred Mei, worked as a school teacher and his father, Gxumekelani Charles Mda, was a peasant farmer, headman and local shoemaker. Education Mda's parents were members of the Anglican church, however, A.P. Mda and his siblings attended the local Catholic school. Mda later attended other Catholic schools. namely St Francis School in Aliwal North and Mariazell School north of Matatiele. Mda pursued a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of South Africa (UNISA). Mda also studied law through correspondence courses and eventually graduated with a law degree.http://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/interview-with-ashby- peter-solomzi-mda Accessed 13 December 2017 Career After qualifying as a teacher, Mda was unable to secure employment in the Eastern Cape. He then found work as a gardener and cook in East London. He moved to Witwatersrand in an attempt to secure a teaching job teaching but remained unsuccessful. He continued to work in Witwatersrand as a gardener, cook and then a steel foundry. He eventually found a teaching post at Germiston Catholic Primary. He also worked at St John Berchman, a primary school in Orlando, Soweto from 1938. He continued to study through correspondence as to eventually become a lawyer. Political career A. P. Mda began his political career at the All African Convention (AAC) meeting in Bloemfontein in 1936. He attended the meeting to cover the proceedings for Umlindi we Nyanga, an East London newspaper. A. P. Mda defended the AAC leader, D. D. T. Jabavu, who was suspected of betraying their mandate and having dealings with J. B. M. Hertzog with regards to the Hertzog Bill of 1936. As support for the AAC dwindled, Mda began advocating for African Nationalism which, according to Mda, had excluded non-African groups. Mda then became a supporter of Dr A. B. Xuma and the African National Congress (ANC). Mda participated in the African Teachers Campaign advocating for higher wages in 1940 which was led by the Transvaal African Teachers Association (TATA). Mda was the chair of the Pimville branch of the Salary Campaign Committee at the next TATA gathering at the Wilberforce institute. Other members of the committee included David Bopane, Edward Manyosi, M. Maubela, M. Kekana, Sydney Maseko and E.S. Molepo. He was also part of the Catholic African Teachers Union (CATU) which was against the wage campaign. Mda later played a pivotal role in the formation of the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL). Mda formed a strong intellectual and political relationship with Anton Lembede soon after Lembede arrived in Johannesburg. Mda, Lembede and Jordan Ngubane, assistant editor of the “Bantu World”, were mandated to draw up the manifesto of the ANCYL. Lembede died suddenly on 29 July 1947. Shortly thereafter, Mda was named the acting president of the ANCYL and was formally elected into the position in 1948. Mda set up a working committee consisting of Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and Oliver Tambo to manage the activities of the ANCYL. Mda selected Fort Hare to expand their influence as the institution had a strong Black student community. The ANCYL also established branches in Natal and the Cape Province. The Fort Hare branch was officially launched in November 1948. The ANCYL, under Mda's leadership, started the Programme of Action (PA) at the ANC's Cape provincial office in Port Elizabeth in June 1949. The ANCYL adopted the PA. Xuma's term at the helm of the ANC was coming to an end and Mda and other members of the ANCYL started seeking a replacement who would endorse the PA at the following national ANC conference in 1949. Oliver Tambo went to James Moroka's home in Bantu location to encourage him to stand as a presidential candidate. Moroka was elected as president and the PA was adopted in 1949 as the ANC's guiding document. Mda then stepped down from the ANCYL after Moroka's appointment. He continued to work behind the scenes to ensure that the ANC remained committed to its nationalist ideals. Mda later grew weary of Moroka's leadership and wrote public letters of disapproval condemning the ANC leadership in the publication “Bantu World”. Mda noticed a “watering down” of African Nationalism by Oliver Tambo, Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu as the new leadership started forming multi-racial alliances including Coloured, Indian and White anti-Apartheid organisations. Political philosophy Mda was often quoted as supporting a form of African Nationalism which should not be used to justify segregation and separate development. Mda was against the Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA) which was possibly due to his Catholic upbringing. He believed that the CPSA planned to infiltrate and take over the ANC. Mda is also described as the “founding spirit\\" of the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) which broke away from the ANC in 1959. This group included John Nyathi Pokela, Potlako Leballo and Robert Sobukwe.https://www.britannica.com/biography/Potlako-Leballo Accessed 15 December 207 Mda also developed the motto “Serve, Sacrifice and Suffering.” http://www.economist.com/node/21542371 Accessed 15 December 2017 In the early 1990s, Mda, along with the rest of the PAC, was reluctant to join the Convention for the Establishment of Democracy in South Africa, known as CODESA.A.A.

A.P. migrated with his family entire family to Lesotho when he was sent into exile. Mda charged his clients very little for his services throughout his career. His family suffered due to this. They later lived in a township in a house with a rusty corrugated roof, no ceiling and no electricity. Mda died on the 7 August 1993 due to heart failure.

He was a partial owner of the Editorial Research Reports, and a book reviewer for The New York Times Magazine. His 1921 book, The Larger Socialism, was a critique of socialism in the United States. Early life Bertram Benedict was born circa 1892 in Baltimore, Maryland. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1912. Career Benedict began his career as a social worker in Pittsburgh and Syracuse. In 1917, he was hired by the Bureau of National Literature, and authored several books, including The Larger Socialism, published in 1921. In the book, Benedict, who was a member of the Socialist Party of America, considers whether socialism is more Christian than capitalism, and criticizes the over-reliance of Marxian theory, especially its focus on social classes, in the American context. Benedict contended that socialism failed to appear attractive to most Americans because most socialists were born outside the United States and failed to adapt its tenets to the reality of rural America, whose economy was primarily agricultural, not industrial. He added that most Americans were \\"unable or unwilling to think in abstract terms\\"; instead, he believed Americans would need a charismatic socialist leader to find it attractive. In the American Journal of Sociology, Victor E. Helleberg wrote that the book was \\"an attempt to reconstruct the strategy of socialist campaigning by broadening the outlook and considering carefully the situation in the United States.\\" Reviewing it for the Journal of Political Economy, Paul Douglas called it \\"an extraordinary clear and candid book.\\" Benedict first worked for the Editorial Research Reports in 1929. He acquired a stake in 1944, and left the company in 1959. He reviewed books for The New York Times Magazine. Personal life and death Benedict married Ruth Sarles Benedict.

Background Enos Frederick Woltman was born in York, Pennsylvania on March 16, 1905. Career Until 1929, Woltman taught Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh, when the Pennsylvania Governor Gifford Pinchot had him fired for an article he had written in the American Mercury about police brutality during a coal strike. Roy Howard of the New York World-Telegram hired him because of it. After World War Two, Woltman received assistance from Victor Laskyon articles about Communist Party infiltration within the USA. In 1946, Woltman beat out other newspaper investigators into the accusation of Louis F. Budenz that a high- level communist spy was working in the United States and discovered that person was Gerhart Eisler. U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy chats with Roy Cohn (right) at the Army-McCarthy hearings (1954) Frederick Woltman, a reporter with a long-standing reputation as a staunch anti-communist, wrote a five-part series of articles criticizing McCarthy in the New York World-Telegram. He stated that McCarthy \\"has become a major liability to the cause of anti- communism\\", and accused him of \\"wild twisting of facts and near facts [that] repels authorities in the field\\". TIME magazine described Woltman as follows: > Long acknowledged the No. 1 newspaper specialist on Reds, he has been > exposing Communists since 1938, and, unlike many other anti-Communist > writers, he was never a Communist himself. A hard-digging reporter, he > backed his stories with solid documentation—e.g., he exposed Gerhart Eisler > as the top Kremlin agent in the U.S. the day before the FBI picked Eisler > up.... This week the World-Telly and other Scripps-Howard papers splashed > Woltman's five-part series across their pages. His appraisal: McCarthy is \\"a > major liability to the cause of anti-Communism.\\" By making it harder for > real Communist-fighters to operate effectively, wrote Woltman, McCarthy has > actually become an asset to Communism. \\"He has introduced a slambang, > rabble-rousing, hit-and-run technique into the serious business of exposing > the Communist conspiracy... and thereby disarranged... The story was so controversial that it stirred up coverage itself, including again by TIME: \\"In their series on Joe McCarthy, the Scripps-Howard papers... stirred up an even bigger furor than they had expected\\" Later life and death In late April 1957, Woltman suffered a stroke that left him with aphasia. A longtime circus fan, Woltman retired in Sarasota, Florida in 1959 because it was the winter quarters of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. He later died of a heart attack on March 6th, 1970.

Other sources give her birthdate as c. 1882 and 1890.  Biography  Born in Plainfield, New Jersey, Adams studied at the Art Students League of New York, where her instructors included John Henry Twachtman and Frank Vincent DuMond. She is known to have exhibited work with artists from the Cos Cob colony in 1912 and 1913, but little else is known about her time in Old Lyme, Connecticut, save for an incident when her bedroom in the Griswold House was mistakenly entered one night by a misdirected male artist. She traveled extensively in her youth, visiting many parts of Europe and Japan; in the 1930s she lived in Buenos Aires. Somewhere around 1916 she married Benjamin Pettengill Adams, with whom she moved to New York; she thereafter began exhibiting work under her married name. During the 1920s her work appeared in shows at three New York galleries. By the late 1920s, she and her husband had moved to Sneden's Landing in New York's Palisades. There she designed their house, which won first prize in a House Beautiful contest for \\"the best small house East of the Mississippi\\". She later moved to Washington, D.C.. During her career she exhibited work at the Art Institute of Chicago, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Albright Art Gallery, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Corcoran Gallery of Art; her art appeared in exhibits at the National Academy of Design, the Society of Independent Artists, and the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors, receiving the Marcia Tucker Prize from the last-named organization in 1935 and an honorable mention in 1936. Two of her paintings were submitted to the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in 1915. Adams also lived for a time in Fairfield, Connecticut. She died in Alexandria, Virginia. Works As a painter, Adams favored landscape subjects, which she tended to depict in a more abstract fashion described as reminiscent of her teacher Twachtman. Her 1934 oil on canvas Man and Beast is currently in the collection of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. She has been posited as the subject of a 1906 painting by Childe Hassam, The Victorian Chair.

It is the only species in the genus Hutchinsoniella and was first described in 1955 by Howard L. Sanders, having been discovered in Long Island Sound; they were the first example of a new class of crustacean that was given the name Cephalocarida. Description Adult cephalocaridans are between in length. The body is divided into a cephalon, a segmented thorax and a segmented abdomen, with a cephalic shield covering the cephalon. There are no eyes and the body is flexible and translucent. The thorax has a pair of limbs on each segment while the abdomen is limbless, apart from the telson with its slender caudal filaments. The body and limbs are ornamented with various setae and spines. Ecology H. macracantha feeds on flocculent detritus, organic particles which have settled on the seabed in hollows and other places with little water movement. These particles are wafted by means of the thoracic limbs into a ventral groove which leads to the mouth. Development is direct in this species, there being at least eighteen instar stages, but no pelagic stage, so dispersal is limited. After each moult in the early stages, two additional body segments are added. Initially the larva has two pairs of antennae and a pair of mandibles with palps. The palps are lost by instar 10, and the maxillae and thoracic limbs have developed over a number of moults by this stage, while the second antennae and mandible gradually become rudimentary. When the larva has gained a full complement of limbs it can be considered to be adult. In Long Island Sound, breeding takes place from June to the end of September, during which time three broods, each of two embryos is produced.

According to the Confraternity of St James, the Camino Primitivo is approximately 370 km (230 miles) in length. Middle Ages The Camino Primitivo is thought of as the \\"Original Way\\" because it is reportedly the path taken by the first reported pilgrim, Alfonso II of Asturias (842), nicknamed the Chaste (). The King left his capital, Oviedo, in the year 814 to travel to the present location of the city of Santiago de Compostela, at the time known as Mount Libredón. Alfonso built the original shrine to Saint James on the spot of the discovery.Gitlitz & Davidson, The Pilgrimage Road to Santiago: The Complete Cultural Handbook, 2000, St Martin's Press, Until the city of León was established as both the capital of the Kingdom of Leon and the nexus of a safe route — the French Way — for pilgrims travelling across the Meseta, the Camino Primitivo remained the most frequented route for those going to Santiago for religious reasons. Modern revival The Camino Primitivo remains as a popular alternative path, which avoids most of the much heavier-travelled Camino Francés and the crowds of pilgrims there. Though incorporating significant vertical components, it allows hikers to enjoy a more stimulating journey with better views. The route has been growing rapidly in popularity in recent years, with corresponding improvements to waymarking and to the provision of hostel accommodation for pilgrims (the so-called albergues). In 2016, 12,089 pilgrims, representing 4.35% of the total completing the Camino de Santiago in that year, walked the Camino Primitivo. Most commenced their journey at Oviedo, with smaller numbers joining the trail at Lugo and at Grandas de Salime. The Primitivo is now the fourth most popular Camino route, behind the Francés, Portugués Central, and Norte.

The type species of Avicranium is Avicranium renestoi. \\"Avicranium\\" is Latin for \\"bird cranium\\", in reference to its unusual bird-like skull, while \\"renestoi\\" references Silvio Renesto, a paleontologist known for studies of Italian drepanosaurs.AMNH FARB 30834, mostly obscured by rock.  Discovery  The holotype and only known specimen of Avicranium is AMNH FARB 30834, a disarticulated skull attached to a few cervical (neck) vertebrae. This specimen hails from the Coelophysis (or Whitaker) quarry at Ghost Ranch in New Mexico, USA. This quarry belongs to the 'siltstone member' of the Chinle formation, which corresponds to the late Norian to early Rhaetian stages of the Triassic. Various unprepared blocks from this locality were excavated by American Museum of Natural History field parties during the 1940s. Long believed to only contain multiple specimens of the early dinosaur Coelophysis, these blocks are now known to contain a multitude of different Triassic reptiles. AMNH FARB 30834 was uncovered during the preparation of a block containing the holotype of Effigia okeeffeae, a large shuvosaurid pseudosuchian. Multiple other drepanosaur vertebrae and limb fragments have also been found in the block, although it is unclear whether they belong to the same specimen as AMNH FARB 308344. Despite AMNH FARB 30834 being disarticulated and partially covered by the rock matrix, many of its bones are well-preserved and the specimen as a whole was micro-CT scanned, revealing elements hidden under rock. This scan allowed the skull to be reconstructed in 3D using digital software. An endocast of the brain was also digitally constructed from the skull. Avicranium has the most well-preserved skull material of any drepanosaur.  Description  The micro-CT scan of AMNH FARB 30834 AMNH FARB 30834 can be recognized as a drepanosaur due to several traits of its vertebrae. The articular surfaces of its vertebral centres are heterocoelous (saddle-shaped). The neural spines are anteroposteriorly short and strongly anterodorsally inclined. These features closely resemble those of Drepanosaurus. A drawing of the skull reconstruction of Avicranium. However, the most notable feature of AMNH FARB 30834 is its skull, which shares many similarities with the skulls of modern birds. The snout is slender and tapering, similar to that of Megalancosaurus, although it differs from Megalancosaurus by being completely toothless. The frontal, postfrontal, and postorbital bones (above and behind the eyes) project outwards, forcing the orbits to face forwards. The frontal and parietal bones are both broad and thick, creating a high and domed cranium. According to the digital endocast of the specimen, this domed cranium held an enlarged brain with large optic lobes. On the other hand, the skull also possesses many primitive features. The squamosal is tall and anteroposteriorly broad, and possesses bony plates which frame the quadrate from the side and rear. This is similar to the condition in captorhinids and Araeoscelis, but unlike that of neodiapsids, which only have the quadrate framed from the side. The quadrate itself is also stouter than that of neodiapsids and lacks a concave rear edge and a dorsal extension which articulates with the squamosal. The occipital condyle of the braincase possesses a deep pit, while the foramen ovale is very large. The stapes is massive, similar to the condition in other early reptiles. Combined with a straight quadrate without a tympanic crest, this indicates that Avicranium (and presumably other drepanosaurs) lacked a tympanic membrane (eardrum), and that the drepanosauromorph lineage evolved before more advanced diapsids (such as saurians) acquired tympanic membranes. Avicranium can be distinguished from Hypuronector, Megalancosaurus, and Vallesaurus (the only other drepanosaurs with preserved skulls) due to the following features: * The complete absence of teeth. * A tall and triangular retroarticular process. * Cervical neural spines which are approximately as wide as they are long.  Paleobiology  The binocular eyes and enlarged brain of Avicranium are likely adaptations to an arboreal lifestyle, as such a lifestyle requires advanced sensory processing, such as depth perception and three-dimensional navigation. It is very likely that these features convergently evolved with those of pterosaurs and modern birds, which would require similar sensory processing during flight. An arboreal lifestyle has been previously proposed for other members of the drepanosauromorph lineage.

Recreational tourism activities come second with a navigable water body of across Lichen Lake (Opawica River), plus an extension of with Lake Wachigabau. The Wachigabau Lake is partly formed by an enlargement of the Opawica River because of the dam at its mouth. This lake is integrated with Lichen Lake (Opawica River) located on the south side. The northwestern portion of the Wachigabau Lake watershed is accessible through the forest road route 113 passing north-west of Opawica Lake and connecting Chibougamau to Lebel-sur- Quévillon. The north side of the lake is accessible via the Canadian National Railway which passes over a strip of land between Lakes Opawica and Wachigabau. The surface of Wachigabau Lake is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid- November to mid-April.  Geography  Formed by an enlargement of the Opawica River, this lake has a length of shaped irregular crescent, a width maximum of and an altitude of . The shape of the lake around the lake is complex because of the presence of three large peninsulas on the south side and two others on the north side. Tush Bay is an extension of from the lake to East from the second outfall. The Relique Lake outlet empties into the bottom of this bay. In contrast, the Barbie Lake outlet empties into the bottom of a bay in the western portion of the lake.

He receives a call from Nora, who urges him to get a lawyer soon or risk losing custody of Henry. Charlie returns to Los Angeles and hires Bert Spitz, an empathetic and retired family lawyer who favors a civil and conciliatory approach. On Bert's counsel, Charlie rents an apartment in Los Angeles to be closer to his family and strengthen his custody case. Charlie wishes to avoid going to court, so Bert arranges a meeting with Nora and Nicole. Nora argues that Charlie refused to respect Nicole's wishes to move back to Los Angeles and that Henry would prefer to stay with his mother rather than fly back and forth between coasts. Bert privately advises Charlie to drop his New York residency altogether, but a frustrated Charlie refuses and fires him. Using the first payout of his MacArthur Fellowship grant, Charlie hires Jay on retainer. The case moves to court, where Nora and Jay argue aggressively on behalf of their clients, leading to a series of character assassinations; Nora highlights Charlie's past infidelity and emotional distance, while Jay exaggerates Nicole's drinking habits as alcoholism and threatens criminal action for hacking into Charlie's emails. Meanwhile, Charlie and Nicole remain friendly out of court and share time with Henry, who is increasingly annoyed with the back-and-forth. Disillusioned with the legal process, the couple decides to meet in private away from the lawyers. However, a friendly discussion in Charlie's apartment devolves into an emotional and vicious argument; Nicole claims that Charlie has now fully merged with his own selfishness, and Charlie punches a hole in a wall, angrily wishing that she would die. He then breaks down in shame and apologizes; Nicole comforts him. An appointed expert evaluator monitors a night in with Charlie and Henry, during which Charlie accidentally cuts himself. Soon after, the couple agrees to relax their demands and reach an equal agreement to finalize the divorce, although Nora negotiates slightly better terms for Nicole, against her wishes. A year later, Charlie's play has a successful Broadway run, while Nicole has a new boyfriend and is nominated for an Emmy Award for directing an episode of her show. Charlie informs Nicole that he has taken a residency at UCLA and will be living in Los Angeles full-time to be closer to Henry. Later, he discovers Henry reading Nicole's list of things she likes about Charlie she wrote down during counseling. Henry asks Charlie to read it aloud to him, and Charlie does so, becoming emotional as Nicole watches from afar. That evening, after attending a Halloween party together, Nicole offers to let Charlie take Henry home even though it is her night. As Charlie walks out to his car carrying a sleeping Henry, Nicole stops Charlie to tie his shoe for him. He thanks her, and they part ways once more. Cast Jasmine Cephas Jones, Mary Wiseman, Matthew Maher, Gideon Glick, Raymond J. Lee, and Becca Blackwell appear as members of Nicole and Charlie's theater group. Production The idea for the film first came to Baumbach in 2016, while in post-production on The Meyerowitz Stories. He began to research the subject, and met with three- time collaborator Driver to discuss the role. In November 2017, it was announced Driver, Scarlett Johansson, Laura Dern, Merritt Wever and Azhy Robertson were set to star in the film. David Heyman produced the film under his Heyday Films banner, and Netflix produced and distributed. In March 2018, Kyle Bornheimer joined the cast of the film, and in June 2018, it was announced that Ray Liotta had also been added. Principal photography began on January 15, 2018, and lasted 47 days through April 2018, taking place in New York City and Los Angeles. Speaking of writing the film following his divorce from actress Jennifer Jason Leigh, as well as his parents' divorce (which served as inspiration for his earlier film The Squid and the Whale), Baumbach said: Following the release of the film, Baumbach said, \\"I showed [Leigh] the script and then I showed her the movie a little bit ago. She likes it a lot.\\" Release Marriage Story had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on August 29, 2019, and also screened at the Telluride Film Festival on August 31, 2019, and the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2019, where it was first runner-up for the People's Choice Award. It also served as the Centerpiece selection at the New York Film Festival on October 4, 2019, and the BFI London Film Festival on October 6, 2019. Netflix gave it a limited release in theatres beginning November 6, 2019, before streaming the film starting December 6, 2019. Home media In January 2020, it was announced that Marriage Story, The Irishman, American Factory and Atlantics would receive DVD and Blu-ray releases by The Criterion Collection. Marriage Story was released on July 21, 2020. Reception Box office Although Netflix does not publicly disclose the theatrical grosses of its films, IndieWire estimated Marriage Story grossed around $160,000 from five theaters in its opening weekend (and a total $200,000 over its first five days). The site wrote that \\"normally, these (estimated) numbers would be disappointing,\\" but \\"given the theaters and more limited seating, as well as awareness of imminent streaming access within the month\\" it was sufficient for Netflix. Playing at 16 theaters the following weekend, the film made an estimated $140,000, and then $340,000 from 85 theaters in its third. Expanding to 130 theaters in its fourth weekend of release the film made $360,000, for a month-long running total of $1.2 million. The following weekend, despite being released digitally onto Netflix starting the Friday, the film made an estimated $300,000 from 120 theaters, and then $120,000 from 80 theaters the following week. Marriage Story grossed an estimated $2 million in North America and $333,686 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2.3 million. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 94% based on 380 reviews, with an average rating of 8.83/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Observing a splintering union with compassion and expansive grace, the powerfully acted Marriage Story ranks among writer-director Noah Baumbach's best works.\\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 94 out of 100, based on 53 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote, \\"At once funny, scalding, and stirring, built around two bravura performances of incredible sharpness and humanity, it's the work of a major film artist, one who shows that he can capture life in all its emotional detail and complexity — and, in the process, make a piercing statement about how our society now works.\\" Alonso Duralde of TheWrap praised the acting and Baumbach's screenplay, saying, \\"One wonders if Baumbach left references to Kramer vs. Kramer or Two for the Road on the cutting-room floor, but either way, Marriage Story is a film that deserves to be mentioned in their company. It's devastating, essential, and destined to be remembered long after this awards cycle ends.\\" In his review for The Hollywood Reporter, Jon Frosch concurred, writing: \\"Other American films about divorce have portrayed this phenomenon — the legal process driving and shaping the couple's feelings rather than vice versa — but none with the force and clarity of this one [...] It's also funny and, when you least expect it (and most need it), almost unbearably tender, thanks in large part to the sensational leads, who deliver the deepest, most alive and attuned performances of their careers.\\" Rating the film 5 stars out of 5, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called it a \\"wonderfully sweet, sad and funny film\\" that serves as a \\"glorious laugh-out-loud, cry-out- loud portrait of a relationship in its death throes\\" and praised the performances of the cast. Writing for The Washington Post, Ann Hornaday gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4 and praised Johansson and Driver as the \\"two- person fulcrum around which this funny-sad, happy-harrowing movie revolves.\\" In a mixed review, GQs David Levesley opined that the film was \\"fundamentally, a good piece of cinema\\", but disliked the unacknowledged upper-class privilege that the characters possessed, commenting: \\"The world of third-wave coffee, delicatessens and Upper West Side therapy has been done to death and does not speak to as much of the human condition as the people wading through it themselves seem to think.\\" Armond White of The National Review also panned the film's bourgeois themes and the lead actors' performances, writing: \\"This story is really about class rivalry clouded by a sex-and-cinema surface. The obnoxious sentimentality of Marriage Story forces a filmmaker's self- righteousness on us ... It is Johansson and Driver who suffer Baumbach's superficiality. This is his least-bad movie only because the quality of the performances [of the supporting cast] is improved.\\" Accolades Marriage Story was chosen by the American Film Institute, the National Board of Review, and Time magazine as one of the ten best films of the year. The film received a leading six nominations at the 77th Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture – Drama, winning one award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture. The film received eight nominations at the 25th Critics' Choice Awards, three nominations at the 26th Screen Actors Guild Awards for the performances of Driver, Johansson, and Dern, five nominations at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards, and six nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards. Time Magazine's annual best performances of the year list by Stephanie Zacharek listed Driver as the third best film acting performance of 2019. Laura Dern won the Best Supporting Actress Award at the 92nd Academy Awards.

Authority The relevant constitutional clause states: Certain cases that have not been considered by a lower court may be heard by the Supreme Court in the first instance under what is termed original jurisdiction. The Supreme Court's authority in this respect is also derived from Article III of the Constitution, which states that the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction \\"in all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party.\\" The original jurisdiction of the Court is set forth in . This statute provides that lower federal courts may also hear cases where the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction, with the exception of disputes between two or more states. When a case is between two or more states, the Supreme Court holds both original and exclusive jurisdiction, and no lower court may hear such cases. In one of its earliest cases, Chisholm v. Georgia,Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419 (1793). the Court found this jurisdiction to be self-executing, so that no further Congressional action was required to permit the Court to exercise it.Kenneth R. Thomas, Larry M. Eig, The Constitution of the United States of America, Analysis and Interpretation (2013), p. 859. The constitutional grant of original jurisdiction to the Supreme Court can not be expanded by statute. In the case of Marbury v. Madison,Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). the newly elected President, Thomas Jefferson, ordered his acting Secretary of State not to deliver commissions for appointments that had been made by his predecessor, John Adams. One of these appointees, William Marbury, filed a petition for a writ of mandamus directly in the Supreme Court, on the jurisdictional grounds that the Judiciary Act of 1789 stated that the Supreme Court \\"shall have power to issue writs of prohibition to the district courts [...] and writs of mandamus [...] to any courts appointed, or persons holding office, under the authority of the United States\\". The Court, in its first exercise of judicial review over a statute enacted by Congress, held that this grant of power to the Supreme Court was beyond what the Constitution permitted, and that this language was therefore invalid as unconstitutional.Kenneth R. Thomas, Larry M. Eig, The Constitution of the United States of America, Analysis and Interpretation (2013), p. 781. Cases The number of cases heard pursuant to the court's original jurisdiction \\"has always been a minute portion of its overall caseload\\", generally including only one or two such cases per term. Most of these cases involve disputes over state boundaries and water rights, but others center on tax or interstate pollution issues. The Court has tended to decline other kinds of cases arising from disputes between the states. Examples of such cases include the 1892 case of United States v. Texas,United States v. Texas, 143 U.S. 621 (1892). a case to determine whether a parcel of land belonged to the United States or to Texas, and Virginia v. Tennessee,Virginia v. Tennessee, 148 U.S. 503 (1893). a case turning on whether an incorrectly drawn boundary between two states can be changed by a state court, and whether the setting of the correct boundary requires Congressional approval. Two other original jurisdiction cases involve colonial era borders and rights under navigable waters in New Jersey v. Delaware,New Jersey v. Delaware, 552 U.S. 597 (2008) and water rights between riparian states upstream of navigable waters in Kansas v. Colorado.Kansas v. Colorado, 185 U.S. 125 (1902); 206 U.S. 46 (1907); 320 U.S. 383 (1943); 514 U.S. 673 (1995); 533 U.S. 1 (2001); 543 U.S. 86 (2004); 556 U.S. 98 (2009). On one occasion, United States v. Shipp, a criminal complaint was filed directly to the court, which gave the court original jurisdiction over a criminal case for the first and only time in its history. Procedure Because the nine-member Supreme Court is not well- suited to conducting pretrial proceedings or trials, original jurisdiction cases accepted by the Court are typically referred to a well-qualified lawyer or lower-court judge to serve as special master, conduct the proceedings, and report recommendations to the Court. The Court then considers whether to accept the special master's report or whether to sustain any exceptions filed to the report. Although it has not happened since 1794 in the case of Georgia v. Brailsford, parties in an action at law in which the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction may request that a jury determine issues of fact. See Georgia v. Brailsford, , in which the Court conducted a jury trial. In 1950, in the case United States v. Louisiana, the state of Louisiana moved for a jury trial, but the Court denied the motion, ruling that the suit was an equity action and not an action at law, and that therefore the Seventh Amendment guarantee of a jury trial did not apply. If a matter involving an action at law did come before the court, however, a jury might be empaneled. The Court noted in a footnote in the decision that under 28 U.S.C. 1872: \\"In all original actions at law in the Supreme Court against citizens of the United States, issues of fact shall be tried by a jury.\\" However, it did not decide whether the statute and the Seventh Amendment required such a jury.

The castle may be reached via a steep footpath from the visitor mine of Weiße Grube in the valley of Langental. The path passes the \\"Iron Man\\" monument (Eiserner Mann).  History  There are several clues that the road called in the records the Old Rockenhausen Road (alte Rockenhauser Straße), which ran from the area of Hahnweilerhof, continued past Hohenfels Castle in the direction of Falkenstein and Rockenhausen to Bad Kreuznach, had existed since Roman times. In 1820 a Roman hoard of 28 coins was found, which were dated to about the year 340 AD. Because there is also evidence of Roman mining activity in the deeply incised Langental valley, it is highly probable that there was a Roman fortification or road station in the area around Hohenfels Castle, as was common in the Late Roman period. The assertion that, in 1128, Werner of Bolanden and his wife Guda of Hohenfels were named, and that Guda was the last member of an old Hohenfels dynasty cannot be proved by documentary evidence. It is true that, in that year and for the first time, a certain Werner of Bolanden appears in the light of history by being mentioned in a document, but his wife's name is not known. The fact is, however, that in the Bohland Fief Books (Bohlander Lehensbüchern) of the 12th century, the brothers Werner and Philip of Bolanden are mentioned as being enfeoffed with a castle, which the former Abbot of Prüm, Caesarius of Milendonk, described in 1222 in the Prüm Urbar in Latin as: bonum castrum quod Hoviles appelatur (the mining district of Imsbach had belonged since the 9th century to Prüm Abbey in the Eifel mountains). It is also the case that, in the first decades of the 13th century, the Bolanden family was divided into the lines of \\"Bolanden\\", \\"Falkenstein\\" and \\"Hohenfels\\". After that, Philip III of Bolanden-Hohenfels was owner of the castle until 1277; he was the imperial chamberlain or Reichskämmerer and \\"Procurator on the Middle Rhine\\".

Many of Gosney's commissioned works are in the public domain; notably at York Art Gallery and on permanent display in Ripon, York and Chester cathedrals.  Career  Gosney became a student at Grimsby School of Art in 1954. He completed their Foundation course with such success that, two years later, he was offered a place at the prestigious Slade School of Fine Art. He won several prizes whilst studying at the Slade, eventually specialising in theatre design. In 1960, Gosney returned to teach at the Grimsby School of Art. He became deeply interested in sculpture from this point onwards. Gosney has worked in wood and copper with favourite themes being birds, horses and the female form. He developed a unique technique for working with sheet metal in three dimensions, exemplified by the life-size Horse and Rider, now permanently on display at Normanby Hall in North Lincolnshire. The majority of Gosney's early commissions were collaborations with architects and he has made a significant contribution to public art in Grimsby. He is the artist responsible for the reliefs on the Abbey Walk car park, the large Grimsby seal by the entrance to the Grimsby Central Library and the Grim and Havelok themed copper relief on the side of Wilko store in Old Market Place. Gosney retired from teaching in 1992 and moved to York to concentrate on sculpture. As a rule, Gosney does not sell his work, but to celebrate his 80th birthday and retrospective exhibition, he offered two lots for auction, with all proceeds being donated to the Stained Glass Trust in York.  Themes  Gosney's work is often inspired by classical and Renaissance art and themes drawn from ancient and modern mythologies. The human form and the horse dominate his subject matter and can be seen in many of his intriguing and remarkable sculptures and the beautifully executed drawings which he makes when first planning commissions. The artist has explained how his approach has changed over the years: \\"My first sculptures in the early 60's were in stone and were considerably inspired by the work of Henry Moore. When I experimented, first with cold cast metal and later with welding in steel and copper, I carried out a number of abstract pieces. However, I soon needed a different challenge and returned to work that was derived from observation and drawing, mostly inspired by human and animal forms. My work, whilst not overtly realistic, aims to consider the essence of the subject.\\"  Awards  * Gosney was awarded the Slade School of Art drawing prize as a student.

A neural network is randomly initialized and used as prior to solve inverse problems such as noise reduction, super-resolution, and inpainting. Image statistics is captured by the structure of a convolutional image generator rather than by any previously learned capabilities.  Method   Background  Inverse problems such as noise reduction, super-resolution, and inpainting can be formulated as the optimization task x^{*} = min_x E (x;x_0 )+R(x), where x is an image, x_0 a corrupted representation of that image, E(x;x_0 ) is a task- dependent data term, and R(x) is the regularizer. This forms an energy minimization problem. Deep neural networks learn a generator/decoder x=f_\\\\theta (z) which maps a random code vector z to an image x. The image corruption method used to generate x_0 is selected for the specific application.  Specifics  In this approach, the R(x) prior is replaced with the implicit prior captured by the neural network (where R(x)=0 for images that can be produced by a deep neural networks and R(x)=+\\\\infin otherwise). This yields the equation for the minimizer \\\\theta^* = argmin_\\\\theta E(f_\\\\theta(z);x_0) and the result of the optimization process x^* = f_{\\\\theta^*}(z). The minimizer \\\\theta^* (typically a gradient descent) starts from a randomly initialized parameters and descends into a local best result to yield the x^* restoration function. = Overfitting = A parameter θ may be used to recover any image, including its noise. However, the network is reluctant to pick up noise because it contains high impedance while useful signal offers low impedance. This results in the θ parameter approaching a good-looking local optimum so long as the number of iterations in the optimization process remains low enough not to overfit data.  Applications   Denoising  The principle of denoising is to recover an image x from a noisy observation x_0, where x_0 = x + \\\\epsilon. The distribution \\\\epsilon is sometimes known (e.g.: profiling sensor and photon noise) and may optionally be incorporated into the model, though this process works well in blind denoising. The quadratic energy function E(x,x_0)=x-x_0^2 is used as the data term, plugging it into the equation for \\\\theta^* yields the optimization problem min_\\\\theta f_\\\\theta (z)-x_0^2.  Super-resolution  Super-resolution is used to generate a higher resolution version of image x. The data term is set to E(x;x_0)=d(x)-x_0^2 where d(·) is a downsampling operator such as Lanczos that decimates the image by a factor t.  Inpainting  Inpainting is used to reconstruct a missing area in an image x_0. These missing pixels are defined as the binary mask m \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ 0,1 \\\\\\\\} ^ {H \\\\times V}. The data term is defined as E(x;x_0)=(x-x_0) \\\\odot m^2 (where \\\\odot is the Hadamard product).  Flash-no-flash reconstruction  This approach may be extended to multiple images. A straightforward example mentioned by the author is the reconstruction of an image to obtain natural light and clarity from a flash- no-flash pair. Video reconstruction is possible but it requires optimizations to take into account the spatial differences.

He claims to be the heir to the Libyan throne and the leader of the so-called Sanussiyyah movement. Early life and education El mahdi Mohammad Senosi was born in Tripoli on January 1, 1987. He was the third son of Sayyid Abdullah al-Abid al-Senussi (1919–88) and his second wife Ghalia bin Nur Saleh. His father's third wife was the daughter of Crown Prince Muhammad al-Rida, who himself was a brother of King Idris. On September 1, 1969, Muammar Gaddafi ended the rule of the Western-backed Senussi monarchy of Idris in a 1969 coup. Having taken power, Gaddafi converted Libya into a republic ruled by his Revolutionary Command Council and ended the monarchical government. At the time, Elmahdi bin Abdullah al-Senussi was attending school in England together with his brother. He was informed of the events that took place in his homeland, including the end to the monarchy, in a phone call. Al-Senussi later went on to study at the Brummana High School in Lebanon. The end of the monarchy resulted in the Libyan royal family being placed under house arrest. Al-Senussi used this time to bring forward his claim of being the legitimate heir to the throne. However, this claim is contested. A royal decree and the constitution of Libya in force at this time designated both Prince Mohammed El Senussi as the heir of the last Libyan Crown Prince. This makes Prince Mohammed El Senussi the heir of the crown of the Senussi family. Claim to the throne El mahdi Senosi disputes the claim of Prince Mohammed El Senussi to the crown. He sees himself as the rightful successor to the throne based on the Libyan constitution of 1951 and its amendments in 1961. Following the end to Muammar Gaddafi's rule, this constitution is to be reinstated giving the people of Libya the right to choose their leader. Claims made by El mahdi Senosi relating to the succession to the throne are difficult to verify. Making the matter more complicated it that El mahdi Senosi is only the third son of Sayyid Abdullah al-Abid senosi, not his first born. Furthermore, his mother, Ghalia bin Nur Saleh, was only his father's second wife. This makes his claim to the throne difficult. In the early 2000s, El mahdi Senosi lobbied the British government to support his claim by officially recognising him as the rightful heir to the Libyan throne. He spent almost £50,000 on these efforts but was only partially successful. While London did not officially recognise him as the heir to the throne, he did obtain a motion signed by 41 members of the British Parliament. This motion named Idris el-Senussi as “heir presumptive of the Libyan throne”. However, his successes in lobbying petered out once it was established that he was not the great nephew of the late king. Libyan Civil War The Libyan Civil War gave new impetus to El mahdi Mohammad Senosi's ambitions of claiming the throne. He began negotiations with several key players involved in the civil war, including the United States Department of State, the United States Congress, and several other American officials. He also negotiated with officials from France and Saudi Arabia. During the Civil War, and following the death of Muammar Gaddafi, Senosi returned to Libya to visit the palace of the royal family. He described his visit as \\"the happiest moment in his life except for the birth of his children\\". Libya consists of a conglomerate of tribes, the majority of which are part of the Sanussiyyah movement. El mahdi Mohammad Senosi claims to be the leader of this movement thereby cementing the legitimacy of his claim to be the ruler of Libya. His claim to this leadership of the Sanussiyyah movement is supported by an advisory council. According to El mahdi Mohammad Senosi, the issue of the inheritance to the throne is to be resolved by a family council. This however, is against the royal decree which named Mohammed El Senosi as the heir to the throne. Furthermore, Mohammad El Senosi is widely accepted as the legitimate heir and successor to the throne of the King of Libya. Career Senosi is a successful businessman became a director of Washington Investment Partners. He also held the post of Director of the China Sciences Conservational Power Ltd. His activity expanded into the oil and gas industry where he became involved with Ansaldo Energia, Eni and Snamprogetti. He also mediated the contract for the construction of the Port of Ras Laffan.

Salmon was a North York city and then Metro Toronto Councillor from 1985-1997. Salmon was awarded the Order of Ontario in 2016 and the Order of Canada in 2017. Early life and education Born in Toronto in the 1930s, Salmon was the daughter of Beverley Herbert Bell, of Jamaica, and Violet Bryan, a fifth generation Canadian. Salmon began her nursing training at Wellesley Hospital in 1950 and finished a certificate in nursing at the University of Toronto in 1954. Salmon married Dr. Douglas Salmon in 1956 and the couple had four children.  Community work  Salmon was a founding member of the Toronto Urban Alliance on Race Relations (UARR) which was established in 1975, among the rise of racial tensions in Toronto. She worked closely with other UARR members, including Dr. Wilson A. Head and Jean Augustine, and served on the Media Committee and the Board of Directors. Career After completing her training, Salmon started her nursing career in Detroit, Michigan, in 1956. While in the city she had the opportunity to hear leaders of the civil rights movement such as Martin Luther King Jr., and was inspired on her return to Toronto to become involved in civil rights activism. Salmon was the founding chair of the Toronto Board of Education's Black Liaison Committee, where she worked to institute anti-racism training for teachers and increase coverage of Black history in the curriculum. She was a co-founder of the Urban Alliance on Race Relations and was the Ontario Human Rights Commission's first Black female commissioner. Salmon first ran for elected office in the 1976 municipal election as alderman for Ward 8 on North York Council losing to Alan Milliken Heisey Sr.. Salmon ran again as councillor for Ward 8 in the 1985 municipal election defeating Andy Borins. Borins had been removed from office as Ward 8 councillor during the previous term by a court order due to a court application made by Barbara Greene.Borins was subsequently removed from office for conflict of interest by Judge's order \\"Libel lawsuit against controller sparked alderman's downfall\\", Globe and Mail, 18 April 1985, M1 She was Toronto's first female black City councillor.

The Huskies are members of the NIHL 2 South East Division and play their home games at Alexandra Palace. Formation The EIHA announced on 1 June 2017 that the Haringey Racers would no longer be operating a NIHL franchise out of Alexandra Palace, instead a new team, the Haringey Huskies, would be offered the Racers spot in the league. This announcement was not without controversy as Racers owner David Richards Jnr would claim that the franchise had been stolen from him by the Huskies ownership. The EIHA would later state that this was not the case and that the Racers were unable to compete due to a \\"breakdown in the relationship between themselves and Alexandra Palace, which includes substantial monies still owed\\", and as such they approved the Huskies filling the slot left by the Racers. The first player signed to the Huskies was former Racer Stuart Appleby. The Huskies faced the Basingstoke Buffalo in their maiden game, suffering a 6-3 loss, however, due to the Buffalo fielding an ineligible player, this result was overturned and the Huskies declared the victors. During this game, Ben Osborne scored the first goal in franchise history. In the 2020 Wilkinson cup (NIHL south 2) the huskies came top, winning the cup.

The main focus of the summit was anti-corruption following the outbreak of the Odebrecht scandal, which affected numerous countries in the region, while attention was also put upon the crisis in Venezuela. Background The 2015 Summit of the Americas in Panama was held in a positive atmosphere, largely thanks to Barack Obama's normalization of relations with Cuba, which was welcomed by the rest of the Western Hemisphere as a long-overdue rectification of a Cold War relic, considering that Latin American leaders, especially those in Bolivia and Venezuela, warned at the 2012 Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, that the holding the 2015 summit was impossible without Cuba's participation. However, Donald Trump in June 2017 announced a reinvigorated hardline towards Cuba by banning U.S. business transactions with Cuban companies run by the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces and imposing some restrictions on Americans' travel to Cuba (banning Americans from visiting military-run establishments). He has also imposed economic sanctions against Venezuela, arguing President Nicolas Maduro's disrespect for his country's democratic institutions. On February 13, 2018, Peru revoked Venezuela's invitation to the Summit because of Maduro's plan to hold an early presidential election, as the major opposing parties were banned from it. Maduro insisted that he would attend the summit anyway, but eventually declined from doing so on April 10. Delsa Solórzano would represent Venezuela in the summit instead. Solórzano is a deputy and the Vice President of A New Era, an opposition political party. On April 10, 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump stated he would not attend the Summit in order to focus on the fallout of the Douma chemical attack. Vice President Mike Pence attended in his place.\\"Trump Cancels Trip to Latin America, Citing Crisis in Syria\\". The New York Times. April 10, 2018. Events 13 April Representatives gathered on April 14, 2018 The President of Ecuador Lenín Moreno visited Peru, but left a short time before the summit could start. A hostage crisis at the Colombian border caused the suspected death of two journalists, and he announced that he would take military action unless the captors proved otherwise within a 12-hours time frame. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence announced that the United States Department of State and United States Agency for International Development would provide $16 million to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to fund aid for Venezuelan refugees in Brazil and Colombia affected during the Bolivarian diaspora.  14 April  Many of the countries present at the summit condemned the Bolivarian Government of Venezuela, specifically embattled President Nicolás Maduro, and made statements rejecting the recognition of upcoming presidential elections. Vice President of the United States Mike Pence stated, \\"Every free nation gathered here must take action to isolate the Maduro regime. We must all stand with our brothers and sisters suffering in Venezuela\\", blaming Cuba for creating and defending corrupt governments in Latin America. Venezuela's allies Bolivia and Cuba defended President Maduro, criticizing his ban from the summit. Foreign Minister of Cuba Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla called the United States a racist country while also criticizing the bombings of Damascus and Homs and the gun politics in the United States. Countries also signed the \\"Lima Commitment\\" to agree on methods of combatting corruption in the region, with the proposal to create multi-national mechanisms of cooperation and anti-graft laws. Some countries such as Bolivia stated that the document would be used to \\"topple legitimate governments\\", comparing it to the war on drugs, with Bolivian president Evo Morales stating that the United States was the \\"main threat against democracy, against peace, against freedom\\".

Born in County Galway, Tevenan moved with his family to Liverpool when he was a young child. The family then settled in Chesterfield, Derbyshire where he worked first making pottery, then spent time as a miner, before finding work on the railways. Initially, he was a porter, then plate-layer, before becoming a signalman, and finally a station-master. A supporter of trade unionism, Tevenan became active in the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, and served on its executive committee from 1891 to 1893. He was prominent in two strikes in Kingston-upon-Hull, one in 1890 among goodsworkers, and one in 1892 involving dockers. He became secretary of the union's operations in Ireland, and in 1896 convinced the Irish Trades Union Congress (ITUC) to convene a committee, chaired by himself, to consider whether a national federation of trade unions could be established. In 1900 and 1901, Tevenan served as treasurer of the ITUC. After spending a period as an insurance agent and running to become an elected auditor in Stockport, in 1905 he found work as joint organiser of the Municipal Employees' Association (MEA), later becoming the union's North East District Secretary. In 1906, Tevenan fell out with the MEA's general secretary, Albin Taylor, who dismissed him. Tevenan felt that Taylor's action was unwarranted, and was able to convince a majority of the MEA's members of this. They voted to suspend Taylor and reinstate Tevenan. Taylor responded by resigning and setting up the rival National Union of Corporation Workers, while Tevenan was reinstated.Bernard Dix and Stephen Williams, Serving the Public: Building the Union, pp.42-208 In 1913, Tevenan was elected as general secretary of the MEA. Membership grew rapidly under his leadership, reaching a peak of 70,000. He was also active in the Public Services International, serving as its president for twelve years. He supported the merger of unions representing municipal workers; he took a leading role in the negotiations which formed the National Union of General and Municipal Workers in 1924. The MEA merged into the new union, and Tevenan served as one of its first two joint assistant general secretaries, and head of its municipal department. Tevenan was active in the Labour Party. At the 1918 United Kingdom general election, he stood as its candidate in Liverpool Edge Hill, taking second place with 36.2% of the vote. In 1924/25, he served on the party's National Executive Committee. Tevenan retired in 1932 and died eleven years later.

It has been known as \\"alegría\\" since the 16th century. The alegría of Tulyehualco was officially declared Patrimonio Cultural Intangible de la Ciudad de México (an intangible part of the cultural heritage of Mexico City) in September 2016. Amaranth is a plant native to Mexico. In prehispanic times, in addition to forming part of the diet of the indigenous people, it was also used as currency and for ceremonial purposes. Figures of amaranth and honey were made as offerings to the gods. In order to stop those religious practices, Hernán Cortés banned the cultivation of amaranth. The plant began to fall into disuse because those who continued to cultivate it faced being put to death as punishment. Alegrías have become the most popular way of consuming amaranth. These sweets are prepared by puffing the seeds in a hot pan without oil. The popping starts in seconds. When finished, they are mixed with honey or sugar syrup and sometimes with additions such as roasted seeds (e.g. peanut or pumpkin) or chopped dried fruits. The mixture is molded into different forms and is packaged for sale.

The Dallas Morning News wrote that she helped raise tens of millions of dollars for charity. Altshuler was the first woman to serve or chair several boards, including the Salvation Army Dallas Advisory Board, the board of Goodwill Industries, and the chair of the Board of Trustees of Southern Methodist University. She was also inducted into the Texas Woman's Hall of Fame.  Biography  Altshuler grew up in a mansion with her two brothers and parents in Dallas. Her father, Carr Collins Sr., had founded the Fidelity Union Life Insurance Company in the 1920s. Altshuler graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas, and spent her summers at an exclusive girls' camp in Texas Hill Country. One of her brothers, James M. Collins, would become a member of the United States Congress. She attended Southern Methodist University where she met her husband, a naval aviator, when she was a junior. They were married, but her first husband died in combat during World War II. Altshuler started working at Dallas Love Field and met her second husband, Charles S. Sharp, whom she married in 1947. While pregnant with the first of her three children, she looked into joining the Junior League. She started working in the Junior League the next year. In the Junior League, she saw people who were in need and she began to volunteer. Altshuler was inspired to do philanthropy because of her parents and also because of the ideas of Albert Schweitzer. In 1960, she was appointed to head the woman's division of the 1960 Dallas County Community Chest Campaign. In 1974, she was the first woman to lead the Millionaires Chorus for the Salvation Army Christmas show. When her brother, Collins, ran for a Senate seat in 1982, she helped him with his campaign. She traveled across Texas to promote her brother's candidacy. She didn't like to talk about politics, and instead focused on the kind of person her brother was. Charles Sharp eventually was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and died in 1984. Altshuler remarried to a physician, Ken Altshuler. Altshuler helped form the Tocqueville Society in 1986 when she asked more than 100 friends to help her support the United Way. She and her friends raised $1 million and then formed the Tocqueville Society. In 1987, she was inducted into the Texas Woman's Hall of Fame. In 1992, she personally donated $1 million to the United Way of Dallas. Also in 1992, she was a co-chair on the committee to recruit advisors to Ross Perot's presidential campaign. Altshuler was friends with Perot's wife. In 2008, the Smithsonian Institution's Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars gave Altshuler their Award for Public Service. In 2013, she was in charge of planning the event commemorating the 50th anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Altshuler died at age 93 on December 8, 2017. She had suffered complications from a broken hip. Her memorial service was held on December 14 at the Highland Park Methodist Church.

He was one of the first inductees into the \\"Golden Voice\\" hall of fame started by the trade publication AudioFile. Early life Case was born in London on April 25, 1932 to a father who made tombstones during the Great Depression. As a child he enjoyed mimicking actors and he was later awarded a singing scholarship to St Edward's School, Oxford. After graduating he enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art to be an actor. He worked with a repertory company in northern England, and made about 13 TV appearances between 1959 and 1964, including as \\"Bob\\" on the BBC show Maigret (1962) for one episode, but his acting career was not overly successful playing minor and occasional roles. Career In 1976, he moved to San Francisco with his companion, Graham Watts. They had a business in Oakland importing antiques. In his spare time, he directed community theater productions, including one show that included British-born actress Wanda McCaddon who became friendly with Case. McCaddon, who was working at Books on Tape at the time, introduced him to the world of audiobook narration, an industry which was coming into maturity during the 1980s. \\"When he found out I was doing books on tape, he said, 'That sounds like something I'd like to do'\\", McCaddon remembered. Sigrid Hecht, co- founder of Books on Tape, was initially skeptical of his breathy interpretations. However he would excel at British works, recording 13 novels by Anthony Trollope, 36 by P. G. Wodehouse and the entire \\"Forsyte\\" chronicles by John Galsworthy. He worked as a freelance artist mostly for Books on Tape and Blackstone Audio during the 1980s and 1990s. Depending on the publisher, he recorded as David Case (Books on Tape), Frederick Davidson (Blackstone), Edward Raleigh, James Nelson, and Ian McKay. Case was a popular narrator, \\"Readers said, 'Give me anything by Frederick Davidson,'\\" recalled Lysa Williams of Blackstone Audio. AudioFile editor and founder, Robin Whitten, said Case recorded three times as many books as most other performers. Some listeners found his style off-putting, \\"the most frequent criticism is that he sounds snooty and that his Continental accents all sound the same — sort of Austro-Hungarian\\", observed Katherine Powers. But he had fans, the Washington Post obituary by Adam Bernstein said \\"The English-born, classically trained Mr. Case was among the finest\\". He was nominated for a Grammy Award and received numerous AudioFile Earphones Awards. Death Case, a lifelong smoker, developed throat cancer in 2000 but kept recording, though his output slowed. He refused to stop smoking and doctors were forced to remove his larynx in May 2005, after which he lost his voice entirely. He died at his home in El Sobrante, California on October 1, 2005, unable to utter a sound.

Formed in 1967, the group originally included guitarist and lead vocalist Joe Matt, bassist and backing vocalist Mike Blair, keyboardist Neal Doughty and drummer Alan Gratzer. Matt left early the next year after graduating from school, with Terry Luttrell taking his place on lead vocals. Bob Crownover took over as the band's guitarist, but was replaced after a brief tenure by Bill Fiorio and later Steve Scorfina. Blair left a few months after Matt, with Gregg Philbin taking his place. The band also briefly added saxophonist Joe McCabe and trumpeter Marty Shepard to its lineup in 1968. By late 1970, REO Speedwagon had finalised its first recording lineup with the addition of guitarist Gary Richrath in place of Scorfina. In early 1972, shortly after the release of the band's self-titled debut album, Luttrell left REO Speedwagon following a disagreement with Richrath. The vocalist was replaced by Kevin Cronin, who performed on the group's second album R.E.O./T.W.O. before leaving during sessions for the 1973 follow-up. Mike Murphy took over and recorded Ridin' the Storm Out, Lost in a Dream and This Time We Mean It, but was replaced by a returning Cronin in 1976. Philbin left the following year, with Bruce Hall taking his place. The band's lineup remained stable thereafter for more than ten years until Gratzer decided to retire in 1988, with Graham Lear brought in as his replacement. Richrath also left early the next year, with Miles Joseph filling in for a show before Dave Amato took over in May. Also in 1989, Bryan Hitt replaced Lear on drums, while Jesse Harms joined as a second keyboardist, performing on the band's 1990 album The Earth, a Small Man, His Dog and a Chicken. Since the end of Harms's brief tenure with the group, REO Speedwagon has retained a consistent lineup of Kevin Cronin, Dave Amato, Bruce Hall, Neal Doughty and Bryan Hitt.

In April 2020 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1989, Osborn ; obtained the first proof of the four- dimensional C-theorem, which was conjectured one year earlier by John Cardy. Osborn's proof was applicable to renormalization group flows which are perturbative, that is do not deviate far from the free quantum field theories, and was valid to all orders in perturbation theory. It provided a strong hint that the four-dimensional C-theorem must be universally valid, but a nonperturbative proof of this fact was found only in 2011 by Zohar Komargodski and Adam Schwimmer. In 2001 and 2004, Osborn, in collaboration with Francis Dolan, obtained explicit expressions for the conformal blocks in four dimensional conformal field theories.; Starting from 2008, these results found many important applications within the conformal bootstrap approach to conformal field theories.

A Marxist in the Trotskyist tradition, he was central to the Non-European Unity Movement from its inception in 1943, as well as in the African Peoples' Democratic Union of Southern Africa (APDUSA) formed 1961. He is notable for his innovative analyses, theoretical work and lifelong commitment to the movement. Tabata was married to Jane Gool, a major political activist. Early years and the Workers Party of South Africa Isaac Bangani Tabata was born on 10 June 1909 at Bailey, near Queenstown in the Eastern Cape. He attended his secondary schooling at the mission school of Lovedale, whose other notable alumni include Steve Biko, Ellen Kuzwayo, Govan Mbeki and Charles Nqakula. He continued his studies in the University of Fort Hare, and then, from 1931, worked in Cape Town to seek employment. He found work as a truck driver and soon joined the racially diverse Lorry Drivers' Union, where he served as a member of the executive body. It was when he joined the Cape African Voters Association that he was exposed to Marxist and other radical literature. He was a founding member of the Trotskyist Workers Party of South Africa (WPSA) in 1935, and joined the All African Convention (AAC) formed the same year, holding office in its executive body. Along with Jane Gool (later his wife) and her brother Dr Goolam Gool, Tabata played a significant role in the AAC’s campaign against and analysis of the 1935 Land Act and moves towards the removal of the qualified franchise for Coloureds and Africans in the Cape Province. When the ANC withdrew from the AAC, Tabata worked building the AAC into a new national coalition. Tabata was also one of the founders of the Anti-Coloured Affairs Department Group (Anti-C.A.D). The Unity Movement Tabata was a founder member of in the Non-European Unity Movement (NEUM) from its inception in 1943, which brought together the AAC and other bodies into a new national structure. The WPSA had gone underground in 1939, and focused much of its energies on the NEUM. From 1943, Tabata was a leading figure in both the NEUM and the AAC. Tabata's first book, the Awakening of a People in 1950, examined the political struggle in South Africa and argued the case for the NEUM. Tabata was critical of the African National Congress (ANC) and the South African Communist Party (SACP), which were the dominant political movements of the time, arguing for a peasant-based struggle. He also argued for complete non-collaboration with the apartheid regime and its allies.The ANC Transformed, by Mercia Andrews, Amandla Magazine, April 2012 He also stressed the importance of a long-term strategy of political education. Tabata often travelled between Cape Town and the rural Transkei, distributing and publishing the NEUM program, and helping build a significant NEUM network in Pondoland. He focused on attacking government 'rehablitation' programmes that aimed at limiting African farmers' livestock in the overcrowded African reserves. The Xhosa version of the NEUM text, The Rehabilitation Scheme: A New Fraud, was widely circulated and Tabata was involved in Transkei resistance to the rehabilitation schemes. Such activities led to his arrest in Mount Ayliff in 1948. The arguments for peasant-based struggle and for boycotts were developed further by Tabata in a new pamphlet \\"Boycott as a Weapon of Struggle\\" in 1952, published at the same time as the ANC and the (now- underground) SACP started the Defiance Campaign of mass civil disobedience. During this time, he wrote Education for Barbarism, which criticised the Bantu Education system. In 1956, the state banned Tabata from public political activity, and confined him to Cape Town, for a period of five years, and the Suppression of Communism Act also led to the suppression of his writings. However, his work bore fruit, as the NEUM played a role in the 1950-1961 Pondoland revolt. The Non-European Unity Movement split in 1957, and Tabata helped found the African Peoples' Democratic Union of Southern Africa group in 1961, as soon as his banning order ended, followed by the Unity Movement of South Africa (UMSA) in 1964.'Robin Kayser & Mohamed Adhikari, 2004, \\"Peasant and Proletarian: A History of the African Peoples' Democratic Union of Southern Africa,\\" Kleio, volume 36, number 1, pp. 5-27 Tabata would remain a key leader of both UMSA and APDUSA for the rest of his life. Tabata fled into exile in 1963, initially to Swaziland and then to Zambia. He also lived in Tanzania and Harare, Zimbabwe, where he died on 13 October 1990. In exile, Tabata did speaking tours of the United States of America in 1965 and 1970, addressed the Organisation of the African Union (OAU) and submitting various memoranda, and also addressed the United Nations Special Committee on Apartheid in 1971. Writings Tabata wrote extensively for nearly fifty years: besides texts noted earlier, other notable and widely-read works by Tabata include Birth of a Nation , the Imperialist Conspiracy in Africa, Letter to Mandela, On The Agrarian Problem, Apartheid Cosmetics Exposed, The PAC Venture in Perspective\\". Most of these are now online. Legacy Tabata played a major role in the formation of the Unity Movement tradition, which was until the 1970s the largest Trotskyist current in southern Africa. Both the African Peoples' Democratic Union of Southern Africa / Unity Movement of South Africa (UMSA) and New Unity Movement trends continue to hold Tabata in high esteem. For the former, he was 'a giant in intellect, an indefatigable and revolutionary politician, an outstanding orator and a skilled, analytical writer' who left a 'tremendous legacy'. For the latter, he was an extraordinary 'theoretician, writer, orator, organiser', and 'a Marxist of the highest calibre' APDUSA Views, October 1991, 'Special Issue: A Tribute to I.B. Tabata' Thabo Mbeki, who then occupied the presidency of the Republic of South Africa, awarded Tabata the Order of Lethuli in gold for \\"exceptional contribution to the founding of organisations which forged unity among the oppressed across race and class boundaries\\".

She was a keen supporter of the society, helping it campaign for licensed slaughterhouses, humane slaughter and for an end to performing animals. Her husband died in 1907, leaving her with an adopted son. Her second husband, Platon Eustathios Drakoules (or Drakoulis), was a Greek socialist, ex-member of the Greek Parliament. They shared a common interest in humanitarianism.Kean, Hilda.

It has a single tubular, green leaf and up to twenty five small, light green, pinkish-cream and purplish flowers. It rarely flowers and the largest number of flowers seen in any one year was three in 2001. Description Prasophyllum taphanyx is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf which is long and wide. Between fifteen and twenty five light green, pinkish-cream and purplish flowers are crowded along a flowering spike which is long reaching to a height of . The flowers are long and wide and as with other leek orchids, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is about long and wide. The lateral sepals are about long and wide and free from each other. The petals are about long, wide and spread widely apart from each other. The labellum is pinkish to purplish, about long and wide, and turns sharply upwards through about 90° near its middle. There is a broad, shiny green callus in the centre of the labellum and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs in October and November. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum taphanyx was first formally described in 2004 by David Jones from a specimen collected in a cemetery in Campbell Town and the description was published in The Orchadian. The specific epithet (taphanyx) is derived from the Ancient Greek words taphos meaning \\"grave\\" or \\"tomb\\" and antyx meaning \\"edge\\" or \\"rim\\", reflecting where the species is found and its \\"perilous predicament\\". Distribution and habitat The graveside leek orchid is only known from three plants in remnant native grassland. Conservation This orchid is classed as \\"Endangered\\" under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 and as Critically Endangered under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act. The main threats to the species are its critically small population, land clearing and pasture improvement, inappropriate weed control and grazing, mowing or fire during the flowering period.

The event took place on February 17, 1996 in the ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Ten professional wrestling matches were contested at the event. In the main event, Raven defeated The Sandman to retain the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. Other featured matches on the card were Shane Douglas versus Cactus Jack, 2 Cold Scorpio versus Sabu for the ECW World Television Championship and Francine and The Pitbulls (Pitbull #1 and Pitbull #2) versus Stevie Richards and The Eliminators (John Kronus and Perry Saturn) in a Dog Collar match. The event also featured the ECW return of Brian Pillman. Storylines The event featured wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches played out on ECW's television program Hardcore TV. On the January 30 episode of Hardcore TV, Raven defeated The Sandman to win the World Heavyweight Championship. After the match, Sandman turned face by refusing Woman's offer to jump to World Championship Wrestling (WCW). At Big Apple Blizzard Blast, Stevie Richards and The Blue Meanie offered Sandman to back out of another title match with Raven but Sandman told Richards to warn Raven that he would be coming for the title and then left the ring. Raven would then join the ring and Missy Hyatt came to confront Raven and refused his offer to join him and then Sandman came back and cleared Raven and his group from the ring with a kendo stick. On the February 6 episode of Hardcore TV, it was announced that Raven would defend the title against Sandman in a rematch at CyberSlam. Shane Douglas returned to ECW at House Party after a failed stint in World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and talked about how one needed to kiss Vince McMahon's ass to stay in the WWF. On the January 30 episode of Hardcore TV, Cactus Jack stated that he would prefer to kiss McMahon's ass over kissing Tod Gordon's ass to stay in ECW, thus signalling that he was leaving ECW for WWF. Later that night, Jack and his tag team partner Mikey Whipwreck defeated Douglas and Tommy Dreamer in a tag team match when Jack smashed a chair into Douglas' face. Douglas said that he had received the move purposely to bring the extreme into Jack and a match was made between the two at CyberSlam. At House Party, 911 and Rey Misterio, Jr. defeated The Eliminators (John Kronus and Perry Saturn) in a tag team match. After the match, Eliminators attacked their opponents and nailed Misterio with a Total Elimination. After the match, The Pitbulls (Pitbull #1 and Pitbull #2) and Francine attempted to make the save as 911 brawled with Taz and Eliminators knocked out Francine with a Total Elimination. At Big Apple Blizzard Blast, Eliminators defeated Cactus Jack and Mikey Whipwreck to win the World Tag Team Championship. After the match, Francine told Eliminators that she wanted to manage them but it turned out to be a ruse as she set them up for an attack by Pitbulls, who cut off Saturn's hair. On the January 30 episode of Hardcore TV, Stevie Richards apologized to Francine for abandoning her for Raven by Stevie Kicking her and then asked her if she was pregnant, which embarrassed her and Pitbulls attacked him and then Eliminators made the save by attacking Pitbulls. Later that night, it was announced that Pitbulls and Francine would compete against Eliminators and Richards in a Dog Collar match at CyberSlam. Event Preliminary matches In the opening match of the event, The Bad Crew (Dog and Rose) and Judge Dredd competed against Dino Sendoff, Don E. Allen and The Dirt Bike Kid. Bad Crew hit a Doomsday Device to Allen to win the match. After the match, The Sandman caned all the six competitors. Next, El Puerto Riqueño took on Spiros Greco. Greco hit a shoulder block and a pumphandle suplex to win the match. Next, Taz took on Joel Hartgood. Taz dominated his opponent and made him submit to a Tazmission for the quick victory. After the match, a bunch of wrestlers attempted to aid Hartgood but Taz attacked all of them until Mikey Whipwreck made the save by attacking Taz's manager Bill Alfonso at ringside. Taz followed with a Tazplex to Whipwreck and knocked him out with a Tazmission. Brian Pillman (who used to be known in the company as California Brian), who had recently left World Championship Wrestling, returned to ECW in unusual circumstances. During an interview conducted in the ring by Joey Styles, Pillman insulted Eric Bischoff, calling him a commentator, a \\"gofer\\", and a \\"piece of shit\\". He then turned his attention to the ECW audience, derisively calling them \\"smart marks\\". After Styles attempted to end the interview, Pillman threatened to \\"yank out [his] Johnson\\" and urinate in the ring. Pillman was confronted by ECW owner Tod Gordon, booker Paul Heyman, and wrestler Shane Douglas, who had him removed from the ring by security guards. While being dragged from the arena, Pillman attacked a plant sitting in the audience with a fork he produced from his boot. Pillman's erratic behavior in the ring and backstage caused confusion amongst both members of the audience and his fellow wrestlers. Next, Buh Buh Ray Dudley took on Mr. Hughes. Hughes attacked Dances with Dudley, which led to Big Dick Dudley breaking a crutch over Hughes' back and Buh Buh hit a diving splash for the win. In the following match, The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed) were scheduled to compete against The Headhunters (Headhunter A and Headhunter B) but Jack was not present at the show and Mustafa was confronted by Damien Kane and Lady Alexandra, who offered him a job to shine their shoes and Mustafa said that he wanted a handjob by Alexandra and then he attacked Kane outside the ring until Headhunters came out and attacked Mustafa until The Bruise Brothers (Don and Ron) made the save to wrestle Headhunters in Gangstas' place. Don hit a big boot to a Headhunter for the win. After the match, Tommy Dreamer and Beulah McGillicutty were being interviewed by Joey Styles in the ring on Dreamer's injured shoulder until Raven's Nest showed up and Raven threatened to cut Dreamer's dick off for getting his girlfriend pregnant until Shane Douglas and The Bruise Brothers came to the ring to back up Dreamer. Dreamer told Douglas to leave him and then Douglas took Beulah to the backstage until Bruises turned heels on Dreamer by attacking him and shoving his testicles into the ringpost repeatedly. Next, Axl Rotten took on J.T. Smith. Smith faked injury by intentionally falling from the top rope and pretending it to be an accident. Rotten turned his back and Smith hit Rotten in the back with a steel chair to win the match. After the match, Smith hit a Moonsault on Rotten and continued to attack him after the match until Hack Meyers made the save. Next, Francine and The Pitbulls (Pitbull #1 and Pitbull #2) competed against Stevie Richards and The Eliminators (John Kronus and Perry Saturn) in a Dog Collar match. Pitbulls knocked out both members of Eliminators with superbombs and hit a powerbomb, neckbreaker combination to Richards from the top rope, enabling Francine to pin him for the win. After the match, Eliminators attacked Pitbulls and Francine by laying them out with Total Eliminations. Next, 2 Cold Scorpio defended the World Television Championship against Sabu. After a back and forth match, Sabu eventually hit an Arabian Facebuster to Scorpio and covered him for the pinfall but the thirty-minute time limit expired. As a result, Scorpio retained the title. In the penultimate match, Shane Douglas competed against Cactus Jack. Douglas repeatedly nailed Jack in the head with a chair but Jack refused to quit and called out his tag team partner Mikey Whipwreck for help. Douglas applied a figure four leglock on Jack and Whipwreck turned on Jack by hitting him with a chair and Douglas pinned him for the win. Main event match Raven defended the World Heavyweight Championship against The Sandman. After repeated interference by Raven's Nest, Raven shoved Sandman from the top rope face-first onto a steel chair and hit an Evenflow to retain the title. After the match, The Blue Meanie mocked Sandman and accidentally spilled beer on him to revive Sandman, who then caned Raven's Nest. Reception CyberSlam received positive reviews from critics. Kyle of Wrestling Recaps wrote \\"A huge mix bag tonight, but the good was remembered more in my head than the bad.\\" He appreciated the worked shoot promo of Brian Pillman, the World Television Championship match and Shane Douglas versus Mick Foley match. He further wrote \\"Their was some crappy stuff in the midcard, which is an easy pass, and the mainevent was an epic fail, but I still think there is enough good stuff to give this a solid thumbs up.\\" Scott Keith of Inside Pulse wrote \\"Sabu’s spotty tendencies being reigned in and a good Shane v. Cactus showdown make for an entertaining show overall, although the first hour or so is strictly fast-forward material.\\" The Skinny of Inside Pulse wrote \\"They fit most of the garbage into the first hour. Add in some Taz for violence, some JT Smith for comedy and it’s bearable. The Shane/Foley and Sabu/Scorpio matches are exceptionally good, although the main event was very lack luster.\\" He considered the World Television Championship match to be the match of the night and he further stated \\"While the first hour isn’t that great, the second hour makes up for it with two classics, followed by a quick drunken brawl to close the show\\". Wrestling 20 Years Ago staff gave a score rating of 7 out of 10, writing \\"Pillman debut, Scorpio/Sabu, Douglas – the rest is probably skippable, but as ECW stuff goes these three are both absolutely must see.\\" Aftermath CyberSlam aired in syndication on the February 20, February 27 and March 5 episodes of Hardcore TV. Mikey Whipwreck's betrayal of Cactus Jack led to the two facing each other in Jack's farewell match at Big Ass Extreme Bash on March 9, which Jack won. After the match, Jack hugged Whipwreck and left ECW to join World Wrestling Federation. Raven and The Sandman continued their feud over the World Heavyweight Championship as the two wrestled each other in several matches throughout the year until Sandman finally won the title at Ultimate Jeopardy. 2 Cold Scorpio defended the World Television Championship against Sabu in a rematch at Big Ass Extreme Bash on March 8. The Eliminators and The Pitbulls continued their feud as Pitbulls began pursuing the World Tag Team Championship. The two teams competed in a match for the titles at the Big Ass Extreme Bash show on March 8, where Eliminators retained the titles.

D-Von caned Sandman after the match until his estranged brothers Buh Buh Ray Dudley and Spike Dudley apparently came to make the save until Buh Buh turned heel by attacking Sandman. Spike objected to it but was hit with a 3D, which led to Buh Buh and D-Von forming a tag team The Dudley Boyz. This set up a match between Buh Buh and Spike at CyberSlam. At Crossing the Line Again, The Eliminators defeated Rob Van Dam and Sabu in the main event to retain the World Tag Team Championship, This would lead to title matches between the two teams at CyberSlam. An additional match for Sabu was announced against Chris Candido for CyberSlam on the February 20 episode of Hardcore TV.

Dissension took place between Raven and Richards when Richards missed a flying forearm smash on Dreamer, who ducked it and accidentally hit it to Raven on the apron, sending him into the railing outside the ring. After Raven recovered, Richards tried to make a tag but Raven dropped down on the floor. After preventing a tag again, Raven finally made the tag and Richards nailed Stevie Kicks to Sandman and Dreamer and then turned on Raven by hitting him with a Stevie Kick and walked out on the match, leaving Raven alone.

Next, Tracy Smothers made his ECW debut against Taz. Taz dominated Smothers by executing a T-Bone Tazplex and applied a Tazmission to make him submit. In the penultimate match, Raven and Brian Lee competed against the team of Tommy Dreamer and Terry Funk. The match stipulated that Funk would earn a title shot at Raven's World Heavyweight Championship at Barely Legal should he beat Raven. Funk initially made Raven submit to a spinning toe hold but the referee was distracted in ejecting Lee and Dreamer, so he could not see it and then Lee hit a trashcan to Funk to break the hold. Lee injured Funk by repeatedly hitting him in the face with a trashcan, thus making him bleed and Funk was removed from the match by the medical staff. Stevie Richards showed up along with Lori Fullington and Tyler Fullington and Raven distracted him enough for Brian Lee to hit a Primetime Slam. Raven then nailed an Evenflow to Lori and then Dreamer came back to the ring and charged at Raven but Lee nailed a Primetime Slam to Dreamer. Tyler came back with his father, The Sandman, who substituted for Funk and caned Lee and Raven multiple times and then hit an Evenflow to Raven and pinned him for the win. In the main event, Sabu competed against Chris Candido. Candido attempted a diving headbutt but Sabu blocked it with a chair to Candido's face and nailed a triple jump leg drop to win the match. Reception Reviewing on the February 21 show, Bob Colling of Wrestling Recaps wrote \\"An average show for ECW, but there wasn’t overly awful on the show. The Gangstas stuff was just the usual from them and has its place on the show since it is over with the crowd. The main event delivered a fine bout and the tag match involving Raven, Richards, Sandman and Dreamer was good in advancing an angle. There’s just nothing that makes the show memorable or must-see.\\" Wrestling 20 Years Ago staff rated the event 7 out of 10, writing \\"Sabu/Van Dam vs The Eliminators, the Pitbulls angle, The Dudleys/The Gangstas and the main event are all good or noteworthy.\\" Aftermath Terry Funk would become the number one contender for Raven's World Heavyweight Championship and began feuding with Raven over the title. Funk defeated Raven to win the title at ECW's first-ever pay-per-view event Barely Legal. Shane Douglas and Triple Threat continued their feud with The Pitbulls.

At Hostile City Showdown, The Triple Threat (Shane Douglas, Chris Candido and Lance Storm) competed against Bam Bam Bigelow and Taz in a handicap match, which ended in a no contest when Bigelow turned on Taz while Candido turned on his World Tag Team Championship partner Storm and then Douglas reformed Triple Threat with Bigelow and Candido. In the following weeks, Candido berated Storm in his promos for trying to be in pursuit of his lady Tammy Lynn Sytch, which was the reason of Candido dumping Storm as his tag team partner. A match was made between Candido and Storm at CyberSlam on the February 18 episode of Hardcore TV. On the January 7, 1998 episode of Hardcore TV, Brakkus defeated Paul Diamond and then Lance Wright threw down the WWF flag on Diamond.

Preliminary matches Jerry Lynn competed against Danny Doring in the opening match of the show. Doring attempted a superplex from the top rope but Lynn countered it with a sunset flip powerbomb for the win. Next, Al Snow took on The Full Blooded Italians member Tracy Smothers.

After the match, The Triple Threat (Shane Douglas, Bam Bam Bigelow and Chris Candido) interrupted Joey Styles in the ring and hyped the tag team main event at Living Dangerously.

Lance Storm then came out for his match against Candido. Storm hit a superbomb for the win. Next, Taz defended the World Television Championship against Brakkus. Brakkus overpowered Taz by using his strength and size. Droz brought a table into the ring and Brakkus set it up in the corner but Taz nailed a T-Bone Tazplex to Brakkus through the table.

Dreamer shoved barbed wire into Credible's mouth but the referee saw Dreamer bleed and awarded the win to Credible. After the match, Dreamer attacked Jason by choking him with the barbed wire. The penultimate match was a six-man tag team match between The Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks (Axl Rotten and Balls Mahoney) and The Sandman and The Dudleys (Big Dick, Buh Buh Ray, and D-Von). Spike Dudley and The Gangstanators (John Kronus and New Jack) interfered in the match and joined the match as the third team, continuing it as a three-way dance.

Reception CyberSlam received mostly negative reviews from critics. Arnold Furious of Wrestling Recaps stated \\"Nothing spectacular and the long matches (apart from the main event) sucked.\\" However, he praised the first blood match, the main event match and Lance Storm versus Chris Candido matches as the best three matches of the event. He reviewed on the first blood match \\"If not for anything else but Beulah getting tombstoned.\\" He commented on the Storm/Candido match \\"I would have liked to have seen this feud go a little longer. They always entertained and it was the best feud Candido ever had (IMO). Psychologically strong and Storm lifted Candido’s finisher.\\" According to him, the main event was \\"not the standard of excellence that Rob Van Dam had during most of his ECW run but still the best match on the card.\\" Scott Keith of 411Mania commented on the event \\"Nothing really worth seeing here for non-fans, and I’m sure fans already have it.\\" Aftermath At Living Dangerously, Chris Candido chose Shane Douglas as his tag team partner while Lance Storm revealed that Al Snow would be his mystery tag team partner. Snow pinned Douglas to earn himself a title shot at Douglas' ECW World Heavyweight Championship at Wrestlepalooza.

After the match, Rotten and Mahoney locked Mustafa in the cage and laid him on a table and Jack hit a diving splash to Mustafa from the top of the cage onto the table. Reception Bob Colling of Wrestling Recaps wrote \\"This is a really good show. I’d say six out of the eight matches had entertaining qualities. The show had fast paced contests and a good battle between Douglas/Credible. Also, the segment with Storm and Dreamer was nicely done and advances their feud. This is probably one of the better ECW shows I’ve ever watched and it only took me almost thirteen years to watch. Cyber slam ‘99 gets a thumbs up from me.\\" The Wrestling Revolution staff praised the event, writing \\"This was a very good show from ECW. We got solid action all up and down the card, some big angles in both the Dreamer vs. Storm and Taz vs. Candido feuds, and a big blow-off in the main event.\\" Peter Kent of 411Mania rated it a score of 3, stating \\"This is certainly not an essential show, with no real standout matches. Mostly filler fodder. But Douglas vs Credible was much better than expected and Tajiri/Lynn was really cool\\" James Bullock of Capricorn City wrote \\"There’s some good stuff here, that’s for sure. But nothing here is must-see. The crowd truly did take something away from this show, but you can’t blame them for becoming desensitized. Check it out if you want to, but don’t get your hopes up about seeing something special.\\" Aftermath The matches of the event aired in syndication on the April 8, April 15 and April 22 episodes of Hardcore TV. Shane Douglas and Tommy Dreamer continued their feud with The Impact Players (Lance Storm and Justin Credible) after CyberSlam.

The event took place on November 30, 1997 from the Golden Dome in Monaca, Pennsylvania. Eight professional wrestling matches were contested at the event. In the main event, Shane Douglas defeated Bam Bam Bigelow to win the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. In the penultimate matches, Sabu defeated The Sandman in a Tables & Ladders match and Tommy Dreamer faced Rob Van Dam in a Flag match. Taz and The F.B.I. (Tracy Smothers and Little Guido) successfully defended the World Television Championship and the World Tag Team Championship respectively. Storylines The event featured wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches played out on ECW's television program Hardcore TV. The main rivalry heading into the event was between Bam Bam Bigelow and Shane Douglas for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. Rick Rude had been stalking Douglas and Francine since early 1997 and warned Douglas that he had been training a wrestler to take the title from Douglas. On the October 24 episode of Hardcore TV, Rude revealed Douglas' own Triple Threat teammate Bam Bam Bigelow as his handpicked man, who turned on Triple Threat and proceeded to defeat Douglas for the World Heavyweight Championship. Bigelow defeated Douglas to retain the title at Ultimate Jeopardy. Another rematch was signed between the two for the title at November to Remember. At Barely Legal, Taz defeated Sabu and after the match, Rob Van Dam attacked Taz and Sabu joined RVD in the assault. As a result, both men turned heels and Taz's manager Bill Alfonso became the manager of RVD and Sabu. At Wrestlepalooza, RVD and Sabu turned on ECW by siding with Jerry Lawler in attacking Tommy Dreamer after Dreamer had beaten Raven in a loser leaves town match. This resulted in RVD and Sabu feuding with ECW wrestlers like Dreamer, Taz and The Sandman, which set up a flag match between Dreamer and RVD and a Tables & Ladders match between Sandman and Sabu at November to Remember. Event Before the event aired live on pay-per-view, Chris Chetti and Spike Dudley defeated Erin O'Grady and Paul Diamond. Preliminary matches In the first match, Chris Candido took on Tommy Rogers. After a back and forth action between the two, Lance Storm interfered in the match on Candido's behalf and attacked Rogers and then Jerry Lynn ran in to make the save for Rogers. The referee continued the match as a tag team match pitting Lynn and Rogers against Candido and Storm. Candido hit a Northern Lights suplex to Rogers for the win. Next, Mikey Whipwreck took on the undefeated Justin Credible. After a back and forth action, Jason attempted to interfere on Credible's behalf but Whipwreck countered his interference and nailed a Whippersnapper on Credible to hand Credible, his first loss in ECW. In the following match, Taz defended the World Television Championship against Pitbull #2. Pitbull hit a Powerbomb and a spinning heel kick but Taz dominated him with a series of Taz-plexes and applied a Tazmission to retain the title. After the match, Pitbull #1 tried to attack Taz but Taz overpowered him and issued a challenge to Brakkus but a security guard prevented the confrontation and Taz attacked the guard. The Full Blooded Italians (Tracy Smothers and Little Guido) defended the World Tag Team Championship against The Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley), The Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks (Balls Mahoney and Axl Rotten) and The Gangstanators (New Jack and John Kronus) in a four-way dance. Guido shoved Kronus into a Buh Buh Cutter by Buh Buh, causing the elimination of Gangstanators. Mahoney blinded Buh Buh with a powder, who accidentally nailed the 3D to D-Von, allowing Rotten to pin him to eliminate Dudleys. Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks gained the advantage as Mahoney hit a Nutcracker Suite to Guido but the referee got knocked out in the process. Judge Jeff Jones came out as the replacement referee who counted to two and then began checking on the referee. Mahoney confronted Jones, who kicked him in the groin and then Guido pinned Mahoney with a roll-up to retain the title. In the next match, Tommy Dreamer took on Rob Van Dam in a flag match, in which Dreamer represented ECW and RVD represented WWF. Several referees and wrestlers interfered in the match, resulting in the match being drawn out. Doug Furnas and Phil LaFon interfered on RVD's behalf but Dreamer managed to counter them until Stevie Richards hit a Stevie Kick to Dreamer and then RVD nailed a Five-Star Frog Splash to Dreamer and then he covered Dreamer for the pinfall while Furnas, LaFon and Richards counted to three. The penultimate match of the event was a Tables & Ladders match between The Sandman and Sabu. After a back and forth action between the two, Bill Alfonso distracted Sandman, allowing Sabu to blow a fireball in Sandman's eyes but Sandman ducked it. Sabu managed to gain advantage by hitting a missile dropkick and then he drove Sandman through a table outside the ring with a diving splash from the top of a ladder. Sabu rolled Sandman into the ring and nailed an Arabian Facebuster for the victory. Main event match The main event saw Bam Bam Bigelow defend the World Heavyweight Championship against Shane Douglas. Bigelow dominated Douglas throughout the match by using his strength and size advantage until Douglas drove him through a table with a Powerbomb. Douglas tried to dive onto Bigelow but Bigelow drove him through a table with a Powerbomb. Bigelow then hit a Powerbomb but got a near-fall. Bigelow continued his control until Douglas' Triple Threat teammates Chris Candido and Lance Storm interfered in the match but Bigelow tossed Douglas onto them. Francine's interference backfired as well. Douglas eventually hit a belly-to-belly suplex but could not cover him in time and Bigelow then splashed Douglas in the corner. Bigelow tried to execute a Powerbomb through a table but Douglas countered it into a belly-to-belly suplex through the table to win the title. Reception November to Remember received mixed reviews from critics. TJ Hawke of 411Mania gave it a score rating of 2.5 and called it an \\"awful pay-per-view\\" and added \\"The unintentional comedy of the Sabu/Sandman match absolutely made this whole show worth watching.\\" Wrestling 20 Years Ago staff rated it 5 out of 10 and recommended the final two matches of the event watchable. According to Wrestling Revolution staff, \\"this was a great show from ECW if you fast-forward through the dreck in the middle.\\" Brock Allen of Wrestling DVD Network stated \\"It’s not a terrible show by any means but it’s no classic either. It appeased the PPV providers, still looking for any reason to boot ECW, and sent the local crowd home happy. But for ECW fans around the country this was seen as a letdown. The opener is worth watching and so is the chaos of the “flag match”, but everything else is average, for ECW, at best. As always, if you haven’t seen it it’s worth sitting through at least once.\\" David of Wrestling Recaps wrote \\"Things were rolling along decently and a good main event would have made this a recommendable show. I’ll go with a thumbs in the middle for November To Remember ‘97.\\" Alexander Settee of The History of WWE appreciated the event by stating \\" The undercard here was ok, led by the first two matches being pretty good. From there it kind of fell apart, as the Tag Title match was a mess, RVD/Dreamer had so much going on and no real ending and then we had Sabu/Sandman. If you like the idea of watching guys sloppily hit each other with ladders and go through tables for twenty minutes, then this was your match, but as far as I'm concerned it just sucked. But then the show was saved by that great main event, which I think is absolutely worth tracking down if you haven't seen it. So as bad as Sabu/Sandman was, I still think there's enough good here to call it a Thumbs Up for November to Remember 1997.\\" Aftermath Mikey Whipwreck continued his feud with Justin Credible after November to Remember as Whipwreck defeated Credible in a rematch at Better Than Ever. Full Blooded Italians dropped the World Tag Team Championship to Chris Candido and Lance Storm in a three-way Dance also involving Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks. After losing the World Heavyweight Championship, Bam Bam Bigelow continued his feud with Triple Threat, which had gained Lance Storm as the third member in place of Bigelow.

It was published in 2004. Plot The book depicts Jock Lundie, a fictionalised version of Strachan, and his involvement in the resistance movement against apartheid, starting with the Congress of Democrats then being a bomb-maker for Umkhonto we Sizwe. He describes his involvement as a \\"boys' own armed struggle\\"; one passage depicts a successful demonstration of a home-made bomb to a senior comrade (Yoshke, based on Joe Slovo) by blowing up a beach toilet: Lundie gets arrested and serves three years in prison. He passes the time in solitary constructing a Tiger Moth in his imagination then preparing an aerobatics routine for it. Books are difficult to get and their pages are highly prized for making cigarettes or cannabis joints. As a result many books have pages missing. A former comrade, Themba Max, is executed. Near the end of the book, Lundie is released after being found not guilty in a further trial thanks to the benevolent perjury of his neighbour who gives him an alibi. He moves back in with his wife Jess, gets to know his three-year-old daughter, and ejects his wife's boyfriend from the family home. The book begins and ends with stories about angling for shad, a longstanding passion of Strachan's. Style The book is loosely chronological but there are many diversions into South African history. It is written in South African English, with extensive use of Afrikaans phrases. The book is autobiographical fiction and was based on anecdotes he told. He has described how he tries to use the techniques of painting, such as contrast of texture, in his writing, and has expressed his admiration for the writing style of John Bunyan and Laurence Sterne, and the emotional authenticity of Thomas Hardy and Graham Greene. Reception South African academic Zoë Molver wrote that Make a Skyf, Man! \\"offers a singular take on the Struggle because it entertains the reader rather than attempting to explain or persuade.\\" Michiel Heyns described the language of the book as a \\"pot-pourri of slang, obscenity and invective, interspersed with passages of pure lyricism\\".

Definitions Sampson and Bartusch (1998) defined legal cynicism as \\"\\"anomie\\" about law\\". Based on Sampson & Bartusch's work, and on that of Leo Srole, Piquero et al. (2005) defined it based on respondents' answers to a five-question survey. In the survey, respondents were asked to rank, on a four-point scale, the extent to which they agreed with each of these statements: Causes and correlates Legal cynicism can be exacerbated when police engage in aggressive misconduct in a community, which can lead to greater violence and less cooperation between the community's citizens and the police. It has been found to be higher in neighborhoods with higher levels of concentrated disadvantage, even after controlling for demographic factors and crime rates. The strongest predictor of legal cynicism is self-reported delinquency. Effects Legal cynicism and legitimacy both have significant effects on criminal offending, even after accounting for self-control. Legal cynicism is also associated with lower rates of desistance from intimate partner violence, higher homicide rates, and higher recidivism rates among released prisoners.

It took place on May 11, 1996, in the ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The event marked the culmination of the feud between Rob Van Dam and Sabu, who faced one another in a bout in which the loser was required to shake the winner's hand and declare their respect for them. Van Dam defeated Sabu and subsequently refused to shake Sabu's hand, establishing his cocky persona. Event Before the televised portion of the event, Taz defeated Beef Wellington by forcing him to submit to the Tazmission in a non-televised match. Preliminary matches In the first televised match, Damien took on El Puerto Ricano. The match ended in a no contest after Sabu interfered in the match and attacked both men. Next, Damien Kane and Devon Storm took on The Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley). D-Von hit chair shots to both opponents as well as his own partner and finally the referee, which led to the referee disqualifying Buh Buh and D-Von. In the following match, The F.B.I. (J.T. Smith and Little Guido) took on the team of Axl Rotten and Hack Meyers. Guido blocked a sunset flip attempt by Meyers and grabbed Smith's hand for leverage to pin Meyers for the win. Next, Raven defended the World Heavyweight Championship against The Sandman and Pitbull #2 in a three-way dance. The first elimination occurred when Sandman tried to perform a superplex on Pitbull but Pitbull countered with a superbomb and Raven hit Pitbull with a loaded boot to eliminate him. Raven blocked a suplex attempt by Sandman onto the guardrail and nailed a DDT to Sandman on the rail to retain the title. After the match, Sandman and The Pitbulls attacked The Blue Meanie and Sandman helped Pitbulls in superbombing Meanie and then celebrated with each other. Next, Chris Jericho took on Mikey Whipwreck. Jericho caught Whipwreck from the top rope and delivered a butterfly suplex to Whipwreck from the top rope for the win. Later, 2 Cold Scorpio defended the World Television Championship against Shane Douglas. Near the end of the match, Scorpio climbed the top rope but Douglas tripped him and executed a belly-to-belly suplex from the top rope to retain the title. The final match on the undercard featured Sabu against Rob Van Dam, with the stipulation that the loser would be forced to shake the winner's hand. After a back and forth match, RVD delivered a split-legged moonsault to Sabu for the win. As a result of losing the match, Sabu was required to shake RVD's hand but Sabu was taken away on a stretcher. A few moments later, he came back to the ring to shake RVD's hand but RVD slapped his hand away by uttering \\"not only do I not respect you, you're a piece of shit\\" and left with Taz and Bill Alfonso. Main event match In the main event, Tommy Dreamer and The Gangstas (Mustafa Saed and New Jack) took on Brian Lee and The Eliminators (John Kronus and Perry Saturn). Jack nailed a 187 to Kronus for the win.

It was released by the label RVNG Intl. on 29 October 2013. The album was produced by Gardland based on a deal RVNG Intl. leader Matt Werth made with the duo after he listened to a performance they did on the radio. Recorded in Marrickville over three weeks of improvisational sessions, Syndrome Syndrome is very harsh in tone and has an open-ended style that's unconventional to most electronic music genres. In critical reviews, Syndrome Syndrome was praised for its unique arrangement and sound methods while also being panned for its long length. Production Dave Smith Tempest for making Syndrome Syndrome. RVNG Intl. leader Matt Werth noticed Gardland in late 2012 when the duo were performing with Teengirl Fantasy. Teengirl Fantasy informed Werth about Gardland, and after listening to an improvisational set the duo performed on radio, he emailed them about signing them to RVNG Intl. for an album release. Gardland recorded Syndrome Syndrome in their Marrickville bedroom over the course of three weeks worth of 12-hour improvisational sessions while unemployed. Gardland's initial plan for their first RVNG Intl. record was an extended play based on the radio set. Murray and Smith originally programmed sounds to be used for the EP on their Dave Smith Tempest drum machines. However, three weeks before they were due to submit it for RVNG Intl., someone stole Murray's drum machine and Smith lost his. This forced the duo to buy new Tempest machines and go into a \\"mad, yet fruitful, binge of writing\\" new tracks. Gardland explained that starting over to make new content for the album actually helped them: \\"There was a period of trying to reclaim the sounds we lost - but when we realised that this was a waste of time and decided to focus on making totally new stuff, the material came out thick and fast.\\"Wakefield, Lee (14 November 2013). \\"Introducing: Gardland – \\"It's just you and the machines... and the heat\\". The 405. Retrieved 30 December 2017. The result was a full-length album instead of an extended play as originally planned. About two weeks of the recording of Syndrome Syndrome was spent working on material after the drum machine incident.Korman, Matt (24 September 2013). \\"Syndrome Of Noise – An Interview With Gardland\\". The Bomber Jacket. Retrieved 30 December 2017. The LP's newer material makes up 80 percent of the album and is the record's \\"more exploratory and generally wacked out\\" material, while the content originally written on the duo's lost Tempest machines is the album's calmest tracks. While the Tempests served as the foundation for Gardland producing the record, the JoMoX Xbase09 and MFB-522 were also used to record replications of sounds from the Roland TR-808 and TR-909 as well as slightly reduce the \\"experimental\\" instincts of the duo for a more \\"codified\\" sound palette.Ravens, Chal (15 November 2013). \\"Bodybuilding drugs and a broken leg: How Gardland cooked up the white-hot improvised techno of Syndrome Syndrome\\". Fact. The Vinyl Factory. Retrieved 30 December 2017. Murray explained, \\"Maybe it was a subliminal goal of ours, to create sounds that we hadn’t heard before and to be able to get that away from a purely experimental context and bring it into a club setting.” Composition As the RVNG Intl. press release for Syndrome Syndrome states, the album follows an unconventional and \\"uneasy\\" techno style where beats enter and disappear at unexpected random moments, the \\"harmonic architecture forms cavernous canopies in place of metronomic melodies,\\" and the structure \\"may or may not crumble on contact.\\" This open- ended structure is more akin to RVNG Intl.'s FRKWYS series than the label's regular set of albums. Dummy critic Steph Kretowicz described the LP as exploring the \\"hidden\\" sound art stylings of electronic music, examples including the \\"swinging, manic rhythm and vicious clatter\\" of \\"One on None\\" and the sub bass textures on \\"Success in Circuit.\\" The music of Syndrome Syndrome is very harsh, which reflects the social environment and weather of where Gardland recorded the album. As The 405's Corao Malley analyzed, it contains a couple of tracks which are slightly darker of the album's overall tone, suggesting \\"hints of a different world creep[ing] in from time to time.\\" Murray described making the LP as \\"searching exploration\\" in the places they were in at the time, and Kretowicz, while interviewing Murray for Dummy, described the album as having an \\"earthy feel\\" in its otherwise electronic sound. RVNG Intl. noted the use of human and machine-produced textures on songs like the title track, \\"Katarakt\\" and \\"Hell Flur,\\" stating that they give the music a \\"paradoxical unity\\" and a \\"deranged power.\\" Critical reception Resident Advisor stated Syndrome Syndrome has an \\"unpredictable, wandering spirit\\" that makes it worth listening to its otherwise \\"monochrome\\" sound. XLR8R highlighted the album's use of a false \\"illusion of forward movement\\" on tracks like \\"Magicville\\" and \\"Ode to Ode\\" and praised its use of improvisation with common electronic music formulas. Malley called the LP \\"powerful while rarely tipping over into outright ferocity, which makes its darkness all the more unnerving,\\" also spotlighting its \\"purity of sound that disorients one moment and dazzles the next.\\" The more mixed reviews of Syndrome Syndrome mainly criticized the album's overly long length. Pitchfork writer Nick Neyland criticized Syndrome Syndrome for feeling simply like an experiment with undeveloped concepts rather than an actual album. He noted that some moments of the LP show a \\"stronger sense of design,\\" but it was overall a \\"trying proposition\\" for listeners due to its overly long runtime and a lack of a \\"real sense of purpose.\\" Selim Bulut of Dummy found Syndrome Syndrome not \\"that much fun to listen to end-to-end\\" for its lack of structural variety between tracks and summarized that it's \\"an album that demands a lot of your time with little reward.\\" Track listing Derived from the RVNG Intl. official website.

It took place on May 16, 1998, in the ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Event Preliminary matches The opening match of the event was a two-out-of-three falls match between Jerry Lynn and Justin Credible. Lynn won the first fall by reversing a That's Incredible into a pinfall. In the second fall, Credible nailed a sunset flip powerbomb after knocking Lynn off the top rope and executed a That's Incredible to win the second fall. In the climax of the third fall, Lynn was about to hit a kneeling reverse piledriver to Credible until Jason interfered and Lynn hit a kneeling reverse piledriver to Jason and Chastity hit a hotshot to Lynn, allowing Credible to pin him with a small package for the win. Next, Chris Chetti faced Jamie Dundee. Chetti knocked out Dundee with a side kick and nailed a springboard double jump moonsault for the win. Next, Mikey Whipwreck took on Mike Lozansky. Near the end of the match, Lozansky climbed the top rope to perform a diving splash but Whipwreck countered by hitting a Whipper-Snapper for the win. Next, John Kronus took on Danny Doring. Kronus executed a 450° splash on Doring for the win. After the match, Doring, The Equalizer and Ulf Herman attacked Kronus until Jack Victory and Kronus' tag team partner New Jack made the save and helped clear Lance Wright's sidekicks until Victory hit Jack in the head with a guitar, revealing himself to be Wright's associate. In the following match, The Full Blooded Italians (Little Guido and Tracy Smothers) were scheduled to take on The Blue World Order (The Blue Meanie and Super Nova) but FBI attacked bWo before the match started and then Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks (Axl Rotten and Balls Mahoney) made the save, leading to a match between FBI and the Freaks. Rotten pinned Guido after a double chair shot for the win. Later, Al Snow took on Bam Bam Bigelow. Near the end of the match, Chris Candido distracted Snow by trying to steal Head, which allowed Bigelow to perform a Greetings From Asbury Park on Snow for the win. In the final match on the undercard, Chris Candido teamed up with Sabu to take on Lance Storm and Rob Van Dam. The match ended when Candido turned on Sabu, which led to Sabu and RVD attacking both Candido and Storm and the match ended in a no contest. Main event match The main event was a Stairway to Hell match pitting Spike Dudley, The Sandman and Tommy Dreamer against The Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray Dudley, D-Von Dudley and Big Dick Dudley). After a back and forth match, Sandman hit a DDT to D-Von for the win. Reception A Matter of Respect received mixed to negative reviews. LiveJournal staff gave it a D rating, quoting \\"Absolutely nothing doing here. Not a single match worth going out of your way for, which may explain why no one else has covered this show. Still, nothing actively offensive, so it wasn't XPW level bad.\\" The Wrestling Revolution staff considered it \\"an okay show from ECW\\". They mainly criticized the video quality, citing \\"horrendous, especially from the hardcam, which was so bright that looking at the fans in the first few rows, who were dressed in a multitude of different colors, was painful at times\\" Results References Category:A Matter of Respect Category:1998 in professional wrestling Category:1998 in Pennsylvania Category:May 1998 events in the United States Category:Professional wrestling in Philadelphia Category:Events in Pennsylvania ","title":"A Matter of Respect (1998)"},{"id":"56174091","text":"Georgia Brougham is an English football defender who currently plays for Birmingham City on loan from Everton.

The event took place on November 16, 1996 in the ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This was the biggest ECW show in history at that time and sold out 4 hours in advance, with a legitimate 1,500 fans attending, the largest turnout in company history. The main event was a tag team match, in which Terry Funk and Tommy Dreamer defeated Shane Douglas and Brian Lee. In the penultimate match, The Sandman defended the ECW World Heavyweight Championship against Raven, with Raven bringing Sandman's ex-wife, Lori, and son, Tyler, to ringside. The infighting between The Dudley Brothers saw Buh Buh Ray Dudley defeat his half-brother, D-Von Dudley. November to Remember was notable for the debut of The Blue World Order, a parody of the World Championship Wrestling stable The New World Order. The event also featured the final appearance of 2 Cold Scorpio before he joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), with Scorpio defeating a series of jobbers in \\"loser leaves town\\" matches before being pinned by Louie Spicolli. Storylines The event featured wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches played out on ECW's television program Hardcore TV. On the January 30 episode of Hardcore TV, Raven defeated The Sandman to win the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. Raven retained the title against Sandman in several rematches at CyberSlam, Big Ass Extreme Bash and A Matter of Respect, before Sandman ultimately regained the title at Ultimate Jeopardy, where he and Tommy Dreamer defeated Raven's Nest's members Stevie Richards and Brian Lee in an Ultimate Jeopardy match, which stipulated that Sandman would be caned with a Singapore cane if he lost, Lee would be shaved bald if he got pinned and Raven would lose the World Heavyweight Championship if Richards got pinned. Sandman pinned Richards to win the title. At High Incident, Sandman retained the title against 2 Cold Scorpio and then his son Tyler came to the ring to hug him and set him for Raven to attack him with a Singapore cane and hit a Raven Effect. On the November 5 episode of Hardcore TV, it was announced that Sandman would defend the title against Raven in a rematch at November to Remember. At Fight the Power, Pitbull #2 defeated Shane Douglas to win the ECW World Television Championship, which began a feud between the two over the title. Douglas cost Pitbull #2, the title against Chris Jericho at Hardcore Heaven. At Heat Wave, Douglas defeated Pitbull #2, Jericho and 2 Cold Scorpio in a four-way dance to capture the World Television Championship after The Pitbulls' manager Francine turned on Pitbulls. Douglas and Pitbull #2 continued their feud over the title as Douglas retained the title against Pitbull #2 in a rematch at The Doctor Is In. He then defended the title against Pitbull #2 in another rematch at Ultimate Jeopardy, which ended in a no contest when Douglas blinded him and then crushed Pitbull #1's skull to injure his neck until Tommy Dreamer came to the rescue. Douglas then mocked Pitbull #1's injury at High Incident, which infuriated Pitbull #2 as he attacked Douglas after Douglas retained his title against Cody Michaels but Douglas managed to retreat with Francine. On the November 5 episode of Hardcore TV, it was announced that Pitbull #2 and Douglas would compete in a tag team match at November to Remember with both men picking tag team partners of their choice. Pitbull #2 chose Tommy Dreamer as his tag team partner. Later that night, Brian Lee injured Pitbull #2 by chokeslamming him through a stack of three tables. In the main event, Douglas and Dreamer competed against each other but the match ended in a no contest after Lee hit a Chokeslam to Dreamer. The following week on Hardcore TV, Douglas chose Lee as his tag team partner while Dreamer chose Terry Funk as Pitbull #2's replacement. At The Doctor Is In, The Gangstas (Mustafa Saed and New Jack) defeated The Eliminators (Perry Saturn and John Kronus), The Samoan Gangsta Party (Mack Daddy Kane and Sammy the Silk) and The Bruise Brothers (Don and Ron) in a four-way dance to win the ECW World Tag Team Championship. Gangstas and Eliminators continued their feud over the title as Gangstas retained the title against Eliminators at Natural Born Killaz and Ultimate Jeopardy. On the November 5 episode of Hardcore TV, it was announced that Eliminators would face Rob Van Dam and Sabu at November to Remember, with the winning team earning a title shot at Gangstas later at the event. D-Von Dudley debuted in ECW as the newest member of Dudley Brothers at Massacre on Queens Blvd. After initially aiding Dudleys in their rivalry against The Full Blooded Italians, D-Von began a conflict with the leader of the Dudley family, Big Dick Dudley over control of the family. This would culminate in D-Von turning on Big Dick and Buh Buh Ray Dudley during their match against FBI at Hardcore Heaven as he knocked out all the members of the Dudley family with a steel chair. D-Von began feuding with the Dudleys and both sides interfered in each other's matches and competed in several matches for the next few months. D-Von formed a tag team with Axl Rotten at The Doctor is In, who then joined D-Von in his feud with the Dudleys as the duo lost to Big Dick and Buh Buh Ray at Natural Born Killaz. At Ultimate Jeopardy, D-Von defeated Buh Buh in a singles match. After the match, Big Dick rescued Spike Dudley from Rotten by hitting him with a Moonsault. On the November 5 episode of Hardcore TV, D-Von and Rotten hit Big Dick with a double chair shot, leading to Big Dick attacking D-Von in his locker room and then D-Von got Big Dick arrested at Joel Gertner's suggestion. This led to a rematch between Buh Buh Ray and D-Von at November to Remember. Event Preliminary matches The event kicked off with a promo by Taz, in which he announced that ECW would be producing its first pay-per-view event Barely Legal and warned Paul Heyman that he would take on Sabu at Barely Legal. It was followed by the debut of The Blue World Order (Stevie Richards, The Blue Meanie and Super Nova), with Richards, Meanie ad Nova calling themselves \\"Big Stevie Cool\\", \\"The Blue Guy\\" and \\"Hollywood Nova\\" respectively. After a segment in which they promoted the debut of BWO, Stevie defeated David Tyler Morton Jericho in the opening match of the event by executing a Stevie Kick. In the next match, Axl Rotten took on Hack Meyers. After back and forth action, Rotten executed a double underhook DDT to Meyers on a steel chair for the win. Next, Buh Buh Ray Dudley took on D-Von Dudley. D-Von controlled the earlier part of the match and made Buh Buh bleed. The action spilled to the ringside where both men brawled into the crowd. The action returned where D-Von attempted to nail Buh Buh with a chair but Buh Buh countered and hit a superplex and a Powerbomb, followed by a splash, which D-Von ducked. D-Von then attempted to nail him with a chair but Buh Buh tossed him into the air and hit a Buh Buh Cutter for the win. After the match, Axl Rotten attacked Buh Buh until Spike Dudley made the save. Later, Rob Van Dam and Sabu took on The Eliminators (Perry Saturn and John Kronus) to determine the #1 contenders for the World Tag Team Championship later in the show. Both teams exchanged moves and momentum throughout the match.

Dreamer hit Lee in the head with a television camera and Funk nailed a DDT to Lee for the victory. Reception November to Remember 1996 received a huge positive response from the audiences as it had been the most successful event for ECW at that time in terms of revenue and crowd. However, critics gave mixed reviews to the event. Arnold Furious of 411Mania stated \\"One of those really bad ECW shows where every match was the same shit. Crowd loves the whole thing but I was bored senseless by the repeated garbage spots and lack of variety. Add to that the sheer number of mistakes. This is one of these shows that highlight the kind of constant screw up’s that Sabu would do when he wasn’t feeling terribly motivated. Those tag matches were horrible and there were three tag matches on the same show that followed the exact same ECW “anything goes” formula, which essentially ruined all of them. Aside from a half decent opening match showcasing a younger Kid Kash there really is nothing to see here wrestling wise. Taz is quite entertaining but the thing with Sabu was an ongoing deal so there are other shows that demonstrate that great dynamic they had going on.\\" Wrestling 20 Years Ago staff gave the event a score rating of 6.5 out of 10 and stated \\"The BWO debut was fun, and this show is often solid, but there’s nothing in here that was massively memorable or brilliantly done.\\" Aftermath 2 Cold Scorpio legitimately left ECW after losing the loser leaves town match at November to Remember as he had signed a contract with World Wrestling Federation (WWF), where he debuted the following night at Survivor Series as \\"Flash Funk\\". He returned to ECW after his one- year ban was completed at the 1998 House Party event, where he lost to Taz. Several rivalries from November to Remember continued into ECW's next event Holiday Hell. On the November 26 episode of Hardcore TV, several matches were announced for Holiday Hell including The Sandman defending the title against Raven in a barbed wire match, Shane Douglas and Francine taking on Tommy Dreamer and Beulah McGillicutty and Rob Van Dam facing Taz at the event. The Gangstas and The Eliminators continued their feud over the World Tag Team Championship, culminating in Eliminators finally beating Gangstas to begin their third tag title reign on the January 4, 1997 episode of Hardcore TV. The internal feud between the Dudley family finally concluded at Crossing the Line Again when Buh Buh Ray Dudley turned heel by attacking The Sandman after D-Von Dudley lost a match to Sandman. Buh Buh and D-Von then formed the tag team Dudley Boyz, which would go on to become the most decorated tag team in professional wrestling history.

Event Preliminary matches As the event kicked off, New Jack jumped Jack Victory from behind while Victory was being interviewed. Terry Funk expressed his anger at Tommy Dreamer for not inviting him to the show and choosing him as his mystery partner as Dreamer had done in the past and Dreamer explained that Funk wanted a lighter schedule, so he did not want him to get involved but Funk walked off in anger. The Blue World Order (The Blue Meanie and Super Nova) took on the team of Danny Doring and Amish Roadkill in the first match of the event.

Ulf Herman then brought out Mabel as a guest member of FBI, who attacked Chetti. Spike Dudley made the save for Chetti but got beaten up.

Next, Jerry Lynn took on Lance Storm with Tammy Lynn Sytch as the special guest referee while Mikey Whipwreck was the guest enforcer for the match. Sytch was favouring Lynn.

Storm took advantage by covering Lynn for the pinfall but Sytch counted a slow pinfall count. Storm confronted her and she nailed him with a Whippersnapper and Whipwreck nailed her with a Whippersnapper and then Lynn tried to pin Storm with a small package but Whipwreck turned Storm on top of Lynn and gave a fast count to award the win to Storm.

After a back and forth match between the two teams, Taz applied a Tazmission on Douglas and both men laid down on the mat and then Sabu nailed an Arabian Facebuster to both men and pinned Douglas to win the match. Reception November to Remember received negative reviews from critics. Kevin Pantoja of 411Mania rated a score of 4.5 and called it a poor event and considered it \\"a disappointment of a show\\", with \\"It felt like it wasn’t a special show, mostly due to there being so many tag team matches. The disappointment came from several issues. For one, the main event didn’t deliver. Then, things like the mystery partners and the over focus on shenanigans in an otherwise strong Lynn/Storm match didn’t help. I didn’t see the point of Rogers/Smothers, but was pleasantly surprised by the Tag Title match.\\" David of Wrestling Recaps wrote \\"What’s with all the tag team stuff on this card? Only two one-on-one matches? I never cease to be confused by ECW booking. If you can ignore Sunny’s handiwork, Lance Storm vs. Jerry Lynn is very good, but there’s not much else of note from this pay-per-view. Thumbs down.\\" Aftermath On the November 13 episode of Hardcore TV, Taz confronted Sabu for stealing the win from him at November to Remember and then Shane Douglas came and provoked Taz into attacking and injuring Sabu and offered him a spot in Triple Threat in place of the departed Bam Bam Bigelow, who left ECW for WCW. Taz pretended to be Douglas' ally until he laid down in a match and put Sabu on top of him for the FTW Heavyweight Championship on the December 25 episode of Hardcore TV.

The match was followed by Konnan taking on Jason. The injured Taz came to the ring as the special guest referee. Jason insulted Taz, so he attacked him and Konnan nailed a Splash Mountain to Jason for the win with Taz making a fast pinfall count. Next, Stevie Richards took on El Puerto Riqueño.

After the match, Jason offered Misterio his managerial services which he declined and then hit a spinning heel kick to Misterio due to Jason insulting him and then Eliminators attacked him until 911 made the save by chokeslamming Eliminators. The Sandman and 2 Cold Scorpio defended the World Tag Team Championship against The Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge), with Scorpio's World Television Championship also on the line.

Reception November to Remember largely received positive reviews from critics. Dylan Diot of 411Mania rated the event 7 out of 10, stating \\"This show is widely regarded as one of the best shows in the history of the promotion.\\", with \\"It was a collection of fun ECW brawls but nothing was blow away. However, this show has huge historical significance in the landscape of ECW. We had the return of Sabu from WCW, the heel turn of Taz that gave him the human submission machine gimmick, the early stages of the B.W.O, and the early emergence of future megastars in the sport such as Steve Austin and Rey Mysterio. This is one of ECW's must watch events regardless of the quality, which is solid but nothing spectacular. I say this show is worth a look and is a good example of how hot the company was at the time and how influence they ended up in the landscape of pro wrestling.\\" The heel turn of Taz and his promo after the Bill Alfonso and Tod Gordon's match was considered as a very important angle in the history of ECW and was a huge evolution in Taz's character. Most of the matches were praised by Diot. Arnold Furious of Wrestling Recaps panned the event. He praised the Mexican Death match and the main event tag team match, while criticizing the rest of the matches. He panned the booking style of Tod Gordon. He stated \\"It was the ideas that made ECW so interesting. The wrestling only really kicked in later. So in wrestling terms this show is nothing remarkable. It was great at the time because it was different and innovative but time isn’t kind to it. Recommendation to avoid.\\" Scott Keith of 411Mania wrote \\"Best ECW show ever, and it stacks up against the best shows the Big Two put out in the same timeframe, and pretty much kills them in fact. For those who wondered why people used to swear by ECW so much, this is the show to get to see why. The perfect blend of “sports entertainment”, senseless brawling, high-flying lucha and some decent wrestling to fill in the other spots.\\" Wrestling 20 Years Ago staff gave it a score rating of 8.5 out of 10 and opined that \\"The early action is, if nothing else, brief and there's no bad match from The Eliminators and The Pitbulls onwards. The perfect variety show.\\" Aftermath The feud between Mikey Whipwreck and Steve Austin over the ECW World Heavyweight Championship continued after November to Remember. At December to Dismember, The Sandman defeated Whipwreck and Austin in a three-way dance to win the World Heavyweight Championship. The feud between Tommy Dreamer and Raven continued as the team of Tommy Dreamer, The Public Enemy and The Pitbulls defeated Raven, The Heavenly Bodies, The Eliminators and Stevie Richards in an Ultimate Jeopardy Steel Cage match at December to Dismember.

On the July 9 Hardcore TV, Raven also turned Sandman's son Tyler against him. At A Matter of Respect, Shane Douglas defeated 2 Cold Scorpio to win the World Television Championship. Douglas was scheduled to defend the title against Scorpio at Fight the Power but Scorpio was hospitalized due to fever and then he defeated El Puerto Riqueño, Don E. Allen, Devon Storm and Mikey Whipwreck in a quick succession until he insulted Pitbull #2, who along with a bunch of wrestlers was carrying away the defeated wrestlers. Douglas also insulted Pitbull's valet Francine, who slapped Douglas and he retaliated by hitting her with a belly-to-back suplex. Pitbull then defeated Douglas in an impromptu match to win the title. At Hardcore Heaven, Pitbull #2 lost the title to Chris Jericho. On the June 25 episode of Hardcore TV, it was announced that Jericho would defend the title against former champions 2 Cold Scorpio, Shane Douglas and Pitbull #2 in a four-way dance at Heat Wave.

At Fight the Power, Samoan Gangstas Party (L.A. Smooth and Sammy the Silk) debuted in ECW during The Eliminators' (John Kronus and Perry Saturn) World Tag Team Championship title defense against The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed) by attacking Gangstas and costing them the title shot. Gangstas received a last chance at the titles against Eliminators at Hardcore Heaven, where Samoan Gangsta Party attacked them before the match even started. The Bruise Brothers then substituted for Gangstas and competed against Eliminators in the title match which ended in a no contest after Gangstas came back and attacked both teams. Later at the event, Gangstas attacked Samoan Gangsta Party during their match against Axl Rotten and Hack Meyers followed by Eliminators and Bruise Brothers coming out as well and all four teams began brawling with each other. On the July 9 episode of Hardcore TV, it was announced that Gangstas would face Samoan Gangsta Party in a match at Heat Wave. Event Preliminary matches The opening match was a tag team match in which The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed) took on Samoan Gangstas Party (L.A. Smooth and Sammy the Silk). A brawl broke out between the two teams, resulting in the match ending in a no contest. After the match, Gangstas challenged Eliminators to a match for the titles with The Bruise Brothers and Samoan Gangsta Party in the match as well. This was followed by Damien Kane, who brought out Paul Lauria to compete against Mikey Whipwreck. Whipwreck executed a Franken-Mikey to win the match.

After knocking out Sabu through a table, Eliminators executed a Total Elimination on Whipwreck to retain the titles. Next, The Dudley Brothers (Buh Buh Ray Dudley and Big Dick Dudley) took on The Full Blooded Italians (Little Guido and JT Smith). D-Von Dudley confronted Big Dick and provoked him to fight him, who left to fight Big Dick and Buh Buh was double teamed by FBI. Big Dick came back to the match. D-Von returned with a steel chair and hit everyone with the chair. After repeated interference by Dudleys, FBI, D-Von and Hack Meyers throughout the match, Big Dick nailed Guido with a chair shot to win the match. Tarzan Goto made his ECW debut as he took on Axl Rotten. Goto hit a brainbuster to Rotten on a steel chair for the win. After the match, Taz cut a promo, in which he proclaimed that he choked out many shootfighters and insulted several wrestlers on the ECW roster and choked down interviewer Joey Styles until 911 made the save, who chokeslammed Joel Gertner and Bill Alfonso and then chokeslammed Taz but he recovered quickly and hit a series of Tazplexes before knocking him out with a Tazmission. Next, Chris Jericho defended the World Television Championship against Shane Douglas, 2 Cold Scorpio and Pitbull #2 in a four-way dance. Scorpio hit a Tumbleweed on the defending champion Jericho to eliminate him. Douglas and Pitbull teamed with each other to work on Scorpio and Pitbull hit a superbomb to eliminate Scorpio. Douglas hit a belly-to-belly suplex and then Pitbulls' manager Francine showed up at ringside to seemingly distract Douglas until she kissed him and threw powder into Pitbull's eyes, thus turning on the Pitbulls. Pitbull #1 came out and drove Francine through a table with a superbomb. Near the end of the match, Pitbull #2 missed a spin kick against Douglas in the corner and Douglas hit a belly-to-belly suplex to win the title.

Main event match The team of The Sandman, Terry Gordy and Tommy Dreamer took on Raven's Nest members Raven, Brian Lee and Stevie Richards in a unique triple fight steel cage match for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, which stipulated that Richards instead of defending champion Raven needed to be pinned for the title change. Sandman and Raven fought inside the cage, Dreamer and Lee brawled throughout the arena and Gordy and Richards fought at the Eagle's Nest. Sandman hit a DDT to Raven inside the cage to win the match. However, the title did not change hands as Richards had not been pinned. After the match, Lee choked out Missy Hyatt, Beulah McGillicutty and Kimona Wanalaya. Reception Heat Wave received mixed reviews from critics with most of the critics praising the World Television Championship match. Arnold Furious of Wrestling Recaps wrote \\"One great match and a bunch of decent stuff. It’s a good show. If you’ve not got Path of Destruction (which has the 4-way match on it) then it’s well worth picking up for the TV title match, a decent Sabu match and some other ECW antics. Minor recommendation based on whether or not you’ve seen the TV title match.\\" Wrestling 20 Years Ago staff gave a rating score of 6.5 out of 10, the World Television Championship match was named match of the night and Shane Douglas was named the MVP, stating Heat Wave to be \\"A largely forgettable show, but with a forty-minute title match including Jericho, Douglas and Scorpio; you'd be struggling to put it down any more. There's some good early incarnations of what would soon be household names; the Francine turn shows Heyman's chops for telling a compelling story and it would be a further example of how ECW was easily the most consistent promotion in North America.\\" Crazy Max staff wrote \\"the 4-way Elimination match was just awesome, both the action and all the stuff at the end. The tag title match was also pretty decent and the main event was pretty bloody, which is what you should expect in an ECW cage match. None of the other matches were all that good. Mildly recommended show considering the 4-corner match was good and took up a good chunk of the show.\\" Aftermath Despite pinning Raven at Heat Wave, The Sandman did not win the World Heavyweight Championship due to the unique match stipulation. He continued his feud with Raven's Nest over the next several months. At Ultimate Jeopardy, Sandman and Tommy Dreamer defeated Stevie Richards and Brian Lee in an Ultimate Jeopardy match, which stipulated that each competitor had placed something on the line were they to be pinned. Had Brian Lee been pinned, his head would have been shaved. Had Tommy Dreamer been pinned, his valet Beulah McGillicutty would have been forced to leave ECW. Had Sandman been pinned, he would have been caned. Had Richards been pinned, he would have lost Raven's World Heavyweight Championship. Sandman pinned Richards to capture the title. The feud between The Gangstas, Bruise Brothers, The Eliminators and Samoan Gangsta Party continued as Eliminators defended the titles against Gangstas, Bruise Brothers and Samoan Gangsta Party in a four-way dance at The Doctor Is In, where Gangstas captured the World Tag Team Championship. Shane Douglas and The Pitbulls began a lengthy feud with Douglas and Francine following Francine's betrayal of Pitbulls at Heat Wave. The two sides fought against each other for the next nine months with the rivalry culminating at ECW's first pay-per-view event Barely Legal on April 13, 1997. At The Doctor Is In, Chris Jericho wrestled his final ECW match, in which he lost to 2 Cold Scorpio. After the farewell match, Jericho departed ECW and jumped to World Championship Wrestling (WCW).

The event took place on July 19, 1997 from the ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Storylines The event featured wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches played out on ECW's television program Hardcore TV. Rob Van Dam and Sabu shockingly turned heels at Barely Legal by attacking Taz after Taz had beaten Sabu in a match and Taz's manager Bill Alfonso also turned on him and sided with RVD and Sabu. RVD would betray ECW for World Wrestling Federation (WWF), where he formed an alliance with WWF's color commentator Jerry Lawler, who had been at odds against ECW since the February 24, 1997 episode of Monday Night Raw, where ECW wrestlers got involved and competed in several matches and Lawler berated and insulted ECW and got into an argument with Paul Heyman. At Wrestlepalooza, Tommy Dreamer defeated Raven in a Loser Leaves Town match and then RVD, Sabu and Lawler attacked Dreamer and several ECW wrestlers after the match. Lawler then made appearances on Hardcore TV, where he berated ECW in his derogatory promos and Sabu and RVD became traitors who betrayed ECW by siding with WWF. Dreamer formed an alliance with The Sandman, leading to the two facing RVD and Sabu in a losing effort at Orgy of Violence. ECW color commentator Rick Rude also got involved by speaking against Lawler's actions and insulting him in his promos. This led to a match between both sides at Heat Wave. At Wrestlepalooza, The Eliminators (Perry Saturn and John Kronus) managed to retain the World Tag Team Championship against The Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray and D-Von), despite Saturn's injury. Kronus would then defend the title in handicap matches as he ultimately lost the title to Dudley Boyz in a handicap match on the June 26 episode of Hardcore Heaven. The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed) would then become the contenders for the World Tag Team Championship as they received a title shot against Dudley Boyz at Orgy of Violence, where they failed to win the titles. On the July 17 episode of Hardcore TV, it was announced that Gangstas would receive another rematch against Dudleys at Heat Wave. Event Preliminary matches The opening match of the event was a 3-on-2 handicap match, in which the team of Mikey Whipwreck and Spike Dudley defeated PG-13 (J.C. Ice and Wolfie D) and Jason. In the next match, Axl Rotten defeated Tracey Smothers. Next, John Kronus took on Pablo Marquez. Kronus executed a 450° splash from the top rope to win the match. Later, Chris Chetti and Balls Mahoney competed against The Triple Threat members Chris Candido and Bam Bam Bigelow in a tag team match. Candido pinned Chetti for the victory. Next, Taz defended the World Television Championship against Lance Storm. Taz made Storm submit to a Tazmission to retain the title. In the following match, Terry Funk defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Shane Douglas. Chris Candido and Francine interfered in the match as Francine bit Funk's ears. The referees checked onto Funk but he attacked them and Francine continued to bite it, forcing the referee to disqualify Douglas. As a result, Funk retained the title. The Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) defended the World Tag Team Championship against The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed) in a steel cage match. Buh Buh injured his legs by hitting a Bubba Cutter to New Jack from the top rope and Saed pinned him to win the title. After the match, Big Dick Dudley hit both members of Gangstas with a steel chair. Main event match The ECW representative team of Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman took on Rob Van Dam, Sabu and Jerry Lawler in a steel cage match. Rick Rude came out to compete as Dreamer and Sandman's third partner but he quickly turned on his team by hitting a clothesline to Dreamer which led to Beulah McGillicutty slapping him and Rude tossed her into the cage wall. Rude threw chairs into the cage and then locked the cage with RVD, Sabu and Lawler attacking Dreamer and Sandman inside the cage with the chairs until Taz made the save. RVD and Sabu escaped the cage but Lawler was trapped inside the cage and Taz knocked him out with a Tazmission until Rick Rude and The Triple Threat attacked him and knocked him out and Chris Candido applied Taz's own Tazmission on him. Aftermath Four matches of the event aired with syndication on the July 24, 1997 episode of Hardcore TV. Terry Funk and Shane Douglas continued their feud after Heat Wave over the World Heavyweight Championship. A match had been made between the two for the title at Hardcore Heaven. However, before the event, Funk lost the title to Sabu in a barbed wire match at Born to be Wired. As a result, Sabu defended the title against Funk and Douglas in a three-way dance at Hardcore Heaven. This marked Mustafa Saed's final appearance in ECW as he quietly left the promotion after winning the World Tag Team Championship at Heat Wave. At the Hardcore Heaven pay-per- view event in August, the former champions Dudley Boyz were awarded the titles by default. Tommy Dreamer continued his feud with Jerry Lawler, resulting in Dreamer wrestling Lawler in a match to settle the score at Hardcore Heaven. Chris Candido's application of Tazmission on Taz at Heat Wave evolved into a rivalry between the two, leading to Candido receiving a shot against Taz for the World Television Championship at Hardcore Heaven.

Biography  King was born in Washington, D.C., and had most of her schooling in that city at the Corcoran School of Art, from which she received a medal; her instructors included Eliphalet Frazer Andrews, Ulric Stonewall Jackson Dunbar, and Henry J. Ellicott. She also studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston with Bela Pratt. From this stage of her career she left an account of an attempted visit she paid with her father in 1893 to Winslow Homer at his studio in Prout's Neck, Maine. King remained active in the city of her birth until around 1900, exhibiting her work with the Society of Washington Artists and the Washington Water Color Club. She had moved to New York by 1910, remaining there at least until 1940. In the former year she showed at the National Academy of Design; she appeared in exhibits with the Society of Independent Artists in 1922 and 1932. St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, contains a bronze tablet from Tiffany & Co. to King's design, memorializing Arthur Lawrence, a former rector, which was unveiled in 1912. An 1891 drawing titled Come Along, in pen and ink over graphite on wove paper, was formerly owned by the Corcoran Gallery of Art; at that institution's dissolution, it was acquired by the National Gallery of Art. King also produced a mural for the Gurley Memorial Church in Washington, D.C., and was active as a portraitist. King died in 1947.

The event took place on August 2, 1998 from the Hara Arena in Dayton, Ohio. This was the first edition of Heat Wave to be broadcast on pay-per-view. The event also featured talent from Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) due to partnership between ECW and FMW. Six professional wrestling matches were contested at the event. The main event was a Street Fight in which Tommy Dreamer, The Sandman and Spike Dudley defeated The Dudleys (Buh Buh Ray Dudley, D-Von Dudley and Big Dick Dudley). On the undercard, Taz successfully defended the FTW Heavyweight Championship against Bam Bam Bigelow in a Falls Count Anywhere match and Masato Tanaka defeated Mike Awesome. The event also featured FMW's ace Hayabusa's first and only major wrestling appearance in the United States as he teamed with Jinsei Shinzaki to take on Rob Van Dam and Sabu for the World Tag Team Championship. Storylines The event featured wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches played out on ECW's television program Hardcore TV. At Wrestlepalooza, Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman defeated Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) in a tag team match. On the May 13 episode of Hardcore TV, Dudley Boyz threatened to give violence to Sandman and Dreamer. At It Ain't Seinfeld, The Dudleys (Buh Buh Ray, D-Von and Big Dick) defeated the team of Tommy Dreamer, The Sandman and Spike Dudley in a six-man tag team match. A rematch took place between the two teams on the June 3 episode of Hardcore TV, which ended in a no contest due to outside interference by New Jack and Jack Victory. During the match, Dudley Boyz executed a 3D on Beulah McGillicutty, which infuriated Dreamer and he wanted revenge on Dudleys. The following week on Hardcore TV, Joel Gertner demanded that Dudleys apologize to Beulah for hitting her with a 3D and trying to break her neck and then Dudleys opened an ambulance and insulted McGillicutty by apologizing her in a mock. On the June 17 episode of Hardcore TV, Jack Victory and Dudleys defeated Tommy Dreamer, New Jack, The Sandman and Spike Dudley in a Philadelphia Street Fight. On the June 24 episode of Hardcore TV, Dreamer cut a promo in which he demanded revenge on Dudleys and he was then assaulted by Dudley Boyz until New Jack, Spike Dudley and The Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks (Balls Mahoney and Axl Rotten) made the save. Dudley Boyz continued to insult Beulah McGillicutty on the following week's Hardcore TV, where Dreamer and Sandman brought out FMW's former owner Atsushi Onita as their mystery partner for a match against Dudleys, who eventually turned on Dreamer and Sandman and then New Jack and Spike Dudley made the save for Dreamer and Sandman but Dudleys ended up winning the match, with assistance by Jeff Jones, who made the fast count. On the July 22 episode of Hardcore TV, Buh Buh Ray defeated Dreamer, Sandman defeated D-Von and Big Dick defeated Spike in singles matches, allowing Dudleys to win the singles match series with 2-1 and they were allowed to pick up the stipulation for their scheduled match against Dreamer, Sandman and Spike at Heat Wave. At the end of the show, Dreamer cut an emotional promo on Beulah McGillicutty. Dudleys picked the stipulation to be a Street Fight. At Hostile City Showdown, The Triple Threat (Shane Douglas, Chris Candido and Lance Storm) competed against Bam Bam Bigelow and Taz in a handicap match, which ended in a no contest when Bigelow turned on Taz while Candido turned on his World Tag Team Championship partner Storm and then Douglas reformed Triple Threat with Bigelow and Candido. This led to Taz becoming a rival of Triple Threat. At Living Dangerously, Bam Bam Bigelow defeated Taz to win the World Television Championship. Taz continued his feud with Triple Threat primarily Shane Douglas and repeatedly demanded a title shot at Douglas' World Heavyweight Championship but Douglas suffered an injury and Taz was unable to get the title shot. At Wrestlepalooza, Taz attacked Douglas but was arrested and escorted away by the police. At It Ain't Seinfeld, Taz introduced his new FTW World Heavyweight Championship due to his frustration of not getting a title shot against Douglas and then challenged Douglas to a title vs. title match but was interrupted by Bigelow and Taz proclaimed that Bigelow would be his first victim. The following week on Hardcore TV, Douglas was being interviewed by Joey Styles until Taz interrupted him and revealed a Triple Threat T-shirt and offered to be a member of Triple Threat and protect Douglas if Douglas gave him a title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship. He then shook Douglas' hand but then attacked his arm to further injure it. Taz got involved in several brawls with Bigelow over the next few weeks, leading to Douglas announcing on the July 8 episode of Hardcore TV that Bigelow and Taz would compete in a match at Heat Wave. On the July 22 episode of Hardcore TV, Taz issued an open challenge to any wrestler with Bigelow accepting the challenge and both men brawled with each other until Lance Storm and Chris Candido made the rescue for Bigelow. Chris Candido's betrayal of Lance Storm at Hostile City Showdown evolved into a rivalry between the two partners. Storm defeated Candido in a match at CyberSlam and the feud continued between the two. At Living Dangerously, Storm and his chosen partner Al Snow defeated Candido and Shane Douglas in a tag team match. Despite the ongoing feud with each other, Candido and Storm remained World Tag Team Champions but were at odds with each other. On the July 1 episode of Hardcore TV, Candido and Storm lost the World Tag Team Championship to Rob Van Dam and Sabu. The following week on Hardcore TV, there were signs of dissension between the two when Storm blamed Candido for the title loss while confronting Taz during a promo. On the July 15 episode of Hardcore TV, Storm sat at ringside and let Candido on his own for a tag team match against Blue World Order (Nova and The Blue Meanie) and helped Candido in winning the match after letting Candido wrestle the entire match against bWo by himself. Candido and Storm received a rematch for the World Tag Team Championship on July 22 Hardcore TV, during which Storm turned on Candido by walking out on him. On the July 29 episode of Hardcore TV, Candido's leader Shane Douglas cut a promo and held Storm responsible for Sabu injuring Candido's ear and vowed that Candido would avenge the injury from Storm, leading to a match between the two at Heat Wave. Masato Tanaka from ECW's Japanese partner Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling competed in his first ECW match at Living Dangerously, defeating Doug Furnas. He then made his full-time debut for ECW on the July 1 episode of Hardcore TV by defeating Balls Mahoney. The following week, on Hardcore TV, Mike Awesome returned to ECW, having wrestled last for the company in a losing effort against Louie Spicolli at Crossing the Line Again in 1997. In his return match, Awesome lost to Tanaka and then decided to execute an Awesome Bomb on him through a table, thus beginning a rivalry between the two and a match was set between the two at Heat Wave. On July 29 episode of Hardcore TV, Tanaka teamed with Jerry Lynn to defeat the team of Awesome and Justin Credible in a tag team match. At It Ain't Seinfeld, Jerry Lynn defeated Justin Credible in a match to begin a feud between the two. At A Matter of Respect, Credible defeated Lynn in a two out of three falls match. The feud continued as Lynn defeated Credible in an \\"I Quit\\" match on the June 17 episode of Hardcore TV. On the July 15 episode of Hardcore TV, Credible and Jason defeated Lynn and Pablo Marquez in an elimination tag team match. The feud led to a match between the two at Heat Wave, with their final encounter taking place on the July 29 Hardcore TV, where Lynn and Masato Tanaka defeated Credible and Mike Awesome. Event Pre-show Before the event aired live on pay-per-view, The Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks (Balls Mahoney and Axl Rotten) defeated The F.B.I. (Little Guido and Tracey Smothers). Preliminary matches In the opening match, Justin Credible took on Jerry Lynn. Lynn started the match with a sunset flip and a crossbody for near-falls.

Sytch tripped Storm, allowing Candido to gain advantage over Storm. Storm hit a superkick to make a comeback but Candido countered with a neckbreaker. Storm then suplexed Candido to the outside and then dived onto Candido out of the ring through the ropes. Storm followed with a Superplex and followed with a flying spinning heel kick.

A match was scheduled to take place between New Jack and Jack Victory at the event but was cancelled due to a brawl between the two in the parking lot. Later, Masato Tanaka and Mike Awesome competed in a match. Awesome dominated the match by performing a diving back elbow drop and then caught a flying Tanaka with a belly-to-belly suplex and followed with a diving shoulder block. The action then spilled to the outside where both men brawled at the ringside area until returning to the ring where Awesome delivered an Awesome Bomb to Tanaka followed by an Awesome Splash to get near-falls. Awesome hit Tanaka with a chair three times but Tanaka still managed to get up.

The two returned to the ring where Bigelow hit another powerbomb and then set a table in the ring and drove Taz through the table. He set up the broken table in the corner and attempted to drive Taz into it again but Taz countered by driving Bigelow through the table with a T-Bone Tazplex. They began brawling in the aisle where Bigelow attempted a T-Bone suplex into the crowd but Taz countered that into a tornado DDT. Bigelow walked towards the ring but Taz applied a Tazmission on Bigelow from behind to make him tap out and retain the FTW Championship. Main event match In the main event of the show, Tommy Dreamer, The Sandman and Spike Dudley took on The Dudleys (Buh Buh Ray Dudley, D-Von Dudley and Big Dick Dudley) in a Street Fight.

Buh Buh tried a diving splash on Dreamer onto the ladder but Dreamer moved out of the way and then delivered a Dreamer DDT to Buh Buh through the table for the win. Reception Heat Wave received mixed reviews from critics. Kevin Pantoja of 411Mania rated a score of 8 to the event and called it \\"the best ECW Pay-Per- View of all time\\", with \\"Despite the fact that the last two matches are the worst, they're both entertaining and fun brawls. The undercard featured good wrestling and good brawling. I recommend this as a fun way to spend nearly three hours.\\" Scott Keith of Inside Pulse stated \\"I liked it “live” (on the big screen) for the most part. I got into it a lot, but the half half really, really ruined my enjoyment because I kept waiting for the big spots instead of enjoying the show. I dislike being manipulated like that, especially when I can watch it later in a more objective (and less alcohol influenced) frame of mind and be as disappointed as I was. Thumbs up on the ECW sliding scale that you have to apply given their horrible efforts since Barely Legal, thumbs down if you compare it to a real PPV.\\" David of Wrestling Recaps wrote \\"This show is called ECW’s best more often than any other pay-per-view or pre-PPV-era supercard, but I disagree. It’s a fun ride all the way through, everyone on the card was a good worker at the time (except Big Dick Dudley), and there isn’t one throwaway match, but it doesn’t have any real standout matches. Lynn/Credible is awesome but doesn’t quite hold the show on its back. I think it gets a good wrap for RVD/Sabu/Shinzaki/Hayabusa and Tanaka/Awesome, which were both a lot of fun, but not quite the caliber you might expect from these six names. Also, in terms of ECW storylines at the time, there weren’t many surprises. Everyone knew that Taz and Tommy Dreamer were going to get revenge in their respective feuds and everyone knew that RVD and Sabu wouldn’t job to a pair of imports brought in for one night. Thumbs up, one of the best ECW pay-per-views, but just not THE best.\\" Aftermath Lance Storm continued his rivalry with Chris Candido at Heat Wave as the two squared off in a rematch on the August 12 episode of Hardcore TV, where Storm defeated Candido after fooling him to believe that Tammy Lynn Sytch was bound under a WWF contract and could not be allowed to be at ECW. However, after the match, Joey Styles revealed that Sytch was freed from her WWF contract. Two weeks later, on Hardcore TV, Sytch appeared along with Candido to tell everyone that she would stay in ECW until Storm interrupted them and Candido cleared him from the ring. On the September 5 episode of Hardcore TV, Storm introduced his new valet Tammy Lynn Bytch as an insult to Sytch and then Candido managed to defeat Storm when Sytch pinned him after Sytch ripped off Bytch's clothes. At UltraClash, Candido and Sytch defeated Storm and Bytch in a tag team match to end the feud. The Triple Threat moved on to a feud with Rob Van Dam and Sabu after the event as Taz defended his unrecognized FTW Heavyweight Championship against Sabu and Bam Bam Bigelow in a triple threat match on the August 12 episode of Hardcore TV with Taz retaining the title due to the match ending in a thirty-minute time limit draw. RVD and Sabu ultimately formed an alliance with Taz called New Triple Threat, which feuded with Triple Threat as Shane Douglas recovered from his injury and made a comeback to in-ring competition. After intensely feuding for the next three months, New Triple Threat defeated Triple Threat at November to Remember to end the feud.

Preliminary matches Before the opening match, Danny Doring proposed to on-screen girlfriend and manager, Angelica. In the opening match, Danny Doring and Amish Roadkill competed against Chris Chetti and Nova. Chetti brought Angelica in the ring to dance with him but Nova confronted him and then Angelica accidentally whacked Chetti with her hand. Chetti then nailed her with an Amityville Horror.

Crazy then hit a powerbomb on Guido for the win. In the following match, The Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) defended the World Tag Team Championship against Spike Dudley and Balls Mahoney. Before the match, the Dudleys unleashed an unscripted rant by throwing in insults towards the live audience and profane words. A woman spit at Buh Buh Ray Dudley's face and nearly incited a riot. Mahoney and Spike almost got the victory by nailing an Acid Drop and a Nutcracker Suite respectively and covered for the pinfall but Sign Guy Dudley pulled the referee out of the ring. Dudleys took advantage by attempting a 3D but Spike and Mahoney reversed it into roll-ups on both Dudleys to win the titles. After the match, Dudleys attacked the new champions and powerbombed Spike through a flaming table. New Jack then made his return to ECW and attacked Dudleys with weapons from a shopping cart. Later, Tommy Dreamer cut a promo on ECW's new deal with TNN and said that he would be unable to become a part of the new ECW show on TNN due to his injury. Steve Corino interrupted Dreamer and demanded that Dreamer lay down for him, so he would pin him. Corino attacked Dreamer but Dreamer countered and Francine hit a DDT to Corino and pinned him with Dreamer counting the pinfall. Yoshihiro Tajiri came out and attacked Dreamer and Francine with kicks. He applied a Tarantula on Dreamer until Taz made the save and began the next match in which Taz defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Tajiri. Taz thwarted the interference of Corino, Jack Victory and Rhino and nailed Tajiri through a table with a Tazplex and then applied a Tazmission to Tajiri by wrapping barbed wire around his neck to retain the title. Main event match Rob Van Dam and Jerry Lynn took on The Impact Players (Lance Storm and Justin Credible) in the tag team main event. RVD tried to drive Credible through a table but Sabu interfered and splashed Credible through the table. RVD attempted a Five-Star Frog Splash on Storm but accidentally nailed Lynn with it and Storm crawled on Lynn but got a near-fall. RVD hit a Van Daminator to Storm and Lynn nailed a cradle piledriver for the win. Reception Kevin Pantoja of 411Mania considered it an average event and gave a score rating of 6.5, writing \\"As with most ECW Pay-Per-Views, this flew by. Even with the long Dreamer and Dudley promos, something about ECW shows are just fun. The actual wrestling on the show was solid as well. Guido/Crazy and Lynn/RVD are probably the only two matches worth really checking out, but nothing is outright bad. Hell, even Jazz/Jason isn’t terrible.\\" Scott Keith of 411Mania wrote \\"There was almost an HOUR of interviews and promos, by my count, which is ridiculous. Other than that, a better than average ECW show, if a totally unremarkable one. It lacked the killer match-stealing show from last year, but then ECW is lacking Tanaka and Awesome right now anyway.\\" He further stated \\"Thumbs up, but I doubt people will be able to remember the card two months from now.\\" Arnold Furious of Wrestling Recaps wrote \\"Lots of lovely solid action with the opening and closing tag matches being excellent.\\" According to him, the main event match, the opening tag team match and the Super Crazy versus Little Guido match were the best matches of the show.

At CyberSlam, Justin Credible attacked Tommy Dreamer and challenged him to a match for the World Heavyweight Championship, right after Dreamer had just won the title. Credible ended up defeating Dreamer for the title after Francine turned on Dreamer. At Hardcore Heaven, Credible was scheduled to defend the title against Dreamer and Lance Storm in a three-way dance but threatened to throw down the ECW World Heavyweight Championship belt if Dreamer came to the ring to wrestle him. Credible then defeated Storm in Storm's last ECW match to retain the title. Dreamer hit a Dreamer Driver to Credible after the match. Credible successfully defended the title against Raven on the May 19 episode of ECW on TNN. Two weeks later, Credible attacked Raven with a That's Incredible until Dreamer made the save but was attacked by The Network.

Sandman defeated Kanemura to become the #1 contender for the title. On the June 2 episode of ECW on TNN, Sandman received a title shot against Rhino but the match ended due to interference by The Network, Dusty Rhodes, Yoshihiro Tajiri and Rob Van Dam. This led to a match between Rhino and Sandman for the title at Heat Wave. At Hardcore Heaven, Scotty Anton cost Rob Van Dam, a match against Jerry Lynn. Anton joined The Network and began attacking Network's rivals with his Clapper. On the June 9 episode of ECW on TNN, Anton interfered in a tag team match between Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman and the team of Justin Credible and Rhino until RVD attacked him and helped Dreamer and Sandman in winning the match. On the June 23 episode of ECW on TNN, it was announced that RVD would face Anton at Heat Wave and Cyrus predicted that RVD would receive a Clapper at the event. On the July 14 episode of ECW on TNN, RVD said that he had no respect for Anton and he would introduce him to the Van Terminator during their match. Event Preliminary matches In the opening match of the event, Balls Mahoney took on Sal E. Graziano. Graziano avoided Mahoney's chair shot and hit a chokeslam, an elbow drop and applied a bearhug for the quick victory. Next, Kid Kash, Danny Doring and Roadkill competed against the team of Simon Diamond, C.W. Anderson and Johnny Swinger. Simon and Swinger attempted to hit a Problem Solver on Doring but Kash saved him from the move and Doring executed a Wham, Bam, Thank You Ma'am on Diamond. This allowed Kash to hit a Money Maker on Swinger for the win. Next, Jerry Lynn took on Steve Corino. Jack Victory interfered on Corino's behalf by attempting to throw powder into Lynn but he ducked and the referee was knocked out with it instead. Lynn hit a belly-to-back suplex to Corino but could not pin him due to the referee being knocked out. Corino nailed Lynn with his boot and then Victory hit Lynn with a cowbell, which allowed Corino to get a near-fall on Lynn. Lynn attempted a cradle piledriver but Corino reversed it into a pinfall attempt. A series of near-falls led to Lynn hitting a cradle piledriver for the win. After the match, the injured New Jack came on crutches but was attacked by Da Baldies (Tony DeVito and Angel) until Chris Chetti and Nova made the save for Jack, leading to a match pitting Chetti and Nova against Da Baldies. Nova hit a Third Degree to DeVito followed by Chetti hitting an Amityville Horror on Angel. Nova and Chetti then hit a Tidal Wave on Angel for the win. Next, Yoshihiro Tajiri, Mikey Whipwreck, Little Guido and Psicosis competed in a Four-Way Dance. Whipwreck knocked out all his three opponents with a plancha outside the ring until The Full Blooded Italians interfered in the match and Sal E. Graziano slammed him into the ring post. This allowed Psicosis to hit a Psycho Guillotine to Whipwreck and Guido pinned him for the first elimination. The action continued between the three men as Tajiri nailed a German suplex to Psicosis to eliminate him. After a back and forth action, Tajiri spit mist into Guido and hit a brainbuster on a steel chair for the win. Later, Rhino defended the World Television Championship against The Sandman. Jack Victory and Steve Corino interfered on Rhino's behalf but Spike Dudley thwarted their interference as Dudley caned Victory and then Sandman and Dudley hit a 3D to Corino. Rhino then attempted a Gore on Sandman but he dodged it and Dudley was accidentally knocked out with the Gore. Rhino drove Dudley from the apron onto a table with a Rhino Spike. Sandman then hit Rhino with a cane and attempted a White Russian Legsweep and a Rhino Spike on the guardrail to retain the title. In the penultimate match, Rob Van Dam took on Scotty Anton. Anton took out RVD's leg with a chair shot and then applied a Clapper on RVD. Bill Alfonso distracted Anton, allowing RVD to move out of the Clapper, so Anton applied a Clapper on Anton. RVD hit a Van Daminator and a Five Star Frog Splash and had the match won but then proceeded to debut his new move Van Terminator on Anton for the win. Main event match Prior to the main event, six wrestlers from the Los Angeles-based Xtreme Pro Wrestling promotion, who were given front row tickets by promotion owner Rob Zicari, donned shirts of their promotion, which caught the attention of Tommy Dreamer and ECW security and were promptly ejected. A brawl in the parking lot of the Grand Olympic Auditorium between XPW ring crew and the ECW locker room followed, based on false reporting that Francine had been touched by someone from XPW. This was followed by Justin Credible defending the World Heavyweight Championship against Tommy Dreamer in a Stairway to Hell match. George turned on Dreamer by hugging Francine and then Jazz knocked out both women. Credible then nailed a That's Incredible to Jazz, leaving the brawl to Credible and Dreamer. Credible executed a That's Incredible to Dreamer on the barbed wire to retain the title. Reception Arnold Furious of Wrestling Recaps wrote \\"This is a thumbs in the middle effort. It’s not terrible by any stretch of the imagination but no one match stands out particularly. It’s made memorable by the odd spot but not by any of the matches. There is a lot that needs to be fast-forwarded.\\" Scott Keith of 411Mania wrote \\"Thumbs in the middle, leaning up for some decent action, but the lack of a great match keeps it from going up.\\" Aftermath Rob Van Dam began feuding with Rhino over the World Television Championship since RVD never lost the title and was stripped off the title due to injury. On the September 8 episode of ECW on TNN, Rhino lost the title to Kid Kash due to assistance by RVD. Two weeks later, Rhino defeated Kash to regain the title. At Anarchy Rulz, Rhino defeated RVD to retain the title. On the August 25 episode of ECW on TNN, Jerry Lynn was named the number one contender to Justin Credible's World Heavyweight Championship at Anarchy Rulz due to the event taking place in Lynn's home state of St. Paul, Minnesota. Lynn defeated Credible to capture the title. A tournament was set up for the vacant ECW World Tag Team Championship in August. The Unholy Alliance (Yoshihiro Tajiri and Mikey Whipwreck) won the tournament for the vacant titles on September 1 episode of ECW on TNN.

The event took place on August 17, 1997 at the War Memorial Auditorium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Joey Styles provided commentary for the event. This was the first edition of Hardcore Heaven to be broadcast on pay-per-view and ECW's second ever pay-per-view following Barely Legal in April. Six professional wrestling matches were contested at the event. The main event was a Three-Way Dance for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, in which Shane Douglas defeated defending champion Sabu and Terry Funk to win the title. In the penultimate match, Tommy Dreamer defeated Jerry Lawler in an interpromotional match between ECW and World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Also at the event, Taz and The Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) retained the World Television Championship and the World Tag Team Championship respectively. Event Prelude Before the pay per view was underway, the hip-hop duo, Insane Clown Posse entered the ring to hype up the crowd and endorse Rob Van Dam who also entered the ring. However, Van Dam and Sabu proceeded to attack the rappers. The Sandman, who was a guest at ringside, entered the ring and defended Insane Clown Posse. Before Sandman could land a punch, Van Dam & Sabu assaulted him, causing him to be carried off into an ambulance by medics. Preliminary matches Rick Rude interrupted Joey Styles' opening introduction and brought out Chris Candido for his scheduled match against Taz for the World Television Championship. Tod Gordon banned Rude from ringside due to Rude not being a licensed manager. Taz then came to defend the title against Candido. Candido attempted a Blonde Bombshell on Taz but Taz countered with a Northern Lights Tazplex which knocked both men out until they got up at eight. They exchanged moves until Taz hit a T-Bone Tazplex. Candido countered by powerslamming Taz but turned his back and began posing, allowing Taz to apply a Tazmission on Candido from behind to retain the title. Next, Spike Dudley competed against Bam Bam Bigelow. Dudley managed to hit an Acid Drop early into the match but Bigelow soon gained momentum and dominated Dudley. He tossed him from the ring into the crowd. Bigelow pulled Dudley back into the ring and hit a piledriver and a Bam Bamsault for the win. Next, Al Snow took on Rob Van Dam. Bill Alfonso handed a chair to RVD, who hit a Van Daminator to Snow for the win. The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed) were stripped of the World Tag Team Championship due to Mustafa leaving ECW and The Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) were awarded the title belts, who defended it against PG-13 (J.C. Ice and Wolfie D) in the following match. Dudley Boyz delivered a 3D to Wolfie to retain the titles. In the penultimate match, Tommy Dreamer competed against Jerry Lawler. Rick Rude interfered in the match by hitting Dreamer with a trashcan and Lawler gained a near-fall. Jake Roberts showed up next and hit a short-arm clothesline to Dreamer and then executed a DDT. Lawler extended a handshake to Roberts but Roberts hit a short-arm clothesline to Lawler as well, who fell on top of Dreamer for another near-fall. The action then continued until Tammy Lynn Sytch interfered to attack Dreamer but Beulah McGillicutty countered her interference. Lawler grabbed Beulah and tried to hit a piledriver. Dreamer tried to make the save by attempting a chair shot on Lawler but Lawler used Beulah as a shield, who low blowed Lawler, allowing Dreamer to apply a testicular claw and a DDT for the win. Main event match Sabu defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Terry Funk and Shane Douglas in a three-way dance. The Sandman was taken out by Sabu and Rob Van Dam earlier in the show but came back to the arena on a helicopter and interfered in the main event by shoving Sabu from the top rope. Sandman delivered a Rolling Rock to Sabu onto a ladder, allowing Funk and Douglas to simultaneously pin him to eliminate him. Francine aided Douglas in attacking Funk until Dory Funk, Jr. came to the ring and attacked Douglas and then chased Francine to the backstage. The action continued between Funk and Douglas as Douglas hit a belly-to-belly suplex to win the title. Reception The event received mixed reviews from critics. David of Wrestling Recaps wrote \\"This was ECW’s second pay-per-view, and it is unfortunately noted for having cheap production quality. There’s bad lighting and the crowd sound doesn’t get enough volume in the mix\\" but he considered Hardcore Heaven, a \\"solid show\\" and appreciated the matches, with \\"Dreamer/Lawler is way better than it sounds, the main event is entertaining, Taz/Candido is as good as a 10-minute match gets, and the rest of it isn’t the worst\\" and recommended that ECW \\"should have held the show at the ECW Arena\\". Scott Keith of 411Mania wrote \\"The energy was pretty much there, but the card was so eggreciously bad in booking and setup that it would have taken a Herculean effort to overcome it in the first place\\" and he gave a \\"mild recommendation to avoid\\". TJ Hawke of 411Mania gave a rating of 3 stars, stating it to be a \\"bad show\\", with \\"The only thing the crowd seemed to actively care about was the post-main event brawl. That is not a good sign for the quality of a show. The only match from this show that I would encourage someone to check out is Bam Bam vs. Spike. That was awesome.\\" Jack Stevenson of 411Mania considered it an average event by giving a rating of 5 stars and stated \\"Very little of this was actively bad, but there was nothing really good either\\" and \\"Taz-Candido and RVD-Snow were reasonable\\". He further added \\"Aside from mentioning the horrible crowd, the star ratings really tell the story- bottoming out at *, but peaking at ** ¾. In short, it’s an inoffensive time-waster, but not worth spending money on.\\" Wrestling 20 Years Ago staff rated the event 3 out of 10, writing \\"People in the building seemed to like the show, as did many ECW fans, but this show does not stand up at all well.

At Hostile City Showdown, Sabu defeated Rob Van Dam in their first ever singles match against each other. The match was very well-received by the audience, who gave a standing ovation to both competitors and Sabu helped RVD to get off his feet and offered a handshake but RVD disrespected him by refusing the handshake. The two men fought in a rematch at A Matter of Respect, where RVD defeated Sabu and insulted him after the match. On the June 11 episode of Hardcore TV, it was announced that Sabu would face RVD in a third match at Hardcore Heaven. At Fight the Power, Taz defeated Muay Thai fighter Jason Helton in a shoot fight to get a quick submission victory and then Ultimate Fighting Championship mixed martial artist Paul Varelans made his ECW debut and accepted Taz's open challenge for a fight.

On the June 18 episode of Hardcore TV, it was announced that Gangstas would receive another title shot against Eliminators at Hardcore Heaven, which would be their last chance at the titles. It was also announced on the same episode that Samoan Gangsta Party would make their in-ring debut at the event. Event Preliminary matches In the opening match, Shane Douglas took on Mikey Whipwreck. After a back and forth contest, Douglas executed a belly- to-belly suplex for the win. After the match, Stevie Richards impersonated Baron von Raschke as \\"Baron von Stevie\\" and The Blue Meanie impersonated Goldust as \\"Bluedust\\" in an in-ring interview with Joey Styles. In the next match, The Full Blooded Italians (J.T. Smith and Little Guido) took on The Dudleys (Big Dick Dudley and Buh Buh Ray Dudley). Before the match started, Smith brought out the returning Salvatore Bellomo as the newest member of the F.B.I., who would manage them at ringside. Bellomo's repeated interference resulted in Big Dick carrying him away to the backstage and then D-Von Dudley interrupted the match and hit Guido with a steel chair, thus getting Dudleys disqualified. As Big Dick came back to the ring, D-Von retreated and escaped in a car. Next, Taz took on Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) mixed martial artist Paul Varelans. The referee was distracted enough for Perry Saturn to dropkick Varelans in the back of the head on the top rope, allowing Taz to nail a T-Bone Taz-Plex and he applied a Tazmission to gain a submission victory over Varelans. Next, Raven was scheduled to defend the World Heavyweight Championship against IWA Japan's handpicked wrestler. Before the match, Raven, Stevie Richards and Super Nova mocked The Sandman by bringing out his wife Peaches, who dropped to her knees in front of Raven. Sandman then came and told that he did not care as he had already pimped her out. Raven's challenger was then revealed to be Terry Gordy. The match was filled with interference by Raven's Nest members, The Sandman and Tommy Dreamer. Stevie Richards ultimately hit a Stevie Kick to Gordy, allowing Raven to execute a DDT to retain the title. After the match, Raven's Nest attacked Dreamer and Gordy until Sandman made the save and then Peaches came to the ring and brought out her son Tyler along with her, who claimed that he worshipped Raven and Raven took them to the backstage and Sandman followed them to the backstage. Next, The Eliminators (Perry Saturn and John Kronus) defended the World Tag Team Championship against The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed), in which Gangstas had their last chance for the tag team titles. However, Gangstas were attacked by The Samoan Gangsta Party (Matty Smalls and Sammy the Silk) in the aisle during their entrance to the ring and then the match was thrown out. The Bruise Brothers (Don Bruise and Ron Bruise) joined Samoan Gangsta Party in taking out Gangstas and substituted for Gangstas. However, the match never went underway as Gangstas came back to brawl and four teams brawled with each other at the ringside area. This was followed by Samoan Gangsta Party making their in-ring debut in ECW against Axl Rotten and Hack Meyers. The match ended in a no contest after The Gangstas interfered to attack Samoan Gangsta Party. The Eliminators and Bruise Brothers also joined the brawl and all four teams brawled with each other. Next, Pitbull #2 defended the World Television Championship against Chris Jericho. Shane Douglas came at ringside and grabbed Pitbull's valet Francine. Pitbull tried to make the save with a clothesline to Douglas but Douglas put Francine in place of him. Pitbull #1 came to the ringside and took Francine to the backstage. Jericho hit a hurricanrana from the top rope to Pitbull #2 to win the title. This was followed by the penultimate match, a weapons match between Tommy Dreamer and Brian Lee. Beulah McGillicutty prevented Lee from hitting Dreamer with a cinder block and Lee tried to hit a Primetime Slam to Beulah until Kimona Wanalaya distracted him enough for Beulah to hit him with a frying pan and Dreamer hit him with a stop sign in the head and executed a DDT on the sign to win the match. After the match, Bruise Brothers attacked Dreamer and Lee executed a Primetime Slam to Dreamer through a stack of three tables. The ring collapsed following the match, resulting in the main event being delayed by an hour until it could be repaired. During the interval, Kimona performed a striptease in the Eagle's Nest box to pacify the audience. Main event match Sabu took on Rob Van Dam in their third consecutive singles encounter. After a back and forth match between the two men, Sabu nailed an Arabian Facebuster to win the match. Both men were taken out on stretchers after the match. Reception Hardcore Heaven received mostly positive reviews from critics. Arnold Furious of Wrestling Recaps gave the event a score rating of 8 out of 10 by stating \\"What was one of the greatest hyped shows up to this point in ECW history really just didn’t live up to the hype. It was clear that ECW just wasn’t ready for PPV yet. The ability to build up the shows was there. This show was masterfully built up. You could tell with the build up to this show that ECW was aiming for PPV. The pieces were there for ECW, but with this show it was clear that they still had a bit of developing to do before they hit the big dance. Some of the undercard stuff on this show was total garbage. The Shane vs Mikey match quite possibly could have been the match of the night. The main event matches were decent. The Terry Gordy match was good. The Shoot fight was underwhelming but still wildly interesting considering the behind the scenes stuff behind it. Sabu vs Van Dam was a really good match too. All in all this show was pretty good and had a lot of great moments. Some of the undercard stuff keeps me from giving it anything higher than an 8, but I would still highly recommend this show if your interested or curious about ECW.\\" Crazy Max staff considered it \\"Another awesome ECW Arena show here. Top to bottom great action\\", with \\"The shoot fight delivered in it’s short time but as a whole storyline was really good\\". They further added \\"New TV Champion in Jericho, Dreamer takes a SICK bump and Sabu and Van Dam have another really good match. A must see show!\\" Wrestling 20 Years Ago staff rated it 6.5 out of 10, with \\"The superb TV Title match is a must. The opener is a lot of fun. Despite all the issues detailed above, there is much to credit the main event. You also simply have to make time in your life for the brilliance of Stevie Richards. I wouldn't recommend Taz - Paul Varelans for anything other than morbid fascination however...\\" The Wrestling Revolution staff however gave negative reviews, stating \\"Overall, a very bad show from ECW. Too many short matches, ultra-long schmozzes, and non- match segments just dragging on for WAY too long.\\" Aftermath Raven and The Sandman continued their intense feud as it grew personal due to Raven occupying Sandman's wife and son and turning them against him. On the July 2 episode of Hardcore TV, it was announced that Sandman, Dreamer and Gordy would take on Raven, Lee and Richards in a triple fight steel cage match at Heat Wave, with the World Heavyweight Championship on the line and the title would change hands if Richards would be pinned. At the event, Sandman pinned Raven and not Richards, therefore Raven retained the title. On the June 25 episode of Hardcore TV, it was announced that Chris Jericho would defend the World Television Championship against former champions Shane Douglas, 2 Cold Scorpio and Pitbull #2 in a four-way dance at Heat Wave, where Douglas won the title. A match was made between The Gangstas and Samoan Gangsta Party on the July 9 episode of Hardcore TV, with both teams meeting at Heat Wave where the match ended in a no contest due to constant brawling between both teams. After the match, Gangstas issued a challenge to The Eliminators for the World Tag Team Championship in a match which would also involve Samoan Gangsta Party and The Bruise Brothers. Eliminators accepted the title shot and the match happened at The Doctor is In, where Gangstas won the title. Sabu and Rob Van Dam continued their feud as the two competed in a stretcher match at The Doctor is In, which Sabu won to end the feud.

Eight professional wrestling matches were contested at the event. In the main event, The Gangstas made their in-ring ECW debut against The Public Enemy. The event marked the final appearance of Shane Douglas in ECW as he departed the promotion to join World Wrestling Federation and also marked the debut of The Dudley Brothers, a stable that would ultimately evolve into the tag team The Dudley Boyz. Storylines The event featured wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches played out on ECW's television program Hardcore TV. At Barbed Wire, Hoodies & Chokeslams, The Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge) were scheduled to defend the World Tag Team Championship against The Bad Breed (Axl Rotten and Ian Rotten) but Bill Alfonso prevented the match from taking place due to Bad Breed being forced to disband several months ago. The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed) then debuted in ECW and attacked Public Enemy. This led to a match between the two teams at Hardcore Heaven. Axl Rotten and Ian Rotten had been feuding with each other since the two had lost a match to The Pitbulls (#1 and #2) on the January 17 episode of Hardcore TV, which stipulated that the losing team would be forced to break up. Since Axl had been pinned, Ian attacked him with a chair, resulting in a rivalry between the two former tag team partners. They competed in several matches against each other in which they traded wins, leading to a Taipei Deathmatch between Axl and Ian at Hardcore Heaven. At Hostile City Showdown, The Sandman defeated Shane Douglas to win the World Heavyweight Championship, thus ending Douglas' year-long reign. Cactus Jack was named the number one contender to the title on the April 25 episode of Hardcore TV and Douglas grew jealous of Jack getting the title shot instead of him. Jack received the title shot on the May 9 Hardcore TV, where Douglas' Triple Threat teammates Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko cost him the title shot. Jack and Douglas would then cost each other title shots against Sandman. At Barbed Wire, Hoodies & Chokeslams, Sandman defended the title against Jack in a Barbed Wire match. Jack initially won the title by getting up as Sandman was unable to answer the referee's ten count until Bill Alfonso restarted the match on the ground that a title did not change hands on countouts. Alfonso then screwed Jack by deeming him unable to continue despite Jack not getting unconscious as Sandman was choking him down with barbed wire. This led to Jack getting another title shot against Sandman at Hardcore Heaven. Tommy Dreamer and Raven had been feuding with each other since Raven's ECW debut in early 1995. At Barbed Wire, Hoodies & Chokeslams, Dreamer defeated Luna Vachon's husband and Raven's Nest member Vampire Warrior, who was obsessed with Luna siding with Dreamer. Later the event, Luna lost to Dreamer's estranged girlfriend Beulah McGillicutty after a chair shot by Stevie Richards. After the match, Luna was attacked by Raven's Nest until Dreamer attempted to make the save but he was beaten as well. On June 30, Raven and Stevie Richards defeated Public Enemy to win the World Tag Team Championship, leading to them defending the title against Dreamer and Luna at Hardcore Heaven. Event Preliminary matches As the event kicked off, The Dudley Brothers made their ECW debut as the Dudley members Snot Dudley and Dudley Dudley took on The Pitbulls (#1 and #2), who were seconded by their Raven's Nest teammates Raven, Stevie Richards and Beulah McGillicutty. During the match, Francine - who had debuted the prior month at Barbed Wire, Hoodies & Chokeslams - kissed Richards until Beulah broke it up and began a catfight with Francine. Raven dragged Richards and Francine to the backstage. Pitbulls nailed a superbomb to Snot but were distracted as Raven had been gone. The distraction allowed Dudley Dudley to dive and hit Pitbull #2 in the back of the head and put Snot on top of him for the pinfall victory. Next, Chad Austin and The Broad Street Bully took on Dino Sendoff and Don E. Allen. The match ended in a no contest as 911 interrupted the match and chokeslammed everyone in the match. Next, Hack Meyers took on Big Malley. Malley overpowered Meyers with his strength and size until he missed an elbow drop on Meyers and Meyers pinned him for the win. After the match, Malley attacked Meyers and splashed him many times. In the following match, Taz took on 2 Cold Scorpio. Taz initially won the match by executing a Taz-plex but Scorpio's foot was on the bottom rope during the pinfall, which led to Bill Alfonso coming out and restarting the match. Paul E. Dangerously confronted Alfonso, which distracted Taz enough for Scorpio to hit him with a chair in the back. Dangerously diverted his attention towards the ring and Alfonso hit him with a chair in the back. Scorpio hit a Tumbleweed with a chair beneath on Taz and covered him for the pinfall and Alfonso counted the pinfall, awarding the win to Scorpio. After the match, Shane Douglas came to the ring and cut a promo on leaving ECW for World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Woman came and offered Douglas to join her and The Sandman, to which Douglas replied and insulted Woman who slapped him in the process. Douglas tried to attack her but Sandman made the save and Cactus Jack then made Sandman and Woman retreat. Next, Raven and Stevie Richards defended the World Tag Team Championship against Tommy Dreamer and Luna Vachon. Near the end of the match, Vachon nailed a superplex on Richards and then Beulah McGillicutty threw powder in Vachon's face, allowing Richards to pin her to retain the titles. After the match, The Pitbulls came and Raven ordered them to nail a superbomb to Vachon to which Pitbulls refused and then Raven and Richards humiliated them by shoving apple pie in the face and hitting with chair and then Pitbulls retaliated by attacking Raven and Richards, thus turning faces. Pitbulls attempted a superbomb on Richards until Dudley Brothers made the save. After a brawl, Pitbulls and Dreamer cleared the ring of Raven's Nest. Next, Axl Rotten took on Ian Rotten in a Taipei Death match. Bill Alfonso was appointed the referee by Commissioner Tod Gordon. Alfonso stopped the match after The Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge) and The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed) began brawling at ringside and Alfonso went after them. Gordon let the match continue. Axl delivered a back body drop to Ian on the thumbtacks laid in the ring and hit a big splash for the victory. In the penultimate match, The Sandman defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Cactus Jack. Shane Douglas interfered in the match by nailing a Piledriver on Sandman and then nailed Cactus in the face with a Singapore cane and put Sandman on top of Cactus for the pinfall victory, resulting in Sandman retaining the title. After the match, Tod Gordon fired Douglas from ECW, who retaliated by attacking Gordon until 911 made the save and nailed a Chokeslam on Douglas. Main event matches Public Enemy and The Gangstas competed in the main event of the show. Both members of Public Enemy drove New Jack through two tables each and then Rocco Rock smashed a croquet mallet in the back of Mustafa Saed's head for the win. Reception Hardcore Heaven received negative reviews from critics. Matt Peddycord of Wrestling Recaps gave negative reviews to the event due to the absence of Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko and Chris Benoit, while noting Taz and 2 Cold Scorpio's match as the only watchable match of the event. He gave a \\"thumbs down\\" to the event. Kevin Pantoja of 411Mania rated a score of 2.5 for the event, considering it a very bad event. He stated \\"On the whole, the show itself isn’t very good. Only two matches are pretty good and the rest is pretty much absolute garbage. Then there’s the overly long Shane Douglas promo that kind of kills the mood. I was also disappointed at the ECW crowd, which was less excited than expected.\\" Scott Keith of 411Mania wrote \\"Pretty underwhelming show, although the Raven-Dreamer stuff saves the day again.\\" He then mentioned the absence of Guerrero, Malenko and Benoit, a reason of the event's failure \\"in terms of match quality, with everyone turning up the violence a notch to try to fill the void.\\" The Wrestling Revolution staff wrote \\"A bad show from ECW. It was barely over two hours, but aside from Taz vs. Scorpio and Cactus vs. Sandman, it dragged along painfully. Most of the matches weren’t good, and there was some silly booking. There was some important storyline stuff, so if you want to check it out for that you can, but I still wouldn’t recommend buying this show.\\" Aftermath On the July 4 episode of Hardcore TV, Axl Rotten was named the number one contender to Sandman's World Heavyweight Championship at Heat Wave. Several rivalries from Hardcore Heaven continued into Heat Wave as Taz teamed with Eddie Guerrero to take on 2 Cold Scorpio and Dean Malenko, Public Enemy and The Gangstas competed in a steel cage match, Luna Vachon and Stevie Richards competed in a steel cage match, Hack Meyers faced Val Puccio in a rematch and The Pitbulls teamed with Tommy Dreamer to take on Raven and The Dudley Brothers. Shane Douglas made his last ECW appearance in Hardcore Heaven as he would leave ECW for a stint in World Wrestling Federation. It was short and unsuccessful. Douglas returned to ECW at House Party on January 5, 1996.

Although not airing on pay-per-view, in July 2019 the event was added to the WWE Network, in the ECW pay-per-view section. Storylines The event featured wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches played out on ECW's television program Hardcore TV. At Heat Wave, 911 and Mr. Hughes had multiple confrontations with each other as Hughes attacked him with a steel chair during a match between The Tazmaniac and The Pitbulls (Pitbull #1 and Pitbull #2).

Sandman continued to cane Whipwreck until Cairo and several wrestlers attempted to make the save but failed and then Tommy Dreamer succeeded in making the rescue.

A week later, on Hardcore TV, it was announced that Sandman would face Dreamer in a Singapore Cane match at Hardcore Heaven. Event Preliminary matches In the opening match, Hack Meyers took on Rockin' Rebel. Meyers reversed Rebel's attempt at a belly-to-back suplex into a pinfall for the win.

The event took place on May 16, 1999 at the Mid-Hudson Civic Center in Poughkeepsie, New York. Eight professional wrestling matches took place at the event. The originally supposed main event was a singles match, in which Taz was supposed to defend the World Heavyweight Championship against Chris Candido, with Tazz beating Candido to retain the title in the opening match. In the changed main event, Tazz successfully defended the title against Buh Buh Ray Dudley in a falls count anywhere match. The World Television Championship and the World Tag Team Championship were also successfully defended at the event. Event Before the event aired live on pay-per-view, Skull Von Crush defeated Danny Doring in a non-televised match. Preliminary matches Chris Candido interrupted Joey Styles' introduction and brought out The Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) as his insurance policy for his World Heavyweight Championship match against Taz in the main event. Taz however came to confront Candido and their title match began. Taz took out Dudleys but Candido gained control by powerbombing Taz. Candido missed a diving headbutt, allowing Taz to hit a T-Bone Tazplex and apply a Tazmission to retain the title. After the match, Dudley Boyz hit a 3D to Taz. Dudleys then issued an open challenge to put the titles on the line which was answered by Balls Mahoney. Moments later, Spike Dudley joined Mahoney as his tag team partner. Dudleys were about to hit a 3D on Spike but Mahoney stopped it with chair shots. Joel Gertner got involved by hitting Mahoney with a chair and threw matches at him. Mahoney blasted him with a fireball, which distracted Mahoney enough for Dudleys to hit him with a 3D to retain the titles. Next, Super Crazy competed against Taka Michinoku. Michinoku nailed a Michinoku Driver but was unable to cover Crazy due to a knee injury. Michinoku attempted another Michinoku Driver on Crazy but Crazy countered with a tornado DDT.

Judge Jeff Jones came to confront Credible and brought out Sid Vicious as Douglas' replacement and Credible's opponent. Sid dominated Credible and was about to hit a powerbomb but Jason interfered but sustained a powerbomb by Sid. Credible caned Sid but Sid chokeslammed him. Sid then attempted to hit a powerbomb on Credible but Lance Storm broke it up and Sid chokeslammed him, which disqualified Credible. Credible threw powder in Sid's eyes and then Storm and Credible placed Sid on a table until Sabu showed up to attack Credible and Storm. Sabu placed Credible along with Sid on the table and hit an Air Sabu on the table, with Storm pulling Credible out of it and Sid being driven through the table. Credible and Storm retreated while Sabu and Sid were about to brawl with each other until security separated the two. Sid hit two powerbombs to Judge Jeff Jones in the ring. Main event match Dudley Boyz attacked several wrestlers backstage including Nova, Chris Chetti and Jack Victory as ordered by Joel Gertner, which led to a match between Taz and Dudleys for the World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. D-Von Dudley injured his hand while attacking Chetti, so Buh Buh Ray Dudley challenged Taz for the title. Taz declared it to be a Falls Count Anywhere match. D-Von interfered in the match and Dudley Boyz hit a 3D II to Taz for the near-fall. Dudleys attempted another 3D but Taz countered by hitting a DDT to D-Von and drove Buh Buh through a table with a T-Bone Tazplex. Taz followed by applying a Tazmission on Buh Buh to retain the title. Reception John Molinaro of the SLAM! Sports section of Canadian Online Explorer rated the event 7.5 out of 10 and wrote \\"Heyman was able to pull off a respectable show that was far better than the recent PPV efforts of the WWF and WCW. Heyman, displaying the resiliency that he has become so famous for, delivered a respectable and entertaining show as ECW presented its annual Hardcore Heaven spectacular last night on PPV.\\" Arnold Furious of Wrestling Recaps wrote \\"Started badly and ended badly but was really very good in the middle. Unusual for a PPV to be like that and normally a bad main event will let you down but I consider RVD-Lynn to be the main event so in this case the score isn’t affected.\\" Dylan Diot of 411Mania rated it 6 and wrote \\"ECW was no long a unique and edgy product by this point. WWF had successful incorporated elements of ECW into their product so everything ECW was doing was suddently coming across as a second rate WWF product. They took cheat shots throughout the PPV about what the WWF and WCW was doing while putting on the same overbooked segments and matches that the other two companies that they were making fun on were doing. They had guys like RVD, Lynn, Tajiri, and Taz who were wrestling a totally different style than the other two companies were doing and could have shifted the style and focus of the company to keep them differentiated but chose to stick to their roots which ended up hurting them in the long run. This show was solid with a great RVD/Lynn match and some solid wrestling but you can see the magic of the company was starting to fade.\\" Scott Keith of 411Mania gave negative reviews on the event, citing Chris Candido's quick loss in the opening match, Taz versus Buh Buh Ray Dudley as the main event, Justin Credible's forced push and lack of mentioning Heat Wave and ECW's deal with TNN as the failure of the event.

Early life Alice Lee was born on May 27, 1853, in Westport, New York, the daughter of Colonel Francis L. Lee (1823-1886) and Sarah Mary Anne Wilson. She was the second cousin of Theodore Roosevelt's wife, Alice Hathaway Lee. Lee was educated in Boston, where the family spent the winters. Lee was a supporter of the Progressive movement, and other than Theodore Roosevelt, she was friends with Florence Nightingale, Ralph Waldo Emerson and the family of Amos Bronson Alcott. Career In 1887 Alice Lee purchased Marvin House in Westport and transformed it in a posh hotel. Additional \\"cottages\\" were built and also a boathouse, gardens, tennis and croquet courts, a 6-hole Golf course and the annex on the other side of Main Street. The Westport Inn was demolished in 1966. Alice Lee’s brother, Thomas Lee, built the pipes to bring water from Mountain Spring down to the hotel. He also bottled the water to sold it and later the pipes became the town water supply. Lee sold the property to Harry P. Smith in the early 1900s. Lee assisted the fund-raising efforts for both the Westport Library (1888) and the Cutting Memorial Hall addition (1907). In 1902 Lee moved to San Diego to find a better climate and met the Marston family, already involved in the Progressive movement and through them also Lee joined the movement. In San Diego Lee was a member of First Unitarian Church, Wednesday Club, Civic Committee of the Chamber of Commerce, and other groups for cultural and civic development. She was also President of the San Diego Museum, the Balboa Park Auditorium Association, and the Balboa Park Commission. She was Honorary Director of the Women’s Civic Center and Director of the Natural History Museum. She founded the Open Forum, a group that was devoted to discuss social, political, and international issues. In 1935 the Open Forum was \\"oldest continuous non-legislative forum of free public discussion in the United States\\" and it closed in the 1970s. She campaigned for Franklin Roosevelt in 1932. She represented the California Progressive Party at the National Convention held in Chicago. She led the \\"Save the Beaches\\" campaign which purpose was to open to public beaches in San Diego and which was instrumental to develop the public playground system. Personal life Alice Lee was close friends with both the wife of Grover Cleveland, Frances Folsom Cleveland Preston, and that of Theodore Roosevelt, Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt, and was often a guest at the White House. Theodore Roosevelt and his wife Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt, and Frances Folsom Cleveland Preston were often guests at Lee's San Diego home at 7th Ave. Lee lived together with Katherine Teats from 1902 to 1943, when Lee died. In 1905 they commissioned Hazel Wood Waterman, with the supervision of Irving Gill, to build three residences in San Diego, Alice Lee Residence at 3574 7th Ave, Katherine Teats Cottage at 3560 7th Ave and Alice Lee Cottage at 3578 7th Ave. The compound shared a garden designed by botanist and landscape architect Kate Sessions. Lee and Teats lived in the main house and used the other two for rentals. Teats continued to live at Teats Cottage, a Prairie-style house which Lee granted to her in 1906, until she died in 1952. Lee and Teats is, according to the San Diego Historical Resource Board, \\"one of the first documented domestic partnerships in San Diego\\", being indeed documented living together in various Census records; in the 1930 Census, Lee was Head of Household and Teats was Partner (and not Lodger while often used in such cases). Together they owned various real estate properties in San Diego, and both had an active civic and social life, and they were accepted as a couple. Lee died on February 18, 1943, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she was spending the winter, and is buried at Hillside Cemetery, Westport.

Wrestling 20 Years Ago staff rated the event 7 out of 10, saying \\"An entertaining enough, busy enough show that you'll get your times worth. I'd say seek out the opening 20 minutes, the Raven/Dreamer angle and the Sabu/Richards match if you're looking for specific stuff, but this is a decent show throughout.\\" Results References Category:ECW House Party Category:1996 in Pennsylvania Category:1996 in professional wrestling Category:Professional wrestling in Philadelphia Category:Events in Philadelphia Category:January 1996 events in the United States ","title":"House Party (1996)"},{"id":"56174256","text":"House Party (1998) was the third House Party professional wrestling supercard event produced by Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW).

After his tenure's end, Ford was active in the public sphere, traveling, writing a memoir, and voicing his opinion about contemporary issues within the United States and abroad.  Early activities  The Nixon pardon controversy eventually subsided. Ford's successor, Jimmy Carter, opened his 1977 inaugural address by praising the outgoing President, saying, \\"For myself and for our Nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land.\\" After leaving the White House, the Fords moved to Denver, Colorado. Ford successfully invested in oil with Marvin Davis, which later provided an income for Ford's children. He continued to make appearances at events of historical and ceremonial significance to the nation, such as presidential inaugurals and memorial services. In January 1977, he became the president of Eisenhower Fellowships in Philadelphia, then served as the chairman of its board of trustees from 1980 to 1986.Perrone, Marguerite. \\"Eisenhower Fellowship: A History 1953–2003\\". 2003. Later in 1977, he reluctantly agreed to be interviewed by James M. Naughton, a New York Times journalist who was given the assignment to write the former President's advance obituary, an article that would be updated prior to its eventual publication. In 1979, Ford published his autobiography, A Time to Heal (Harper/Reader's Digest, 454 pages). A review in Foreign Affairs described it as, \\"Serene, unruffled, unpretentious, like the author. This is the shortest and most honest of recent presidential memoirs, but there are no surprises, no deep probings of motives or events. No more here than meets the eye.\\" During the term of office of his successor, Jimmy Carter, Ford received monthly briefs by President Carter's senior staff on international and domestic issues, and was always invited to lunch at the White House whenever he was in Washington, D.C. Their close friendship developed after Carter had left office, with the catalyst being their trip together to the funeral of Anwar el-Sadat in 1981. Until Ford's death, Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, visited the Fords' home frequently. Ford and Carter served as honorary co-chairs of the National Commission on Federal Election Reform in 2001 and of the Continuity of Government Commission in 2002. Like Presidents Carter, George H. W. Bush, and Clinton, Ford was an honorary co-chair of the Council for Excellence in Government, a group dedicated to excellence in government performance, which provides leadership training to top federal employees. He also devoted much time to his love of golf, often playing both privately and in public events with comedian Bob Hope, a longtime friend. In 1977, he shot a hole in one during a Pro-am held in conjunction with the Danny Thomas Memphis Classic at Colonial Country Club in Memphis, Tennessee. He hosted the Jerry Ford Invitational in Vail, Colorado from 1977 to 1996. In 1977, Ford established the Gerald R. Ford Institute of Public Policy at Albion College in Albion, Michigan, to give undergraduates training in public policy. In April 1981, he opened the Gerald R. Ford Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on the north campus of his alma mater, the University of Michigan, followed in September by the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids. In October 1977, Ford traveled to New Jersey to campaign for gubernatorial candidate Raymond Bateman to replace Brendan Byrne as Governor of New Jersey. Ford used his appearances to criticize the policies of both Bryne and President Carter. In August 1980, Ford traveled to Tokyo to participate in a seminar for the twentieth anniversary of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan and meet with Prime Minister of Japan Zenko Suzuki for international discussions.  Presidential politics   1980  Ford considered a run for the Republican nomination in 1980, foregoing numerous opportunities to serve on corporate boards to keep his options open for a rematch with Carter. The 22nd Amendment allowed Ford to run for another term but he would've been ineligible to run again in 1984 if he had won in 1980. Ford attacked Carter's conduct of the SALT II negotiations and foreign policy in the Middle East and Africa. Many have argued that Ford also wanted to exorcise his image as an \\"Accidental President\\" and to win a term in his own right. Ford also believed the more conservative Ronald Reagan would be unable to defeat Carter and would hand the incumbent a second term. Ford was encouraged by his former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger as well as Jim Rhodes of Ohio and Bill Clements of Texas to make the race. On March 15, 1980, Ford announced that he would forgo a run for the Republican nomination, vowing to support the eventual nominee. On July 16, 1980 (day 3 of the 1980 Republican National Convention) Gerald Ford consults with Bob Dole, Howard Baker and Bill Brock before making a decision to ultimately decline the offer to serve as Ronald Reagan's running mate After securing the Republican nomination in 1980, Ronald Reagan considered his former rival Ford as a potential vice-presidential running mate, but negotiations between the Reagan and Ford camps at the Republican National Convention were unsuccessful. Ford conditioned his acceptance on Reagan's agreement to an unprecedented \\"co-presidency\\", giving Ford the power to control key executive branch appointments (such as Kissinger as Secretary of State and Alan Greenspan as Treasury Secretary). After rejecting these terms, Reagan offered the vice-presidential nomination instead to George H. W. Bush.Allen, Richard V. \\"How the Bush Dynasty Almost Wasn't\\" , Hoover Institution, reprinted from the New York Times Magazine, July 30, 2000. Retrieved December 31, 2006. Ford did appear in a campaign commercial for the Reagan-Bush ticket, in which he declared that the country would be \\"better served by a Reagan presidency rather than a continuation of the weak and politically expedient policies of Jimmy Carter\\". On October 8, 1980, Ford said President Nixon's involvement in the general election potentially could negatively impact the Reagan campaign: \\"I think it would have been much more helpful if Mr. Nixon had stayed in the background during this campaign. It would have been much more beneficial to Ronald Reagan.\\" Reflecting on Carter's re-election campaign that year, Ford stated, \\"I sure didn't want Jimmy Carter to be president again in 1980 because I was very sour on his performance as president.\\"  1988  Ford delivered an address at the 1988 Republican National Convention in defense of Vice President Bush against Democratic Party assertions that Bush had been absent in times of significance. In a September speech in Burlington, Vermont, Ford criticized Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis as having ideas without plans for their financing and stated the US would go bankrupt over the proposed healthcare plan of the Dukakis campaign. In October, Ford partnered with Carter to appear in advertisements created by J. Walter Thompson encouraging voter turnout.  1992  At the 1992 Republican National Convention, Ford compared the election cycle to his 1976 loss to Carter and urged attention be paid to electing a Republican Congress: \\"If it's change you want on Nov. 3, my friends, the place to start is not at the White House but in the United States' Capitol. Congress, as every school child knows, has the power of the purse. For nearly 40 years, Democratic majorities have held to the time-tested New Deal formula, tax and tax, spend and spend, elect and elect.\\" In an October 1992 speech to community bankers in Rancho Mirage, Ford stressed the need for the 103rd United States Congress to relieve regulatory burdens on banks and said increased regulations had heightened the cost for institutions.  Middle East  In January and February 1979, the Fords traveled to the Middle East for two weeks, the couple's first time ever traveling to the region. Ford's office announced the trip on January 14. Following the 1981 assassination of Anwar Sadat, Ford stated the sale of AWACS planes to Saudi Arabia had become more important to the stabilizing of the Middle East and said the Reagan administration would be required to strength relations with other Arab countries. He also predicted that the passage of President Reagan's proposal on the Saudi arms package would have a heightened chance of being approved by Congress due to Sadat's death. In October 1981, during a joint interview with Carter, Ford stated that he believed peace could only be achieved in the Middle East with American recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization, breaking with the views espoused by President Reagan. After the 1983 resignation of Menachem Begin as Israeli Prime Minister, Ford told reporters ahead of attending a meeting of the presidential bipartisan commission on Central America that he hoped new leadership would bring about more flexible policies within the Middle East. In April 1984, during a press conference at Fairfield University, Ford charged the personal objectives of Lebanese leaders with hampering with efforts toward achieving peace within the Middle East and stated the Reagan administration was correct in choosing to remove troops from Lebanon. On January 30, 1991, in an address to students of the University of California, Irvine, Ford stated President of Iraq Saddam Hussein should be purged of his position following allied forces prevailing against Iraqi troops as he believed it was \\"in the best interests of the Iraqi people\\". Saddam would remain in his position until the 2003 invasion of Iraq.  Views on successors   Jimmy Carter  On March 23, 1977, during a speech at the Union Club, Ford stated that the Soviet Union was engaging in a buildup that would worsen the chance for an arms accord. Ford's prepared text stated that Paul C. Warnke narrowly being confirmed as President Carter's chief negotiator on arms had been a warning to the Soviet Union on its continued buildup. The following day, Ford returned to Washington and met with President Carter. On June 30, after President Carter announced his decision to cancel the B1 bomber, Ford told newsmen that he disagreed and that Carter was gambling \\"on a cruise missile system that is still in the research and development stage.\\" On August 16, Ford stated his support for the Carter administration's Panama Canal agreement, saying that he was convinced the treaty's approval would be \\"in the national interest of the United States\\" and urged quick approval by the Senate. On October 19, Ford delivered an address to a group of business economists at the Pierre Hotel, calling on the Carter administration to pursue a $20 billion to $25 billion annual tax cut immediately. On February 19, 1978, Ford advocated that Carter invoke the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 to assist with quelling the coal crisis, which he stated would benefit Republicans in the upcoming midterm elections should it persist. On April 6, while attending a Republican Party fundraiser dinner in Los Angeles, Ford stated the national defense program had not been fully funded under the administration of his immediate successor and the consequence had been the encouragement of the expansion of communism through both actual and believed weaknesses within the military. On December 13, during a speech at a luncheon meeting of the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, Ford stated that Congress \\"is just not prepared for crisis management\\" of American foreign policy and sympathized with Carter over troubles pertaining to the economy and other branches of the government. On October 3, 1980, Ford cast blame on Carter for the latter's charges of ineffectiveness on the part of the Federal Reserve Board due to his appointing of most of its members: \\"President Carter, when the going gets tough, will do anything to save his own political skin. This latest action by the president is cowardly.\\" On January 19, 1981, during a speech, Ford stated that he was in favor of the $9 billion being offered by the Carter administration to return the hostages in the Iran hostage crisis and said President-elect Reagan would take the oath of office the following day \\" and inherit a full platter of difficult problems, including runaway stagflation, the dangers of military weakness and dependence on foreign oil.\\"  Ronald Reagan  Following the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, Ford told reporters while appearing at a fundraiser for Thomas Kean that criminals who use firearms should get the death penalty in the event someone is injured with the weapon. On March 23, 1981, Ford met with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to transmit a message on the part of the Reagan administration that the new presidency would not see a departure of the past working relationship between the United States and China. In May 1981, Ford attended a luncheon organized by Peter Pocklington, advocating those attending become involved in politics to ensure Canada adopted free enterprise enabling policies in a similar manner to attempt by President Reagan to cut regulations. On May 12, 1981, Ford called for the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries to work toward avoiding what \\"could be a flash point of an outbreak of military conflict on a broad scale\\" within the Middle East. In August 1981, Ford stated that Reagan's advisors did not tamper anything in their delay to inform the president of the assault by Libyan jets on U.S. fighter planes, furthering that he was not in a position to criticize them and that President Reagan would have been notified were the attack to have been more costly. In September 1981, Ford advised Reagan against succumbing to Wall Street demands and follow his own agenda for the economic policies of the US during an appearance on Good Morning America: \\"He shouldn't let the gurus of Wall Street decide what the economic future of this country is going to be. They are wrong in my opinion.\\" On October 14, Ford stated his disapproval for the House of Representatives voting against the Reagan administration's $8.5 billion Saudi arms package and his support for Reagan's economic policy, stating that Reagan \\"inherited an economic mess from his predecessor, and it needed shock therapy. In six months the economy should be turning upward.\\" On October 20, 1981, Ford stated stopping the Reagan administration's Saudi arms package could have a large negative impact to American relations in the Middle East during a news conference. On November 12, in response to a published story in which Budget Director David Stockman referred to President Reagan's tax cut program as a \\"Trojan horse\\" effort to assist the wealthy, Ford stated that Stockman's inexperience had led him to \\"let his conversation run away.\\" He also asserted that the comments would not hinder President Reagan's economic recovery program, which in his view would be vindicated with the passage of time should Americans approve of it. On December 11, Ford met with President Reagan in the Oval Office for discussions on Libyan threats against the United States and how the latter's administration would counter it. While speaking to reporters afterward, Ford stated that he believed the administration could achieve a balanced budget and \\"should set a goal and say we're going to have a balanced budget in 1983, 1984 or 1985.\\" In January 1982, Ford delivered an address to the Houston Republican Club in which he predicted the economy would see an improvement by the middle of the year in the event that President Reagan honor past pledges and not \\"flip-flop like his predecessors.\\" On February 1, Ford stated that he was in favor of the New Federalism proposal by the Reagan administration and Reaganomics would come into effect soon enough for Republican candidates to be benefited during the midterms that year. On March 24, 1982, Ford offered an endorsement of President Reagan's economic policies while also stating the possibility of Reagan being met with a stalemate by Congress if not willing to compromise while in Washington. On April 1, during an interview in New York City, Ford advocated that the Reagan administration implement the trimming of outlays for major new weapons systems and rejected claims that modest slowdown in nuclear weapon delivery would tamper national security as \\"hogwash\\". Days later, during a speech, Ford stated the Reagan administration would be better suited deterring aggression with \\"a margin of superiority in national security\\" as opposed to President Reagan's proposed arm buildups. In May, while speaking to reporters during his attendance of a Home Builders Association of Maryland political fundraiser, Ford stated his optimism for Congress to arrive at a budget compromise: \\"They muddle around in the Congress, but they always seem to get the job done.\\" In July, while speaking to the Forum Club of Houston, Ford expressed his differences with President Reagan's proposed balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and said the only way to prevent budget deficits was through electing members of Congress that would not be in favor of spending beyond the revenue of the government. In November, while addressing a crowd at Salem State College, Ford stated the only issue Americans were facing was a slow economy that would be reversed eventually and his views that the election would not be repudiation of Reaganomics but that the conclusion would move both parties \\"toward the center.\\" In April 1983, Ford attended a civics lecture and question-and-answer session at Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute of Politics, where he stated his support for the Reagan administration's economic policies and that the US faced the possibility of an economic recovery. In April 1984, while in Farmington, Connecticut, Ford advocated for the withdrawal of United States Attorney General nominee Edwin Meese in the aftermath of criticism leveled at Meese's finances and said that he faced similar trials in the confirmation of nominees during his own presidency. Ford also stated, \\"I think there have been more individuals than I would have liked who have been careless in how they handled certain activities. I don't think anything criminal has been done, but there has been a degree of carelessness which I don't think should be condoned.\\" On June 22, 1985, Ford was among four former western heads of state to voice support for President Reagan's decision to not comply with terrorists in Beirut that were holding American hostages. In an August 6, 1987 interview with David Frost, Ford stated that the Iran-Contra Affair was not as serious as Watergate but that he would not have swapped arms for hostages and overruled his Secretaries of State and Defense.  Bill Clinton  In August 1993, Ford joined President Clinton for golf in Vail, Colorado, Ford telling reporters that he shared similar views with the incumbent president on the North American Free Trade Agreement and would assist in any way he could in securing its passage. On September 14, Ford attended a White House ceremony to promote the North American Free Trade Agreement and warned that not passing NAFTA would guarantee a wave of illegal immigration into the United States: \\"If you defeat Nafta, you have to share the responsibility for increased immigration to the United States, where they want jobs that are presently being held by Americans.\\" After the impeachment of Bill Clinton, Ford and Carter wrote an op-ed for the New York Times calling on the president to be censured in a bipartisan resolution. In April 1999, Ford stated that President Clinton had made mistakes in his response to Kosovo, faulting Clinton for having an only military air campaign and not foreseeing the event. In May 2000, Ford made a joint appearance with Carter and Clinton for support of the Clinton administration's trade deal with China. Health problems Gerald Ford and Roy W.

In October, Ford traveled to Tennessee to help Republican candidates in the state. Ford spent part of that month campaigning for Jon S. Fossel and criticized the record of his opponent Richard L. Ottinger as being indicative of wanting massive spending on the part of the government. He also traveled to Pekin, Illinois to advocate for the re-election of Robert Michel who he stated voting for was administering a medicine for the economy's recovery. By that time, he espoused the view that Republicans would retain control of the Senate while losing some governorships and seats in the House of Representatives. On February 10, 1983, Ford and Carter made a joint appearance at the Ford Presidential Library in their capacities as co-chairmen of a conference on public policy and communications, Ford stating that the complexity of contemporary issues was widening a gap between the President and Americans thanks to media seeking out entertainment and public opinion polls answered by lobbyists that reflect the views espoused by special interest groups.

I worry about the party going down this ultra-conservative line. We ought to learn from the Democrats: when they were running ultra-liberal candidates, they didn't win.\\" In the prelude to the impeachment of President Clinton, Ford conferred with former President Carter and the two agreed to not speak publicly on the controversy, a pact broken by Carter when answering a question from a student at Emory University.

Background Three police-involved deaths in Milwaukee in 1981 have been cited as causes for a general increase in racial tension in the city that year. In December, two Milwaukee Police officers – John Machjewski and Charles Mehlberg – were shot and killed by Robert Lee Collins, an African- American man, while investigating a reported robbery at Alfred's House of Bourbon, a tavern. Following the deaths, Alderman Roy Nabors publicly stated that the shooting might have been motivated by the suspect's fear of the police. Nabors later said his comments had been taken out of context. Event At approximately 8:00 p.m. on December 23, 1981, officers of the 1700-man Milwaukee Police abandoned their posts, citing Nabors' comments as evidence of the disregard they claimed city officials showed for the police. Mayor Henry Maier declared a state of emergency and, in response to a demand from the president of the Milwaukee Professional Police Association that the Milwaukee Common Council hear a list of police grievances before officers would return to work, convened an extraordinary session of the council. Maier also issued a request to bars and taverns in the city to voluntarily agree to close early for the duration of the strike. The first hours of the strike were met with confusion, with some police districts having a single police supervisor as the entire law enforcement presence. In one case, two officers on patrol didn't learn a strike had been called until an hour after it began. During the strike, law enforcement in Milwaukee was provided by a combination of police supervisors who had not joined the walk-out and 200 specially- assigned deputies of the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office. Nonetheless, media reported that at least two police stations appeared to have shut-down with a hand-written sign on the locked doors of the district 7 station reading \\"we are not conducting any business at this time.\\" Police returned to work late on December 24, 1981 – approximately 16 hours after the strike began – after the Milwaukee Common Council agreed to publicly denounce Nabors, as well as to increase police funding. As of 2009, Robert Collins was incarcerated at the Wisconsin Secure Program Facility.

The event took place on August 5, 1995 at the ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Eight professional wrestling matches were contested at the event. The main event was a stretcher match, in which The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed) defeated The Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge). On the undercard, Mikey Whipwreck defeated The Sandman in a Singapore cane match, 2 Cold Scorpio, Dean Malenko and Cactus Jack defeated Eddie Guerrero and The Steiner Brothers (Rick Steiner and Scott Steiner) in a six-man tag team match and Raven, Stevie Richards and The Dudley Brothers (Big Dick Dudley and Dudley Dudley) defeated Tommy Dreamer, Cactus Jack and The Pitbulls (Pitbull #1 and Pitbull #2) in an eight-man tag team match. Storylines The event featured wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches played out on ECW's television program Hardcore TV. The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed) debuted in ECW at Barbed Wire, Hoodies & Chokeslams, where they attacked The Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge). This led to a feud between Public Enemy and Gangstas as both teams exchanged wins at the Hardcore Heaven and Heat Wave events. On the August 1 episode of Hardcore TV, Mikey Whipwreck won a battle royal to earn a title shot at The Sandman's ECW World Heavyweight Championship, which he received later in the main event. Sandman defeated Whipwreck to retain the title and then caned him seven times to injure him despite the referee's constant warnings, leading to a Singapore cane match between Whipwreck and Sandman at Wrestlepalooza. At Hardcore Heaven, The Pitbulls (Pitbull #1 and Pitbull #2) left Raven's Nest by refusing to follow Raven's orders of superbombing Luna Vachon and they attacked their leader Raven instead. Pitbulls formed an alliance with Raven's rival Tommy Dreamer as the two teams defeated Raven and The Dudley Brothers (Snot Dudley and Dudley Dudley) at Heat Wave. On the July 25 episode of Hardcore TV, Raven's Nest attacked Pitbulls after their match until Luna Vachon and Dreamer made the save. At Heat Wave, 2 Cold Scorpio and Dean Malenko defeated Eddie Guerrero and Taz in a tag team match. The two teams faced in a rematch on the July 25 episode of Hardcore TV, which Guerrero and Taz won. However, Taz broke his neck in the process and was put out of action. On the August 1 episode of Hardcore TV, The Steiner Brothers (Rick Steiner and Scott Steiner) made their ECW debut alongside Taz and it was announced that Taz and Steiner Brothers would compete against Scorpio, Malenko and Chris Benoit in a six-man tag team match at Wrestlepalooza. Event Preliminary matches In the opening match, J.T. Smith defeated Hack Meyers. Next, Big Val Puccio defeated Tony Stetson by disqualification. Next, the team of Tommy Dreamer, Cactus Jack and The Pitbulls (Pitbull #1 and Pitbull #2) took on Raven, Stevie Richards and The Dudley Brothers (Big Dick Dudley and Dudley Dudley) in an eight-man tag team match. Dreamer seemed to have the match won when he executed a Piledriver to Raven on a steel chair and then Jack turned heel on him by hitting him with a DDT, enabling Raven to pin Dreamer for the win. This was followed by a six- man tag team match, in which Cactus Jack substituted for Chris Benoit, who had left ECW, as the tag team partner of 2 Cold Scorpio and Dean Malenko against the injured Taz's substitute Eddie Guerrero and the debuting Steiner Brothers (Rick Steiner and Scott Steiner). After a back and forth match, Guerrero attempted to hit a brainbuster to Malenko but Malenko countered with a roll- up, pinning Guerrero to gain the victory. Later, The Sandman competed against Mikey Whipwreck in a Singapore cane match. Whipwreck hit a diving crossbody on Sandman to win the match. After the match, Sandman refused to take the lashes with the cane until the referee warned him to strip him of the World Heavyweight Championship if he did not cooperate and take the lashes. Sandman's valet Woman convinced Sandman to take the lashes until Sandman nailed Whipwreck with the cane shots. The Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge) made the save by attacking Sandman. Main event match Public Enemy took on The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed) in a stretcher match in the main event. The Sandman interfered in the match and attacked Rocco Rock, leading to Gangstas winning the match. After the match, Mikey Whipwreck made the save by caning Sandman with several shots. Aftermath Four matches of the event were later aired in syndication on the August 15 and August 22, 1995 episodes of Hardcore TV. The involvement of The Sandman in Public Enemy's match against The Gangstas resulted in Mikey Whipwreck forming an alliance with Public Enemy to feud with Sandman and The Gangstas. The two teams competed in the titular Gangstas Paradise steel cage match at Gangstas Paradise. The Pitbulls and Raven's Nest continued their rivalry as Raven and Stevie Richards defended the ECW World Tag Team Championship against Pitbulls in a two-out-of-three falls dog collar match at Gangstas Paradise. Cactus Jack's betrayal of Tommy Dreamer led to the two men entering a rivalry against each other which carried on for the next few months, culminating in a tag team match where Dreamer teamed with Terry Funk to take on Jack and Raven at November to Remember. Eddie Guerrero and Dean Malenko continued their feud after the event. On the August 8 episode of Hardcore TV, Guerrero defeated Malenko to capture the ECW World Television Championship. He would lose the title to 2 Cold Scorpio at a live event on August 25.

The event took place on June 7, 1997 in the ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Eight professional wrestling matches were contested at the event. In the main event, The Eliminators defeated The Dudley Boyz to retain the World Tag Team Championship. Other matches on the card featured Sabu versus Taz, Terry Funk versus Chris Candido for the World Heavyweight Championship and Tommy Dreamer pinning Raven for the first time in a Loser Leaves Town match, marking the end of a feud that first began upon Raven's debut in January 1995. Raven subsequently left ECW and joined World Championship Wrestling. Taz defeated Shane Douglas in an impromptu match to win the World Television Championship, ending Douglas' nearly year-long reign. Storylines The event featured wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches played out on ECW's television program Hardcore TV. Tommy Dreamer and Raven were involved in a lengthy feud which began after Raven made his ECW debut on the January 10, 1995 episode of Hardcore TV and continued on-and-off for the next two years. At Barely Legal, Dreamer interfered in Raven's title defense of the World Heavyweight Championship against the #1 contender Terry Funk to counter the interference of Raven's Nest and hit a DDT to Raven, which cost him the title against Funk. On the April 26 episode of Hardcore TV, Raven convinced his former lackey Stevie Richards to reunite for one last time to avenge the loss of the title from Terry Funk and Tommy Dreamer. Dreamer cost Raven, the opportunities to regain the title at Chapter 2 and The Buffalo Invasion. On the May 29 episode of Hardcore TV, it was announced that Dreamer and Raven would compete in a Loser Leaves Town match between the two to end their feud at Wrestlepalooza. At The Buffalo Invasion, Stevie Richards and Raven defeated Terry Funk and Tommy Dreamer in a tag team match when Richards pinned Funk. As a result of pinning the champion Funk, on the May 29 episode of Hardcore TV, it was announced that Richards would receive a title shot against Funk for the World Heavyweight Championship at Wrestlepalooza. However, a week later on Hardcore TV, Joey Styles announced that Richards injured his neck at Buffalo Invasion would be unable to wrestle at the event and would be replaced by Chris Candido as Funk's challenger for the title at Wrestlepalooza. At Barely Legal, The Eliminators defeated The Dudley Boyz to win the World Tag Team Championship. The two teams feuded with each other and competed in several matches for the next few months over the title. On the May 29 episode of Hardcore TV, it was announced that Dudleys would face The Sandman and Balls Mahoney at Wrestlepalooza, with the winning team earning a title shot against Eliminators later at the event. Later that night, Dudleys interfered in a match between Sandman and Mahoney by attacking both men. On May 31, Perry Saturn tore his ACL during a title defense against Dudley Boyz and PG-13 and Saturn was examined to be out of action for a year. At Barely Legal, Taz defeated Sabu in a match and then offered a handshake to Sabu until Rob Van Dam attacked Taz from behind and Sabu joined him in the assault. Taz's manager Bill Alfonso turned on him and sided with Sabu and RVD in the assault, leading to a double turn as Taz turned face and Sabu and RVD turned heels. Sabu and RVD turned on ECW and joined World Wrestling Federation (WWF). At Chapter 2, Taz and Chris Candido defeated RVD and Sabu in a tag team match. On the May 29 episode of Hardcore TV, it was announced that Sabu would be returning to ECW at Wrestlepalooza. The following week on Hardcore TV, it was announced that Sabu would face Taz in their rematch from Barely Legal at the event. At The Buffalo Invasion, Shane Douglas defeated Chris Chetti to retain the World Television Championship This led to a rematch between the two for the title at Wrestlepalooza. Event Preliminary matches In the opening match, Shane Douglas defended the World Television Championship against Chris Chetti. Douglas nailed a belly-to-belly suplex to Chetti to retain the title. Next, The Pitbulls (Pitbull #1 and Pitbull #2) took on The F.B.I. (Little Guido and Tracy Smothers). Pitbulls superbombed Guido to win the match. Next, the makeshift team of The Sandman and Balls Mahoney competed against The Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) to earn a title shot for the World Tag Team Championship later in the show. After a big brawl in the ring, Dudleys nailed a Dudley Death Drop to Mahoney on a steel chair for the win. After the match, Sandman scared the Dudleys away with his Singapore cane. Later, Terry Funk defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Chris Candido. Candido managed a great deal of offence by driving Funk with tables and chairs to work on his neck. He nailed four piledrivers on Funk but Funk still managed to compete. Funk ultimately pinned Candido with a roll- up to retain the title. The following contest was a loser leaves town match between Tommy Dreamer and Raven. Lupus advised Raven not to compete and he left until Dreamer chased him away. Both men brawled at ringside and then the action returned to the ring. Dreamer hit a DDT on Raven for the victory, thus marking the first time in his ECW career and their feud that Dreamer pinned Raven and also marked Dreamer's first win over Raven in their rivalry. As a result of the pre-match stipulation, Raven was forced to leave ECW. After the match, the lights went out and as the lights came back, Rob Van Dam and Sabu attacked Dreamer and then the lights went out and came back only to reveal Jerry Lawler present in the ring, who insulted ECW and challenged various ECW wrestlers to come and beat RVD and Sabu. The Sandman, The Gangstas, Axl Rotten and Nova were all beaten up until Taz made the save and challenged Sabu to a match, which took place then away. Taz applied a Tazmission on Sabu but Sabu turned it into a roll-up to win the match. Taz refused to release the hold until several referees stormed to the ring to try to break it up but he attacked them and applied Tazmissions on referees and Bill Alfonso. This would lead to Shane Douglas coming out and confront Taz. Douglas ordered him to leave the ring but Taz refused and Taz challenged Douglas for the World Television Championship and agreed to leave ECW for thirty days if he did not win the match in under five minutes and then Taz further suggested that he would leave ECW for sixty days if he did not win in under three minutes. Taz applied a Tazmission on Douglas, making him submit to the move to quickly win the World Television Championship. Main event match In the main event, The Eliminators (John Kronus and Perry Saturn) defended the World Tag Team Championship against Dudley Boyz. Saturn was unable to compete due to his torn ACL, forcing Kronus to compete against Dudleys on his own. Saturn eventually got involved and hit a diving elbow drop on D-Von to retain the titles. Reception Wrestling 20 Years Ago staff praised the event, giving it a rating of 7 out of 10 and considering it \\"the best show ECW put together in the year 1997 so far\\" with \\"Every match told a story, featured interesting spots, and, generally, the booking made sense. The only real negative on the card was the layout of the Funk/Candido match, even if the match itself wasn’t so bad.\\" However, The Wrestling Revolution staff stated Wrestlepalooza to be \\"Overall, a complete and total stinker from ECW! Just an atrocious show.\\" Aftermath The feud between The Eliminators and The Dudley Boyz continued for the title after the event. On the June 26 episode of Hardcore TV, John Kronus lost the World Tag Team Championship to Dudleys in a handicap match due to his tag team partner Perry Saturn being injured and unable to compete. Raven legitimately left ECW after losing to Tommy Dreamer and jumped ship to World Championship Wrestling (WCW). After a mid-card stint in WCW, Raven returned to ECW two years later on the September 3, 1999 episode of ECW on TNN. Shane Douglas and Taz began a lengthy feud with each other which continued after Douglas entered the World Heavyweight Championship picture and eventually won the title. Their rivalry culminated at the Guilty as Charged event in 1999. Rob Van Dam and Sabu's allegiance with WWF's Jerry Lawler at Wrestlepalooza led to Tommy Dreamer joining forces with The Sandman to represent ECW against the traitors and they engaged in a lengthy feud with RVD, Sabu and Lawler that would continue throughout the rest of the year, with their first major encounter taking place at Orgy of Violence where Dreamer and Sandman took on Sabu and RVD in a tag team match. At Heat Wave, Dreamer and Sandman teamed with color commentator Rick Rude to take on RVD, Sabu and Lawler in a steel cage match which ended in a no contest after Rude turned on Dreamer and Sandman.

The event took place on May 3, 1998 in the Cobb County Civic Center in Marietta, Georgia. Joey Styles provided commentary for the event. Seven professional wrestling matches were contested at the event. In the main event, Shane Douglas defeated Al Snow to retain the World Heavyweight Championship in Snow's farewell match in ECW as he departed the company after the event to jump to World Wrestling Federation (WWF). On the undercard, Rob Van Dam successfully defended the World Television Championship against Sabu in a match that ended in a thirty-minute time limit draw and Chris Candido and Lance Storm successfully defended the World Tag Team Championship against The Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks (Balls Mahoney and Axl Rotten). Storylines The event featured wrestlers from pre- existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches played out on ECW's television program Hardcore TV. At Living Dangerously, Al Snow and Lance Storm defeated Shane Douglas and Chris Candido when Snow pinned Douglas. As a result of pinning Douglas, Snow was named the number one contender for Douglas' World Heavyweight Championship on the March 11 episode of Hardcore TV. At Living Dangerously, Bam Bam Bigelow defeated Taz to win the World Television Championship. On the March 25 episode of Hardcore TV, Sabu was named the number one contender to Bigelow's title at Wrestlepalooza. Later that night, Sabu cost his tag team partner Rob Van Dam, a match against Al Snow, which resulted in Sabu and RVD nearly coming to blows. RVD planned to soften up Bigelow for Sabu but ended up defeating Bigelow for the title on the April 8 Hardcore TV. Following RVD's title win, Paul Heyman announced that Sabu would receive his title shot against new champion RVD at Wrestlepalooza. The following week on Hardcore TV, RVD won a match by competing in a drag as Sabu to mock him but Sabu did not take it lightly. A week later, RVD threw in the towel for Sabu during Sabu's match against Al Snow, thus costing Sabu the match despite Sabu having the match in control. The two men subsequently brawled with each other. Mikey Whipwreck ended Justin Credible's undefeated streak in ECW at November to Remember and Credible retaliated by injuring his leg. At Living Dangerously, Whipwreck returned to ECW from injury and cost Credible, a match against Tommy Dreamer. Whipwreck cost Credible a rematch against Dreamer on the March 18 episode of Hardcore TV, resulting in Credible attacking Dreamer and Whipwreck after the match. On the April 8 Hardcore TV, Credible defeated Whipwreck in a match. This led to a match between the two at Wrestlepalooza. On the April 15 episode of Hardcore TV, The Bushwhackers debuted in ECW as the newest members of The Dudleys, leading to The Sandman and Tommy Dreamer coming to the ring with weapons to assault them. Sandman and Dreamer were set up for an attack by The Dudley Boyz. Dudleys attacked Sandman and Dreamer with chairs and kendo sticks and Sandman was carried away on a stretcher. This would lead to a match between the two teams at Wrestlepalooza. On the April 29 episode of Hardcore TV, a match was made between New Jack and Bam Bam Bigelow at Wrestlepalooza. Event Preliminary matches In the opening match of the event, The bWo (The Blue Meanie and Super Nova) took on The F.B.I. (Little Guido and Tracy Smothers). Meanie attempted to execute a Meaniesault on Guido but Tommy Rich distracted him, allowing Guido to avoid the Meaniesault and then Guido hit him with the Italian flag, allowing Nova to hit a Novacaine on Guido for the win. Next, Mikey Whipwreck took on Justin Credible. Whipwreck finished off the interfering Jason with a Whippersnapper and then Chastity interfered but Whipwreck hit her too with a Whippersnapper from the top rope. Credible got a chair and attempted to hit Whipwreck with it but Whipwreck pulled him to hit a kneeling reverse piledriver but Credible reversed it by hitting a That's Incredible on the chair to win the match. Next, the unlikely tag team partners Chris Candido and Lance Storm defended the World Tag Team Championship against The Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks (Balls Mahoney and Axl Rotten). Mahoney nearly won the match when he executed a Nutcracker Suite to Candido but then grabbed a chair instead of pinning Candido, allowing Storm to hit a springboard dropkick to the chair into Mahoney's face and covered him for the pinfall but Candido broke it and covered Mahoney to retain the titles. After the match, a tribute was paid to many Southern wrestling stars including Junkyard Dog, Bob Armstrong, Dick Slater, and the Masked Superstar, who appeared at the event. JYD's appearance at Wrestlepalooza would be his final appearance on national television before his death in a car accident a month later. Later, New Jack competed against Bam Bam Bigelow. Jack smashed a guitar on Bigelow's head to make him bleed but Bigelow still managed to hit a Greetings From Asbury Park to win the match. Next, Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman took on The Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley). Sandman was taken out earlier in the match when Buh Buh whipped Sandman onto a guardrail, which injured his neck and Sandman was carried away on a stretcher, leaving Dreamer to fend the Dudleys alone. Dudleys double teamed Dreamer until Spike Dudley came to substitute for Sandman and then the match continued with multiple interferences by Big Dick Dudley and Beulah McGillicutty. Sandman ultimately came back wearing a neck brace and hit his opponents with Singapore cane and then Dreamer and Sandman hit DDTs to Dudleys for the win. In the penultimate match, Rob Van Dam defended the World Television Championship against Sabu. After a back and forth action between the two, the match ended in a thirty minute time limit draw. As a result, RVD retained the title. Main event match Shane Douglas defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Al Snow despite being severely injured. The Triple Threat constantly interfered in the match and both men kicked out of each other's finishers. Snow attempted a sunset flip from the top rope on Douglas but Douglas rolled through the sunset flip to retain the title. Reception Wrestlepalooza received mixed reviews from critics. David of Wrestling Recaps wrote \\"unless 30 minutes of RVD/Sabu sounds too good to pass up, or unless you are a devout fan of Mikey Whipwreck or Justin Credible, you might be less than enthused about this show.\\" Scott Keith of 411Mania gave a \\"Strong recommendation to avoid\\", stating it to be \\"the consensus favorite for “Worst ECW PPV Ever”, due to some truly uninspired booking and style clashes.\\" and considered the Snow match \\"a slap in the face to the fans.\\" According to Scott's Blog of Doom, the event \\"was mediocre at best.\\" and considered it to be a \\"one match (TV title) show\\". They commented on the main event \\"While Al Snow can run with the big boys his biggest move came against Douglas’ henchmen instead of the champion. I understand how limited Douglas was in this match but it could have been better.\\" They commented on the other matches of the undercard, considering \\"RVD-Sabu matchup was incredible with so many high spots. If you have not seen that match please locate it. Without a sufficient ending one would think these guys would have future matchups.\\" and commented on the tag team match between Tommy Dreamer, The Sandman and Dudley Boyz for having \\"an unpredictable finish the meat in the middle lacked some flavor.\\" Aftermath Shane Douglas' injury kept him sidelined for the next few months after Wrestlepalooza. He continued to appear on ECW television in a non-wrestling role while recovering from his injury and kept the World Heavyweight Championship. He would ultimately return to in-ring competition in the fall of 1998. Al Snow left ECW after Wrestlepalooza and jumped to World Wrestling Federation. The feud between Tommy Dreamer, The Sandman, Spike Dudley and Dudley Boyz continued after Wrestlepalooza, which became intense and personal after Dudley Boyz injured Beulah McGillicutty on the June 3 Hardcore TV. After feuding for the next two months, the two teams competed in a Street Fight at Heat Wave to end the feud.

They are honoured as Righteous Among the Nations for saving Jews from the Nazis in Serbia during World War II. Svetozar was a Serbian Orthodox priest, and the son of a priest. Vida, his wife ( Petrović), was the daughter of Mihailo Petrović, who had been a Chetnik freedom fighter against the Ottomans. Aleksandar, her brother, was a student. In 1941, the Nazis occupied Belgrade and began rounding up Jews. The Fenje family (the father who had the title of Doctor, the mother, and their two daughters) fled to Raška to escape persecution; but the Nazis began to \\"cleanse\\" that town also of Jews. Many who had been friends or neighbours offered the Fenjes no help, but Svetosar and Vida did. They sheltered them in their own home and arranged hiding places for the father and one daughter in nearby villages. Aleksandar arranged similar hiding places for the mother and the other daughter. The area was dangerous: Chetniks of Dragoljub Mihailović and Yugoslav Partisans were fighting the Germans, who were searching for and arresting everyone they considered undesirable. The Fenjes wore peasants' clothing, moved from place to place, and survived the war. Aleksandar was less fortunate. He was captured by the Nazis, and sent to Mauthausen concentration camp. On 29 June 1944, he was gassed at nearby Hartheim. On 24 October 2002, Yad Vashem recognised Svetozar and Vida Milenković and Aleksandar Petrović as Righteous Among the Nations.

During ground processing, the analog information was digitized with an accuracy of 1/800th of full scale. One analog channel was subcommutated in a 16-frame-long pattern and used to telemeter spacecraft temperatures, power system voltages, currents, etc. A digital solar aspect sensor measured the spin period and phase, digitized to 0.036 s, and the angle between the spin axis and sun direction to about 3-deg intervals. Mission Explorer 26 was launched from Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 17A on a Thor Delta C rocket on 21 December 1964 at 09:00:03. The spacecraft systems functioned well, except for some undervoltage turnoffs, until May 26, 1967, when the telemeter failed. The initial spin rate was 33 rpm, and the spin axis direction was right ascension 272.8 deg and declination 21.5 deg. The spin rate decreased with time to 2 rpm on September 9, 1965. For the balance of its life, the spacecraft was coning or tumbling at a rate of about 1 rpm.

Painting by Manuel de Araujo Porto-alegre. The coronation of the Emperor of Brazil was the religious rite of consecration during which the monarchs of the Empire of Brazil were solemnly blessed, anointed, crowned, invested with the other items of the imperial regalia and enthroned, according to the usages of the Catholic Church, the Empire's official, established Church. The coronation of the Brazilian monarch confirmed the accession of a new emperor to the throne, and corresponded to similar rites that took place in other Christian monarchies. The two Brazilian emperors, Pedro I and Pedro II underwent the ceremony of coronation, on 1 December 1822 and 18 July 1841, respectively. Those remain the two sole acts of coronation that took place in the South American continent. Specific usages In Brazil, the rites of coronation generally followed the Roman ritual for the coronation of Kings,Oliveira, Eduardo Romero de. O império da lei: ensaio sobre o cerimonial de sagração de D. Pedro I (1822), p. 140, available at http://www.scielo.br/pdf/tem/v13n26/a08v1326.pdf as prescribed by the Roman PontificalThe Roman rite for the coronation of a King, contained in the Roman Pontifical (Pontificale Romanum), should not be confused with the specific Rite for the coronation of a Holy Roman emperor at the Papal Court, a rite celebrated by the Pope alone and contained in the Roman Ceremonial (Caerimoniale Romanum), the book that described the ceremonies that were exclusive to the Roman Pontiff. The coronation of the emperors of Brazil followed the rite for the coronation of a King contained in the Pontificale Romanum, that was the rite of the Roman Church for the coronation of monarchs in general. References to \\"king\\" and \\"kingdom\\", however, were adapted to \\"emperor\\" and \\"empire\\". according to its edition then in force (promulgated by Pope Benedict XIV), in its ordo titled De benedictione et coronatione Regis,The text of the Rite of the Roman Pontifical then in use is available at http://www.liturgialatina.org/pontificale/120.htm but with a few modifications, such as the natural replacement of references to king and kingdom to emperor and empire, and the bestowal of a few items of regalia not contemplated in the rite of the Roman Pontifical (the delivery of an orb, the investiture with gloves and with a ring, etc.). While, even after the codification and uniformization of the Roman Rite following the Council of Trent, certain Catholic countries retained permission to continue using their own particular coronation rites (such as the rite of coronation of the Kings of France), the Roman ritual for the coronation of kings, as codified in the Roman Pontifical (first issued under Pope Clement VIII), became the standard coronation rite for the Latin Church, given that all liturgies included in the Roman Pontifical where prescribed for general use in the entire Roman Rite. As such, this rite was available for use by the Roman Rite bishops in Brazil and by the Brazilian monarchy, and was naturally adopted, as prescribed by the liturgical laws then in force in the Catholic Church. As with all the liturgical acts of the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church at the time, the ceremony of the coronation was conducted entirely in Latin, except for the sermon, that was preached in Portuguese, the local vernacular language. Brazil never used the rites for the coronation of a sovereign's consort, and therefore the empresses of Brazil were not crowned, including Empress Maria Leopoldina, who was already married to Pedro I at the time of his coronation, but was not crowned alongside her husband. The country also never employed the rite for the coronation of an empress regnant,In the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, the rite for the coronation of a queen regnant differs substantially both from the rite for the coronation of a king and also from the rite for the coronation of a queen consort. because the Brazilian monarchy was abolished in 1889 by the military coup d'état that proclaimed Brazil a republic, before Princess Imperial Isabel could succeed her father on the throne. While other countries allowed the coronation of their monarchs while still minors and under regency, in Brazil the coronation of Emperor Pedro II (who succeeded to the crown while still a minor) only took place after the emperor had been declared of age and had assumed the personal discharge of the imperial authority. The coronation of both emperors of Brazil took place in the then Cathedral of Rio de Janeiro, now known as the Old Cathedral, that functioned as the Imperial Chapel. The coronation of Emperor Pedro I was presided over by the Bishop of Rio de Janeiro, Major Chaplain of the Imperial Chapel, because Brazil's only Metropolitan, the Archbishop of São Salvador da Bahia, was unavailable. The coronation of Emperor Pedro II was presided by the then Metropolitan Archbishop of São Salvador da Bahia, Primate of Brazil. All Bishops of Brazil (then few in number) were summoned to attend the ceremonies of coronation. The coronation of Pedro II was attended by six bishops in addition to the Archbishop of Salvador. Coronation ritual Detailed accounts of the coronations of the two Brazilian emperors exist, such as a very meticulous account of the coronation of emperor Dom Pedro II published by Rio de Janeiro's Jornal do Commercio newspaper on 20 July 1840 The said account, in full, is also published in the book by Lima, J. I. de Abreu. Compêndio da História do Brasil, volume 2, pp. 176 et seq, available at https://books.google.com/books?id=VdhWAAAAcAAJ&pg;=RA2-PA180 and in the works of historiansShubert, Guilherme. A coroação de D. Pedro I, Rio de Janeiro, Arquivo Nacional, 1973Sousa, Octavio Tarquinio de. Historia dos Fundadores do Império do Brasil, vol. II, p. 448 et seq. Another source describing the proceedings that were to be observed in the coronation of emperor Dom Pedro I, including the ceremony for the taking of civil oaths (not prescribed in the Roman Pontifical) that were to be sworn at the conclusion of the liturgy, is the document Ceremonial of the consecration and coronation of Emperor Pedro I that is to take place in the Imperial Chapel of Our Lady of Mount Carmel on the 1st day of December of the current year, that was approved by the imperial government on 20 November 1822 and is contained in a letter addressed by the Minister for the Empire, José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva, to the imperial court's officers of arms. The said ceremonial was published in the volume of Government Decisions of the Collection of the Laws of Brazil for the year 1822. All those ceremonials and accounts of the festivities are only lacking on the question of the music that was played during the coronation liturgy (e.g. for the entrance and departure processions, etc.) In the Empire of Brazil era, contemporaries referred to the act of coronation as the ceremony of sagração do Imperador (consecration of the emperor), in a way similar to the French habit of calling the coronation of the French monarch le sacre du roi (the king's consecration), placing emphasis in the act of consecration and anointing over the act of crowning. More formally, the rite was known to contemporaries as the ceremony of sagração e coroação (consecration and coronation), never ceasing to mention the first aspect. As required by the Roman Pontifical, the both the 1822 and the 1841 coronations took place on Sundays and, in preparation for the solemnity, the emperor fasted on the preceding Wednesday and also on the preceding Friday and Saturday. Entrance into the church In the early morning the emperor (in the case of Pedro I, accompanied by the empress), left the Imperial Palace of St. Christopher, the imperial residence, and went by coach, in full state and with a large military ceremonial escort, to the Imperial Palace at the City, the formal seat of government, facing the Carmelite Convent and Rio de Janeiro's Cathedral (that also functioned as the Imperial Chapel, and was the site of the coronation). From the City Palace, the emperor and his family, preceded by heralds, kings of arms, ministers of the government and officers of state went to the cathedral in solemn procession by foot. Emperor Pedro II saluted the members of the diplomatic corps at the City Palace before the start of his coronation procession, and the procession started at 11:00 a.m. Emperor Pedro I crossed the short distance between the palace and the cathedral under a canopy borne by four knights. Emperor Pedro II left the church under a similar canopy, but none is mentioned at the entrance. However, for the coronation of Pedro II, a temporary building connecting the palace to the cathedral was built, the coronation balcony, and thus the second Brazilian emperor walked the distance between the city palace and the church in the view of the people, but inside the balcony. The emperor wore the military uniform of a knight, complete with spurs, and, at the initial stage of the ceremony, the dress included armour and a knight's mantle over it, a knight's sword and a helmet with feathers (that left his face visible). Diamantine Crown of Emperor Pedro II, made for the 1841 coronation. Once in the church, the emperor removed his helmet, and was received near the door by the Bishop of Rio de Janeiro, Major Chaplain of the Imperial Chapel, accompanied by the canons of the cathedral. The bishop sprinkled the emperor with holy water. The emperor then replaced his helmet to walk down the aisle. As part of the entrance procession, officers of state who carried the items of the regalia delivered them to the clergy when arriving at the chancel, and the clergy placed the regalia that would later be delivered to the emperor on top of the Altar table, including the imperial sword, the crown, the gloves, the ring, the orb, the rod of the Hand of Justice and the sceptre. Having walked down the nave, and before entering the chancel, the emperor turned left, and, removing his helmet once more, entered the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament. There he knelt in prayer, before leaving that chapel, placing his helmet once more and entering the church's chancel. The officiating prelate awaited him in a faldstool before the altar, and the emperor was met at the chancel rails by a group of the assisting bishops, who flanked him. Members of the imperial Family, including the empress consort in the case of Pedro I and other ladies of the imperial court, took their seats the honour boxes in the second floor. Arriving at the chancel area, the emperor then mounted the imperial throne, while the bishops and other clergy, who until then were in choir dress, were vested (the presiding prelate and his accompanying ministers - assistant priests, deacons, etc. - in vestments proper for pontifical Mass, the other bishops in cope and white mitre), while reciting the prescribed vesting prayers. The emperor's domestic chaplains who were to assist him at the throne remained in choir dress. The imperial throne was permanently present in the imperial chapel, in the chancel area, under a baldachin complete with drapes, immediately next to the steps leading to the presbytery, in the Gospel side of the chancel, that is, on the left side from the perspective of someone viewing from the nave. The bishop's cathedral and its baldachin were also in the Gospel side of the chancel, but in the sanctuary, on top of the presbytery steps, very near to the imperial throne, so that the imperial throne and the episcopal cathedra stood next to each other (although the cathedra was in a more elevated position). The throne dais had one step less than the presbytery steps, so that the throne was in an elevated position, but slightly lower than the sanctuary. When the clergy was ready, the assisting bishops came towards the throne to invite the emperor to appear before the officiating prelate, still sitting in his faldstool at the centre of the altar. The emperor then descended from the throne, and flanked by the assisting bishops, ascended the presbytery steps and, entering the sanctuary, approached the officiating prelate, kissing his hand. Immediately before mounting the presbytery steps and entering the sanctuary, the emperor removed his helmet for the final time, and delivered it to an aide. From this point on, the emperor remained bareheaded, until the moment of his crowning. The introductory rites and prayer of solemn blessing The coronation rites began with the petition, made by the senior assisting bishop to the officiating prelate, asking him, in the name of the Catholic Church, to perform the coronation. A dialogue followed to confirm the suitability of the person to be crowned. After that, a chair was brought and the emperor sat while the prelate read an admonition to the excellent prince, about the duties of a sovereign. This admonition being concluded, the emperor stood, the chair was carried away, and the emperor knelt before the prelate and then took a solemn oath, known as a profession, according to the form contained in the Roman pontifical. Placing his hand on a Bible that was presented to him, the monarch confirmed the oath with the Latin words Sic me Deus adjuvet, et haec sancta Dei Evangelia, that mean, So help me God, and these holy Gospels of God. The emperor then remained kneeling facing the altar, while the officiating archbishop or bishop, standing before the kneeling monarch, pronounced in a loud voice the prayer Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, creator omnium to bless the emperor in preparation for his anointing, which prayer was repeated in a subdued voice by the other assisting bishops, from their places, as follows: > Let us pray. Almighty and everlasting God, creator of all things, Emperor of > Angels, King of kings and Lord of lords, who caused your faithful servant > Abraham to triumph over his enemies, gave many victories to Moses and > Joshua, the leaders of your people, exalted your humble servant David to the > eminence of kingship, enriched Solomon with the ineffable gifts of wisdom > and peace, hear our humble prayers, we entreat, O Lord, and multiply your > blessings (here a sign of the cross was made over the kneeling monarch) upon > this thy servant N., whom in prayerful devotion we elect and will consecrate > as emperor; surround him always and everywhere with the strength of your > right arm, that he, being firm in the faith like Abraham, endowed with > meekness like Moses, armed with courage like Joshua, praiseworthy in > humility like David, and distinguished with wisdom like Solomon, may please > you in all things and always walk without offense in the way of inviolate > justice; defended by the helmet of your protection, covered with your > invincible shield and clothed with heavenly armour; may he obtain the happy > triumph of victory over the enemies of the Holy Cross of Christ, cause them > to fear its power, and bring peace to those who are your soldiers. Through > Jesus Christ our Lord, who by the power of His Cross has destroyed hell, > overcame the kingdom of the devil, ascended victorious into Heaven, and in > whom subsists all power, kingship and victory, He who is the glory of the > humble and the life and salvation of the peoples, Who lives and reigns with > You in the unity of Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever. Amen.Oremus. > Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, Creator omnium, Imperator Angelorum, Rex regum, > et Dominus dominantium, qui Abraham fidelem servum tuum de hostibus > triumphare fecisti, Moysi, et Josue populo tuo praelatis multiplicem > victoriam tribuisti, humilemque David puerum tuum regni fastigio sublimasti, > et Salomonem sapientiae pacisque ineffabili munere ditasti, respice, > quaesumus, Domine, ad preces humilitatis nostrae, et super hunc famulum tuum > N. quem supplici devotione in Imperatorem elegimus et consecraturi sumus, > bene + dictionum tuarum dona multiplica, eumque dexterae tuae potentia > semper, et ubique circumda; quatenus praedicti Abrahae fidelitate firmatus, > Moysi mansuetudine fretus, Josue fortitudine munitus, David humilitate > exaltatus, Salomonis sapientia decoratus, tibi in omnibus complaceat, et per > tramitem justitiae inoffenso gressu semper incedat; tuae quoque protectionis > galea munitus, et scuto insuperabili jugiter protectus, armisque coelestibus > circumdatus, optabilis de hostibus sanctae crucis Christi victoriae > triumphum feliciter capiat, terroremque suae potentiae illis inferat, et > pacem tibi militantibus laetanter reportet. Per Christum Dominum nostrum, > qui virtute sanctae crucis tartara destruxit, regnoque diaboli superato, ad > coelos victor ascendit, in quo potestas omnis, regnique consistit victoria, > qui est gloria humilium, et vita salusque populorum, qui tecum vivit et > regnat in unitate Spiritus Sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. R. > Amen. After this prayer was concluded, the emperor stood and went to the Gospel side of the altar (the left hand side from the perspective of those in the nave), where he knelt before a faldstool and prostrated his head on the cushion of the faldstool. The Litany of the Saints was then begun by the choir. The Litany of the Saints and the Anointing During the Litany of the Saints the presiding prelate also knelt in a faldstool at the centre of the altar, and all those present knelt in their places. The presiding prelate read the litany in a low voice while it was chanted aloud by the choir. After most of the invocations, at the point indicated by the Roman Pontifical, the choir paused, the officiating prelate stood and, with his pastoral staff in his hand, went towards the emperor, and standing before him, he recited aloud two of the invocations of the litany that were specific to the coronation rite: the first asked God deign to bless this emperor-elect who is about to be crowned (a sign of the cross being made over the emperor at the word \\"bless\\"),Ut hunc electum in Imperatorem coronandum bene + dicere digneris. R. Te rogamus, audi nos. and the second asking God to bless and consecrate this emperor-elect who is about to be crowned (two additional signs of the cross being made over the emperor at the words \\"bless\\" and \\"consecrate\\").Ut hunc electum in Imperatorem coronandum bene + dicere, et conse + crare digneris. R. Te rogamus, audi nos After this, the officiating archbishop or bishop returned to his place and the litany was continued, being chanted by the choir until its conclusion. After the litany, while all remained kneeling and the emperor remained prostrate, the presiding prelate rose, removed his mitre, and recited the Lord's prayer: the words Pater noster were said aloud and the rest of the prayer was recited in silence, until the words et ne nos inducas in tentationem, that were said aloud, prompting the people to respond with the final verse of the prayer: sed libera nos a malo. A series of verses and responses then followed, several of them asking God's protection upon the emperor, his servant. After the last exchange of verse and response, the prelate proclaimed oremus (let us pray) and he, together with the other Bishops present, recited two short prayers, one asking God to grant his heavenly aid to this His servant (the emperor); the other asking God to inspire and to confirm the actions of His bishops. At this point the officiating prelate and the other bishops resumed the use of their mitres. The emperor then rose from his prostration, and all other attendants at the coronation who were kneeling then rose as well. Then the emperor, with the help of his peers and ministers removed his collars and sash of orders of chivalry, and other insignia, removed the knight's mantle and armour, and military dress (including, in the case of Pedro II, even the knight's boots and the spurs), and stood finally, in the white trousers of the imperial court dress and a simple white linen shirt that had special openings to permit the anoinings. Meanwhile, the assisting bishops formed a circle around the monarch, shielding him from general view. There the emperor knelt to be anointed by the consecrating prelate, who sat before him at the faldstool at the centre of the altar. In preparation for the anointing, a gremiale was extended over the consecrating prelate's lap by the altar servers, and the prelate, aided by the servers, removed his episcopal ring, the episcopal glove of the right hand, and then replaced the ring on the fourth finger of his bare right hand. The presiding archbishop or bishop then dipped his right thumb in the holy oil known as the Oil of Cathecumens, and anointed the emperor in two places, both anointings being made in the form of a cross: first the unction was performed in the emperor's right forearm, between the joint of the elbow and the joint of the fist; then the emperor reclined over the prelate and was anointed in his back, between the shoulders, starting at the base of the neck. For this anointing, silver buttons at the back of the emperor's garment were opened, being closed afterwards. While performing the holy anointing, the celebrating prelate, with a clear voice, addressed the emperor with the formula Deus, Dei Filius, that was repeated in a low voice by the other bishops, in the following words: > God, the Son of God, Our Lord Jesus Christ, who by the Father was anointed > with the oil of gladness above his fellows, may He himself, by this present > infusion of sacred anointing pour upon your head the blessing (here a sign > of the cross was made over the emperor) of the Spirit Paraclete, so that He > may penetrate into the innermost recesses of your heart, in order that you > receive, by this visible and material oil, invisible gifts, and, finally, > having performed the just government of this temporal empire, you may merit > to reign eternally with Him who alone is the sinless King of Kings, Who > lives and is glorified with God the Father in the unity of God the Holy > Spirit, for ever and ever. Amen.Deus, Dei Filius, Jesus Christus Dominus > noster, qui a Patre oleo exsultationis unctus est prae participibus suis, > ipse per praesentem sanctae unctionis infusionem, Spiritus Paracliti super > caput tuum bene + dictionem infundat, eamdemque usque ad interiora cordis > tui penetrare faciat; quatenus hoc visibili et tractabili oleo, dona > invisibilia percipere, et temporali imperio justis moderationibus peracto, > aeternaliter cum eo regnare merearis, qui solus sine peccato Rex regum > vivit, et gloriatur cum Deo Patre in unitate Spiritus Sancti Deus, per omnia > saecula saeculorum. R. Amen. After the anointing and the recitation of the above-mentioned formula (that, with minor changes in wording, featured also in several other rites of consecration of Christian monarchs, such as old rite for the coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor and the French, the English, and the Hungarian royal coronation rites), the gremiale was taken away by the altar servers and the presiding prelate then immediately stood and recited aloud the following prayer to God (the prayer Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui Hazael super Syriam...), that was repeated in a low voice by the other assistant bishops, with the emperor still kneeling, as follows: > Let us pray. Almighty everlasting God, who made to be anointed as kings, > Hazael over Syria, and Jehu over Israel by [the hands of] Elijah; and also > David and Saul by [the hands of] the Prophet Samuel, we beseech You, grant > Your blessing to the work of our hands, and to this your servant N., whom > we, though unworthy, today anointed as emperor with a sacred unction, bestow > the force and efficacy of the said ointment; constitute, O Lord, the > principality over his shoulders, that he be a strong, just, faithful, and > prudent ruler of this Empire and of Your people: a purger of the infidels, a > cultivator of justice, a rewarder of merits and repayer of faults, a > defender of Your Holy Church and of the Christian faith, for the honour and > praise of Your glorious Name. Through Jesus Christ our Lord, your Son, Who > with You lives and reigns in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God forever and > ever. Amen.Oremus. Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui Hazael super Syriam, et > Jehu super Israel per Eliam, David quoque et Saulem per Samuelem prophetam > in Reges inungi fecisti, tribue, quaesumus, manibus nostris opem tuae > benedictionis, et huic famulo tuo N. quem hodie licet indigni, in > Imperatorem sacra unctione delinimus, dignam delibutionis hujus efficaciam > et virtutem concede: constitue, Domine, principatum super humerum ejus, ut > sit fortis, justus, fidelis, providus, et indefessus imperii hujus, et > populi tui gubernator, infidelium expugnator, justitiae cultor, meritorum et > demeritorum remunerator, Ecclesiae tuae sanctae, et fidei christianae > defensor, ad decus, et laudem tui nominis gloriosi. Per Dominum nostrum > Jesum Christum Filium tuum, qui tecum vivit et regnat in unitate Spiritus > Sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. R. Amen. With this prayer, the consecration of the emperor was complete. From this point onwards, the monarch was never again referred to in liturgical prayers as \\"emperor elect\\" but as \\"emperor\\". It must be noted, however, that although the Catholic coronation liturgy treated the sovereign as \\"the elect\\" on coronation day prior to the moment of his anointing and the associated consecratory prayers, under the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil and its laws an emperor succeeded to the crown and to the imperial title as soon as his predecessor died or abdicated. The consecration and coronation of the monarch, therefore, was a solemn sacramentalcoronation Rites, Reginald Maxwell Woolley, Cambridge, at the University Press, 1915. intended to bless the sovereign and to confirm his accession to the throne, but the assumption of the imperial dignity did not depend on it. From the perspective of religion, however, the anointing of the monarch bestowed upon him a sacred character, and the coronation rite placed him in a special position within the Catholic hierarchy. The anointed sovereign became a mixta persona: no longer fully a layman; endowed with some of the status of the clergy, but also not a clergyman, and tasked by the words of the coronation ritual with the mission of being a mediator between clergy and people. Also, the tradition of the Church viewed Christian monarchs not only as civil rulers of Christian nations, but also as defenders of the Church and helpers of the ecclesiastical authority. Furthermore, the task of governing a Christian people was understood a holy one. Thus, the coronation ritual was predicated on the view that the monarch had a sacred function, as was sacred the function of the biblical Israelite kings and of the other leaders of the Israelites mentioned in the prayers of the coronation rite. Although the coronation of a monarch is not a sacrament but a sacramental (unlike the Sacrament of Holy Orders that constitutes deacons, priests and bishops), it is still a solemn religious act of consecration, like the dedication of a new church or of an altar, the blessing of a monk as an abbot to govern a monastery or the consecration of virgins as nuns: by the said act of consecration the monarch was set apart as possessing a sacred character not equal but similar to that of the clergy, and was invested with a kingship that derived from God like the kingship of the ancient kings of Israel. After the above-mentioned prayer, the anointings were duly purified, and the presiding prelate, removing his episcopal ring, washed his hands. He then resumed the use of the episcopal gloves and replaced the ring in the fourth finger of his right hand over the glove. Meanwhile, the emperor stood to receive the imperial vestments. The vesting of the emperor The rites of the anointing being concluded, newly consecrated emperor rose to his feet to be clad in the imperial vestments (the same majestic dress that was thereafter used for the opening and closing of the annual sessions of the Imperial Parliament). The Roman Pontificial provided options for this. The newly anointed monarch could either briefly retire to the church's sacristy to put on the majestatic vestments, returning to the sacred space of the church when already dressed, or he could be dressed in the sacred space of the church itself. In the coronation of Emperor Pedro I, the first pattern was followed (with the emperor going to the sacristy and then returning to the sacred area of the church via a door in the chancel area of the chapel that connected the chancel to the sacristy), while in the coronation of Pedro II the second pattern was followed. In either case, the emperor's officers of state attended to him and aided him in putting on the imperial vestments, including, a white robe of state in the form of a deacon's dalmatic, a sash and collar of Orders of Chivalry. As for the monarch's shoes, although Emperor Pedro I continued wearing the metal boots of a knight throughout the entire coronation ceremony, Emperor Pedro II removed his knight's boots for the anointing, and afterwards, while being dressed in his robes of state, put on white shoes that were part of his majestatic vestments and that matched his white robe. In the case of the coronation of Pedro II, that was vested in the chancel area of the cathedral, in the sight of all the attendants of the coronation ceremony, the final, most symbolic items of the imperial robes of state (the imperial mantle and the pallium), were delivered to him not by his officers of state but by the officiating archbishop. After the emperor's officers of state had clad him in the other items of the imperial vestments, the archbishop then approached the emperor, and, aided by the emperor's major chamberlain, who brought forward the imperial mantle, the prelate vested the emperor with the imperial mantle (which had a top surface of dark green velvet embroidered with gold, and was of the cloth of gold in the internal surface), and clad the emperor with the pallium over the mantle. The pallium stood over the shoulders in the manner of a mozzetta, and the mantle had a train. In the case of the coronation of Pedro I, however, when he returned from the sacristy he did so already wearing the mantle and pallium. After the emperor was fully robed, he was led back to his throne. The major chamberlain carried the train of the imperial mantle at this time and in all the following occasions when the emperor had to walk while using the mantle.The coronation Ceremonial directed the major chamberlain to leave the mantle's train extended on the ground when the emperor was paused, kneeling or standing in place, but to pick up the train and carry it when the emperor needed to walk. Arriving at the dais of the throne, the emperor stood there on the top of the steps but without sitting on the throne chair, accompanied by two chaplains of his household. A prie-dieu was placed in front of him, and he knelt under the canopy of the throne to hear Holy Mass, flanked by his domestic chaplains. The Mass begins and is celebrated until the gradual The celebrating archbishop or bishop, aided by his ministers, then started the celebration of Holy Mass, reciting the prayers at the foot of the altar, and then ascended the altar while the choir sang the introit. The Coronation Mass took the form of a Pontifical High Mass. While the celebrating prelate recited the Confiteor with his ministers, the emperor also recited the Confiteor with his domestic chaplains under the canopy of the throne, as directed by the coronation rite of the Roman Pontifical. The Coronation Mass followed the liturgical propers of the Mass of the day (including the introit antiphon, the reading of the Epistle, the gradual or tract, the reading of the Gospel, the offertory antiphon, the preface and the communion antiphon), but, at the occasions of the collect prayer, the secret prayer, and the prayer after Communion, special prayers for the emperor, prescribed in the coronation rite of the Roman Pontifical, were recited after the normal prayers of the liturgy of the day contained in the Roman Missal. Those special collect, secret and postcommunion prayers for the monarch were the same ones that are prescribed in the Roman Missal for the votive Missa pro Rege (Mass for the King), with the natural replacement of all mentions of \\"king\\" for \\"emperor\\". Because the coronation always took place on a Sunday, as required by the Roman Pontifical, the Gloria was sung after the Kyrie (except if the liturgy took place in the penitential liturgical seasons of Lent, Septuagesima or Advent) and the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed was sung after the reading of the Gospel. After the Gloria and the Collect of the day, the special Collect for the emperor was as follows: > We humbly ask, all powerful God, that your servant N., our emperor, who by > your mercy received the government of this Empire, may receive also the > increase of all virtues, and that through them he may avoid all the > monstrous vices, and that he may with grace arrive unto you, who are the > way, the truth and life. Through Our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who with > You lives and reigns in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and > ever. Amen.Quaesumus, omnipotens Deus, ut famulus tuus N. Imperator noster, > qui tua miseratione suscepit imperii gubernacula, virtutum etiam omnium > percipiat incrementa, quibus decenter ornatus, et vitiorum monstra devitare, > et ad te, qui via, veritas et vita es, gratiosus valeat pervenire. Per > Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum Filium tuum, qui tecum vivit et regnat in > unitate Spiritus Sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. R. Amen. The celebration of Mass was then continued until and excluding the 'Alleluia' before the Gospel (or, when there was no Alleluia due to the liturgical season, until and excluding the last verse of tract, or, when appropriate, until and excluding the sequence preceding the Gospel). Therefore, after the reading of the Epistle and the chanting of the Gradual, the normal liturgy of the Mass was interrupted, and the specific ceremonies of the coronation were resumed, so that the delivery of the imperial insignia, including the emperor's actual coronation and enthronement, took place within the celebration of the Eucharist. Mass is interrupted: the investiture with the sword Once the Eucharistic celebration was paused after the Gradual, the emperor, who until then remained kneeling, reading and listening to the Mass together with his domestic chaplains under the canopy of the throne, stood and descended from the throne dais, and, accompanied by the assistant bishops, entered the presbytery and presented himself once more to the celebrating archbishop or bishop, kissing his hand. Meanwhile, the prelate had descended from the Episcopal cathedra and had sat once more at the faldstool at the centre of the altar. The emperor then knelt before the presiding prelate, to be invested with the imperial sword. The prelate stood to perform this ceremony. A deacon brought the sword from the altar in its scabbard, and presented it to the Minister of War, who removed it from its scabbard and delivered it to the celebrating archbishop or bishop, who took it by the blade and presented it to the emperor, who took it by its base, while the celebrating prelate pronounced the long and very ancient formula for the delivery of the sword, Accipe gladium de Altare sumptum per nostras manus...,Accipe gladium de altari sumptum per nostras manus, licet indignas, vice tamen, et auctoritate sanctorum Apostolorum consecratas, tibi imperialiter concessum, nostraeque bene + dictionis officio in defensionem sanctae Dei Ecclesiae divinitus ordinatum: et memor esto ejus, de quo Psalmista prophetavit, dicens: Accingere gladio tuo super femur tuum, potentissime: ut in hoc per eumdem vim aequitatis exerceas, molem iniquitatis potenter destruas, et sanctam Dei Ecclesiam, ejusque fideles propugnes, ac protegas; nec minus sub fide falsos, quam christiani nominis hostes exsecreris, ac dispergas: viduas, et pupillos clementer adjuves ac defendas; desolata restaures, restaurata conserves: ulciscaris injusta, confirmes bene disposita; quatenus haec agendo, virtutum triumpho gloriosus, justitiaeque cultor egregius, cum mundi Salvatore sine fine regnare merearis. Qui cum Deo Patre, et Spiritu Sancto vivit et regnat Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. Amen. in the following words: > Receive from our hands that, though unworthy, have yet been consecrated to > be in the place and discharge the authority of the holy Apostles, the sword > brought from the Altar, which is given to you as emperor, and which, as > ordained by God, is dedicated by our blessing (here a sign of the Cross was > made) to the defence of the Holy Church of God; and be mindful of what the > Psalmist prophetised, saying \\"Gird yourself with your sword upon your thigh, > O most mighty one\\", that by it you may exercise the force of equity, > mightily destroy the growth of iniquity, protect and advance the Holy Church > of God and its faithful people; no less than you shall pursue and disperse > the false faithful and the enemies of the Christian name; mercifully help > and defend widows and orphans, restore those things which have fallen into > decay and maintain those things that were restored, avenge injustices and > confirm good dispositions; that, in so doing, you may be glorious by the > triumph of virtue, and be an eminent cultivator of justice, that you may > merit to reign without end with the Saviour of the world, Who lives and > reigns with God the Father and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. > Amen. After this formula was recited, the emperor gave the sword back to the officiating archbishop or bishop, who gave it back to the deacon, who gave it back to the Minister of War, who placed it in its scabbard. And then the Minister of War returned the sword, in its scabbard, to the deacon, who returned it to the celebrating prelate, who tied it to the emperor's waist by the left thigh, and after the emperor was thus girded with the sword, the prelate pronounced the formula Accingere gladio tuo, etc.,Accingere gladio tuo super femur tuum, potentissime; et attende, quod Sancti non in gladio, sed per fidem vicerunt regna. in the following words: > Gird yourself with your sword upon your thigh, O most mighty one, and beware > that the Saints conquered kingdoms not through the sword, but by the Faith. The emperor then arose, and removed the sword from its scabbard, and made vibrations and motions with it in the air and passed with the blade through his left arm as though cleansing it, and then replaced the sword in the scabbard at his thigh, and knelt once more. The crowning of the emperor The crowning of Emperor Pedro II, 18 July 1841. All the assisting bishops then gathered around the emperor in the form of a circle, while the celebrating archbishop or bishop went to the altar himself to pick up the imperial crown. The emperor, still kneeling, was then reverently crowned by the celebrating prelate, in the Name of the Most Holy Trinity, and all the bishops placed their hands on top of the crown, while the presiding prelate recited aloud the formula Accipe coronam imperii... (Receive the crown of the Empire...),This formula was identical to the formula Accipe coronam regni... (Receive the crown of the Kingdom...) contained in the Roman Pontifical, except for the alteration of all mentions of \\"kingdom\\" to mentions of \\"empire\\". that was recited also in a subdued voice by the other bishops, and as the names of each of the Three Divine Persons were spoken, signs of the Cross were made over the newly crowned emperor to bless his crowning, as follows: > Receive the Crown of the Empire, that by the hands of us bishops, though > unworthy, is imposed upon your head (at this point the crown was lowered at > the head of the monarch by the celebrating archbishop or bishop and he and > the other bishops placed their hands upon it), in the name of the Father (at > this point all prelates made a first sign of the cross over the crowned > emperor), and of the Son (at this point a second sign of the cross was > made), and of the Holy Spirit (at this point a third sign of the cross was > made); and know that it signifies the glory of holiness, honour, and > righteousness, and do not ignore that by it you become a partaker in our > ministry; so that, just as we are in the internal forum pastors and rectors > of souls, so be you in the external forum a sincere worshiper of God and a > strenuous defender assisting the Church of Christ against all adversities; > and may you show yourself to be a useful trustee and a profitable ruler of > the Empire that God has given you and committed to your government by means > of our blessing as placeholders of the Apostles and with the aid of all the > saints; so that, ornamented with the jewels of the virtues, and crowned with > the reward of everlasting happiness, you may have among the glorious > athletes a glory without end with our Saviour and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, in > whose Name and place you believe to govern, Who lives and rules, one God, > with the Father and the Holy Spirit, forever and ever. Amen.Accipe coronam > imperii, quae, licet ab indignis, Episcoporum tamen manibus capiti tuo > imponitur. In nomine Pa + tris, et Fi + lii, et Spiritus + Sancti, quam > sanctitatis gloriam, et honorem, et opus fortitudinis, significare > intelligas, et per hanc te participem ministerii nostri non ignores. Ita ut > sicut nos in interioribus pastores, rectoresque animarum intelligimur, ita > et tu in exterioribus versus Dei cultor, strenuusque contra omnes > adversitates Ecclesiae Christi defensor assistas, regnique tibi a Deo dati, > et per officium nostrae benedictionis in vice Apostolorum, omniumque > Sanctorum, regimini tuo commissi utilis exsecutor, proficuusque regnator > semper appareas; ut inter gloriosos athletas, virtutum gemmis ornatus, et > praemio sempiternae felicitatis coronatus cum Redemptore, ac Salvatore > nostro Jesu Christo, cujus nomen, vicemque gestare crederis, sine fine > glorieris. Qui vivit, et imperat Deus cum Patre, et Spiritu Sancto in > saecula saeculorum. R. Amen. After the crowning proper, the bishops removed their hands from the crown and the emperor, still kneeling, received the other items of the regalia. The delivery of the regalia: gloves, ring, orb, rod of the Hand of Justice and sceptre Once the crowning was concluded, the emperor remained kneeling and received several items of Regalia without any form of words being said, because those items of Regalia were not prescribed in the Roman Pontifical. The first of those items were the adorned white gloves for both hands of the emperor, followed by the delivery of the imperial ring. A deacon brought from the Altar to the presiding prelate a silver plate with the emperor's gloves and a case containing the imperial ring. The presiding archbishop or bishop then vested the emperor with the gloves, and immediately thereafter placed the ring in the fourth finger of the emperor's right hand, over the glove. The same deacon then went up to the altar, and brought the imperial orb, and presented it to the presiding prelate, who delivered it to the emperor. After holding it for a while, the emperor delivered the orb to his Minister of Foreign Affairs. Afterwards, the same deacon went to the altar and picked up the rod of the Hand of Justice (main de Justice), and presented it to the celebrating prelate, who delivered it to the kneeling emperor. The emperor then handed the Rod of the Hand of Justice to his Justice Minister. After the delivery of those items of regalia, the emperor then received a final insignia, that was foreseen in the Roman Pontifical, and for which, therefore, a form of words of investiture was prescribed: the sceptre. The same deacon went up the steps of the altar, and brought from the altar table the very large sceptre, and presented it to the celebrating Archbishop or bishop, who delivered it to the emperor, who took it with his right hand. The presiding prelate then recited the formula for the delivery of the sceptre, Accipe virgam virtutis, etc.,Accipe virgam virtutis, ac veritatis, qua intelligas te obnoxium mulcere pios, terrere reprobos, errantes viam docere, lapsis manum porrigere, disperdere superbos, et revelare humiles; et aperiat tibi ostium Jesus Christus Dominus noster, qui de semetipso ait: Ego sum ostium: per me si quis introierit, salvabitur; qui est clavis David, et sceptrum domus Israel, qui aperit, et nemo claudit; claudit, et nemo aperit. Sitque tibi ductor, qui educit vinctum de domo carceris, sedentem in tenebris, et umbra mortis: et in omnibus sequi merearis eum, de quo David propheta cecinit: Sedes tua, Deus, in saeculum saeculi: virga directionis, virga regni tui, et imitando ipsum, diligas justitiam, et odio habeas iniquitatem, quia propterea unxit te Deus, Deus tuus, et exemplum illius, quem ante saecula unxerat oleo exsultationis, prae participibus suis, Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum, qui cum eo vivit et regnat Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. R. Amen. in the following words: > Receive the rod of virtue and truth and understand that with it you must > encourage the pious and intimidate the reprobate; guide the straying; lend a > hand to the fallen; repress the proud and raise the humble; and may Our Lord > Jesus Christ open to you the door, He who said of himself, \\"I am the Door, > whoever enters by me, by me shall be saved,\\" and let Him who is the Key of > David and the sceptre of the House of Israel be your helper: He Who opens > and no one may shut, Who shuts and no one may open; and let Him be your > guide, Who brings the captive out of prison, where he seats in darkness and > the shadow of death; that in all things you may imitate Him, of whom the > Prophet David said, \\"Your seat, O God, endures forever; a rod of > righteousness is the rod of your kingdom\\". Imitating Him, may you love > justice and hate iniquity. For that purpose God, your God, has anointed you, > after the example of Him who before the centuries was anointed with the oil > of gladness above His fellows, Jesus Christ, Our Lord, Who with Him lives > and reigns, God, for ever and ever. Amen. After the delivery of the imperial insignia was complete, the emperor rose to his feet, and, aided by his officers of state, removed the imperial sword, in is scabbard, from his waist. The emperor handed the sword, in its adorned scabbard, to his Minister of War, who thus bore it in its scabbard before the emperor for the remainder of the ceremony. The enthronement and the Te Deum The Ministers carrying the sword, the orb, and the rod of the Hand of Justice then stood on the side steps next to the emperor's throne. The emperor, with the crown on his head, the sceptre in his right hand, and wearing his full majestatic dress (his pallium, mantle and other robes of State) and also the gloves on both hands and the ring on the fourth finger of his right hand, then proceeded towards his throne, led by all the Bishops. The officiating prelate walked to the emperor's right, and the senior assistant prelate to the emperor's left. Aided by the bishops, the emperor ascended the steps of the throne, and, under the canopy, the emperor was placed at the throne chair by the two highest ranking prelates: the celebrating prelate held the emperor's right arm and the senior assistant prelate his left arm while seating the emperor on the throne. Once the emperor was seated, the prelates removed their hands from his arms. The emperor was thus enthroned. As soon as the monarch had taken his seat upon the throne, the presiding prelate, addressing him, recited the formula of enthronement, Sta et retine, etc.:Sta,et retine amodo locum tibi a Deo delegatum, per auctoritatem omnipotentis Dei, et per praesentem traditionem nostram, omnium scilicet Episcoporum, ceterorumque Dei servorum; et quanto clerum sacris altaribus propinquiorem perspicis, tanto ei potiorem in locis congruis honorem impendere memineris; quatenus mediator Dei et hominum, te mediatorem cleri et plebis permanere faciat. > Stay firm and hold fast to the place delegated to you by God, by the > authority of Almighty God, and by this our present transmission, that is to > say, of all the bishops and of other servants of God; and when you see the > clergy draw near to the holy altar, remember to give them appropriate > honour, so that the Mediator between God and humanity may confirm you in > this position as the mediator between clergy and people. After the enthronement, the presiding prelate and the other bishops went to the altar, and the presiding prelate, ascending the steps of the altar and facing it, removed his mitre and intoned the solemn hymn of praise and thanksgiving Te Deum laudamus, that was continued by the choir. The officiating prelate read the hymn in silence continuously and quickly while the initial verses were still being chanted by the choir in poliphony. After finishing his quiet reading of the hymn at the altar and while the choir was still singing the same hymn, the presiding prelate left the altar and returned to the emperor's throne, standing at one of the steps of the throne at the emperor's right hand side. There the officiating prelate waited the conclusion of the singing of the Te Deum by the choir. While all the guests and participants of the coronation remained standing, the emperor remained seated in his throne, crowned and holding the sceptre. Once the singing of the Te Deum was concluded, the celebrating archbishop or bishop recited a few verses over the emperor, while the clergy and people present recited the responses. The first exchange was: V. Let your hand be strengthened and your right hand be exalted; R. Let justice and judgment be the foundations of your throne.V. Firmetur manus tua, et exaltetun dextera tua. R. Justitia, et judicium praeparatio sedis tuae. Those exchanges being finished, the officiating prelate recited two solemn prayers. During those prayers the emperor stood from the throne chair, and the archbishop remained next to him and to his right, at the steps of the throne, looking towards the Altar. The first of those two prayers was the prayer God who gave Moses victory... (Deus qui victrices Moysi...Oremus. Deus, qui victrices Moysi manus in oratione firmasti, qui quamvis aetate languesceret, infatigabili sanctitate pugnabat: ut dum Amalech iniquus vincitur, dum profanus nationum populus subjugatur, exterminatis alienigenis, hereditati tuae possessio copiosa serviret, opus manuum tuarum pia nostrae orationis exauditione confirma; habemus et nos apud te, sancte Pater, Dominum salvatorem, qui pro nobis manus suas extendit in cruce, per quem etiam precamur, Altissime, ut tua potentia suffragante, universorum hostium frangatur impietas, populusque tuus, cessante formidine, te solum timere condiscat. Per eumdem Christum Dominum nostrum); and the second was the prayer, God, inexplicable author of the world... (Deus, inenarrabilis auctor mundi...Oremus. Deus, inenarrabilis auctor mundi, conditor generis humani, confirmator regni, qui ex utero fidelis amici tui Patriarchae nostri Abrahae praeelegisti Regem saeculis profuturum, tu praesentem insignem Imperatorem hunc cum exercitu suo, per intercessionem beatae Mariae semper Virginis, et omnium Sanctorum, uberi bene + dictione locupleta; et in solium imperii firma stabilitate connecte: visita eum, sicut visitasti Moysen in rubo, Josue in praelio, Gedeonem in agro, Samuelem in templo, et illa eum siderea bene + dictione, ac sapientiae tuae rore perfunde, quam beatus David in psalterio et Salomon filius ejus, te remunerante, percepit de coelo. Sis ei contra acies inimicorum lorica, in adversis galea, in prosperis sapientia, in protectione clypeus sempiternus. Et praesta, ut gentes illi teneant fidem, proceres sui habeant pacem, diligant charitatem, abstineant se a cupiditate, loquantur justitiam, custodiant veritatem, et ita populus iste sub ejus imperio pullulet, coalitus benedictione aeternitatis, ut semper tripudiantes maneant in pace, ac victores. Quod ipse praestare dignetur, qui tecum vivit et regnat in unitate Spiritus Sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. R. Amen.). While the first prayer was for the whole people, the second prayer was an additional petition of God's blessings specifically for the newly crowned emperor, and while reciting it twice the presiding prelate produced the sign of the cross towards the monarch as an act of benediction. This prayer for the emperor had the following form of words: > Let us pray. God, inexplicable author of the world, creator of the > humankind, confirmer of kingdoms, Who from the descendants of Your faithful > friend, our Patriarch Abraham, pre-ordained the future King of the centuries > to come, may You deign to enrich this illustrious emperor here present, > together with his army, with an abundant blessing (here the sign of the > cross was made towards the emperor), by the intercession of the blessed ever > Virgin Mary, and of all the saints, and unite him in firm stability to the > imperial throne; visit him, as you visited Moses in the [burning] bush, > Joshua in battle, Gideon in the field and Samuel in the Temple; bestow upon > him same blessing (here the sign of the cross was again made towards the > emperor) from on high, and the same infusion with the dew of Your wisdom, > that the blessed David, in the Plsalter, and Solomon his son, received from > Heaven, by Your concession. May You be for him an armour against the enemy > hosts, a helmet in adversity, wisdom in prosperity, a perpetual shield of > protection. And grant that the peoples remain faithful unto him; his peers > maintain peace; love charity, abstain from greed, speak with justice, guard > the truth, and thus may this people under his empire grow, united by the > blessing of eternity, so that, always in triumph, they remain in peace, and > victorious. This may He vouchsafe to grant, Who with You lives and reigns in > unity with the Holy Spirit, forever and ever. Amen. The Coronation Mass resumed: from the Gospel until its conclusion Once the said prayers were finished, the celebrating archbishop or bishop left the right hand side of the monarch at the steps of the throne and returned to the altar. The celebration of the Mass was resumed from the point where it had been interrupted after the Gradual, that is to say, with the recitation of the Alleluia, or of the last verse of tract, or of the sequence. A prie-dieu was again placed in front of the throne, so that the emperor could kneel when appropriate, and, while the other sacred ministers were at the altar, the emperor's domestic chaplains again attended to him at the throne. For the reading of the Gospel, the emperor stood and removed the crown, that was delivered to one of his officers of state who stood on the side steps of the throne, bearing the crown on a cushion. At the end of the Gospel reading, the Gospel book was brought to the throne by the reading deacon for the emperor to kiss, a ceremony not prescribed by the Roman Pontifical, but that was customary in solemn Masses in the presence of the emperor. The emperor resumed the use of the crown once the reading of the Gospel was finished and after having kissed the Gospel book. After the Gospel there was no homily (a sermon was preached after the conclusion of the Mass), and the Mass continued as usual in the Tridentine form, with the recitation of the Nicene Creed followed by the offertory. At the offertory, after the initial prayers, and after the celebrating prelate had censed the offerings of bread and wine, the cross at the Altar, and the Altar itself, and after he handed the thurible to the deacon and was incensed himself, but before the washing of hands, the normal rite of Mass was again paused for a brief special ceremony in which the emperor presented gifts to the Church: the celebrating prelate went to his cathedra (in the case of the coronation of Pedro I, presided by the Bishop of Rio), or to a faldstool at the altar (in the case of the coronation of Pedro II, presided by the Archbishop of Salvador), and there waited for the emperor, who came from his throne, fully vested as always, and with the crown on his head and the sceptre in his right hand. Kneeling before the celebrating prelate, the emperor received from his officers of state a lit candle encrusted with gold coins, and delivered that candle to the prelate as a gift. The emperor also donated two pieces in the form of bread, one of gold, the other of silver. And after presenting the gifts, the emperor kissed the prelate's hand, rose to his feet, returned to the throne, and the liturgy of the Mass continued, with the celebrating prelate returning to the Altar for the rite of washing of hands. In the insensations by the deacon that followed the washing of the hands of the celebrant, the emperor was incensed separately from the people, and before them. Once all ceremonies of the offertory were concluded, a special secret prayer was recited for the emperorMunera, Domine, quaesumus, oblata sanctifica, ut et nobis Unigeniti tui Corpus et Sanguis fiant; et Imperatori nostro ad obtinendam animae corporisque salutem, et ad peragendum injunctum officium, te largiente, usquequaque proficiant. Per eumdem Dominun nostrum Jesum Christum Filium tuum, qui tecum vivit et regnat in unitate Spiritus Sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. R. Amen. after the day's proper secret. At the dialogue introducing the Preface, as the bishops removed their skullcaps and stood bareheaded in preparation for the consecration of the Eucharist, the emperor removed his crown and delivered it to be held by the same officer of state who bore it during the Gospel reading. The emperor also delivered his sceptre to another aide. The emperor remained without crown or sceptre until the Communion, and resumed their use immediately before the postcommunion prayer. At the Sanctus the emperor knelt for the Canon of the Mass as usual, and remained kneeling at the prie-dieu at the throne dais until the conclusion of the Eucharistic Prayer. After the Roman Canon, Mass continued normally, with the Pater Noster and the prayers that followed, the emperor standing or kneeling when appropriate. For the ceremony of the kiss of peace an instrumentum pacis was used, and the emperor received the greeting from the senior assistant bishop. For the reception of Holy Communion, after the celebrating archbishop or bishop had taken communion under the appearances of bread and wine, and after the rites in preparation for the communion of the faithful had taken place, the emperor descended from the throne and went to the altar. There, by special privilege, he ascended the altar steps, and, arriving near to the altar table, he knelt at the altar's highest step to receive Communion. He then kissed the celebrating Prelate's hand, and received the Eucharist, under the species of bread alone (as usual for the lay faithful and even for the clergy other than the celebrant). Though a few other coronation rites contained special privileges allowing for the reception of Communion under both kinds by the monarch on coronation day (such as the rite of coronation of the kings of France), the general coronation rite of the Roman Pontifical did not contemplate this. On the contrary, the rubrics of the Roman Pontifical expressly reiterated that the celebrant should drink the whole of the Eucharist under the appearance of wine, so that the monarch, though allowed to ascend to the altar, received Communion only under the appearance of bread. Only the celebrating prelate and the emperor received Communion during the Coronation Mass. After receiving Communion and consuming the Sacred Host, and after having said in silence his private devotional prayers customary upon the reception of the Eurcharist, and while the Communion antiphon was still being chanted by the choir, the emperor, still kneeling at the highest step of the Altar, performed ablutions with the chalice, that was then presented to him by the celebrating prelate. The celebrant also performed ablutions, and drank the contents of the chalice. Returning to the throne, the emperor resumed the use of his crown and sceptre, and rose from the throne chair to hear the prayers after Communion. After the prayer of the day, a special postcommunion prayer was recited for the emperorHaec, Domine, oblatio salutaris, famulum tuum N. Imperatorem nostrum ab omnibus tueatur adversis; quatenus et ecclesiasticae pacis obtineat tranquillitatem, et post hujus temporis decursum ad aeternam perveniat haereditatem. Per Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum Filium tuum, qui tecum vivit et regnat in unitate Spiritus Sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. R. Amen. Mass thereafter continued normally until its conclusion. For the Last Gospel, the emperor again, for the third and last time, removed his crown, and remained uncrowned until the conclusion of the sermon that followed the Mass, the promulgation of indulgences and the imparting of the solemn blessing, as described below, resuming the use of the crown as soon as the blessing was given. After the Mass: final rites in the Church =The sermon and the solemn final blessing= Immediately after the Last Gospel, the Mass being finished, a sermon was preached. The emperor, without crown as described above, but holding the sceptre, sat on the throne to hear the sermon. The sermon for the coronation of Pedro I was preached by the friar preacher of the imperial household, and the sermon for the coronation of Pedro II was preached by the abbot general of the Order of St. Benedict in Brazil. The theme of this last sermon was the anointing of Solomon by Zadok the Priest and Nathan the Prophet. After the sermon, the indulgences granted by the presiding prelate were announced, and the prelate imparted upon all those present the solemn pontifical blessing, according to the form contained in the Roman Pontifical for use in special occasions. The rubrics of this promulgation of indulgences and solemn blessing were contained in the Roman Pontifical under the heading Ritus et Formula Absolutionis et Benedictionis Pontificalis post homiliam seu sermonem infra Missae solemnis celebratione. The rubrics of the coronation rite also specifically called for this blessing to be given at the end of the coronation liturgy. Once the solemn pontifical blessing was given, the emperor resumed the use of his crown. The said blessing concluded the liturgical acts of the coronation. After the solemn blessing, in the case of the coronation of Pedro II, the emperor commanded the exit procession to start, and in procession departed the church. =The civil oaths at the coronation of Pedro I in 1822= In the case of the 1822 coronation of Emperor Pedro I, however, the liturgy of the coronation proper was followed by oaths that were taken by the emperor and by representatives of the people, still inside the church. Only after those oaths were taken, Emperor Pedro I commanded the exit procession to start and departed the church. Those oaths taken at the conclusion of Pedro I's coronation were religious in character, because they were made on the Gospels in the presence of the clergy and inside the cathedral where the coronation had taken place, but they were not composed by the Church, and they should not be confused with the oath known as the profession, made by the emperor during the introductory rites of the coronation ceremony. The profession made at the initial stages of the coronation rite is a liturgical oath, and its text is prescribed by the Church in the Roman Pontifical. On the other hand, the oaths taken at the conclusion of Pedro I's coronation were neither liturgical nor prescribed by the Church, being instead oaths instituted by the imperial government, that is, by the civil authority. Princess Maria da Glória watch from the honour box at the second floor, opposite the throne. Painting by Jean-Baptiste Debret The two oaths made by Pedro I at his coronation had a different focus, contemplating a different set of promises. The ecclesiastical oath before the prayer of solemn blessing, the litany of the saints and the anointing was a traditional, centuries-old vow that focused on the rights of the Church and on a generic pledge by the monarch to honour and to do good by his nobles and other subjects. The civil oath taken still at the cathedral but immediately after the conclusion of the coronation liturgy was a promise to rule according to law and to abide by the future Constitution that would be adopted for the Empire. Therefore, the two oaths taken by Emperor Pedro I at his coronation complemented each other, as the promises made in the civil oath added to those of the ecclesiastical vow. No such civil oaths were taken at the conclusion of Pedro II' coronation in 1841, because in 1840 he had already taken, before the Imperial Parliament, the oath prescribed by article 102 of the Empire's Constitution. Therefore, in the coronation of Pedro II, the sermon and the final blessing were immediately followed by the exit procession and by the emperor's departure from the Church, whereas in the coronation of Pedro I the sermon and the final blessing were followed by the ceremony of the taking of the civil oaths. This ceremony took place as follows. Aides brought a credence table to the dais of the throne. This table was placed on top of the steps, in front of the throne but to its right and not at the centre of the dais, with the emperor still sitting on the throne Chair, with the crown on his head and holding his sceptre. The Book of the Gospels was placed on the said table. The Bishop Major Chaplain, who had presided over the coronation, then took the book of the Gospels and brought it to the emperor. The Minister of Justice prompted the emperor to recite the words of the oath: the said minister made a profound reverence to the emperor and read the formula of the emperor's oath, that was repeated by the emperor from his throne Chair. While taking the oath, the seated emperor placed his hand on the Gospel book that was held by the Bishop Major Chaplain. This was followed by acclamations prompted by the king of arms, that were repeated by all those present at the cathedral. After the said acclamations, the attorneys-general representing the provinces of the empire, the president and members of Rio's city council and the representatives sent by other municipal councils were led from their places to the front of the throne, below the steps. It is worth noting that Pedro I's coronation took place in 1822 just a few months after he declared Brazil's independence from Portugal and was acclaimed as emperor, and before a Parliament could be elected. Therefore, Brazil still lacked a national Legislature, and the members of the council of attorneys-general of the provinces, the members of the capital's municipal council and the representatives of the other municipal councils that sent delegates to attend the coronation acted as the representatives of the people. The Gospel Book was again placed on the table in front of the throne. The Minister of Justice then read aloud the formula of the collective oath of the provincial attorneys- general, members of Rio's city council and representatives sent by other municipal councils. That oath was promise of allegiance to the newly crowned emperor and his successors and to the laws of the Empire. Immediately thereafter those officers, one by one, bowing to the emperor, ascended the steps of the throne, and, kneeling at the highest step before the above- mentioned table, placed their hands on the Gospel Book and confirmed their acceptance of the oath of allegiance that the Minister had read by saying \\"I do so swear\\". Each officer then rose and descended from the throne steps. The texts of the oaths prescribed by the imperial government to be taken by Emperor Pedro I and by the provincial attorneys-general, members of Rio's city council and representatives of other councils were published in a government decision dated 27 November 1822 that is included in the official collection of the Empire's legislation. The oath taken by Emperor Pedro I was worded in Latin and the oath taken by the officers representing the people was worded in Portuguese. After all the officers who were required to take the oath of allegiance had done so, Emperor Pedro I commanded the start of the exit procession, and departed from the cathedral. Ceremonies and festivities outside the church For the exit procession, all participants of the cortège left the cathedral in the same order of their entrance. The emperor, from the moment he descended the throne steps to enter the procession, was flanked by knights who bore a canopy over his head, and he remained under that pall for the duration of the cortège. The emperor's departure from the church was followed by other ceremonies, that in the case of the coronation of Pedro I took place inside the Imperial Palace of the City, and in the case of the coronation of Pedro II took place in the temporary building connecting the church to the palace, and known as coronation balcony. The first of those ceremonies was an act of homage to the newly crowned emperor by his ecclesiastical and lay subjects: with the emperor still crowned and sitting on a throne (in the throne room of the palace, in the case of Pedro I, or in a hall of the coronation Balcony, in the case of Pedro II), the clergy that took part in the coronation passed by, stopped facing the throne, bowed deeply, from the waist, and chanted, one by one, the Latin formula \\"ad multos annos\\", meaning for many years. After this act of homage by the clergy, the homage of the lay subjects took place, with a different format that took the form of a baciamano: Ministers, officers of state and nobles came and passed in front of the throne, performing their act of homage by ascending the steps to the throne, genuflecting and kissing the emperor's hand, before descending the steps of the throne. This act of homage by kissing hands as a sign of fidelity and obedience was known in Portuguese as beija-mão. After those acts of homage were concluded, the emperors presented themselves to the public: Emperor Pedro II approached the front of the coronation Balcony, and Emperor Pedro I went to a palace balcony. With the emperor in full view of the people, wearing his robes, crown and sceptre, heralds sounded trumpets, drums beat, banners were unruffled, and a king of arms proclaimed that the emperor's consecration and coronation was accomplished. As part of this proclamation, the emperor's title was declared in full, and triple acclamations were prompted. After the acclamations, gun salutes followed, amidst other spontaneous popular acclamations. Leaving the balcony, the emperor then went to a hall where, seating on a throne, he received for a baciamano other civil servants, senators, members of the Chamber of Deputies and members of the imperial orders, ladies of distinction, etc., and other invited guests. For this reception of people who greeted the emperor after his balcony appearance, he was already divested of the crown, which was placed on a cushion next to the throne. Afterwards, the emperor received in the throne room of the imperial palace of the city delegations (from the city council of Rio de Janeiro, from the Senate, from the Chamber of Deputies, etc.) who came to present their loyal addresses commemorating the coronation. Later, having removed his robes of state, but wearing gala uniform, the emperor offered a banquet to his guests. Pedro II's coronation Banquet was served in the City Palace at 6 p.m. A dinner for all functionaries of the imperial household was served after the imperial banquet. In the case of the 1841 coronation, from 8 p.m. until 10 p.m., after the coronation banquet was concluded and Emperor Pedro II had retired to his private appartmens at the City Palace, ordinary members of the public who were decently dressed were allowed to visit the adjoining coronation balcony building and to view the Crown Jewels on display. Finally, the emperor and his family returned to the Imperial Palace of St. Christopher.

Main event match The main event was a Baseball Bat match, in which The Headhunters (Headhunter A and Headhunter B) competed against Miguelito Perez and Crash the Terminator. After a back and forth action, a Headhunter hit a Moonsault on Crash for the win. Reception Wrestling Recaps staff gave mixed reviews on the event for being only an average event by writing \\"The scaffold match and main event are worth checking out but the rest is a pass. I’m in the middle on this one as it is an important show (see below) but really only had two matches worth seeing.\\" The Wrestling Revolution staff wrote \\"Overall, a TERRIBLE show, made even worse by a terrible crowd. If it wasn’t a weapon-shot or in the scaffold, they booed and called it “boring.” The main event was the only thing on this show even close to being worth seeing. Most of this show was boring and repetitive. It felt like everything was “eight minute match, dirty/DQ finish, brawl afterwards.” I believe that the squash at the beginning and Douglas vs. Sandman were the only matches on this show that didn’t have brawls after them. Not a good start for the Paul Heyman Era in ECW. Thankfully, it eventually got a lot better.\\" Mike Campbell of 411Mania gave a score of 5, stating \\"It's fun at times, especially the two tag matches, but this is not a good show in the least.\\" Results References Category:UltraClash Category:1993 in professional wrestling Category:1993 in Pennsylvania Category:Professional wrestling in Philadelphia Category:Events in Philadelphia Category:September 1993 events in the United States ","title":"UltraClash (1993)"},{"id":"56174610","text":"UltraClash (1998) was the second and final UltraClash professional wrestling supercard event produced by Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) held at the ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on September 19, 1998.

Its morphology resembles the morphology of colonial cnidarians, such as sea pens or siphonophores.  Description  Pambikalbae had a broad, frondose-shaped body composed of multiple vanes extending from an axial stem, and containing a serial series of chambers. Specimens of Pambikalbae found thus far have measured approximately 20 to 30 cm in length, with a width of 12 cm at the widest point of the frondose-body, and 6.6 cm wide at the stem.  Diversity  Pambikalbae is a monospecific genus, with only one known species, Pambikalbae hasenohrae.  Discovery  Pambikalbae hasenohrae was discovered within a fossiliferous exposure on the Nilpena pastoral property in the Flinders Ranges of South Australia. Pamela Hasenohr, an amateur geologist, found and brought the Pambikalbae fossils to the attention of Richard Jenkins, a research associate of the South Australian Museum. Richard Jenkins and his associate Chris Nedin collected five Pambikalbae specimens from this exposure, and published their description of the genus in 2007. In this publication, they named the type species of the genus, P. hasenohrae, after Pamela Hasenohr.  Distribution  Pambikalbae hasenohrae specimens have been found preserved in channel sandstones on the Nilpena pastoral property in the Flinders Ranges of South Australia. These sandstones occur directly below the Ediacaran Member of the Rawnsley Quartzite, a stratigraphic layer rich with Ediacaran fossils that was deposited during cycles of marine transgression.  Taphonomy  Pambikalbae hasenohrae fossils consist of both surface molds and internal casts. It is likely that the hollow chambers of these specimens were partly filled with sediments before their entire bodies were buried, preventing the bodies from being entirely flattened during burial and preserving the three-dimensional structure of both the internal and external parts of the original organisms. The lithified sands that occupy the once hollow parts of the specimens exhibit fine laminations and small scale crossbedding, which indicates that the specimens were buried progressively, not instantly. This gradual burial may have created enough time for currents to carry sediments into the internal chambers before the entire organism was buried.  Ecology  Pambikalbae was likely a benthic, sessile, heterotrophic marine suspension feeder. The chambers of Pambikalbae were open to the external environment, allowing water to enter and exit freely. These chambers were likely lined with flagellate cells or cilia, which would capture detrital food particles suspended in the water.

Michigan, 489 U.S. 803 (1989), is a case in the Supreme Court of the United States holding that states may not tax federal pensions if they exempt their own state pensions from taxation.. In the 1930s, the federal and state governments began to charge income tax on salaries paid to each other's employees. However, reciprocal treatment was required under the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity. The Court's ruling extended the reciprocity to pensions, since they are a form of deferred compensation for services previously rendered by an employee.  Background   Intergovernmental immunity  In McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), the Supreme Court held that Maryland could not tax the Second Bank of the United States, as it would interfere with the bank's right to exist under federal law. The decision gave rise to the principle of intergovernmental immunity, which was gradually extended from government agencies to their employees. In Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie (1842), the Court held that states could not tax the salaries of federal officials. In Collector v. Day (1870), the Court also held that the federal government could not tax the salaries of state officials. In 1938, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt asked Congress to remove the reciprocal tax exemption for federal and state employees. The Supreme Court subsequently overturned its precedents from the 19th century. In Helvering v. Gerhardt (1938), the Court ruled that state salaries would not be exempt from federal income tax unless it caused an \\"actual and substantial\\" burden on the governmental functions of the state. Exempting state employees from federal taxation would intrude on the \\"national sovereign power to tax\\" and create \\"a privileged class of taxpayers.\\" In Graves v. New York (1939), the Court held that federal salaries were also subject to \\"nondiscriminatory\\" taxation by the states. In the Public Salary Tax Act (1939), which was codified as , Congress clarified the circumstances in which governmental salaries could be taxed. The Act stated that federal salaries could only be taxed if the state tax \\"does not discriminate against such officer or employee because of the source of such compensation.\\" If the state exempted its own employees from taxation, then it cannot tax discriminate against federal employees by subjecting federal salaries to taxation.  Case background  Paul S. Davis served the federal government as a lawyer for the Securities and Exchange Commission and an administrative law judge. He retired from the federal government in 1980. From 1979 to 1984, he paid $4,299 in Michigan income taxes on his federal retirement benefits. At the time, Michigan exempted its own retirement benefits from taxation. However, pensions paid by the federal government, other states, and private industry were only entitled to a $7,500 deduction. In Memphis Bank & Trust Co. v. Garner (1983), the Supreme Court held that states could not levy franchise taxes on federal bond interest if they exempted their own state bonds from taxation. Upon learning of the decision, Davis filed amended Michigan tax returns to 1979, claiming tax refunds on his federal retirement benefits. The Michigan Commissioner of Revenue, the Michigan Court of Claims, and the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled that Davis was not entitled to a refund. The Michigan courts ruled that he was not covered by the nondiscrimination provisions of , as he was retired and therefore no longer a federal employee. Davis appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a rare occurrence, Davis argued his own case pro se before the Supreme Court. Although state attorneys general often argue their own cases when they are sued in an official capacity, it is unusual for private parties to appear pro se at oral arguments. Davis divided his time with Michael K. Kellogg from the Solicitor General's office, who appeared for the United States as amicus curiae.  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court ruled 8-1 in favor of Davis. The majority opinion, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, held that states could not tax federal retirement benefits if they exempted their own state retirement benefits from taxation. Since retirement benefits were earned by employees as deferred compensation, federal pensions are entitled to the nondiscrimination provisions of , which covered \\"pay or compensation.\\" The state of Michigan could remedy its discriminatory taxation by either removing the tax on federal pensions or levying a tax on its own pensions. In a lone dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens argued that the tax was not discriminatory because it treated federal employees the same as other Michigan taxpayers. Since most Michigan taxpayers did not receive retirement benefits from the state, they were also subject to the Michigan income tax.  Aftermath  Michigan chose to extend the income tax exemption to federal retirement benefits. Davis received $4,299 of tax refunds. Fourteen states that exempted their own state pensions from taxation had to refund billions of dollars to federal retirees. The National Association of Retired Federal Employees, which filed an amicus brief in the case, established the Paul S. Davis scholarship in honor of the plaintiff in the case.

In the 1860s, Coopers Creek was settled during the Victorian gold rush and, throughout its history, gold, copper and lime have been mined there. Today, Coopers Creek is effectively limited to two camping sites, the first near the site of the mining town and the second to the east at Bruntons Bridge. Ruins from the town's mining history, and the Copper Mine Hotel are all of the town's history which survives. Geography Coopers Creek is in the Shire of Baw Baw in Victoria's Gippsland region. It is located in the Great Dividing Range, in the steep forested slopes of the Thomson River valley. The original township was located around the confluence of the Thomson River and Coopers Creek which is where mining operations were centred. The area gazetted as Coopers Creek is partially bounded by the Thomson River and by a number of roads in the area. It is partially within the Baw Baw National Park, the Erica State Forest and the Boola Boola State Forest. The area used for mining is now included in the Coopers Creek Copper Mine Historic and Cultural Features Reserve. History Alluvial gold from a copper, silver, gold and platinum deposit in the area was found in the Thomson River upstream of Coopers Creek resulted in a number of mining claims being made in the area during the Victorian gold rush. However, very little gold was actually discovered in Coopers Creek. It was the discovery of the first copper deposit in Victoria, in 1864, which led to the survival of the small township. Initial smelting conducted in Coopers Creek was unsuccessful and unprofitable due to lowered copper prices and the large quantity of firewood being consumed in the process. The township of Coopers Creek took shape around the copper mine and smelting works located around the confluence of the Thomson River and Coopers Creek and was described as having \\"a lively appearance\\" and that it had potential to become \\"a flourishing little place\\". The Copper Mine Hotel began operations during the 1860s to support the growing population with both accommodation and as a pub. The population of Coopers Creek was large enough, that, on 1 January 1868 a post office was opened in the town. A new source of copper was found in 1878 and led to the significant increase in mining infrastructure, including a new crushing mill, kilns and smelting furnaces, and an increase to 70 men being employed at the mine. By 1880, however, the copper shoot found two years earlier had been exhausted and the mine fell into relative disuse for twenty to thirty years. The post office, opened twenty- five years earlier, closed on 11 September 1893. Though attempts were made to begin mining at Coopers Creek in the late 1800s, it was not until 1910 that large-scale mining began again. Earlier wishes that the train line from Moe to Erica, around by rail to the east, be extended to Coopers Creek were realised around 1910, with the Platina station on the Walhalla railway line being constructed at Coopers Creek. New leases were taken up by the Gippsland Copper and Platinum Mining and Smelting Company in around 1910 with the intention to bring new technology and increase the mining of copper at Coopers Creek. The last gold mined from Happy-Go-Lucky was sold to the copper smelting works at Coopers Creek before its closure in 1915. The Walhalla mine closed around the same time. Operations at Coopers Creek ceased in 1915 following the pattern of mine closures in the area. Following the collapse of the copper mining industry in the 1910s, lime instead became the main industry at Coopers Creek. There was a lime quarry, underground mine and kilns near the township in the late 1920s. Around this time accommodation in Coopers Creek consisted of four cottages, a bunk house and tents. Despite the closure of Walhalla's largest gold mine in the 1910s, the lime exports from Coopers Creek meant that the Walhalla railway line continued to operate regularly following a significant decline in rail traffic through the 1930s. Woodcutting had also been a major industry in the Coopers Creek area, mainly to support the mining operations by providing firewood and construction materials. This tree felling had a significant impact on the area, however, as, by the 1930s, there was such a shortage of trees that they needed to be felled in adjacent valleys. The 1939 Black Friday bushfires further devastated the Coopers Creek area and forced a large part of the population to move into larger towns and cities to seek employment. Lime quarrying continued in Coopers Creek until 1952 when the last quarry closed. Around the same time, the Copper Mine Hotel () closed after around 100 years of operation from various buildings. The final building, apparently the only one left standing, became derelict and burnt down in 1999, leaving the original chimneys. It has since been rebuilt, maintaining its original design, but was closed to the public in 2007 and is now a private residence. Mining operations returned to Coopers Creek in the 1960s, with the copper mine being cleared out and building of a new smelter being completed in 1969. The renewed mining operation was short lived, however, ending in 1971 due to the falling price of copper. The Long Tunnel Extended Mine at Walhalla was opened for tourism some years later, and a number of pieces of equipment and buildings were moved there from Coopers Creek. Modern uses Today, Coopers Creek consists only of two campsites, the first near the location of the original township and mine and the second to the east of the original township at Bruntons Bridge. The Coopers Creek campsite is a popular camping site and includes a long drop toilet, picnic tables, a boat ramp as well as walking and four-wheel drive tracks. Ruins from the town's mining history can also be found around the camping sites, as can the ruins of the Copper Mine Hotel which is now closed to the public.

Jacob experienced the First World War whilst serving on the western front in 1918. This led him to become a pacifist. He went on to become a radical critic of German militarism writing articles about German secret rearmament and the Feme murders. From 1923 he wrote a series of articles for Die Weltbühne under the pseudonym \\"Old Soldier\\". However, in 1928 he was prosecuted for treason and sentenced to nine months imprisonment. Jacob left Germany for Strasbourg 1932. Here he set up an independent press service. However having been enticed to Basle by the undercover Gestapo agent Hans Wesemann, Jacob was kidnapped in March 1935. Jacob had known Wesemann for some time and had indeed served as best man at Wesemann's wedding. Wesemann was subsequently sentenced to three years in jail for the kidnapping. This was investigated by the Swiss police officer Anton Ganz, who went to London to interview such people as Dora Fabian and Karl Korsch. The subsequent death of Fabian alongside her friend Mathilde Wurm led to concern that they had been murdered rather than the suicide which was the verdict of the coroner's court. This contributed to the climate of opinion which led to a successful campaign for his release from Germany. This campaign was based on Swiss diplomatic pressure and German exile protests. Upon his return to Switzerland he was deported to France. Here he continued his work until the outbreak of the Second world War. He was interned with his wife in the south of France in 1939/40. However they managed to escape from Marseille travelling to Portugal in 1941. Jacob was one of the refugees aided by Varian Fry.\\"Some of the 2,000 people assisted by Varian Fry and the Emergency Rescue Committee.\\" Varian Fry Institute, 12 February 2008.

Of Bedouin descent, she was born Tarouf Abdel-Kheir Adam () in Saudi Arabia, but moved to Egypt soon after her second marriage to an Egyptian man in 1978 . Many Arab music historians agree that she was forced out of Saudi Arabia at the orders of then Saudi King Khalid due to her musical concerts considered risque in Saudi Arabia at that time.; in 1983 she became an Egyptian citizen. Considered one of the first female Saudi singers, Etab started singing in the 1960s, and performed at weddings with Sarah Osman and the ʻoud player Hayat Saleh. She recorded more than 15 albums and appeared in three movies. She became ill with cancer in 1997, and died in Cairo on 19 August 2007. Her last few months saw her traveling between Cairo, Dubai and Saudi Arabia for treatment but her cancer had already spread and became terminal. She died at a Cairo hospital practically penniless. She is now considered an icon in her native Saudi Arabia and has regained her reputation as a courageous artist who defied convention to achieve her dreams. She had one daughter from her first marriage to a Saudi man. This daughter, who was a well-known radio presenter and producer, also died of cancer at a young age. She also had a son and daughter from her estranged Egyptian husband whom she had divorced after accusing him of stealing her money. Etab was an advocate for women in music, and member of the Union of Arab Artists and the Musicians Syndicate in Egypt.

The church is a part of the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania. It is located at 301 East 9th Street and is an active worship center. History England, The Netherlands and Sweden each claimed the territory flanking the Delaware River. Swedish colonists established a permanent settlement at Upland, New Sweden (now Chester, Pennsylvania), by 1644. Dutch soldiers, under the command of Director-General Peter Stuyvesant, arrived in a squadron of ships in 1655, and seized the Swedish colony. It was renamed New Netherlands, although Swedish and Finnish settlers were allowed to remain. The English seized New Netherlands in 1664, at the beginning of the Second Anglo- Dutch War. The Dutch formally ceded the colony to England a decade later, in the 1674 Treaty of Westminster. The Swedes had set aside a plot of land on the south side of 3rd Street, east of Market Street, as a burial ground. It is believed that they never erected a church building, but held religious services in a nearby blockhouse. Old St. Paul's Church Old Saint Paul's Church (built 1702, demolished 1850) Marker designating location of Old Saint Paul's Church in Old Swedish Burial Ground in Chester, Pennsylvania In 1700, Reverend Evan Evans was sent to the province of Pennsylvania by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. He is frequently mentioned in the society records as traveling to Chester, Chichester, Concord and Radnor. St. Paul's Church was erected on site of the Swedish burial ground in 1702-1703. The original church was built of brick - in length, in width, and in height - with a wooden steeple containing the bell. The former Quaker Anglican missionary George Keith is known to have preached at St. Paul's twice in 1702. The St. Paul's Church parish included St. Martin's Church in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania and St. John's Church in Concord. In 1704, Reverend Henry Nichols was sent by The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts as a missionary to work in all three churches. In 1707, Reverend Evan Evans, travelled to England and returned the same year with a pewter Holy Communion Service, a gift from Queen Anne to the parish. Inscribed on these are the words \\"Anna Regina, in usum Eccelesiae Anglicanae apud Philadelphiani, A.D., 1708.\\" The communion service was displayed at the east end of the church. Memorial stone for James Sandilands (1692), merchant in colonial Chester, Pennsylvania Missionaries were sent from Philadelphia to preach to the congregation, however problems arose due to the distance the preachers had to travel and the church began to have ministers from the Swedish Church in Wilmington, Delaware preside over the congregation. Israel Acrelius, the noted Swedish Lutheran missionary and priest was a church minister at St. Paul's in 1756. In the west end of the Old St. Paul's Church was a large grey slab of sandstone erected to the memory of James Sandilands, an early landowner and merchant in Chester, with the following inscription: ::\\"Here lies interr-d the bodie of James Sandelands, marchant, in Upland, in Pennsylvania, who departed this mortal life, Aprile the 12, 1692, aged 56 years, and his wife, Ann Sandelands\\" In 1835, extensive repairs were made to the church with an increase in the number of pews and the addition of a gallery in the west end with a large main entrance underneath. The old St. Paul's Church on Third Street was demolished in 1850. Current church In 1859, a new church was built on the opposite side of Third Street. The new church was built of pointed stone in Gothic style with a spire one hundred and twenty-four feet high. In 1872, the church was again remodeled. On June 3, 1877, the church was struck by lightning and suffered damage. On March 19, 1884, the church caught fire and suffered additional damage. In April 1900, the current St. Paul's church was established at the 9th and Madison Street. The English Gothic architecture building is built of granite with doorways and windows of Indiana limestone. The architect was William Provost, Jr. In 1956, St. Paul's Church received a memorial gift of an Aeolian-Skinner organ. Old Swedish Burial Ground Old Swedish Burial Ground Pennsylvania Historical Marker St. Paul's Cemetery Also known as St. Paul's Burying Ground and St. Paul's Cemetery. John Morton Memorial John Morton, a signer to the Declaration of Independence is buried at the old St. Paul's burial ground. His remains lay beneath a plain marble obelisk, 11 feet in height. The inscription on the west side of the memorial reads: ::\\"Dedicated to the memory of John Morton, A member of the First American Congress from the State of Pennsylvania, Assembled in New York in 1765, and of the next Congress, assembled in Philadelphia in 1774. Born A.D., 1724 - Died April 1777.\\" The inscription of the east side of the memorial reads: ::\\"In voting by States upon the question of the Independence of the American Colonies, there was a tie until the vote of Pennsylvania was given, two members of which voted in the affirmative, and two in the negative. The tie continued until the vote of the last member, John Morton, decided the promulgation of the Glorious Diploma of American Freedom.\\" The inscription on the south side of the memorial reads: ::\\"In 1775, while speaker of the Assembly of Pennsylvania, John Morton was elected a Member of Congress, and in the ever memorable session of 1776, he attended that august body for the last time, establishing his name in the grateful remembrance of the American People by signing the Declaration of Independence.\\" The inscription on the north side of the memorial reads: ::\\"John Morton being censured by his friends for his boldness in giving his casting vote for the Declaration of Independence, his prophetic spirit dictated from his death bed the following message to them: 'Tell them they shall live to see the hour when they shall acknowledge it to have been the most glorious service I ever rendered to my country.\\" David Lloyd David Lloyd, personal lawyer to William Penn, Attorney General of Pennsylvania, six term Speaker of the Pennsylvania General Assembly and Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Colony is buried at old St. Paul's burial ground along with his wife Grace.

A UFC Heavyweight Championship bout between current champion Stipe Miocic and current UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Daniel Cormier headlined the event. They also served as the head coaches of The Ultimate Fighter: Undefeated. If successful, Cormier would become only the second fighter to be champion in two divisions simultaneously (after Conor McGregor who won the UFC Lightweight Championship at UFC 205 when he was the reigning UFC Featherweight Champion) as well as the fifth overall to win a title in different divisions. This was the third time in UFC history that champions in different divisions fought for the same title, following UFC 94 and UFC 205. A UFC Featherweight Championship bout between current champion Max Holloway and Brian Ortega was expected to take place at the event. However, on July 4, Holloway was pulled from the fight due to \\"concussion like symptoms\\". As a result, Ortega was removed from the card as well. Gökhan Saki was expected to face Khalil Rountree Jr. at UFC 219. However, Saki pulled out of the fight citing a leg injury. The pairing eventually took place at this event. Paulo Costa was scheduled to face Uriah Hall at UFC Fight Night: Barboza vs. Lee. However, Costa pulled out of the fight in mid-March with an arm injury. In turn, promotion officials elected to pull Hall from that event entirely and rescheduled the pairing for this event. The Ultimate Fighter: Live lightweight winner Michael Chiesa was expected to face former WEC and UFC Lightweight Champion Anthony Pettis at UFC 223, but was pulled from the bout due to multiple cuts from a broken window as a result of the Team SBG bus melee. The bout eventually took place at this event. Yancy Medeiros was expected to face Mike Perry at the event. However, he pulled out of the fight in late-June citing a rib injury and was replaced by Paul Felder. At the weigh-ins, Chiesa weighed in at 157.5 pounds, 1.5 pounds over the lightweight non-title fight limit of 156 pounds. His bout against Pettis was contested at catchweight and he forfeited 30 percent of his purse.

He was suffect consul for the nundinium November-December AD 98 with Publius Julius Lupus as his colleague.Ladislav Vidman (ed.), Fasti ostienses (Praha: Academia, 1982), p. 94 He is also known by the shorter form of his name, Quintus Bittius Proculus.See the examples provided by Olli Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature in the Roman Empire, (Helsinski: Societas Scientiarum Fenica, 1992), p. 120 Proculus' family connections have been a matter of dispute. A number of scholars have attempted to connect him to the suffect consul of the year 76, Marcus Fulvius Gillo. Some have suggested that he was the son of the older Gillo; others that he was adopted by the older man. In his monograph on Roman naming practices, Olli Salomies finds either possibility unlikely, and points out the more likely possibilities are that \\"he could be a Bittius adopted by a Q. Fulvius; or he could be a Bittius whose mother was a sister of, or in some other way related to, M. Fulvius Gillo.\\"Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature, p. 121 Pliny the Younger refers to him in passing as the stepfather of his second wife, which would make him the husband of Pompeia Celerina.Pliny, Epistulae, IX.13 The cursus honorum of Proculus is known only piecemeal. The earliest office attested for him is prefect of the aerarii Saturnii, which he held as the colleague of Publicius Certus, which he would have held after being praetor; Mireille Corbier dated his tenure in this office to the years 96 and 97.Corbier, L'aerarium saturni et l'aerarium militare; Administration et prosopographie sénatoriale, Publications de l'École française de Rome, 24 (Rome: École Française de Rome, 1974), p. 118 This financial office usually directly led to its officeholder attaining the consulate, but the prosecution of Pliny the Younger, although it failed to convict Certus, prevented him from reaching that office. The other office Proculus is known to have held is proconsular governor of Asia; an inscription at Cyzicus allows his tenure to be dated to 115/116. Werner Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 12 (1982), pp. 359f Proculus is attested to have been admitted to the Arval Brethren by the year 101. The inscriptions of this priesthood attest he attended their rituals in the years 105, 117, and 118.

Background The event was headlined by a UFC Lightweight Championship bout between the undefeated current champion Khabib Nurmagomedov and former featherweight and lightweight champion Conor McGregor. McGregor captured the lightweight title at UFC 205, when he was the reigning featherweight champion. McGregor never defended the title, he took some time off in 2017 due to the birth of his first son and later venturing himself in a boxing match against Floyd Mayweather Jr. (in which he lost). The UFC originally planned an interim title bout between Nurmagomedov and The Ultimate Fighter: Team Lesnar vs. Team dos Santos welterweight winner Tony Ferguson, but it was canceled due to Khabib having medical issues related to his weight cut on weigh-in day. Ferguson eventually won the interim title at UFC 216 against Kevin Lee. Ferguson was then expected to meet Nurmagomedov at UFC 223, with the winner being crowned the undisputed champion (as McGregor would be stripped of the title as soon as the bout took place). In turn, it was scrapped once again (fourth time) as Ferguson got injured, and after several possibilities for an opponent, Nurmagomedov eventually won the vacant title against Al Iaquinta. That card was also marked by an attack on a bus containing several fighters scheduled to compete at the event (including Nurmagomedov and two teammates), performed by McGregor and his crew. Jussier Formiga was previously scheduled to face Sergio Pettis in January 2017 at UFC Fight Night: Rodríguez vs. Penn. However, Formiga pulled out of the fight for undisclosed reasons. The pairing was rescheduled for this event. On October 1, Sean O'Malley announced that he was pulled from a bout against José Alberto Quiñónez after failing a US Anti- Doping Agency (USADA) drug test. In turn, promotion officials elected to remove Quiñónez from the card and he will be rescheduled for a future event.

Viewership In Nurmagomedov's home country of Russia, the fight set the viewership record for the country's most- watched MMA event. On Russian channel Match TV, where the event began airing at 05:00 MSK and the Nurmagomedov-McGregor fight after 07:00 MSK, the fight was watched by more than 4million viewers and reached a peak viewership rating of 67.5% for the time slot in the capital Moscow. In the United Kingdom, the fight was watched by 1,282,500 viewers on pay television subscription channel BT Sport 1, including 260,700 viewers for the live 01:00 broadcast and 1,021,800 viewers for the 06:00 replay. Nurmagomedov-McGregor post-fight controversy Seconds after the fight, Nurmagomedov climbed out of the octagon and charged toward McGregor's cornerman Dillon Danis. Soon after, McGregor and Abubakar Nurmagomedov (cousin of Khabib) also tried to climb out of the octagon, but a scuffle broke out between them. Back in the octagon, McGregor was then attacked by two of Nurmagomedov's cornermen: Zubaira Tukhugov and Esed Emiragaev. As a result of the incident, Nurmagomedov's payment for the fight was withheld by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) pending an investigation into his actions. Tukhugov was scheduled to fight on October 27 at UFC Fight Night: Volkan vs. Smith against Artem Lobov, McGregor's teammate who was confronted by Nurmagomedov in April 2018. Nurmagomedov appeared at the post-fight interview and apologized to the NSAC, saying he was provoked by the McGregor team's trash-talk targeting his family, nation, and religion, as well as the UFC 223 bus incident. Nurmagomedov later told Russian media that he was triggered by a number of insults he heard from Danis during the match, including anti-Muslim slurs. The NSAC filed a formal complaint against both McGregor and Nurmagomedov and the final hearing was initially scheduled to take place in November. On October 12, they announced both fighters received a suspension for ten days come October 15 and a hearing would be held on October 24. On October 24, the NSAC unanimously voted to release half of Nurmagomedov's payout immediately. The commission also voted to issue temporary suspensions for both fighters and ordered them to appear in person for a further hearing in December to resolve the case. On January 29, 2019, the NSAC announced a nine month suspension for Nurmagomedov and a $500,000 fine. The agreement also includes a potential suspension reduction of up to three months if he delivers to the commission a public service announcement on anti-bullying. To receive the reduction, the commission must approve the PSA and its distribution plan. Additionally, Nurmagomedov can only receive credit based on the time he submits the PSA. McGregor was suspended for six months and given a $50,000 fine. In separate agreements, Abubakar Nurmagomedov and Tukhugov were each suspended one year for their roles in the melee. All suspensions are retroactive to the day of the event. A few days later, Nurmagomedov stated that he would not opt to do the PSA stating “The state of Nevada is where drugs, prostitution and gambling are officially permitted. Let them work on themselves.” Danis was suspended for seven months and fined $7,500, also retroactive to the day of the event. On May 22, 2019, NSAC reduced the suspensions by 35 days which allowed Abubakar Nurmagomedov and Tukhugov to be eligible to compete again on September 1, 2019.

Background A UFC Light Heavyweight Championship bout between former champion Jon Jones and former title challenger Alexander Gustafsson headlined this event. As the current divisional champion Daniel Cormier is focusing on defending his UFC Heavyweight Championship, the promotion has indicated that he would be stripped of his title and that the winner of the proposed Jones/Gustafsson bout would become the undisputed champion. Jones and Gustafsson have fought previously in September of 2013 at UFC 165 with Jones defending his title by unanimous decision. The rematch was previously booked to headline UFC 178 in September of 2014, but the pairing was scrapped after Gustafsson tore his right meniscus and lateral collateral ligament. A day before the event, Cormier relinquished his title as he said \\"I'd rather walk away this way, than have the history books say I was stripped\\". The event was originally expected to take place at T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada, part of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Area. However on December 23, the event was moved to The Forum in Inglewood, California due to a Jones' drug testing abnormality stemming from earlier that month. The test found a trace amount of turinabol in Jones' system, the same substance he tested positive for in 2017 that led to the 15-month suspension he recently was cleared from in order to fight this week. Because the Nevada State Athletic Commission does not have proper time to investigate in order to keep Jones cleared to fight in Las Vegas, the UFC decided to move the entire event to Inglewood as the California State Athletic Commission would grant Jones a licence. UFC VP of Athlete Health and Performance Jeff Novitzky said USADA, in consultation with other organizations, believes the test is a \\"pulsing\\" effect and not a new ingestion of the substance that he tested positive for after UFC 214 in July 2017. A UFC Women's Featherweight Championship bout between current champion Cris Cyborg (who is also a former Strikeforce Women's Featherweight Champion and Invicta FC Featherweight Champion) and current UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion Amanda Nunes took place at the event. Nunes became the first woman to be champion in two divisions simultaneously and third fighter overall (after Conor McGregor at UFC 205 and Daniel Cormier at UFC 226), as well as the sixth person overall to win a title in different divisions. This was the fourth time in UFC history that champions in different divisions fought for the same title, following UFC 94, UFC 205 and UFC 226. A women's flyweight bout between Sijara Eubanks and Jessica Eye was expected to take place at this event, but Eubanks was pulled from the bout on October 2 in favor of a headliner for the vacant UFC Women's Flyweight Championship against former UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship challenger Valentina Shevchenko at UFC 230. However, that fight was canceled a week later. Eubanks remained on the card at UFC 230 and fought against former title challenger Roxanne Modafferi, while Eye found a new opponent at UFC 231. Tom Duquesnoy was expected to face Nathaniel Wood at the event. However, Duquesnoy pulled out of the fight on November 12 citing a rib injury. Wood then faced Andre Ewell. A bantamweight bout between Brian Kelleher and Montel Jackson was initially slated to take place at UFC 230. However the fight was cancelled on the day of the event due to a medical issue for Kelleher and was rescheduled for this event. At the weigh-ins, Jackson weighed in at 137 lb, 1 pound over the bantamweight non-title fight limit of 136 lb. He was fined 20% of his fight purse and his bout against Kelleher proceeded at catchweight.

Built in 1914, this building now serves as the parish hall for the church. It is historically important for its association with labor and civil rights activist Cesar Chavez, who attended church in this building, and conducted labor and community organizing activities here. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2016. Description and history Our Lady of Guadalupe Church is located northeast of downtown San Jose in its Mayfair neighborhood, on the south side of East San Antonio Street east of its junction with South Sunset Avenue. The main church building is a six-sided modern structure, built in 1968. McDonnell Hall stands in the parking area on the east side of the church building. It is a basically rectangular single- story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and stucco exterior. The north- facing short facade houses its main entrance, sheltered by a gabled portico. The interior has been substantially altered for use from its original religious functions, to house meeting spaces, a kitchen, classrooms, and storage. McDonnell Hall was built in 1914 to a design by San Jose architect Louis Lenzen, and was originally located in West San Jose, where it housed the congregation called St. Martin of Tours. In 1923, this congregation added wings to each side of the building, giving it a cruciform shape, and it was again renovated in 1948. In 1953, the St. Martin's congregation sold the building to the Roman Catholic parish of St. Patrick's, which wanted to establish a mission in Mayfair to better serve the large Mexican and Mexican- American Catholic population that lived there. The building was broken down and reconstructed near its present location, and from 1953 to 1968 it housed the growing Our Lady of Guadalupe congregation. The building was formally upgraded from a chapel to a church in 1960. After construction of the modern church, the building was moved northwest, in order to accommodate the city's development of Mayfair Park. It was moved and deconsecrated in 1974-75. The building is historically significant for its association with labor leader and civil rights activist Cesar Chavez. Chavez, a Roman Catholic, was a friend of Father Donald McDonnell, the priest who first led Our Lady of Guadalupe, and helped in the relocation of the building and its reconsecration as a Roman Catholic chapel in 1953. The chapel became home to Chavez' chapter of the Community Service Organization, an important training ground for his later activism. Chavez moved from San Jose to Oxnard in 1958.

Prior to his previous post at Wichita State University, he served as interim president at Fort Hays State, as well as the president of the Kansas Board of Regents from 2010 to 2015. Tompkins was a professor and dean at Pittsburg State University two different times, and served as a superintendent of three different Kansas school districts. Tompkins is also the former Commissioner of the Kansas State Department of Education, serving from June 1, 1996 to June 30, 2005.  Biography   Education  A native of Oklahoma, Tompkins graduated from East Central University in 1969 where he majored in English. After completing his undergraduate degree, Tompkins attended Emporia State University where he completed his master's degree in education administration in 1973, and completed his doctorate in education from the University of Kansas (KU) in 1977.  Early career  After graduating from ECU, Tompkins began his 46-year career as an educator as a secondary teacher in Oklahoma, quickly moving to Hugoton, Kansas the following year. Following a year at Hugoton, Tompkins went to serve as West Franklin High School's principal in Pomona, Kansas before serving as the superintendent at three different school districts from 1977 until 1994. From 1994 to 1996, Tompkins served at Pittsburg State University as the interim dean of the School of Education and the school's Special Services and Administrative Studies department.  Later career  In 1996, Tompkins was hired as the Education Commissioner for Kansas. Tompkins served at a time when the State School Board was at odds on how to fund public schools and deleted any mention of the word \\"evolution\\" from the state's science studies. Tompkins also helped the state implement the No Child Left Behind Act, passed in 2001 by the United States Congress. Tompkins, who retired in 2005 after serving as the longest education commissioner in Kansas, served under Governors Bill Graves and Kathleen Sebelius. In 2005, returned to teaching as he accepted a position within the School of Education at KU. Two years later in 2007, Tompkins made a return to Pittsburg State as the College of Education dean. He served that position until June 2010 when he became the President/CEO of the Kansas Board of Regents, the governing board of the seven state universities and 25 community and technical colleges. During his tenure, which began June 1, 2010, Tompkins faced budget issues when Sam Brownback took office as Governor, leading to university budget cuts. Aside from the budget cuts, Tompkins helped search and hire four Regent university presidents: Michael Shonrock, John Bardo, Mirta Martin and Allison Garrett. Tompkins retired on June 30, 2015. Tompkins also served as Fort Hays State University's interim president from December 19, 2016 to December 15, 2017. He became interim president of Wichita State in April 2019 after the death of John Bardo.

It is located at the southern end of the city, facing the banks of the Quelimane River. Built by Portuguese missionaries in the 1770s and 80s, it was named a national monument in 1943. Upon the establishment of the Diocese of Quelimane in 1954, it was elevated to cathedral status. When the New Cathedral of Quelimane was completed in 1976, the old cathedral was abandoned. Although it has fallen into decay, it remains a city landmark and a tourist attraction, and there are plans to restore the building in 2018.  History  The church around the turn of the 20th-century The old cathedral, 2017 Portuguese missionaries began building the church in 1776. According to local tradition, the cathedral was built on the site near where Vasco da Gama tied his ships to a large tree while en route to India in 1498. The church's construction began under Governor Baltasar Manuel Pereira do Lago, but stopped after his death. Construction resumed under Governor António de Melo e Castro. It was completed in 1786 and dedicated as the Church of Our Lady of Liberation (Portuguese: Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Livramento). Its design was reportedly based on the Sé Cathedral in Goa, India. On 3 August 1943, it was declared a national monument of Portuguese Mozambique, for its historical significance to Zambezia Province, and especially Quelimane. On 6 October 1954, the Diocese of Quelimane was erected with territory taken from the Diocese of Beira. That year, Our Lady of Liberation was inaugurated as the diocese's cathedral. When the New Cathedral of Quelimane was completed, the old cathedral was used by other religious congregations, but gradually fell into disuse and neglect. As the cathedral became visibly abandoned, it became frequented by criminals, making it dangerous to visit. It also became home to around ten street children. Over the years, church officials made efforts to restore the cathedral, but were unable to raise the necessary funds. All the diocese could afford was the construction of temporary fencing to protect the historic building from intruders. In 2017, plans were announced to restore the old cathedral by 2018. In an agreement signed in August 2017 between the Diocese of Quelimane, the owner of the property, and the Bons Sinais Association, a local civic organization, it was intended for the building to be restored for Quelimane's 75-year anniversary as a city. Per the agreement, the Catholic diocese would retain ownership of the cathedral, which would become a cultural and educational center. On 19 November 2017, Bishop Hilário da Cruz Massinga estimated the total cost of the restoration project at €500,000.  Architecture  The facade of the old cathedral The cathedral is built in Portuguese colonial style, and its design was reportedly based on the Sé Cathedral in Goa, India. It has been described as in the Mannerist and Indo- Portuguese traditions. A \\"magnificent\\" yet \\"austere\\" building, it has been compared to the 17th-century Church of Our Lady of Nazareth in Luanda, and the 18th-century Church of Our Lady of Pópulo in Benguela, both in Angola. The cathedral faces the Quelimane River. A stout building, its facade consists of a pediment flanked by two domed bell towers. The building's sides include covered galleries, which are commonly featured in Indian churches.  Ordinaries  During the church's period as the cathedral from 1954 to 1976, it served as the seat of the Bishop of Quelimane. Those two ordinaries are as follows: # Francisco Nunes Teixeira (1955–1975) # Bernardo Filipe Governo, OFMCap (1976–1976)  Burials  The Old Cathedral of Quelimane holds six tombs dating from the 19th-century, including several children. The first to be buried in the church was Captain Mor (1795-1843), whose four children constructed the tomb. The next, Maria Joana da Cunha, died in Quelimane just before her 16th birthday in 1846. Her husband, Manuel Velosa da Rocha, arranged for her to be entombed in the church. In 1855, 1½-year-old Emília António Generoso was buried. Two-year-old Carlos Fortunato Generoso was buried in the cathedral by his parents, Emília de Assunção Generoso and Cristóvão Colombo, a noted sailor and cartographer. The last to be buried in the church was Father Francisco, a Goan priest, born in 1820, who arrived in Quelimane in 1845. He was named vicar of the church by royal decree in 1847, and named a member of the Order of Christ in 1858. His tomb was commissioned by his brother, Joaquim Henrique da Nazaret.

In August 1980, President Kim Il-sung ordered the construction of a new, northern east-west transversal trunk line, to run from Manp'o on the Manp'o Line in the northwest to Hoeryŏng on the Hambuk Line in the northeast. To accomplish this, a plan was made to undertake construction of the line,북부철길 전철화, 동아일보, 1992 January 30 to be called the Pukpu Line in three stages: Manp'o–Hyesan, Hyesan–Musan, and Musan–Hoeryŏng, making use of existing rail lines where possible - including conversion of narrow gauge lines, and building new lines where necessary. It was decided that construction of the first stage would begin at Unbong, northeastern terminus of the Unbong Line from Manp'o, giving a jump by incorporating most of the existing Unbong Line into the new Pukpu Line. Work building the new line began in 1981; just before Unbong Station a junction was installed, where a new station was built, called Sinunbong Station (=\\"New Unbong Station\\"), from where the new line would head towards Hyesan. Construction of the first stage was completed in 1988.북부철길 1단계공사완료, Kyunghyang Shinmun, 10 August 1988 The absorption of most of the existing railway between Manp'o and Unbong cut back the Unbong Line to a stretch from the junction point with the new line, located at Sangp'unggang at the confluence of the Yalu and Samp'ung Rivers, to Unbong Station at the terminus of the old line, adjacent to the dam; this was transformed into a large freight-only yard, with Sinunbong Station handling primarily passenger traffic; the remaining section of the original 1959 line from Sangp'unggang to Kuunbong retained the \\"Unbong Line\\" name. At some point in time the stations traded names, with Sinunbong Station becoming the current Unbong Station, and the original Unbong Station becoming today's Kuunbong Station (\\"Old Unbong Station\\") - this might have happened either between 1991 and 1993, when electrification works of the Pukpu Line were completed, or between 2011 and 2013 when, in accordance with Kim Jong-il's order to refurbish the by then nearly decrepit Pukpu Line, work brigades of the Kim Il-sung Socialist Youth League rebuilt the entirety of the Manp'o–Hyesan line between April 2011 and November 2013; at that time, many other stations along the line were renamed, most to honour the youth work brigades in keeping with what had become a North Korean tradition since 1958, when Kim Il-sung gave the Sariwŏn—Haeju line - rebuilt by youth \\"volunteer\\" teams \\\\- the name of \\"Hwanghae Ch'ŏngnyŏn Line\\" (\\"Yellow Sea Youth\\").

The sect was founded by Mahantyagi Baba Jumdevji . The sect commands worship of one god and abstinence from alcohol. Though being a part of Hinduism, the sect forbids its followers to worship any of the Hindu deities.  Mahantyagi Baba Jumdevji  Mahantyagi Baba Jumdevji was born on 3 April, 1921 at Nagpur, Maharashtra, INDIA in a humble and poor family. His father Vithobaji Thubrikar was a weaver. Baba Jumdevji had three elder brothers named Balkrishna, Narayan, Jagoba and one younger brother named Maroti. As Vithobaji Thubrikar was a weaver it was his family’s occupation and mother Saraswati bai was a housewife, He couldn't continue his education after fourth standard due to poverty. Even though he was formally not much educated, his metaphysical spirit and potentiality was of very high order. He had an undistinguished childhood besides his passion for wrestling. He married Varanasi bai on 1938 at the tender age of 17 and decided to leave his family profession for no solid reasons. He then served a business firm of Seth Kesarimal as an employee for some years as gold trader. Later, he started working as a contractor in Nagpur Municipal Corporation. Baba Jumdevji got his only son named Mahadev (Mano) had studied in extremely difficult and poor conditions but as baba encouraged him to go for higher education and as a result Dr. Mahadev (Mano) Jumdevji Thubrikar was honored with engineering along with multiple certifications like New York University, MS, PhD (1970-1975), University of Virginia, Dept. of Surgery (1975-1991), Carolinas Medical Center, Heineman Research (1991-2004), Distinguished Scientist, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA (2004-2007), Director of BME, South Dakota School of Mines & Technology, Rapid City, SD (2007-2010), Thubrikar Aortic Valve, Inc. (2010-Present), President and Founder, Author of \\"The Aortic Valve\\". Today, he is the only person is an associate professor at the University of Virginia Medical Center, Virginia, USA, Department of Surgery and Director of Surgical Research. He has done research on Heart Valves, especially on Normal, Dissolved and Bioprosthetic Orative Valves. Many of his research papers have received national recognition in USA. Many books written on multiple subjects have been applied into the curriculum of the students for many years in various Universities. He was awarded the Merit Certificate and National Institute of Health, U.S.A. by the New York Academy of Medicine. He has honored with the Research Career Development Award. Today, he is the seventh best-known Medical Scientist among the world's top nine scientists. Subsequently, Baba Jumdevji had got an intuitive perception regarding the omniscient God Hanuman and got inspired to perform pooja and havan regularly. He also visualized the presence of Supreme One God in the havan and made it sure that Lord Hanuman destroyed tens of thousands evil ghosts in the process of havan. Moreover, he gained a bliss and realized it was a path for enlightenment. His life was dedicated for the services of the masses irrespective of caste, class, creed or religion. He was all the while absorbed in spiritual pursuits. He critically observed the nature of the people and channelized them for the cause of their upliftment. He had self realized vision and throughout his life, taught the lessons for the purity of hearts and malice for none. A supernatural incident took place in Baba's life on 25 August, 1948. He fell into a trance during a havan when he got the intuition that all the existing Gods and Goddesses introduced themselves to him. Finally a God claimed to be the “Supreme One” made his presence felt and asked Baba that he was always present with him and he would die if he left, so the family members and neighbors were convinced that Baba had gained a heavenly blessing and the visualization of the presence of God in his life. The message spread like a wild-fire. Baba Jumdevji attained a state of nirvana. He achieved enlightenment. After having a transcendental experience, he was blessed by the Supreme God. It was something that provided Baba Jumdevji an impetus to develop more quickly as spiritual and social healer. When he saw that there were many unhappy and unsatisfied people in country, he shared with them the blessings which he found during enlightenment and worked towards betterment of such unprivileged people. Baba Jumdevji established a new religion named \\"Manav Dharma\\" on the principles of humanity. It was Baba's sincere attempt to purify and reform the doctrines of religious philosophy, to deepen the sense of spirituality among his followers, to reassert their moral dimension and to inspire social reforms. Really, it was an actualization of Baba's promise that he made to God in his trance. He catered his spiritual knowledge to the poor and needy people in a selfless manner as per his promise made to God. Similarly, he formed many organizations along with \\"Manav Dharma\\" to benefit and secure life of poor and uneducated people. People belonging to \\"Manav Dharma\\" are called \\"Paramatma Ek Sevak\\". He initiated social reform movements and struggled hard against blind faith, untouchability, superstition, cow-slaughter and other social evils. At the later stage, Baba Jumdevji kept himself busy in spreading spiritual awakening among people. He inculcated the value of spirituality which conceded countless followers. He always urged his family member and followers to stay united and organized. Saturdays were fixed for weekly gatherings for the purpose of discussion and reading of religious books. Consequently, there had been an enormous increase in his followers. A voluntary contribution of funds among the followers was introduced and the collected amount was used for philanthropic works. Having a farsighted vision he extended his sphere to social activities. His organization became strong and expanded. A registered organization named \\"Parampujya Parmatma Ek Sewak Mandal\\" Nagpur had been launched on 4 December 1969. The followers of Baba, under his auspicious guidance, have built a big structure at Nagpur named \\"Sanskrutik Bhawan\\" nowadays called as “Manav Mandir\\", it has residential and library facilities for the poor students belonging to the families associated with the organization. Later, \\"Parampujya Parmatma Ek Sewak Mandal”, Nagpur declared “Mahantyagi Baba Jumdevji” as abbot for Nagpur Mandal. Currently, followers are available in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and all over India and many are settled in abroad, the number of their disciples are even more than 5 Million till 2019 and its growing ore on day by day. Similarly Baba Jumdevji, the philanthropist has established many social welfare organizations which are listed as below: # Parampujya Parmatma Ek Sevak Mandal,Nagpur(Manav Mandir, Wardhman Nagar, Nagpur) # Parmatma Ek Sewak Nagrik Sahkari Bank,Maryadit, Nagpur # Parmatma Ek Sevak Manavdharm Aashram, Mouda # Parmatma Ek Sewak Bahu Uddeshiya Grahak Bhandar, Nagpur # Parmatma Ek Sewak Dugdh Utpadak Sahakari Sanstha, Salaimeta, Taluka - Ramtek, District - Nagpur # Parmatma Ek Sewak Dugdh Utpadak Sahakari Sanstha, Dhop, Taluka - Mohadi, District - Bhandara # Parmatma Ek Sewak Dharmarth Dawakhana, Nagpur # Parmatma Ek Sewak Dharmarth Dawakhana, Dhop, Taluka - Mohadi, District – Bhandara Through these social organizations he served the humanity till his last breath. Baba Jumdevji died on 3 October 1996. He thought deeply, spoke gently and was more often a reconciler of spiritual opinions than an upholder of any vested interests. He believed in thoroughness and impeccability, always dived deep into the facts for procuring substance rather than merely professing information. “Manav Dharma” has been infusing all aspects of Jumdevji's divinely perceived knowledge to its devotees since its inception. It has affirmed a new culture in our society by making us aware about the irrefutable and irreplaceable necessity of the virtues like truth and non-violence. Baba Jumdevji has propounded a new philosophy of Four Elements, Three Words and Five major rules which itself signifies principles to achieve heavenly bliss. They are as follows: Four Elements: # Divine One # Die or live, in the name of God # Restore life by eradicating sorrows # Desired Food (Desired wish) Three Words: # Speaking truth # Keeping the limits # Lovingly behaving Five Rules: # Pray one God with devotion and dedication # Establish truth, limitation and love in family and followers # Stop harmful addictions and habits like Alcohol, Gambling, Lottery, Cock-fighting, Stealing, Lying, Anger and to prohibit women from using abusive words to their husband and children’s # Maintain integrity in family and followers # Keep the family small and demarcated According to Baba Jumdevji, God is not in any shape of a human being but it is a divine power which is available for 24 hours and it is shapeless, alert and awake. Babaji has urged his followers to keep the face of idol of Lord Hanuman towards east and the worshipper's face towards West. This justification for maintaining is because the Sun rises in the East and therefore, this direction is always shining and vice-versa for West as the Sun sets in the direction. Since human race has been suffering from a lot of miseries, he should keep the idol of the lord at his front to derive divine power to overcome these miseries. In a nutshell, the main object of this religion is that man should behave like a man and his life should be based on dedication, sacrifice, mercy, forgiveness and peace and this is the real “Manav Dharma” Preachings of Baba Jumdevji towards Humanity # The current situation of corruption cannot be handled and controlled by human beings but it can be brought into control only by God's grace and divine power. If the human beings want to keep themselves secure from the transformation of the Age, they need to follow the path of Truth, Good Conduct and Love to get the divine peace. This message was conveyed on 1st September, 1980. # # The purpose of this divine path is to follow the path of Truth, Good conduct and Love that destroys each and every sorrow of the follower of this who becomes the Enlightened One. This message was conveyed on 16 February, 1991, at Sevak Sammelan, Ramtek, and District Nagpur. # # The Almighty has to convert the Iron Age and bring forth the Golden Age where only the Truth prevails and nothing else. Every man and woman has to be Enlightened One has to repent for the misdeeds done by one on this path of enlightenment. Bai Sati is not of less significance than Renuka God is the giver of intelligence and divine power is the greatest of powers and we all have to perform good deeds towards our family and Sevaks. This message was conveyed on 28th September, 1990 at Gat No.03, Lalganj, Nagpur. # # The Citizens of this country should become Enlightened Ones because it is the transformation of the Age. After the Iron Age, there will be the Silver Age. It is the cycle of the Ages. Only those who follow the path of Truth, Good Conduct and Love shall remain safe and secure when the Day of Judgment will come. # # There exists only one God and we should not search God in the idols. God exists in every human soul and does not exist in physical form to identify. # # Baba was strictly against pretentious behavior like keeping long hair, beard, wearing Rudraksh and other beads, keeping Kamandal etc. and believed in simplicity. # # Truth signifies brave and fearless expression of heart. Words spoken to appease others take us towards falsehood. One should always speak the truth even if it endangers one’s life because God loves truth and his truthful followers. # # Baba believed that we should follow the path taught to us by Gods for example Lord Rama destroyed evil in the form of Ravana. We should follow the path shown by Lord Rama rather than just worshipping lord Rama's idol. # # Baba was against worshipping the Deads as after death a man vanishes in the supreme God and what remains of him is only ash of his body, so it is uncalled for to worship the ash. A man with truthful means and undivided attention towards a single goal with faith in one God can accomplish his or her desired tasks. # # Baba was against dividing humans in the name of religion and religious practices because according to his philosophy dividing humans is like dividing God. # # Baba was farsighted in his approach and preached family planning laying down following conditions for his followers, a. One should not have more than two issues and should follow family planning measures consulting the doctors. b. The age of marriage for a male should not be less than 25 years and Baba advocated proper gap between two issues, so that the family size should be small and the mother remains healthy. # # Baba advocated cooperative system for his downtrodden followers who were not only poor but also illiterate. The followers were exploited by the vicious system of money lenders. To save them from this vicious system Baba propounded the philosophy of cooperative system and fund raining for their welfare. On this philosophy he established “Sevak Nagrik Sahkari Bank\\", “Sahakari Grahak Bhandar” and “Dugdha Udpadak Sahakari Sanstha. By establishing these cooperative societies Baba not only gave them spiritual guidance but also practical approach to solve their day to day problems of life. # # Baba established “Manav Mandir\\" for the all-round development of his disciples and their children. “The Manav Mandir” consists of school, playground, houses, Library and seminar Hall where thousands of disciples gather on every 15th November and bring food with them. After the preaching and havan they eat together and enjoy togetherness. # # Baba believed in the doctrine of “health is wealth” because only a healthy person can understand the real meaning of life and can enjoy the blessing of God. For this purpose he established a charitable hospital near Mohadi Village in Bhandara District. # # Baba was apostle of uninterested service to mankind. He advocated that the core Principal of Manav Dharma is selfless sacrifice. Baba was not satisfied with the existing democracy of the country and thought that the country is ruled by rich and misguided people. The day to day discourses of people are against the divine law.

It is also known as The Martyrdom of Pionius the Presbyter and His Companions, The Acts of Pionius, and in Latin as Martyrium PioniiKozlowski, Jan M. (2008). \\"The Portrait of Commodus in Herodian's History (1,7,5-6) as the Source of Pionius' post mortem Description in Martyrium Pionii (22,2-4). Vigiliae Christianae. or Passio Pionii. Pionius was a presbyter, and was most likely killed between 249 and 251 AD during the rule of the Roman Emperor Decius. The feast day of Saint Pionius is kept on March 11 in Eastern Orthodox churches, and on February 1 in Roman Catholicism.  Narrative overview  The narrative records that Pionius and several other Christians were killed on the \\"birthday\\" of Polycarp, a prominent Christian martyr of an earlier period. Warned by God in a dream the previous night about his impending martyrdom, Pionius is arrested, gives a speech to local Jews and Greeks, is put on trial, imprisoned and tortured, then killed. The Martyrdom portrays Pionius as a willing martyr, even going so far as to place himself in chains prior to his arrest, repeatedly emphasizing that he goes freely to his death. Historian Geoffrey de Ste. Croix says, \\"If with most scholars we date the martyrdom of Pionius to the Decian persecution (250 CE), following the Passio Pionii, we cannot reckon Pionius a volunteer even though after being arrested he wrapped chains around his own neck and those of his two companions (Pass.Pion.2.3-4), since Pionius and the others would have been required to sacrifice in any event; but if Eusebius (HE 4.15.47) is right in putting the martyrdom under Marcus Aurelius (as believed, e.g., by Grégoire (Persecutions 108-114,157 f.) who ruled from 161 to 180 CE, then we should have to count Pionius and his two companions as volunteers.\\" The Empire-wide measures taken under Decius in 250 AD required everyone to provide sacrifices and eat sacrificial meat, one of the four things forbidden to Christians by the original Apostles in Acts 21:25. A report of the martyrdom of Pionius at that time appears in a report from Smyrna based on the original transcript of the governor's hearing. \\"Pionius was a model citizen of Smyrna admired by all. One of the three temple guardians accompanied by policemen went to find Pionius because he had refused to perform sacrifices. He was waiting for them in his house with the Christians Sabina and Asklepiades. The three had already put shackles around their necks to show that they were ready to go to prison. While efforts were made to persuade them to follow the example of others who had already performed the sacrifice, the three were led through the streets to the agora.\\" The author of the Passio in the mid-third century says the upper galleries of the square were packed with Greeks, Hebrews and women who had the day off because of the Grand Shabbat. Pionius responds to the crowd's taunting by reminding the Greeks that Homer never considered it pious to rejoice at another losing his life. He reminds the Jews of Moses and Solomon, who preach offering aid to the enemy and not rejoicing at his fate. He accuses them of showing no compassion by the fact of being human beings or the victims of injustice themselves. He follows with a series of rhetorical questions: \\"To whom have we done wrong? Have we perchance murdered someone? Or, do we persecute anyone? Or have we obliged anyone to venerate idols?\\" Pionius is tortured, repeatedly asked, \\"Will you sacrifice?\\" and repeatedly declines, and is eventually sentenced to be burned alive.  Historicity  Daniel Boyarin describes the historical accuracy of the Martyrdom of Pionius as \\"highly contested\\" among scholars, with varying levels of support among scholars for accuracy of its historical details. Jan Kozlowski, following L. Robert, has argued that various details of the text indicate that it was written in the third century AD, not long after the Decian persecution.Kozlowski, Jan M. (2008). \\"The Portrait of Commodus in Herodian's History (1,7,5-6) as the Source of Pionius' post mortem Description in Martyrium Pionii (22,2-4)\\". p. 35-36. Vigiliae Christianae. Robin Lane Fox has also argued strongly for the reliability of the account, describing it as 'a text of rare authority, true to its first contemporary form'. Lane Fox, R. 1986, Pagans and Christians in the Mediterranean world from the second century AD to the conversion of Constantine, Penguin Books, London, p. 472 Bart Ehrman argues that the narrative shows traces of \\"literary license, if not wholesale invention\\" in the way that it echoes the earlier story of Polycarp, who died in 155 AD. Theologian Arthur Cushman McGiffert says \\"Ruinart's Acta Martyrum Sincera is a Latin narrative of the martyrdom of Pionius which appears to be substantially the same as the document which Eusebius used in the Greek. The account bears all the marks of genuineness, and may be regarded as trustworthy, at least on the main points.\\" Historian William Tabbernee reports Pionius as having two trials, the first under Polemon, the temple-verger at Smyrna, and the second under Julius Proculus Quintilianus. McGiffert says: \\"The Life of Polycarp which purports to have been written by Pionius, is manifestly spurious and entirely untrustworthy, and belongs to the latter part of the fourth century. The true Pionius therefore, who suffered under Decius, and the pseudo-Pionius who wrote that life are to be sharply distinguished.\\" According to the Martyrdom of Polycarp, (chapter 22) Gaius transcribed the text of the Martyrdom of Polycarp from the papers of Irenaeus; Socrates (or Isocrates) then transcribed the text from Gaius' copy; then it says Pionius produced his own copy after assembling papers \\"worn with age\\". \\"Ehrman assumes that this is the Pionius of Smyrna who was martyred during the Decian persecution c.250 CE. Kleist disagrees and correlates this Pionius with the author of the Vita Pol. instead. Naturally some scholars have equated all three.\\" Dating Pionius' death In the second century, Asia Minor experienced several regional persecutions from varying causes. Emperor Marcus Aurelius' mandata (mandates) to the provincial governors to impose severe punishments on the sacrilegious were believed by the Bishop of Sardeis to be triggering manhunts. The vast majority of scholars date the \\"Martyrdom of Polycarp\\" to this period (c.155-168 CE). In the Historia Ecclesiae 4.14-15, Eusebius gives an account of the martyrdom of Polycarp, which is well attested, and other martyrs of the same period, and includes: \\"... Pionius, who made some excellent apologies for the Christian faith, were likewise burnt.\\" McGiffert says, \\"Eusebius has fallen into a serious chronological blunder by making these other martyrs contemporaries of Polycarp. We learn from a notice in the document by Ruinart that Pionius ... and the others were put to death during the persecution of Decius in 250 CE and this date is confirmed by external evidence.\\" Possible explanations for this error include a phrase Eusebius repeats in the heading of the document indicating these martyrdoms took place at the same season of the year, while Eusebius may have mistakenly interpreted that to mean at the same time. The Martyrdom of Pionius and his Companions says, \\"On the second day of the sixth month, on the occasion of a great Sabbath, and on the anniversary of the blessed martyr Polycarp, while the persecution of Decius was still on, there were arrested the presbyter Pionius ... It was Saturday ...\\" The \\"sixth month\\" appears to be a reference to the modern month of March. While the Catholic Encyclopedia says Pionius was arrested on 23 February 250 and killed on 12 March,\\"St. Pionius.\\" Catholic Encyclopedia. Monroy says German theologian Willy Rordorf thinks the precision of the description of the date does not indicate a day of the week, but instead indicates the feast of Terminalia, celebrated in the Roman world in honor of the god Terminus as the last day of the year precisely on 23 February. \\"This explains the presence of \\"Greeks, Hebrews, and women\\" and corresponds with a report by Lactantius, according to which Diocletian, at the instigation of Galerius, put in hand the Great Persecution precisely in the Terminalia.\\" This theory has been contested by R. Cacitti who says the terminology of Grand Shabbat in church literature arose theologically and not chronologically. \\"Strobel opts for Saturday, 22 February 167 CE (an astronomical full moon).\\" Authorship and style The Martyrdom of Pionius makes two claims for itself: that it was written by Pionius, and that Pionius \\"left us this writing for our instruction\\" (Pionius 1). As to the first claim, Bart Ehrman says Pionius is written almost entirely in the third person, does not move into the first person till near the end, and then \\"it is clearly not Pionius speaking as the author claims to have witnessed the miracle that transpired at the martyr's death.\\" Ehrman says the entire account bears evidence of literary license in its parallels to the \\"Martyrdom of Polycarp\\" which it may have used as a model for its style. But there is no doubt such martyrologies served as instruction. D.R. Woolf says the martyrologies \\"disseminated particular messages and instructions to their readers through commentary and the examples provided by the martyrs. Within the narrative accounts and the literary reconstruction of the martyrs words and experiences, lay the virtues, doctrine and values held by the oppressed group.\\" L. Arik Greenberg says \\"there is an underlying thematic unity between the Hellenistic Noble Death tradition...and Christian martyrological texts by drawing upon the Philosopher's Death paradigm.\\" L. Stephanie Cobb says that \\"in a number of ways, the martyrologies such as Pionius, appropriate both actual and spatial elements of the amphitheater\\" in that they claim power for the powerless at the moment when they are most victimized; they ascribe power onto the body of the martyr/gladiator; and they insist martyrs chose martyrdom and did so with masculine honor and bravery. Sociology Sociologist and feminist scholar Elizabeth Castelli says it was in the writing of stories such as \\"The Martyrdom of Pionius\\" that early Christian culture first formed its cultural identity and was \\"indelibly marked by the collective memory of the religious suffering of others.\\" She says: \\"The category of collective memory helps to illuminate why martyrdom was —and continues to be— such a critical building block of Christian culture.\\" G. E. M. de Ste. Croix, Marxist historian, says, \\"By around the late first century, the Romans had a clear conception of what Christians were which encompassed most, (although by no means all), of the myriad of groups who considered themselves Christian. This understanding focused on what Christians were not, namely people who would not participate in traditional sacrifices.\\" Much recent work has focused on the fashioning of the identities of Christians and Jews through mutual interaction which was often hostile. Priest and theologian Mauricio Saavedra Monroy says \\"the Martyrdom of Pionius records the \\"progressive disencounter [the ongoing process of separation] between the Jews of the day and the Christian minority.\\" Monroy notes \\"the development on the Christian side of a literary genre and a theology of accusation and defense in the face of Jewish proselytism exercised in the midst of the persecutions of the Christians who, at this point in history are already clearly differentiated from the former by the authorities of the Empire and the mass of the people.\\" Both the Martyrdom of Polycarp and that of Pionius convey that the social ascendancy of Judaism in Smyrna was exploited to take advantage of the weakness of the Christians during the time of persecution. Even if they were elaborated, \\"it is clear that the perception the editors of these sources had of the Jewish community present in Smyrna clearly conveys a real conflict between Christians and Jews.\\" References Category:Syriac literature Category:3rd-century Christian martyrs Category:3rd-century Christian saints Category:3rd-century Christian texts ","title":"Martyrdom of Pionius"},{"id":"56176280","text":"Skinnera is an Ediacaran-aged fossil found in Australia. It was discovered by A.L. Halliday and M.M. Bruer near Mount Skinner in the locality of Anmatjere, in the Northern Territory of Australia some time before 1969. Mary Wade of the University of Adelaide originally formally described Skinnera as a medusa.  Description  Skinnera is a small, disk-shaped fossil preserved as a composite mold. Specimens range in diameter from 3.9-32mm; most are about 10mm across. They are slightly domed and all approximately 2mm tall. The fossils have three-fold symmetry and are characterized by three large, pouch-shaped depressions in the center which are speculated to be the stomach. These central depressions are connected to an outer rim of approximately 15 smaller pouch-shaped depressions along the perimeter of the disk by canals, link  Diversity  There is only one known species, S. brooksi.  Discovery  A.L. Halliday, geologist, and M.M. Bruer, field assistant, were on a geological expedition near Mount Skinner while working for Kennecott Explorations, Pty. Ltd. when they found fossiliferous deposits near the mountain. They marked off three locations, Mt. Skinner No. 1-3. The majority of fossils were found between sites Mt. S2 and Mt. S3. Halliday and Bruer notified Mary Wade of the Department of Geology at the University of Adelaide. Wade collected additional fossils aided by Halliday and Bruer. Two types of fossils were found which Wade designated as Form A and Form B. There were about twice as many fossils of Form A than Form B. Wade named Form A Hallidaya brueri, for the discoverers, and Form B Skinnera brooksi for the location. Wade (1969) described Skinnera as a medusa, though, other sources classify it as a trilobozoan related to Tribrachidium and Hallidaya.  Distribution  Skinnera is known from three sites in the Northern Territory of Australia near Mount Skinner. Fossils were primarily found between sites Mt. Skinner 2 and Mt. Skinner 3.  Taphonomy  The fossils were found in flaggy bedding of maroon and green shales with subgreywacks, impure siltstone, and claystones. The fossils are found flattened, parallel to the bedding plane with the dorsal surface up.  Significance  S. brooksi was described by Mary Wade, a leading female paleontologist at the time in a male dominated field.

It is believed to be a close relative of Palaeopascichnus.  Description  Orbisiana occur in aggregates made up of rows arranged in sometimes branching chains. 3-D analysis has shown Orbisiana to be cylindrical in shape and open at both the top and bottom ends of its structure. The chains often varied in shape from straight to curved and disorganized lines of spheres with no fixed number of spheres per chain. Specimens range in size but generally have diameters of . The cell membranes of the organism are often pyritized. The individual chambers are agglutinating.  Diversity  Two species have been documented, O. linearis and O. simplex. It fits into the Palaeopascichnids, the other genus being Palaeopascichnus itself.  Discovery  Orbisiana was first described by B.S. Sokolov in 1976, found in the Neoproterozoic of Russia.

The aircraft, operated by Sydney Seaplanes, was carrying five passengers and a pilot, all of whom were killed in the crash. It was returning diners from Cottage Point Inn restaurant to Rose Bay Water Airport. The ATSB believes it probable that the pilot's performance was adversely affected by carbon monoxide poisoning. Post mortem tests on the bodies of the victims showed raised levels of CO in the blood, and a crack in the exhaust system was seen as the likely source of the gas. Aircraft The aircraft was a 54-year-old de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, originally built in 1963 and registered in Australia since February 1964; it was powered by a single Pratt & Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior engine. In 1996, the aircraft was destroyed in a crash while working as a crop duster near Armidale, New South Wales, killing the pilot. The aircraft was then completely rebuilt; the Civil Aviation Safety Authority confirmed that it had been repaired according to industry requirements. Victims The Canadian- Australian pilot and five British tourists - Richard Cousins, 58, CEO of British foodservice company Compass Group, his two sons, his fiancée\\"Ex-Tory MP father of seaplane victim tells of his grief\\" p 13 Daily Telegraph Issue no 50,580 dated Wednesday 3 January 2018 and her daughter - were killed in the crash. Investigation The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) opened an investigation into the accident. Most of the wreckage of the aircraft was raised on 4 January 2018. The intermediate report, published on 31 January 2018, indicated that the aircraft was found to have followed a differing flight path from the usual, and had failed to climb to the necessary altitude needed to fly over the surrounding terrain. It also indicated that the preliminary examination of aircraft flight control surfaces and controls seemed in sound order and expected positions, and as well that the engine sounded normal to witnesses on the ground. The aircraft landed inverted and all six on board suffered fatal injuries. The investigation will continue with international assistance.

His parents emigrated to the United States, settling in Detroit in 1920, and the family was naturalized in 1921. Singer received a B.A. in Psychology in 1934 and an M.A. in Philosophy in 1936, both from the University of Texas at Austin. His M.A. thesis, \\"George Herbert Mead’s Social-Behavioristic Theory of Mind,\\" prefigured his move to the University of Chicago, where he completed a dissertation \\"On Formal Method in Mathematical Logic,\\" under the supervision of Rudolf Carnap, in 1940. He was a Social Science instructor at the University of Chicago in 1941 and a director of the Social Sciences Department from 1947 to 1952 , and in 1954 he became a professor of anthropology until his retirement in 1979 In the early 1960s he organized studies in South Asia. He traveled to India in his fieldwork, during the years 1954–1955, 1960–1961 and 1964, also developing important contact with researchers of this country. His research centered on the discussion of tradition in the industrialized city of Madras and the Sanskrit tradition in modern urban centers. In the years 1970 and 1980 Singer directs his interests to the studies of the historical roots of the anthropological theories and also of the cultural symbolism. His field work focuses on comparative research into the modernization of American culture in Newburyport, Massachusetts and India, including a deepening of studies of logic and philosophy.

He gives examples such as \\"the rocks were resounding with the salt-water\\"Virgil, Aeneid 5.865. or \\"he recognised his friend Anchises\\"Virgil, Aeneid 3.82. or \\"defended by a great force of men\\".Lucretius, 1.725; Pontano, Actius, fol. 128. Pontano also used it to refer to repetition of letters in medial positions. Among other kinds, he mentions the frequent case when the last syllable of a word begins with the same consonant as the first syllable of the next word, as in \\"the rigid breastplate made of bronze\\" (Virgil).Virgil, Aeneid 8.620; Pontano, Actius, fol. 128b; Naeke (1829), pp. 331, 333f. Since \\"x\\" is pronounced [ks], the phrase \\"the rocks were resounding with sea water\\" (Virgil) can also be considered an example of this kind. Alliteration was a prominent feature of Latin literature (in contrast to Greek), especially in poetry in the 3rd to 1st centuries BC, and continued to be used by some writers even in the Middle Ages. Definitions Scholars differ as to how alliteration should be defined. Some, such as Keith Maclennan (2017), suggest that the term alliteration should be used only of repeated sounds at the beginning of words, and assonance of sounds repeated in another context.Keith Maclennan (2017), Virgil: Aeneid VIII, p. 43. Tracy Peck (1884) also gives examples only of word-initial alliteration. However, Pontano himself, who invented the term, used it also of the alliteration of medial consonants. The French scholars A. Cordier (1939) and Jules Marouzeau (1933) similarly define it as \\"the repetition, near or exact, of a phoneme or group of phonemes at the beginning of syllables (e.g. ) or at the beginning of words (e.g. ) nearby one another in the utterance.\\"Rolfe (1943), p. 226; original in French. The German classicist August Ferdinand Naeke (1829) also accepted internal alliteration and cited examples such as \\"you've nearly broken the hinges of the door, you idiot!\\" (Plautus),Plautus, Amphitruō 1025; Naeke (1829), p. 347. in which the first F, though medial, clearly contributes to the effect of the whole. The Lucretius specialists Cyril Bailey (1947) and Margaret Deutsch (1939), on the other hand, give a slightly different definition. They define alliteration as the repetition of consonants (whether initial or medial), and assonance as the repetition of vowel sounds or of syllables.Bailey (1947), vol 1. p. 147. From the examples Bailey gives, such as , it is clear that he considered that consonants at the end of syllables and words could contribute to alliteration as well as those at the beginning.Bailey (1947), vol 1. p. 149. Thus when several words in a row begin with the same vowel, as in \\"the huge man, struck, falls to the ground\\" (Virgil),Virgil, Aeneid 12.925-6. some scholars follow Pontano in referring to it as alliteration,e.g. T.E. Page (1904) on Aeneid 12.925; Cordier, reported in Rolfe (1943), p. 230; Liegey (1956), p. 383; Clarke (1976). while others use the term assonance.e.g. R.D. Williams (1973) on Aeneid 12.925; Bailey (1947), p. 151; de Ford (1986), p. 61. Conversely, when a medial consonant is involved, as in , it is called \\"internal alliteration\\" by BaileyBailey (1947), p. 149, 151. but would be considered as assonance by Maclennan. Compound alliteration Although simple alliteration involving only the initial consonants of words is very common, in Latin authors of all periods it will often be found that primary alliteration on an initial consonant is accompanied by a secondary or \\"minor\\"de Ford (1986), p. 60. alliteration on a medial consonant. Thus Cicero's \\"the gates are open\\"Cicero 1.10; cf. Aeneid 2.266. as well as the primary alliteration of P has minor alliteration of T. Occasionally there are two minor consonants involved, as in \\"lakes and groves\\" (Cicero)Cicero 2.5.188; cf. Aeneid 7.695. or \\"with coils of snakes\\" (Virgil).Aeneid 12.845. In other examples, the same consonant occurs both initially and medially,Bailey (1947), p. 151. e.g. (Plautus)Pseudolus 157. and (Virgil)Aeneid 4.2 with C, or (Virgil)Aeneid 8.620. with R. Often two different consonants are involved in the same phrase, partly initial and partly medial: (Naevius) and (Virgil)Aeneid 12.875 with M and T; and with M and L (Virgil);Aeneid 2.680, 4.66. and (Nepos),Nepos Themistocles 10.4. (Virgil)Aeneid 4.1 and (Virgil) with R and G.Aeneid 1.401 Any account of alliteration in Latin must therefore take such cases into consideration. However, as Bailey warns, caution must be observed in recognising such examples, as the internal alliteration may sometimes be accidental.Bailey (1947), p. 151. Alliteration and assonance Alliteration frequently overlaps with assonance, which is defined by one dictionary as \\"a resemblance in the sounds of words or syllables, either between their vowels (e.g. meat, bean) or between their consonants (e.g. keep, cape)\\".Chambers 21st Century Dictionary (1996). (This latter kind is also known as consonance.) By this definition some of the examples which Naeke in the 19th century called alliteration, such as \\"thief who wears three yokes\\" (Plautus),Plautus, 323; cf. Naeke (1829), p. 348 \\"it's never been imagined, or painted, or written\\" (Plautus),Plautus, 172; Naeke (1829), p. 384. or \\"she is overcome with grief\\" (Terence)Terence, 265; Naeke (1829), p. 387. would usually these days be referred to as assonance.cf. R.G. Austin (ed.) Virgil: Aeneid 2 on line 107 (īct) and 282 (ōr). Often alliteration and assonance are combined, as in \\"with copious blood they wash their necks and shoulders\\" (Virgil),Aeneid 12.721-2. where there is alliteration of L L L, but also assonance of A AR AR A. Examples of alliteration In popular phrases The earliest appearance of alliteration in Latin seems to have been not in poetry but in proverbs and popular sayings, and phrases of a religious or legal character.Peck (1884), p. 60. Examples of popular phrases are: \\"to waste both oil and time\\", \\"beware of the dog\\", \\"alive and well\\", \\"enough and more\\", \\"white or black\\", \\"public and private\\", and so on. Legal and religious phrases included such as \\"tablets and witnesses\\", \\"altars and shrines\\", \\"houses and temples\\", \\"brave and loyal\\", \\"routed and put to flight\\", \\"Chance and Fortune\\". Frequently such alliterating phrases show asyndeton, i.e. the two words are placed side by side with no conjunction such as \\"and\\".Peck (1884), p. 62. Another example of this is the boast \\"I came, I saw, I conquered\\" attributed to Julius Caesar.Suetonius \\"Life of Julius Caesar\\" 37; Peck (1884) p. 61. It has been noted that in these phrases that if one of two alliterated words has an \\"a\\" in it, it is usually placed second: \\"by sword and flame\\", \\"far and wide\\", \\"hills and plains\\", \\"many and great\\".Peck (1884), p. 64. When the words are of unequal length, the shorter one usually precedes: \\"fame and fortune\\", \\"gold and silver\\", \\"care and custody\\", and so on. As both Peck and Cordier noted, the Latin language naturally lends itself to such phrases, making them part of everyday speech. Some apparent examples of alliteration therefore are likely to be fortuitous, for example Jesus's saying \\"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life\\" (John 14.6), which is translated from a Greek original.Peck (1884), p. 61; Rolfe (1943), p. 229. In prayers Some of the early prayers () which survive, such as the one which begins as follows, are partly alliterative, but the alliteration is not maintained throughout the prayer:McGann (1958), p. 303. : : :\\"Father Mars, I pray and beg you :that you be willing and propitious\\" It contains alliterative lines such as this: : :\\"that you may keep the herdsmen and the cattle safe\\" However, much of the prayer is not alliterative. McGann (1958) concludes that alliteration is an important but occasional device which adds greatly to the effect of the composition, but does not perform a structural function in the as a whole. In poetry The earliest Latin poems, unlike early Germanic and English poetry, do not have obligatory alliteration. Most of the fragments of the early accentual Saturnian poetry listed by Lindsay exhibit no alliteration, although some do, for example the following line, attributed to Naevius (c.270–c.201 BC), which has alliteration of M, P, and T: :Lindsay (1893), p. 155. :\\"A tumult of great fear possesses their hearts\\" The epic poet Ennius (c.239–c.169 BC) made very frequent use of alliteration. In the following hexameter, the primary alliteration with T is supported by a secondary medial alliteration of R to reinforce the idea of terror and trembling: :Cited by Peck (1884), p. 60. :\\"The rough land of Africa trembles with terrifying tumult.\\" T and R are also used in the following often-quoted line:Peck (1884), p. 60. : :\\"but the trumpet with terrifying sound went 'taratantara!'\\" To a greater extent than later poets, Ennius often uses the same alliteration throughout the line:Bailey (1947), p. 148. : :\\"nor stay captured when captured, nor burn when set on fire\\"Macrobius 6.60, translated R.A. Kastner (2011) (Loeb). Another famous line is the following: : :\\"O Titus Tatius, you yourself, o king, have brought such great (troubles) on yourself!\\" This line was quoted with disapproval for its excessive alliteration in the Rhetorica ad Herennium 4.12, and some modern critics have called it \\"almost absurd\\"Bailey (1947), vol 1, p. 148. or \\"embarrassing\\".Austin (1970), p. 132. Another Ennius example, which Austin describes as \\"noble\\",Austin (1970), p. 132. is the following iambic octonarius. Here there is assonance between and at corresponding places in the two halves of the line, combined with alliteration of C, S, and minor alliteration of P and L: : :\\"O great temples of the heaven-dwellers, mixed with splendid stars.\\" The comic playwright Plautus also has innumerable instances of alliteration, usually for comic effect:Bailey (1947), vol. 1, p. 147. :Plautus, , 252. :\\"He couldn't in a few words have said more in a plain way.\\" :Plautus, , 157. :\\"You with the axe, I'm putting you in charge of the wood-cutting province!\\" The other surviving comic playwright, Terence, by contrast, used alliteration hardly at all,Bailey (1947), p. 147. and this is a major difference between his work and that of Plautus. Naeke, who quotes numerous examples from Plautus, can cite only a few from Terence, including the following: :Terence, 131. :\\"Let him squander it, lose it, and perish; I don't care!\\" Cicero has frequent examples of alliteration in his poetry, but usually involving only two or three words in any one verse.Bailey (1947), p. 149. In the following lines, which describe the killing of Orion by the Scorpion as depicted in the stars, the primary alliteration of V V V is accompanied by minor alliteration of D, C, T, F and R: : : :\\"this struck him down, when he was eagerly hunting, with a powerful blow, :pouring deadly poison through the wounds into his veins\\" Lucretius and Virgil also both used alliteration widely, Lucretius \\"with striking power in many memorable passages\\" (Austin), for example the following, where P, C, Q and R are mingled: :Lucretius, 1.14–16. :\\"then wild beasts gambol over the joyful fields and swim across rapid streams; so, captured by delight, they follow you eagerly wherever you proceed to lead each one\\" In Virgil, alliteration was \\"no longer an external ornament ... but an inner secret of sound, subtly employed to serve emotion\\".Austin (1970), p. 133. An example is the following line, in which the consonants in the first half of the line (CRNT, MTS) are mirrored by those in the second half (MTS, CRNT): :Virgil, Aeneid 6.333 :\\"There he discerns, sad, and lacking the honour of death\\" In Horace and Catullus it occurs much less frequently. Nonetheless even in Catullus there are lines such as the following with its alternation of C, G, T and D sounds, which appear to imitate the shaking of a tambourine: :Catullus, 63.10-11. :\\"And shaking the hollow back of a bull with her tender fingers :she began to sing as follows, trembling, to her companions.\\" In his lament for his dead brother the chiastic alliteration F M M F is reinforced by minor alliteration of T: :Catullus 101. :\\"Receive these gifts soaked with brotherly tears.\\" Ovid employs alliteration much less obviously than Lucretius and Virgil (some examples are given below). He sometimes seems to play with words, as when Apollo tells his son Phaethon: :Ovid, Metamorphoses 2.101. :\\"Do not doubt! It will be given.\\" In Lucan alliteration is found, although not as commonly as in Virgil. His epic poem on the Civil War begins as follows, with an alliteration on C, P and V: : : : :\\"We sing of wars worse than civil across the Emathian plains, :and of licence given to crime, and a powerful people :who turned against their own innards with victorious right hand.\\" Alliteration is rarely used in Juvenal and Martial, although there are occasional phrases such as the following from Juvenal: :Juvenal Satura 1.18. :\\"to spare paper which is going to perish anyway\\" or the following from Martial, in which L, C, and S are interwoven: :Martial 1.44 :\\"the playful races of hares and the games of lions\\" In prose Although alliteration is found most often in poetry, Pontano notes that prose writers also sometimes used it, and quotes from a sentence from Cicero's treatise Brutus:cf. Naeke, p. 333. :Cicero, Brutus 38.142. :\\"Nothing penetrates their minds more and moulds, forms, and persuades them\\". In his speeches, Cicero uses alliteration sparingly, but effectively, as in famous suggestion to Catiline: :Cicero, 1.10. :\\"The gates are open; depart!\\" Again using assonance as well as alliteration, in an emotional moment of indignation in the he says: :Cicero, 19, cited by Brock (1911). :\\"when those hostile and calamitous torches ... when slaughter, when the blood of citizens, when the ashes of our fatherland had begun...\\" Near the ending of the 2nd Philippic oration Cicero uses both alliteration and assonance to add force to an unexpected metaphor. The major alliteration, on stressed initial syllables, is D P P D P; but there is also internal or minor alliteration of L D D L as well as assonance of PAR PAR: :Cicero, 2.118 :\\"so that at long last the pain of the Roman people may give birth to what it has long been in labour with!\\" In another example from the same paragraph of the 2nd Philippic, with alternation of M, R, and L, Cicero says: : :\\"that by dying I may leave the Roman people free.\\" Some orators evidently used alliteration too much, however, causing the author of the (c. 80 BC) to complain about \\"the excessive use of the same letter\\".Peck (1884), p. 59. Among historians Nepos, according to Rolfe, used it \\"to excess\\".Rolfe (1943), p. 228. The following sentence is an example: :Nepos, Themistocles 10. :\\"We approve especially of the same historian Thucydides, who says that he (Themistocles) died in Magnesia of an illness, but he does not deny that there is a rumour that he took poison of his own accord when he was despairing that he would be able to deliver what he had promised the King concerning the conquering of Greece.\\" Tacitus did not make great of use alliteration generally, but was fond of alliterative pairs of words such as \\"generosity and extravagance\\" or \\"by laziness of the generals, and insurrection of the legions\\".Annālēs 1.4; Hist. 3.46; quoted by Austin (1970), p. 133. Alliteration became very frequent again in north African authors of the 2nd and 3rd century A.D.: \\"It occurs on almost every page of Apuleius, Fronto, and Tertullian, and is very common in Cyprian.\\"Brock, D.M. (1911), Studies in Fronto and His Age, (Cambridge), p. 221. An example from Apuleius, in which the alliteration is reinforced by the rhythm of the line: :Apuleius, 1.25. :\\"Not even the god of Delphi himself would easily discern which of the two of us lying there was the more dead\\" Statistical studies Some scholars have performed statistical studies on different poets. Clarke (1976) compared Virgil and Ovid, finding minor differences in their usage. For example, Ovid tends frequently to put alliterating words in the first half of the verse, while Virgil is more likely to put them in the second half.Clarke (1976), p. 297. In both poets, the most likely position for an alliterating word is after the 3rd-foot caesura, and the second most common the beginning of the verse. Often there is alliteration in both of these places at once, as in the following line of Ovid: :Ovid, Metamorphoses 2.769; Clarke (1976), p. 292; 294-5. :\\"flesh of vipers, nutrition for her vices\\" Greenberg (1980), who criticises Clarke's study as statistically unsound in some respects,Greenberg (1980), p. 585. compares Virgil and Lucretius. One of his conclusions is that Lucretius is more likely than Virgil to use three or more initially alliterating words in the same line,Greenberg (1980), p. 608. for example: :Lucretius, , 1.341. :\\"(we see) many things moving in many ways by various means\\" In order to simplify their investigation, neither scholar takes internal alliteration into account, or alliterations such as which spread over more than one line. However, Greenberg states: \\"There is no intrinsic reason why alliteration should be limited to the confines of a single verse or to word-initials.\\"Greenberg (1980), p. 585. Certain letters are used in alliteration more frequently than others. In Virgil, according to Clarke, the commonest letters for word-initial alliteration are a, c, p, s, m, t, d, e, f, i, n, v;Clarke (1976), p. 280; cf. Rolfe (1943), p. 229. alliteration with b is very rare.Greenberg (1980), p. 610. However, when an alliterating word comes after a verse-break such as a caesura, the letter a is less common, coming only in 6th or 7th place.Clarke (1976), p. 298. Usually a letter alliterates only with itself, but sometimes qu can alliterate with c; ph may alliterate with p; ae and au may alliterate with a; and sc, sp, st may alliterate with s.Rolfe (1943), p. 230. From both studies, it is clear that when only two words in a line begin with the same letter, it is difficult or impossible to identify objectively whether the alliteration is accidental or deliberate, since alliterated words occur no more often in any line than would be due to chance. To identify whether alliteration is present, more subjective criteria must be used, such as whether the two words are important for the meaning of the line. Thus although Lucretius 3.267 () is counted as an example of alliteration by Greenberg's computer programme,Greenberg (1980), p. 604. it is doubtful if alliteration can be made on a weak word such as \\"and\\". When two pairs of words alliterate in the same line, the order abab is most common, then aabb, then abba. An example of the last is the following from Virgil:Clarke (1976), p. 284. :Aeneid 12.720. :\\"they exchange wounds with much violence\\" Although alliteration is common in Virgil, Ovid, and Lucretius, it is not found in every line. Overall, some 35-40% of lines in both Virgil and Ovid have no word-initial alliteration at all; in many of the remainder, the alliteration may well be accidental.Clarke (1976), p. 280. Uses of alliteration Linking alliteration Frequently alliteration simply adorns and beautifies a verse, without adding any particular emphasis.Rolfe (1943), p. 236. As Headlam (1920) notes, often the alliteration runs through a passage, linking together the various clauses, as in the opening of Aeneid 4, where the letters C, C, V, V, T, T recur repeatedly, as well as assonances such as , , and : : : : : : :\\"But the Queen, for a long time now wounded with serious passion, :feeds the wound in her veins and is tormented by unseen fire. :The man's courage keeps occurring to her mind, :and the nobility of his race; his face and words remain fixed in her heart :and her love gives no peaceful sleep to her limbs.\\" In his commentary on these lines, Ingo Gildenhard suggests that in the repeated alliteration with V in three pairs of words, Virgil seems to be hinting at a thematic link between the \\"wound\\" of Dido and the \\"manliness\\", \\"face\\", and \\"words\\" of Aeneas.Ingo Gildenhard (2012), Virgil: Aeneid 4.1-299 Cambridge, Open Book Publishers. Synonyms and antonyms Another use for alliteration is to link together synonyms or thematically similar words:Rolfe (1943), p. 231. : :.Aeneid 12.764-5 :\\"For it is not _unimportant_ or _sporting_ prizes which are being competed for, :but they are fighting over the life and blood of Turnus.\\" :Aeneid 1.333. :\\"driven here by _the wind_ and by _huge waves_ \\" :Aeneid 10.607. :\\"O my _sister_ , who art also my _most dear wife_ \\" :Aeneid 1.401 :\\" _Be on your way_ , and _direct your step_ wherever the road takes you.\\" In the following example, the great quantity of blood when the two bulls fight is emphasised by the alliteration on the words \\"copious\\" and \\"they wash\\": : :Aeneid 12.721-2 :\\"Leaning they stab their horns and with _copious_ blood : _they wash_ their necks and shoulders, and the whole forest echoes with bellowing.\\" Alliteration can also be used in both prose and verse to emphasise an antithesis between two opposite things:Austin (1970), p. 133. :Aeneid 12.894-5. :\\"it is not _your words_ but _the gods_ who terrify me\\" Onomatopoeia Frequently both Lucretius and Virgil use alliteration onomatopoeically to paint pictures in sound. Thus alliteration with S may represent the whooshing of an arrow or a spear, the sound of waves breaking on the rocks, or the hissing of serpents:Rolfe (1943), p. 233. : :.Virgil, Aeneid 11.753-4 :\\"But the wounded serpent writhes its sinuous coils :and bristles with raised scales and hisses with its mouth\\" R, C, T, and S may call up \\"loud and violent sounds\\".Rolfe (1943), p. 233. In the following lines the alliteration is reinforced by assonance of or, or and to, to, tu, tu: : :Aeneid 12.756-7 :\\"just then there arises a shout and the river banks and lakes :echo round about and the sky thunders with the tumult\\" C, R, T imitate the crackling of flames in the following lines of Lucretius: :Lucretius 6.155; cf. Rolfe (1943), p. 231. :\\"with a terrifying sound it burns up in a crackling flame\\" C and T can also imitate the sounds of musical instruments, as in these lines of Lucretius:Bailey (1947), p. 153. : :Lucretius 2.618-9. :\\"Taut timbrels thunder in their hands, and hollow cymbals all around, :and horns menace with harsh-sounding bray\\" In the opening of Virgil's first Eclogue, as in the line of TheocritusThe Greek is: . that it imitates, the T and P sounds have been explained as the whispering of the leaves of the tree:Niklas (2009). p. 2. :.Virgil, Eclogue 1.1. :\\"Tityrus, you who are lying under the shade of a spreading beech tree.\\" M may represent the rolling of thunderBailey (1947), p. 153. or the roaring of the sea:Rolfe (1943), p. 233. :Aeneid 1.124 :\\"meanwhile the sea began to stir with a loud roaring\\" With the letters P and D Virgil can represent the sound of men running: :Aeneid 12.748. :\\"he presses hotly with his foot the foot of the panicking Turnus\\" The alternation of T Q C and G combined with a dactylic rhythm can imitate the takkatak takkatak sound of a horse cantering across the plain: :Aeneid, 9.50. :\\"his horse carries him and a golden helmet with a red crest covers his head\\" The letter H, which is only rarely used, can imitate the panting of a dog: :Aeneid 12.753-4 :\\"but the lively Umbrian dog sticks to it panting\\" In this line, describing the fate of some Lycian peasants who have been transformed into frogs, Ovid uses the alliteration (with assonance) of QUA QUA to represent their quacking, even before revealing what creatures they have been metamorphosed into: :Ovid, 6.376 :\\"Though they be under water, under water they still try to curse her.\\" In the following highly alliterative line it has been suggested that Ovid is imitating the chattering sound of the local Black Sea languages:Holzberg (2009). p. 12. :.Ovid, , 5.12.58 :\\"By now I have learnt to speak in Getic and Sarmatic.\\" Light and liquid As Bailey points outBailey (1947), p. 153. often a key word will set the alliteration in a line. Thus \\"rumbling\\" will suggest the letters M and R, \\"wind\\" and \\"force\\" will suggest V, and the letter L, the initial of and (both meaning \\"light\\"), may represent the effects of light:Rolfe (1943), p. 233. : :Aeneid 7.8-9 :\\"The breezes breathe into the night; nor does the bright moon deny their passage; :the sea glistens beneath its trembling light.\\" Likewise in the following lines from book 2 of the Aeneid the L, C, and ŪC sounds of the word \\"light\\" are picked out and repeated: : :.Aeneid 2.693-4 :\\"There was thunder on the left, and from the sky gliding through the darkness :a star, drawing a trail, ran with much light.\\" L can also suggest the gliding of liquid,Rolfe (1943), p. 234; Bailey (1947), p. 153. as at Lucretius 5.950, where there is secondary alliteration of R: : : :\\"from whom slippery streams flowing with moisture were learning how to wash the wet rocks with plentiful overflow\\" Both ideas are combined in the following lines, also from Lucretius: : :Lucretius, 5.280 :\\"Likewise, a plentiful spring of liquid light, the etherial sun, :constantly irrigates the sky with fresh brightness.\\" Echo alliteration Another use of alliteration in Virgil is to emphasise particular key words or names. Headlam (1921) demonstrates how when Virgil introduces a proper name he often uses echoes of the sound of that name through alliteration or assonance in nearby words, a technique he refers to as \\"echo alliteration\\":Headlam (1920), p. 24; Headlam (1921), p. 61-2. :Aeneid 6.287 :\\"and hundred-handed Briareus and the beast of Lerna\\" :Aeneid 3.183. :\\"Cassandra used to sing of such events.\\" :Virgil, 2.4-5. :\\"Come hither, Father Lenaeus – here everything is filled with your gifts.\\" :Aeneid 2.291 :\\"Priam ... Pergama\\". Not only proper names but also other key words can be highlighted in this way. In the passage below, the god Faunus and the wild olive tree () both play a significant role in the story. The first of these is highlighted by the alliteration F F F; the second by assonance (). There are further echoes in the syllables , , and in the second line: : :Aeneid 12.766-7 :\\"By chance, sacred to Faunus, a wild olive with bitter leaves :had stood here, a piece of wood once venerable for sailors.\\" Dramatic moments Alliteration is frequently used in the Aeneid at moments of high drama, such as the moment that Aeneas's enemy Turnus is finally struck down by Aeneas in book 12. In this passage can be heard first the noisy STR STR imitating the sound of the spear's flight, then the vocalic alliteration of I I I as Turnus falls, and finally an assonance of PLI PLI as his knees buckle: : :Aeneid 12.926-7. :\\"Whooshing, (the spear) passes through his thigh. The huge Turnus, :struck, falls to the ground with folded knee.\\" Another warrior dies in book 9 of the Aeneid as follows, with primary alliteration of V V, F F, and secondary alliteration of L L and NG NG: : :Aeneid 9.414. :\\"He rolls over, vomiting a hot stream from his chest, :and becoming cold shakes his flanks with long gulps.\\" Ovid also sometimes uses alliteration to mark significant moments in the story, as when he describes Echo's transformation. Here the alliteration of F F is accompanied by an assonance of OSS ISS: :Ovid, Metamorphoses 3.337. :\\"Her voice remains, but they say her bones took on the appearance of a stone.\\" When Scylla silently enters her father's bedroom and cuts off the lock of hair whose loss will destroy the city, the letter T is constantly repeated, the word \\"crime\\" and \\"fatal\\" are emphasised by alliteration of F, and are linked by the assonance of NT. Finally alliteration of S emphasises the word \\"robs\\": : : :Ovid, 8.84-6. :\\"Silently she enters her father's bedroom :and (alas, dreadful deed!) the daughter robs the parent :of his fatal lock\\" In the following lines Ovid describes the dangerous moment in the flight of Icarus when he flies too close to the sun. Here the consonants D and C of the word \\"daring\\" are echoed through two lines, before giving way to T T T: : : :Ovid, 8.223-5 :\\"when the boy began to take pleasure in audacious flight :and abandoned his leader, and drawn by desire for the sky :flew on a higher path.\\" Emotional speech Alliteration and assonance also often add emphasis to expressions of emotion, such as anger, scorn, grief, panic, and terror,Rolfe (1943), p. 234. as in the following lines from book 2 of the Aeneid, where the ghost of Hector orders Aeneas to flee. Here alliteration is combined with assonance of and : : : :Aeneid 2.290-2. :\\"The enemy holds the walls! Troy is falling from its high rooftops. :Enough has been given to out fatherland and to Priam; if Pergama were able to be defended :by a right hand, it would have been defended even by this one!\\" In book 12 of the Aeneid Turnus's sister cries these words, alternating the M and T of and (both words meaning \\"fear\\"), and combining it with assonance of ē and em: :Aeneid 12.875 :\\"Do not terrify me, who am already scared!\\" Aeneas taunts his enemy with alliteration of T C S and assonance of VER VA VAR VA AR A as follows: : : :Aeneid 12.891-3 :\\"Turn yourself into any shape and draw together whatever :you can in courage or skill; choose to fly on wings into the stars on high :or bury yourself enclosed in the hollow earth!\\" In his reply, Turnus combines alliteration of T F D with assonance of FER TER FER TER: : :Aeneid 12.894-5 :\\"Shaking his head, he replied, 'It is not your hot words that terrify me, :fierce though you are; it is the gods who terrify me, and Jupiter my enemy!\\" Decline of alliteration Tastes in alliteration gradually changed, and some writers, such as Plautus, Ennius, Lucretius, and Virgil, used it much more freely than others such as Catullus or Horace.Peck (1884), p. 60. From the first century AD it became less common. The scholar Servius (c.400), who wrote a commentary on Virgil, commented on the triple alliteration of Aeneid 3.183 ( \\"Cassandra used to sing of these events\\") and similar phrases: \\"This style of composition is now considered a fault, although our ancestors liked it\\".Peck (1884), p. 59. He also disapproved of phrases such as (Aeneid 2.27) in which the final syllable of a word was repeated in the next word.Naeke (1829), p. 332. A few years later Martianus Capella (fl. 410-20) wrote: \\"It is a very great fault in composition not to avoid the constant use of a letter repeated ad nauseam.\\"Peck (1884), p. 59. Alliteration in Anglo-Latin poetry From the 7th century onwards English scholars began writing poetry in Latin, beginning with Aldhelm, Abbot of Malmesbury in Wiltshire. Imitating and perhaps even exceeding the type of alliteration familiar in Old English, poems were written such as the following, attributed to Aldhelm himself, which displays both major and minor alliteration:Lapidge (1979), p. 218. : : : : :\\"A whirlwind was coming over the land :with smooth hailstones, :which in throngs from the sky :are sieved by the black clouds.\\" Aldhelm also used alliteration in many of his hexameter lines, such as the following:Lapidge (1979), p. 221. : :\\"while Titan (= the sun) traverses the lands with his slanting beam\\" Lapidge (1979) discusses where exactly alliteration should be sought: at the beginning of the word, on the stressed syllable, or on the verse ictus. However, these questions still remain largely unanswered. Another highly alliterative work produced in England is the (\\"Melody of Love\\") written about 1330 by the Yorkshire mystic Richard Rolle. An excerpt of this work, which is written in prose, but with some characteristics of verse, is the following:Liegey (1956), p. 372; de Ford (1986). : : : : :\\"But I fell in love with a Beloved, on whom the Angels :of the Omnipotent pant to gaze. :And Mary, the miraculous mother of mercy, :I was caressing to myself in honey-flowing softness.\\" The same author's is a shorter poem written in alliterative verse.Liegey (1956). At about the same time as Richard Rolle wrote this, an Alliterative Revival also began in English poetry, and in the same part of England. Bibliography * Austin, R.G.

He was the Hukbalahap's vice- commander, second only to its Supremo, Luis Taruc. Alejandrino was one of the few supporters of the Hukbalahap that were also landlords, coming from the Alejandrino family which included former revolutionary general Jose Alejandrino. Biography Alejandrino was born on November 18, 1911 in Arayat, Pampanga. His family included Jose Alejandrino, the former revolutionary general and Senator. In the 1930s, Alejandrino managed to inherit 68 hectares of land in Arayat with fourteen tenants. He also became an active spokesperson for the peasant group Aguman ding Maldang Talapagobra and the Socialist Party of the Philippines. In 1938, when the PSP merged with the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas, Alejandrino held a position in the party's central committee. During the 1940 elections, Alejandrino ran under the AMT- endorsed Popular Front ticket and won a seat as mayor of Arayat. During the Second World War, members of the PKP along with peasant groups such as the AMT and the Kalipunang Pambansa ng Magbubukid sa Pilipinas convened in Cabiao, Nueva Ecija to discuss organization, strategy, and tactics. A Central Luzon Bureau was formed and Alejandrino was elected as second-in-command of its Military committee, under Luis Taruc. A month later on March 29, 1942, peasant guerrillas and members of the AMT and the KPMP met again in Cabiao to form the Hukbalahap. It was headed by Taruc, Alejandrino, who also served as its vice- commander, Felipa Culala, and Bernardo Poblete. During this time, Alejandrino adopted multiple aliases, such as Guan Yek (GY), Torres, GI, and Tatang. Alejandrino participated in guerrilla activity at this time, commanding Reco 3 in addition to his duties as General HQ vice-commander. The Huks also set up \\"provisional governments\\" in its liberated areas, and Alejandrino was appointed the governor of Pampanga. At the close of the Second World War, American officials began arresting members of the Hukbalahap on charges of sedition. Alejandrino was arrested along with other leaders on February 1945 in San Fernando, Pampanga. A CIC report stated that their arrest was \\"the only way to end Huk domination in the area\\". They were freed on September 1945. The Hukbalahap was officially disbanded and a Huk Veterans' League, with Alejandrino as its nominal chairman. The purpose of the Veterans' League was to help get the Hukbalahap recognized as a legitimate guerrilla movement. During this time, the relationship between the American forces and the Hukbalahap deteriorated further, owing to its antagonistic relationship with the USAFFE guerrillas. Huk veterans were persecuted and charged with sedition and rebellion, and some veterans chose to not go down from the mountains. This lack of recognition, combined with peasant abuses by the landowning class, and the results of the 1946 elections, added to the growing unrest in Central Luzon. This led to former Huk veterans going back to the mountains, a situation described as a \\"spontaneous peasant revolution\\". In June 1946, veterans of the Hukbalahap met in Candaba, Pampanga to form a contingency plan. The Central Luzon Command and the South Luzon Command were both established. Alejandrino was again elected vice-commander. Two months later, Juan Feleo, a noted peasant activist, was taken and killed by armed men. As a result of this, the peasantry took to arms against the government in open rebellion, reforming the Hukbalahap as the Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan. Alejandrino would resume his guerrilla activities, commanding Reco 4 from 1949-1951. On February 15, 1954, Alejandrino went into talks with the Magsaysay administration, which failed. That April, he arrived in the Bulacan area of the Sierra Madre, carrying an order from the PKP secretariat to arrest Taruc on charges of deviating from the party line, leading to Taruc's surrender to the government. Alejandrino continued the struggle for three more years. In 1957, Alejandrino met up with remnants of the HMB in Zambales and gradually implement the strategy of legal struggle, ending the armed rebellion of the Hukbalahap. On October 21, 1960, Alejandrino was arrested in Malabon on charges of violating RA 1700, known as the Anti-Subversion Law, and was imprisoned. He died on July 12, 2005. Personal life Alejandrino was a member of the well-to-do Alejandrino family, who were landowners in Pampanga. Members include General Jose Alejandrino, Pio Valenzuela (through Valenzuela's mother's side), Arayat mayor Bonifacio Emmanuel \\"Bon\\" Alejandrino, and president of the Hukvets foundation, Carlos Alejandrino. Bon and Carlos are both Casto's nephews. During his time in the guerrilla movement, Alejandrino had a wife and children living in the barrio. He also had two \\"forest wives\\" while in the field, Teofista Valerio and Belen Bagul-Bagul. Valerio (alias \\"Estrella\\") was the head of Huk communications in Manila. Valerio and Alejandrino were married in a Huk ceremony on May 26, 1948. Alejandrino and Valerio were separated on August 4, 1949, and would not meet until exactly twenty years later in 1970. They had one daughter. After Valerio's arrest and their separation, Alejandrino met Belen Bagul-Bagul. They were never married, although they had four children.

Biography  He was the son of Joaquin de Quiroga Melgarejo y Rojas, 1st Marquis de Melgarejo; and of Joaquina Saurín y Ruiz-Dávalos. In 1817 he married Maria Luisa de Borbón y Vallabriga, daughter of Luis of Spain, Count of Chinchón and his wife María Teresa de Vallabriga. His wife was a granddaughter of King Philip V of Spain but not an Infanta because her mother wasn't of royal blood. Her sister María Teresa de Borbón, 15th Countess of Chinchón had married and divorced Manuel Godoy, the de facto ruler of Spain between 1792 and 1808. Joaquín José de Melgarejo fought against the French during the Peninsular War and reached the rank of Brigadier general. In 1815, King Ferdinand VII made him Duke of San Fernando de Quiroga. He was also a senator as well as a knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece (1823) and the Order of Calatrava. In September 1819 he became Prime Minister of Spain until March 1820. Between 1828 and 1829, he was the owner of the Christ Crucified by Velázquez, before he gave it to the King, who gave the painting to the Prado Museum. De Melgarejo was going to be named Prócer del Reino in 1835, but died before he could take up the post. Having no children, he was succeeded as Duke of San Fernando de Quiroga by the son of his cousin Isabel Melgarejo, Francisco Javier de Losada y Melgarejo.

In baseball statistics, an error is an act, in the judgment of the official scorer, of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or baserunner to advance one or more bases or allows an at bat to continue after the batter should have been put out. In baseball and softball, second baseman is a fielding position in the infield, between third and first base. The second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet, needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly, and must be able to make the pivot on a double play.

It rules mostly on divorces and conversions although it has ruled on other matters at various times.  History  The MBD has existed in various iterations. The first Beth Din was set up with the assistance of Moses Rintel, who later served as the head of the Beth Din. This was the first Beth Din in the British Empire outside of London. There were a series of Melbourne rabbis who served on the Beth Din, including: * Harry Freedman, a widely respected scholar and senior translator at Soncino Press * Sir Israel Brodie, later Chief Rabbi of the Commonwealth * Joseph Abrahams * Elias Blaubaum * Jacob Danglow * Isaac Jacob Super, head of the Melbourne United Shechitah Board From the 1960s the Beth Din had a series of long standing heads, beginning with Isaac Rapaport and Sholem Gutnick. *Yonason Abraham, who later served as the head of the London Beth Din Sholom Gutnick was a particularly controversial person, and the Beth Din under his leadership was dissolved and closed for a few years following a forced retirement that was triggered by allegations of nepotism and serious irregularities including financial problems in what was described as a one-man show. Gutnick would appoint and fire judges at will without consulting the other rabbis in the community, and despite the protests of the communal rabbinate, they did nothing to remove him from this self-appointed role. As a result of this poor management the standing of the MBD was lowered and the Sydney Beth Din became the default for most communities around Australia. Following the tenure of Sholom Gutnick, the Beth Din was closed down and restructured under the joint control of the Rabbinical Council of Victoria (RCV) and the Council of Orthodox Synagogue of Victoria (COSV), and Gutnick's nephew, Mordechai Gutnick was given the role of senior judge. In 2017 the MBD conducted a wide-ranging review of its procedures that included rabbis currently sitting on the Beth Din, other communal rabbis, and lay people. There has been criticism of the selection of judges, because they are universally from the ultra-Orthodox Chabad sect.  Conversions  One of the roles of the MBD is to oversee Orthodox conversions to Judaism. This process is often mired in controversy, with London at times overruling the decisions of the Australian Beth Din, and the topic causing tension between Joseph Abrahams and his community, forcing the rabbi to briefly resign his post. This difficulty in conversion in the early days of the settlement of Australia led to many Jews marrying non-Jews and assimilating into Australian culture. Today many of the conversions performed are done for marriage or due to Jewish ancestry. Today, the process of converting internationally is mired in controversy and politics especially in Israel. In this environment, the MBD is one of the few internationally recognised conversion programs. However, the program regularly takes several years, and requires extensive examinations before the Beth Din will consider a convert. However, in spite of this most Orthodox synagogues in Melbourne will direct conversion candidates to the MBD. Since the appointment of Mordechai Gutnick, the MBD still has significant procedural and cultural problems, a lack of transparency, an opaque appeals process that includes a loophole to avoid the appeals process if they so desired. In recent years a number of conversion courts have been set up independently of the MBD. These have been run by rabbis Yaron Gottlieb, Meir Rabi, and the Ark Centre. The conversions performed by the Ark Centre caused some controversy when MBD rejected all their conversions, although they offered a path to conversion for those who were converted through the Ark. It is unclear what the status of the converts who did not take up the path to conversion. This decision was a rejection of Rabbi Yisrael Rosen who oversaw the conversions from Israel, and in opposition to the Halacha, and a longstanding convention in Orthodoxy.  Divorces  The other main focus of the MBD is in the area of divorces. In Jewish law a divorce can be vetoed by either side (but the consequences are more serious for the woman) there are a number of instances of both the man and the woman refusing to give the bill of divorce (gett). The MBD have a number of ways of dealing with this, including a pre-nuptial agreement, although this agreement in Australia is more of a guide and is not binding in any way on the two parties in the event of a divorce. The MBD deal with about 40 divorces per annum, but it is the cases of agunah, or gett refusal that takes most of their time. In a landmark case, the Victorian Magistrates Court ruled that gett refusal constitutes psychological and emotional abuse, however there are limits on this and there is danger that any law to try and force one party to provide a gett could run foul of the Australian constitution. While the Beth Din have tried to ease the suffering, they are very conservative in their interpretation of Halacha, and their procedures can cause cases to extend a lot longer than necessary.  Other rulings  The MBD has made a number of rulings over the years. An earlier ruling was made by the Beth Din during the tenure of Rabbi Brodie against communally organised ball sports on Shabbat. More recently the MBD has made strong statements against same sex marriage, and against the establishment of an eruv. The Beth Din at times have attempted to establish a civil tribunal, but these attempts have thus far failed. Despite this the MBD have called for all Jews to approach them and have strongly discouraged people from going to the secular courts. They are also attempting to create a register of who is a Jew for the purposes of marriage within the Orthodox community.  Alternative courts  There are a number of religious courts that claim jurisdiction in Victoria besides the MBD. The Progressive movement and Conservative movement each maintain a Beth Din, as does the Haredi Adass Yisrael community. In addition to these there are a number of ad hoc Orthodox conversion courts.

Albus has been identified as the son of the homonymous consul of 102, and Laevia Paulla; his great-grandfather was a priest of Artemis in Ephesus.Ronald Syme, Some Arval Brethren (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980), p. 92 n. 16  Life  His cursus honorum up to just before his consulate can be recovered from a Latin inscription found at Corinth. Albus began in his teens as one of the tresviri monetalis, the most prestigious of the four boards that make up the vigintiviri; assignment to this board was usually allocated to patricians or favored individuals. Next he was commissioned a military tribune with Legio I Minervia, which at the time was stationed at Bonna (modern Bonn), in the province of Germania Inferior. Next came his admission to the Arval Brethren, a priesthood that the emperor Augustus revived over a century before. Albus was favored in his advancement through the traditional Republican magistracies, being selected as the emperor Trajan's candidate for quaestor, followed by becoming the emperor Hadrian's candidate for plebeian tribune; once elected quaestor, he was also formally enrolled into the Roman senate. Albus then advanced to praetor, which professor Géza Alföldy dates to the year 121. Once he had discharged his duties as praetor, Albus then was appointed legatus proconsulis or assistant to the proconsular governor of either Asia or Africa; served as curator of several of the roads; and spent a year as governor of the public province of Achaea, which Werner Eck dates to the term 127/128.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 13 (1983), p. 164 Upon completing his governorship, Albus returned to Rome, for the records of the Arval Brethren show he was twice magister or head of the order. His suffect consulate followed. Two events mark his tenure as governor of Asia. One is the dedication of a gymnasium in Ephesus by a leading citizen of that city, Publius Vedius Antoninus. The second is a series of earthquakes that wreaked destruction in Mytilene, Ephesus, and Smyrna; Aristides claims to have ended these earthquakes with the sacrifice of an ox, thus gaining great fame.Aristides, Orations 49.38ff However, the year Albus was governor is disputed. One school of thought, championed by G.W. Bowersock, holds Albus was governor in the year 160/161.Bowersock, \\"The Proconsulate of Albus\\", Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, 72 (1968), pp. 289-294 Bowersock identifies the earthquake Aristides alludes to as the one of 161 by identifying the Asiarch in office during Albus' tenure, Tiberius Claudius Polydeucus Marcellus, with another one mentioned in an inscription from Magnesia on the Maeander which can be dated between 10 December 161 and 9 December 162. Bowersock also provides further evidence that Vedius Antoninus was active in the early 160s.Bowersock, \\"Proconsulate of Albus\\", pp. 293f The other school of opinion, championed by Eck, Alföldy, and Ronald Syme, argues that Aristides' earthquake happened earlier, between 147 and 149. Syme notes that Publius Mummius Sisenna Rutilianus, suffect consul in 146, better fits the years 160/161, and Bowersock's choice as governor in 146/147, Atilius Maximus, is a ghost, providing room for Albus to be dated earlier.Syme, \\"The Proconsuls of Asia under Antoninus Pius\\", Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 51 (1983), pp. 275f  References   Further reading  * Werner Eck, \\"Die Laufbahn des L.

It is long with 17 stations, and was constructed between 1933 and 1935. History Original line Construction of a railway line from Bei'an to Heihe was initiated by the Manchukuo National Railway, which had been formed in 1933 by nationalising privately owned railways in the territory of the puppet state of Manchukuo, which had been established by Imperial Japan in the previous year. Work on the new line, called the Beihei Line (Hokkoku Line in Japanese), began at Bei'an, terminus of the main line of the former Haike Railway, in August 1933, and the first section, from Bei'an to Chenqing, was opened in November 1934. Work on the remaining section, from Chenqing to Heihe, began in May 1934, and was completed in February 1935. The complete line was inaugurated on 1 December 1935, with 20 stations, 29 bridges, and one tunnel.Ma Qianli, Wang Kaichi, \\"A Brief History of Chronology of Chinese Railway Construction (1881-1981).\\" Beijing: China Railway Publishing House. 1983. In August 1945, the Soviet Army invaded Manchukuo and took control of the Beihei Line. When the Heilongjiang River froze that winter, they built a temporary bridge over the ice to connect the line to the Soviet Railways at Blagoveshchensk on the other side of the border. The Soviet Army used this temporary connection to ship equipment stolen from Manchuria, and prior to the withdrawal in April 1946, the Beihei Line was ransacked, with anything moveable - locomotives, rolling stock, bridge components, tracks, etc. - being shipped to the Soviet Union. In the spring of 1949, basic repairs were undertaken on the line, but due to the difficulty of running trains, the tracks were removed in the autumn of that year. Reconstruction The project to rebuild the Bei'an–Heihe railway line - named Beihei Railway by China Railway - was officially initiated in May 1963, and the section from Bei'an to Longzhen was reopened in September of the same year. Service on that section began on a temporary basis in August 1964. The line from Bei'an to Jusheng was opened in November 1965, and officially put into operation in January 1966. However, the stretch from Longzhen to Jusheng was soon dismantled again, and due to worsening relations between China and the USSR, the planned reconstruction of the Longzhen–Heihe section was suspended for many years, until it was finally begun on 15 July 1986. Work was completed on 19 September 1989, and regular service between Longzhen and Heihe commenced on 14 December.

We’ll support the Saudis in every practical way short of engaging in combat.\\" In 2018 UN experts called on the UK government to stop giving Saudi Arabia bombs to use in Yemen. In a 2019 Guardian article titled: \\"The Saudis couldn’t do it without us’: the UK's true role in Yemen's deadly war\\" Journalist Arron Merat explains: \\"Every day Yemen is hit by British bombs – dropped by British planes that are flown by British-trained pilots and maintained and prepared inside Saudi Arabia by thousands of British contractors.\\" Merat makes it clear that: \\"Britain does not merely supply weapons for this war: it provides the personnel and expertise required to keep the war going. The British government has deployed RAF personnel to work as engineers, and to train Saudi pilots and targeteers – while an even larger role is played by BAE Systems, Britain’s biggest arms company, which the government has subcontracted to provide weapons, maintenance and engineers inside Saudi Arabia.\\" In 2019 a Channel 4 documentary film named: \\"Britain's Hidden War: Channel 4 Dispatches\\", a former BAE Systems worker revealed that the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) would be unable to fly its fleet of Typhoon fighter jets without BAE's support; the former BAE worker explained: “With the amount of aircraft they’ve got and the operational demands, if we weren’t there in 7 to 14 days there wouldn’t be a jet in the sky.” United Nations reaction According to Agence France- Presse, The United Nations called Saudi-led coalition to instantly/completely lift the blockage on Yemen. The World Health Organization announced that there is a rapid incidence of diphtheria disease in 13 provinces of Yemen. This organization also added, the incidence of diphtheria in Yemen is regarded as a worrying problem. The Saudi Arabian-led coalition blocked all sea, land and air borders of Yemen after Ansar Allah's missile attack on Riyadh on 6 November 2017, and did not allow international aid to be delivered for Yemeni people. According to Iranian reports, there are approximately one million Yemenis who have been affected by cholera, and more than 2200 people died due to the disease, this led to protests against the blockade where the United Nations appealed to the Saudi Arabian-led military coalition to entirely lift its blockade of Yemen, saying up to 8 million people were “right on the brink of famine”.

Legal background  According to the international law of naval blockade the naval measures conducted by the coalition led by Saudi Arabia do not amount to a naval blockade in the legal sense. It is said that neither the international law of contraband nor the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2216 of 14 April 2015 cover the extensive enforcement measures. Due to the devastating famine in Yemen and supply shortage of essential goods, which are caused by the enforcement measures, the naval operations off the coast of Yemen are criticized as a violation of international humanitarian law.

Early life and education Walser was born in Maryland County on 24 July 1929 to Eugene Himie Shannon and Edith E. Harris. Her father was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. She went to school at St Theresa's convent in Monrovia and then to Secretarial College. She worked as private secretary to the Manager of the Bank of Monrovia for a number of years. She later returned to study at the University of Liberia, graduating with an LLB in 1969. Career Walser was appointed as a judge to the Montserrado County judicial circuit in 1971 by President William R. Tolbert Jr., making her the country's first female judge. She was seen as a progressive and liberal judge. \\"While it was customary for judges to decide cases based on instructions from the president, Walser gained a reputation for deciding cases strictly on merit and the law.\\" Walser publicly refused to sentence an indigenous man to a death sentence because she argued he had been poorly represented by a state lawyer, leading to a Supreme Court of Liberia finding in Republic of Liberia v. Emma Shannon-Walser, 27 LLR 274 (1978) that the constitutional right to counsel includes the right to competent counsel. In 1975, she was the head of a special committee appointed to study all laws affecting women's rights. In April 1979, Walser challenged the government's detention of opposition leaders alleged to have instigated the rice riots, a precursor to the 1980 Coup d'état. She was removed from the bench in 1979 by a joint resolution of the conservative Legislature. Five hundred Liberian women, including Olubanke King Akerele, petitioned and protested the action, to no avail. In 2007, Walser was named by the Liberian People's Party as one of those whose \\"only crime was the advocacy of participatory democracy.\\" Walser later worked for Amnesty International and moved to Switzerland. Honours In October 1975, Walser was one of six women presented the Pax Orbis ex Jure award by the World Peace through Law Center in Washington D.C. In 2006, Walser was invited by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to be the National Orator on Independence Day. In 2014, she was honoured by the Liberian National Bar Association for her services to the Liberian state.

There is much confusion surrounding Miller's early life. According to the information on her Daughters of the American Revolution application form, she was born Lola McDonald in Memphis, Missouri, to farmer Sterling Lynn McDonald and his wife Electa Summerlin; a birthplace of either Edina, Missouri or Croton, Iowa has also been posited, as has a birthyear of 1864 or 1866. She married Francis Sleeth, and from 1892 to 1899 was resident in San Francisco, where she studied with Douglas Tilden at the Mark Hopkins Art Institute. In Paris she studied with James Abbott McNeill Whistler and at the Académie Julian, and in New York City with Frederick MacMonnies and Emil Carlsen. She began working as an art teacher at the National Cathedral School in Washington, D.C. in 1901, remaining there for over thirty years. During her time in Washington she belonged to a number of local arts organizations; she exhibited with the Society of Washington Artists for the first time in 1910, and was a charter member of the Arts Club of Washington and a member of the Washington Water Color Club. Sometime in the 1920s she first visited Laguna Beach, California, and after marrying Sterling Miller in 1931 moved there permanently, living there until her death. At the time of her second marriage she was described as a \\"widow\\"; her second husband's name is sometimes given as Thomas. A scholarship was endowed in her honor after her death. Miller was active in a variety of formats during her career, producing landscapes, portraits, and still lifes in oil and watercolor as well as carving portrait busts in marble. Her most notable work is a bust of Martha Washington currently owned by the Daughters of the American Revolution and frequently displayed at Constitution Hall; it was used as the basis for a likeness of Washington on a 1938 postage stamp. Another work was formerly in the collection of the Corcoran Gallery of Art. She is also represented in the collection of the Cathedral Foundation in Washington. Due to her residency in the state later in life she is sometimes classed with other California artists.

It is still found in the three streams and in one it is said to be abundant but it is still threatened by water extraction, pollution and dam construction. In addition, waterbodies in the area it is found in are drying out because of climate change and unsustainable extraction of water for human use.

Born in either El Dorado or Chelsea, Kansas, Smith was one of ten children. She first studied art at the University of Kansas, from which she graduated in 1918. Her husband, Errett Smith, having been drafted, she relocated to New York City to await his return. There she took lessons at the Art Students League of New York. Further study came at the Art Institute of Chicago and at the Corcoran School of Art, where her teachers included Edmund C. Tarbell and Richard Sumner Meryman, Sr. She remained in the Washington, D.C. area for the rest of her life, taking classes at the Corcoran until 1930. During her career Smith exhibited with the Society of Washington Artists and showed work at the Corcoran Biennials. At the Society's exhibitions of 1936 and 1939 she received popular prizes; in 1929 she received a bronze medal. She showed a number of works at the Greater Washington Independent Exhibition of 1935, and in 1939 was part of an exhibit with the Landscape Club of Washington. Solo exhibits of her paintings were held in 1979 and 1984–1985, the latter at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. In 1936 Smith and her husband purchased a farm near Frederick, Maryland as a weekend retreat, and this was to provide her the source from which she found much subject matter. They lived in Chevy Chase beginning in 1949. Her husband died in 1974. Smith moved into a nursing home in Kensington, Maryland at the end of her life, and died there after a battle with Parkinson's disease. She was survived by two sisters. Stylistically, Smith's work has been described as Impressionistic. An oil on canvas titled Studio Portrait of a Model (Reggio) from the second half of the 1920s is currently in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. An undated oil, Carnival Fantasy, is owned by the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. The Tippler, an oil of 1930–1940, is owned by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; it is one of a number of paintings of elderly figures dating to that decade. The Morris Museum of Art owns Afternoon by the Beach, Chesapeake Bay, an oil on canvas from the 1930s, and the undated oil Washing Clothes in the East Yard. The Johnson Collection of Southern Art in Spartanburg, South Carolina owns six paintings, including a self-portrait. Smith is also represented in the collection of the Butler Institute of American Art, and was formerly represented in the collection of the Corcoran Gallery of Art.

Biography Miroslav Juhn was born on July 15, 1897, in Podgorač, a municipality near Našice, Croatia, to a Jewish family. Juhn finished high school in 1915 in Osijek. During World War I, he was mobilized and taken as a prisoner on the Eastern Front. In 1917, he took part in the Russian Revolution, and lived in Moscow. In 1921, he returned to Yugoslavia and joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. From 1922 to 1940, Juhn was a member of the Croatian Journalists' Association and worked for several prominent newspapers. He published discussions about the individual psychology of Alfred Adler from the viewpoint of Manès Sperber. Sperber warned about psychology's social and historical context on the problem of alienation. He assessed man's alienation as a product of the society in the early works of Marx (Književnik, 1934). The politician Božo Kovačević held Sperber to be one of the forerunners of the Praxis School. In 1939 and 1940, he took part in organizing the return of Yugoslav volunteers in the Spanish Civil War. In July 1941, Juhn was arrested and brought to the Jadovno concentration camp, where he was killed in August. Although the communist authorities listed him as a victim of Jadovno, he was officially listed as a victim of the Jasenovac concentration camp.

The suite was arranged from the film score by Lev Atovmyan (1901-1973) in 1954.Adriano (n.d.) The suite has seven movements: *I. Introduction *II. Romance (Meeting of Shibayev with Katya) *III. Scene from the Sea Battle *IV. Scherzo *V. The Assault on Krasnaya Gorka *VI. Intermezzo *VII. Finale It is scored for full orchestra. The fifth movement has been described as \\"a mini-piano concerto, in the style of, but even more Hollywood-like than, Addinsell's Warsaw Concerto of 1941.\\" This movement describes the attack on the Krasnaya Gorka fort outside St. Petersburg. Through mistranslation, the movement is sometimes known as The Attack on Beautiful Gorky. The music historian Marina Frolova-Walker comments that \\"it is indeed memorable music, although barely recognizable as Shostakovich and not even very appropriate to the on-screen action.\\"Frolova-Walker (2016), p. 111 The film was made in praise of Joseph Stalin, who was portrayed (inaccurately) as having played a leading role in the events of the Russian Civil War around St. Petersburg in 1919. In February 1953 Shostakovich's score for the film was being considered for a Stalin Prize, but he sought to withdraw the nomination. In any event Stalin's death in March 1953 meant that the prize awards were cancelled.Frolova-Walker (2016), pp. 110-111 Shostakovich himself had a low estimate of the film: according to Solomon Volkov, he commented that Stalin \\"liked watching Unforgettable 1919, where he rides by on the footboard of an armoured train with a sabre in his hand. This fantastic picture, naturally, had nothing to do with reality\\".Volkov (1995), pp. 254-255 The suite prepared by Atovmyan was first recorded by Melodiya in 1956 (omitting the fifth and sixth sections), with Alexander Gauk as conductor.

Jose Artiaga positioned themselves on a hill on the 10th BCT's flank overlooking the Korean village of Yultong in Yeoncheon County. The Chinese attacked them with superior numbers but Artiaga's unit made a stand. This bought time for his company commander, Captain Yap to launch a counterattack to rescue Artiaga and his platoon from the Chinese. Both Artiaga and Yap were killed in action. However, that action saved the platoon from total annihilation and stopped the Chinese advance from reaching the exposed flank of the 10th BCT. Lt. Jose Artiaga was conferred the United States Distinguished Service Cross as a consequence of his actions at the Battle of Yultong. Military awards Yap was conferred the Philippine Medal of Valor by Elpidio Quirino and the United States Distinguished Service Cross for his actions at the Battle of Yultong.

It is a Grade II* listed building. History The church was built in 1837, by Henry Goodridge, as a Commissioners' church in a Gothic revival style. Emma Sheppard, workhouse reformer was interred in the churchyard in 1871. In 2017 refurbishment work included new underfloor heating along with improved lighting and audio visual capabilities. The parish and benefice of Frome (Holy Trinity) are within the Diocese of Bath and Wells. Architecture It is a stone building. Nine of the stained glass windows were designed by Edward Burne-Jones. The figures are powerfully drawn, with vibrant colours and leafy backgrounds. They were made and installed by Morris & Co., between 1880 and 1918. A pamphlet available in the church has illustrations of all the windows with details of each commission. The only stained glass windows which were not designed by Burne-Jones are placed above the altar and were made and installed by the Horwood Brothers in 1875, a local firm from Great Elm, to commemorate the first vicar, Rev Alfred Daniel. Sadly they did not have the same expertise of Morris & Co; some of the painting of the faces has faded. Singer & Co installed an iron rood screen across the nave 1903-06; this has now been repositioned within a side chapel.

It was then that the Kunsthaus Zürich devoted an exhibition to 40 of his works, accompanied by a nine-page brochure,Amazon Books and thereafter paintings and posters of his began to appear in art showrooms.There are examples at Arcadja Later life Schwab did not leave Paris for several more years after giving up painting and was described as a “theatre personality” at the time he began a twenty-year relationship with the Swiss Valentine de Kerven (1901-1991).

In 1954 they made another difficult journey, driving overland to India via Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan in a Volkswagen, in order to visit Jiddu Krishnamurti. Not long afterwards Schwab started a sexual relationship with an 18-year-old and Valentine divorced him.Mukunda Rao, The Other Side of Belief, Penguin 2005 During the 1940s Schwab took a doctorate in Chemistry at the University of Geneva.

Life From the old Mecklenburgian family of Bassewitz, her parents were the privy councillor Joachim Otto von Bassewitz (1686–1733) and his wife Catharina Ilsabe (1693–1717). Adolph Graf von Bassewitz o.O. 1859:Aus dem Leben des Reichsgrafen Henning Friedrich von Bassewitz mit einigen Nachrichten über die Familie Bassewitz der wendischen Linie. o.O., 1859, Seite 46,47 On 15 July 1733 she married her cousin count Bernhard Matthias von Bassewitz (1706–1783), chamberlain in the grand-princely court of Holstein. The marriage proved childless and after her husband's death on 29 December 1783 she inherited his estate at Gut Dalwitz, where she spent her old age, met with the widowed Duchess Louise Friederike von Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1721–1791) and finally died in 1790. Her contemporaries considered her a \\"woman of great and rare talents\\" Schlichtegroll, S. 141. and was mentioned in the works of the philosophers Christian Wolff and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. In 1772 Von Bassewitz wrote the foreword to Freye Betrachtungen über die Psalmen David’s (Free Reflections on the Psalms of David) by Friderike Elisabeth von Grabow. She also wrote poems, including an ode marking her survival of breast cancer, which she is said to have achieved almost solely with the use of reticulum roots. Schlichtegroll, S. 142. She considered herself a good harpsichord player and wrote another ode dedicated to music. Schlichtegroll, S. 144. The anonymous 1768 pamphlet Das wirksamste Hülfsmittel für das entkräftete Mecklenburg: der gegenwärtigen ansehnlichen Convocations-Versammlung angerathen, von einem wohlgesinnten Patrioten (The most effective aid for exhausted Mecklenburg) is also attributed to von Bassewitz. Von Bassewitz corresponded with several scholars, including Johann Joachim Spalding and Voltaire. She and Voltaire collaborated on a Histoire de Charles XII (History of Charles XII) and other works. Her letters were admired at the time for the \\"purity and elegance of their style, their sharpness, their acquaintance with our literature, and for the heart of this rare woman\\".

III, p. 495 (\\"Pontidia\\", \\"Pontidius\\"). Origin The nomen Pontidius belongs to a class of gentilicia which were originally derived from cognomina ending in -idus. However, such names were so common that the ending -idius came to be regarded as a regular gentile-forming suffix, and was applied in cases where there was no morphological justification. This may have been the case with Pontidius, which is probably derived from the Oscan praenomen Pompo or Pomptus, which also gave rise to several other nomina, including Pompilius, Pomponius, and Pontius. Pompo was the Oscan cognate of the Latin praenomen Quintus, and thus Pontidius was equivalent to Latin gentes such as Quinctia and Quinctilia.Chase, pp. 121, 122, 127–129.

Pictures banner and directed by Babu Bhai Mistry. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, Vanisri in the lead roles and music composed by Satyam. Plot The film begins with Kshira Sagara Madanam where gods & demons churn the ocean to release Amrutham the nectar of immortal life when Lord Vishnu (N. T. Rama Rao) in the form of Jagan Mohini (Kanchana) the enchantress manages to lure the demons into handing over the Amrutham to Gods. Knowing it through Sage Narada (Kanta Rao), Lord Siva (Ramakrishna) speaks down about Vishnu stating that no one can cheat him as he is the man who burnt out the lust. Upon hearing it, Vishnu again arrives as Mohini, attracts Siva when he too falls for her beauty. Then Lord Vishnu shows in his original form and heckles at Siva where he challenges Vishnu that he will also teach him a lesson. Goddess Lakshmi (Vanisri) also argues with Vishnu that woman is superior to men, that's why Vishnu has taken a women form and they decide to prove it. Now Vishnu takes an avatar of sage Maya Machindra and preaches recites to get salvation. On the provocation of Narada, Lord Hanuman (Arjan Janardhan Rao) checks in to test Machindra when he recognizes him as his Lord and bows at his feet. Lord Siva takes the form of Gorakh and becomes a disciple of Machindra. Lakshmi takes birth as a queen, Tilottama Devi a men hater men and establishes a women kingdom. Listening to it, Machindra encounters her when she warns him. But her tricks does not succeed, so, she becomes his disciple, marries him and the couple is blessed with a baby boy Meenanatha. Learning it through Hanuman, Gorak decides to divert his mentor mind back to spirituality. But Tilottama Devi does not allow his attempts to become fruitful and also try to eliminate him. But Gorak succeeds in taking away his mentor along with him when his son's bondage pulls him back. At that moment, Gorak sends a snake on Meenanatha and he dies. Machindra tries to make the boy live, but he loses his powers due to physical bondage then Machindra asks Gorak to try, but he too fails. Disheartened, Gorak immolates himself, Hanuman brings out his ashes and requests Machindra to make Gorak alive when his attempt with a true heart flourish. At that point in time, Gorak questions why he is not able to make Meenanatha alive? There, Hanuman enlightens him that his entire power is devotion on his mentor which he has forgotten due to arrogance. Gorak realizes his mistake, prays to his mentor and makes Meenanatha alive. Finally, all of them reach back Vaikuntam when Lord Vishnu explains that the male & female are equal in the creation and humans must be spared from illusion. Cast *N. T.

In 1880 the owner of the Royal Alhambra Music Hall, John Betts Wigley was charged with assaulting and beating a comedian William White.

It may be hired out for private events.  History  The castle is first recorded in 1130 when Count Emicho of Schmidburg bequeathed it to Gerlach I of Veldenz. When the male line of the counts of Veldenz died out in 1444, the castle and the County of Veldenz went to Stephen of Palatinate-Simmern and fell, during the division of inheritance, to the line of Palatinate-Zweibrücken. Stephen's son, Louis the Black owned the castle from 1453 to 1489 and expanded it into a strong fortress. The castle suffered serious damage during the Thirty Years' War; it was transferred to the Spanish in 1620 and was taken over by Croats in 1622. In 1631, the Swedes entered the castle and used it as a barracks. In 1689 the castle was destroyed during the War of the Palatine Succession by the troops of King Louis XIV. Its ruins were returned to their original owner in 1693. During the French Revolution the castle was seized as 'national property'. The most comprehensive maintenance and renovation work since the destruction of the castle took place in 1977 and 1978. A few years later, from 1981 to 1983, a refuge hut was built over the cellar vaulting. The castle belongs today to the town of Obermoschel who, since 2005 have undertaken annual maintenance and improvement work. In 2007, parts of the castle site were planted with old species of rose and the meadow was planted with fruit trees.  Site  Copperplate of the castle from the 17th century A bergfried dominates the castle and can be seen from a long way off. In the 16th century, the castle was converted into a Renaissance schloß. A might shield wall of rusticated ashlar from the 12th/13th centuries has survived, as have the remains of the palas, gate tower, enceinte, stables and castle well.

In cardiac surgery and vascular surgery, external support (or external stent) is a type of scaffold made of metal or plastic material that is inserted over the outside of the vein graft in order to decrease the intermediate and late vein graft failure after bypass surgery (e.g. CABG). An external support (external stent) should be differentiated from a stent. An external support is placed on the outside of the vessel whereas a stent is inserted into the lumen of a vessel. __TOC__ Background Veins are adapted to an environment of low pressure and low flow. In order to bypass the coronary obstruction and restore blood flow, veins are transferred and integrated into the arterial circulation, where they exposed to high pressure and flow. These new hemodynamic conditions cause intimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis that cause intermediate and late vein graft failure. The idea of placing an external support on the vein graft was first suggested in 1963. The rational was that it will protect the vein from intimal damage and thrombosis by aiding with the adaptation of the vein toward the arterial environment. Method The external scaffold provides a mechanical support for the vein graft, absorbs the high arterial pressure, constrict the vein graft dilatation, reduces lumen irregularities and mitigates intimal hyperplasia formation. As shown both in human tissue cultures and experimental models. However, until recently there were a limited number of clinical studies that showed less positive results. It was hypothesized that graft patency rates were lower with external support, because of aggressive over constriction of the vein graft, unsuitable material of the devices and the use of fibrin glue that has shown to cause tissue damage, fibrosis and intimal hyperplasia. Lately, more promising results with second generation devices showed that external support can mitigate intimal hyperplasia development, improve vein graft lumen uniformity and improve the flow pattern inside the graft. These benefits shown to remain for up to five years follow up. In addition to improving the vein graft failure rates in bypass surgeries, other research studies showed that external support might allow the use of conduits that previously have been considered to be unsuitable for surgery. To date the technique is practiced in several cardiac centers in Europe, Israel and South Africa. Further clinical studies are ongoing in Europe and the US on a larger number of patients.

In France, it is mandatory to mention the amount of tobacco, cigarette paper and additives that are used to produce a cigarette on the pack, and the Che brand has 95% tobacco, 5% tobacco paper and 0% additives. Controversy In 2012, Polish conservative parliament member Stanisław Pięta of the Law and Justice party announced he would file a lawsuit against Landewyck Tobacco for selling Che cigarettes in Poland. He said the Che cigarettes were \\"propaganda which is spreading a totalitarian ideology\\" and that \\"Polish law prohibits the propaganda of totalitarian ideologies, whether that be Fascist or Communist\\". For Stanisław Pięta it is inadmissible to turn \\"Communist assassins into pop culture icons.\\" It would be something like \\"the marketing of tobacco packs with the effigies of Hermann Göring or Joseph Goebbels.\\", which were two of the main leaders of the Nazi Germany regime. Rona Pologne, the company responsible for the marketing of the brand in Poland, defended itself in a statement in which it claims that the brand was sold more than 20 years ago in several European countries, and that its distribution is governed by the laws in force in each country where it is present.

The bronze bust was sculpted by David G Mutasa and commissioned by the Friends of Fagon committee, chaired by Paul Stephenson, on the first anniversary of his death in 1987. The location was chosen because Fagon would often say \\"the heart of St. Paul’s is at the corner of Ashley Road and Grosvenor Road”. On 11th June 2020, during a period of protests by the Black Lives Matter movement, people reported to police that the bust was apparently coated with an unknown stubstance. This followed the tearing down of a statue of the merchant and slave trader Edward Colston during a protest on 7th June 2020. In 1996 the Alfred Fagon Award, an annual award for the best new play by a Black British playwright of Caribbean or African descent, resident in the United Kingdom, was founded to commemorate his life and work.

He went on to conduct pioneering research on profound hypothermia in cardiac surgery and what came to be known as the 'Drew technique'. Drew died from throat cancer at the age of 70 in 1987, leaving his wife Maureen and two children. Early life Born in Lambeth, 15 December 1916, as the eldest son of Edwin Frank Drew, an accountant, and Eunice (née Lloyd-Davies), Drew started his education in Stockwell. He then went on to Westminster City School, where, in 1938, he won the Bulkeley prize. During World War II, he became surgeon lieutenant RNVR in 1942, one year after he had graduated. A porthole provided an escape route when his ship was sunk in the Mediterranean and he was able to continue his duties thereafter. By the end of the war, Drew had been promoted to surgeon-commander. Surgical career Drew completed his junior surgical posts at Westminister hospital, where he also formed close associations with G T Mullalley and Sir Clement Price Thomas. He became surgical chief assistant at the Brompton Hospital and then consultant surgeon to the Westminster and St George's Hospitals.  King George VI lung operation  On 23 September 1951, he assisted Price Thomas, along with Peter Jones with the pneumonectomy on King George VI. On removal of the king's tumour, Drew and his colleague Jones, closed the chest. Later in his career, he performed the same operation on Price Thomas for the same disease.  The Drew technique  Drew was the first to use the technique of profound hypothermia in open heart surgery. The body temperature was lowered to such a point where cardiovascular arrest could just about be tolerated for the time necessary to carry out the heart operation. He continued to use this technique for the remaining 22 years of his surgical career. Drew was convinced that much of the high mortality in cardiac surgery was due to a problem with the oxygenator systems. He proved a technique, 'the Drew technique', which involved two concepts: to provide circulatory support without an artificial oxygenator, and to repair the heart under conditions of circulatory arrest. Converting an old billiard room on the 6th floor of Westminster hospital into a research laboratory, Drew observed \\"A small number of experiments was sufficient to show that, using simple apparatus, it is possible to induce profound hypothermia in a dog, followed by complete circulatory arrest for 30 minutes, and then to rewarm it with recovery.\\" This became the basis of his 'Drew technique' in following cardiac operations. Success was recorded in cardiac operations with arrest lasting up to 45 minutes. He emphasised that cold was cardio-protective. Respiratory complications, so often seen when oxygenators were used, were not noted with the Drew technique. His operating equipment is on display at the Science Museum, London.  Awards  Drew was invited to present the Hunterian lecture at the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1961. His presentation followed the framework of his research, 'Profound Hypothermia in Cardiac Surgery'.  Personal life  Drew enjoyed sailing and water polo. He was also interested in croquet and football and he rowed for University of London. He married Maureen Pittaway in 1950. She was a sister at Queen Alexandra Royal Naval Nursing Service. They had two children.  Later life  Later in life, Drew became a keen gardener and fisherman. In addition, he developed an interest in crosswords. Following retirement, Drew was diagnosed with pharyngeal cancer, which required surgery and radiation. The cancer recurred and he died at home on 31 May 1987.

He was a Member of Parliament, representing Bihar in the Rajya Sabha the upper house of India's Parliament as a member of the Indian National Congress.  Biography  Anand Chand was born on 26 January 1913 to Raja Bijai Chand (1873–1931), of the Rajput clan of Chandel, and Suraj Devi (1886–1939) in Bilaspur, an erstwhile princely state. He studied at the Mayo College in Ajmer, before heading to Delhi to engage in civil and judicial training that preceded him being invested with full ruling powers of Bilaspur, 9 January 1933. While the Raja, he abolished begar (heavy labour) in 1936, also passing a legislation abolishing child marriage. In 1942, he introduced the Bilaspur Prohibition Act. Schools, health centres, and roads linking Suket and Mandi to Delhi were constructed during his reign. In recognition of the role he played during World War II, Chand was awarded the George Cross, Victoria Cross and in 1945, the KCIE. Between 1947 and 1948, Chand became a member of the Constituent Assembly of India that was established to draft a constitution for India. In October 1948, he was appointed the chief commissioner of the hitherto Bilaspur Province of independent India, a position that he held until 1950, when it became a State, before merging with what is today the State of Himachal Pradesh. Chand was elected to the 1st Lok Sabha from Bilaspur. He was later elected to the Rajya Sabha, first from Himachal Pradesh (1958–1964) and then from Bihar (1965–1970). In 1976, Chand moved to London, England, with his family after government-given privileges and allowances to princely states were abolished in 1971. Chand was elected to the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly in 1977 and would travel to Bilaspur and Shimla during the legislature was in session. He remained a member until his term ended in 1982, a year in which he also suffered a stroke. He died on 12 October 1983 in London, and was cremated at the banks of the Sutlej River.

Hardly any members of this gens appear in history, but a number of them are mentioned in inscriptions. Origin The nomen Pontilius belongs to a class of gentilicia which were originally derived from cognomina ending in -ilus. However, such names were so common that the ending {not a typo-ilius}} came to be regarded as a regular gentile-forming suffix, and was applied in cases where there was no morphological justification. This may have been the case with Pontilius, which is probably derived from the Oscan praenomen Pompo or Pomptus, which also gave rise to several other nomina, including Pompilius, Pomponius, and Pontius. Pompo was the Oscan cognate of the Latin praenomen Quintus, and thus Pontilius was equivalent to Latin gentes such as Quinctia and Quinctilia.Chase, pp. 123, 127–129. Praenomina The chief praenomina of the Pontilii were Gaius, Marcus, Lucius, and Numerius. The first three were the most common praenomina throughout Roman history, while Numerius was mainly used by plebeian families, especially those of Oscan origin.

The grandson of Hendrik Verwoerd, known as the architect of the apartheid regime, Verwoerd has disavowed the views with which his family is widely associated and joined the ANC. Early Life and education Born in Pretoria to Wilhelm and Elise (née Smit) Verwoerd on 21 February 1964, Wilhelm is a member a prominent Afrikaner family. His grandfather was South African Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd. Although raised in a family and environment that frowned on racial integration, he changed his stance on apartheid after studying in Holland and at Oxford University. For more detail on this journey see Verwoerd (2019). He holds an MA in Philosophy from Stellenbosch University in 1989, an MA in PPE from the University of Oxford and a PhD in Applied Ethics from the University of Johannesburg. Academic career and later life Verwoerd's research focuses largely on reconciliation, forgiveness and apology, on which he has written several articles. He was a researcher in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. He worked as a programme co-ordinator and a co-facilitator in Ireland, within the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation's Survivors and former Combatants Programme between 2002 and 2011. He is a former co- director of Beyond Walls Ltd. From 2019 he is a senior researcher and facilitator within Studies in Historical Trauma and Transformation, Stellenbosch University. In 1992, Verwoerd formally joined the ANC, which drew a lot of criticism and threats from militant Afrikaners - given his family roots. This brought strife with his own family. Despite a strong Christian upbringing and a family who taught him to follow Christ, Wilhelm has left orthodox Christianity to practise a form of New Age Spiritualism. Neither his children nor his former wife is a Christian. Personal life Verwoerd married the radical feminist, anti-Christian Melanie Fourie in 1987, with whom he had two children, Wilmé (born 1990) and Wian (born 1992). They divorced in 2005. Melanie went on to live with her lover Gerry Ryan out of wedlock until he died due to cocaine and alcohol use. She has publicly renounced her Christian faith. Wilhelm is currently married to Sharon, an Australian woman who is a high school teacher and peace practitioner. Select publications Books *Wilhelm Verwoerd (1996).

He choreographed for Puerto Rican Dance Theater and the Des Moines Ballet in Iowa. In 1981 he choreographed a PBS production of Romeo and Juliet, in which he played the role of Mercutio. His company was called the Samaniego Dance Gallery, established in 1977. Dance Magazine reports: \\"His annual stagings of A Christmas Carol, Peter and the Wolf, and The Nutcracker were holiday favorites in southern California.\\" Early life Jorge Samaniego was born in 1947 in Cuba. He studied at Los Angeles’s American School of Dance before moving to New York, where he performed with the New York Metropolitan Opera Ballet. Career The Des Moines Ballet was founded in 1966 with the express purpose of providing training and performance opportunities for young dancers in the area. In 1978, the Board of Directors directed their attention towards a more professional presentation and retained Jorge Samaniego as Artistic Director and Kenneth MacDonald (December 31, 1948 - April 20, 1995) as Associate Artistic Director. Samaniego had been the ballet master and choreographed for the Milwaukee Ballet. The size of the performing body was reduced and one year after the change in artistic direction, the Association elected to support professional dancers on a seasonal contract. The dancers included Samaniego and MacDonald plus six additional young performers. Three were from Des Moines and three were from other parts of the country. In addition to these performers, the company included lighting and set designer Wayne Mikos, costume designer Donette Yeaton, and business manager, Kay McElrath. Samaniego's task had been to take the company to a higher level of professional development. His background as a performer with the New York City Opera Ballet, the Netherlands Dance Ballet Theater, and the Milwaukee Lar Lubovitch Dance Company provided the necessary professional experience to facilitate this task. In addition, he choreographed for Milwaukee and Princeton ballets and for the Puerto Rican dance theater. MacDonald complemented Samaniego's efforts with his own training with American Concert Ballet, Lottie Gosslar, and the Milwaukee Ballet. Jorge Samaniego chose to create his own works for the company to perform. The titles of his works Isolations, Tocata and Fugue, Rhapsody in Blue, Adam and Eve ... A Rib, and The Times They Are A-Dancing, suggested a range of ballets that include pure movement works, comic and whimsical dances, and those which probe the conflicting forces of modern life. Samaniego's choreography exhibited sufficient variety and artistic depth to satisfy the dancers and their growing audiences. Samaniego moved back to Los Angeles in 1984 and reestablished his Dance Gallery, which performed regularly at the Assistance League Playhouse. Personal life Jorge Samaniego died on August 12, 1987. Both Dance Magazine and the Los Angeles Times obituaries list Samaniego's companion, Kenneth MacDonald, as a survivor. MacDonald grew up in San Mateo County and met Samaniego at a ballet studio in Los Angeles in the early 1970s. They were together for 14 years. On the AIDS quilt MacDonald did for Samaniego, he wrote: \\"To Jorge Samaniego, my tears, my love, Kenneth.\\" Kenneth MacDonald died of AIDS on April 20, 1995.

It was once the residence of the counts of Palatinate-Veldenz, who lived for four generations that lasted for 151. The schloss is at Veldenzplatz 1. Since 2017 it has been converted and renovated internally in order to become a new 'jewel' for the town of Lauterecken.  History  A Lauterecken Castle was built in the Middle Ages within the Verdun estate of Medard. Gerlach I (1112-1146), a descendant of the counts of Nahe, founded the County of Veldenz (named after the town on the Moselle). The blue Veldenz lion in the coat of arms of Lauterecken still recalls this family. The castle with its characteristic Veldenz tower was first mentioned in 1343. Around 1349, Veldenz received town rights. In 1444, the Wittelsbach count palatine, Stephen of Palatinate-Simmern-Zweibrücken (1385-1459) took over the territory by marriage with Anna (around 1390-1439), the daughter of the last count of Veldenz, and formed the County Palatine of Zweibrücken. Rupert (1506-1544), brother of Count Palatine Louis II of Zweibrücken, took over the guardianship of the underage prince Wolfgang (1526-1569) on Louis's death. Later, out of gratitude, he gave him his own county palatine, which initially consisted of the Ämter (districts) of Veldenz and Lauterecken, the Jettenbach jurisdiction and Remigsberg House (Treaty of Marburg). As founder of the Palatinate-Veldenz line, Rupert Lauterecken raised Lauterecken to the status of a residence town and had a representative schloss built. His son, the \\"astute\\" and visionary George Hans (1543-1592), married the Swedish princess Anna Maria from the House of Wasa. He extended the county to include areas of Electoral Palatinate, and later moved his residence to the Alsatian town of Lützelstein (La Petite-Pierre) and founded Pfalzburg. He was followed by his son George Gustavus (1564-1634, cousin of Gustavus Adolphus) and his son Leopold Louis (1625-1694), until the Protestant dynasty of the Palatinate-V Lauterecken finally came into existence in 1733 after many years of disputeKurpfalz. In the later Bavarian period, when Zweibrücken's house was under on the Bavarian throne, the Veldenz lion was absorbed into the Bavarian coat of arms. The bones of 15 members of the House of Palatinate-Veldenz rest in the Provost's Church on the nearby Remigiusberg.

Formed by musicians, the group aimed to use their creative talents to create a bustling musical network in Bristol.  History  Al Read and Terry Brace were school friends who had experience playing music (Read guitar and Brace bass). Al had organised Skiffle nights at the Beeches club in Filton, Bristol in the late 50s. In 1966 When Read joined a band called the Franklyn Big Six, he sent a letter to Brace inviting him to join the band. They soon left this band to join Picture of Dorian Gray, which became renamed East Of Eden. Geoff Nicholson soon joined East of Eden and Ed Newshom, the roadie from Nicholson's last band The Kingbees followed. This line-up of East of Eden released a single called King Of Siam in 1968. East of Eden hired the Dugout club. In a newspaper advertisement for this club night their saxophonist Ron Caines suggested \\"if it's raining, don't forget your plastic dog coats\\", which inspired their title. Al and Terry left East of Eden but continued the club nights, choosing to promote local bands. Here they linked up with Mike Tobin. He had been involved with Read's skiffle nights as a performer in the late 50s and they had stayed in touch ever since. When he joined the Plastic Dog collective had become a loose collective of creative people. Around this time Newshom had stopped being East of Eden's roadie and joined Plastic Dog too. Tobin approached the Granary Jazz club to find a bigger venue for the Plastic Dog nights and they started organising gigs on Monday nights. Now Plastic Dog had an entertainments agency licence, developed a graphics studio and set up offices at 77 Park Street. Plastic Dog became full time promoters of rock music at the Granary and other venues. In 1971 Plastic Dog invested a lot of money into organising the “Midsummer Merrymaking\\" festival at Pleasure Acre, Portbury, Portishead scheduled for July 30. Communication with the local council resulted in a late switch of venues, the company lacked the time or funding to promote this change and on top of this bad weather made the festival unworkable. Plastic Dog struggled to recover from the resulting loss of funds and the company began to fragment. Comedian Jasper Carrot expressed an interest in signing with Plastic Dog Agency at a meeting on May 30 1974. Early in 1977 Plastic Dog (Park Street Associates) was sold to Derek Barker and Adrian Squires at Rainbow Entertainments who were based at Queen Square, Bristol. Read moved his office to The Granary club and focused on booking bands and radio presentation.  Legacy  The agency published a fanzine called Dogpress which ran for 35 monthly issues until December 1971. Throughout its run it had incorporated the talents of many famous contributors including illustrator Rodney Matthews. The team that ran this publication became Plastic Dog Graphics, a sister company to the Plastic Dog Agency. When they split from Plastic Dog following their financial problems in 1971 Plastic Dog Graphics became Skyline Studios. They had an office on Park Row in Bristol, designing album covers, posters and badges until they dissolved in 1976. Throughout the Punk movement and then the NWOBHM the Granary remained a successful venue as like Plastic Dog the acts were booked by music fans for music fans. On the 6th of April 1982 Al Read left the Granary following an incident with drug dealers, focusing instead on radio. The surviving members of Plastic Dog still organise events in Bristol.

Management career First stint with Everton The first position Spence held with Everton was a stint as director of the Everton Centre of Excellence, which is an academy program tasked with training girls between the ages of Under-9s through Under-17s. By 2004, Spence began his Everton managing career as an assistant to Mo Marley. During his time as an assistant, Spence helped the club win the 2008 League Cup and the 2010 FA Cup. On 14 November 2012 Marley stepped down at the end of the last campaign, naming Spence as the new first team manager. After three seasons with the Blues, Spence stepped down, citing the club's need to move forward after being relegated at the conclusion of the 2014 season after 21 seasons in the top flight and struggling form in the FA WSL 2. He would be succeeded by Nicola Anderson and retake his position at the club's Centre of Excellence. Return as Everton manager After six months, Spence was re-appointed manager of Everton L.F.C.. Spence would lead Everton to back-to-back third place WSL 2 finishes. In 2017, the FA WSL ran an interim season to re-align the season calendars between February and May called the FA WSL Spring Series. This interim season would not compete for promotion or relegation ahead of the 2017-18 season. Under Spence, Everton won the Spring Series with 7 wins from 9 matches. Prior to the 2017-18 season, Notts County of the WSL 1 folded prior to the Spring Series prompting the FA to invite FA WSL 2 clubs to apply and fill the vacancy. Spence's Everton was awarded the invitation back into the top flight on 9 June 2017, and would compete in the WSL 1 for the 2017-18 season. After going winless through six matches in the FA WSL to open the 2018-19 campaign, Spence \\"left his role\\" as manager with Jennifer Herst being appointed interim manager.

Market  Natilus targets an existing $100 billion per year Trans- Pacific airfreight market, growing due to e-commerce and as 30% of US companies sales are international. In 2015 it planned to initially operate a fleet of up to five cargo planes with one partner per route and offering the cargo insurance for the first year, saving operational costs for freight forwarders and increasing the profit margin by 20%. Natilus hopes to build hundreds of the drones, to operate itself under its customer brands or to sell them directly to customers like UPS and FedEx or “medium freight forwarders” like Whole Foods and Costco. It would cost about one-tenth of a crewed freight aircraft, and transoceanic trips would cost about half as much as standard air freight. Natilus hopes to balance speed with cost, shipping time-sensitive freight that isn’t valuable enough to fly, but is more valuable than much of what sails, like perishable food, basic electronic components, vehicles, pharmaceuticals. Bulkier and cheaper goods like crude oil or clothing would still travel slowly but cheaply by sea and high-end goods like sushi-grade fish or luxury cars would still fly faster for more money. Freight is a $15.5 trillion market worldwide.  Aircraft  Natilus concept The craft would carry in freight containers and unit load devices. It would be towed from a sea ports outside of territorial waters, mostly at from shorelines, to takeoff within in a sea state swell up to . It would fly across the Pacific ocean in 30 hours at , well below passenger air traffic and would be towed to a sea port after landing. Made of carbon fibre and fibreglass composites, its production cost is estimated at $25 million, much lower than jetliners due to fewer onboard systems and no pilots, it would be powered by jet engines developed by Pratt & Whitney. The 2020 carbon-fiber full-scale long turboprop drone design is simple without a cockpit, landing gear, or pressurization and would taxi into port remotely controlled at about . Landing gear room is leaved for future use in the wide large drone. Natilus aims to ship from Los Angeles to Shanghai in 30h for $130,000 at $3 per gallon of jet fuel, while a Boeing 747 takes 11h for $260,000 and a cargo ship takes 504 hours for $61,000  Development  A wingspan scale model will test the autopilot and water take-off and landing. In July 2015, it was targeted to fly within 18 months before a full scale aircraft three years later. Natilus raised $750,000 of venture capital from Tim Draper and was incubated at the aviation-oriented Starburst Accelerator in Los Angeles. Natilus hopes to fly its prototype, comparable in size and weight with a Predator drone, between Los Angeles and Hawaii on 30-hour test runs, carrying up to of cargo. The over full-scale drone would be finished by 2020 to be flight tested and certified before commercial flights. A launch customer wants an long cargo with a capacity for 2019, to fly the Los Angeles to Hawaii route, before a long craft with a capacity would fly between the U.S. and China by 2020. About 70% complete in May 2017, the prototype seaplane will lack a landing gear, its maximum gross weight is , its wingspan is and it will cruise at . In August 2017, smaller cargo-drones were envisioned, with large cargo doors and designed for a dimensional weight. In November 2017, Natilus closed a second round of seed funding from Starburst Ventures, Seraph Group, Gelt VC, Outpost Capital and Draper Associates. Using existing turbofan and turboprop engines, a drone with a retractable landing gear would carry over between local regional airports; the payload craft would weight for trans-Pacific routes. The 2-tonne payload freighter would have a blended wing body configuration. In December 2017, water-taxiing of the wide prototype was going to be tested in San Francisco Bay, before flight testing in 2018 and the capable freighter by 2020. In February 2018, the , -span prototype was being prepared for flight from San Pablo Bay, north of San Francisco, powered by a single Rotax 912 piston. The next aircraft will be a blended wing body (BWB) landplane, providing 30% more volume. The first product will be a small regional freighter powered by a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A with a cargo capacity and a MTOW, to fly in 2020 and to be certified under the FAR Part 23 within 3.5 years from February 2018.

History The street was laid out by Henry Moses Wood, Surveyor in 1828. The opportunity offered by the construction of this new road was taken to install a large culvert in circumference as a storm drain, to carry water to the River Leen. The River Leen was dredged by approximately to provide additional capacity. In 1842 a bridge was constructed over the Nottingham and Beeston Canal to provide access to Nottingham Carrington Street railway station. The bridge costing £6,000 () was partly sponsored by the Midland Counties' Railway. It contained an inscription which read: > This bridge was commenced in August, 1841, J.M.B. Pigot M.D., Mayor, and > completed in October, 1842, R. Morley Esq., Mayor, H.M. Wood, Architect. The bridge was widened in 1904 when the new Nottingham station was erected. Having crossed the canal, the street arrived at Nottingham Carrington Street railway station. In 1846 the Derby to Nottingham railway line was extended to Lincoln and this necessitated a level crossing over Carrington Street. A wooden footbridge was provided to alleviate delays. This remained in use until the construction of a viaduct over the railway in 1867-68 at a cost of £35,000 () designed by Marriott Ogle Tarbotton. In 1878 the Nottingham and District Tramways Company Limited opened a horse drawn tramway service between Trent Bridge and St Peter's Church. This was electrified in 1901 and tramway services continued provided by Nottingham Corporation Tramways until withdrawn in 1936.

The Fate of the Apostles: Examining the Martyrdom Accounts of the Closest Followers of Jesus. Routledge; 9 March 2016. ISBN 978-1-317-03190-1. p. 185. Descriptions in antiquity of the execution cross, whether by Christians or non-Christians, present the instrument ordinarily used in putting people to death by crucifixion as composed of two wooden pieces. Whether the two pieces of timber of the normal execution cross were permanently conjoined or were merely put together for the purpose of the execution is not stated. Atypical executions on cross-like structures also took place, \\"especially when the executioners decide[d] to engage in cruel creativity\\", as indicated by Seneca the Younger.The Trial and Crucifixion of Jesus: Texts and Commentary.

Terminology  Justus Lipsius on this page distinguishes two types of crux simplex A distinction is commonly made between a single-pole or single-stake crux simplex and a crux compacta composed of more than one piece of timber. This terminology was invented by Justus Lipsius (1547–1606) and so was not used by the Early Christians or their contemporaries.Gunnar Samuelsson, Crucifixion in Antiquity (Mohr Siebeck 2013), pp. 3–4 e 295 Justus Lipsius: Crux simplex ad infixionem Lipsius distinguished two types of the transom-less crux simplex: the crux simplex ad affixionem to which the victim was attached and left to die, and the crux simplex ad infixionem with which to impale him. Similarly, he distinguished three types of crux compacta: crux decussata (X-shaped), crux commissa (T-shaped) and crux immissa (†-shaped). Some scholars think the distinction between crux commissa and crux immissa within the crux compacta category is unnecessary. Hermann Fulda called it a meaningless distinction that Lipsius grabbed out of thin air. Others too, including Gerald G. O'Collins, do not accept all the proposed subcategories of crux compacta. Seneca the Younger (c. 4 BC – AD 65) records the use in the first century AD of the crux compacta with transom (patibulum) and of the crux simplex ad infixionem (impalement), but does not mention the transom-less crux simplex ad affixionem; he seems to indicate that execution on a cross tended to follow a fairly common routine, while still being open to significant variations. Departure from normal crucifixion routine is also mentioned by Josephus (37 – c. 100) in his The Jewish War: \\"The soldiers, out of the wrath and hatred they bore the Jews, nailed those they caught, one after one way, and another after another, to the crosses, by way of jest, when their multitude was so great, that room was wanting for the crosses, and crosses wanting for the bodies\\".Flavius Josephus, The Wars of the Jews 5:451  Made of more than one piece  Irenaeus (early 2nd century – AD 202) remarks that \\"the very form of the cross, too, has five extremities, two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which [last] the person rests who is fixed by the nails\\".Irenaeus, Against Heresies, II, xxiv, 4Latin text: \\"Ipse habitus crucis, fines et summitates habet quinque, duos in longitudine, duos in latitudine, et unum in medio, in quo requiescit qui clavis affigitur\\" (Adversus haereses, liber II, cap. XXIV, 4). The same remark is made by Justin Martyr (100–165) when commenting on the Book of Deuteronomy 33:17: \\"No one could say or prove that the horns of a unicorn represent any other fact or figure than the type which portrays the cross. For the one beam is placed upright, from which the highest extremity is raised up into a horn, when the other beam is fitted on to it, and the ends appear on both sides as horns joined on to the one horn. And the part which is fixed in the centre, on which are suspended those who are crucified, also stands out like a horn; and it also looks like a horn conjoined and fixed with the other horns\\".Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho, XCIOriginal text: κέρατα οὐδενὸς ἄλλου πράγματος ἢ σχήματος ἔχοι ἄν τις εἰπεῖν καὶ ἀποδεῖξαι, εἰ μὴ τοῦ τύπου ὃς τὸν σταυρὸν δείκνυσιν. ὄρθιον γὰρ τὸ ἕν ἐστι ξύλον, ἀφ' οὗ ἐστι τὸ ἀνώτατον μέρος εἰς κέρας ὑπερηρμένον, ὅταν τὸ ἄλλο ξύλον προσαρμοσθῇ, καὶ ἑκατέρωθεν ὡς κέρατα τῷ ἑνὶ κέρατι παρεζευγμένα τὰ ἄκρα φαίνηται· καὶ τὸ ἐν τῷ μέσῳ πηγνύμενον ὡς κέρας καὶ αὐτὸ ἐξέχον ἐστίν, ἐφ' ᾧ ἐποχοῦνται οἱ σταυρούμενοι, καὶ βλέπεται ὡς κέρας καὶ αὐτὸ σὺν τοῖς ἄλλοις κέρασι συνεσχηματισμένον καὶ πεπηγμένον (Τοῦ ἁγίου Ἰουστίνου πρὸς Τρύφωνα Ἰουδαῖον Διάλογος, XCI, 2). To the pagan jibe about Christians being devotees of the cross, Tertullian (c. 155 – c. 240) responds by saying the pagans no less adored images of wood, with the difference that they worship what is only part of a cross, while the Christians are credited with \\"an entire cross complete with a transverse beam and a projecting seat\\". He then adds that \\"the very structure of our body suggests the essential and primal outline of a cross. The head ascends to the peak, the spine stands upright, the shoulders traverse the spine. If you position a man with his arms outstretched, you shall have created the image of a cross.\\"Tertullian, Ad nationes, book I, chapter XXThe original text is: \\"Sed et qui crucis nos antistites affirmat, consacerdos erit noster. Crucis qualitas signum est de ligno: etiam de materia colitis penes uos cum effigie. Quamquam sicut uestrum humana figura est, ita et nostrum sua propria. Viderint nunc liniamenta, dum una sit qualitas; uiderit forma, dum ipsum sit dei corpus. Quodsi de hoc differentia intercedit, quanto distinguitur a crucis stipite Pallas Attica et Ceres Pharia, quae sine forma rudi palo et solo staticulo ligni informis repraesentatur? Pars crucis, et quidem maior, est omne robur quod derecta statione defigitur. Sed nobis tota crux imputatur, cum antemna scilicet sua et cum illo sedilis excessu. [...] ipsi quoque corpori nostro tacita et secreta linea crucis situs est, quod caput emicat, quod spina dirigitur, quod umerorum obliquatio; si statueris hominem manibus expansis, imaginem crucis feceris\\" (Tertullian, Ad nationes, I, xii). Justin Martyr also states: \\"That [passover] lamb which was commanded to be wholly roasted was a symbol of the suffering of the cross which Christ would undergo. For the lamb, which is roasted, is roasted and dressed up in the form of the cross. For one spit is transfixed right through from the lower parts up to the head, and one across the back, to which are attached the legs of the lamb.\\"Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho, XL, 3Original text: καὶ τὸ κελευσθὲν πρόβατον ἐκεῖνο ὀπτὸν ὅλον γίνεσθαι τοῦ πάθους τοῦ σταυροῦ, δι' οὗ πάσχειν ἔμελλεν ὁ Χριστός, σύμβολον ἦν. τὸ γὰρ ὀπτώμενον πρόβατον σχηματιζόμενον ὁμοίως τῷ σχήματι τοῦ σταυροῦ ὀπτᾶται· εἷς γὰρ ὄρθιος ὀβελίσκος διαπερονᾶται ἀπὸ τῶν κατωτάτων μερῶν μέχρι τῆς κεφαλῆς, καὶ εἷς πάλιν κατὰ τὸ μετάφρενον, ᾧ προσαρτῶνται καὶ αἱ χεῖρες τοῦ προβάτου (Τοῦ ἁγίου Ἰουστίνου πρὸς Τρύφωνα Ἰουδαῖον Διάλογος, XL, 3). The Acts of Peter, of the second half of the second century, expressly distinguishes between the upright beam of the cross and its crossbeam: in this early example of New Testament Apocrypha, Saint Peter, on being crucified, says: \\"It is right to mount upon the cross of Christ, who is the word stretched out, the one and only, of whom the spirit saith: For what else is Christ, but the word, the sound of God So that the word is the upright beam whereon I am crucified. And the sound is that which crosseth it, the nature of man. And the nail which holdeth the cross-tree unto the upright in the midst thereof is the conversion and repentance of man.\\"Acts of Peter, XXXVIIIOriginal text: προσῆκεν γὰρ ἐπιβαίνειν τῷ τοῦ Χριστοῦ σταυρῷ, ὅστις ἐστὶν ὁ τεταμένος λόγος, εἷς καὶ μόνος. περὶ οὗ τὸ πνεῦμα λέγει· Τί γάρ ἐστιν Χριστὸς ἀλλ' ὁ λόγος, ἦχος τοῦ θεοῦ; ἵνα λόγος ᾖ τοῦτο τὸ ὀρθὸν ξύλον, ἐφ' ᾧ ἐσταύρωμαι· ἦχος δὲ τὸ πλάγιόν ἐστιν, ἀνθρώπου φύσις· ὁ δὲ ἧλος ὁ συνέχων ἐπὶ τῷ ὀρθῷ ξύλῳ τὸ πλάγιον κατὰ μέσου, ἡ ἐπιστροφὴ καὶ ἡ μετάνοια τοῦ ἀνθρώπου (Constantinus Tischendorf, Ricardus Adalbertus Lipsius, Maximilianus Bonnet, Acta Apostolorum Apocrypha (Leipzig 1891), p. 96). These statements by Early Christians echo those of contemporary non-Christians. Second-century Artemidorus indicated that the execution cross was made from more than one piece of wood, when he said it was good luck for someone about to undertake a sea voyage to dream of being crucified, because \\"a cross is made from posts and nails like a ship, and its mast is like a cross\\".John Granger Cook, Crucifixion in the Mediterranean World (Mohr Siebeck 2014), pp. 7–8Original text: σταυροῦσθαι πᾶσι μὲν τοῖς ναυτίλλεσθαι προῃρημένοις ἀγαθόν; καὶ γὰρ ἐκ ξύλων καὶ ἥλων τὸ πλοῖον καὶ ἡ καταρτιὰ αὐτοῦ ὁμοία ἐστὶ σταυρῷ (Artemidorus, Oneirocritica, 1.76 (Siegfried Lebrecht Crusius, Leipzig 1805), p. 234). Thus Artemidorus explicitly says that an execution cross is made from more than one wooden beam and from nails (ἐκ ξύλων καὶ ἥλων).John Granger Cook, Crucifixion in the Mediterranean World (Mohr Siebeck 2014), p. 32 Dionysius of Halicarnassus (c. 60 BC – after 7 BC) mentions that, on a certain occasion, \\"a Roman citizen of no obscure station, having ordered one of his slaves to be put to death, delivered him to his fellow-slaves to be led away, and in order that his punishment might be witnessed by all, directed them to drag him through the Forum and every other conspicuous part of the city as they whipped him, and that he should go ahead of the procession which the Romans were at that time conducting in honour of the god. The men ordered to lead the slave to his punishment, having stretched out both his arms and fastened them to a piece of wood which extended across his breast and shoulders as far as his wrists, followed him, tearing his naked body with whips. The culprit, overcome by such cruelty, not only uttered ill-omened cries, forced from him by the pain, but also made indecent movements under the blows. This man, accordingly, they all thought to be the unacceptable dancer signified by the god.\\"Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, VII, 69Original text: Dionysii Halicarnassei scripta quae exstant, omnia, et historica, et rhetorica (Frankfurt 1586), pp. 473–474 Dionysius does not specify the form of execution to which the slave was being led nor whether the piece of wood he carried on his shoulders was for the transom of an execution cross, but some scholars have interpreted it in that way.  For outstretched arms of victim  Justus Lipsius, Praying with outspread hands Noah in prayer posture, a fresco in the catacombs of Rome The Early Christians interpreted their practice of praying with arms outstretched as a representation of the form of Christ's cross. Judith Couchman, The Mystery of the Cross: Bringing Ancient Christian Images to Life (InterVarsity Press 2010), p. 85 Tertullian saw this prayer posture reflected in nature: \\"The birds now arising are lifting themselves up to heaven and instead of hands are spreading out the cross of their wings, while saying something which may be supposed to be a prayer\\" (et aves nunc exsurgentes eriguntur ad caelum, et alarum crucem pro manibus expandunt et dicunt aliquid quod oratio videatur). Of the Christians he said that they not only lift up their hands in prayer, \\"but also spread them out, and, modulating them by the Lord's passion, in our prayers also express our faith in Christ\\" (nos vero non attollimus tantum sed etiam expandimus, et dominica passione modulantes, et orantes confitemur Christo).Tertullian On PrayerQuinti Florentis Tertulliani De OrationeErnest Evans, Tertullian's Tract on Prayer (Wipf and Stock, 2016) According to Naphthali Wieder, it was because Christians interpreted prayer with outspread hands as referring to the crucifixion of their Messiah that Jews abandoned this prayer posture, which had previously been Jewish tradition.Uri Ehrlich, The Nonverbal Language of Prayer: A New Approach to Jewish Liturgy (Mohr Siebeck 2004), p. 117 Justin Martyr interpreted as foreshadowing the shape of the execution cross the episode in the Book of Exodus 17:8-13. The text says that Moses \\"raised\\" (ירים, ἐπῆρεν in the Greek Septuagint translation) his hands, without specifying in what way they were raised; but Justin uses a more specific expression to describe the posture of Moses, saying that he \\"spread out his hands on both sides\\" (τὰς χεῖρας ἑκατέρως ἐκπετάσας). He added that, when Moses relaxed some element of \\"this posture imitating the cross\\" (τοῦ σχήματος τούτου τοῦ τὸν σταυρὸν μιμουμένου), the people were defeated, but when Moses maintained it, the people prevailed \\"on account of the cross\\" (διὰ τοῦ σταυροῦ); he attributed this effect not to the prayer of Moses but to the fact that Moses \\"was forming the sign of the cross\\" (τὸ σημεῖον τοῦ σταυροῦ ἐποίει).Τοῦ ἁγίου Ἰουστίνου πρὸς Τρύφωνα Ἰουδαῖον Διάλογος, XC The same Old Testament event is interpreted in a similar way in the earlier Epistle of Barnabas, which saw as one of the prophetic signs of \\"the cross and him who was to be crucified on it\\" (περὶ τοῦ σταυροῦ καὶ τοῦ σταυροῦσθαι μέλλοντος) in what Moses did when he, \\"standing higher than all, stretched out his hands, and so again Israel conquered; then, when he let them down, they were again slaughtered\\". It says that in this Moses was inspired to \\"make the form of a cross, and of him who was about to suffer\\" (ἵνα ποιήσῃ τύπον σταυροῦ καὶ τοῦ μέλλοντος πάσχειν).Epistle of Barnabas, XII, 2An English translation Hercules freeing Prometheus, relief from the Temple of Aphrodite at Aphrodisias, built and remodelled between 30 BC and AD 130Temple of AphroditeAphrodisias Justin Martyr said the cross's shape is found in things that have a transverse as well as an upright element: \\"The sea is not traversed except that trophy which is called a sail abide safe in the ship; and the earth is not ploughed without it: diggers and mechanics do not their work, except with tools which have this shape. And the human form differs from that of the irrational animals in nothing else than in its being erect and having the hands extended, and having on the face extending from the forehead what is called the nose, through which there is respiration for the living creature; and this shows no other form than that of the cross\\".Justin Martyr, First Apology, LV, 3–4Original text: θάλασσα μὲν γὰρ οὐ τέμνεται, ἢν μὴ τοῦτο τὸ τρόπαιον, ὃ καλεῖται ἰστίον, ἐν τῇ νηῒ σῶον μείνῃ. γῆ δὲ οὐκ ἀροῦται ἄνευ αὐτοῦ· σκαπανεῖς δὲ τὴν ἐργασίαν οὐ ποιοῦνται, oὐδὲ βανασουργοὶ ὁμοίως εἰ μὴ διὰ τῶν τὸ σχῆμα τοῦτο ἐχόντων ἐργαλείων. Τὸ δὲ ἀνθρώπινον σχῆμα οὐδενὶ ἄλλῳ τῶν ἀλόγων ζώων διαφέρει, ἢ τῷ ὀρθόν τε εἶναι, καὶ ἔκτασιν τῶν χειρῶν, καὶ ἐν τῷ προσώπῳ ἀπὸ τοῦ μετωπίου τεταγμένον τὸν λεγόμενον μυξωτῆρα φέρειν, δι' οὗ ἥ τε ἀναπνοή ἐστι τῷ ζώῳ, κσὶ οὐδὲν ἄλλο δείκνυσιν ἢ το σχῆμα τοῦ σταυροῦ (PG 6:412). Drawing by Justus Lipsius illustrating Minucius Felix's words: \\"the ship when it is carried along with swelling sails, when it glides forward with expanded oars\\" Later than Justin, Marcus Minucius Felix in his Octavius states: \\"We assuredly see the sign of a cross, naturally, in the ship when it is carried along with swelling sails, when it glides forward with expanded oars; and when the military yoke is lifted up, it is the sign of a cross; and when a man adores God with a pure mind, with hands outstretched.\\".Octavius, XXIXOriginal text: Octavius, cap. 29,7 Scholars dispute whether this work is earlier or later than Tertullian's Apologeticus, which is generally assigned to the year 197. Lucian (125 – after 180) describes the situation of Prometheus chained to the Caucasus as a crucifixion with arms stretched out to right and left: \\"Let him hang over this precipice, with his arms stretched across from crag to crag [...] altogether a sweet spot for a crucifixion\\" (Fowler translation);Delphi Complete Works of Lucian (Delphi Classics 2016) in the original, ἀνεσταυρώσθω (let him be crucified) ἐκπετασθεὶς τὼ χεῖρε ἀπὸ τουτουὶ τοῦ κρημνοῦ πρὸς τὸν ἐναντίον [...] ἐπικαιρότατος ἂν ὁ σταυρὸς γένοιτο.Lucian, Prometheus and Artemidorus said it was an ill omen to dream of dancing on a height, because both the height and the stretching out of the hands presage his crucifixion as a criminal.Artemidorus, Oneirocritica, 1.76 (Siegfried Lebrecht Crusius, Leipzig 1805, p. 106): Εἰ δέ τις ὑψηλὸς ἐπί τινος ὀρχοῖτο εἰς φὀβον καὶ δἐος πεσεῖται· κακοῦργος δὲ ὢν σταυρωθήσεται διὰ τὸ ὕψος καὶ τὴν τῶν χειρῶν ἔκτασιν.John Granger Cook, Crucifixion in the Mediterranean World (Mohr Siebeck 2014), p. 289  Shaped like the letter T  The Epistle of Barnabas, written at a date estimated as between 80 and 120Early Christian Writing or at latest 130, gives an allegorical interpretation of the number 318 (in Greek numerals τιη’) in the text of Book of Genesis 14:14 as intimating the crucifixion of Jesus by viewing the numerals ιη’ (18) as the initial letters of Ἰησοῦς, Iēsus, and the numeral τ’ (300) as a prefiguration of the cross: \\"What, then, was the knowledge given to him in this? Learn the eighteen first, and then the three hundred. The ten and the eight are thus denoted—Ten by Ι, and Eight by H. You have [the initials of the name of] Jesus. And because the cross was to express the grace [of our redemption] by the letter Τ, he says also, 'Three Hundred'. He signifies, therefore, Jesus by two letters, and the cross by one.\\"The Epistle of Barnabas, IX (τίς οὖν ἡ δοθεῖσα αὐτῷ γνῶσις; μάθετε, ὅτι τοὺς δεκαοκτὼ πρώτους, καὶ διάστημα ποιήσας λέγει τριακοσίους. τὸ δεκαοκτὼ ι’ δέκα, η’ ὀκτώ· ἔχεις Ἰησοῦν. ὅτι δὲ ὁ σταυρὸς ἐν τῷ ταῦ ἤμελλεν ἔχειν τὴν χάριν, λέγει καὶ τοὺς τριακοσίους. δηλοῖ οὖν τὸν μὲν Ἰησοῦν ἐν τοῖς δυσὶν γράμμασιν, καὶ ἐν τῷ ἑνὶ τὸν σταυρόν).Original text, Βαρνάβα ἐπιστολή, IX, 8 This allegorical interpretation, reading the writer's familiarity with the execution crosses and the numeral system of his time back into the situation of centuries earlier, evidently very different from modern Biblical criticism, is considered to be a classic example of midrashic interpretation of Scripture then in use among Jews and Early Christians.William W. Klein, Craig L. Blomberg, Robert L. Hubbard, Jr., Introduction to Biblical Interpretation (Zondervan 2017) Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 – c. 215) gives the same interpretation of the number τιη’ (318), referring to the cross of Christ with the expression \\"the Lord's sign\\": \\"They say, then, that the character representing 300 is, as to shape, the type of the Lord’s sign, and that the Iota and the Eta indicate the Saviour’s name\\" (φασὶν οὖν εἶναι τοῦ μὲν κυριακοῦ σημείου τύπον κατὰ τὸ σχῆμα τὸ τριακοσιοστὸν στοιχεῖον, τὸ δὲ ἰῶτα καὶ τὸ ἦτα τοὔνομα σημαίνειν τὸ σωτήριον). In the same chapter of his book, and again on the basis of the shape of the letter τ, Clement says the 300-cubit length of Noah's ark was seen as a foreshadowing of the cross of Christ: \\"there are some who say that three hundred cubits are the symbol of the Lord’s sign\\" (εἰσὶ δ' οἳ τοὺς τριακοσίους πήχεις σύμβολον τοῦ κυριακοῦ σημείου λέγουσι).Clement of Alexandria, The Stromata, book VI, chapter 11Stromateis VI, 11 (original text) William Barclay notes that, because the letter T is shaped exactly like the crux commissa and because the Greek letter T represented the number 300, \\"wherever the fathers came across the number 300 in the Old Testament they took it to be a mystical prefiguring of the cross of Christ\\".William Barclay, The Apostles' Creed (Westminster John Knox Press, 1998), p. 79 Tertullian (c. 155 – c. 240), writing in Latin, remarks that the Greek letter τ and the Latin letter T have the same shape as the execution cross: \\"Ipsa est enim littera Graecorum Tau, nostra autem T, species crucis\\".Adversus Marcionem, liber III, cap. XXII Non-Christians too of the time when in the Roman Empire criminals were executed by crucifixion, considered identical the shape of the execution cross (σταυρός in Greek) and that of the letter tau. In the Trial of the Court of the Vowels of Lucian (125 – after 180), the Greek letter Sigma (Σ) accuses the letter Tau (Τ) of having provided tyrants with the model for the wooden instrument with which to crucify people and demands that Tau be executed on his own shape: \\"It was his body that tyrants took for a model, his shape that they imitated, when they set up the erections on which men are crucified. Σταυρός the vile engine is called, and it derives its vile name from him. Now, with all these crimes upon him, does he not deserve death, nay, many deaths? For my part I know none bad enough but that supplied by his own shape—that shape which he gave to the gibbet named σταυρός after him by men\\"Trial in the Court of Vowels (τῷ γάρ τούτου σώματί φασι τοὺς τυράννους ἀκολουθήσαντας καὶ μιμησαμένους αὐτοῦ τὸ πλάσμα ἔπειτα σχήματι τοιούτῳ ξύλα τεκτήναντας ἀνθρώπους ἀνασκολοπίζειν ἐπ᾽ αὐτά [...] ἐγὼ μὲν γὰρ οἶμαι δικαίως τοῦτο μόνον ἐς τὴν τοῦ Ταῦ τιμωρίαν ὑπολείπεσθαι, τὸ τῷ σχήματι τῷ αὑτοῦ τὴν δίκην ὑποσχεῖν).Lucian, Judicium vocalium, section 12 Tertullian reports that by tradition Christians repeatedly traced on their foreheads the sign of the cross: \\"At every forward step and movement, at every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and shoes, when we bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on couch, on seat, in all the ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the signTertullian, De corona, chapter III (Ad omnem progressum atque promotum, ad omnem aditum et exitum, ad uestitum, ad calciatum, ad lauacra, ad mensas, ad lumina, ad cubilia, ad sedilia, quacumque nos conuersatio exercet, frontem signaculo terimus).De corona militis, 3 And in speaking elsewhere of the same tradition, he indicated that the sign on the forehead was that of the cross: \\"He signed them with that very seal of which Ezekiel spake: 'The Lord said unto me, Go through the gate, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set the mark Tau upon the foreheads of the men.' Now the Greek letter Tau and our own letter T is the very form of the cross, which He predicted would be the sign on our foreheads.\\"Tertullian, The Five Books against Marcion, book III, chapter XXII (omnes fideles [...] signatos illa nota scilicet de qua Ezechiel: Dicit dominus ad me, Pertransi in medio portae in media Hierusalem, et da signum Tau in frontibus virorum. Ipsa est enim littera Graecorum Tau, nostra autem T, species crucis, quam portendebat futuram in frontibus nostris).Adversus Marcionem III, 22 The universality of the Early Christian practice of tracing the sign of the cross on the forehead, not limited to the Roman province of Africa, where Tertullian lived, is shown by the fact that the Egyptian Origen, only some thirty years his junior, interprets similarly the passage of the Book of Ezekiel to which Tertullian referred,Ezekiel 9:4-6 with the difference that Origen saw in the sign on the forehead of which Ezekiel spoke a reference not to the Greek letter tau, but to the tau of the Hebrew alphabet, which earlier had the shape of a cross. Origen took this to be a prophecy of the Early Christian custom of making a cross on their foreheads when undertaking some activity, especially prayer and reading of the sacred texts.Jacobus C. M. van Winden, Arché: A Collection of Patristic Studies (Brill 1997), p. 114  Visual depictions   Crucifixions  The Alexamenos graffito, probably of the third centuryMichael Green, Evangelism in the Early Church, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, p. 244 The oldest extant depiction of the execution of Jesus in any medium seems to be the second- century or early third-century relief on a jasper gemstone meant for use as an amulet, which is now in the British Museum in London. It portrays a naked bearded man whose arms are tied at the wrists by short strips to the transom of a T-shaped cross. An inscription in Greek on the obverse contains an invocation of the redeeming crucified Christ. On the reverse a later inscription by a different hand combines magical formulae with Christian terms.The Magic Crucifixion Gem in the British Museum The catalogue of a 2007 exhibition says: \\"The appearance of the Crucifixion on a gem of such an early date suggests that pictures of the subject (now lost) may have been widespread even in the late second or early third century, most likely in conventional Christian contexts\\".Extract from The Earliest Christian Art (Yale University Press, 2007), pp. 227-232First depiction of Jesus on cross - the Bloodstone amuletBritish Museum Collection online: magical gem / intaglio Better known is the Alexamenos graffito, discovered during excavation of the Paedagogium on Rome's Palatine Hill in 1857.

Zaninotto,M. Zaninotto, La crocifissione negli spettacoli latini (1985), cited in Perrino, \\"La spettacolare vita del Nazareno Gesù\\" (2015) the wrists nailed to the crossbar. None of these ancient depictions is sufficiently detailed to give precise information on the details of how a crucifixion was carried out, but they all show the use of a cross with transom.  Staurogram  Example of a staurogram in the Catacombs The word σταυρός, which in the New Testament refers to the structure on which Jesus died, appears as early as AD 200 in two papyri, Papyrus 66 and Papyrus 75 in a form that includes the use of a cross- like combination of the letters tau and rho. This tau-rho symbol, the staurogram, appears also in Papyrus 45 (dated 250), again in relation to the crucifixion of Jesus. In 2006 Larry Hurtado noted that the Early Christians probably saw in the staurogram a depiction of Jesus on the cross, with the cross represented (as elsewhere) by the tau and the head by the loop of the rho, as had already been suggested by Robin Jensen, Kurt Aland and Erika Dinkler.Larry W.

Abeda competed for Eritrea at the 2018 Winter Olympics in the alpine skiing events. Abeda became the first athlete to compete for Eritrea at the Winter Olympics. He finished 61st in the Giant Slalom event, and did not finish the first run of the Slalom event. Abeda's parents fled the Eritrean War of Independence in the 1980s and emigrated to Canada. Abeda also represented the country at the inaugural Winter Youth Olympics in 2012 in Innsbruck, Austria. Abeda announced his intentions to take the 2018/2019 season off and attend university after the 2018 Winter Olympics Games. He hinted that he would return for the 2022 Winter Olympics games, but also at the possibility of retirement. On July 22, 2019 Abeda officially retired from Alpine and stated that he will compete in bobsleigh instead. Early life Abeda was born in Fort McMurray, Alberta to Eritrean immigrants, Walday Abeda and Ariam Abeda. His parents settled in Fort McMurray after his father received an entry level engineering job. His father is a geological engineer who works in the Oil and Gas industry. He started skiing at the age 3 after his sister took a day trip to the local ski hill and convinced his parents to enroll his siblings into the team. Abeda and his brother wanted to try hockey, but his parents were reluctant and afraid of injuries that might occur. Abeda's family moved to Calgary in 2003 and he started to develop a passion for Alpine Skiing when he started training in the Rocky Mountains at Banff Sunshine. While Abeda enjoyed the different environnment, it wasn't until he was 10 years old that he thought about pursuing an Olympic Career when his coach TJ pushed him outside of his comfort zone. Subsequently, Abeda went on to achieve high rankings in regional races and qualify for national events. Career In 2011, he made the decision to compete for Eritrea in the hopes of competing in the 2012 Youth Olympic games in Innsbruck, Austria. Having two parents of Eritrean descent, Abeda was granted Eritrean citizenship and a passport. He made his first international appearances in 2012 and competed in many regional races in the US and Canada. In 2014, he attempted to qualify for the 2014 Winter Olympics however he missed the cut-off by four FIS points. He subsequently tried again and qualified for 2018 Winter Olympics. Abeda did not compete in an international event until 2018 when he returned to compete in South Korea. After the Olympics, Abeda took a year off to focus on his education and to elect a surgery to fix his jaw. Leading up to the Olympics in December 2017, Abeda partially fractured his jaw and lost two teeth in a training accident. He also sustained a significant injury while training in February 2016 where he tore his anterior cruciate ligament, several other ligaments and partially fractured his tibia. After two surgeries and year of rehabilitation, he returned to competition in March 2017 and successfully met the qualification standards for the games. He planned to return to Alpine for the 2019/2020 season however decided to retire officially. In July 2019, Abeda posted a video on his LinkedIn account showing him training in WinSport's ice house. He hinted at the possibility of switching to Bobsleigh for 2022. Later that month, he confirmed the switch. Training clip from LinkedIn Personal life Abeda is an avid weightlifter and coder. He dedicates most of his off-snow time to his training which includes an extensive amount of olympic weightlifting, boxing, running and programming. Abeda is a strong advocate for Bulgarian style training and heavy lifting. He credits Cory Gregory's SquatEveryDay program as the catalyst behind his training regiment and a vital tool that helped him rehabilitate his knee. He is undertaking his studies at the University of Lethbridge double majoring in Computer Science and Business Administration. After his failure to qualify for Sochi, Abeda was invited to a TedX conference where he discussed his struggles and his methodology to overcome his obstacles. He gave a further explanation as to why he failed to qualify and the toll that it had on his physical, mental and emotional well- being. Abeda also discussed about the negative impact of attending the 2012 Youth Olympic games and how it damaged his moral and reputation. His brother, Metawee accompanied him to the games and walked into the opening stadium during the 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony. Abeda's family also joined and stayed in the village with him to provide support. His father, Walday was the chef de mission. In May 2019, he returned to Eritrea for the Independence Day (Eritrea) to announce his candidancy to compete in 2022 and with the goal of bringing another athlete along with him. He is working with the Eritrean National Olympic Committee to recruit athletes in the diaspora and build a future Winter Olympic team. He resides and trains in Calgary for four months of year and the remaining time he lives in Lethbridge where he attends university. He attended and graduated from William Aberhart High School where he received his French diploma.

The molecule consists of thiophene, substituted at the 3 and 4 positions with an ethylene glycolyl unit. It is a colorless viscous liquid. EDOT is the precursor to the polymer PEDOT, which is found in electrochromic displays, photovoltaics, electroluminescent displays, printed wiring, and sensors. Synthesis and polymerization The original synthesis proceeded via the diester of 3,4-dihydroxythiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate. One synthesis of EDOT. EDOT is often prepared from C4 precursors such as butanediol and butadiene via routes that produce the thiophene and dioxane rings in separate steps. Representative is the reaction of 2,3-butanedione, trimethylorthoformate, and ethylene glycol to form the dioxane. Sulfidization with elemental sulfur gives the bicyclic target. EDOT is converted into the conducting polymer PEDOT by oxidation. The mechanism for this conversion begins with production of the radical cation [EDOT]+, which attacks a neutral EDOT molecule followed by deprotonation. Further similar steps result in the dehydropolymerization. The idealized conversion using peroxydisulfate is shown :n C2H4O2C4H2S + n (OSO3)22− → [C2H4O2C4S]n \\\\+ 2n HOSO3− For commercial purposes, the polymerization is conducted in the presence of polystyrenesulfonate.

She showed modest form as a juvenile in 1968 but developed into a top class performer in the following year, winning the Lingfield Oaks Trial, Epsom Oaks and Ribblesdale Stakes. She did not win again and was retired from racing in 1970. She produced no known foals. Background Sleeping Partner was a grey mare bred in England by her owner Harry Primrose, 6th Earl of Rosebery. She was sent into training with the veteran Jack Jarvis at his Park Lodge Stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Unlike many greys Sleeping Partner was very light in colour from a young age and appeared almost white during her track career. She was sired by Parthia,who won the Epsom Derby in 1959 but was a disappointment as a breeding stallion in Europe before being sold and exported to Japan in 1968. Her dam Old Dutch won two races at Newmarket Racecourse and was a half-sister of the Ebor Handicap winner Donald. She was a great granddaughter of the British broodmare Pearl Maiden (foaled 1918) whose descendants included numerous major winners including Pearl Cap, Pearl Diver, Molvedo, Niniski and Belmez. Racing career 1968: two-year-old season Sleeping Partner raced seven times as a juvenile but was slow to mature and showed stamina but little speed. She recorded her only success in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Ayr Racecourse in September, but did finish second on at least three occasions. In his last phone call to Lord Rosebery, Jarvis said \\"Don't be surprised if I win the Oaks for you this time with Sleeping Partner\\". When Jack Jarvis died in December 1968, the five-time champion jockey Doug Smith took over the training of the horses at the stable, with the 23-year-old Michael Stoute as his assistant. Stoute later recalled \\"Some of the staff we inherited were in their 80s. Jack couldn't bring himself to retire them\\". 1969: three-year-old season Sleeping Partner made her first appearance as a three-year-old in the Oaks Trial at Lingfield Park Racecourse on 17 May and won at odds of 14/1. In the 191st running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 7 June the filly was partnered by the South African-born jockey John Gorton and started at odds of 17/1 in a fifteen-runner field. The leading contenders appeared to be Full Dress and Wenduyne, the winners of the 1000 Guineas and the Irish 1000 Guineas respectively. After being restrained towards the rear in the early stages she produced a sustained run on the outside in the last quarter-mile, overtook the front-running Frontier Goddess inside the final 100 yards and won by three- quarters of a length with Myastrid four lengths back in third place. At Royal Ascot later that month, with Gorton again in the saddle, she was made the 7/4 favourite for the Ribblesdale Stakes and came home five lengths clear of her opponents. Shortly after her win at Ascot Sleeping Partner contracted a respiratory infection which interrupted her season. She ran twomore races that year without recapturing her best form, finishing third behind Frontier Goddess and Wenduyne in the Yorkshire Oaks in August and fourth to Aggravate in the Park Hill Stakes in September. 1970: four-year-old season Sleeping Partner was unplaced on her only start of 1970 and was retired from racing. Breeding record At the end of her racing career Sleeping Partner was retired to become a broodmare at her owner's stud but proved to be barren and produced no known foals. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Sleeping Partner an \\"inferior\\" winner of the Oaks.

In the early 1860s, he returned to the Eastern United States and lived in New York. He married in 1867, but his wife died four years later, after a long illness. Time in Samoa Before his appointment as Prime Minister In the early 1870s, Americans had commercial interests in the Samoan archipelago, which consisted of distinct and sometimes rival indigenous monarchies. British and German commercial interests were also present. A Samoan national government existed, consisting of two joint kings, and a bicameral assembly representing the different districts of the country. Malietoa Laupepa and Tupua Pulepule, from lineages of the traditional aristocracy, were the two kings. In 1873, United States President Ulysses S. Grant sent Steinberger as an emissary to Samoa, to represent him to the chiefs, and to report on the situation on the islands. Steinberger presented himself as a \\"colonel\\", but there is no evidence that he actually held such a rank, although he worked for a time in the US Army's treasury. He spent three months in Samoa, then went to Hamburg to negotiate with the Germans for the establishment of a Samoan government sensitive to American and German commercial interests. Returning to Samoa in 1874 on a US Navy ship, he managed to convene a large gathering of 8,000 chiefs, where a formal exchange of gifts between Samoans and Americans took place. Steinberger suggested to leaders the idea of an American protectorate on the archipelago, saying that it would preserve Samoan autonomy against any foreign power. However, he did not obtain the agreement of the US government for this proposal. Time as Prime Minister Steinberger became influential and popular with the Samoan authorities. As early as 1873, the government drafted a new constitution designed to promote stability favorable to the interests of foreign investors. Instead of a joint monarchy, the greatest chiefs would now alternate on the throne, Malietoa Laupepa exercising alone until his death the functions of king. The parliament is reorganized, now including a chamber of ali'i or nobles (chosen by the various districts of the country, and formally appointed members by the king) and a chamber of elected representatives. Each district had a governor, responsible to the king. On July 4, 1875, he was appointed by the king to the new position of prime minister at the age of thirty-four years. Overall, Samoans are satisfied with these measures, and the government led by Steinberger; as the guarantor of their political independence. Soon, Steinberger exercised an almost absolute power in the archipelago. He displeased the minority of settlers by insisting that laws passed by the indigenous parliament apply to all residents of the country, as the parliament restricted the sale of alcohol. The American and British consuls in Samoa, S.S. Foster and S.F. Williams, suspect him of having become essentially an agent in the service of the Germans. Having obtained the assurance that the American government did not support Steinberger, the British and American consuls obtained from King Laupepa on February 8, 1876, that he dismissed his prime minister and ordered his deportation. He is deported to Fiji, British territory, and never returned to Samoa. Repercussions of his dismissal as Prime Minister His dismissal had important repercussions. For having acted on their own initiative, the American and British consuls were themselves sacked by their respective governments. The Samoan parliament, furious that the king thus yielded to foreign pressure, deposed Laupepa, without appointing another king immediately; nor was there a new prime minister to replace Steinberger. Laupepa then organized a rival government. During the next two decades, the country was marked by instability, especially as the British, Americans and Germans sometimes support different factions. These tensions eventually lead to the tripartite treaty of 1899. Samoa was then split between a German colony and an American colony (while Washington and Berlin sold islands to the British in other parts of the Pacific). Controversies The Samoan historian Malama Meleisea believed that Steinberger helped to consolidate a Samoan government in a difficult period (even if it was ultimately a failure), but that his secret agreements with German companies and planters made him a prime minister never fully devoted to the interests of the Samoans.

Inhalation sedation is a form of conscious sedation where an inhaled drug should: # Depress the central nervous system (CNS) to an extent that surgeons can operate with minimal physiological and psychological stress to the patient # Modify the patient's state of mind such that communication is maintained and the patient can respond to verbal command # Carry a margin of safety wide enough to render the unintended loss of consciousness and loss of protective reflexes unlikely.  Medical uses The following are possible uses for conscious sedation \\"dental anxiety and phobia, a need for prolonged or traumatic dental procedures, medical conditions potentially aggravated by stress (such as ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, asthma and epilepsy), medical or behavioural conditions affecting a patient's ability to cooperate, special care requirements\\".  Side effects  Complications from inhalation sedation are rare, and are those events that require intervention to correct adverse physiological responses. They include over-sedation, respiratory depression/apnoea, unconscious patient, airway obstruction, vomiting, idiosyncratic responses, delayed recovery, and failure of conscious sedation. Few absolute contraindications exist, however, \\"relative contraindications are important and can only be considered following a full assessment.\\" They include: * Medical conditions that would compromise the inhalation of the sedation medication, such as the common cold, tonsillitis, severe COPD or nasal blockage * Neuromuscular diseases affecting the respiratory system, such as multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis * Women in the first trimester of pregnancy * Medical or behavioural conditions that limit a patient's ability to understand the procedure * Claustrophobia or \\"fear of the mask\\".  Patient assessment and selection  Nasal mask or hood On a visit prior to the treatment session, the anesthesiologist makes a full assessment to determine the need for sedation and the technique most suited to the individual patient. This consists of a detailed record of the patient's history and a thorough examination. A medical, dental, and social history covers the patient's age, state of health, social circumstances, drug history, and any special needs. This helps determine the sedation technique most appropriate for a positive outcome for each individual. The examination takes into account the patient's general appearance, skin colour, pulse, blood pressure, and respiration rates. Only patients in ASA classes I and II are normally suitable for sedation in the primary care dental setting. Patients in ASA class III or IV should be referred to an appropriate secondary care (i.e., hospital) establishment with critical care facilities.  Contraindications  Inhalation sedation using nitrous oxide has a long history of safe use in both medicine and dentistry. It can therefore be used safely in most patients in the dental setting. However, in some patients sedation with nitrous oxide would be unsuitable. Some examples are below. * A patient who is unable to use a nasal mask. This is considered an absolute contraindication. Inability to use a mask can either be due to anatomic and/or disease-induced nasopharyngeal obstructions, or due to psychological and/or cognitive disturbances that lead to intolerance of mask placement. Examples of such patients include those with upper respiratory infections; severe sinusitis; and uncooperative paediatric patients or those with a fear of nasal masks. * Patients who have recently undergone ear surgery. This is because any condition that compromises the patency of the eustachian tube increases the likelihood of pressure build up in the middle ear in the presence of nitrous oxide. * Patients diagnosed with certain psychological disorders for example; schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. This is a relative contraindication because nitrous oxide sedation has been successfully used in patients with other personality and psychiatric disorders. The key concern with these patients is the use of nitrous oxide in addition to the many other psychotropic agents that they are already taking. This may further alter such patients’ disposition and lead to highly unpredictable results. Prior medical consultation is highly recommended for this group of patients. * Pregnant patients. This is also a relative contraindication because retrospective studies have failed to identify any adverse outcomes for either the patient or the foetus. However, nitrous oxide sedation, like any other elective dental treatment, should be avoided during pregnancy. This is especially true in the early weeks of pregnancy to minimize the risk of possible toxicity to the developing embryo. Necessary/emergency dental care that requires the use of nitrous oxide to reduce stress should not be denied to a pregnant patient. * Pre-cooperative patients. This is because the patient must understand they must minimize talking and mouth breathing to facilitate proper sedation. * Patients with respiratory conditions such as COPD. These patients depend partly on a low blood oxygen to initiate a breathing stimulus, so inhalation sedation removes that hypoxic drive. {    Problems  Inhalation sedation with nitrous oxide/oxygen is a well recognised safe and effective technique. The desirable effect of the procedure is to relax the patient while maintaining verbal contact. Compared to other sedation agents, it causes minimal physiological stress to the patient and risk of loss of consciousness is less likely. However, problems can still arise. It is vital the dental staff are appropriately trained and qualified in dealing with complications and medical emergencies. Administering oxygen is of highest importance in an emergency situation. If patient is showing signs of oversedation, the concentration of nitrous oxide should be immediately reduced, and the oxygen concentration should be increased. All patients undergoing treatment under sedation should be continually assessed in the following: * Respiratory rate * Heart rate * Oxygen saturation * Colour of skin * Level of consciousness Any deviation from the normal values should prompt the dental clinician to lighten the sedation.The dental clinician cab recognise and deal with the following sedation related complications: * Vasovagal attack (faint). It is more common in severely anxious patients and can be indicated by nausea and vomiting, pallor and a rapid pulse. Management of this patient involves lying patient supine, maintaining the airway and administering oxygen through a face mask. * Airway obstruction. Sedation can hinder the patient's gag reflex. Therefore, patients can find it difficult to remove a foreign body lost in the mouth during dental treatment. If this occurs, the patient should be encouraged to cough. In more serious cases of airway obstruction, up to 5 back blows and abdominal thrusts should be given while the patient is leaning forward. * Severe hypotension. Nitrous oxide causes a decrease in blood pressure due to a reduction in sympathetic function. However, significant hypotension may occur, if a patient sits up too quickly from the supine position or becomes oversedated, which can be potentially dangerous. To manage this complication, the dental treatment should be stopped. The patient should be laid back and basic life support initiated. Oxygen should be administered and the concentration of nitrous oxide reduced. * Nausea and vomiting. This is an undesirable effect of sedation, rather than a secondary complication. It indicates the level of sedation is too high and the concentration of nitrous oxide should be reduced. There are some downsides relating to the use of nitrous oxide. It can present as a potential hazard to the operator in charge of administering the gas. It has been shown that continual exposure to nitrous oxide can result in illnesses, such as haematological disorders and reproductive problems. Thus, active or passive scavenging is essential to remove nitrous oxide from the environment. Another disadvantage can be the risk of mouth breathing. Inhalation sedation requires the patient to breath through the nose, which can be especially difficult in very young children or patients with learning difficulties. Additionally, the drug cannot be used alone; it must be used alongside appropriate methods of behaviour management and local anaesthetic. Therefore, the degree of sedation can depend on the efficacy of behavioural techniques and psychological reassurance from the dentist. } Equipment & safety features  Quantiflex flowmeter In the UK, machines used for the administration of inhalation sedation should follow the British Standards and be well-maintained according to the manufacturer's guidance.  Equipment  Equipment used for inhalation sedation for dentistry include: #Gas cylinders # Flowmeter # Reservoir bag # Conduction Tubing # Breathing apparatus (Nasal hood or face mask)  Safety features  Oxygen fail safe mechanism is the most important safety feature of the equipment used in inhalation sedation. Nitrous oxide flow is only allowed via an opened valve when there is flow of oxygen to the system. In any circumstances when oxygen flow is less than 30%, nitrous oxide stops flowing. This prevents the potential delivery of 100% nitrous oxide and it becomes a standard on every sedation unit made today. 228x228px All nasal hoods should have scavenging ability— provide fresh gas to the patient through one or two hoses while the extra hoses eliminate exhaled gas by the patient via a vacuum system. A pin index safety system prevents incorrectly fitting the two cylinders. In addition, the cylinders are colour coded, which further reduces the risk of incorrect cylinder placement. A diameter index system is also in place to prevent incorrect linking of hoses and stems—the attachment couplings, hoses, and stems are different diameters. Pressure relief devices that dissipate contents of the cylinder to the atmosphere prevent explosion of cylinder due to over-filling. In an emergency, an oxygen flush or emergency oxygen system passes a high flow of high pressure oxygen direct from the source bypassing intermediate meters. Several alarm systems are used to indicate a depleting oxygen supply. Audible alarms are required in Europe and are recommended in the United States.  History  257x257px Nitrous oxide was first discovered by Joseph Priestley in 1772. In 1795, Humphry Davy and surgeon J. B. Borlase experimented with nitrous oxide and the effects of its inhalation. Davy then published a book in 1799 hinting the possible role of nitrous oxide in achieving mild anaesthesia during surgical procedures. In 1844, Dr. Horace Wells carried out an experiment on himself where he had Professor Gardner Quincy Colton administer nitrous oxide to himself prior to a wisdom tooth extraction by Dr. John Riggs. Wells discovered that he was unaware of the procedure and experienced absolutely no pain during the procedure. In 1824, Henry Hill Hickman used carbon dioxide to achieve a state of \\"suspended animation\\" in animals; successfully diminishing pain during the surgical procedure. In 1831, chloroform was discovered by Justus von Liebig in Germany, Samuel Guthrie in New York and Eugène Soubeiran in France, all of whom worked independently. In 1842, a chemist in Rochester, William Edward Clarke provided Dr. Elijah Pope with ether prior to a tooth extraction of his patient. In the same year, a doctor in Georgia, Dr. Crawford W. Long administered ether to John Venable for the removable of a neck tumour.

(Original description) The solid, subcylindrical shell has a rounded bas, flat sides, and a delicately tapered summit. Its colour is pale buff, uniform but for a tinge of lilac on the columella. The shell contains nine whorls, including the protoconch.. The initial whorl of the protoconch is tilted, the first and second smooth and helicoid. The suture is lineai'. Sculpture :—A clathrate sculpture is developed on the third whorl, the next is bicariuate. Later the keels diminish and vanish. There are six ribs to a whorl, elevated, stout, and distant, descending the spire perpendicularly and continuously. At the anterior extremity the ribs run across the aperture. The spirals are even closely packed threads, numbering about seventeen on the penultimate, and about forty on the body whorl. The aperture is very narrow, without denticules on either side. The varix is of the calibre of the preceding ribs. Its insertion does not rise above the plane of the sutui'e, and it fills the interval between two ribs of the preceding whorl. The sinus is small and shallow. The columella is perpendicular. The siphonal canal is short and broad. Hedley, C. 1922. A revision of the Australian Turridae.

Busbey (Illinois's 3rd district). Background Hamilton Robinson was born around 1908 in New Haven, Connecticut. He attended the Taft School. He graduated from Princeton University. He studied for a year at Oxford University. Then, he obtained a law degree at Yale University. Career Robinson began his career in private practice in the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell and became a partner of future Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. Public service In 1940, Robinson moved to Washington to become legal counsel to the British Purchasing Commission. Then, he worked for the deputy administrator of the Lend-Lease Program. He went on active duty in the U.S. Army and served on the staff of Gen. Brehon Somervell, commander of the Army Service Forces. From 1942 to 1946, he had worked with John Foster Dulles at Sullivan & Cromwell. \\"In less than four years in the Army, from 1942 to 1946, he had risen from first lieutenant to lieutenant colonel. He had glowing recommendations as an administrator.\\" In 1946, having left military service as an Army colonel, he joined the State Department as director of the Office of Economic Security Policy. Soon after, he became director of the Office of Controls, responsible for the department's internal security. By 1947, he had also become chairman of the Security Advisory Board of the State, War and Navy Department Coordinating Committee. Robinson had wide responsibility at this point: \\"With 782 employees, Controls was a grab bag of six unconnected divisions including munitions, visa and passport, and security.\\" Loyalty, Lee List, and anti- communism Robinson came under intense pressure from Republicans for \\"lenience,\\" while Democrats objected to his over-strict security guidelines across all government agencies (civilian and military). On March 21, 1947, President Truman's Executive Order 9835 established departmental review boards to remove from government service or to deny employment to persons if \\"reasonable grounds exist for belief that the person involved is disloyal to the United States.\\" Also in 1947, Assistant Secretary of State John E. Peurifoy asked the FBI to conduct an audit of the State Department's Division of Security and Investigations, which found them \\"lacking in thoroughness.\\"Richard Loss, \\"Secretary of State Dean Acheson as Political Executive: Administrator of Personnel Security,\\" Public Administration Review, vol. 34 (1974), 354-6 In June 1947, the State Department dismissed ten (10) employees–\\"none of them of top policy-making rank\\"–on unspecified grounds of disloyalty, as reported by Joseph Alsop and Stewart Alsop. On November 2, 1947, Bert Andrews published \\"A State Department Security Case\\" in the Herald- Tribune based on security a secret transcripts. Robinson's name appeared prominently. Andrews described \\"Mr. Blank,\\" an unnamed State Department official among those discharged without specific charges. Articles continued for some days almost daily by Andrews. The Washington Post reacted the next day with concern: \\"Without access to what the FBI reported, there is no way of knowing whether Mr. Blank was a doubtful security risk.\\" In a comment, New Yorker magazine compared Mr. Blank's story to Franz Kafka's book The Trial. It also singled out Robinson: \\"Hamilton Robinson, a member of the panel, explained the difference between loyalty and security. 'I think loyalty,' he said, must necessarily be a conscious proposition. Security or the lack of it, might be conscious or unconscious'.\\" In an article co-written by Yale Law School professor Thomas I. Emerson, its journal questioned the propriety of the story by noting: \\"The courts have never tolerated the failure to produce in open hearing any part of the evidence upon which the deciding official relies in an administrative adjudication requiring a fair hearing\\" and cited a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. On November 17, 1947, the State Department reversed its policy. It authorized the seven resignations \\"without prejudice\\" and offered right to appeal before a Loyalty Review Board. Meanwhile, congressional investigator Robert E. Lee discovered and examined security files for 108 suspect cases, which resulted in the \\"Lee List\\" used by a congressional subcommittee. During a congressional hearing on March 10, 1948, Assistant Secretary of State Peurifoy claimed the number had dropped from 108 to 57. (On February 9, 1950, McCarthy gave a Lincoln Day \\"Enemies Within\\" speech to the Republican Women's Club of Wheeling, West Virginia. His words in the speech are a matter of some debate, as no audio recording was saved. However, it is generally agreed that he produced a piece of paper that he claimed contained a list of known Communists working for the State Department. McCarthy is usually quoted to have said: \\"The State Department is infested with communists. I have here in my hand a list of 205—a list of names that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department.\\" There is some dispute about whether or not McCarthy actually gave the number of people on the list as being \\"205\\" or \\"57\\". In a later telegram to President Truman, and when entering the speech into the Congressional Record, he used the number \\"57.\\" ) On March 10, 1948, Robinson testified before the Chenoweth committee about his association with Robert Talbot Miller III, No. 12 on the Lee List. Miller had been best man at Robinson's wedding. (Later that year, coincidentally, Elizabeth Bentley would name Miller as one of her sources for intelligence gathered for the Soviets.) On March 13, 1948, President Truman ordered all federal departments to withhold personnel security and loyalty files from Congress. On March 25, 1948, Representative Fred E. Busbey questioned Robinson's competence and loyalty during a public hearing. He called Robnson \\"incompetent.\\" He related the fact that \\"a second cousin of his had gone to Moscow in 1934 and studied Russian.\\" Assistant Secretary of State Peurifoy enabled this line of query by allowing the Busbey to see the Federal Bureau of Investigation file on Robinson (against the orders of President Truman). Adding to the controversy was a refusal only days before by U.S. Secretary of Commerce W. Averell Harriman to turn over loyalty files of NIST chief Edward Condon to the U.S. Senate Atomic Energy Committee. The Washington Post pilloried Busbey's accusation: \\"Busbey's tenuous\\" indictment of the State Department's premier purification expert as a security risk because he has a suspect second cousin could be dismissed as a rather healthy reduction to absurdity of the whole loyalty extravaganza if it did not entail an issue of vital principle. Later life In 1948, Robinson became vice president and treasurer of the Foreign Service Educational Foundation, which supported the School of Advanced International Studies (now part of the Johns Hopkins University; he served in this capacity until 1952. In 1962, he joined the investment banking firm of Alex Brown & Sons. Personal and death Robinson first married Elizabeth Case, who died in 1940; they had three children. He then married Nancy B. Robinson; they had three children. Robinson died age 76 on October 12, 1986, following a heart attack at his home in Washington. See also * Robert E. Lee (FCC) * Bert Andrews (journalist) * Fred E.

Its focus is on compositions of 20th century music. It is characterized in particular by – sometimes radical – extensions of the tonal, harmonic, melodic and rhythmic means and forms. Neue Musik arose from the impression of the twelve-tone technique at the beginning of the last century. Another influence was up to the free atonality given by a desire for an opening of compositional structures and requirements in the beginning of the last century.  History  The term Neue Musik was coined by music journalist Paul Bekker in his 1919 lecture of the same title.Paul Bekker: Vortrag Neue Musik complete text may at one time have been found in Wikisource, but the deletion log does not indicate its presence since the creation of this article in December 2017. The most acknowledged philosopher of the Neue Musik was Theodor W. Adorno, himself a composer in the tradition of Arnold Schoenberg. New music embraces the search for new sounds, new forms or novel combinations of old styles, partly through the continuation of existing traditions, partly through deliberate break with tradition and appears either as progress or as renewal (post- or neo-styles). In order to designate the music of the present in the narrower sense, the term contemporary music is used, without any fixed periodization being addressed. Another term near to the Neue Musik is Gegenwartsmusik (music of the present day). Authors in the German-speaking language area nowadays often tend to write the first letter small instead of capitalized, so today it's often \\"neue Musik\\" instead of \\"Neue Musik\\".  Theory and practice  A question for thematic condensing and more complex diversity often accompanies the Neue Musik. Thus, a distinct increase of moods can be noticed compared to romantic music. Pitch relationships are the crucial factor; further parameters are being implemented in the history of the Neue Musik. Neue Musik primarily is a European music system, whose reputation marks the intellectual peak of understanding music until today. For the interpreters of Neue Musik, an interpretation in many cases means an exponential extension of their skills.Exponential extension of their skills: For example Brian Ferneyhough. \\"His works, it is often said, are the ne plus ultra of musical complexity, in the sense of notational overload, performing difficulty and even philosophical questioning.\\" In: Tom Service – A Guide to Brian Ferneyhough's Music (2012) , The Guardian' (10 September).' This is also a reason, why Neue Musik isn't heard too often in concert halls. From the range of the Neue Musik, the Electronic music emerged. A noticeable break occurred through the absence of nearly any music from 1933 to 1945 in Germany. Nowadays, Adorno's command of autonomy for western art music is also being challenged. Instead, some authors refer to an inherent logic of musical developments.

His American Indian name was Eahantatubbee or \\"He Who Goes Out And Kills.\\" During the American Civil War, Amos served as an interpreter in John W. Pierce's 1st Choctaw Battalion and in Samuel G. Spann's Independent Scouts. In his later years, Amos filed a federal suit which rendered a U.S. Supreme Court decision years after his death. Background Amos was born in the Choctaw Nation before the nation removed west of the Mississippi River. His birthplace is near present-day Marion, Mississippi. Amos' parents were Apatomby and Nahhatema. His family moved to the Indian village called Chunky Chitto when he was an infant. Amos likely attended a missionary school where he gained some mastery of the English language. He was known to be an English to Indian language interpreter. In Alfred J. Brown's History of Newton County from 1834 to 1894, Brown described Amos as being about 60 years old, having a wife, and in poor health. American Civil War Amos served in Pierce's 1st Choctaw Battalion and later Spann's Independent Scouts. He was one of the soldiers who helped with rescue efforts during the Chunky Creek Train Wreck. Confederate Veteran Magazine published an article about the wreck. In the article, Amos was described as a rescuer: > The cry reached the camp. \\"Fly to the rescue!\\" was the command, and in less > time than I can tell the story every Indian was at the scene. It was there > that Jack Amos again displayed his courage and devotion to the Confederate > soldiers. I must not omit to say, however, that with a like valor and zeal > Elder [Jackson], another full-blood Indian soldier, proved equal to the > emergency. Jack Amos and Elder [Jackson] both reside now in Newton County. Amos reported in his pension that he first enrolled in April 1861. By 1863, he was acting as an interpreter for Major John W. Pierce and for Major Samuel G. Spann. Amos was likely with the 1st Choctaw Battalion at the Battle of Ponchatoula. Amos surrendered at Meridian, Mississippi in 1865. Final years Amos' memorial which was dedicated in 2004. Amos lived the remainder of his life in Newton County, Mississippi. Amos did not own a home, so he boarded with several Newton County families during his lifetime. According to census and pension data, Amos resided with Thomas J. Reynolds and Evan S. Gilbert. In 1901, Amos became a member of U.C.V. Camp Dabney H. Maury, No. 1312 which was based in Newton, Mississippi. He attended the 1903 reunion held at New Orleans. A Louisiana journalist wrote an article about him. Jack Amos died in March 1906. Amos' Legacy The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek was agreed to and signed by leaders of the Choctaws in September 1830. Article 14 allowed any member of the tribe to remain in Mississippi, become a citizen of the United States, and given 640 acres of land. Federal authorities failed to implement article 14 properly leaving tribal members landless. For decades after 1830, petitions were created to address article 14 concerns. Dawes Commission The Dawes Commission was designed to transfer tribe-controlled lands in Indian Territory and to privatize those lands for the benefit of tribal members. The Mississippi Choctaws were originally ignored in these transactions, but they soon were included in the proceedings. The Dawes Commission saw 25,000 applications for enrollment as Mississippi Choctaws. A little over 2,500 were identified as Mississippi Choctaws. Appeals and lawsuits Jack Amos led a class action lawsuit and petitioned for lands in Mississippi rather than lands in Indian Territory. Amos and several Mississippi Choctaws filed a lawsuit called Jack Amos et al vs. The Choctaw Nation, U. S. Court of Central District of Indian Territory, No 158. Supreme Court's Decision WINTON v. AMOS, 255 U.S. 373, was argued in January 1919, and re-argued April 1920. A decision was reached on March 7, 1921. Justice Mahlon R. Pitney delivered the opinion of the court.

Geography  The hill rises in the extreme northwest of the Palatinate region. It is the centre of the area known as the Remigiusland and extends west of the River Glan in the parish of the village of Haschbach; 3 kilometres east on the far side of the Glan is the 562-metre-high Potzberg. Access to the Remigiusberg is from the north via the Kreisstraße 69, which branches off Kreisstraße 21 between Haschbach and Rammelsbach.

It was a branch of the Benedictine Abbey of Saint-Remi in Reims and was consecrated to Saint Remigius. Both the priory church and the local area were named after Remigius, even though the saint, who lived in the 5th and 6th centuries, had never visited the area Das Kloster bestand bis zum Jahr 1526, als es im Gefolge der Reformation aufgelöst wurde. The bones of 15 members of the House of Palatinate-Veldenz (County of Veldenz) rest in the priory church. Michelsburg – In 1260, a second castle was built near the abbey which took its name from the patron saint of the castle chapel, St. Michael and which, today, is a ruin. The castle belonged initially to the County of Veldenz, later to the Wittelsbach Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrücken. The castle was badly damaged both during the Thirty Years' War and in the War of the Palatine Succession. After it had been finally laid to waste in the 1790s by French Revolutionary troops, in 1794 permission was granted to use it as a quarry. In 1973/74, restoration work was carried out.

Months later, a similar memorandum was signed with the Malta Stock Exchange to develop a platform for trading security tokens. In 2019, company announced Binance Jersey, an independent entity from its parent Binance.com exchange, with the aim to expand its European influence. Jersey based exchange offers fiat-to-cryptocurrency pairs, including the Euro and the British pound. In August 2018, Binance along with three other big exchanges raised $32 million for a stable coin project. The idea of stable coins is to provide a cryptocurrency without the notorious volatility of Bitcoin and other popular digital assets. In January 2019, Binance announced that it had partnered with Israel-based payment processor Simplex to enable cryptocurrency purchases with debit and credit cards, including Visa and Mastercard. The purchases are subject to Simplex’s local bank policies and are limited to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple’s XRP. On May 7, 2019, Binance revealed that it had been the victim of a “large scale security breach” in which hackers had stolen 7,000 Bitcoin worth around U.S.$40 million at the time. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said the hackers “used a variety of techniques, including phishing, viruses and other attacks” and structured their transaction “in a way that passed our existing security checks.” Binance halted further withdrawals and deposits but allowed trading to continue. The site pledged to reimburse customers through its secure asset fund. On February 21, 2020, the Malta Financial Services Authority issued a public statement responding to media reports referring to Binance as a ‘Malta-based cryptocurrency’ company. The statement noted that Binance “is not authorized by the MFSA to operate in the cryptocurrency sphere and is therefore not subject to regulatory oversight by the MFSA.” The MFSA added that it was “assessing if Binance has any activities in Malta which may not fall within the realm of regulatory oversight.” Binance has also acquired India's biggest Crypto Currency Exchange WazirX and through launchpad also launched an IEO of Matic Network References  External links  * Category:Bitcoin exchanges Category:Digital currency exchanges ","title":"Binance"},{"id":"56180154","text":"3-Chlorobenzoic acid is an organic compound with the molecular formula ClC6H4CO2H.

The house was located on the corner of what is now Keyes Walk and Stoney Street in Nottingham, adjacent to the churchyard of St Mary's Church. The family had occupied the site since at least the thirteenth century. John Plumptre (b. 1679) inherited the house from his father Henry in 1693. The house was remodelled between 1724 and 1730 to the designs of Colen Campbell. The last of the Plumptre family to live in the house was John Plumptre (1711-1791), MP for Nottingham. Following Plumptre's death in 1791, the house was lived in by William Wilson, an Alderman of Nottingham. It was sold in 1841 by C.N. Wright. The property was purchased on 21 February 1853 for £8,410 () by Richard Birkin. The house was let for six years to the Nottingham School of Design. It subsequently moved to Commerce Square, where it became the Nottingham School of Art. The building was demolished in 1860 as the site was cleared for the construction of a lace warehouse.

One deputy was shot dead, and four others were injured. Two civilians were also shot by the suspect, who was later killed in a firefight with a SWAT tactical team. The suspect reportedly used a rifle and a shotgun. Law enforcement had responded first to a noise complaint to the apartment, then to a domestic-disturbance call to the apartment. The suspect reportedly barricaded himself in his bedroom and shot the deputies in an \\"ambush\\" style when they entered. The suspect was later shot dead by a police tactical team that subsequently re-entered the apartment. It was later determined that the suspect, former attorney Matthew Riehl, was a veteran with a history of psychotic episodes and he had recently stopped taking his medication. Events On December 31, 2017, deputies from the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office led by veteran Sgt. Dave Beyer responded to a domestic disturbance in the apartments around 5:20 AM. They had already been called to the apartment earlier, around 3:00 AM, on a noise complaint, but left after they were unable to determine if an offense had taken place. On the second call, officers determined that the alleged shooter, Matthew Riehl, was an individual with mental illness who was presenting a danger to himself and others. They decided to take Riehl into custody on an M-1 (mental health hold). Upon entering the apartment, the officers attempted to gain access to Riehl's bedroom, at which time Riehl began firing rapid rounds through the bedroom door at the officers. Four officers were hit immediately. Three officers (Deputy Jeff Pelle was shot once in the chest. Deputy Taylor Davis was shot five times in her left forearm, front left thigh and left shoulder. Deputy Mike Doyle was shot twice in the left forearm) were able to retreat, but Deputy Zackari Parrish remained in the apartment, injured. During the ensuing standoff, Riehl continued to fire rounds from his bedroom, causing injuries to two civilians and one SWAT officer (Farook Patail was shot once in the left shoulder. Nathan Lapp was shot once in the left elbow. SWAT officer Thomas O’Donnell was shot once in the right front thigh) in neighboring apartments. A SWAT team was finally able to enter the apartment around 7:30 AM, and a gunfight ensued, at which time Riehl was shot in the back and killed by SWAT Officer Ronnie Dorrell. Officers say Riehl fired almost 400 shots, many of which ended up in neighbors' apartments and adjacent buildings.  Victims  Three of the injured, including the injured civilians, were taken to Sky Ridge Medical Center in Lone Tree, Colorado, with injuries that were not critical. Another four were taken to Littleton Adventist Hospital in Littleton. Deputies confirmed that one officer, 29-year-old Deputy Zackari Parrish, was shot multiple times and died at the scene from his injuries. Reactions President Donald Trump extended his condolences to the victims of the shooting via Twitter: \\"My deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in Douglas County @DCSheriff, and their families. We love our police and law enforcement - God Bless them all! #LESM\\". All 11 of the officers involved in the incident were cleared of Riehl's death, and it was officially determined that they acted \\"completely lawfully in using deadly force against Matthew Riehl.\\"  Media depiction  The incident was chronicled on the tenth episode of the first season of the Investigation Discovery TV show Body Cam, which plays footage from multiple body cameras, including those of Sheriff's deputies and SWAT team officers.

She was one of five female first-class passengers (four women and one child) to die when the ship sank. An undocumented legend states she probably died because she did not want to leave behind her Great Dane; a woman was reportedly sighted in the water with her arms frozen around a dog. Biography Ann Elizabeth \\"Lizzie\\" Isham was born on January 25, 1862, in Chicago, Illinois, the first child and eldest daughter of Edward Swift Isham, an American lawyer and politician from Vermont, and Frances \\"Fannie\\" Burch. Her father established a law firm with Robert Todd Lincoln, son of former US President Abraham Lincoln, called Isham, Lincoln & Beale in Chicago, Illinois. Initially Isham lived in Chicago and was a member of the Friday Club and the Scribbler's Club. In 1903 she moved to Paris and lived with her sister, Frances Isham, who had married Harry Shelton. Isham's brother, Edward Isham, lived in New York City and she was going back to the United States to spend the summer with him. She boarded the Titanic at Cherbourg on April 10, 1912. Her cabin (C-49) was next to that of Colonel Archibald Gracie, although he did not remember ever seeing her. She was said to have been in a lifeboat ready to sail away when she was told that she was unable to bring her Great Dane on board with her. She chose to get out of the lifeboat. There is no actual evidence for this, however. She was one of four first class women who died in the disaster, and her body was never identified. A few days later, a passenger on a passing ship reported seeing a woman's body floating in the ocean and holding on to the body of a large dog. A memorial to her was erected by her family in Vermont.

He is known for remaining silent for an entire year to raise awareness on animal cruelty. Personal life James Aspey was born in Sydney, Australia. Aspey was diagnosed with leukaemia when he was 17, with his physicians telling him that he would live for just six weeks. However, he recovered and underwent chemotherapy for three years, during which time he started abusing drugs. Upon recovery, he became a personal trainer and started working on a cruise ship. Seven years later, he tried becoming a vegetarian for a week on an experimental basis after having been told by an Indian traveler that \\"eating animals is bad karma\\". More analysis on vegetarianism eventually led him to veganism. Animal rights advocacy Aspey traveled around Australia, writing a blog and cycling 5000 km from Darwin to Sydney \\"to raise awareness of the cruel ways in which humans currently exploit other animals for food, clothing, entertainment, and testing.\\" On 1 January 2014, Aspey pledged not to speak for 365 days as activism to protest and highlight animal cruelty. On 13 January 2015, he broke his silence by giving a speech on television in the Australian morning show Sunrise. He credited the idea of his silent protest as arising from his attendance at a meditation centre, having abstained from speaking for ten days. During that initial silent period, he decided to remain silent in order to \\"inspire others to live in alignment with what they already believe (that animals deserve to be free from unnecessary suffering and death) by adopting a vegan ethic.\\" By 2017, he had given 150 free speeches. In 2016, Aspey was tattooed continuously for 24 hours to raise money for three charities. His animal rights speech, which had gone viral, has been viewed over 6 million times.

According to the American College of Surgeons, outcomes for rectal cancer patients in Europe have for years been significantly better than for those in the U.S. Characterized by the use of multidisciplinary teams to make treatment decisions, the NAPRC standards aim to decrease the average circumferential resection margins, decrease the overall colostomy rate, and increase quality of life as reported by recovering patients. Two statistics illustrate the difference in treatment. A decade ago, the colostomy rate in Europe ranged from 25 percent to 35 percent, while today’s colostomy rate in the U.S. is about 50 percent, meaning that many more patients in the U.S. have colostomies as compared to Europeans. Rectal cancer cases in the U.S. have an average circumferential resection margins (CRMs) rate of 17 percent, significantly higher than the 3 percent to 11 percent range for European countries.  Background  Collaboration between numerous professional organizations serves as the driving force behind the creation of the NAPRC and its standards. To create the new standards and address the disparities between treatment in Europe and the U.S., the OSTRiCh (Optimizing Surgical Treatment of Rectal Cancer) Consortium was created by the American College of Surgeons and its Commission on Cancer (CoC) working with the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS), the College of American Pathologists, the American College of Radiology, the Society of Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES), the Society for the Surgery of the Alimentary Tract and Society of Surgical Oncology. Lead members of the steering committee include Steven D. Wexner, MD, FACS, past president of the ASCRS, and Frederick L. Greene, MD, FACS, past chair of the CoC. The NAPRC is the fourth accreditation program approved by the CoC. Prior to the CoC's creation of the NAPRC, a study was conducted on the current state of treatment in the US. The study was published in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons. The results showed that the full set of proposed quality standards were only met in 28.1% of patients, who were all diagnosed between 2011 and 2014 with non-metastatic rectal cancer. The completion of these measures varied based on location of the facility, type of facility, insurance, race, stage of disease, and operative volume. The study's authors plan to review the data once more in two or three years, According to the CoC, an inclusive approach was taken with the goal of providing the maximum number of patients with the option to go to an accredited facility. In June 2017 the ACS issued a press release stating that the NAPRC is accepting applications. Accreditation requires previous CoC accreditation, an on-site visit, and records showing that NAPRC standards have been in place for no less than twelve months. The chair of the NAPRC is Steven D. Wexner, MD. The vice chair is James W. Fleshman, Jr., MD.  Standards  One of the main requirements of maintaining NAPRC accreditation is having multidisciplinary teams, i.e., the establishment and use of teams that include not only the surgeon, but also representatives from pathology, radiology, imaging, and medical oncology. This is similar to the existing National Accreditation Program for Breast Cancer, which various facilities already have in place. This team model is based on European standards of care and medical practice, and it entails collaboration by team members on decisions regarding therapy and all aspects of surgical treatment. When these multidisciplinary teams were put into place in Europe, they saw improved outcomes for patients as well as a decrease in recurrence rates and an increase in overall survival rates. Another main requirement is the use of synoptic rather than narrative reporting. According to the American College of Surgeons, synoptic reports have been shown to collect 99 percent of critical patient data, while narrative reports typically capture less than 50 percent, according to studies on the subject. When patients are provided with specific checklists and questions, they report significantly more details which may be pertinent to future care.

Intended to relieve the busy Line 1, the Line 7 will start in Renca in the northwest, passing through the city center, before ending in the borders of Las Condes and Vitacura in the northeast. Expected to be finished by 2028, it will add 19 new stations and 24.8 km of track to the system. Route In most of its route, it will be parallel to Line 1, with the idea of decongesting it and reducing its flow by approximately 10,000 passengers. The line will have transfers with lines 1, 2, 3 and 5, and will directly benefit the communes of Renca, Cerro Navia, Quinta Normal, Santiago, Providencia, Las Condes and Vitacura; of these, Renca, Cerro Navia and Vitacura will have access to the metro for the first time. Its construction was announced by President Michelle Bachelet during the public account of June 1, 2017. According to the original project, it will start at the intersection of the avenues Brazil with Vicuña Mackenna in Renca, from where it will start to the south, following the route of the last street it will cross the Mapocho river at the height of the Resbalón bridge in Cerro Navia, and from there it will continue by Rolando Petersen to the south, until its intersection with Mapocho Avenue; here it will go towards the east following this same route, it will cross the communes of Cerro Navia and Quinta Normal, connecting in a perpendicular way the lines 2 and 3 in Puente Cal y Canto, to continue under the park corridor that borders the Mapocho (Forestal and Balmaceda); in this route it will combine with lines 5 and 1 at Baquedano. After passing through the Balmaceda park following Andrés Bello, it will continue to connect with the Line 1 at Pedro de Valdivia, then head through the Southern border of Vitacura until Alonso de Córdova, where it will connect with Presidente Kennedy to finish its route in the junction of Presidente Kennedy with Estoril in Las Condes and Vitacura. Among the landmarks of Santiago that will have access to the metro for this new line are the new Felix Bulnes Hospital, the El Cerro Park, the Casona Dubois Cultural Center, the Benjamín Franklin Industrial High School, the Padre Renato Poblete river park, the Los Reyes Park, Central markets, Tirso de Molina and Vega Central, Plaza Baquedano, Sanhattan neighborhood, Bicentennial park, Parque Arauco, the Alto Las Condes shopping center and Las Condes and Tabancura clinics. Chilean transport experts propose that the line be modified to the international airport by San Daniel, Rio Itata and Armando Cortínez Oriente avenues in Pudahuel, passing through the Enea business park and with 22 stations, adding four and removing the three most western of the project. Metro SA did not rule it out, and the firm Enea offered to facilitate it. On December 22, 2017 the newspaper El Mercurio published a report that indicated that the route of the line was modified, so it will not circulate along Andrés Bello Avenue, but will go parallel to Line 1 through Providencia Avenue, eliminating a planned transfer in Salvador and transferring it to Pedro de Valdivia, to then continue with its original layout in Isidora Goyenechea (where it will combine with Line 6 in a station with the same name), and a section of the route in the sector of Kennedy Avenue will be diverted by Cerro Colorado. Along with this it was announced that the line will be inaugurated in 2026. Línea 7 cambia de ruta: irá por Av. Providencia y llegará al barrio de oficinas de Rosario Norte Social benefits According to estimates of the Ministry of Transport, the time savings for people traveling from Renca to Vitacura will be 1 hour per trip, that is, 2 per day, equivalent to 21 days per year. There will be 1945 urban hectares (greater than the area of Providencia) at a distance of less than 600 meters from any station on the line, so the number of people who can access a station on foot is estimated at 322 979 inhabitants, considering the estimated densification. It also helps to distribute more evenly the inflow between the different metro lines, thanks to its route and combination stations. In addition to the logical benefits that it will bring in terms of transfer times, Line 7 stands out for its contribution to the socio-economic and geographical integration of the city, since it connects the most neglected and deteriorated parts in terms of urban investment, infrastructure and connection, as it is the northwest of Santiago, with the center and northeast of the city, where the commerce and the jobs prevail. It will also generate greater densification of housing and population in the areas surrounding the stations, promoting the private investment of real estate, as well as trade and services, in poor areas of the city. It will discourage the use of cars in the saturated north-east sector, mitigating vehicular congestion and air pollution.

He was archbishop of Trani from 1607 to his death. Life Diego Álvarez was born at Medina de Rioseco, Old Castile, about 1555. He entered the Dominican Order in his native city, and taught theology for twenty years in the Spanish cities of Burgos, Trianos, Plasencia, and Valladolid, and for ten years (1596-1606) at the Dominican convent of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, in Rome. From 1603 to 1606 he was elected Regent of the Collegium Divi Thomae of the Dominicans in Rome. Shortly after his arrival in Rome (7 November 1596) he presented to Pope Clement VIII a memorial requesting him to examine the work Concordia liberi Arbitrii, by Luis de Molina, S.J., which, upon its publication in 1588, had given rise to bitter controversy, known as Molinism, on the extent of knowledge of God in the Divine providence. Before the Congregation (Congregatio de Auxiliis), appointed by the Pope to settle the dispute, he defended the Thomistic doctrines of grace, predestination, etc., alone for three years, and, thereafter, conjointly with his confrere Tomas de Lemos, to whom he gave the first place, until the suspension of the Congregation (1606). He was appointed on 19 March 1607, by Pope Paul V, to the Archbishopric of Trani. The episcopal consecration followed on 1 April in the Basilica of Santa Maria sopra Minerva by the hands of Girolamo Bernerio.

Listed as T.H. Butler in the official Tennessee Blue Book, Thomas Harvey Butler served as the fifteenth Secretary of State for the State of Tennessee from 1870 to 1873 under Governors Dewitt Clinton Senter and John Calvin Brown. From 1875 to 1876 Butler served as the State Senator for the Ninth District in the Tennessee Senate, a member of the 39th General Assembly or Legislature, representing the Counties of Macon, Clay, Smith, Trousdale, Sumner, and Jackson. T.H. Butler also raised a future statesman, his son Mounce Gore Butler, a United States Congressman who represented Tennessee in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1905 to 1907. In 1910 Secretary Butler was posthumously honored by a later Secretary of State, Hallum Goodloe, by hanging Butler's portrait on the walls of Tennessee's State Capitol. Soldier T.H. Butler enlisted in the 25th Tennessee Infantry of the Confederate States Army on August 10, 1861 at age 35 in Livingston, Tennessee. Butler was appointed by Gov. Isham Harris to the Commissary Office as a Captain of the 25th Tennessee under Colonel Sidney S. Stanton on September 27, 1861 and was honorably discharged by Gen. George G. Dibrell on March 7, 1862. In his post-military career Captain Butler was known as Colonel Butler, a title of respect given to older Southern gentlemen to honor them for exemplary community leadership or government statesmanship. Attorney T.H. Butler practiced law as an attorney based in Gainesboro, Tennessee, as did his son Bowen Butler who also practiced law in Nashville, Tennessee, both of whom are mentioned in Bowen's prestigious biography entry in the book Tennessee, the Volunteer State 1769-1923 which describes T.H. Butler as \\"an able attorney and one of the foremost men in public affairs of Tennessee. For sixteen years he was retained in the office of Circuit Court Clerk of Jackson County, after which he was made County Clerk, ... later he was appointed United States commissioner.\\" T.H. Butler's impressive service as U.S. Commissioner for the Federal Judiciary spanned approximately a decade from 1877 to 1887. A man of many titles, Commissioner Butler also may have been known as Judge Butler when he served as a Justice of the Peace. Two other sons and a son-in-law of T.H. Butler were prominent lawyers as well, W. Bailey Butler, General Mounce Gore Butler, and General George H. Morgan. Generals Butler and Morgan both served as Attorneys General for Tennessee's 5th Judicial Circuit. Engineer T.H. Butler's work in the field of civil engineering involved road and highway construction, bridge building, and land surveying. In March 1854, \\"An Act to incorporate the Lafayette, Rome, and Lebanon Turnpike Company\\" by the Tennessee 30th General Assembly was passed into law in which T.H. Butler was named among \\"a body politic and corporate to open books and receive stock for the purpose of constructing the Jennings and Line creeks turnpike road [State Route 56] from Gainsboro' by the nearest and most direct route to the Kentucky State line, in the direction of Tompkinsville, Kentucky\\" and \\"to bridge Line and Jennings creeks on the line of said road.\\" Years later in March 1860, \\"An Act to charter the Granville and Martin's Creek Turnpike Company\\" by the Tennessee 33rd General Assembly was passed into law which appointed T.H. Butler as a Commissioner for the purpose of locating the route upon which the Gainesboro and Defeated Creek Turnpike (State Route 53) would best be built, \\"to survey the two routes from Gainsboro', by the way of Flynn's Lick, to ... Smith county.\\" In 1870 working with fellow surveyor William Gore, T.H. Butler was instrumental in helping establish a new county in Tennessee, namely Clay County. Butler's engineering skills would eventually aide him in his turnpike and railroad-oversight roles as ex-officio Internal Improvement Commissioner and as a Commissioner of Railroads while serving as Secretary of State. Family T.H. Butler's first wife was Mary \\"Polly\\" Gore (1822–1851), a distant relative of U.S. Vice- President Al Gore. According to Susan Butler's family Bible, Thomas and Mary were married July 2, 1844, and \\"their issue are Mary Ann, William Bailey, Mounce Gore and Sarah Ellenor.\\" Thomas H. Butler Grave Monument (Photo by Fay C. Leonard, 2017) Butler's second wife was Sarah Ann Holford (1834–1900), and they \\"were married 14 April 1853 and their issue are Lizzie Loucetta, John Franklin, Bowen Butler, George Grundy, Martha Jane, Dixie, Rosa Lee, Thomas Harvey, and James Wash, Sam Stone.\\" T.H. Butler was born in Clay County (then Jackson County), Tennessee, the son of Colonel Bailey Butler (1779–1842) and Sarah \\"Sally\\" Scanland (1789–1828). On July 4, 2003, the Tennessee Historical Commission dedicated an official historical marker in their hometown of Butler's Landing which the Butlers founded. T.H. Butler's pioneer father and their family are honored on one side of the marker, while Butler's Landing and Daniel Boone are honored on the other side of the same marker.

Life  She was born in Thessaloniki (then Salonica) in northern Greece. Free preview only As a young woman Sarfatty was well educated. She studied couture in Marseille, and was fluent in French, Greek and Ladino. She was part of the high society of Salonica, being presented as a debutante. After the Nazis invaded Salonica in 1941 she volunteered with the Red Cross, and also carried messages between young men in the labour camps and their families. She fell out with Vital Hasson, the leader of the Jewish collaborators. She was engaged to be married but her fiancé was shot on what was to be their wedding day after Hasson informed the Nazis that he had escaped from his labour group. Sarfatty was imprisoned by the Nazis in their Pablo Mela prison, but escaped with the help of a partisan disguised as a German officer: this partisan was later captured, tortured and killed. Sarfatty joined the partisans, adopting the name of Maria (Maritsa) Serafamidou, supposedly from Comotini in Thrace. She worked with them during the rest of the war, and a film was later made, in Greece, about her achievements. In 1945 she returned to Salonica to work as a dietician for the refugee camps but also, under cover, to arrange transport to Palestine for Jewish survivors. In 1946 she married Max Garfinkle with whom she had worked in Salonica; after a short stay at his kibbutz in Israel they moved to Montreal, Canada, in 1947.

Better to grow the trees into one solid piece. For example, a chair or a light shade. Ideally the tree would have the ability to re-shoot and in this way yield furniture the way an apple tree in an orchard does. Working together with his wife Alice Munro. The concept is train young trees to grow on plastic molds until maturity. Thereby creating no wood waste. This process can take up to eight years to mature. 2006 Full Grown started planting trees to grow furniture. On a 2.5 acre field around 3,000 trees have been planted with production getting underway in late 2011. Early in 2015 the first prototype chair was completed. This chair took five years to grow. Some lampshades 2012 batch were also recently completed in 2015. Gavin Munro Gavin Munro Gavin Munro was born in Matlock England. He studied furniture design. He created driftwood furniture while in San Francisco. Munro's mother inlaw allowed the first prototypes of the chairs to be grown in their garden. He co-foundered Full Grown. Full Grown in 2017 In a small field north of Derby Full Grown is currently tending 400 trees. They are only making 50 or so pieces a year. The first batch was to be harvested in 2015 The lamps and mirror frames should be ready by late spring 2016. By mid 2017 the first chairs should be available. Most of the chairs have been pre-sold. With the chairs selling for a per-order price £2,500 each, a finished chair the price is £5,000. Light shades priced between £1,000 and £1,500 and Hexagon mirror frames £450. Bulk of the pre- orders are from outside the Uk most in France and the US with some orders from London, Hong Kong, Germany and Spain. Full grown are using permaculture ideas to help with pest control and tending field.  Design  The chairs are based on 18th century \\"Shaker\\" with some mid-century Scandinavian design centering around the idea the function is intrinsic to usefulness. The chairs are grown upside down.  Exhibitions  *The National Craft Centre - Lincoln, *Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen - Rotterdam, Netherlands *Tutti Cortex gallery - Rotterdam, Netherlands *Little Moreton Hall - Cheshire, UK - *National Museum of Scotland - Edinburgh, UK (Permanent Collection) Process of tree shaping The trees are trained along pre-defined routes following a blue plastic mold. The growing tip is shaped and held in place with small plastic clasps. The trees are gently manipulated to create the exact shape of chairs, tables, mirror frames or lamps. You can't force the trees as a tortured branch dies back and will reshoot elsewhere. The shaping can be inch-by-inch over the span of a few years. One tree has been planted specifically to grow each piece. Some of the pieces use grafting as part of the design. This process of growing the piece take somewhere between 4–8 years. During this time a piece thickens and matures before being harvesting in the winter. Once seasoned the pieces are cleaned back and finished off to show the wood grain.

Biography Born in St. Louis, Chase had moved to Washington, D.C. by 1890, and would spend the majority of her life in that town. She studied art under Edmund C. Messer, Bertha E. Perrie, William Henry Holmes, Henry B. Snell, William Lester Stevens, and George Pearse Ennis, and attended classes at the Chester Springs Summer School. Long active in the arts community in Washington, she was a charter member of the Arts Club of Washington; other organizations to which she belonged included the Washington Water Color Club, the Society of Washington Artists, the American Watercolor Society, and the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors. With these groups she exhibited at such venues as the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Witte Museum. She was one of a small number of women allowed to show work with the Landscape Club of Washington, and she participated in the Greater Washington Independent Exhibition of 1935. For a number of years she taught at the Abbott School of Fine and Commercial Art. Chase received an honorable mention for her work at the Women's National Exhibition in St. Louis, and in 1917 she was awarded a medal from the Washington Water Color Club, on whose board she served and whose president she once was. Later in life she went to live with a daughter in Clearwater, Florida, in which town she died. She was buried at Arlington National Cemetery next to her husband, Volney Ogle Chase, with whom she had had two children; the grave marker gives her date of birth as 1864. Work Chase produced mainly watercolors during her career, many of them depicting scenes from around Washington, D.C. She also worked in gouache. One of her watercolors, an Interior from c. 1933–1943, is currently owned by the Smithsonian American Art Museum, to which it was transferred by the General Services Administration from the Internal Revenue Service.

After initially serving in the Austro-Hungarian Navy during World War I and later in the French Navy, she was transferred to Romania and fought during World War II, being sunk in July 1941. Construction and career Initially named Basilisk, the vessel was laid down at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in 1901. She was launched on 28 November 1902, and was completed on 21 February 1903. She served during World War I as one of the four minelayers of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Basilisk displaced 314 tons, measuring 46 meters in length, with a beam of 7.9 meters and a draught of 1.5 meters. One cylindrical boiler and one set triple-expansion engine generated an output of 550 hp, giving her a top speed of 11 knots. Her armament consisted of two 47 mm Škoda L/44 naval guns, two 8 mm machine guns and 145 mines. She had a crew of 40. Following Austria-Hungary's defeat in 1918, the vessel was ceded to France as a war prize in 1920 under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and renamed Aurore. She was transferred to Romania in 1922 and renamed Aurora. However, she was decommissioned five years later and sold for merchant service to the Romanian Danube Navigation Company (SRD - Societate Anonima Româna de Navigatie pe Dunare), Bucharest.

The current Catholic hymnal has only four stanzas as GL 411, which are in the general section of praise.  History  Johannes Geissel wrote the lyrics in 1837 as a Christmas carol in ten stanzas.#119 In Johannes von Geissel's Schriften und Reden (Cologne, 1869) (of all hymns and poems): \\"Composed in the years 1835, 1836 and 1837\\" In a version printed version of 1969, the song is called a paraphrase and expansion (\\"\\") of a different song, \\"\\" from the collection , a hymnal for use at church and at home, published by in 1741 in Cologne. The song \\"\\" is titled \\"\\" (The shepherds sing for the sleeping Saviour), a pastoral lullaby in a triple metre.Still geschwinde, Melodie mit beziffertem Bass und vollständiger Text (1755) The same melody was used also for \\"\\" and is the current melody, with only slight changes reducing ornaments and melismas. When the German Catholic hymnal was compiled in 1975, the song was not chosen for the common section (), but was part of most regional sections. In the current of 2013, it appears in the common section, but in only four stanzas, and as GL 411, which is in the general section of praise, not noticeably related to Christmas.  Content  Geissel used only some elements from the eight stanzas of the model \\"\\", in which wind, snow and rain are called to silence in order to not disturb the slumber of the baby. Being created by God, the natural forces have to obey, and praise by becoming silent. This idea of praise by all creation is the main theme of Geissel from the beginning. All creatures are not called to silence, but to loud praise of the incarnation in singing and rejoicing. Several of the ten stanzas anticipate the Passion of Jesus, but only one of these (No. 9) became part of the current version (No. 3).

The dashing of a calabash by the Zulu King signifies that the people may now enjoy the fruits of the harvest. Umkhosi Wokweshwama (\\"first fruits festival\\"), recently also known as Umkhosi Woselwa (\\"calabash festival\\"), is the annual harvest festival of the Zulu people, observed around the December solstice. It takes place at the Enyokeni Royal Palace in Nongoma, KwaZulu-Natal, and is presided over by the Zulu King, who conducts a tasting ceremony as sacred king, closed by the dashing of a calabash to signify that the people may now enjoy the fruits of the harvest; this role was historically expanded by Shaka to have more military significance with a muster and parade. It was revived by the current king Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu in 1990, after a ban by British colonial authorities following the 1879 Battle of Isandlwana and Zulu defeat in the Anglo-Zulu War (the last was held in winter 1877–78, though some claim continuity as a less elaborate event). The festival has mass participation by young men, as Umkhosi woMhlanga has by young women. There is a black bull sacrifice in the king's kraal as the young men work together to kill the animal without weapons, which was the subject of a failed lawsuit by South African animal rights activists in 2009. The sacrifice of the bull is seen as transferring the bull's power to the king. The iNkatha was also renewed. The Scottish mythographer James George Frazer speculated that this reflected an ancient practice of sacrificing the king himself. The Kingdom of Swaziland's counterpart event is Incwala, part of a larger family of Nguni First Fruit traditions. Aspects of the festival have been adapted by the Zulu-initiated Nazareth Baptist Church in its celebration of Christmas. The Zulu festival was a partial inspiration for the modern African-American holiday of Kwanzaa.

Founders and early members included Prince Amy, Lincoln Elliot, Bristol Yamma, Zingo Stevens and Newport Gardner. Background Although Rhode Island had abolished African slavery in 1652, this law was not enforced; by 1750, Rhode Island had more slaves per capita than any other New England state. Enslaved blacks worked as seamen, farm laborers, and domestic servants. It was not until the Rhode Island General Assembly passed the Gradual Emancipation Act in March 1784 that slavery in Rhode Island was gradually ended. Even after this time, Newport, as a busy port city, remained a center of the U.S. slave trade until at least 1807. Since most sources of welfare at the time were controlled by whites, free blacks across the early United States created their own mutual aid societies. These societies offered cultural centers, spiritual assistance, and financial resources to their members. Founded in 1780, Newport's Free African Union Society was the first mutual aid society for blacks in the United States, and similar societies formed throughout the Northeast during the next thirty years, including Philadelphia's Free African Society in 1787. History The Free African Union Society of Newport was established on November 10, 1780 by Newport Gardner and Pompe (Zingo) Stevens. The purpose was to assist the poor and sick, and to show mainstream white society that blacks could be responsible citizens. They provided members with proper burials, cared for widows and orphans, and promoted the cause of abolition. They also kept basic records of blacks in the community, and hired young enslaved black apprentices in hopes of helping them purchase their freedom. At least 85 members of the Free African Union Society between 1787 and 1810 have been identified by name. In 1824, the society changed its name to Colored Union Church and Society. Legacy Newport today is home to a large African-American burying ground called \\"God's Little Acre.\\" It may be home to the largest and oldest surviving collection of burial markers of enslaved and free Africans from the time period.

It is a Grade II* listed building and has been converted into flats. History Gledhow Hall circa 1890 Civic Trust plaque Gledhow Hall is built on what was monastic land, the property of Kirkstall Abbey. The abbey was the major landowner in the Allerton area in the 13th century. The abbey lands were seized by the Crown in 1539 at the Dissolution of the Monasteries. John Thwaites bought the land and built a hall. It was remodelled between 1764 and 1767 by John Carr for Jeremiah Dixon, who was by then the owner. J. M. W. Turner painted a watercolour view of the hall in about 1816, staying at the house while he made preparatory sketches.Gledhow Valley Conservation Area Appraisal By 1885, James Kitson, 1st Baron Airedale had purchased the hall and was living there. Between 1885 and 1890, the hall was altered and extended by architects, Chorley and Connon. Burmantofts Pottery created an elaborate faience (glazed architectural terra-cotta) bathroom before a visit from the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) circa 1885. Albert Kitson, 2nd Baron Airedale succeeded to the title and the estate on his father's death in 1911. The Kitsons entertained several Liberal Prime Ministers and their families at Gledhow: William Gladstone and his son, H. H. Asquith and his wife in 1913, and in 1920, Margaret Lloyd George when she was in Leeds for a reception of women supporters of the wartime coalition. VAD hospital After the outbreak of the First World War, Lord Airedale offered the hall for use as a Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) hospital. Run by the British Red Cross, it was staffed by both professional and VAD nurses. The hospital opened in 1915 and his cousin Edith Cliff was its commandant (i.e. officer in charge) throughout the war. She kept a scrapbook, The Great European War, Gledhow Hall Hospital, documenting life there between 1915 and 1919. The scrapbook, filled with \\"photographs, newscuttings, letters and ephemera\\", is held by Leeds Libraries as one of its most important treasures The scrapbook was chosen for the UK-wide Digital War Memorial, hosted by Historypin, a user-generated archive in 2014. Community groups from local libraries, guided by an artist, worked to \\"find the voice\\" of the scrapbook and explore themes around it, visited and photographed Gledhow Hall including its faience bathroom.

J. A. Sire under the pseudonym \\"Marcantonio Colonna\\" (the name of a Catholic admiral who fought at the Battle of Lepanto). Published initially in Italian, and later in English, the book takes a highly critical view of Pope Francis and his papacy over the Catholic Church. The book contends to be \\"the inside story of the most tyrannical and unprincipled papacy of modern times,\\" arguing that Pope Francis, while presenting himself as humble, rules over the Church through fear and has allied to some of the most corrupt elements in the Vatican. On its 2017 release, the book reached 4th place on Amazon Kindle's Religion and Spirituality bestseller list. A revised and updated English edition of The Dictator Pope was released both in hardcover and e-book formats by Regnery Publishing on April 23, 2018. An audiobook edition produced by Blackstone Audio was also released the same day. Content Pope Francis in 2015 The book places the political and theological statements made by Pope Francis, as well as his leadership style, into a specifically Argentine context, comparing him to former President Juan Perón, whereby Perón during his political career was able to talk to diametrically opposed political tendencies and tell each of them that they were right and that he agreed with them. The book presents this supposed Peronist attitude as a kind of ruthless opportunism according to The Spectator. Topics of discussion in the book include the background to Pope Francis' ascent to the Papacy, mentioning the St. Gallen Group of supposed \\"liberal modernist\\" high ranking clerics, maturated under Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini who are alleged to have attempted to stop Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger from becoming pope during the 2005 Papal conclave. According to The Catholic Herald, the author \\"Colonna\\" alleges that this group adopted Bergoglio as their candidate for the 2013 Papal conclave, \\"With Martini dead, and most of the group coming within a hair of the cut-off age for participation in a conclave, time was running out – they knew this was their last realistic chance.\\" \\"Colonna\\" states in his book that much of the controversy surrounding the Synod on the Family was a product of the St. Gallen Group's desire to change Catholic moral teaching as it applied to giving Holy Communion to the divorced. He makes the claim, quoting Cardinal Wilfrid Napier, that Pope Francis deliberately stacked the Synod with prelates who agreed with his view. Also discussed are the Vatican's interventions in the cases of the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and the firing of three members of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith (which Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller protested against). The book asserts that Pope Francis rules the Roman Curia \\"by fear\\". According to The Australian, outside of theological concerns, a major topic in the book is what \\"Colonna\\" views as the failure of Pope Francis' papacy when it comes to financial reform and the elimination of corruption in the Vatican. \\"Colonna\\" specifically accuses four men of obstructing financial reform; Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, the head of the Vatican Bank, Domenico Calcagno, the Prefect for Catholic Education Giuseppe Versaldi and the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, Giuseppe Bertello. It also discusses the police raid and subsequent confiscation of a large number of documents from the offices of Pope Francis-appointed Auditor General Libero Milone, who was forced to step down in September 2017 in murky circumstances. First Things reported that the book discusses how a professional financial audit by PwC, commissioned by Cardinal George Pell, was suspended in 2016 by Substitute for General Affairs, Archbishop Giovanni Angelo Becciu (under the orders of Cardinal Parolin). The reception of Pope Francis's papacy by the secular western world, particularly the non-Catholic media is discussed, while the book says that his papacy is less popular with Catholics. \\"Colonna\\" cites the dropping attendance figures at St. Peters Square for Papal weekly audiences from a high of 51,617 in 2013 to under 10,000 in 2016. Pope Francis's public image of a humble man is also put under scrutiny. Reception The book drew support from conservative and traditionalist-leaning lay publications such as The Catholic Thing, One Peter Five, The Remnant and ChurchMilitant.com. The book received mixed reviews from Dan Hitchens in The Catholic Herald and Philip Lawler in The Catholic World Report. Hitchens stated that the book contained unproven claims and was \\"not for the easily scandalised\\", but was \\"judiciously written and genuinely insightful\\". Hitchens questioned the author about the book's claim of a \\"disappeared report\\" by Peter Hans Kolvenbach, former Superior General of the Society of Jesus, which allegedly stated that a younger Pope Francis was \\"unsuitable\\" to be made a bishop because of \\"character defects\\". The author responded that it was not a rumour, but first-hand information from a priest who had read the report. Lawler stated that the book \\"is the product of a great deal of solid reporting\\", but criticised it for failing to provide evidence for its more extreme or implausible claims. He said that the fact that the work was pseudonymously self-published was likely to limit its readership, and that it suffered from a lack of copy-editing. Authorship To conceal his identity, the author of the book decided to write under the pseudonym Marcantonio Colonna, an Italian nobleman who fought at the Battle of Lepanto. The author described himself as a historian who was educated at the University of Oxford, but is now living in Rome. \\"Colonna\\" said the reason he chose to keep his actual name private is due to the fear of retaliation, but expects to be \\"unmasked\\" by opponents eventually. He also said that Pope Francis has been shown a list of six people who they think could have been the author and that a person in England who had been misidentified \\"received threatening phone calls from Rome\\". Tess Livingstone of The Australian described in Rome a \\"frantic witch-hunt\\" to uncover the author. On 19 March 2018, the author was revealed to be Henry (H. J. A.) Sire, born in 1949 at Barcelona of French ancestry. According to The Tablet, Sire, a historian and member of the Knights of Malta, had lived in Rome at the Knights' Grand Magistry Palace on the Via dei Condotti from 2013 to 2017 while researching for his book The Knights of Malta: A Modern Resurrection, at the behest of Fra Matthew Festing, the former Prince & Grand Master. Sire had studied in England at Stonyhurst College (a Jesuit institution) and at Exeter College, Oxford, before establishing himself as a Catholic historian. After Sire was revealed to be the author, the leadership of the Knights of Malta, now under Fra Giacomo dalla Torre del Tempio di Sanguinetto, suspended Sire's membership and distanced themselves from his critique of Pope Francis. The Order later expelled Sire on November 19, 2018.  Editions in other languages  The Polish edition of The Dictator Pope (titled: Papież dyktator. Skrywana historia pontyfikatu papieża Franciszka) was to be released somehow in the middle of November 2018.

Educated at private schools, Samuel Pulliam then studied mathematics at Richmond College (later the University of Richmond) and at Charlottesville, ultimately graduating from the University of Virginia.

The online grave record from the Pulliam family cemetery near Beaverdam, Virginia (on the border between Hanover and Orange Counties) has no photograph and lists David M. Pulliam as dying in 1815. Virginia issued marriage certificates for David M. Pulliam to marry Lucy Ann Wright in Orange County, Virginia on October 10, 1838 and to marry Sarah Jane Clopton in Chesterfield Virginia on December 11, 1850. Samuel Pulliam married Kathleen Crenshaw, the youngest daughter of Lewis D. Crenshaw (1817-1875), who was a partner in the Haxall, Crenshaw and Co. flour mill in Richmond and whom Pulliam characterized as the last acting Commissary General of the Confederate States (although the pardon application forwarded by Governor Francis X. Pierpont during Congressional Reconstruction characterized his company as merely contracting to supply the Confederate stores). Lewis Crenshaw bought and remodeled the house that became the White House of the Confederacy shortly before the Civil War and sold it to the City of Richmond in 1861. They had a son Samuel Henry Pulliam Jr. (1894-1983). American Civil War In April 1862, Pulliam enlisted as a private in a light artillery company formed from southern Virginia and North Carolina volunteers by S. Taylor Martin. About three months later he was promoted to orderly sergeant of Martin's Battery, and in October 1863 was promoted to First Lieutenant and led the unit when Capt. Martin was absent. It was part of what was sometimes called the 12th Virginia Artillery Battalion, or Anderson's Corps Artillery and served around Richmond as well as in southeastern Virginia and North Carolina.Confederate Military History (1899) Vol. 3, p. 1128 available at https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Confederate_Military_History_-_1899_-_Volume_3.djvu/1206 Career After General Lee's surrender and his own discharge, Pulliam returned to Richmond and considered teaching. He used his mathematical abilities and became an agent for the Mutual Assurance Society of Virginia, initially assessing wartime claims in Norfolk and Petersburg. He also succeeded his father as Richmond's recorder and became active in the local Democratic Party. He was a member of the Democratic City Central Committee and also served four years on Richmond's city council. In 1875, Pulliam organized a fire insurance company that operated in Virginia and other states, but when that company closed he became a general insurance agent with an office in Richmond. Richmond voters elected Pulliam to the Virginia House of Delegates (a part-time position) in 1877, where he served one term (none of the four men serving with Pulliam were re-elected either).Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia's General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978) p. 527 He then returned to his real estate and insurance pursuits, and also became active in the Sons of the American Revolution. in 1900 serving as the Vice President of the Virginia chapter.

For Mexico to the Front), also known as Frente Ciudadano por México (Citizen Front for Mexico), Frente Amplio Democrático (Broad Democratic Front), or Frente Amplio Opositor (Broad Opposition Front)), was a big tent electoral alliance consisting of the centre-right National Action Party (PAN), as well as the centre-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) and Citizens' Movement (MC) to compete in the 2018 Mexican Federal Election.  History   Background  The loss of the National Action Party (PAN) in the 2012 Mexican general election, as well as the resignation of Andrés Manuel López Obrador from the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), created conditions for both parties to unite despite a rough encounter in the 2006 Mexican general election. During the local Mexican elections in some states of the republic, the PAN and the PRD came close to form a political alliance, such is the case of Baja California, Aguascalientes, Puebla, Oaxaca, Sinaloa, Durango, Veracruz, and Zacatecas.  Formation  On 4 September 2017 a political alliance named Citizen Front for Mexico (Frente Ciudadano por México) was announced, it is made of the National Action Party (PAN), the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), and the Citizens' Movement (MC). The political alliance would present a candidate in common across all of them in the 2018 Mexican Federal Election with the intent to defeat the competitive newly formed National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) and the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). According to the announcement of the coalition, \\"[it] is not the traditional party alliance but a broad front, something much more robust with academics, intellectuals, social organizations, and the citizens”, even some party leaders such as Dante Delgado Rannauro, the national coordinator of the Citizens' Movement (MC), have said the agreement would go further than the electoral process of winning. On 5 September 2017 the coalition was officially signed before the Mexican National Electoral Institute (INE). The integrated parties have not made it clear whether they would concur their alliance only for the Presidential Elections or if they'd present joint ballots for the election of deputies, senators, and local elections. Some members of the three parties have announced their refusal to such a measure and that they would not repeat such an alliance for the local elections, even though the core of the coalition was designed from the beginning to consider an alliance with national reach, and specifically designated possibility to allow separate candidacies in specific districts, or at the state level. On 8 December 2017 the coalition was registered with the Mexican National Electoral Institute (INE) as an electoral coalition denominated \\"Por México al Frente\\" (For Mexico to the Front), and the national Presidents of the National Action Party (PAN) and the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) resigned from their positions. The first, Ricardo Anaya, in order to seek the coalition's presidential nomination and Alejandra Barrales, of the PRD, to seek to nomination for the race to the Head of Government of Mexico City.  Exit of the PRD  On 28 August 2018, Ricardo Gallardo Juárez, the new parliamentary coordinator of the PRD, announced that the PRD was breaking away from the coalition, saying \\"We want to leave something very clear, this parliamentary faction will not seek alliances with the PAN or with Citizens' Movement.\\" Manuel Granados Covarrubias, federal president of the PRD, stated \\"Because our agendas in the legislative, in many points, in some parts, we do not coincide, but in another great majority we do coincide. Where we have agreements, surely we will go together, not only with the PAN and Citizens' Movement, with all the political parties where we find coincidence, in favor of Mexico, always for the interests of the Mexicans.\\" Election results Presidential elections {  !

The absorption of most of the original route into the Pukpu Line left the Unbong Line as a stretch from the junction point with the new line, located at Sangp'unggang, to the original terminus adjacent to the dam. This was transformed into a large freight-only yard, with the new Sinunbong station handling primarily passenger traffic.

Later that same year, Bishop included the poem in her book Geography III, which includes other works such as \\"In the Waiting Room\\" and \\"The Moose\\". It is considered to be one of the best villanelles in the English Language, and is compared to the works of W.H. Auden, Dylan Thomas, Matthew Hittinger, Theodor Roethke, Sylvia Plath, and more. The poem shares the title of a collection of Bishop's letters from 1928 to 1979, published as her autobiography in 1994. These letters were exchanged with many influential people in her life, such as her mentor at Vassar, Marianne Moore, and her longtime collaborator Robert Lowell. \\"One Art\\" is considered autobiographical by some. The poem was written in a period of separation from her partner, Alice Methfessel, and it was one of her final works; she died three years after it was published in 1979. Geography III and the poem within was met with positive critical reviews and awards; in 1976 and the years following, she received both the National Book Critics Circle Award and the \\"Books Abroad\\"/ Neusdadt International Prize for Literature and was elected into the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Background \\"One Art\\" recounts all the significant losses that Bishop had faced in her life, dating back to the death of her father when she was eight months old and the subsequent loss of her grieving mother, who was confined permanently a mental asylum when Bishop was five years old. Her move from Worcester, Massachusetts, to Nova Scotia was the first of many, as her health and upbringing were debated by members across her family. She used her father's inheritance money to travel to Key West, Florida. In 1951, she traveled to Brazil on a traveling fellowship from Bryn Mawr College, where she met Lota de Macedo Soares and remained there with her for nearly seventeen years until Soares committed suicide in 1967. Elizabeth Bishop In 1970, she accepted Robert Lowell's invitation to take over his teaching position for a few semesters at Harvard University, before her upcoming retirement. Bishop lived on campus in the Kirkland House, where she met the house secretary Alice Methfessel, twenty- seven at the time. Methfessel helped her adjust to her new life, and the two grew close very quickly, developing an intimate relationship. Bishop's life, and specifically her relationships with these women was kept under wraps. At one point, Bishop instructed Methfessel to destroy any evidence of their relationship, saying: \\"I am old-fashioned and believe in discretion and privacy\\". She would refer to Methfessel as her secretary or friend, and Methfessel was often mistaken for Bishop's caregiver.. Now in her sixties, Bishop's asthma had worsened and was paired with dysentery which weakened her immune system; teeth problems requiring many procedures and rheumatism made it painful and more difficult for her to walk or type. She wanted to keep up with her companion who was more than thirty years younger and began abusing Nembutal to sleep and Dexamyl to suppress her appetite and stabilize her mood. Methfessel not only oversaw her medications but helped keep Bishop organized and active in her daily activities and her career. Bishop and Methfessel traveled the globe together, and their relationship thrived for five years until Bishop's behaviors and alcoholism drove a wedge between them. In the spring of 1975, Methfessel had met someone else and was engaged to be married. However, the two did not cease corresponding. Methfessel was written into Bishop's will to inherit almost all of her wealth and property and was instructed to carry out an assisted suicide should Bishop's health deteriorate to a certain point. In October 1975, Bishop began writing \\"One Art.\\" Her first draft, \\"How to Lose Things,\\" \\"The Gift of Losing Things,\\" and \\"The Art of Losing Things\\" was a prose -heavy confessional depicting what she had lost and how it could be a lesson. The final draft \\"One Art\\" is a much more distanced and structured chronicle of the losses in her life which have taught her a lesson, and a very present loss she is facing and learning from. In the following year, the villanelle was published April 26, 1976, issue of The New Yorker as was her book Geography III, which was years in the making and satisfied the elegy she always intended to write. In the years to come, Bishop would find Methfessel again and spend her remaining years in her company until a brain aneurysm in 1979 that resulted in her death. Writing Bishop wrote seventeen drafts of the poem, with titles including \\"How to Lose Things,\\" \\"The Gift of Losing Things,\\" and \\"The Art of Losing Things\\". By the fifteenth draft, Bishop had chosen \\"One Art\\" as her title. The poem was written over the course of two weeks, an unusually short time for Bishop. Some of the piece is adapted from a longer poem, Elegy, that Bishop never completed or published.  Drafts  The poem changed in specific ways from the first to the final draft. Bishop's career was different from many of her colleagues, such as Robert Lowell, because she hated confessional poetry. \\"Besides they seldom have anything interesting to 'confess' anyway. Mostly they write about a lot of things which I should think were best left unsaid.\\" Keeping to her word, Bishop heavily revised the journal entry of a first draft to remove her voice and anything specific that would give her away. For example, \\"exceptionally / beautiful or dazzlingly intelligent person / (except for blue eyes),\\" changes to \\"(the joking voice, a gesture I love),\\" giving Bishop the distance she aimed for. When it was published in The New Yorker its publisher Howard Moss, responded that \\"One Art\\" was, \\"...upsetting and sad\\" and that Bishop had established, \\"...just the right amount of distance\\". Scholars have noted many features about the intentions behind the poem by analyzing the changing features in each consecutive draft, often using this analysis in their interpretation of the final poem from its drafts. In a conversation with film editor Walter Murch, Michael Ondaatje compared the creative writing process of \\"One Art\\", \\"In literature, even in something as intimate as a poem, those early drafts can be just as wayward and haphazard as the early stages of a film. Look at the gulf between the untidy, seemingly almost useless, the first draft of Elizabeth Bishop's 'One Art' and the remarkably tight and suggestive final version of her nineteen-line villanelle\\". Like editing a film, Bishop laid out a sequence of her thoughts and emotions and then came back and organized it into a villanelle like putting together a puzzle. In each draft to follow, she would get closer to reaching that form, with the structure, rhymes, and refrains as her edge pieces. After grappling with several drafts of this poem, Bishop said that this perfect villanelle finally just came to her. \\"I couldn't believe it -- it was like writing a letter.\\" Bishop made sure to include \\"One Art\\" in her book, Geography III, which she had been working on for some years. Content Bishop's life was marked by loss and instability, which is reflected in many of the poems of Geography III. \\"One Art\\" is narrated by a speaker who details losing small items, which gradually become more significant, moving from the misplacement of \\"door keys\\" to the loss of \\"two cities\\" where the speaker presumably lived, for example. The first stanza provides the poem's thesis; we are all going to lose things and get much better at it as we do. Find the silver lining in that, it is not a disaster. The word \\"intent\\" gives agency to powers that be, and the \\"so many things\\" which are going to be lost. The second stanza sums it up with the \\"practice makes perfect\\" theme, giving examples of every day, lifelong, broad, and shallow losses. These examples communicate that not only does everyone lose things, but everyone loses things all the time. The third stanza begins the chronicle of Elizabeth's losses in life, spiraling \\"farther\\" and \\"faster\\" towards the final stanza. \\"Places, and names, and where it was you meant to travel\\" represent the theme of regret in this poem. The fourth stanza is a unique moment for Bishop, where she uses \\"my\\" and speaks of specific and personal experiences that have taught her a lesson. The mother she speaks of here was estranged to Bishop at age five when she was permanently institutionalized, this \\"watch\\" may simply represent a keepsake she held which meant nothing to her, as she did not feel a strong connection with her mother. She was meant to write a critical response to Sylvia Plath's letters to her mother in 1975 but being unable to relate to the mother-daughter relationship Plath expresses, Bishop did not go further with her criticism of these, which she felt were superficial. The houses she has lost are from her childhood from moving around a lot and her relationship with Methfessel; the two were connected by their travels and the time they spent living together in paradises. Specifying her \\"next-to-last\\" house to indicate that her life is not over yet, this is significant because of her mental health and suicidal tendencies at this point in her life. The fifth stanza, and final tercet, relates back to the strong themes of traveling from her book, Geography III. A difference between the houses in the previous stanza, these cities, realms, rivers, and continents are a grander, \\"vaster\\" spectacle of her loss. Scholars have discovered the exact locations she is speaking of here. They are across the globe and in periods of her life of traveling, but emphasize the period when she lived in Brazil with her longtime love Lota de Macedo Soares, an heiress of a great estate, a \\"realm\\" in Brazil. \\"She had lost the three houses of 'One Art' in Key West, Petrópolis, and Ouro Prêto, she told David McCullough.\\" The final quatrain is the final mention of the subject of Bishop's present loss, and reveals that the purpose of writing the poem is personal healing and growth. Mentioned in the Writing section of this article, Bishop kept a balance between distancing herself from a poem written about her life, and the \\"joke voice\\" mentioned here is the sole physical trait of reference to Bishop's lost partner. The parentheses and slight description give an insight into what Bishop is thinking about while writing the poem. This is a crucial element of the stanza because of the next parenthetical pause which again expresses that \\"the art of losing's not too hard to master\\" (a moment when the refrain deviates from \\"the art of losing isn't hard to master\\"), Bishop interrupts the line to remind herself to \\"(Write it!)\\" and remind herself of the message which she is preaching. Form The poem is a villanelle, an originally French poetic form known for generally dealing with pastoral themes. Bishop is a known formalist in her poems, following the rules of a structure closely; though the final stanza ironically breaks from the format, and our expectations, using parenthesis, italics, an em-dash, and a deviation in the wording of the refrain. Brad Leithauser wrote of the poem that, in addition to \\"Do not go gentle into that good night\\" by Dylan Thomas, that it \\"...might have taken the elaborate stanzaic arrangement even if the Italians hadn't invented it three hundred years ago.\\" The ABA rhyme scheme \\"One Art\\" alternates between the \\"-er\\" and \\"-ent\\" ending sound, with the last stanza repeating the A sound, as is with the villanelle. The refrains, \\"The art of losing isn't hard to master\\", which varies in the eighteenth line, \\"the art of losing's not too hard to master\\". The villanelle has no set meter, but Bishop keeps a pattern of alternating eleven and ten-syllable lines, with predominantly iambic pentamer. In an interview with Elizabeth Spiresin 1978, Bishop said that her thoughts when writing \\"One Art\\" were always on villanelles. \\"I wanted to write a villanelle all my life but I never could. I'd start them but for some reason, I never could finish them.\\" You can see this intent when examining the original drafts where one can make out the skeleton of a villanelle; she chose her rhymes and refrains first and filled in the rest Brett Millier has assessed that \\"Bishop conceived the poem as a villanelle from the start, and the play of \\"twos\\" within it - two rivers, two cities, the lost lover means not being \\"two\\" anymore - suggests that a two- rhyme villanelle is a form appropriate to the content.\\"  Themes  Bishop instills one main theme in this poem, loss, which has consequences that form branching themes of learning, regret, and travel. = Loss = Nearly explicitly stated, Bishop writes to explore the theme of loss as she reflects on her losses. Using the villanelle form, Bishop emphasizes the inevitability of loss when she sets up a rigid structure, and then repeatedly breaks it, adding hyper-beats or eliding syllables, using half-rhymes, and an altered final refrain, to name a few. Loss is felt in this poem through Bishop's vague, but not so vague, examples of things everyone loses or can love; loss becomes a moment in the grander commentary on human existence which art pursues. This concept draws back to the title, loss is an art and the art of losing is learned through loss, engrained in every day life and present in the most important moments of our lives. This is exactly the progression that the poem follows, and it acts as a philosophical theory of life and loss, drawing examples from her life. = Learning = What satisfies and consoles Bishop in this process of writing, as well as losing, is that she is learning and enhancing a skill, the skill of loss. It is just as the saying goes, \\"practice makes perfect\\". This theme is almost an antithesis of the theme of regret, and is the main take away from this lesson on lessons of loss. The objectivity in the phrase, \\"The art of losing isn't hard to master\\", lends itself to the lesson Bishop is trying to convey; if a teacher used language that indicated bias, their entire lesson becomes compromised. The intricacies of teaching and learning are felt as deeply as loss, and Bishop's poem frames each of them as an art, the art of losing, and learning to lose. = Regret = Regret, more than remorse, is the general attitude and tone of this poem as Bishop recounts, or reminisces about her her losses. Regret is naturally an antagonist to learning and growing from experiences of failure, and it behaves similarly to the experiences Bishop mentions here. The line \\"I miss them, but it wasn't a disaster,\\" speaks strongly to this theme. = Travel = Traveling was a staple of importance to Bishop, and it inspired much of her writing before \\"One Art\\". Therefore, she promotes traveling in \\"One Art\\", even though it is a source of loss. She uses traveling as a theme here to promote a sense of carpe diem, seize the day, which relates back to repeated notions that everything is bound, or intended, to be lost that one should not shy away from anything for fear of losing it; losing it is not a disaster. Reception The poem was well received at the time of its publication by peers and fellow poets. In the next few years, Bishop would be awarded the Books Abroad / Neustadt International Prize in 1976, National Book Critics Circle Award in 1977, was elected into the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1976 for her past works and specifically her book, Geography III]. Brett Miller wrote that \\"One Art\\" \\"may be the best modern example of a villanelle...\\" along with Theodore Roethke's \\"The Waking\\".

She was the last nun in Sweden after the Swedish Reformation. Karin Johansdotter joined the Vadstena Abbey at an unknown year. She was still of childbearing age in 1605, and is thus likely to have joined the Vadstena Abbey during the reign of John III of Sweden or Sigismund III Wasa, when Sweden leaned toward a counter-reformation, and the Abbey was allowed to receive novices again: the last novice was accepted to the Abbey as late as 1593. In 1593, however, the Uppsala Synod proclaimed Lutheranism as state religion in Sweden, provoking a conflict between the Catholic king Sigismund and his Protestant uncle Duke Charles during the Swedish-Polish personal union, and initiating a development toward the War against Sigismund, resulting in the final completion of the Swedish Reformation. In 1594, following the Uppsala Synod, Duke Charles and Bishop Abraham Angermannus visited the Vadstena Abbey, ordering the closure of the Abbey and demanding that the nuns handing over the valuables and convert to Lutheranism, both of which they refused. The following year, in 1595, the Abbess Katarina Olofsdotter and some of the nuns left Vadstena Abbey for Söderköping before departing to the Marienbrunn Abbey in Danzig, which was a daughter-convent to Vadstena. The Vadstena Abbey was thereby closed, as the last Catholic convent in Sweden to be closed after the Reformation, completing the Suppression of the Monasteries. Contemporary documents list the members of the convent at the time of the closure in 1595, as well as what happened to them: except for the abbess Katarina Olsdotter herself, her deputy Elin Eriksdotter, as well as the sisters Ingrid Jansdotter, Ingrid Persdotter, Ingeborg Persdotter and Margaretha Mattsdotter was listed as having accompanied her to Danzig. Of the nuns listed as remaining in Sweden, three were listed as have been housed with private benefactors: Kerstin Persdotter \\"left with Lars Jönsson\\", Margreta Jacobsdotter \\"left with Jon Larsson\\" and Anna Larsdotter \\"left with Daniel Hansson\\". Of them, one was reportedly employed in the household of the Duchess Christina, while another one married a courtier of Duke Charles. Only two of the nuns were allowed to remain in the Abbey buildings after the closure of the convent: Ingegerd Månsdotter, who was listed as \\"old\\", and Karin Johansdotter, who was listed as \\"remaining\\" with her, evidently to take care of the elderly Ingegerd Månsdotter. They were allowed to remain in the building of the former convent with fourteen servants, who were to maintain the buildings and gardens for the crown, as the convent was now crown property. Ingegerd Månsdotter died during an unknown date. Karin Johansdotter officially employed as a gardener and caretaker of gardens of the former Abbey. After the death of Ingegerd Månsdotter, she was the only Catholic nun remaining in Sweden. In March 1605, Karin Johansdotter was charged with the theft of clothes and objects of brass and yin from the sealed stores of the Abbey, which was by then crown property. She pleaded guilty as charged, and confessed to have broken into the stores by climbing in through a window near the roof. This was a serious crime at the time, but Karin Johansdotter was evidently a popular person among the inhabitants of Vadstena, and a \\"Public petition\\" demanded that she be given a light sentence. As she was also the mother of an infant, the verdict was therefore mitigated to the loss of her employment and banishment from Vadstena and the province of Östergötland.

It has been recognized since 2009 by the Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies as a prodotto agroalimentare tradizionale (), abbreviated as PAT. Pecorino di Carmasciano was featured at Expo 2015 in Milan.  Place of origin  Carmasciano cheese is produced in the area known as Carmasciano, which is constituted by the towns of Guardia Lombardi, Rocca San Felice, and Frigento in the mountains of Alta Irpinia in the Italian Province of Avellino of the Campania region. The general area known as Carmasciano dates back to the Roman period and was documented by Virgil as the area between Guardia Lombardi and Rocca San Felice. \\"Carmasciano\\" was the name of a Roman soldier who was given the land by the Emperor for his success in war. The cheese may occasionally be made in Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi, Torella dei Lombardi, Villamania, and Morra de Sanctis. It is made from the unpasteurized milk of the Laticauda breed of sheep. The name Laticauda literally means \\"broad-tailed,\\" as the sheep is of the fat-tailed type. The Laticauda sheep are present only in the Campanian Apennines, with their numbers estimated to be around 50,000. For this reason, Carmasciano is produced only in limited quantities on small, family-owned farms and is expensive. A 2015 survey indicated that only five farms currently produce around 2000 wheels of Carmasciano each year.  Production  The characteristics of the cheese are influenced by the conditions of the sheep. In the Ansanto valley, the sheep graze on alfalfa and sainfoin herbs near a fumarole (sulfurous fissure). This fissure, known as Mefite, is named after the Samnite goddess Mefitis (hence also the English word \\"mephitic\\" meaning sulfurous). It is located within Rocca San Felice. The fumarole emits gaseous carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid, which is carried by the wind and influences the formation of the cheese. The wheels of Carmasciano are usually in diameter and in height, weighing . They are produced in cylindrical form. The unpasteurized milk is put into a tinned copper boiler called a \\"caccavo\\" that is placed over a wood-burning fire, where it is heated to . It is continually mixed with a ruotolo, a wooden utensil with a rounded tip. The cheese is then coagulated with rennet from lamb or calf and left to rest for 15 minutes. The curds are worked by hand and chopped to the size of a grain of rice and are left to settle on the bottom of the caccavo. The paste is left to rest for 48 hours, then collected and placed in a wicker basket and blanched in hot whey. Once dry, after 5 to 10 days, the cheese is salted, washed with wine, and massaged every other day with olive oil, white wine, and vinegar. Finally, the cheese matures on wooden boards in a cool room, where its rind is sprinkled with chili pepper to keep insects away. It is aged for at least 3 to 4 months, though sometimes it is aged for up to 24 months. Carmasciano is a hard cheese that has a brown, hard, wrinkled and unctuous rind. It has a medium to medium- high aroma and can become spicy, though is not typically pungent. It is a natural antioxidant. Carmasciano is eaten as a table cheese and is usually paired with red wine, and the most seasoned wheels are used to season pasta dishes.

An authority on engineering structural mechanics and computational mechanics, he served as President of the Dalian University of Technology (DUT) and was a founding member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). DUT's Lingxi Library, opened in 2009, is named after him.  Early life and education  On 16 July 1916, Qian was born in the town of Hongsheng (, now Hongshan Subdistrict) outside the city of Wuxi in Jiangsu, China. His father, Qian Bogui (), was the teacher of the celebrated historian Qian Mu (Ch'ien Mu), and his older brother Qian Linzhao (1906–1999) was also a distinguished physicist and a founding member of the CAS. After obtaining his bachelor's degree in civil engineering from Institut Technique Franc-Chinois de Shanghai (now part of the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology) in 1936, he won a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship to study at the Université libre de Bruxelles in Belgium. He received the degree of ' from the university in July 1938.  Career  The Lingxi Library of DUT, inaugurated in 2009, is named after Qian Lingxi. He returned to China in the fall of 1938, in the midst of the Second Sino-Japanese War. He participated in the design of the Yibin-Kunming and Sichuan-Yunnan railways, worked in the Bridge Design and Engineering Department of the Ministry of Communications, and taught at Yunnan University. In November 1943, be became professor of civil engineering at Zhejiang University, then exiled in Zunyi, Guizhou because Zhejiang was under Japanese occupation. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Qian became Chair of the Department of Civil Engineering of Zhejiang University in 1950. In January 1952, after repeated invitations from Qu Bochuan, President of Dalian Institute of Technology (now Dalian University of Technology or DUT), Qian agreed to move to Dalian to teach at DUT. He spent the rest of his career there, and succeeded Qu as the second president of the university. In 1955, he became one of the founding members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. During the Cultural Revolution, top experts including Qian Lingxi and Huang Xuhua were denounced as \\"reactionary academic authorities\\" and dismissed from their posts. When China's nuclear submarine project needed Qian's help to analyze its structural designs, its leader Chen Youming had to appeal directly to Premier Zhou Enlai to make him available to the strategic program.  Contributions   Research  Qian devoted himself to the research of engineering structural mechanics. He made important contributions in variation principles to limit analysis, computational mechanics and structural optimization. In 1950, Qian published his influential paper \\"Theory of Complementary Energy\\" in the journal Science in China. It led his student Hu Haichang to derive the Hu–Washizu principle in 1954. In the early 1960s, Qian and his student Zhong Wanxie published two papers in Science in China and Acta Mechanica Sinica, on the \\"general variational theory of limit analysis and plasticity\\". Their research was used in submarine design and was awarded national prizes. In the 1970s, Qian designed the main part of China's first modern petroleum port in Dalian. In the early 1980s, Qian, together with Zhong Wanxie and Cheng Gengdong, developed DDDU, an advanced computer system for structural design. DDDU was used in many major engineering projects.  Education  In 1951, Qian wrote two structural mechanics textbooks, which were widely used in Chinese universities and educated a generation of Chinese civil engineers. Qian is celebrated in China as a \\"Bo Le\\" for scientists. Six of his former students have become academicians: Pan Jiazheng, Hu Haichang, Cheng Gengdong, Zhong Wanxie, Qiu Dahong, and Yang Jinzong. Pan Jiazheng, who was Qian's student at Zhejiang University, almost dropped out of college because of poverty. When Qian learned about his situation, he paid for Pan's tuition and living expenses out of his own pocket until his graduation. Pan would later become one of the chief engineers of the Three Gorges Dam.  Death and legacy  Qian died on 20 April 2009 in Dalian, at the age of 92. Top Chinese leaders, including President Hu Jintao, former President Jiang Zemin, Premier Wen Jiabao, and former Premier Li Peng, paid their respects at his funeral. In the same year, DUT inaugurated its new library and named it Lingxi Library in his memory; it is one of the largest university libraries in Northeast China.

Der Weg einer Freiheit have toured extensively since formation, sharing stages with bands such as Wolves in the Throne Room, The Ocean and Heaven Shall Burn. The members originate from the deathcore musical style, but They supposedly identify with black metal, but also embrace other musical influences and lack some traditional features of the genre, such as Satanist lyrical themes.  History  Tobias Jaschinsky and Nikita Kamprad first met when they played together in the black metal band Frostgrim, which split up half a year after Jaschinsky joined it due to musical difficulties between the members. The two then formed the deathcore band Fuck Your Shadow from Behind, which existed from 2007 until 2010. In 2009, they started Der Weg einer Freiheit with Jaschinsky as vocalist and Kamprad on guitars and other instruments. That February they released their self-titled debut album, limited to 200 physical copies. They used a drumcomputer for recording drum lines. The album was re-released via Viva Hate Records in May 2010 after the songs were re-recorded with Christian Bass, who became the band's first drummer.Michael Bambas: CD-Review: Der Weg Einer Freiheit - Der Weg einer Freiheit (Re-Release). On July 1, 2011, Der Weg einer Freiheit released their first EP Agonie through Viva Hate. During the recording, Christian Bass left due to health issues to be replaced by Tobias Schuler. By this point, the band had toured with bands such as Despised Icon, The Black Dahlia Murder, Wolves in the Throne Room, Neaera and War From a Harlots Mouth. In 2011, they played at Barther Metal Open Air and Wolfszeit Festival alongside Skyforger, Finsterforst, Postmortem, Kromlek, Svartsot, Eisregen, Wolfchant, Equilibrium, Heidevolk, Varg and Watain. In 2012, the band released their second full- length album Unstille, performed at Extremefest in St. Pölten and Hünxe and toured alongside The Black Dahlia Murder and Darkest Hour. In October 2012, Jaschinsky left the band and Kamprad took over the role of lead vocalist. In March 2013 Der Weg einer Freiheit toured with Heretoir in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. That summer they played Ragnarök Festival and Summer Breeze. In 2014, they toured with The Ocean and appeared at With Full Force. In 2015, the band released their third album Stellar via Season of Mist and toured throughout Europe with fellow German band Downfall of Gaia. They played Hellfest and Graspop Metal Meeting the same year; their first US tour was canceled due to visa issues. In 2016, the band played their first European headlining tour and in the summer appeared at Wacken Open Air for the first time and was part of the Full Metal Cruise line-up. In August 2017 Sascha Rissling parted with the band to concentrate on other musical projects, and bassist Giuliano Barbieri followed in September. The band toured Europe with Portuguese band Moonspell as a trio, with pre-recorded basslines. After the tour, Der Weg einer Freiheit started recording their fourth album, which was released in late 2017 under the name Finisterre. The album peaked at No. 82 on the German Albums charts.Charts: Ger Returning from the studio, the band toured with Heaven Shall Burn. During this tour, Nico Ziska became new bass player of the band. The band performed with former member Nico Rausch on several summer festivals.  Musical style  Der Weg einer Freiheit are strongly influenced by the Swedish style of black metal. Their music has been compared with Agrypnie, their vocal style to that of Nocturno Culto of Darkthrone.Der Weg einer Freiheit - Der Weg einer Freiheit: Sputnikmusic Frontman and principal songwriter Nikita Kamprad named bands such as 1349, Orlog,Martin Baltrusch: Der Weg Einer Freiheit - Nicht Metallica oder Iron Maiden..., aber Muse!.

He also stated that he tries to follow a more progressive direction than that of his former band Frostgrim. The band's lyrics are written in German and focus on feelings of despair, memories, and the darker aspects of human society.Thomas Songer: Der Weg einer Freiheit. Kein Gejammer.

Described by writer Nick Spencer as \\"Runaways meets Lost,\\" the series focuses on six \\"brilliant but troubled\\" new recruits at Morning Glory Academy, a prestigious prep school hiding \\"sinister and deadly\\" secrets. Featuring interior art by Joe Eisma and cover art by Rodin Esquejo, the series was split into two twenty-five issue seasons and debuted in August 2010, concluding in March 2016. The series is currently on hiatus but Eisma has revealed that a third season is planned. Aside from the six titular characters, Morning Glories features a large ensemble cast of students, faculty, parents and others, with Eisma estimating that he had drawn 99 uniquely identifiable faces (excluding background characters) by the conclusion of the first season. Morning Glories The six titular students who are accepted to Morning Glory Academy in issue #1. The Glories act as the audience's introduction to the series. Casey Blevins A smart, beautiful, blonde student from Chicago, Illinois. Casey is the only one of the six protagonists who does not come from a broken home in some manner. Her parents loved her and gave her affection, especially her father, a former soldier, who taught the tomboyish Casey various survival skills including boxing and how to construct tear gas. When she enters Morning Glory Academy, her parents refuse to cut off contact with her and are murdered by the administration. After this Casey determines to resist and \\"burn this place to the ground.\\" She appears to be the most academically gifted of the students and shows a real flair for leadership, easily organizing her fellow inductees around her. She has so far been protected from official reprisal by orders of Morning Glory's mysterious Headmaster. \\"There's a very maternal aspect to Casey's character, a kind of 'beyond her years' thing in terms of responsibility that makes her want to hold this group together and make sure they're safe. At the same time, I think she's like a lot of those kids you see getting straight A's and doing all the right things, in that she may be pushing herself a bit too hard and taking on too much.\\" Zoe Zoe is an Indian-American student who embodies the stereotype of the popular and mean cheerleader. In her previous school, Zoe had numerous boyfriends all of whom believe that she loved them. Initially her concerns in Morning Glory Academy seem to be a continuation of her previous obsessions with cute boys and popularity. She expresses annoyance with the other students, particularly with the earnestness of Casey and the moodiness of Jade. With the boys, she is disdainful of Ike's crude pickup lines and disdainful of Hunter's lack of status. As the series progresses a darker, and more murderous side to Zoe is seen and it is hinted that she may have a deeper connection to the events at Morning Glory Academy. \\"She's not a bad person person, but she's someone who's gotten used to living in the rarified air that is being beautiful and smart. She's very driven and tends to view the people around her within the context of how much they can help her reach her goals - especially guys.\\" Hunter Hunter is the comic book loving, pop-culture savvy son of a single father. Seen by others as largely a non-entity, Hunter is not especially good looking or smart, and has a quirk where he is unable to read clocks or hear their alarms. Hunter can never seem to be on time when something important is happening. Early on he develops an attraction to Casey, but through various quirks of fate is unable to actually go on a date with her. \\"Hunter is like a lot of people who grew up in a broken home - he took to pop culture and his own imagination as a way of coping with the world around him. He's eternally well-intentioned and optimistic in ways that often come back around to bite him in the ass.\\" Ike Ike is a rich and entitled student from a privileged Manhattan background. As a teenager he was accused, but eventually acquitted of, murdering his father. A deceptive and manipulative delinquent, Ike claims to care only for himself and brags about his experience in challenging authority. He quickly falls out with the other students after he betrays them to the administration in order to gain more privileges. \\"He comes from a very privileged but strange upbringing and he's got a bad reputation. He's the ultimate opportunist and happily inhabits a very sinful, very troublesome life. He's a schemer.\\" Jun Fukayama A very serious student from Japan. In some ways the most straightforwardly heroic student, Jun befriends Hunter and quickly joins in Casey's plans against the school. It is eventually revealed that Jun has an identical twin brother Hisao, who has been a student at Morning Glory Academy for years and that Jun has infiltrated the school with the intent of rescuing his brother. It is later revealed that he is actually Hisao, and that Jun had taken his place before he was supposed to be taken to the academy. Jun had been sent to infiltrate Morning Glory Academy by a group opposed to the Academy's mission. Jun is one of several students sent to infiltrate the Academy, including his boyhood crush Guillaume. \\"He's a very serious, very direct person who isn't playing around. And yes, when he needs to, he can definitely kick your ass, so it's probably best not to put him in that position. There's a lot Jun isn't telling us. [...] He seems to know more about The Academy than they do.\\" Jade Ellsworth A young emo student from the Midwest. Raised by a single father, Jade was moody and emotional even before arriving at Morning Glory Academy. This was exacerbated when, shortly after arriving, her father claimed to not know who she was. Depressed, Jade attempts suicide and is put in the custody of the school nurse who performs a mysterious experiment on her. During this experiment, and during a subsequent suicide attempt, Jade has an out of body experience where she travels both to the past as well as to her own future, meeting an adult version of herself who is apparently involved with Morning Glory Academy in some way. \\"She's from a very traditional small town where everyone seems to think and act differently from her. [...] She's been through a lot in her life so far, a lot of personal tragedy, and it's certainly done a great deal to shape the way she looks at the people around her.\\" Faculty Though the dark forces at work behind the academy are still largely mysterious, a few villains have emerged: Miss Daramount Georgina Daramount is the main teacher who the students interact with. While on the surface she is a traditional strict schoolteacher she is actually a murderous and manipulative villain. Mister Gribbs Reginald Gribbs is the other primary teacher in the early issues of the book. He often acts as the muscle for Miss Daramount. He will sometimes engage in violence personally and often advocates a more direct and confrontational approach than Daramount does. Miss Dagney Susan Dagney is the elderly teacher who also acts as the school librarian. Dagney is arguably the Academy's first teacher, having raised Daramount and Hodge in place of their mothers. Nine The school nurse. Nine's job seems to consist mostly of conducting experiments on the living students and autopsies on dead ones. She is shown to be sadistic and greatly enjoys torturing the students she is supposed to be healing, something that puts her at odds with Hodge and Dagney. Nine is also tasked with looking for \\"special\\" children using methods that often result in long-term physical or mental damage. Nine has been working at the Academy since she was a young child as she is shown delivering a lethal injection to Hodge's mother shortly after she gives birth. After her ordeal in detention shortly after arriving at the Academy, Jade is taken to Nine's office. She escapes with the help of one of Nine's test subjects, Megan, but is eventually subdued by guards, allowing Nine to inject her. After completing her tests, Nine concludes that Jade is of no interest to the Headmaster and voices her desire to \\"crack her head open and see what comes pouring out\\". Her plan is thwarted when a guard brings an unconscious Hunter into her office, distracting her long enough for Hisao to remove his disguise, knock her out and escape with Jade. Later, Nine excitedly shows Hodge the corpses of four students (Amanda, Chad, Steve and Brendan) and specifically delights in the work of Brendan's killer David, whom she refers to as the schools \\"mascot\\". Flashbacks reveal that when Abraham's camp was destroyed, the children there were sent to Nine to receive her \\"curriculum\\". When the Truants first arrived at the Academy, it was Fortunato who ended up in Nine's office and that she and Daramount interrupted their attempt to rescue him. Nine then conducted her tests on him. They also show that Nine injected Akiko following her attempt to kill Daramount by blowing up her chalkboard. In issue #38, Gribbs orders Nine to inject Ike. Although willing to do it, she warns Gribbs that, should anything go wrong or the Headmaster take issue, she is not going to accept any responsibility for what happens. Miss Hodge The sister of Miss Daramount, Lara Hodge is the school guidance counselor and appears more supportive of, and loved by, the students. She claims to be a metaphorical prisoner of the school just as the students are literal prisoners and offers help to Casey in escaping. However, her proclaimed allegiance to the students may be a falsehood. Mr N. Mr N is a rarely-seen member of the faculty, due to his role as a teacher to students who need a more hands-on approach. He is briefly mentioned by Hunter and Fortunato in issue #28. After her failed revolution against the Academy, Irina is sent to Mr N by Daramount so that he can deliver her a \\"specialised curriculum\\" in order to change her behaviour and allow the Academy to reassert its control over her. When they first meet, Irina stabs Mr N in the hand with a fork and the two begin to fight, with N emerging the victor. He encourages Irina to talk about her past and gets her to reveal that she is Daramount's half-sister. In issue #46, Mr N offers to take Irina on a field trip where he can make use of her skills. Irina quickly determines that he wants her to assassinate someone which he confirms, saying that there are certain things members of the faculty are unable to do for fear of repercussions. N teleports them to Marrakech and reveals that his target is Zoe. The Headmaster Father to both Miss Hodge and Miss Daramount, the headmaster is the mysterious head of the school. The Truants A group of students loyal to Abraham, the Truants play a significant role in the latter half of the first season. Irina Guillaume Sorel Akiko Vanessa Richmond Fortunato Medeiros Ian Simon AV Club The A.V. Club are officially introduced in issue #31 when they recruit Hunter after he is able to read their poster which looks blank to the other students. They intend to expose the Academy by starting a secret newspaper. Ian and Akiko are also members of the A.V. Club but the others distance themselves from the rest of the Truants, preferring to use non-violent methods to achieve their goals. Maggie Maggie and Hunter meet during the Woodrun in Volume 3. Maggie is sent by her teammates to \\"capture\\" Hisao, forcing him to return to the Academy and leaving Hunter and Zoe with one less team member. She and Hunter seem to get on well together and they flirt before Maggie is called back to her team, who mock her for being attracted to Hunter. That night, Maggie is collecting firewood and is brutally stabbed to death by Zoe as revenge on Hunter who insulted her earlier in the day. Hunter is awoken by the noise and finds Maggie's body, which is collected by the faculty and taken to the morgue. A memorial service is held for Maggie and the other dead students in issue #31. When Hunter meets with the A.V. Club for the first time, he asks them how they knew to recruit him and Hannah reveals that, before she was killed, Maggie vouched for him and suggested he'd be a strong addition to the group. Andres Andres first meets Hunter in the library and helps him find a book that he saw in his dream. He is later revealed to be a member of the AV Club and enjoys wearing clothing that references popular culture such as Star Wars when he is with the Club. He attends Casey's election party and is beaten up by the guards after they disrupt it. Andres misses the debate between Casey and Isabel because he is working as the announcer for the Towerball final. Esi Esi was a friend of Maggie's who befriends Hunter based on her recommendation. She interrupts Hunter while he is in the woods expressing his regrets about not doing more to help Zoe. Initially startled, Esi tells Hunter not to worry, as reporting him for being outside after hours would also incriminate her. She asks him to follow her and introduces him to the rest of the AV Club. Hannah Hannah is a member of the AV Club who also works in the Academy library. She has a sarcastic personality and has a particular hatred of Irina. Hannah suffers from multiple sclerosis and uses crutches to get around, something that prevents her from being able to scout out the arrival of Dr Simon and Dr Richmond with the others. Students Aside from the Glories and the Truants, many other Morning Glory Academy students appear in the series. Pamela The roommate of Casey, Jade and Zoe, Pamela is the Resident Advisor of their floor. She is extremely excitable, unhinged and prone to violent mood swings, declaring the trio will be her \\"bestest friends\\" but later attempting to murder Jade by stabbing her bed. She is also the one who wakes up Casey and takes her down to the basement and gleefully tells her she won't have to worry about her parents anymore by showing her their dead bodies. Pamela and her team collect all of the flags and win the Woodrun, although it is revealed that she had to cut the ear off one of the members of her team in because he would not listen to her. She was also previously the roommate of Irina, Vanessa and Akiko, with Irina wishing Casey good luck after discovering she was roommates with Pamela. At Ike and Casey's election party, Casey finds Pamela hidden under a table where she informs Casey that she is secretly going to vote for her because she despises Isabel. She is also shown to be in charge of delivering the general announcements to the Academy. Brendan A student at the Academy, Brendan meets and becomes romantically involved with Vanessa shortly after she and the other Truants arrive at the Academy. When the Truants discover that Abraham has been captured by the faculty, they attempt to formulate a plan to rescue him and Vanessa recruits Brendan to help, much to the displeasure of the others who are wary of bringing in an outsider. Their plan fails and Brendan is killed by David. Upon her return to the Academy, Hodge inspects Brendan's body in Nine's office. Nine is particularly delighted with the corpse, applauding David's \\"work\\". When Vanessa is freed from solitary confinement, Hodge tells her that the nature of his death is \\"difficult to untangle\\". In return for a favour in the future, Hodge takes Vanessa to the shrine and allows her to go back in time to their last night together so that she can say goodbye to Brendan. Although confused by her sudden change of clothes and her emotional speech, Brendan admits that he loves Vanessa and the two share a kiss but Hodge erases his memory moments later so Vanessa's actions don't affect the timeline. When Dr Richmond arrives at the Academy, Hodge tells her about Brendan and explains that Vanessa is in a fragile state over his death. Amanda A student and head cheerleader at the Academy, Amanda invites Zoe to try out for the squad after finding out that she was a cheerleader at her old high school. Initially hesitant, Zoe eventually agrees to audition and meets Amanda and the other cheerleaders on the football field after house. Amanda explains to Zoe that the initiation will be composed of three questions, giving her a device that will tell if she is lying. Amanda asks her about her earliest memory (seeing her father kill her mother) and the worst thing she's ever done (killing a teacher and disposing of his body). When she asks the final question, \\"who is David?\\", Zoe refuses to answer and flees. Amanda reports her findings to Miss Daramount, who is pleased and tells her that, in return, the next curfew violation made by the cheerleaders will be overlooked. As soon as she leaves the office, Amanda is ambushed by Zoe and stabbed to death. Her body is taken to Nine's office where it is inspected by Hodge upon her return to the Academy. Chad Australian student Chad is introduced to Zoe by Amanda during her pitch to get Zoe to join the cheer squad. Hunter accidentally bumps into Chad and apologises. Chad is friendly, telling him not to worry and welcomes Hunter to the school. Later, when Hunter is on the way to his date with Casey, Chad and Steve threaten him. With the aid of Jun, they tie up Hunter, put a bag over his head and take him to the greenhouse. Hunter hears them mention seeing a new girl (presumably Zoe) followed by silence. When he is rescued by Hisao, Hunter sees that Chad and Steve were hanging from the ceiling with their guts sliced open and the phrase \\"all will be free\\" written in their blood. Chad's body is taken to Nine's office and it is inspected by Hodge upon her return to the Academy. Steve Steve is introduced to Zoe by Amanda when she is trying to convince her to join the cheer squad. He and Chad tie Hunter up on the way to his date with Casey and take him to the greenhouse with a bag over his head. Hunter hears them talk about seeing a \\"new girl\\" followed by silence. Both he and Chad are killed by Zoe. His body is taken to Nine's office and inspected by Hodge upon her return to the Academy. Isabel Traveiso A classmate who was Casey's academic rival at her old high school. Casey has a deep dislike of Isabel, with the two constantly competing to be first in their class. Isabel also asserts that Casey cheated in a previous science fair, causing her entry to win over Isabel's (this is later revealed that Casey actually did inadvertently cheat in order to beat Isabel at the science fair when Clarkson is asked to be the tie-breaker judge and naturally chooses Casey's project as the winner). They are both freshmen who were permitted to take Clarkson's AP physics class. Much to Casey's chagrin, her parents invite Isabel to her going away party when she is accepted to Morning Glory Academy. She gives Casey a blank farewell card and the two girls eventually admit their mutual hatred of one another. In issue #39, Isabel is revealed to have been a student at the Academy from a very young age who was planted in Casey's high school in order to give her someone to compete against. Much to Casey's surprise, Isabel is an overwhelmingly popular student, having been elected Class President even during the two years she was attending Casey's school. Hodge reveals that Isabel is one of the only students who has met the Headmaster. She is giving her re-election speech to the student body and is shocked when Casey interrupts and announces that she is running against her. Isabel is confident she will win unless Casey cheats somehow but welcomes the challenge. She crashes Ike's party but he calls the guards instantly, making the other students think she was responsible in an effort to cause her to lose voters. During the debate, Isabel gives academy-friendly responses to each of Dagney's questions and uses Casey's answers against her. When Casey reveals that the Academy killed her parents, Isabel also announces that they killed her parents too but that she chooses to honor their memory by following the rules and being the best student she can be. Thanks to Ike and Ian manipulating reality, Casey defeats Isabel and is elected Class President. Others Abraham Hisao Fukayama David Sarah Price Sarah was a high school friend of Zoe's who was on the cheer squad with her. While practising, they are interrupted by one of their teachers who chastises Sarah for being late handing in an assignment but promises he will not fail her if she can get it to him before the end of the day. When Zoe is passing his classroom, she hears screams and rushes in to find the teacher attempting to rape Sarah. Trying to protect her, Zoe hits the teacher over the head but his head strikes the desk as he falls, killing him. Sarah exclaims that they were in love and were \\"playing\\". Zoe forces Sarah to help her dispose of the body. Sarah shows immense guilt over the death of her lover and admits to Zoe that she is considering going to the police and confessing. Zoe tells her she can't because their lives will be ruined forever but Sarah seems certain that it is the right thing to do. A few days later, Sarah is found dead and it is strongly suggested that she was killed by Zoe. Julia Hayes Julia Hayes is a physicist. A Yale graduate, Julia works alongside her father and is instrumental in building the Cylinder. When it is activated for the first time, it kills everyone in the room aside from her father, although he later dies from his injuries in hospital. Responsible for twelve counts of negligent homicide, Julia flees to London and assumes a new identity. She is tracked down the future Jade (who is now in possession of the Cynlinder) and invites her to have a meeting but Julia wishes to be left alone until Jade tells her there are others pursuing her. Julia agrees to go to Jade's office and is invited to join her team. During a visit to the library with older Jade in issue #28, Hunter sees a photograph of Julie in a school yearbook and later searches for information on her with Andres. Dr. Ellen Richmond Dr. Richmond is Vanessa's mother and a teacher at Abraham's school. She worked alongside Dr. Simon in the lab that eventually resulted in the creation of his \\"son\\" Ian. Ellen is worried for her daughter's safety when Vanessa and the other truants leave for their mission to take down the Academy and gives Vanessa a special phone that was gives to her by Ms. Clarkson and will allow them to communicate. When Abraham's camp is attacked, she helps several of the students, including Hisao, escape. Once she and Dr. Simon are brought to Morning Glory Academy, she watches Vanessa through screens.

He was viscount of Narbonne 1071 until his death in the Holy Land in 1106.  Biography  Quite young when his father Viscount Bernard died, the first years of Aymeri take place in the shadow of his uncle, Pierre Bérenger, who asserted his hold on Narbonne both as viscount and as archbishop of Narbonne, despite the opposition of the pope and his legates. The government of Aymeri is especially marked by its clashes with the archbishops Dalmace of Narbonne and Bertrand of Montredon for the control of Narbonne. According to a missing charter referred to in later documents, in 1093 Aymeri I authorized a group of Benedictine monks to settle in the forest of Fontfroide, a modest starting point for what would later become the one of the most powerful monasteries in the region, Cistercian Abbey of Fontfroide. Leaving for the Holy Land around 1103, Viscount Aymeri I died soon after. His eldest son Aymeri II succeeded him.
