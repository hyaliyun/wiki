He was the son of wildlife artist Jacob Bates Abbott. He is the only artist to ever place both first and second in the same year in the Federal Duck Stamp contest. The Jackson Miles Abbott Wetland Refuge at Fort Belvoir in Fairfax, Virginia was named in his honor. ==Early life and military service== Jackson Miles Abbott was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1920. He was the son of wildlife painter Jacob Bates Abbott. As a youth, Abbott lived in New England and southern California. He came into birdwatching when he was six years old. He attended Swarthmore College for zoology. In 1941 he joined the United States Army and in 1942 he was stationed in the Caribbean. For two years he designed and engineered camouflage for the Army. He graduated from the Officer Candidate School in August, 1943. During World War II he earned a Bronze Star Medal. Post-war, he became an intelligence officer and a field manual writer. In 1949 he became a Technical Intelligence Specialist for the Army Map Service, working in Korea. In the United States Army Corps of Engineers he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. ==Birding and environmentalism== Upon joining the Army in 1941, Abbott started the Annual Christmas Bird Count at Fort Belvoir. The count has taken place yearly, as part of the Audubon Society. He lived and worked in Alexandria, Virginia, where he studied birds living on the Potomac River and the surrounding area. He focused on the American bald eagle in the upper Chesapeake Bay. With the bald eagle, he studied their nest eggs. After observations, if an egg didn't eventually hatch, the egg would be taken to a laboratory and tested for DDT exposure. He bird ringed 1,400 birds during a seven-month period as part of a migration study by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. In the early 1960s he produced a \\"bird hazard survey\\" at Reagan National Airport for the Civil Aeronautics Administration. Abbott also led land conservation efforts in the areas of northern Virginia. He helped conserve Huntley Meadows Park and Dyke Marsh. He also fought against the spreading of the hydrilla plant in Potomac watershed. As a writer on the subject of birds, he wrote a weekly column on birds for The Washington Star and published works about the birds of Fort Belvoir, bird attraction and the birds of Trinidad and Tobago. ==Art== Abbott learned to draw from his father. In 1951 he began publishing his artwork. He won the Federal Duck Stamp award in 1957–59 for his painting of common eider. That same year, he also came in second, for his painting of the pale-bellied brant goose. He is the only person to ever place first and second in the duck stamp contest. The common eider stamp was released on July 1, 1957, sold for $2 and sold over 2.35 million copies. In total, he created over 1,500 works in his lifetime. ==Death and legacy== Jackson M. Abbott Wetland Refuge He died on May 3, 1988, of cancer in Fairfax, Virginia. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. In 1989, the United States Army Corps of Engineers founded and named the Jackson Miles Abbott Wetland Refuge at Fort Belvoir after him. The refuge is a 150-acre tract.

He serves as the member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland for Traeger, having previously represented Mount Isa from 2012 to 2017. He is the leader of Katter's Australian Party, having taken over from his father, Bob Katter in February 2020. ==Biography== Early life Katter was born on 3 March 1977 in North Queensland. His father is Bob Katter, the federal member for Kennedy and founder of Katter's Australian Party, and his grandfather Bob Katter Sr. was also a federal MP. He received a Bachelor of Applied Science in Property Economics from the Queensland University of Technology. Career Katter started his career as a mine worker in Mount Isa. He won Mount Isa at the 2012 state election, pushing Labor incumbent Betty Kiernan into third place. He capitalised on his family's name recognition in the area. Mount Isa was virtually coextensive with the western portion of his father's federal seat of Kennedy, and much of the eastern portion of the seat was once part of the elder Katter's old state seat of Flinders. After his election to the Legislative Assembly, he became Queensland leader of his father's party, but on 29 November 2012, it was announced that he had been succeeded as leader by Ray Hopper, and would become the party's \\"parliamentary secretary\\". Following Hopper's defeat at the 2015 election, Katter once again became state leader. The state electorate of Mount Isa was abolished in 2017, and Katter followed most of his constituents into the new seat of Traeger. The new seat was essentially the northern, more urbanised portion of Katter's former seat, and is based on Mount Isa. The seat was created as a comfortably safe KAP seat, and Katter won it handily. He serves on the boards of the Laura Johnson Home, a retirement home, and the Southern Gulf Catchments, an environmental organisation. In February 2020, he was appointed leader of the Katter's Australian Party. ==References== - Category:1977 births Category:Australian people of Irish descent Category:Australian people of Lebanese descent Category:Australian monarchists Category:Katter's Australian Party politicians Category:Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly Category:Living people Category:21st-century Australian politicians ","title":"Robbie Katter"},{"id":"35211286","text":"Ahamus jianchuanensis is a species of moth of the family Hepialidae.

Most genera are found in the Indo-Australian region. While many of these moths are tiny, some members of the family grow to a wingspan of up to 66 mm, making them giants among the micromoths. The first recorded instance of a common name for these moths comes from Swainson's On the History and Natural Arrangement of Insects, 1840,Swainson, W., and Shuckard, W.E., 1840, On the History and Natural Arrangement of Insects. Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopedia. Longman, Orme, Brown, Green, & Longmans, London, pp. 106–107 where members of the genus Cryptophasa are described as hermit moths. This is an allusion to the caterpillar's habit of living alone in a purely residential burrow in a tree branch, to which it drags leaves at night, attaching them with silk to the entrance to the burrow and consuming the leaves as they dry out. The name 'timber moths' was coined by the Queensland naturalist Rowland Illidge in 1892, later published in 1895,Illidge, R., 1895: Xylorycts, or timber moths. Queensland Nat. Hist. Soc. Trans., 1, 29–34. and serves to distinguish these moths from other wood-boring Australian moths such as ghost moths (Hepialidae) and giant wood moths (Cossidae), which feed on sap or wood. It refers to the fact that the larvae of most members of this family are arboreal, whether they burrow into branches, bore into flower heads, tunnel under bark, or feed on lichens. Moths of the genus Maroga are pests of wattles (Acacia) and have crossed over from their wild host plant to become serious pests of cultivated stone fruit trees, particularly cherries. Formerly, Xyloryctidae were placed in the Oecophoridae as the subfamily Xyloryctinae.

She is known for her tragic love story involving a lesbian relationship with Felice Schragenheim. The story of the relationship between Schragenheim and Wust is portrayed in the 1999 film Aimée & Jaguar, and in a book of the same name by Erica Fischer (:de: Erica Fischer). She was declared Righteous Among the Nations on 31 August 1995 by Yad Vashem for her efforts to rescue Jewish women and shield them from Nazi persecution during World War II.\\"Wust, Elisabeth,\\" in \\"The Righteous Among the Nations.\\" Jerusalem, Israel: Yad Vashem, retrieved online 30 June 2018. == World War II and the rescue of Jewish women from Nazi persecution == Residing in Berlin-Schmargendorf with her four children and a housekeeper during the early 1940s while her husband was away at war, Elisabeth Wust was introduced by her housekeeper to a woman named Felice Schragenheim (alias Felice Schröder). After spending time with her and falling in love with her, Wust learned that Schragenheim was in need of protection from Nazi authorities due to her status as a member of the German Resistance and as a Jewish woman.Wust, Elisabeth. Righteous Among the Nations, Yad Vashem. Their courtship was traditional, according to Kate Connolly, the Berlin correspondent for The Guardian US at the time of her 2001 interview of Lilly Wust. After their introduction, Schragenheim \\"would come to tea at Lilly's almost daily, bringing flowers and poems. In between, the two would write to each other.\\" When Wust was hospitalized with dental sepsis in March 1943, Schragenheim \\"brought red roses every day.... On March 25, the two became 'engaged', signing written declarations of their love, which they sealed with a marriage contract three months later.\\"Connolly, Kate. \\"I still feel her breath.\\" New York, New York: The Guardian US, 29 June 2001. The couple had begun living together after Wust legally separated from her husband in 1942; they remained a couple until July 1944 when Schragenheim was reported to Nazi officials and captured by the Geheime Staatspolizei (Germany's Secret State Police unit known more commonly as the \\"Gestapo\\"). Arrested at the home she shared with Wust, Schragenheim was taken to the Schulstrasse transit camp in Berlin; held there until 4 September 1944, she was then deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in Czechoslovakia. Despite the danger, Wust made repeated visits to Schragenheim at Schulstrasse, and also attempted to arrange a visit with her at Theresienstadt, but was refused by the camp's commandant.Wust, Elisabeth. Righteous Among the Nations, Yad Vashem. Just over a month later, on 9 October 1944, Schragenheim was transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp after being sentenced to death. She is believed to have died on New Year's Eve (31 December 1944), according to Yad Vashem historians, who have stated that \\"Wust had only been able to escape punishment [for hiding Schragenheim in her home] because she was the mother of four young children whose father was missing in action.\\"Wust, Elisabeth. Righteous Among the Nations, Yad Vashem. Other historians have indicated that, sometime in December 1944, Schragenheim and others prisoners were sent by Auschwitz officials on a death march to the Gross-Rosen concentration camp and also possibly on a second death march to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Although her exact fate was never able to be determined, a Berlin court issued a ruling in 1948 which set her death date as 31 December 1944.Erica Fischer, Das kurze Leben der Jüdin Felice Schragenheim, Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag, 2002, . As a result of her involvement with Schragenheim, Elisabeth Wust faced increased scrutiny and harassment by Nazi officials, and was required to check in with local police every two days after Schragenheim's arrest, but this increased danger only strengthened Wust's resolve to shield other women at risk of a fate similar to that being experienced by Schragenheim. After meeting Lucie Friedländer, Katja Lazerstein, and Dr. Rosa Ohlendorf three weeks before Christmas in 1944, Wust then began hiding those three women in an upper level of her Berlin home. All three of the rescued women went on to survive the war; however, Friedländer, having been so badly traumatized by her experiences, ultimately committed suicide.Wust, Elisabeth. Righteous Among the Nations, Yad Vashem. == Death and interment == CC-by-SA 3.0). More than sixty years after the death of her beloved, Felice Schragenheim, Elisabeth Wust succumbed to complications from old age. Following her passing at the age of 92 on 31 March 2006, she was laid to rest at Dorfkirche Giesensdorf (the cemetery of the Giesensdorf village church), in Lichterfelde (Berlin), Germany. Her gravestone also serves as a memorial marker for Schragenheim.Barker, Tammy. \\"Charolette [sic Elisabeth 'Lilly' Wust (1913–2006)].\\" Medium.com: Retrieved online 30 June 2018.Eigenwerk. \\"File:Grabstein Lilly Wust.jpg\\" (photograph of the Wust-Schragenheim gravestone with location data).

The fighting occurred on August 27, 1776 during the Battle of Brooklyn, the largest battle of the American Revolutionary War. The Americans inflicted the largest number of casualties against the British troops on the slopes of Battle Hill.

Established in 1975, Virginia Garcia operates five medical clinics, five dental clinics, one women's clinic as well as six school-based health centers, and is based in Cornelius, Oregon. The organization was founded to provide medical care to migrant and farm workers and those with barriers to care. It was named after the daughter of migrant workers who died after failing to receive medical treatment for an infected cut on her foot. In 2016, Virginia Garcia had revenues of $60 million and served 45,000 patients. ==History== In 1975, Virginia Garcia, the six-year-old daughter of migrant workers, died of blood poisoning from a cut on her foot while living in a migrant camp in Washington County, Oregon. The death was seen as preventable and blamed on the lack of available medical care and the cultural and language barriers facing the primarily Spanish-speaking migrant laborers. Due to the death, the Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center was founded by a variety of people, including Jim Zaleski, with the support of St. Vincent Hospital (now Providence St. Vincent Medical Center) in Cornelius, Oregon. The clinic first opened on July 3, 1975, in a three-car garage in Cornelius. The center was originally a part of Centro Cultural, a Cornelius-based non-profit group focused on assisting the Hispanic population in Washington County. The Fred G. Meyer Memorial Trust gave Virginia Garcia grants in 1983 and 1985 for prenatal programs. In 1988, the trust gave the center $220,000 as part of the trust's Children at Risk program. Also in 1988, Jim Zaleski was honored by the Oregon Human Development Corporation with that organization's Golden Aztec award for service towards minorities. Then based in Cornelius, the single-clinic provided service to 6,000 people in 1987 on a budget of $800,000. In 1994, the organization expanded with a new clinic in McMinnville. By 1994 the annual budget had grown to $1.5 million and Mildred J. Lane was serving as the director. Due to the implementation of the Oregon Health Plan, the center was to face cuts of up to $250,000 annually, so local hospitals Tuality Community Hospital, St. Vincent Hospital and Medical Center, and Oregon Health Sciences University each donated equipment and employees to Virginia Garcia. Virginia Garcia added dental services to its offerings in April 1997 after opening two dental examination rooms. At that time they had also received about $500,000 in grants towards construction of a dental and vision services clinic to open in Cornelius. That clinic was designed by architecture firm Van Lom/Edwards and Scott Architecture. The organization had grown to 47 employees in 1999. Clinic in McMinnville Clinic in Hillsboro Wellness Center in Cornelius A foundation, the Virginia Garcia Memorial Foundation, was started in 2001 to assist in fund raising. The clinic started planning in 2001 to open a clinic in Hillsboro in a former juvenile home that had been operated by Washington County. The space was rented for $1 per year and renovations were paid for with a $320,000 grant from the federal government's Public Health Service. Clinic officials planned it as a temporary clinic until a larger space could be found. The clinic opened on West Main Street in March 2002, with expectations to serve 5,000 patients annually at the new location. Virginia Garcia received another federal grant in March of that year of $500,000 to be used towards a larger Hillsboro location. In March 2004, Virginia Garcia opened a new clinic in Beaverton after receiving an annual grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration in the amount of $759,500. The clinic at the Cedar Hills Crossing shopping center shared space with OHSU and also received $200,000 per year from Providence Health System. By 2005, Virginia Garcia had 65,000 patient visits a year across its four primary-care clinics, plus a dental and pharmacy office and a prenatal care clinic. In June 2005, the Beaverton clinic expanded when OHSU moved out of the shared building, and in August of that year construction began on a larger clinic in McMinnville. The organization moved the Hillsboro clinic to a new, larger location in October 2006. The new Hillsboro clinic on the ground floor of the Pacific University Health Professions Campus has of area for its primary healthcare clinic and a pharmacy. Also in 2006, the center received a $600,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to expand services to migrant and seasonal labor. By 2006, the clinics were up to 30,000 patients and had a budget of nearly $21 million annually, provided largely by federal grants, payments from the Oregon Health Plan, donations, and some payments from patients and insurance plans. The McMinnville clinic was replaced in October 2006 with an expanded facility near the Willamette Valley Medical Center. Diana Walker was hired as the center's new executive director in April 2007, replacing Liz MacDonell who resigned the previous year. Virginia Garcia opened a dental clinic in June 2007 in Hillsboro, the third dental clinic run by the organization. The organizations foundation received a $120,000 grant in 2008 from the Meyer Memorial Trust to help expand the clinics’ volunteer programs. In August 2008, employee Maria Loredo was presented a Healthcare Heroes Award by then Senator Gordon Smith in honor of Loredo's 30-years at Virginia Garcia. Also in 2008, the clinics began converting to electronic medical records, which was supported in part by a $250,000 grant from Kaiser Northwest. The organization announced plans in August 2009 to build a new complex in Cornelius in order to consolidate all the Cornelius clinics and provide administrative offices. At the time, plans by architecture firm Scott/Edwards called for a design that met LEED Gold standards with an opening as early as 2011. The organization received a $12 million grant from the federal government in October 2010 to help pay for construction on the new complex. The grant was part of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and Virginia Garcia hoped to open the new clinics in July 2012. In December 2009, the Portland Business Journal ranked Virginia Garcia as one of the top 15 non-profits in the Portland metropolitan area. At that time, the budget had grown to $23 million annually and the organization employed 300 people. The next year it was again named a top non-profit, ranking as the second highest health non-profit by the same newspaper. The organization's pharmacy group was recognized for their work on controlling diabetes by the Health Resources and Services Administration in October 2010. Construction on the Virginia Garcia Wellness Center began in 2011, and was completed in October 2012. For 2011, the clinics served 34,000 patients and had revenues of $27 million. ==Locations== The organization operates clinics in Cornelius, Beaverton, Hillsboro, and McMinnville, and Newberg.

She was born in Běstvina, but she lived and painted in the Bohemian city Pardubice, where she found inspiration for many of her paintings. Her artwork usually depicted flowers, but she also painted scenery, e.g. the forest Kaštanka. Despite the beauty of her work, Věra was often disappointed with herself; in her letter named Letter for Friends, she wrote: \\"I realise that many times, when I came home from exhibitions, and not just those of classical maestros, but even from those of my colleagues, I was full of admiration to them, but full of sadness and disappointment with myself. But after calming down, I always realised that to paint in your own style, not giving in to fashion trends and being yourself is very important and right.\\" Věra’s style was rather simplistic. With a few strokes, she was able to paint a whole tree branch and using a few shades, she drew leaves around it. Some of the backgrounds to her paintings with flowers are darker on the edges, proceeding to a lighter and brighter part around the flowers. Others have a different mix of light colours and shapes in the background. Her paintings of forests are less simplistic and are not too similar to any other artist’s style. Věra did not give names to her paintings, so they are more known by what they depict. For example, some of her nicest paintings are just known as \\"Sunflower\\" or \\"Yellow Rose.\\" In 1948, Vovsová was accepted into the circle of artists in Prague and in 1950, she became a member of the Czech Artists Union. The biggest honour was given to her, when she was accepted into the Artists Union (1990), which is a worldwide organisation. Věra Vovsová was married to a Czech composer, František Voves. Together, they sometimes made pictures for music and music for pictures, which never was a common practice. Věra Vovsová also made on order. Her most popular paintings were those of Kaštanka, which she could draw from her memory. She documented some of her most popular paintings in magazines, but these were not widely sold. == References == Category:1998 deaths Category:1912 births Category:20th-century Czech painters Category:Czech women painters Category:20th-century Czech women artists ","title":"Věra Vovsová"},{"id":"35212498","text":"Corporation Tax Act may refer to * Corporation Tax Act 2009, an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom * Corporation Tax Act 2010, an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom ","title":"Corporation Tax Act"},{"id":"35212520","text":"Vanessa Phuang Herrmann Muangkod (; ), nicknamed Na-Chatra (; ) or Van (; ) (born July 17, 1991 in Phuket, Thailand) is Miss Thailand World 2012.

BSA had established a motor-car department in an unsuccessful effort to make use of the Sparkbrook Birmingham factory. An independent part of the same site was occupied by The Lanchester Motor Company Limited. Sales were handled by BSA Cycles Limited. After 1912, manufacture was carried out by group subsidiary Daimler in Coventry or BSA Cycles in Birmingham. ==History== All-steel components of the 13.9 body 1912, upholstery above The first prototype car was produced in 1907. The following year, marketed under BSA Cycles Ltd, the company sold 150 automobiles and again began producing complete bicycles on its own account. By 1909, it was clear that the new motorcar department was unsuccessful, an investigation committee reporting to the BSA Board on the many failures of its management and their poor organization of production. Daimler Dudley Docker had joined the board in 1906 and was appointed deputy chairman of BSA in 1909. He had made a spectacular financial success of a merger of five large rolling-stock companies in 1902 and become the leader of the period's merger movement. Believing he could buy the missing management skills that could not be found within BSA, he started merger talks with The Daimler Company Limited of Coventry. Daimler and Rover were then the largest British car producers. Daimler was immensely profitable. After its capital reconstruction in 1904, Daimler's profits were 57% and 150% returns on invested capital in 1905 and 1906. The attraction for Daimler shareholders, was the apparent stability of BSA. So, in 1910, BSA purchased Daimler with BSA shares, but Docker, who negotiated the arrangements, either ignored or failed in his assessment of their consequences for the new combine. The combine was never adequately balanced or co-ordinated.Davenport-Hines R.P.T., 2002, Dudley Docker – The Life and Times of Trade Warrior , pages 49–50, Cambridge University Press, Docker retired as a BSA director in 1912 and installed Lincoln Chandler on the BSA board as his replacement. Docker liked to draw a comparison between the BSA~Daimler merger he engineered and that of his 1902 merger of Metropolitan Carriage Wagon & Finance Company and Patent Shaft. However, there was not the integration of facilities in the BSA~Daimler case, nor was there a reorganisation of either BSA or Daimler. In view of the earlier criticism contained in the 1909 report of the investigation committee, BSA continued to produce cars of their own, using Daimler engines. In 1913, Daimler employed 5,000 workers to manufacture 1,000 vehicles, an indication that things were not well.Davenport-Hines R.P.T., 2002 Dudley Docker – The Life and Times of a Trade Warrior , page 52, Cambridge University Press, 1935 magazine advert for the BSA range of motorcycles and 3-wheeler cars Inter- war years As well as the Daimler car range, BSA Cycles Ltd re-entered the car market under the BSA name in 1921, with a V-twin engined ten h.p. light car, followed by four-cylinder eleven h.p. and fourteen h.p. and six-cylinder twelve h.p. and sixteen h.p. models up to 1926, when the name was temporarily dropped. In 1929, a new range of 3- and 4-wheel cars appeared and production of these continued until 1936. By 1930, the BSA Group's primary activities were BSA motorcycles and Daimler vehicles.The Birmingham Small Arms Company The Times, Saturday, 1 November 1930; pg. 20; Issue 45659 Car production under the BSA name ceased in 1940, with the advent of the war. China's BSA brand ownership BSA brand ownership was disputed after Tata Motors purchased Jaguar Cars and Daimler Company. A legal challenge halted the creation of a Chinese BSA-badged car but the case only applied to cars, not other products, such as bikes.The brand for motorbikes was eventually bought by Mahindra. However the car brand remained with the Rover group, with the Lanchester company which was purchased by the BSA Group at the end of 1930. BSA, Daimler and Lanchester became part of Jaguar Cars in 1960. ==Timeline== Itala 25/35 TB2 Ten V-twin 3-wheeler 1930 example Ten 1185 cc 1933 example *1907 to 1914 various forms with capacities ranging from 2.5 to 4.2 litre, starting in 1907 with 18/23.Lord Montagu and David Burgess-Wise Daimler Century ; Stephens 1995 The larger cars were based on the 1907 Peking-Paris Itala. ** 1908 Three models: 14/18, 18/23, 25/33 all with four-cylinder engines ** 1910 additional 15/20 and 20/25 models—re-badged Daimlers second attempt *1910 (October) BSA group purchased with BSA group shares the Daimler business which would take over car manufacture. *1911 25/33 BSA car with Daimler engine, whole range is now 15/20, 20/25 and 25/33 *1912 Car production transferred to Coventry, range reduced to one model, 13.9 h.p. 2015 cc also (briefly) sold by Siddeley-Deasy with a different radiator shell as Stoneleigh.

Free zones may be broadly categorized as seaport free zones, airport free zones, and mainland free zones. Free-trade zone exemptions are: * 100% foreign ownership of the enterprise * 100% import and export tax exemptions * 100% repatriation of capital and profits * Corporate tax exemptions for up to 50 years * No personal income taxes * Assistance with labor recruitment, and additional support services, such as sponsorship and housing. Each Free Zone is designed around one or more business industry categories and only offers licenses to companies within those categories. An independent Free Zone Authority (FZA) governs each free zone, and is the agency responsible for issuing FTZ operating licenses and assisting companies with establishing their business in the FTZ. Investors can either register a new company in the form of a Free Zone Establishment (FZE) or simply establish a branch or representative office of their existing or parent company based within the UAE or abroad. An FZE is a limited liability company governed by the rules and regulations of the Free Zone in which it is established.

With Michal Češka, she has won four international medals and three national titles. The two have reached the final segment at three ISU Championships. Earlier in her career, she competed with Daryn Zhunussov for Kazakhstan. == Personal life == Cortney Mansour was born on December 15, 1994 in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. She became a Czech citizen in December 2017. Her aunt skated for the Ice Capades. == Early career == Mansour started learning to skate in 1996. In the 2011–12 season, she competed with Daryn Zhunussov for Kazakhstan. After starting the season in the junior ranks, Mansour/Zhunussov decided to move up to the senior level. In January, they placed last at the 2012 Four Continents Championships in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In March, they competed at the 2012 World Championships in Nice, France; their placement in the preliminary round, 20th, was insufficient to qualify for the short dance. == Partnership with Češka ==  2013–14 season  In 2013, Mansour teamed up with Michal Češka to compete for the Czech Republic, following a tryout in Europe. They were coached by Carol Lane, Jon Lane, and Juris Razgulajevs in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Making their international debut, Mansour/Češka placed 12th at a Junior Grand Prix (JGP) event in Gdańsk in September 2013 and tenth the following month at JGP Ostrava in the Czech Republic. The duo finished 13th at the 2014 World Junior Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria, after placing 14th in both segments.  2014–15 season: Senior debut  Mansour/Češka advanced to the senior level in the 2014–15 season. Competing in the Challenger Series, they placed ninth at the 2014 CS Nebelhorn Trophy and tenth at the 2014 CS Skate Canada Autumn Classic. Ranked 19th in the short dance and 15th in the free, they finished 17th at the 2015 European Championships in Stockholm, Sweden.  2015–16 season  Mansour/Češka placed sixth at two Challenger Series events in the first half of October, the 2015 CS Ondrej Nepela Trophy and 2015 CS Finlandia Trophy. Deciding to change coaches, they joined Igor Shpilband in Novi, Michigan at the end of the month. The duo won gold at the Pavel Roman Memorial and then finished 13th at the 2016 European Championships in Bratislava after placing 14th in the short and 13th in the free. Ranked 24th in the short, they did not qualify for the free dance at the 2016 World Championships.  2016–17 season: Grand Prix debut  In July 2016, Mansour/Češka received their first Grand Prix assignment, replacing Federica Testa / Lukas Csolley at the 2016 Trophée de France. == Programs ==  With Češka  {class= style=text-align:center !

One side of the street is an ordinary walk but on the east side these regular houses become extraordinary due to their panoramic views over the Pacific Ocean. Holman House is sited on the edge of a cliff on the edge of Dover Heights, providing a view across the ocean. The house cantilevers 6 m from this edge and at its furthest corner one is over the sea. Durbach explains: “We thought we will probably never have a site like this again. It was an opportunity to do something significant”. == Concept == Durbach and Block liked the idea of being able to look up and down the coast from many vantage points in the house, but to get to that point, designing the house became an adventure that completely took over their lives “but in a good way”. Tension within the design process arose when it took almost six months before they established a form for the house. Eventually, Durbach stumbled across Pablo Picasso's 'The Bather’ (1928), which became an inspiration for his design. The shapes of the kitchen and living room, which are cantilevered over the sea by four angled stilts, are derived this from the figure in this painting. == Architectural spaces == The mastery of space is seen in Holman House when spending time within the house. The extensive views of the sky and sea can be experienced. The view could get monotonous so the spaces are divided so that each view became individual from its vantage point. “You don’t have to see the view at every moment”, explains Block, which in turn, from a spatial perspective, gives a cinematic way of seeing the view. The kitchen is low and intimate and reveals itself slowly into the living area. There is no hallway because the horizon connects all the spaces and once in the living-dining room a massive curved masonry wall is bisected horizontally by a band of glass that frames the sea and cuts off most of the sky. Mirrors are placed at the corners to dissolve the edges as well as reflect unexpected expressions of the gardens and pool as one moves around. The more private spaces are revealed through a connecting secret passage which eventuates into the room with a striking blue backdrop. == Structure and materiality == The main overhang is supported by four steel inclined pillars which support the top floor. The ground floor is constructed with natural stone walls which becomes an extension of the cliff itself. These walls also in turn support the structure of reinforced concrete from the upper deck. The house appears monolithic as its white form sits upon the jagged coastline. The interior and exterior act as one single form; looking out of the house you are surrounded by a smooth white texture complemented by a sea of blue, looking onto the house from the exterior you are surrounded by a sea of blue complemented by a smooth white textured form. Internally, walls lead to floor-to-ceiling windows with views of the sea. Block says, “When the house is too smooth and perfect, it looks banal” and further refers to the term Wabi-sabi. The brick rendering in the living space for example contrasts with the smooth plastered wall opposite. ==References== * L.

Conrad – a portrait from April 1964Hans G. Conrad (*11 June 1926 in Remetschwil, Switzerland as Johann Gerold Konrad; † 26 December 2003 in Cologne, Germany) was a photographer and graphic designer in the 20th century. == Life and works == Hans G. Conrad's student identification card Hans G. Conrad grew up in modest circumstances and graduated from the so-called Werkschule of Brown, Boveri & Cie. in Baden, Switzerland. In the late 1940s he met the artist, architect, designer and publicist Max Bill in Zurich, Switzerland. Conrad worked for Bill, who, at that time, had been commissioned to design the Swiss Pavilion for the Milan Triennial IX in 1951. At that time, Conrad was also working for the Swiss architect and designer Alfred Roth (not to be confused with the German politician). Later, between 1952 and 1954, Conrad designed promotional advertising for the German-American furniture manufacturer Knoll International belonging to Florence Knoll and Hans Knoll. Hans G. Conrad (photo): Ulm School of Design (Hochschule für Gestaltung, HfG), Germany, 1955. Architect: Max Bill By way of Max Bill, who was one of the co- founders of the Ulm School of Design (Hochschule für Gestaltung, HfG) alongside Otl Aicher and Inge Scholl, Conrad relocated to Ulm during the HfG's founding period, most likely on 1 December 1952.Hans Wichmann: Mut zum Aufbruch. Erwin Braun 1921–1992. Prestel Publishers, Munich 1998, , page 277. He was the first student at the HfG: his student ID was valid from 1 January 1953, although classes did not officially start until 3 August 1953. Hans G. Conrad (Foto): Walter Gropius at the terrace of the Ulm School of Design during the building opening ceremonies, 1 October 1955 At first he studied product design and then visual communication. Conrad met his first wife, Eva- Maria Koch, who was also a student at the HfG, in Ulm. Otl Aicher and Conrad developed an exhibition system for the electrical appliance manufacturer Max Braun (company) that was used for the first time at the Deutsche Rundfunk- Phono- und Fernsehen Ausstellung (German Broadcasting, Phonograph and Television Exhibition) in Düsseldorf in 1955. In 1956, the combined phonograph-radio device Phonosuper Braun SK 4, later known as the Schneewittchensarg (Snow White's Casket), which is one of the most influential design developments of the 20th century (design: Hans Gugelot, Dieter Rams and Otl Aicher), was introduced in this design setting. He designed an exhibition bus for Braun as a final project, which was, however, never realized. Conrad worked as the head of trade fair and exhibition design at Braun from 1958 until 1962. Thereafter, he took over as head of worldwide advertising for Lufthansa. He engaged Otl Aicher and his design group E5 of the HfG in Ulm to develop a visual corporate design concept for Lufthansa. Otl Aicher's concept from 1962 is seen today as a milestone for the development of rationally derived corporate design concepts and is, in its most substantial and essential elements, still utilized today.

It is a Grade II* listed building, and sits on a hill above Monmouth overlooking the Wye Valley. The English meaning of the Welsh word argoed is 'by a wood'. ==History== In the 17th century the house was the home of the Proberts, local landowners and High Sheriffs of Monmouthshire. Richard Potter, Chairman of the Great Western Railway and father of Beatrice Webb, bought the house in 1865 and undertook extensive rebuilding. Beatrice Webb was a founder member of the Fabian Society and, in the later 19th and early 20th centuries, she entertained many prominent friends at the Argoed, including George Bernard Shaw. Shaw is rumoured to have written his plays The Man of Destiny and Mrs. Warren's Profession whilst staying at the house. In the 1980s, the Argoed was owned by Robert Plant of the rock band Led Zeppelin. ==Architecture== The architectural historian John Newman describes the Argoed as \\"a large, two-storeyed stone house (and) a tantalizing one.\\" The central block is original and irregular, its \\"windows all 18th century sashes.\\" Potter's re-building included a larger block to the south and a service wing to the north.

Sukaynah, Harun's eldest daughter, was also Qasim's full sister.. In his youth, Qasim was placed under the tutorship of the influential general Abd al-Malik ibn Salih. Thanks to Abd al-Malik's influence with Harun, Qasim was named as third in line of succession in 802 or 803, shortly after the so- called \\"Meccan documents\\" which established the precedence in succession of his elder brothers Muhammad (the Caliph al-Amin, r. 809–813) and Abdallah (the Caliph al-Ma'mun, r. 813–833). On this occasion, Qasim also received the honorific epithet (laqab) al-Mu'tamin (\\"the Trusted\\"), but Harun also stipulated that Abdallah could, once Caliph, alter the succession in favour of his own sons. In addition, Harun entrusted Qasim with the command over the frontier provinces with the Byzantine Empire (the al-Thughur wa-al-'Awasim), with his seat at Manbij.. In this capacity, in July-August 803, Qasim led a raid into Byzantine Asia Minor. He besieged the strategic fortress of Koron, while his lieutenant al-'Abbas ibn Ja'far ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath was dispatched to besiege another fortress, known to the Arabs as Sinan. The Byzantines, however, offered to release 320 Muslim prisoners if he departed, and he agreed.. In February 808, when Harun departed his residence Raqqa for his second expedition to Khurasan, he left Qasim behind as his deputy in Raqqa, with Khuzayma ibn Khazim as his advisor.. After Harun's death and the accession of al-Amin in 809, Qasim was confirmed in his position as governor of the al-'Awasim and of jund Qinnasrin, but was apparently removed from his governorship of the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia), where Khuzayma ibn Khazim was appointed instead.. Eventually, in 810, Qasim was removed by Amin from all his governorships in favour of Khuzayma, and brought to live under close supervision in Baghdad.. Amin shortly after forbade his mention in the prayers, along with Abdallah al-Ma'mun, who had risen in near-revolt in Khurasan.. In the civil war that followed, Ma'mun was triumphant, defeating and killing his brother Amin in 813. Immediately after, Qasim was formally deposed from his position as successor.. ==ReferencesSources== * * Category:8th-century births Category:9th-century deaths Category:Abbasids Category:Abbasid people of the Arab–Byzantine wars Category:Heirs apparent who never acceded Category:Generals of the Abbasid Caliphate Category:Harun al- Rashid Category:Abbasid governors of Qinnasrin Category:8th-century Arabs Category:9th-century Arabs ","title":"Al-Qasim ibn Harun al-Rashid"},{"id":"35213714","text":"Karchelia is a town of 7,000 people about 55 km southeast of Surat, Gujarat, India.

DeMille charged Ayn Rand - at the time, recently arrived from the Soviet Union - with writing a script for what would become Skyscraper. The original story, by Dudley Murphy, was about two construction workers involved in building a New York skyscraper who are rivals for a woman's love. Rand rewrote the story, transforming the rivals into architects. One of them, Howard Kane, was an idealist dedicated to his mission and erecting the skyscraper despite enormous obstacles. The film would have ended with Kane's throwing back his head in victory, standing atop the completed skyscraper. DeMille rejected Rand's script, and the completed film followed Murphy's original idea, but Rand's version contained elements she would later use in The Fountainhead. ==ReferencesCategory:1928 films Category:1928 drama films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:American silent feature films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Howard Higgin Category:Pathé Exchange films ","title":"Skyscraper (1928 film)"},{"id":"35213855","text":"Nanpura is a neighbourhood located in Sitamarhi district, Bihar state, India.

Barker (born May 7, 1961) is an American author, academic, businessman, and politician, who began serving as a Regent on the Board of Regents of the State of Iowa on May 1, 2019. A former economist for the Federal Reserve, Barker operates a real estate and finance company and is an Iowa Republican Party official. His academic research has been covered in print and broadcast media including Marketplace, As It Happens, The Economist, Time Magazine, and the New York Times. He has also written for U.S. News & World Report, the Christian Science Monitor, Collier's Magazine, and other publications. ==Early life and education== David Barker is a 6th generation Iowan. He graduated from Iowa City West High School, then received a B.A. from the University of California at Berkeley, and an M.A. and Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago. He also attended the London School of Economics during his junior year of college. ==Academic career== After completing graduate school Barker worked as an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, helping to develop an early warning system for failing banks and methods to detect racial discrimination in mortgage lending, as well as conducting analysis of the Basel Accord capital requirements. After moving back to Iowa in 1994, Barker taught real estate and corporate finance at the University of Iowa as an Adjunct Professor. In 1997 he began teaching Real Estate to MBAs at the University of Chicago, which he continued to do until 2007. Barker also taught Urban Economics to undergraduates at the University of Chicago for several years. He has also taught at CIMBA in Paderno del Grappa Italy. Barker's academic research covers a variety of topics, including real estate markets, urban economics, terrorism insurance, health economics, business ethics, economic history, and libertarian political economy. A 2009 paper on the effects of home ownership on children received widespread attention. It argued that previous academic work showing positive effects of home ownership on children’s test scores and behavior failed in adequately controlling for factors other than home ownership and that when they are taken into account, home ownership has no economically or statistically-significant effects. A paper analyzing the economics of the 1867 Alaska Purchase by the US from Russia argued that the financial returns to the federal government, tax revenue minus administrative costs, have been lower than alternative investments with similar risk. Barker is the author of Welcome to Free America, a book set in 2057 as a guide to immigrants coming to the former United States after the collapse of government. It describes a difficult period of transition, but eventually, private companies take over functions previously performed by governments, such as security, dispute resolution, production of money and infrastructure, and national defense. The result is a society that is different, in many ways, from today. Barker stated that he does not advocate the elimination of government and that his book is only an attempt to explore where libertarian ideas might lead. According to him, the result could be considered by different people to be a utopia or a dystopia. == Political activities == Barker was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016. He is also a member of the State Central Committee of the Republican Party of Iowa and was appointed to the Executive Council of the Empower Rural Iowa Initiative by Governor Kim Reynolds. ==Business activities== Barker's companies own over 2,000 apartments in the Midwestern United States, along with office buildings, self-storage facilities, and convenience stores. Barker is also President of Barker Financial, which makes commercial loans. Barker has also constructed new apartments. In 2017 and 2018 Barker completed historic renovation projects in Marion, Iowa, Fort Madison, Iowa, and Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and a $20.4 million purchase of apartments in Little Rock, Arkansas. ==References== Category:1961 births Category:American academics Category:Writers from Iowa City, Iowa Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:21st-century American businesspeople Category:Living people Category:Iowa City West High School alumni ","title":"David R.

Following the Armistice with Germany Pvt Calhoun temporarily frees a German Prisoner of War named Schmidt to go drinking with him. In the bar another Marine, Pvt Hanlon refuses to drink with a German; their brawl escalates into a fight with the Military Police where the three become friends. The German eventually migrates to the United States where he enlists in the Marines. The three Marines reunite in Vladivostok during the Siberian Intervention. The three meet a family of White Russians who have been impoverished by the Russian Revolution whose only source of wealth is a potash mine the family owns in Manchuria. The three Marines also meet an American mercenary named Captain Heckla who attempts to recruit the Marines in a scheme to trick the Russian father out of his mine and share the wealth. The Marines beat Heckla up with Tex marrying the White Russian's daughter Tanya. Heckla gets his revenge by leading a group of revolutionaries who execute several citizens of the town including the father and his son with Heckla tricking Tanya into coming with him. When Schmidt and Hanlon discover Heckla has taken over the mine they desert to investigate before telling Calhoun. Calhoun also deserts to go after Heckla and rescue Tanya. When he arrives, he finds Heckla already dead and Buddy having been mortally wounded after a mutual shoot-out. Tex finds Fuzzy in the next room, having been driven insane by continuous torture where water was dripped on him every few seconds. Tanya can't be found and Heckla refused to reveal what happened to her before he dies. The three make their way through the desert together, but Buddy dies in Tex's arms as they travel along the river back to their base. The military court is prepared to find Tex guilty for desertion and the murder of Buddy without any other evidence. Fuzzy, still insane, sees Tanya searching the streets. It restores his sanity and he calls out to her. Now with a witness, she corroborates the tale told by revealing Heckla took her deep into the desert. She escaped while he was drunk and spent many weeks ill in a village before coming to the city to find her husband. With the evidence presented, they find Tex not guilty of murder, and guilty of desertion with the punishment of being confined for one hour. Tanya tells her husband it was Fuzzy who called out to her and the three embrace as the picture ends. ==Cast== * William Boyd as Pvt William \\"Tex\\" Calhoun * Alan Hale as Pvt Otto \\"Fuzzy\\" Schmidt * Robert Armstrong as Pvt Joseph \\"Buddy\\" Hanlon * Fred Kohler as Captain Heckla * Diane Ellis as Tanya * Jimmy Aldine as Tanya's brother (as James Aldine) * Paul Weigel as Petrovitch * Jules Cowles as Cook * Wade Boteler as Gunnery Sergeant * Jack Richardson as Captain Brand * Joseph W.

The video won a Grammy Award for Video of the Year and became an iconic piece of the popular culture. In 1983, another music video collection was released, Twist of Fate. The music videos are from Two of a Kind soundtrack (\\"Take a Chance\\" is a duet with John Travolta, who appeared in the music video), starring Newton-John. The music video for \\"Twist of Fate\\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video. The Soul Kiss video was released in 1985 and features five music videos for the songs of the album of the same name. The last music video collection released by Newton-John, to date, is the musical-style Olivia Down Under. The video premiered in 1988 on HBO and in 1989 on home video, and features various songs from the album The Rumour, plus some unreleased songs. In the video, Olivia travels through Australia, celebrates the country bicentenary and shows more of the Australian culture. In 1998, Newton-John made a comeback to country music with the album Back with a Heart and recorded two music videos: one for the lead single, a re-recording of her 1975 hit \\"I Honestly Love You\\", and another for the song \\"Precious Love\\", to promote the album on Country Music Television. In 2011, the music video for \\"Magic\\" (Peach & Murphy remix) featured the biggest cast ever for an Australian music video, with over 300 people. Beyond the official releases, there are also several licensed home video releases by small distributors, with unreleased Newton-John material such as concerts, music videos and television specials. Examples of these releases are the DVDs 20th Century Masters: The Best of ONJ, A Million Lights Are Dancing: The Heartstrings Tour, Simply Olivia and Live in Japan 1976. ==Music videos== 1970s { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" width=98% - !scope=\\"col\\" width=3%Year !scope=\\"col\\" width=15% Music video !scope=\\"col\\" width=15% Director(s) !scope=\\"col\\" width=65% Notes - 1975 !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Follow Me\\"   - rowspan=\\"3\\"1976 !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Don't Stop Believin'\\"   - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Every Face Tells a Story\\"  Filmed at Newton- John's house in Malibu, California. - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Sam\\"  A live performance from The Midnight Special. - 1977 !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Making a Good Thing Better\\"  A live performance. - rowspan=\\"6\\"1978 !scope=\\"row\\"\\"You're the One That I Want\\" (with John Travolta) rowspan=\\"3\\"Randal Kleiser rowspan=\\"3\\"The music videos for \\"You're the One That I Want\\", \\"Summer Nights\\" and \\"Hopelessly Devoted to You\\" are excerpts from the film Grease. - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Summer Nights\\" (with John Travolta) - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Hopelessly Devoted to You\\" - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"A Little More Love\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"Alan Metter rowspan=\\"2\\"The music videos for \\"A Little More Love\\" and \\"Deeper Than the Night\\" were filmed at the same locations. - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Deeper Than the Night\\" - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"A Little More Love\\" (Live Version)  A live performance from the Totally Hot World Tour. - 1979 !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Totally Hot\\" Alan Metter Filmed at Century City, Los Angeles.

Its common host species include V. rufa in Europe, Japan, and East Siberia.V. austriaca wasps pollinate orchids. ==Taxonomy and phylogeny== Vespula austriaca is a member of the family Vespidae. The genera Vespula and Dolichovespula are thought to be closely related and are considered sister groups. Their similarities include absences of strong seta on third segment of labial palpus, smaller scutal lamella, and a characteristic twisted pedicel in embryonic nests. The Nearctic population formerly considered as belonging to austriaca has been recognized as a separate species, Vespula infernalis. ==Description and identification== This wasp is an obligate social parasite. As a result, it possess special morphological adaptations to take over host colonies. V. austriaca also has a wider interocular (space between the centers of rotation of the eyeballs) distance, longer mesonotum, longer forewing (anterior wings), longer gastrula tergum, and an overall larger front femur. The male abdomen is longer with thick lateral black bands while the female abdomen is wider with fewer lateral black bands and black dots. ==Distribution and habitat== Vespula austriaca is found in the Palearctic region, from Europe to Kamchatka, Japan and northwest China, Turkey, northern Pakistan and northern India. In Europe,V. austriaca is most common in Ireland and Scotland. As an obligate parasite, these wasps do not build their nests. As a result, the queens will hibernate longer than their host queens. This ensures that the nests will be ready when they leave their hibernation spots. ==Colony cycle== This wasp is known as a labour parasite. Their lifestyle depends on invading and usurping other colonies. First, females kill the queens of the host colony and force the host workers to care of their offspring.Yamane, S., Kubo T., (1970). A brief note on a labor-parasitic wasp, Vespula austriaca, in association with Vespula rufa schrencki. Kontyu 38(2):171–175. As an obligate parasite, Vespula austriaca wasps lack a worker caste and the ability to build their own nest. These wasps have very short seasons with flight periods from June to mid July and August to mid September. ==Parasitic behaviour== Vespula austriaca takes advantage of hosts such as Vespula rufa from East Siberia, Europe, and Honshû Japan. ==Diet== The larvae of Vespula austriaca obtain nutrients from insects and spiders brought to them by the host workers. ==Human importance== These wasps are not considered a pest. But one of its hosts, Vespula rufa is a pest because it frequently enters buildings. Considered a nuisance, one Vespula austriaca wasp was found in a shipping container. ==Reproduction== Vespula austriaca does not produce any workers. Instead the queens lay eggs that eventually produce more queens and male adults. ==References== Category:Hymenoptera of Asia Category:Hymenoptera of Europe Category:Vespidae Category:Insects described in 1799 ","title":"Vespula austriaca"},{"id":"35214043","text":"Gabi () was a female German shepherd who worked as a guard dog in the Belgrade Zoo, SR Serbia, SFR Yugoslavia. She became famous when she was attacked by a jaguar that escaped from its cage on 22 June 1987. ==History== In the 1980s an eight-year-old German Shepherd, Gabi, was adopted by the zoo and became an informal security guard. On the night of 22 June 1987, she was patrolling the zoo with guard Stanimir Stanić and a male German shepherd. In the darkness Stanić failed to notice a jaguar that had escaped from its cage. Gabi sensed the animal and jumped on it, while the other dog ran in fear from the large cat. Gabi fought the jaguar throughout the zoo, which allowed critical time for Stanić to telephone the police and for them to arrive. Gabi's actions prevented the jaguar's escape from the zoo and saved Stanimir Stanić from a possible attack. The police tried unsuccessfully to recapture the jaguar, and were eventually forced to shoot it to protect the public. Gabi was operated on at the Faculty of Veterinary Science at the University of Belgrade and nursed back to health by the zoo's director Vuk Bojović. She eventually fully recovered and continued working as a guard dog. Later, the zoo erected a monument to Gabi with the inscription: \\"Dog Gabi, her heart was stronger than a jaguar\\". ==References== Category:1987 in Yugoslavia Category:Culture in Belgrade Category:German shepherds Category:1980s in Belgrade Category:Individual animals in Serbia Category:Individual dogs Category:Monuments and memorials in Serbia Category:Sculptures in Serbia ","title":"Gabi (dog)"},{"id":"35214053","text":"Hububb is a Children's Television program broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom, it was named after Les Bubb who also played the title character with the same name.

The tests are produced by the UAE Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific research as part of NAPO (National Admissions and Placement Office) and administered in the three federal institutions. Around 17,000 grade 12 Emirati students take the tests each year. There are two CEPA exams. CEPA-English tests basic English proficiency, and CEPA-Math measures basic math skills. Both exams are administered in two formats: paper-based (with scanned answer sheets) and computer-based. ==Context== Zayed University, the Higher Colleges of Technology, and UAE University are primarily English-medium universities located in the United Arab Emirates. Each of these institutions has a foundations or academic bridge program designed to help students increase their level of English to the level required for higher education. CEPA scores indicate which, if any, level of English course is necessary. ==CEPA-English== CEPA-English was created in 2002 to place students into English foundations programs at the three federal institutions of higher education in the United Arab Emirates (Zayed University, the Higher Colleges of Technology, and UAE University), all of which are English-medium. It was designed to discriminate best at the average level of high school students in the UAE. The test takes two hours, in which test-takers complete 110 multiple choice questions and one essay. Test items are developed in conjunction with English teachers at the three institutions, in an effort to keep the content culturally relevant and compatible with local sensibilities. Grammar and Vocabulary CEPA-English tests English Grammar and Vocabulary proficiency using multiple-choice sentence-completion questions. There are 45 grammar questions, which cover a wide range of basic English structures. There are 40 vocabulary questions, testing the most common words of English, drawn from modified word lists, such as the General Service List, as well as academically-oriented words drawn from a modified Academic Word List. Reading The Reading Section of CEPA- English includes one visual, non-linear text (such as an advertisement) and two descriptive, narrative, or expository texts of about 400 words each. Vocabulary level is kept to approximately the first 2000 words. The questions on the Reading Section are all multiple-choice, and test students’ ability to identify the main idea of the text, find simple factual details, identify pronoun references, or make inferences about the text. Writing There is one task on the Writing Section of the exam. Typically, the test-taker is given a prompt eliciting an opinion about a general or local issue. The prompt is given in English and Arabic, and topics vary across versions. The recommended time for the Writing Section is about 30 minutes, in which the test-taker is expected to produce 150-200 words of original text. Scoring The multiple-choice section of CEPA-English is scored using IRT (Item Response Theory) three parameter modeling. Each test version is linked to previous versions, and new parameters are gathered during large administrations. The raw responses are scored using these parameters. A formula is then applied to convert the resulting numbers into CEPA scores, ranging from 90 to 210. The Writing Section is double-blind marked by local English teachers from the three federal institutions. The bands range from 0 (blank, no attempt) to 6. The scores are then mediated, employing multi- faceted Rasch measurement. Anomalous scores (e.g. from high rater disagreement) or jagged profiles are reviewed by the exam staff. Score Descriptors CEPA-English provides the following descriptors in its documentation. {  - ! CEPA MCQ Range !! Average Writing !! Descriptors !! CEFR Range -  90 - 139  0.62  Random  ≤A1 -  140 - 149  1.48  Extremely low English ability (Beginner)  A1 -  150 - 159  2.38  Low, at-risk  A1-A2 -  160 - 169  3.11  Emerging proficiency  A2-B1 -  170 - 179  3.73  Intermediate  B1-B2 -  180 - 210  4.48  May be ready for direct entry to English-medium tertiary study  B2-C1+ } ==CEPA-Math== CEPA-Math tests basic math skills including algebra, geometry and measurement, basic data analysis and number sense (e.g. scientific notation, order of operations, fractions/decimals and estimation). There are 50 questions on CEPA-Math. Like CEPA-English, the test is developed in conjunction with faculty members at the three federal institutions of higher education, and scored using IRT modeling. ==Test Use== Admissions and cut scores All cut scores and placement scores are determined by the three federal institutions of higher education themselves, with cooperation by CEPA staff. According to the website of Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research and the universities’ own websites, CEPA cut scores are as follows. {  - ! Institution !! CEPA-English !! CEPA-Math -  Higher Colleges of Technology  Entry to Foundations: ≥150 Direct Entry to Program: ≥180 (Writing Band Direct Entry to Program: ≥5)  Direct Entry to Program: ≥170 -  UAE University Entry to Foundations: ≥150 Direct Entry to Program: ≥185  Required (no minimum) -  Zayed University  Entry to Foundations: ≥150 Direct Entry to Program: ≥185  Required (no minimum) } Around 78% of test-takers score above 150, and are eligible for entry into one of the federal institutions. Around 16% achieved a score high enough to bypass foundation programs in 2012, in sharp contrast to the 3% who achieved this score in 2003, when the exam was first used. Other purposes In 2007, CEPA was used as an exit exam for high schools in the UAE Ministry of Education system. CEPA has also been used to identify trends in UAE education and as an indicator of school progress. In 2012, vocational schools such as the Abu Dhabi Vocational Education and Training Institute (ADVETI) began to have their applications processed by NAPO, which will include the use of CEPA scores. ==Test Preparation Materials== The CEPA office has periodically produced materials designed for independent study and test preparation. Among these are CEPA-Learn, a multiple-choice mobile phone app that used SMS to provide students with practice questions, and CEPA Challenge, a study book which has been freely distributed to all grade 12 students since 2008. ==ReferencesSee also== Official website (in English) Swann, Melanie (22 June 2012) \\"Hundreds of UAE students face college rejection\\" The National (Retrieved 22 June 2012) Category:Standardized tests Category:Higher education in the United Arab Emirates ","title":"Common Educational Proficiency Assessment"},{"id":"35214185","text":"Wuyanling National Nature Reserve () is a nature reserve in Taishun County, in the southern part of Zhejiang Province.

Around 7,000 fans packed Gaza's Yarmouk stadium, which was decked with Palestinian national flags.

The \\"historic match\\" eventually ended and was won by Ahli al-Khalil coached from Italian Stefano Cusin. The team of Hebron beat 2-1 Ittihad Shujaiyeh of Gaza, with the winning goal scored in the first minute of extra- time, on free kick, by Ahmad Maher. While Ahli Al-Khalil's small stadium was overflowing with fans, hundreds of thousands watched on television and bustling Gaza fell quiet as Shejaia supporters willed their team on from afar in cafes and restaurants. The club in this way has won the Supercup of Palestine and the right of access to the final stages of the Asian Cup.

He is known for his pioneering work, from the early 1970s onward, in high-speed nature photography. He was the first person ever to record pin sharp images of insects in flight. His work covers a wide variety of animals: from amphibians and birds to mammals and invertebrates. ==Life and work== Dalton was born in Surrey in 1937 and from a young age was an enthusiast for nature and photography. His father, a Royal Air Force officer, had been a bird photographer, and he had a godfather who collected butterflies, moths, and beetles. In the early 1960s he took a full-time photography diploma at London's Regent Street Polytechnic, about which he later recalled, \\"I had some of the happiest days of my life studying something I became fascinated by\\". Dalton's first published article was in Geographical, the magazine of the Royal Geographical Society. He went on to supply images to the Natural History Picture Agency (NHPA) run by the entomologist L. Hugh Newman, whom he had met one day while out chasing wildlife with his camera. Later, when Newman retired, Dalton bought the business, and his NHPA became the UK's premier nature photography library. Dalton sold the agency in 2006. Dalton started his work on insect photography in the early 1970s, before infrared beams or lasers, using a custom-made arrangement of lenses and mirrors, and a custom- made high-speed shutter. Working with an electronics specialist he devised a flash tube/capacitor combination which provided the required combination of high-power flash and extremely short flash duration. After two years of experimentation he was able for the first time to obtain sharp photographs of insects in flight. Dalton's first full-colour book, Borne on the Wind (1975) took nature photography into new realms, with photographs that showed for the first time insects captured in free flight. Dalton continues to live with his wife in the farmhouse in Sussex where most of his work has been done. His latest book, My Wood (2017) is a study of a wood he has owned since 1998. ==Critical reception== In 2015 the Society of German Wildlife Photographers (GDT) awarded Dalton the Fritz Steiniger Prize. The citation notes that \\"The results of his experiments in high-speed flash photography and his subsequent publications were landmark events in the world of photography and caused a great stir worldwide\\" and that \\"his work of fascinating intensity and striking beauty has set visual and artistic standards that are still valid today\\". One of Dalton's insect images was chosen to be carried on NASA's Voyager spacecraft, as part of a series of records designed to convey something of the science and culture of mankind to possible extraterrestrial beings. ==Bibliography== * 1967 Ants from Close-up (with L.

Despite that position, he is largely a forgotten figure now. Vitus Georg Tönnemann ==Biography== Tönnemann was born in 1659 in Höxter, the son of Heinrich Tönnemann, lawyer and adviser to the Prince-Bishop of Muster (von Galen). His nephew, Baron Christoph von Tönnemann, became an Imperial Court Judge in Wetzlar. Tönnemann was educated at the Jesuit Gymnasium in Paderborn, then studied Literae Humaniores for four years at the Paderborn University. On 7 December 1677 he entered the Jesuit Order, taking the name Vitus. As a novice he went to their college at Trier. He completed his theological studies at Munster University, receiving a doctorate in Philosophy summa cum laude (Latin honors). He then lectured at Paderborn as a professor of Philosophy and Theology. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1688, taking his final vows to the Society of Jesus in 1692. He was a Professor of Theology and Philosophy in Paderborn until 1692. At that time, the Society was locked in an inheritance dispute over the Buren estate, involving the Elector of Brandenburg, amongst others. The Jesuit Order dispatched Tonneman to Vienna in 1692, to represent their cause to Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. The Jesuits met with success, not least because Leopold I was greatly under their influence. Tönnemann soon became known at the Habsburg court for his legal expertise. This came to notice to Leopold I, and he appointed Tönnemann as a tutor to Joseph von Lothringen in 1701. . In 1705 Joseph I succeeded his father as the Holy Roman Emperor. The Archduke Charles - Leopold's younger son - had meanwhile been posted to Spain, as the claimant to the Spanish Crown (the War of the Spanish Succession). Tönnemann was appointed as his confessor in 1705. One of his tasks was to arrange a marriage for Charles. He travelled to Barcelona in order to negotiate the marriage of Princess Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick- Wolfenbüttel to Charles. The union was celebrated on 1 August 1708. The appointment was highly successful, with Tönnemann winning the trust of the young Archduke. After Joseph I died in 1711, Charles became the ruler of the Empire. Tönnemann returned with him to Vienna, remaining his adviser and confessor until his death in March 1740. Charles died six months later, holding the crucifix given to him by Tönnemann. Since politics and religion were linked in the Habsburg Empire, Tönnemann's duties were various. He was Chaplain-in-Chief of the Imperial Army. He was also a political adviser to Charles, with considerable influence, which is clear from the correspondence of the two men. The Roman Catholic Church and Habsburg Empire still needed each other - this alliance preserved the Habsburgs and defeated Protestantism in Central Europe. Charles VI is remembered for his Pragmatic Sanction - promulgated in 1724 - in which he stated that his daughter - Maria Theresia - was to succeed to the undivided inheritance in the event of his death without a male heir. She did indeed succeed her father and ruled for 40 years. Tönnemann's legal experience and access to the Emperor (and his daughter) is likely to have played a part in the negotiations with the German Princess. Tönnemann was directly involved in mediating in the Salzburg crisis of 1732, when the Archbishop of Salzburg decided to expel all Protestants from his territory as dissidents. This caused outrage in Protestant Europe, and embarrassment to the Emperor. Tönnemann's correspondence with the German Princes of the Empire, The Vatican and also with his own Society in Paderborn is preserved, but scattered in diverse archives. He was honoured with a state banquet at the Laxenburg Palace - unheard of for a commoner - to celebrate his Golden Jubilee as a priest in 1738. It was also unheard of for the Emperor to visit a commoner in person. But Charles visited the Jesuit residence where Tönnemann lay terminally ill in March 1740. Tönnemann was laid to rest in the Jesuit Crypt in Platz-am Hof, Vienna. Charles VI died in October that year. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * www.thonemann.org.uk Category:German Jesuits ","title":"Vitus Georg Tönnemann"},{"id":"35214364","text":"Tom Holmes (born 5 January 1990) is an English rugby union player for Nottingham RFC in the RFU Championship where he is club captain.

She was a defendant in the famous Poison Affair. Chapelain was a very successful fortune teller who had secured a fortune at her work. She had acquired her spouse, a former usher with a position as bureaucrat, and she also owned several buildings. In connection to the Poison Affair, she was implicated because she had formerly employed Françoise Filastre as a maid. Filastre was arrested upon her return from a trip to Auvergne (province) which had been paid for by Chapelin in December 1679. Chapelain was also connected to Louis de Vanens, to whom she had rented a house. Adam Lesage claimed that Chapelain made her fortune by manufacturing poisons and performing black magic in collaboration with a man by the name of Boucher, and Filastre claimed that she had on occasion supplied Chapelain with poison so that she could sell it, that Chapelain had commissioned her to help her form a pact with Satan, and that Chapelain also performed curses and other magical services for her clients. Filastre claimed, that it was Chapelain who had been commissioned by Madame de Montespan to place an assassin (Filastre) in the household of Angelique de Fontanges. Like many other involved with the Poison Affair, Magdelaine Chapelain never had a trial. She was imprisoned in perpetuity by a Lettre de cachet at Belle-Île-en-Mer.

After William ascended to the throne, Kruseman was commissioned to paint official portraits of the Royal Family, including six of the King. In 1839, along with the engraver André-Benoit Taurel (1794-1859) and Marinus Tétar van Elven (1803-1883), an architect, he became one of the founders of Arti et Amicitiae. In 1844, he was named a Ridder in the Order of the Netherlands Lion. He was married in 1826 and had seven children, including Jan Theodoor Kruseman, who became a noted landscape painter. In 1836, his nephew, the future theologian and poet Petrus Augustus de Génestet, came to live with his family after being orphaned. He created over 500 portraits, mostly of the nobility and wealthy burghers. His portraits are notable for their lack of idealization and attention to details of clothing. He had numerous successful students; among the best-known were David Bles, Moritz Calisch and Jozef Israëls. After his death, he was largely forgotten although, in the 1960s, a street in Rosmalen was named after him. From 2002 to 2003, a major retrospective was held at the Het Loo Palace and, in 2015, an exhibition featuring all the artists of the extended Kruseman family was held at the Stedelijk Museum Alkmaar. ==Selected portraits== File:Jan Adam Kruseman - Portrait of a Lady - Google Art Project.jpgPortrait of a Lady File:Ada van Holland in exil.jpgAda, Countess of Holland in Exile File:Regenten en regentessen van het leprozenhuis te Amsterdam, 1834-35 Rijksmuseum SK-C-1123.jpegRegents of the Amsterdam Leper Colony File:Jan Adam Kruseman William II King of the Netherlands 1840.jpgKing William II ==ReferencesFurther reading== * J.G.

(euphemistically rendered post-1959 as \\"family of an official\\") that consisted of nine sons and five daughters. He was recognized at age three as the third Chöden Tulku, i.e. as reincarnation of the previous Chöden Rinpoche, Losang Chöden (), a locally renowned yogi and abbot of Rong-po monastery who in turn had been one of the candidates for recognition as the 12th Dalai Lama, Trinley Gyatso. According to Geshe Tseten Gelek of Sera Jé—long time assistant to Kyabje Chöden Rinpoche—Rinpoche's third eldest brother, Geshe Thubten Yarphel () was a prolific scholar-practitioner and composed over fifty volumes of commentary on sutra and tantra and rose to local prominence especially as a teacher of the Kālacakra tradition before passing away in 1997. The second eldest brother was reportedly \\"able to recite the Buddhist scriptures without even seeing them\\".Tseten Gelek, Kyabje Choden Rinpoche himself displayed similar feats of accelerated memorization, supposedly retaining prayers and scriptures with minimal effort and in only a fraction of the time generally required. As a young child, the young reincarnate Lama displayed remarkable inclinations, such giving Dharma teachings in play, and imitating the administration of traditional Tibetan Medicine to other children. ==Education== Shortly after his recognition as the reincarnation of Chöden Rinpoche Lobsang Tulku, the previous abbot of Rong-po monastery, his uncle began tutoring the young lama. Kyabje Choden Rinpoche relates about this period: The meeting with Pabongkha Rinpoche reportedly left a lasting impression: When he was 15 years old, the young lama followed Pabongkha's counsel to enrol in Sera monastery and left his native Kham for the regional \\"college\\" allotted by geographical provenance, Lhopa Khangtsen, together with his brother, (Geshe) Thubten Yarphel. At Sera monastery, Rinpoche did extremely well, despite well-documented hardships, and relative poverty. Amongst the remarkable feats accomplished by the young aspirant was the memorization of \\"thousands of pages of philosophical texts, including the entire text Golden Garland of Elogquence by Tsongkhapa, a sprawling twelve- hundred-page commentary on the perfection of wisdom sutras. He consistently topped his class in debate and periodically attended teachings on lamrim and tantra by contemporary luminaries like Pari Rinpoche, Trijang Rinpoche, and Ling Rinpoche.\\". Rinpoche \\"was in the same class as Geshe Sopa Rinpoche, Geshe Ugyen Tseten and Geshe Legden for two or three years.\\". Although the chief pursuit at Sera monastery was the exoteric curriculum of Buddhist philosophy as transmitted via the (Five) Great Treatises (), Rinpoche \\"also studied auxiliary subjects like Sanskrit, poetry, and astrology with a private tutor in Lhasa\\". While enrolled in the Geshe Lharam class, ==Debating partner to the 14th Dalai Lama== Choden Rinpoche was chosen to serve as one of two debating- partners hailing from Sera monastery for the occasion of the XIVth Dalai Lama's public Geshe-examinations in 1959 () for the topics of the \\"Two Truths\\" (). Despite an interlude of many years, when reunited in exile, both the Dalai Lama and Kyabje Chöden Rinpoche remembered the episode with fondness and in detail—according to Rinpoche, the Dalai Lama displayed a nimble mind and remarkable acuity during the examinations. The fourteenth Dalai Lama, in turn recounted: ==1959 and its aftermath: in solitary retreat for 19 years (1965-1985)== Observing the restrictive political developments manifesting at the outset of the Cultural Revolution, Choden Rinpoche decided to withdraw from his public activities and the duties of a senior reincarnate Lama and instead to devote his time to extended solitary retreat. His motivation, he explained in early summer of 2000., was to practice the Buddhist meditation sincerely, and to realize, in practice, what he has learned in theory during his studies at Sera monastery: Choden Rinpoche incepted his solitary retreat phase with the practice of \\"Taking the Essence\\" (Chulen). This came to be in response to the local administrator's instruction to Rinpoche \\"if you can practice Dharma without having to rely on other people for food or clothing, then you can practice\\". Rinpoche described this initial phase in the following manner: Thereafter, Rinpoche, being forced to abort his Chulen practice by dint of governmental changes in policy, began to live in Lhasa until about 1964, \\"doing the main practices of Guhyasamaja, Yamantaka and Heruka, and giving some teachings where I could.\\" According to Geshe GyaltenNote that at the time of the writing of the article in the textbox of the Mandala Magazine July–August 2000, p. 66, Geshe Gyalten is listed by his lay name, Tseten Gelek. Choden Rinpoche was able to accomplish the feat of completing a retreat of 19 years despite the onset of the Cultural Revolution, lasting from 1965 until 1985 by living in a small room in Rinpoche's cousin's house \\"without coming out\\". Choden Rinpoche was able to do so by feigning to be an invalid: Displaying characteristic humility, Rinpoche recounted the period in the following manner ==1985: Teaching activity in India begins== Rinpoche travelled to India in 1985, where, upon consultation with the fourteenth Dalai Lama, he briefly taught in Nepal before settling down at the Lhopa Khangtsen \\"regional college\\" of Sera Jé Monastery in Bylakuppe, South India. Functioning primarily as instructor for philosophical debate, Rinpoche unabatedly persevered in his personal practice and study. During that time, ==1998: Teaching in the West== Rinpoche continued to emphasize practice and teaching after taking up teaching activities in the West at the behest of the Dalai Lama and Lama Zopa Rinpoche during the year of 1998. Though Rinpoche was much sought after as a traditional teacher, when the opportunity arose, Rinpoche fulfilled specific requests forwarded by his students to the best of His ability, such as granting ordination or visiting correctional facilities. From 1998--2013, Rinpoche dedicated most of the year to touring worldwide in order to impart the Dharma, and consistently returned to Sera monastery at the end of the year to give extensive public teachings to thousands of monks. ==Preservation of the Legacy== In 2010, Geshe Gyalten founded Awakening Vajra International (Visit Official website) at the request of his teacher as a network of internationally associated Dharma Centers in order to provide a platform for Kyabje Choden Rinpoche's teaching activities in the West. As of 2015, Awakening Vajra International, under the spiritual direction of Geshe Gyalten is entrusted with the preservation and cultivation of Kyabje Choden Rinpoche's legacy and life achievement. Note that there is also a dedicated Tibetan Language website, as well as a Vietnamese Language web presence associated with AVI. ==Final years and transition== Although Kyabje Choden Rinpoche's health was gradually waning from July 2014 C.E. onwards, Rinpoche steadfastly persisted in giving major teachings in Sera Jé monastery, and even attended the great Lam Rim teachings given by the Dalai Lama. A final meeting between the Dalai Lama and Rinpoche was arranged in Delhi on 29 August 2015, on November 3rd, 2015, the Dalai Lama composed a Despite Rinpoche's severe illness, there was not a single day in Rinpoche's life that he would miss a meditation or recitation commitment, and right until the day of Rinpoche's death, he was engaged with extensive prayers and rituals. Geshe Tenzin Namdak relates in an open letter: Jangtse Chöje Losang Tenzin Rinpoche presided over Rinpoche's cremation that was supported by a congregation of monks from Gyütö tantric college on September 15 at Lhopa Khangtsen of Sera Jé. On September 19, Gen Thubten Rinchen guided the process of opening the cremation stupa. Rinpoche's close students have captured these final days by way of a succinct audio-visual documentation. Rinpoche's final words, as transmitted by Geshe Gyalten Kunga and Geshe Tenzin Namdak, were \\"mainly it is important to remember the kindness of the Buddha and abide in that remembrance\\", and added a verse from Ārya Nāgārjuna's Five Stages of Guhyasamāja: In the final meeting between the fourteenth Dalai Lama and Choden Rinpoche, the Dalai Lama shared his impression that The transition and cremation ceremony, held in Sept. 2015 at Sera Jé Monastery in India has been in a short audio-visual contribution. ==Resources for his students == Before showing the aspect of passing away, Rinpoche advised his students to recite the prayer \\"Chanting the Names of Manjushri\\" and other prayers in preparation of his rebirth in a new reincarnation. Vietnamese students have produced a short Vietnamese language documentary of \\"H.E. Choden Rinpoche's holy relic tour in Vietnam\\", and an oral account of H.E. Choden Rinpoche's life, entitled life of a great Yogi - H.E.

It is a black and yellow wasp that is found in arboreal areas and builds its nests most often in decaying vegetation like logs, but has occasionally been found to build aerial nests.Buck, M., Marshall, S.A. and Cheung D.K.B. 2008. Identification Atlas of the Vespidae (Hymenoptera, Aculeata) of the northeastern Nearctic region. Canadian Journal of Arthropod Identification No. 5: 492 pp. (PDF version). Due to its preference for forests V. acadica does not normally come into contact with humans; however, when colonies are disturbed, workers of this yellowjacket may be quite aggressive and persistent and sting repeatedly.http://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Vespula+acadica == Taxonomy and phylogenetics == V. acadica belongs to the genus of Vespula which includes numerous species of social wasps. The wasps within the genus Vespula are found throughout the Northern Hemisphere and are commonly referred to as Yellow Jackets in North America. Vespula wasps are commonly mistaken for other genera, most often the paper wasps of the genus Polistes. V. acadica is considered to be a member of the Vespula rufa group and is most closely related to other members of the group, including Vespula consobrina and Vespula atropilosa. ==Description and identification== V. acadica is black with yellow markings and ranges from 10-15mm in length. The underside of its scape is yellow, rather than completely black. It is very similar in appearance to V. atropilosa but the apex of the middle black region of the second gastral segment is pointed; whereas it is rounded in V. atropilosa.http://academic.evergreen.edu/projects/ants/TESCBiota/kingdom/animalia/phylum/arthropoda/class/insecta/order/hymenoptera/family/Vespidae/Kweskin97/Vespula/acadica/acadica.htm ==Distribution and habitat== V. acadica is distributed throughout Boreal North America. Its range stretches from Alaska down the West Coast to southern California, and into the southwest United States. In the east it has a more northerly distribution through the Great Lakes, and also to the east coast as far south as the Carolinas. ==Colony cycle== The V. acadica colony consists of morphologically distinct queens and workers. They form annual nests which are governed by a single queen. Colony behavior in V. acadica closely resembles that of other members of the V. rufa group. Most colonies of V. acadica that have been observed are relatively small, containing 75-400 workers and 3-4 combs, and contain a nest with only one worker-rearing comb. Colonies are characterized by short duration, foraging of live prey only, and a flexible, loosely woven nest envelope. The seasonal cycle of V. acadica usually begins in mid-July, with the onset of reproductive rearing, and is completed in most areas by the last week of August or first week of September. V. acadica normally builds its nests in decaying vegetation such as logs or leaf piles but, although uncommon, aerial nests have been reported. The entrance tunnels are normally 15 to 25 cm, but can be as long as 40 cm. The deepest subterranean nest found was 15 cm under the surface. A nest is composed of one worker-producing comb and one to three reproductive-producing combs. The largest mature colony found had an adult population of 425 workers, 70 males, and 78 queens and had four combs with a total of 1,791 cells. Many nests play host to the parasitoid Ichneumonid Sphecophaga cocoons, probably S. vesparum burra and a few nests were found to host eggs of Fannia spp. on the exterior.Miller, C.D.F. 1961 Taxonomy and Distribution of Nearctic Vespula. The Canadian Entomologist Supplement 22 ==Behavior== Worker specialization Overall, a degree of plasticity is found within V. acadica’s behaviors. This allows for the individuals to shift between different activities depending on what is needed at a specific time by the colony. However, while these wasps are flexible with regard to roles, there is a noted tendency for workers to specialize in one specific task. These tendencies are referred to as flexible age polyethism and task fixation, and are common in many Vespinae and Polistinae wasps. The most dominant task witnessed in workers was inactivity, followed by trophallaxis, nursing, thermoregulation then defense and foraging, in that order. Nest sanitation Workers of V. acadica are not known to thoroughly remove feces from below the comb. This behavior is seen in many members of the Vespula rufa group. Workers occasionally will remove both liquid and solid feces, but in many cases the workers will consume the liquid feces but leave behind the solids. Occasionally, workers will feed the liquid to the larvae after drinking up the wastes. Sanitation behaviors are seen at a decreased rate during periods of colony decline. Mauling Mauling is an agonistic interaction that is often seen among workers in yellow jacket colonies. The mauler bites the dorsum of the thorax and gaster of the maulee. Ninety-seven percent of maulings last for 10 seconds or less, but some observed maulings were as long as 4 minutes. These interactions are mostly seen amongst older workers and occur throughout colony decline and up until total colony termination. These interactions between workers usually involve only one mauler at a time, but that same mauler often attacks multiple other workers that are nearby. These behaviors and their implications are still not fully understood by scientists. Mating behavior V. acadica males readily attempt to mate with the queens. Males approach the queens from the side and attempt to mount the dorsum of the queen's gaster. The queen often attempts to turn and face the male in order to bite him. The male continues to follow the queen, and mounts her while grasping her thorax with all 6 of his legs. He then curls his gaster under the abdomen of the queen in order to insert his genitalia. If the queen is unreceptive, she will curl her gaster toward her head to form a C-shape to prevent penetration and use her legs to dislodge the male. ==Kin selection== Genetic relatedness within colonies According to kin selection theory, relatedness is extremely important in reproductive behavior. This is because by favoring offspring that are close relatives, this individual can increase the likelihood of its genes being passed into the next generation. Like most Vespula wasps, V. acadica has high effective paternity(>2). This derived trait is the measure of queen mating frequency, and it also takes into account the use of sperm. Evidence indicates that the opportunity for multiple matings is present for V. acadica, even though the queens do not participate in these matings. Worker policing Although V. acadica workers are unable to mate, they are able to lay haploid eggs, which are destined to become males. This issue of male production often leads to conflict between workers and the queen. Because the effective paternity is >2, workers are more related to brothers (the queen’s sons) than to nephews (other workers’ sons) so the production of offspring by males are creating sons less related to the other workers than those produced by the queen. This leads to worker policing, an act carried out by workers to ensure there is little male production by workers. Various experiments of Vespula wasps have shown that absence of worker reproduction can most likely be attributed to worker policing. However, V. acadica is one of the few exceptions to the Vespula level generalization regarding worker policing. Worker ovary activation, worker laying, and overt queen-worker aggressions have been cited in members of the species as well as in other species within the Vespula rufa group. While these findings may indicate variation within Vespula species regarding conflict resolution and paternity, more research must be carried out in order to fully understand these implications. Queen aggression V. acadica queens are rarely aggressive towards workers. However in certain situations, queens have been consistently observed to behave in a more aggressive manner than usual. Often during oviposition or related activities, queens put on displays to make the workers avoid or back down from the queen. These most commonly occurred when a worker was trimming a cap remnant or antennating an emerging individual which is a behavior usually carried out by the queen. In most cases, workers will begin the process of cell inspection but then back down and allow the queen to finish trimming a cap and then to oviposit. Sex allocation The increased paternity seen in V. acadica leads to a lower relatedness between worker and their sisters, but not between workers and their brothers. These discrepancies are important in determining the allocation of resources made by workers to each sex. Estimates of sex ratios indicate that near equal numbers of males and females are produced. However, the queens are much larger in size than males which suggests sex allocation is biased towards females in a significant ratio. ==Interaction with other species== Diet V. acadica, like other members of the V. rufa group, rely on live arthropod prey as their main source of protein and collect natural carbohydrate sources. V. acadica workers are known to prey on live caterpillars, flies, and hemipterans. V. acadica wasps do not scavenge or forage on freshly killed insects. The diet of V. rufa group species contain less variety than those of the larger colony wasps like those in the V. vulgaris group. It has been suggested that V. acadica are not considered pests by humans because they exclusively hunt for live prey and do not scavenge from areas like garbage cans and picnic areas where they would most likely encounter humans. Parasites Social parasitism is a strategy in which one social species depends on a different social species to rear its offspring. This is a common occurrence in eusocial insects, including the genus Vespula. Vespula infernalis is a known obligate, permanent social parasite of V. acadica. V. infernalis use the host nest of V. acadica to raise its worker caste, resulting in a mixed colony of parasite and host workers. Eventually, the parasite queen will become the sole reproductive head, and her workers will outnumber the host workers, until the colony is exclusively made up of the parasitic species. During the queen nest stage, V. acadica queens are able to defend her nests from these parasites. Discoveries of dead queens in the entrance tunnels of colonies indicate that resident queens are very aggressive towards potential usurpers and are likely to kill in order to defend their colony. However, after worker emergence the queen was less vigorous in her defense of the nest, and parasites were more likely to successfully usurp the colony. Colonies are most likely to be usurped when there are 20–40 workers because the worker force is large enough to allow for a maximum output of parasite reproduction but not so large as to provide a strong defense against usurpation. Defense There are two significant aspects of defense witnessed in V. acadica that are different from nest defense practices in other Vespula wasps. Firstly, workers hover in a manner similar to workers of Vespula consobrina while defining the colony during excavations. Also, workers are known to take on an immobile stance on the envelope or the edges of the comb during substrate vibrations of the nest. ==References * http://www.biology.ualberta.ca/bsc/ejournal/bmc_05/88v_acadica.html Category:Vespidae Category:Insects described in 1918 Category:Hymenoptera of North America ","title":"Vespula acadica"},{"id":"35214544","text":"I'm Hip (Please Don't Tell My Father) is the debut album by American jazz guitarist John Pizzarelli. ==Reception== Writing two decades after the album's release, Scott Yanow of AllMusic commented that Pizzarelli \\"never had a strong voice, but his charm and likable personality usually overcame his vocal shortcomings\\".

He made 131 appearances across all competitions in his career at Tripoli. Panathinaikos On 23 December 2016, Kourbelis signed a 3.5-season contract with Greek club Panathinaikos and was officially announced by Athens club, on an annual fee of €250,000. The Greens will pay €500,000 to his former club during the next three seasons, along with a 25% next transfer percentage and some appearances and targets bonus, which could increase the cost of 23-year-old international's move to the team of manager Marinos Ouzounidis to €700,000. The Greek international quickly earned respect within the club and his quick transition from Asteras Tripolis to Panathinaikos, proved his ability to overcome new challenges. On 5 January 2017, he made his debut with the club playing as a starter in a 1–0 away loss against Platanias and ever since, Kourbelis has become an irreplaceable option in the Green’s squad. Although Kourbelis might not have the abilities of a ”game changing” player, he has managed to add quality to Panathinaikos’ game and become a backbone in the club’s roster. Last season, he showed great composure in important matches as one of his best games in the Green shirt was against rivals Olympiacos. After the sale of Zeca to Copenhagen, despite the fact that he had spent only 8 months with the club, he was appointed as the new captain for the 2017–18 season. On 13 January 2018, according to \\"Live Sport\\" athletic newspaper, Genoa is offering about €2 million to the financially struggling Greens, in order to secure the capture of 24-year-old international defensive midfielder and captain of the club in the January transfer window, without ignoring other German and Italian clubs that asked about the market value of the player. At the last week of the 2018 January transfer window, PAOK submitted a proposal to financial struggling Greens for the acquisition of the international midfielder. PAOK are offering Panathinaikos €1.5 million for Kourbelis, including the services of Ergys Kaçe, Giannis Mystakidis and Dimitris Konstantinidis for the second half of this season, but the player is reluctant for this transfer, besides the annual fee of €450,000. At the last day of the January transfer window, the administration of PAOK did not manage to reach an agreement with Kourbelis, while Sampdoria will try to capture Panathinaikos' captain. The 25-year old defensive midielder wants to compete in a team abroad with italian club eyeing his case. The Genova's team is willing to offer about €2 million for Kourbelis and news update is expected. Nevertheless, Panathinaikos maybe capture either Konstantinidis, Kaçe and Mystakidis regardless the Kourbelis future. Eventually, the captain of Panathinaikos will remain in the club for the rest of the season. On 3 February 2018, Kourbelis suffered an injury during the first half of home clash against Panetolikos He is expected to remain out of action for 3–4 weeks and his absence will definitely be a major blow for the plans of Panathinaikos' manager Marinos Ouzounidis. On 1 September 2018, he scored his first goal with the club in all competitions, with a penalty kick after 21-year-old winger Tasos Chatzigiovanis was fouled in the box by Lamia's goalscorer Daniel Adejo, sealing a 3–1 home win game. On 24 November 2018, Kourbelis scored as Tasos Chatzigiovanis squared the ball for the captain. His initial shot struck Apollon defender Klodian Gino, but the ball fell favorably for Kourbelis to score from the rebound, in a hammering 5–1 home win game against struggling Apollon Smyrnis. On 27 November 2019, he renew his contract with the club until the summer of 2023 for an undisclosed fee. On 22 January 2020, the Greek international defender let fly with an unstoppable shot from just outside the penalty area which left Balázs Megyeri no chance, in a hammering 3–0 home win game against Atromitos. On 1 July 2020, the Greece international midfielder made a vital interception before striding forward and beat Fabian Ehmann with four minutes to go to the interval, giving the lead in a 2-0 home win game against Aris. ==International career== On 9 June 2017, Kourbelis earned Michael Skibbe's first call to Greek National team as a result of his remarkable appearances to Panathinaikos. On the same match, he officially debuted in the Greek national team coming on as a late substitute in a 0–0 away draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifications. ==Career statistics== Club {   - ! rowspan=2  Club ! rowspan=2  Season ! colspan=3  League ! colspan=2  Cup ! colspan=2  Continental ! colspan=2  Total - !

On September 15, 1950, South Korean and United Nations troops, commanded by U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur, landed on Wolmido Island and retook Incheon before pushing onto Seoul. The landing turned the tides after the South Korean and UN forces had been pushed back to Busan early in the Korean War. Several hundred civilians were killed in the dropping of 93 napalm bombs. The battle was inspiration for the North Korean war film Wolmi Island produced in 1982. Additional on March 25, 2012 An Army base was established at the site of what became Wolmi Park (월미공원) after the base's relocation. The site was turned into a garden and opened to the public in 2001.

The building has won a series of awards since completion in 2010 and has also received a 6-Star Green Star accreditation. ==Site and Building History== Coca-Cola Place is built on the site of the former North Sydney telephone exchange. A previous developer had intended the site for a boutique hotel but was bankrupted before development began. Rice Daubney, who had been speculatively assessing the suitability of a variety of North Sydney properties for development recommended the site at 16-40 Mount Street to Investa in 2006 after changes to North Sydney Council’s planning controls allowed an increase in floor space ratio on the site. In order to gain council consent for the removal of the heritage listed telephone exchange building the developer made commitments to provide public space (a pocket park and forecourt), to ensure a three metre set back from the street and to incorporate public art into the building design. Construction began in late 2007 and the first occupants (Coca-Cola Amatil) moved in early in 2010. The estimated cost of the redevelopment of the site was $230 million. ==Architecture and Design== Coca-Cola Place was designed by the Australian architectural firm Rice Daubney. Though the building employs a classic podium and tower design the tilted facades, modest proportions and the open public forecourt at the entrance soften the transitions from ground to podium and from podium to tower while simultaneously giving the building its distinctive form. Writing in INDESIGN magazine Angela Ferguson described Coca-Cola Place as ‘the best thing to happen to North Sydney, architecturally speaking, in a long time’. The Property Council’s NSW Executive Director, Glenn Byres has said that Coca-Cola Place ‘is what design excellence is all about - it is daring, iconic and a true landmark for Sydney’ The building has side-core floorplates with the elevator shafts and structural cores located on the North side of the building which abuts the adjacent development in the lower floors. The southern facade is almost entirely glazed allowing full views of Sydney Harbour, including the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge, as well as Sydney's CBD. A restrained palette of materials has been used including off form concrete, recycled timber, steel and glazing. Rice Daubney’s Director of Design for the Project Paul Reidy has remarked that paint was not used as it ‘dematerialises the building’. In addition to the public artworks other elements of the former telephone exchange building were also incorporated into the architectural design of the building. Signage board, recycled from the exchange, was used as a strip detail in the elevator lobby. In late 2009, during construction of Coca-Cola Place, an unusual dust- storm struck Sydney and caused one alarmed North Sydney resident to call police and report that the building was falling into the street. When police arrived the builders assured them that the building facade was intended to look as it did but the police insisted on accessing the site and building documentation to verify all was as it should be. Coca-Cola Place was the first commercial high-rise in Australia to be designed and built with the use of building information modelling.The Rice Daubney-designed Ark-Coca-Cola Place is NSW Development of the Year Award Winner 19 May 2011.

A gigantic and distinctively Aboriginal painting by Freddie Tims dominates the forecourt and main entrance to the building. The work depicts Lissadell Station where Tims spent much of his early life. The main foyer is home to the collaborative work of sculptor Hany Armanious and Mary Teague as well as a shadow sculpture of metal letters by one of Rice Daubney’s Project Architects and Model-maker Simon Grimes. The Armanious/Teague work is entitled ‘Lines of Communication’ and, like Grimes’ work, uses materials retained from the demolition of the site’s former telephone exchange. ==Awards== The Ark has won 7 significant awards since the projects completion in 2010. *2011 - Rider Levett Bucknall Innovation and Excellence Awards - NSW Development of the Year *2011 - Rider Levett Bucknall Innovation and Excellence Awards - Best New Sustainable Development *2011 - AIA NSW Awards Commercial Building Commendation for Outstanding Architecture *2010 - Urban Taskforce Development Excellence Award - Development of the Year *2010 - NSW Excellence in Property Award (The Australian Property Industry) - The Environmental Development Award *2010 - New South Wales Excellence in Building and Construction Awards (Master Builder's Association) - Best Use of Glass *2010 - New South Wales Excellence in Building and Construction Awards (Master Builder's Association) - Energy Efficiency ==See also== *North Sydney, New South Wales *Coca-Cola ==References== Category:Skyscrapers in Sydney Category:Coca-Cola buildings and structures Category:Office buildings completed in 2010 Category:Office buildings in Sydney Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Australia ","title":"Coca-Cola Place"},{"id":"35214803","text":"James Albert Cross, (December 11, 1876 - March 1, 1952) was a lawyer and political figure in Saskatchewan.

The 2014 UEFA Europa League Final was played between Sevilla and Benfica at the Juventus Stadium in Turin, Italy, which was won by Sevilla on penalties, giving them a record-equalling third UEFA Cup/Europa League title. Chelsea were the title holders, but did not defend their title because they qualified for the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League and reached the knockout stage. ==Association team allocation== A total of 194 teams from 53 of the 54 UEFA member associations participated in the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League (the exception being Gibraltar, which should start participating in the 2014–15 season after being admitted as a UEFA member in May 2013). The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients is used to determine the number of participating teams for each association: *Associations 1–6 each have three teams qualify. *Associations 7–9 each have four teams qualify. *Associations 10–51 (except Liechtenstein) each have three teams qualify. *Associations 52–53 each have two teams qualify. * Liechtenstein has one team qualify (as it organises only a domestic cup and no domestic league). *The top three associations of the 2012–13 UEFA Respect Fair Play ranking each gain an additional berth. *Moreover, 33 teams eliminated from the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League are transferred to the Europa League.

When a place is vacated, it is redistributed within the national association by the following rules: *When the domestic cup winners (considered as the \\"highest-placed\\" qualifier within the national association with the latest starting round) also qualify for the Champions League, their Europa League place is vacated. As a result, either of the following teams qualify for the Europa League: **The domestic cup runners-up, provided they have not yet qualified for European competitions, qualify for the Europa League as the \\"lowest-placed\\" qualifier (with the earliest starting round), with the other Europa League qualifiers moved up one \\"place\\". **Otherwise, the highest-placed team in the league which have not yet qualified for European competitions qualify for the Europa League, with the Europa League qualifiers which finish above them in the league moved up one \\"place\\". *When the domestic cup winners also qualify for the Europa League through league position, their place through the league position is vacated. As a result, the highest-placed team in the league which have not yet qualified for European competitions qualify for the Europa League, with the Europa League qualifiers which finish above them in the league moved up one \\"place\\" if possible. *For associations where a Europa League place is reserved for the League Cup winners, they always qualify for the Europa League as the \\"lowest-placed\\" qualifier (or as the second \\"lowest- placed\\" qualifier in cases where the cup runners-up qualify as stated above). If the League Cup winners have already qualified for European competitions through other methods, this reserved Europa League place is taken by the highest-placed league team in the league which have not yet qualified for European competitions. *A Fair Play place is taken by the highest-ranked team in the domestic Fair Play table which have not yet qualified for European competitions.

Teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. First qualifying round The draws for the first and second qualifying rounds were held on 24 June 2013. The first legs were played on 2, 3 and 4 July, and the second legs were played on 9, 10 and 11 July 2013. Inter Turku lodged a protest after losing the second leg to Víkingur Gøta, and two match officials were later banned for life by UEFA for attempted match-fixing. ;Notes Second qualifying round The first legs were played on 16 and 18 July, and the second legs were played on 25 July 2013. ;Notes Third qualifying round The draw for the third qualifying round was held on 19 July 2013. The first legs were played on 1 August, and the second legs were played on 8 August 2013. ==Play-off round== The draw for the play-off round was held on 9 August 2013. The first legs were played on 22 August, and the second legs were played on 29 August 2013. ;Notes ==Group stage== The draw for the group stage was held in Monaco on 30 August 2013. Prior to the draw, the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld UEFA's ban on Fenerbahce (which lost in the Champions League play-off round) and Beşiktaş, meaning the two clubs were banned from the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League. UEFA decided to replace Beşiktaş in the Europa League group stage with Tromsø, who were eliminated by Beşiktaş in the play-off round, while a draw was held to select a team to replace Fenerbahçe among the teams eliminated in the play-off round, and was won by APOEL. The 48 teams were allocated into four pots based on their 2013 UEFA club coefficients. They were drawn into twelve groups of four, with the restriction that teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. In each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The matchdays were 19 September, 3 October, 24 October, 7 November, 28 November, and 12 December 2013. The group winners and runners-up advanced to the round of 32, where they were joined by the 8 third-placed teams from the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage. * For tiebreakers if two or more teams are equal on points, see 2013–14 UEFA Europa League group stage#Tiebreakers Group A Group B Group C Group D Group E Group F Group G Group H Group I Group J Group K Group L ==Knockout phase== In the knockout phase, teams played against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final. The mechanism of the draws for each round was as follows: *In the draw for the round of 32, the twelve group winners and the four third-placed teams from the Champions League group stage with the better group records were seeded, and the twelve group runners-up and the other four third-placed teams from the Champions League group stage were unseeded. The seeded teams were drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same group or the same association could not be drawn against each other. *In the draws for the round of 16 onwards, there were no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association could be drawn against each other. Bracket Round of 32 The draw for the round of 32 and round of 16 was held on 16 December 2013. The first legs were played on 20 February, and the second legs were played on 27 February 2014. Round of 16 The first legs were played on 13 March, and the second legs were played on 20 March 2014. Quarter-finals The draw for the quarter-finals was held on 21 March 2014. The first legs were played on 3 April, and the second legs were played on 10 April 2014. Semi- finals The draw for the semi-finals and final (to determine the \\"home\\" team for administrative purposes) was held on 11 April 2014. The first legs were played on 24 April, and the second legs were played on 1 May 2014. Final ==Statistics== Statistics exclude qualifying rounds and play-off round.

He is the author of several books, including Introduction to Afro-American Studies, The African American Experience in Cyberspace, and Malcolm X for Beginners. He curates two websites related to African-American history, \\"Malcolm X: A Research Site\\" and \\"eBlack Studies\\". Alkalimat is the great-greatgrandson of Free Frank McWorter.Hughes, Clyde, \\"Digging into history: UT professor's ancestor started free town\\", Toledo Blade, October 30, 2005. ==Biography== Alkalimat lived with his family in Chicago's Frances Cabrini Houses until 1953, when they moved to the city's West Side. In a 2003 interview, Alkalimat remembered his childhood in public housing: > Though I remember ... people outside the project saying, \\"Ah, you're living > on welfare, kinda.\\" But I think I had a childhood second to none. I remember > those years as golden years, frankly. I cherish having grown up in Cabrini. Alkalimat attended Ottawa University, where he earned a B.A. in sociology and philosophy in 1963. He completed his M.A. in sociology at the University of Chicago in 1966, and earned a Ph.D. in sociology there in 1974. During the late 1960s, he helped create the Institute of the Black World (IBW) in Atlanta with professors Vincent Harding and Stephen Henderson and other student activists, including Howard Dodson, A. B. Spellman, William Strickland, and Council Taylor. The IBW became \\"the most dynamic black 'think tank' of the era\\", according to Peniel E. Joseph, assistant professor of Africana studies at Stony Brook University. In the early 1970s, Alkalimat established Peoples College, a black nationalist think tank. He wrote Introduction to Afro- American Studies: A Peoples College Primer (1984), which has become a popular text and gone through several editions. Alkalimat helped to organize the Illinois Council for Black Studies, and in 1982 he hosted the annual meeting of the National Council for Black Studies (NCBS). He was elected the NCBS chairman, but the organization's board questioned the results and called for a new election the following year to determine whether Alkalimat's ascension to the post was legitimate. In an election that many members considered confusing, Alkalimat was voted out. New voting rules were adopted by the board that made the results retroactive, stripping Alkalimat of his chairmanship. In 1991, Alkalimat wrote Malcolm X for Beginners. He and his publisher, Writers and Readers Press, were sued by Betty Shabazz, the widow of Malcolm X, and Pathfinder Press, which has exclusive rights to publish Malcolm X's speeches. Shabazz and Pathfinder alleged the book contained quotations from Malcolm X without permission. Alkalimat and his publisher said that the book's quotations were permitted under the fair use doctrine. The matter was settled out of court, with Alkalimat relinquishing all royalties from the book. ==Selected works== *Introduction to Afro-American Studies (1984), Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press (available online) *Harold Washington and the Crisis of Black Power in Chicago (1989), Chicago: Twenty-First Century Books (with Douglas C.

The 2si 690-L70 engine was a factory option. The aircraft is built from tubing and includes a partial cockpit fairing. The side-by-side seating configuration is unusual in powered parachutes, but was intended to make dual instruction easier. In flight steering is accomplished via dual foot pedals that actuate the canopy brakes, creating roll and yaw. On the ground the aircraft has a center-mounted bicycle handlebar that controls the nosewheel steering. The main landing gear incorporates steel spring rod suspension.

The eponymous Aaron Manby steamboat was the first iron-hulled steamer to go to sea, and it was driven by Manby's patent Oscillating Engine, an effective and durable marine steam engine. ==Career== Engine Arm Aqueduct, 1828, one of Manby's iron canal bridges in the English Midlands In 1812 Manby was managing partner of the Horseley Coal and Iron Co, Tipton, Staffordshire. It ran coal mines, blast furnaces to make iron, and assorted workshops. Manby expanded the business into civil engineering. In 1813 Manby obtained patent No 3705 for a means of casting the slag from blast furnaces into blocks for building. In 1815, the firm supplied a cast-iron swing bridge, possibly the first of Horseley's many iron bridges. In 1821, diversifying into mechanical engineering, Manby obtained British Patent No 4558 for his \\"oscillating engine\\" designed for use in ships. That same year, Horseley Ironworks constructed the world's first seagoing iron steamboat, named the Aaron Manby, using his oscillating engine.Dumpleton 2002, pages 18ff.Kemp 1979, page 1. The boat was built at Tipton using temporary bolts, disassembled for transportation to London, and reassembled on the Thames in 1822, this time using permanent rivets. Between 1819 and 1822, Manby started his engineering works at Charenton-le-Pont, near Paris, with the Scottish chemist Daniel Wilson as manager. This controversial move enabled France to stop buying engines made in England, which made Manby somewhat unpopular. In 1822 Manby and Wilson's Compagnie d'Éclairage par de Gaz Hydrogène ('Hydrogen Gas Lighting Company') was granted the right to provide gas lighting for several streets in Paris. According to Michel Cotte, \\"The company Manby & Wilson is certainly the largest company of British origin which set up in France under the Restoration.\\"\\"Une entreprise anglaise en France durant la Restauration\\" Pages 119-130. In section 13, Michel Cotte wrote: \\"La société Manby & Wilson est certainement l’entreprise d’origine britannique la plus importante qui s’installe en France sous la Restauration.\\" Their \\"Compagnie Anglaise\\" ran until 1847, expanding to take in the Le Creusot ironworks. Manby's Horseley Ironworks profited from the growing canal trade, manufacturing canal bridges in the English MidlandsSandwell MBC: Top 10 Canal Attractions including the Engine Arm Aqueduct (1825) and two roving bridges at Smethwick Junction (1828).Cragg, 1997. In 1845 Manby sold Horseley Ironworks to John Joseph Bramah (~1798 - 1846), nephew of the inventor and locksmith Joseph Bramah. ==Family life== Manby was born at Albrighton, Shropshire on 15 November 1776 to Aaron Manby of Kingston, Jamaica and Jane Lane of Bentley. Manby's first wife was Julia Fewster. They had a son, Charles Manby, who became Secretary of the Institution of Civil Engineers.Skempton, 2002. Julia died in 1807.Grace's Guide, 2011. In 1807 Manby married Sarah Ann Haskins, with whom he had one daughter, Sarah Maria (d. 1826), and four more sons. The oldest three of them, John Richard (1813-1869), Joseph Lane (1814-1862), and Edward Oliver (1816-1864), also became civil engineers. Sarah Ann died in 1826. ==NotesReferences== * Cragg, Roger.

However, for a girl it was not realistic to go abroad at such young age, and she was taught drawing at the Haarlemse School voor Kunstnijverheid from 1891 until 1893.Jacoba Johanna Ritsema in the RKD (Dutch)A. Lammers, 'Ritsema, Jacoba Johanna (1876-1961)', in Biografisch Woordenboek van Nederland: 1880-2000. (Dutch) Her sister Catherine tried to become a pianist (and later became violist) and her brother Johan studied lithography like his father. From 1893 until 1897 Coba studied at the Rijksacademie van Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam where she was taught in a special class for female artists. She was in her education a pupil of August Allebé, George Hendrik Breitner, Carel Lodewijk Dake, Fredrik Theodorus Grabijn, Jacob Ritsema (her brother), Thérèse Schwartze, and Nicolaas van der Waay. After moving back to Haarlem for a short period, she moved in 1899 to a house at Jan Luykenstraat 23 in Amsterdam, while she had her studio at the fourth floor of Singel 512. She focused herself on the still life style, and was rejected by several famous artists she had in mind as tutor - they thought they insecure Ritsema didn't need their guidance. She was a member of the Lucas Society and Arti et Amicitiae (where she was one of the first female voting members), societies around her example Thérèse Schwartze. Recognition would however follow: in 1910 she won the bronze medal at the Exposition Universelle et Internationale in Brussels, in 1912 and in 1923 she won a silver medal from the city of Amsterdam, and in 1918 she won a Royal medal given to her by Queen Wilhelmina. In 1912 the critic Albert Plasschaert mentioned the circle of friends of which Ritsema was a part to be the Amsterdamsche Joffers (Amsterdam Young ladies) - a group of young rich female artists who worked together a lot and had a joint vision on art. She became a teacher of the students Grada Jacoba Wilhelmina Boks, Lize Duyvis, Jan den Hengst, Tine Honig, Coba Surie, Hillegonga Henriëtte Tellekamp, Victoire Wirix, and Gonda Wulfse. She was not considered to be an explicit feminist, but at the same time an example of an independent woman. While focusing on still lifes and portraits, Ritsema's works were described in 1947 by critic Johan van Eikeren as if they could have been produced by a man - something that was considered to be a compliment in those years. He work was usually well sold, although she was not such a master that she could afford to refuse to make compromises. In her portraits there is a clear difference between those of her relatives and direct connections, which are painted rather realistic, and those of models - which are usually more impressionist. Coba was close with her brother Jacob, and when he suddenly died in 1943, she took that hard - Jacob was also a painter after all, and she consulted him a lot on her work. In 1957 she won the Rembrandt prize - a prize awarded by the city of Amsterdam once every five years. At old age she remained active although her studio wasn't easy to reach for a woman at age like herself, being on the fourth floor - she had chairs placed on every floor the way up, to be able to rest on each floor while she climbed. In her final years she lived in Pro Sinecure at the Amsterdam Vondelstraat, where she died from her weak heart in 1961. She was a member of the Pulchri Studio in the Hague, as well as being a member of the Teekengenootschap Pictura. Works of Ritsema are on display in the Teylers Museum and Mesdag van Calcar, but she also had a solo exposition in the Frans Hals Museum. ==References== *Jacoba Johanna Ritsema on Artnet Category:1876 births Category:1961 deaths Category:Artists from Haarlem Category:Dutch women painters Category:Dutch portrait painters Category:20th- century Dutch painters Category:20th-century women artists ","title":"Coba Ritsema"},{"id":"35215063","text":"Whispers in the Dark is the debut album by American R&B; group, Profyle.

With his essay The Moral Equivalent of War he is considered Aberkane 2010 one of the fathers of the concept of war against war In political philosophy and international relations especially in peace and conflict studies the concept of a war against war also known as war on war refers to the reification of armed conflicts. ==Origin== Memorial plaque for Ernst Friedrich at the 'Antikriegsmuseum' (anti-war museum) in Berlin-Mitte, Germany. One can read the title of Friedrich's book 'Krieg dem kriege\\" If a work of Edmond Potonié-Pierre from 1877 already discusses the idea of reifying conflicts under the title \\"la guerre à la guerre\\" (the war against war)Edmond Pontonié-Pierre La Guerre à la Guerre 1877 in its modern acceptation the concept is formally coined in 1906 by William James in his essay The moral equivalent of war. Though also used as a political slogan, it was a cornerstone of the ideology of both the European pre World War I pacifist and anti-war movements in the 20th centuryFrancis Ludwig Carsten War against war: British and German radical movements in the First World War, University of California Press 1982 especially in its German version of Kriege dem Kriege from the eponymous two volume 1925 pamphlet of Ernst FriedrichErnst Friedrich, Kriege dem Kriege! 2 vol \\"Freie Jugend\\", 1925 which was largely translated across Europe. The age-old call to glory held no charm for German pacifist Ernst Friedrich (1894-1967). In 1924, he founded the National Anti- War Museum in Berlin, where a radical new method of protest was born. To illustrate a need for universal peace, Friedrich quickly displayed hundreds of disturbing photographs which fully revealed the hidden horrors of World War One. For those who could not personally attend his gruesome gallery, Friedrich published a book called \\"War Against War,\\" which featured anti-military sentiments juxtaposed with some of his most graphic images. In 1933, with thousands of copies in circulation, Friedrich encountered the wrath of the aggressive and newly formed National Socialist party. Soon, the war museum was destroyed, and its curator was forced to flee to Belgium. Prior to World War I the French labour union Confédération Générale du Travail pleaded its pacifism under the slogan guerre à la guerre! which was also the title of a poster campaign by which the French Association de la Paix par le Droit recalled the commitments taken by European powers at the Hague Convention of 1907.\\"Guerre à la Guerre!\\" campagne d'affichage de l'Association pour la Paix par le Droit exemplaire d'une affiche disponible à la Bibliothèque Municipale de Lyon, France ==Evolution in the 20th century== Although the slogan and concept (as the reification of armed conflicts) of war against war was the subject of an anti-military pleading in 1916 at the military tribunal of NeuchâtelJules Humbert-Droz Guerre à la guerre: à bas l'armée : plaidoirie complète devant le Tribunal militaire à Neuchâtel le 16 août 1916 the concept will also be developed by the French military with General Alexandre Percin, then War Minister, dedicating a comprehensive study to the subject entitled Guerre à la Guerre.Alexandre Percin, Guerre à la Guerre Paris: Montaigne 1927 The latter work, which especially explores the operational and strategic dimension of the concept from the angle of military doctrine would become a seminal contribution to its academic establishment.

Based on the paradigm of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela for the description of autonomy and the works of Idries Shah in group psychology Aberkane's discussion of the concept consists of considering armed conflicts autopoietic and therefore dissipative systems which are parasitic and comparable to Richard Dawkins' notion of selfish gene hence \\"selfish wars\\".Aberkane 2012, ibid Conceptually Aberkane argues for a prescriptive use of peace and conflict studies, especially in a study on the defusing of the tensions in XinjiangAberkane, Idriss \\"Yin or Yang: China and the Muslim World\\" e-International Relations, 29 avril 2011, §4 by which he defends the logical soundness of the concept of a \\"war against war\\" in five points: * (i) \\"the qualitative complexity of the notion of interest (e.g. What you may think is not your interest may be in a broader perspective)\\" * (ii) \\"the non-refuted possibility that external conflicts of interests may be internalized within one single interest,\\" * (iii)\\" the fact that Hilbert's sixth problem has not been solved (ie physical reality is not axiomatized) which implies that\\" * (iv) \\"while limitation theorems can be demonstrated in first order logic (and game theory) there can be no limitation theorem predicating upon physical reality which comprises the notion of interest, thus in particular\\" * (v) \\"the impossibility of the total interest of peace ie. the stable intersection of individual and collective peace in international relations cannot be demonstrated.\\" What Aberkane thus describes as \\"erenologic positivism\\" is transcribed in game theoretical vocabulary as that in international relations \\"it is also not proven that a Pareto-optimal situation at the world level (or at a less formal level of describing diplomatic reality, a situation that may be reminiscent to the latter without its mathematical precision) could not be also overlapping with the Nash equilibrium of interacting individual interests.\\"Aberkane, Ibid 2011 Peace–industrial complex At least two approaches to the war against war may be distinguished, the frontal opposition to war or Anti-war movement on the one side and the transcendent, post-war conception of William James' 'Moral Equivalent of war' positing, in the way of the UNESCO, that the only way to end conflicts is to make Humanity busy with more fascinating endeavors than wars. In his Nobel acceptance speech Martin Luther King Jr. further underlined that idea which would become the basis of the transcendentist school (e.g. Aberkane): Official picture of Martin Luther King Jr. at the Nobel Foundation, 1964 Various scholars (Suter 1986, Aberkane 2012, Roberts 2009) and politicians (Seiberling 1972) have thus advocated that peace profiteering should simply be made palatably larger than any possible war profiteering, thus transcending the war against war. However, the first generations of Peace-Industrial scholars have advocated frontal opposition to the military–industrial complex rather than its transcendent, voluntary metamorphosis into a globally benevolent yet very profitable peace-industrial complex. US. Rep. John F. Seiberling circa the time of his 1972 address to the Congress calling for a Peace-industrial complex In 1986 Keith D.

Salla, M.E 'Why the Cold War Ended: A Range of Interpretations' Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995 p.202 The concept of a Peace-industrial complex had already been introduced as early as in 1969 in the U.S. Senate Committee on Government Operations.United States. Congress. Senate. Committee on Government Operations, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1969 p.147 The original quote affirmed direct opposition to the military-industrial complex and was therefore not transcendent in nature: \\"It is time for the United States to break the Huge military-industrial complex and begin in its stead a people and peace-industrial complex\\".

An Education for a Peace Industrial Complex conference (EPIC) is also mentioned in a 1984 issue of the Nuclear Times.Nuclear Times, Volumes 3 to 4, 1984 If Kofi J. Roberts Roberts K. J. The Sargasso Bridge, iUniverse 2009 p. 185 explicitly called for the substitution of a military-industrial complex by a peace industrial complex which would enable the focusing on federal spendings on construction rather than destruction, Idriss J. Aberkane further defended the transcendent approach to the peace-industrial complex by calling it the \\"military- industrial complex 2.0\\" and thus neither the enemy nor the political complement to the military industrial complex but rather its natural, inevitable evolution on the account that investors (either institutional or private) will inevitably realize the larger profitability of construction over destruction. Aberkane also advocates the political viability of a peace- industrial complex by declaring that in the 21st century, what he calls \\"weapons of mass construction\\" will grant much larger political leverage, leadership and soft power than weapons of mass destruction.

McNeill had previously played professional football in the Scottish Football League for Hibernian, Greenock Morton and Stirling Albion. ==Football career== McNeill grew up in the Scottish mining town of Tranent. He played football for the local team, Tranent Juniors, but also played rugby union for the school fifteen. In 1963 he left school aged 16 and became an apprentice quantity surveyor. While in the fifth form at Ross High School, Tranent, he was recruited by Hibernian FC as an apprentice footballer. McNeill appeared regularly in the Hibernian reserve team in five years at the club, but played in only one senior game, a 3–0 win against St Johnstone in December 1965. He transferred to Greenock Morton in 1968 after scoring a hat trick in a trial game. He also played for Stirling Albion during the 1968–69 season. In December 1968, McNeill was reading the Edinburgh Evening News when he noticed his name in the entries for the 1969 New Year Sprint. He had been entered by an old school friend who thought McNeill might be a better sprinter than he was a footballer. Despite being run out in the cross tie, McNeill enjoyed this new found sport and soon retired from soccer to take up a sprinting career. Having played football professionally, McNeill was prevented from participating in amateur athletic events, but was able to enter professional running events. ==Sprinting career== At the age of 21, George had his first start in a sprint race when he contested the heats of the 1969 New Year Sprint at the Powderhall stadium. Running off 9.5 yards, McNeill made the cross ties (semi finals) however failed to advance to the final. He was so impressed by the performance of the eventual winner David Deas, that McNeill was eager to seek out Deas' coach, Jim Bradley. Bradley had already coached three New Year Sprint winners and McNeill was eager to become the fourth. McNeill went into the gym, pounding the speedball and performing several body-weight exercises to transform his body to the condition required to improve substantially. In 1970, running off 5.50 yards, McNeill won the 120 yards New Year Sprint held at Powderhall in Edinburgh, recording a time of 11.61 seconds. It was the 100th running of the New Year Sprint. In August 1970, McNeill broke the world professional 120 yards record, setting a fastest time of 11.14 seconds. In 1971 McNeill ran 2nd off scratch in the New Year Sprint at Meadowbank Stadium conceding 6 yards to stablemate Wilson Young who won the event. In 1972, he was crowned world professional sprint champion after winning three of four races against USA Olympic champion Tommie Smith at the Wakefield rugby ground. In 1972, McNeill visited Australia for the first of what turned out to be many trips abroad to run on the professional athletic circuit. He ran at Stawell in the heats of the Stawell Gift for several years including three consecutive finals from 1979 to 1981. In 1979, he was runner-up to Noel McMahon and the following year finished fifth to John Dinan. At the age of 34, McNeil returned once again in 1981 – the 100th edition of the Stawell Gift. Running off 4.0m and in one of the most exciting races ever, McNeill ran brilliantly to win the Gift at his ninth attempt in the time of 11.9secs. McNeill still remains the oldest winner of the Stawell Gift. McNeill took up coaching in the 1980s, training Willie Fraser to win the 1985 New Year Sprint and David Clarke to 2nd place in the 1985 Stawell Gift. He has also worked in coaching football teams, including Hearts and Livingston. McNeill's son, also named George, was a Scottish youth sprint champion. In 2003 McNeill was inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame in the Athletics category. McNeill works as an after dinner speaker. ==References * Category:Scottish male sprinters Category:Living people Category:1947 births Category:People from Tranent Category:Sportspeople from East Lothian Category:Scottish footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:Hibernian F.C. players Category:Greenock Morton F.C. players Category:Stirling Albion F.C. players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Heart of Midlothian F.C. non-playing staff Category:Livingston F.C. non-playing staff Category:Tranent Juniors F.C. players Category:Stawell Gift winners ","title":"George McNeill (sprinter)"},{"id":"35215164","text":"Riley Weselowski (born February 24, 1985) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman currently playing with the Wichita Thunder of the ECHL. ==Playing career== Weselowski made his professional debut with the Idaho Steelheads of the ECHL.

In 1933 - at the height of the Great Depression - the American Institute of Architects published suggested minimum wage standards under the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) that prescribed a rate of 50 cents per hour for architectural draftsmen and 40 cents for engineering draftsmen. Incensed by what they perceived as an insultingly low wage rate, members of the Union of Technical Men called a meeting at which it was resolved to merge with United Committee of Architects, Engineers and Chemists (a loose coalition of technical employees' organizations, primarily representing civil service engineers) to form the FAECT. The federation grew rapidly, reaching a membership of 6,500 by 1934, organised into 15 local unions. In June 1936 the FAECT organised a sit-down strike by architects employed by the New York City Department of Parks, who barricaded themselves in their offices in protest at alleged anti-union activities by Robert Moses and other Department officials. Later in the same year the federation secured a significant pay rise for the approximately 7000 architects employed by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). The FAECT initially sought to affiliate to the American Federation of Labor (AFL) by rejoining the IFTEADU as an independent local, despite the fact that it was now significantly larger than the IFTEADU (which boasted approximately 1500 members, primarily draftsmen employed in naval shipyards). In 1936 the IFTEADU national convention voted to allow the FAECT to rejoin, however this was blocked by IFTEADU's president C. L. Rosenmund. In 1937 a new national labor organization was created - the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and the FAECT affiliated to it almost immediately. Following affiliation there was a re-organization of industrial jurisdiction, with many of the FAECT's members in civil service transferred to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) CIO. During the late 1930s the federation attempted to expand its membership in the private sector and launched successful organizing drives at a number of major American industrial corporations including Shell (at its Emeryville Research Center), General Electric, RCA and ITT. It also organized affiliate chapters in a number of technical colleges, aiming to introduce students to unionism in the hope they would be more likely to become members after graduating. Between 1934 and 1938 the FAECT published a journal entitled Technical America. From 1936 it also operated the Federation Technical School in New York, teaching architecture, industrial design and related subjects. A number of the union's officials were communists and it was accused of involvement with Soviet espionage, particularly in relation to the United States' atomic weapons program. ==References== Category:Defunct trade unions in the United States ","title":"Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists, and Technicians"},{"id":"35215214","text":"Marcel Baude (born 5 October 1989) is a German footballer who plays as a right-back for VfB Auerbach. ==Career== Baude came through Chemnitzer FC's youth and reserve reans, and made his debut in a 6–0 win over VfB Lübeck in September 2010, as a substitute for Ronny Garbuschewski.

It is the type species of the genus Pompilus and therefore of the family Pompilidae. ==Distribution== It is widespread throughout the Old World, including Mediterranean islands, Canary Islands, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, Japan, the Philippines, Borneo, Java, and Australia. In Britain, it is mainly found in the south, but extends north to the central belt of Scotland.https://data.nbn.org.uk/Taxa/NBNSYS0000009413/Grid_Map ==Variability== P. cinereus is a highly variable species throughout its wide range, giving rise to the large number of synonyms which have been attached to the species by different authors. Where it overlaps with congeners in southern and central Africa and in southern Asia, the phenotype is stable and it can be distinguished from the species with which it is sympatric. Over the rest of its huge range, it has no sympatric congeners and shows wide phenotypic variation. Male of Pompilus cinereus For example, in western Europe, the females in north-western populations are predominantly black, pubescent dorsally with narrow transverse strips of grey at the rear of each tergum, interrupted medially. The face is dark above the antennae and grey below. Some of the specimens taken in Gotland, Sweden, are black with dark brown pubescence posteriorly on the abdomen, or with a little grey on that of others; these specimens are the basis of the 'subspecies' P. plumbeus gotlandicus Wolf. In northern Iberia, a dark form which is nearly identical with the form found around the North Sea and Baltic littoral is found, but with the face narrower above. In southern Portugal, individuals that are almost entirely black and were named as the subspecies P. c. lusitanicus are found and these are found in sympatry with more normally grey individuals previously regarded as P. c. plumbeus which is the characteristic form of south-east Spain and the rest of the Mediterranean. This type of phenotypic variability is found throughout the species range. Day (1981) treats P. cinereus as a monotypic species despite this wide variation across its range. ==Habitat== It is found in coastal dunes and sandy river beds and banks. P. cinereus shows a distinct preference for loose sand and may be abundant in sheltered, sunny areas in dune systems. ==Biology== In northwestern Europe, spiders of the family Lycosidae are the most frequent prey for P. cinereus, spiders of the families Gnaphosidae, Zoridae, Clubionidae, Pisauridae, and Thomisidae have also been recorded as prey, albeit with much less frequency than Lycosidae. P. cinereus locates in the sand or encounters on the surface a prey individual which is stung into immobility. The prey is then transported by the wasp, which holds the prey in its mandibles and walks forwards. Most frequently, the prey is temporarily interred whilst a suitable nest site is sought and a burrow excavated. Significant time and effort may be spent on trial burrows before a site is finally selected. When the nest is complete, the prey may be taken to the entrance and carried in. The prey spider is carried into a terminal cell big enough to accommodate both wasp and prey. The egg is laid on the upper forward part the prey's abdomen. The wasp then closes the burrow, pulling in the walls and roof with its mandibles and then tamping the soil with the tip of the abdomen. The spider in the cell recovers from paralysis some time between 3 and 6 hours after being stung and begins to walk aimlessly about the cell, spinning silk continuously resulting in a silk-lined cell of considerable structural integrity. After three days, the small larva emerges from the egg and begins to consume the trapped spider, killing it by consuming its abdomen. P. cinereus is ecologically versatile and takes a wide variety of prey and is the dominant pompilid spider wasp in many parts of its range. The smaller males hatch from unfertilised eggs (like other in Hymenoptera) and are provisioned with smaller spider prey than female eggs. ==References== Category:Hymenoptera of Europe Category:Insects described in 1798 Category:Pompilinae ","title":"Pompilus cinereus"},{"id":"35215267","text":"In mathematics, the Young–Deruyts development is a method of writing invariants of an action of a group on an n-dimensional vector space V in terms of invariants depending on at most n–1 vectors .. ==References== * * Category:Invariant theory ","title":"Young–Deruyts development"},{"id":"35215276","text":"Marie Ann Kruckel [\\"Kruck\\"] (June 18, 1924 – July 21, 2012) was an American outfielder and pitcher who played from through in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.

A willing and determined player, Kruckel began her career at outfield and later doubled as a spot starter for three teams in a span of four years. During her grade school days, Kruckel started playing softball in the Bronx and later played organized ball on the weekends while at high school. Following her graduation, she attended East Stroudsburg State Teachers College in Pennsylvania and played for a team based in Yorktown, New York. By 1945, she wrote a letter to the league requesting information and received an invitation to the training camp. The league sent her a contract offer after she graduated.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Kruckel entered the league in 1946 with the South Bend Blue Sox, playing for them one year before joining the Fort Wayne Daisies in 1947. Because she taught school, Kruckel was unable to attend spring training and was used exclusively as a fourth outfielder during her first two seasons. Then, in 1948 she returned to the Blue Sox. They tried her as a pitcher because she showed a good command of the curveball and a strong off-speed pitch. She was traded to the Muskegon Lassies midway through the season, staying with them for one more year. Her most productive season came in 1948, when she posted a combined 9–4 record and a 1.65 earned run average in 19 games pitched, ending sixth in the league with a .692 winning percentage.

He died on 5 March 1972. He was an early member of the Society of Wood Engravers Joanna Selborne, ‘The Society of Wood Engravers: the early years’ in Craft History 1 (1988), published by Combined Arts. and a founding member of the English Wood Engraving Society in 1925. He also worked in oils and water colour. He was a member of the Royal Watercolour Society, and exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy. ==His wood engravings== White's introduction to wood engraving came in 1920. Hitherto he had worked largely in water colour. In 1920 Cyril Beaumont, for whom he had produced designs for booklets on the Russian ballet (L'Oiseau de Feu, The Three Cornered Hat, Thamar and Impressions of the Russian Ballet, all 1919) and two limited editions (Eclogues, a Book of Poems 1919 and The Smile of the Sphinx 1920), asked him to produce colour wood engravings for an edition of W.W. Gibson's Home for his Beaumont Press.B. T. Jackson, 'The Beaumont Press' in Private Library (Spring 1975), published by the Private Libraries Association. White then started to produce independent wood engravings very much in the modern style advocated by Noel Rooke. These were unusually large in scale. His most important book illustrated with wood engravings is The Story of My Heart by Richard Jefferies, published by Duckworth in 1923. Thomas Balston considers this to be the first substantial book illustrated with modern wood engravings to be published in Britain.Thomas Balston, 'The wood-engravings of Ethelbert White' in Image 3 (Winter 1949-50). In the same year the Golden Cockerel Press published an edition of Spenser's Wedding Songs with colour wood engravings by White. His final set of wood engravings was for Thoreau's Walden, published by Penguin Books as part of a series of ten books called the Penguin Illustrated Classics in 1938. By 1940 he had ceased to produce wood engravings. ==His work in oils and water colour== White was very much a member of the art scene in England at the time. He was elected to the London Group in 1915 and became a member of the New English Art Club in 1921. He was one of the first artists to become a member of the Artists' International Association. He was a member of the Royal Watercolour Society and exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy. He was much in sympathy with British avant-garde artists and was influenced by the post impressionist painters in France. Hilary Chapman describes him as a pastoralist, \\"his artistic vision rooted in his genuine delight in nature\\". His work, which became looser and more impressionistic as time progressed, consists of a very large number of oil painting and water colours. ==His life and work== White came of a wealthy background, and had no need to sell his work to live. In 1919 he married Elizabeth Crofton Dodwell, better known as Betty, and in the same year studied at St John's Wood School of Art in London. In the early 1920s he bought an original horse drawn gypsy caravan which he drove around London; it also became the summer home for the couple as they drove around Surrey and Sussex. They enjoyed the simple life, but it was the simple life of the rich, as White bought a second home in Amberley as a studio for the summer months. They loved parties, and Bertie and Betty were much in demand as entertainers, White on the guitar and Betty singing. They were a very sociable and loving couple. White became president of the Artists' General Benevolent Institution in 1933. White was a traditional English landscape artist, and his subject matter was mostly the scenery of Southern England. After his death there were several memorial exhibitions, notably at the Fine Art Society in 1979.Peyton Skipwith, Ethelbert White (1891-1972): a Memorial Exhibition (London, Fine Art Society, 1979). A centenary exhibition of his wood engravings was held at the Pallant Gallery in 1991. ==Further reading== The standard text on White is by Hilary Chapman.Hilary Chapman, Ethelbert White (1891-1972): Painter, Printmaker (Bicester, Primrose Hill Press, 2003), .

In 1620, he accompanied his parents, Pilgrims William and Susanna White, on the journey. He married Judith Vassall, daughter of William Vassall, a founder of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Later in life White became a notable person of Plymouth Colony.Caleb H.

The Mayflower Society states that Susanna's maiden name is Jackson. Resolved is believed to have been about five years of age in late 1620, having been born in England about 1615. His mother was pregnant during the Mayflower voyage and gave birth to his brother Peregrine in late November 1620 while the ship was anchored at Cape Cod. The Whites are believed to have boarded the Mayflower as part of the London merchant group, and not as members of the Leiden, Holland, religious movement. Evidence of the William White family coming to the Mayflower from England and not Holland comes from William Bradford's Mayflower passenger list which has \\"Mr. William White\\" in his section for London merchants along with Mr. Christopher Martin, Mr. William Mullins, Stephen Hopkins, Richard Warren and John Billington. It is believed that if William White had been a member of the Leiden congregation, his name would have appeared in Bradford's work for that section, but it does not. There is also no evidence to associate William White and his family with Leiden, Holland. Although there are various White family ancestries that place the William White family in them, the Mayflower Society states that, \\"Little is known about William White.\\"Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623 (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006), p. 51Caleb H. Johnson, The Mayflower and Her Passengers (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., copyright 2006 Caleb Johnson), pp. 246-247 ==Mayflower voyage== The Mayflower departed Plymouth, England, on September 6, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30–40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, contributed to the deaths of many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst came after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half of the passengers perished in the cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.Eugene Aubrey Stratton. Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Ancestry Publishing, Salt Lake City, UT, 1986) p. 413 On November 9, 1620, after about three months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. After several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod Hook, where they anchored on November 11. The Mayflower Compact was signed that day.George Ernest Bowman, The Mayflower Compact and its signers, (Boston: Massachusetts Society of Mayflower Descendants, 1920).

In February 1642/43, a new church was founded in Scituate by William Vassall and other dissenters from the existing English Puritan church. Members, known as the \\"Vassall Group,\\" called their new church the \\"Second Church\\" of Scituate. Judith White was one of the founding members of this new church. However, the religious situation in the colony forced William Vassall to leave for England a few years later, never to return to the colony.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 79-80 In the 1643 Able to Bear Arms (ATBA) list for Scituate, White is listed with his father- in-law and his brother-in-law, John Vassell, who would become a wealthy Caribbean plantation owner.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 439, 442, 443 On May 11, 1657, White was in Barbados to witness the sale by his sister-in-law Mary Vassall of her share of William Vassall's plantation at St. Michaels.

On June 3, 1668, White was elected surveyor of highways for Marshfield. Judith White was buried in Marshfield on April 3, 1670. White married Abigail Lord, the widow of Willow Lord, in Salem on October 5, 1674. In 1676, White fought in King Philip's War. In 1680, he became a freeman in Salem, but moved back to Marshfield a couple of years later. Abigail White died in Salem between June 15 and 27, 1682. == Death == White died sometime after September 19, 1687, though the exact date is uncertain. He may have been alive as late as 1690, as author Caleb Johnson reports that in that year he provided a note to Bradford's History of Plymouth Plantation stating, \\"Two persons living that came over in the first ship in 1620, this present year 1690: Resolved White and Mary Cushman.\\" He apparently died within a few years of that writing. White was buried in Winslow Cemetery in Marshfield, as was his wife Judith in 1670. The burial place of Abigail is unknown. In Winslow Cemetery there is a substantial monument to \\"The Settlers of Green Harbor Marshfield\\" that names White and his wife Judith, as well as his brother Peregrine and Peregrine's wife Sarah. Also named on the monument are White's mother Susanna and her second husband, Edward Winslow. Her date of death is uncertain – sometime between 1654 and 1675 – with burial in Winslow Cemetery. Edward Winslow died during a British military expedition in the Caribbean in 1655 and was buried at sea.

A mood repair strategy is a cognitive, behavioral, and interpersonal psychological tool used to affect the mood regulation of an individual. Various mood repair strategies are most commonly used in cognitive therapy. They are commonly assigned as homework by therapists in order to help positively impact individuals who are experiencing dysphoria or depression.Detweiler-Bedell, J. B., Salovey, P. \\"Striving for happiness or fleeing from sadness? Motivating mood repair using differentially framed messages\\" (PDF). Dec, 2003. Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, Vol 22(6), pp. 627–64. However, these tools can also be used for individuals experiencing temporary unwanted moods. Many factors go into the effectiveness of mood repair strategies on an individual ranging from the client's self- esteemHeimpel, S. A., Wood, J. V., Marshall, M. A., Brown, J. D. \\"Do people with low self-esteem really want to feel better? Self-esteem differences in motivation to repair negative moods\\". Jan, 2002. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol 82(1), pp. 128–47. to their experience with the strategy being used. Even the way the mood repair strategy is presented (either to avoid negative moods or to pursue positive moods) may have an effect on that strategy's ability to improve mood. ==Background== Mood repair strategies have existed in a casual and unscientific way for basically all of modern human history due to general affect and the desire to change that affect when it is negative. Generally the techniques could be considered \\"common knowledge\\" but these techniques were unexplored in research. Concepts such as \\"think happy thoughts\\" and \\"don't listen to sad music\\" are commonly prescribed by friends or family to those suffering in negative moods. What remained to be seen though, was how the various individuals differed and subsequently, which of these \\"common knowledge\\" concepts should be suggested or how they should be phrased when presented. The first scholarly mention of mood repair strategies came from Joseph Forgas and Gorden Bower in 1988.Forgas, J., Bower, G. \\"Affect in social judgements\\". 1988. Australian Journal of Psychology. Vol 40, Issue 2 Extensive listing and studying of these techniques started in the mid 1990s. It has primarily focused on the differences in the individuals to whom the mood repair strategies are given and how the strategies prove effective on each type of person. While various personality types may be more receptive to mood repair strategies it appears that there has been some success in working with all types of individuals. Lischetzke, T. Eid, M. \\"Why Extraverts Are Happier Than Introverts: The Role of Mood Regulation\\". Aug, 2006. Journal of Personality, Vol 74(4), pp. 1127–62. While professional use of mood repair strategies began primarily in the clinical cognitive psychology movement the expansion of the positive psychology movement is helping to increase the professional use of these mood repair strategies. Cognitive mood repair strategies are primarily concerned with the ability of recognizing emotional upset and taking one of three courses of action. An individual can choose to evaluate the feelings of dysphoria and better understand the source of the negative mood to give the individual a sense of control of his or her mood. Chen, L., Zhou, S., Bryant, J. \\"Temporal changes in mood repair through music consumption: Effects of mood, mood salience, and individual differences\\". 2007. Media Psychology, Vol 9(3), pp. 695–713. Re-evaluation can also occur which allows for individuals to take a negative situation that cause a mood and seek to find a positive perspective from the circumstance. Distraction can also occur which allows for individuals to recall mood-incongruent memories or positive thoughts in order to distract from the current upset in mood. Rusting, C. L., DeHart, T. \\"Retrieving positive memories to regulate negative mood: Consequences for mood-congruent memory\\". Apr, 2000. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol 78(4), pp. 737–52. Behavioral mood repair strategies allow for individuals to regulate their moods by the utilization of activities or tasks. Working on a task allows for individuals to temporarily distract from their current mood. Exercise also allows for a release of tension and an improvement of mood.Kovacs, M., Rottenberg, J., George, C., \\"Maladaptive mood repair responses distinguish young adults with early-onset depressive disorders and predict future depression outcomes\\". Nov, 2009. Psychological Medicine: A Journal of Research in Psychiatry and the Allied Sciences, Vol 39(11), Nov, pp. 1841–54. Interpersonal mood repair strategies deal primarily with the focus of mood repair deriving from a relationship with other people. This can occur from individuals seeking out emotional support and a deeper processing of the possible circumstance that led to the negative mood. This can also be achieved by distracting the individual and being with individuals that could lift the overall positivity of the individual. ==Presentation== Presentation of mood repair strategies has been the primary focus of much of the research studying the efficacy of mood repair strategies. The initial thing to consider when proposing the use of a mood repair strategy is what kind of state the unhappy individual is in. If the individual is depressed, avoidance framed messages have been shown to have the greatest influence on increasing mood. This means that presenting mood repair strategies in such a way that they do not seem like they are attempting to achieve happiness, but rather to avoid sadness, are more effective. Individuals who are not clinically depressed respond better to approach framed messages of mood repair. These individuals are usually more interested in achieving happiness. Individual’s perceptions of the desirability of mood change and the likelihood that a strategy may work are what bring about success. Directing the individual seeking mood repair to engage in concrete, as opposed to abstract, processing is another important part of presentation. Abstract processing focuses on “why” questions while concrete processing is focused on moment-to- moment experiences. Concrete processing allows people to focus away from their current negative state. This kind of processing naturally coincides with the use of imagery. Pairing highly sensory imagery with emotionally relevant memory has been shown to give people the best chance at experiencing mood repair. This is taken into account when presenting mood repair strategies to people.Werner-Seidler, A., Moulds, M. L. \\"Mood repair and processing mode in depression\\". Oct 24, 2011. US: American Psychological Association. ==Techniques== Retrieving positive memories Sometimes known as distraction or Mood Incongruent Recollection, this is one of the most common mood repair strategies. Normally people engage in thoughts of mood congruence, which are ones that are in harmony with their mood. Mood incongruent recollection is usually the forced consideration of memories not related to the current mood. The theory behind this thinking is that when the mind is engaged in a track of negative mood, the forced recall of positive memories will break the cycle and force the brain to reorient into a more positive state. Joormann, J., Siemer, M., \\"Memory Accessibility, Mood Regulation, and Dysphoria: Difficulties in Repairing Sad Mood With Happy Memories?\\" (PDF). May, 2004. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Vol 113(2), pp. 179–88. There are two ways to recall these memories, abstractly and concretely. An abstract recollection of memories consists of a kind of comparison between an individual's memory and their current situation. This can sometimes be helpful unless the individual suffers from depression. A concrete recollection is when a memory is recalled especially vividly and the individual experiences the phenomenology of this memory more acutely. This has been used extensively even among those suffering with clinical depression. Music Music is often used for two different reasons in mood repair strategies. The first is to allow the listener to identify themselves with the current music and to allow for some ventilation or mood attenuation. The other is a form of mood-repair strategy which allows the listener to take action to achieve their desired mood. These two approaches are considered the mood-congruent listening approach and the mood-incongruent listening approach, respectively. Listening to music in a mood-congruent state with those who are experiencing negative mood states such as dysphoria, or sadness, can allow for those individuals to be more likely to identify with the music that shares their current mood. This mood-congruency effect can allow for individuals engaging in the listening of mood-congruent music to become increasingly aware of their own mood. It is theorized that with a heightened sense of mood recognition, an individual is capable of being empowered by recognizing that the current mood is their own, and they are in control of their mood. With a greater sense of empowerment over one’s emotional state, individuals can take steps in which to take their control and change their current unwanted mood. The acknowledgment of a person’s mood is a critical precursor in attempts made to regulate moods. Listening to music in a mood-incongruent state, such as someone sad listening to happy music, allows for possible mood attenuation through distraction, and enforces positive thoughts for the individual such as feelings of happiness, encouragement, a sense of hope, a change in perception, etc. In mood attenuation through distraction people are allowed time to “cool off” and let their heightened mood dwindle. Enforcing feelings of positivity can allow for the participant to model his or her actions and behaviors towards ones that are congruent with the type of music that is being used. Social support While many forms of mood repair strategies are individualistic in their approach, social support allows for individuals to engage in form of repair that focuses on others. Social support can occur in many ways. Ventilation is a form of social support in which a participant is able to “vent” his or her current cause of the undesirable mood. This allows for the emotion to be released from any form of tension due to an individual ruminating on the issue and open for a reinterpretation by the listener. Gratification is a pleasurable reaction in response to a communication of the cause of unwanted mood. This type of gratification can be a reward for the participant in releasing the tension carried by the cause of the mood and a feeling of relief. Spending time with someone and engaging in an emotional activity are also considered to be forms of social support. These forms of social support allow for an individual to become distracted from the cause of the issue and allow for time to go by and allow for a process of mood attenuation. Engaging in emotional activities contrary to the emotions the participant is currently experiencing, like helping others or experiencing pleasure things, may also increase the speed of attenuation by diverting the focus of their mood towards other things.Thayer, R. E., Newman, J., & McClain, T. M. (1994). Self- regulation of mood: Strategies for changing a bad mood, raising energy, and reducing tension. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 67(5), 910–25. Active mood management Relaxation techniques are often used as mood- repair strategies to help an individual achieve a level of calm and reduce the stress or tension that can come from negative moods. These techniques are often very methodical in their approach and can be actively engaged by willing participants who are aware of how to enact them. Meditation and conscious control of breathing are two common examples. Exercise is used to help individuals alleviate unwanted moods by physically engaging the body to activate endorphins. These endorphins bring about a sense of euphoria and can alleviate undesirable moods by participants that focus on engaging this euphoria. Exercise can also serve to distract individuals by allowing their focus to be on a specific task, such as focusing on lifting weights, or getting across the finish line, allowing less room for rumination on negative thoughts. Stress Management activities are used for mood repair strategies and the stress that is typically accompanied by them. By coping with stress through a variety of techniques individuals are able to learn how to manage their day-to-day lives and the stimuli that can be known to cause stress. Sex Sex is a form of direct tension reduction, which puts it in the same category as things like the consumption of drugs and alcohol. Generally engaging in sexual intercourse is a much safer and less destructive alternative to the other direct tension reducing measures. To those in a healthy, committed relationship it can prove to be a very beneficial mood repair strategy. Sexual intercourse’s main purpose in mood repair is the releasing of tension. It activates the release of oxytocin in the brain that serves to calm nerves, relax muscles, and induce brief euphoria. These results each have a positive effect on unwanted moods and in combination they present a powerful reaction. The second major reason that sex constitutes as a mood repair strategy is because of the feelings of closeness it creates between the two people engaging in the action. The intimacy involved in sex serves as an important counter to the feelings of loneliness and isolation that often contribute to sadness or depression. Humor Humor is also a known mood- repair strategy. Humor is able to bring about a sense of attenuation and allow for individuals to engage in pleasurable activities. Engaging in activities that can evoke a humorous response can often lead individuals to laughter. Laughter is able to increase serotonin levels which are known to bring about a greater level of contentment.Matthew, J. and Paulose, C. S. (2011), The healing power of well-being.

The reticulocytes are the cells with the dark blue dots and curved linear structures (reticulum) in the cytoplasm. Supravital staining is a method of staining used in microscopy to examine living cells that have been removed from an organism. It differs from intravital staining, which is done by injecting or otherwise introducing the stain into the body. Thus a supravital stain may have a greater toxicity, as only a few cells need to survive it a short while. The term \\"vital stain\\" is used by some authors to refer specifically to an intravital stain, and by others interchangeably with a supravital stain, the core concept being that the cell being examined is still alive. As the cells are alive and unfixed, outside the body, supravital stains are temporary in nature. The most common supravital stain is performed on reticulocytes using new methylene blue or brilliant cresyl blue, which makes it possible to see the reticulofilamentous pattern of ribosomes characteristically precipitated in these live immature red blood cells by the supravital stains. By counting the number of such cells the rate of red blood cell formation can be determined, providing an insight into bone marrow activity and anemia. This is in contrast to vital staining, when the dye employed is one that is excluded from the living cells so that only dead cells are stained positively. (Vital stains include dyes like trypan blue and propidium iodide, which are either too bulky or too charged to cross the cell membrane, or which are actively rapidly pumped out by live cells.) Supravital staining can be combined with cell surface antibody staining (immunofluorescence) for applications such as FACS analysis. Immunofluorescence can also be done within the interior of live cells by reversible cell permeabilization using the detergent Triton X-100. Adjusted carefully to the appropriate concentration for the number of cells, the pretreatment can permit access of molecules between 1 and 150 kilodaltons to the interior of the cell. Although antibodies may be used in a similar way in this context, the term \\"supravital stain\\" is typically reserved for smaller chemicals which possess suitable properties intrinsically. ==Examples of common supravital dyes== Supravital dyes for RBCs:2011 Hematology, Clinical Microscopy, and Body Fluids Glossary by CAP * New methylene blue * Brilliant cresyl blue * Crystal violet * Methyl violet * Nile blue * Hoechst stain ==References== Category:Staining ","title":"Supravital staining"},{"id":"35215342","text":"In mathematics, Gram's theorem states that an algebraic set in a finite- dimensional vector space invariant under some linear group can be defined by absolute invariants. .

Hedwig was a sister of Christian the Younger of Brunswick, \\"the mad Bishop of Halberstadt\\". Hedwig married on 7 February 1619 in Wolfenbüttel to Ulrich, Duke of Pomerania (1589-1622), Bishop of Cammin. The wedding feast was very costly; it was attended by 16 ruling princes.

G. Elwert, Marburg, 1981, p. 26–46 She wore mourning clothes for the rest of her life, and devoted herself to charity. She organized the poor relief and made considerable donations to the local church. Hedwig was described as brave, beautiful and wise. She was a talented lute player and hymn author. She probably wrote the well-known . During her lifetime, almost all of her siblings died, the House of Griffins died out (the last Duke had supported her financially) and during the Thirty Years' War both Swedish and Imperial troops ravaged and confiscated her territory. Her complaints to her cousins King Christian IV of Denmark and Queen Christina of Sweden were unsuccessful. In 1630, she fled to Bobolice to evade the plague. In 1631, she appointed Gregor Lagus, who was Rector of the Latin school at Kołobrzeg as provost in Szczecinek, despite opposition from Duke Bogislaw XIV. Lagus became her leading co-author of a book on Evangelical education. In 1640, she founded a school, which was later named after her: the \\"Princess Hedwig School\\". She left her money to a foundation, on the condition that the school continued to exist in Szczecinek, which made later attempts to move the school to another town impossible.Provinzial-Landtag im Herzogthum Pommern und Fürstenthum Rügen: Verhandlungen des ...

The attempt to take her hostage was probably related to her negotiations to receive an inheritance to supplement her dwindling revenues. In her last will she named Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg as her heir. Hedwig died of smallpox in 1650, at the age of 56. She was finally buried in the Pomeranian ducal crypt in Rügenwalde in 1654. == References == * Friedrich Wilhelm Barthold: Geschichte von Rügen und Pommern, vol. 4, part 2, F.

Smith's role on the teams he played for was that of the enforcer, which led the Hanover, Massachusetts, native to average 6.73 penalty minutes per game over his 60-game career. Smith's book was later adapted into the comedy film Goon (2011), starring Seann William Scott in the role based on Smith. A sequel followed, entitled Goon: Last of the Enforcers (2017). ==Biography== Smith's athletic career started with boxing, which culminated in a split-decision loss in the Massachusetts heavyweight Golden Gloves final in 1984. While training at the Hanover Police Boys' Club, his friend, Adam Frattasio, encouraged him to try hockey fighting. He first laced up skates at the age of 19, played in amateur leagues at 21, and made his first minor-league hockey team at 24 when he won a championship with the Carolina Thunderbirds of the first-year East Coast Hockey League during the 1988-89 season. Smith went on to play for six other teams in three leagues, his most productive tour being with the Miramichi Gagnon Packers of the New Brunswick Senior Hockey League. Smith received additional invitations to continue playing in the States, particularly to finish out seasons for teams in various lower minor-leagues, but his new job as a police officer in Massachusetts limited his opportunities to participate in sporadic games with the intention of fighting the opponent's toughest player(s). After retiring from hockey, Smith has worked as a coach within the Boston Bruins organization, showing their players how to defend themselves. He enjoyed a 20-year stint as an assistant coach for the three-time state-champion Hanover High School hockey team, and has logged significant time as an on-ice official, including two years patrolling the ice in the professional Federal Hockey League. He continues to work as an on-ice hockey-fight trainer, working with such NHL heavyweights as Steve MacIntyre and John Scott. Additionally, Smith is a police officer, currently with the Hanson police department since 1999. Smith is married and helps care for his two young daughters with his wife, Sharon. ==Awards and accomplishments== *1988-89, Riley Cup winner (Carolina Thunderbirds) *2012, Hanover High School Hockey Hall of Fame inductee ==Career statistics== { BORDER=\\"0\\" CELLPADDING=\\"1\\" CELLSPACING=\\"0\\" width=\\"90%\\"  - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"6\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

It shared its wheelbase and inherited most of its engines from its predecessor, but the bodies were completely new. In October 1982 the Rekord E was extensively reworked, retaining the central portion of the body, the same windows and the principal elements of the substructure, but with redesigned front and back ends, and with several significant new engines. The pre- and post-facelift versions are commonly referred to as the E1 and E2, respectively. The Rekord E's nine-year production run was far longer than that of any previous generation of Opel Rekord. It became the third Opel Rekord to exceed a million units produced, but it took longer to reach that target than its predecessor. By now eye watering increases in fuel prices had persuaded many middle market customers to downsize. The Opel Rekord was perceived as a large family car even in its West German home market where, traditionally, family cars were a little larger than in southern Europe. The Rekord (and later the Omega) would also come under pressure from the entry-level models of German luxury brands such as BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz - the beginning of an industry trend which would, by the end of the 1990s, see mass market brands abandon the D/E-segment completely. The Rekord E was sold in the UK badged as the Vauxhall Carlton, initially identified by a reworked bonnet/hood panel, and after 1982 differentiated by little more than the badges. Despite the UK branding, the Carltons were all produced at Rüsselsheim, leaving Vauxhall's British plants to concentrate on Cavaliers, Chevettes, Vivas and their successors. The car was developed by Opel and a direct development of a succession of previous Opel Rekords, but during the closing decades of the twentieth century General Motors displayed a growing strategic interest in internationalizing their products, and the underpinnings of the Rekord E became known as the General Motors \\"V-platform\\". Cars based on the Rekord E (V-platform) were also built at several General Motors plants outside Europe. ==Opel Rekord E1 (1977 - 1982)== The car Despite sharing its wheelbase and, at least initially, its engine range with the car it replaced, the Opel Rekord E as launched at the 1977 Frankfurt Motor Show was slightly wider, slightly longer, slightly higher and, with larger windows, significantly heavier than the Opel Rekord D. Inside it was noticeably more spacious. Plaudits for the technologically impressive (though commercially unsuccessful) NSU Ro 80, introduced in 1968, had prompted a revived interest in aerodynamics among West German automakers, and the Rekord E came with claims of an improved drag coefficient of 0.42 Cd.) In 1982 the facelifted \\"E2\\" version was released with drag coefficient of 0.36. Of a generally smoother appearance, this version featured redesigned, more aerodynamic front and rear ends, and a reshuffling of engines and equipment levels. The E2 Vauxhall Carltons were distinguishable from Opel Rekords only by their badging, with no sheet metal differences present. Design Bodywork By this stage most Opel Rekords came with four doors For UK consumers, the Rekord E1 based Vauxhall Carlton was identified by a \\"droop snoot\\" bonnet/hood. The Rüsselsheim plant produced both right hand drive Rekords and Carltons which, until 1981, competed with each other in the United Kingdom. Two-door sedans and three-door station wagons still represented a significant proportion of Opel Rekord production Most buyers of the estate/station wagon nevertheless opted for a second set of doors, permitting direct access for the back seat passengers. This is the Vauxhall Carlton version of the estate/station wagon. The monocoque steel bodied cars offered seating for five. The top seller was the saloon/sedan. It was available with either two or four doors, although by now the West German market, which had for many years retained an appetite for larger cars with just two doors, was becoming more like the other major automarkets of western Europe in expecting cars the size of the Rekord to provide rear seat passengers with their own doors. The four-door Rekord comfortably outsold its two-door sibling.Oswald, p 296: Opel Rekord E1 \\"Limousine\\" (sedan/saloon) production of 769,086 cars splits between 127,544 2-door cars and 641,542 4-door cars. Opel Rekord E1 \\"CarAVan\\" (estate/station wagon) production of 167,501 cars splits between 26,652 2-door cars and 140,849 4-door cars. There was also a \\"Kombi\\" station wagon with three or five doors, accounting for approximately 20% of Rekord E1 sales. Opel also offered a three-door delivery van combining the driving experience of a car with the load carrying capability of a small commercial vehicle: this was in most respects identical to the station wagon except that the rear side windows were replaced with metal panels. This configuration of vehicles offered self-employed small traders tax advantages in some countries. 30,477 Kasten-Lieferwagen (delivery van) Opel Rekord E1s were produced.Oswald, p 296 For the first time since 1961 no Opel Rekord coupé was listed. However, customers wishing to enjoy style at the expense of rear seat headroom had not been abandoned to the competition, having been catered for since September 1970 by the company's stylish new Manta.  Petrol engines  Opel had introduced a new generation of petrol/gasoline engines in 1966 with the Rekord B and these were the engines that reappeared in the Rekord E in 1977. As before, the stroke length was fixed at 69.8 mm: differences in engine size were achieved by varying the cylinder bore. The engine featured an unusual Camshaft in Head (CIH) configuration. The chain-driven camshaft was positioned directly above the cylinders but this was not a conventional ohc design. The camshaft operated the valves using rocker arms because the camshaft itself was positioned too low above the cylinders to permit direct action from the camshaft on the valves ends. One reason for this may have been cosmetic. Opel's so-called (CIH) engine configuration allowed the Rekord to incorporate the low bonnet/hood lines that style-conscious product development departments called for. The smallest power unit at launch was a 1698 cc engine with the low 8.0:1 compression ratio and 44 kW (60 hp) as on the predecessor. The engine had seen its power output reduced during its time in the previous model following the reduction in standard octanes on West German forecourts in response to reductions in permissible lead levels in motor fuel. This, combined with the increased weight, of the Rekord E to provide rather an underpowered package. The engine presumably cost much the same to produce as similarly configured larger engines and from the point of view of the costing department it no doubt made sense that customers specifying a car with this \\"1.7N\\" engine were, according to the manufacturer's price list, charged exactly the same as customer specifying the greater power (and barely enhanced fuel economy) available from the Rekord E when power by the low compression \\"1.9N\\" engine. Few Rekord E customers selected the 1.7 litre engine and it disappeared from the list in 1980. The more popular entry level power unit during the early years of the Rekord E was the 1897 cc engine, also with a low compression ratio and so content to use basic grade low octane petrol/gasoline. Powered by this unit, the Rekord E's maximum claimed power output was 55 kW (75 hp), just as it had been when the same unit was fitted in the Rekord D. Two years before production of the Rekord D came to an end, Opel had added to its engine palette a bored out 1979 cc version of their (CIH) engine, and this engine size reappeared in the Rekord E1 with three different power output levels, being 66 kW (90 PS), 74 kW (100PS) and 81 kW (110) PS. The first of these, known as the \\"2.0N\\" came with a low 8:1 compression ratio and used basic grade fuel. The 74 kW unit, the \\"2.0S\\", had a 9:1 compression ratio and drivers using this engine were required to pay for \\"super\\" grade higher octane fuel. Available from the time of introduction, the new 81 kW \\"2.0E\\" engined Rekord also called for higher octane fuel and was the first Opel Rekord to feature fuel injection. This was rendered the more significant because during the 1980s legislators across western Europe would require automakers to fit catalytic converters to petrol/gasoline fueled cars, and these would need to be used in conjunction with fuel injection because of a belief at the time that the imprecision of the fuel amounts injected with traditional carbureters created a risk of unburnt fuel emerging from the engine and burning or exploding in the converter, permanently and expensively damaging it. However, when the Rekord E was introduced in 1977 the challenges of catalytic converters, although already a familiar current challenge for General Motors in North America, were still a few years ahead for the European automakers. The Fuel injection system on the Rekord E came from Bosch who had already acquired extensive expertise of the relevant technologies working with Volkswagen. The system employed on the first fuel injected Rekords was the Bosch L Jetronic system, replaced towards the end of 1981 with the LE Jetronic. Rekord 1981 was also equipped with methanol resistant fuel system. Diesel engines The 2068 cc diesel engine with which in 1972 Opel had made their bid for a slice of the lucrative stranglehold that Mercedes-Benz enjoyed over the taxi market reappeared on launch in the Rekord E still offering 44 kW (60 PS) of maximum power. However, the new car was heavier than its predecessor and the market had also developed in the intervening half decade. Just a year later, in August 1978, the larger bored out 2244 cc version for which 48 kW (65 PS) was claimed was introduced. The smaller 2.1 was soon discontinued. As before, the diesel engine was taller than the petrol units designed for the Rekord and diesel powered Rekord Es were differentiated by a long hump shaped ridge along the centre of the bonnet /hood, necessary to accommodate the engine block. Usually equipped with the larger 2.3 litre engine, the diesel Rekords were particularly popular in France, Italy, and the Benelux countries. By now Ford were also looking for a share of the taxi market with a Peugeot-powered diesel version of their Granada model and Peugeot's own diesel powered 504 was itself becoming an increasingly serious competitor, especially in shared European export markets. The diesel powered Rekord E matched its competitors in many respects and - at least in terms of undiscounted published prices - was generally cheaper than the Mercedes models, but somehow Mercedes-Benz continued to dominate the taxi market in Germany and the surrounding western countries. For markets - notably Italy but also Belgium - where car tax increased savagely for car with engine capacities above two litres, a reduced diesel engine of 1998 cc with a maximum power output of just was available. This was the engine more usually specified for diesel powered versions of the smaller, lighter Opel Ascona. Top speed of a 2.0 D with the optional automatic transmission is a leisurely . Rekords with this engine were assembled in Indonesia as well, with three-door panel van or station wagon bodywork. Transmission The standard transmission package was a manual all-synchromesh four speed gearbox, controlled using a centrally positioned floor mounted gear lever. There were plans to offer a new five- speed transmission, as in the Opels Senator and Monza, but when, in the summer of 1980, this was still not ready the manufacturer instead offered to buyers of the 1,979 cc petrol/gasoline powered Rekords, for an extra DM 520, the option of a newly developed four-speed manual transmission incorporating an overdrive: this was intended to provide the chance to achieve improved fuel economy at a time when fuel efficiency was moving up the agenda of European car buyers coming to terms with the belief that the \\"era of cheap fuel\\" was over for good. Nevertheless, relatively few customers opted for the \\"four speeds with overdrive\\" transmission option. Buyers could also specify a three- speed automatic transmission. The system used was the three-speed TH180 unit from the manufacturer's transmission plant in Strasbourg. Suspension At the front the suspension was redesigned, now incorporating MacPherson struts. The result was more compact, lighter, and probably cheaper to assemble than the uneven wishbone arrangements on the previous model, and the car's handling benefitted. Unfortunately Opel approached the Rekord's suspension upgrade \\"one end at a time\\", however. At the back the Rekord E retained from the previous model a beam axle tamed with four trailing connector arms, a Panhard rod like system and an anti-roll bar, in combination with coil springs and shock absorbers. Commentators felt that by now the rigid-rear axle based rear suspension fell short of mainstream west European standards in terms of the handling characteristics that it provided. However, customers wishing for more control over the back axle during fast bumpy rides could specify a \\"sports package\\" in the Opel Rekord E: the package included replacement of the standard oil-filled shock absorbers at the back of the car by gas-filled shocks. There will no doubt have been a trade-off in terms of a firmer ride in exchange for reduced wallow. Brakes The braking configuration was also essentially that from the previous Rekords, with a dual circuit hydraulically controlled system along with the brake servo as before, and incorporating, on larger engined versions, a brake force limiter for the rear brakes. The car used disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the back. There was a handbrake control light included in order to discourage drivers from setting off without fully releasing the handbrake. Trim and equipment packages and special editions Various different packages of trims and options were offered. These was a \\"base\\" Rekord, a luxury version branded as the \\"Rekord Luxus\\" and a \\"Rekord Berlina\\" which offered a still more opulent level of comfort and equipment. On the outside all cars other than the base version featured a rubber \\"protection strip\\" along the side of the car, and further differentiation was apparent from the differing levels of chrome trim and differently shaped steel wheels. On the inside trim qualities and fabrics varied according to version, and the \\"Berlina\\" featured a steering wheel with four thin spokes rather than two thick ones. Between 1977 and 1982 the precise details of which items were included in which trim package was periodically modified. The extensive list of optional extras included a \\"Sports package\\" offered on all except the 1.7 litre cars, including various extra dials on the dash-board, halogen head-lights and gas filled shock absorbers for the rear wheels. Customers could also choose from a range of radios and speakers. One of the most eye catching options, featured for the first time on an Opel Rekord, was air conditioning, but for this feature the price was provided only \\"on application\\". The very small number of Rekord E1s delivered with air- conditioning suggests that the prices quoted were very high, and that air- conditioning was more a marker for Opel's future than a realistic option for Rekord customers in 1980. The tactic continued of stimulating sales at quiet times of year by offering special editions - cars equipped with a package of options and advertised at a lower price than the buyer would face if simply equipping a Rekord with the same options from the standard price list. With the Rekord E1 the special editions included the \\"Rekord Regent\\", the \\"Rekord Royale\\", the \\"Rekord Classic\\", the \\"Rekord Touring\\" and the \\"Rekord SR/E\\".

Nevertheless, the automarket in West Germany and the surrounding countries had grown substantially in the 1960s and (if somewhat erratically) the 1970s. West Germany remained Europe's largest automarket, and here the latest Rekord did not dominate the market for family cars in the way Rekords had done fifteen years earlier. Data from long-standing rival, Ford Germany, showed the Ford Granada/Consul being produced at a far higher rate than the Rekord, with 1,619,265 cars produced between 1972 - 1977, although these figures did not take into account the large proportion of Granadas sold in the UK, another major European auto-market and one where the Granada inherited the market niche formerly occupied by the home grown Ford Zephyr.The UK was also unusual in the extent to which the national market was dominated by a single automaker at this time, as Ford of Britain continued to benefit from the ongoing collapse of British Leyland. Back in West Germany, Audi now enjoyed the commitment and financial backing of Volkswagen enabling them in due course to expand production at their Ingolstadt facility in response to demand of the Audi 100. Between 1976 and 1982 Audi produced 896,299 Audi 100 models, while between 1977 and 1982 Opel produced 962,218 Opel Rekord E1s. Half a class down Volkswagen's competent and modern Passat captured the mood of the market place, seducing potential Opel customers in a way the K70 had not. Half a class up from the Rekord BMW, close to bankruptcy in the early 1960s, now had the financial muscle to invest in growing production capacity for their 5 series at their own new plant in Dingolfing. The Opel Rekord retained a powerful position in the market place, but that position was increasingly constrained on several fronts. By the time the Rekord E1 was replaced, in 1982, by the extensively upgraded Opel Rekord E2, Opel Rekords were losing market share, and the Rekord E2 would be produced at a significantly lower rate than the Rekord E1.

However, to cope with Australian conditions it was strengthened substantially and used the Senator's nose (like the Opel Commodore) to accommodate the Holden straight-six and V8 engines. Vauxhall Carlton The first Vauxhall Carlton was an Opel Rekord E adapted for the United Kingdom market. At the front it featured a different bonnet/hood echoing the \\"droop-snoot\\" front, as also used on the Chevette and Cavalier. The Carlton quietly succeeded the (by then long since discontinued) Vauxhall Victor FE, and was joined by the short lived Vauxhall Viceroy, a rebadged Commodore C. In the UK both models were outsold by the Ford Granada. At the back, between the rear light clusters, where the Rekord provided space for the license plate holder, the Carlton was provided with a black panel on which the word \\"Vauxhall\\" was spelled out in upper case letters. Carlton owners were expected to mount their rear license plates slightly lower than on the Rekord, screwed directly onto the bumper. There was only a single trim package offered for the Carlton, corresponding approximately with the \\"Rekord Berlina\\", and only one engine could be ordered with the Carlton, being the 1,979 cc 74 kW (100 PS) \\"2.0S\\" unit. The Carlton and the Rekord were assembled on the same production line at the manufacturer's Rüsselsheim plant, and until 1982 right hand drive versions of both cars competed together in the UK market. Buyers attracted by the Carlton but looking for a trim and engine combination not featured on the Vauxhall could accordingly choose a car from the Opel Rekord range. From 1982, the facelifted E2 Vauxhall Carltons were distinguishable from Opel Rekords only by their badging, with no sheet metal differences. Chevrolet Rekord The Rekord E1 was sold in South Africa where initially it was branded as the Chevrolet Rekord, with either the four-door sedan or the five-door wagon bodywork. It was first announced in early July 1978, in standard or GL versions. It was powered by a locally produced small-bore version of Chevrolet's \\"153\\" four-cylinder engine, of 2,319 cc and at 4,800 rpm. The Rekord was soon followed by the more luxurious Chevrolet Commodore, with which it shared most of its bodywork. Import duties in South Africa were prohibitively high, but anticipated volumes did not justify a car plant. The cars were therefore delivered as kits and then assembled at Port Elizabeth. Local modifications, aside from the engine, included particular attention to dust protection. After the fall of 1980 the Chevrolet Rekord was also available with the 1,979 cc four as used in Europe, with 100 PS (74 kW). File:Chevrolet Rekord 1978 01a.jpgChevrolet Rekord in Swellendam File:Chevrolet Rekord 1978 01c.jpgChevrolet Rekord in Swellendam File:Chevrolet Rekord interior.jpgChevrolet Rekord in Swellendam Saehan Rekord The Saehan Rekord and Saehan Royale were Korean built versions of the Opel Rekord E1. The General Motors company which assembled them later became known as Daewoo and the car became known as the Daewoo Royale and continued to be based on the Rekord E1 till 1985, by which time Rüsselsheim had been producing the upgraded Rekord E2 for more than two years. The Korean cars came with a choice of 3 Camshaft in Head (CIH) engines, all of them delivered from Germany by Opel. The petrol/gasoline engine sizes were 1,492 cc, 1,897 cc, and 1,979 cc, and the maximum power outputs were respectively 60, 85 and 102 PS. All three engines were broadly similar and they shared the same 69.8 mm piston stroke, with the variation in overall displacement achieved by varying the cylinder bore, although the smallest of them had not been fitted to a German assembled Opel Rekord since being phased out in 1970 during the time of the Opel Rekord C. From May 1980 the Korean car was also available with a 1,998 cc diesel unit. This was the same unit as used in Europe to power diesel Rekords in markets such as Italy with taxation regimes that punished cars with engines of above two litres capacity. Claimed top speed with this diesel unit was just 130 km/h (81 mph). Despite using European engines, the Korean petrol/gasoline fueled cars rejected the German cars' Solex carbureters, using Nikki-Stromberg ones instead. Body panel pressings came not from Europe but from Holden in Australia who were producing their own Rekord derived model, although the Australian car was closer to the slightly longer Opel Senator, itself a lengthened version of the Rekord E. == Opel Rekord E2 (1982 - 1986) == In September 1982 the Rekord E received a major upgrade. The upgrade might have been held out as marking a new Opel Rekord, but it was not: the manufacturer continued to use the \\"Rekord E\\" designation. Subsequently, Rekords assembled in Rüsselsheim between 1977 and 1982 have become known as Rekord E1s, and those assembled in that plant between 1982 and 1986 have become known as Rekord E2s. However, in other continents where the Rekord was assembled, the Rekord E2 replaced the Rekord E1 later than in Europe. The E2 also marked the end of Carlton production at Vauxhall's Luton plant - with the Vauxhall brand dropped in all GM Europe markets outside the UK, all Vauxhall Carlton-badged Rekord E2s were now also assembled at Rüsselsheim. This would continue for the next two generations of Opel Omega which followed. The rear was also redesigned, with a taller profile than the E1 Ever since the introduction of the first diesel powered Opel Rekord in 1972, the diesel engine had been too tall for the standard car's engine compartment, giving rise to a hump shaped ridge along the centre of the bonnet/hood. Diesel powered Rekord Es continued the tradition. After 1982 it became impossible to distinguish between a Vauxhall Carlton and an Opel Rekord without getting close enough to see the badges on the wheels. This is a Vauxhall Carlton. The new car shared the basic chassis components from the E1. The shape of the central portion of the car was unchanged. But there were several new engines, and the front hood was reshaped to give a smoother profile. At the back was a higher boot/trunk than before which improved aerodynamics and also marginally increased luggage capacity from . The apparently minor changes in the shapes of the ends of the car, together with tighter tolerances applied to major pressings which permitted a reduction in the panel gaps on the car body, enabled the manufacturer to boast of an improved aerodynamic profile which marginally improved performance and reduced fuel consumption. The published drag coefficient was reduced from 0.42 Cd on the Rekord E1 to 0.36 Cd on the Rekord E2. The Opel Rekord D had been seen by many enthusiasts as a good looking car: the styling of the E1 had met with a more mixed reception. Opel now used the extra length at the car's ends to produce a Rekord E2 with more conventionally mainstream proportions than those of the short-nosed E1. The Rekord E was initially available in three equipment levels: standard, De Luxe, and Berlina.De Leener, p. 121 In March 1983 the luxurious CD model appeared, plugging the small gap left by the disappearance of the Commodore. For the light 1985 model year facelift (introduced in July 1984) the names of the equipments changed: the standard became the LS, the De Luxe became the GL, and the Berlina was now the GLS. The CD remained. Design Bodywork The monocoque steel bodied cars offered seating for five. Ten years earlier the Opel Rekord had come with a wide choice of body types, but coupé and coach-built cabriolet had already gone, and with the 1982 introduction of the Rekord E2 the manufacturer also withdrew the two door saloon/sedan. This left just a choice between a four-door saloon/sedan and a three- or five-door estate/station wagon. A delivery van version of the Rekord E2 remained in production, but only 8,958 of these were produced between 1982 and 1986 as against 30,477 Rekord E1 based vans produced between 1977 and 1982. Despite the wheelbase being unchanged, the overhangs had increased, and the Rekord E2, yet again, was a little longer than the car it replaced. In fact it was exactly the same length as the recently upgraded but rather more prestigious BMW 5-series. Petrol engines With the arrival of the E2, the low compression \\"1.7N\\", \\"1.9N\\" and \\"2.0N\\" engines disappeared from the Rekord, to be replaced by engines from a new range that had first appeared in 1981, albeit in 1.6 litre format on the Ascona C and Kadett D models. Featuring a light metal cylinder head and a conventional overhead camshaft this unit presumably had fewer moving parts in the valvegear than the more singular Camshaft in Head (CIH) unit that had powered Opel Rekords since 1965. For the Rekord E2 a 1796 cc version of the engine was fitted. This 1.8 litre engine, in its 66 kW (90 PS) version had in fact already become available a few months earlier in the Opel Manta. In this format, the \\"1.8S\\" engine employed a single twin chamber carbureter and, with a compression ratio of 9.2:1, required higher octane \\"super\\" grade fuel. For economy minded customers an entry level version of the 1796 cc engine was offered with a more basic carbureter and compression ratio of 8.2:1. In this configuration the \\"1.8N\\" engine provided a claimed maximum power output of 55 kW (75 PS), slightly less performance and slightly better fuel economy. However, at least in the manufacturer's own advertised prices, the \\"1.8S\\" and \\"1.8N\\" engined cars were sold at the same price. As a subsidiary of a corporation headquartered in the US, Opel had more reason than most European automakers to access and understand the increasingly stringent anti-pollution regulations which had effectively enforced the fitting of catalytic converters to cars sold in the US, and now the trend was spreading across the Atlantic. By the time the Rekord E2 appeared in 1982 West Germany had already passed the law that would effectively enforce the use of catalytic converters for cars sold there, though at this stage the industry was still being given time, in West Germany, to prepare for the new laws to come into force: Switzerland and Sweden had already introduced much more stringent standards than other European nations, and catalytic converters began making inroads in the mid-80s. It was still believed that carburettor fed engines were liable to pass unburnt fuel into the exhaust chamber, with potentially damaging results for the converter, so the manufacturer chose to combine the new anti-pollution device with a potentially more precise fuel injection system. Beginning in August of 1985 the Rekord became available in its West German home market with a third version of the 1796 cc engine, designated the \\"1.8 i Kat\\". As the designation indicated, this engine came with fuel injection and a catalytic converter. A maximum 74 kW (100 PS) of power was claimed, and the performance was accordingly enhanced, but the Opel Rekord 1.8 with this engine required \\"super\\" grade fuel which it consumed with indelicate relish. Nevertheless, it was one of the first cars to be offered in West Germany with this level of pollution control. In contrast to the smaller engined cars, for larger engined petrol/gasoline powered Rekord E2s the 1979 cc Camshaft in Head (CIH) engine was carried forward from the previous model. The \\"2.0S\\" version delivered 74 kW (100 PS) as before, though now with a higher compression ratio, the Varajet 2 carburettor and the requirement for \\"super\\" grade higher octane fuel. The \\"2.0E\\" version continued, at launch, as the only Rekord to incorporate fuel injection and in this form it provided maximum power output of 81 kW (110 PS). In 1984 a larger 2197 cc version of the fuel injected four cylinder \\"2.2E\\" engine was introduced, differing from the \\"2.0\\" only because the piston stroke was now extended from 69.8 mm to 77.5 mm. The new car was noted at the time for its unusually strong torque, even at low engine speeds. In West Germany the \\"2.2E\\" powered Rekord E replaced the \\"2.0E\\" car, but in export markets where the two litre threshold was more significant in terms of punitive car tax rates the \\"2.0E\\" engined car continued to be listed. The Rekord's largest export market to retain the \\"2.0E\\" engine for tax reasons was, as previously, Italy, but the \\"2.0E\\" continued to be sold in place of the \\"2.2E\\" in Switzerland and Sweden because the larger engined car was initially unable to meet the new anti-pollution requirements in those countries. Diesel engines The Rekord E2's 2,260 cc diesel unit was carried over unchanged from the E1, still with maximum power output of 46 kW (65 PS). However, a year later, in Autumn 1983, power was increased to 52 kW (68 PS) along with a small increase in torque. At the Geneva Motor Show in March 1984, a turbocharged version of the venerable 2.3 litre diesel was introduced, going on sale a few months later. This was Opel's first turbocharged engine. Power was increased from , meaning that the car performed as well as some petrol versions at the time. Other mechanic differences were slim, limited to better cooling measures (including an oil cooler) and other detail measures. The turbodiesel, only available with a five-speed manual, was also offered in the luxurious \\"CD\\" trim. This engine had already been offered in a diesel powered version of the longer Opel Senator since 1983. Transmission & Suspension The standard transmission package was the manual all-synchromesh four-speed gearbox, controlled using a floor mounted gear change. There was also the option of a Getrag-manufactured five-speed transmission. This became available in 1982, a couple of years later than had been planned. Buyers of all but the smallest engined cars could also still specify a three-speed automatic transmission option. The five-speed had longer gearing than the fourth speed on the first three gears, while fourth remained mostly the same and fifth was an overdrive. This was then compensated for by a longer final drive for the five-speed, although the 1.8 S, which has a lot of low-end torque while being somewhat unwilling to rev, received the same final drive as the four-speed, for an even greater gas mileage improvement.De Leener, p. 126 At the rear, a live axle retained by a panhard rod was employed with an open differential. Differential bushings were added after E2 production had started. Up front, the MacPherson strut layout from the E1 was modified to be more supple. The front stabilizer bar no longer acted as the torque arm; instead, it was attached to the lower A-arm of the front suspension. Stability was also improved by this redesign, while the center of gravity was lowered by about . The springs were changed to variable rate units, allowing for a softer ride with less body roll when driven hard. Steering was by a steering box and drag links. The brakes received somewhat larger pistons for the front discs (drums at the rear), otherwise they remained unchanged.De Leener, p. 127 Commercial Approximately 1.4 million Rekord Es were produced, which made it the third Rekord in succession to sell above a million cars. However, 962,218 were Rekord E1s produced between 1977 and 1982, meaning that after 1982 the Rekord E2 was selling at less than 60% of the annualised rate of the E1. In part it was a victim of the success of the company's own Ascona which pushed the Rekord upmarket, but as it moved upmarket it moved ever closer to the prestige models being sold in ever higher volumes. Although the advertised prices - at least to private buyers - for cars such as the Mercedes-Benz W123, the 5 series BMW and the Audi 100 - were considerably higher than those for the Rekord, the gap was smaller than it had been and, increasingly, customers paying for a car this size were willing to pay for the prestige brands. The higher purchase prices of the upscale brands were also mitigated by a higher value retention. Opel were not alone in having their largest family cars squeezed out by the prestige brands, and the Peugeot 604, Renault 20/30 and Ford Granada along with their increasingly marginalised successors all fell victim to the same phenomenon during the closing decades of the twentieth century, while mainstream volume automakers outside Europe sought to address the same issues by launching, with varying degrees of success, new premium brands such as Lexus, Infiniti and Eunos. For the time being Opel persisted with the large family car segment, and at the end of the summer in 1986 the Rekord was replaced on the Rüsselsheim production lines by the more aerodynamic yet Opel Omega.

In this case, the car lost its distinctive hood/bonnet at the front and became, in most respects, indistinguishable from the Rekord. Whereas the first generation of Carlton had been offered with a single engine and a single trim package, the 1982 Carlton was available with several of the engines from the Rekord's palette, as well as several of the Rekord's trim options. General Motors in Europe now followed the logic arising from the end of separately designed Vauxhalls, and after 1982 there were no more Opel Rekord badged cars exported to the UK. Right hand drive Rekords continued to be produced at Rüsselsheim for certain right hand drive markets - notably Ireland - where the Opel name plate was thought to enjoy wider customer acceptance than the Vauxhall one. Opel Rekord in South Africa In South Africa the Opel Rekord switched from the E1 to the E2 version only in 1984, General Motors's South African subsidiary having changed from the Chevrolet brand name two years earlier. The old pushrod 2.3 was retired, with the facelifted versions receiving the 1,979 cc four as used in Europe, with ( for the fuel-injected version). It continued to be assembled in South Africa until the early 1990s, long after the German model itself had been replaced. The 2.0 engine was joined in 1984 by the \\"2.2E\\" engines. From mid-1991 the cars became available with a 3.8 litre V6 engine with originating with General Motors' Holden subsidiary in South Australia. This largely replaced the earlier Commodore, which, unlike its German counterparts had continued to be available after the mid-life facelift. The Commodore was only available with the fuel injected 30E engine.1984 Opel Commodore 3.0 E (South Africa) The 3.8 liter Rekord 380i GSi had an advertised top speed of , making it substantially faster than any listed Opel Rekord from the factory in Germany, while the automatic-only CD model could reach . On the other hand, the CD reached faster, as a result of being able to reach the ton in second gear. In addition to a full equipment (slightly less ample for the sportier GSi), the Rekord 380i also received the Omega's independent rear suspension and power assisted rack-and-pinion steering to help handle the extra power. The interior was upgraded with a new dash and a sporty steering wheels and seats, while the exterior received ten-spoke alloy wheels and a rear spoiler.Road Test (CAR), p. 117 Until 1986 the Opel Rekord was assembled by General Motors South Africa in Port Elizabeth, but as a result of an international sanctions regime General Motors were not permitted to invest further after 1986. The business was transferred through a management buy-out to a new company called the Delta Motor Corporation, and it was under this arrangement that Rekord E2s were assembled in South Africa until the 1990s, using kits shipped from Rüsselsheim. In another minor facelift, the later South African Rekords featured the Opel badge mounted above rather than within the grille, similar to the smaller Kadetts of the era. Saehan / Daewoo Royale At the end of 1984 the Rekord E2 became the basis for the Korean assembled Saehan Royale, which until then had continued to be based on the Rekord E1. The engines remained, as before, the Rekord's 1492 cc, 1897 cc and 1979 cc units. Until 1983 the Korean cars had been branded as Saehan Rekords and Saehan Royales, but after that date the Rekord name was dropped and they were all branded as Royales. Some time later, reflecting a change in the corporate structure, the \\"Saehan\\" name was replaced by \\"Daewoo\\". Around this time the rear end design was changed for one similar to that of an early Senator. Later in the 1980s body panels shipped in from Holden's South Australian factory were replaced by local stampings, and in 1987 the front and rear panels of the car were reshaped and modernized. In other respects the car remained true to its Opel Rekord origins and it continued in Korean production until 1990. == See also == * Opel Rekord * Opel Commodore * Daewoo Royale == References == * == External links == * Infoseite Opel Rekord E1 * Infoseite Opel Rekord E2 Rekord E Category:Sedans Category:Station wagons Category:Executive cars Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Cars introduced in 1977 Category:1980s cars ","title":"Opel Rekord Series E"},{"id":"35215499","text":"The Palazzo Felicini is a Renaissance style palace in Via Riva di Reno 79 in central Bologna, Italy. Detail of a capital of the palace. Photo by Paolo Monti, 1969. Like many of the palaces in the crowded center of Bologna, the piano nobile and facade extends up to the street over an arcaded front. It stands across from the Palazzo Bonasoni. While Aristotele Fioravanti may have performed some work on the palace before departing in the 1470s, the palace, as we see ii today, was built in 1497, for a Bartolomeo Felicini, senator, and member of a prominent banking family. With the defeat of the Giulio II Bentivoglio by the papal forces, a member of the Felicini family was present to the city senate till 1584. The exterior has terracotta decorations. The interiors are frescoed by Angelo Michele Colonna and Giacomo Alboresi (Assumption of the Virgin, Family Chapel); Domenico Santi and Domenico Maria Canuti (Allegory of Aurora, Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne, and Dusk in the piano nobile, 1664); and Death of Phaeton also by Alboresi and Colonna. The palace was sold to the Cardinal Pucci and then the Fibbia family (now also called Palazzo Felicini Fibbia or Felicini poi Fibbia). The palace underwent extensive restorations in 1905. ==Sources== *Salaborsa Site, entry on Palazzo Felicini Category:Houses completed in 1497 Felicini Palazzo Felicini ","title":"Palazzo Felicini, Bologna"},{"id":"35215503","text":"In mathematics, a nullform of a vector space acted on linearly by a group is a vector on which all invariants of the group vanish.

The Kings were formed in 2007 by drummer James Keovongsak and bassist Nate Ayers. Their record label Record Kicks describes them as \\"an eight element proper deep funk and soul outfit from Detroit/Ann Arbor, Michigan, that is influenced by the great James Brown, as well as the many artists from the 60s and 70s whose music was carefully salvaged by the crate digging revolution.\\". The Kings disbanded just short of their 10 year anniversary. ==Band members== In the Summer of 2007, drummer James Keovongsak and bassist Nate Ayers found each other via Craigslist for the project that would become the Third Coast Kings. Originally known as \\"The Monarchs\\", Ayers coined the name \\"Third Coast Kings\\" as a nod to Michigan's musical legacy (Michigan's Great Lakes are known as the \\"Third Coast\\"). After assembling guitarist Andy Filisko, saxophonist Brian Einstein Lassiter, and trumpeter Ryan Dolan, the band performed its first show as TCK on Halloween of 2007 at the Corner Brewery in Ypsilanti, Michigan. 2008 saw the addition of Alec Cooper on the tenor sax, with a brief stint by Heather Schwartz on vocals. In 2009, vocalist Michelle Camilleri joined the band and was featured on their Record Kicks release of \\"Give Me Your Love/Tonic Stride\\" on 45 and digital. In 2011, Ayers left the band to pursue permaculture, Camilleri took a hiatus and the Kings added Terry Kimura on trombone, Sean Ike on vocals and original Monarch's member Steve Barker on bass. ==Notable Performances== The Kings' most high-profile performance was at Fuji Rock Festival '12, where they performed Friday afternoon on the White Stage. The trip was also notable for the fact that it was not only bandleader Keovongsak's first time out of the country, but also his first time on a plane. TCK was also a frequent performer at local and regional events and venues such as the Ann Arbor Summer Festival, Toronto Jazz Festival, Taste of Ann Arbor, Sweet Earth Arts & Music Festival, Brighton Smokin’ Jazz & Barbecue Blues Festival, Kitchener Blues Festival, Cliff Bell's, and others. ==Reception== The Kings' release of \\"Give Me Your Love/Tonic Stride\\" in 2009 garnered attention in the worldwide funk scene. The tracks were played by prominent DJs such as Lance Ferguson and Adrian Gibson, in addition to being featured on Craig Charles' Funk&Soul; Show on BBC 6. Since the release of their video single \\"Spicy Brown\\" and full length self- titled album in March 2012, the Kings have received considerable attention from the blogosphere. THIS IS BOOK'S MUSIC called their music, \\"[a] funky sound that will bring to mind the heat of James Brown‘s deep grooves\\", while SoulTracks.com said \\"Detroit's Third Coast Kings are a 21st Century answer to 20th Century funk.\\" The band has received enthusiastic reviews in the United States, Japan, France, and the U.K. ==Discography== * 'Mo' Record Kicks' (Record Kicks, 2010) * \\"Give Me Your Love/Tonic Stride\\" (Record Kicks, 2010) * 'SoulShaker vol.7' (Record Kicks, 2010) * 'Mo' Record Kicks Act II' (Record Kicks, 2011) * 'Third Coast Kings' (Record Kicks, 2012) * 'West Grand Boulevard' (Record Kicks, 2014) ==References * Official Third Coast Kings Web Page * Third Coast Kings Facebook Page * Third Coast Kings Record Label - Record Kicks (Record Kicks) Category:American soul musical groups Category:American funk musical groups Category:Musical groups from Michigan Category:Musical groups established in 2007 ","title":"Third Coast Kings"},{"id":"35215568","text":"A hudd is a shelter used during funeral services.

Its primary objective is to provide intelligence to maintain air superiority and conduct surveillance. The system is currently in-service with the Indian Air Force. It is a development of the EL/M-2075 system, described by the Federation of American Scientists as the most advanced AEW&C; system in the world under 1993 article.https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/row/phalcon.htm ==Design and features== The EL/W-2090 is a further development of EL/M-2075 and EL/W-2085. The EL/W-2090 uses the active electronically scanned array (AESA), an active phased array radar. This radar consists of an array transmit/receive (T/R) modules that allow a beam to be electronically steered, making a physically rotating rotodome unnecessary. AESA radars operate on a pseudorandom set of frequencies and also have very short scanning rates, which makes them difficult to detect and jam. ==Sales==  Sale to India  In March 2004, as a part of a tri-partite deal among Israel, India, and Russia, Israel and India signed a US$1.1 billion deal according to which IAI would deliver the Indian Air Force three AEW&C; radar systems, each of which was worth approximately $350 million. India signed a deal with Ilyushin of Russia for the supply of three Il-76 A-50 heavy airlifters, which were to be used as platforms for these radar systems, for an additional US $500 million. In 2008, media reports suggested that India and Israel were about to sign a deal for three additional radars. India received its first AWACS on 25 May 2009. It landed in Jamnagar AFB in Gujarat completing its 8 hour long journey from Israel. In November, 2016, India signed another deal to purchase two more AEW&C; radar systems. The deal entails a purchase of further 2 systems of the AWACS for $1billion with deliveries scheduled within the next 3 years.  Cancelled Sale to China  In 1994, Israel entered into talks with China regarding the sale of the Phalcon radar system, initially for four units but with an understanding that as many as eight would be procured. An agreement between China and Israel was signed in July 1996. Russia entered the program in March 1997; the first Il-76 slated for modifications landed in Israel in October 1999. Although the US government was aware of the sale, it remained silent until October 1999, when it publicly opposed the sale of the EL/W-2090 to China. Fearing that the system would alter the military balance in the Taiwan Strait, American officials threatened to withhold aid to Israel in April 2000 if the deal proceeded. On 12 July 2000, Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced that Israel would scrap the deal. However, it was not until July 2000 when a formal letter was sent to the Chinese government; the Israeli government hoped that the newly elected Bush administration would endorse the Phalcon deal. In March 2002, Israel concluded a $350-million compensation package to China, more than the $160-million advance payment China had already made. Subsequently, the original Chinese KJ-2000 AEW&C; entered service in 2004. ==Operators== * - Three in service & two ordered on an Ilyushin Il-76 platform.India set to decide big military aircraft deals ==ReferencesEL/W-2090 official brochure Category:Aircraft radars Category:Military radars of Israel Category:Elta products Category:Military aviation es:EL/M-2075 ko:EL/M-2075 he:פאלקון (מערכת) ro:EL/M-2075 ru:IAI Phalcon tr:EL/M-2075 Phalcon ","title":"EL/W-2090"},{"id":"35215596","text":"Sunrise (stylized as SUNRISE) is the third full-length studio album by Japanese idol group Idoling!!!.

The marquis title and Lord of Chavaniac passed to him from his elder brother, Jacques-Roch du Motier (1711–1734), upon his death on January 18, 1734 while fighting the Austrians at Milan in the War of Polish Succession. ==Career== The Marquis de La Fayette was a colonel in the French Grenadiers and was a Knight of the Order of Saint Louis.

The patent included comprising most of what is now Saratoga County and parts of Montgomery, Schenectady, and Fulton Counties. The grantees were Nanning Hermance (or Hermanse, also called Nanning Visscher), Johannes Beekman, Rip Van Dam, Anne Bridges, Johannes Fisher, John Tudor, Javis Hooglandt, John Stephens, John Latham, and Stephen Broughton. The French and Indian War, and negotiations with the Mohawks delayed the process, and the lands were not surveyed until 1771. The surveyors divided the patent into twenty five allotments, and each allotment was subdivided into thirteen lots of approximately equal size. The grantees \\"drew lots\\" to determine ownership of individual lots within each allotment. ==Precedents== The Kayaderossera Patent was the largest of a series of such grants in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. The Van Schaick Patent granted all of the current town of Waterford and a large section of Half Moon to Anthony Van Schaick in 1687. The Appel Patent in 1708 granted land north of the Mohawk River extending back a distance of three miles to William Appel. The Saratoga Patent granted land bordering the Van Schaick Patent north along the Hudson River to Colonel Peter Schuyler, Robert Livingston, and others. ==Land purchase== Prior to issuing a patent the colonial government required evidence that the land had been legally purchased from its native owners. Samuel Broughton negotiated an agreement with the Mohawks, represented by the sachems Joseph, Hendrick, and Cornelius, apparently representatives of the three clans. In 1702 when the deed was actually signed, however, Cornelius failed to appear and two other representatives signed in his stead. This later formed the basis of litigation by the Mohawks contesting the patent. The legalities were finally settled in 1761 with a negotiated settlement. Nineteenth century histories identified Joseph as Ter-jen-nin-ho-ge and Hendrick as De-han-och- rak-has More recently Hindraker, Snow. and Sivertsen have identified Hendrick as Tejonihokarawa (Tay yon’ a ho ga rau’ a) representing the Wolf Clan. Hindraker and Sivertsen identify Joseph as Dehanochrakhas of the Bear Clan, and Sivertsen identifies Cornelius or Cornelis as Tirogaren representing the Turtle Clan. The patent signed by Governor Cornbury in 1708 originally comprised . ==Survey== In 1762 Christopher Yates and John Glen of Schenectady, and Thomas Palmer of Orange County were appointed to conduct the survey of the patent. The surveyor Charles Webb performed the actual survey, which was completed and filed on December 18, 1770. As of 2012 many deeds in Saratoga County still include a phrase such as \\"part of Lot 3 in the subdiv of Lot One in the Eighteenth general allotment in the Patent of Kayadesessera\\" at the beginning of their property descriptions. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *The People of Colonial Albany Live Here The Colonial Albany Social History Project has biographies of some of the grantees and other players. **Johannes Martense Beekman **Rip Van Dam ** Nanning Harmanse Visscher **Kayaderosseras Category:History of New York (state) Category:Saratoga County, New York ","title":"Kayaderossera patent"},{"id":"35215639","text":"The Sound and the Fury is a 1929 novel by American author William Faulkner.

According to art-historical analysis the manuscript was copied from a model of the 3rd century. == Description == The manuscript was made at Corvey in about the year 825 by a scribe named Hrodgarius. The illustrations were made by three artists, one of them was named Adelricus. It contains illustrations of 141 scenes. Bischoff dated the manuscript between 820–830. It is an example of Carolingian art, but the illustrations follow an antique model. The text of the manuscript in English translation was edited by George Colman in 1768. The Latin text was edited by Christoph Stiegemann and Matthias Wemhoff. The Vatican has digitized the manuscript and added it to its online library, DigiVatLib, as a part of its project to provide free, online access to the Vatican Library's collections of manuscripts and incunabula. == The archetype of the codex == Since the end of the 19th century many scholars tried to estimate the age of the model from which Vaticanus 3868 was copied. According to Weitzmann the latter is a most faithful copy of a late classical original manuscript. On the basis of the art-historical data the original manuscript was dated to the 5th century by Weitzmann, Koehler, and Mütherich. The artist was schooled in the Greco-Asiatic manner. This point of view dominated before World War II. In the 1960s another more detailed art- historical analysis was made. The pictures of female masks were compared with three female masks dated between the years ca. 242ca. 267. The hairstyle of the Terence portrait is close to the one favoured by emperors between the years 238 and 249, suggesting that models from which the codex was copied were made in the 3rd century. == References == ;Citations ;Bibliography * * * == Further reading == * Phormio.

Over a period of hours or days, IMC determines the onset, rate, extent and energetics of such processes for specimens in small ampoules (e.g. 3–20 ml) at a constant set temperature (c. 15 °C–150 °C). IMC accomplishes this dynamic analysis by measuring and recording vs. elapsed time the net rate of heat flow (μJ/sec = μW) to or from the specimen ampoule, and the cumulative amount of heat (J) consumed or produced. IMC is a powerful and versatile analytical tool for four closely related reasons: # All chemical and physical processes are either exothermic or endothermic—produce or consume heat. # The rate of heat flow is proportional to the rate of the process taking place. # IMC is sensitive enough to detect and follow either slow processes (reactions proceeding at a few % per year) in a few grams of material, or processes which generate minuscule amounts of heat (e.g. metabolism of a few thousand living cells). # IMC instruments generally have a huge dynamic range—heat flows as low as ca. 1 μW and as high as ca. 50,000 μW can be measured by the same instrument. The IMC method of studying rates of processes is thus broadly applicable, provides real-time continuous data, and is sensitive. The measurement is simple to make, takes place unattended and is non-interfering (e.g. no fluorescent or radioactive markers are needed). However, there are two main caveats that must be heeded in use of IMC: # Missed data: If externally prepared specimen ampoules are used, it takes ca. 40 minutes to slowly introduce an ampoule into the instrument without significant disturbance of the set temperature in the measurement module. Thus any processes taking place during this time are not monitored. # Extraneous data: IMC records the aggregate net heat flow produced or consumed by all processes taking place within an ampoule. Therefore, in order to be sure what process or processes are producing the measured heat flow, great care must be taken in both experimental design and in the initial use of related chemical, physical and biologic assays. In general, possible applications of IMC are only limited by the imagination of the person who chooses to employ it as an analytical tool and the physical constraints of the method. Besides the two general limitations (main caveats) described above, these constraints include specimen and ampoule size, and the temperatures at which measurements can be made. IMC is generally best suited to evaluating processes which take place over hours or days. IMC has been used in an extremely wide range of applications, and many examples are discussed in this article, supported by references to published literature. Applications discussed range from measurement of slow oxidative degradation of polymers and instability of hazardous industrial chemicals to detection of bacteria in urine and evaluation of the effects of drugs on parasitic worms. The present emphasis in this article is applications of the latter type—biology and medicine. ==Overview== Definition, purpose, and scope Calorimetry is the science of measuring the heat of chemical reactions or physical changes. Calorimetry is performed with a calorimeter. Isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC) is a laboratory method for real-time, continuous measurement of the heat flow rate (μJ/sec = μW) and cumulative amount of heat (J) consumed or produced at essentially constant temperature by a specimen placed in an IMC instrument. Such heat is due to chemical or physical changes taking place in the specimen. The heat flow is proportional to the aggregate rate of changes taking place at a given time. The aggregate heat produced during a given time interval is proportional to the cumulative amount of aggregate changes which have taken place. IMC is thus a means for dynamic, quantitative evaluation of the rates and energetics of a broad range of rate processes, including biological processes. A rate process is defined here as a physical and/or chemical change whose progress over time can be described either empirically or by a mathematical model (Bibliography: Glasstone, et al. 1941 and Johnson, et al. 1974 and Rate equation). The simplest use of IMC is detecting that one or more rate processes are taking place in a specimen because heat is being produced or consumed at a rate that is greater than the detection limit of the instrument used. This can be a useful, for example, as a general indicator that a solid or liquid material is not inert but instead is changing at a given temperature. In biological specimens containing a growth medium, appearance over time of a detectable and rising heat flow signal is a simple general indicator of the presence of some type of replicating cells. Example of a 4 ml ampoule for IMC studies. Fig. 1 However, for most applications it is paramount to know, by some means, what process or processes are being measured by monitoring heat flow. In general this entails first having detailed physical, chemical and biological knowledge of the items placed in an IMC ampoule before it is placed in an IMC instrument for evaluation of heat flow over time. It is also then necessary to analyze the ampoule contents after IMC measurements of heat flow have been made for one or more periods of time. Also, logic-based variations in ampoule contents can be used to identify the specific source or sources of heat flow. When rate process and heat flow relationships have been established, it is then possible to rely directly on the IMC data. What IMC can measure in practice depends in part on specimen dimensions, and they are necessarily constrained by instrument design. A given commercial instrument typically accepts specimens of up to a fixed diameter and height. Instruments accepting specimens with dimensions of up to ca. 1 or 2 cm in diameter x ca. 5 cm in height are typical. In a given instrument larger specimens of a given type usually produce greater heat flow signals, and this can augment detection and precision. Frequently, specimens are simple 3 to 20 ml cylindrical ampoules (Fig. 1) containing materials whose rate processes are of interest—e.g. solids, liquids, cultured cells--or any combination of these or other items expected to result in production or consumption of heat. Many useful IMC measurements can be carried out using simple sealed ampoules, and glass ampoules are common since glass is not prone to undergoing heat-producing chemical or physical changes. However, metal or polymeric ampoules are sometimes employed. Also, instrument/ampoule systems are available which allow injection or controlled through-flow of gasses or liquids and/or provide specimen mechanical stirring. Commercial IMC instruments allow heat flow measurements at temperatures ranging from ca. 15 °C – 150 °C. The range for a given instrument may be somewhat different. IMC is extremely sensitive – e.g. heat from slow chemical reactions in specimens weighing a few grams, taking place at reactant consumption rates of a few percent per year, can be detected and quantified in a matter of days. Examples include gradual oxidation of polymeric implant materials and shelf life studies of solid pharmaceutical drug formulations (Applications: Solid materials). Also the rate of metabolic heat production of e.g. a few thousand living cells, microorganisms or protozoa in culture in an IMC ampoule can be measured. The amount of such metabolic heat can be correlated (through experimentation) with the number of cells or organisms present. Thus, IMC data can be used to monitor in real time the number of cells or organisms present and the net rate of growth or decline in this number (Applications: Biology and medicine). Although some non- biological applications of IMC are discussed (Applications: Solid materials) the present emphasis in this article is on the use of IMC in connection with biological processes (Applications: Biology and medicine). Data obtained A plot of IMC data for a generic exothermic rate process in a sealed ampoule in which the process (and thus the heat flow) begins, accelerates, reaches a peak and then subsides. Below the heat flow plot is a plot showing integration of the heat flow data to give accumulated heat vs. time. As illustrated graphically, the lag phase duration and maximum heat generation rate (growth rate) can be calculated from the integrated data (after Howell, et al. 2011. Used with publisher permission). Fig. 2 A graphic display of a common type of IMC data is shown in Fig. 2. At the top is a plot of recorded heat flow (μ W=μ J/s) vs. time from a specimen in a sealed ampoule, due to an exothermic rate process which begins, accelerates, reaches a peak heat flow and then subsides. Such data are directly useful (e.g. detection of a process and its duration under fixed conditions) but the data are also easily assessed mathematically to determine process parameters. For example, Fig. 2 also shows an integration of the heat flow data, giving accumulated heat (J) vs. time. As shown, parameters such as the maximum growth (heat generation) rate of the process, and the duration time of the lag phase before the process reaches maximum heat can be calculated from the integrated data. Calculations using heat flow rate data stored as computer files are easily automated. Analyzing IMC data in this manner to determine growth parameters has important applications the life sciences (Applications: Biology and medicine). Also, heat flow rates obtained at a series of temperatures can be used to obtain the activation energy of the process being evaluated (Hardison et al. 2003). Development history Lavoisier and Laplace are credited with creating and using the first isothermal calorimeter in ca. 1780 (Bibliography: Lavoisier A & Laplace PS 1780). Their instrument employed ice to produce a relatively constant temperature in a confined space. They realized that when they placed a heat- producing specimen on the ice (e.g. a live animal), the mass of liquid water produced by the melting ice was directly proportional to the heat produced by the specimen. Many modern IMC instrument designs stem from work done in Sweden in the late 1960s and early 1970s (Wadsö 1968, Suurkuusk & Wadsö 1974). This work took advantage of the parallel development of solid-state electronic devices—particularly commercial availability of small thermoelectric effect (Peltier-Seebeck) devices for converting heat flow into voltage—and vice versa. In the 1980s, multi-channel designs emerged (Suurkuusk 1982), which allow parallel evaluation of multiple specimens. This greatly increased the power and usefulness of IMC and led to efforts to fine-tune the method (Thorén et al. 1989). Much of the further design and development done in the 1990s was also accomplished in Sweden by Wadsö and Suurkuusk and their colleagues. This work took advantage of the parallel development of personal computer technology which greatly augmented the ability to easily store, process and interpret heat flow vs. time data. Instrument development work since the 1990s has taken further advantage of the continued development of solid-state electronics and personal computer technology. This has created IMC instruments of increasing sensitivity and stability, numbers of parallel channels, and even greater ability to conveniently record, store and rapidly process IMC data. In connection with wider use, substantial attention has been paid to creating standards for describing the performance of IMC instruments (e.g. precision, accuracy, sensitivity) and for methods of calibration (Wadsö and Goldberg 2001). ==Instruments and measurement principles== Instrument configurations Overview of an IMC instrument which contains 48 separate calorimetry modules. One module is shown. All the modules operate at a given set temperature controlled by the instrument thermostat, but measurements can be started and stopped separately in each module. (With permission, Waters-TA Instruments, Wilmington DE, USA. http://www.tainstruments.com/ ) Fig. 3 Modern IMC instruments are actually semi-adiabatic—i.e. heat transfer between the specimen and its surroundings is not zero (adiabatic), because IMC measurement of heat flow depends on the existence of a small temperature differential—ca. 0.001 °C. However, because the differential is so low, IMC measurements are essentially isothermal. Fig. 3. shows an overview of an IMC instrument which contains 48 separate heat flow measurement modules. One module is shown. The module's measuring unit is typically a Peltier-Seebeck device. The device produces a voltage proportional to the temperature difference between a specimen which is producing or consuming heat and a thermally inactive reference which is at the temperature of the heat sink. The temperature difference is in turn proportional to the rate at which the specimen is producing or consuming heat (see Calibration below). All the modules in an instrument use the same heat sink and thermostat and thus all produce data at the same set temperature. However, it is generally possible to start and stop measurements in each ampoule independently. In a highly parallel (e.g. 48-channel) instrument like the one shown in Fig. 3, this makes it possible to perform (start and stop) several different experiments whenever it is convenient to do so. Alternatively, IMC instruments can be equipped with duplex modules which yield signals proportional to the heat flow difference between two ampoules. One of two such duplex ampoules is often a blank or control—i.e. a specimen which does not contain the material producing the rate process of interest, but whose content is otherwise identical to that which is in the specimen ampoule. This provides a means for eliminating minor heat- producing reactions which are not of interest--for example gradual chemical changes over a period of days in a cell culture medium at the measurement temperature. Many useful IMC measurements can be carried out using simple sealed ampoules. However, as mentioned above, instrument/ampoule systems are available which allow or even control flow of gasses or liquids to and/or from the specimens and/or provide specimen mechanical stirring. Reference inserts Heat flow is usually measured relative to a reference insert, as shown in Fig. 3. This is typically a metal coupon that is chemically and physically stable at any temperature in the instrument's operating range and thus will not produce or consume heat itself. For best performance, the reference should have a heat capacity close to that of the specimen (e.g. IMC ampoule plus contents). Modes of operation Heat conduction (hc) mode Commercial IMC instruments are often operated as heat conduction (hc) calorimeters in which heat produced by the specimen (i.e. material in an ampoule) flows to the heat sink, typically an aluminum block contained in a thermostat (e.g. constant temperature bath). As mentioned above, an IMC instrument operating in hc mode is not precisely isothermal because small differences between the set temperature and the specimen temperature necessarily exist—so that there is measurable heat flow. However, small variations in specimen temperature do not significantly affect heat sink temperature because the heat capacity of the heat sink is much higher than the specimen—usually ca. 100×. Heat transfer between the specimen and the heat sink takes place through a Peltier-Seebeck device, allowing dynamic measurement of heat produced or consumed. In research-quality instruments, thermostat/heat sink temperature is typically accurate to < ±0.1 K and maintained within ca. < ±100 μK/24h. The precision with which heat sink temperature is maintained over time is a major determinant of the precision of the heat flow measurements over time. An advantage of hc mode is a large dynamic range. Heat flows of ca. 50,000 μ W can be measured with a precision of ca. ±0.2 μW. Thus measuring a heat flow of ca. >0.2 μW above baseline constitutes detection of heat flow, although a more conservative detection of 10× the precision limit is often used. Power compensation (pc) mode Some IMC instruments operate (or can also be operated) as power compensation (pc) calorimeters. In this case, in order to maintain the specimen at the set temperature, heat produced is compensated using a Peltier-Seebeck device. Heat consumed is compensated either by an electric heater or by reversing the polarity of the device (van Herwaarden, 2000).van Herwaarden S (2000) Calorimetry measurement. in: MechanicalVariables Measurement (Webster JG, ed), pp. 17.1–17.16. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida. If a given instrument is operated in pc mode rather than hc, the precision of heat flow measurement remains the same (e.g. ca. ±0.2 μW). The advantage of compensation mode is a smaller time constant - i.e. the time needed to detect a given heat flow pulse is ca.10X shorter than in conduction mode. The disadvantage is a ca. 10X smaller dynamic range compared to hc mode. Calibration For operation in either hc or pc mode, routine calibration in commercial instruments is usually accomplished with built-in electric heaters. The performance of the electrical heaters can in turn be validated using specimens of known heat capacity or which produce chemical reactions whose heat production per unit mass is known from thermodynamics (Wadsö and Goldberg 2001). In either hc or pc mode, the resulting signal is a computer-recordable voltage, calibrated to represent specimen μ W-range heat flow vs. time. Specifically, if no significant thermal gradients exist in the specimen, then P = eC [U + t (dU/dt)], where P is heat flow (i.e. μ W), εC is the calibration constant, U the measured potential difference across the thermopile, and t the time constant. Under steady-state conditions—for example during the release of a constant electrical calibration current, this simplifies to P = eC U. (Wadsö and Goldberg 2001). Ampoules Many highly useful IMC measurements can be conducted in sealed ampoules (Fig. 1) which offer advantages of simplicity, protection from contamination and (where needed) a substantial margin of bio-safety for persons handling or exposed to the ampoules. A closed ampoule can contain any desired combination of solids, liquids, gasses or items of biologic origin. Initial gas composition in the ampoule head space can be controlled by sealing the ampoule in the desired gas environment. However, there are also IMC instrument/ampoule designs which permit controlled flow of gas or liquid through the ampoule during measurement and/or mechanical stirring. Also, with proper accessories, some IMC instruments can be operated as ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry) instruments. The topic of ITC is covered elsewhere (see Isothermal titration calorimetry). In addition some IMC instruments can record heat flow while the temperature is slowly changed (scanned) over time. The scanning rate has to be slow-ca. ± 2 K°/h-in order to keep IMC-scale specimens (e.g. a few grams) sufficiently close to the heat sink temperature (< ca. 0.1 °C). Fast scanning of temperature is the province of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) instruments which generally use much smaller specimens. Some DSC instruments can be operated in IMC mode, but the small ampoule (and therefore specimen) size needed for scanning limit the utility and sensitivity of DSC instruments used in IMC mode. ==Basic methodology== Setting a temperature Heat flow rate (μJ/sec = μW) measurements are accomplished by first setting an IMC instrument thermostat at a selected temperature and allowing the instrument's heat sink to stabilize at that temperature. If an IMC instrument operating at one temperature is set to a new temperature, re- stabilization at the new temperature setting may take several hours--even a day. As explained above, achievement and maintenance of a precisely stable temperature is fundamental to achieving precise heat flow measurements in the μW range over extended times (e.g. days). Introducing a specimen After temperature stabilization, if an externally prepared ampoule (or some solid specimen of ampoule dimensions) is used, it is slowly introduced (e.g. lowered) into an instrument's measurement module, usually in a staged operation. The purpose is to ensure that by the time the ampoule/specimen is in the measurement position, its temperature is close to (within c. 0.001 °C) of the measurement temperature. This is so that any heat flow then measured is due to specimen rate processes rather than due to a continuing process of bringing the specimen to the set temperature. The time for introduction of a specimen in a 3–20 ml IMC ampoule into measurement position is ca. 40 minutes in many instruments. This means that heat flow from any processes which take place within a specimen during that the introduction period will not be recorded. If an in-place ampoule is used, and some agent or specimen is injected, this also produces a period of instability, but it is on the order ca. 1 minute. Fig. 5 provides examples of both the long period needed to stabilize an instrument if an ampoule is introduced directly, and the short period of instability due to injection. Recording data After the introduction process, specimen heat flow can be precisely recorded continuously, for as long as it is of interest. The extreme stability of research-grade instruments (< ±100 μK/24h ) means that accurate measurements can be (and often are) made for a period of days. Since the heat flow signal is essentially readable in real time, it serves as a means for deciding whether or not heat flow of interest is still occurring. Also, modern instruments store heat flow vs. time data as computer files, so both real-time and retrospective graphic display and mathematical analysis of data are possible. ==Usability== As indicated below, IMC has many advantages as a method for analyzing rate processes, but there are also some caveats that must be heeded. Advantages Broadly applicable Any rate process can be studied--if suitable specimens will fit IMC instrument module geometry, and proceed at rates amenable to IMC methodology (see above). As shown under Applications, IMC is in use to quantify an extremely wide range of rate processes in vitro—e.g. from solid-state stability of polymers (Hardison et al. 2003) to efficacy of drug compounds against parasitic worms (Maneck et al. 2011). IMC can also determine the aggregate rate of uncharacterized, complex, or multiple interactions (Lewis & Daniels). This is especially useful for comparative screening—e.g. the effects of different combinations of material composition and/or fabrication processes on overall physico-chemical stability. Real-time and continuous IMC heat flow data are obtained as voltage fluctuations vs. time, stored as computer files and can be displayed essentially in real time--as the rate process is occurring. The heat flow- related voltage is continuous over time, but in modern instruments it is normally sampled digitally. The frequency of digital sampling can be controlled as needed—i.e. frequent sampling of rapid heat flow changes for better time resolution or slower sampling of slow changes in order to limit data file size. Sensitive and fast IMC is sensitive enough to detect and quantify in short times (hours, days) reactions which consume only a few percent of reactants over long times (months). IMC thus avoids long waits often needed until enough reaction product has accumulated for conventional (e.g. chemical) assays. This applies to both physical and biological specimens (see Applications). Direct At each combination of specimen variables and set temperature of interest, IMC provides direct determination of the heat flow kinetics and cumulative heat of rate processes. This avoids any need to assume that a rate process remains the same when temperature or other controlled variables are changed before an IMC measurement. Simple For comparisons of the effect of experimental variables (e.g. initial concentrations) on rate processes, IMC does not require development and use of chemical or other assay methods. If absolute data are required (e.g. quantity of product produced by a process), then assays can be conducted in parallel on specimens identical to those used for IMC (and/or on IMC specimens after IMC runs). The resultant assay data is used to calibrate the rate data obtained by IMC. Non-interfering IMC does not require adding markers (e.g. fluorescent or radioactive substances) to capture rate processes. Unadulterated specimens can be used, and after an IMC run, the specimen is unchanged (except by the processes which have taken place). The post-IMC specimen can be subjected to any kind of physical, chemical, morphological or other evaluation of interest. Caveats Missed data As indicated in the methodology description, when the IMC method of inserting a sealed ampoule is used, it is not possible to capture heat flow during the first ca. 40 minutes while the specimen is slowly being brought to the set temperature. In this mode therefore, IMC is best suited to studying processes which start slowly or occur slowly at a given temperature. This caveat also applies to the time before insertion—i.e. time elapsed between preparing a specimen (in which a rate process may then start) and starting the IMC insertion process (Charlebois et al. 2003). This latter effect is usually minimized if the temperature chosen for IMC is substantially higher (e.g. 37 °C) than the temperature at which the specimen is prepared (e.g. 25 °C). Extraneous data IMC captures the aggregate heat production or consumption resulting from all processes taking place within a specimen, including for example * Possible changes in the physico-chemical state of the specimen ampoule itself; e.g. stress relaxation in metal components, oxidation of polymeric components. * Degradation of a culture medium in which metabolism and growth of living cells is being studied. Thus great care must be taken in experimental planning and design to identify all possible processes which may be taking place. It is often necessary to design and conduct preliminary studies intended to systematically determine if multiple processes are taking place and if so, their contributions to aggregate heat flow. One strategy, in order to eliminate extraneous heat flow data, is to compare heat flow for a specimen in which the rate process of interest is taking place with that from a blank specimen which includes everything in the specimen of interest--except the item which will undergo the rate process of interest. This can be directly accomplished with instruments having duplex IMC modules which report the net heat flow difference between two ampoules. ==Applications== After a discussion of some special sources of IMC application information, several specific categories of IMC analysis of rate processes are covered, and recent examples (with literature references) are discussed in each category. Special sources of IMC application information Handbooks The Bibliography lists the four extensive volumes of the Handbook of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry: Vol. 1 Principles and Practice (1998), Vol. 2 Applications to Inorganic and Miscellaneous Materials (2003), Vol. 3 Applications to Polymers and Plastics (2002), and Vol. 4 From Macromolecules to Man (1999). These constitute a prime source of information on (and literature references to) IMC applications and examples published prior to ca. 2000. Application notes Some IMC instrument manufacturers have assembled application notes, and make them available to the public. The notes are often (but not always) adaptations of journal papers. An example is the Microcalorimetry Compendium Vol. I and II offered by TA Instruments, Inc. and listed in the Bibliography. \\"Proteins\\" the first section of notes in Vol. I, is not of interest here, as it describes studies employing Isothermal titration calorimetry. The subsequent sections of Vol. I, Life & Biological Sciences and Pharmaceuticals contain application notes for both IMC and Differential scanning calorimetry. Vol. II of the compendium is devoted almost entirely to IMC applications. Its sections are entitled Cement, Energetics, Material and Other. A possible drawback to these two specific compendia is that none of the notes are dated. Although the compendia were published in 2009, some of the notes describe IMC instruments which were in use years ago and are no longer available. Thus, some of the notes, while still relevant and instructive, often describe studies done before 2000. Examples of applications In general, possible applications of IMC are only limited by the imagination of the person who chooses to employ IMC as an analytical tool--within the previously described constraints presented by existing IMC instruments and methodology. This is because it is a universal means for monitoring any chemical, physical or biological rate process. Below are some IMC application categories with examples in each. In most categories, there are many more published examples than those mentioned and referenced. The categories are somewhat arbitrary and often overlap. A different set of categories might be just as logical, and more categories could be added. Solid materials =Formation= IMC is widely used for studying the rates of formation of a variety of materials by various processes. It is best suited to study processes which occur slowly—i.e. over hours or days. A prime example is the study of hydration and setting reactions of calcium mineral cement formulations. One paper provides an overview (Gawlicki, et al. 2010) and another describes a simple approach (Evju 2003). Other studies focus on insights into cement hydration provided by IMC combined with IR spectroscopy (Ylmen et al. 2010) and on using IMC to study the influence of compositional variables on cement hydration and setting times (Xu et al. 2011).Xu L, Wang P, Zhang G (2011) Calorimetric study on the influence of calcium sulfate on the hydration of Portland cement-calcium aluminate cement mixtures. J. Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry (pub. on line 5 October 2011). IMC can also be conveniently used to study the rate and amount of hydration (in air of known humidity) of calcium minerals or other minerals. To provide air of known humidity for such studies, small containers of saturated salt solutions can be placed in an IMC ampoule along with a non-hydrated mineral specimen. The ampoule is then sealed and introduced into an IMC instrument. The saturated salt solution keeps the air in the ampoule at a known rH, and various common salt solutions provide humidities ranging from e.g. 32-100% rH. Such studies have been performed on μm size range calcium hydroxyapatite particles and calcium-containing bioactive glass \\"nano\\" particles (Doostmohammadi et al. 2011). =Stability= IMC is well suited for rapidly quantifying the rates of slow changes in materials (Willson et al. 1995). Such evaluations are variously described as studies of stability, degradation, or shelf life. Heat flow vs. time for the thermal decomposition of 80 mass% CHP (cumene hydroperoxide) at a series of temperatures. CHP is an industrial chemical intermediate and polymerization initiator which is a documented fire and explosion hazard. According to the authors, neither differential scanning calorimetry or adiabatic calorimetry was sensitive enough to capture these data (from Chen et al. 2008 with publisher permission). Fig. 4 For example, IMC has been widely used for many years in shelf life studies of solid drug formulations in the pharmaceutical industry (Pikal et al. 1989, Hansen et al. 1990, Konigbauer et al. 1992.) IMC has the ability to detect slow degradation during simulated shelf storage far sooner than conventional analytical methods and without the need to employ chemical assay techniques. IMC is also a rapid, sensitive method for determining the often functionally crucial amorphous content of drugs such as nifedipine (Vivoda et al. 2011). IMC can be used for rapidly determining the rate of slow changes in industrial polymers. For example, gamma radiation sterilization of a material frequently used for surgical implants--ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE)--is known to produce free radicals in the polymer. The result is slow oxidation and gradual undesirable embrittlement of the polymer on the shelf or in vivo. IMC could detect oxidation-related heat and quantified an oxidation rate of ca. 1% per year in irradiated UHMWPE at room temperature in air (Charlebois et al. 2003). In a related study the activation energy was determined from measurements at a series of temperatures (Hardison et al. 2003). IMC is also of great utility in evaluating the \\"runaway potential\\" of materials which are significant fire or explosion hazards. For example, it has been used to determine autocatalytic kinetics of cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), an intermediate which is used in the chemical industry and whose sudden decomposition has caused a number of fires and explosions. Fig. 4 Shows the IMC data documenting thermal decomposition of CHP at 5 different temperatures (Chen et al. 2008). Biology and medicine The term metabolismics can be used to describe studies of the quantitative measurement of the rate at which heat is produced or consumed vs. time by cells (including microbes) in culture, by tissue specimens, or by small whole organisms. As described subsequently, metabolismics can be useful as a diagnostic tool; especially in either (a) identifying the nature of a specimen from its heat flow vs. time signature under a given set of conditions, or (b) determining the effects of e.g. pharmaceutical compounds on metabolic processes, organic growth or viability. Metabolismics is related to metabolomics. The latter is the systematic study of the unique chemical fingerprints that specific cellular processes leave behind; i.e. the study of their small-molecule metabolite profiles. When IMC is used to determine metabolismics, the products of the metabolic processes studied are subsequently available for metabolomics studies. Since IMC does not employ biochemical or radioactive markers, the post-IMC specimens consist only of metabolic products and remaining culture medium (if any was used). If metabolismics and metabolomics are used together, they can provide a comprehensive record of a metabolic process taking place in vitro: its rate and energetics, and its metabolic products. To determine metabolismics using IMC, there must of course be sufficient cells, tissue or organisms initially present (or present later if replication is taking place during IMC measurements) to generate a heat flow signal above a given instrument's detection limit. A landmark 2002 general paper on the topic of metabolism provides an excellent perspective from which to consider IMC metabolismic studies (see Bibliography, West, Woodruff and Brown 2002). It describes how metabolic rates are related and how they scale over the entire range from \\"molecules and mitochondria to cells and mammals\\". Importantly for IMC, the authors also note that while the metabolic rate of a given type of mammalian cell in vivo declines markedly with increasing animal size (mass), the size of the donor animal has no effect on the metabolic rate of the cell when cultured in vitro. =Cell and tissue biology= Mammalian cells in culture have a metabolic rate of ca. 30×10−12 W/cell (Figs. 2 and 3 in Bibliography: West, Woodruff and Brown 2002). By definition, IMC instruments have a sensitivity of at least 1×10−6 W (i.e. 1 μW). Therefore, the metabolic heat of ca. 33,000 cells is detectable. Based on this sensitivity, IMC was used to perform a large number of pioneering studies of cultured mammalian cell metabolismics in the 1970s and 1980s in Sweden. One paper (Monti 1990) serves as an extensive guide to work done up until 1990. It includes explanatory text and 42 references to IMC studies of heat flow from cultured human erythrocytes, platelets, lymphocytes, lymphoma cells, granulocytes, adipocytes, skeletal muscle, and myocardial tissue. The studies were done to determine how and where IMC might be used as a clinical diagnostic method and/or provide insights into metabolic differences between cells from healthy persons and persons with various diseases or health problems. Developments since ca. 2000 in IMC (e.g. massively parallel instruments, real-time, computer-based storage and analysis of heat flow data) have stimulated further use of IMC in cultured cell biology. For example, IMC has been evaluated for assessing antigen- induced lymphocyte proliferation (Murigande et al. 2009) and revealed aspects of proliferation not seen using a conventional non-continuous radioactive marker assay method. IMC has also been applied to the field of tissue engineering. One study (Santoro et al. 2011) demonstrated that IMC could be used to measure the growth (i.e. proliferation) rate in culture of human chondrocytes harvested for tissue engineering use. It showed that IMC can potentially serve to determine the effectiveness of different growth media formulations and also determine whether cells donated by a given individual can be grown efficiently enough to consider using them to produce engineered tissue. IMC has also been used to measure the metabolic response of cultured macrophages to surgical implant wear debris. IMC showed that the response was stronger to μm size range particles of polyethylene than to similarly sized Co alloy particles (Charlebois et al. 2002). A related paper covers the general topic of applying IMC in the field of synthetic solid materials used in surgery and medicine (Lewis and Daniels 2003). At least two studies have suggested IMC can be of substantial use in tumor pathology. In one study (Bäckman 1990), the heat production rate of T-lymphoma cells cultured in suspension was measured. Changes in temperature and pH induced significant variations, but stirring rate and cell concentration did not. A more direct study of possible diagnostic use (Kallerhoff et al. 1996) produced promising results. For the uro-genital tissue biopsy specimens studied, the results showed : > \\"it is possible to differentiate between normal and tumorous tissue samples > by microcalorimetric measurement based on the distinctly higher metabolic > activity of malignant tissue. Furthermore, microcalorimetry allows a > differentiation and classification of tissue samples into their histological > grading.\\" =Toxicology= As of 2012, IMC has not become widely used in cultured cell toxicology even though it has been used periodically and successfully since the 1980s. IMC is advantageous in toxicology when it is desirable to observe cultured cell metabolism in real time and to quantify the rate of metabolic decline as a function of the concentration of a possibly toxic agent. One of the earliest reports (Ankerst et al. 1986) of IMC use in toxicology was a study of antibody-dependent cellular toxicity (ADCC) against human melanoma cells of various combinations of antiserum, monoclonal antibodies and also peripheral blood lymphocytes as effector cells. Kinetics of melanoma cell metabolic heat flow vs. time in closed ampoules were measured for 20 hours. The authors concluded that : > \\"...microcalorimetry is a sensitive and particularly suitable method for the > analysis of cytotoxicity kinetics.\\" IMC is also being used in environmental toxicology. In an early study (Thorén 1992) toxicity against monolayers of alveolar macrophages of particles of MnO2, TiO2 and SiO2 (silica) were evaluated. IMC results were in accord with results obtained by fluorescein ester staining and microscopic image analysis --except that IMC showed toxic effects of quartz not discernable by image analysis. This latter observation--in accord with known alveolar effects-- indicated to the authors that IMC was a more sensitive technique. Heat flow vs. time for the treatment of fibroblasts in culture in a stirred stainless steel ampoule. A = introduction of the ampoule into the measurement position, with metabolic heat flow then reaching an equilibrium level. B = injection of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) which produced sharp heat flow peaks related to exothermic diluton of the SDS and lysis of the fibroblasts. After lysis, the heat flow rate returned near zero since fibroblast metabolism had ceased. dQ/dt = the metabolic heat flow of the fibroblasts in culture (from Liu, et al. 2007 with publisher permission). Fig. 5 Much more recently (Liu et al. 2007), IMC has been shown to provide dynamic metabolic data which assess toxicity against fibroblasts of Cr(VI) from potassium chromate. Fig. 5 shows baseline results determining the metabolic heat flow from cultured fibroblasts prior to assessing the effects of Cr(VI). The authors concluded that > \\"Microcalorimetry appears to be a convenient and easy technique for > measuring metabolic processes...in...living cells. As opposed to standard > bioassay procedures, this technique allows continuous measurements of the > metabolism of living cells. We have thus shown that Cr(VI) impairs metabolic > pathways of human fibroblasts and particularly glucose utilization.\\" Simple closed ampoule IMC has also been used and advocated for assessing the cultured cell toxicity of candidate surgical implant materials--and thus serve as a biocompatibility screening method. In one study (Xie et al. 2000) porcine renal tubular cells in culture were exposed to both polymers and titanium metal in the form of \\"microplates\\" having known surface areas of a few cm2. The authors concluded that IMC > \\"...is a rapid method, convenient to operate and with good reproducibility. > The present method can in most cases replace more time-consuming light and > electron microscopic investigations for quantitating of adhered cells.\\" In another implant materials study (Doostmohammadi et al. 2011) both a rapidly growing yeast culture and a human chondrocyte culture were exposed to particles (diam.< 50 μm) of calcium hydroxyapatite (HA) and bioactive (calcium-containing) silica glass. The glass particles slowed or curtailed yeast growth as a function of increasing particle concentration. The HA particles had much less effect and never entirely curtailed yeast growth at the same concentrations. The effects of both particle types on chondrocyte growth were minimal at the concentration employed. The authors concluded that > \\"The cytotoxicity of particulate materials such as bioactive glass and > hydroxyapatite particles can be evaluated using the microcalorimetry method. > This is a modern method for in vitro study of biomaterials biocompatibility > and cytotoxicity which can be used alongside the old conventional assays.\\" =Microbiology= Example of how growth-related heat flow vs. time data from bacteria in culture in a given medium in a sealed ampoule reflect the sequence of metabolic activities taking place. The bacteria move on to consuming less efficient carbon sources as more efficient sources are depleted. Deconvolution of the data yielded the peaks shown which can be assigned to the metabolic modes shown. This sequence for the E. coli bacteria employed is well known in the field of microbiology (from Braissant et al. 2010 with publisher permission). Fig.6 Publications describing use of IMC in microbiology began in the 1980s (Jesperson 1982).Jespersen ND (1982) Biochemical and Clinical Applications of Thermometric and Thermal Analysis. Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company, Amsterdam. While some IMC microbiology studies have been directed at viruses (Heng et al. 2005) and fungi (Antoci et al. 1997), most have been concerned with bacteria. A recent paper (Braissant et al. 2010) provides a general introduction to IMC metabolismic methods in microbiology and an overview of applications in medical and environmental microbiology. The paper also explains how heat flow vs. time data for bacteria in culture are an exact expression--as they occur over time--of the fluctuations in microorganism metabolic activity and replication rates in a given medium (Fig. 6). Illustration of how IMC time of detection of the presence of bacteria depends on the initial number of bacteria present (CFU), the sensitivity of the instrument and the level of heat flow above baseline that is selected as indicating bacterial growth. CFU = colony forming unit. (adapted from Braissant et al. 2010 with publisher permission). Fig.7 In general, bacteria are about 1/10 the size of mammalian cells and produce perhaps 1/10 as much metabolic heat-i.e. ca. 3x10−12 W/cell. Thus, compared to mammalian cells (see above) ca. 10X as many bacteria—ca. 330,000—must be present to produce detectable heat flow—i.e. 1 μW. However, many bacteria replicate orders of magnitude more rapidly in culture than mammalian cells, often doubling their number in a matter of minutes (see Bacterial growth). As a result, a small initial number of bacteria in culture and initially undetectable by IMC rapidly produce a detectable number. For example, 100 bacteria doubling every 20 minutes will in less than 4 hours produce >330,000 bacteria and thus an IMC-detectable heat flow. Consequently, IMC can be used for easy, rapid detection of bacteria in the medical field. Examples include detection of bacteria in human blood platelet products (Trampuz et al. 2007) and urine (Bonkat et al. 2011) and rapid detection of tuberculosis (Braissant et al. 2010, Rodriguez et al. 2011). Fig. 7 shows an example of detection times of tuberculosis bacteria as a function of the initial amount of bacteria present in a closed IMC ampoule containing a culture medium. For microbes in growth media in closed ampoules, IMC heat flow data can also be used to closely estimate basic microbial growth parameters; i.e. maximum growth rate and duration time of the lag phase before maximum growth rate is achieved. This is an important special application of the basic analysis of these parameters explained previously (Overview: Data Obtained). Unfortunately, the IMC literature contains some published papers in which the relation between heat flow data and microbial growth in closed ampoules has been misunderstood. However, in 2013 an extensive clarification was published, describing (a) details of the relation between IMC heat flow data and microbial growth, (b) selection of mathematical models which describe microbial growth and (c) determination of microbial growth parameters from IMC data using these models (Braissant et al. 2013). =Pharmacodynamics= In a logical extension of the ability of IMC to detect and quantify bacterial growth, known concentrations of antibiotics can be added to bacterial culture, and IMC can then be used to quantify their effects on viability and growth. Closed ampoule IMC can easily capture basic pharmacologic information--e.g. minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibiotic needed to stop growth of a given organism. In addition it can simultaneously provide dynamic growth parameters--lag time and maximum growth rate (see Fig. 2, Howell et al. 2011, Braissant et al. 2013), which assess mechanisms of action. Bactericidal action (see Bactericide) is indicated by an increased lag time as a function of increasing antibiotic concentration, while bacteriostatic action (see Bacteriostatic agent) is indicated by a decrease in growth rate with concentration. The IMC approach to antibiotic assessment has been demonstrated for a number of a types of bacteria and antibiotics (von Ah et al. 2009). Closed ampoule IMC can also rapidly differentiate between normal and resistant strains of bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (von Ah et al. 2008, Baldoni et al. 2009). IMC has also been used to assess the effects of disinfectants on the viability of mouth bacteria adhered to dental implant materials (Astasov- Frauenhoffer et al. 2011). In a related earlier study, IMC was used to measure the heat of adhesion of dental bacteria to glass (Hauser-Gerspach et al. 2008). Analogous successful use of IMC to determine the effects of antitumor drugs on tumor cells in culture within a few hours has been demonstrated (Schön and Wadsö 1988). Rather than the closed-ampoule approach, an IMC setup was used which allowed drug injection into stirred specimens. As of 2013, IMC has been used less widely in mammalian cell in vitro pharmacodynamic studies than in microbial studies. =Multicellular organisms= It is possible to use IMC to perform metabolismic studies of living multicellular organisms—if they are small enough to be placed in IMC ampoules (Lamprecht & Becker 1988). IMC studies have been made of insect pupa metabolism during ventilating movements (Harak et al. 1996) and effects of chemical agents on pupal growth (Kuusik et al. 1995). IMC has also proved effective in assessing the effects of aging on nematode worm metabolism (Braekman et al. 2002). IMC has also proved highly useful for in vitro assessments of the effects of pharmaceuticals on tropical parasitic worms (Manneck et al. 2011-1, Maneck et al. 2011-2, Kirchhofer et al. 2011). An interesting feature of these studies is the use of a simple manual injection system for introducing the pharmaceuticals into sealed ampoules containing the worms. Also, IMC not only documents the general metabolic decline over time due to the drugs, but also the overall frequency of worm motor activity and its decline in amplitude over time as reflected in fluctuations in the heat flow data. =Environmental biology= Because of its versatility, IMC can be an effective tool in the fields of plant and environmental biology. In an early study (Hansen et al. 1989), the metabolic rate of larch tree clone tissue specimens was measured. The rate was predictive of long-term tree growth rates, was consistent for specimens from a given tree and was found to correlate with known variations in the long-term growth of clones from different trees. Bacterial oxalotrophic metabolism is common in the environment, particularly in soils. Oxalotrophic bacteria are capable of using oxalate as a sole carbon and energy source. Closed-ampoule IMC was used to study metabolism of oxalotrophic soil bacteria exposed to both an optimized medium containing potassium oxalate as the sole carbon source and a model soil (Bravo et al. 2011). Using an optimized medium, growth of six different strains of soil bacteria was easily monitored and reproducibly quantified and differentiated over a period days. IMC measurement of bacterial metabolic heat flow in the model soil was more difficult, but a proof of concept was demonstrated. Moonmilk is a white, creamy material found in caves. It is a non-hardening, fine crystalline precipitate from limestone and is composed mainly of calcium and/or magnesium carbonates. Microbes may be involved in its formation. It is difficult to infer microbial activities in moonmilk from standard static chemical and microscopic assays of moonmilk composition and structure. Closed ampoule IMC has been used to solve this problem (Braissant, Bindscheidler et al. 2011).Braissant O, Bindschedler S, Daniels AU, Verrecchia EP & Cailleau C (2011) \\"Microbiological activities in moonmilk monitored using isothermal microcalorimetry (cave of \\"Vers chez le Brandt\\", Neuchatel, Switzerland)\\". Journal of Cave and Karst studies (accepted 05/2011). It was possible to determine the growth rates of chemoheterotrophic microbial communities on moonmilk after the addition of various carbon sources simulating mixes that would be brought into contact with moonmilk due to snow melt or rainfall. Metabolic activity was high and comparable to that found in some soils. Harris et al. (2012), studying differing fertilizer input regimes, found that, when expressed as heat output per unit soil microbial biomass, microbial communities under organic fertilizer regimes produced less waste heat than those under inorganic regimes. =Food science= IMC has been shown to have diverse uses in food science and technology. An overview (Wadsö and Galindo 2009) discusses successful applications in assessing vegetable cutting wound respiration, cell death from blanching, milk fermentation, microbiological spoilage prevention, thermal treatment and shelf life. Another publication (Galindo et al. 2005) reviews the successful use of IMC for monitoring and predicting quality changes during storage of minimally processed fruits and vegetables. IMC has also proven effective in accomplishing enzymatic assays for orotic acid in milk (Anastasi et al. 2000) and malic acid in fruits, wines and other beverages and also cosmetic products (Antonelli et al. 2008). IMC has also been used to assess the efficacy of anti-browning agents on fresh-cut potatoes (Rocculi et al. 2007). IMC has also proven effective in assessing the extent to which low-energy pulsed electric fields (PEFs) affect the heat of germination of barley seeds--important in connection with their use in producing malted beverages (Dymek et al. 2012).Dymek K, Dejmek P, Panarese V, Vicente AA, Wadsö L, Finnie C, Gómez Galindo F (2012) Effect of pulsed electric field on the germination of barley seeds.

He became chief assistant to Anthony Salvin, and joined the Architectural Association in 1859. He was admitted an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1862 and a fellow of the association in 1867. Although his early work was Gothic, Edis later became a proponent of the Queen Anne Style of baroque revival architecture. He worked mostly on private houses and public buildings, although he did design a few churches. He later became involved in the Aesthetic Movement of decorative arts and in furniture design, and delivered a series of Cantor lectures on the subject at the Royal Society of Arts. These formed the basis of two books: Decoration and Furniture of Town Houses (1881) and Healthy Furniture and Decoration (1884). Great Britain building at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893 From 1883, Edis extended and rebuilt Sandringham House in Norfolk for the Prince of Wales. He was the designer of the British pavilion at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. Edis had a long association with the Volunteer Force and its successor the Territorial Force. In 1868 he received a commission in the Artists' Rifles. He went on to be the regiment's commanding officer in 1883, and held the office of honorary colonel from 1909 until his death. He designed the unit's drill hall at Duke's Road, off Euston Road, Camden (now The Place, home of the Contemporary Dance Trust). In January 1889 he was elected a member of the first London County Council, representing St Pancras South for three years as a member of the Conservative-backed Moderate Party. Edis had homes at Ormesby Old Hall, Great Ormesby, Norfolk as well as Fitzroy Square and Regent's Park, London. He was a justice of the peace and a Deputy Lieutenant for Norfolk from 1901. He was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1919 for his military services.

The SM.80bis was a four-seat variant, powered by two pusher engines. ==Design and development== The SM.80 was a cantilever high-wing monoplane. Like the fin and tailplane, the wing was a fabric covered wooden structure, but one subdivided into sealed cells to provide buoyancy in case of hull flooding. Its tips were rounded; the fin was broad and also rounded with the tailplane, braced from below, mounted a little way above the fuselage. All control surfaces, the differential ailerons, split elevators and rounded rudder, were steel tube framed and fabric covered. The fuselage of the SM.80 was flat sided, with a single stepped, double planked underside, copper riveted for corrosion resistance. It became slender aft. The side-by-side cockpit was set slightly into the wing leading edge and a baggage space or third seat was placed in the trailing edge. On the water, lateral stability was provided by fixed, flat bottomed floats mounted on the wing at mid-span on pairs of parallel struts. The wheeled undercarriage of the amphibian attracted contemporary notice for its neatness: the mainwheel legs were enclosed in fairings, rotated through about 180° rearwards then upwards along the fuselage sides, positioning the retracted wheels in the wing roots. The first SM.80 was originally powered by a 112 kW (150 hp) six cylinder inline engine Alfa-Romeo built Colombo S.63 engine, mounted centrally well above the wing on a parallel pair of forward leaning N-form struts, supplemented by a transverse V-shaped bracing. The mounting struts were tubes of chrome molybdenum steel, enclosed in alloy fairings for corrosion protection. They placed the engine forward of the wing leading edge and the two blade propeller well forward of the pilot's windscreen. This aircraft was flying with the Colombo engine when it attended the Egyptian Air Rally in December 1933. The SM.80 also flew with a 112 kW (150 hp) CNA C.VI six-cylinder in-line engine. The third aircraft, registered in 1934, was more radically re-engined; a four-seater, it was named the SM.80bis. This is powered by two pusher configuration, 56 kW (75 hp) seven- cylinder radials Pobjoy R engines, placed further aft than the single engine of the SM.80 but located above the wing on either side of the fuselage on very similar mountings. The cabin is positioned about 950 mm (2 ft) further forward but otherwise the two models were structurally identical. The SM.80bis was 80 kg (175 lb) heavier and significantly slower, with a decrease of maximum speed of (16 mph), though climb rates were similar. The speed decrease has been attributed to the extra drag of the twin engine arrangement, since the SM.80 and SM.80bis had the same overall engine power. ==Operational history== Apart from its Egyptian visit in late 1933, the activities of the various SM.80s are not well recorded. An exception is a fatal landing accident which the Fiat heir and Juventas chair Eduardo Agnelli died on 14 July 1935. The aircraft, the first SM.80, was owned by Giovanni Agnelli, the founder of Fiat and Eduardo's father. It seems that Eduardo was thrown forward into the propeller when the aircraft hit a floating obstacle as he was preparing to disembark. Normal cockpit access on the SM.80 was via separate forward folding windscreens for passenger and pilot. The SM.80bis survived World War II and, re-registered, flew again after it. ==Variants== ;SM.80: Single tractor configuration Colombo S.63 or CNA C.VI 6-cylinder in-line engine. 2/3 seats. ;SM.80bis: Twin pusher configuration Pobjoy R 7-cylinder radial engine. 4 seats. ==Aircraft on display== The SM.80bis c/n 3 and registered as I-TATI before World War II and as I-ELIO afterwards was later on static public display at the Museo G. Caproni, Trento but has moved to Parco Museo del Volo Volandia at Vizzola Ticino. ==Specifications (SM.80, Colombo engine)References== Category:Amphibious aircraft Category:1930s Italian sport aircraft Category:Savoia-Marchetti aircraft Category:Single-engined pusher aircraft Category:Twin-engined pusher aircraft Category:High-wing aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1933 ","title":"Savoia-Marchetti SM.80"},{"id":"35215985","text":"Harold Wadsworth (4 October 1898 – 2 November 1975) was an English footballer who made over 250 appearances in The Football League for Liverpool ,Leicester City, Nottingham Forest and Millwall. == Playing career== Wadsworth started his career at local club Bootle St Matthews before he was signed by Tranmere Rovers.

He was born in Hobart, Tasmania and died there as well. In 1874, the great English cricketer W. G. Grace stayed with the Butler family while on a cricket tour of Australia and Charles Butler became a friend: Grace named his third son Charles Butler Grace after Butler. Butler went into the legal profession, like his father, who was also called Charles Butler, and at his death was reckoned as \\"one of the best known legal men in Tasmania\\". ==Cricket career== Butler played as a right-handed middle-order batsman, but had limited success in first-class cricket, being dismissed without scoring six times in his 12 first-class innings. His highest score was 31, made in the 1877-78 match against South Australia. In 1878, Butler travelled with the Australian team that went to England and after William Midwinter had left the tour to join Gloucestershire alongside Grace, Butler was invited to join the team, though in the event he was injured and played in only one non-first-class match, where he failed to score in either innings. Earlier in the season he had played in a couple of non-first-class matches with Grace at Newcastle upon Tyne. In Tasmania, he played in the annual North v South and other important non-first-class matches in Tasmania from 1872 to 1901. His brother, Francis, also played first-class cricket. ==Other sports== Butler was also well known in Tasmania for his prowess at lawn tennis, being the Hobart champion nine times and runner-up 12 times.

The prey are stored in cells created in old insect burrows dug into rotting wood, hollow stems and cracks in walls, and, unlike many other Pompilid spider wasps, these may be clustered with six cells in each burrow. A single egg is laid on each paralysed crab spider, smaller spiders host males and larger females. The nest is made up of sawdust, plant fibres and dismembered insect parts bound together with spider silk and sealed with chewed wood. ==References *Images representing Dipogon bifasciatus at Barcodes of Life Category:Hymenoptera of Europe Category:Pepsinae Category:Insects described in 1785 ","title":"Dipogon bifasciatus"},{"id":"35216032","text":"John Gair \\"Jack\\" Robson (1885 – 1957) was an English schoolmaster, musician and songwriter.

It can represent Indonesia as a nation, Indonesian people, culture, arts, and its biodiversity. The official symbols of Indonesia are officially recognise symbols that represent Indonesia and enforced through Indonesian laws. These symbols of the state that represent Indonesian nationhood are Garuda Pancasila, Merah-Putih flag, Indonesia Raya national anthem, and Indonesian language. Other than these official national symbols of Indonesia, there are also other symbols that widely recognise and accepted to represent Indonesia, yet does not necessarily being enforced by Indonesian laws. However some symbols that previously unofficially recognised and had not enforced by law finally gain official recognition through law edict, such as Indonesian national flora and fauna that enforced by law in 1993. ==Official national symbols== The statue of Garuda Pancasila, displayed at Ruang Kemerdekaan (Independence Room) in National Monument (Monas), Jakarta. Official national symbols of Indonesia are national symbols of Indonesia that represent Indonesian nationhood. These symbols are recognised as official symbols that represent Republic of Indonesia and usually displayed in Indonesian government institution buildings, Indonesian embassies, Indonesian passport, or held by Indonesian representatives in international events, such as diplomatic or sporting events. These national symbols are enforced through Indonesian laws. The Constitution of Indonesia 1945 Chapter XV specifies the flag, official language, coat of arms, and national anthem of Indonesia. The Indonesian law No. 24 year 2009 mentioned about the Indonesian flag, Indonesian language, national emblem of Indonesia, and national anthem of Indonesia. National emblem of Indonesia Garuda Pancasila is the national emblem of Indonesia. It is an eagle bird and the name of symbol derived from Garuda, the mythical bird vehicle of Vishnu. The current symbol are designed and officially recognised in 1950s. The Garuda's feathers represent the date of Indonesia's independence day which is 17 August 1945. The total feathers of the wings are 17 in each left and right wings. The total feathers in the tail are 8 and feathers of its neck are 45 in total. Indonesian national emblem is the Garuda with a heraldic shield on its chest and a scroll gripped by its leg. The shield's five emblems represent Pancasila, the five principles of Indonesia's national philosophy. Those five symbols of principle has its own meaning. First, the star in the middle symbolise sacred divinity, which means Indonesia is a state which is based on five recognised religions. Second, the chain with square and round links symbolises male and female as well as succession of generations of human beings that represent just and civilised humanity. Third, the big beringin (banyan tree) with multitude of branches, leaves and roots symbolises diversity of Indonesian people that belongs into one organism, symbolises unity of Indonesia, as well as strong and steady stance and protection under the tree's shade. Fourth, the head of a buffalo symbolises the people power or democracy, since water buffalo is the important domesticated animal in Indonesian agricultural culture. The last one, rice and cotton ears as main grain yields in Indonesia symbolise the fulfilments of humans needs of food and clothing which means prosperity. The Garuda claws gripping a white ribbon scroll inscribed with the national motto Bhinneka Tunggal Ika written in black text, which can be loosely translated as \\"Unity in Diversity\\". Garuda Pancasila was designed by Sultan Hamid II from Pontianak, supervised by Sukarno. National motto Bhinneka Tunggal Ika is the official national motto of Indonesia. The phrase is Old Javanese translated as \\"Unity in Diversity,\\".Santoso, Soewito Sutasoma, a Study in Old Javanese Wajrayana 1975:578. New Delhi: International Academy of Culture It is inscribed in the Indonesian national symbol, Garuda Pancasila (written on the scroll gripped by the Garuda's claws), and is mentioned specifically in article 36A of the Constitution of Indonesia. It is a quotation from an Old Javanese poem Kakawin Sutasoma, written by Mpu Tantular during the reign of the Majapahit empire sometime in the 14th century. Kakawin contains epic poems written in metres. This poem is notable as it promotes tolerance between Hindus (Shivaites) and Buddhists. Flag of Indonesia National Monument with a row of Indonesian flags The national flag of Indonesia, which is known as Merah-Putih (\\"The Red-and-White\\") in Indonesian, is based on the banner of the 13th century Majapahit Empire in East Java. The flag itself was introduced and hoisted in public at the Indonesian Independence Day ceremony, on 17 August 1945. The design of the flag has remained the same ever since. National anthem of Indonesia Indonesia Raya is the national anthem of the Republic of Indonesia. The song was introduced by its composer, Wage Rudolf Supratman, on 28 October 1928 during the Second Indonesian Youth Congress in Batavia. The song marked the birth of the all-archipelago nationalist movement in Indonesia that supported the idea of one single \\"Indonesia\\" as successor to the Dutch East Indies, rather than split into several colonies. National language of Indonesia Indonesian language () is the official language of Indonesia. The function of Indonesian language is as the national identity, national pride, and unifying language among diverse Indonesian ethnic groups, and also serves as communication vehicle among Indonesian provinces and different regional cultures in Indonesia. National flora There are three categories of floral emblem that symbolise Indonesia: #National flower () of Indonesia is Melati putih (Jasminum sambac) #Flower of charm () is Anggrek Bulan (Moon Orchid) (Phalaenopsis amabilis)) #Rare flower () is Padma Raksasa Rafflesia (Rafflesia arnoldii). All three were chosen on World Environment Day in 1990. On the other occasion Bunga Bangkai (Titan arum) was also added as puspa langka together with Rafflesia. In addition, Indonesia also recognised: #National tree () of Indonesia is Pohon Beringin (Ficus benjamina) as the national tree. #National leaf () of Indonesia is Daun Pisang kipas (Ravenala) as the national leaf. National fauna Indonesian animal emblems are Indonesian endemic fauna that gain the status as national animal symbol that represent Indonesia and describe Indonesian biodiversity. Today there are three animals that gained the status as Indonesian animal emblems: #National animal () of Indonesia is Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis) #Rare animal also National bird () is Javan hawk-eagle (Nisaetus bartelsi) #Animal of charm () is Asian arowana (Scleropages aureus and Scleropages legendrei) Next to national animal symbols, there are also more specific provincial animals emblems that represent each respective provinces of Indonesia. National gem Indonesia national gem are Batu Intan (Diamond) as the national gem, especially Batu Intan from Martapura and Cempaka, Banjarbaru. ==Unofficial national symbols== Other than national symbols that officially represent Indonesia and enforced through law, there are also other symbols or icons that widely accepted to describes or represents Indonesia. It might derived from Indonesian monuments, the popular architectural landmarks of Indonesia, or it might be some of popular aspects of Indonesian culture. National personification of Indonesia Ibu Pertiwi () is a national personification of Indonesia, the allegory of Tanah Air (), the Indonesian Motherland. Ibu Pertiwi is a popular theme in Indonesian patriotic songs and poems and was mentioned in several of them, such as the song \\"Ibu Pertiwi\\" and \\"Indonesia Pusaka\\" . In the national anthem \\"Indonesia Raya\\" the lyrics \\"Jadi pandu ibuku\\" (\\"Become the scout/guide for my mother\\") is a reference to Ibu Pertiwi as the mother of Indonesian people. Nusantara (Indonesian archipelago) Nusantara is an Indonesian word for the Indonesian archipelago. It is originated from Old Javanese \\"Nusa\\" and \\"Antara\\". \\"Nusa\\" literally means Island and \\"Antara\\" literally means \\"between\\". It is named like that because Indonesian archipelago is located between two continents (Asia and Australia) and two oceans (Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean) The map of Indonesian archipelago often used to symbolise Indonesia, especially Indonesian territory. National costume Batik, Kebaya and Songket are the most widely recognised Indonesian national costumes. These traditional costumes represent Indonesia and are derived from Indonesian culture and Indonesian traditional textile traditions. National costumes are worn during official national functions as well as during traditional ceremonies. The most obvious display of Indonesian national costumes can be seen by the type of costumes worn by President of Indonesia and Indonesian first lady, and also by Indonesian diplomatic officials during gala dinners. The national costumes of Indonesia are also worn by guests attending Indonesian traditional wedding ceremonies. National monuments If Cambodia has Angkor Wat, India has Taj Mahal and China has their Great Wall, Indonesia could easily refer to Borobudur as its own unique landmark and monument designated as national symbol. An important architectural wonder and also World Heritage site recognised by UNESCO. However the monument that represent Indonesian nationhood is actually the Monas in Central Jakarta, although today it is mostly associated with the capital Jakarta instead. Other ancient temple of Prambanan also might be used as national symbol, although often overshadowed by Borobudur. Other vernacular architectural features that often used to describe Indonesia are pagoda like multi-tiered Meru roof of Balinese temples, and traditional houses such as Minangkabau's Rumah Gadang and Torajan's Tongkonan. National culture Some of traditional Indonesian culture, artworks, artforms, and traditions are often widely recognised and promoted to represent Indonesia. Some of popular Indonesian artforms are Balinese dance, Angklung, Wayang, Gamelan and Keris. Although some might be shared with culturally similar neighbouring country such as Malaysia, for example keris is also can be found in Malaysian and Brunei culture. National dish For the culturally and ethnically diverse nation such as Indonesia, the national dishes are not just staple, popular or ubiquitous dishes such as Nasi Goreng, Karedok or Gado-gado. It may also be considered as the dishes that transcend cultural and ethnics differences, yet still retain common Indonesian cuisine traits. It has to be able to cross boundaries of diverse Indonesian culture and ethnic groups. As a result, it is impossible to nominate a single national dish of Indonesia. Sate and Soto are good examples of Indonesian national dishes, since there is no singular satay or soto recipes. Both dishes have myriad variations and recipes and are adopted regionally across Indonesia. == References == ","title":"National symbols of Indonesia"},{"id":"35216121","text":"Sherman Pratt (March 22, 1900 - September 14, 1964) was an American sportsman, explorer, and co-founder of Florida's Marineland and the Grenville Baker Boys Club. ==Early life== Pratt was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, the second son of George Dupont Pratt and Helen Deming Sherman.

The episode is told from the point of view of all nine characters of the third generation.Skins - 4oD - Channel 4 A description of the episode on the Channel 4 website reads; \\"It's the end of an era. The exams results are in and Alex is throwing the mother of all leaving parties. Everyone's future hangs in the balance as Franky struggles to confront her past.\\" ==Plot== Mini, having had issues with her pregnancy, lies asleep in hospital. Liv sits with her and attempts unsuccessfully to talk to her, before leaving to let her be with Alo. Meanwhile, Franky digs through her fathers' possessions and finds the address of her social worker, before hitching a ride to Birmingham with a friendly truck driver. There, the social worker discreetly helps her find her mother's address, but when Franky arrives, she finds it boarded up and empty. She is confronted by her older sister, Clara, who is shocked to see her , and informs her that their mother is dead. Back in Bristol, Matty and Nick have noticed Franky's absence and, despite their feud, both head to Birmingham to find her, after tracking her using an app on Nick's phone. Upon seeing Nick and Matty outside Clara's apartment complex, Franky narrowly manages to escape them, and hitches a ride from the same trucker. Upon discovering that he is heading back to Bristol, she demands he pull over, and he refuses, simply telling her that she can't run forever. Franky throws herself out of the truck, and is promptly rushed to hospital by the aghast trucker. Liv, who has been starting to feel isolated, asks Alex to forgo his gap year in Thailand and stay with her. However, he tells her that he can't do that, and instead reminds her that there is still his final send-off party before the friends must say goodbye. Rich is given an offer from his top university choice, Cambridge, to his delight — though his joy is short-lived when Nick arrives and asks him if he can let Matty stay. He hesitantly agrees. While sharing a spliff, Matty apologises to Rich for Grace's death, which he accepts, saying that 'Grace says it's cool' as 'she is here all the time.' Back in the hospital, Franky visits a sleeping Mini. Liv is shocked when she sees the state Franky is in and starts to berate her for her melodramatic behaviour and tendency to be manipulative. Mini to suddenly wakes up and orders Liv out. As she comforts the crying Frankly, she tells her very gently that she will have to face Nick and Matty eventually and can't run forever. Eventually, Alex's party rolls around, and Alo convinces Mini's obstetrician to let her attend \\"for an hour.\\" At the party, Nick and Matty both set their sights on Franky and pursue her through the club, as she continues to run from them. Eventually, she is confronted by an image of Grace, who encourages her to face up to the two and tell them the truth. Feeling her confidence return, Franky tearfully admits to Nick and Matty that she loves both of them, but that she knows a relationship could not work between any of them for that reason, before going outside and being met by Clara, who takes Franky home to Jeff. Matty and Nick decide to make peace. Meanwhile, back at the party, Grace appears to Rich as well, and the two share a kiss in the pool, before she disappears. The next day, Liv and Mini have finally reconciled, when Mini suddenly suffers contractions, and has to be rushed to hospital. Clara tells Franky that she had lied about what she had done to her mother's body, and offers to take her to where it really is, which she and Jeff accept. In a final closing scene, Franky is driven by Jeff and Clara to where her mother is. But, rather than arriving at a graveyard, they arrive at a mental hospital where Franky is finally re-united with her mother. Alex, meanwhile, boards a bus for Heathrow Airport, and sends Liv a goodbye text, which makes her smile. Nick and Matty go to a police station, and share a final hug before Matty goes inside and turns himself in. At the hospital, Mini gives birth to her baby girl with the support of Liv and Alo. Outside the maternity ward, Rich hears the cries of Mini's baby.

In his civil engineering work in the 1860s he constructed one of the first rows of terraced cottages to be built out of poured shuttered concrete, using what was then a revolutionary building material and technique. They were then known as Coombe Terrace, today numbers 12 to 21 Coombe Road, and were built for Lake himself and for his employees. Lake's trawler work was in conjunction with George Parker Bidder, also of Dartmouth, and proved to be a technical success, but not at that time to be commercially viable. Lake spent a substantial part of his life in India. In 1867 Lake of the Bombay Reclamation Company was awarded the Albert MedalLondon Gazette 7 June 1867 for his bravery in helping rescue the crew and some 400 Muslim pilgrims from a shipwreck off Bombay.

It premiered on E4 in the UK on 19 March 2012. The episode is told from the point of view of characters Mini McGuinness and Franky Fitzgerald. Mini and Franky are still holed up in Mini's bedroom, but with Matty back in Bristol and Mini's ever-growing baby bump, time is quickly running out for the girls. Things come to a head when Mini's health takes a turn for the worse leaving them isolated and under pressure from family and friends.Skins - 4oD - Channel 4 ==Plot== The episode begins Franky waking up in Mini's bed and putting her hand towards the light coming in through the window. She turns over, expecting to see Mini, before realises that she is hiding under the duvet. Franky tells Mini that her ultrasound appointment is today, but Mini is reluctant to go. Franky is in the kitchen cooking French toast, when suddenly Mini's mum Shelley and her boyfriend Eric return home from their holiday. Shelley, still unaware of Mini's pregnancy, goes upstairs to check on her and Mini only just manages to cover up her baby bump by covering herself with her duvet. Later, when Franky and Mini are having breakfast, Mini goes over to the window and discovers Matty standing outside, much to her horror. Afterwards, Franky takes Mini to her ultrasound appointment and Matty, wanting to talk to Franky begins following them. While Matty and Franky argue, Mini suddenly collapses behind them. After not initially noticing, Matty calls an ambulance and Mini is rushed to hospital. At the hospital, Alo and Shelley are shocked when they find out about Mini's pregnancy, and Nick finds out that Matty is back in Bristol, causing a fight to break out between the two brothers in the hospital waiting area. Shelley wants Mini to give the baby up for adoption, and they have a blazing row about it, while Franky refuses to call the police on Matty and gives off indications that she may still have feelings for him. Alo, meanwhile, is determined that he doesn't want a baby. Mini and Franky meet up outside Mini's house, and Franky becomes determined to prevent Shelley from making Mini give up her baby, due to her own experiences with adoption. With a symbolic switching off of their iPhones, the two girls escape to another part of Bristol and find a homeless shelter to stay for the night, masquerading as a lesbian couple to get a room together. The next day, however, Franky intercepts a call from Alo to Mini's phone and deletes it, not wanting anyone to contact Mini. But Mini is starting to have doubts about whether running away from their troubles will make things better. Franky attempts to persuade her to go to Oxford (where she had lived before moving to Bristol), but Mini refuses, and is found by her new stepfather at the bus station. He persuades her to return home, and manages to coax Franky, who is desperate not to lose the only mother figure in her life, to come with them. When they return to Mini's house, Franky is gently sent upstairs to run a bath, and Shelley tells Mini the story of her near miscarriage, and agrees to let her keep the baby. Franky, who has been listening, loses it and flees the house, running down the street in tears. Later that night, Rich picks Mini up and takes her to Alo's farm, where Mini and Alo kiss and finally form a proper relationship.

Reising was a ranking competitive target shooter. An ordnance engineer, Reising was the recipient of more than 60 firearm patents. Following his work with Harrington & Richardson, he designed semi-automatic rifles for Mossberg & Sons, Marlin, Savage, and Stevens. ==Biography== Of Swedish ancestry from a family that came to Delaware in 1635, Reising was born at Port Jervis, New York. He was the son of a railroad engineer who died when Eugene Reising was an infant. Reising attended Lehigh University for three years, then worked as a cowboy in Texas and Mexico for a few years. On returning to the U.S. he went to work for Colt, testing and selling guns. He worked with John M. Browning on the development of the Colt Model 1911 pistol. In 1911, Reising served in Company A of the Connecticut National Guard, winning a championship in expert riflemanship and giving demonstrations of the rapid reloading of semi- automatic pistols. In October 1925, Reising was indicted for violating the Sullivan Act after supplying pistols and Maxim Silencers to a member of the Cowboy Tessler gang, a group who were captured after a string of robberies and a gun battle with police in New York. He pled guilty to unlawful possession of firearms and was sentenced to fifteen months' imprisonment on Welfare Island. In 1938, Reising began work on a new submachine gun. He submitted his design to Harrington and Richardson, and in March 1941, they started manufacturing it as the Model 50. Approximately 100,000 of these were made, and many were used in World War II.

The church was built between 1927 and 1929 to the designs of Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, the architect of Liverpool Cathedral. The church is modelled on the Early Christian basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Rome. It is a Grade II* listed building. The exterior is Romanesque, of Bath Stone rubble. A three-arched loggia with Byzantine columns and capitals surrounds it. The red roof tiles were imported from Lombardy. The full-height campanile intended by Scott was not built, due to fears over the strength of the foundations. The interior columns have capitals with figurative carvings by William Drinkwater Gough. Those on the columns on the north side depict scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, those on the columns on the south, scenes from the life of St Alphege and those supporting the choir and organ loft on the west end show persons associated with the church, including Scott himself. Scott wrote of the church, \\"It has always been one of my favourite works.\\" Relatively unknown since its construction, the church was overlooked by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner in his 1958 North Somerset and Bristol edition of The Buildings of England.

She has dubbed in Hindi, Bengali, English, Marathi, and Urdu languages. ==Personal life== Mona Ghosh Shetty is the daughter of former voice-dubbing artist Leela Roy Ghosh, who was a veteran in the field. While she dubs her foreign roles in Hindi most of the time, she also performs her voice-dubbing roles in English and Bengali. She runs a dubbing studio known as Sound & Vision India located in Andheri, Mumbai.

Her mother died on 11 May 2012. ==Dubbing career== She dubs in English, Hindi, Bengali, and Oriya professionally, but if one advertisement becomes popular then she has to do it in all the 10 official regional languages: Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi, Marathi, Oriya and Assamese.

There is always a supervisor who tells you about the nuances of the language and how it should be spoken.\\" She specialises in dubbing for teenage, young adult and middle-aged female characters.

It is an Anglican parish church in the deanery of Ewecross, the archdeaconry of Craven, and the Diocese of Leeds. Its benefice is united with that of St John the Baptist, Low Bentham. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. ==History== St Margaret's was built in 1837. It was extended in 1901–02 by the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley. The additions included a new chancel, transepts, organ chamber and vestries. The plaster ceiling was removed from the nave, which was reseated, and a tower screen and pulpit were installed. These alterations cost £2,014 (). As of 2012, the church building is closed for public worship. The congregation either meets at St Boniface's Roman Catholic Church, or at St John's Church in Low Bentham. ==Architecture== The church is constructed in stone, with a slate roof. Its plan consists of a four-bay nave, a two-bay chancel with a north vestry and a south chapel, and a west tower. The tower has octagonal angle turrets, and an embattled parapet. It is in three stages, with a west doorway in the bottom stage. The middle stage contains a stepped triple window, and in the top stage are two-light bell openings.

He got his PhD degree from the Institute of Semiconductors of Russian Academy of Sciences in 1966 under supervision of Grigory Pikus. The title of his thesis was \\"Magnetic phenomena in crossed electric and magnetic fields\\". He stayed to work at the same institute as a researcher. In 1972, the Institute of Semiconductors was merged with into Ioffe Physical-Technical Institute. In 1974, Aronov moved to the Konstantinov Leningrad Nuclear Physics Institute, located in Gatchina. In 1977, he received there his Doktor nauk degree for the thesis \\"Behavior of superconductors and polarized conductors under non-equilibrium conditions\\". In December, 1990 Aronov was elected to be a Corresponding Member of Russian Academy of Sciences. In January 1991, he moved back to the Ioffe Institute to head the theoretical physics division, and, still holding this position, in May 1994 he joined the faculty of the Weizmann Institute of Science. In the 1990s, he visited University of Karlsruhe for extended periods of time, and he also became an Associate Member of the scientific staff of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste. Arkady Aronov died in November 1994 in Rehovot as a result of a heart attack. During his career, Arkady Aronov supervised a number of PhD theses including these of Evgeny Ivchenko, Boris Spivak, Boris Altshuler, Alexey Ioselevich, Aleksander Zyuzin, and Alexander Mirlin. ==Research activity== The fields in which Arkady Aronov contributed the most are *optics of semiconductors; *spin kinetics and spin-dependent transport phenomena in semiconductors and metals; *non-equilibrium phenomena in superconductors; *mesoscopic physics, including quantum kinetic theory of disordered electronic structures, disorder, interaction, and quantum coherence phenomena. Spin relaxation In 1975, together with late Gennady Bir and with Grigory Pikus, Aronov suggested a mechanism of spin relaxation in solids, which is currently known as the Bir–Aronov–Pikus mechanism and is considered to be one of three most important spin relaxation mechanisms, on par with the Dyakonov–Perel and Elliott–Yafet mechanisms. Mesoscopic physics Together with Boris Altshuler, a graduate student under his supervision, Aronov developed theory of electron-electron interaction in disordered conductors. In particular, he derived a Boltzmann-like equation which governs the kinetic behavior of electrons in conductors with weak disorder (weak localization regime), and discovered that electrical conductivity acquires a correction due to electron-electron interaction. This term is widely known as Altshuler–Aronov correction. In collaboration with Altshuler and Patrick A. Lee he applied this theory to explain the experimentally observed phenomenon of zero-bias anomaly - suppression of density of states by interactions at the Fermi surface. In 1981, in collaboration with Boris Altshuler and David Khmelnitsky, he investigated decoherence of electrons in the weak localization regime due to electron-electron interaction, and discovered that two distinct time scales, decoherence (dephasing) time and relaxation time, exist in one and two dimensions. (In three dimensions, these time scales coincide). In the same year, together with Boris Altshuler and Boris Spivak, Aronov suggested an experiment which by measuring an Aharonov–Bohm oscillations in a disordered conductor would reveal the weak localization effect by the existence of oscillations with the halved period as compared with Aharonov–Bohm oscillations in clean conductors. The experiment by Dmitry Sharvin and Yury Sharvin performed in the same year fully confirmed the predictions. These advances were summarized by Altshuler and Aronov in a review article \\"Electron-Electron interaction in disordered conductors\\", which became a reference material in the field and by 2009 was cited over 1000 times. In 1994 Aronov, in collaboration with Alexander Mirlin and Peter Wölfle, initiated studies of properties of electrons in random magnetic field which eventually opened the whole research field of electrons in random magnetic field, useful for understanding the quantum Hall effect. ==Honors== *Corresponding Member of Russian Academy of Sciences, 1990. *Alexander von Humboldt Research Award, 1991. *Hewlett Packard Europhysics Prize, 1993, shared with Boris Altshuler, David Khmelnitsky, Anatoly Larkin, and Boris Spivak, awarded for \\"Theoretical Work on Coherent Phenomena in disordered Conductors\\". *Professorship of the Wilhelm and Else Heraeus Foundation, University of Karlsruhe.

Its members were suspected of various bloody bank attacks, murder and a missed car bombing attack against a G7 Finance ministers meeting in Lille. Their violent story ended with a R.A.I.D. assault against their Roubaix HQ in 1996. == Background== In 1992, the Bosnian War began in Bosnia and Herzegovina involving three ethnic groups: Bosnian Serbs, supported by Serbia, Bosnian Croats supported by Croatia and Bosniaks. Bosniaks received some support (financial and military) from Muslim countries. Among the foreigners arriving in Bosnia were, Christophe Caze, a French medicine student, who began taking care of casualties in Zenica, considered as one of the primary radical areas. Soon afterwards, he converted to Islam and radicalized slowly. During his stay in Zenica, he made friends with Fateh Kamel, Mohammed Omary and Lionel Dumont, members of the Bosnian mujahideen and participated in the war. In 1995, the Bosnian War ended with the Dayton Agreement. All the mujahideen, including Caze who joined them, were asked to leave Bosnia. Then Kamel, who was working for the GIA, convinced Caze and Dumont, to commit terrorist attacks in their home countries because of the diplomatic relationships between France and Algeria. Kamel organized counterfeited administrative documents in his home country of Canada to allow his associates to escape safely after the attacks. Meanwhile, Caze and Dumont began recruiting in Roubaix, France and went to Bosnia in order to buy heavy weaponry with financial help from Abu Hamza al- Masri in London.L'islamiste manchot arrêté à Londres == Attacks in France== In late 1996, the newly created cell began spreading terror. In order to fund their future attacks, they planned several criminal acts.Le « gang de Roubaix », du banditisme au terrorisme On 27 January 1996, some of their members, including Dumont, stole an Audi car but encountered a police patrol, who thought that they were dealing with minor criminals. Immediately, the group fired on the police with assault rifles, injuring one of the police officers who was hit twice. However, the attackers' weapons malfunctioned and the police were able to escape. On 8 February 1996, they robbed a supermarket but had to flee when the police arrived. The ensuing chase ended with the group's car crashing. While firing on the police, they killed a Mercedes driver, Hammoud Feddal and stole his car.Roubaix: un mort lors d'une course-poursuite.

The whole building was supposed to be destroyed by the blast. However, the bomb malfunctioned, destroying only the car. == The end == For several days, the gang had been under surveillance after the failed assault against the Brink's truck. The police officers succeeded in locating the gang's: the house of one of the members in Roubaix. The day following the failed attack of 28 March, the police decided to intervene. The RAID, a French anti-terrorist Special unit, surrounded and stormed the house. The four men who were inside fought back with assault rifles, screaming that they'd rather die than surrender. The RAID team fired back and launched smoke grenades. A grenade, launched by the group, injured another policeman and started a fire in the house. After several minutes of heavy gunfighting, the roof of the building, weakened by the fire, collapsed on the 3 remaining gang members. The toll of the assault was 4 dead and two police officers injured, including one seriously.Assaut du Raid : le précédent de Roubaix, il y a 16 ans - 22/03/2012 - LaDepeche.fr The others members of the gang, who were located in several other locations, managed to escape. All the police units were scrambled. Several hours later, Caze, who had managed to escape, was killed by Belgian police. == Aftermath == An electronic address book was found on Caze's body which permitted the arrest of Fateh Kamel and Mohammed Omary. Kamel was the leader of a terrorist cell in Montreal, suspected of planning terrorist attacks in Los Angeles. After escaping all across Europe, Dumont was finally arrested in Germany in 2003.

While there now are two banners listing the years of IU's 21 Big Ten titles, those were not present during Bobby Knight's tenure. Before 2000, the only Big Ten title banner that was hung honored the 1983 team, which Knight ordered as a tribute to the fans.

The aircraft is built from welded 4130 steel tubing, with a 6061-T6 aluminum engine mount plate. In flight steering is accomplished via levers that actuate the canopy brakes, creating roll and yaw. On the ground the aircraft has lever-controlled nosewheel steering. The main landing gear incorporates spring rod suspension. The design uses an overhead adjustable canopy hang point, called a \\"cg spreader bar\\" to establish the correct canopy attachment point and hence the aircraft's flight attitude and torque offset.

TV Guide published both lists: the first, published on June 28, 1997, was produced in collaboration with Nick at Nite's TV Land. A revised list was published on June 15, 2009. The lists excluded game shows and variety shows, but included situation comedies and drama series. ==History and differences== About 25 shows from the original list were featured during a special week on Nick at Night on Nickelodeon and TV Land. On the original list several shows, including I Love Lucy, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Dick Van Dyke Show, Seinfeld, Cheers, and The Odd Couple had multiple entries, but none did on the 2009 list. The original list included 35 episodes from the 1950s and 1960s, while the 2009 list only included 10. Over one-third of the new list first aired in the twelve years since the original list, including 14 from the most recent two years. The June 2009 list included episodes as recent as the April 12, 2009, \\"Peekaboo\\" episode of Breaking Bad and the April 7, 2009, \\"Baptism\\" episode of Rescue Me, while the 1997 list included a two- month-old episode of The X-Files. CBS was the original broadcaster of 35 of the 1997 list members, including both of the top two: \\"Chuckles Bites the Dust\\" of The Mary Tyler Moore Show and \\"Lucy Does a TV Commercial\\" from I Love Lucy. Several television series were represented by a different episode in 2009 than they were in 1997. The 2009 top rated show was \\"The Contest\\" from Seinfeld although in 1997 the show had been represented by \\"The Boyfriend\\" (number four) and \\"The Parking Garage\\" (number 33), instead of \\"The Contest\\". Three of the top 10 1997 episodes were removed although the series continued to be represented by other episodes: \\"The $99,000 Answer\\" (number 6) from The Honeymooners, \\"Thanksgiving Orphans\\" (number 7) from Cheers; and \\"Coast-to- Coast Big Mouth\\" (number 8) from The Dick Van Dyke Show. The 1997 list included detailed show descriptions for all episodes, while only a select few were accompanied by more than a single sentence in the ascending order 2009 list. Only one of the thirteen contributors to the 2009 list was involved in the 1997 list. ==Top 10== ;1997 list: # The Mary Tyler Moore Show—\\"Chuckles Bites the Dust\\" # I Love Lucy—\\"Lucy Does a TV Commercial\\" # ER—\\"Love's Labor Lost\\" # Seinfeld—\\"The Boyfriend\\" # The Odd Couple—\\"Password\\" # The Honeymooners—\\"The $99,000 Answer\\" # Cheers—\\"Thanksgiving Orphans\\" # The Dick Van Dyke Show—\\"Coast-to-Coast Big Mouth\\" # The Bob Newhart Show—\\"Over the River and Through the Woods\\" # The X-Files—\\"Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose\\" ;2009 list: # Seinfeld—\\"The Contest\\" # The Sopranos—\\"College\\" # The Mary Tyler Moore Show—\\"Chuckles Bites the Dust\\" # I Love Lucy—\\"Lucy Does a TV Commercial\\" # Lost—\\"Pilot\\" # ER—\\"Love's Labor Lost\\" # The Honeymooners—\\"Better Living Through TV\\" # Mad Men—\\"Nixon vs. Kennedy\\" # All in the Family—\\"Cousin Maude's Visit\\" # 24—\\"Day 1: 12:00 a.m.–1:00 a.m.\\" ==Reception== Paley Center for Media's James Sheridan regretted the recent bias of the newer list. Hal Boedeker of the Orlando Sentinel viewed the original list as a triumphant result despite its conflict of interest. The original list was derided for omitting Bonanza and The Golden Girls entirely. Daily News David Bianculli was critical of the original list, saying that many selections would not be on a more legitimate top-100 list. He claimed that episodes chosen from Murder One, The Partridge Family, The Love Boat, and Speed Racer reveal a lack of either maturity or perspective, while others showed taste and bravery. Chicago Tribune critic Steve Johnson complained that it was premature to claim that any episode of ER had established sufficient cultural significance to rank third on the original list. Jaime Weinman of Maclean's complained that the 2009 list was composed of the most well-known episode of famous series, claiming that they were largely unexceptional episodes. He preferred the 1997 list, which he said was produced when TV Guide was a higher caliber publication. ==See also== *TV Guides 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time ==Notes * 1997 list at Augusta Chronicle * 1997 list at Associated Press * 2009 list at IMDb Category:TV Guide lists Category:Top television lists Category:20th century-related lists Category:21st century- related lists ","title":"TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time"},{"id":"35216678","text":"Rosanes may refer to: *Jakob Rosanes, German mathematician *Judah Rosanes, Rabbi of Constantinople ","title":"Rosanes"},{"id":"35216701","text":"Norman Winarsky is an American author and angel investor.

A house was built on the site in 1874 as a family residence in the time of Captain Arthur Drummond Hay, but was destroyed by fire in 1878. It was replaced in 1880 by the house which forms the nucleus of the present building, and was subsequently operated as a hotel. The hotel closed in 2011 and in early 2013 it was bought by tennis player Andy Murray. The hotel re-opened in April 2014 under the name Cromlix, managed by Inverlochy Castle Management International (ICMI). Inverlochy Castle Management International ==History== There are records of Cromlix from the 1500s when the Bishop of Dunblane sold the lands of Cromlix to his brother, Robert Chisholm. The present house was built for Arthur Hay-Drummond, son of the Earl of Kinnoul. King Edward VII visited in September 1908. The house remained a family home for the Hay- Drummonds until the death of Evelyn Hay-Drummond in 1971, who had married Terence Eden (8th Lord Auckland). Cromlix House was converted in May 1981 from what was the Eden family home, and retained much of the original furniture designed for the house as well as the family portraits. It also contains Cromlix Chapel, a consecrated Episcopalian Church in the diocese of Dunblane dating from 1874 which was opened by Charles Wordsworth, Bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane. It contains some notable features, including the reredos, carved by Alexander MacDonald, a sculptor who lived in Rome, son of Lawrence MacDonald. The house sits in part of a estate and occupies approximately of parkland, forestry and four fishing lochs, as well as two celebrated mineral springs. Between the 1980s and its closure on 16 February 2012 it was run as a four-star country house hotel, with 14 bedrooms including eight suites. In 2006 Cromlix House – including the game larder, ancillary building, gatepiers and garden boundary walls – was designated as a Category C listed building. An obelisk sundial in the garden is Category A listed. In October 2010 it served as the wedding venue for tennis player Jamie Murray and Colombian MBA student Alejandra Murray (née Gutierrez); his brother and fellow player Andy was the best man. Following a period of financial difficulties, staff phoned guests telling them their reservations would not be honoured and added a statement to the website that read: \\"We regret to inform you that as of 16th February 2012, Cromlix House Hotel ceased trading.\\" The property had been listed for sale since August 2011. In February 2013, it was confirmed that Andy Murray had bought the property for £1.8 million. It opened as a 15-room five-star hotel in April 2014. In April 2015 Cromlix was the venue for the wedding reception of Andy Murray and his wife Kim, and the following year Murray's father and partner Sam Watson were married at the hotel. ==References * Cromlix Luxury Hotel Category:Country houses in Stirling (council area) Category:Houses completed in 1874 Category:Category C listed buildings in Stirling (council area) Category:Hotels in Scotland ","title":"Cromlix House"},{"id":"35216708","text":"Fabrizio Moreira (born January 18, 1982, Manta, Manabi, Ecuador) is an Ecuadorian politician and businessman.

We are living in an era where $15,000 to $20,000 powered parachutes are common. Powered parachutes in this price range are completely out of reach of an average working man, even with creative financing.\\" The company originally operated as Powered Parachute Plans, also of Athens, Texas. When parts for complete aircraft were made available these were supplied by Airframes Unlimited and gradually the two enterprises were unified under the latter name.

Yaosang is a festival celebrated in Manipur for five days in spring, starting on the full moon day of the month of Lamda (February-March). Yaosang is indigenous traditions of the Meitei people. It is considered the most important festival in Manipur. Like Holi, the Hindu Meitei of Manipur play with colours during this festival. ==Description== Yaosang begins just after sunset in every village with the Yaosang Mei thaba, or Burning of the Straw Hut. Then the children ask at every house for monetary donations, called nakatheng. On the second day, groups of local bands perform sankirtan in the Govindagee Temple in the Imphal-East district of Manipur. On the second and third days, girls go to their relatives for their nakatheng and block roads with ropes for collecting money. On the fourth and fifth days, people pour or splash water on one another.A number of sport events like tug of war and soccer are also organised on this occasion.Apart from this the local delicacies are also shared with the neighbours during the festival. ==Dance== Another feature of this festival is Thabal Chongba (Dancing in the Moonlight). Males from various places will come to the site of the festival and dance in circles with the females, holding their hands. In 2016, this occurred 23–24 March.http://manipur.gov.in/wp- content/uploads/2013/02/general_holiday_2016.pdf ==Celebrations== The locals also engage in feasting to celebrate this festival of merrymaking. Of late, there has been a trend of channelling the festive energy toward sporting events to spot out talents at the grassroot level, which is in line with the rich sporting spirit of the Meiteis. ==Gallery== As a part of the Yaosang sports festival, old folks show off their skill in a traditional form of wrestling known as mukna.

His work mainly focused on human rights, politics, and war. He covered news stories across the northern region of Nigeria. == Personal == Benue State UniversityEnenche Akogwu was the son of Agnes Akogwu, his widowed mother. She said after his father Jonah's death in 2010, Enenche assumed the responsibility for taking care of the family. His mother also claims that he loved being a reporter and as a kid, he would go out in the city to see what was happening and then return home to tell the family. His friend and colleague, Idris Jibrin, says that he used to go to Akogwu for advice on his own stories. Akogwu graduated from Benue State University in 2004. == Career == At the time of his death, Enenche Akogwu was a reporter and camera operator for Channels Television, a privately owned station based in Lagos. His work mainly focused on human rights, politics, and war. He began working for Channels TV in 2010, as a correspondent in Abuja, the capital of Nigeria. He was later assigned to a position in Kano, Nigeria, where he worked until his passing. However, he did cover news stories all across the northern region of Nigeria. == Death == On 20 January 2012, Enenche Akogwu was killed at the age of 31. Earlier that day, he was at his office in Kano with his best friend and colleague, Idris Jibrin, when they heard several bomb explosions and decided to investigate. Akogwu heard that some of the bombing was taking place at the Farm Centre Police Station so he went there and approached some by-standers to get a quote. Those by-standers turned out to be Islam Militants from the terrorist group Boko Haram, who immediately shot and killed Akogwu. When Jibrin heard about the gunfire at Farm Centre, he tried calling Akogwu's cellphone but got no answer. He headed toward the scene to see if Akogwu was alright. A by-stander told Jibrin that a journalist had been shot, so he went to the body and discovered that it was Akogwu. Akogwu had been shot six times. He was shot three times in the chest and three times in the stomach. Jibrin delivered the news to Channels Television that their journalist had been killed. == Context == Akogwu had previously spent some time in Lagos, Nigeria and returned to Kano only two days before he was shot by Boko Haram. According to Bashir Adigun, Channels TV regional news editor, Akogwu had been gone for a news conference that was put on by police to discuss recent suicide bombings on government buildings. These bombings that Akogwu discussed at the conference were claimed to be the work of Boko Haram, the very same group that is now responsible for his death. Boko Haram insurgency began in July 2009 with the 2009 Boko Haram uprising. Almost 1,000 people were killed in this fight between Boko Haram and Nigerian soldiers. Throughout 2010 and 2011, Boko Haram was responsible for several more attacks and bombings, which killed hundreds of people. Then, the group attacked Kano on 20 January 2012, killing over 170 people, including Enenche Akogwu. As of that day, this was its single most deadly attack. According to Reporters Without Borders, Akogwu was the second journalist to ever be killed by Boko Haram, the first of whom was Zakariya Isa, shot and killed in Maiduguri, Nigeria. The estimated number of deaths from the Kano attacks was discovered by reporters from the Associated Press who actually counted the bodies in the mortuary at the Murtala Muhammed Specialist Hospital. Correspondents from the private Leadership newspaper also found victims from the bombings in the mortuaries at the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital and the Sir Muhammadu Sanusi Hospital. After these findings, the estimated total number of deaths from the Kano attacks was raised to 215. The first attack of the day was directed toward the Nigeria Police Headquarters on Bayero University (BUK) Road. By-standers say that a suicide bomber drove a Honda Civic into the police headquarters, killing himself and three police officers. This attack was soon followed by attacks on the Zaria Road Police Station and the Farm Centre Police Station, where Akogwu was killed. It was later discovered that the immigration office in Kano was also attacked, resulting in the death of more officers. Reportedly, twenty bombs went off in Kano on 20 January 2012. At first, authorities were unsure who caused the attacks, but Boko Haram took responsibility for them, saying that its motive was to get revenge for the recent arrests of its members. According to Vanguard News, Akogwu had previously spoken out against Boko Haram on his personal Facebook page. His rebuttal was in response to the group deciding that all northerners and Christians who lived in the northern states of Nigeria should move to different places. This applied to Akogwu because he was a Christian from Kano, which is a northern state. == Impact == After Akogwu's death, his mother, Agnes Akogwu and best friend and colleague at Channels Television, Idris Jibrin, both told reporters that he was a dedicated journalist who loved his job. In an interview with Idoma Voice reporters, Agnes said that even her husband, who died two years before Akogwu, said their son would make a successful reporter. Proving them all right, Akogwu was awarded with Channels Television's 2011 chairman's award. == Reactions == Irina Bokova, the Director-General of UNESCO, responded to Akogwu's death and the Boko Haram attacks by saying that the \\"crime constitutes a serious attack on the basic human right of freedom of expression and press freedom.\\" She also called on \\"the Nigerian authorities to investigate these killings.\\" The morning after the attacks, Red Cross officials evacuated the city of Kano and carried injured victims to safety. All hospitals in Kano were under orders from the state government to treat victims with the best care possible and to provide them with free treatment. A coworker of Akogwu, Chika Moses, told reporters that the whole crew at Channels TV was devastated when they heard about Akogwu's death, especially when they had to deliver the news about the death of their own journalist. Just days after Nigeria learned about Akogwu's death, a picture of him wearing a vest with the word \\"PRESS\\" written in bold letters across the front spread rapidly on various blogs and social media. Four years after Akogwu's death, his mother, Agnes Akogwu was approached by reporters from Idoma Voice. She told them she was still in disbelief. When Akogwu's father died in 2010, his mother talked to him about his career because she worried it was unsafe. Agnes said that the former senate president of Nigeria, David Mark, was very supportive after the death of her son. She also said that Channels TV and Idoma leaders were very helpful at that time and that the Benue and Kano state governments were generous enough to give her financial support. However, she did mention that there were some people who approached her at her son's burial and promised to help her other children get through school, but she had still not heard from them four years later. After Akogwu's death, his best friend and colleague, Idris Jibrin, admitted that Nigerian Police do not perform their jobs well. He claims that they tell journalists that when they go out on the job, they go at their own risk because the police cannot protect them. Jibrin also says that even the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) does not help and protect journalists like they should. The union was asked, by email, to comment on the tragedy but never responded. Another source claims that NUJ did comment on the events of Akogwu's death by saying that \\"journalism in the country is hovering in a dangerous environment.\\" Journalist, Paul Dada, also spoke out saying that the employers of reporters need to do a better job at ensuring the safety of their employees.http://allafrica.com/stories/201201301810.html The day after Boko Haram attacked, Goodluck Jonathan, president of Nigeria at the time of Akogwu's death, promised that those responsible for the attacks would be brought to justice. Mohamed Keita, the Africa Advocacy coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, also urged that action be taken to bring the attackers to justice. The Nigerian National Committee from the International Press Institute (IPI) recommended that the Nigerian government take action to better protect journalists in the future. In addition, IPI said that journalists should also be careful while on the job and should prioritize their own safety above their work. Reporters were unable to contact the Kano state police commissioner for comments on the evidence but instead, got a response from an official from the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA). Yushau Shuaib from NEMA said that they were trying to save as many of the injured as they could and some NEMA officials from Kaduna even moved to Kano to help. ==See also== * Timeline of Boko Haram insurgency * January 2012 Nigeria attacks * Death of Nansok Sallah == References  External links == * Memorial website Category:1980 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Deaths by firearm in Nigeria Category:Murdered journalists Category:Nigerian journalists Category:People murdered in Nigeria Category:Journalists who died as a result of terrorism Category:Terrorism deaths Category:Benue State University alumni ","title":"Enenche Akogwu"},{"id":"35217130","text":"The Pepsinae are a subfamily of the spider wasp family, Pompilidae, including the tarantula hawks, as well as smaller species.

He was probably South Africa's first professional Black modern artist, and exhibited from the late 1920s onward. == Biography == Born in Johannesburg, the son of a miner, Mancoba grew up on the Rand and was eventually sent to Grace Dieu near Pietersburg for his secondary schooling by his uncle, an Anglican minister.E. Miles, Lifeline Out of Africa: The Art of Ernest Mancoba. Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, 1994, 9. . After graduating, he was hired at Grace Dieu as a language teacher in 1924. Mancoba's interest in art began in 1925 with the arrival of an adjunct teacher named Ned Paterson at Grace Dieu. Paterson, a recent art school graduate preparing for the ministry, introduced wood carving and gained a following among those at Grace Dieu who were artistically inclined. Initially Mancoba produced decorated pieces of furniture in the school carpentry shop, using the school's bas relief style. In 1929, he tried his hand at freestanding sculpture, and produced a commissioned work called African Madonna using a model in a contrapposto stance. African Madonna is probably the first modern sculpture produced by a Black South African, and is now on permanent display at the Johannesburg Art Gallery. Ernest Mancoba, African Madonna, 1929. In 1934, Mancoba sculpted Future Africa (Africa to be)—two youthful African figures as a representational appearance of Africa's bright future. Two years later, Mancoba was offered a job by the South African government's Department of Native Affairs during the spring of 1936 to craft purchasable souvenirs for the Empire Exhibition in Johannesburg later that fall. He initially considered, but eventually refused. Cohen, Joshua, \\"Identity and Abstraction: Ernest Mancoba in London and Paris\\", 1938-1940, 2018. Post. MoMA. https://post.at.moma.org/content_items/1144-identity-and-abstraction-ernest- mancoba-in-london-and-paris-1938-1940. Along with other Grace Dieu carvers, Mancoba began exhibiting at the South African Academy annual competitions. By this point he and his friend Gerard Sekoto began to dream of attending art school in Europe, for which they needed a B.A. After leaving Grace Dieu to attend the South African Native College at Fort Hare on scholarship, he quit carving for several years. When his funds ran out, he dropped out of Fort Hare and survived by producing religious sculptures on commission, operating out of the Rhodes University Art Department. In 1935 he decided to pursue art full- time and moved to Cape Town, where he associated with a group of Trotskyite artists, including Lippy Lipshitz, who had a strong impact on his emerging sculpture style.Morton, \\"Grace Dieu Mission,\\" 45–46. In 1937, Grace Dieu rehired Mancoba to teach English at an affiliate, Khaiso Secondary School in Pietersburg. The goal was for Mancoba to earn a living while completing received his undergraduate degree from the University of South Africa by correspondence. With encouragement from Gerard Sekoto, Mancoba succeeded. Mancoba took up woodcarving, which he would specialize in until moving to France in 1938.Elizabeth Morton, \\"Grace Dieu Mission in South Africa: Defining the Modern Art Workshop in Africa.\\" In S. Kasfir and T. Forster, eds, African Art and Agency in the Workshop, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2013, 42-43. He left South Africa for Europe in 1938 when he received a scholarship to continue his studies in Paris, where he enrolled at the École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs. Once in Europe, Mancoba continued his expedition in art; visiting art museums and attending exhibitions. When viewing other African art in European museums, he was given a new perspective—including his very own work. In his sculpture \\"Future Africa\\", the two figures appear dismayed and hopeless, with dispirited eyes and their heads lowered. Although the “sad” representational impact in his sculpture wasn't his primary goal; Mancoba understood that due to Africa's long struggle of breaking free from western colonialism, African art was perceived in European museums as “primitive” and dismal. In an effort to ascend pass the western perception of African art, Mancoba pursued painting abstraction. Mancoba consciously abandoned the religious artistic tradition he had started out in and permanently transitioned from sculpture to painting. His first painting, Composition (1940), figuratively modernizes a Congolese Kuba mask by merging colorful geometrical shapes and sections that reestablish the human form in a profound new configuration created by appropriating figural and design aspects from the African canon. Cohen, Joshua, \\"Identity and Abstraction: Ernest Mancoba in London and Paris\\", 1938-1940, 2018. Post. MoMA. https://post.at.moma.org/content_items/1144-identity-and-abstraction-ernest- mancoba-in-london-and-paris-1938-1940. His increasing interest in abstraction has been interpreted by Elizabeth Morton as a conscious attempt to negate the paternalistic approach to art he had learned as an Anglican student. As Morton notes, Mancoba was one of the few mission-trained African artists \\"to have consciously eliminated all traces of his mission style from his work.\\"Morton, \\"Grace Dieu Mission\\", 50. While in Paris he met fellow student Sonja Ferlov. In 1940, shortly after Germany occupied France during WWII, Mancoba stayed in Paris along with Sonja Ferlov during Germany's western front. Despite being under curfew and German control, they later married in 1942. Taken as a British subject, Mancoba interned while in a POW camp until 1944. Allied forces, accompanied by U.S. troops, pushed German forces out of France and ended the war in 1945. Sze, Winnie, \\"Ernest Mancoba: Visible Man, Invisible Work?\\" Deviant Practice: Research Programme. 106-108. Eindhoven, Netherlands. Museum Eindhoven, 2018. In 1946, they had a son named Wonga (1946–2015) who would also become a respected artist.\\"Sonja Ferlov Mancoba, Ernest Mancoba & Wonga Mancoba, 11 June – 3 JULY 2010\\" , Exhibitions past, Galerie Mikael Andersen.Phindile Xaba, \\"South Africa: Artist Wonga Mancoba Dies in Paris\\", The Journalist, 10 March 2015. In 1947, Mancoba moved with Ferlov to a small town village outside of Copenhagen. There she introduced Mancoba to Asger Jorn who was a part of the Host Artist's Association and a founding member of Cobra. For the next annual exhibition (1948), Asger Jorn invited Mancoba and Ferlov to attend and meet two other Cobra artists; Constant Nievwenhuys and Corneille Guillaume Beverloo (most commonly known under his pseudonym Corneille). The exhibition came to be known by art historians to be the first Cobra exhibition since the CobrA manifesto had been written and signed several days before. The Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam hosted Constant and Corneille's Cobra exhibition called the “Exposition Internationale d’ Art Experimental, in 1949. Constant and Corneille invited seven other Danish Artist, including Mancoba who did not participate. Due to his absence, Mancoba wasn't listed within the exhibition's catalogue and perhaps resulted in his exclusion from the list of Cobra artists. Although no known reason stands for Mancoba and why he didn't participate, personal complications between members may have had an impact on his involvement with the group. Sze, Winnie, \\"Ernest Mancoba: Visible Man, Invisible Work?\\" Deviant Practice: Research Programme. 106-108. Eindhoven, Netherlands. Museum Eindhoven, 2018. Although Mancoba was an active participant with Cobra members and in later artistic movements, his role received little attention in art historical scholarship. Leading artist and scholar Rasheed Araeen to argue in 2004 that the erasure of Mancoba was the result of racism and ethnocentrism. In the 1950s, Mancoba returned to Paris, where he became a French citizen. In 1957, Mancoba painted \\"Untitled 1957\\". An oil on canvas painting bearing bold colors and energetic gestures of demanding lines. He sought transparency in his painting process while depicting a freedom of expression through abstraction. Whitely, Zoe, \\"Ernest Mancoba: Untitled (1957).\\" 2014. www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/mancoba-untitled-t14190 . Ernest Mancoba's style is composed of line movement often encompassing a central figure-like form that dissolves into the surrounding abstract atmosphere of colorful oils, charcoal, ink or pastel marks. In the late 1980s and until his passing, Mancoba shifted his format to landscape and strayed from one central figure to many calligraphic strokes with various mediums.

She challenged the claim and all parties, including national team coaches, athletes, and Horn-Miller, agreed to arbitration using the alternate dispute resolution system for sport. In 2004, Horn-Miller did not return to the team and her coaches and teammates were required to undergo cultural sensitivity training and Aboriginal sensitivity training. It was revealed that the members of her team thought that she was \\"intimidating\\" and they were not comfortable around her. Horn- Miller began her athletic career as a competitive swimmer at the age of 7. She switched to water polo while attending Carleton University in Ottawa, where she studied political science. Horn-Miller graduated from Carleton as a three- time athlete of the year. She is a member of the Carleton Ravens Hall of Fame. Between 1990 and 1997, Horn-Miller has participated in the North American Indigenous Games and won over 20 gold medals, including one for rifle shooting. In 1999, Horn-Miller won the national Tom Longboat Award that recognizes Aboriginal athletes for their outstanding contributions to sport in Canada. In 2006, Horn-Miller was selected as a torchbearer for the Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. == Professional career == Inaugural Order of Sport Honours, Toronto, 2019 In 2008, Horn-Miller served as a broadcaster for CBC Sports at the 2008 Summer Olympics, held in Beijing. In October 2011, Horn- Miller teamed up with the Aboriginal Peoples' Television Network to launch a fitness and healthy-eating initiative called Working It Out Together, which follows six Mohawks on their pursuit of better health. Horn-Miller has also served as a motivational speaker. In 2014, she spoke to 18,000 youth from more than 1,000 schools across North America at WE Day in Toronto, with a message about overcoming obstacles and promoting positive social change in Indigenous communities in Canada. She fights against racism since she had received unfair treatment as an indigenous athlete. She is trying to help other young indigenous athletes to work hard for what they want to achieve despite the racism they may face. She has been an influential speaker for the younger generation of Mohawks, she tries to motivate and be the role model for the kids to be hard-working and determined to achieve all their goals, just as she did as an indigenous athlete. In November 2014, Horn-Miller was selected as an assistant chef de mission for the Canadian contingent that competed at the 2015 Pan American Games. In addition to serving as a mentor for the athletes, this volunteer position was responsible for promoting the Pan Am Games at various events and also communicating with various sporting bodies to ensure their athletes needs are being met. In 2015 Horn-Miller was named one of Canada's most influential women in sport by the Canadian Association for Advancement of Women and Sport. Horn-Miller also served as an ambassador for Nike's Native American initiative, Nike N7. She is currently a brand ambassador for Manitobah Mukluks and director of their Storyboot School. She is a 2019 inductee into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame. ==Personal life== Born in Montreal, Quebec, Horn-Miller is the daughter of former model and First Nations activist Kahn-Tineta Horn and George Miller (Mohawk educator and academic), and the half-sister of actress Kaniehtiio Horn. She was present at the Oka Crisis in the occupational camp as a 14-year-old. On the 78th and last day of the standoff, as the occupiers were walking out there was a physical altercation between soldiers and Mohawk militants; Waneek was stabbed near the heart by a soldier's bayonet as she carried her sister, and nearly lost her life. During her 2000 Olympic campaign Horn-Miller appeared nude, except for a water polo ball and a feather, on the cover of Time magazine. Horn-Miller was inspired by Mohawk Olympian Alwyn Morris. Following his advice, she has worked hard to share her achievements in hopes of inspiring others to reach for their dreams. In 2014, Horn-Miller was one of seven people suing the Kahnawake Mohawk Council over the \\"marry out, stay out\\" policy, which prevents Mohawks who marry non-Mohawks from staying in the territory. In February 2017, Horn- Miller was announced as the director of community engagement for the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. Horn-Miller stepped down from the inquiry in August. There has been controversy surrounding the operations and a coalition of family members, activists and academics sent a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau demanding the \\"deeply misguided\\" inquiry get a hard reset. ==See also== * List of World Aquatics Championships medalists in water polo ==ReferencesCategory:Canadian female water polo players Category:Sportspeople from Montreal Category:First Nations sportspeople Category:Canadian Mohawk people Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for Canada Category:Water polo players at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic water polo players of Canada Category:20th-century First Nations people Category:21st-century First Nations people Category:Living people Category:1975 births Category:World Aquatics Championships medalists Category:Indspire Awards Category:Pan American Games medalists in water polo Category:Water polo players at the 1999 Pan American Games Category:Carleton Ravens players Category:Stabbing survivors ","title":"Waneek Horn-Miller"},{"id":"35217340","text":"Zygopachylus albomarginis is a species of Neotropical harvestman in the order Opiliones. It is found in the tropical forests of Panama. ==Description== Like other harvestmen, Zygopachylus albomarginis has a small body consisting of a cephalothorax fused with an abdomen, raised on four pairs of long legs. The second pair of legs functions as antennae. It has a pair of eyes on either side of the head. The mouthparts are known as stomotheca and can chew solid food in contrast to the spiders, order Araneae, which can only suck fluids from their prey. ==Reproduction== The male Zygopachylus albomarginis adopts an unusual strategy at breeding time. He lives on the trunk of a tree where he builds a low-walled enclosure with a level floor about across out of mud and fragments of bark. He repairs the area if it gets damaged and prevents the hyphae of fungi from growing across it. When a female approaches and steps into the enclosure they begin a lengthy ritual of leg tapping. She first taps the floor at intervals with one leg and if he accepts her advances he taps her with his legs, otherwise he drives her away with a nip in a soft spot such as a joint in her leg. When accepted, he circles her, tapping her as he does so, and eventually they stand head to head. She grabs his cephalothorax and pulls him forward and he everts his penis and transfers a bundle of sperm into her genital pore. About twenty minutes later, she is ready to deposit her fertilised eggs. The male accompanies her around the enclosure indicating where he wants the eggs placed by further tapping her body and the floor. She bends her legs to partially lower her body and extends her ovipositor to the floor of the enclosure and places an egg there. She then \\"paddles\\" with her front feet near the egg which results in it becoming partially buried. She deposits one or two further eggs in the same way then leaves the enclosure. The male stays on guard. Further females may stray his way and the ritual may be repeated a number of times. If a male approaches he will grapple with it and is usually successful in driving it away. Scouting ants are also repelled, being flicked away. He stays looking after his eggs till they hatch after which he plays no further part in their care. ==References== Category:Harvestmen Category:Endemic fauna of Panama Category:Animals described in 1925 ","title":"Zygopachylus albomarginis"},{"id":"35217356","text":"The Diquis culture (sometimes spelled Diquís) was a pre-Columbian indigenous culture of Costa Rica that flourished from AD 700 to 1530.

In a career that lasted from July 1873 to September 1874 he ran twelve times and won six races. After a promising, but unremarkable two-year-old season in 1873 he improved to become one of the best British colts of his generation, winning the 2000 Guineas and finishing third in The Derby. His success was achieved despite his racing career being adversely affected by his tendency to break blood vessels in his races. Atlantic was the first Classic winner ridden by Fred Archer. After his retirement, Atlantic was exported to France, where he became a successful and influential sire of winners. ==Background== Atlantic was a \\"lightly-framed\\" chestnut horse with a \\"mean\\" temperament, bred by his owner, Evelyn Boscawen, 6th Viscount Falmouth. He was sired by the 1860 Derby winner Thormanby, a direct descendant of the Byerley Turk, out of the mare Hurricane, who had won the 1000 Guineas for Lord Falmouth in 1862. Falmouth sent the colt into training with Mathew Dawson at Heath House stables in Newmarket, Suffolk. ==Racing career== 1873: two-year-old season Atlantic began his career at Goodwood in July when he contested the Ham Produce Stakes. He won easily by three lengths from the future Grand National winner Regal with the filly Apology who went on to win the Fillies' Triple Crown in third place. In August Atlantic finished second in the Convivial Produce Stakes at York, beaten a head by Tipster. After a two-month break, Atlantic returned for the autumn meetings at Newmarket. He was able to claim prize money of £300 without having to race when he walked over for the Buckenham Stakes at the First October meeting, but then finished unplaced behind Feu d'Amour in the Prendergast Stakes. On his final appearance, Atlantic was beaten a short head by Minister in the Glasgow Stakes. Atlantic's performances established him as a colt of some ability, but he appeared to be some way below the best of his generation and was not considered to be one of the major contenders for the following year's Classics. 1874: three-year-old season Engraving of the 1874 2,000 Guineas, from the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News, May 1874 Atlantic began his three-year-old season at the Newmarket Craven meeting in April, where he claimed two more prizes without racing when he was allowed to walk over in two Sweepstakes. On 6 May, Atlantic contested the 2000 Guineas, and started at odds of 10/1 in a field of twelve, with Ecossais being made favourite at 5/4. Ridden by the seventeen-year-old Fred Archer, Atlantic disputed the lead from the start and with two furlongs to travel only Reverberation and Ecossais remained as challengers. The favourite was the first of the three to weaken and after \\"a most exciting set-to\\" Atlantic prevailed by a neck from the fast-finishing Reverberation with Ecossais third and the rest of the field well beaten. Atlantic's victory was the first of Archer's twenty-one Classic winners. Atlantic was one of the leading fancies for the Derby at Epsom despite being regarded as inferior to his trainer's other runner, Aquilo. His cause was not helped when he sustained a knee injury when being loaded onto the train which was to take him from Newmarket to Epsom. In the race Atlantic was settled behind the leaders, but although he made progress in the straight he was unable to reach the front and finished third, beaten two lengths and a neck by George Frederick and Couronne de Fer. It was later reported that he had broken a blood vessel during the race. Following his run in the Derby, Atlantic was sent to Royal Ascot where he ran twice. On the first day of the meeting he finished second to Leotinus, who was carrying twelve pounds less, in the Prince of Wales's Stakes over thirteen furlongs. On the following day he reappeared in the Ascot Derby, the race now known as the King Edward VII Stakes and won from Clairvoyant and The Pique. On his only other racecourse appearance, Atlantic ran in the St Leger at Doncaster in September. He seemed to be unsettled before the race, being described as \\"most difficult to stop\\" after a false start. In the race he appeared to be travelling well in third place but at the mile post he began to struggle and dropped back to last place after again rupturing a blood vessel. He completed the course but never ran again. ==Stud career== At the end of 1874, Atlantic was sold to Baron Arthur de Schickler and exported to France where he was based at his new owner's Chateau Martinvast stud, near Cherbourg. Atlantic sired many notable winners including Fitz Roya (Grand Prix de Paris), Fousi-Yama (Prix du Cadran), Le Capricorn (Grosser Preis von Baden) and Pietra Mala (Richmond Stakes, Gimcrack Stakes, Champagne Stakes). His most important offspring was Le Sancy, who won nineteen consecutive races between 1889 and 1890 and was the paternal great-grandsire of The Tetrarch. Atlantic died at the Martinvast stud in 1891. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1871 racehorse births Category:1891 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 3-b Category:Byerley Turk sire line Category:2000 Guineas winners ","title":"Atlantic (horse)"},{"id":"35217448","text":"The 9th Annual Premios Juventud (Youth Awards) were broadcast by Univision on July 19, 2012.Univision Announces Superstar Nominees for 2012 “Premios Juventud” Awards ==Performers== Univision Announces More Superstar Performers, Celebrity Presenters and Spectacular Surprises for Its 2012 “Premios Juventud” Youth Awards {  !

He played as a pitcher and infielder for the Okazaki Little League club during his elementary years. When he entered Tokai Junior High, he joined the East Nagoya Stars baseball club and changed his position to catcher. In his 2nd year in Meitoku Gijuku High School, he led his team in RBIs during the Kochi prefectural spring baseball tournament, and was also selected to play in friendly matches with USA and Taiwan. His school also won the runner up in the Kochi summer tournament finals in his 3rd year. He hit 13 home runs in his entire high school career. He was chosen by the Orix Buffaloes as their third round pick during the 2007 high school draft. ==Orix Buffaloes== Maishima Stadium, August 2, 2008 2008 He spent his first year training to improve his skills as catcher in the team's Western League games. But due to his young age and lack of experience, he only batted at an average of 0.192 in 40 games with a strike-out rate of 0.25. Defense-wise, he had the most number of passed balls. Nevertheless, he had the most number of game appearances among the team's rookie catchers. He was finally given a chance at the first squad when he made his debut on the September 19 match against the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters. Even though he didn't hit any home runs in any of his League games, he was able to hit two during inter-squad games. 2009 On the spring of his 2nd year, he underwent surgery to treat his herniated disc. Even though he only required 2 weeks of rest after surgery and aimed to return to play after 3 months, he was not given any plate appearances for the season. Also, because his left calf muscle suffered at the aftermath of his surgery, Manager Daijiro Oishi thought it best not to rush him into play.読売新聞夕刊紙2011年1月27～29日 光さす方へ Bs伊藤の闘い 2010 Upon being allowed to play in 2nd squad games after a year of absence, he was reported to have burst into tears when he made his first hit.涙｜TRAINING ROOM 84 He was given another chance to appear in two ichi-gun matches during the latter part of the season. During postseason, he was assigned the jersey number 54, and his former number (61) was assigned to former major-leaguer Chan Ho Park who just joined the team at that time. 2011 With new Manager Akinobu Okada seeing his potential as the team's main catcher, Ito was assigned to the ichi-gun camp and eventually made his way to the team's starting line up. Despite being demoted to ni-gun twice during his occasional slumps, he rose to the occasion when he teamed up with ace Chihiro Kaneko, and his starts gradually increased. And ever since he helped Yuki Nishi achieve his first official win and Hayato Terahara notch his first shutout victory in 3 years, he formed batteries with them in most of their games for the rest of the season. He hit his first career home-run on the May 25 game versus the Swallows. His momentum was halted, however, when his right index finger was fractured in a collision at the home plate with Seibu's Takeya Nakamura during the September 11 match, and he was required to rest for the remainder of the season. Even though he finished with a career-high of 66 games, his batting skills remained below par (0.156 batting average, 0.36 KO rate). He did, however, top the team in fielding with a caught stealing percentage of 0.318. His jersey number was again changed to 22 during postseason. 2012 Throughout the season, he alternated with Fumihiro Suzuki and Toshio Saito as the team's starting catchers. On the April 8 game versus the Eagles, he batted a sacrifice fly to score a run, helped Hiroshi Kisanuki notch a 5-hit shutout win, to experience his first ever hero interview. Four days later, he was hit on the head by a full swing from Josh Whitesell's bat and was carried off the field on a stretcher and taken to a hospital in Chiba, where he was diagnosed with a contusion on the right side of his head. On the offensive, he batted in 36 hits and 10 RBIs, with an improved average of .205. Defense-wise, he was able to team up with most of Orix's pitchers in 66 game appearances. On their last regular season game on October 8, he led the younger Yuki Nishi to accomplish the highly coveted no-hit no-run against the SoftBank Hawks (3-0). The 76th no-hitter in NPB history and the 8th for Orix, the game was only one walk away to being a perfect game. He and Tomotaka Sakaguchi were named Vice Chairmen in the Orix player's meeting during off season. 2013 With the retirement of mainstay catcher Fumihiro Suzuki and Takeshi Hidaka exercising his domestic free agency option, Itoh ultimately became the team's main catcher. With his goal to appear in at least 100 games as main catcher, he played from the season's opening series then steadily continued to deliver in the team's succeeding matches. It came as no surprise therefore when he received the fans' topmost votes among the Pacific League catchers in the All-Star ballot, and went on to experience his first All-Star game in July. He more than doubled his appearances last season to a total of 137 games, breaking Hidaka's previous franchise record of 134 games in 2008. His hitting saw an improvement during the first half of the season (0.30 average), but he went on a hitless slump for the entire August. He recovered in the next two months and batted even better at 0.33, making a season average of 0.285. He even managed to hit consecutive home runs on the October 6 & 7 games versus the Marines. In November, he participated in the 2013 Baseball Challenge, where Japan swept Chinese Taipei in the friendly three-game series. 2014 With the entry of former SoftBank catcher Katsuki Yamazaki, even though Ito appeared in the same number of games as the previous year, his plate appearances decreased. Nevertheless, he managed to surpass his previous record of RBIs by 8 runs. He led the Pacific League in both offense and defense as a catcher, earning himself both Best Nine and Golden Glove awards. He helped Chihiro Kaneko achieve the lowest ERA among this year's NPB pitchers, and together, they were given the League's Battery Award via unanimous panel decision. He was chosen as the player's chairman for 2015 during offseason, and participated in the 2014 Suzuki All-Star Series, a five-game friendly competition with a squad of US major leaguers. ==Playing style== His right arm can throw at a distance of 120 meters, while his 50-meter dash is clocked at 6.0 seconds. Overall, he's a well-rounded player in terms of speed, offense and defense, but his hitting and strikeout rates still have room for improvement.『プロ野球選手データ名鑑2011』宝島社、雑誌66086-81、84ページ He has a reputation for drawing out the best in pitchers by using their strengths to their advantage. ==References *NPB Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Baseball people from Aichi Prefecture Category:Japanese baseball players Category:Nippon Professional Baseball catchers Category:Orix Buffaloes players Category:Yokohama DeNA BayStars players ","title":"Hikaru Ito"},{"id":"35217514","text":"End Play is a 1976 Australian thriller film directed by Tim Burstall and starring George Mallaby, John Waters and Ken Goodlet.

He was attracted to Braddon's novel because it would be simple to film as it was basically a two hander, while also preparing Eliza Fraser (1976). The movie was budgeted at $244,000 but eventually cost $294,000.Scott Murray, 'Tim Burstall', Cinema Papers Sept-Oct 1979 p495, 576 Shooting commenced in January 1975. The two leads, George Mallaby and John Waters, were familiar faces on Australian television at the time.David Stratton, The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival, Angus & Robertson, 1980 p34 ==Reception== The film performed reasonably at the box-office and in 1979 reported that it had just broken even. It also rated highly on television, the rights for which earned Hexagon $70,000. Burstall admitted the film might have been more effective as a TV movie, but says it would have been harder to make a profit that way. The film is rated M in New Zealand for violence and cruelty. ==ReferencesBibliography== * Moran, Albert & Viethm, Errol. Historical Dictionary of Australian and New Zealand Cinema.

The company reports that its products reach more than 7 million students at nearly 8,500 schools in 100 countries. ==History and acquisitions== Naviance was founded in Washington, D.C., in 2002 by Steven R. Swanson, Stephen M. Smith and Shaun Fanning. Its offices are currently located in Arlington, Virginia. In 2007, Naviance was acquired by Hobsons, a subsidiary of the Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT). Like Naviance, Hobsons is a technology company that works in the education field. In 2010, Naviance acquired the college recommendation engine MyFit, which uses data modeling to help students to identify colleges that match them academically and socially. In 2012, Naviance acquired PrepMe, a provider of adaptive learning solutions for PSAT, SAT and ACT test preparation. ==Software== Naviance’s web-based software as a service platform provides students with a variety of features, including college research and matching tools, course planning, career assessment and personality tests, and surveys to help students connect what they are doing in school to what they would like to do once they complete their education. Naviance provides additional functionality to school counselors to track the progress of individual students, communicate and collaborate with students and families, or create reports on their entire student population. Additionally, Naviance’s integration with \\"The Common Application\\" facilitates the submission of college applications, as well as online submission of transcripts, school forms and recommendations through Naviance eDocs. Naviance's scattergrams show the acceptance history of students within a particular high school to a specific college or university using the historical average GPAs and test scores from the high school. A Naviance scattergram is a scatter plot that shows students within a high school who were accepted, denied and wait-listed by a specific college using symbols in the graph legend. In March 2013, the Naviance Student Mobile application was introduced for iOS devices. Naviance Student is a free application that allows students to search for colleges and to manage tasks associated with the college admissions process. In March 2014, Hobsons announced the new Naviance College and Career Readiness Curriculum for middle and high school students. The curriculum, designed in collaboration with Roadtrip Nation, is geared towards helping address the aspirations- achievement gap that exists today in schools. The curriculum is designed to help students develop college knowledge and non-cognitive skills required to succeed in a post-secondary environment. ==Awards and recognition== In 2011, Naviance was included in District Administration magazine’s Reader’s Choice Top 100 Products list. In 2012, District Administration magazine reported that since it began using Naviance two years earlier, Minneapolis Public Schools saw an increase of 30 percent in the number of students who had post-secondary education and career plans, and the number of students attending a four-year college increased by 6 percent. ==See also== * College admissions in the United States * University and college admission * Common Core State Standards Initiative * School counseling * Career assessment ==References== Category:2002 software Category:Software companies based in Virginia Category:Companies based in Arlington County, Virginia Category:Software companies of the United States ","title":"Naviance"},{"id":"35217545","text":"is a Japanese professional baseball pitcher for the Hanshin Tigers in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball league. ==External links== *NPB.com Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Baseball people from Mie Prefecture Category:Japanese baseball players Category:Nippon Professional Baseball pitchers Category:Orix Buffaloes players Category:Hanshin Tigers players Category:2015 WBSC Premier12 players ","title":"Yuki Nishi"},{"id":"35217560","text":"Andheri Raat Mein Diya Tere Haath Mein (Hindi translation: In darkness of night, lamp in your hand, another meaning: In darkness of night, given in your hand) is a Hindi film made in 1986.

He and his wife and son were killed in a drug war related attack for his journalism. Miseal López Solana (1990? - 20 June 2011) is both the son and journalist colleague of Milo Vera at Notiver, and he also died in the same attack. Three journalists from Notiver were killed within a month's time. Veracruz's state governor Javier Duarte de Ochoa promised to investigate Lopez's murder and the murder of 3 other journalists found dead in Veracruz in 2011. The Committee to Protect Journalists said journalists were leaving Veracruz or in hiding after the two Lópezes and Yolanda Ordaz de la Cruz, also of Notiver, were killed, which left the newspaper unable to report on crime and security issues. ==Personal== Miguel Ángel López Velasco, 55, also known by his pen name Milo Vera, was a journalist for the Notiver who was gunned down in his home in Veracruz with his wife and a son. His son Miseal López Solana, in his early twenties, also worked for Notiver. Beginning in the 1990s, the elder López was known as an outspoken columnist who worked on investigative stories about drug trafficking and security matters. the younger López was a photojournalist who focused on police and crime-related stories, and he accompanied his father while reporting. López was survived by at least one son, Miguel Ángel López Solana, who also worked for Notiver, and Reporters Without Borders documented his detention in which he was beaten by federal police in February 2008. The United States granted his son Miguel political asylum in June 2013 with the assistance of the Committee to Protect Journalists. ==Career== López was the deputy editor and also wrote for a column called “Va de Nuez” which involved the topics of kidnappings, corruption, crime, and abuse of authority in the Veracruz area. He worked with Yolanda Ordaz de la Cruz at Notiver. Lopez had been writing for the Notiver for over 20 years before he was found dead on June 20, along with his wife and son in their home. ==Death== In 2007, Milo Vera received a threat from local drug traffickers, which said, \\"We are leaving you a present here (...) Heads are going to roll. Milovela knows it and many others know it too. These heads are for my dad. Yours truly, A son of Mario Sánchez and the New People.\\" Not only did the threat include a human head next to the letter sitting on the front step of the Notiver, but they also misspelled Milo Vera. López said he was not concerned about the threat. On the morning of June 20, 2011, multiple gunmen broke into López's house where they found and shot López around 6 a.m. along with his wife, Agustina Solano, and son, Miseal López Solana. Miguel Ángel López Velasco worked for 20 years at the daily Notiver, a newspaper covering safety matters and drug trafficking. The Notiver has the largest newspaper circulation in this part of Mexico. Juan Carlos Carranza Saavedra was identified as a suspect after Lopez published an article on drug trade in the Veracruz area. Some at the Notiver believed their murder may have been in retaliation to a recent column López wrote on the drug trade in the Veracruz area. ==Impact== Earlier in the year in Veracruz, Noel López Olguín, La Verdad de Jáltipan, was killed. After López, Yolanda Ordaz de la Cruz at Notiver was investigating her friend and colleague's murder when she was killed about a month later, and a note was left by her body that linked her decapitation with the father and son murders. Her death brought to four the journalists killed in Veracruz. Attacks against journalists in the Mexican drug war have been increasing. Veracruz’s governor Javier Duarte de Ochoa pledged that the law would come down on anyone who was linked to Miguel Ángel López Velasco’s murder, as well as all the other murders of journalists in the area. In 2011, 5 journalists were murdered in Mexico and 3 journalists worked for the Notiver. Veracruz is one of the nation’s largest ports and one part of Veracruz is a key corridor for drug trafficking of undocumented aliens and narcotics. The CPJ reported that after Ordaz had been decapitated, five journalists left Notiver, which left the newspaper unable to cover such issues as crime and security. ==Reactions== Irina Bokova, who is the director-general of UNESCO, condemns the murders of López and his family and says that they are trying to stop the violence of the criminals who believe in “silencing the media” on their own terms. Three days following the murder, Veracruz’s state attorney announces that Juan Carlos Carranza Saavedra or “El Ñaca” is the mastermind behind López’s death. No motive was found for why El Ñaca wanted López and his family dead. Further investigation was necessary but nothing was uncovered. A colleague of López and murdered journalist Regina Martinez sought exile in France after intimidation and threats. ==See also== *Mexican Drug War *List of journalists killed in Mexico ==References * Miguel Ángel López Solana Category:1956 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Deaths by firearm in Mexico Category:Assassinated Mexican journalists Category:Journalists killed in the Mexican Drug War Category:2011 crimes in Mexico Category:2011 murders in North America Category:2010s murders in Mexico ","title":"Miguel Ángel López Velasco"},{"id":"35217603","text":"Bobek is a surname.

In the church of San Andrea in Mantua, he sculpted a monument for the Bishop Andreossi (Andreasi) (1549), with a sphinx and bronze swan, flanked by sculptures of Faith and Charity . He also worked for the Cathedral of Carpi and the church of San Domenico in Bologna. He was prolific in his native Reggio Emilia, where he left in a bronze tabernacle; and a monument of Bishop Rangone (Rangoni) in 1567, for which, after five years, he was handsomely paid 1250 gold scudi.

During his career, he became a Judge, a member of the Philippine House of Representatives, Governor of Pampanga and a member of the Senate of the Philippines. When he first ran for public office as governor, the Spanish y in his name was accidentally left out in streamers made by friends, so his name is often cited as \\"Pablo Angeles David\\". == Early life == David Ángeles was born in the town of Bacolor, Philippines in the house of Carlos de los Angeles y de los Reyes (of Barrio San Vicente) and Ceferina David y Mesina (of Barrio San Isidro) on August 17, 1889. Early on (up to 1901), Pablo displayed brilliance as a juvenile student at the private Spanish school (equivalent to present primary and intermediate school) of Don Modesto Joaquin, a former Katipunero. His other students would later grow as famous personalities like Justice Jose Gutierrez David, Nicolas Dayrit and Benigno Aquino, Sr., grandfather of the former Philippine President Benigno Simeon C. Aquino III. He earned the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1906 at Liceo de Manila and the degree in law in 1909 at Escuela de Derecho, the nation's leading law school.[5] In 1910, at the age of 20, he passed the Philippine Bar Examination, placing Third, (after Don Felix Gurrea, #1 and Don Jose Escaler, #2) and became the youngest person to qualify the Philippine Bar Examination. He had to wait another year to take his oath of law. == Career == Bacolor, Pampanga statue David Ángeles chose to serve his province, Pampanga. From 1911 to 1912, he was appointed as Justice of the Peace for Sasmuan, Santa Rita and his hometown of Bacolor. From 1913-1915, he served as Deputy Provincial Fiscal. He was elected for three years as a provincial councilor in 1916 and later in 1918 became chairman of the Census Board. In 1919 he was elected to the House of Representatives for the 1st District of Pampanga. David Angeles became acting Governor of Pampanga at the age of 27 when Don Honorio Ventura was appointed as Secretary of the Interior, being the number one board member. He was elected as governor in 1931 and was re-elected in 1934. He retired to private practice in 1937. But in 1939, he was appointed by the late President Manuel L. Quezon as District Judge of Maasin, the birthplace of his wife, and later was transferred to Bulacan, where World War II overtook him. During the first days of the Japanese Occupation, he was practically forced to serve either as Governor of Pampanga, or as District Judge of Bulacan. He chose the latter as being less sinecure, serving therein as such in Malolos, Bulacan and later in Pampanga. In early December 1944, he was kidnapped in his home by the Hukbalahap/HMB Commander Silvestre Liwanag a.k.a. Linda Bie . Within days of his return to his home, the Japanese Kempeitai seized him as \\"Father of Guerrillas\\" in Pampanga and brought him to San Fernando. Immediately, the late Don Jose Urquico and the late Don Sergio Aquino obtained custody of him from the Kempeitai head, Colonel Suzuki, who was their friend and guaranteed to keep him incomunicado in Tarlac. The reason for the Kempeitai's action was that no prominent personality taken by the HMB had ever been surfaced alive except for Angeles David. They came to the conclusion that Angeles David must have agreed to work for them. Doña Concepcion languished at the arrest of her husband and succumbed on December 24, 1944. When news reached Tarlac of this, Angeles David was allowed to go home to Bacolor, Pampanga, with the understanding that he would return to Tarlac. But he never did. When the family escaped the path of the battles of liberation, Angeles David was again kidnapped by the HMB Commander Linda Bie at Barrio Pulung Masle, Guagua in February 1945 and again brought to Barrio Santa Cruz Pambilog, San Luis. Word got to Sixth U.S. Army's Counter- Intelligence Corps at San Fernando by a boy who overheard the HMB plan to execute him to shut him up. David Angeles once more adamantly refused to openly support the HMB. With the boy as a guide, two American officers jumped into a jeep and drove pellmell to Barrio Santa Cruz Pambilog. They demanded to see him but the commanders led by Pedro Taruc denied he was around. The two officers spoke with certainty that he was there and that in 36 hours, the U.S. Sixth Army would mount an all-out assault at the headquarters of Luis Taruc should Don Pablo not appear to them with sound mind and body. The HMB commanders relented and led them to the hut where he and his son, Ciceron, were detained. While speaking loudly on niceties, they communicated by hand- written notes. The next day, David Angeles and his son, Ciceron, rode a horse- drawn caretela to the CIC headquarters. Many years later, Ciceron recalled sadly that they mutually recognized and hailed many prominent citizens from all over Pampanga there in a weird kind of last gathering as in an execution camp, but they never saw them again years later. As this is being written, there is a national amnesia of this killing field except for Luis Taruc's letter to President Manuel A. Roxas complaining about the \\"fascist governor of Pampanga\\", and boasting later in the same letter that they executed 30,000 fascist traitors.Agoncillo, Teodoro A.& Alfonso, Oscar M. (1967). \\"History of the Filipino People\\". Second Edition. Malaya Books, Quezon City. After the Liberation from the Japanese in World War II, the late President Sergio Osmeña Sr. re-appointed him as District Judge of Bulacan. Nobody wanted to accept the position of Governor of Pampanga as the Pampanga capitol and town halls were occupied by HMB Mayors and bearded dissidents festooned with ammo bandoleers, not only in Pampanga, but in the Central Luzon. The late President Manuel A. Roxas prevailed upon David Angeles to restore the provincial government as Acting Governor of Pampanga in 1945. Beginning from his home town of Bacolor, he formed the Civilian Guards and wrested control of the provincial capitol and the town centers (poblacion) and drove the HukbalahapHMB to the hinterlands (Mount Arayat, Candaba swamps and Zambales mountains). In 1946, he was elected Governor of Pampanga. In one year of administration, he was able to pacify the province sufficiently to enable the farmers to work the farms and produce enough for themselves and their landlords. The late President Manuel A. Roxas again prevailed upon him to run for the Philippine Senate in 1947. He was elected and he served for six years, until 1953. As a senator, he always stood up in the Senate for an \\"Iron Fist\\" policy against the HMB in contrast to the voices urging appeasement. As a senator he was known for his fiery speeches. One such example is of April 1950 expose when he contested President President Elpidio Quirino's announcement that the Hukbalahap rebels had already been decimated. He then revealed that a massacre occurred in his hometown Bacolor, the Maliwalu Massacre (April 7, 1950 Good Friday) which was perpetrated by members of the Civilian Guards/Serrano private army in retaliation for the death of one of their commanders, Captain Nonong Serrano. In the Chinese Immigration Quota Scandal, Senator Pablo Angeles y David was one of the four solons who were cleared of guilt by the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee led by then Senator Lorenzo M. Tañada.Quirino, Carlos. \\"Amang - The Life and Times of Eulogio Rodriguez Sr.\\" New Day Publishers, Quezon City. 1983. == Personal life == At 5' 11\\" tall David Angeles was a towering figure compared to the average Filipino.

It first aired on E4 in the UK on 5 March 2012.http://www.channel4.com/programmes/skins/4od#3325422 Alo still has no idea that Mini is carrying his baby. Fed up of trying to get back to the fun times they used to have, he attempts to get over Mini by hooking up with a new girl, Poppy Champion. She's perfect for Alo and Mini is soon a distant memory. Franky's attempts to make him see sense fall on deaf ears, but Alo's childish choices come back to haunt him and he's soon out of his depth. In a lot of trouble and with nobody to turn to, the boy who stubbornly refused to grow up may have finally run out of time...http://www.channel4.com/programmes/skins/episode- guide/series-6/episode-7 ==Plot== In an effort to get over Mini, Alo starts to pursue a relationship with Poppy Champion, a petite girl who flirted with him at a rave. He takes her for a picnic lunch in the woods in his tractor, and while there, they share a kiss, and Alo asks if she will be his girlfriend. Poppy agrees, and, after performing a dance number to Martin Solveig's \\"Hello\\", while wearing only their underwear, they go upstairs to have sex. However, as Alo is in the middle of the act, he notices several childish toys and posters lining the walls and furniture, and then a school uniform hanging in Poppy's wardrobe, which has a crest on the lapel that he recognises. Suddenly frightened, he stops the sex at once and demands to know how old Poppy is, and she reveals she is thirteen. Alo, horrified that he is now technically a paedophile, tells Poppy that she is too immature to understand what they did wrong. He flees from her house, narrowly avoiding her parents arguing in the kitchen. After explaining the situation to Rich, and having Franky attempt to persuade him to get back together with Mini, Alo resolves to go to Poppy's house and break up with her. However, it is her fourteenth birthday and Poppy has been bragging to her friends about it, resulting in Alo's break-up attempt causing her utmost humiliation and devastation. In her anger, Poppy reports Alo to the police, resulting in him being dragged out of his exam, charged with statutory rape and suspended from school. Alo fails to convince anyone that he did not know Poppy was underage, mostly due to his inability to say the right thing and their refusal to listen, but is eventually bailed out by Rich, the only person who hasn't turned their back on Alo. Alo reluctantly calls Poppy and berates her for her actions, but as she is about to apologise, the phone is grabbed by her aggressive father, who threatens Alo and hangs up. Alo runs away from home and starts to sleep in a playground - despite his reputation. Realising that Mini is the root of his troubles, he goes to her house and confronts her. Although she forces him to leave, he manages to get through to her and tell her that he doesn't like her as she is behaving, causing her to cry. After living rough a little longer and pondering running away, Alo is eventually found by Dewi, his family's farmworker, who tells him his parents are both worried about him, before comparing him to Peter Pan and giving him money if he does want to run away. Deciding to stay and sort his problems out, he goes to Poppy's house to confront her parents. There, Poppy tells her parents that what she told the police was a lie, only for a massive argument to erupt between Poppy's parents, and Alo, seeing how upset Poppy is with it, ends it by bellowing at the two to shut up. He tells the father that Poppy's allegations are true, and he indeed engaged in sexual activity with her without knowledge of her age. Unfortunately, he ends up getting beaten up and then thrown out by Poppy's father, who tells him that he will see him in court. Alo picks himself up and returns home. The next day, Mini comes to his farm and confronts him, but just as she is about to tell Alo about her pregnancy, Alo receives a phonecall from Poppy, who tells him that her parents have split up, and that her mother has forced her father to drop the charges and threatened to report him for beating Alo up the night before. They part on good terms, but Alo hangs up to find that Mini has gone.http://www.channel4.com/programmes/skins/4od#3297045 ==References== Category:Skins (British TV series) episodes Category:2012 British television episodes ","title":"Alo (Skins series 6)"},{"id":"35218171","text":"Horus Bird, also known as Horus-Ba, is the serekh-name of a pharaoh who may have had a very short reign between the First and Second Dynasty of Egypt. == Name sources== There are very few reliable name sources for Horus-Bird. The first known attestation of this king may be a serekh with an undetailed bird found by Flinders Petrie in the tomb of Qa'a at Abydos. Another more legible inscription showing a serekh with a bird was later found on a vessel fragment PD IV n.108 in Djoser's pyramid complex at Saqqara. An inscription on a schist vase (P.D. IV n.97) from Djoser's pyramid complex could also refer to Horus- Bird.Wolfgang Helck: Geschichte des Alten Ägypten. Brill, Leiden 1981, , page 34-35. Since the hieroglyphic sign is written in such an erratic way, the correct reading remains uncertain. Whilst Egyptologists such as Wolfgang Helck and Peter Kaplony see a depiction of a goose, they read the name as Sa (which would make it a “Son of Horus”) or as Geb(eb) (which would make it an \\"Heir of Horus\\"). Egyptologist Nabil Swelim instead sees a depiction of a sattle-billed stork and reads Ba (making it a “Soul of Horus”).Nabil Swelim: Some Problems on the History of the Third Dynasty. In: Archaeological and Historical Studies, vol. 7. The Archaeological Society of Alexandria, Alexandria 1983 == Identity == Very little is known about King Horus-Bird. The few archaeological evidences point to the existence of one or more ephemeral rulers following Qa'a's death and before Hotepsekhemwy of which Horus-Bird may have been one. Egyptologists such as Jaroslav Černý and Kaplony think that Horus-Bird could be identical to the likewise sparsely attested King Horus-Ba. Indeed, this ruler wrote his name with the leg sign or the leg and ram signs, which read \\"Ba\\". Černý and Kaplony think that the bird in the serekh of Horus-Bird is the goose sign with the same transcription, \\"Ba\\".Peter Kaplony: Horus Ba?. In: Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Institut Kairo. Volume 20. von Zabern, Mainz 1965, page 3 & 4. In this case Horus-Ba and Horus \\"Bird\\" could be the same historical figure. Černý and Kaplony's theory is not commonly accepted; the presence of the Horus-Bird serekh in the tomb of Qa'a pointing rather to an interregnum with Horus-Bird between the first and second dynasties. Egyptologists such as Wolfgang Helck and Peter Kaplony believe that Horus Bird and Sneferka fought each other to gain the throne of Egypt. The struggles peaked in the plundering of the royal cemetery of Abydos, which was therefore abandoned. The struggle for the throne was possibly brought to an end by the founder of the 2nd dynasty, king Hotepsekhemwy. A piece of evidence supporting this theory is the Horus name of Hotepsekhemwy which means \\"The two powers are reconciled\\", and could relate to a re-unification of the Egyptian realm after a period of discord.Peter Kaplony: „Er ist ein Liebling der Frauen“ – Ein „neuer“ König und eine neue Theorie zu den Kronprinzen sowie zu den Staatsgöttinnen (Kronengöttinnen) der 1./2.

It is based on thework by Norman Wilwayco, who also co-wrote the script with Khavn. It premiered at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in January 2012. Mondomanila merges drama, musical, horror, experimental, and exploitation cinema. It tells the story of teenage anti-hero Tony de Guzman and the rough neighborhood he calls home. ==Plot== Tony de Guzman is an anti-hero. Life, according to him, is short, brutal and is never on your side. Grab what you can, when you can. Settle scores. Be randy. Defy the rules. Cheat the system. Tough it out. Tony knows nothing but tough times living, as he does, in the bleak circus of the slums he calls home amongst denizens of the underworld: the crippled pimp, the lonely housewife, the neighborhood gay and his macho father, the prostitutes, the small-time politician, and the Yankee pedophile. This is his story and the story of the world he lives in: a hopeless, closed-in decrepit world gone to seed.

However, unlike his other features, Mondomanila took Khavn nine years and numerous attempts, to make. Mondomanila entered production in 2003 but was stopped after the first day because of major miscasting issues. Most of the scenes were scrapped; what Khavn managed to salvage became parts of another film, Mondomanila: Overdosed Nightmare, which premiered at the Cinemalaya International Film Festival in 2008. Writes critic Richard Bolisay: > \\"This film has lived up to its name—cranky, blasphemous, berserk, > carnivorous—for the nightmare is not only overdosed, it is sacrilegious, the > darkness is so imperial it looks like a work of evil, a devil of a craftsman > Khavn is—and there is no point in deconstructing its stark elements because > it only extinguishes the fire. The surrealist at work subscribes to absolute > nihilism. The motive is anarchy. The enemy is false religion.\\" In 2004, Khavn shot Mondomanila: Institute of Poets based on the short story which won a Palanca in 2000. The short film, which starred Filipino actor Marvin Agustin, premiered at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2005, and was singled out by Brazilian critic Jorge Didaco, then writing for Senses of Cinema, as one of the ten best films of 2005. In between 2004 and 2009, Khavn worked on varying versions of the screenplay; one was a ten-hour epic which, though more faithful to the novel, had to be abandoned for practical reasons: cost would have been enormous and Khavn could not find project backers. In 2006, Mondomanila was one of the four projects awarded the first ever Digital Production Grant by the Hubert Bals Fund. Khavn used this seed money to polish the screenplay. The final version of Mondomanila entered production in 2009. This time around, it was co-produced by the German film company, Rapid Eye Movies, co-managed by Stephan Holl and Antoinette Köster. In 2010, Khavn screened a work in progress version of Mondomanila at the MFMF! Mondomanila FilmFest Motherf%*#ers and the Cinemanila International Film Festival. The rough cut won for Khavn Best Director. House of Film, a Beverly Hills-based sales company, for worldwide distribution is the world sales agent of Mondomanila. ==Reception== In an interview with Festival Scope during the film's premiere in Rotterdam, Khavn was asked why he did not choose to do a literal adaptation of the novel. He explained: Twitch Film's Oggs Cruz points out that Mondomanila \\"will probably draw comparisons with the films of John Waters, for its unabashed obnoxiousness, and Alejandro Jodorowsky, for its unabashed strangeness. However, the film is a strange creature altogether, more venomous than any of Waters’ trash and more useful than any of Jodorowsky’s excesses.\\" Indiocine's Macky Macarayan found some of the characters confusing, and believes a traditional ending featuring the narrator would have served the film better. But he praises the film for being a very honest social commentary, calling it \\"raw, uninhibited, and unforgiving\\". \\"Everything is exaggerated, meant as an inverse, or metaphorically presented. Subtlety is not in Khavn's vocabulary; he likes to confront the issues head on, but at least he has some style. Like Nolan's Inception you have to dig further.\\" One viewer notes that in the film, Khavn combines the abrasive aspects of his two other films, Squatterpunk and The Family That Eats Soil, to \\"transvaluate Julia Kristeva's notions of the abject and turns it from a source of horror to something darkly humorous\\". Film blogger Sanriel Ajero finds Mondomanila \\"quite offensive, as one would expect from the sick mind of Khavn, and by this virtue alone, should warrant a divisive reaction from its audience\\" but praises its vision. \\"Personally, I’m with the half that enjoyed the hell of it. Surely one of the few brave local directors we have now, that continually pushes the boundaries of violence and gore, even of lyricism and poetry.” Lagarista's Dodo Dayao calls Mondomanila \\"Glee on crack\\", likening it to Dusan Makavejev’s Sweet Movie but calls it \\"quintessential Khavn. Only with a grander sense of culmination.\\" ==References External links == * * * Ruined Hearts And Zombie Storm Operas: Khavn in 2012 — An Interview with Dodo Dayao for Lagarista * This is not Mondomanila — An Interview with Ping Medina for the Philippine Star * A Conversation with Khavn De La Cruz — An Interview with Yusef Sayed for Film International Category:2012 films Category:Tagalog- language films Category:Philippine films Category:Films based on Philippine novels ","title":"Mondomanila"},{"id":"35218177","text":"Derrick George Johnson Mullins (born July 28, 1989) is a Costa Rican professional footballer who currently plays as a defender for Costa Rican Primera Division side Limón. ==Club career== Before signing with Limón in 2011, Johnson had considered signing with Guatemalan side Comunicaciones and Major League Soccer.

The only species presently known is Pseudonaraoia hammanni (the genus is monotypic). == Etymology == The genus name indicates the likeness to the related genus Naraoia. The species was named in honor of Dr. Wolfgang Hammann (†2002), the outstanding German palaeontologist who studied both trilobites and naraoids. == Description == P. hammanni is almost flat (dorso-ventrally). The upper (or dorsal) side of the body consists of a non-calcified headshield (cephalon) and tailshield (pygidium) of about equal length, without any body segments in between. The body is strongly narrowed at the articulation between cephalon and pygidium. Both shields have a narrow border, reminiscent of some effaced agnostid trilobites. The axis is not defined by furrows. There are no eyes. Appendages and internal organs are not yet known.  Differences with other Naraoiidae  Naraoia and Misszhouia are narrowed, less pronounced at the articulation between cephalon and pygidium. Only Naraoia bertiensis shares a marginal border with P. hammanni, but it can be distinguished by its slightly pointed pygidial termination. == Distribution == Pseudonaraoia has been collected from lower part of the Šárka Formation, Middle Ordovician (Darriwillian), at a temporary exposure of the Červený vrch Hill, in Prague, representing the Barrandian Basin, Czech Republic. == Ecology == All naraoids were probably marine bottom dwellers. P. hammanni lived in an environment that was most probably poor in oxygen. == Taxonomic history == Only one entire exoskeleton and one pygidium have been found. The authors that described Pseudonaraoia, note its resemblance to effaced agnostids such as Leiopyge, that are contemporary. They cannot rule out that Pseudonaraoia might actually represent a freak composite of the cephalon and pygidium of such an agnostid, without its two thorax segments. However, no agnostids are known as large as about 1¾cm from the Middle Ordovician. Leiopyge also has a prominent marginal pygidial furrow. Later scholars seem to accept the validity of the genus. ==References== Category:Nektaspida Category:Ordovician arthropods Category:Fossils of the Czech Republic ","title":"Pseudonaraoia"},{"id":"35218335","text":"Dinacoma is a small genus of beetles in the scarab family (Scarabaeidae).

Complete Aikido, Tuttle Publishing, 1998.Suenaka, R. & Watson, C. \\"Spiritual Versus Martial Aikido – Explanation & Reconciliation,\\" Journal of Asian Martial Arts, Vol. 5 # 1, 1996.Wadokai Aikido ==Early life== As a child in Hawaii, Suenaka suffered from severe asthma, which was treated by his grandfather with reiki. He began martial arts training with his father, Warren Suenaka, from an early age, learning the family styles of jiujitsu and kenjitsu. Suenaka credits this training with the remission of his asthma. As well as training with his father, Suenaka also studied under Henry Okazaki and James Mitose. He also studied judo. Suenaka attended Koichi Tohei's aikido demonstrations in 1953, and at his father's behest began training primarily in that art. He also took up the study of kendo in 1955. ==Military career== In 1958, Suenaka enlisted in the United States Air Force. In 1960, although he originally planned on becoming a pilot, he put this on hold to go to Japan to study under O'Sensei. He worked primarily as an electrician and engineer. At his request, he was transferred in 1961 to Tachikawa Air Base in Japan, which enabled him to study directly under Morihei Ueshiba at the Hombu dojo in Tokyo. Effectively employed as the personal electrician of his commanding officer, Suenaka was able to subcontract most of his work to the barracks houseboy. This enabled him to spend most of his time in Japan living and training at the Hombu dojo. He also spent time training at the Kodokan under Kyuzo Mifune. In 1961 he was transferred again to Naha, Okinawa. At the airbase there, he set up his own dojo, and aikido became popular with the servicemen stationed there.Black Belt Magazine May 1972, p11 ==Wadokai Aikido== Wadokai Aikido is an aikido organization founded by Suenaka in 1975 and it is based in Charleston, South Carolina.Andalusia Star: Aikido master shares extensive knowledge Retrieved 08.02.2012 Wadokai teaches Suenaka-ha Tetsugaku-ho Aikido, which means \\"Suenaka style, philosophical way.\\" Wadokai Aikido has dojo throughout the United States and China.Wadokai Dojo List Suenaka was a 1st generation student of aikido founder Morihei Ueshiba.

This philosophy is where the term \\"Complete Aikido\\" comes from. Suenaka received a menkyo kaiaden from Ueshiba in 1961 when he was stationed at Tachikawa Air Base in Japan.

Today there are three animals that gained the status as Indonesian faunal emblems: Komodo dragon, Javan hawk-eagle and Asian arowana. Next to national animal symbols, there are also more specific provincial faunal emblems that represent each respective provinces of Indonesia. ==Indonesian national faunal emblems== Komodo is an Indonesian endemic animal found only in Komodo, Padar and Rinca island within Komodo National Park. The surviving largest lizard on earth is easily recognised as Indonesian national animal. Komodo also become the emblem of East Nusa Tenggara province. Elang Jawa or Javan hawk-eagle (Nisaetus bartelsi) an endangered raptor endemic to the mountainous forest regions of Java. The Javan hawk-eagle was chosen because its resemblance to the Garuda Pancasila, the most obvious physical traits is the prominent crest crowning its head and the plumage coloured dark- brownish to chestnut-gold. By Presidential decree, the Javan hawk-eagle was legally registered as considered as the national bird of Indonesia, and thus attributing the endangered species very high protection. Keputusan Presiden No. 4/1993, issued on 10 January 1993, the status of Elang Jawa (Javan hawk- eagle) as the national bird of Indonesia (Widyastuti 1993, Sözer et al. 1998). Both arwana merah (super red Asian arowana) and arwana emas (golden Asian arowana) are designated as Indonesian national animal of charm and also national fish. These fish are endemic to rivers of Sumatra and Indonesian Borneo. Both species of Scleropages aureus (red-tailed golden arowana) is native to northern Sumatra, while the Scleropages legendrei (super red arowana) is native to Kapuas river and nearby lakes in West Kalimantan. { border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 style=\\"border-collapse: collapse; background:#f8f8f8;\\" - !align=leftStatus !

Community United KC is funded by donations and by other charitable agencies, and works closely with Kansas City Police Department and Kansas City's existing social services framework to provide liaisons between the disenfranchised, and leadership of Kansas City's public and private sectors. ==Mission== The group and its clientele are ethnically and religiously-mixed, accepting and drawing upon common themes in diverse religious beliefs ranging from Christianity to Islam to Scientology to the Latter-day Saint Movement, to Soka Gakkai Buddhism and so forth: its Mission Statement recommends that personnel and clientele pursue \\"belief in God\\". Beginning with a September 17, 2011 meeting and a declaration signed by dozens of community activists in Kansas City wishing to do whatever they could to help \\"stop the violence\\" or \\"stop the killing\\" in the area, Christian Pastor Tony Caldwell of Community United KC (lately also named \\"New Community United KC\\") along with Captain Vincent Muhammad of the Nation of Islam (NOI) shepherded the establishment on March 3, 2012 of a formal organization \\"Stop The Killing KC\\" whose mission statement was that day voted to remain the same as the mission statement for Community United KC:\\"...to take our City and Youth back from the drugs, poverty, poor health care, crime activities, and most of all Low Education and to restore high family morals with a strong ties to Religion with GOD always first.\\" ==History== A version of the group's outline history is as follows: :Community United KC was first formed to help shut down several drug houses in Kansas City, Missouri in 1997. :The group was asked to sponsor a basketball game between the Jackson County Missouri Prosecuting Attorneys' Office and Kansas City Missouri Police Department, and local drug dealers. The \\"bet\\" was that if the drug dealers lost, they would shut down 80% percent of their drug houses; if the police and prosecutors' departments lost the game, the police department and prosecutors' office would help with a re-education and jobs program for all involved in the basketball game. :After the game, Community United's popularity grew throughout Kansas City. In 1998 the group started a movement in the Vineyard Gardens to stop one of the most crime-ridden areas which Kansas City had ever experienced. Out of a two-bedroom house Community United started a job- training program and reading program, and budgeted programs and places where young people could come to get on computers and hang out and talk to some mentors. Charlie Parker Square Tenant's Association :This went over so well that the Kansas City Missouri City Council in 1999 asked Community United to help spread more programs throughout Kansas City. They took on a housing complex called Charlie Parker Square where local gangs had taken over to the point where management was run out of their own offices. But the men and women of Community United started a Tenants Association and showed the tenants how to reclaim their apartment complex. The lower level of the clubhouse was transformed into a community center by Community United with games, computers, tutoring and after-school programs, cooking classes and lots more for the tenants and surrounding areas of Charlie Parker Square. Partnership with Harvesters :In the year 2000, Community United moved to 9th Street and Prospect Avenue, where the programs grew to include feeding not only the kids in the neighborhood, but the entire Northeast Kansas City Missouri community. They partnered with Harvesters to start bringing in semi-trucks of food to be distributed to the public. The first load was 3 semi-truckloads of canned goods, cereals, meats and vegetables. They fed over 5,000 families. Post- release renovation program :In 2001 they hosted the first community debate for city council in a religious sanctuary. This put Community United in the forefront of political developments within Kansas City. The year 2002 saw the birth of the housing program where persons coming out of jail or off the streets were given the opportunity to work on building a house and learning skills and sometimes moving into the houses they helped create. This program helped renovate much of the blight in the city's urban core. :In 2003-2011, Community United started neighborhood cleanups, the group attracted more than 150 members who helped with cleanups, community projects, mentoring programs, after-school programs, meal provision programs, and much more. Friends of Construction :In 2004 there was an outcry about construction industry in Kansas City area not having enough minority laborers. Out of the controversy grew the group \\"Friends of Construction\\" which monitored and helped train minorities in the field of construction and skilled building. Prospect Avenue Corridors violence :The year 2005 was unfortunately a record year for homicide rates in Kansas City, Missouri. Once again, Kansas City turned to Community United to help with the Prospect Avenue Corridor murders, the gun violence, and to help bring together a \\"Peace Summit\\" between rival gangs of Kansas City. Community United began patrolling the streets all hours of the night, and this helped lead to the arrest of those allegedly responsible for the \\"Corridor\\" killings. In May of 2005, Community United was involved in the \\"Troost [Avenue] Fest[ival]\\". Its members slept on the streets nearby the night before, to pray for peace and start the Festival on a somber note. Thanksgiving Day food parcels :In 2006, Community United was able to rally enough support throughout Kansas City to sponsor 12 semi-Truckloads of food to be distributed the day before Thanksgiving Day. This fed more than 16,000 families, and the event was reported by CNN. Peacekeepers :In 2007, there was reportedly a shooting or murder every other day in Kansas City. Missouri. Community United called for a \\"State of Emergency\\" on the Kansas City Missouri Council floor, and for a march which then came from all four directions to end up on the crime-ridden intersection of Linwood Boulevard and Prospect Avenue. Out of the success of this march came a plea to all the men and fathers of Kansas City Missouri to \\"stand up\\" and become peacekeepers: The group \\"Peacekeepers\\" was formed, and over five hundred African-American men accepted and acted upon the concept that \\"it takes a whole village to raise one child.\\" :In 2008, the \\"Peace Keepers\\" reclaimed more of the city, with more after-school programs, mentoring programs, and they appointed neighborhood block captains, and neighborhood watches. :In 2009-2011, Community United concentrated on the abandoned houses and vacant lots, and strengthening the housing programs to help with the homeless. :These are just some of the accomplishments of Community United throughout the past fifteen years. ==New Community United KC== :From 2010, the \\"New Community United/A Better Tomorrow\\", formed to help today's youth find a better world.

He was stabbed in front of his home on 19 September 2011. ==Death== Xiang was stabbed ten times by unknown killers in the early morning on his way home in Luoyang, which is the central province of Henan, China. His laptop was stolen by the assailants. Police assume the reason for Li's stabbing in Xigong District was because of his interest in a \\"gutter\\" cooking oil scam, in which 32 people were caught; the last post on his microblog said web users \\"had complained that Luanchuan county, in Henan, has dens manufacturing gutter cooking oil, but the food safety commission replied that they didn't find any.\\" ==Context== Reporters Without Borders is thoroughly convinced that Li's death was caused by his recent research on the oil scam: \\"We hope the authorities will carry out a thorough investigation and will seriously consider the possibility that Li was killed in connection with his work as a journalist.\\" Since the death of Li, the International Federation of Journalists has reported that at least three journalists were being harassed and assaulted. The IFJ has continually been pushing Meng Jianzhu, who is the Minister of the Security Bureau of China, to converse with the All-China Journalists Association to create a safety plan for media workers as well as to educate government officials and the general public on the need to respect press freedom. ==Reactions== You Kai, the deputy director of the office where Li had worked since 2006, told police that Li had shifted from reporting agricultural topics to legal news two months before his death. Although his beat rarely involved investigative work, most of his reports sourced the procuratorate and judicial authorities. He also pointed out that the last blog was updated by other media. ==Personal== Li Xiang was a 30-year-old TV reporter who was always interested in reporting on criminal cases. Li had been following the story of restaurants illegally recycling cooking oil, a dangerous health hazard to diners. He blogged a lot about different ideas and thoughts on a site similar to Twitter. Li's parents refused to comment after the murder of Li but his colleagues described him as \\"outgoing, honest\\" and good at his job.

In 1966 he graduated from the University of Chicago advised by Israel Herstein, with a thesis titled \\"On rings with polynomial identities\\". From 1966 he was Assistant Professor at the University of Rome, 1970 associate professor at the University of Lecce, and 1971 at the University of Pisa. From 1973 he was full professor in Pisa and in 1975 ordinary Professor at the Sapienza University of Rome. He was a visiting scientist at Columbia University (1969–1970), the University of California, Los Angeles (1973/74), at the Instituto Nacional de Matemática Pura e Aplicada, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1991), at the University of Grenoble, at Brandeis University (1981/2), at the University of Texas at Austin (1984), the Institute for Advanced Study (1994), the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (1992, etc.), at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, and at the École Normale Supérieure.

A son of a university English professor and an opera singer mother, Evett excelled at music; first playing the ukulele at the age of 11, progressing to the classical guitar and giving his first professional performance at the age of sixteen. He then won a classical guitar scholarship, but dropped out before graduating to play in rock bands around the US. Ned Evett began playing fretless guitar in 1990 on a modified stratocaster. He first appeared in print in Fingerstyle Magazine's 'Bizarre Guitars' profile, who stated \\"Ned Evett will make you reconsider the plucked-string instrument\\". Ned Evett developed the use of glass fingerboards for fretless guitar in 1996. In 1996 Ned Evett played the fretless glass-necked guitar with Warner Brothers Recording artists Built To Spill, on their album \\"The Normal Years\\". In 2003, Evett won the North American Rock Guitar Competition and, in 2004, PBS Television broadcast a documentary about the competition titled Driven To Play. The competition launched a series of high-profile opening concert performances for Evett with notable musicians, including Joe Satriani, The Allman Brothers, John Fogerty, George Thorogood, Eric Johnson, Kansas, and Leon Russell. In December 2003, USA Today described Ned Evett as \\"The perfectly sane and vastly entertaining master of the fretless glass-neck guitar\\". In 2007, Guitar Player Magazine described Ned Evett as \\"The world's first fretless guitar rockstar\\". In 2012, Ned Evett released \\"Treehouse\\", his sixth solo record, produced in Nashville Tennessee by musician Adrian Belew.

In 1901 he appeared for the first time at the newly dedicated folk park in Norrköping. He took part in local revues there for many years, and was on the folk park circuit until the end of the 1940s. A long-term contract enabled him to become one of Sweden's most prolific recording artists with over two hundred sides to his credit. His motto was: \\"Above all else, be original!\\" Calle Lindström. atspace.cc. Retrieved: June 21, 2019. Calle Lindström had perhaps the most varied background of any peasant comic. Born in 1868, in his youth he was a circus artist, who worked in every facet of the entertainment industry. The concertina was his instrument as he regaled audiences despite missing four fingers on his right hand — he had to turn the instrument upside down and hide the disfigured hand with a handkerchief. He sometimes used a method of presentation called the \\"tintamarresque theater\\". A common practice in Swedish variety halls, the performer would stand behind a photographed foreground and slip his head through an opening in the picture for comic effect.På Nöjets Estrader by Uno Myggan Ericson, (Stockholm: Bonnier, 1971) pp. 71-82. Lindström's 1908 recording of Chikago achieved popularity on both sides of the Atlantic. The song, whose music and lyrics he wrote, has been recorded by many artists since then and published in Swedish and American songbooks. Chicago was one of the major urban centers for Swedish immigrants. Lasse from Ossebo, the character in the song, has heard many marvelous things about Chicago from his brother who lives there. He is impressed by the stockyards and the elevated railway, but perhaps even more by the fact that \\"at night it's just like daytime, there are so many lights\\" — and \\"everybody smokes cigars instead of chewing snuff.\\" Lasse decides to go there himself: \\"And there I'll make my fortune and be a proper gent. Good-bye to each and all of you, it's time now that I went!\\" Memories of Snoose Boulevard (Minneapolis: Olle i Skratthult Project, 1972). The humorist Albert Engström coined the word \\"Grönköping\\" in 1895 as a caption for some of his drawings, thereby inventing the fictional Swedish town of the same name. In 2002 the CD Grönköping Tar Ton was issued in Sweden to commemorate one hundred years of Grönköpings Veckoblad (Grönköping's Weekly), a satirical monthly magazine that was founded in 1902. The album, depicting Grönköping in recordings made between 1908 and 1946, has two recordings by Calle Lindström .Grönköping Tar Ton (Stockholm: Ancha, 2002). ==Legacy== Calle Lindström never visited the United States, but some of his songs and stories made the journey. Several of his recordings were repackaged for the American market and issued on Victor Records.Swedish recordings in America archive.org. Retrieved: March 7, 2018. Songs such as Sven Svenssons Sven and Josefin mä symaskin (Josefin with the sewing machine) were recorded in New York City by other Swedish-born artists. In 1972 the Swedish actor John Harryson released cover versions of two songs written by Lindström.John Harryson sjunger bondkomikernas visor (Stockholm: Knäppupp, 1972).

Many of the titles published by Carstens were older than the company, and have long established histories in their respective markets. Carstens was the chief competitor to Kalmbach Publishing in the scale model hobby and enthusiast field. What made Carstens stand out from the competition was the in-depth detail and active voice of the books and magazines. The company's list of monthly magazine titles included: * Railroad Model Craftsman * Railfan & Railroad * Flying Models The company also published a line of annuals dedicated to modeling narrow gauge railways and railroad photography, which included: * The On30 Annual * The HOn3 Annual * Great Railroad Photography Carstens also published a number of books on the subject of railroad history and scale model railroading, as well as a few select titles related to the world of aviation and model airplanes. ==Early years== The roots of the company go back to 1933 with the establishment of The Model Craftsman magazine in Chicago by Emanuele Stieri, and edited by Harold V. Loose. Charles A. Penn took over the company in 1934, and the publishing house established offices in New York City. In 1942, the company was moved across the Hudson River to suburban Ramsey, New Jersey. When it was started, the magazine focused on all kinds of home hobbycraft, but in 1948 the magazine was renamed Railroad Model Craftsman, focusing on the model railroading hobby exclusively. It is this distinction that prompted rival publication Model Railroader to proclaim \\"Model railroading exclusively since 1934.\\" ==Penn Publications postwar era== In 1952, Harold Carstens (known to his friends as \\"Hal\\") joined the staff as an associate editor. He had been a contributor to the magazine before coming on board as a full-time staff member. He moved up the editorial ranks and was named president of the company following the retirement of Charles Penn in 1962. In 1955 the company moved to larger quarters in an old telephone company building on Arch Street in Ramsey. A second move placed the company in the historic Ramsey Journal building right alongside the Erie Railroad main line and across the street from the Ramsey train station in July 1963. Hal Carstens purchased the company outright from Charles Penn later that year and renamed it Carstens Publications in 1969. ==Expansion to present day== In 1969, Flying Models magazine was acquired by the company, adding coverage of the model airplane hobby. In 1973, the company relocated to its current headquarters in rural Newton, New Jersey. The new Railfan magazine was established in-house in 1974, dedicated to the railroad enthusiast and the hobby of railfanning. In 1979, Carstens purchased the old Railroad magazine, which started publication in 1906, and combined it to form Railfan & Railroad magazine. In 2006, Carstens Publications launched the successful On30 Annual, a special publication dedicated to the modeling of narrow gauge railways in O scale. This was followed up in 2009 with the establishment of the HOn3 Annual, which focuses on HO scale narrow gauge modeling. Both annuals are edited by Chris Lane. In 2010, the editors of Railfan & Railroad launched a special edition titled Great Railroad Photography, which was a showcase for innovative and creative photography both contemporary and vintage. Henry Carstens was the company's last president and publisher, having taken over after his father Hal Carstens' untimely death in June 2009. He was assisted by his mother, Phyllis Carstens. ==Permanent closure== After years of financial struggle, Carstens Publications president Henry Carstens announced the company's permanent closure on August 22, 2014. On September 1, 2014, White River Productions announced its acquisition of Railfan & Railroad as well as sister publication Railroad Model Craftsman, as well as the entire line of Carstens books. White River Productions has announced its intention to continue the publication of RMC and Railfan & Railroad, as well as develop new book titles in the future. White River Productions also purchased the rights to produce the On30 Annual and HOn3 Annual. There has been no announcement made by Carstens regarding the future of Flying Models. ==Notes * Category:Magazine publishing companies of the United States Category:Book publishing companies based in New Jersey Category:Publishing companies established in 1933 Category:Companies based in Sussex County, New Jersey Category:Rail transport publishing companies ","title":"Carstens Publications"},{"id":"35219178","text":"Ian Gaynair (born February 26, 1986) is a Belizean professional defender currently playing for Belmopan Bandits.

He comes from a family of potters in a town noted for the craft. He began molding figures as a child and received artistic training when he was 18. His work has been exhibited in Mexico, the U.S. and Europe and he has been recognized as an artist as well as an artisan. Today, he is also the director of the Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca (MEAPO) in his hometown. In 2014, Martínez was awarded Mexico's National Prize for Arts and Sciences ==Formation== Catrina figure in barro negro by the artisan Carlomagno grew up in San Bartolo Coyotepec which has a ceramics tradition that extends back to the pre Hispanic period. The local speciality is “barro negro” or black clay, which gets its color from the properties of the clay when handled in a specific way. Most potters still use techniques from the pre Hispanic period, especially in molding although there have been innovations in firing. His grandparents as well as parents, Antonio Eleazar Pedro Carreño and Glafira Martínez Barranco, worked the local clay. His father began experimenting with more creative forms in order to earn more money for the family’s work and both parents taught their children to be proud of the work they do. His first name, Carlomagno, is the Spanish version of Charlemagne who his grandmother Magdalena Carreño admired greatly. His father gave him the name in honor of his mother. Father Eleazar Pedro Carreño Carlomagno began to work with ceramics when he was a child, making figures such as Aztec warriors, Mexican soldiers and clowns, based on images he saw in books. In 1982, when he was 18, he enrolled in the Rufino Tamayo Workshop in the city of Oaxaca. This training allowed him to learn to bridge the gap between handcrafts/folk art and fine art. He received the Premio Nacional de La Juventud Presidencia de la República in 1987 which led to a scholarship to student in the United States from the US Embassy in Mexico in 1989. When he was 31, he began teaching classes to children in Coyotepec, which led to the formation of a large group concentrated on creating figures in clay, which he himself was learning to use the potters’ wheel. ==Inspiration and creation== \\"Tzompantli\\" at the Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca. Carlomagno states that he uses the clay to express his emotions much the ways other paint or write. Although most of his pieces are based on traditional characters of Oaxaca, they also include humorous depictions of modern personalities and events. His pieces are primarily based on local legends and myths as well as mestizo religious traditions such as the burial of Jesus, and Christ on the cross. One of Carlomagno’s inspirations for his work has been local festival and carnivals. One of these is the feast day of his hometown to honor Saint Peter. Another theme that recurs in his work is that of death, but they are not dramatic or grotesque. One reason for the theme is that it complements the color, which can give a sense of mystery. Two of his popular figures is called “Nuestra Abuela” (Our Grandmother), which is a representation of death and the Zapotec god of fire. He has created sculpted versions of figures drawn by José Guadalupe Posada and Francisco Goitia . Skeletal figure with mummy on display at the workshop He has also created murals and other artworks in barro negro, many of which use the brilliance of the medium to play with the light. Currently, much of his inspiration comes from other parts of Mexico. Carlomagno creates pieces for special orders. Some of these have included historical and cultural figures, which have been exhibited in museums and galleries in Mexico and abroad and many are part of private collections. His work has been featured in locations such as the Mexican Fine Arts Center Museum in Chicago, the Galería de la Raza in San Francisco and the Laumeier Sculpture Park in Saint Louis, Missouri. Carlomagno’s work is always done completely by hand with the aim of not repeating a piece he had done before exactly. After modeling, the piece is left to dry completely then fired in an underground oven. This oven is completely sealed to limit the amount of oxygen inside and allows for the black color of the pieces. In 1990, during the Encuentro Nacional de Arte Joven in Aguascalientes, Carlomagno’s work caught the attention of painter Manuel Felguérez and art critic Teresa del Conde, who debated whether Carlomagno should be considered an artist or artisan. Oaxaca painter Francisco Toledo considers him to be an artist and has worked to get his pieces shown in Europe. ==Works and exhibitions== Carlomagno and sister Adelina demonstrating barro negro pottery to visitors at the family workshop in San Bartolo Coyotepec His first exhibition was in 1983 at the Capilla del Hotel Presidente in Oaxaca city in 1983. In 1985, his work was at the Taller de Artes Plásticas Rufino Tamayo Gallery, and two galleries in Mexico City. In 1988, his work appeared at the Encuentro Nacional de Arte Joven in Aguascalientes. In 1990, his work appeared at Galería de la Raza in San Francisco. In 1995, it appeared at the Mexican consulate in Hamburg, Germany. In 1996, a sculpture group called El mal de amores “ in an expositions called “Enfermo de qué”, related to the origin of disease, toured Europe. In 2002, it appeared at the Parc de la Villette in Paris and the Fine Arts Centre Museum in Chicago. In 2006, it appeared at the Texas Gallery in Houston and the Boston Arts Academy. In 2007, it appeared in the Gardiner Museum in Toronto. In 2008, it appeared at the Friends of Oaxaca Folk Art New York. In 2008, he created a large mural in barro negro at the Baseball Academy in San Bartolo Coyotepec, which was sponsored b the Alfredo Harp Helú Foundation. In 2010, it appeared at the Galerìa Arte Contemporàneo Noel Cayetano in Oaxaca. ==Recognition== His work has received recognitions such as First Place in Sculpture, Gran Premio de Arte Popular in Querétaro in 1986, Premio Nacional de la Juventud en Artes Populares in 1988. His work has been featured in five published catalogs. In 2014, Mexico awarded Martinez its National Prize for Arts and Sciences in the popular arts and traditions category. ==MEAPO== He is currently the director of the Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca (MEAPO) in his hometown, a museum dedicated to the handcrafts of the state of Oaxaca, especially those in the Central Valleys region. He was one of the main actors in the founding of this museum in its current form in the 2000s. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:1965 births Category:Mexican artists Category:People from Oaxaca Category:Living people Category:Mexican ceramists ","title":"Carlomagno Pedro Martínez"},{"id":"35219561","text":"Hot Fives & Sevens is a 2000 box set collection of recordings made by American jazz trumpeter and singer Louis Armstrong with his Hot Five, Hot Seven, and other groups between 1925 and 1930. First released on JSP Records on 22 August 2000, the set was subsequently reissued on Definitive in 2001. A four-disc compilation, the set has received a \\"crown\\" as an author's pick in The Penguin Guide to Jazz and is also included in the book's \\"core collection\\" recommended for jazz fans. Allmusic concurs that it is \\"beyond indispensable\\", suggesting that \\"you can't have a Louis Armstrong collection without this historic set\\" or \\"any kind of respectable jazz collection\\" Alternatively, Ben Ratliff, writing in 2002, preferred Columbia's release The Complete Hot Five and Hot Seven Recordings. == Overview == The box set consists of four compact discs. The first and second discs, and part of the third, comprise the Hot Five and Hot Seven recording sessions from 1925 through 1928. The third and fourth discs compile tracks recorded by Carroll Dickerson's Savoyagers, Louis Armstrong and His Orchestra, and Louis Armstrong and His Savoy Ballroom Five (with Earl Hines) between 1928 and 1930. ==Critical reception== The collection has generally earned praise. Music critic Cub Koda, writing for Allmusic, notes that \\"Although this material has been around the block several times before -- and continues to be available in packages greatly varying in transfer quality -- this is truly the way to go, and certainly the most deluxe packaging this material has ever received with the greatest sound retrieval yet employed.\\" The Penguin Guide to Jazz included Hot Fives & Sevens in its \\"Core Collection,\\" and assigned its \\"crown\\" accolade to the album, along with a four-star rating (of a possible four stars). (The first three discs from this set, JSP CD 312 – 314, individually received four-star ratings, and are also included in the Core Collection.) Penguin editors Richard Cook and Brian Morton remarked, \\"John R. T. Davies's remastering for JSP is superlative. Armstrong scholars argue over whether the Columbia 'definitive' edition – mystifyingly delayed – is superior, but it's hard to see anyone being disappointed with either.\\" 2008's Jazz : The Basics is not as effusive, suggesting that other remasters may sound better and other packaging may be more complete, but the lower price of this set made it \\"an attractive package for recordings that are a necessary part of any CD collection.\\" Ben Ratliff, by contrast, found the collection only a \\"tolerable alternative to Columbia's muffled-sounding initial CD reissue\\", but preferred Columbia Legacy's The Complete Hot Five and Hot Seven Recordings (C4K 63257) for its greater \\"bright and present\\" sound. ==Track listing== Except where otherwise noted, all songs composed by Louis Armstrong.

It belongs to the 'heath' family, Ericaceae. 'Heath' refers to open, shrub-like communities which survive on well-drained and poor quality soils. The word 'Cyathodes' is in reference to the flower, describing it as 'cup-shaped'. \\"Glauca' is derived from 'glaucous' which means blueish-grey or green, referring to the distinguishable, lighter colour on the underside of the leaves. ==Description== Leaves: Dark green, linear and pointed 2–4 cm long. They have parallel venation and form false whorls, particularly towards the end of the stem. Undersides are distinctively glaucous. Flowers: numerous, mostly terminal flowers, solitary in axils of final whorl. Slightly scented, they are small (1 cm), white and tubular with recurved lobes and protruding anthers. They flower in spring and early summer. Fruit: a distinctively pink/purple drupe, 1 cm in diameter. Shape is that of a partially flattened tennis ball. ==Distribution== Widespread and locally common understorey plant in open forest below 1100m (subalpine). It is found almost only in Tasmania, Australia, with outlying occurrences in central-east New South Wales and far southwest South Australia. It inhabits mostly subalpine, sclerophyll woodland or wet sclerophyll forest. ==Ecology== Common dominant species that Cyathodes glauca occurs with are Leptospermum scoparium, Pultenaea daphnoides, Monotoca glauca and Acacia species. Cyathodes glauca prefers moist, well-drained/poor quality soil. As a result, it is often found on rocky slopes and boulder fields where clay soils overlay dolerite. Slopes are typically of a southeast aspect with gentle to moderate gradient and good drainage. ==Affinities== There are three other known species within the genus Cyathodes. Cyathodes platystoma (a threatened species), has the largest leaves and is only found in wet sclerophyll forests of the Tasman Peninsula. Cyathodes straminea looks very similar to C. glauca although has smaller leaves, dark red drupes and is only found above 1100m. Other recognisable members of the family Ericaceae include blueberries, cranberries and rhododendrons. ==References== Category:Styphelioideae Category:Flora of Tasmania Category:Trees of Australia Category:Taxa named by Jacques Labillardière ","title":"Cyathodes glauca"},{"id":"35219754","text":"The Redoubt St. Archangel Michael Site, also known as the Old Sitka Site and now in Old Sitka State Historical Park, is a National Historic Landmark near Sitka, Alaska.

It was the first non-Native settlement on Baranof Island. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1962, and was made a state park in 1966. ==History== In 1779, Alexander Baranov, a leader of the Russian-American Company, arrived near the site of modern Sitka, and negotiated with the local Tlingit people for a site on which the company could establish an outpost. Although he would have preferred what is now called Castle Hill in Sitka, he was granted this site on Starrigavan Bay. It was not until 1799 that the company established a presence, building a number of log buildings, surrounded by a palisade. In 1802 the Tlingit attacked and destroyed the premises.

The leaves are oblong, approximately in length, with yellow undersides. The flowers are hermaphroditic; white with 3 sepals. The edible fruit is yellow and ovoid, in diameter, containing one seed (or occasionally two). ==Uses== The fruit of the M. huberi is similar to the sapodilla and is edible, with excellent flavor popular for use in desserts. M. huberi produces an edible latex that can be harvested in a manner similar to the harvesting of the latex of the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). The latex dries to an inelastic rubber, which is considered inferior to gutta-percha. The latex from M. huberi is sometimes used to make golf ball covers. It is considered a good, but short-lived, cover, requiring frequent recoating, yet it is popular in tournaments. The tree is also used for lumber in Puerto Rico. The wood is red and very hard, and is popular for use in furniture making, construction, and railway ties. The wood is so dense to the point that it does not float on water, and requires pre-drilling before nailing.

In 2011–12, his senior year at Oakland University, Hamilton averaged 26.2 points per game to lead all of NCAA Division I in scoring. He scored 2,188 points between his time spent at UMKC and Oakland. ==Early life== Hamilton was born in Harvey, Illinois to Calvin Hamilton and Deborah Horne. He attended Thornwood High School where he was a three-year varsity letter winner. Twice he was named an All-SICA East Conference and all-region honoree, and in his senior season he averaged 17.7 points, 6.0 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 4.0 steals per game en route to a 23–7 overall record. During his college recruitment process, Hamilton eventually decided to accept a scholarship to the University of Missouri–Kansas City (UMKC) to play for the Kangaroos. ==College career== UMKC Hamilton enrolled at UMKC in 2007 and made an immediate impact for the Kangaroos. In his freshman season he averaged 11.7 points, 3.3 assists and 3.2 rebounds per game. UMKC finished 14–22 but he was named to the Summit League All-Newcomer Team and was the only true freshman to receive that honor. He finished third on the team in scoring and surpassed the 20-point threshold on three occasions. On November 11, 2007, in his collegiate debut at Kansas (who would later go on to win the 2008 national championship), Hamilton scored 16 points and recorded six assists in a loss. At the season's end, UMKC presented him with the Jim and Sally Job Award, given annually to the school's promising student-athlete. The following season, his sophomore campaign in 2008–09, his 12.6 points per game was second on the team and surpassed 20 points five times. He played in 21 games, started in 15 of them, and scored 265 points. Despite personal success, Hamilton asked for a release from the team following the game against Centenary on January 24, 2009. He was granted the release, and thus in his final game as a Kangaroo he registered 13 points, five rebounds and four steals. Oakland Due to NCAA eligibility rules regarding transferring schools, Hamilton was forced to sit out the 2009–10 season in his first year as a Golden Grizzly. The following year, his first as an eligible player for Oakland, he scored 17.6 points per game, made 82 three- point field goals, and was named to the All-Summit League First Team. Two of the more notable games for him on the season include the January 29, 2011 contest against Centenary in which Hamilton scored his 1,000th career point, and on February 24 in a game against his former school UMKC, Hamilton registered 28 points behind a 10-of-14 shooting performance. For the second consecutive season, Oakland won both the regular season and conference tournament championships en route to earning a berth into the 2011 NCAA Tournament. They were designated a #13 seed and played #4 Texas in the round of 64. Oakland lost the game 85–81 to end their season. During the regular season, Oakland set a Summit League men's basketball record for consecutive conference wins with 20. Prior to the 2011–12 season, Hamilton was named a co- captain by his coaching staff and was also tabbed the fourth best college point guard according to Lindy's Magazine. Among other preseason honors, he was also named the 96th best player in all of college basketball. Hamilton lived up to the billing as he guided the Golden Grizzlies to a berth in the 2012 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament (CIT) after finishing the regular season 17–15 (11–7 in conference play), which placed them third in The Summit League regular season standings. Hamilton was named the Summit League Male Athlete of the Month for February 2012 after averaging 30.7 points per game throughout the month and in the process broke the conference's single- season scoring record. On the year, Hamilton scored 942 points; 39 of those came in the first-round game of the CIT in which he registered a tournament- record against Toledo. In his final collegiate game, a 105–81 loss to Utah State in the CIT Final Four, Hamilton scored 26 points. The Golden Grizzlies finished the year with a 20–16 overall record and set a new Summit League record with three postseason wins during its run to the CIT Final Four.

When the Colonial opened its doors, the era of the grand hotels was in full swing and Bethlehem was a premier destination resort town. Because of its sophisticated clientele the Colonial quickly became a venue for movie studios to test market their films. It was designed in the Egyptian Revival styleColonial Theatre Cinema Tour by Francis J. Kennard of Tampa, Florida.Colonial Theatre Cinema Treasures The Colonial Theatre is located at 2050 Main Street and was built by Karl Abbott, scion of Bethlehem hotelier Frank Abbott. In the summer of 1914, as documented in K. Abbott's 1950 memoir Open for the Season, Abbott, with his then-partner \\"Doc\\" Clark, converted the family stables to a garage for automobiles, then looked further: \\"The vacant lot across the street at which I happened to be looking suddenly took on a vision — before my eyes rose a modern movie house with electrically lighted marquee.\\" By spring of the following year construction was complete and the Colonial Theatre opened for business on July 1, 1915, with a showing of Cecil B. DeMille's The Girl of the Golden West. The theatre included an electrically-lighted marquee. Building on his father's purchase of the Uplands Hotel in Bethlehem in 1886, Frank H. Abbott and Son became one of the pre- eminent owners and operators of grand hotels in the White Mountains, with holdings in Florida, North Carolina, New York state, and Boston as well. Locally, in addition to the Uplands, they owned the Forest Hills in Franconia, and one of the most successful resorts of its era, the Profile House in Franconia Notch. In 1922, overwhelmed with the operation of the Profile House, Karl sold the Colonial, still legally owned by Abbott and Clark, to Jack Eames, a local resident who was president of the Interstate Amusement Company. The transaction was negotiated on an impulse when they happened to meet on the night train to Boston. The theater remained with the Eames until it was purchased by the nonprofit The Friends of the Colonial in 2001. Currently the Colonial presents national touring artists, independent and world cinema, children's events, and community events from May 1 through October 30. ==References * Colonial Theatre website Category:Buildings and structures in Grafton County, New Hampshire Category:Theatres in New Hampshire Category:New Hampshire State Register of Historic Places Category:Bethlehem, New Hampshire ","title":"Colonial Theatre (Bethlehem, New Hampshire)"},{"id":"35220126","text":"Michoacán Nahuatl is the name given to a variety of Nahuatl language spoken by the Nahua Michoacan on the Pacific Coast of Mexico in Michoacán.

A defender, tall and weighing , Bugg was capable of playing on both the half-back line and as a midfielder. He entered top level football early when he joined the Gippsland Power in the TAC Cup as a bottom-aged player. In addition to representing Victoria in both the under 16 and under 18 championships. His performances as a junior, saw him be one of twelve players who signed with the Greater Western Sydney Giants as an underage recruit in 2010. He made his AFL debut in the 2012 season and earned a Rising Star nomination. After spending four seasons with Greater Western Sydney, playing sixty-five matches, he was traded to the Melbourne Football Club during the 2015 trade period. During his time in the AFL, he earned the reputation as being \\"one of the best nigglers in the competition\\". Prior to the beginning of the 2019 premiership season, he informed the Carlton Football Club of his decision to step away from AFL football, effective immediately. ==Early life== Bugg was born to Jim and Kerry Bugg (née Ramage) in Melbourne, Victoria; and played his junior football career with the Gembrook-Cockatoo Junior Football Club and Beaconsfield Football Club before joining the Gippsland Power in the TAC Cup as a bottom-aged player in 2010 where he played eight matches and kicked two goals, including the grand final loss against the Calder Cannons. He received state honours in 2009 when he played for Vic Country in the under 16 championships, and received a scholarship within the prestigious AIS/AFL Academy as part of their 2009 intake. He was again selected for Vic Country in 2010, this time in the AFL Under 18 Championships and played his best game for the series against NSW/ACT, where he was named in the best players. In October 2010, he signed a three-year contract with the Greater Western Sydney Giants (GWS) as an underage recruit, which was a special recruitment process allowed by the AFL Commission where GWS could sign twelve players born between January and April 1993. As GWS wouldn't compete in the Australian Football League (AFL) until 2012, he moved to Melbourne in 2011 to complete year twelve at Caulfield Grammar School as a boarder. ==AFL career== 2012-2015: Early career at Greater Western Sydney Bugg playing for GWS in August 2015. Bugg made his AFL debut in 's first ever match — which was in the opening round of the 2012 season against at ANZ Stadium — where he recorded twenty-seven disposals, five marks and four tackles. In his fifth match, he received the round five nomination for the Rising Star after the forty-two point loss against the at Manuka Oval where he recorded twenty-eight disposals, seven marks, and six rebound-50s; playing as both a defender and midfielder in the match, he was rewarded for his ability to man-up on Shaun Higgins, Justin Sherman and Nathan Djerrkura. In June, he signed a contract extension until the end of the 2015 season. The season saw him involved in numerous match review panel incidents, where the Western Bulldogs', Patrick Veszpremi missed a match for headbutting Bugg, and 's, David Zaharakis was reprimanded for striking Gugg, along with match-day incidents by Essendon's, Heath Hocking (headbutting) and 's, Bachar Houli (forceful front-on contact), which did not result in charges, and he was fined for being involved in a melee in the round thirteen match against . He played eighteen matches and kicked six goals in his debut season. Bugg played the opening six matches for the 2013 season before being omitted for the round seven match against at Škoda Stadium, he was recalled the next week for the eighty-three point loss against at Aurora Stadium before being dropped again the next week. He played the next two months in the reserves for the in the North East Australian Football League (NEAFL), before returning to the senior side for the 129-point loss against Sydney at the Sydney Cricket Ground in round sixteen and played the remainder of the season, apart from the final round match against at Metricon Stadium. He was praised during the year by former Melbourne captain, Garry Lyon, who noted Bugg \\"shows leadership quality beyond his years\\". After a strong pre- season in 2014 where he won the club three-kilometre time trial, Bugg played the first six matches of the season before he was omitted for the round seven match against at Manuka Oval. He returned to the senior side for the forty- five point win against at the Gabba in round thirteen where he was a late replacement for Aidan Corr. During the match, he was involved in a marking contest where his hip collided with Jonathan Brown's head, which subsequently forced Brown into retirement after receiving too many head knocks. After receiving the reputation of being \\"one of the best nigglers in the competition\\", he was involved an incident in round fifteen where he bumped Sydney captain, Kieren Jack, which drew condemnation from the public, in particular from Australian Football Hall of Fame member, Tony Shaw who described the bump as \\"pretty ordinary\\". He was involved in further incidents, which saw both 's, Maverick Weller and 's, Hayden Ballantyne suspended for striking him, and 's, Sam Gibson suspended for rough conduct. The opening round of the 2015 season saw Bugg play his 50th AFL match in which the club defeated St Kilda by nine points at Etihad Stadium. During the match, he collided with St Kilda captain, Nick Riewoldt, which saw Riewoldt sent to hospital for precautionary scans, the collision drew the ire of St Kilda coach, Alan Richardson who labelled it \\"poor\\", with the public and media pondering whether the act was deliberate. He was ultimately cleared by the match review panel where they deemed \\"Riewoldt stepped into Bugg's path and he was unable to avoid contact\\" and he later confirmed that the collision was unintentional. He played the first twelve matches for the season before he was omitted for the first match after the mid-season bye, the round fourteen clash against at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He returned to the senior side for the twenty-one point loss against at Adelaide Oval in round twenty and played the remainder of the season. In August, it was revealed that GWS were yet to offer him a contract and speculation grew that he would return to his home state of Victoria after several clubs expressed interest in him. After an up and down season and sixty-five matches for GWS in total, he was traded to the Melbourne Football Club in October. 2016–2018: Move to Melbourne Bugg at training in November 2015 After playing every match in the 2016 NAB Challenge and being named as one of the \\"eye-catching\\" players during the pre-season by AFL Media, Bugg made his debut for Melbourne in the opening round of the season against his old side, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in a two-point win. He drew negative attention during the 33-point win against at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the annual Anzac Day eve match for two separate incidents, the first where he pushed Jack Riewoldt when he was injured and Bugg received a $1000 fine from the match review panel for \\"making contact with an injured player\\". The second incident was his celebration after kicking his only goal for the match, where he put his finger to his mouth to silence the Richmond cheer squad with a wink, which drew displeasure from the commentators. He later apologised for both incidents. He played every match for the season until the round 16 match against at TIO Stadium, and played in the Victorian Football League (VFL) for Melbourne's affiliate team, the Casey Scorpions, before returning to the senior side for the 29-point win against at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in round 20 and played the remainder of the season in the seniors. He played eighteen matches in his first season for Melbourne and finished seventeenth in the best and fairest count. In 2017, during a game against the Sydney Swans, he struck Callum Mills in the face in the opening stages of the match. The incident happened four minutes into the game and behind play.

In operation from 2011 to 2014, it was owned and operated by Jonathan and Susan Austin. The Yancey County News was started in January 2011 by the husband and wife team; Jonathan Austin had 30 years of journalism experience and had dreamed of starting a newspaper in his father's adopted mountain town. The paper covered Yancey County, North Carolina, which had for years been served by a local paper that didn't rock the boat. Its paid circulation was between 1,000 and 1,300; the cost of a print copy was 50 cents,. Jonathan said that his intent with the newspaper was to bring \\"the attitude of well-funded reporting\\" to a small-town paper while also covering all local events. The paper covered government meetings, local sports, and also published nutrition and hunting columns. In two series of investigative reports beginning with its first issue and titled \\"Unlawful Law Enforcement\\", the newspaper reported criminal abuses of absentee balloting and vote fraud organized by staff at the sheriff's department. The paper also documented that county-owned firearms were being pawned by the chief deputy, who later resigned and pleaded guilty to dereliction of duty. The Yancey County News received two major American journalism awards for its work in 2011: the E.W. Scripps Award for Distinguished Service to the First Amendment and the 2012 Ancil Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism from the University of Oregon School of Journalism and Communication.

Selected by the Giants in November 2010, Cameron immediately made an impact in the early stages of the club's life-form, proving that he was set to be a future superstar forward by kicking 29 goals in his first season, and following that up by kicking 62 goals the next year and earning his first ever All-Australian Selection. Cameron's game was being likened to that of AFL Legends Matthew Lloyd and Jonathan Brown in only his second season. Since joining the league Cameron's accomplishments include, two All- Australian Team selections (2013,2019) and one Coleman Medal (2019). He has been the Giants's leading goal-kicker for 8 consecutive seasons. == Early life == Jeremy Cameron grew up in Dartmoor, a small town between Portland and Mt Gambier with a population of 150 people. Cameron began playing for the North Ballarat Rebels in TAC Cup Program in 2010, travelling over 250kms from home to Ballarat. ==AFL career==  Greater Western Sydney Giants   2012-2015: Early career and first All-Australian selection  Jeremy Cameron was selected as a 17-year-old underage recruit by the Greater Western Sydney Giants in November 2010, a year prior to their inaugural season in the AFL. Cameron made his AFL debut on March 24, 2012 in the GSW Giants first-ever AFL- Premiership-Season game in round 1 of the 2012 AFL Season, against Sydney. In round 2, Cameron kicked 4 goals against North Melbourne and was awarded the round 2 nomination for the 2012 AFL Rising Star , Cameron continued to show his promise when he kicked 5 goals against the Western Bulldogs in round 5, becoming the first ever GWS player to kick 5 goals in a game. Cameron finished his rookie season as the club's leading goal-kicker with 29 goals, from 16 games, averaging 1.8 goals a game. In the 2013 AFL Season, Cameron continued to show his potential in a young GWS side, his game was already being likened to that of AFL Legends Matthew Lloyd and Jonathan Brown in only his second season. He received a Goal of the Year nomination for an excellent goal he kicked against in Round 11, one of four he kicked for the match. In Round 18 against , Cameron kicked seven goals in the first three quarters.Magpies edge out Cameron's Giants, AFL.com.au, 27 July 2013 He finished the season by averaging 3.0 goals a game and ranked third in the Coleman Medal tally with 62 goals for the season, 6 goals behind winner, Jarryd Roughead.Jeremy Cameron Named In All Australian Team, GWSGIANTS.com.au, 16 September 2013 Cameron's excellent season resulted in him being named full-forward in the 2013 All- Australian team. He was the first Giants player to ever be named an All- Australian. In the 2014 AFL Season, Cameron continued to show signs of being one the most promising Centre Half Forwards in the game, for his age. He continued to show improvement, kicking his 100th AFL goal against the Western Bulldogs in round 4, one of three that he kicked during the game. Unfortunately for Cameron, injuries prevented him from replicating his previous dominate season. A perforated eardrum proved a hindrance, but repeated ankle problems were the real issue, limiting him to 14 games. He still topped the GWS goal-kicking for a third consecutive season with 29 goals on an avg of 2.1 goals a game. Cameron played his 50th AFL game against in round 17, recording 2 goals in a 76-point loss.Jezza, You Beauty, GWS Giants official website, 11 July 2014 In the 2015 AFL Season, Cameron returned to his previous career-best form, playing in every single game of the AFL home-and- away season. He kicked the season off by booting 4 goals in GWS's round 1 clash with St Kilda, following that up by kicking another 4 goals in a round 4 victory against the Gold Coast Suns. Cameron would then kick a mammoth 7 goals in round 6, as the Giants defeated two-time reigning premiers by 10 points. Cameron was again, proving himself to be not only the team's most lethal forward, but one of the most lethal forwards in the competition, finishing the season as the runner-up for the Coleman Medal with 63 goals, one more than his 2013 All-Australian Season. Cameron was named in the initial 2015 40-man All- Australian Squad, but missed out on making the final team. Cameron's tag as the GIANTS' 'franchise player' was consolidated when he signed a contract extension before the 2015 season that will keep him at the club until at least the end of the 2020 season.  2016-2019: Individual success and consecutive finals appearances  Cameron received his first-ever suspension after a high hit on Brisbane player Rhys Mathieson during the 2016 NAB Challenge, resulting in Cameron being suspended for the first four games of the 2016 AFL Season. Cameron returned from suspension in round 5, recording 5 goals against St Kilda, he continued this form throughout the season, kicking four or more goals on six occasions. He would play in every remaining game of the home- and-away season following his round 5 return, finishing the season as GWS's leading goal-kicker for the 5th consecutive year with 53 goals, third place in the Coleman Medal. Cameron played a huge role in helping GWS reach their first ever final's series, finishing the season with a 16-6 win-loss record, resulting in them finishing 4th on the ladder. Cameron kicked 4 goals in the Giants first ever final, helping them defeat Sydney by 36 points in a qualifying final. Cameron took leaps towards improving his game during the 2017 AFL Season by turning himself into a free-wheeling forward, giving himself the freedom to roam all over the ground, resulting in him increasing his disposal average from 9.5 to 15.8, his average marks a game from 4.3 to 7.1, and his average kicks a game from 7.2 to 10.9. Cameron started the season in tremendous form, recording 13 goals in the first three games, 4 in round 1 against the Adelaide Crows, 6 in round 2 against the Gold Coast Suns, and 3 in round 3 against North Melbourne. Cameron was on track to having a career-best haul when he had 39 goals after round 14, but hamstring issues cut his impact significantly. Cameron missed four of the last seven games of the regular season, resulting in him finishing the season with 45 goals. Cameron's impact again helped the Giants have a successful season, finishing 4th placed again with a win-loss record of 14-2-6. Cameron played in the first qualifying final against the Adelaide Crows, but again went down with a hamstring injury and was ruled out for the remainder of the finals series. Cameron started the 2018 AFL Season almost identical to his previous season with 12 goals in the first three rounds, and 35 goals after round 14, but again his season was derailed, only this time it wasn't due to an injury. Cameron was suspended for five games due to a hit on Brisbane player Harris Andrews that resulted in bleeding on the brain and a severe concussion for Andrews. He returned in round 20, but only kicked 11 goals in his next six games, including only 3 goals during the Giants two finals games. Cameron ended his season with 46 goals.  2019-Present: Grand final appearance and Coleman Medal  Cameron had a tremendous 2019 AFL Season, breaking all new career-highs for goals per game (3.3), kicks per game (11.7), marks per game (6.5), and disposals per game (16.2) along with recording a career-high 67 goals, 372 disposals, 150 marks, and 269 kicks. Cameron played the most home-and-away games he has played since 2016 (20), only missing two games. In the final round of the home-and away season, round 23, Cameron was behind in the Coleman Medal tally by 6 goals, sitting at 58 while leader Ben Brown was at 64, but Cameron was able to boot a career-high 9 goals against the Gold Coast Suns to end his season with 67 goals and capture his first Coleman Medal, also becoming the first-ever GWS player to win the award, Cameron was also selected into his second All-Australian Team as full-forward. Topping off a tremendous individual season for Cameron, the Giants made the finals for the fourth consecutive year, finishing 6th on the ladder. Cameron carried his strong form into finals, booting 2 goals in an elimination final victory over the Western Bulldogs and 3 goals the following week in a semi-final victory over the Brisbane Lions. Cameron continued to be a force for the Giants when he kicked another 3 goals against Collingwood in a preliminary final, helping GWS reach their first-ever Grand Final in club history. Cameron kicked the first (and his only) goal of the 2019 AFL Grand Final in a disappointing 89-point loss to Richmond. During the 2020 Season, it was revealed that Cameron was the most highly paid player in the AFL contracted with a back-ended deal for roughly $1.5 million for 2020 (which was later reduced to $1.1 million per year due to the COVID-19 pandemic). ==Personal life== Cameron grew up supporting Collingwood.Jeremy Cameron grew up barracking for Collingwood, now he looks forward to beating them, Herald Sun, 25 July 2013 ==Statistics== : Statistics are correct the end of the Preliminary final, 2019 - eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2012 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  18  16  29  15  115  45  160  80  28  1.8  0.9  7.2  2.8  10.0  5.0  1.8 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2013 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  18  21  62  27  170  54  224  160  27  3.0  1.3  8.1  2.6  10.7  5.0  1.3 - eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2014 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  18  14  29  21  105  28  133  60  18  2.1  1.5  7.5  2.0  9.5  4.3  1.3 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2015 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  18  22  63  37  185  50  235  122  37  2.7  1.7  8.5  2.3  10.5  5.3  1.8 - eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2016 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  18  20  53  25  143  82  225  72  39  2.7  1.3  7.2  2.0  9.5  4.3  1.3 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2017 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  18  19  45  25  207  94  301  134  39  2.4  1.3  10.9  4.9  15.8  7.1  2.1 - eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2018 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  18  18  46  32  202  72  274  111  24  2.6  1.8  11.2  4.0  15.2  6.2  1.3 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2019 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  18  23  75  49  269  103  372  150  32  3.3  2.1  11.7  4.5  16.2  6.5  1.4 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 153 ! 402 ! 231 ! 1396 ! 528 ! 1924 ! 835 ! 244 ! 2.6 ! 1.5 ! 9.1 ! 3.5 ! 12.6 ! 5.5 ! 1.6 } ==ReferencesCategory:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Greater Western Sydney Giants players Category:Greater Western Victoria Rebels players Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:All- Australians (AFL) Category:Kevin Sheedy Medal winners Category:Coleman Medal winners ","title":"Jeremy Cameron"},{"id":"35220449","text":"Devon Smith (born 20 May 1993) is a professional Australian rules footballer playing for the Essendon Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL).

The victims, all Chinese immigrants, were an elderly couple, two of their adult children, and their daughter-in-law. In Chinese-language media both in the United States and overseas, which devoted the most coverage to the killings, the case was usually referred to as the Lei family quintuple slayings. Police initially believed the case to be a murder- suicide, but two days later arrested 35-year-old San Francisco resident Binh Thai Luc, a friend of one of the victims, and charged him with five counts of murder, five counts of robbery, and two counts of burglary. At his arraignment on April 5, 2012, Luc pleaded not guilty to the charges. After years of delays in preliminary hearings as prosecutors requested additional time to review evidence, Luc's trial finally began on October 10, 2017. Following a seven- week trial and a week of deliberation, on December 11 the jury found Luc guilty of all the murder and burglary charges. Luc was subsequently sentenced to five consecutive life terms and began serving his sentence at San Quentin State Prison in March 2018. Luc's arrest and conviction led to political controversy over deportation from the United States, in particular the Supreme Court ruling in Zadvydas v. Davis that existing statutes did not authorize long-term post-prison detention of criminals whose deportations could not be carried out. Luc, a native of Vietnam who immigrated to the U.S. legally in 1989 as a child, was ordered deported after a 1998 conviction for armed robbery, but was released in the U.S. after completing his sentence because Vietnam's repatriation agreement with the U.S. explicitly excludes people who arrived in the U.S. before 1995. Republican politicians suggested amending the law to permit longer-term detention of deportable criminals and to deny visas to citizens of countries which failed to issue a travel document to any person ordered deported from the United States, and in 2017, the Vietnamese and U.S. governments formed a working group to discuss deportation issues. ==Killings== Discovery At approximately 7:45 am PST on March 23, 2012, three people were found dead inside a row house with the address of 16 Howth Street, located in the Ingleside district of San Francisco, near City College of San Francisco. The bodies were discovered by a daughter and granddaughter of the elder slain couple. Police arrived and found two more bodies in the house's backyard. A neighbor said that she heard a \\"loud male person angry or yelling at around midnight\\" the night prior to the morning the bodies were found, but did not hear any gunshots. The five victims were all Chinese immigrants and were related to each other; among the dead was 37-year-old Yingxue \\"Jess\\" Lei, the owner of the house. Investigators said that the victims suffered from blunt trauma, and ruled out gunshot wounds as the cause of death. Police also believed an \\"edged weapon\\" was involved in the slayings, although they never located the weapon that was used. News reports speculated that the killings were motivated by an attempt to collect on gambling debts; investigators declined to comment on that theory. Arrest Following the homicides, police carried out intensive investigations involving more than forty officers, and executed search warrants in San Francisco and in neighboring San Mateo County to locate the suspect. On Sunday, March 25, 2012, the San Francisco Police Department announced that they had arrested 35-year-old Binh Thai Luc, a San Francisco man, and charged him with five counts of murder in connection with the five bodies found in the home. Luc has an extensive criminal record, and his younger brother, 32-year-old Brian Luc, also a San Francisco resident, was arrested the same day as his brother on unrelated charges of drugs and ammunition possession and violation of probation. Binh Thai Luc is reported to have known all five of the victims, and had been a frequent guest at their house. Police stated that both Luc brothers were affiliated with a Vietnamese street gang. At the time, Binh Thai Luc was employed as a plumber. Victims The five victims, all Chinese immigrants, were related to each other: *Hua Shun Lei, 65 (雷華舜; husband), a native of Taishan, Guangdong, was previously a mathematics teacher in China. After moving to the US, he worked at the R&G; Lounge in Chinatown for 18 years, first as a kitchen assistant and later as a cook. His specialty was sliced roast duck. *Wan Yi Xu, 62 (許婉儀; wife), was a cashier at Target. *Vincent Lei, 32 (雷元驥; son), was an architect. *Chia Huei \\"Chantel\\" Chu, 30 (朱嘉慧; daughter- in-law), a student at the nearby City College of San Francisco, was from Taiwan. *Yingxue \\"Jess\\" Lei, 37 (雷映雪; daughter), was a software engineer for Quantitative Medical Systems, Inc., in the East Bay city of Emeryville ==Pre- trial court appearances== Legal representation In his first court appearance, Luc, who is of Chinese descent, requested a Cantonese court interpreter, but also spoke to the judge in English, and asked to be represented by the public defender's office. At the San Francisco County Superior Court on March 29, 2012 before Judge Lucy McCabe, Chief Assistant District Attorney Sharon Woo argued that there existed a potential conflict of interest if Luc were represented by the public defender's office, as the office had previously represented Luc's brother Brian Luc, who was a potential witness. Public Defender Jeff Adachi argued that this was not relevant as his office no longer represented Brian Luc, but McCabe sided with Woo, and so Binh Thai Luc's defense was handed over to private attorney Mark Goldrosen. Separately, the public defender's office filed an appeal from McCabe's decision not to permit it to represent Luc. The matter came before Judge Newton Lam, who on April 10 denied the appeal. Possibility of death penalty District Attorney George Gascón stated in late March 2012 that he probably would not seek the death penalty, though Luc might be eligible due to special circumstance enhancements. A poll conducted by CBS affiliate KPIX-TV around the same time found that 56% of San Francisco residents thought the government should pursue the death penalty in its case against Luc, while 33% were opposed and 11% unsure. When interviewed again on the matter in late April 2012, Gascón stated that the special circumstances committee (composed of senior homicide prosecutors) was still awaiting sufficient evidence before making the final decision. During Luc's court appearance on June 19, 2015, Assistant District Attorney Michael Swart stated that the prosecution would not be seeking the death penalty. The maximum sentence Luc faced for each count was thus life imprisonment. Arraignment and hearings Luc was arraigned on five counts of murder with special circumstances of multiple murders and lying in wait, five counts of robbery, and one count of burglary before Judge Samuel Feng of the San Francisco County Superior Court on April 5, 2012. He pleaded not guilty to all charges, but otherwise did not speak. His bail was set at $25 million, and his next court appearance was set for May 3 at which time a hearing date would be decided. Feng stated that he was \\"not comfortable\\" with granting bail, but Sharon Woo of the District Attorney's Office responded that because the investigation was still in its early stages, the prosecution was not yet prepared to offer sufficient evidence to meet the standard of \\"likely guilt\\" required to deny bail. Additionally, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) placed an immigration detainer on Luc, such that even if he were to make bail, he would be released into ICE custody rather than being freed. In late June 2012, Luc's brother was sentenced on unrelated drug charges. Luc appeared in court again on July 20, 2012. He continued to be represented by Mark Goldrosen. Feng announced that Luc's trial would be held on October 25, and then adjourned the hearing. Goldrosen explained the delay by stating that the investigation was still ongoing and that both the prosecution and the defense needed time to review witness statements and evidence. He also stated that his Luc was in good health and had received a visit from his parents. By January 2013, Luc's case had still not gone to trial. A pre-trial hearing held before Judge Jerome Benson on January 15 resulted only in another court date being set for March 19, nearly a year after the date of the deaths, because a police report was not yet complete. At the hearing on March 19, Judge Benson had been expected to set a date for a preliminary hearing, but instead defense lawyers again stated that they needed more time to review evidence, and so the hearing was set to continue on May 3. In Luc's court appearance on May 30, the preliminary hearing was again delayed until July 30. By December 2013, the preliminary hearing still had not been held; in Luc's court appearance that month, the judge set the new date for the preliminary hearing to February 14, 2014. Afterwards, the date was further pushed back to April 11, June 18, and then July 17. On July 17, Luc did not appear in court due to illness; the court set dates of October 16 for the status conference and November 17 for the preliminary hearing. The preliminary hearing finally began on March 16, 2015, and concluded in June. ==Trial and sentencing== Luc's trial was initially scheduled to begin in March 2016, but prosecutors requested delays in order to have more time to review evidence. Luc's trial finally began on October 10, 2017, before Judge Carol Yaggy. In opening statements, prosecutor Eric Fleming of the District Attorney's Office emphasized physical evidence linking Luc to the crime scene, including Luc's fingerprint on a bottle of Windex found at the scene and the blood of the victims found in Luc's car and on a pair of jeans at Luc's home, and suggested that efforts to destroy evidence at the scene by disassembling the sinks in order to flood the house would have required plumbing experience to carry out. Mark Goldrosen's defense of Luc focused on the prosecution's failure to advance a plausible motive for the killings, and on leads which the police failed to follow due to their focus on Luc, such as a report by an informant that a Chinatown gang leader had ordered the killings and DNA samples which had not been tested. Goldrosen stated that while Luc was present at the scene, another person masterminded and carried out the killings. The prosecution presented DNA evidence in court on October 17, while a forensic examiner testified on October 24. In the fourth week of the trial, the six police officers who initially investigated the scene testified. Both direct examination and cross-examination focused on several thousand dollars of cash left at the scene. Closing arguments began on November 28, and continued for another day. Fleming suggested that Luc was motivated by money, noting that he had suffered losses while gambling at Artichoke Joe's Casino, while Goldrosen reiterated that the evidence \\"strongly suggests there was more than one person involved\\". Jury deliberation then began on Monday, December 5, after court holidays due to the long weekend for Thanksgiving. After five days of deliberation, the jury still had not reached a verdict, a fact which Goldrosen attributed to the complexity of the case. On December 11, the jury found Luc guilty of five counts of murder, five counts of attempted robbery, and two counts of burglary, but acquitted him on the charges of robbery. District Attorney Gascón expressed satisfaction with the verdict, stating that \\"we’re pleased we’re getting some accountability for the family and for the community\\", while Goldrosen stated that other individuals involved in the killings were still at large and that Luc \\"understands that this is the beginning of the process and there are appellate procedures\\". On March 1, 2018, Yaggy ordered that Luc serve five back-to-back life sentences, overriding an objection by Goldrosen who had requested concurrent sentences. Prosecutor David Merin, who took over the case from Fleming after Luc's sentencing, presented the victim impact statement on behalf of the victims' family member Nicole Lei, who stated that it was too painful for her to attend the sentencing. Luc did not speak during sentencing, except to state to his lawyer that he wished to appeal. He was admitted to San Quentin State Prison to begin serving his sentence on March 7, 2018. ==Deportation issues== Treaty and case law In 1998, Binh Thai Luc was convicted of second- degree robbery and assault with a firearm for holding up a Chinese restaurant and a clothing wholesaler in San Jose in 1996. He served eight years of an eleven-year prison sentence at San Quentin State Prison before being released early on August 10, 2006 into U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody and sent to the Eloy Detention Center in Arizona pending an appearance in immigration court. The following month, an immigration judge ordered that Luc be deported from the United States. In the end, Luc could not be deported because the government of Vietnam refused to issue a travel document to allow him to be re-admitted to that country. Luc moved from his native Vietnam to the U.S. as a legal immigrant in 1989. However, Vietnam did not have a repatriation agreement with the United States at all at the time of Luc's deportation proceedings, and even under the subsequently-signed 2008 U.S.–Vietnam repatriation agreement, Vietnam is only required to accept deportees who arrived in the U.S. after the 1995 resumption of relations. University of San Francisco law professor Bill Hing stated that this restriction exists because the Vietnamese government believes that Vietnamese who went to the U.S. before that date – primarily refugees from communism – are \\"products of the United States\\", and their criminal acts are not Vietnam's responsibility. Due to the 2001 Supreme Court ruling in Zadvydas v. Davis, Luc could not be detained indefinitely either, and was released from ICE custody after 180 days. Political responses Politicians responded to the news of Luc's arrest with calls for post-prison restrictions on criminals who could not be deported. San Francisco mayor Ed Lee requested that the federal government consider ways of preventing undeportable felons from moving back to the areas where they had committed their original crimes, while various Congressional Republicans called for the passage of legislation addressing the situation. Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX) and Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) wrote a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano on June 1, 2012 expressing concerns about Luc and other foreign nationals who had been ordered deported but continued to live freely in the United States due to Zadvydas v. Davis, and inquiring whether she would support legislation to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to authorize detention of deportees beyond six months. In June 2013, Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK) moved to the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 to authorize detention of deportees beyond six months when their countries of citizenship refused to readmit them, and gave a floor speech on June 20, 2013 in which he mentioned Luc's case several times as justification. A year later, Grassley, Inhofe, Jeff Sessions (R-AL), David Vitter (R-LA), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced the Keep Our Communities Safe Act () for similar purposes; Grassley's press release regarding the act also discussed the allegations against Luc. Subsequent press releases accompanying re- introduction of the Keep Our Communities Safe Act in 2015 () and 2019 () also discussed Luc's case, decrying what Grassley, Inhofe, and their co-sponsors described as the \\"catch and release loophole\\" created by Zadvydas, which had allowed Luc to remain free in the United States. Representative Ted Poe (R-TX) proposed broader measures: he gave floor speeches on March 27 and July 10, 2012 calling for the passage of the Deport Foreign Convicted Criminals Act () he had introduced on October 25, 2011, which provides for denial of immigrant and non-immigrant visas to nationals of countries which \\"refused or unreasonably delayed repatriation\\" of deportees; in each speech, he referred to Luc and stated that Vietnam and other countries \\"who fail to take back their lawfully deported criminals\\" should face consequences. He further brought up Luc's case in remarks to Napolitano on July 19 when she appeared before the House Committee on the Judiciary. After Vietnamese prime minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc's May 2017 visit to the White House to meet with U.S. president Donald Trump, the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi and the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs formed a working group and held discussions in July 2017 regarding Vietnamese in the United States to whom Vietnam had refused to issue travel documents for deportation due to the 2008 repatriation agreement. The deportation issue rose to prominence again following Luc's conviction, which came less than two weeks after the controversial acquittal of an undocumented immigrant in another San Francisco homicide case, the shooting of Kathryn Steinle. In response to the news of Luc's conviction, conservative commentators including Terence P. Jeffrey and Mark Krikorian wrote columns condemning the Zadvydas decision. ==See also== *List of 2012 murders in the United States *Crime in California ==NotesReferences== Category:2012 in California Category:2012 in San Francisco Category:2012 murders in the United States Category:Family murders Category:Crimes in San Francisco Category:Murder in the San Francisco Bay Area ","title":"2012 Ingleside, San Francisco homicide"},{"id":"35220497","text":":This is the article about the Kansas history advocate. For other people of similar names, see Elizabeth Johnson (disambiguation). Elizabeth A. Johnson was a prominent advocate of Kansas history.

At the time, it was considered to be the first place the United States flag was raised on the state of Kansas. Museum and monument at village site preserved by Johnson. When erected in 1901, the monument was tall; weather damage had reduced it to about by 2004. In that year, it was largely destroyed by a tornado, but in 2006 was restored to a height of about 15 feet, using original pieces.\\"Pawnee Museum will restore, rededicate Pike monument\\". The Courtland Journal. 2006-08-24. Retrieved via Google Newspapers 2013-11-03. In the 1870s, Johnson became interested in Zebulon Pike and the possibility that the events surrounding the raising of the U.S. flag occurred nearby. She discovered what was believed to be the site in 1875 and, after studying Pike's journals and investigating another reported Pawnee site in southern Nebraska, concluded that this was the village that Pike had visited. To protect the site from being plowed, she and her husband bought the land. In 1901, the Johnsons donated the site to the state of Kansas for historic preservation.Platoff, Anne M. \\"The Pike-Pawnee Flag Incident: Reexamining a Vexillogical Legend\\".

Retrieved 2010-10-26. Johnson's claim was supported by Elliott Coues, who had edited Pike's journal; with his endorsement, it was accepted by the Kansas State Historical Society. In 1901, Johnson donated the land to the state of Kansas, which built a granite monument commemorating Pike's symbolic triumph over Spain. At the dedication of the monument, several of the speakers drew parallels between the Pike episode and the recent American victory in the Spanish–American War. In 1906, a four-day festival was held to celebrate the centennial of the flag incident.Asher, Brendon Patrick (2009). \\"Kitkehahki Chipped Stone Technologies: A Comparative Study\\".

Subsequent research showed that Pike's expedition had not visited this village, but the Kitkehahki village now known as the Pike- Pawnee Village Site, located on the Republican River in Webster County in south-central Nebraska. The error was a fortunate one, however: it led to the preservation of the site in Kansas, whereas the Nebraska site had been degraded by years of cultivation. ==References== Category:People from Republic County, Kansas ","title":"Elizabeth A.

He previously played 28 matches over four seasons with the Greater Western Sydney Giants and 20 matches over four seasons at . He won an AFL premiership with Richmond in 2017 while also winning the VFL's J. J. Liston Trophy that season as the league's best and fairest player during matches played with Richmond's reserves side, before winning a VFL premiership with the same reserves side in 2019. ==Early life and junior football== Townsend was born to mother, Denise and father, Peter in Leeton, a small town outside Wagga Wagga in the Riverina region of country New South Wales. He played junior football in the area, with the local Leeton- Whitton Football Club in the Riverina Football League. He first took up the sport at age 13, after playing junior rugby union for a number of years with the Leeton Phantoms. He attended school at St Francis de Sales Regional College in Leeton. Townsend represented his state under the banner of NSW/ACT Rams at national carnivals at under 16 level. In 2010 he played with the GWS side competing in the TAC Cup for under 18 players in Victoria. Townsend was runner-up in the club's best and fairest count that season. He was also a strong performer when he represented the NSW/ACT Rams at the 2010 AFL Under 18 Championships. Ahead of the 2011 underage season, Townsend was selected to join the AFL/AIS Academy program. As part of the program he would train with an AFL club over the summer and travel with the Academy group on an overseas trip to Europe. He was the only NSW player to earn selection that year. He moved to Sydney in October 2010 and completed his schooling there through the end of 2011. ==AFL career== GWS Giants (2012-2015) Townsend was recruited to the GWS Giants through zoning concessions and signed his first contract while still in high school in 2010, opting out of a potential nomination in for the AFL draft in the process. He would go on to train and play for the club in matches prior to its introduction to the AFL in 2012. Townsend kicks the ball during a NEAFL match with the Giants in August 2015 Townsend made his AFL debut in round 1, 2012 in the Giants' inaugural match against at ANZ Stadium. He kicked his first career goal two weeks later, in round 3 against . He would play in eight of the club's first ten matches, missing only in round 6 and 8. In round 11 he went again un-selected at AFL level, and was restrained to NEAFL level until round 17. It was then that he played in the first of his final three matches of the season. Injuries were a heavy impediment to game time that season, with Townsend playing only two matches at reserves level in addition to his 11 at AFL level. He record a total of 88 disposals and 37 tackles in senior matches that year. He was awarded the Coaches award at the club's inaugural award presentation. At the end of the 2012 season Towsend signed another three-year contract with the Giants, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2015 season. Townsend played his first match of the 2013 AFL season in round 4, but was immediately omitted from the side the following week. He returned in round 6 for a further two weeks before being dropped for a second time. Townsend played in a further five matches that season including in round 14 where Townsend was involved in an incident with Lindsay Thomas that saw the player suspended for headbutting. His year was prematurely ended in early August when he underwent hip surgery. He had played eight matches at AFL level in 2013. 2014's first game for Townsend came in round 2, where he kicked a goal and recorded 10 disposals against at Etihad Stadium. He remained in the senior side for the next two round before being dropped following a five touch match in round 4. Townsend returned to senior football in round 10 and played in the next four consecutive matches. Another five disposal match would see him miss the next three matches though before he played his last match of the season in round 17. Despite playing in just eight matches he placed tenth at the club for total tackles that season. Townsend fell even further out of favour with Giants selectors in 2015, with a combination of form and a foot injury keeping him relegated to reserves football in the NEAFL for almost the entire season. He played just one match, in the final round of the year against at Etihad Stadium. He recorded a career high 22 disposals in the match, along with six tackles and four clearances. Richmond (2016-2019) In the AFL trade period in October 2015, Townsend was traded to Richmond in exchange for a fourth round draft selection. He faced a limited training program during his first pre-season as a result of a minor ankle injury. By late March Townsend had impressed Richmond selectors, who handed him a club debut in round 1 of the 2016 season. He played again the following week before being dropped from the club's round 3 side. Townsend returned to senior football in round 5, but only for one match. He played just once more that season, in round 14 when he recorded nine disposals against Brisbane. At season's end he had played a total of four senior matches. Townsend during the 2017 AFL Grand Final parade Townsend spent the vast majority of the 2017 season playing reserves grade football with Richmond's VFL side. He split his time between the midfield and forward-line at that level through mid-August, playing 15 games. He eventually played his first senior match of the season in round 22, when he replaced the injured Josh Caddy in a forward role. In what was ultimately a 104-point Tiger victory, Townsend contributed a match-high six goals. Not only was it a career best haul, it eclipsed his total four goals kicked across his previous 32 career AFL matches. It was at this time that Fox Footy commentator Dermott Brereton labelled Townsend possibly the toughest player in the league. The following week, in the final round of the home and away season, Townsend turned in another outstanding performance when he kicked five goals in Richmond's victory over St Kilda. His form guaranteed he would retain his spot into the finals series, despite Caddy returning to fitness and to the senior side. Townsend opened up Richmond's finals campaign with two goals on just three disposals, helping this side to a qualifying final victory over Geelong. He also added another goal in the preliminary final as Richmond won their way to a Grand Final match-up with minor premiers . Townsend went on to feature in Richmond's premiership winning team, kicking two goals in the 48-point win. In addition to his scoreboard impact he also played a key negating role on Adelaide rebounding defender Jake Lever. Townsend's five goals across three finals was level with Norm Smith Medalist Dustin Martin as the equal best of any Richmond player that series. By winning a premiership medal he became the first player from the inaugural GWS Giants team to do so. In addition to his AFL premiership, he also received the J. J. Liston Trophy as the VFL's best & fairest player in that league's home and away season. He finished the year having played five games at senior level and 15 matches with the reserves, kicking 16 and 14 goals respectively. He ranked number one at Richmond and second in the AFL for goals per game that year as well as fifth in the league for tackles inside 50 per game. After signing a one-year contract extension in the off-season, Townsend entered 2018 in a strong vein of form. He played pre- season matches against Essendon and North Melbourne in February and March before reprising his premiership winning mid-sized-forward role in round 1 of the AFL season. Townsend kicked an equal team-high four goals in that win and attracted significant praise for his defensive role on Carlton interceptor Liam Jones. AFL Media's Kane Cornes noted Townsend as a notable omission from his own Round 1 Team of the Week on the back of that performance. He added another haul of three goals in round 4 but after a run of five straight games at senior level, was omitted from the club's round 6 team to play . He returned after just one match out however, and played a further three matches at AFL level before being dropped again in round 10 in favour of genuine tall- forward Callum Moore. While playing at the lower level Townsend received a one-match suspension for striking midfielder and former Richmond teammate Andrew Moore in late June. Townsend earned an AFL recall in round 19, replacing the omitted Moore. Another strong performance as a defensive-forward followed, along with goals that week and in round 20 also. Despite that, he was dropped for a third time that season and returned to football in the VFL. While playing at that level and in the final match of the VFL home and away season Townsend suffered a severe ankle injury. The fractured fibula sustained in the incident came with an expected recovery period of at least two months and saw Townsend's season effectively ended at both VFL and AFL levels. He had played 10 senior matches and kicked 12 goals at AFL level in addition to seven matches and seven goals in the reserves competition. Townsend did not receive a contract extension offer from Richmond during the 2018 season and media reports in July suggested Townsend's future at the club would depend heavily on the free-agency decision of Richmond-linked former Gold Coast captain Tom Lynch. During an unsure trade period, Townsend received significant interest from other clubs including St Kilda, Sydney and Gold Coast but received no formal offers. He was delisted by Richmond at the end of that period, but with the understanding that he would be re-selected in the upcoming rookie draft if he failed to find a contract with another AFL club. Townsend appeared close to deals with both Sydney and his former club the GWS Giants in the weeks that followed, undergoing medical exams at each. No offer eventuated from either club however and Townsend was eventually re-selected by Richmond with the 32nd pick in the rookie draft. Townsend in round 1, 2018 Townsend spent the majority of the 2019 pre-season training period on the sidelines, continuing to deal with the continuing effects of his 2018 leg injury as well as other related lower leg complications. He returned to reserves-grade football in March, before edging close to AFL selection by being named as an emergency ahead of round 4's match against . Towsend continued to go unselected for AFL football through the end of May despite being again named as emergency in round 9. After recording 22 disposals, eight marks and seven inside-50s in a VFL match in early June, Townsend earned a recall to AFL football for his first match at the level since round 20, 2018. He managed only an equal career-low three disposals and went goalless in that match, immediately dropped backed to VFL level. At the lower level the following week, he produced a game-high five goals in a win over . Townsend remained with the club's minor-premiership-winning VFL side through to the start of their finals series, playing an important role in a come-from-behind qualifying final win over the reserves. He contributed in a VFL preliminary final a fortnight later, as Richmond's reserves won through to that league's grand final. He kicked a goal in the Richmond VFL side that defeated the following week, helping win the club's first reserves grade premiership since 1997. Townsend finished 2019 having played just one match at AFL level but was Richmond's equal-leading goalkicker in the reserves, with 21 goals across 18 games including that years' VFL premiership. At the end of the season, Townsend was delisted by Richmond after four seasons at the club which included 20 matches and a premiership at AFL level, as well as a league best and fairest and premiership at reserves level in the VFL. In the month that followed, Townsend began seeking AFL opportunities elsewhere including a possible return to the Giants, before touring the training facilities of in late November. Essendon (2020-present) Townsend signed with Essendon during the pre- season supplemental selection period on 4 December 2019. Rather than continuing in his Richmond role as a defensive forward, Townsend was informed upon signing of the club's intention to use him as an inside midfielder, a role which he had played extensively at reserves level and in the early part of his career at AFL level. ==Statistics== :Statistics are correct to the end of the 2019 season - - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\"  scope=\\"row\\"   2012 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  31  11  2  3  50  38  88  25  37  0.2  0.3  4.5  3.5  8.0  2.3  3.4 -  scope=\\"row\\"   2013 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  31  8  0  1  50  43  93  21  25  0.0  0.1  6.3  5.4  11.6  2.6  3.1 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\"  scope=\\"row\\"   2014 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  31  8  1  3  47  37  84  17  60  0.1  0.4  5.9  4.6  10.6  2.1  7.5 -  scope=\\"row\\"   2015 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  31  1  1  0  10  12  22  3  6  1.0  0.0  10.0  12.0  22.0  3.0  6.0 - style=\\"background- color: #EAEAEA\\"  scope=\\"row\\"   2016 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  21  4  0  0  25  30  55  17  19  0.0  0.0  6.3  7.5  13.8  4.3  4.8 -  scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2017 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  21  5  16  2  32  17  49  14  19  3.2  0.4  6.4  3.4  9.8  2.8  3.8 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\"  scope=\\"row\\"   2018 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  21  10  12  7  53  40  93  27  30  1.2  0.7  5.3  4.0  9.3  2.7  3.0 -  scope=\\"row\\"   2019 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  21  1  0  0  1  2  3  1  4  0.0  0.0  1.0  2.0  3.0  1.0  4.0 - - scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA; font-weight:bold; text- align: center; width:2em\\" class=\\"sortbottom\\"  colspan=3 Career  48  32  16  268  219  487  125  200  0.7  0.3  5.6  4.6  10.1  2.6  4.2 } ==Honours and achievements== Team * AFL premiership player (): 2017 * McClelland Trophy (): 2018 Individual * Inaugural GWS Giants AFL team: 2012 VFL *VFL premiership player: 2019 * J.

Founded in 1925, it consists of six residential buildings and one central administrative building, which also houses a bell and clock tower. In total there are 393 beds for 341 rooms: 243 single rooms, 27 double rooms, 56 studios, 10 two-room apartments and 5 three-room apartments. Common spaces include 15 shared kitchens, a laundry room, a TV room, and game room with billiards and ping-pong. The central building also contains a great hall, a small lounge, a classroom, and a music room with frescoes painted by Maurice Guy-Loë. The front of the administrative building has an exit gate and is often referred to as the 37 Boulevard Jourdan gate. ==History== The Fondation Deutsch de la Meurthe was established following World War I during a meeting between Émile Deutsch de la Meurthe, an industrialist and philanthropist, and Paul Appell, Rector of the University of Paris. An unprecedented housing crisis occurred in Paris in the 1920s, forcing many students to live in cramped and unsanitary conditions. Appell sought to provide better living conditions for students, and Deutsch de la Meurthe was interested in attaching his name to the philanthropic endeavor. A decree signed November 18, 1922 authorized the University of Paris to accept a donation from Émile Deutsch de la Meurthe and named the Fondation in honor of him and his wife, Louise. The first stone was laid on May 9, 1923 and construction finished in 1925. The buildings were designed by Lucien Bechmann in a style inspired by the architecture of Oxford. Each of the six residential buildings is named after famous scientists and chancellors of the French university: Paul Appell, Pierre and Marie Curie, Octave Gréard, Louis Liard, Louis Pasteur and Raymond Poincaré. ==The Fondation today== Plan Initially available to only French students, today the Fondation is largely international. In 1992, students of 53 nationalities lived there, with 44% of them being French. On May 18, 1998, the roofs of the buildings, the gardens, the paved terraces and the vestibule and the great hall of the central building were included in the French Supplementary Inventory of Historic Monuments. From 2005 to 2006, the Curie building underwent a renovation and now contains studios and apartments reserved for young researchers. The Pasteur building was the second to be renovated. The building reopened in August 2015 after a year of renovation and now contains 60 single rooms and 12 double rooms. To restore the original architecture, the 2,800 window tiles of the Pasteur building were replaced using a traditional sealant technique.

The work is based on the extensive notes of violinist and composer William Henley (1874-1957). Henley had in his youth studied with August Wilhelmj, and later became a professor of composition and principal of the violin at the Royal Academy in London. Having played violins from many manufacturers, Henley sought to compile a comprehensive list evaluating violin and bow makers. After Henley's death in 1957, dealer Cyril Woodcock (1897–1980) completed and published the work based on Henley's unfinished notes. The work was first published in five volumes in 1959 and 1960, and republished in a single volume in 1973. == Background == The book was the first to include a significant number of American craftsmen. Henley traveled extensively as a performer, primarily with his quartet. It was during his trips, including a supposed trip to America during the 1920s, that Henley gathered information for his book. Australian violin maker Alan Coggins and regular contributor to The Strad wrote an article in 2003 challenging the objectivity of Woodcock's editing, given, among other things, unsourced and possibly inflated descriptions of luthiers in the United States. Nonetheless, the dictionary, at the time of publishing, was among several during the decade that complemented a seminal earlier lexicon, The Violin and Lute Makers From the Middle Ages to the Present, by Willibald Leo von Lütgendorff (1856–1937), published in 1922. Others included one by a Belgian musicologist René Vannes (1888–1956), compiled two editions of a Dictionary (1951 & 1959). Also, Chicago violinist Joseph Roda (1894–1963) compiled a seminal book with detailed illustrations by Gladys Mickel Bell (1901–1992) about bows and bow makers (1959). German luthier Fridolin Hamma (1881–1969) from Stuttgart compiled a book about German-made violins (1948; 1961) and a similar book about Italian-made violins (1964). Czech author Karel Jalovec (born 1892) compiled a books about Italian violin makers (1957), Bohemian (including Moravian and Slovakian) violin makers (1959), German and Austrian violin makers (1967), and an Encyclopedia of violin makers (2 volumes; 1965). Dutch luthier Max Möller (1915–1985) from Amsterdam published a lexical work about the violin factories (North and South) (1955). John Dilworth, a Twickenham-based luthier, wrote a comprehensive reference, published in 2012, The Brompton's Book of Violin & Bow Makers, John Milnes, editor. == Selected editions == * Universal Dictionary of Violin and Bow Makers (5 Vols.)

Schmidt was investigated in 1950 and again in 1954 because of her membership in the Washington Cooperative Bookshop. The bookstore was accused several times of being Communist-leaning; however, it was not operated under the auspices of the Communist Party and did not profess to be, although the works of Marx, Engels and Lenin and publications like Soviet Russia Today were sold there. The store handled popular works as well as an extensive selection of books and periodicals on political topics; these latter were not limited to works by Communist-approved authors. The store's customers, many of whom joined just to get the discount on new books, included prominent Washingtonians like Louis Brandeis. Other members, such as geologist Ruth A. M.

Members of the Washington Bookshop who were federal employees were investigated by federal loyalty boards, while others were blacklisted as Communist suspects. Lawrence Hill (1912-1988), a 1934 graduate of Yale and later one of the founders of Hill & Wang, was the bookstore manager until he left in 1942 to join the sales force at Knopf. The chair of the bookstore's board, David Wahl, a Library of Congress employee (later with the Bureau of Economic Warfare and the OSS), was accused of being a Soviet spy, and a number of books have repeated this allegation. He was never formally charged, and the portions of his FBI file which have been made public are so heavily redacted that it is impossible to determine what the substance of the allegations was, although it is known that NSA code experts speculated that he was the Soviet agent who appears in the Venona intercepts under the codename \\"Pink.\\" John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr and Alexander Vassilliev in their 2009 book Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America positively identify him as \\"Pink\\", a Soviet intelligence agent recruited in the 1930s, arguing that the details of Pink's resume fit Wahl and no one else.Haynes, John Earl, et al., Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America (Yale Univ. Press, 2009), p. 207-209. Philip Keeney of the Library of Congress and Mrs. Nathan Gregory Silvermaster were among the other accused Soviet agents who had a connection with the bookshop. On May 16, 1941 staffers of the Dies Committee with a subpoena raided the bookshop and seized its membership list of 1200 names out of the hands of a woman manager who was attempting to leave with it.Folsom, Franklin. Days of Anger, Days of Hope: A Memoir of the League of American Writers 1937-1942 (Univ. Press of Colorado, 1994), p. 150. This list was used by the Dies Committee to produce a color coded chart showing the membership interlocks between the bookshop and other alleged Communist front groups in Washington. The Civil Service Commission later ruled that membership in the bookshop was insufficient grounds for firing a government employee.Caute, David.

It is the second largest river in Chiba Prefecture after the Tone River (). The upper reaches of the Obitsu meander through Kimitsu, the middle of the river runs more directly through Kisarazu, and the lower reaches form and estuary and a triangular delta in Sodegaura, an area known as the Banzu Tidal Flats. The Obitsu then turns briefly west back into Kisarazu to empty into Tokyo Bay. The tidal flats of the Obitsu host numerous species of birds and crustaceans. In 2012 an IUCN Red List endangered species crab, Uca lactea lactea, was discovered at the mouth of the river, and may be the northernmost habitat of the crab in Japan. The Koito River, similarly to the Obitsu, emerges from Mount Motokiyosumi, flows east across Bōsō Peninsula, and empties into Tokyo Bay. The two rivers are the longest in the western region of the peninsula. ==Kamegawa Dam== The Kamegawa Dam was built near the Kazusa-Kameyama Station on the JR East Kururi Line on the upper part of the Obitsu River in 1979.

While there is some evidence of large-scale settlement along the Obitsu in the Yayoi period (300 BC-250 AD), the entire eastern Bōsō area was again richly populated in the Kofun period (250-538). Edo period Inland water transportation to connect the agriculture-rich middle and upper regions of the Obitsu developed slowly and reached its zenith on the Obitsu River in the Edo period (1603-1868). The Tokugawa shogunate showed strong interest in products from Kazusa Province. The shogunate excavated and straightened the meandering middle part of the Obitsu River to develop new paddy fields for the cultivation of rice and renkon lotus root. Like the Yōrō River and the Koito River, small riverboats were used on the Obitsu. Rice, as the nengu tax tribute to the Tokugawa shogunate, passed from the former Kururi Region of Kimitsu to the port at Kisarazu, typically crossing a distance of . Charcoal, an essential product in the Edo capital, was produced in the central region of the Boso Peninsula, and was another essential trade product on the Obitsu. In the most prosperous period of the Obitsu River, there were 35 riverboats active in trade, and most were property of individual villages along middle and upper reaches of the river. The mouth of the Obitsu River became a lively trade center, as the Port of Kisarazu had exclusive rights to sea traffic between the western Bōsō Peninsula and the Edo capital.Port of Kisarazu Modern period The lower parts of the Obitsu River along Tokyo Bay were developed in the early 20th century to support growing industrial facilities along Tokyo Bay., and this area ultimately became an important part of the Keiyō Industrial Zone. Despite the large industrial development of the lower part of Obitsu River, the middle and upper ranges of the continue to be used extensively for rice and vegetable production. The Obitsu River in the area around the Nagasuka, Kisarazu has historically been used for large-scale renkon lotus root cultivation. The low, damps areas of the river have been developed into rice paddy fields and fields for the production of lotus root. The renkon of the area became popular in the Tokyo area at the end of the Edo period, and remain in cultivation today.木更津市歴史通り（8）ハス田 Additionally, the shallows at the Banzu Tidal Flats formed the largest area of nori seaweed cultivation in the Tokyo Bay region. ==Recreation== Reeds at Banzu Tidal Flats of the Obitsu River, Tokyo Bay Kimitsu *Lake Kameyama has developed tourist facilities.

Abdullah Pasha Appointed Pasha of the city of Elbasan. Between 1812 and 1813, Abdullah Pasha, in the capacity of Sanjakbey of Elbasan (roughly equivalent to \\"district governor\\"), engaged in the process of the hygienization of the city by cleaning the water and sewage canals that originated from inside Elbasan Castle and finally depositing them in the Shkumbin river. Due to his later political activity against the interests of the Sultan, he was declared a rebel of the Sublime Porte (the Sultan). According to August Boppee, French consul in Janina, Kapllan Pasha of Kruja and Abdullah Pasha of Elbasan (Taushani) acted together with Ali Pasha Tepelena to protect their territories against their common enemies.Napoleon and Ali Pasha, pp 105, Abduallah Pasha was also a member of the Ali Pashë Tepelena's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. Other members of the Council included Myftar and Veli Pasha (Ali's sons), Xheladin bej Ohri and a number of his trusted men like Hasan Dervishi, Halil Patrona, Omar Vrioni, Meço Bono, Ago Myhyrdari, Thanas Vaja, Veli Gega (murdered by Katsantonis), and Tahir Abazi. Due to his successful campaign in defending the city of Elbasan from the southern lords' advances, the people of Elbasan dedicated him a song: Abdullah Pasha ne yzgji, Lebrit gjeti ne Shkumbi, Abdullah Pasha nje syzi, mbyti Lebrit ne Shkumbi (Dokumentet Historike te Lef Nosit, Albanian State Archive, Fondi 32, Dossier 47, pages 10–35).

According to Prof. Staver Naçi, after the occupation of Tirana, Durres, and Kruja, the Pasha of Shkodra sent a letter to the paria (nobility) of the City of Elbasan asking them to surrender peacefully and to remove from power the allies of Ali Pasha Tepelena. Once the \\"paria\\" learned that Mustafa Pashe of Shkodra (Bushati), was on his way to invade Elbasan, they assembled and elected Mehmet Pasha Taushani (nephew of Abdullah Pashë Taushani from his father's side, and Abaz Pashë Dibra from mother's side) to lead the fight against the advancing troops. Isuf Bey Taushani and Ismail Bey Xheladin Beu (Taushani) Were among the signatories of the Declaration of Independence of the City of Elbasan on November 25, 1912. In a telegram sent to Ismail Bey Vlora, the signatories declared that \\"All the People of Elbasan, muslim and christian, in one voice, have accepted the Independence of Albania.\\" (“I gjithe populli i Elbasanit, myslimane dhe te krishtere, me nje ze kane pranuar Indipendencen e Shqiperise”). Abaz Bey Taushani An Albanian army officer executed (together with Kamber Benja and Bexhet Manastiri) by the Austrian army after protesting against the removal of Albanian archeological objects from Apolonia, near Fier by the Austrian army. The protest note formulated by Abaz Bey, which was handed over to the Austrian authorities, stated the following: We protest against the removal of all archeological objects without the permission of the Albanian authorities. Although we believe that you have come to Albania as our allies, your hurriedness and escorted removal of all marble busts, golden and bronx rings, and all the painted ceramics with mythological figures that are part of our national history, is unfair and unacceptable. You may not remove the stone chest located within the turkish gymnasium in Berat because in reality, that chest is a crematorium that holds invaluable notes on the history and origin of ancient Illyrian towns. After their removal, only some the objects managed to reach Austria where they remain exhibited to this day. For their courageous act, the Albanian Monarchy and later, Socialist Albania, proclaimed the fallen officers \\"Deshmore te Monumenteve\\" (Martyrs of the Monuments). In the framework of the 100th anniversary of the declaration of independence and creation of the Albanian Armed Forces, the Ministry of Defense in cooperation with the Academy of Sciences of Albania, declared September 29 as the \\"National Day of Cultural Heritage\\" in honor of the three fallen heroes. They were also decorated with the highest military medal for Albanian officers for their extraordinary efforts in preserving the cultural riches of the country. The Albanian movie Dëshmoret e Monumenteve (see Albanian 1980s movies) is also based upon this event. Abaz Bey was also a leading officer in the Albanian volunteer forces () fighting the Greek invasion of the city of Korca and the surrounding areas. Abaz Bey also led the Albanian forces entering the city of Lushnjë. According to the memoirs of Ahment Shehu, as soon as Abaz entered the city, he immediately replaced the Esadist flag with the national Albanian flag. See Si e perballoi Lushnja pushtimin Austro-Hungarez ne vitet 1916-1918 Zyber Bey Taushani (the Vlora branch of the family) Described in the Memoirs of Eqrem Bey Vlora: \\"Zyber Bey Taushani (of the well known aristocratic family from Elbasan)...was a true knight who knew no fear, a true caballero, dressed in the picturesque Albanian national costume... Ismail Bey Taushani (Halla) Members of this family were also part of the nobility of the city of Vlora. In 1764, Ismail Pashe Velibishti, vezir of Vlora and Berat, was declared a rebel by the Sultan and a ferman was issued for his death. The vezir rebelled against the Sultan. He found support among some of the nobility of the city of Vlora (headed by Ismail Bey Taushani/Halla, who had married the vezir's aunt). He also found support from his brothers' in law, Kurt Pasha of Berat and Suleiman Pasha of Elbasan, who provided troops to the rebellion. The rebellion was crushed by the pro-Turkish forces. Ismail Pashe Velibishti was killed inside his uncle's house (Ismail Bey Taushani) and his head was sent to the Sultan.

The killings, which were reported by the media as the work of a \\"axe- murdering marijuana addict\\", were used as prima facie evidence that there was a link between recreational drugs, such as cannabis, and crime. This led to the killings being used in 1930s anti-drug campaigns against marijuana. Modern researchers have found that marijuana was never mentioned in any of Licata's psychiatric reports or considered a factor in the killings. Instead it was established that the young man had been identified as mentally ill and there had been steps to incarcerate him before the murders. Two weeks after the murder of his family, 21-year-old Licata was declared unfit to stand trial for reasons of insanity and committed to the Florida State Hospital for the Insane. He escaped, was later recaptured and hung himself in prison in 1950. ==Murders== On October 16, 1933, 21-year-old Victor Licata used an axe to murder his parents, two brothers, and a sister while they were asleep. All died from blows to the head. The next morning police discovered a confused Licata in a bedroom of the family home. He was wearing a clean pressed shirt and trousers, although beneath the clean clothes his body was smeared in blood. His family were all buried at the Italian Club of Tampa Cemetery Despite evidence Licata had a pre-existing history of mental illness, police and the press made unattributed claims that he was \\"addicted\\" to marijuana. On October 17, 1933, the Tampa Bay Times wrote: > W. D. Bush, city chief detective, said he had made an investigation prior to > the crime and learned the slayer had been addicted to smoking marijuana > cigarettes for more than six months. However, a day later the Chief of Tampa Police Department downplayed the role the drug had in the murders, although he pledged himself to the cause of marijuana prohibition: An October 20, 1933, editorial on page six of the Tampa Morning Tribune was entitled \\"Stop This Murderous Smoke\\". The editorial writer called for the prohibition of marijuana: > [I]t may or may not be wholly true that the pernicious marijuana cigarette > is responsible for the murderous mania of a Tampa young man in exterminating > all the members of his family within his reach — but whether or not the > poisonous mind-wrecking weed is mainly accountable for the tragedy its sale > should not be and should never have been permitted here or elsewhere. Licata was never prosecuted for murdering his family. He was examined by psychiatrists eleven days after his arrest and was diagnosed with \\"dementia praecox with homicidal tendencies\\". This made him \\"overtly psychotic\\" with a condition that was \\"acute and chronic\\". It was determined that he was \\"subject to hallucinations accompanied by homicidal impulses and periods of excitement\\". He was committed to the Florida Hospital for the Insane in Chatahoochie, Florida on November 3, 1933. His medical file does not reference his marijuana usage. On October 15, 1945, Licata and four other patients escaped. All were quickly recaptured, except licata. Years later, he visited a cousin in New Orleans and was recaptured by the police with the assistance of the cousin. He was then incarcerated at the Florida State Prison in Raiford, Florida. A few months later, on December 4, 1950, Licata committed suicide by hanging himself. ==Anti-drug propaganda== Even though evidence indicated that Licata had long been suffering from psychosis, the Press turned the Licata case into a drug-use cause célèbre. Evidence shows that a year before the murders, Tampa police had filed a petition to have Licata institutionalized for mental illness. But it was withdrawn when the family vowed to increase their oversight of his behavior. Mental illness ran in the Licata family, and prison psychiatrists speculated that he had inherited his insanity as his parents were first cousins. One of the brothers he slew was a diagnosed schizophrenic and his paternal granduncle and two paternal cousins had also been institutionalized for mental illness. Nevertheless, the role that marijuana had to play in the murders led it to be cited by proponents of anti- drug laws as evidence of \\"marijuana-crime-insanity\\". The case served to inspire media depictions of normal people driven to criminal insanity by the \\"evil weed\\" such as the notorious 1936 exploitation film Tell Your Children (a.k.a. Reefer Madness). In 1941, Cornell Woolrich under his pen name William Irish published the dime novel Marihuana: A Drug-Crazed Killer at Large. The story is about a man who goes on a murder spree after being exposed to marijuana for the first time. The book exploits the marijuana-crime-insanity trope popularized by drug prohibitionists who used the Licata case as an example. Foremost proponent of the Licata story was Harry Anslinger, Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics from 1930 until 1962, who used the case to insist that marijuana usage caused insanity and criminality. In his highly influential 1937 article \\"Marijuana, Assassin of Youth\\" he wrote about Licata and his crimes. Anslinger reused the story during his testimony at the Congress hearings for the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937: Anslinger characterized Licata's hallucinations as a marijuana-induced dream in notes he took of the case: > A twenty-one-year-old boy in FLORIDA killed his parents, two brothers and a > sister while under the influence of a Marihuana \\"dream\\" which he later > described to law enforcement officials. He told rambling stories of being > attacked in his bedroom by \\"his uncle, a strange old woman and two men and > two women,\\" whom he said hacked off his arms and otherwise mutilated him; > later in the dream, he saw \\"real blood\\" dripping from an axe. In the 1960s Anslinger served as the U.S. Representative to the United Nations Narcotics Commission from 1962 to 1964. In 1966, the United Nations publication Bulletin of Narcotics again referenced the Licata case in an article entitled \\"Marihuana and Crime\\". The article was written by Dr. James C. Munch, who was a member of the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics's Advisory Committee. In a chart appended to the article: Munch, a pharmacologist who had been employed by Food and Drug Administration, had testified on the pernicious effects of marijuana in the 1937 congressional Marijuana Tax Act hearings. His testimony came directly after Anslinger's appearance. ==References== Category:1912 births Category:1950 deaths Category:20th- century American criminals Category:American male criminals Category:American mass murderers Category:American murderers of children Category:Axe murder Category:Male suicides Category:Mass murder in 1933 Category:Parricides Category:Murderers who committed suicide Category:Sororicides Category:People from Tampa, Florida Category:People acquitted by reason of insanity Category:Suicides by hanging in Florida Category:Stabbing attacks in the United States Category:1933 in cannabis Category:1933 murders in the United States ","title":"Victor Licata"},{"id":"35220801","text":"Scleranthus biflorus is a cushion-bush found in Australia and New Zealand.

The Judicial Conduct Commissioner's findings were subject to a successful judicial review by Wilson in the full High Court, which found the Judicial Conduct Commissioner had made several errors in law.Wilson v Attorney-General [2011] 1 NZLR 399 (HC). The Court was also troubled that Wilson had been subject to the release of the report, which is envisaged to be confidential. The Court noted that Wilson had been the subject of \\"inaccurate publicity, apparently designed to hound him from office\\". Wilson announced in October 2010 that he would resign from the Supreme Court, effective 5 November. The Ministry of Justice gave him one year's salary and per the JCC and JCP Act, his legal fees were paid for. It was reported that the government had rejected an earlier offer of Wilson to resign because the terms were unacceptable to the government.Claire Trevett and Phil Taylor, \\"Terms 'too great' on judge's first offer to quit\\", New Zealand Herald, 2010-10-22.

The bridge is the main and only road route within the city connecting Ottawa's south side to the center of the city, and is a part of Illinois Routes 23 and 71. The bridge connects to State Street on the south end, and to Columbus Street and La Salle Street on the north end, one-way streets in Ottawa's city center. The bridge sits about to the east and upriver from the vertical-lift railroad bridge in Ottawa, and sits at the mouth of the Fox River as it enters the Illinois River. The bridge was opened in 1981, replacing the old truss bridge that once crossed the river about to the west. The key feature of the bridge is that it has a very high and long main span. The high and wide main span is much safer for the navigation of river traffic than the older bridge, which had a narrower central span. The bridge connects high to the bluff at the south end, is level for two spans, then connects low to the valley floor in the city center. The lengths of the bridge spans are , , and . ==See also== *List of crossings of the Illinois River Category:Bridges completed in 1981 Category:Bridges in LaSalle County, Illinois Category:Bridges over the Illinois River Category:Concrete bridges in the United States ","title":"Veterans Memorial Bridge (Ottawa, Illinois)"},{"id":"35220955","text":"Fragment of a mural from Bawit A representation of Christ Bawit ( Bāwīṭ; Coptic: ⲡⲁⲩⲏⲧ Bawet) is an archaeological site located north of Asyut, near the village of Dashlout, in Egypt. It covers an area of , and houses a cemetery and the ruins of the Hermopolite Monastery of Apa Apollo founded by Apollo in the late fourth century. The structures on this site are relatively well preserved, and demonstrate different aspects of a monastic complex of Middle Egypt. ==History== The Apa Apolla monastery (Coptic: ⲧⲟⲡⲟⲥ ⲛⲁⲡⲁ ⲁⲡⲟⲗⲗⲱ) is a Coptic monastery founded c. 385/390 and had about 500 monks. The sixth and seventh centuries were a period of prosperity for this monastery, which then hosted a community of women, under the patronage of St. Rachel. A fresco found at the monastery depicting St. Rachel dates to the sixth century. After the Islamic invasion, the monastery declined, and was abandoned around the tenth century. ==Excavation== In early 1901, a survey of the site and surrounding areas was made by Jean Clédat, who was based at the French Institute of Oriental Archaeology in Cairo. Continuing into 1902, Clédat was assisted by Émile Gaston Chassinat and Charles Palanque. Clédat found hermitages he called \\"chapels\\" that contained Coptic art. His colleagues discovered two churches, today simply called North and South Church, with stone and wood carvings that were removed to the Coptic Museum in Cairo and the Musée du Louvre in Paris. Numerous sculptures and paintings were unearthed during the excavations. The papyrologist Jean Maspero (1885–1915) resumed excavations in 1913, discovering a common room with several entrances. In 1976, then 1984 and 1985, the Supreme Council of Antiquities resumed excavations and added to the collections of the Coptic Museum. Since then, excavations have continued under various organizations. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Jean Clédat, 1901, \\"Notes archéologiques et philologiques\\", Bulletin de l'Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale du Caire (BIFAO), no 1, p. 87-91 *Jean Clédat, 1902, \\"Recherches sur le kôm de Baouît\\", Comptes Rendus de l'Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres (CRAIBL), no 30, p. 525-546 *Jean Clédat, 1904, \\"Le monastère et la nécropole de Baouît\\", Mémoires de l'Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale du Caire (MIFAO), no XII, 1 et 2 *Jean Clédat, 1904, \\"Nouvelles recherches à Baouît (Haute-Égypte).

Cabrera invented the blocks as a way to teach his graduate and doctoral students systems thinking at Cornell University.Distributed Knowledge: ThinkBlocks Like an Ergonomic Chair. E-Clips Cornell University. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4qkHbraPOc ThinkBlocks are designed to model concepts and build thinking skills based on the DSRP theory and method of thinking.Cabrera, D. and Colosi, L. (2009) Thinking at Every Desk: How Four Simple Thinking Skills Will Transform Your Teaching, Classroom, School, and District. Ithaca, NY: The Research Institute for Thinking in Education. This theory posits that four patterns, Distinctions, Systems, Relationships, and Perspectives, underlie all cognition, that they are universal to the process of structuring information, and that people can improve their thinking skills by learning to use the four elements explicitly. Students assign concepts to blocks by writing on them with dry-erase markers, and then associate them with other concepts by using the multi-nesting (multiple blocks inside of blocks), barbell (relational nodes), and looking glass (translucent) properties of the blocks. They were originally white, magnetic dodecahedra in three nested sizes, with one reflective side. In 2012, a new translucent cube-shaped version of the block was introduced. ThinkBlocks were a National Parenting Center Seal of Approval Winner in Fall 2008. ==History== ThinkBlocks (also called DSRP Blocks for the cognitive theory upon which they are based) were invented by Derek Cabrera and debuted at the Chicago International Toy Fair in November, 2007. At that time, ThinkBlocks were sets of opaque white magnetic, dry-erase polyhedra in three different sizes, and sold in sets of 26: 2 large, 8 medium, and 16 small blocks. The large and medium sizes were hollow, such that smaller sizes nest inside of larger ones, and the large and medium sizes also have one reflective side each. In March, 2012, the \\"Thinking at Every Desk\\" Facebook page announced the launch of \\"ThinkBlocks 2.0\\". These new blocks are translucent non-magnetic cubes and were redesigned, in part, to work in parallel with a diagramming technique called DSRP Diagrams. Like the version 1.0 blocks, version 2.0 blocks are dry-eraseable and nesting. One large 2.0 block fits 8 medium blocks, which in turn fit 8 small blocks. Large blocks are 5 cu. in., medium blocks 2 cu. in, and small blocks 1 cu. in. ==Educational philosophy== ThinkBlocks can be used in multiple ways. Children can play with them as with other blocks, attaching and detaching different blocks with one another and nesting smaller blocks within larger blocks. They are also designed to be used in conjunction with the Patterns of Thinking method, as a so-called \\"tactile manipulative\\" used to model ideas. Derek Cabrera, creator of ThinkBlocks, has said that his educational philosophy has been influenced by Jean Piaget's constructivism, and ThinkBlocks reflect this, particularly when used in conjunction with DSRP/Patterns of Thinking: a child becomes an active participant in \\"constructing\\" knowledge as he or she models ideas with the blocks. ThinkBlocks are also part of a class of educational tools called tactile manipulatives. Tactile manipulatives are popular in math subjects (especially in the elementary grades) and in Montessori education. ThinkBlocks were designed to be used in any grade and any topic thereby extending the range of use of tactile manipulatives. The linkage between the four DSRP thinking skills and tactile manipulatives appeared in Scientific American Mind in 2010.Cabrera, D. and Colosi, L. (2010) The World at Our Fingertips: The Connection Between Touch and Learning. Scientific American Mind, 21, 36-41. DOI: 10.1038/scientificamericanmind0910-36 ==Applications== ThinkBlocks have been used extensively in pre-school, elementary, secondary, and post-secondary classroom settings, including by the Ithaca City School District in Ithaca, NY, and Fairfax County School District in Fairfax, VA.

She received her Ph.D. in Korean Literature from Konkuk University and began as a poet in 1979 with the publication of Poet Smoking a Cigarette (Dambaereul piuneun siin) and four other poems in Literature and Intellect. Kim is an important contemporary poet in South Korea, and she lives in Seoul and teaches creative writing at the Seoul Institute of the Arts. Kim was in the forefront of women published in a literary journal, Munhak kwa jisŏng (Literature and Intellect). ==Work== Kim started to receive critical acclaim in the late 1990s and it is her own belief that her work was partly recognized because at that time there was a generally strong wave of women's poets and poetry. Kim is the recipient of multiple literary prizes including the Kim Su-yŏng Literature Award (1996) for her poem, A Poor Love Machine, Sowol Poetry Literature Award (2000), and Midang Literature Award (2006), which are named after three renowned contemporary Korean poets. Kim was the first woman poet to receive the Kim Su-yŏng Literature Award, Midang Award, contemporary poetry award and Daesan Literary Award, Lee Hyoung-Gi Literary Award (2019), Griffin Poetry Prize (2019). Kim's poetry collections include: From another star (1981), Father's scarecrow (1985), The Hell of a certain star (1987), Our negative picture (1991), My Upanishad, Seoul (1994), A Poor Love Machine (1997), To the Calendar Factory Manager (2000), A Glass of Red Mirror (2004), Your First (2008), and Sorrowtoothpaste Mirrorcream (2011)Blossom, Pig(2016) Autobiography of Death(2016), Wing Phantom Pain(2019). Kim has participated in readings at poetry festivals all over the world: Smith College Poetry Center (2003), Taipei Poetry Festival (2008), 41st Poetry International Festival Rotterdam (2010), Poesie Festival Berlin (2011), Poetry Parnassus London (2012), Stockholm international Poetry Festival(2014), Hong Kong International Poetry nights(2015), Festival for World Literature Cologne (2018) The Center for Art of Translation (2019) Poetry Foundation (2019) AAWW (2019) Fokus Lylic – Festivalkongress, Frankfurt (2019), Mason de Ra Poesie Paris (2019), L Ecole normale Superieure (2019), St, John's College, Cambridge (2019), New Castle Poetry Festival (2019), Litteratur Huset Trondheim Norway (2019), Litteratur pa Bla, Oslo (2019), Terrapolis, Charlottenborg Copenhagen (2019), etc. Kim Hyesoon's Poetry was used for Jenny Holzer's exhibit at the Korean National Museum of Modern contemporary Art. Kim's skill as a writer resides in her facility at combining poetic images with experimental language while simultaneously grounding her work in ‘feminine writing’ drawn from female experiences. Her language is violent and linguistically agile, appropriate for her topics which often center on death and/or injustice.A landmark feminist poet and critic in her native South Korea, Kim Hyesoon's surreal, dagger-sharp poetry has spread from hemisphere to hemisphere in the past ten years, her works translated to Chinese, Swedish, English, French, German, Dutch, and beyond. Kim Hyesoon raises a glass to the reader in the form of a series of riddles, poems conjuring the you inside the me, the night inside the day, the outside inside the inside, the ocean inside the tear. Kim's radical, paradoxical intimacies entail sites of pain as well as wonder, opening onto impossible—which is to say, visionary—vistas. Again and again, in these poems as across her career, Kim unlocks a horizon inside the vanishing point. The birdlike Kim weaves a pattern of poems, so strangely compelling and curious, and utterly unlike anything I had heard before. —Sasha Dugdale Works in English *A Drink of Red Mirror' 'Action Books *The Autobiography of Death New Directions Publishing, translated by Don Mee Choi (the 2019 Griffin Poetry Prize) *Poor Love Machine Action Books *I'm O.K, I'm Pig Bloodaxe Books *Sorrowtoothpaste Mirrorcream Action Books *Mommy Must be a Fountain of Feathers Action Books *Anxiety of Words (Collection with other authors) Zephyr Press *All the Garbage of the World, Unite!

Introduced under the Places to Grow Act in 2005, the Plan was approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council and enacted on June 16, 2006. Administered by the Ontario Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI), the plan identifies density and intensification targets, urban growth centres, strategic employment areas, and settlement area restrictions designed to mitigate negative environmental, economic and human health impacts associated with sprawling, uncoordinated growth in the region. ==History== The Government of Ontario first asserted its role in municipal land use planning through enactment of the City and Suburban Plan Act in 1912. In the Post-World War II period, considerable urban and suburban growth pressures demanded increased provincial intervention in municipal planning through official plan and zoning by-law requirements, and specialized administrative bodies. The Ontario Municipal Board, an independent administrative board, acts as an adjudicative tribunal on all applications and appeals regarding municipal and planning disputes in the province. A legislative structure consisting of provincial statutes and policies, municipal official plans, and land use control instruments (e.g., subdivision control, zoning by-laws) exists in the province today. While Dalton McGuinty’s majority Liberal Government introduced the Growth Plan in 2006, the origin of related smart growth policy goals in Ontario can be traced to the Common Sense Revolution of the Mike Harris Government in the late 1990s. This period was initially characterized by governance reforms aimed at reducing provincial involvement in land use planning and funding of urban infrastructure such as public transit in Ontario. A combination of business and municipal concerns over the negative economic impacts of traffic congestion, rising costs of suburban infrastructure maintenance, and increased citizen opposition to development on the Oak Ridges Moraine pushed the Harris government to re-engage in land use planning. In particular, the unexpected activism of exurban homeowners and urban environmentalists protesting applications for development on the Oak Ridges Moraine \\"challenged urban sprawl…and introduced the notion of integrated regional planning that would simultaneously preserve nature and control development.\\" To address these concerns, the Harris government articulated a \\"smart growth\\" vision for development in the GGH region and established multi-stakeholder regional smart growth panels in April 2001. The Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2001 introduced significant land use and development restrictions in designated areas throughout the Oak Ridges Moraine. While this partially addressed the smart growth goal of ecological preservation, it failed to enact any controls on urban expansion in others areas throughout the GGH or address concerns over preservation of prime agricultural lands outside the Moraine. This lack of commitment did not go unnoticed during campaigns for the 2003 provincial election. The Strong Communities platform of the Liberal Party of Ontario was formulated in \\"direct response to both public and expert pressures to combat the economic, social, and environmental problems associated with suburban expansion.\\" (Eidelman 2010, p. 1214) It promised the introduction of policies and legislation that would: create a 600,000 acre Greenbelt in the GGH; direct infrastructure investments to support compact growth in existing city centres and urban nodes; and articulate a long-term growth management strategy for the GGH taking into account population and employment projections while protecting areas of agriculture, ecological, and recreational significance. The Liberal Party won the 2003 provincial election and Eidelman argues this may be due in large part to their addressing growing anti-sprawl sentiment among critical suburban voters at the time. Post-election the Government of Ontario enacted a series of policies and policy reforms that carried through on commitments made in the Smart Communities platform. Revisions were made to the Provincial Policy Statement, 2005 (PPS)-overarching planning legislation with which all planning decisions in the province must be consistent-to better reflect the smart growth planning goals of the province. Subsequent enactment of the Greenbelt Act, 2005 and the Places to Grow Act, 2005 (PTGA) set the stage for the Greenbelt Plan, 2005 and the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, 2006 respectively. The Growth Plan introduced a variety of mechanisms for managing growth in the GGH region, including population and employment intensification targets, settlement area restrictions, and designated urban growth centres. The complementary Greenbelt Plan restricts development in more than 700,000 hectares of \\"protected countryside\\" surrounding the \\"inner ring\\" of built up area in the GGH. It includes areas previously covered in the Niagara Escarpment Plan, 2005 and Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, 2002, as well as prime agricultural areas, natural heritage areas, and rural countryside areas, each with varying degrees of permissions for non-urban uses. The two plans work together—the former restricting areas where development can occur, and the latter dictating where and how growth shall occur in the GGH region. ==Growth Plan Policies and Objectives== This section presents a summary of key policies and objectives of the Growth Plan, following a sub-structure similar to the plan itself. Context and Vision This section speaks to the Plan's interests in promoting economic prosperity, creating a cleaner environment for investment decisions, and helping to secure the future prosperity of the GGH region. The Plan is based on a 25-year planning horizon, from when it was introduced to 2031. The plan sets out a vision for the GGH to be a great place to live in 2031, have a clean and healthy environment, strong economy and social equity, and easy travel through an integrated transportation network. The GGH will function as Canada's principal international gateway and will have a high standard of living and exceptional quality of life. Building compact and complete communities, promoting collaboration among all sectors, and providing for different approaches to manage growth are some of the principles which will provide the basis for guiding decisions on how land is developed, resources are managed and public dollars invested. The general authority of the Plan is derived from the PTGA, 2005 and applies to the GGH lands designated by Ontario Regulation 416/05 and shown in Schedule 1 of the Plan. While certain policies have specific target dates, the goals and policies of the Plan are intended to be achieved by 2031. The Plan is meant to work with municipal official plans, not replace them. As such, the Plan should be read in conjunction with the applicable PPS and relevant provincial plans, including the Greenbelt Plan, Niagara Escarpment Plan, and Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan. The plan prevails where there is a conflict between it and the PPS, unless there is a conflict between policies relating to the natural environment or human health, where the plan that provides the most protection prevails. Detailed conflict provisions are set out in the PTGA. Each section of the Plan contains specific policies as well as requirements for coordination between the Minister of Infrastructure (MOI), other Ministers of the Crown (CM), municipalities and other relevant stakeholders. Where and How to Grow Context The GGH is one of the fastest growing regions in North America, thus the Plan focuses growth toward intensification areas-including urban growth centres, intensification corridors, major transit station areas, brownfield and greyfield sites-to increase intensification of the existing built-up area. The Plan stresses the importance of building Complete Communities, whether urban or rural, which offer housing and services to meet the needs of people at all stages of life. General information This section of the plan includes policies for population and employment growth forecasts, managing growth, general intensification, urban growth centres, major transit station areas and intensification corridors, employment lands, designated Greenfield areas, settlement areas and boundary expansion, and rural areas. The policies establish intensification and density targets for areas throughout the GGH, and expectations for conformity to the Plan and accommodation of growth forecasts. Schedules See Schedule 3 for population and employment growth forecasts for all upper- and single-tier municipalities in the GGH. See Schedule 4 for identification of urban growth centres for the GGH. An interactive map of urban growth centres and their boundaries is available on the Places to Grow website. Example policies * Focusing intensification in already built-up areas, including urban growth centres, major transit station areas, and intensification corridors * By the year 2015 and for each year thereafter a minimum of 40% of all annual residential development in each upper- and single-tier municipality will be within the 2006 built-up area * Minimum density targets of between 150 and 400 residents and jobs combined per hectare for each urban growth centre must be met by 2031. * Each upper- and single-tier municipality must achieve a minimum density target of 50 residents and jobs combined per hectare in designated green field areas by 2031. Infrastructure to Support Growth Context The Plan provides the framework for infrastructure investments in the GGH, so that existing infrastructure and future investments are optimized to serve growth to 2031 and beyond. The focus is on intensification, compact urban form, transportation infrastructure, investment in water and waste water systems, and community infrastructure. An overarching goal is efficient capital investment in compact urban form to reduce capital costs. General Information This section includes policies on infrastructure planning, general transportation, moving people, moving goods, water and waste systems, and community infrastructure. Schedules See Schedule 5 for a map of proposed future transit infrastructure investments. See Schedule 6 for a map of proposed future goods movement infrastructure investments. Protecting What is Valuable Context The Plan builds on existing initiatives for the wise use and management of all resources, natural heritage, agriculture and mineral aggregates in the Ontario Heritage Act, 1990 the PPS, the Greenbelt Plan, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, and the Niagara Escarpment Plan. General Information The sections on \\"Natural Systems\\", \\"Prime Agricultural Areas\\", and \\"Mineral Aggregate Resources\\" all include policies for coordination between the MOI and other CM, municipalities and other relevant stakeholders. These sections also include policies for carrying over provincial plan policies, and other policies relevant to each respective section. Section 4.2.4. \\"A Culture of Conservation\\" includes policies for the development and implementation of water and energy conservation, air quality and waste management objectives in municipal official plans. Implementation and Interpretation Context The coordination and collaboration of all levels of government, non-governmental organizations, the private sector, and citizens will be required for the success of the Plan. An index is under development to help monitor the Plan's progress. The PTGA provides the legislative framework for the Plan, and includes the requirement that the MOI review the Plan at least every 10 years after it came into effect. General Information This section includes policies pertaining to implementation analysis, general implementation and interpretation, coordination, monitoring and performance measures, and public engagement. Simcoe Sub-Area Amendment Context Added as an amendment in 2012, the policies in this section direct a significant portion of growth within the Simcoe Sub-area to communities where development can be most effectively serviced. The policies also provide a greater range of opportunities for how growth can occur in the sub-area, with an emphasis on directing growth to primary settlement areas. General information This section contains policies pertaining to growth forecasts, managing growth in settlement areas and primary settlement areas, and employment lands. Schedules See Schedule 7 for detailed population and employment forecasts for each city and township in the Simcoe Sub-area See Schedule 8 for designated employment areas, employment districts and primary settlement areas for the Simcoe Sub-area Definitions For detailed definitions of terms used throughout the summary above, and in the Plan generally, see section 7 of the Plan itself. Schedules The Schedules include maps, tables and figures referenced throughout the Plan. Schedules included in the Plan are as follows: * Schedule 1 – Greater Golden Horseshoe Growth Plan Area * Schedule 2 – Places to Grow Concept * Schedule 3 – Distribution of Population and Employment for the Greater Golden Horseshoe 2001-2031 * Schedule 4 – Urban Growth Centres * Schedule 5 – Moving People – Transit * Schedule 6 – Moving Goods * Schedule 7 – Distribution of Population and Employment for the City of Barrie, City of Orillia and County of Simcoe to 2031 * Schedule 8 – Simcoe Sub-area ==Implementation== Legislative Background Prior to enacting the Growth Plan, the first step in interpreting the Places to Grow Act, 2005 was the identification of \\"growth plan areas\\". Municipalities that fall under jurisdiction of the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe were subsequently designated in Ontario Regulation 416/05. These are: # Brant. # Dufferin. # Durham. # Haldimand. # Halton. # Hamilton. # Kawartha Lakes. # Niagara. # Northumberland. # Peel. # Peterborough. # Simcoe. # Toronto. # Waterloo. # Wellington. # York. As they fall within the designated growth plan area, these municipalities are required to amend their Official Plans (OPs) to conform to the Growth Plan. These amendments must occur at or before 3 years past the date that the Growth Plan came into effect. The Growth Plan was enacted in June 2006, thus all municipalities should have amended their plans to conform by June 2009. Section 5.3 of the Growth Plan lists four specific efforts that municipalities (along with the Minister of Infrastructure, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing and other stakeholders) will undertake in order to implement the policies outlined in the growth plan. These include: # Confirming the built boundary # Assessing the need for new Greenfield areas to accommodate municipal growth forecasts in Schedule 3. # Identification of urban growth centres # Sub-assessment of regional issues including: economic analysis and employment lands; transportation networks; water and waste water servicing, natural systems, prime agricultural areas, and significant mineral aggregate resources. Municipal Compliance as of February 2012 The process of amending an OP can be complex and there are many opportunities for appeal throughout the process. As of February 2012, only six municipalities within the GGH have amended and approved OPs which are fully in effect (City of Brantford, City of Guelph, County of Haldimand, City of Peterborough, County of Peterborough, County of Wellington). Another three municipalities (City of Barrie, Region of Halton, City of Orillia) have amended OPs which are partially in effect, with certain portions under appeal to the Ontario Municipal Board (OMB). The majority of municipalities have OPs which are currently under appeal to the OMB including; the Region of Durham, City of Hamilton, City of Kawartha Lakes, Region of Niagara, Region of Peel, County of Simcoe, City of Toronto, Region of Waterloo, and Region of York. The upper-tier municipalities of Dufferin and Northumberland have provided growth management strategies rather than specific official plans to guide development within their lower tier municipalities. From this, it can be observed that there is a wide variation in the level of municipal compliance and commitment to the policies and goals outlined in the Growth Plan. This represents a considerable challenge, as regional planning requires consistency to be effective. Official Plan Amendment Case Studies To further examine the variation in municipal compliance with growth plan policies, several Official Plan amendment case studies are presented below. Pickering The City of Pickering is a lower-tier municipality within the upper-tier municipality of Durham. In 2009 the Durham Regional Council adopted Regional Official Plan Amendment (ROPA) 128, which was subsequently sent to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing for approval. The Ministry voiced several majors concerns with the plan in a letter to Durham Region in 2010. These concerns included: * Addition of employment lands without justification. * Exclusion of existing residential lands from the land supply analysis. * New residential greenfield development was predominantly in the form of single and semi-detached homes, which is not a transit-supportive type of built form. More specifically, the Ministry expressed concern over a new greenfield development being proposed in northeast Pickering, which required conversion of approximately 1200 hectares of farmland into residential uses for 30,000 new residents. In order to address these and other concerns the Ministry proposed several modifications to the ROPA including the removal of the northeast Pickering expansion area and an intensification strategy for existing urban areas to ensure current infrastructure and land supply are used efficiently. The response from Durham Region to the Minister's decisions was not positive as it posited that the refusals and modifications \\"compromised the growth management vision for the Region, and \\"inappropriately implemented the Central Pickering Development Plan.\\" As such, the Durham Region has appealed the Minister's decision to the OMB, which will now be the final approval authority for ROPA 128. A final decision from the OMB has yet to be determined. Guelph In response to the policies outlined in the Growth Plan, the City of Guelph adopted a Local Growth Management Strategy in June 2008. The strategy provided a set of key growth principles and projected growth forecasts to inform the city's Official Plan Amendment (OPA). OPA 39 introduced the Growth Plan concepts of urban growth centres, greenfield areas, built-up areas and settlement areas into Guelph's Official Plan. Moreover, OPA 39 shows significant commitment to the goals outlined in the Growth Plan as it: outlines the creation of a Downtown Secondary Plan to meet the requirements of the designated urban growth centre (s.2.4.6.); designates a major transit station area (s.2.4.7.) and intensification corridor (s.2.4.8); and commits to compact neighbourhood development through secondary plans within greenfield areas (s.2.4.10). It also provides several overarching growth management principles including a decision that all growth will be accommodated within the existing corporate boundaries of Guelph. It is also worth noting that OPA 39 contains provisions for potentially meeting the Growth Plan intensification target of 40% of new residential development taking place within the 2006 built-up area, prior to the deadline of 2015 (s.2.4.5.1). The City of Guelph Council adopted OPA 39 in June 2009, and the Minister for Municipal Affairs and Housing granted approval of OPA 39 in November 2009. Vaughan Appeals to the OMB have also come from citizen groups, as seen in the case of the Official Plan amendment in the City of Vaughan. The City of Vaughan is a lower-tier municipality within the upper-tier municipality of York Region. As prescribed by the Growth Plan, the Region of York passed several Regional Official Plan Amendments (ROPAs). Among these was an amendment to expand the City of Vaughan's urban boundary (ROPA 2). This urban boundary expansion was detailed in an amendment to the city's Official Plan, previously approved by Vaughan City Council in September 2010. A local citizen environmental group, Sustainable Vaughan, strongly opposed these amendments. Sustainable Vaughan appealed the province's decision to approve these ROPAs to the OMB in October 2010. Sustainable Vaughan argued that the proposed development outside the Growth Plan settlement area did not meet the prescribed provincial criteria for urban boundary expansion. Their opposition was based on several facts, including: there was no feasibility study conducted to show whether or not development in this area could occur in a sustainable manner; there was no study undertaken to examine how development would affect prime agricultural lands in the expansion area and adjacent natural heritage areas; and ROPA 2 was missing population projections for 6 areas that were slated for development. The OMB is currently conducting mediation and prehearing on this matter, and thus a final decision has not been given. ==Criticisms== The Growth Plan has been subject to substantial criticism from academics and environmental groups, as well as the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario. These criticisms have generally centred on the topics of density, the urban growth boundary, transportation, and more recently, the Simcoe Sub-area Amendment. Density The main concerns regarding density and the Growth Plan involve the prescribed density targets themselves, as well as how the density targets and growth projections are calculated. Questions have been raised over the underlying assumptions of density and growth projections, including concerns over the assumption that growth will continue to occur at a high rate in the region. Furthermore, concerns have been raised over the capacity of the region's environment to actually sustain such continuous and rapid growth. More technical arguments have also been made regarding the method in which density targets have been calculated, including concerns over the lack of net density calculations. In regards to the specific density targets included in the plan, much criticism has been directed at the intensification target of 40% of all new residential development occurring in built up areas by 2015. Because this trend is already occurring in many parts of the GTA, many argue that this target does little to challenge existing growth patterns and is likely too low to result in an effective reduction in sprawl. Similar criticisms have been directed towards the Plan's minimum density target of 50 residents plus jobs per hectare for greenfield development areas. It has been argued that this level of density is not transit supportive, and enforcement of the target as an average across upper- and single-tier municipalities permits lower density development that will do little to reduce the current pattern of sprawl. Concerns over where intensification is to occur have also been voiced. In particular, intensification along the fringe of an urban growth boundary may not represent an effective use of land or existing infrastructure. Urban Growth Boundary Much controversy has developed over the policies relating to urban boundaries set out in the Growth Plan. The Pembina Institute has criticized provisions within the Plan that allow for any developments smaller than 300 hectares and proposed before enactment of the Growth Plan to be exempt from the policies and restrictions within the Plan. Pembina argues that this provision is too generous and runs contrary to the overarching urban containment goals of the Growth Plan. Schedule 2 of the Plan, the Places to Grow Concept, indicates proposed expansion of Highway 404 into Greenbelt Plan areas. This has been interpreted as a sign of weak commitment to the environmental goals of the Growth Plan and Greenbelt Plan, in favour of infrastructure development to support economic growth. The ability of the plan to prevent \\"leap-frogging\\", whereby development skips over areas protected in the Greenbelt Plan to rural and agricultural area in the \\"outer ring\\", has also been questioned.< Lastly, there are concerns over the management of rural and agricultural \\"whitebelt\\" areas, which do not fall within the Greenbelt Plan area or the Growth Plan settlement area boundaries. Areas within the whitebelt contain significant natural features and agricultural lands, but the Growth Plan contains few legislated protections against their urbanization. Some groups have also expressed economic concerns regarding the urban boundary established in the Growth Plan. There is much debate over the impacts of urban growth boundaries on housing prices. Many argue that by restricting the supply of developable land, such boundaries can drive up housing prices. A report published by the Federation of Rental-Housing Providers of Ontario suggested that the Growth Plan must do more to facilitate intensification in built up areas, as well as allow increased densities, to mitigate impacts on housing affordability. Transportation The development of complete communities with a range of transit options is an explicit purpose of the Growth Plan, but without sufficient densities, public transit is unlikely to become a viable option for certain settlement areas. The Pembina Institute's analysis of the Growth Plan has suggested that the minimum greenfield development density target of 50 residents plus jobs per hectare is barely sufficient to justify provincial investment in public transit infrastructure in these areas. Allotted densities in some parts of the GGH are even lower, with municipalities such as the County of Simcoe being allotted densities of only 41 residents plus jobs per hectare. In most rural areas of the GGH, existing towns also lack sufficient densities to support transit infrastructure, which may deter the transit investment necessary to encourage intensification targets in the Growth Plan. A report by the Greenbelt Alliance suggests that this has created a self-reinforcing cycle of low density, sprawling growth that must be dealt with through a coordinated provincial and municipal intervention effort that would bring public transit investment to areas lacking sufficient densities. In the meantime, the Greenbelt Alliance has made recommendations for rural communities to engage in forms of \\"social transportation\\", such as corporate vanpooling and fixed route taxis in order to encourage growth toward densities that could later support more substantial provincial investment in public transit systems. Environmental interest groups have advised that the province and municipalities should make building transit supportive densities a high priority—to avoid the propagation of bedroom communities and an increasing environmental burden on the greenbelt, and for the benefit of complete, compact and sustainable communities. Simcoe Sub- area Amendment In 2009, the MOI released the Simcoe Area: A Strategic Vision for Growth report to guide local implementation of Growth Plan policies. Subsequently, the first amendment to the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe was enacted on January 19, 2012. This amendment affects the Simcoe Sub-area, which comprises the regional municipality of the County of Simcoe, and the single-tier municipalities of Barrie and Orillia. Commentary on the Ministry of Infrastructure's Growth Secretariat website for the Places to Grow Act provides the following statement on the purpose of the amendment: The amended Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe provides more specific direction for municipalities in Simcoe County and the cities of Barrie and Orillia, to implement the Growth Plan. It gives the Simcoe Sub-area planning certainty to support local decision-making, provide opportunities for job creation, and support an improved quality of life, all while limiting sprawl and protecting valuable farmland and green spaces. (Growth Secretariat, 2012) Ceding significant regulatory oversight to the municipal councils of the Simcoe Sub-area, the provisions iterated in the new plan have attracted criticism that the amendment is in contravention of other provincial policy goals expressed in the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan, the Greenbelt Plan, and the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe itself. Given the sensitive ecology of the Lake Simcoe watershed, proximity of the greenbelt, and the region's predilection for uncoordinated urban sprawl, concerns around the amendment have largely been related to increased environmental impacts. Policies within the amendment re-designate strategic employment areas along the Highway 400 corridor in Bradford West-Gwillimbury and Innisfil. A report from the Greenbelt Alliance states that this will undermine the Growth Plan's intention to curb sprawl and create complete communities, because it encourages greenfield development in isolation from existing settlement areas and infrastructure. This report also identifies concerns related to the possibility of increased leapfrog development whereby greenfield development skips over the greenbelt to areas in the \\"outer ring\\", which includes the Simcoe Sub-area. This could lead to more roadways traversing the greenbelt to connect commuters from low-density urban settlements in the County of Simcoe to employment centres in \\"inner ring\\" municipalities like Toronto. Critics are concerned about associated negative implications for air quality and climate change mitigation strategies in the GGH region. Interest groups, such as the STORM Coalition, are concerned that the proposed Highway 400 employment corridor is counterintuitive to the \\"complete communities\\" concept of the Places to Grow Act and Growth Plan. They have criticized the transition of greenfield areas in the County of Simcoe for newly designated employment purposes given that thousands of hectares of land in other parts of the GGH are already designated for employment uses. Opponents of this development have noted that economic corridor provisions in the amended Growth Plan have been introduced prior to undertaking any Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which is required under the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan. An EIA is needed to determine what effects development of the Highway 400 employment corridor might have on the fragile ecology of the Lake Simcoe watershed, given the scale of new infrastructure required to support this project. The increased burden of phosphorus and water runoff into Lake Simcoe implied by the introduction of the Simcoe Sub-area Amendment is another prominent concern among environmental commentators. Studies have shown that development targets in the amended Growth Plan could result in an additional 14,328 kg of phosphorus entering Lake Simcoe every year. The original population growth projections of 230,000 new residents within the Simcoe Sub-area had already raised concerns as to whether such a level of growth is consistent with the intensification goals of the Growth Plan. The allocation of an additional 20,000 residents at the discretion of Simcoe County under the amended Growth Plan has sparked further concern that the Simcoe Sub-area amendment favours development interests at the expense of environmental security and smart growth. (Malcolmson, 2012). Although the amended Growth Plan includes recommendations that communities implement urban and architectural designs that will increase efficiencies in energy, water, and wastewater management, these recommendations are not binding. The Simcoe Sub-area Amendment ultimately cedes discretion to municipalities within the Simcoe Sub-area to design their own environmental and urban design strategies, and determine their own patterns of growth and development. ==References *Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing *Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe Official Homepage *Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act,2001 *Provincial Policy Statement *Greenbelt Plan, 2005 *Places to Grow Act Homepage Category:Politics of Ontario ","title":"Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe"},{"id":"35221114","text":"Amin August Jr. (born August 16, 1990) is a Belizean professional forward currently playing for Santa Elena. ==External links== * Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Belize international footballers Category:Belizean footballers Category:2011 Copa Centroamericana players Category:Association football forwards Category:Police United FC (Belize) players Category:Verdes FC players ","title":"Amin August Jr."},{"id":"35221124","text":"Edgar Joachim Moeller (November 7, 1873May 26, 1954) was an early twentieth- century American architect who partnered with Harry Mulliken to build several apartment hotels in New York City.

The tradeoff exists because accommodating flexibility requires satisfying a larger set of requirements, which results in complexity and usability compromises. Design theory maintains that over their lifecycle, systems shift from supporting multiple uses inefficiently, towards efficiently supporting a single use as users' needs become more defined and better understood, both by themselves and designers. When weighting the relative importance of flexibility versus usability, designers are advised to consider how well the needs of the user are understood. If user needs are well understood, designers should bias toward simple less-flexible systems. Otherwise, designers should create flexible designs that support multiple future applications. == References == Category:Usability Category:Human–computer interaction Category:Technical communication ","title":"Flexibility–usability tradeoff"},{"id":"35221193","text":"Pretoria North () is a suburb of the city of Pretoria in Gauteng, South Africa, with a population of 16,972 people according to the 2011 census. Pretoria North was first settled in 1878 by a pioneer column of Afrikaner farmers who started farming alongside the passing Apies River. The Area became a stopping point for travelers moving through the North of Pretoria to the Northern Transvaal. In 1904 an English medium primary School was established in Pretoria. This School was the antecedent to the current Laerskool Danie Malan on the corners of Rachel De Beer and Jan van Riebeeck streets in Pretoria North. This School has been an anchor of the Pretoria North Community for over 110 years and is rich in history and tradition. Other Schools in the Pretoria North Precinct include, Laerskool Rachel de Beer, Laerskool Voortrekker Eeufees, High Schools Hoërskool Gerrit Maritz and Hoërskool Pretoria-Noord. Judging by the structure of the education system in Pretoria North, it is possible to recognise that Pretoria North is a primarily Afrikaans speaking area. All schools in the area are Afrikaans medium. As the name suggests, it is situated to the north of the city centre. It lies from Church Square, just north of the Magaliesberg and adjacent to Paul Kruger Street (the M1) and the railway line from Pretoria to Polokwane. The Railway connecting Pretoria with Polokwane was laid down by the Paul Kruger Administration in between 1886 and 1899. The Construction was disrupted by the Anglo Boer War but it was finalized before 1910. The Wonderboom station of the railway line is part of the Pretoria North complex and was a reason why the area developed into a small town of its own, functionally connected to the greater city of Pretoria. With transport being its main industry, Pretoria North has two automobile sales corridors in the form of Rachel De Beer street and Gerrit Maritz streets being home to over 50 car dealerships. Pretoria North has one of the highest concentration of car dealerships in the country. Transport is the core of Pretoria North's industrial activity. The area boasts a light motor industrial corridor couched by east and Gerrit Maritz Streets. Glass makers, panel beaters, parts manufacturers and mechanics work in the chain of warehouses in this eastern corridor. At the heart of the Pretoria North CBD is the North Park shopping mall which is a very small and quiet shopping center not maintained anymore. The main retail activity in Pretoria North takes place in the displaced retail center of Shoprite located on the corner of Ben Viljoen and Gerrit Maritz Streets. Other business centers include Solomons General Dealers on Gerrit Maritz Street and Tele Tech on Ben Viljoen Street. The Pretoria North area is largely residential with the Rachel De Beer and Gerrit Maritz corridors straddled by Ben Viljoen Street being the central business district. The Town Planning that went into designing Pretoria North was very poor as the area did not leave space for cultural landmarks and heritage sites. Pretoria North sometimes refers to the general area to the North of the City of Pretoria. This general definition is broad and encompasses the Wonderboom area to the east of Lavender Road and Akasia to the west of Daan De Wet Nel Drive. This broad definition of Pretoria North is a colloquial concept and is not to be confused with the concept in this article. The Onderstepoort campus of the University of Pretoria Faculty of Veterinary Science, and the Wonderboom Airport are nearby. ==References== Category:Suburbs of Pretoria Khumo Thage Industrial Geographer ","title":"Pretoria North"},{"id":"35221205","text":"Eckert II projection of the world The Eckert II projection is an equal-area pseudocylindrical map projection. In the equatorial aspect (where the equator is shown as the horizontal axis) the network of longitude and latitude lines consists solely of straight lines, and the outer boundary has the distinctive shape of an elongated hexagon. It was first described by Max Eckert in 1906 as one of a series of three pairs of pseudocylindrical projections. Within each pair, the meridians have the same shape, and the odd-numbered projection has equally spaced parallels, whereas the even-numbered projection has parallels spaced to preserve area. The pair to Eckert II is the Eckert I projection. == Description == The projection is symmetrical about the straight equator and straight central meridian. Parallels vary in spacing in order to preserve areas. As a pseudocylindric projection, spacing of meridians along any given parallel is constant. The poles are represented as lines, each half as long as the equator. The projection has correct scale only on the central meridian at latitudes 55°10′ north and south. The projection's x and y coordinates can be computed as : \\\\begin{align} x &= 2 R \\\\left(\\\\lambda - \\\\lambda_0 \\\\right) \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{4-3\\\\sin\\\\varphi}{6\\\\pi}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ y &= R \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2 \\\\pi}{3}} \\\\left(2 - \\\\sqrt{4 - 3 \\\\sin \\\\varphi}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} where λ is the longitude, λ0 is the central meridian, φ is the latitude, and R is the radius of the globe to be projected.

He commenced his career with Kurri Kurri Juniors in the late 1920s and in 1935 went on to be selected to play for the Australian team to tour New Zealand. ==Life and Club and Representative Career== Mick was born in 1912 at Cowdenbeath, Scotland to Michael and Mary Shields (née O'Neill). In 1915 the family immigrated to Australia to live in the small mining town of Kurri Kurri in New South Wales. He commenced his football career in his teens with Kurri Juniors and progressed in 1933 to play in Kurri’s 1st grade team. In 1934, at the age of 21, Mick relocated and went to play for Quirindi 1st Grade in the area now classified as the Group 4 Rugby League competition. In 1935 he was chosen in a number of Country Regional Representative teams to eventually be selected in the New South Wales team to play 3 games against Queensland. Mick, at the age of 22, was then selected in the Australian team as a second to tour New Zealand from which he played 2 games, but no tests. In 1936 he joined Western Suburbs Magpies in the Sydney competition and was selected in the representative City Seconds Team to play Country Seconds and a Sydney Representative team. Early in this season he sustained a knee injury that eventually became a career-ending injury. In 1937 he relocated to play with South Newcastle in the Newcastle Rugby League competition. Mick, at the age of 26, eventually retired as a player in 1939. ==Post Playing Career== From 1940 to 1950 he continued his involvement with Rugby League in a coaching and development role for various periods of time at Belmont Rugby League (later to become Lakes United) and at the Cessnock Goannas. In 1951 he hosted, on radio station 2CK Cessnock, a Newcastle Rugby League Weekly Commentary and News Report. In 1972 Mick retired as an Engineer in the Coal Mining Industry and returned to live at Kurri Kurri where he was an active member and committeeman of the Kurri Kurri Bowling Club.

He had origins in the Lwów School of Mathematics and contributed to real analysis, probability and mathematical statistics. ==Family Background== Rajchman was born in Congress Poland, a province of the Russian Empire, in the family of assimilated Polish Jews known for contributions to the 20th-century Polish intellectual life. Although the family was partially converted into Roman Catholicism, his parents were agnostic. His father Aleksander Rajchman was a journalist specialized in theatre and music critique, who in the period 1882-1904 was the publisher and editor-in-chief of the artistic weekly Echo Muzyczne, Teatralne i Artystyczne and was co-founder and first director of the National Philharmonic in Warsaw in the years 1901-1904. Mother Melania Amelia Hirszfeld was a socialist and women's rights activist who wrote both critical essays and woman affairs' texts under pseudonyms or anonymously for a few Polish weeklies, organized maternal rallies where she drew attention to the need to improve the household to facilitate women's lives, and was an active member of the secret organization Women's Circle of Polish Crown and Lithuania, and later also the Association of Women's Equality in Warsaw. Rajchmans ran a social salon who hosted many Polish artists of their times, in particular Eliza Orzeszkowa, Maria Konopnicka, and Zenon Pietkiewicz. His older sister a Polish independence activist and historian of education Helena Radlińska was the founder of Polish social pedagogy, his older brother a physician and bacteriologist Ludwik Rajchman was the world leader in social medicine and director of the League of Nations Health Organization, the founder of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and its first Chairman in the years 1946-1950. His nephew a Polish-American electrical engineer Jan A. Rajchman was a computer pioneer who invented logic circuits for arithmetic and magnetic-core memory to result in development of high-speed computer memory systems and whose son John Rajchman is a noted American philosopher of art history, architecture, and continental philosophy. His first cousin a microbiologist and serologist Ludwik Hirszfeld co- discovered the heritability of ABO blood group type and foreseen the serological conflict between mother and child. ==Education and Research Work== After his father died in 1904, his mother migrated with rest of the family to Paris in 1909. Alexander studied there and obtained the licencié és sciences degree in 1910. He became a junior assistant at the University of Warsaw in 1919, whereas in 1921 he earned the doctoral degree at the John Casimir University of Lwów under Hugo Steinhaus and became a senior assistant at the University of Warsaw. Next in 1922 he became a professor at the University of Warsaw, and, after his habilitation in 1925, a lecturer there until outbreak of the World War II in 1939. In the 1930s, he was a visiting scholar to lecture at the Jacques Hadamard's seminar at the Collège de France. His research touched real analysis, probability and mathematical statistics, in particular focused on the Fourier series. Rajchman received significant results in the fields of trigonometric series, function of a real variable and probability. In mathematics, there are such concepts as the Rajchman global uniqueness theorem, Rajchman measures, Rajchman collection, Rajchman algebras, Rajchman sharpened law of large numbers, Rajchman theory of formal multiplication of trigonometric series, Rajchman inequalities, and Rajchman- Zygmund inequalities. Near a Rajchman measure, particularly important notion invented by Rajchman is a Rajchman algebra associated with a locally compact group which is defined to be the set of all elements of the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra which vanish at infinity, a closed and complemented ideal in the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra that contains the Fourier algebra. His first doctoral student a noted Polish mathematician Antoni Zygmund created the Chicago school of mathematical analysis with the emphasis onto harmonic analysis, which produced the 1966 Fields Medal winner Paul Cohen. His second doctoral student Zygmunt Zalcwasser, co-advised by Wacław Sierpiński, introduced the Zalcwasser rank to measure the uniform convergence of sequences of continuous functions on the unit interval. In October 2000, the Stefan Banach International Mathematical Center at the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences honoured Rajchman's achievements by the Rajchman-Zygmund-Marcinkiewicz Symposium. In April 1940 Gestapo arrested Rajchman as a Jew, he died in Oranienburg, Germany imprisoned by the Nazis in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp probably in July or August 1940. ==See Also== *List of Polish mathematicians ==References== * *Aleksander Rajchman from an article by Antoni Zygmund * * Category:Polish mathematicians Category:Scientists from Warsaw Category:People from Warsaw Governorate Category:People who died in Sachsenhausen concentration camp Category:Polish Jews who died in the Holocaust Category:1890 births Category:1940 deaths ","title":"Aleksander Rajchman"},{"id":"35221620","text":"Boustan is a Lebanese-Canadian fast food restaurant in Montreal, Quebec.

Toward the end of Later Liang's confrontation with its northern archenemy Later Tang, Wang was the only general who was able to achieve any measure of success against Later Tang forces, but then-reigning emperor Zhu Zhen, believing that he was difficult to control, replaced him with Duan Ning, whose overly ambitious counterattack plan allowed Later Tang's Emperor Zhuangzong to slip past him, defeat and capture Wang, and capture the Later Liang capital Daliang. After capture, Wang refused to submit to the Later Tang emperor and was executed. == Background == Wang Yanzhang was born in 863, during the reign of Emperor Yizong of Tang. He was from Shouzhang (壽張, in modern Liaocheng, Shandong). Neither his grandfather Wang Xiu () nor father Wang Qingzong () served as an official or a general. In his youth, Wang Yanzhang became a soldier under the command of the major warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor (Jiedushi) of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), and became known for his bravery and ferocity. He became well known for his use of a heavy iron spear, and gained the nickname of Wang Tieqiang for the use of the spear.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 32. == Service under Emperor Taizu of Later Liang == Because of Wang Yanzhang's abilities, he was promoted gradually in the ranks of Zhu Quanzhong's army and often served under Zhu in Zhu's campaigns. In 909, by which time Zhu had forced Tang's last emperor Emperor Ai (Emperor Yizong's grandson) to yield the throne to him and established Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu, Later Liang forces were attacking Later Liang's western rival Qi as the Qi general Liu Zhijun was attacking the Later Liang vassal Han Xun () the military governor of Shuofang Circuit (朔方, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia). The Later Liang forces, commanded by the general Kang Huaizhen (), fell into a trap that Qi forces laid for them, and it was said that they would have been completely annihilated had not for Wang's efforts in fighting to keep an escape path open.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. == Service under Zhu Yougui and Zhu Zhen == In 913, by which time Emperor Taizu had been assassinated by and succeeded by his son Zhu Yougui the Prince of Ying,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. Wang Yanzhang was made the prefect of Pu Prefecture (濮州, in modern Puyang, Henan), but remained in the main Later Liang imperial army as the commander of the forces from Pu Prefecture. In 914, by which time Zhu Yougui had committed suicide and been succeeded by his brother Zhu Youzhen the Prince of Jun (who soon changed his name to Zhu Zhen), Wang was made the prefect of Dan Prefecture (澶州, in modern Anyang, Henan) and created a count. In 915, Zhu Zhen, believing that Tianxiong Circuit (天雄, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) was an overly powerful circuit that had an independent tradition, decided to try to weaken it by diving its six prefectures into two circuits—with three of the prefectures becoming a new Zhaode Circuit (昭德, headquartered in modern Anyang). As part of the operations to divide it, in addition to sending the general He Delun () to be Tianxiong's new military governor and Zhang Yun () as Zhaode's military governor, to oversee the division, Zhu also sent a large part of the Later Liang imperial army north, commanded by the major general Liu Xun, claiming to be defending Tianxiong against Later Liang's northern rival Jin but instead intending to intimidate the Tianxiong forces. Wang was serving under Liu in this operation and was sent to Tianxiong's capital Wei Prefecture () with 500 men in advance of Liu's own arrival there. The Tianxiong soldiers, resentful and fearful of the division, soon mutinied and put He Delun under house arrest; they also surrounded Jinbo Pavilion (), where Wang's troops were stationed at the time, but Wang was able to fight his way out of the city. The Tianxiong mutineers subsequently surrendered the circuit to Jin, and Jin's prince Li Cunxu arrived to take over the circuit, defeating subsequent Later Liang attempts to recapture it. During the campaign, Dan Prefecture fell to Jin forces, and Wang's wife and children were taken captive.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. The Jin forces initially treated them well and took them to the Jin capital Taiyuan, and sent a secret messenger to Wang, trying to persuade him to turn to the Jin cause. Wang killed the secret messenger and refused to respond; as a result, several years later, Jin had his wife and children executed. In 916, Wang was promoted to be the defender (防禦使, Fangyushi) of Zheng Prefecture (鄭州, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan), but remained in the Later Liang imperial army. In 917, he was given the title of acting Taifu (). Around the new year 919, Wang, then under the command of He Gui, participated in a major confrontation between Later Liang and Jin forces at Huliu Slope (胡柳陂, in modern Heze, Shandong). It was said that it was Wang's initial suffering of some losses that led to a chain reaction that caused massive losses (two thirds) for both armies—when Wang was retreating, part of the Jin army misread Wang's movement as a retreat by their own army, and collapsed, although a subsequent Jin counterattack also inflicted great losses on the Later Liang army. It was said that in the aftermaths of the battle, fleeing soldiers from both Wang's army and the Jin army found their way to the Later Liang capital Daliang, causing much panic in the city that the Jin army was approaching, although the panic soon subsided.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. In 919, Wang was made the acting military governor of Kuangguo Circuit (匡國, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan), but continued to serve as a general in the imperial army. In 920, he was made full military governor and created a marquess. Soon after, he was made the deputy commander of the armies in the north (i.e., the armies defending against Jin) under Dai Siyuan. In spring 921, he was transferred from Kuangguo to Xuanyi Circuit (宣義, headquartered in modern Anyang). Later in 921, Zhu Zhen's cousin Zhu Youneng () the Prince of Hui, who was then the prefect of Chen Prefecture (陳州, in modern Zhoukou, Henan), rebelled and headed for Daliang. Zhu Zhen sent Wang, along with Huo Yanwei and Zhang Hanjie (), to intercept Zhu Youneng. They defeated him, who fled back to Chen Prefecture. They then put the city under siege. He surrendered, and Zhu Zhen, while sparing his life, demoted him and put him under arrest.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271.  Events of 923  In spring 923, Li Cunxu, then at Wei Prefecture, declared himself emperor of a new Later Tang (as Emperor Zhuangzong), effectively claiming to be the legitimate successor to Tang. Shortly after, he had his general Li Siyuan launch a surprise attack across the Yellow River on Later Liang's Tianping Circuit (天平, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), capturing it. The fall of Tianping's capital Yun Prefecture () left few defenses between it and Daliang, causing great panic at Daliang. Zhu Zhen relieved Dai Siyuan of his command for failing to anticipate the attack, and, at the urging of the senior chancellor Jing Xiang, named Wang Yanzhang to replace Dai, with Duan Ning serving as his deputy. After being commissioned, Wang immediately attacked the Later Tang-held city of Desheng (德勝, in modern Puyang)—which was divided into two parts by the Yellow River. He destroyed the bridge between the two parts so that the Later Tang forces to the north could not reinforce the southern city, and then captured the southern city and killed thousands of Later Tang soldiers, dealing a big blow to the Later Tang morale. He then prepared to attack Yangliu (楊劉, in modern Liaocheng), the ford on the Yellow River that was allowing the Later Tang forces to the north of the River to maintain communication and supply lines open to Yun Prefecture, in order to trap Li Siyuan at Yun. Both armies tore down the Desheng buildings to use as rafts, and as they headed down the river, they battled intensely on the river. When he arrived at Yangliu, he laid siege to it, nearly capturing it several times, but the city's defenses eventually held under the defense by the Later Tang general Li Zhou (). When Later Tang soon built a second fort at Majiakou (馬家口, also in modern Liaocheng) to allow a second passageway to Yun, Wang attacked it but could not defeat the Later Tang emperor, who was defending the fort himself, Wang was forced to withdraw. It was said that throughout these battles, however, Wang was being undermined inside the Later Liang army itself. He had long resented what he saw as the corrupting influence that Zhu Zhen's brother-in-law Zhao Yan and four brothers/cousins of Zhu Zhen's deceased wife Consort Zhang (including Zhang Hanjie, who was her brother), and had told people, \\"After I victoriously return, I will kill all the wicked men on the behalf of the people of the empire.\\" His hatred of them eventually was discovered by Zhao and the Zhangs. Further, Duan was jealous of Wang and wanted to be the commander himself, and therefore formed an alliance with Zhao and the Zhangs, and it was said that Wang's military campaign was much hampered by this group of internal enemies. After his forced withdrawal from Majiakou, Zhu Zhen believed the false accusations against Wang and relieved him of his command of the main Later Liang army, instead ordering him to rendezvous with Dong Zhang to attack Ze Prefecture (澤州, in modern Jincheng, Shanxi). Zhu Zhen replaced him with Duan, despite the oppositions of senior officials Jing, Li Zhen, and Zhang Zongshi. Soon thereafter, Wang was recalled back from the Ze front and instead ordered to attack Yun Prefecture to recapture it, with Zhang Hanjie serving as the monitor of his army, as part of a four-prong counterattack against Later Tang that Duan was envisioning—having Dong attack northwest toward Taiyuan, having Huo attack north toward Zhending (真定, in modern Baoding, Hebei), having Wang attack northeast toward Yun, and having Duan himself attack the Later Tang emperor directly near Desheng. This four-prong plan was revealed to the Later Tang emperor, however, when the Later Liang officer Kang Yanxiao defected to Later Tang. Kang also revealed that the main strength was with Duan, who had by that point crossed the Yellow River and headed toward what he believed to be the Later Tang main army. The Later Tang emperor decided to risk opening up his rear by heading immediately to Yun to rendezvous with Li Siyuan, bypassing the Later Liang main army, and attack Daliang directly. Just as the Later Liang army was about to put the four-prong plan into effect, the Later Tang emperor arrived at Yun Prefecture and advanced toward Daliang, with Li Siyuan as his forward commander. They encountered and surprised Wang, who was forced to retreat to the poorly- fortified city of Zhongdu (中都, in modern Jining, Shandong). The Later Tang forces quickly breached its defenses, and Wang tried to flee, but as he did, the Later Tang general Xia Luqi (), who had served in the Later Liang army before with Wang, recognized him and speared him. Wang was seriously injured and captured, along with Zhang and most of his army. The Later Tang emperor, impressed with Wang, initially wanted to spare his life and get him to submit. Wang repeatedly refused, however, stating that he was a faithful Later Liang subject who would never serve Later Tang. When the Later Tang emperor sent Li Siyuan to also try to persuade him, he insulted Li Siyuan by referring to Li Siyuan by nickname. When the Later Tang forces, after a short rest, was getting ready to march on Daliang, Wang still tried to prevent its advance by falsely stating to the Later Tang emperor that Duan's army (which in reality was trapped north of the Yellow River and would not be able to come to Daliang's aid) was on its way, the Later Tang emperor executed him. Shortly after, the Later Tang forces captured Daliang; Zhu Zhen committed suicide, and Later Liang was at its end. == Notes and references == * History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 21. * New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 32. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 267, 269, 270, 271, 272.

He shot an adult female, describing it the following year in The Emu as a new species, Sphenura litoralis. It was last reliably recorded in 1908 when a specimen was again collected. Since then there have been some unconfirmed sightings, which are not considered to be accurate, and the taxon is listed as extinct under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The reason for its extinction is thought to be the destruction of its shrubland habitat which was repeatedly burnt in the early 20th century to create pasture. ==Distribution and habitat== The bristlebird had a very restricted range, being found only in a stretch of coastal scrub about 50 km long between Cape Naturaliste and Cape Mentelle in south-western Australia. There it inhabited dense, stunted shrubland on cliffs and dunes. ==Description== The bristlebird was a thrush-like, largely terrestrial bird, with short, rounded wings, about 25–27 cm long. It had a rich rufous cap, extending to the ear-coverts, with an off-white face and a boldly scalloped, grey-white chin, throat and breast. It had a reddish-brown hindneck, back, uppertail and scapulars, becoming olive brown on the lower back and rump. It had brown upperwings and mainly grey underparts. Its bill was grey-black, paling to grey or pink on the lower mandible. It had red eyes and brown legs and feet. ==Behaviour== Milligan wrote of the holotype specimen: > ”The bird was most difficult to flush or even see, and it was only in the > afternoon of the second day’s pursuit that I obtained a momentary glimpse of > it as it rushed across a kwagga (species of Wallaby) track in the scrub with > its tail elevated. My next sight of it was on the fourth day of pursuit, > just prior to shooting it, when my old Quail bitch disturbed it. Its motion > on this occasion (perhaps due to its being severely pressed) was distinctly > different from that observed on the former. Appearing, as it did, running at > top speed across one of those beautifully rounded sand hills (which abound > on the coasts), with its tail depressed below the plane of the body, and its > dwarf rounded wings used as an aid to its running, its toes just touching > the ground, and its neck stretched to the utmost, the bird reminded me very > much of the action of the Lyre Bird in similar circumstances.” Feeding Milligan found that the stomach contents of his specimen consisted wholly of land snails. Voice Milligan reported that the bristlebird had two distinct calls, an alarm call pink-pink-pink and a series of clear thrush-like notes. ==References== western rufous bristlebird Category:Endemic birds of Southwest Australia Category:Bird extinctions since 1500 western rufous bristlebird ","title":"Western rufous bristlebird"},{"id":"35221754","text":"The 1917–18 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team represented the University of Michigan in intercollegiate basketball during the 1917–18 season. The team was Michigan's second varsity basketball team and the first after an eight-year hiatus following the 1908–09 season. With no experienced collegiate players to draw from, the squad started from scratch and compiled a record of 6–12. They finished last in the Big Ten Conference with a record of 0–10 against conference opponents, the only winless conference season in Michigan history. Elmer Mitchell, a 28-year-old graduate of the University of Michigan, served as the coach. He returned to Michigan in 1917 after having held positions as the athletic director at Grand Rapids Union High School from 1912 to 1915 and at Michigan State Normal College (now known as Eastern Michigan University) from 1915 to 1917. After a difficult start in the 1917–18 season, Mitchell led the team to a 12-game turnaround with a 16–8 record in the 1918–19 season. In 1919, Mitchell established the intramural sports program at Michigan and served as its director. Alan W. Boyd was the team captain.1918 Michiganensian, page 301.

Timothy Hewlett led in scoring average with 7.0 points per game (22 field goals and 12 free throws in eight games). ==Schedule== { width=\\"650\\" - align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:yellow;color:blue;\\"  DateOpponent  Score  Result  Location - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" December 15, 1917Case27–25LossCleveland, OH - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" January 1, 1918Camp Custer44–28WinWaterman Gymnasium, Ann Arbor, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" January 4, 1918Hope College31–15WinWaterman Gymnasium, Ann Arbor, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" January 5, 1918Case24–20Win Waterman Gymnasium, Ann Arbor, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" January 11, 1918Michigan Agricultural College17–13WinWaterman Gymnasium, Ann Arbor, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" January 18, 1918Indiana21–17LossWaterman Gymnasium, Ann Arbor, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" January 19, 1918Chicago22–6LossBartlett Gymnasium, Chicago, IL - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" January 21, 1918Ohio State37–7LossOhio State Armory, Columbus, OH - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" January 25, 1918Minnesota28–13LossWaterman Gymnasium, Ann Arbor, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" January 26, 1918Northwestern21–11LossWaterman Gymnasium, Ann Arbor, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" February 11, 1918Great Lakes Jackies34–27LossWaterman Gymnasium, Ann Arbor, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" February 13, 1918Kalamazoo College42–8WinWaterman Gymnasium, Ann Arbor, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" February 16, 1918Minnesota49–10LossUniversity of Minnesota Armory, Minneapolis, MN - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" February 22, 1918Indiana21–20LossMen's Gymnasium, Bloomington, IN - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" February 23, 1918Northwestern18–14LossPatten Gymnasium, Evanston, IL - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" March 1, 1918Chicago22–15LossWaterman Gymnasium, Ann Arbor, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" March 2, 1918Michigan Agricultural College31–25WinMichigan State University Armory, East Lansing, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" March 9, 1918Ohio State34–27LossWaterman Gymnasium, Ann Arbor, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" } ==Pre-season== In early December 1917, the Detroit Free Press wrote that basketball \\"receives its inception as a major league sport at Michigan this year.\\" The Free Press noted that the game had never been played \\"on a big scale\\" in Ann Arbor, and Coach Mitchell had been unable to find experienced players for the team. As a result, the paper opined that Mitchell \\"will have his hands full putting any sort of a team on the floor.\\" Coach Mitchell was also the coach of Michigan's freshman football team and was unable to turn his attention to the basketball team until football season had ended. With his ties to the football team, Mitchell recruited several football players to try out for the basketball team, including Alan Boyd, Abe Cohn, Tad Wieman, Richard Weske, Oscar Cartright, William Cruse, and Angus Goetz. Boyd became the team captain, and Cohn was a reserve on Mitchell's team. During late November and early December, Mitchell held scrimmages to identify the best players. Searching for players with some level of experience, Mitchell looked to the class and fraternity teams. James McClintock, who had played center on the sophomore class team, stood out in the early practices. So, too, did Ralph Rychener who had played forward on the championship team of the fraternity-boarding house league. In the days leading up to the season opener, Mitchell culled the team to 12 players and put them through strenuous conditioning workouts each night as well as passing and shooting drills. ==Regular season== Michigan opened its season on December 15, 1917, with a road game in Cleveland against Case Scientific School. Case had a veteran team that had won the Ohio Conference basketball championship the prior year, and the Wolverines lost the game, 27–25. The Wolverines' performance was hindered by the team's lack of experience, and also by difficulty adjusting to the basketball court in the Case gymnasium, which was much smaller than the court the team had become accustomed to at the Waterman Gymnasium in Ann Arbor. The Wolverines did not play any further games in December. In late December, the Detroit Free Press noted that three home games set for the first week of January were \\"expected to arouse interest in the basketball team, a thing which has been noticeable by its absence ever since the practice season started, over a month ago.\\" Coach Mitchell expressed concern that the lack of interest and backing had lowered the spirit of the team. Over the holidays, the university renovated the basketball court at Waterman Gymnasium. The court was modified to run lengthwise in order to create a larger playing floor, and backboards were hung from the rafters. The Detroit Free Press wrote that the new court \\"will be one of the largest and best in the state when it is finished.\\" After a two-week break over the holidays, Michigan won four consecutive home games against the Camp Custer officers' team that featured several former college stars (44–28), Hope College (31–15), Case (24–20), and Michigan Agricultural College (now known as Michigan State University) (17–13), improving its record to 4–1. After the first three victories, the Detroit Free Press wrote that Michigan's basketball team had begun playing together as a team, had started \\"passing with a vengeance\\", and was \\"improving rapidly in every department of the game and rapidly rounding into a first class organization.\\" At the same time, the paper expressed concern over the team's defense and uncertainty as to how the team would hold up against tougher Big Ten opponents. Michigan played its first Big Ten Conference basketball game at Waterman Gymnasium on January 18, 1918, against Indiana. The Hoosiers defeated the Wolverines, 21–17. With a respectable showing against Indiana, the Detroit Free Press wrote that the team's followers were confident that \\"fighting spirit\\" would carry the team to a good record. The Free Press noted that, although the players had been \\"shooting and passing wildly\\", they had made up for their lack of experience with \\"plenty of fight\\". Over the next eight days, Michigan played four more games against Big Ten opponents and lost each game: Chicago (22-6), Ohio State (39-7), Minnesota (28-13), and Northwestern (21-11). After the January 26 game against the Northwestern, the team had a two-week, mid-season break. Over the break, Coach Mitchell made several changes in his lineup. He announced that, for the remaining games, he would play Rychener and McClintock at forward, Bartz at center, and Emery and Boyd at the guard positions. The Detroit Free Press opined in early February that a lack of confidence had caused the players to \\"miss many easy shots, gum up passes, and lose their heads at a critical moment.\\" After the break, the team lost to the Great Lakes Jackies to extend the team's losing streak to six games. The losing streak, which began against Indiana on January 18, 1918, and continued through the Great Lakes game on February 11, 1918, was a school record that was not broken for 26 years. The team broke its losing streak with a 42–8 victory over Kalamazoo College on February 13, 1918. Three consecutive losses followed against Minnesota (49–10), Indiana (21–20), and Chicago (22–15). The Wolverines then completed a season sweep of Michigan Agricultural College, winning by a score of 31 to 25 in East Lansing.1918 Michiganensian, page 304. The Wolverines concluded the season with a 34–27 loss to Ohio State on March 9, 1918. ==Critical assessment of the first season== The Michigan Alumnus summarized the season as follows: \\"Although the standing of the Michigan basketball team in the Conference is not a thing to be proud of, there can be few objections to the basketball team that Mitchell was able to turn out in the first year of the sport here. At the beginning of the season there was only one experienced man, Hanish, on hand, and Hanish left before the end of the first semester. Bartz and Rowley, good players, were also forced out of the game, the latter from injuries and the former from poor scholastic work.\\" The 1918 Michiganensian wrote: > \\"Though failing to win a single Conference game, and suffering defeats in 12 > of 18 games played, Michigan's first Varsity basketball team did not have > such an unsuccessful season as the records would seem to indicate. The > Wolverines started the year without an experienced player on hand and Coach > Mitchell was not only forced to build a new team -- he was also obligated to > get that team into such condition that it could face the best fives in the > Big Ten. . .

Mitchell worked hard to get a > winning combination, but succeeded mostly in preparing his men for next > year.\\"1918 Michiganensian, page 302.1918 Michiganensian, page 303. The Detroit Free Press summed up Michigan's first season of varsity basketball with this headline: \\"Wolverines' Court Year Not in Vain: Much Has Been Accomplished by Coach Mitchell and His Proteges for First Season.\\" The Free Press emphasized that Coach Mitchell began the season without a single experienced player, noted that the team had \\"gained greatly\\" in experience and form, and concluded that expectations had been too high among the fans in Ann Arbor: > \\"At the start of the basketball year there was little hope held out for a > Michigan triumph in the indoor game. The campus, not quite understanding the > nature of the competition Michigan had to face, hoped for bigger things than > lay within the realms of possibility. But, when the situation was once made > clear, the students supported the team, despite its losses, and have been > quite enthusiastic over its development.\\" ==Post-season awards== At the end of the season, six players were awarded varsity \\"M\\" letters for their participation on the 1917-18 men's basketball team: Alan W. Boyd, John H. Emery, Timothy Y. Hewlitt, James I. McClintock, Ralph O. Rychener, and Edward E. Ruzicka. Two players were given aMA letters: Nicholas B. Bartz and Samuel C. Bornstein. Three players were given \\"R\\" letters as reserves: Cress, Rowley, and Cohn. In early April 1918, the six players who won \\"M's\\" met and selected \\"Doc\\" Emery to serve as captain of the 1918-19 team. ==Players== Coach Elmer Mitchell. *Nicholas B.

He died while in the custody due to severe torture according to the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry. He was the second professional media worker to be killed during the Bahraini uprising, and one of three journalists killed in total. ==Personal== Karim Fakhrawi co-founded Al-Wasat in 2002, the only independent newspaper in Bahrain which was in the process of being banned by the Bahraini government for \\"trying to harm Bahrain's stability and security and disseminating false information that undermined the country’s international image and reputation\\". He was also member of the opposition group Al-Wefaq. Karim Fakhrawi was a Shi'ite Muslim of Persian origin (Ajam) who lived in Manama. ==Career== Karim Fakhrawi was a businessman and founder of Bahrain's first educational bookstore. The bookstore had expanded into a publishing house and acted as the main supplier of books to the University of Bahrain. He owned the construction company that built the Iraqi Embassy in Bahrain. Fakhrawi was also one of the main founders of popular independent newspaper, Al Wasat. Al-Wasat has won multiple awards, such as the UNICEF regional award for electronic media, and it is the 15th strongest MENA newspaper on the internet, according to Forbes Middle East. Fakhrawi was a local book publisher, as well as owner of one of the biggest bookstores in Bahrain. He was a member of Al-Wefaq, the largest opposition political party in Bahrain. ==Death== The uprising has largely centered around the Manama area where Fakhrawi lived, worked, and died. Fakhrawi was taken into custody April 5, 2011 when he was going to complain that police were threatening to demolish his home. He was accused of \\"deliberate news fabrication and falsification\\" by the Bahraini authorities, and the government also said it would file charges against three employees as well as deporting two others. Fakhrawi was in police custody for one week before his death and was one of many who died while in the custody of the local police. Bahraini police told the media that Karim died of kidney failure, but photos later leaked revealing bruises and indicating torture and police brutality. The evidence was discovered in the process of burial, when his clothes were removed and his torture marks were documented and released. The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI) stated, \\"The death of Abdulkarim Ali Ahmed Fakhrawi occurred at the BDF Hospital after he had been transferred from the custody of the NSA. The NSA conducted an investigation into the physical abuse of Mr Fakhrawi but not into his death. The NSA investigation resulted in the prosecution of two individuals for physical abuse. The Commission considers that the NSA failed to conduct an effective investigation into Mr Fakhrawi's death, which would satisfy the relevant obligations under international law.\\" It goes on to say \\"The Commission concludes that the death of Mr Fakhrawi is attributed to torture while in the custody of the NSA.\\" ==Context== In February 2011, the people of Bahrain started to protest in a wave known as the Arab Spring. The nationwide uprising in Bahrain is between the majority Shi'ite Muslims and some Sunni Muslims against the minority Sunni government. Since February 15, 2011, more than 80 anti-government protesters there have died, including four protesters that were in police custody at the time of their deaths. The anti-government political party, Al-Wefaq has listed 453 protesters as apprehended, but a spokesperson for the group thinks the number is up towards 600 people arrested by the government. ==Impact== Zakariya Rashid Hassan al-Ashiri was the first to die in the uprising. Fakhrawi was the second journalist and the fourth person to die in government custody. In response to the two journalists who died, Irina Bokova, who was the director-general of UNESCO, called for an investigation looking into the death. One year later, Ahmed Ismail Hassan, who was a citizen journalist uploading videos, was shot while taking videos of a protest and died. ==Reactions== Fakhrawi's body was taken to the Hoora district to be buried when his clothes were removed for cleansing and his torture marks discovered. Videos and pictures documenting his wounds from torture were posted to the internet. ==References== Category:1962 births Category:2011 deaths Category:2011 in Bahrain Category:Bahraini journalists Category:Bahraini people of Iranian descent Category:Journalists killed while covering the Arab Spring Category:Bahraini torture victims Category:Deaths during the Bahraini uprising of 2011 Category:Journalists killed in Bahrain] ","title":"Karim Fakhrawi"},{"id":"35222248","text":"The Divine Legation of Moses is the best-known work of William Warburton, an English theologian of the 18th century who became bishop of Gloucester. As its full title makes clear, it is a conservative defence of orthodox Christian belief against deism, by means of an apparent paradox: the afterlife is not mentioned in terms in the Pentateuch (i.e. Torah – see Jewish eschatology), making Mosaic Judaism distinctive among ancient religions; from which, Warburton argues, it is seen that Moses received a divine revelation. The Divine Legation was published in two parts and nine books from 1738 by Warburton, who left it unfinished, however. It is a learned and discursive work, and excited extensive controversy in Warburton's lifetime, which the author pursued with acrimony. One side-issue, the history of writing, was treated by Warburton in a manner that proved influential.

The Attingal Outbreak is often regarded as the first organized revolt against British authority in Malabar, Cochin and Travancore. The main reasons behind the resentment was large scale corruption and the manipulation of black pepper prices by the Company. The chief factor at the Anjengo factor, Gyfford refused to hand over the customary gifts meant for the Rani of Attingal to the agents of the local feudal lords (Pillamar) and tried to hand them directly to the Rani at the head of a force of 140 soldiers on 15 April 1721. This show of force had the opposite effect and the local people rebelled, attacked and destroyed the entire force and then laid siege to the fort. Gunnar Ince led the defence of the fort for six months till the arrival of the Company's troops from the English controlled Tellicherry. Following the turn of events, the Company and the Rani of Attingal entered into an agreement under which; * the Company was compensated for all losses sustained during the attack on Anjengo * was also given the sole monopoly of trade in pepper * the right to erect factories in places of its choice == Details == The Attingal revolt of 1721 was the first organised uprising against the English East India Company in Kerala. But, there is an opinion among a group of historians that the revolt took place with the prior permission of the queen. Whatever it may be, it is an indisputable fact that local people hated Gyffort. The British used to send to the Queen costly gifts from the Fort of Anjengo annually. In 1721, around 140 Britons started their journey from Anjengo to the palace of Attingal. In the meanwhile, the Pillamars, the local rulers, demanded that the gifts were to be presented to the Queen through them only. But Gyffort was not ready to accept it. The people became furious and they attacked and killed the Britons. Then the local people laid siege to the fort and it was said that the siege continued for about 6 months. The English troops from the Fort of Tellichery came to Anjengo and suppressed the revolt. The Company completed the completion of the fort at Anjengo in 1695. NB: For more details- \\"Early Resistance to Colonialism in South Kerala\\"- Leela More and \\"Maritime Malabar and the Europeans\\" edited by K.S Mathew. [Old View of Pondichery ] Marthanda Varma became the King of Travancore (Venad) When the English strengthened in the south of Kerala in the north the French had already stepped in. At last what the Dutch feared happened. In 1725 the French forces, under the orders of the Govt: of Pondichery seized Mayyazhy of Kadathanadu located at a little distance away from Tellichery and rechristened it as Mahi. During the revolt of Attingal, it was Adhitya Varma who ruled over Venad. After his death, Rama Varma (1721–29) became the king. It was during this tumultus period that the King of Venad signed a treaty with the English East India Company. The treaty, aimed at suppressing the insurrection of Yogakkar and Pillamar, gave the English the permission to construct a fort at Kulachal The Battle of Kulachal was fought on 10 August 1741 [O.S. 31 July 1741] between forces of the Indian kingdom of Travancore and the Dutch East India Company, during the Travancore- Dutch War. The treaty was signed by the heir-apparent Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma for and on behalf of the king reaching at the fort of Anjengo. Sharp witted and steel-hearted the heir-apparent was for making use of any means, fair or foul, to suppress insurrection of the Yogakkars and the Pillamars. It was because of his advice that Rama Varma, the King, signed the treaty with the British in 1729. After his death, Marthanda Varma became the King of Travancore (Venad) and there began an era in the history of Kerala. It was a period of intense internal conflicts in south Kerala and mid-Kerala when Marthanda Varma was enthroned in 1729 in Travancore (Venad). He had to confront the opposition of chieftains besides the disputations of right of succession among the members of the royal family. Because of internal conflicts he could not, initially, rule over the kingdom. The king, who spent his life in hiding or in the open met at different times face to face with death. He saved his life either in disguise or keeping his eyes peeled for the enemies. But the Dutch commander Stein Van Gollenesse recorded that Marthanda Varma was a cruel, audacious, greedy, unkind but efficient person who wanted to rule the entire Kerala. This opinion may be true when we compare his deeds later. His mind was harder than steel. To achieve his aims he did not take in to consideration moral obligation and not ready to examine kindness and truth. He started confronting the enemies by creating an armed force of his own and by procuring gunpowder and war equipment with the help of the British at Anjengo. He tightened his grip on the administration by brutally suppressing the revolt in the royal family by murdering his own kin and by killing mercilessly the Madambis and Pillamars. He confiscated the properties of Madambis and Pillamars and brought all of them under the control of the Government. This ultimately led to the collapse of the feudal system that existed in Travancore kingdom. His advancement became a threat to the neighbouring countries. The Dutch were also in confusion. He was going to attack the countries with which they had trade of pepper or other goods. == References == * A Survey Of Kerala History, A Sreedhara Menon, D C Books, 2007; , , 368 pages.

Chang was unopposed for the primary election and received 597 (77.5%) votes. In the general election on November 2, 2010, Chang lost to incumbent Democrat Karl Rhoads by 3,203 (52.3%) to 2,636 (43%) votes. On September 23, 2010, Lynne Matusow and Anthony Chang filed a lawsuit against Scott Nago, In His Official Capacity as Chief Election Officer of the State of Hawaii Office of Elections, and Chang alleging that Chang was not a resident of the 28th Representative District at the time he filed papers to run and therefore should be disqualified from the November 2010 general election.Matusow v. Nago, 1CC10-1-2035 (Hawaii Circuit Court 2010) A similar challenge to the Office of Elections in August 2010 had failed. On December 7, 2010, after the general election, the court granted the defendants' motion summary judgment and subsequently granted judgment in favor of Nago and Chang. Tenure as State Chair of the Hawaii Republican Party On November 5, 2011, in an uncontested election, Chang was unanimously elected by the Republican party's state committee to the unpaid position of State Party Chair of the Hawaii Republican Party, to fill the remainder of the 2011-2013 term previously held by Jonah Kaauwai. The party's state committee is made up of 51 elected House District chairpersons, 4 county chairs, executive committee members and Republican leaders in the Hawaii State House and Senate. At the time, Chang was 31 years old, making him the youngest person in the country to ever to assume the position of state party chair. In an email message to State Committee members prior to the election, Chang wrote \\"As chair, I will devote my efforts to growing our membership, raising funds for the party and our candidates, and recruiting strong candidates for 2012.\\" However, his 2011-2014 tenure as State Party Chair was marked with decreased monetary contributions to the Hawaii Republican Party, a decrease in Republican candidates to legislative seats, and the net loss of one Republican seat in the legislature. Under Chang, total contributions to the Hawaii Republican party decreased nearly in half from $1,116,426.98 in the previous two-year period (January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2010) to $575,537.63 during the January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012, period. Contributions also fell again for the January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2014, period to $518,386.10. Under Chang, Republicans failed to field candidates for more legislative races than the previous election. In 2010, under the previous chair, Republicans fielded candidates in 63 of the total 66 (95%) races for state Senate and House of Representative seats. In 2012, under Chang, Republicans fielded candidates in 49 of the total 71 (64%) races for state Senate and House of Representative seats. For the 2012 general election, two incumbent Republicans (George Fontaine and Corinne Ching) lost elections to Democrats and one Republican, his then-wife Beth Fukumoto, defeated an incumbent Democrat, for a net loss of one state House of Representatives seat. The number of Republicans in the state Senate did not change due to the 2012 election. Federal races for the United States Senate and House of Representatives were unsuccessful. Republican candidate Linda Lingle received 160,994 votes (36.8%) in her loss to Democrat Mazie Hirono's 269,489 (61.6%) votes for United States Senator This result contrasted with the 2002 Hawaii Governor election where Lingle defeated Hirono by 197,009 (51.6%) to 179,647 (46.6%) votes. Democrat Colleen Hanabusa also defeated former congressman Republican Charles Djou by 116,505 (53.5%) to 96,824 (44.4%) votes and Democrat Tulsi Gabbard defeated Republican Kawika Crowley 168,503 (76.8%) to 40,707 (18.6%) votes in the two races for United States Representative for Hawaii.

In March 2014, before the end of his 2013-2015 term, Chang stepped down as Chair citing his desire to concentrate on his military and business commitments.

Situated in Caboolture, Queensland, it opened in 1986. Displaying a unique collection of tools, weapons, pottery, ornaments, furniture and other artefacts, the Abbey collection spans through prehistoric hunters; the age of bronze and gold; great civilisations of Egypt, Mesopotamia and Greece; the Roman Empire; medieval knights, plagues and illuminated manuscripts; Renaissance Europe; and art from India and the Far East. The museum is the heir to the collections of the Abbey Folk Park (1934–1945) at Park Road, New Barnet; Great Britain's first open-air Folk Museum, and has been recognised as a nationally significant heritage collection. == Historical background == Replica Neolithic pit dwelling at Abbey Folk Park The museum has its roots in the Abbey Folk Park which was established by Rev. John S.M. Ward (1885–1949) at Barnet, north of London, in 1934. Antiquarian, author, educator, mystic and spiritualist, Ward's museum was for its time, as unconventional as its founder. Rejecting the traditional model of the museum and influenced by the Skansen Folk Museum in Sweden, Ward opted to display artefacts in sympathetic surroundings. Dubbed by the press \\"The man who collects houses\\" Ward saved several historical buildings from destruction and had them rebuilt on the site at New Barnet, which was also home to the Confraternity of the Kingdom of Christ, a religious community that he founded in 1929. To display his substantial collection of prehistoric artefacts Ward constructed a replica Bronze Age village, becoming in the process a pioneer of experimental archaeology and 'open air' museums. When it was forced to close in 1940 at the height of the London Blitz, the Abbey Folk Park housed 30 relocated historic buildings, replicas of ancient structures and a collection of more than 40 000 artefacts. In 1945 the museum buildings and the bulk of the collections were reluctantly sold to finance the migration of Ward and many members of his community to Cyprus where he died in 1949. The escalation of violence as the predominant Greek population sought Enosis, Union with Greece, from the British, forced the community to relocate again, arriving in Australia in 1956 and eventually settling in Caboolture, Queensland, in 1965. In 1978 it was decided to make the remaining collection available to the public and a museum board was formed appointing Michael Strong (M.A. Archaeology & Heritage) as director of the Abbey Museum of Art and Archaeology. With the securing of government assistance and public sector donations and with the technical assistance from a number of institutions the construction of the new museum was started in 1983. In June 1986 the Abbey Museum of Art and Archaeology was officially opened in its present building. In 1999 the next stage of the museum, a manuscript gallery was opened, named in honour of Professor Richard Stephens who served as board chairman from 1993–2003. == Collections == The scope and range of the Abbey collections makes it unique amongst Australian museums, spanning 500,000 years of human history across numerous cultures and civilisations ranging from Palaeolithic stone tools to Renaissance paintings. The nearby Abbey Church houses a significant collection of stained glass dating from the Middle Ages through to the Arts and Crafts Movement. Highlights of the collection include an ancient Egyptian death mask, Medieval and Renaissance stained glass, Italian and Flemish Old Master paintings from the 14th to the 18th centuries, Greek, Turkish and Russian icons, pottery, weapons and cult objects from the Bronze and Iron Ages, Roman glassware, a 17th-century Mughal Qur'an, samurai armour and weapons, medieval manuscripts. The Museum carries on an active research program in consultation with international scholars and museums such as the British Museum, the Middlealdercentert in Denmark and others. == Governance and philosophy == The museum defines itself as a \\"public museum of international standard\\" with a commitment to \\"telling the human evolutionary story impartially without bias of politics, religion or gender\\". It is administered by the Abbey Museum Association through a Board of Management which appoints a director and CEO. == References  External links == * Category:Museums in Queensland Category:Museums established in 1986 Category:Archaeological museums in Australia ","title":"Abbey Museum of Art and Archaeology"},{"id":"35222610","text":"Parachute Nurse is a 1942 Columbia Pictures film about the Aerial Nurse Corps. The film was directed by Charles Barton. ==Plot== Inspired by a visit from their old friend Lieutenant Mullins, an officer in the Aerial Nurse Corps, nurses Glenda White and Dottie Morrison decide to enlist in the Paranurses, an elite unit of nurses that parachute into hard-to-reach areas to aid injured soldiers. At the training center, Glenda and Dottie are assigned to the squad led by Captain Jane Morgan. At the cantina, the two nurses befriend Gretchen Ernst, a cadet who is being ostracized because her brother is an officer in the German army. Lieutenant Jim Woods is assigned to teach the recruits the proper jumping procedure, and after a day of diving off the platform, they are bruised and sore. Granted a pass for the evening, Glenda and Dottie hitch a ride on a truck bound for town and discover that Woods and Sergeant Jeff Peters are also passengers on the truck. The four dine together and by evening's end, Glenda has paired off with Woods and Jeff and Dottie have become a couple. When they return to the base, Helen Ames, another recruit, accuses Glenda of trying to steal the lieutenant from her. One of the cadets' first next lessons is in how to pack a parachute. When Woods announces that he plans to test Glenda's chute on the demonstration dummy, Helen ties a knot in the lines. When the lines foul as the chute opens, Woods blames Glenda for packing it incorrectly and orders her to spend three days packing and unpacking parachutes. Suspecting foul play, Dottie tells Jeff that she thinks someone deliberately tied a knot in Glenda's chute. Grateful for Glenda's sympathy, Gretchen offers to help her pack the chutes, and when they finish, the two women go to a dance, where Gretchen is once again snubbed. When Woods asks Glenda for a dance, she angrily tells him off and returns to the barracks. On the day of Gretchen's first jump, Glenda presents her with a good luck charm. When Gretchen jumps, however, she fails to pull the cord and falls to her death. After witnessing her friend's demise, Glenda becomes hysterical and is hospitalized. She recovers just in time to join her squadron for their first jump, but when the moment comes for Glenda to parachute from the plane, she freezes in terror. Delighted by Glenda's failure, Helen calls her \\"yellow.\\" Learning of Helen's vicious behavior, Capt. Morgan forces her to resign from the force. After Glenda refuses a second chance to accomplish her jump, she is transferred to the ambulance corps. As she prepares to leave the barracks, she overhears Jeff tell Dottie that Woods's plane has crashed in a remote area and that a nurse must parachute in to aid the injured officer. Begging Capt. Morgan to assign her to the mission to save Woods, with whom she has fallen in love, Glenda straps on her parachute, puts her fears behind her and jumps from the plane. Upon landing, she discovers that Woods is unharmed and that his accident was a ruse to help her overcome her anxiety. ==Aerial Nurse Corps== The Aerial Nurse Corps of America was created in 1936 by Lauretta M.

International trade policy has been highly controversial since the 18th century. International trade theory and economics itself have developed as means to evaluate the effects of trade policies. ==Adam Smith's model == Adam Smith describes trade taking place as a result of countries having absolute advantage in production of particular goods, relative to each other. Within Adam Smith's framework, absolute advantage refers to the instance where one country can produce a unit of a good with less labor than another country. In Book IV of his major work the Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith, discussing gains from trade, provides a literary model for absolute advantage based upon the example of growing grapes from Scotland. He makes the argument that while it is possible to grow grapes and produce wine in Scotland, the investment in the factors of production would cost thirty times than more than the cost of purchasing an equal quantity from a foreign country. The minimization of aggregate real costs and efficient resource allocation through trade without strong consideration for comparative costs form the basis of Adam Smith's model of absolute advantage in international trade. ==Ricardian model== The law of comparative advantage was first proposed by David Ricardo. The Ricardian theory of comparative advantage became a basic constituent of neoclassical trade theory. Any undergraduate course in trade theory includes a presentation of Ricardo's example of a two-commodity, two-country model. For the modern development, see Ricardian trade theory extensions The Ricardian model focuses on comparative advantage, which arises due to differences in technology or natural resources. The Ricardian model does not directly consider factor endowments, such as the relative amounts of labor and capital within a country. New interpretation The Ricardian model is often presented as being based on the following assumptions: * Labor is the only primary input to production. * The relative ratios of labor at which the production of one good can be traded off for another, differ between countries. This is incomplete, because the Ricardian model can be extended to the situation where many goods can be inputs for a production. See Ricardian trade theory extensions below. Relative ratio of labor input coefficients has a valid meaning only for simple cases such as two-country, many commodity case or many-country, two-commodity case without no intermediate goods.Alan V. Deardorff (2005) Ricardian comparative advantage with intermediate inputs. _North American Journal of Economics and Finance_ 16(1): 11-34. As for the meanings of four magic numbers, a new interpretation became popular in the 21st century. In 2002, Roy Ruffin pointed the possibility of new reading of Ricardo's explanations.Roy J. Ruffin (2002) David Ricardo's discovery of comparative advantage. _History of Political Economy_ 34: 727-748. Andrea Maneschi made a detailed account in 2004.Andrea Maneschi (2004) The true meaning of David Ricardo's four magic numbers. _Journal of International Economics_ 62(2): 433-443. Now the new interpretation has become almost as established as Ricardo's text, not only for the first third of Chapter 7 but for all descriptions throughout his book concerning international trade.Gilbert Faccarello (2017) A calm investigation into Mr. Ricardo's principles of international trade. Senga et al. (eds.) Ricardo and International Trade. London and New York: Routledge. ==Specific factors model== The specific factors model is an extension of the Ricardian model. It was due to Jacob Viner's interest in explaining the migration of workers from the rural to urban areas after the Industrial revolution. In this model labor mobility among industries is possible while capital is assumed to be immobile in the short run. Thus, this model can be interpreted as a short-run version of the Heckscher-Ohlin model. The \\"specific factors\\" name refers to the assumption that in the short run, specific factors of production such as physical capital are not easily transferable between industries. The theory suggests that if there is an increase in the price of a good, the owners of the factor of production specific to that good will profit in real terms ==Heckscher–Ohlin model== In the early 1900s, a theory of international trade was developed by two Swedish economists, Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin. This theory has subsequently become known as the Heckscher–Ohlin model (H–O model). The results of the H–O model are that the pattern of international trade is determined by differences in factor endowments. It predicts that countries will export those goods that make intensive use of locally abundant factors and will import goods that make intensive use of factors that are locally scarce. The H–O model makes the following core assumptions: * Labor and capital flow freely between sectors equalising factor prices across sectors within a country. * The amount of labor and capital in two countries differ (difference in endowments) * Technology is the same among countries (a long- term assumption) *Tastes are the same upon countries  Stolper-Samuelson theorem  According to the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, the export of a product which is relatively cheap, abundant resource makes this resource more scarce in the domestic market. Thus, the increased demand for the abundant resource leads to an increase in its price and an increase in its income. Simultaneously, the income of the resource used intensively in the import- competing product decreases as its demand falls. Simply put, this theorem indicates that an increase in the price of a product rises the income earned by resources that are used intensively in its production. Conversely, a decrease in the price of a product reduces the income of the resources that it uses intensively. The abundant resource that have comparative advantage realizes an increase in income, and the scarce resource realizes a decrease in its income regardless of industry. This trade theory concludes that some people will suffer losses from free trade even in the long-term.  Empirical Evidences of the Heckscher–Ohlin model  In 1953, Wassily Leontief published a study in which he tested the validity of the Heckscher-Ohlin theory. The study showed that the United States was more abundant in capital compared to other countries, therefore the United States would export capital-intensive goods and import labor-intensive goods. Leontief found out that the United States' exports were less capital intensive than its imports. The result became known as Leontief's paradox. After the appearance of Leontief's paradox, many researchers tried to save the Heckscher-Ohlin theory, either by new methods of measurement, or by new interpretations. ==New trade theory== New trade theory tries to explain empirical elements of trade that comparative advantage-based models above have difficulty with. These include the fact that most trade is between countries with similar factor endowment and productivity levels, and the large amount of multinational production (i.e., foreign direct investment) that exists. New trade theories are often based on assumptions such as monopolistic competition and increasing returns to scale. One result of these theories is the home-market effect, which asserts that, if an industry tends to cluster in one location because of returns to scale and if that industry faces high transportation costs, the industry will be located in the country with most of its demand, in order to minimize cost. ==New new trade theory== New new trade theory is a theory of international trade inaugurated by Marc Melitz in 2003.Melitz, Marc J. (2003) The impact of trade on intra-industry reallocations and aggregate industry productivity. _Econometrica_ 71(6): 1695-1725. It discovered that efficiency of firms in a country changes much and those firms engaged in international trade have higher productivity than firms which produce only for domestic market. As it is fitted to big data age, the research produced many follows and the trend is now called New new trade theory in comparison to Paul Krugman's new trade theory. ==Gravity model== The Gravity model of trade presents a more empirical analysis of trading patterns. The gravity model, in its basic form, predicts trade based on the distance between countries and the interaction of the countries' economic sizes. The model mimics the Newtonian law of gravity which also considers distance and physical size between two objects. The model has been shown to have significant empirical validity.Akman, 2016. \\"The facilitating role of visa policies on international trade and foreign direct investment\\" ==Ricardian trade theory extensions== According to Eaton and KortumJonathan Eaton and Samuel Kortum (2012) Putting Ricardo to Work. _Journal of Economic Perspectives_ 26(2): 65-89. p.66., in the 21 century, \\"the Ricardian framework has experienced a revival. Much work in international trade during the last decade has returned to the assumption that countries gain from trade because they have access to different technologies. ... This line of thought has brought Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage back to center stage.\\" The Ricardian trade theory was expanded and generalized multiple times: notably to treat many-country many-product situation and to include intermediate input trade, and choice of production techniques. In Ricardian framework, capital goods (comprising fixed capital) are treated as goods which are produced and consumed in the production. Many countries, many goods There were three waves of expansions and generalizations. First phase: Major general results were obtained by McKenzie and Jones. McKenzie was more interested in the patterns of trade specialisiations (including incomplete specializations), whereas Jones was more interested in the patterns of complete specialization, in which the prices moves freely within a certain limited range., section 4. The formula he found is often cited as Jones' inequality, p.508. or Jones' criterion.Golub, S. S. (1995) Comparative and absolute advantage in the Asia-Pacific region (No. 95-09). Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. p.4 Second phase: Ricardo's idea was even expanded to the case of continuum of goods by Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson (1977) This model is restricted to two country case. It is employed for example by Matsuyama and others. These theories use a special property that is applicable only for the two-country case. They normally assume fixed expenditure coefficients. Eaton and Kortum (2002)J. Eaton and S. Kortum (2002) Technology, Geography, and Trade. Econometrica 70(5): 1741-1779. See p.1745 in particular for the model building. inherited Ricardian model with a continuum of goodsl from Dorbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson (1977). It has succeeded to incorporate trade of intermediate products. Countries have different access to technology. The bundle of inputs is assumed as the same across commodities within a country. This means that all industries of a country consume the same bundle of inputs and there is no distinction between petrol-consuming and iron- consuming industries. This is the major reason why Eaton and Kortum (2002) cannot be used as frawemork for analyzing global value chains. The paper has gotten a big success as giving theoretical foundation for gravity model. Third phase: Shiozawa succeeded to construct a Ricardian theory with many-country, many-commodity model which permits choice of production techniques and trade of input goods. All countries have their own set of production techniques. Major difference with H-O model that this Ricardian model assumes different technologies. Wages determined in this model are different according to the productivity of countries. The model is therefore more suitable than H-O models in analyzing relations between developing and developed countries. Shiozawa's theory is now extended as \\"the new theory of international values.\\"Shiozawa, Y. (2017) The new theory of international values: an overview. Chapter 1 (pp.3-73) in Shiozawa, Oka and Tabuchi (eds.) _A New Construction of Ricardian Theory of International Values: Analytical and Historical Approach_ Singapore, Springer. Traded intermediate goods Ricardian trade theory ordinarily assumes that the labor is the unique input. This has been thought to be a significant deficiency for Ricardian trade theory since intermediate goods comprise a major part of world international trade.Yeats, A., 2001, \\"Just How Big is Global Production Sharing?\\" in Arndt, S. and H. Kierzkowski (eds.), 2001, Fragmentation: New Production Patterns in the World Economy, (Oxford University Press, Oxford).Bardhan, Ashok Deo, and Jaffee, Dwight (2004), \\"On Intra-Firm Trade and Multinationals: Foreign Outsourcing and Offshoring in Manufacturing\\" in Monty Graham and Robert Solow eds., The Role of Foreign Direct Investment and Multinational Corporations in Economic Development.

See pp. 166–8. emphasized the necessity to expand the Ricardian theory to the cases of traded inputs. McKenzie (1954, p. 179) pointed that \\"A moment's consideration will convince one that Lancashire would be unlikely to produce cotton cloth if the cotton had to be grown in England.\\"Equilibrium, Trade, and Growth: Selected Papers of Lionel W. McKenzie, By Lionel W. McKenzie, Tapan Mitra, Kazuo Nishimura, Page 232. Paul Samuelson coined a term Sraffa bonus to name the gains from trade of inputs. John S. Chipman observed in his survey that McKenzie stumbled upon the questions of intermediate products and postulated that \\"introduction of trade in intermediate product necessitates a fundamental alteration in classical analysis\\". It took many years until Shiozawa succeeded in removing this deficiency. The new theory of international values is now the unique theory that can deal with input trade in a general form. Y.

International intra-firm competition reflects a really new aspect of international competition in the age of so- called global competition. Global value chains Revolutionary change in communication and information techniques and drastic downs of transport costs have enabled an historic breakup of production process.

He is the head football coach at The University of Texas at Austin. He previously was the head coach at the University of Houston. ==Early life== An only child, Herman was born in Cincinnati, Ohio and has family there. From age six he was raised in Simi Valley, California. He earned his B.S. in Business Administration from California Lutheran University in 1997, where he was a Presidential Scholarship recipient and cum laude graduate. At California Lutheran he was an All-Southern California Athletic Conference wide receiver. He also earned a master's degree from the University of Texas at Austin. ==Coaching career== Early coaching career Herman began his coaching career in 1998 at Texas Lutheran as a receivers coach. He then took a position in 1999 at the University of Texas at Austin as a graduate assistant under the mentorship of Greg Davis. During his tenure at Texas, Herman worked with the offensive line, which included All-American Leonard Davis. Sam Houston State In 2004, they finished 11-3 and advanced to the Division I-AA championship's semifinals. The Bearkats' offense was ranked second nationally in passing offense, averaging 358.5 yards, while the Bearkats' 471 yards of total offense ranked fifth among Division I-AA schools. Texas State After four seasons at Sam Houston State, Herman joined Texas State as the offensive coordinator in 2005. During his two seasons at Texas State his squad led the Southland Conference in total offense and the 2005 team ranked eighth nationally in scoring. The Bobcats went on to make a deep run in the NCAA in the team's first ever Division I-AA appearance, while Barrick Nealy finished fifth in the voting for the Walter Payton Award (top offensive player in Division I-AA). Rice In 2007, Herman then followed head coach David Bailiff from Texas State to form the new coaching staff at Rice. Rice ranked in the Top 10 nationally in 2008 in passing offense (5th; 327.8), scoring offense (T8th; 41.6) and total offense (10th; 472.3). Two Rice receivers had more than 1,300 yards receiving that year, tight end James Casey had 111 catches and quarterback Chase Clement was the Conference USA MVP. Iowa State Herman at Iowa State After building one of the nation's most prolific offenses at Rice, Herman joined Iowa State as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. Herman installed his system and brought new life into the offense. During his three seasons at Iowa State, the offense improved considerably and broke numerous team and player school records. Iowa State's 52 points in a win over Texas Tech marked the most points put up by the Cyclones against a conference opponent in 38 years. Iowa State quarterback Austen Arnaud ended his career as the Cyclones No. 2 all-time leading passer with 6,777 yards and 42 touchdown passes. His 8,044 yards of total offense is the second-best total in school history. Running back Alexander Robinson finished his Iowa State career as the Cyclones' fourth all-time leading rusher with 3,309 yards. Ohio State On December 9, 2011, Urban Meyer selected Herman as his offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for the Buckeyes. On December 9, 2014, after leading Ohio State's fourth ranked offense to their first national title since 2002, while playing two backup quarterbacks, Herman was awarded the Broyles Award, given annually to the nation's top assistant coach. University of Houston On December 15, 2014, Herman was hired by Houston as its new head football coach. In the 2015 season, he led his 21st- ranked team to an start and the Western Division title in the American Athletic Conference.

On December 31, 2015, Herman led the 14th- ranked Cougars to a 38–24 victory over the 9th-ranked Florida State Seminoles at the Peach Bowl. The Cougars had not beaten an AP top-10 team in a bowl game since 1979. After the game, Herman stated that the Cougars had completed their return to national relevancy. The Cougars ended the season 13–1 and ranked #8 in both the AP and Coaches Polls, their highest post-season ranking since 1979. In 2016, Herman's second season with Houston, the Cougars slipped to a 9–3 regular-season record. Among their nine wins were victories over Oklahoma and Louisville, each of which was ranked #3 in the AP Poll at the time Houston faced them. Houston's overall record in its two seasons under Herman was 22–4, which included unblemished marks in home games at TDECU Stadium (14–0), in games versus teams ranked in the AP Poll (6–0), and in games versus teams from Power Five conferences (5–0). Herman's success with Houston brought him significant attention from the media and from multiple Power Five football programs throughout the season, which culminated in his appointment as the head coach of the Texas Longhorns immediately following Houston's final regular-season contest of 2016. Texas On November 27, 2016, Herman was hired as the new head coach at Texas. He signed a five-year contract with a base salary of $5 million per year.

Texas defeated Georgia in the Sugar Bowl, which clinched the first 10-win season for the Longhorns since 2009. In Herman's third season, expectations were high for the Longhorns, but Texas posted a 7–5 regular season record. Texas defeated No. 11-ranked Utah in the 2019 Alamo Bowl by a final score of 38–10 to end the season on a high note. ==Personal life== Herman is a member of Mensa International.

He came to London in 1830, having served his time in a Manchester warehouse. After gaining some experience abroad, he began business as a silk- mercer. Ultimately he made a fortune as a jeweller and goldsmith on Ludgate Hill, remaining in business till 1875. Walton died on 11 October 1877 at 16 Cambridge Terrace, Southend-on-Sea, and was buried in Highgate cemetery on 15 October. ==Methodism and mysticism== Walton was a Wesleyan Methodist. For many years (from 1839) he was one of the secretaries to the Strangers' Friend Society; its reports 1844 and 1845 are his. Through the specimens in Wesley's Christian Library he was introduced to the writings of William Law; Law led him to Jacob Boehme, and he found a key to Boehme in the diagrams of Dionysius Andrew Freher. His interest in theosophical writings of this class was widened by acquaintance with James Pierrepont Greaves. He was attracted too by the type of devout mysticism presented in James Sigston's Life (1839) of William Bramwell. Walton became a collector of the writings, in print or in manuscript, of mystics, keeping most of his books in what he termed his \\"Theosophian Library\\" on his premises at 8 Ludgate Hill. In 1875, he deposited nearly the whole of his collection with Dr. Williams's Library, then in Grafton Street, stipulating that it should be kept apart as the \\"Walton Theosophical Library\\", and be open to students. ==Works== Walton was the biographer of William Law, author of the Serious Call. About 1845 he advertised for an assistant in the task. He also began to print in November 1847 An Outline of the Qualifications … for the Biography of … Law; it was completed at Christmas 1853.Fuller title Notes and Materials for … Biography of … Law. Comprising an Elucidation of … the Writings of … Böhme, and … Freher; with a Notice of the Mystical Divinity … of all ages of the world. … For Private Circulation. … Five hundred copies, 1854. The work is a disorderly collection of biographical and bibliographical information. He printed also an Introduction to Theosophy (vol. i. 1854); it was intended to reach thirty volumes, but only part was published. Other anonymous publications on theosophy were probably written at Walton's suggestion and printed at his cost. He had prepared a vast number of theosophic diagrams of his own invention on Freher's pattern. ==Legacy== The Walton Theosophical Library of about 1,000 volumes became part of Dr Williams's Library.A Short Account of the Charity and Library Established under the Will of the Late Rev. Daniel Williams, D.D (1917), p. 127; archive.org. ==Family== Walton was twice married. By his first wife, Anna Maria Pickford (died 1863) of Bristol, he had two sons and three daughters. On the death of his son Christopher he adopted a son, to whom he gave his own name. By his second wife, who survived him, he had one daughter. ==NotesReferences== * ;Attribution Category:1809 births Category:1877 deaths Category:English businesspeople Category:English Methodists Category:English Theosophists ","title":"Christopher Walton"},{"id":"35222673","text":"Pensions Act may refer to * Pensions Act 1995, an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom * Pensions Act 2004, an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom * Pensions Act 2007, an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom * Pensions Act 2008, an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom ","title":"Pensions Act"},{"id":"35222683","text":"The Massa River () is a river in southern Morocco located in the Sous region.

He grew up on a farm outside of Marion, Ohio living the life most farm boys did, which was running the woods and fields with his dogs. At age 7, he knew he wanted to be a biologist and to work with animals. He attended Pleasant High School, after moving into a more residential farming community. He graduated in 1987. Wanting to go to college to earn his biology degree, but not having the money for it, Heflick joined military service and volunteered to go to Central America. He was not disappointed with what he found and his love for exotic exploration and adventure was born. He enrolled in Wright State University to gain a degree in biology and met his future wife, Jennifer, the first week he was there. During these college years, he worked multiple jobs to make it through. Heflick worked at a vet clinic, a physiology lab and was security at a bar to name a few. He graduated in 1994 and married Jennifer before moving down to Melbourne, Florida to enter graduate school at the Florida Institute of Technology. Heflick had always been mesmerized by the ocean since gaining his SCUBA certification when he was 16, so attending a graduate school close to the ocean was no accident. Part of the way through graduate school, Shawn and Jennifer had their son Thorne Ginga Heflick . Heflick left graduate school and took a job at Brevard Zoo as curator, where he excelled at his duties and both taught, as well as, learned from his keepers in the husbandry and care of exotic animals until 1998. Heflick left the zoo to once again pursue his graduate degree, which he earned in 2001. Since receiving it, he has worked as a teacher, director of conservation, field biologist, director of education and president for several not-for-profit conservation NGOs. Heflick is currently the host for National Geographic Wild's Python Hunters and has appeared on or in National Geographic, PBS Nature, Smithsonian Channel, Travel Channel, Time Magazine, Time Magazine for Kids, Dateline, Nightline, BBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, as well as, countless newspapers across the US and abroad. Heflick also runs several small businesses including Wildland Tours, Art By Evolution, White Gator Productions and Shawn Heflick Enterprises. Occasionally Heflick also contributes commentary as an animal expert on various local and national news programs. Heflick and his family live in Florida and have a home in the Amazon Basin of Peru where they love to vacation and get back into the wild. == References == * The Python Hunters * Herpetologist Shawn Heflick Answers Your Questions * http://www.thirteen.org/pressroom/pdf/nature/season28/PythonsBiosFINAL.pdf * http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1913751,00.html * https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/invasion-of-the-giant- pythons/herpetologist-shawn-heflick-answers-your-questions/5564/ * http://www.cineflixproductions.com/hosts/30-Shawn-Greg-Mike- * http://boyslife.org/video-audio/21803/shawn-heflicks-favorite-snakes/ * http://www.oln.ca/otherinfo.php?id=110&infoid;=69 * http://www.usark.org/uploads/Heflick%20Testimony.pdf * http://namesdatabase.com/people/HEFLICK/SHAWN/33721871 * http://www.napleschamber.org/news-press/detail.aspx?id=6067 * http://www.wright.edu/email/alumni/newsletter/archives/february2012.html == External links == * Shawn Heflick's website * Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:American television personalities Category:21st-century American biologists ","title":"Shawn Heflick"},{"id":"35222708","text":"Mzimvubu River or Umzimvubu River is one of the most important rivers in South Africa.Key rivers of South Africa It is located in the Eastern Cape Province. ==Course== The river has its source in the northern region of the Eastern Cape, in the area of Matatiele and Mount Fletcher near the Lesotho border.

Officially counted as the first two episodes of the season, it figures as the 53rd and 54th overall episodes of the series. It was written by series creator and executive producer Matthew Weiner, and directed by Jennifer Getzinger. It originally aired on the AMC channel in the United States on March 25, 2012. The premiere centers on Don Draper's fortieth birthday, opening on Memorial Day weekend 1966. The office prepares for Don's surprise party while also dealing with the Heinz Beans account recently brought into the agency. The relationship between Megan and Don turns bitter after she performs a sensual dance during the party, while Peggy and Pete both suffer through professional conflict with their fellow co-workers. \\"A Little Kiss\\" was the first Mad Men episode to air in 17 months following heated contract negotiations between AMC and Matthew Weiner. A consequence of the hiatus saw the show switch from airing in the Summer/Fall to the Spring for the remainder of its run. Christopher Stanley (Henry Francis), Jessica Paré (Megan Draper), and Jay R. Ferguson (Stan Rizzo) were all added as main cast members beginning with the premiere. The theme of the episode relates to the boredom and discontent among the main characters as they settle into their rather uneventful lives. The episode was well received by television critics and, at a runtime of 90 minutes, is the longest episode of Mad Men to date. It was also the highest rated episode of Mad Men to date with 3.54 million viewers tuning in, a substantial jump over the fourth season average owing in large part to the lengthy time between seasons. == Plot == On the street below the Young & Rubicam office, African American protesters are picketing in support of equal-opportunity employment. Several employees lean out the office window and drop bags of water on them. The protesters and journalists then enter the office to catch the employees ready with water-filled bags. At his new apartment, Don Draper (Jon Hamm) cooks breakfast for Sally (Kiernan Shipka), Bobby (Mason Vale Cotton) and Gene. He only gets to see them for a short time before he returns them to Betty and Henry’s impressive (but quite old) home. Don is now married to Megan, and turning forty (Dick Whitman's birthday having been several months earlier and Don Draper's about to occur). Megan, who now works under Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) in creative, is planning a big surprise party for his birthday. Peggy, knowing Don's aversion to birthdays, is reserved about the idea, but Megan insists that no one could dislike parties. Roger Sterling (John Slattery) shows Don and Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) a newspaper article shaming Y&R; for the water-bomb stunt. Roger suggests running a mock ad touting Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce as an equal-opportunity employer. Pete arrives at a lunch meeting with representatives from Mohawk Airlines and unexpectedly finds Roger sharing drinks with them. Roger had spied on Pete's appointment calendar. Pete is overcome with anger over Roger’s antics, especially since the charismatic Roger makes a much better impression. During a presentation for Heinz, Peggy pitches an ambitious, cutting-edge \\"ballet of beans\\" ad, which does not impress the Heinz executives. Don enters to assure the company men that his firm will think of a new pitch. Peggy protests that he did not fight hard enough for her idea, and complains to Stan that Don has changed. On the evening of the surprise party (which is inadvertently given away by Roger), Megan presents her birthday gift: She sings a French song, \\"Zou Bisou Bisou\\", and dances provocatively. The guests clap and whistle, although Don seems unimpressed. Peggy, while talking to Don and Megan, makes a snide remark about having to return to the office later, since she is the only one really working on the weekend. After the party, Don, tired of the day, collapses on the bed fully clothed. Megan asks if he enjoyed the party; he tells her not to waste money on such things. Not fazed by his demeanor, she teases and kisses him, wanting to talk about the party. He declines and insists on going to sleep, so she leaves the room upset. The next morning, Lane Pryce (Jared Harris) finds a man's wallet in a cab. Inspecting it, he becomes fascinated with a photo of a young woman named Delores. He later telephones the wallet’s owner but reaches Delores, the owner’s girlfriend. He flirts with her on the phone, and she promises the wallet be retrieved. The owner of the wallet comes to Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce in order to retrieve it. Lane secretly removes Delores’ photo and the owner does not notice. Joan Harris (Christina Hendricks) has given birth to a son named Kevin, who is now a few months old. Her mother, Gail Holloway (Christine Estabrook), has come to stay with her to help with the baby but constantly argues with Joan over the subject of Joan returning to work, saying that Joan's husband is a doctor. Insisting that the company needs her, Joan does not want to break her promise to go back. Gail shows Joan the company's newspaper ad and claims that it is evidence that they intend to replace her. Joan stops by the office with baby Kevin in tow. In Lane’s office, she tearfully asks if they are planning to replace her. He assures her that the ad is a poor joke and that everyone is eagerly awaiting her return. Megan overhears some particularly lewd comments from Harry about her dance, eventually ranting to Peggy about the office’s cynical culture. She tells her that Don did not appreciate the surprise party. Peggy apologizes for her rude comment at the party and Megan goes home early. Peggy goes to Don’s office to apologize to him as well. After hearing that Megan went home early, Don also leaves for the day. At the apartment, he asks Megan why she left work. She then disrobes and angrily cleans up the mess left from the party in just her black bra and panties. Don tries to initiate sex, but Megan says no and forcefully pushes him away several times. Don grabs her roughly, saying she \\"[wants] it so bad right now\\", and the two have sex on the floor. Afterwards, Megan complains that she is not liked at the office and wonders if she ought to stop working there. Don tells her he does not care about work - he only cares about her. Pete is given Harry's office, which is larger and has windows, in order to impress his clients. As revenge for Roger crashing his earlier meeting with Mohawk Airlines, Peter later tricks Roger into going on a 6:00 a.m. meeting with Coca-Cola that doesn’t exist. At the office the next morning, Don and Megan enter the reception area to find a large group of African-American women and men. They are responding to the newspaper ad, not aware it was a joke. The receptionist interrupts with a piece of traditional African art, sent from Y&R.; Realizing that the applicants have seen the artifact, Cooper sends Lane into the reception area. He dismisses the men, by saying they are only seeking secretaries, and collects resumes from the women. ==Production== \\"A Little Kiss\\" was directed by Jennifer Getzinger and written by series creator Matthew Weiner. This was the second episode to be solely written by Weiner and directed by Getzinger, the other being the fourth season episode \\"The Suitcase\\". Although the first to be aired of the season, it was actually produced after the following episode \\"Tea Leaves\\", due to January Jones' pregnancy. Despite the long break, 85 percent of the crew from the fourth season returned for the fifth. \\"There's a sense of boredom, there's a sense of anxiety, there's a sense of discontent with the contentedness\\", Weiner said, in regards to the positions of the characters at the beginning of the new season. Weiner considered the main question of the first episode \\"What is Don Draper like when he is happy?\\", with the twist of the first episode being Don's lack of interest in work. The episode was expanded from its regular runtime of 47 minutes into a 90-minute episode aired over two hours, after Weiner realized the story broken for the premiere was \\"85 percent too big\\". \\"We just put everything into it that we had. I think when you see it in its completeness, you'll get it.\\" Intense contract negotiations between the end of the fourth and fifth season led Matthew Weiner to quit during the downtime between Season 4 and Season 5. AMC and Weiner were locked in intense negotiations, with AMC asking Weiner to cut two main cast members every season starting with the fifth, a shorter running time to make room for more commercials, and more product placement within the series. During the negotiations, Weiner said, \\"First of all, the number that's been published is not true. Second of all, I offered to have less money, to save the cast, and to leave the show in the running time that it's supposed to be. The harder that I've fought for the show, the more money that they've offered me.\\" After conversations with the network stalled, Weiner gave up hope on returning to the series. \\"I quit ... during the negotiation. I had come to terms with the fact that it was over ... In the most protective and demanding way, I did not feel that it was worth going back to work to make a show that was not the show I'd been making. I had this argument with my wife, where I said: 'You don't understand - it's not just a matter of changing the show. I don't want to go to work and do it different. I just figured out how it works' ... [But] in the end, everything worked out.\\" AMC eventually relented, signing a new deal with Weiner that keeps him on board as showrunner for the fifth and sixth season, with a strong possibility for a final seventh season. Weiner explained that the delay in the airing of the series and the 17-month break between the fourth and fifth season was not his decision. Although, he did admit that the plan to keep Mad Men off the air in 2011 was in place before the negotiations. He said, \\"There was a plan in place in 2010 that the show would not be on the air in 2011. You don't just throw in Breaking Bad because Mad Men is not available. They have four shows. They do them one at a time, and God bless them for the fact that Breaking Bad got an audience, because of where they were this summer. I'm very happy about that, because people should see that show.\\" \\"The Look of Love\\" song change The original screener of \\"A Little Kiss\\" sent out to critics included the use of the Dusty Springfield song \\"The Look of Love\\". However, critics soon pointed out that \\"The Look of Love\\" was not released until 1967, six months after the time period that \\"A Little Kiss\\" takes place. When critics pointed this out to showrunner Matthew Weiner, he sent out a letter to critics, which was reprinted in many publications and websites. Weiner's letter included him telling reporters that, \\"Although we take license for artistic purposes with the end-title music, we never want the source music to break from the time period we are trying to recreate. As someone who has a deep appreciation for details, I want to thank you for bringing this to our attention. It’s a privilege to work on a show that generates an ongoing dialog with you and our amazing fans so please — keep those notes and comments coming!\\" The 1966 Dusty Springfield song \\"You Don't Have To Say You Love Me\\" was used during the end titles, though this was not a replacement for \\"The Look of Love\\". An article by The New York Times indicated that \\"The Look of Love\\" was originally played by the band at Don Draper's fortieth birthday party. Young & Rubicam protest incident On May 28, 1966, advertising executives from Young & Rubicam dropped water bombs on unsuspecting Black protesters, including 9-year-old Mike Robinson. This uncredited child actor portrays a fictionalized version of Robinson in the fifth-season premiere of Mad Men. In an unusual departure for the series, the opening scene of the season premiere was largely a re-creation of a true event that occurred at the Young & Rubicam advertising agency. The original story detailing the event was published on Page 1 of the May 28, 1966, edition of The New York Times. The \\"Goldwater '68\\" poster seen in the window of Young & Rubicam during \\"A Little Kiss\\" was also present on the day of the real event, including another poster that read \\"If you want money, get a job\\" (echoed by one character's scream of \\"Get a job!\\" at the protesters in the premiere). The incident was notable for water bombs thrown from the executive floor, which housed the Young & Rubicam advertising agency. The two water balloons struck 19-year-old James Hill, who slipped and fell on pavement, but was not seriously hurt. The other hit 9-year-old Mike Robinson. His mother, Mrs. Esme Robinson, along with other Black protesters and a New York Times reporter, came to the executive floor to complain. Mike Robinson, Esme Robinson, protester Vivian Harris, and Times reporter John Kifner were all portrayed in the opening scene. The dialogue in the scene was also taken directly from the original article. Vivian Harris originally said the, \\"And they call us savages\\" line, which television critic Mike Hale called \\"unfortunately hamhanded\\" and fellow critic Matt Zoller Seitz called \\"a terrible line\\" when they reviewed the premiere, apparently unaware that it was a real quote. On the day of the real event, Young & Rubicam office manager Frank Coppola apologized to the women for the incident, saying that \\"we have 1,600 people in this building and I can't control all of them. I've ordered all of the windows closed and I have men patrolling all the floors to make sure this doesn't happen again.\\" Coppola's assurance that the windows were closed is similar to character Don Draper's idea of \\"Our windows don't open\\" in Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce's mocking want ad seen later in the episode. After the head researcher for Mad Men, Allison Hill, found the original article, she handed it to showrunner Matthew Weiner, who was \\"blown away\\". “I just loved the level of outrage from the participants in the protest. It was so eloquently said, and it struck to the heart of the conflict. They were being lampooned. This was a very serious issue for them and a joke to everyone else,\\" Weiner said. The original New York Times reporter, John Kifner, does not remember the actual event, mentioning that he did \\"a lot of poverty and racial stuff.\\" He could not remember the original article, but was greatly excited when he heard that his story inspired the premiere. The current chief executive of Young & Rubicam, David Sable, did not know whether the original employees were fired, but found their actions \\"completely repulsive and not in line with the values of our company\\". \\"Zou Bisou Bisou\\" Megan Draper's (Jessica Paré) performance at the birthday party The episode includes a scene where Megan Draper serenades Don with a rendition of \\"Zou Bisou Bisou\\", which is a French Yé-yé song originally released in 1960 by Gillian Hills. Creator Matthew Weiner prepared Jessica Paré for her performance of \\"Zou Bisou Bisou\\" and gave her a detailed list of notes to help her. She worked with choreographer Marianne Ann Kellogg during three six-hour sessions to work out the dance routine. It took the actress about a week and a half to learn the entire routine. She recorded the actual song in a studio. Paré said to reporters the day after the original episode airing, “It’s been gathering a lot of really great attention. I can’t believe I’m new on the show and one of the first things I have to do is an entire song and dance routine for the entire cast of Mad Men.” Weiner characterized the dance as a symbol of the oncoming generation gap and \\"open sexuality\\". Alexandra Kaptik of The Wall Street Journal said \\"One of the most talked-about scenes…was Megan Draper’s sultry performance…\\" Slate Haglund described the song as \\"The centerpiece of the Mad Men season 5 premiere\\". Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone described the scene as \\"a highlight of the two-hour episode\\", stating that \\"Megan sings…for her husband, who can barely suppress his embarrassment and discomfort.\\" Bill Keveney of USA Today said \\"Paré…had fans buzzing…with her character's sexy rendition…\\" Patrick Kevin Day of the Los Angeles Times stated that the scene \\"…has people talking\\", describing it as follows: \\"Pare…serenades her husband…with the sexy, slinky number \\"Zou Bisou Bisou\\" while wearing a barely there miniskirt.\\" Lori Rackl of the Chicago Sun-Times noted that the performance was the talk the premiere and said: \\"Showing a lot of leg — and chutzpah — the new Mrs. Megan Draper (Jessica Paré) delivered a sexy serenade…purring the early ’60s French pop song \\"Zou Bisou Bisou.\\" The…performance made the unflappable Don Draper blush and his co-workers’ jaws hit the floor…\\" Lauren Moraski of CBS News said \\"Probably one of the best scenes…took place when the new Mrs. Don Draper (Jessica Paré as Megan) sang an awkward-turned-sultry version of the French '60s pop song \\"Zou Bisou Bisou\\"…\\" Erin Carlson of The Hollywood Reporter described Paré's performance as \\"bizarre, come-hither burlesque\\", noting that she \\"…stunned partygoers who openly ogled her while the ad exec (Jon Hamm) squirmed with polite embarrassment.\\" Ethan Sacks of the New York Daily News described the scene as \\"The sexy scene in which Megan serenades Don…with the song and transitions into a lap dance…\\" ==Reception== Ratings \\"A Little Kiss\\" was the most watched episode of Mad Men to that point, with 3.5 million viewers overall and 1.6 million viewers in the 18-49 demographic. Before the fifth season, Mad Men had never gotten above a 1.00 in the 18-49 demographic. The premiere's core viewer demographic was adults aged 25–54 at 1.7 million viewers. This was an increase from the same core group during the season four premiere at 1.4 million viewers. Charlie Collier, AMC’s president, said that \\"For each of the five Mad Men seasons Matthew Weiner and his team have crafted a beautifully told story and each season a larger audience has responded; a rare accomplishment. We couldn’t be more proud of this program, the brilliant writers, cast and crew, and the entire team on each side of the camera.\\" Critical reception \\"A Little Kiss\\" received very approving reviews from the television critic community. USA Today writer Robert Bianco gave it four out of four stars, praising the high level of achievement in the writing and directing as well as the cast led by the \\"shockingly under-Emmyed Jon Hamm, playing a man who is his own deeply flawed invention and letting us see the effort and pain behind the charade. But there's not a weak performer on view Sunday, from the preternaturally assured Kiernan Shipka as Sally to old pro Robert Morse as Bert.\\" TV Guide critic Matt Roush opined that \\"the civil rights movement provides ironic bookends for the episode, reflecting how insular the universe is for these smug but deeply flawed purveyors of the American dream, none more memorable and maddening than Don Draper (Jon Hamm), the alpha hunk who appears to have it all. But some things never change in the world of Mad Men: the high quality of acting, writing, production design and detail.\\" Newsday reviewer Verne Gay gave it an \\"A\\" grade, citing that \\"Mad Men is back and back in all the right ways -- the humor, the writing, the period details, and best of all, the flawless attention to these characters and their cluttered interior worlds.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said that \\"the premiere suggests that the only other show that belongs with it in the discussion for the best drama on television is the same one we were talking about last season. At the top level, there is Breaking Bad, and there is also — finally, thankfully, exceptionally — Mad Men, and then there is everything else.\\" TV Fanatic's Dan Forcella gave the two-hour season premiere 4.5 out of 5 stars by saying, \\"Honestly, the first 45 minutes or so were basically just setting the scene for the new season, so it was a smart move to make this premiere two hours long. After that, though, everything began to pick up.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club rated this episode an A- and commented on the series' take on the 1960s, saying: \\"The '60s are both incredibly important to the show and something almost incidental to what makes it work so well. It’s a show, on the one hand, about how people deal with sweeping social change, even when it's happening way, way off their radar (as we see in the final scene of tonight's episode), but it’s also a show about what it means to live through a decade.\\" Lori Rackl of Chicago Sun-Times gave the season five premiere four stars: \\"After a dark and often depressing season four, it's refreshing to start things off on a more jovial, lighter note. That's not to say the premiere is devoid of angst, disappointment and drama. It's just buoyed by an unusually high amount of humor.\\" The Los Angeles Times Robert Lloyd spoke about the series' continued success: \\"It works because it's less about who we were then—it's a fantasy of who we were then, really—than about who we are now.\\" Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times, however, was one of the very few reviewers to give the season premiere a low score: \\"A show that became a hit because it seemed so original has been so co-opted that it now looks like a cliché. The personalities on Mad Men don't change, but the times do. At this point, the context may be more interesting than the characters.\\" On Twitter, The Hollywood Reporter critic Tim Goodman characterized Stanley's critique as a \\"bullshit ramble-review\\", saying that Stanley \\"just wants us to know she's above the material she's covering.\\" In his review, Goodman was laudatory, saying that \\"the party, more than anything else, was a central defining moment of where we're going. Everything about it was different. Newer. We're not in 1960 anymore. And if you think about it, the show we all know and love is about to change as well. It's going to look different, above and beyond the characters changing.\\" Time writer James Poniewozik wrote a cooler review saying that, \\"I’m glad to have Mad Men back, but “A Little Kiss” was not a great episode. Mad Men return episodes generally aren’t: they take their time and do a lot of table setting.\\" Poniewozik was simultaneously intrigued and unsettled by Megan's addition as \\"essentially a new female lead\\" and reasoned that Weiner used Megan's \\"unfamiliarity as an advantage and as a storytelling device. The very fact that she is an unknown quantity among these very well- known quantities may give us a chance to see everyone we think we know differently — through the eyes of a relative stranger.\\" Chuck Barney of the Contra Costa Times said the premiere was off to a \\"methodical start\\" that reintroduced us to the \\"enigmatic characters\\" but that \\"Eventually, it gains traction, weaving threads of heartfelt poignancy with doses of dark humor. What hasn't changed is the quality of the endeavor. Mad Men remains a show that often feels more like literature than TV. The top-notch acting is still intact, as is the attention to aesthetic detail. So, after that excruciating delay, are we still in love with this show? Truly, deeply -- madly.\\" David Weigard of the San Francisco Chronicle called the premiere a \\"stunner\\" and compared the character of Don Draper to legendary American characters like Jake Barnes, Charles Foster Kane, Tony Soprano, Huck Finn, Natty Bumppo, Elmer Gantry and \\"most of all, to F. Scott Fitzgerald's creation of Jimmy Gatz, who assumed an entirely new identity as Jay Gatsby in 1925.\\" ==References *\\"A Little Kiss\\" at AMC * * * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Mad Men (season 5) episodes ","title":"A Little Kiss"},{"id":"35222717","text":"Heterorepetobasidium is a genus of fungi of uncertain familial placement (incertae sedis) in the order Auriculariales.

He is also a tennis coach who has worked with some of the best players in the world and is a former British number two professional tennis player.ITF Pro Circuit Profile ==Early years== Goodall started playing tennis in Zambia, Central Africa, when he was nine years old. Upon returning to the UK three years later he was chosen to represent Great Britain (under-12 level) and continued to do so throughout his junior career up to, and including, under-21 level. He was a silver medalist in doubles at the under-14 European Championships and went on to compete in all of the junior Grand Slam events on several occasions in both singles and doubles. ==Tour career== At age 18 Goodall was given a wild card entry into the 1985 Wimbledon Championships where he met seventh seed Joakim Nyström in the first round.ATP World Tour Profile He was beaten by the Swede in four sets. His only other appearance in the singles draw at Wimbledon was in 1988, when he lost in straight sets to Italian qualifier Diego Nargiso. He participated in the Wimbledon men's doubles championships every year from 1986 to 1990. He and partner Peter Wright were doubles runner-up at the Dublin Challenger tournament in 1987. Goodall was ranked as high as British number two as a senior and was also national senior doubles champion. He was chosen to be part of the British team in two Davis Cup ties in 1989; away against Finland, which Britain won 4–1, and at home against Argentina, which the hosts lost 3–2. ==Coaching== At the age of 21 he retired due to a chronic elbow injury and thereafter turned to coaching (occasionally still playing on the tour up until the 1990 Wimbledon Championships), working initially with 21-times Grand Slam doubles champion Pam Shriver. Whilst doing so, she made the final of the US Open doubles in 1989 with Mary Joe Fernandez, only to lose to Martina Navratilova and Hana Mandlíková 5–7, 6–4, 6–4. He then worked with former world number four Fernandez and was coaching her when she made the singles and doubles finals at the Australian Open in 1990. Fernandez was beaten 6–3, 6–4 by Steffi Graf in the singles, and teaming up with American Patty Fendick in doubles, lost 7–6, 7–6 to top seeds Jana Novotná and Helena Suková in the final. Goodall then worked with various other players on the WTA Tour including former world number 25 Betsy Nagelsen and former world number ones Arantxa Sánchez Vicario and Jennifer Capriati as both coach and hitting partner before taking a position as International Squad Coach at the Lawn Tennis Association in London. As a fully qualified coach, he then worked with the best juniors in the country, both male and female, and oversaw their transition from the junior ranks to senior professionals. Goodall was selected as Great Britain's Federation Cup coach in 1995. He also worked with former world number four Tim Henman in the off-seasons at various stages throughout Henman's career, and travelled as his coach when his regular coach David Felgate was unavailable. ==Media== In 2000 Goodall started to pursue off-court work and began television commentary, writing and producing at various tennis events around the world. He has had articles published in various newspapers including The Times and the Wall Street Journal and currently commentates (often as part of a commentating duo alongside Robbie Koenig) for various broadcasters including the BBC, Eurosport International, the Tennis Channel and Al Jazeera in addition to work for both the ATP and WTA Tours at various events throughout the tennis season. Goodall is well known as a lead commentator, also known as a play-by-play commentator in North America, but he is also well-respected within the game as a colour commentator and as an analyst, where his area of expertise is technical and tactical analysis, often using Hawk-eye as a tool with which to enlighten viewers as to what might prove crucial in determining the outcome of matches. In 2014, Goodall, alongside Robbie Koenig, joined the International Premier Tennis League to provide commentary for the annual team tennis league which takes place in various cities in Asia throughout December. In 2015, Goodall joined ESPN to provide commentary and analysis during their tennis broadcasts, starting with the Australian Open. He has continued to work with ESPN at other Grand Slam events, including Wimbledon and the US Open. ==References== Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:English male tennis players Category:Tennis commentators Category:Sportspeople from Yorkshire Category:British male tennis players ","title":"Jason Goodall"},{"id":"35222758","text":"Zaker may refer to: *Zaker, East Azerbaijan, a village in East Azerbaijan Province, Iran *Zaker, Kerman, a village in Kerman Province, Iran *Zaker, Zanjan, a village in Zanjan Province, Iran *Zaker, Tarom, a village in Zanjan Province, Iran *Aly Zaker (born 1944), Bangladeshi actor and director *Sara Zaker, Bangladeshi actor, entrepreneur and social activist, wife of Aly Zaker ","title":"Zaker"},{"id":"35222775","text":"Dizzy in Greece is an album by trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, recorded in 1956 and 1957 and released on the Verve label.Gillespie discography accessed March 26, 2012 The album was reissued as part of the 2CD compilation Birks Works: The Verve Big Band Sessions.Yanow, S.

It has more than 3000 differences compared to the popular editions of the scripture. In November 2009 a controversy arose over this edition in Ayodhya, when the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad and Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas demanded an apology from Rambhadracharya over the Tulsi Peeth edition, accusing him of tampering with the epic. The author responded saying that he had merely edited extant copies of the epic and not modified the original epic. The dispute died down after Rambhadracharya expressed his regret for any annoyance or pain caused by the publication. A writ petition was also filed against him but it was dismissed. This edition was published in 2005 by Shri Tulsi Peeth Seva Nyas.Dinkar 2008, pp. 40–43.Nagar 2002, pp. 89–90. ==Differences in the Tulsi Peeth edition== The Ramcharitmanas was composed by Tulsidas in the late sixteenth century. It has been extremely popular in northern India over the last four hundred years, and is often referred to as the \\"Bible of northern India\\" by Western Indologists.The Bible of Northern India: * Lochtefeld 2001, p. 559. * Macfie 2004, p. vii. \\"The choice of the subtitle is no exaggeration. The book is indeed the Bible of Northern India\\". After nearly eight years of research, Rambharacharya came up with a critical edition of the Ramcharitmanas. Rambhadracharya says he has relied extensively on older manuscripts for the text of the epic. Ram Sagar Shukla notes the following differences in spelling, grammar, and prosodic conventions between the Tulsi Peeth edition and contemporary editions of the Ramcharitmanas.Rambhadracharya (ed) 2006, pp. 1–27. # Several present-day editions, including the one by the Gita Press, consider one chaupai verse to be a unit of 64 syllabic instants in two lines, where each line has two parts, each of 16 instants. Some other scholars count one chaupai verse as a unit of only 32 instants.Pandey 2008, p54. \\" [Hanuman Chalisa ... Its language is Awadhi. Metres are Doha and Chaupai. It consists of 40 Chaupais and 2 Dohas.]\\" Rambhadracharya has considered a chaupai to consist of 32 instants in one line, citing the examples of Hanuman Chalisa and the critique of Padmavat by Ramchandra Shukla in support. He says that the chaupai still has four feet, because of the ceasura after every eighth instant. # With some exceptions, for example when needed to satisfy prosodic constraints, in the Tulsi Peeth edition, words in the nominative and accusative cases do not end in the rounded vowel (Unicode उ, IPA ), as they do in present-day editions. Rambhadracharya considers such endings to be artefacts in the manuscripts, calling them unnatural in Awadhi. Most of the corresponding words in the text of Tulsi Peeth edition end in the central vowel (Unicode अ, IPA ) # The Tulsi Peeth edition does not use nasalised vowels (anunasika) to indicate case endings. According to Rambhadracharya, this is the same as in older editions, where the use of anunasika for case endings is absent. # In place of the conjunct nasal-fricative consonants nh (Unicode न्ह्, IPA ) and mh (Unicode म्ह्, IPA ) seen in accusative plural and second person pronoun usages in contemporary editions, the Tulsi Peeth edition has the single nasal consonants n (Unicode न्, IPA ) and m (Unicode म्, IPA ) respectively. # For Tadbhava words, the Tulsi Peeth edition uses the dental fricative s (Unicode स्, IPA ) instead of the palatal fricative ś (Unicode श्, IPA ) in the corresponding Tatsama form selectively, only at places where the replacement does not result in a faux pas. For example, the dental fricative is used in the word sobhā (सोभा, from Sanskrit śobhā, meaning splendour or brilliance) but the palatal fricative is unchanged in Śaṃkara (शंकर, a name for Shiva) where the replacement would result in Saṃkara (संकर), which means a child born out of wedlock.Rambhadracharya (ed) 2006, pp. 13–14. Contemporary editions use the dental fricative throughout. ==Controversy== Jagadguru Rambhadracarya presenting the critical edition of Ramacaritamanasa to the President of India, Pratibha Patil In November 2009 a controversy arose over this edition in Ayodhya, when the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad and Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas demanded an apology from Rambhadracharya over the Tulsi Peeth edition, accusing him of tampering with the epic. Accusations In a report in Times of India, Manjari Mishra and V N Arora accused Rambhadracharya of committing a \\"blasphemous act of challenging the mighty pen of the Goswami\\". Nritya Gopal Das, president of Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, was quoted by Times of India as saying, \\"How dare he ... he has committed an pardonable [sic] sin and must own it up\\". A Zee News report accused Rambhadracharya of \\"changing dohas to chaupais\\" and vice versa, \\"changing the wordings of several verses\\", and \\"renaming Laṅkākāṇḍa to Yuddhakāṇḍa\\". Zee News reported that a Mantra of page 59 of the edition called Rambhadracharya a Rishi, and quoted that The Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad chairperson Mahant Gyan Das as questioning how Rambhadracharya could be called a Rishi, a term used for the likes of Vamadeva, Jabali and Vasistha. Gyan Das and Nritya Gopal Das also accused the swami of \\"deleting certain verses and arbitrarily substituting news words\\". Gyan Das said that as per the meeting of Saints and Dharmacharyas, it was decided that Rambhadracharya should apologise till 8 November, otherwise a decision will be taken to remove Rambhadracharya from the post of Jagadguru in the proposed meeting of the Parishad on 10 November. Response by Rambhadracharya Times of India reported Rambhadracharya's disciples as denying the charges of deleting verses and substituting words. Rambhadracharya told Times of India that he had \\"merely edited, not altered the Ramcharitmanas published by Geata Press, Gorakhpur\\". He said that \\"they have pronounced me guilty without even going through my book\\", and added that the controversy was \\"a ploy to malign me and extort money\\". On the use of the word Rishi to refer to him, Zee News reported Rambhadracharya's response that a Rishi is somebody who sees a Mantra and in this sense he was a Rishi for the new Mantra he proposed for offering oblation to the Ramcharitmanas. Later in 2010, Dainik Jagaran and One India websites reported Rambhadracharya's response to the controversy, quoting him as saying that he had merely edited extant copies of the epic and not modified the original epic, similar to what Nanda Dulare Vajpayee had done for the Gita Press edition published in 1949. The dispute subsided on 8 November 2009, when Rambhadracharya sent a letter to the Akhara Parishad, expressing regret over any annoyance or pain caused by the publication of the Tulsi Peeth edition. In the letter, he requested the Akhara Parishad to consider older printed editions of the Ramcharitmanas as authentic, not others. The saints in Ayodhya expressed satisfaction over the language of the letter and decided to stop the protest against Rambhadracharya. Court case A writ petition filed in 2008 by Shiv Asray Asthana, publisher of the journal Prakhar Vichar, seeking the seizure and forfeiture of Rambhadracharya's critical edition on the grounds that it hurt religious sentiments, was dismissed by the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court in May 2011. Asthana was fined by the high court. Speaking to Dainik Jagran, Rambhadracharya termed the decision as a victory of the fundamental rights and announced a nine-day victory celebration. ==Critical Response== Several scholars of Hindi and Ramcharitmanas have reviewed the critical edition by Rambhadracharya. Prem Bhushan, a Kathavachak and discipline of Rambhadracharya, said that the \\"differences are mainly related to grammar and spelling\\". Ram Sagar Shukla, a retired correspondent of Prasar Bharti, wrote that \\"most of the corrections\\" in the Tulsi Peeth edition pertain to the language of the epic, while some relate to several episodes. Shukla disagreed with Rambhadracharya's opinion on the definition of Chaupai, saying that as per Pingala's definition a Chaupai has 64 instants, and that the title Hanuman Chalisa could also mean 40 half-Chaupais. Sunita Shastri, a scholar on Ramcharitmanas and advisor to Gita Press, told the Times of India that she examined the book for two hours and found \\"several verses missing\\" in the Ayodhyakand from the Tulsi Peeth edition. She quoted the verse dīpaśikhā sama juvati tana ... as missing. Ravindra Agnihotri, author in Sanskrit, Hindi and English, wrote that Rambahdracharya pointed to \\"more than 3000 mistakes in contemporary prevalent editions\\" including addition of verses and change of words, and added that the Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad and Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas should have praised his work instead of criticising him. ==NotesReferencesWorks cited== : : : : Category:Works by Rambhadracharya ","title":"Tulsi Peeth edition of the Ramcharitmanas"},{"id":"35222817","text":"Penstemon gibbensii is a species of flowering plant in the plantain family known by the common name Gibbens' beardtongue.

They have also performed live with singer Lynsey Cawthra, guitarists Ser Nik and Dave Pearson, as well as drummers and percussionists Sheikh Sticks and Karim Nashar. Komla was born in Ghana where he spent most of his childhood, and moved to England in his teenage years. Jim Tycho is originally from Southport (near Liverpool). They both met in Leeds in approximately 2001 while jamming with mutual friends and have continued to make music together ever since. The band officially formed in early 2008 and are described as a genre-crossing collective mixing electronica and jazz with hip hop, while also including elements of funk, reggae, trip hop, indie and world music. ==Formation== Tiger Shadow were formed in July 2008 after Jim & Komla had entered home recordings of \\"Terracotta Blues\\" and \\"Star Chaser\\" into a competition for Sandman magazine, which they won and this gave them their first gigs as a band at Reading & Leeds Festivals for BBC Introducing on 22 & 23 August 2008. Tiger Shadow did not exist as a band when the winning email was received, so Jim & Komla looked to musicians who they were working with at the time, and some with whom they had collaborated with for the previous 10 years, to form the first version of the band specifically to play at Reading & Leeds. Karim Nashar was drafted on drums / percussion; Dave Pearson on lead guitar; Kully Manik on guitar / bass and Lynsey Cawthra on vocals. Komla MC performed vox / drums / percussion and Jim Tycho completed this line-up on guitar / bass and programmed synths. Between 18 July & 22 August 2008, the band was formed and material was written / completed for performance at the festivals. ==The Rise of the Tiger Shadow== After the Leeds and Reading festivals were complete, Komla, Jim, Dave & Karim decided to record an album. September 2008 to January 2009 were spent writing and rehearsing new material. Between February and March 2009, The Rise of the Tiger Shadow was recorded at Cottage Road Studios in Headingley, Leeds by Matt Peel and Andy Hawkins. This was released through the band’s own record label (Tiger Shadow Music) via AWAL, and became available on iTunes and a number of other electronic stores from 20 April 2009.

The first EP, Stripe 1, was recorded at Cottage Road Studios with producer Matt Peel in September 2009. This was released through the band’s own record label (Tiger Shadow Music) via AWAL, and became available on iTunes and a number of other electronic stores from 2 November 2009. This EP marked a gradual move away from the rock / hip-hop combination of the first album, and started to see the introduction of a more electronic sound to the band, particularly via the use of the Korg Electribe EM-1. Track listing #Up & Down – 3:34 #I Knew You’d Be Alright – 3:06 #See You Next Tuesday – 4:04 ==Stripe 2 EP== Stripe 2 was recorded at Cottage Road Studios with producer Matt Peel in March 2010.

This publicly available information resource brings together over 97,000 environmental supervision records from government departments, at all levels and regions, throughout mainland China. These records, dating back as far as 2004, allow for the expansion of environmental information disclosure, enabling communities to fully understand the hazards and risks in the surrounding environment, thus promoting widespread public participation in environmental governance. With the improvements made to the IPE website and thus ‘China Pollution Map Database,’ over the last two years the number of official government-sourced violation records, from all regions in China, added to the ‘China Pollution Map Database,’ has grown by over 40,000; each having its own particular circumstances and need for a prompt and effective resolution. This important publicly available resource allows stakeholders, at all levels, to be informed, providing opportunities for individual and community inclusion, as well as NGO and media engagement. The IPE hopes this societal supervision of corporate and regional environmental performance and the external pressure on government will promote greater efforts towards enforcement and compliance, and in turn will provide a safer, cleaner and healthier environment for all. When developing and updating the ‘China Pollution Map Database,’ the IPE pays special attention to the annually published, government authored, List of Key State Monitored EnterprisesList of Key State Monitored Enterprises which according to set selection principles and methods, identifies those companies that occupy 65% of China’s industrial discharge volume, in traditionally heavy polluting industries. Through, often difficult, research and field visits, the IPE aims to continue the geographical positioning of the location of these companies. In continuation of this program, the IPE intends to continue arduously collecting, organizing and disseminating this environmental data, and information on corporate violations from around China. ==See also== *Pollution in China ==References *Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs *China Pollution Map Database *Blue Sky Roadmap Category:Databases in Asia Category:Environmental science databases Category:Pollution in China ","title":"China Pollution Map Database"},{"id":"35223229","text":"Partial family tree of the Abulafia family of Spain Jewish genealogy is the study of Jewish families and the tracing of their lineages and history. The Pentateuchal equivalent for \\"genealogies\\" is \\"toledot\\" (generations). In later Hebrew, as in Aramaic, the term and its derivatives \\"yiḥus\\" and \\"yuḥasin\\" recur with the implication of legitimacy or nobility of birth. In Modern Hebrew, genealogy is generally referred to as \\"שורשים\\"/\\"shorashim\\", the Hebrew word for roots, or borrowing from the English, \\"גנאלוגי\\"/\\"genealogi\\". Since Judaism is not only a religious community but an ethnic group that claims descent from common ancestry, there has been significant interest in tracing Jewish descent. To this day there are Jews who trace their descent from the ancient tribe of priests (kohanim) and levites (leviim) of the Jewish Bible and who still receive special recognition in areas such as the Jewish synagogue service.Genealogy. Encyclopaedia Judaica. Ed. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. Vol. 7. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. p428-438. Jacob Liver, Israel Moses Ta-Shma, Sara Schafler and Efraim Zadoff Due to the importance of Torah learning in the Jewish tradition, genealogical records of rabbis and Hasidic rebbes are carefully recorded and readily available.Schafler, Sara. Jewish Genealogy. Encyclopaedia Judaica year book. 1983/5. p. 68-69 The Holocaust was a significant factor in stimulating the research of Jewish genealogy. Many Jews were tormented by questions of what and who had been lost. In response, a number of genealogical agencies were created, including the International Tracing Service (ITS) in Arolsen, the Search Bureau for Missing Relatives in Jerusalem, and museum and resource Yad Vashem. CRARG (Czestochowa-Radomsko Area Research Group)(www.crarg.org) finds and translates Holocaust survivor lists and death lists from around Poland. Its database is one of the largest on the web, with over 300,000 records so far, covering hundreds of towns and consisting of more than 150 separate projects. ==Family pedigrees== Some Jewish families have preserved traditions relating to their tribal affiliation, based on partial genealogical records passed down generation after generation. In Yemen, for example, some Jews trace their lineage to Judah, others to Benjamin, while yet others to Levi and Reuben. Some Ashkenazi Jews have \\"Levi\\" and/or \\"Cohen\\" as surnames, probably because their ancestors were levites/cohanim. Of particular interest is one distinguished Jewish family of Yemen who traced their lineage to Bonai, one of the sons of Peretz, the son of Judah.This genealogical record, unfortunately, was broken off somewhere in the late or early 1500s. Nevertheless, it listed ninety-one successive generations, starting with Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham. A copy and description of this family's genealogy has been published in the book \\"Mi-Yetzirot Sifrutiyyot Mi-Teman\\" (Fragments of Literary Works from Yemen = מיצירות ספרותיות מתימן), Holon 1981, by Yehuda Levi Nahum, pp. 191-193 (Hebrew).

The episode was written by series co-creator Trey Parker and is rated TV-MA L in the United States. It premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on March 28, 2012. In the episode, the boys must deal with the fact that \\"Faith Hilling\\", the memetic trend in which they enjoy participating, is being supplanted in popularity by newer ones, including one that leads investigators to believe that cats are evolving in intelligence and have become a threat to humanity.\\"Episode 1603 Faith Hilling Press Release\\". South Park Studios. March 26, 2012 ==Plot== A new memetic trend emerges called \\"Faith Hilling\\", a derivative of planking, which involves having a picture of oneself taken while pulling the front of one's shirt forward in mock resemblance of women's breasts. After the boys perform this prank on stage at a 2012 Colorado Republican Presidential Debate, the entire fourth grade class of South Park Elementary is required to take a safety education class in which Professor Lamont teaches them the dangers of memetic trends with a graphic educational video showing people dying gruesome deaths when they are hit by trains while \\"Tebowing\\". Despite this, and a report by The Denver Post that Faith Hilling is considered passé and has been replaced with the newer trend of dragging one's nude buttocks across the floor or ground, or \\"Taylor Swifting\\", Stan and his friends continue Faith Hilling, even coming into conflict with Taylor Swifters. Professor Lamont is then informed by two unidentified men of a new Internet meme being practiced by another species: photos of cats with their heads poking through slices of bread. Lamont sees this as evidence that cats are evolving to become as intelligent as humans. This is a reference to Chapter eleven of Richard Dawkins book on evolution, The Selfish Gene, in which he suggests ideas, or as he calls them \\"memes\\", are the new replicators and a new kind of evolution. As this and newer memes continue to emerge among both people and cats, which in some instances results in the deaths of participants, the boys continue Faith Hilling, but after taunts and jeers by spectators, they are eventually forced, one by one, to come to terms with the fact that doing so is no longer in style. At the same time, Lamont and other humans attempt to communicate with the cats, which are now apparently capable of speech; the humans feel this represents a danger to mankind and will eventually lead to war between the two species. The boys attempt to remain current by participating in newer memes, including one that combines elements from previous memes and involves dragging one's nude buttocks across the floor while holding a cat with its head poking through a slice of bread. The boys attempt to perform this stunt at another Colorado Republican debate, but after Cartman storms the stage with his cat, he finds himself unable to continue, seeing that it is beneath him to adopt a meme simply because it is new. He aborts the intended prank, and instead takes a stand by doing what he really wants. He pulls his shirt out to simulate breasts, and begins to sing a number that spurs both the crowd and the Republicans (Rick Santorum, Mitt Romney, and Newt Gingrich) to join him in a massive act of group Faith Hilling. The episode concludes with a reporter claiming that the messages behind these latest memes is unclear, but it does not matter as long as audiences are given a song, celebrity bashing, and Republican hopefuls dancing around with breasts, a practice known as \\"pandering\\". As he goes on about the practice of \\"reporting\\", a train appears out of nowhere and immediately kills him. == Reception == Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a 7/10 \\"Good\\" rating.

He has taught at the University of Chicago and University of Georgia and been a fellow at the University of Georgia Institute for Behavioral Research (1977–1983), the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral and Social Sciences (1987–1988) in Stanford, CA, the National Humanities Center (1992–1993) in Research Triangle, NC, the Smithsonian Museum of National History in Washington, DC (1993), and the University of Georgia Humanities Center (1994). He has also been a Davis Fellow, Faculty of Social Sciences, Hebrew University (2002) in Jerusalem. In 2000, he received the William A. Owens Award for Outstanding Research and Creativity (University of Georgia); in 2009 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Hebrew University. ==Academic focus== Since the early 1980s, Schwartz has dedicated almost all his research to the problem of collective memory. His work affirms the perspectives of both realism and constructionism. However, Schwartz's realism is self-evident, for it denies any assertion that individual and collective memories are “constructed,” i.e., selectively reported, muted, or otherwise distorted, unless one possesses a plausible estimate of the past “as it essentially (not ‘actually’) was.” On the other hand, estimates of the past become even more plausible when the sources of their exaggerations, omissions, and other distortions are identified. For Schwartz, therefore, realism’s premise is modest: the meaning of events vary ceaselessly, and often significantly, but in the average situation that meaning is more often forced upon the observer by an event’s properties than imposed by observer’s categories of thought, sensitivity, worldview, or interests. Because the properties of past events are always inferred from incomplete information, reality cannot uniquely determine perception, but this does not mean that observers’ perceptual frames count more than reality in the remembering of most events most of the time. If the case were otherwise, memory and history would have no survival value. Accordingly, the following issues are encompassed within Schwartz's academic focus: the extent of collective memory's variation between and within generations; memory as an antidote to distorted history; reality as a limit to constructed memories; memory as a source of unity and conflict; the continuity of memory in the face of social change, and the enduring need of individuals to find orientation and meaning for their lives by invoking, embracing, rejecting, revising, and judging the past. ==Special Areas== Collective Memory Schwartz's effort to reconcile realism and constructionism is most evident in his collective memory studies, which include books and articles that trace Abraham Lincoln’s scholarly and popular images from his death in 1865 to present, and George Washington’s emergence and transformation as a national idol.Schwartz, Barry. 1991. \\"Social Change and Collective Memory: The Democratization of George Washington.\\" American Sociological Review 56: 221-236. His work on the distinctiveness of “The American Heroic Vision” includes beliefs and moral sentiments about Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon. Schwartz's comparative work includes the fate of Confucius before and after the Cultural Revolution, and studies of Korean, and Japanese memory, with special emphasis on the “history problem” in Northeast Asia. Memory as a source of honor and disgrace is addressed not only in Asian studies but also comparisons of Americans and Germans, Jewish and Arab Israelis. His current work includes an extension of his Gettysburg Address research into a book-length treatment of the Address's original and drastically changing meanings.Schwartz, Barry. 2005. “The New Gettysburg Address: Fusing History and Memory,” Poetics 33: 63-79. Schwartz's research on the historical Jesus, on which no contemporaneous written documentation exists, shows how the words and actions of this apocalyptic prophet can be assessed through the emergent memory of his followers and authenticated by sources external to the Gospels.Schwartz, Barry. 2013. “Where There’s Smoke, There’s Fire: History and Memory” (Introductory Chapter) and “The Past in the Present” (Respondent Chapter), in Tom Thatcher, ed. Keys and Frames: Memory and Identity in Ancient Judaism and Early Christianity. Leiden, Netherlands: SBL/Brill Series, Semeia Studies. Schwartz has recently brought the Jesus narratives to bear on Georg Simmel’s philosophy of history and its implications for the understanding of collective memory. Sociology of Knowledge Collective memory scholarship is a branch of the broader field of the sociology of knowledge. Schwartz’s contribution to the latter arises from the French tradition, notably, Emile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss’s Primitive Classification, and it expands Robert Hertz’s discoveries on the preeminence of the right hand and lateral symbolism, Claude Lévi-Strauss on binary classification, and Rodney Needham’s writings on symbolic classification systems. In his analysis of acquisition dates and content of the U.S. Capitol Building’s paintings, statues, busts, and friezes, for example, Schwartz finds art manifesting a binary structure of historically “hot” and “cold” periods. Elsewhere, he dissects the universal tendency to map social inequality into vertical oppositions, and he explains why vertical metaphors, without which inequalities could not be conceived, are a priori categories based on certain universals of social experience. Social Psychology Barry Schwartz's sociology of knowledge is informed by Emile Durkheim's cognitive sociology, but his earliest research reflects a different body of influence: interactional social psychology, as conceived especially by Georg Simmel, Erving Goffman, and George Homans. His interest in Simmel shows up in a decade of work on gift exchange, privacy, vengeance and forgiveness, mental life of suburbia, queuing phenomena, priority and social process, waiting and social power. His research inside a juvenile penal institution qualifies Goffman's observations on “total institutions” by demonstrating that behavior within the setting reflects characteristics that youngsters bring into it at least as much as the structure of the setting itself. Analysis of the dynamics of the home advantage in four different sports applies George Homans’ account of reinforcement to explain another aspect of interaction, namely, how spectator behavior affects player performance. ==Summary== The path of Barry Schwartz's work runs from interactional social psychology to cognitive sociology, the sociology of knowledge, and collective memory. The last, major, phase cannot be inferred from the first but is inextricably connected to it. ==Selected bibliography== * Queuing and Waiting: Studies in the Social Organization of Access and Delay.

The center of the Universe is a concept that lacks a coherent definition in modern astronomy; according to standard cosmological theories on the shape of the universe, it has no center. Historically, different people have suggested various locations as the center of the Universe. Many mythological cosmologies included an axis mundi, the central axis of a flat Earth that connects the Earth, heavens, and other realms together. In the 4th century BCE Greece, philosophers developed the geocentric model, based on astronomical observation; this model proposed that the center of the Universe lies at the center of a spherical, stationary Earth, around which the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars rotate. With the development of the heliocentric model by Nicolaus Copernicus in the 16th century, the Sun was believed to be the center of the Universe, with the planets (including Earth) and stars orbiting it. In the early-20th century, the discovery of other galaxies and the development of the Big Bang theory led to the development of cosmological models of a homogeneous, isotropic Universe, which lacks a central point and is expanding at all points. ==Outside astronomy== In religion or mythology, the axis mundi (also cosmic axis, world axis, world pillar, columna cerului, center of the world) is a point described as the center of the world, the connection between it and Heaven, or both. Mount Hermon in Lebanon was regarded in some cultures as the axis mundi. Mount Hermon was regarded as the axis mundi in Canaanite tradition, from where the sons of God are introduced descending in 1 Enoch (1En6:6). The ancient Greeks regarded several sites as places of earth's omphalos (navel) stone, notably the oracle at Delphi, while still maintaining a belief in a cosmic world tree and in Mount Olympus as the abode of the gods. Judaism has the Temple Mount and Mount Sinai, Christianity has the Mount of Olives and Calvary, Islam has Mecca, said to be the place on earth that was created first, and the Temple Mount (Dome of the Rock). In Shinto, the Ise Shrine is the omphalos. In addition to the Kun Lun Mountains, where it is believed the peach tree of immortality is located, the Chinese folk religion recognizes four other specific mountains as pillars of the world. A 1581 map depicting Jerusalem as the center of the world. Sacred places constitute world centers (omphalos) with the altar or place of prayer as the axis. Altars, incense sticks, candles and torches form the axis by sending a column of smoke, and prayer, toward heaven. The architecture of sacred places often reflects this role. \\"Every temple or palace--and by extension, every sacred city or royal residence--is a Sacred Mountain, thus becoming a Centre.\\"Mircea Eliade (tr. Willard Trask). 'Archetypes and Repetition' in The Myth of the Eternal Return. Princeton, 1971. p.12 The stupa of Hinduism, and later Buddhism, reflects Mount Meru. Cathedrals are laid out in the form of a cross, with the vertical bar representing the union of Earth and heaven as the horizontal bars represent union of people to one another, with the altar at the intersection. Pagoda structures in Asian temples take the form of a stairway linking Earth and heaven. A steeple in a church or a minaret in a mosque also serve as connections of Earth and heaven. Structures such as the maypole, derived from the Saxons' Irminsul, and the totem pole among indigenous peoples of the Americas also represent world axes. The calumet, or sacred pipe, represents a column of smoke (the soul) rising form a world center.Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. The Penguin Dictionary of Symbols. Editions Robert Lafont S. A. et Editions Jupiter: Paris, 1982. Penguin Books: London, 1996. pp.148-149 A mandala creates a world center within the boundaries of its two-dimensional space analogous to that created in three-dimensional space by a shrine.Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. p.52-54 In medieval times some Christians thought of Jerusalem as the center of the world (Latin: umbilicus mundi, Greek: Omphalos), and was so represented in the so- called T and O maps. Byzantine hymns speak of the Cross being \\"planted in the center of the earth.\\" ==Center of a flat Earth== The Flammarion engraving (1888) depicts a traveller who arrives at the edge of a Flat Earth and sticks his head through the firmament. The Flat Earth model is a belief that the Earth's shape is a plane or disk covered by a firmament containing heavenly bodies. Most pre-scientific cultures have had conceptions of a Flat Earth, including Greece until the classical period, the Bronze Age and Iron Age civilizations of the Near East until the Hellenistic period, India until the Gupta period (early centuries AD) and China until the 17th century. It was also typically held in the aboriginal cultures of the Americas, and a flat Earth domed by the firmament in the shape of an inverted bowl is common in pre-scientific societies.\\"Their cosmography as far as we know anything about it was practically of one type up til the time of the white man's arrival upon the scene. That of the Borneo Dayaks may furnish us with some idea of it. 'They consider the Earth to be a flat surface, whilst the heavens are a dome, a kind of glass shade which covers the Earth and comes in contact with it at the horizon.'\\" Lucien Levy-Bruhl, Primitive Mentality (repr. Boston: Beacon, 1966) 353; \\"The usual primitive conception of the world's form ... [is] flat and round below and surmounted above by a solid firmament in the shape of an inverted bowl.\\" H. B. Alexander, The Mythology of All Races 10: North American (repr. New York: Cooper Square, 1964) 249. \\"Center\\" is well-defined in a Flat Earth model. A flat Earth would have a definite geographic center. There would also be a unique point at the exact center of a spherical firmament (or a firmament that was a half-sphere). ==Earth as the center of the Universe== The Flat Earth model gave way to an understanding of a Spherical Earth. Aristotle (384-322 BCE) provided observational arguments supporting the idea of a spherical Earth, namely that different stars are visible in different locations, travelers going south see southern constellations rise higher above the horizon, and the shadow of Earth on the Moon during a lunar eclipse is round, and spheres cast circular shadows while discs generally do not. This understanding was accompanied by models of the Universe that depicted the Sun, Moon, stars, and naked eye planets circling the spherical Earth, including the noteworthy models of Aristotle (see Aristotelian physics) and Ptolemy. This geocentric model was the dominant model from the 4th century BCE until the 17th century CE. ==Sun as center of the Universe== The heliocentric model from Nicolaus Copernicus' De revolutionibus orbium coelestium Heliocentrism, or heliocentricism,Teaching about Evolution and the Nature of Science (National Academy of Sciences, 1998), p.27; also, Don O' Leary, Roman Catholicism and Modern Science: A History (Continuum Books, 2006), p.5.Copernican heliocenterism held that the Sun itself was the center of the entire Universe. As it is modernly understood, Heliocenterism refers to the much narrower concept that the Sun is the center of the Solar System, not the center of the entire Universe. is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around a relatively stationary Sun at the center of the Solar System. The word comes from the Greek ( helios \\"sun\\" and kentron \\"center\\"). The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BCE by Aristarchus of Samos,The work of Aristarchus's in which he proposed his heliocentric system has not survived. We only know of it now from a brief passage in Archimedes's The Sand Reckoner. but had received no support from most other ancient astronomers. Nicolaus Copernicus' major theory of a heliocentric model was published in De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres), in 1543, the year of his death, though he had formulated the theory several decades earlier. Copernicus' ideas were not immediately accepted, but they did begin a paradigm shift away from the Ptolemaic geocentric model to a heliocentric model. The Copernican revolution, as this paradigm shift would come to be called, would last until Isaac Newton’s work over a century later. Johannes Kepler published his first two laws about planetary motion in 1609, having found them by analyzing the astronomical observations of Tycho Brahe. Kepler's third law was published in 1619. The first law was \\"The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.\\" On 7 January 1610 Galileo used his telescope, with optics superior to what had been available before. He described \\"three fixed stars, totally invisiblei.e., invisible to the naked eye. by their smallness\\", all close to Jupiter, and lying on a straight line through it. Observations on subsequent nights showed that the positions of these \\"stars\\" relative to Jupiter were changing in a way that would have been inexplicable if they had really been fixed stars. On 10 January Galileo noted that one of them had disappeared, an observation which he attributed to its being hidden behind Jupiter. Within a few days he concluded that they were orbiting Jupiter:In Sidereus Nuncius,1892, 3:81 Galileo stated that he had reached this conclusion on 11 January. He had discovered three of Jupiter's four largest satellites (moons). He discovered the fourth on 13 January. His observations of the satellites of Jupiter created a revolution in astronomy: a planet with smaller planets orbiting it did not conform to the principles of Aristotelian Cosmology, which held that all heavenly bodies should circle the Earth. Many astronomers and philosophers initially refused to believe that Galileo could have discovered such a thing; by showing that, like Earth, other planets could also have moons of their own that followed prescribed paths, and hence that orbital mechanics didn't apply only to the Earth, planets, and Sun, what Galileo had essentially done was to show that other planets might be \\"like Earth\\". Newton made clear his heliocentric view of the Solar System – developed in a somewhat modern way, because already in the mid-1680s he recognised the \\"deviation of the Sun\\" from the centre of gravity of the solar system.See Curtis Wilson, \\"The Newtonian achievement in astronomy\\", pages 233–274 in R Taton & C Wilson (eds) (1989) The General History of Astronomy, Volume, 2A', at page 233. For Newton, it was not precisely the centre of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but rather \\"the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World\\", and this centre of gravity \\"either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line\\" (Newton adopted the \\"at rest\\" alternative in view of common consent that the centre, wherever it was, was at rest).Text quotations are from 1729 translation of Newton's Principia, Book 3 (1729 vol.2) at pages 232–233. ==Milky Way's galactic center as center of the Universe== Before the 1920s, it was generally believed that there were no galaxies other than our own (see for example The Great Debate). Thus, to astronomers of previous centuries, there was no distinction between a hypothetical center of the galaxy and a hypothetical center of the universe. Great Andromeda Nebula by Isaac Roberts (1899) In 1750 Thomas Wright, in his work An original theory or new hypothesis of the Universe, correctly speculated that the Milky Way might be a body of a huge number of stars held together by gravitational forces rotating about a Galactic Center, akin to the Solar System but on a much larger scale. The resulting disk of stars can be seen as a band on the sky from our perspective inside the disk. In a treatise in 1755, Immanuel Kant elaborated on Wright's idea about the structure of the Milky Way. In 1785, William Herschel proposed such a model based on observation and measurement, leading to scientific acceptance of galactocentrism, a form of heliocentrism with the Sun at the center of the Milky Way. The 19th century astronomer Johann Heinrich von Mädler proposed the Central Sun Hypothesis, according to which the stars of the universe revolved around a point in the Pleiades. ==The nonexistence of a center of the Universe== In 1917, Heber Doust Curtis observed a nova within what then was called the \\"Andromeda Nebula\\". Searching the photographic record, 11 more novae were discovered. Curtis noticed that novas in Andromeda were drastically fainter than novas in the Milky Way. Based on this, Curtis was able to estimate that Andromeda was 500,000 light-years away. As a result, Curtis became a proponent of the so-called \\"island Universes\\" hypothesis, which held that objects previously believed to be spiral nebulae within the Milky Way were actually independent galaxies. In 1920, the Great Debate between Harlow Shapley and Curtis took place, concerning the nature of the Milky Way, spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the Universe. To support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula (M31) was an external galaxy, Curtis also noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in our own galaxy, as well as the significant Doppler shift. In 1922 Ernst Öpik presented an elegant and simple astrophysical method to estimate the distance of M31. His result put the Andromeda Nebula far outside our galaxy at a distance of about 450,000 parsec, which is about 1,500,000 ly. Edwin Hubble settled the debate about whether other galaxies exist in 1925 when he identified extragalactic Cepheid variable stars for the first time on astronomical photos of M31. These were made using the 2.5 metre (100 in) Hooker telescope, and they enabled the distance of Great Andromeda Nebula to be determined. His measurement demonstrated conclusively that this feature was not a cluster of stars and gas within our galaxy, but an entirely separate galaxy located a significant distance from our own. This proved the existence of other galaxies. Expanding Universe Hubble also demonstrated that the redshift of other galaxies is approximately proportional to their distance from the Earth (Hubble's law). This raised the appearance of our galaxy being in the center of an expanding Universe, however, Hubble rejected the findings philosophically: The redshift observations of Hubble, in which galaxies appear to be moving away from us at a rate proportional to their distance from us, are now understood to be a result of the metric expansion of space. This is the increase of the distance between two distant parts of the Universe with time, and is an intrinsic expansion whereby the scale of space itself changes. As Hubble theorized, all observers anywhere in the Universe will observe a similar effect. Copernican and cosmological principles The Copernican principle, named after Nicolaus Copernicus, states that the Earth is not in a central, specially favored position. Hermann Bondi named the principle after Copernicus in the mid-20th century, although the principle itself dates back to the 16th-17th century paradigm shift away from the geocentric Ptolemaic system. The cosmological principle is an extension of the Copernican principle which states that the Universe is homogeneous (the same observational evidence is available to observers at different locations in the Universe) and isotropic (the same observational evidence is available by looking in any direction in the Universe). A homogeneous, isotropic Universe does not have a center. ==See also== * Cosmic microwave background * Earth's inner core * Galactic Center * Geographical centre of Earth * Great Attractor * Illustris project * Multiverse * Religious cosmology * Three-torus model of the universe == Notes  References == Center of the Universe Center of the Universe Category:Physical cosmology Category:Obsolete scientific theories ","title":"History of the center of the Universe"},{"id":"35223723","text":"Penstemon grahamii, known by the common names Uinta Basin beardtongue and Graham's beardtongue, is a species of flowering plant in the plantain family.

They are hairy, and in the inflorescence, glandular. The leaves are thick, leathery, and dark green to grayish in color. The basal leaves narrow toward the stem, and the upper leaves clasp the stem. The tubular flowers are between 3 and 4 centimeters long and pink to lavender in color with reddish nectar guides in the throat. The yellow, bearded staminode protrudes from the mouth of the flower. Blooming occurs in May and June. This species is limited to calcareous shale originating from the Green River Formation in northeastern Utah and adjacent Rio Blanco County, Colorado. It grows in desert shrubland and pinyon-juniper woodland habitat. Much of the terrain occupied by the plant contains oil shale, a valuable source of petroleum. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the plant with threatened status in 2006 when it appeared that extensive petroleum exploration could endanger the plant. The Service sought data from scientists, as well as from the Bureau of Land Management, which oversees 60% of the plant's habitat and leases land for petroleum exploration.

All three of Ring of Honor's championships were defended throughout the course of the weekend. The ROH World Championship was defended in a three-way match between champion Davey Richards, his former tag team partner Eddie Edwards and their mutual long-term rival Roderick Strong. All three wrestlers were scheduled for a \\"Blind Destiny\\" match on the second day, with the winner having to defend the championship against their respective opponent: Michael Elgin, Kevin Steen and Jay Lethal. ROH World Television Champion Jay Lethal defended his title against Kyle O'Reilly on the first day, while the ROH World Tag Team Championship were defended on the second day, by the Briscoe Brothers (Jay and Mark) against former champions Wrestling's Greatest Tag Team (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin). Also on the card, the Young Bucks (Nick and Matt Jackson) faced the All Night Express (Kenny King and Rhett Titus) in tag team matches on both nights, with differing stipulations.

Built in Japan in 1966, it was purchased by Sulpicio Lines in the mid-1970s and renamed the MV Doña Marilyn. In the afternoon of October 24, 1988, while sailing from Manila to Tacloban City, the vessel was caught up in Typhoon Ruby and sank near Higatangan (or Gigatangan) Island, Biliran.\\"MV Princess of the Stars – Sulpicio Lines – Maritime disasters\\". Biliran Blogs. July 2, 2008. leaving approximately 400 dead or missing, while survivors numbered at least 181. Doña Marilyn was a sister ship of the ill- fated , which sank a year earlier in the deadliest ever peace-time maritime disaster. ==Sinking== The MV Doña Marilyn left Manila on October 23, 1988, at 10 am, heading for Tacloban City in Eastern Visayas. At least 511 people were on board the ship when it left the city, including the ship's complement; according to Vicente Gambito, Vice President of Sulpicio Lines, there were a total of 421 passengers. The ship's captain, Eliodoro Salgado Jr., had been with Sulpicio Lines for five months when he commanded the MV Doña Marilyn on October 23. On October 24 at 2:14 am, Capt. Salgado sent a message to the coastal station of Sulpicio Lines in Manila about the large waves encountered by the ship, with him deciding to slow down the engine. By 7:28 am, Salgado had the engines stopped due to \\"very strong winds and big waves\\". Nearly an hour later, the captain informed the station that he decided to reverse course and head toward the North Gigantes island for safety, while adding that the vessel is expected to arrive at Tacloban around 8 pm later that day. By 1:30 pm, the Doña Marilyn radioed a distress signal off of Tanguingui Island (earlier reported as Manoc-Manoc island), close to Masbate, which would be the last signal from the ferry received by the station according to military officials. Due to strong winds and giant waves caused by Typhoon Ruby (locally known as Typhoon Unsang), the ship capsized at around 2 pm. According to survivors, Captain Salgado told them to pray the rosary before he jumped ship, but he eventually became missing. Many who survived were easily spotted by rescuers due to their life jackets, while others were saved by fishermen passing by. Some survivors, however, were robbed by bandits with motorized canoes. One survivor, the ship's purser Kerwin Lim, reached the shore of Almagro Island after nearly a day at sea, but was later found robbed and murdered with red marks on his neck. Aftermath During the Senate's inquiry into the disaster, where evidence such as the logbook of Sulpicio Lines were presented, Senator John Osmeña argued that because the shipping line and the Coast Guard knew about a typhoon nearing Tacloban from PAGASA, they should have been able to advise Captain Salgado to turn away from its destination before the typhoon reached Signal No. 3. On October 31, Corazon Alma de Leon from the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) stated that Sulpicio Lines has agreed to provide ₱50,000 to each of the families of those who perished. Two days later, after Transportation and Communications Secretary Rainerio Reyes met with President Corazon Aquino, Reyes announced an indefinite suspension of all ferries operated by Sulpicio Lines from leaving their respective ports. However, the shipping line defied the order and continued operating, demanding a formal order be given to them before they suspend ferry operations. Eventually, an inter-agency committee was formed on November 5 to inspect all commercial Philippine vessels, and on the same day grounded all ships of Sulpicio Lines as it inspected the line's MV Cotabato Princesa ferry. A few days after the committee was formed, the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) suspended 14 further cargo and passenger vessels after inspecting 216 of them across the country due to malfunctioning navigational and communication facilities, so as to heighten standards for sea faring vessels after the Doña Marilyn incident. The wreck of Doña Marilyn was first sighted by a fisherman named Bonifacio Rodrigo, who reportedly saw the sunken vessel in November 10 while he was diving in an area near Manoc-manoc Island (also known as La Manok Island). Three weeks after the ship's sinking, Eliodoro Salgado Sr., the father of Capt. Salgado, offered to help the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) under Ramon Barrot in finding his son, who at the time was reportedly hiding in Maripipi Island in the province of Biliran. Some survivors such as Alex Moron Jr. claimed seeing him board a life raft after he abandoned ship. Soon after, NBI senior agent Zosimo Pebrero confirmed Capt. Salgado's presence in Barangay Ol-og, Maripipi, and a monetary reward of ₱50,000 was set for whoever was able to capture him. According to Speaker Pro Tempore Antonio Cuenco who was leading the search for Salgado, barangay officials refused to cooperate with NBI officials when they arrived on the island, and thus stated that he could be compelled to request for their arrests if necessary. The wreck of the ship now lies off the island of Malapascua, where it has been made into a diving attraction.

Vicente Gambito, Sulpicio Lines Vice President, placed the figure at 197. According to Gambito, 46 of the survivors were not on the ship's manifest, while Lynette Ordoñez of the Manila Standard stated it was at least 101. ==See also== *MV Doña Paz *MV Princess of the Orient *List of shipwrecks in 1988 ==References== Category:1966 ships Category:1988 in the Philippines Category:Ferries of the Philippines Category:Maritime incidents in 1988 Category:Maritime incidents in the Philippines ","title":"MV Doña Marilyn"},{"id":"35224218","text":"A Professor of Law at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa William S.

In the best- seller, he exposed how the Estate had been corrupted by the state's political apparatus and its trustees for their personal use at the expense of Kamehameha; a group of trustees who included, among others, Hawaii Supreme Court justices and prominent politicians; trustees were earning salaries of nearly $950,000 for their work as such. ==References * Randall Roth * Broken Trust Category:Living people Category:University of Hawaii faculty Category:Writers from Kansas Category:Hawaii lawyers Category:Hawaii law Category:University of Denver alumni Category:Regis College alumni Category:American legal scholars Category:American legal writers Category:William S.

John had three siblings, of which two survived (a younger brother Jonathan (1744–1806) and one other): the third died at young age (Jonathan, the eldest). John and the younger brother Jonathan are often confused in literature and publications. While John worked for a long time in Amsterdam, Jonathan worked n Rotterdam, both in the same line of work. John studied with the prominent London instrument maker James Champneys and when Champney moved to Amsterdamaccording to some sources after a bankruptcy: other sources deny this (Bryden 1977) in December 1768 Cuthbertson joined him. On 1 September 1768 John had married Champney's daughter Jane. They had four children, three sons and a daughter, but only the daughter, Jane Cuthberson, survived. In 1782 Cuthbertson published a book in Dutch called Algemeene Eigenschappen van Electriciteit, onderrichting van de Werktuigen en het nemen van proeven in dezelve (free translation: \\"General characteristics of electricity, education on the tools and the performing of tests in those\\") and also organized public lectures, both to disseminate the knowledge about electricity, in his opinion very poor in the Netherlands. The book was quite popular in the Netherlands, and lead him to publish another two volumes with even more possible experiments. In all his publications Cuthbertson seems to concentrate on the glass plate generators and not on the cylindrical ones, possibly because he was involved in the production of the glass plate generators. In 1783–1784 he used the suggestions of Martinus van Marum, who also had a history of designing electrostatic generators and who had already been in touch with Cuthbertson, in 1774 and 1781, to build the (at that time) largest glass plate electrostatic generator in existence for the Teylers Tweede Genootschap of the Teylers Stichting. It had disks with a diameter of and was connected to a battery of Leyden jars to store the charge produced. With this machine a 61 cm (2 ft) spark could be produced of, which comes down to roughly 330.000 Volt. Van Marum believed that with larger machines, currents and charges more scientific progress could be made. The machine was based on a smaller model produced by Jonathan Cuthbertson shortly before, but with some significant changes, such as glass poles instead of wooden ones. Based on empirical studies Cuthbertson made changes to the scaled-up model. Finally the machine was installed in December 1784 and he received the sum of 3000 guilders for it. Sometime between 1793 and 1796 he returned to England, living in Poland Street in London (contrary to his brother Jonathan who remained in Rotterdam), probably due to the political unrest in the Dutch Republic. Here he continued his business and produced a number of smaller (simplified) electrostatic generators – a design that would be produced until the 1920s.D. J. Bryden, The British Journal for the History of Science (1977), 10 : pp 77-77 He also worked on electrometers, for which he invented a new design, air pumps and wrote scientific papers. In 1807 Cuthbertson published Practical Electricity and Galvanism. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. This book was partly intended to encourage the sale of scientific instruments for home or school experiments and partly to explain the medical uses of electricity. The home experiments are described as ‘easy and pleasing to the young practitioner’.The use of static electrical charges and low intensity electrical currents on the human body, known as galvanism, was often used both to treat mental illness and to revive people after drowning or lightning strikes. Almost all conditions, including gout, fever, hydrocephalus, blindness, deafness and genitor-urinary infections were supposed to be treatable by the application of electricity. For Rees's Cyclopædia he contributed articles about electricity, but the topics are not known. He died in 1821 and was buried in St James's Church, Piccadilly. == Notes References== * *Teylers Museum: Elektriseermachine * Category:1743 births Category:1821 deaths Category:English inventors Category:British scientific instrument makers Category:People from Allerdale Category:British expatriates in the Netherlands ","title":"John Cuthbertson (instrument maker)"},{"id":"35224342","text":"Sigurd Gotaas (21 December 1863 – 1944) was a Norwegian physician and sportsman.

It was commissioned by the Kiev Military Districts political office for the District Song and Dance Ensemble, as part of a suite in honour of Grigory Kotovsky, leader of two Moldovan rebellions in Bessarabia Governorate against the Russian Empire in 1905 and 1915. It is written in the style of a Moldovan folk song. The song was intended to glorify the female partisans of the Russian Civil War. The lyrics tell how the singer met a pretty girl gathering grapes and tried to seduce her, but how the girl turns out to be a partisan, and convinces him to join the partisans as well. The song was not performed as part of the suite as it was considered too frivolous. In 1940, songs composed for the troops on the front were supposed to be about revenge and victory. By 1942, fashions had changed, and songs with more romantic or lyrical themes were accepted by the military, so Novikov decided to re-release a revised version of the song. But it was again shelved for another two years, and its first performance came in 1944, in the Tchaikovsky Concert Hall in Moscow, by the Alexandrov Ensemble, with soloist Nikolaiy Ustinov. It was an immediate success, and had to be repeated three times as the audience requested encores. Because the song became famous outside of its original context of the Kotovsky Suite, it was taken as a reference to the then-contemporary Soviet partisans of the Great Patriotic War (WWII). Goncharova (2010) notes that the image of the pretty Moldovan partisan is a lyrical fantasy, as out of some 3,000 known Soviet partisans active in Moldova, few were ethnic Moldovans. Smuglyanka was used in the 1973 Soviet film Only \\"Old Men\\" Are Going to Battle (), an \\"easy movie about love, airplanes and girls\\" (Goncharova 2010). In the film, a young fighter pilot introduces the song to his squadron and so gets nicknamed \\"the dark girl\\". The film was first shown on 27 December 1973. Hero of the Soviet Union Alexander Pokryshkin was reportedly wiping his eyes as the lights came back on. The film became a blockbuster, seen by 54 million viewers within five months, and Smuglyanka as a consequence became known throughout the Soviet Union, entering the standard repertoire of Russian folk songs. Shvedov had not been told about the use of his song in the film, and learned about it from movie-going friends. ==Lyrics== { style=\\"width:100%\\" - valign=top\\"  Как-то летом, на рассвете, Заглянул в соседний сад. Там смуглянка-молдаванка Собирает виноград. Я краснею, я бледнею, Захотелось вдруг сказать: — Станем над рекою Зорьки летние встречать! :Припев × 2: :Раскудрявый клён зелёный –лист резной. :Я влюблённый и смущённый пред тобой. :Клён зелёный, да клён кудрявый, :Да раскудрявый, резной. А смуглянка-молдаванка Отвечала парню в лад: — Партизанский, молдаванский Собираем мы отряд. Нынче рано партизаны Дом покинули родной. Ждёт тебя дорога К партизанам в лес густой. :Припев × 2: :Раскудрявый клён зелёный – лист резной. :Здесь у клёна мы расстанемся с тобой. :Клён зелёный, да клён кудрявый, :Да раскудрявый, резной. И смуглянка-молдаванка По тропинке в лес ушла. В том обиду я увидел, Что с собой не позвала. О смуглянке-молдаванке Часто думал по ночам … Вдруг свою смуглянку Я в отряде повстречал. :Припев × 2: :Раскудрявый клён зелёный – лист резной. :Здравствуй, парень, мой хороший, мой родной! :Клён зелёный, да клён кудрявый, :Да раскудрявый, резной.  Kak-to letom, na rassvete Zaglianul v sosedniy sad. Tam smuglianka-moldavanka Sobirayet vinograd. Ya krasneiu, Ya bledneyu, Zakhotelos vdrug skazat: Stanem nad rekoyu Zorki letniye vstrechat! :Chorus × 2: :Raskudriavy klion zeliony, list reznoy, :Ia vliublionny i smushchenny pred toboy :Klion zeliony, da klion kudriavy, :Da raskudriavy, reznoy! A smuglianka-moldavanka Otvechala parnyu v lad: — Partizanski, moldavanskii Sobiraem mij otriad. Nynche rano partizany Dom pokinuli rodnoy. Zhdiot tebia doroga K partizanam v les gustoy. :Chorus × 2: :Raskudriavy klion zelyony, list reznoy, :Zdies u kliona mij rastanemsya s toboy, :Klen zelyony, da klen kudriavy, :Da raskudriavy, reznoy! I smuglianka-moldavanka Po tropinke v les ushla. V tom obidu ia uvidel, Shto s soboj ne pozvala. O smuglianke-moldavanke Chasto dumal po nocham... Vdrug svoyu smuglianku Ia v otriade povstrechal. :Chorus x2: :Raskudriavy klion zelyony, list reznoy, :Zdrastvuy, paren, moi khoroshi, moi rodnoy! :Klion zelyony, da klion kudriavy, :Da raskudriavy, reznoy!  One summer, at dawn, I glanced into the neighboring garden. There a dark woman, a Moldovan Was picking grapes. I blushed, I grew pale, I suddenly wanted to say \\"Let's go greet summer dawns over the river!\\" :Chorus × 2: :The maple all curly and green, its leaves as if carved! :I'm in love and abashed in front of you. :The maple is green and curly, :and curly and carved! But the dark woman, the Moldovan Said to the lad: \\"For Moldovan partisans we today recruit a squad. Early today the partisans left the homes where they were born. That same road now awaits you, the road to join them in the forest.\\" :Chorus × 2: :The maple all curly and green, its leaves as if carved! :Here, under the maple, we will part. :The maple is green and curly, :and all curly and carved. Then the dark one, the Moldovan Took the path into the woods. I was hurt that she left me without suggesting I come too. Of the dark one, the Moldovan Thought I often in the nights … Then in the forest, of a sudden, I found my dark one in the ranks! :Chorus × 2: :The maple is curly and green, :its leaves as if carved. :Hello, my dear, my good lad! :The maple is green and curly, :all curly and carved. } ==References== *Yuliya Goncharova (Юлия Гончарова, Shvedov's granddaughter) \\"Смуглянку\\" не пускали на фронт.

He graduated from Tientsin Anglo-Chinese College in 1925. During the period of 1925 to 1929, he studied business in University of Birmingham and lived in Linxi College located in the suburbs. At the party organized by the students of this college, Huang Zuolin performed the one-act play, East and West, which was written and directed by himself. Then Huang Zuolin sent this play to George Bernard Shaw to express the worship of him and Henrik Ibsen and got a reply: \\"Ibsen, is a disciple, not a master; George Bernard Shaw, is a follower, not a master; Ibsen does not belong to ibsenist, he is Ibsen; I do not belong to Bernard shawnist, I am Bernard shaw; If you want to have some achievements, you should not be a disciple; You must be creative.\\" From that point on, George Bernard Shaw became Huang Zuolin's first teacher who introduced art to him and was revered by him all his life. In 1929, Huang Zuolin returned to China and served as honorary president of Tientsin Anglo-Chinese College. In 1935, he, together with his wife Jin Yunzhi (Danny), once again traveled to Britain to study Shakespeare in King’s College at Cambridge University and learn dramatic direction from the famous French director Michel Saint-Denis in London Drama Academy. He earned his M.A. degree from Cambridge University in 1937. He returned to China after the breakout of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Before Huang’s departure, Shaw sent him the following words: \\"Rise up, China! You are the future of the eastern world. If you have courage and determination to hold it, the future stage will be for Chinese drama. Don't follow my plays, you can create your own.\\" In 1938, he taught in Chongqing National Drama Institute. Then he rehearsed and played The True Story of Ah QA short story written by Lu Xun as well as teaching. He reached Shanghai in 1939, serving successively as director of the Shanghai Theater Society, Shanghai Professional Theatrical Troupe, and Shanghai Art Troupe. In 1942, under the tenet of \\"working together and working hard\\", Huang Zuolin, along with Huang Zongjiang and Shihui, established the Hardworking Opera Troupe, which was later renamed the Hardworking Drama Training Institute where they directed Liang Shang Jun Zi (梁上君子) and The inn at night. In the autumn of 1946, he took part in the establishment of Wenhua Film Company and worked as a director. The first film he directed was a satirical comedy called Phony Phoenixes. He used strong comedy expression to satirise the prevailing atmosphere of deception in that society. The film was the first one in China which was dubbed into English and exported to foreign countries. Later, he also directed many films, such as Night Inn and Corruption. In 1949, Huang Zuolin adapted and directed the film The Watch, which was unique and had a different method of expression from traditional films. He employed some amateurs and little-known performers, among whom were orphans from the orphanage and street children. The film was listed, by French film historian Georges Sadoul, as one of the few famous Chinese films in the general history of the world’s film. At the end of 1948, Huang Zuolin took part in the preparation work for an underground Association of Film Workers. In 1950 he became one of the co-founders of Shanghai People’s Art Theater, successively serving as assistant dean, dean and emeritus dean for forty-four years. In 1962, he proposed a creative view on drama of depicted desires and advocated a Chinese contemporary, ethnical, and scientific dramatic system. In 1989, he wrote \\"I stand for the concept of enjoyable drama because of the 50 or 60-year-long practice on stage, the assiduous research into world dramatic development history and the following well-known sayings: True and false dramas are all pleasant. It will not be a drama if it does not resemble [life]. It is a drama as well as an art. There are three types of paintings: the first ones are those extraordinarily similar to the object, which are false paintings. The second ones are those not similar to the objects at all, which are always painter’s spiritual expression by image. They are also false paintings. The third ones are those between the above extremes which can be called true paintings. They are much higher, stronger, more centralized, typical and ideal than real life. So they are more universal. Sense and sensibility as well as form and spirit can not be divided.\\" Huang Zuolin’s father once served as the comprador of Shell lntemationaI Oil Products B.V. During the Cultural Revolution, Huang Zuolin suffered because of his father’s job and was interrogated (Life and Death in Shanghai Author: Nien Cheng Page 326. Cheng was one of Huang Zuolin and his wife’s good friends during their study in Britain.) Over the nearly 60 years of his art career, Huang Zuolin introduced the ideas and practices of Konstantin Stanislavski, Bertolt Brecht, Jerzy Grotowski, as well as many other schools of dramatic thought, to Chinese theatre workers. He also directed around 100 plays and films and encouraged a large number of theatre and film workers. In 1988, he received the Drama Director Award (lifetime award) issued by the Institute of Chinese Drama. On June 1, 1994, he died in the Shanghai Huadong Hospital. Huang Zuolin was the representative of the first, second, and third session of the National People’s Congress (NPC) of the People's Republic of China. He was also a member of the fifth session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Congress (CPPCC), vice president of China Theater Association, and vice chairman of Shanghai People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. On October 24, 1995, a statue of Huang Zuolin was unveiled on the lawn of former Shanghai People's Art Theatre. Since 1996, Shanghai Dramatic Arts Centre established the Zuolin Dramatic Art Award (Zuolin Award), carrying forward his spirit of \\"devoting one’s whole life to drama with loyalty to the art, caring about neither fame nor profit\\", to be awarded to theatre professionals making special contributions to dramatic art, and who demonstrate deep love for their careers. In June 1999, his daughter, Huang Shuqin, made a donation to the Shanghai Library of more than 3,000 English books and over 140 manuscripts, letters, literature, pictures and works collected by Huang Zuolin, including some correspondence between George Bernard Shaw and Huang Zuolin. == Works == * Words from directors (1979) * Talk on Dramatic View * I and My View on Drama of Depicted Desires == Filmography == * Phony Phoenixes (假凤虚凰) * Night Inn (夜店) * Corruption (腐蚀) * The Watch (表) * A Window on America (美国之窗) * Cuckoo Cuckoo Again (布谷鸟又叫了) * Story of the Huangpu River (黄浦江的故事) * Mayor Chen Yi == References  External links == * Category:1906 births Category:1994 deaths Category:Film directors from Tianjin Category:Alumni of the University of Birmingham Category:Alumni of King's College, Cambridge Category:Chinese film directors Category:Chinese theatre directors ","title":"Huang Zuolin"},{"id":"35224565","text":"Isturgia miniosaria is a species of moth in the family Geometridae.

The spelling of the town's name was corrected from Maluti in 2015. Donald's Drift is a settlement within Maloti. Maloti, once a village, is now a rapidly developing township. The township comprises Sotho, Hlubi, Phuthi and small Xhosa groups. Most residents in the area are either bilingual or multilingual. The township comprises many sections, with Maluti being the main part. Tholang, Motsekoa, Ramohlakoana, Protea, Hardenberg and Malubaluba are a few of the places that surround Maluti. Maluti is highly admired for the mountain ranges that surround it. ==History== There is very little history recorded about Maloti. The origin of Maloti differs from one person to the next, but it can be just safe to say that it was just a village, just like the many others surrounding it. ==Development== Maloti was already developing in the years before 2000s, but saw greater development in the 2000s. The township has facilities that can make it an independent town, but obviously with much more investment. The township has a privately owned garage, a civic centre, hall, library, post office, clinic, surgery, police station, magistrates court, municipal offices, just to name a few. The township once had a fully functional college, Maluti College, in which many were awarded their qualifications. The college has been turned into district offices - they cater for the Maluti District. ==Culture== As much as traditional culture is slowly phasing out with the development of Maluti into a township, Maluti has a wide variety of cultural practices such as initiation. Boys who are physically, mentally and emotionally ready take part in the cultural practice of initiation. Three ethnic groups practice this culture in the township and the areas surrounding it, namely - baSotho, amaHlubi and amaXhosa. Usually, young boys undergo initiation during the June and December holidays and usually stay for a period of four to six weeks. The return of the boys, now men, is celebrated by slaughtering of some cattle and beverages. There are many other cultural practices practiced in Maluti. ==References== Category:Populated places in the Matatiele Local Municipality ","title":"Maloti, Eastern Cape"},{"id":"35224656","text":"Qualification for tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom, was determined not by any form of qualifying tournament, but by the rankings maintained by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA). ==Qualifying criteria== The main qualifying criteria were the ATP and WTA ranking lists as of 11 June 2012.

Before entering the video game industry, Ince earned a degree in astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In 1993, Ince was employed by Revolution Software, where he worked on titles such as Beneath a Steel Sky, the Broken Sword series, In Cold Blood and Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado. He left the company in 2004, and set up a new website, Steve Ince Solutions, offering solutions for writing and design in the video game industry. Ince is also a creator of various comic strips and in 2004 a collection of one of his comic strips was published by BookSurge Publishing. In 2005 he launched Juniper Games, a label under which he would develop his own games, which was followed by the release of its first game, Mr. Smoozles Goes Nutso. He also announced a new company, InceSight, through which he offered his skills and experience to developers and publishers in need of assistance in the fields of writing and game design. Ince wrote down his ideas on game design in a series on Developing Thoughts, and in a book entitled Writing for Video Games. As writer, designer or script editor Ince has been working on a number of games, most notably Agatha Christie: And Then There Were None, The Witcher, So Blonde and The Whispered World. When Revolution started working on remakes of the first two Broken Sword games for newer platforms in 2009 and 2010, Ince became involved again. During this time he also worked on Spare Parts, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, and ScanMe, and on casual/hidden object games, such as Rhianna Ford and The Da Vinci Letter and two Special Enquiry Detail games. For Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon, Ince received a nomination for Excellence in Writing at the Game Developers Choice Awards 2004. In 2008 he received another nomination from the Writers' Guild of Great Britain in the category of Best Video Game Script for the game So Blonde. As of February 2012 Ince is represented by the SMART Talent agency. ==Biography== Early career and Revolution Software Before entering the game industry, Ince earned a degree in astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne (1979). After a few jobs, including writing and drawing a cartoon strip for a local newspaper, he managed to get a job at Revolution Software in February 1993, about two years after the company was founded. He was hired by Revolution as an artist to work on what would become Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars, but he also worked on Beneath a Steel Sky, which had already been in production for some time. As he was also doing a lot of organising, Revolution's MD Charles Cecil asked him to become producer of the Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars, and he was also the producer of its sequel, Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror. As producer, Ince sat in on a lot of story and design meetings, and in time he became more and more involved in the designing and writing side of the games. For the third episode in the series, Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon (2003), he co-wrote the story and the dialogue, and became lead designer on the project. When the fourth game, Broken Sword: The Angel of Death (2006), was first being discussed, he was asked to be involved, but he was already working freelance and committed to another project, So Blonde, an opportunity for him to write a whole game almost from ground up. Besides his work on the Broken Sword series, he also worked on other games by Revolution: In Cold Blood (2000) and Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado (2000). In Cold Blood was the first game where he had a big hand in the writing and it was the first game for which he wrote any dialogue. Departure from Revolution In May 2004, when Revolution had to let go most of its members because a project didn't get signed, Ince set up a new website, Steve Ince Solutions, where he offered solutions for writing and design in the game industry. In the next month he became a writer for AllintheGame Ltd., one of the biggest UK talent agencies for voice acting and production. In the same month he added a blog Writing and Design, a spin-off of his older blog Life in the Crescent at his existing website, Juniper Crescent. He was also working on comic strips, and in 2004 a collection of his strips Juniper Crescent and The Sapphire Claw became available as Crescent And Claw, Vol. 1 (BookSurge Publishing). On 29 April 2005 Ince launched Juniper Games, a label under which he would develop his own games. He added a new website and announced his debut game, Juniper Crescent – The Sapphire Claw, based on his comic strip Scout the One-Eyed cat. Because of lack of funding the game, with its complex art and animation, wasn't finished. During this time he also worked as script editor on Wanted: A Wild Western Adventure (Revistronic, 2004), as writer on The Three Musketeers (Legendo, 2005), and as script editor on Agatha Christie: And Then There Were None (Awe Games, 2005). On 26 August 2005 Ince announced a new company, InceSight, through which he offered his skills and experience to those developers and publishers in need of a proven professional in the fields of writing and game design. On 16 November 2005, Juniper Games presented an arcade-style adventure game entitled Mr. Smoozles Goes Nutso. The game was based on his online serial comic strip Mr. Smoozles, and became available for download in September 2006. It became free to download in June 2008. Besides working on new games in this period, Ince also wrote a book called Writing for Video Games (A & C Black, 2006). His book, with a foreword by Revolution's Tony Warriner, deals with all aspects of game production and the writer's role in the development process, and which skills are required. It includes for instance chapters on \\"Interactive Narrative\\" and \\"Dialog and Logic\\", and examples of a design document and script are added. Previously he had already written on game design, and in 2006–2007 he wrote down more of his ideas in a series on Developing Thoughts. After the extensive series Ince continued to publish on aspects of game design. Other games Ince worked on since then are The Witcher (CDProjekt, 2007); Delicious – Emily's Tea Garden (GameHouse, 2008); So Blonde (Wizarbox, 2008); Delicious – Emily's Holiday Season (GameHouse, 2009); Rhianna Ford and the Da Vinci Letter (Green Clover Games, 2010); Alice in Wonderland (Gimagin/Merscom, 2010); Special Enquiry Detail: The Hand that Feeds (Floodlight Games, 2010), So Blonde: Back to the Island (Wizarbox, 2010), and The Whispered World (Daedalic Entertainment, 2010). For So Blonde Ince was contacted by Wizarbox, whose crew had already done some concept work of the main character, some of the locations, and they had an idea for the story. They brought Ince in to develop the story, but in a way he became the public face of the game, and he went to Leipzig and Paris on promotional tours. Ince got involved with Revolution again when they started working on remakes of the first two Broken Sword games for newer platforms: Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars – Director's Cut and Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror – Remastered. During this time he also worked on Spare Parts (Ea Bright Light, 2010), Special Enquiry Detail: The Hand that Feeds (Floodlight Games, 2011), The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings (CDProjekt RED, 2011), and ScanMe (ScanMe.com, 2011). Special Enquiry Detail: The Hand that Feeds, written and designed by Ince, is one of his casual/hidden object games. The critically acclaimed detective adventure game debuted on the Mac App Store on January 2012. It was followed by a sequel, Special Enquiry Detail: Engaged to Kill (G5 Entertainment, March 2012). So Blonde also got a follow-up, Captain Morgane and the Golden Turtle (Wizarbox, 2012), that is set back in pirate times. Ince gave some video interviews to introduce the game. Ince was represented by the SMART Talent agency. Award nominations For Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon, Ince received a nomination for Excellence in Writing at the Game Developers Choice Awards 2004. In 2008 he received another nomination from the Writers' Guild of Great Britain in the category of Best Video Game Script for So Blonde. Personal life Ince lives with his partner, June, in the East Yorkshire countryside. They have a tabby cat, Merlin, and fish in the garden pond. He has three sons, Shaun, David and Jason, as well as five granddaughters, Caitlin, Leilani, Selene, Freya and Ariana, and a grandson, Louie. On his website Steve Ince, Writer, Game Designer he has a blog on Writing and Design, and he also writes a more personal blog called It Happened So Fast. ==References *Website Steve Ince, Writer, Game Designer *Steve Ince's blog Writing and Design *Game Nostalgia Steve Ince biography * Moby Games Steve Ince Category:1958 births Category:British video game designers Category:Living people Category:People from York ","title":"Steve Ince"},{"id":"35224748","text":"Michael Ebling in 2012 Michael Ebling (born 27 January 1967) is a German politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD).

In addition to the variety of verified DNA structures, there have been a range of obsolete models that have either been disproven, or lack evidence. Some of these structures were proposed during the 1950s before the structure of the double helix was solved, most famously by Linus Pauling. Non- helical or \\"side-by-side\\" models of DNA were proposed in the 1970s to address what appeared at the time to be problems with the topology of circular DNA chromosomes during replication (subsequently resolved via the discovery of enzymes that modify DNA topology). These were also rejected due to accumulating experimental evidence from X-ray crystallography, solution NMR, and atomic force microscopy (of both DNA alone, and bound to DNA-binding proteins). Although localised or transient non-duplex helical structures exist, non-helical models are not currently accepted by the mainstream scientific community. Finally, there exist a persistent set of contemporary fringe theories proposing a range of unsupported models.374x374px ==Prior to Watson–Crick structure== The DNA double helix was discovered in 1953 (with further details in 1954) based on X-ray diffraction images of DNA as well as base-pairing chemical and biochemical information. Prior to this, X-ray data being gathered in the 1950s indicated that DNA formed some sort of helix, but it had not yet been discovered what the exact structure of that helix was. There were therefore several proposed structures that were later overturned by the data supporting a DNA duplex. The most famous of these early models was by Linus Pauling and Roberyt Corey in 1953 in which they proposed a triple helix with the phosphate backbone on the inside, and the nucleotide bases pointing outwards. A broadly similar, but detailed structure was also proposed by Bruce Fraser that same year. However, Watson and Crick soon identified several problems with these models: * Negatively charged phosphates near the axis repel each other, leaving the question of how the three-chain structure stays together. * In a triple-helix model (specifically Pauling and Corey's model), some of the van der Waals distances appear to be too small. The initial double helix model discovered, now termed B-form DNA is by far the most common conformation in cells. Two additional rarer helical conformations that also naturally occur were identified in the 1970s: A-form DNA, and Z-form DNA. == Non-helical structure proposals ==  Before the discovery of topoisomerases  Linear tetraplex model proposal (1969)Even once the DNA duplex structure was solved, it was initially an open question whether additional DNA structures were needed to explain its overall topology. there were initially questions about how it might affect DNA replication. In 1963, autoradiographs of the E. coli chromosome demonstrated that it was a single circular molecule that is replicated at a pair of replication forks at which both new DNA strands are being synthesized. The two daughter chromosomes after replication would therefore be topologically linked. The separation of the two linked daughter DNA strands during replication either required DNA to have a net-zero helical twist, or for the strands to be cut, crossed, and rejoined. It was this apparent contradictions that early non-helical models attempted to address until the discovery of topoisomerases in 1970 resolved the problem. In the 1960s and 1970s, a number of structures were hypothesised that would give a net-zero helical twist over the length of the DNA, either by being fully straight throughout or by alternating right-handed and left-handed helical twists. For example, in 1969, a linear tetramer structure was hypothesised, and in 1976, a structure with alternating sections of right-handed and left- handed helix was independently proposed by two different groups. The alternating twists model was initially presented with the helicity changing every half turn, but later long stretches of each helical direction were later proposed. However, these models suffered from a lack of experimental support. Under torsional stress, a Z-DNA structure can form with opposite twist to B-form DNA, but this is rare within the cellular environment. The discovery of topoisomerases and gyrases, enzymes that can change the linking number of circular nucleic acids and thus \\"unwind\\" and \\"rewind\\" the replicating bacterial chromosome, solved the topological objections to the B-form DNA helical structure. Indeed, in the absence of these topology-altering enzymes, small circular viral and plasmid DNA are inseparable supporting structure whose strands are topologically locked together. Non-helical DNA proposals have therefore dropped from mainstream science.Side-By-Side model structure proposal (1976)  Confirmation of helical structure  Initially, there had been questions of whether the solved DNA structures were artefacts of the X-ray crystallography techniques used. However, the structure of DNA was subsequently confirmed in solution via gel electrophoretic methods and later via solution NMR and AFM indicating that the crystallography process did not distort it. The structure of DNA in complex with nucleosomes, helicases, and numerous other DNA binding proteins also supported its biological relevance in vivo.  Persistence as fringe theories  Despite the evidence supporting DNA duplex models alternative models were subsequently proposed during the 1980s and into the 2000s. Due to lack of evidence and contradiction of other experiments, these have been rejected by the scientific community as of insufficient evidence and of attempting to solve a solved problem. In 2009, You Cheng Xu noted that brief re-annealing times (i.e. 20–30 minutes) resulted in anomalous structures which did not co-migrate with routinely prepared DNA topoisomers, while prolonged re-annealing times (in his case, 72 hours at 4º) resulted in structures which did co-migrate with the topoisomers, suggesting normal base-pairing. They interpreted their data as supporting the possibility that the two strands inside the native DNA double helix are winding ambidextrously rather than plectonemically, with left-handed and right-handed regions coexisting in a zero linking number topoisomer.[34] The finding that the two circular strands of supercoiled or relaxed plasmid can be gently dissociated in low salt aqueous solution or pure water provides additional evidence supporting the ambidextrous double helix model. In April 2019, Dr. Pawan Kumar from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi published research stating that two strands of pUC19 plasmid can be separated into individual circular DNA strands with the addition of sodium hydroxide.[35] The separated strands of plasmid DNA reannealed to form the double-stranded plasmid under suitable conditions. Moreover, plasmid DNA formed with the reannealing of individual strands was found to be similar to native plasmid in its properties. These findings showed that two strands of a plasmid DNA can be reversibly separated into individual strands and contradicted the Watson and Crick model of DNA structure. Kumar's report received serious criticism, including from You Cheng Xu of the UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, who wrote that Kumar is \\"completely wrong\\" and that the evidence presented \\"cannot support his conclusion.\\"[36] Xu published an article in the journal Symmetry in November 2019 that challenging the double helix model.[37]. It also provided a research proposal to test the double helix conjecture that may prove a zero linking number could be found in any plasmid. ==References== Category:DNA Helices Biomolecules Structural bioinformatics Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Obsolete scientific theories ","title":"Obsolete models of DNA structure"},{"id":"35224894","text":"The Artaud Beats is a progressive rock band consisting of John Greaves (bass, vocals), Chris Cutler (drums) and Geoff Leigh (soprano sax, flute, vocals, electronics), all formerly members of Henry Cow, and Yumi Hara Cawkwell (piano, vocals). ==History== Cawkwell and Leigh had released an album together, Upstream, and were booked to play the Avantgarde Festival (Schiphorst, Germany) in 2009 having previously toured Japan.

They are only separated by a narrow stretch of ocean. Through cross cultural contact, China and Korea has strongly influenced Japan; particularly from China with its writing system, architecture, culture, religion, philosophy, and law, many of which were introduced by the Kingdom of Baekje. == First evidences of Japan in Chinese historical records AD 1–300 == Text of the Wei Zhi (c. 297) The first mention of the Japanese archipelago was in the Chinese historic text Book of Later Han, in the year 57, in which it was noted that the Emperor of the Han dynasty gave a golden seal to Wa (Japan). The King of Na gold seal was discovered in northern Kyūshū in the eighteenth century. From then on Japan was repeatedly recorded in Chinese historical texts, at first sporadically, but eventually continuously as Japan matured into a notable power in the region. There is a Chinese tradition that the first Chinese Emperor, Qin Shi Huang, sent several hundred people to Japan to search for medicines of immortality. During the third century, Chinese travelers reported that inhabitants of Japan claimed ancestry from Wu Taibo, a king of the Wu state (located in modern Jiangsu and Zhejiang) during the Warring States era.Encounters of the Eastern Barbarians, Wei Chronicles They recorded examples of Wu traditions including ritual teeth-pulling, tattooing and carrying babies on backs. Other records at the time show that Japan already had the same customs recognized today. These include clapping during prayers, eating from wooden trays and eating raw fish (also a traditional custom of Jiangsu and Zhejiang before pollution made this impractical). Kofun era traditions appear in the records as the ancient Japanese built earthen mound tombs. The first Japanese personage mentioned by the Wei Zhi (Records of Wei) is Himiko, the female shaman leader of a country with hundreds of states called Yamataikoku. Modern historical linguists believe Yamatai was actually pronounced Yamato. == Introduction of Chinese political system and culture in Japan AD 600–900 == During the Sui dynasty and Tang dynasty, Japan sent many students on a limited number of Imperial embassies to China, to help establish its own footing as a sovereign nation in northeast Asia. After the fall of the Korean confederated kingdom of Baekje (with whom Japan was closely allied) to combined Tang and Silla forces, Japan was forced to seek out the Chinese state on its own, which in those times was a treacherous undertaking, thus limiting the successes of Japanese overseas contacts during this time. Important elements brought back from China (and some which were transmitted through Baekje to Japan) included Buddhist teachings, Chinese customs and culture, bureaucracy, architecture and city planning. The Japanese kimono is very similar to the clothing of the Tang Dynasty, and many historians believe that the Japanese started wearing robes like what Tang royalty wore, eventually adapting the garb to match Japanese culture. The capital city of Kyoto was also planned according to Feng Shui elements from the Chinese capital of Chang'an. During the Heian period, Buddhism became one of the major religions, alongside Shinto. The use of the Chinese model of Imperial government ceased by the tenth century, overtaken by traditional Japanese clan and family rivalries (Soga–Mononobe, Taira–Minamoto). == First recorded China-Japanese battle == In AD 663 the Battle of Baekgang took place, the first China- Japanese conflict in recorded history. The battle was part of the ancient relationships between the Korean Three Kingdoms (Samguk or Samhan), the Japanese Yamato, and Chinese dynasties. The battle itself came near the conclusion of this period with the fall of Baekje, one of the Samguk or three Korean kingdoms, coming on the heels of this battle. The background of that large battle involves Silla (one of the Korean kingdoms) trying to dominate the Korean Peninsula by forging an alliance with the Tang dynasty, who were trying to defeat Goguryeo, an ongoing conflict that dated back to the Sui dynasty. At the time, Goguryeo was allied to Baekje, the third major Korean kingdom. Yamato Japan supported Baekje earnestly with 30,000 troops and sending Abe no Hirafu, a seasoned general who fought the Ainu in campaigns in eastern and northern Japan. As part of Silla's efforts to conquer Baekje, the battle of Baekgang was fought between Tang China, Baekje, Silla, and Yamato Japan. The battle itself was a catastrophic defeat for the Yamato forces. Some 300 Yamato vessels were destroyed by a combined Silla–Tang fleet of half the number of ships, and thus the aid to Baekje from Yamato could not help on land, having been defeated at sea. Baekje fell shortly thereafter, in the same year. Once Baekje was defeated, both Silla and Tang focused on the more difficult opponent, Goguryeo, and Goguryeo fell in 668 AD. For the most part, Silla, having been rivals with Baekje, also was hostile to Yamato Japan, which was seen as a brother state to Baekje, and this policy continued (with one pause between roughly AD 670–730) after Silla united most of what is now Korea and repelled Tang China from what is now the Korean peninsula. Yamato Japan was left isolated for a time and found itself having to forge ties with mainland Asia on its own, having had the most safe and secure pathway obstructed by a hostile Silla. == The prosperities of maritime trading 600–1600 == Marine trades between China and Japan are well recorded, and many Chinese artifacts could be excavated. Baekje and Silla sometimes played the role of middleman, while direct commercial links between China and Japan flourished. After 663 (with the fall of allied Baekje) Japan had no choice (in the face of hostility from Silla, which was temporarily deferred in the face of Tang imperialism – as Tang imperialism posed a threat both to Japan and unified Silla – but resumed in after 730 or so) but to directly trade with the Chinese dynasties. At first the Japanese had little long-range seafaring expertise of their own but eventually (some suggest with the aid of Baekje expatriates who fled their country when it fell) the Japanese improved their naval prowess as well as the construction of their ships. The ports of Ningbo and Hangzhou had the most direct trading links to Japan and had Japanese residents doing business. The Ming dynasty decreed that Ningbo was the only place where Japanese–Chinese relations could take place. Ningbo, therefore, was the destination of many Japanese embassies during this period. After going into Ningbo they then went to other cities in China. In 1523, two rival embassies were sent to Ningbo by Japan, then in a state of civil war known as the Sengoku period. One of the emissaries was a Chinese, Song Suqing, who had moved to Japan earlier. Song Suqing became involved in a disagreement with a rival Japanese trade delegation, which led to the Ningbo Incident where the Japanese pillaged and plundered in the vicinity of Ningbo before escaping in stolen ships, defeating a Ming pursuing flotilla on the way. As a result of the incident, the port of Ningbo was closed to the Japanese – only two more Japanese missions were received (in 1540 and 1549) until the end of the Ming dynasty. Direct trade with China was limited by the Tokugawa shogunate after 1633, when Japan decided to close all direct links with the foreign world, with the exception of Nagasaki which had Dutch and Chinese trading posts. Some trading was also conducted by the Shimazu clan of Satsuma province through the Ryukyu Islands and with the Ainu of Hokkaido. == Japanese piracy on China's coasts and Mongol invasions 1200–1600 == Japanese pirates (or Wokou) were a constant problem, not only for China and Korea, but also for Japanese society, from the thirteenth century until Hideyoshi's failed invasions of Korea at the end of the sixteenth century. Japanese pirates were often from the undesirable parts of Japanese society, and the Japanese were just as happy to be (for the most part) rid of them as they were raiding more prosperous shores (at the time, Japan was ravaged by civil wars, and so while Korea, China, and the Mongol Empire were enjoying relative peace, prosperity, and wealth, the Japanese were upon hard times). == Ming dynasty during Hideyoshi's Korean invasions of 1592–1598 == Toyotomi Hideyoshi was one of the three unifiers of Japan (Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu were the others). After subduing the Mōri and Shimazu clans, Hideyoshi had the dream of eventually conquering China but needed to cross through Korea. When Hideyoshi received refusals to his demands by Korea to cross the country to Ming-dynasty China, he invaded Korea. In the first year of invasion in 1592, the Japanese reached as far as Manchuria under Katō Kiyomasa and fought the Jianzhou Jurchens. Seonjo (Korean king) requested aid from the Ming dynasty, but since Japanese advances were so fast, only small Ming forces were initially committed. Konishi Yukinaga, who garrisoned in Pyongyang in winter 1592, first encountered and defeated a force of 5,000 Chinese soldiers. In 1593, greater Chinese participation under General Li Rusong with an army of 45,000 took Pyongyang with artillery and drove the Japanese to the south, but the Japanese forces defeated them at the Battle of Byeokjegwan. After 1593, there was a truce of about four years. During that time, Ming granted Hideyoshi the title as \\"King of Japan\\" as withdrawal conditions, but Hideyoshi felt it insulted the Emperor of Japan and demanded concessions including the daughter of the Wanli emperor. Further relations soured and war reignited. The second invasion was far less successful for Hideyoshi. The Chinese and Koreans were much more prepared and quickly confined and besieged the Japanese in the south until they were finally driven to the sea and defeated by the Korean admiral Yi Sun Shin. The invasion was a failure but severely damaged the Korean cities, culture and countryside with huge civilian casualties (the Japanese massacred civilians in captured Korean cities). The invasions also drained Ming China's treasury and left it weak against the Manchus, who eventually destroyed the Ming Dynasty and created the Qing dynasty in 1644. Afterwards, Japan, under the Tokugawa shogunate adopted a policy of isolationism until forced open by Commodore Perry in the 1850s. == Ming and Qing dynasties and Edo period Tokugawa Japan == Chinese dishes, delicacies, sweets and candies were introduced to Japan by Chinese men, who taught their Japanese girlfriends how to make them. In the Genroku era (1688-1704) a Chinese instructed his girlfriend on how to make plum blossom shaped sugar and rice flour soft sweet called \\"kōsakō.\\" The songs were sung in the Tōsō-on The Kagetsu Entertainment (Kagetsu yokyō) booklet contained information about songs the Chinese men taught to their Japanese girlfriends showing that they were sang in Tōsō-on with instruments like hu- kung (two-stringed violin), ch’i-hsien-ch’in (seven-stringed dulcimer) and yüeh-ch’in (lute). The Japanese women of Nagasaki were taught dance, songs and music of Chinese origin. The gekkin (yüeh-ch’in) were used to play these Kyūrenhwan songs. The Kankan-odori dance accompanied one of these songs which spread in Edo and Kyōto as it gained fame. Exhibitions of the original Chinese style dance were performed in Edo by arranging for the sending of Nagasaki officials managing Chinese affairs and geisha to be sent there by Takahashi Sakuzaemon (1785-1829) who was the court astronomer of the Shogunate. He became famous due to the Siebold Incident. Later on, women were sent to service the Dutch at Dejima after they serviced Chinese at Maruyama being paid for by the Commissioners for Victualing. == Meiji Restoration and the rise of the Japanese Empire 1868–1931 == Sino-Japanese Friendship and Trade Treaty of September 13, 1871 signed in Tientsin by Date Munenari and Li Hongzhang. After the arrival of Commodore Perry and the forced opening of Japan to western trading, Japan realized it needed to modernize to avoid the humiliation suffered by China during the First and Second Opium Wars. Anti-Tokugawa tozama daimyōs led by the Shimazu and Mori clans overthrew the Tokugawa shogunate during the Meiji Restoration and restored the Japanese Emperor as head of state. Afterwards, Japan initiated structural reforms resulting in rapid modernization, industrialization, militarization and imperialism modeled after the imperialistic Western powers. Conflict after 1870 As Japan modernized and built a strong economy and military, the smaller country grew in power. Friction between China and Japan arose from the 1870s from Japan's control over the Ryukyu Islands, rivalry for political influence in Korea and trade issues.Seo-Hyun Park, \\"Changing Definitions of Sovereignty in Nineteenth-Century East Asia: Japan and Korea Between China and the West\\". Journal of East Asian Studies 13#2 (2013): 281–307. Japan, having built up a stable political and economic system with a small but well-trained army and navy, surprised the world with its easy victory over China in the First Sino- Japanese War of 1894–95. Japanese soldiers massacred the Chinese after capturing Port Arthur on the Liaotung Peninsula. In the harsh Treaty of Shimonoseki of April 1895, China recognized the independence of Korea, and ceded to Japan Formosa, the Pescadores Islands and the Liaotung Peninsula. China further paid an indemnity of 200 million silver taels, opened five new ports to international trade, and allowed Japan (and other Western powers) to set up and operate factories in these cities. However, Russia, France, and Germany saw themselves disadvantaged by the treaty and in the Triple Intervention forced Japan to return the Liaotung Peninsula in return for a larger indemnity. The only positive result for China came when those factories led the industrialization of urban China, spinning off a local class of entrepreneurs and skilled mechanics. Japanese troops participated in the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. The Chinese were again forced to pay another huge indemnity, but Japan was pressured to accept much less by the United States. Rivalries between the Eight-Nation Alliance and the American Open Door Policy prevented China from being carved up into various colonies.Yoneyuki Sugita, \\"The Rise of an American Principle in China: A Reinterpretation of the First Open Door Notes toward China,\\" in Richard Jensen, Jon Davidann, Yoneyuki Sugita, eds., Trans-Pacific Relations: America, Europe, and Asia in the Twentieth Century (2003) pp. 3–20 online. On the other hand, the Japanese government and individuals provided assistance to Sun Yat-sen and other members of the Tongmenghui who were instrumental in the overthrow of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China. First World War A Japanese expeditionary force quickly moved to capture all German possessions in the Pacific upon the outbreak of the First World War. Japan occupied the German colony of Qingdao, along with occupying portions of Shandong Province. China was financially chaotic, highly unstable politically, and militarily very weak. Its best hope was to attend the postwar peace conference, and hope to find friends would help block the threats of Japanese expansionism. China declared war on Germany in August 1917 as a technicality to make it eligible to attend the postwar peace conference. They planned to send a combat unit to the Western Front, but never did so.Stephen G. Craft, \\"Angling for an Invitation to Paris: China's Entry into the First World War\\". International History Review 16#1 (1994): 1–24.Guoqi Xu, \\"The Great War and China's military expedition plan\\". Journal of Military History 72#1 (2008): 105–140. British diplomats were afraid that the U.S. and Japan would displace Britain's leading role as a trading partner with China. They sought to play Japan and the United States against each other, while simultaneously maintaining cooperation among all three nations against Germany.Clarence B. Davis, \\"Limits of Effacement: Britain and the Problem of American Cooperation and Competition in China, 1915–1917\\". Pacific Historical Review 48#1 (1979): 47–63. in JSTOR In January 1915, Japan secretly issued an ultimatum of Twenty-One Demands to the Chinese government. They included Japanese control of former German rights, 99 year leases in southern Manchuria, an interest in steel mills, and concessions regarding railways. China did have a seat at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. However it was refused a return of the former German concessions and China had to accept the Twenty-One demands. A major reaction to this humiliation was a surge in Chinese nationalism expressed in the May Fourth Movement.Zhitian Luo, \\"National humiliation and national assertion-The Chinese response to the twenty-one demands\\" Modern Asian Studies (1993) 27#2 pp 297–319. == Second Sino-Japanese War == In the beginning of the Shōwa period, the Japanese wanted to occupy Manchuria for its resources. Due to the fractious nature of China during the Warlord Era, and latterly the Chinese Civil War, the Japanese were able to gain influence in the region through espionage, diplomacy, and use of force. Two notable examples are the assassination of Zhang Zuolin, and the Mukden Incident. The latter was used by Japan as justification for the invasion of Manchuria and establishment of a friendly state, Manchukuo. In the period between the Mukden Incident in 1931 and the official beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 there were intermittent clashes and engagements between Japanese and the various Chinese forces. These engagements were collectively described by the Japanese government as \\"incidents\\" to downplay existing tension. This was primarily to prevent the United States deeming the conflict an actual war and thusly placing an embargo upon Japan as per the neutrality acts. The incidents collectively placed pressure on China to sign various agreements to Japan's benefit. These included: the demilitarization of Shanghai, the He–Umezu Agreement, and the Chin–Doihara Agreement. The period was turbulent for the Chinese Nationalists, as it was mired in a civil war with the Chinese Communists and maintained an uneasy truce with remnant warlords, who nominally aligned with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi), following the Northern Expedition. This period also saw the Chinese Nationalists' pursuit in modernizing its National Revolutionary Army, through the assistance of Soviet, and later German, advisors. In July 1937, the conflict escalated after a significant skirmish with Chinese forces at the Marco Polo Bridge. This marked the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Chinese nationalist forces retaliated by attacking Shanghai. The Battle of Shanghai lasted for several months, concluding with Chinese defeat on November 26, 1937. Following this battle, Japanese advances continued to the south and west. A contentious aspect of these Japanese campaigns are the war crimes committed against Chinese people. The most infamous example was the Rape of Nanking, when Japanese forces subjected the population to looting, mass rape, massacres, and other crimes. Other (less publicized) atrocities were committed during Japanese advances; it is estimated that millions of Chinese civilians were killed. Various attempts to quantify the crimes committed have proved contentious, if not divisive. From 1938 onwards, the war was marked by Chinese use of guerrilla tactics to stall advances, and retreat to the deep interior where necessary. This eventually limited Japanese advances because of supply- line limitations – the Japanese were unable to adequately control remote areas but they did control practically all the major cities and ports, as well as air space. ==World War II== By 1938, the United States increasingly was committed to supporting China and, with the cooperation of Britain and the Netherlands, threatening to restrict the supply of vital materials to the Japanese war machine, especially oil. The Japanese army, after sharp defeats by the Russians, wanted to avoid war with the Soviet Union, even though it would have aided the German war against the USSR. The Navy, increasingly threatened by the loss of its oil supplies, insisted on a decision, warning the alternatives were a high risk war, the Japan might lose, or a certain dissent into third class status and a loss of China and Manchuria. Officially the Emperor made the decision, but he was told by a key civilian official on 5 November 1941: : it is impossible, from the standpoint of our domestic political situation and of our self-preservation, to accept all of the American demands....we cannot let the present situation continue. If we miss the present opportunity to go to war, we will have to submit to American dictation. Therefore, I recognize that it is inevitable that we must decide to start a war against the United States. I will put my trust in what it have been told: namely, that things will go well in the early part of the war; and that although we will experience increasing difficulties as the war progresses, there is some prospect of success.Quoted in Marius B. Jansen, Japan and China: from War to Peace, 1894–1972 (1975) p 405. The Emperor became fatalistic about going to war, as the military assumed more and more control. Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe was replaced by the war cabinet of General Hideki Tojo (1884-1948), who demanded war. Tōjō had his way and the attack was made on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, as well as British and Dutch strong points. the main American battle fleet was disabled, and in the next 90 days Japan made remarkable advances including the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, Malaya and Singapore.Noriko Kawamura, \\"Emperor Hirohito and Japan's Decision to Go to War with the United States: Reexamined.\\" Diplomatic History 2007 31#1: 51-79. online Following the attack on Pearl Harbor and the entry of the US into the war, fighting in the Pacific, and Southeast, and Southwest Asia significantly weakened the Japanese. ==Occupation== After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Soviet invasion of Japanese- occupied Manchuria, Japan surrendered. The Republic of China (ROC) administrated Taiwan after Japan's unconditional surrender in 1945, following a decision by the Allied Powers at the Cairo Conference in 1943. The ROC moved its central government to Taiwan in December 1949, following the victory of the PRC in the Chinese Civil War. Later, no formal transfer of the territorial sovereignty of Taiwan to the PRC was made in the postwar San Francisco Peace Treaty, and these arrangements were confirmed in the Treaty of Taipei concluded by the ROC and Japan in 1952. At the time, the Taiwanese authorities (the Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang (KMT)) were recognized by Japan, not communist China (the People's Republic of China, or PRC). As such, the KMT did not accept Japanese reparations only in the name of the ROC government. Later, the PRC also refused reparations in the 1970s.

After Poongodi's puberty ceremony, she changes her behaviour and shows sympathy for Venu. The village president (Radha Ravi) doesn't seem to care about caste or money, so he united many lovers. One day, Nagaraj steals the god status at the temple but Venu beats up the henchmen and he brings back the status. The village's Brahmins criticized his action and to prove the opposite, he recites Sanskrit very well. The village priest (Delhi Ganesh) proposes to marry his daughter but Venu declares that Poongodi and he are in love. Poongodi's father supplies Poongodi to forget him and Poongodi's father arranges to find a groom but Kannapan (Alex), a bad turns good after Venu's advises, helps Venu by menacing the grooms. All the village supports Venu and they don't understand Poongodi's father hypocritical decision. The village priest asks the Venu's past and his mother discloses that he is not her real son. Venu was the son of a widow Brahmin and he was a gifted boy appreciated by the village priest.

Her repertoire of songs included \\"'Arry\\", \\"The Boy I Love Is in the Gallery\\", \\"The Little Vagabond Boy\\", \\"I've Been a Good Woman to You\\" and \\"If I Only Bossed the Show\\". Hill made her stage début at an early age in a pantomime version of Mother Goose at the Aquarium Theatre in Westminster. After a difficult apprenticeship at a public house, she embarked on a career in music hall by 1868. She made a success at the London Pavilion, and until 1890 she was at the peak of her fame, enjoying top-billing at music halls across London and in the northern provinces. In 1879 she became the proprietor of her first music hall and later owned or operated several more, but without success. By 1889 her health was declining, and she was forced to cancel a number of theatrical engagements. After a tour of New York in 1891, she returned to London where she made some appearances until 1894, but was mostly in poor health. ==Early life== A contemporary of Marie Lloyd and Bessie Bellwood, Jenny Hill was born in Paddington, London, to Michael Thompson (1812/13–1881) a Marylebone cab driver. Her stage début was made at the age of six or seven, when she performed as the legs of the goose in the pantomime Mother Goose at the Aquarium Theatre in Westminster. In about 1860 she made her professional debut at Dr. Johnson's Concert Rooms, traditional \\"Song & Supper Rooms\\" in Fleet Street.Senelick, Laurence. \\"Hill, Jenny (1848–1896)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 26 March 2012 In 1862 her father apprenticed her to a publican in Bradford. In return for the chance to sing to the public house's customers until 2 a.m. she suffered great privations, which would seriously affect her health in later life, rising at 5 a.m. to polish the pub's bar and pewter, washing glasses, scrubbing floors and bottling beer until her performance began at noon.Frederick Denny's Encyclopædia of the British Music Hall On 28 May 1866, aged 18, she married John Wilson Woodley, an acrobat known by the stage name Jean Pasta; he later abandoned her, leaving her with three children, one of whom became the music hall performer Peggy Pryde.\\"Jenny Hill (1849–1896)\\", The Lyrics, accessed 19 September 2016, excerpted from Music Hall Stars of the Nineties by George Le Roy (1952)Baker, Richard Anthony. \\"Chapter 10: Across the Pond\\", British Music Hall: An Illustrated History, Pen and Sword (2014) ==Music hall career== Alfred Concanen's sheet music cover for 'Arry by E.

The popular entertainer George Leybourne led her back onto the stage for an encore.Ernest Henry Short and Arthur Compton-Rickett, Ring up the Curtain: Being a Pageant of English Entertainment Covering Half a Century, Ayr Publishing (1938) (reprinted 1971) p. 197 By 1871 she was earning £6 a week at the London Pavilion. The theatrical agent Hugh J. Didcott gave the expressive, witty and vivacious Hill the sobriquet \\"The Vital Spark\\", which she used throughout her career. Hill remained at the peak of her career until 1890, enjoying top-billing at music halls in London and the northern provinces. One source claimed that she appeared at three or four different halls a night, earning £30 at each hall. Her repertoire was varied and ranged from the tuneful \\"Maggie Murphy's Home\\" to the melodramatic \\"Masks and Faces\\". As a music hall manager she was less successful. In 1879 she purchased the Star Music Hall in Bermondsey (where Bessie Bellwood had made her debut), and from July 1882 to 1883 she kept a public house in Southwark. She purchased the Rainbow Music Hall (later renamed the Gaiety Theatre) in Southampton in July 1884. Opening in September 1884 after refurbishment, it burned down in December of the same year. In the straight theatre she played, among other roles, Nan in the 1889 revival of J. B. Buckstone's Good for Nothing in Shoreditch.Hibbert, Henry George. \\"Chapter 8: The Vital Spark\\", Fifty Years of a Londoner's Life, Dodd, Mead, & Company (1916), p. 54 ==Later years== On 25 March 1889 she appeared on the same bill as Bessie Bellwood at the Canterbury Theatre of Varieties.Programme for the Canterbury Theatre of Varieties: Monday, 25 March 1889 – British Library Online Gallery Her repertoire of songs included 'Arry, The Boy I Love Is In The Gallery, The Little Vagabond Boy, I've Been a Good Woman to You and If I Only Bossed the Show. Eventually, she earned enough by dancing the \\"Cellar Flap\\", singing her song The Coffee-Shop Girl and by her male impersonations to buy The Hermitage and its farmlands at Streatham. By 1889 the privations she had suffered in her early life were taking their toll, and she was forced to cancel a number of theatrical engagements due to ill health. Following the death of her estranged husband John Wilson Woodley on 8 January 1890 she married Edward Turnbull, a music hall manager; in December 1890 she was given a benefit at Canterbury Hall. Grave of Jenny Hill in Nunhead Cemetery Hill played on the vaudeville stage in New York for sixteen weeks from February 1891, but American audiences had difficulty understanding her London slang. Following her return to Britain she was given another benefit in September 1892 at Canterbury Hall after a period of ill health, but by June 1893 she had recovered sufficiently to appear at the London Pavilion and the Oxford Music Hall. She then went on a British tour that included Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Bradford, her former home. Because of her continuing ill health she was advised by her doctors to go to a warmer climate for the winter. She accepted the invitation of the theatre manager Luscombe Searelle to appear in Johannesburg, arriving there in December 1893. By then her health was so poor that she could only be taken onto the stage in her wheelchair where she shook hands with her audience. Returning to Britain in May 1894 she moved to the more moderate climate of Bournemouth for her health. Hill died in 1896 of pulmonary tuberculosis at her daughter Peggy's home in London, aged 48. She is buried in Nunhead Cemetery in London.\\"Jenny Hill\\", Find a Grave, 30 April 2009, accessed 19 September 2016 ==References * Victorian music hall serio-comediennes Category:1848 births Category:1896 deaths Category:Music hall performers Category:Vaudeville performers Category:People from Paddington ","title":"Jenny Hill (music hall performer)"},{"id":"35225235","text":":For the monotypic genus of gecko called Tukutuku, see Harlequin gecko Tukutuku panels flank a carving in a 19th-century meeting house.Tukutuku panelling is a distinctive art form of the Māori people of New Zealand, a traditional latticework used to decorate meeting houses.\\"Tukutuku Tuturu Maori\\", Educational booklet, Auckland Museum A wide range of named\\"Stories of the Tukutuku Patterns\\", http://christchurchcitylibraries.com patterns have developed, and these now are used in a wide variety of modern contexts\\"Tukutuku panel\\" , Palmerston North City Library and act as a form of inspiration to New Zealand creative artists. ==ReferencesExamples== * http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/te-ao-marama-the-natural-world/2/2/1 * http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/Photos/Libraries/Central/TukutukuPanels/panel-04.asp Category:Māori art ","title":"Tukutuku"},{"id":"35225245","text":"Scotopteryx peribolata, the Spanish carpet, is a species of moth in the family Geometridae.

The area has been used for public functions and markets over the centuries. ==History== Agincourt Square in the 1930s, looking towards the northeast The mediaeval market place in Monmouth developed from the bailey of the castle, and originally covered a much larger area than the present square. The square was the venue of the town's market, both before and after the Shire Hall was built in 1724. It was known as the Market Place in 1804, according to the local publisher Charles Heath. Charles Heath, Historical and descriptive accounts of the ancient and present state of the town of Monmouth..., 1804 In the early part of the 19th century, the marketplace was given the name of Agincourt Square, to commemorate the victory in 1415 of Henry V, who had been born in the town, over the French. It was also intended to help promote local tourism, which had prospered through the growth of the \\"Wye Tour\\". Sources differ as to whether the renaming took place in 1817Peter Borsay, Myth, memory, and place: Monmouth and Bath 1750-1900 – that is, two years after the Battle of Waterloo and the defeat of Napoleon – or in 1830.Monmouth Civic Society, Guide to the Monmouth Heritage Blue Plaque Trail, n.d., p.7 During the 19th century, farmers drove their flocks of animals through the square on their way to the slaughter houses in Priory Street.Alan Sutton Publishing, Monmouth and the River Wye in Old Photographs, Alan Sutton Publishing, 1989, The square was used as the meeting venue for fox hunts for many years. It has also been used to host open air public meetings. Many of the buildings around the square were once public houses. There were 15 pubs in the square in 1835;Heather Hurley, The Pubs of Monmouth Chepstow and The Wye Valley, Logaston Press, 2007, , page 66 this gave rise to a rhyme \\"A gin court here, a gin court there, no wonder they call it Agincourt Square\\".Keith Kissack, Monmouth and its Buildings, Logaston Press, 2003, , page 52 There are now just two pubs left: the Punch House and the Kings Head. In 1879 a young man advertised for a wife and received a photograph from an actress of the time and a letter making an appointment in Agincourt Square, Monmouth. The man turned up expecting to see his potential wife and stayed for three hours while being laughed at by a local crowd of people before returning home on the last train. Celebrations on 30 April 1890 for the birthday of John Maclean Rolls, son of John Rolls, later Lord Llangattock of The Hendre, saw the public roasting of an ox in the square, as part of a full day of celebrations. Tea and cake was provided to local children in their schools at 3:30pm. Public hog roasts took place in 1887 and 1897 to celebrate Queen Victoria's Golden and Diamond Jubilees. On 29 October 1900, the then Duke and Duchess of York stopped in the square on their way to visit the Llangattock and Rolls family at the Hendre. The visit was a private one and as such the official welcome in the square was very brief. The couple were in mourning at the time for Prince Christian Victor. The Duke and Duchess later became King George V and Queen Mary. The unveiling of the Rolls Memorial and Statue, to commemorate Charles Rolls, took place on 19 October 1911. On 18 July 1919 the Square hosted a parade that was the start of two days of Peace celebrations following the end of the Great War. ==Recent activities== A market is held under the arches of the Shire Hall on Fridays and Saturdays, with a farmers market on the second Wednesday of each month and occasional craft markets during the year. Monmouth Festival was held in the square from 1982 until 2008, when the venue was changed to the old cattle market at Blestium Street. ==Notable buildings and structures== File:Shire Hall Monmouth.jpgThe Shire Hall, built in 1724, dominates Agincourt Square File:Agincourt House, Monmouth - geograph.org.uk - 1304384.jpg No. 1 Agincourt Square, Agincourt House File:Rolls_Stat.JPGStatue of Charles Rolls File:The Punch House, Monmouth - geograph.org.uk - 649062.jpgThe Punch House File:Kings Head Monmouth.jpgKings Head Hotel File:Beaufort Arms 1.JPG The Beaufort Arms Hotel ==Gallery== Shire Hall, Agincourt Square, Monmouth.

It is one of the early examples of the Czech Baroque music, originating from the seventeenth century (more accurately, from 1653). The whole piece is made up of 13 parts describing specific stories. The first one is called \\"Foreword\\" and it is about a marriage between a man and a woman. The following texts talk about historical stories, for example the fate of Paris and Troy or the story of Jesus and Mother Mary. This collection of songs was composed for one alto, one soprano and two tenors, but it can be sung by larger choirs. Adam Michna himself is considered to be one of the most important Czech composers of the Baroque period and the Czech Lute is thought to be the peak of his career along with the Songs for Mother Mary. The ninth part, Anjelské Přátelství (The Fellowship of Angels) has become one of the most popular songs by Adam Michna. The first five verses (Nebeští Kavalérové) are played on Malostranské náměstí in Prague every hour by a trumpeter. The violin ritornelli, to be played between stanzas, had been lost and so were reconstructed for a 1998 edition by Michael Pospíšil for contemporary audiences.

In 1936 community members of Yuen Long felt that all primary school pupils in the district could not continue with secondary schooling. Seeing this, local community leaders initiated the establishment of a secondary school for the local students which led to fund-raising campaigns over a ten-year period. In 1946, the school was the first secondary school established by the Government in the New Territories. The school moved into the campus at Au Tau in 1949 and moved again in 1989 to the present modern campus in Town Park Road South, Yuen Long. The School Improvement Programme, scheduled for expansion with a total floor area of 1030 square metres, was completed in September 2003. The new annex was officially opened on 30 October 2003. As early as the 1930s, there were no government or aided secondary schools established in the New Territories. There were only a few private secondary schools. Most students had to travel to Kowloon or Hong Kong Island to enter secondary schools.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inspects guard of honor wearing traditional clothing of Indonesia at Merdeka Palace, Jakarta The national costume of Indonesia is the national costume that represents the Republic of Indonesia. It is derived from Indonesian culture and Indonesian traditional textile traditions. Today the most widely recognized Indonesian national costumes include batik and kebaya, although originally those costumes mainly belong within the island of Java and Bali, most prominently within Javanese, Sundanese and Balinese culture.Jill Forshee, Culture and customs of Indonesia, Greenwood Publishing Group: 2006: . 237 pages Since Java has been the political and population center of Indonesia, folk costume from the island has become elevated into national status.

The picture shows the traditional wedding dress of Bali (left) and East Java (right) with other dresses from other provinces depicted in the background As a multi-diverse country, Indonesia having more than 30 provinces, each has its own representation of traditional attire and dress from each province with its own unique and distinguished designs. National costumes are worn during official occasions as well as traditional ceremonies. The most obvious display of Indonesian national costumes can be seen by the type of costumes worn by the President of Indonesia and the Indonesian first lady in many and different types of occasions and settings, and also worn by Indonesian diplomatic officials during gala dinners. Traditional weddings and formal ceremonies in Indonesia are also one of the important occasions in the country where the attire of the national costume of Indonesia is absolutely visible ranging from traditional to modern attire different from each region it is representing. ==National costumes== Batik The batik shirt for men is often considered as an Indonesian national costume, as worn here by Indonesian President Joko Widodo (left) and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Batik is a cloth that is traditionally made using a manual wax-resist dyeing technique to form intricate patterns. Traditionally batik cloth is a large piece of intricately decorated cloth used by Javanese women as kemben or torso wrap. Batik cloth were wrapped around the hips with multiple folds in front called wiron, while the upper torso wear kebaya fitted dress. Traditionally for men, the edge of batik cloth also can be sewn together to make a tubular cloth as sarong, or wrapped around hips as kain in fashion similar to women's. Later for men, the batik cloth also sewn and made into contemporary batik men's shirt. Batik is recognized as one of the important identity of Indonesian culture. UNESCO designated Indonesian batik as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on October 2, 2009. As part of the acknowledgment, UNESCO insisted that Indonesia preserve their heritage.Indonesian Batik Inscribed in 2009 on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity Batik shirts, which are commonly worn by men in Indonesia (especially in Java), are usually worn during formal occasions; such as attending weddings, traditional ceremonies, formal meetings, communal gatherings, etc. Sometimes men who wear batik shirt usually also wearing a songkok or peci cap to make it more formal in a traditional way. Batik shirts have two types of cuts: long sleeves for formal occasions, and short sleeves for casual to semi-formal occasions. Batik shirt or blouse are also available for women. Batik pattern differs from region to region, especially across Java and other islands, and have their own motifs or patterns unique to respective local tradition and culture. Kebaya Balinese girls wearing kebaya The kebaya is the national costume of women from Indonesia, although it is more accurately endemic to the Javanese, Sundanese and Balinese peoples. It is sometimes made from sheer material such as silk, thin cotton or semi-transparent nylon or polyester, adorned with brocade or floral pattern embroidery. Kebaya usually worn with a sarong or batik kain panjang, or other traditional woven garment such as ikat, songket with a colorful motif. The earliest form of kebaya originates in the court of the Javanese Majapahit Kingdom as a means to blend the existing female Kemban, torso wrap of the aristocratic women to be more modest and acceptable to the newly adopted Islam religion. Aceh, Riau and Johor kingdoms and Northern Sumatra adopted the Javanese style kebaya as a means of social expression of status with the more alus or refined Javanese overlords.Maenmas Chavalit, Maneepin Phromsuthirak: Costumes in ASEAN: ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information: 2000: . 293 pages Kebaya is usually worn during official national events by Indonesian first lady, wives of Indonesian diplomats, and Indonesian ladies. It also worn by Indonesian ladies attending traditional ceremonies and weddings. In Kartini day on 21 April Indonesian women usually wear kebaya to celebrate and honor the Indonesian women emancipation heroine. During Balinese traditional ceremonies, Balinese women wore colorful Balinese style kebaya with songket Bali. Peci Sukarno wearing black velvet peci The Peci, also known as songkok or kopiah, is a cap traditionally worn by male Muslims in the Indonesian archipelago. It is quite similar to the Turkish-Egyptian fez. In Indonesia, the black velvet peci has become the national headdress with secular nationalist connotations made popular by Sukarno. A number of Indonesian nationalist movement activists in the early 20th century, such as Sukarno, Muhammad Hatta and Agus Salim, wore a peci to convey their nationalistic sentiments and to demonstrate their Indonesian identity. Indonesian male presidents always wear a peci as part of their official presidential attire. Since then, the black velvet peci is approved to be the national head-dress for Indonesian men. It is worn all over Indonesia, especially by government officials and men (usually Muslim men) throughout the country. The peci is usually worn with batik shirt or western- style suits by men in Indonesia for those attending formal occasions. It is also commonly worn during Islamic religious occasions. Senior citizen Muslim men across Indonesia — usually in Jakarta who identify themselves as native Betawi people, also use this peci on an everyday basis. It is also a traditional head-dress of the Betawi people and also other ethnic groups, especially in the western parts of Indonesia which are mainly Muslims. ==Regional costumes== Other than national costumes, each of the provinces of Indonesia — more precisely every ethnic groups of Indonesia, have their own regional traditional costumes. These regional costumes in Indonesian is called baju adat or pakaian adat, and derived from traditional Indonesian textile traditions and crafts. The best chance to see an example of Indonesian traditional costumes is by attending a traditional wedding ceremony. The traditional costumes differs according to its function and occasion; the most elaborate and extravagant ones usually reserved for bride and groom only, while a more common traditional costumes are worn by local people during traditional ceremonies. Some examples of Indonesian regional costumes (baju adat) are: File:Traditional Javanese marriage costume.jpgJavanese File:Wedding in action.JPGSundanese File:Baju Demang Betawi.pngBetawinese File:Bali Hindu Wedding Traditional Dress.jpgBalinese File:Gayo Wedding.JPGAceh Gayo File:My Wedding.jpgMalay Riau File:Danix.jpgMalay Riau Islands File:Bantenese wedding.jpgBantenese File:Minangkabau wedding 2.jpgMinangkabau File:Batak Karo Wedding.jpgBatak Karo File:Pernikahan ke-2 Agus SB dengan Bella Shapira.JPGBatak Toba File:Pengantin Suku Lampung.jpgLampung File:Mariés aux célèbes.jpgBuginese Textiles A Palembang lady clad in songket Aesan Gede costume Stamped batik, the design of which takes months to create; double weave ikat from the islands of Nusa Tenggara, silk Bugis sarong from Sulawesi, gold-painted Balinese prada fabric; shimmering kain songket from Palembang utilizing silver and gold metallic threads weft in woven cotton or silk ikat; and tapis weavings from Lampung. Weavings from the 34 provinces utilize different materials, methods, colors and designs. Primarily formed on back looms, weeks or months are spent creating intricate designs for everyday use or ceremonial wear. These weavings are primarily known by the different techniques that are used to create the distinctive designs. The symbolism of the various ethnic groups is evident in the variety of textiles. Color, shapes and their arrangements all have special meanings. Certain designs can only be worn by women or men, or only by the members of the royal family or nobility. Special textiles are worn or exchanged in life cycle or rights of passage ceremonies celebrating birth, circumcision, puberty, marriage, childbearing and death. Textiles play an important role in many traditional events and ceremonies. Written records dating to the fourteenth century document the importance of textiles in the social and religious lives of Indonesians. The highly distinctive traditional dress, or pakaian adat, best shows the diversity of uses of textiles throughout the archipelago. The even more elaborate bridal dress displays the best of each province's textile and ornamental jewelry traditions. Javanese men often wear sarong with baju koko (koko shirt) or batik shirt and peci during religious or casual occasions. *Sarong is the most popular waist worn garment in Indonesia mainly worn by men. It is popular among Muslim men across Indonesia and also by other regions and tribes throughout the country. It is mainly worn in Java, Bali, Sumatra, Kalimantan, and other places. It is very similar to the Indian Lungi. * Songket, a hand-woven in silk or cotton, and intricately patterned with gold or silver threads. In Indonesia, songket is more prevalent in Sumatra and Lesser Sunda Islands (Bali, Lombok and Sumbawa), while in Java, batik is more popular. Various songket patterns are traditionally produced in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Bali, Sulawesi, Lombok and Sumbawa. In Sumatra the famous songket production centers is in Minangkabau Pandai Sikek area, West Sumatra, Jambi City. Jambi and Palembang, South Sumatra. In Bali, songket production villages can be found in Klungkung regency, especially at Sidemen and Gelgel village. While in the neighboring island of Lombok, the Sukarara village in Jonggat district, Central Lombok regency, is famous for songket making. * Ikat, a dyeing technique used to pattern textiles that employs a resist dyeing process on the yarns prior to dyeing and weaving the fabric. In Indonesia it is more prevalent in Lesser Sunda Islands, especially in Bali, Sumba, Flores and Timor islands. It is also can be found in Sumatra, Borneo and Sulawesi among Batak, Dayak and Toraja tribes. * Ulos, a traditionally hand-woven cotton fabrics, and intricately patterned, specific to Batak tribes of North Sumatra usually slung over the shoulder during traditional occasions. * Tapis, a traditionally hand-woven fabrics, specific to Lampung province on southern part of Sumatra. * Tenun, is actually a generic Indonesian term for \\"woven\\". It encompass wide variations of Indonesian traditional hand woven textiles. Clothing In the Indonesian archipelago, the most basic and traditional way to wear a traditional garments, is just by wrapping the traditional fabrics around the hips as kain or sarong and secure it; and for women, wrapping the torso with kemben (torso wrap). This practice can still be found in Java, Bali, and Nusa Tenggara. Nevertheless, the development and the expansion of sewing and clothing techniques has creates tailored shirts for men and women. Tight fitting women's kebaya and tailored batik shirt for men is the example of traditional clothing that today transcends ethnic boundaries in Indonesia and has become a national costume. Other than those two, there are numbers of tailored clothings or shirt developed in Indonesia. Men * Baju koko also known as baju takwa, a traditional Malay-Indonesian men Muslim shirt, worn usually during religious occasions, such as shalat jumat or during lebaran (Eid al-Fitr) festival.

Headgear Each different region, island, tribe, and culture in Indonesia has its own head-dress/head-gear worn traditionally by the particular people of the area. The peci or songkok is the national formal head-dress worn by men all over Indonesia, usually worn by government officials. Men's head-dress are usually made of traditional fabrics, while women's head-dress often consists of metal jewelries sometimes decorated with floral arrangements.

During a live video chat, Colfer said that he is working on a prequel series which has now been published . The books are described by Colfer as a \\"modern-day fairy tale\\", following twins Alex and Conner Bailey as they fall from the real world into a world full of fairy tales they have only ever read about before and discovering there is more to this world than meets the eye. == Books ==  The Wishing Spell  The first book in the series, The Wishing Spell was published on July 17, 2012. A year and 9 months have gone by since twins Alex and Conner Bailey suffered the tragic loss of their father. Their mother is trying to balance her job and her family after her husband, John Bailey, was killed in a car accident. On Alex and Conner's twelfth birthday, their grandmother gives them a very old book from Alex and Conner's childhood, which Alex later realises mysteriously glows, hums and also that things disappear into it. Against Conner's advice to throw the book away, Alex keeps the book and eventually reaches into it. Conner barges in to stop Alex from going into the book, but Alex loses her balance because she was shocked and falls into the book. Conner jumps in as well to go after Alex. They find out the book is a portal to the fairy-tale world. There, they meet Froggy, a man turned into a frog. Froggy gives them a journal that tells of the Wishing Spell, a spell that can grant whatever wish the person wants if the person has eight items. To get back to their world, Alex and Conner must find the items that they need to complete the Wishing Spell. But bad news quickly follows. They later meet another person who was later identified as the Huntsman's daughter. Alex and Conner realize that the Huntsman's daughter is working for the Evil Queen to get the Wishing spell as well, and worse, since the Wishing Spell can only be used twice, and the author of the journal about the Wishing Spell had already used it once, it could be only used once more, yet there are two contestants. The Evil Queen gets this message from her magic mirror as well, so there begins a desperate race to get the Wishing Spell. While they are getting the ingredients for the Wishing spell, Alex and Conner come across many tales that their father had once told them. After a while, they have to face the conclusion that their father came from the Fairytale World... Finally, when Alex and Conner get all the items for the Wishing Spell, the Evil Queen kidnaps them and takes the items, and goes to her hiding place, in the north of the Sleeping Kingdom. There, Conner tries to prevent the Evil Queen from using the Wishing Spell by smashing the container of fairy tears, one of the items needed in the Wishing Spell. The Evil Queen tells them the story of where she came from. When the Evil Queen was little, she was named Evly, and she was a very kind and caring girl. She met Mira a young boy, and she falls in love with him, but the Enchantress captured her and stopped her from meeting Mira. Evly tried to send secret messages to Mira, but the Enchantress found out and imprisoned Mira in a mirror. Evly later killed the Enchantress, but she couldn't do anything to bring Mira back until she found out about the Wishing Spell. By then, Alex is in tears. The Evil Queen gets a few of Alex's tears, puts it with the items of the Wishing Spell, and somehow the Wishing Spell works! Mira is freed from the magic mirror, but he was almost already dead. Just then the rescue team, led by Froggy, arrived. Mira died in Evly's arms, and they are both swallowed up by the mirror when it falls. In the fighting that follows, the Huntsman and his daughter are killed, and Alex and Conner are rescued. Froggy is found to be the long-lost Prince Charlie from the Charming Kingdom, and Alex and Conner learn that their grandmother is the Fairy Godmother, who is capable of making portals between the Otherworld and the fairy-tale world, and the journal is written by the man who had completed the Wishing Spell years before was written by their father: therefore, Alex and Conner are a part fairy.

The Enchantress Returns The Enchantress Returns is the second book in the series and was published on August 6, 2013. Alex heads home after attending school and finds her brother Conner, who is worried because their mother has yet to come home from work. He also found a romantic note to their mother from a surgeon she worked with named Dr Bob, who brought them a puppy. When Charlotte comes home, Alex and Conner ask if Charlotte has a boyfriend. Their mother tells them that it's true. Later on, Bob goes to see the twins and tells them about his plan to propose to their mother. He shows them the ring, which has two large diamonds on it, one pink and one blue to represent the twins. When Bob asks the twins for permission about the proposal, Conner and Alex decide that this would make both Bob and their mom happy, so they agree. All three then decided to surprise Charlotte with a special dinner at the Bailey house the next Thursday at six. Alex returns home as quickly as she can from a course she was taking at a community college, and Bob tells the people he works with at the hospital to keep Charlotte busy so she won't come home early. The twins' mother, Charlotte Bailey, doesn't show up on time, but another nurse at the hospital says that she had left two hours ago. They then hear a mysterious knock at the door and a bunch of fairy tale soldiers from the Charming Kingdom barge in. Bob was originally doubtful but he later accepts that the Fairy Tale world exists. The twins' grandmother, the Fairy Godmother, enters and explains that their mother was kidnapped. While their grandmother attends to her own business, Xanthous (a member of the Fairy Council) and Sir Lampton (their father's old friend) watch over them until Mother Goose takes over babysitting the twins. Later, Alex gives Mother Goose bubbly until she becomes drunk, and Alex asks her for information, which she unknowingly gives. Alex discovers that her mother was captured by Ezmia, \\"the Enchantress\\", who cursed Sleeping Beauty as a young baby, and that the Sleeping Kingdom was in ruin. Since she couldn't get to the Land of Stories through the book, she sneaks out of the house and goes to her Grandmother's house, hoping to find a way to the Land of Stories. The next day, she almost falls off of a bridge. Unexpectedly, Conner saves her and admits that he had followed her. They eventually go to their grandmother's house, which had a glowing painting in it. Alex knows that this is a portal to the other world. Suddenly, Alex and Conner find themselves in The Land of Stories. They eventually find Froggy, who is once again in frog form as a disguise, after being turned back into a human at the end of the first book. All three travel to the Red Riding Hood Kingdom, where the Enchantress seemed to be destroying symbolic historic sights. Alex and Conner then attend a meeting only for the kings and queens by persuading Red to wear a dress that they could hide under. At the meeting, the Enchantress captures Alex and Conner's grandmother, revealing that she had captured 'Alex', but instead got Charlotte, their mother, who pretended to be Alex. At Red's castle, Conner learns of something called the Wand of Wonderment, which makes the holder invincible. To create it, one must find the six most valuable things of the six most hated people in the world. To help find all the items, Red asks the villagers to all pitch in to make a flying ship out of all her baskets. When the ship is completed, Alex, Conner, Red, Froggy, Goldilocks, and Jack fly the ship across The Land of Stories. They obtain the ice sceptre of The Snow Queen, the wedding ring of Cinderella's stepmother, the giant's harp, the glass from the Evil Queen's mirror, and the jewels of the Sea Witch. However, they are unclear on what the Enchantress's most prized possession is. After landing in the Troll and Goblin territory, they discover that Trollbella is now queen and that Bob travelled to the Land of Stories as well. They meet the reflection of the Evil Queen in the Eastern Kingdom, who says that the Enchantress' most prized possession is her pride. The Enchantress uses her vines to drag Conner, Red, Froggy, Goldilocks, and Jack to the coliseum. Alex tries to defeat the Enchantress by subtly stealing her pride, but she is blasted off of the coliseum. Because she was holding the Wand of Wonderment, she is saved from death. However, when she reaches the ground, she faints. Alex then has a dream that she was talking to Alice from Alice in Wonderland, Lucy from Narnia, Dorothy Gale from Oz, and Wendy Darling from Neverland, who advises her on the situation. Alex wakes up and goes back up the coliseum using a flying horse which is Bob. When she arrives, she drops the Wand in front of The Enchantress. The Enchantress tries to kill Alex with the Wand after Alex stripped her of her powers (until Ezmia got hold of the Wand of Wonderment) but Rumpelstiltskin jumps in front of the blast to save Alex out of guilt for what he has tried to do for Ezmia. Conner destroys the Wand, so all the magic is taken from Ezmia's body and she dies. After that, Bob finally proposes to Charlotte and they get married in Queen Cinderella's castle. When it is time to leave, Alex claims that she is meant to stay in the Land of Stories and that Conner should share their stories in the real world. The twins then believe that they were to be separated forever after the fairies decided to seal all portals leading to and from The Land of Stories. Later, Conner fetches Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters to go back to his world, Conner also shares their stories in the Otherworld or Earth.

Alex and Conner realize an army from their world, the world of regular people, is coming to the Fairy Tale world. The army is led by General Marquis, with the help of the Masked Man, a prisoner he freed during a raid on Pinocchio Prison. When some villagers are attacked by the Grande Armée, Rook (Alex's crush) informs the army of where Alex and the kings and queens are located to free his father. Alex's grandmother, the Fairy Godmother, eventually defeats the Masked Man's dragon with her fairy magic and dies. Alex figures out that Rook is the person who leaked out information. She is hurt by this and decides to dump him. Rook tries to regain her trust by helping her in the next stories. Alex feels sad about dumping him but knows she has done the right thing. At the end of the book, Alex encounters the Masked Man without his mask and becomes convinced he is the twins' deceased father, John Bailey. Beyond the Kingdoms Beyond the Kingdoms is the fourth instalment in the series and was published on July 7, 2015. The book begins with the Bailey twins chasing the Masked Man, who Alex believes is their late father. Conner is unconvinced, though. Alex is going through mood swings, in which her hair would float above her head and her eyes would glow. She has a hard time controlling her emotions which cause her to attack many people with her magic, including her family and friends. Alex insists to the fairy council that the Masked Man should be one of their highest priorities. As a result, she is 'un-godmothered' and kicked out of the fairy council. Alex loses her temper and her control of her magic and shoots at the fairy council with lightning before vanishing. She arrives at the Giant's castle where Mother Goose is staying. Later on, at Red and Froggy's wedding, Morina the beauty witch arrives and claims to be Froggy's first lover (and the one who cursed him to live as a frog). She threatens to harm Red if he doesn't leave with her, causing Froggy to chose to leave with her, as Morina is a very powerful entity. Meanwhile, Conner gets beaten up by the Masked Man in the library as he attempts to steal books. Conner rips off his mask, and he also believes the Masked Man is their father. That night, Alex wishes to speak with her late grandmother. Her grandmother then sends an \\"angel moth from outer space\\" of memories from the stars to tell Alex the true story of the Masked Man: he is their uncle Lloyd. Conner's old friend Trix the fairy stole a book from his grandmother's possession. From the book, they learn that what Lloyd attempted to steal was a Portal Potion, which can transport anyone into any work of fiction. The ingredients to the potion are a branch from the oldest tree in the woods, a feather from the finest pheasant in the sky, a liquefied lock and key that belonged to a loved one, two weeks of moonlight, and a spark of magic. Alex then explains to the others that the Masked Man is their uncle and not their father. Conner says she is crazy, but Mother Goose confirms that it is true and that it was their grandmother's final wish for her not to tell. The group then travels into the works of literature in an attempt to stop their uncle before he recruits an army of literary villains. Alex and Conner are trapped in separate worlds by Lloyd. Alex is trapped in the world of King Arthur, while Conner is trapped in the land of Robin Hood. After they escape and meet up in the land of Oz, they realize that Lloyd has sent armies to destroy the kingdoms and that they need to return home for supplies.

Conner and Alex spend time in Conner's short stories ranging from battling pirates to racing in an ancient pyramid filled with a thousand zombie mummies with the story's main protagonist. Conner brought his mother, Charlotte Bailey, in one of those adventures. In the meantime, the Sea Witch and the Snow Queen along with the witches are at Dead Man's Creek had other plans. The Snow Queen and the Sea Witch planned to give a handful of dust made from a magic mirror which was created by terrible demons to Alex, the dust was also given to the evil and terrifying Enchantress who Alex killed in the 2nd book, the reason the enchantress was so horrible was because of the dust, the dust raised not only her temper but made heartache worse than one could ever imagine, the Snow Queen and Sea Witch believe the dust will work on Alex because when Alex made the mistake of thinking The Masked Man was her late father and when Rook Robins broke Alex's heart it was proven that it was true, Alex's magic came and reacted from her heart. It was a curse which was believed by the witches-unbreakable. Worlds Collide The sixth and final book in the series, titled Worlds Collide, was released on July 11, 2017. Conner and Alex must brave the impossible. All of the Land of Stories fairy tale characters—heroes and villains—are no longer confined within their world. With mayhem brewing in the Big Apple, Conner and Alex will have to win their biggest battle yet. After a prologue in which Conner, now 80 years old, is celebrating his birthday at a bookstore, and realises he doesn't know what happened to Alex, he begins reading his last book. The story starts with Alex, still under the witches' control, wreaking havoc at the New York Public Library. Conner realizes this and sets out to New York City accompanied by Red, Jack, Goldilocks, and Bree. There are a few mishaps at the airport, such as Red buying a mirror at a gift shop, but they get on the plane safely. When they arrive, the Book Huggers, sitting in a restaurant, see Conner and tell their parents. However, Conner ducks and the parents don't see him. Then as Conner's group attempts to make it into the library, a homeless man who had helped them earlier for money leads them to a subway tunnel that was abandoned in the '20s and heads directly under the library. While there, they hear from other homeless people and realize a portal between the worlds is going to open up in the library. They break into the library and see Alex, currently under Morina's control, and the witch keeps them quiet. While sleeping, Conner gets a message from Alex saying that she wants him to kill her so she can \\"return to magic\\" and break free from the curse. The Book Huggers rescue Conner and the gang. Meanwhile, Alex is causing more chaos against her will. After the Literary Army was destroyed, Conner wrote a story, where he and Alex never explored the Land of Stories. In the story, Alex is not affected by the curse, and they see their father. Alex then gets emotional to the point the curse disintegrates and they leave just in time before the story ended. They then repair New York and a week later, met the president. They explain to her to safeguard the Land of Stories book to ensure a catastrophe never happens again like that of the Literary Army. The series ends with 65 years later where Conner, now 80, is going to be relocated to a retirement home because his children believe he is crazy. His granddaughter Charlotte “Charlie” Black visits him as he is about to visit his sister, Alex. He then exits to the Fairy Tale world.

Shin had previously ruptured his cruciate ligament sustained during a concert in 2001, and had corrective surgery on his left knee but the cruciate ligament in his right knee continued to suffer damage. However he has put off surgery, but with continue treatment, till the end of promotional activities for the album. Hence they performed \\"Hurt\\" singing in chairs and with a substitute dancer for \\"Venus\\", for their comeback on 29 March on M! Countdown.

Amudha (Nikitha), Krishnasamy's daughter, hates her father because she thinks that he is a killer. A few years before, Krishnasamy was a tea master with his friend Kandhasamy (Goundamani). After his father's death, Krishnasamy had a lot of responsibility. He fell in love with Sindhamani (Roja). In the meantime, Samiyappan, a local don, cancelled his engagement because Sindhamani's father promised Sindhamani to his son (Raja). One day, Krishnasamy ridiculed Samiyappan in a politic function. This humiliation irks Samiyappan, so his henchmen burnt Krishnasamy's house and Krishnasamy's brother who was in the house died. In anger, Krishnasamy entered Samiyappan's house and fought against his henchmen but an honest police officer (Nagesh) arrested him before he committed murder. The police officer gave him a mission: stopping Samiyappan's illegal activities. Thereafter, Krishnasamy became rich by seizing Samiyappan's black money. He cut Samiyappan's right hand when Samiyappan hurt the police officer. Sindhamani married Samiyappan's son. Vasantha (Urvashi), who worked at the tea shop, fell in love with Krishnasamy. First, Krishnasamy refused to marry her because he had a lot of enemies. His mother convinced him and he married her. Vasantha was very sensitive and she was afraid of blood. When Samiyappan's henchmen planned to kill Krishnasamy, the police officer saved him and died. Knowing her husband's activities, Vasantha left his house pregnant. Sindhamani is worried about Krishnasamy's situation. Meanwhile, Sindhamani ridicules Amudha to irritate Vasantha who slapped her and reveals that Krishnasamy is her husband. Vasantha hides her husband's identity to save her daughter from enemies. Finally, Krishnasamy wants to make peace with Samiyappan while Samiyappan wants to kill him. Samiyappan's henchmen kidnap Amudha and Samiyappan decides to kill her. Sindhamani hides Amudha and puts her daughter Sumathi (Sheela) instead of Amudha.

It is the site of numerous events and festivities. A Berlin (Kitchener) map from 1879 has a park called Town Park, located between Mill Street and Highland Road where Highland Courts and Woodside Parks stand today. It sits on the original Joseph E. Schneider homestead; the City had purchased some acres from the family in 1895 and drained the swamp on the land. The 27 acre purchase was initially opposed by some parties for being too far outside of town. The park opened on 27 August 1896; the lake, bridges and three islands were in place at that time. The Park was named after Queen Victoria ahead of her diamond jubilee on the British throne. The human-made lake is fed by Schneider Creek, surrounds three small islands, and is crossed by multiple bridges. The park also contains the Victoria Park pavilion, the Victoria Park Gallery and Archives, a bandstand, and a historic boathouse, a pub and music venue. A pavilion was first introduced to the park in 1902 as a response to complaints that there was no where to seek shelter when it started to rain. Designed by Charles Knechtel, the structure was set on fire in 1916 and deemed too damaged to recover. A second pavilion, borrowing heavily from Knechtel's original design, was built in 1924. Situated on the same spot as the original, the front of the pavilion faces the water, whereas the original faced the park's main island. The clock tower, moved to the park in 1975 after the old City Hall was demolished in 1973 The Gaukel street entrance features a clock tower which was once atop the old Kitchener City Hall (from 1924 and now site of Market Square Shopping Centre), and before that, the town's fire hall. It was moved to the park entrance and complemented with a fountain and a sculpture of luggage, by local artist Ernest Daetwyler, symbolizing the various waves of immigration that have contributed the city's history.The Luggage Project Statue of Queen Victoria in the Park A cast-bronze statue of Queen Victoria by Cavaliere Raffaele Zaccaquini and a cannon are situated in the park. The statue was unveiled in May 1911, on Victoria Day on the ten year anniversary of her death. The Princess of Wales Chapter of the IODE raised the $6,000 needed for the monument. In 1897 a large bronze bust of Kaiser Wilhelm I, made by Reinhold Begas and shipped from Germany, was installed at in the park to honour the region's prominent German-Canadian population. It was removed and thrown into the lake by vandals in August 1914 at the beginning of the First World War. The bust was recovered from the lake and moved to the nearby Concordia club, but it was stolen again February 15, 1916, marched through the streets by a mob, made up largely of soldiers from the 118th Battalion, and has never been seen again. The 118th Battalion is rumoured to have melted down the bust to make napkin rings given to its members.Bust of Kaiser Wilhelm I, Victorial Park, Kitchener, Ontario, Waterloo Public Library A monument with a plaque outlining the story of the original bust was erected in the park in 1996. In the fall of 2011, $10.1-million of restoration work on the park's lake was started, and in all 85,000 tonnes of sediment were removed from the lake bottom. Thousands of concrete and stone blocks were placed along the 2.2 kilometres of shoreline as a retaining wall to prevent erosion. While the overall area of the lake was slightly reduced, the waterway near the mouth of Schneider's creek at the north end of the park was widened to create a \\"fore bay\\" which slows the flow of water and allows sediment to settle in one place for easy removal.Heaviest lifting almost done at Victoria Park pond, Waterloo Record, 2012-03-26. The Boathouse, after the October 2019 closure of the restaurant business A major renovation was completed on the Boathouse in 2014. The building had originally been used to store canoes in summer and as a changing room for skaters, but also included a tea house for some years. It was closed between September 2013 and January 2015, and re-opened as a restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating, operated by Mark Forwell, The business closed down in October 2019; the owner was leasing the building from the City of Kitchener and exercised an exit option in the lease. The City announced in late 2019 that its budget includes $3 million for Victoria Park, to be used over 2021-2023 to achieve the results discussed in the master plan. While no single new element will be significant, the funds will allow for a renewal of the existing facilities including the trees. ==See also== *Victoria Park station (Kitchener) ==References * Category:Municipal parks in Ontario Category:Kitchener, Ontario Category:Protected areas of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo ","title":"Victoria Park, Kitchener"},{"id":"35226408","text":"Lifestyle changes have been increasing slowly since the introduction of media.

Magazines are still popular, but advertisers now often supply a web address where consumers can visit for more information than a print ad can provide. The average American household has two personal computers, making the Internet easily accessible. The rise of user-generated content is exemplified by the fact that anyone with Internet access can create a blog or an online journal, whether personal or commercial, which might detail someone's experience in a new restaurant, a purchased item of clothing or knickknack, or a review to a film. With the advent of the Android phone and its relative ease of uploading photos to social media sites such as Facebook, one can get an idea of how quickly an idea, pub review, or coveted object can be shared. Advertisers have always been privy to the strength of word-of-mouth and have tapped into social media, including Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr to make their wares known. Douglas Kellner writes, \\"Radio, television, film, and the other products of media culture provide materials out of which we forge our very identities; our sense of selfhood; our notion of what it means to be male or female; our sense of class, of ethnicity and race, of nationality, of sexuality; and of \\"us\\" and \\"them.\\"\\" ==Celebrity-endorsed beauty and health products== Media affects how people diet. Commercials advertise special pills, juice fasts, raw diets, and all-soy diets. Celebrities endorse food products and diets that promise dramatic results in little time. Audiences are impressionable depending on their age range. Salma Hayek, who has been using juice cleanses for 15 years promises health with her own line, Cooler Cleanse. Jennifer Aniston is famous for her yoga-body and has revealed her secret, which the public has taken as a big health influence. So Feminine provides health and lifestyle advice taken from celebrities and their personal assistants/trainers. Reality star Kim Kardashian endorsed QuickTrim, a weight-loss product designed to get rid of unwanted weight. Recent news articles claim that the product is unhealthy, and Kardashian is facing a lawsuit for her endorsement. Along with cleanses are celebrity beauty products. Salma Hayek has a CVS-exclusive line of hair care and cosmetic products, called Nuance. Admirers of Hayek who covet her beauty have hope that her products will make them look appealing. Websites such as Cosmopolitan and Celebrity Beauty Buzz list favorite skincare and makeup products of celebrities so readers can purchase the same products in hopes of achieving similar results. Health articles note that the meticulous science process is often forgotten in favor of the newer-is-better trend taking over mass media. Harvard School of Public Health states, \\"With [media reports'] emphasis on short, \\"newsworthy\\" pieces, the media often only report the results of single studies, and many stories are chosen simply because the results run contrary to current health recommendations.\\" Popular magazines and websites often focus on what's new in the world of celebrity health and beauty routines and forgo substantial research in order to bring to the masses what the public are truly interested in; quick, easy-way-out health fixes such as these juice cleanses and detox diets. Celebrity endorsements are effective due to their high profile presence in the media. Their physical attractiveness is central to their ability to sell products to an impressionable audience. Celebrities are also effective because they are what many people aspire to be or look like. Celebrities act as symbols of personal desire. \\"In an attempt to communicate the merits of their product or brand,\\" says Michael A. Kamins, Ph.D., New York University, \\"advertisers have often chosen to use endorsement as a promotional strategy.\\" Additionally, \\"the use of celebrity spokespeople has always been a favorite strategy among agencies.\\" Kamins informs that advertisers are well aware of how easily celebrities influence consumer habits; it is the combination of their physical appeal and their high status that draws in the public. He explains, \\"Indeed, a considerable amount of research exists both in the social sciences and in marketing supporting a strategy by showing that a physically attractive source facilitates attitude change toward issues, products, and ad-based evaluations.\\" Research suggests that there is a link between the product itself and the image of the celebrity. The celebrity, in this case, indeed acts as a symbol of the product. The physical attractiveness of the celebrity endorser improves the appearance of the product, or rather, the advertisement. In simpler terms, it makes a bigger impact on the audience if \\"the characteristics of the product 'match-up' with the image conveyed by the celebrity,\\" as suggested by Kamins' research. He continues, \\"This 'match-up' hypothesis suggests that the visual imagery contained in the ad conveys information over and above that contained in explicit verbal arguments.\\" A journal notes that the match up hypothesis \\"specifies that perceivers distinguish multiple types of good looks, and that in advertising, certain beauty ideals are more appropriately paired with specific products than with others.\\" Another journal further explains, \\"In the match-up hypothesis, the message conveyed by the image of the celebrity and the message about the product ought to converge in effective advertisements.\\" However, research also notes that physical attractiveness is the key detail when analyzing consumer behavior. If a celebrity is less than attractive according to society's standards, the advertising campaign may potentially be less effective. Still, advertisements starring celebrities are generally effective due to their popularity and presence in media. There are times when physical attractiveness of the celebrity is not relevant, and that is when the product showcased in the advertisement does not claim to enhance the consumer's appearance. Under this circumstance, the \\"match-up\\" hypothesis does not apply because the product is not particularly attractive. Attractive products include luxurious sports cars, designer clothing, anti-aging products, beauty products (i.e. foundation that smooths fine lines, blemishes, pigmentation, and promises a flawless canvas onto which the rest of a woman's makeup may be applied), hair care (i.e. shampoos, conditioners, and shine- enhancing serums that boast rare ingredients and professional results), modern-day technology products such as everything Apple produces (iPhone, Mac computers) and the brands that strive to mimic these products' sleek appearances, etc. \\"Unattractive\\" products include toilet paper, household cleaning items, groceries and food, personal hygiene products, music, movies, etc. Though, it can be debated that music and movies do not depend on the attractiveness of its performers; attractiveness vs. talent in the respected fields depends on many factors regarding the consumers, such as age and gender. B. Zafer Erdogan says, \\"Because of their fame, celebrities serve not only to create and maintain attention, but also to achieve high recall rates for marcoms messages (marketing communication) in today's highly cluttered environments.\\" This serves as proof that advertising agencies use celebrities to cut through the clutter that is mass media. Having celebrities in their advertising campaigns helps them promote their products in the sense that notable figures are what gets the attention of the public, rather than the product itself. ==The beauty ideal and plastic surgery== Among the many beauty and health products advertised and media showcasing celebrity beauty as the most desired beauty, is the frustration that comes with consumers using these products and not achieving the results they want. In a psychological study which aimed to examine the correlation of the acceptance of cosmetic surgery and prevalence of celebrity influence, researchers found that there was an extremely significant association between the two. \\"Celebrity worship\\" is when a person has formed a strong adoration towards a celebrity and sees him or her as a role model. The study shows that this worship is considered a normal aspect of self-identity as it is usually formed as the identity is being developed. Worship of the celebrity may give people a sense of satisfaction or fulfillment. The study mentions that \\"'entertainment-social' celebrity worship reflects the social aspects of parasocial attachment, and is driven by an attraction to a favourite celebrity because of their perceived ability to entertain. For some individuals, a compromised identity structure may lead to psychological absorption (intensive and compulsive feelings) with a celebrity, or what has been termed 'Intense-personal' attitudes. In extreme cases, this absorption may become addictive, leading to 'Borderline-pathological' attitudes and behaviours that serve to maintain an individual's satisfaction with the parasocial attachment.\\" Additionally, this concept of celebrity worship may be used as symbols exemplary of the person's physical ideal. That is, they believe that their physical attractiveness will bring them thinks equal to or similar to the celebrity's level of popularity and exterior happiness. To them, physical attractiveness will bring that happiness, and cosmetic surgery can help them attain this. The study explains that \\"celebrities may represent prominent and unique social comparison targets, whose physical attractiveness and condition provide information about socially-idealised standards of beauty.\\" Notably, celebrity worship makes people more prone to mental health problems such as high levels of neuroticism, anxiety, depression, and an overall strong sense of worry. Being fixated on how a celebrity looks can increase anxiety because it causes the person to constantly compare themselves to them, thus creating unnecessary worry and high maintenance of their appearance, and eventually depression due to the fact that they cannot look like or be their role model. These people are likely to seek procedures such as plastic surgery in order to become exaggerated versions of themselves in hopes of becoming as physically appealing as their celebrity role model, and hopefully happier as a result. They consider plastic surgery a cure, or a fix, for their unhappiness. Therefore, they see it as acceptable. ==The effect of blogs and Internet== Style blogs showcase slender young women posing in the latest fashions. Young girls see these and want to emulate their style. The Thin Ideal comes into play. Gwyneth Paltrow's popular lifestyle blog/website Goop is geared towards parents, specifically women. She provides spirituality articles, family meal recipes, glimpses into her Hollywood life, and child-raising tips. Women and mothers read her blog and are consumed by the glamorous appeal. Paltrow advises wardrobe changes every season and provides essential-clothing suggestions that are far out of reach for the average women. Nylon Magazine is a colorful fashion magazine for pre-teens and teenagers who aim to live fashionably. The magazine dispenses beauty advice for how you can look like your favorite television star and promotes expression of style. Its influence is prevalent in the blogosphere. Young women with blogs take photos of themselves in their daily outfits. They often cite Nylon, among other sources, as one of their influences. Kellner states, \\"Media images help shape our view of the world and our deepest values: what we consider good or bad, positive or negative, moral or evil. Media stories provide the symbols, myths, and resources through which we constitute a common culture and through the appropriation of which we insert ourselves into this culture.\\" Fashion and beauty blogs focus on the values of looking a certain way, or what society deems as \\"stylish.\\" These websites bring together people with the same goals – i.e. looking good – and cultivate a culture in which the beauty myth is prevalent. In addition to blogs, social networking cites such as Facebook play a role in media influence. Many celebrities and clothing stores have Facebook profiles in which fans subscribe to receive a constant stream of news from these pages on their Facebook news feeds. Celebrities promote their latest films, television appearance, favorite charities, self-endorsed items, and those who are subscribed to them remain in-the-know and are kept up to date of their glamorous, high-profile words. Clothing stores update their pages with photos of their seasonal collections, showcasing attractive young models dressed in their fashions, thus creating images of desire in their impressionable audiences. == Sexuality and Social Media == Adolescents use the Internet for various purposes, such as keeping in contact with friends or partners. Particularly, some of them have used it for online sexual activities (OSA), especially for cybersex. OSA can be seen as a means of sexual exploration, important and healthy in the adolescent development. Many television shows, music, and magazines aimed towards teens tend to be dominated by a certain type of highly sexualized content and imagery. Even before social media, the newspapers were even publishing articles about sex and sexuality. In Thailand, the way girls practice their sexuality and sexual relationships due to social media has caused public concern and moral panic because the girls are challenging traditional sexual moral standards. Due to the fact that many social media accounts have easy access to things that could influence sexuality and the vast amount of television shows characterizing LGBTQ social media and the media in general have had a huge influence on sexuality and the lifestyle of humans all over the world. ==References== Category:Mass media ","title":"Lifestyle trends and media"},{"id":"35226417","text":"is a Japanese light novel series by Hajime Taguchi. It was adapted into an anime television series by Studio Gokumi. The anime was aired between July 6 and September 28, 2012. The anime series is licensed by Sentai Filmworks and streamed on Crunchyroll and Anime Network. ==Synopsis== The is a worldwide business company based in Japan and led by Kumagoro Mikadono. He names his son Shogo heir to his position in the company. However, after Kumagoro dies, his widow Kanoko becomes the new acting chairman as Shogo transfers to his father's alma mater Miryuin Private Academy. According to his father's will, Shogo will take over the company after he graduates provided that he finds a life partner before then. Fortunately, there is a large female population at Miryuin Academy to choose from. Life at the Academy will not be all smooth sailing, however. He is immediately popular because of his name and position as heir to Kumagoro's company and has caught the eye of several female students. To complicate matters further, although he was raised as an only child, Shogo apparently has a younger half-sister who was raised separately who also goes to the same school and intends to get closer to him without revealing her true identity. How will he act knowing that any girl he chooses to be his life partner may also be his sister? ==Characters== Main characters ; : :The male protagonist who is the heir of the Mikadono Group. For him to take over as chairman of the Group, he needs to graduate from school as well as find a life partner. However, things become complicated when he learns that his father, Kumagoro, had an illegitimate daughter who is watching over him as well as attending the same school. This leads to Shogo trying to find his sister. He has a scar on his forehead from an accident when he was kid that caused him to lose some of his memories. Eventually Shogo chooses Konoe to be his lover but she is revealed to be Kumagoro's illegitimate daughter. Eventually, it is revealed that he is not Kumagoro's biological son and thus they are not related. ; : :A black-haired young girl who attends the same school as Shogo and also the first friend he makes on his first day of his new life. Very curious and believing in destined meetings, she is in the same class as Shogo as well as the class representative. She loves creme puffs. She revealed later that she was Shogo's childhood friend and feels responsible for the accident which landed him in hospital. She has the same phone as the mysterious shadowy figure shown once calling Shogo. It is later revealed that she was also the one who sent him the cake, photo, and action figure on his birthday. She initially called him using the voice of Perin a character from \\"Transforming Warrior Granberion\\". She is in love with Shogo. This is underscored when she tells Shogo, \\"When we were kids, I wanted to be your sister. I figured we could be together forever that way.\\" The phone she used was a prototype developed by her father with a rare voice changer feature. Eventually she becomes Shogo's lover but also reveals that she is Kumagoro's illegitimate daughter. However, in volume 9 it is discovered that Shogo is not Kumagoro's biological son and thus she is not really Shogo's sister. ; : :Another classmate of Shogo and a member of the swimming club. Miyabi revealed that she met Shogo at the hospital where he was recovering from his accident—whenever her father went in for treatments, she would play outside with him. When Shogo first attempted to speak to her upon meeting her in class, she refused to talk to him. After that, she overheard his conversation with Konoe and after seeing them almost kiss, demands that he kiss her. She reasons that after Shogo calls Konoe \\"just a classmate,\\" it should be fine for him to kiss her as well. When she tells Shogo of their previous relationship together, she also confesses (with Konoe present) that she fell in love with Shogo as a child and along with Konoe was elated upon learning of his transfer to their school. She is competitive with Konoe about wanting to marry Shogo, to the point where they will argue about it in front of him. As the story progresses, she often interrupts romantic moments between Shogo and Konoe. At the end of the anime and in volume 4 of the novel, she is believed to be his sister. However, in volume 8, after another DNA test it is discovered that she is actually his cousin. Eventually, Miyabi becomes Shogo's stepsister when her father and Kanoko marry. ; : :Rinka is the blonde first- year student council vice-president of Miryuin Private Academy and it is implied that she was brought up in a noble family. After Shogo transferred into Miryuin, Konoe calls her \\"a princess to the core.\\" Rinka keeps Mana in line and is shown to be very good at dancing. She is a distant character who has a tendency to be competitive. Rinka reveals that school director Genda asked her to find Shogo's sister so that he would have leverage when working with the Mikadono Group. Rinka uses Sagara's phone to make her fake sister announcement to threaten the director. Shogo was able to figure out her scheme and subsequently volunteered to pretend to be her lover to invalidate her engagement to director Genda's son. Thereafter, Rinka decided to pursue Shogo as her true boyfriend. ; : :The student council president of Miryuin Private Academy. She has a childish personality, and is generally on the quieter side except for big events, where she gets really excited and tends to be more outgoing and loud. ; : :A third-year silver-haired bespectacled girl who dresses as a witch. She runs the Lyrical Sister Café which she describes as \\"a dream-like café where anyone can become an older brother or older sister!\\" Prior to the story, her biological parents abandoned her as a toddler because of her mathematical intellect and she was adopted by a university professor. She lived with her adoptive mother who owned and ran the café until she died. Afterwards Mei lived with her father in Massachusetts until she earned enough money to buy back the café. She and Konoe have the same brand phone. It is later revealed that she knows the identity of Shogo's sister, but does not want to expose her to the Mikadono family because she is an illegitimate child. After Shogo promises to protect her, she responds that she will reveal his sister's identity if he proves that he can be a good older brother. ; : :A mysterious girl who poses as Shogo's real sister. However she is revealed to be responsible for the incidents that have occurred around him at the school. Her real name is , a famous former child actress who starred as Perin in \\"Transforming Warrior Granberion\\", Shogo's favorite show during his childhood. It is revealed that she is in allegiance with rivals of the Mikadono Group to cause a scandal for Shogo. Supporting characters ; : :A member of the Seiryu Association. Initially introduced as \\"Mister X\\", she was sent to investigate on the identity of Shogo's younger sister while disguising herself as a male student in Miryuin Private Academy. She often sneaks into Shogo's apartment to use his shower as part of her routine. She is trying to become a modern day ninja, and as the Seiryu Association is men-only, she disguised herself as a guy to become part of the association. She often puts Shogo in awkward situations. ; : : Shogo's father, who was the chairman of the Mikadono Group. He is also a friend of Konoe's father. He is assumed to have fathered an illegitimate daughter but Kanoko does not want anything to do with the child, thus Shogo has no leads as to who the girl's identity is. ; : : Shogo's mother. She becomes the acting chairman of the Mikadono Group until Shogo is ready to take over. ; : :Secretary and a close aide of Kanoko. Shogo entrusted her help to perform a DNA test to verify his real sister. However, she was discovered by Ikusu to be in allegiance with Yuzurina to invalidate Shogo's bid to take over the Mikadono Group. ; : : A first year student and a waitress at Lyrical Sisters Café. She is also cheerful and cute. ; : : She is the diminutive homeroom teacher in the class Shogo attends. Her personality is very aggressive, and she hates people who ask stupid questions. On top of that, she looks like a child due to her small stature. ==Media== Light novels Manga Anime Nakaimo - My Sister Is Among Them!, was adapted into a twelve episode anime with a special OVA episode. In April, 2012 it was announced that Studio Gokumi would be adapting the light novel series into an anime for an airing sometime in June. Between April 5, and June 28 promotional ads were streamed announcing the anime's start date to be July 6, 2012 by TBS. In September 2012 Japanese production company Media factory released the entire series on DVD and Blu-ray, a special unaired OVA entitled \\"Brother, Sister, Lover\\" was bundled with the release. In addition to the OVA, bonus material included footage from a special event that took place on July 16. The Blu-ray's jacket also features cover art done by the illustrator of the light novel series. Shortly after its first airing in Japan, Crunchyroll announced in July of that year that it would stream live a subtitled version of the series with the new episodes that come out. In addition, Anime Network also streamed episodes alongside crunchyroll. Sentai Filmworks later announced during Otakon 2012 that took place in late July, that it had acquired the license to the series. Sentai confirmed the cast for the English dub in October 2013. The following month, the series was released in North America on November 12, 2013. { style=\\"width:100%; margin:auto; background:#FFF;\\" - style=\\"border-bottom: 3px solid #CCF\\" ! style=\\"width:3em;\\"  No. !

Allen Moody from THEM anime reviews, gave the series one star out of five. He called the plot a simple mystery that isn't challenging, and pointed out multiple anime clichés such as the loss of important childhood memories. Andy Hanley from UK Anime Network gave the first four episodes of the series a 2/10 rating citing many plot holes, and \\"wafer thin\\" characters. He goes on to say good things though about the character designs and animation as the only redeeming qualities. Chris Beveridge from the Fandom Post gave the series a more positive review saying that there are likeable main characters, with each earning \\"their time in the sun\\". Chris had previously given the first two episodes a C rating calling the animation \\"very cheap and stiff\\" in a lot of scenes, and Shogo's character \\"bland\\". Active Anime also gave the series a good review, describing it as good for people who love romantic comedies with fan service. The review also points out that they left the anime ending on a \\"pretty good\\" spot in the story as the light novel series hadn't finished in Japan. Jeff Chuang from Japanator called the series \\"above average\\" for its harem genre, but also said it isn't an anime for those who cannot handle the intense sex jokes. ==Notes== : The dates in the source used go by Japanese Standard Time. ==References* Nakaimo anime at Sentai Filmworks (English licenser) * English dub at Crunchyroll * Category:2010 Japanese novels Category:2011 manga Category:2012 anime television series Category:Anime and manga based on light novels Category:Harem anime and manga Category:Light novels Category:Media Factory manga Category:MF Bunko J Category:Kadokawa Dwango franchises Category:Seinen manga Category:Sentai Filmworks Category:Studio Gokumi Category:Television shows based on light novels Category:Tokyo Broadcasting System original programming ","title":"Nakaimo – My Sister Is Among Them!"},{"id":"35226514","text":"Thomas \\"Tom\\" Bugg was a professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1920s.

MAgPIE was developed and is employed by the land-use group working at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). It links regional economic information with grid-based biophysical constraints simulated by the dynamic vegetation and hydrology model LPJmL. MAgPIE considers spatially-explicit patterns of production, land use change and water constraints in different world regions, consistently linking economic development with food and energy demand. ==The Model== Input data and output parameters of MAgPIE The model is based on static yield functions in order to model potential crop productivity and its related water use. For the biophysical supply simulation, spatially explicit 0.5° data is aggregated to a consistent number of clusters. Ten world regions represent the demand side of the model. Required calories for the demand categories (food and non-food energy intake) are determined by a cross- sectional country regression based on population and income projections. In order to fulfill the demand, the model allocates 19 cropping and 5 livestock activities to the spatially-explicit land and water resources, subject to resource, management and cost constraints. From 1995 MAgPIE simulates time- steps of 10 years. For each period the optimal land use pattern from the previous period is used as a starting point. ==Demand== The demand for agricultural products is fixed for every region and every time-step. The drivers of agricultural demand are: time, income and population growth. Total demand is composed of: food demand, material demand, feed demand and seed demand. Food demand depends on food energy demand, and the share of crop and livestock products in the diet. Within livestock products, the share of different products (Ruminant meat, chicken meat, other meat, milk, eggs) is fixed at 1995 levels. The same is valid for the share of crops within total food calories and material demand. The share of livestock products in the total consumed food calories is an important driver for the land-use sector. Different statistical models are used to estimate plausible future scenarios. A calibration is used to reach the livestock shares of the Food Balance Sheets for 1995 for each region. Feed for livestock is produced as a mixture of concentrates, fodder, livestock products (e.g. bone meal), pasture, crop residues and conversion by-products (e.g. rapeseed cake) at predefined proportions. These differences in the livestock systems cause different emission levels from livestock. ==Biophysical Inputs== The biophysical inputs for the simulations are obtained from the grid-based model LPJmL. The global vegetation model with managed land (LPJmL) also delivers values for water availability and requirements for each grid cell as well as the carbon content of the different vegetation types. Cropland, pasture, and irrigation water are fixed inputs in limited supply in each grid cell. ==Cost Types== MAgPIE takes four different cost types into account: production costs for crop and livestock production, investments in technological change, land conversion costs and intra-regional transport costs. By minimizing these four cost components on a global scale for the current time step, the model solution is obtained. Production costs in MAgPIE imply costs for labor, capital and intermediate inputs. They are specific for all crop and livestock types and are implemented as costs per area for crops (US$/ha) and costs per production unit of livestock (US$/ton). MAgPIE has two options to increase total production in agriculture at additional costs: land expansion and intensification. In MAgPIE the latter can be achieved by investments in technological change (TC). Investing in technological change triggers yield increases which lead then to a higher total production. At the same time the corresponding increases in agricultural land-use intensity raises costs for further yield increases. The reason is that intensification on land which is already used intensively is more expensive than intensification on extensively-used land. To increase production another alternative is to expand cropland into non-agricultural land. The conversion causes additional costs for the preparation of new land and basic infrastructure investments, which are also taken into account. Intraregional transport costs arise for each commodity unit as a function of the distance to intraregional markets and therefore restrict land expansion in MAgPIE. This depends on the quality and accessibility of infrastructure. Intra-regional transport costs are higher for less accessible areas than for more accessible regions. This leads to higher overall costs of cropland expansion in those cases. ==References== Category:Land use Category:Mathematical modeling ","title":"MAgPIE"},{"id":"35226522","text":"Captain William Parker Jackson House is a historic residence in the Seminole Heights area of Tampa, Florida.

Ananda Rau (21 September 1893 – 22 January 1966) was an eminent Indian mathematician and a contemporary of Ramanujan. Though Rau was six years junior to Ramanujan, his mathematical trajectory, unlike Ramanujan's, was very much a conventional one and he had decided to pursue a career in mathematics well before Ramanujan's prowess became known. ==Biography== Ananda Rau is seated on the high stool at the far left along with Ramanujan in the front chair Ananda Rau was born in Madras on 21 September 1893. He attended the Hindu School in Triplicane, Madras and then Presidency College of the University of Madras. After a brilliant academic record, he sailed to England in 1914 only a few months after Ramanujan. After finishing his Mathematical Tripos from King's College, Cambridge, in 1916, he, like Ramanujan, came under the influence of G. H. Hardy, who guided and initiated him into active research. At Cambridge, Rau and Ramanujan became good friends. Moreover, Ramanujan's \\"most devoted friend\\" R. Ramachandra Rao, who was a District Collector, was Ananda Rau's relative. Ramachandra Rao, was responsible for mentoring Ramanujan on seeing his prowess in research, and provided financial aid, took care of his daily needs and got him a clerk's job at the Madras Port Trust. Though Ananda Rau met Ramanujan for the first time in England, he would have come to know of Ramanjuan through his relationship with Rao. Ananda Rau returned to India in 1919 and was appointed as a professor of mathematics at Presidency College at the age of 26. Later, he served also as the Principal of the college and retired in 1948. His life was not without tragedy, as his wife died at a young age in 1928 and a daughter in 1940. He himself suffered various disabilities, including blindness in one eye, in his later years. He died on 22 January 1966, at the age of 72. ==Academic work== As a student, Rau wrote an essay under Hardy's guidance that fetched him the coveted Smith Prize in 1917, following which he was also elected a fellow of King's College. Along with Hardy, Rau did a considerable amount of work on \\"Summability\\" and convergence properties of infinite series. In fact, a theorem named after Rau figures in Hardy's book. Rau published several papers, primarily in three fields: summability of series, theory of functions of a complex variable and sums of an even number of squares. Among the first papers he wrote after his return was on the subject of the Riemann zeta function, and the technique devised by Rau was found to have wide applicability in other problems of number theory. ==Teaching influence== Ananda Rau taught several well-known mathematicians, including Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, K. S. Chandrasekharan, S Minakshisundaram, C T Rajagopal, C S Venkitaraman and M V Subbarao. His students regarded him as an inspiring teacher who emphasized that mathematics is an activity requiring immersion and dedication and is not for spectators. The story of Indian mathematics beyond Ramanujan begins with Rau and it is essentially Rau's students and descendants who constituted the Indian school of number theory. ==References== * * *www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2719/stories/20100924271911400.htm * Ramanujan by Bruce C.

The unit started to be raised in 1966 and was disbanded in 1975 due to the events of the Carnation Revolution in Lisbon, the end of the Portuguese Colonial War and the independence of Angola. In military history, it was probably one of the last units of real dragoons (mounted infantry) to be used in combat operations, excluding the Rhodesian Grey's Scouts. A similar unit was being raised to operate in the Mozambican War of Independence, when it ended in 1974. The designation \\"Dragoons of Angola\\" was just an honorary title. The official name of the unit was \\"Reconnaissance Group of Angola\\" until 1968 and then \\"1st Cavalry Group\\". ==History== Portugal had historically employed units of dragoons in its colonies from the 18th through to the early 20th centuries. Particularly in Angola, squadrons of dragoons fought in the pacification campaigns of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as in the World War I. In 1966, the Portuguese Army created an experimental horse platoon, to operate against the guerrillas in the high grass region of the Eastern Angola. Each soldier of this unit was armed with a G3 assault rifle to use in combat on foot, and with a Walther P38 automatic pistol to use while on horseback.ABBOTT, Peter, VOLSTAD, Ronald, \\"Modern African Wars (2) - Angola and Mozambique 1961–74\\", Osprey Publishing, 1988 The troops on horseback were able to operate in difficult terrain (unsuited for motor vehicles), were less vulnerable to landmines and had the advantage of being able to control the area around them, with a clear view over the grass (which foot troops did not have). Moreover, these unconventional troops created a psychological impact over the enemy, who were not accustomed to dealing with horse troops and had no kind of training or strategy with which to face them.ABBOTT, Peter, VOLSTAD, Ronald, \\"Modern African Wars (2) - Angola and Mozambique 1961–74\\", Osprey Publishing, 1988 The experimental horse platoon was so successful that its entire parent battalion (the Reconnaissance Group of Angola) was transformed from an armoured reconnaissance unit - equipped mainly with Panhard EBR armoured cars - to a three squadron horse battalion known as the \\"Dragoons of Angola\\". One of the typical operations carried out by the Dragoons of Angola, in cooperation with airmobile forces, consisting of the dragoons chasing the guerrillas and pushing them into one direction, with the airmobile troops being launched from helicopter in the enemy rear, getting it trapped between the two forces.CANN, Jonh P., \\"Counterinsurgency in Africa: The Portuguese Way of War, 1961-1974\\", Hailer Publishing, 2005 ==ReferencesLinks== *Dragões de Angola (1961-1975) (in Portuguese) Angola Category:Portuguese Angola Category:Portuguese Army Category:Cavalry regiments of Portugal Category:Portuguese Colonial War Category:Angolan War of Independence Category:Military history of Angola Category:1960s in Angola Category:1970s in Angola Category:1966 establishments in Angola Category:1975 disestablishments in Angola ","title":"Dragoons of Angola"},{"id":"35226594","text":"Malaun () is a pejorative term for Bengali Hindus, most commonly used in Bangladesh. The word is derived from the Arabic \\"ملعون\\", meaning \\"accursed\\" or \\"deprived of God's Mercy\\", and in modern times, it is used as an ethnic slur by the Muslims in Bengal for Hindus. == Etymology == The Arabic word \\"ملعون\\" (mal'un), literally meaning 'cursed' is derived from the root \\"لعنة\\" (la'nat) meaning \\"curse\\". In Islamic parlance, it means 'deprived of Allah's mercy'. The word has been loaned into languages of non-Arabic Islamic countries like Malay and Indonesian. The dictionary published by the Bangla Academy gives the meaning of the Bengali word \\"মালাউন\\" as someone cursed or deprived of Allah's mercy or forcefully evicted or a Kafir. It mentions that the word is used as a slur by the Muslims against the non-Muslims. In Bangladesh, the word is more specifically used to refer to the Hindu religious minority. In colloquial usage, the word is sometimes shortened to Malu. == Usage == Nirmal Kumar Bose noted the usage of the term as early as 1946 in Noakhali. During the 1971 Bangladesh Genocide, the Pakistani officers addressed Dr. Govinda Chandra Dev as malaun before executing him. According to eyewitness, AKM Yusuf had addressed a gathering of Peace Committee at Rampal in Khulna district on 19 April. At the gathering he addressed the Hindus as malauns and the Hindu women as spoils of war and exhorted the audience to kill them and loot their women. Hussain Muhammad Ershad, while serving as the President, had referred to the Hindus as malaun at a rally in Chhatak. He apologized for his remark after protests from the Hindus. In December 2013, Ganajagaran Mancha presented a deputation to the Home Ministry complaining about police torture. The deputation alleged that on 19 December 2013 the police abused a Hindu woman activist as malaun because she had put sindur. In December 2014, Nasiruddin Pintu, a convicted BNP politician, abused a Bengali Hindu police officer by calling him a malaun when he attempted to stop his lawyers and supporters from meeting Pintu illegally. Pintu threatened the officer with loss of job and called him son of a pig. In January 2015, Awami League workers Shahnawaz and Anwaruzzaman Chowdhury abused fellow Awami League worker Sushanta Dasgupta at a party function in London. In the Internet, a Jamaat-e-Islami run handle named Basher Kella has given the call for killing all the malauns and turning Bangladesh into a country where only the Muslims will live. == Impact on Hindu society == In few schools and colleges in Bangladesh, the Hindu pupils are frequently abused by their classmates by calling them malauns.

It was adapted into an anime television series animated by Madhouse and Studio Gokumi that aired from July 9, 2012, to September 24, 2012. Sentai Filmworks licensed the series in 2014 and released the series on December 16, 2014, along with an English dub. ==Plot== Suddenly finding himself in the Sengoku period, average high school student Yoshiharu Sagara is about to be killed on the battlefield. He is saved by none other than the man who would later become the respected Toyotomi Hideyoshi, but at the cost of the latter's life. With the course of history altered as a result of these events, Yoshiharu tries to make things right again. Yoshiharu, however, is surprised to discover that the people he meets, the places he encounters, and the historical events he is dragged into are somewhat different than what he remembers from his favorite Sengoku era video game – Nobunaga's Ambition. Yoshiharu soon discovers that, in this version of the Sengoku period, Nobunaga Oda does not exist – instead being replaced by a young woman named Nobuna Oda who holds his position as a daimyō. Yoshiharu begins working under Nobuna's command, who nicknames him , with hopes of correcting the course of history and finding his way back home to the present-day world. ==Characters== Oda Clan ; : : A modern-day teenager who finds himself in an alternative version of the Sengoku period where some of the famous warlords of the era are female. Taking on the historical role of Hideyoshi Toyotomi, who died while saving Yoshiharu's life, Yoshiharu swears to fulfill the dead man's dream of becoming a feudal lord and becoming popular with the ladies by using his knowledge from the videogame, Nobunaga's Ambition to foresee future events and help Nobuna in her quest to unite and conquer Japan and to hopefully change her real life counterpart's fate in the Incident at Honno-ji. Others also refer to him by the nickname \\"Saru\\" (\\"Monkey\\") much to his chagrin, and he becomes Nobuna's punching bag whenever she gets mad or emotional. ; : :The daimyō of Owari. She has a tsundere attitude. Known by her enemies as the \\"Big Fool of Owari\\", she is a brilliant and ambitious teenage girl who plans to conquer and unite Japan to strengthen the nation and allow it to stand on equal ground with advanced European nations. An admirer of foreign culture and items, their influences inspire Nobuna's ambition. Throughout the series she is troubled by her position of leadership. As a person who is kind at heart, she seeks to rule with benevolence, fairness and kindness. However, she often finds herself in positions where she must make decisions that could compromise the integrity of her idealism. She begins to develop romantic feelings for Yoshiharu, which culminates with them entering into a secret love relationship later in the light novels. She also gets angry with Jūbei's inability to read the atmosphere as well as her constant interruptions whenever Nobuna and Yoshiharu try to share some quality time alone. ; : :Also known as Jūbei, she is a brilliant tactician and strategist - although her strategies are renowned for their ruthlessness and cruelty. Originally a loyal and dutiful general of the Saitō clan, she later becomes one of Nobuna's most important generals after Dōsan Saitō, leader of the Saitō clan, allies himself with Nobuna. Due to her pride and ambition, Jūbei wants nothing more than to be acknowledged by others, especially by Nobuna - who she admires very much. She has the unfortunate inability to read the mood and atmosphere in the room and has interrupted Nobuna and Yoshiharu's romantic moments on more than one occasion under the pretext of protecting Nobuna (as her relationship with Yoshiharu is supposed to be a secret). After saving Yoshiharu's life at Kanegasaki, Jūbei begins to develop feelings for him, even to the extent of trying to marry him, even though she would constantly deny her feelings towards him until the events of volume 11. This dismays Nobuna to the point she considers executing Jūbei. During the events on volume 11, Mitsuhide finally came to admit her true feelings to him, even though the relationship between Nobuna and Yoshiharu has been exposed to Japan, she would still try to marry him, despite what has been revealed to the public. Because of Jūbei's role in the death of the real life Oda Nobunaga, Yoshiharu tries his best to avoid the Incident at Honno-ji as he is aware of everything that takes place before and after said incident. ; : :Nicknamed Riku, she is a general serving under Nobuna. Originally, she was an aide to Nobuna's younger brother, Nobukatsu, but her true loyalty lay with Nobuna. Due to an agreement that was made after one of Nobukatsu's failed rebellions, she officially became one of Nobuna's retainers. She wears a steel breastplate that accentuates the shape of her bosom and is easily angered by those who stare at it. She develops a desire to be more feminine when she realizes that many warriors see and fear her as \\"Demon Shibata\\", going so far as to have Yoshiharu give her some dubious advice. After the war between the Oda clan and the Asai-Asakura alliance, she is made the daimyō of Echizen. ; : :Nicknamed Manchiyo, she serves as the Oda faction tactician. She enjoys teasing others, and has a habit of assigning \\"points\\" to indicate her approval or disapproval of anything from battle strategies to bad jokes. She is considered to be the big sister of the group and cares for Nobuna greatly. After the war between the Oda clan and the Asai- Asakura alliance, she governs over Wakasa and Nobuna has her oversee the construction of the now famous Azuchi Castle. ; : :Also known as \\"Danjō\\", she is a daimyō, but also one of Nobuna's retainers. A practitioner of witchcraft, she is also called \\"The Witch of Civil Wars\\" and is able to change her pipe into a spear or a sword and can use teleportation and illusion magic. She is despised by most of Japan's daimyōs due to her mysterious witchcraft. As a result of being hated, she allied with the only group of people who would have her - the Miyoshi Three - and sought to burn the country to the ground. During the Battle at Kiyomizu Temple however, Danjō recognized that many of Nobuna's allies were people like her, hated and with no place in the country. Finally finding people who would accept her, she surrendered and joined the Oda faction as a strategist. Danjō believes that Nobuna will have to become a \\"demon\\" to unite Japan and temporarily attempted to steer her in that direction, much to the disapproval of Nobuna's other retainers. However, she is genuinely loyal to the \\"Fool of Owari\\" and respects her rather naive and hopeful dreams. She was acquainted with Saitō Dōsan in the past. :Danjō betrays Nobuna in Volume 9, when she plans to destroy the Todai Temple in Yamato, killing any monk who stands in her way using her war elephants and drugging troops, before marching to Kyoto and attempting to kill Nobuna. Despite her betrayal, Nobuna can't bring herself to hate her, as she still sees her as a mother figure. When Nobuna confronts her, she revealed that she only caused that rebellion to make the monks unite against her and have Nobuna appear as a hero. She also tells Nobuna of the plans of Konoe Sakihisa and reveals that she plans to die at the Tamonyama Castle in order to bear the blame of Nobuna's past actions and restore her goddaughter's good name. Despite refusing to leave her godmother, Nobuna reluctantly agrees to her last request, promising not become a demon lord. Danjō then commits suicide by setting Tamonyama Castle on fire. At dawn, Nobuna sees a comet, as Danjō predicted, that was called \\"Danjō’s star\\". ; : :A ninja who stutters and bites her tongue whenever she has to speak extensively. She serves under Yoshiharu, having sworn fealty to her former master Kinoshita Toukichirou and pledged to find a lord and be promoted together. She is also the leader of a task force of militiamen, brigands, and hunters who adore her and are willing to lay their lives on the line for her. Very little is known about her past as she does not talk about herself much. Due her small build, she is a very capable spy and is able to infiltrate prisons and castles with little trouble and she is also able to hold her own in a fight. ; : :Nicknamed Inuchiyo, she is a young girl who is one of the best spear wielders of the Oda faction. She is also part of Yoshiharu's loyal followers and serves as his personal bodyguard. Unlike her anime counterpart, in the light novel she does not initially wear her tiger headdress and she is temporarily exiled after cutting down Nobukatsu's page but returns during the Battle of Mino. ; : :A highly intelligent strategist who serves Yoshiharu directly and, through serving him, serves Nobuna. Initially a general of the Saitō clan, she remained loyal to the clan even after Yoshitatsu overthrew his father. She hates meaningless bloodshed and prefers using strategies that cause the fewest casualties possible. Hanbē, being a timid girl, is afraid of the overbearing Yoshitatsu and tries to perform her duties as a Saitō clan strategist without having to enter into physical proximity of him. Yoshitatsu, however, sees this as treason and has her uncle arrested to force her into appearing before him. Hanbē later defects to the Oda clan after Yoshiharu and his allies rescue her and her uncle from Yoshitatsu. Due to how kind Yoshiharu is to her, she swears her loyalty to him rather than Nobuna, but is willing to help him achieve Nobuna's ambition. As an Onmyōji, she can summon powerful Shikigami familiars. She suffers from poor health and is very frail and delicate as a result. Her health slowly begins to decline during the Asai-Asakura war and worsens right before the Battle of Harima. Because of this, Yoshiharu fears that she will eventually succumb to the fate of her real life counterpart. ; : :Hanbē's double and familiar. He is protective of his master against those who threaten her. As a Kitsune, he is a powerful and intelligent spirit. He foretells that Yoshiharu will have \\"women trouble\\" which comes true many times throughout the story. He overhears Yoshiharu's meeting with Hanbei, Kanbei, and Goemon in which he informs them of Nobuna and Shikanosuke's real life fates. Zenki sacrifices himself (as he was already to weak to reform if he was destroyed) to allow Yoshiharu rescue Kanbei. Before returning to the afterlife, he calls Yoshiharu his friend, as he made him feel like a living person for the first time in many centuries. His spirit spoke to Yoshiharu before finally disappearing. His true form is . ; : :A childish girl and Yoshiharu's neighbor who treats Yoshiharu as her older brother. This relationship was arranged as a joke to fulfill Nobuna's promise to Yoshiharu to give him the most beautiful girl in the land\\". Nobuna also uses Nene to keep Yoshiharu in check and to keep him from flirting with other women. ; : :A female samurai and scout of the Oda clan. ; : :Another female samurai and scout of the Oda clan. ; :The daimyō of Ise and a retainer of Nobuna. She is almost identical to Himiko, but their personalities are opposites. Like Himiko, she also has certain psychic powers; in her case she can force anyone to answer any question she asks truthfully by touching the forehead of said person. She is also a Ninja and apparently dislikes battles on land. She also has an army of female pirates who are willing to do almost anything for her. ; :The leader of the female- only Kuki Pirates and a retainer of Takigawa Kazumasu. She is apparently on an age where her subordinates worry about her single marital status. ; :The Head of the Kuroda Clan, also called the Nanban Samurai and Don Simon. As a former Onmyōji, she's an expert in western knowledge and machinery. She believes she has a way to return Yoshiharu to his own time. Kanbei believes in Nobuna's goal of taking control of Japan and that she can achieve it. She also believes that Yoshiharu is a hindrance to this goal. This is because Yoshiharu spared Imagawa Yoshimoto, who should have died and then later became the shōgun, which caused the Oda forces to clash with the Ashikage shogunate's surviving members. She is assigned by Nobuna to be Yoshiharu's second strategist, much to her chagrin and helps him to ally the Oda Clan with the Harima Daimyo and so stop the advance of the Mōri clan. Eventually, she comes to realise that she is not as capable a strategist as she believed herself to be, easily getting herself and Yoshiharu caught in a trap set by the enemy. :After Yoshiharu informs to her, Goemon and Hanbei about the Incident at Hannon-ji, she begins to understand the truth about why Nobuna's plans were doomed and comes to admire Yoshiharu's resolve, noticing that he's got too much on his plate as it is, she decides to avoid telling him about Hanbei's illness and resolves to do something about that herself instead. She becomes so strong in this resolve that she ignores all warnings and goes to meet with Ukita Naoie in the hopes of bringing him to their side to relieve Hanbei's stress, as their plan involved forcing him to surrender anyway. This fails, of course, and she is imprisoned for several days with the condition of her freedom being Yamanaka Shikanosuke's surrender before the Mōri Clan's arrival or she will be executed. She's rescued by Yoshiharu and after she and Hanbei begin to recover from their respective conditions, they become nearly as close as sisters. ; :A former retainer of the Amako clan and an enemy of the Mōri clan, who're responsible for destroying the Amako clan and is the leader of the Amako's Heroes. Due to the many betrayals she had suffered in the past, she has great difficulty in trusting Yoshiharu's resolve to keep her from surrendering herself to the Mōri c, since Zenki, who overheard Yoshiharu's meeting with Hanbei, Kanbei, and Goemon, revealed to her her real life counterpart's fate but upon seeing Yoshiharu's determination and sincere care for her, she accepts him as her master and becomes his retainer. Due to her suggestive talk and behavior toward suffering and pain, Yoshiharu suspects she is a masochist. ; :Nobuna and Nobukatsu's mother. She has a very estranged relationship with her daughter, which worsens even more when she thinks Nobuna killed Nagamasa Asai. ; :The Oda clan's latest addition, who suddenly appears to help Nobuna and Yoshiharu decide the best strategy against the threat of the Mōri clan, the Honbyo Temple, and Uesugi Kenshin. She once was a hostage of the Oda clan, but came to admire Nobuna and became her sworn-sister. She dislikes Yoshiharu for his closeness towards Nobuna. Ujisato proposes that the only way they can defeat so many enemies is for Nobuna to become a living god, like Kenshin, to ensure the devotion of their followers. She believes that Yoshiharu's purpose has been fulfilled and must leave Nobuna's side to ensure she can realize her dream, despite the objections of both. Before leaving she gives Nobuna the Yasakani no Magatama and mentions that she will eventually need the divine power of the three relics. Although Nobuna and Yoshiharu believe she's too innocent about her intentions, Kazumasu suspects she has a hidden motive. Saitō Clan ; : :The daimyō of Mino. Known as the Viper of Mino, he is a politically ambitious man. Originally, he wanted to start a war with Nobuna, but after hearing her dreams and Yoshiharu's explanation of what he will be known in the future, he allies with Oda faction by making Nobuna his heir. Unfortunately, this angered his son Yoshitatsu who launches rebellion against him, forcing Dōsan, his daughter Kichō and Mitsuhide to exile to Owari. After the defeat of his son, however, he was able to retake his position as daimyō of Mino. As a father figure to her, Nobuna cares about Dōsan who she considers her stepfather. Although he was supposed to die by the hand of his son, Yoshitatsu, Yoshiharu convinced him to flee thus saving his life. Later in the light novels, he begins to suffer from an unknown illness presumably Cancer. He succumbs to his illness during Nobuna's battle against Shingen Takeda causing the former great grief. Only Yoshiharu was able to console her proving that Dōsan's trust in the young man was not in vain. ; :Dōsan's daughter. When Yoshitatsu rebelled against his father Dōsan, Dōsan hastily sent his daughter Kichō and Mitsuhide to Nobuna in Owari for their sake of safety. Matsudaira (Tokugawa) Clan ; : :The daimyō of Mikawa and the future Ieyasu Tokugawa. She was merely a gentle and soft minor vassal of the Imagawa until the Battle of Okehazama. After the Imagawa were defeated at Okehazama, she gained independence and formed an alliance with Nobuna. She is the only character in the series to wear eye glasses which were later used as a joke in the light novels, and she's got a timid and humble personality as well, with her dress being like that of a raccoon. She and Nobuna were once childhood friends, when she was a hostage of the Oda clan for a while, and she always both fears and respects Nobuna, and always intends to help Nobuna accomplish her dream of conquest, both wherever and whenever possible. ; : :A ninja serving under Motoyasu. As his master served Yoshimoto, he also served under the Imagawas. However he is more loyal to his master when he allows Yoshiharu to report the location of Yoshimoto's army to Nobuna so that his master will no longer be a vassal of the Imagawas. During the Retreat at Kanegasaki, Hanzō pretended to kill Yoshiharu, under the pretext that having Yoshiharu captured, killed and have his severed head on display would be too shameful, in order to fool their enemies into thinking he was dead. Imagawa Shogunate ; : :Former daimyō of Suruga and current shōgun of Japan. Yoshimoto was considered the most likely one to conquer Japan due to possessing the larger force and being related to the Ashikaga clan, the ruling shōguns during that era. However, due to her arrogance, her main army was defeated at Okehazama when the Oda clan launched a surprise attack. Yoshimoto was spared from being killed thanks to Yoshiharu's intervention. Later, Nobuna made Yoshimoto the new shōgun as her figurehead to legitimatize her claim for Kyoto after the Ashikagas went into exile. She is quite attracted to Yoshiharu, though he shows no particular care for this, despite being uncommonly hormonal otherwise. Her hobby is playing soccer or Kemari (蹴鞠), when she'not in battle, often using Motoyasu as a goal keeper. Asai Clan ; : :The daimyō of Ōmi. A manipulative young woman, she is forced to hide her gender because her father, Hisamasa, refuses to accept a woman as a daimyō. She attempts to coerce Nobuna into an alliance by marriage (so she can take credit for Nobuna's victories as her \\"husband\\") by threatening to ally the Asai clan with Nobuna's enemies. However, her various attempts to gain leverage against the Oda fail due to Yoshiharu and his allies. After being told by her father that she would not be allowed back at home until she got married, a desperate Nagamasa agrees to an alliance with Nobuna with no strings attached. The Oda seal the alliance by giving Nagamasa, Nobuna's younger sister, Oichi (in reality Nobuna's younger brother, Nobusumi, disguised as a girl), as her bride. When Nobusumi and Nagamasa discover each other's true gender, they fall deeply in love. This changes Nagamasa's opinion of Nobuna Oda greatly. Previously an enemy and rival of the Oda, she refuses to fight Nobuna at Kanegasaki after the Oda attack the Asakura clan, an ally of the Asai. As a result, Hisamasa imprisons Nagamasa to take over the clan and joins Yoshikage Asakura against Nobuna. Nagamasa later faces Nobusumi in battle but spares his life due to her lingering feelings for him. After Nobuna's victory against Asai Asakura, Hisamasa commits seppuku but not before leaving a message for his daughter to live her life as normal girl. During the Oda clan's celebration with only its key retainers present, Nobuna presents Nagamasa as her sister in-law, Oichi, the name Nobusumi used when he was disguised as a girl and she lives with her husband free of her burdens at last. It is later revealed that she is pregnant with Nobusumi's child. ;// : :Nobuna's younger brother. Convinced by his advisers that his older sister is not fit to be the leader of their clan, he attempted a rebellion only for his sister to peacefully crush it. As a show of gratitude for having his life spared thanks to Yoshiharu, he changed his name to Nobusumi Tsuda and officially renounced the position of the daiymō of Owari. He is protected by a group of female bodyguards, all of whom are in love with him. He later unwillingly becomes a part of his sister's plot when she sends him, disguised as a girl and using the name Oichi, to be married to Nagamasa Asai. Later they fall in love with one another. During the war against Asai Asakura, Nobusumi faces Nagamasa in battle but is spared (albeit injured) due to her conflicting feelings for him and her clan. After the war, the two are finally reunited as lovers when Nobuna takes Nagamasa as her sister in-law under the name of Oichi, Nobusumi's old name when disguised as a girl, and she now lives with him. His wife later reveals that she's pregnant, much to Yoshiharu's jealousy and surprise. Christian Clan ; : :The daimyō of Oushu and the future . She is a companion and bodyguard of Louise Frois and an ally of the Oda clan. Possessing heterochromia, she also has a case of chuunibyou (8th grader adolescent delusions), believing her red eye has special powers which is hidden under an eyepatch. Like Nobuna, she also has an estranged relationship with her mother. :Bontenmaru is also the main character of the Oda Nobuna no Yabō light novel spin off Jakigan Ryū Masamune which focuses on her history and activities during the events of the main novel. ; :Masamune's aide and caretaker. She usually has to deal with Masamune's antics and tries to keep her under control. Due to her androgynous appearance, she is often mistaken for a boy much to her displeasure. ; : :A Portuguese nun and missionary. She has come to Japan to help the sick and defenseless. Noted for extremely large breasts, which she believes are sinful due to how others react to them, however, Sagura Yoshiharu tells her a little of the future he comes from to convince her that she is not a sinner. She has great confidence and hope in Yoshiharu, since they both share same dream, inspiration and desire for establishing a peaceful world for the people, and is willing to don her armour to help out, when Yoshiharu's group is in a big pinch or grave danger. She later accompanies Yoshiharu to Honbyō temple, where they use skits in order to win the trust of the temple's residents. She's the female version of Luís Fróis, who'd befriended the real life Oda Nobunaga. ;Organtino :He is an Italian missionary who first appears alongside the knight Giovanna L'Ortese on Ise Spanish Isle. He later affiliates himself with the Oda Clan due to hearing about Nobuna's openness and good treatment of foreign cultures. He is Louise's junior and looks up to her. ;Giovanna L'Ortese :A knight of the honorable St. John Knights from Spain. She initially was seen as an enemy by Takigawa Kazumasu and her pirate subordinate Kuki Yoshitaka, but, after duelling Sagara Yoshiharu, it was revealed that her intentions were actually not hostile and she becomes a valuable ally against Takeda Shingen. She believes that eating and sleeping are the two most important things to a knight, she will take the opportunity to do either of these things when it comes up and has a habit of blatantly ignoring conversations around her while eating. ; : :A Christian Daiymo and lord of Takatsuki, Osaka who aided the Oda Faction during the Battle at Kiyomizu Temple. ; : :A Christian merchant and samurai who aided the Oda Faction during the Battle at Kiyomizu Temple. He is also father of Augustine Konishi. Miyoshi Triumvirate (Miyoshi Three) Clan ; : :An imperial adviser (kampaku)and one of the leaders of the Miyoshi Triumvirate (Miyoshi Three) Clan. He was a manipulative politician who planned to take control of Japan by overthrowing the Ashikaga Shogunate with his allies and using his position to become Empress Himiko's regent. However, his plans come under threat by the Oda Faction led by Nobuna Oda whom he hates as he views her as lowly country noble. As his plans to destroy the Oda Faction failed, he slowly loses his sanity and in a desperate attempt to finally kill Nobuna, he betray his allies by setting Mount Hiei, where he and his allies are, on fire. He attempts to kill Nobuna by himself but is defeated by her and killed, crushed by the collapsing Enryaku-ji temple. :In the light novels however, he neither fights Nobuna nor dies at Mt. Hiei but he retains his manipulative and arrogant personality. He is verbally defeated by Nobuna and in order to remain alive, she forces him to serve as a messenger in order to subjugate the second rebellion of the Honbyo Temple that he helped provoke. The other condition Nobuna imposes him is that after she unifies Japan he will be forced to, either adopt Yoshiharu and allow him to inherit the Fujiwara clan, or simply pass him the title of Imperial adviser, disinherit him and allow him to take a new name. Despite hating the idea, believing he's protecting Himiko, he reluctantly agrees, but replies that the Fujiwara Clan needs time to decide. He is clearly shocked when he meets Kazumasu. He and Sougyu become terrified when they learn that the Murakami Navy is going to attack Sakai, now the only thing they can do is believe in Nobuna. ; : :A rich merchant from Sakai and a former leader of the Miyoshi Three. He joined Sakihisa's conspiracy hoping to gain a profit from it. After being betrayed by Konoe, however, he made peace with the Oda Faction. ; : :The Buddhist Head monk of Hiei mountain temple and one of former leaders of the Miyoshi Three. He hated foreigners and joined Sakihisa's conspiracy to expel them from Japan for spreading Christianity. As Konoe lit Mount Hiei, a sacred center of Buddhism in Japan, to kill Nobuna, Shoukakuin finally recognized the madness of the imperial adviser. The desperate monk fled the mountain but was captured by Oda forces. Nevertheless, he was released since the Oda tried to save the mountain temple with magic and his prayers would be helpful in doing so. Shortly afterwards Louise Frois joined Gōsei in praying, much to his surprise. Recognizing the benevolent nature of the missionary, the Head monk hesitantly accepted that Christianity was not generally evil and made peace with the Oda and the Christians. ; : :A general formerly working for the Miyoshi Three. He was one of the figurehead leaders of the alliance, but after being defeated at Kyoto, he and his brothers deserted and fled to Shikoku. ; : :Another former general of the Miyoshi Three and Masayasu's brother. Asakura clan ; : :The daimyō of Echizen and a former ally of the Miyoshi Three. Yoshikage desires the most beautiful women in Japan, especially Nobuna. After Konoe betrayed his allies at Hiei mountain, Yoshikage canceled his alliance with the Miyoshi Three. Nevertheless, he is still at war with the Oda Faction. He is called the era's Hikaru Genji and tends to go to his own world when someone mentions him. During the climax of the Asai-Asakura war, he commits suicide when he realizes his defeat and Nobuna's forces burn his prized paintings. ; : :Twin sister generals who serve under the Asakura clan. Beautiful but blood thirsty warriors, the Magara twins wields giant Zanbatō swords. Although famous for their martial arts, they were defeated by Katsuie Shibata during the Burning of Hiei Mountain, but spared from being killed. ; :An Onmyōji at the service of the Asakura Clan and the current leader of the Tsuchimikado clan. He is cruel and quite overconfident, stating the entire reason he appeared was to take Yoshiharu's head for the Azai and Asakura clan's and their alliance. After being defeated by Hanbei, or more specifically Zenki, he began crying and ran away, returning only when Hanbei was rendered powerless and his confidence in defeating her was renewed. Takeda Clan ; :The daimyō of Kai. Called the \\"Tiger of Kai\\", she is one of the strongest generals of the Sengoku period and rivals with the equally renowned Uesugi Kenshin. In her private and personal life, she goes by the name Katsuchiyo and is seen as a lighthearted and cheerful person. She later develops an interest in Yoshiharu, after hearing that he is described to be the \\"man from the heavens\\", going so far as to want him to become the \\"alpha male\\" of the Takeda clan by having him impregnate the clan's generals including Shingen herself hinting she has feelings for him too. She later enters into a temporary alliance with Nobuna. ; :Shingen's younger sister. Uesugi Clan ; :The Daimyo of Echigo. She is a powerful warrior and viewed as a living god, nicknamed both \\"The Dragon of Echigo\\" and \\"The God of War.\\" As a devout and pious figure, she leads her \\"Army of Justice\\" to fight for those who are oppressed and end the chaos of the Sengoku period. Being the rival of Shingen, they have fought each other many times on the battlefield. ; :Kenshin's younger sister. ; :A gifted military advisor of the Uesugi Clan. Hōjō Clan ; : The daimyō of Sagami. Nicknamed the \\"Lion of Sagami\\", she is an ally of Shingen Takeda but dislikes her immensely. Ujiyasu prefers defensive battles that she knows she can win, much to the annoyance of Shingen. She tries to assassinate both Nobuna and Shingen once she realizes both are defenseless, but is stopped by Yoshiharu who accidentally sees that she has a blue mole in her butt, so as to say a \\"Mongolian spot.\\" She swears vengeance on Yoshiharu for that reason but prefers to wait for the right opportunity. She is mocked by Shingen as the \\"Washing Board of Sagami\\" because of her flat chest. ; :The leader of the \\"Nyankōsō\\" cult, a group that adores cats like gods. She believes that the world is full of sadness because of the war caused by the samurai and that laughter is the best way to bring peace. She has the ambition of uniting the whole country under the Nyankōsō and is willing to arm her followers for that purpose, even if that means waging war with the Oda clan. She is half human, half Nekomata, which means she has the ears and tail of a cat, but that also means she is capable of regenerating from a bullet shot. According to Magoichi, Kennyo's biggest weakness is catnip. When Nobuna demands Yoshiharu to be returned to Oda Clan, she refuses and only allows her to negotiate once she makes a successful skit. To decide who keeps Yoshiharu she challenges Nobuna and the Oda retainers to a nanban soccer match. Despite the advantage of having cat-like speed and agility, she loses the game because of her love for comedy, the moment Motoyasu loses her glasses at the last minute of the game, she and her followers begin laughing uncontrollably, which gives Nobuna and Yoshiharu the opportunity to score the victory goal. After losing she accepts disarming her forces, acting as a middleman between the Oda and Takeda forces and agreeing with Nobuna to return Yoshiharu to her side. Both the Oda and the Honbyo Temple's people agree on playing an annual soccer match to relieve the stress and renew peace, vowing to win next time. She suddenly finds herself losing her powers and becoming a normal girl, so her younger sister Kyonya, expels her from the Nyankousou Temple, while she wages war against the Oda Clan under the invitation of Yoshiaki Ashikaga. ;Kyonya :Kennyo's younger sister, who's just like her has cat ears and tail. She hated how her sister changed thanks to Magoichi Saika and never got interested in the skits or soccer games. Unlike her sister who let her emotions controlled her decisions, she's cold and serious. After her sister loses her powers, she expels her from the Honbyo Temple and calls to arms the followers of the Nyankousu, causing a mass rebellion on many fronts that put the Oda on a very dire situation. She allies herself with the Mori Clan and hires the Saika Clan to ensure her victory against Nobuna. Magoichi realizes that she doesn't care about how many people sacrifices their lives for her, as she is seen as an absolute authority by her followers, if it means defeating Nobuna and forcefully uniting the country under the Nyankousu. ; :The leader of the Saika Ikki, a mercenary and an ally of the \\"Nyankōsō\\" and later is hired by the Date clan. While she doesn't believe in the \\"Nekogami\\" she enjoys making skits with Kennya. Magoichi takes a liking to Yoshiharu and even wants him to become her husband. She participates in the Soccer Match to decide who keeps Yoshiharu and is blocked by Goemon, Inuchiyo and Kazumasu. She is an expert at shooting with her arquebus named Yatagarasu and that also means she is deadly at kicking the soccer ball. She nearly kills Yoshiharu when she accidentally shoots Yatagarasu in a moment of acting like the tsukkomi of a skit. Magoichi and the Saika Ikki help the Date Clan to retreat from the siege of the Odawara castle to ensure that the Hōjō clan doesn't pursue them. Once the Honbyo Temple declares war against the Oda Clan again, she and her clan are hired to assist the Murakami Navy in the battle. Despite wanting to resign and join Kennyo and the Oda, her followers convince her otherwise. She reluctantly agrees on fighting against Nobuna and says she's gonna kill her, but in her thoughts she hates herself for being so good at shooting. She also dislikes how Kyonya is willing to sacrifice the lives of her followers in this senseless conflict and fails to persuade her of sending the devotees home, knowing the lack of experience in the battlefield will prove fatal for many of them. ; :The newest aide of Nobuna, in secret she is a spy of Konoe ordered to kill her when the timing is right. She uses lies to make Nobuna believe she can't trust no one and even tried to convince her of executing all her aides in the Oda Clan after Hisahide Matsunaga betrayed her, but when she lied about Yoshiharu and Yamanaka Shikanosuke being in a relationship, her jealousy beats her depression, and when Senchiyo tries to deceive her even more, the sudden appearance of Yoshimoto Imagawa ruined her scheme. Yoshimoto knocks her out with a swift soccer kick. Then she is forced by Nobuna into going with the vanguard of the army against Hisahide. When she tries to kill Nobuna from behind during the chaos, she is stopped by Goemon and taken away from the battlefield. She is then interrogated by Nobuna and Hisahide but refuses to reveal her employer. Hisahide then kills her with a special potion which stops her heart and reveals that she is a Fuma ninja sent by the Hōjō Clan. Her body is later burned alongside Hisahide's when Tamonyama Castle is set on fire. It is later revealed that, thanks to the power of the Ranjatai, her body and soul fused with those of Hisahide's, creating a new person, as Matsunaga felt pity for the young ninja. She now calls herself \\"Flower Princess\\" Kashinkoji, \\"a resident from the world of dreams\\". Mōri Clan ; :The 14th Ashikaga shōgun and Yoshimoto's rival. Yoshiaki was the younger sister of Yoshiteru Ashikaga, the 13th Ashikaga Shogun before the Miyoshi Three launches a coup d'état against her brother. Fearing for their safety, Yoshiteru and his sister fled to China in exile and relinquishes his title. Upon learning that her cousin Yoshimoto became the new shōgun and the Miyoshi Three were defeated by Nobuna Oda, Yoshiaki, angered that Yoshimoto \\"stole\\" the Shogunate, returns to the Japan to claim back what is rightfully hers. Declaring herself as the 14th Ashikaga shōgun after having her brother give up the title, Yoshiaki returns to Japan with the help of the Mōri clan and seeks help from the Oda faction's rivals to regain the shogunate. ; :The daimyō of Bizen and an ally of the Mōri clan and Yoshiaki Ashikaga. He serves the Mōri Clan to ensure his position, otherwise his lands are going to be confiscated, and he forced to commit seppuku. Treacherous and dangerous, he used many devious schemes to acquire his position. He is also an expert sniper. He often prefers to manipulate his enemies and lure them into various traps while using many strategies that stop the defense of Harima, frustrating and infuriating Yoshiharu, Hanbei and Kanbei. While he manipulates women and kills men without hesitation, apparently he would never hurt a female. He captures Kanbei and almost forces her to surrender, but she refuses his offer. He threatens to execute Kanbei unless they surrender Yamanaka Shikanosuke, but Yoshiharu and Hanbei know that he won't fulfill his promise and he is just waiting for the reinforcements of the Mōri clan to arrive. Yukinaga Konishi believes the last piece of benevolence he has in his person goes to his daughter Hideie. ; :Naoie's only daughter. She's the only one that treated Kanbei with kindness during her time as captive. She even helps Yoshiharu rescue Kanbei from her father, as she doesn't want him to lose the humanity he has left and become a \\"demon\\". ; :A Christian girl from Sakai that serves as bodyguard for Hideie under Naoie's orders, apparently because he wants his daughter to become a better ruler than he was. ; :Younger sister of Motoharu, she's a famous general known to keep her cool no matter the situation. She is an ally of Yoshiaki Ashikaga in her fight against Nobuna alongside her sister. She always tries to keep her sister Motoharu calm, and don't let her emotions get the best of her. The teachings of her father, Mōri Motonari, influenced her deeply and, just like Nobuna, she believes Japan must be unified and be able to compete with European countries. She feels curiosity whenever Nobuna will become a savior or a destroyer. ; :Older sister of Takakage, she is the Mōri Clan's number one leader when it comes to battles, and is nicknamed \\"The Valiant General\\". She is also an ally of Yoshiaki Ashikaga in her fight against Nobuna alongside her sister Takakage. She wishes to defeat Yamanaka Shikanosuke no matter what because of the humiliation she caused to the Mōri clan when she escaped their custody using the excuse of needing to go to the toilet to escape. Unlike Takakage, she isn't a very deep thinker and only wants to see how things will go through, so she has a deep trust in her sister. However, when she's not on the battlefield, she tends to fantasize with \\"beautiful generals\\", and Takakage compares her to a Fujoshi. ; :The Murakami Navy's leader, called \\"Pirate King\\", he's an ally of the Mori twins, despite remaining semi-independent. He was very close to Mōri Takamoto, Takakage and Motoharu's older brother and he sees himself as a protector for both sisters. His fame and prowess on the battlefield are so great that even Yoshitaka Kuki fears they will not be able to defeat him. Other characters ; : :The current Empress of Japan and direct descendant of Himiko, the first Empress of Japan. She has inherited psychic powers from her ancestor, thus gaining the ability to read a person's heart and mind by touching him or her.

The term is used to refer to the closely related group of phages including the f1, fd and M13 phages. The If1 and Ike phage are also closely related to this group. These phages undergo a non-lytic lifecycle, in which infected bacteria are not killed, but continuously release viral particles. This is in contrast to the lytic and lysogenic cycles of other phages where the host is killed when virions are released. The Ff phages have a circular ssDNA genome wrapped in a few thousand copies of the major coat protein to give a rod shaped viral particle that is capped on either end with two different sets of proteins. Only one end binds to the F pilus and can inject the DNA into the host cell. ==Life cycle== Adsorption and Infection Ff phages need the host cell to be Hfr or F+. When a virion binds to the sex pilus of a host by protein 3 in its beaded end, the pilus retracts and the virus fuses with the host membrane. Several host proteins are involved in this step and the genome of the virus is released into the bacterial cytoplasm. Early life cycle and plasmid maintenance The single stranded DNA of the virus is converted into double stranded DNA by the host machinery. This form is called the replicative form (RF). The strand which came from the virus (VS) is nicked by the viral protein p2 (pII). Host DNA replication machinery then replicates the VS in a rolling circle form of replication by extending the 3' end of the nick, pushing out the 5' end as a single strand. P2 chops off the strand each time its extension completes a full circle and ligates the single stranded copy into a circle. These ssDNA circles are converted to dsDNA like the original viral genome and the RFs accumulate in the cell. The RFs are transcribed and viral proteins accumulate. The RFs are passed on indefinitely to the daughter cells as plasmids. DNA packaging and viral release When sufficient copies of the RF and a viral protein p5 (pV / g5p) have formed, new ssDNA viral genomes get bound by p5 by interaction with a specific sequence on the DNA called the packing signal. This prevents its conversion to dsDNA. The interaction between the DNA and the p5 is weak except at the packing signal. The p5-DNA complex binds to a complex of viral and host proteins on the membrane. As the DNA is stripped of the p5, it is extruded across the membrane and wrapped in a helical casing of p8. == See also == Filamentous bacteriophage ==References== Category:Inoviridae ","title":"Ff phages"},{"id":"35226710","text":"Gervays may refer to: *Richard Gervays, MP *John Gervays ==See also== *Gervais (disambiguation) *Gervay ","title":"Gervays"},{"id":"35226716","text":"The 1983–84 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team represented Indiana University.

Over one billion people in developing countries have inadequate access to clean water. Barriers to addressing water problems in developing nations include poverty, climate change, and poor governance. The contamination of water still remains a huge problem because of the normalization of practices that pollute the quality of water bodies. In developing countries, open defecation still persists and the associated health risks that come with it such as cholera and malaria remain a nuisance, especially to the vulnerable, in most communities. In developing countries, it is estimated that diarrhea takes the lives of 1.5 million children every year, most of these under the age of five. Access to freshwater is unevenly distributed across the globe. As many as 2 billion people live in countries with significant water stress. Populations in developing countries attempt to access potable water from a variety of sources, such as groundwater, aquifers, or surface waters, which can be easily contaminated. Freshwater access is also constrained by insufficient wastewater and sewage treatment. Progress has been made over recent decades to improve water access, but billions still live in conditions with very limited access to consistent and clean drinking water. == Problems ==  Rising demand, availability and access  Woman washing at water's edge in Bangladeshi Village People need fresh water for survival, personal care, agriculture, industry, and commerce. The 2019 UN World Water Development report notes that about 4 billion people, representing nearly two- thirds of the world population, experience severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 IGO (CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO) license. With rising demand, the quality and supply of water diminishes. Water use has been increasing worldwide by about 1% per year since the 1980s. Global water demand is expected to continue increasing at a similar rate until 2050, accounting for an increase of 20-30% above 2019 usage levels. The steady rise in use has principally been led by surging demand in developing countries and emerging economies. Per capita water use in the majority of these countries remains far below water use in developed countries—they are merely catching up. Agriculture (including irrigation, livestock, and aquaculture) is by far the largest water consumer, accounting for 69% of annual water withdrawals globally. Agriculture's share of total water use is likely to fall in comparison with other sectors, but it will remain the largest user overall in terms of both withdrawal and consumption. Industry (including power generation) accounts for 19% and households for 12%. The scarcity of fresh water resources is an issue in arid regions around the world but is becoming more common due to overcommitment of resources. In the case of physical water scarcity, there is not enough water to meet demand. Dry regions do not have access to fresh water in lakes or rivers while access to groundwater is sometimes limited. Regions most affected by this type of water scarcity are Mexico, Northern and Southern Africa, the Middle East, India, and Northern China. Economic water scarcity applies to areas that lack the fiscal resources and/or human capacity to invest in water sources and meet local demand. Water is often only available to those who can pay for it or those in political power, leaving millions of the world's poorest without access. Regions most affected by this type of scarcity are portions of Central and South America, Central Africa, India, and Southeast Asia.  Contamination  After accounting for availability or access, water quality can reduce the amount of water for consumption, sanitation, agriculture, and industrial purposes. Acceptable water quality depends on its intended purpose: water that is unfit for human consumption could still be used in industrial or agriculture applications. Parts of the world are experiencing extensive deterioration of water quality, rendering the water unfit for agricultural or industrial use. For example, in China, 54% of the Hai River basin surface water is so polluted that it is considered un-usable. Safe water is one of the eight Millennium Development Goals: between 1990 and 2015 to \\"reduce by half the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation.\\" Even having access to an ‘improved water source’ does not guarantee the water's quality, as it could lack proper treatment and become contaminated during transport or home storage. A study by the World Health Organization (WHO) found that estimates of safe water could be overestimated if accounting for water quality, especially if the water sources were poorly maintained.Runoff from development along the river in Pune, India could contribute to reduced water quality. Specific contaminants of concern include unsafe levels of biological pollutants and chemical contaminants, including * metals, including iron and arsenic * organic matter * salts * viruses * bacteria * protozoa * parasites These contaminants can lead to debilitating or deadly water-borne diseases, such as fever, cholera, dysentery, diarrhea and others. UNICEF cites fecal contamination and high levels of naturally occurring arsenic and fluoride as two of the world's major water quality concerns. Approximately 71% of all illnesses in developing countries are caused by poor water and sanitation conditions. Worldwide, contaminated water leads to 4,000 diarrhea deaths a day in children under 5. UNICEF notes that non-harmful physical qualities of water, such as color, taste, and smell, could cause water to be perceived as poor quality and deemed un-usable by its intended users. Child standing next to a well pump in a Bangladeshi Village. Many such wells have naturally high levels of arsenic. The volume of contaminants can overwhelm an area's infrastructure or resources to treat and remove them. Cultural norms and governance structures can also contribute further reduction or water quality. Water quality in developing countries is often hampered by lack of or limited enforcement of: * emission standards * water quality standards * chemical controls * non-point source controls (e.g. agricultural runoff) * market based incentives for pollution control/water treatment * follow-up and legal enforcement * integration with other related concerns (solid waste management) * trans-boundary regulation on shared water bodies * environmental agency capacity (due to resources or lack of political will) * understanding/awareness of issues and laws Beyond human health and ecosystem health, water quality is important for various industries (such as power generation, metals, mining, and petroleum) which require high-quality water to operate. Less high quality water (either through contamination or physical water scarcity) could impact and limit the choices of technology available to developing countries. Reductions in water quality have the dual effect of not only increasing the water stress to industrial companies in these areas, but they typically also increase the pressure to improve the quality of the industrial wastewater. However, gaps in wastewater treatment (the amount of wastewater to be treated is greater than the amount that is actually treated) represent the most significant contribution to water pollution and water quality deterioration. In the majority of the developing world, most of the collected wastewater is returned to surface waters directly without treatment, reducing the water's quality. In China, only 38% of China's urban wastewater is treated, and although 91% of China's industrial waste water is treated, it still releases extensive toxins into the water supply. The amount of possible wastewater treatment can also be compromised by the networks required to bring the wastewater to the treatment plants. It is estimated that 15% of China's wastewater treatment facilities are not being used to capacity due to a limited pipe network to collect and transport wastewater. In São Paulo, Brazil, a lack of sanitation infrastructure results in the pollution of the majority of its water supply and forces the city to import over 50% of its water from outside watersheds. Polluted water increases a developing country's operating costs, as lower quality water is more expensive to treat. In Brazil, polluted water from the Guarapiranga Reservoir costs $0.43 per m3 to treat to usable quality, compared to only $0.10 per m3 for water coming from the Cantareira Mountains. == Improving water resources ==  Improving access  To address water scarcity, organizations focus on increasing the supply of fresh water, mitigating its demand, and enabling reuse and recycling. In 2011, the World Health Organization revised its Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality. This document, written for an audience of water and/or health regulators and policy-makers, is intended to aid in the development of national drinking water quality standards. The guidelines include health based targets, water safety plans, surveillance, and supporting information regarding the microbial, chemical, radiological, and acceptability aspects of common drinking water contaminants. In addition, the document offers guidance regarding the application of the drinking water quality guidelines in specific circumstances, including large buildings, emergencies and disasters, travelers, desalination systems, planes and ships, packaged drinking water, and food production. According to the WHO, \\"The most effective means of consistently ensuring the safety of a drinking-water supply is through the use of a comprehensive risk assessment and risk management approach that encompasses all steps in water supply from catchment to consumer. In these Guidelines, such approaches are called water safety plans (WSPs)\\". A WSP is a plan that will ensure the safety and acceptability of a drinking-water supply. The Water Safety Plan Manual, published in 2009 by the WHO and the International Water Association, offers guidance to water utilities (or similar entities) as they develop WSPs. This manual provides information to help water utilities to assess their water system, develop monitoring systems and procedures, manage their plan, carry out periodic review of the WSP, and to review the WSP following an incident. The WSP manual also includes three case studies drawn from WSP initiatives in three countries/regions. Alternative sources Utilizing wastewater from one process to be used in another process where lower-quality water is acceptable is one way to reduce the amount of wastewater pollution and simultaneously increase water supplies. Recycling and reuse techniques can include the reuse and treatment of wastewater from industrial plant wastewater or treated service water (from mining) for use in lower quality uses. Similarly, wastewater can be re-used in commercial buildings (e.g. in toilets) or for industrial applications (e.g. for industrial cooling).  Reducing water pollution  Despite the clear benefits of improving water sources (a WHO study showed a potential economic benefit of $3–34 USD for every $1 USD invested), aid for water improvements have declined from 1998 to 2008 and generally is less than is needed to meet the MDG targets. In addition to increasing funding resources towards water quality, many development plans stress the importance of improving policy, market and governance structures to implement, monitor and enforce water quality improvements. Reducing the amount of pollution emitted from both point and non-point sources represents a direct method to address the source of water quality challenges. Pollution reduction represents a more direct and low-cost method to improve water quality, compared to costly and extensive wastewater treatment improvements. Various policy measures and infrastructure systems could help limit water pollution in developing countries. These include: # Improved management, enforcement and regulation for pre-treatment of industrial and agricultural waste, including charges for pollution # Policies to reduce agricultural run-off or subsidies to improve the quality and reduce the quantity needed of water polluting agricultural inputs (e.g. fertilizers) # Limiting water abstraction during critical low flow periods to limit the concentration of pollutants # Strong and consistent political leadership on water # Land planning (e.g. locating industrial sites outside the city) == Drinking water treatment ==  Large Scale Water Treatment  Current technology enables us to solve this with a variety of solutions to increase the supply; we can convert non-freshwater to freshwater by treating water pollution. Much of water's physical pollution includes organisms, metals, acids, sediment, chemicals, waste, and nutrients. Water can be treated and purified into freshwater with limited or no constituents through certain processes. Common Large Scale Water Treatment Technologies: *Distillation - The processes of water distillation are solely defined by the similar processes of desalination units, thermal evaporation, and condensation. It involves the process of vaporization of a substance at determined boil to convert water from its liquid state into vapor then subsequently condense it back into liquid; separating itself from the initially concentrated particles and effluent. The same concept proceeds with any other type of contaminated water. This process provides consistent purified water that is separated from contaminants rather than directly filtered, yet has drawbacks on mechanical maintenance, costs on electricity, and concentrates with lower boiling points have to be filtered separate from the system. In water distillation, water is heated to its boiling point, resulting in condensation, and separates itself from any of its concentrated impurities, many of which are commonly chemical constituents of lead, copper, municipal fluoride, chlorine, and other minerals and chemicals. Distillers produce fresh water free of contaminants, along with some particle residue. Some of these particles are minerals ideal for the human body, making it viable drinking water. Distilled water is also utilized in common mechanical applications including the topping off of lead acid batteries capacity, non- corrosive cooling for heat exchange in systems such as jacket water in engines and automotive vehicles, or water-cooling systems in computers. Although it is ideal, as a result of molecular interactions between chemicals such as inter- molecular forces, most distillation systems lack actual 100.00% removal of unwanted constituents that may still be present, much of which is fluoride. In that, distillation is rather notable for its high energy consumption rates and is increasingly being replaced by current membrane technologies, specifically reverse osmosis (RO) membranes as RO's are more energy efficient for water desalination. *Reverse Osmosis - One of the popular commercial competitors with water distillation, which is commonly referred to as one of the main filtration methods, is reverse osmosis. Reverse osmosis membrane technology has been reliable and developed for about 50 years and is the leading technology for desalination today. Reverse osmosis is a biological process used for the removal of dissolved solids within water. By use of water pressure and a filter instead of chemical or mechanical systems, this particular water treatment system is more energy efficient than when compared to distillation. In the beginning of installation, reverse osmosis is known to be competitive with distillation in making purified water for human consumption. Reverse osmosis is done by filtration of effluent materials from the water molecules such as most dissolved salts, bacterium, organics, and common constituents like chlorine and fluoride via high pressured water. This pressured water is sent through a cross-filtration system that prevents build up between filters. These specialized filters are known as semipermeable membranes that only let particular molecules to travel through, allowing direct filtration of salt from seawater. Reverse osmosis systems use kinetic energy of incoming water pressure instead of electricity to allow the passage of the water through these filters, pushing out water and leaving the contaminants behind. On top of mitigating the energy costs, primary RO unit management is simple because the filters just need to be replaced on a yearly basis. On the adverse side, as a result of impermanence, the membranes can age with wear and tear on the pores, allowing some viruses, bacteria, pharmaceuticals, pesticides and other contaminants to pass through them.  Point of use and small scale treatment  Various innovations exist to effectively treat water at the point of use for human consumption. Studies have shown point of use treatment to reduce diarrhea mortality in children under 5 by 29%. Home water treatment solutions may not be widely considered in development strategies, as they are not recognized under the water supply indicator in the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals. Various challenges may reduce the effectiveness of home treatment solutions, such as low education, low-dedication to repair and replacement, or local repair services or parts are unavailable. Current point of use and small scale treatment technologies include: *NaDCC, sodium dichloroisocyanurate *Boiling water *Solar disinfection (SODIS) *Chlorine  Examples  = AQUAtap Community Drinking Water Stations = Quest Water Solutions’ AQUAtap Drinking Water Station is a simple system that uses solar power to purify contaminated groundwater, brackish water, or sea water into safe drinking water. The systems are powered by photovoltaic panels. Each Drinking Water Station is fully autonomous and can purify water at a rate of up to 20,000 litres per day without any existing infrastructure. They are also modular, so can be scaled for increased water purification. In addition, the system includes a distribution system. In 2012, Quest Water Solutions started construction of an AQUAtap Drinking Water System in Bom Jesus, an Angolan village 50 kilometers east of Luanda, the capital of Angola. The 500 residents of Bom Jesus currently rely on a dirty river for drinking water. The clean drinking water produced by the AQUAtap will be available to villagers at no cost to the villagers. = HydroPack = The HydroPack, developed by Hydration Technology Innovations (HTI), is a one-time use, self hydrating, emergency hydration pouch. Victims of natural disasters often struggle to find clean drinking water. Water sources and drinking water supplies are often contaminated during a disaster, so victims often suffer from water borne illnesses. The HydroPack is a 4-inch by 6-inch pouch filled with electrolytes and nutrients. When in contact with water, the HydroPack swells to create a healthy drink in 10 to 12 hours. \\"It doesn’t matter what the quality of water is like\\", says Keith Lampi, vice president and chief operating officer for HTI. \\"There just needs to be a source of water, even dirty or brackish water, and we can supply clean drinks at the initial stages of a disaster using the HydroPacks.\\" The HydroPack is a 12 fluid ounce (355 milliliter) pouch with two compartments that are separated by a membrane. One side of the pouch includes a sports drink syrup. The user places the pack in a water source for 10 to 12 hours. During that time untreated water diffuses across the membrane and dilutes the sports drink syrup. The HydroPack uses Forward Osmosis, a natural equilibrium process that rejects even the harshest of contaminants. The technology does not clog and can be used in very turbid water. The pouch includes a straw and the resulting nutrient drink is very palatable. According to HTI, \\"HTI's products are not meant to displace other bulk water strategies such as ROWPUs, municipal water systems, or shipboard desalination and bottling. Instead, they should play a very critical role in the early phase of disaster relief until other production and distribution strategies can be put in place.\\" This technology also reduces the weight of aide materials needed to be transported after a disaster. One pallet of 94,500 HydroPacks weighs 8,325 pounds (3,785 kg) and will produce 12,482 gallons (47,250 litres) of clean drink. This equates to about a 92% reduction in weight compared to bottled water. HydroPack were distributed to earthquake survivors in the tent city of Carrefour in Haiti in 2010. == Society and culture ==  Global programs   UN-Water  In 2003, the United Nations High Level Committee on Programmes created UN-Water, an inter-agency mechanism, \\"to add value to UN initiatives by fostering greater co-operation and information-sharing among existing UN agencies and outside partners.\\" UN-Water publishes communication materials for decision-makers that work directly with water issues and provides a platform for discussions regarding global water management. They also sponsor World Water Day (http://www.unwater.org/worldwaterday/index.html) on March 22 to focus attention on the importance of freshwater and sustainable freshwater management.  The Water Project  The Water Project, Inc is a non-profit organization that develops and implements sustainable water projects in Kenya, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Sudan, and Uganda. The Water Project has funded or completed over 250 projects that have helped over 125,000 people improve their access to clean water and sanitation.  ACP-EU Water Facility  Established in 2004, the ACP-EU Water Facility received money from the European Development Fund to sponsor projects that improve water quality and sanitation and improve water management governance in African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries. Central Asia Water and Energy Program (CAWEP)  CAWEP is a World Bank, European Union, Swiss & UK funded program to organize Central Asian governments on common water resources management through regional organizations, like the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS). == Country examples ==  India  India's growing population is putting a strain on the country's water resources. The country is classified as \\"water stressed\\" with a water availability of 1,000-1,700 m3/person/year. In 2008, 88% of the population had access and was using improved drinking water sources. \\"Improved drinking water source\\" is an ambiguous term, ranging in meaning from fully treated and 24-hour availability to merely being piped through the city and sporadically available. This is in part due to large inefficiencies in the water infrastructure in which up to 40% of water leaks out. In UNICEF's 2008 report, only 31% of the population had access and used improved sanitation facilities. A little more than half of the 16 million residents of New Delhi, the capital city, have access to this service. Every day, 950 million gallons of sewage flows from New Delhi into the Yamuna River without any significant forms of treatment. This river bubbles with methane and was found to have a fecal coliform count 10,000 times the safe limit for bathing. Surface water contamination, due to lack of sewage treatment and industrial discharge, makes groundwater increasingly exploited in many regions of India. This is aggravated by heavily subsidized energy costs for agriculture practices that make up roughly 80% of India's water resource demand. In India, 80% of the health issues come from waterborne diseases. Part of this challenge includes addressing the pollution of the Ganges (Ganga) river, which is home to about 400 million people. The river receives about over 1.3 billion litres of domestic waste, along with 260 million litres of industrial waste, run off from 6 million tons of fertilizers and 9,000 tons of pesticides used in agriculture, thousands of animal carcasses and several hundred human corpses released into the river every day for spiritual rebirth. Two-thirds of this waste is released into the river untreated.  Kenya  Kenya, a country of 36.6 million, struggles with a staggering population growth rate of 2.6% per year. This high population growth rate pushes Kenya's natural resources to the brink of total depletion. Much of the country has a severely arid climate, with a few areas enjoying rain and access to water resources. Deforestation and soil degradation have polluted surface water, and the government does not have the capacity to develop water treatment or distribution systems, leaving the vast majority of the country without access to water. This has exacerbated gender politics, as 74% of women must spend an average of 8 hours per day securing water for their families. The growing population and stagnant economy have exacerbated urban, suburban, and rural poverty. It also has aggravated the country's lack of access to clean drinking water which leaves most of the non-elite population suffering from disease. This leads to the crippling of Kenya's human capital. Private water companies have taken up the slack from Kenya's government, but the Kenyan government prevents them from moving into the poverty-stricken areas to avoid profiteering activities. Unfortunately, since Kenya's government also refuses to provide services, this leaves the disenfranchised with no options for obtaining clean water..  Bangladesh  Historically, water sources in Bangladesh came from surface water contaminated with bacteria. Drinking infected water resulted in infants and children suffering from acute gastrointestinal disease that led to a high mortality rate.Smith AH, Lingas EO, Rahman M. \\"Contamination of drinking-water by arsenic in Bangladesh: a public health emergency.\\" Bulletin of the World Health Organization. 2000, 78-87. During the 1970s, UNICEF worked with the Department of Public Health Engineering to install tube-wells. Tube-wells draw water from underground aquifers to provide a safe source of water for the nation. As of 2010, 67% of Bangladeshis had a permanent water source and a majority of them used tube wells. The wells consist of tubes 5 cm in diameter inserted less than 200 m into the ground and capped with an iron or steel hand pump. At that time, standard water testing procedures did not include arsenic testing. This lack of precaution led to one of the largest mass poisoning of a population because the ground water used for drinking was contaminated with arsenic.Khan AW et al. \\"Arsenic contamination in groundwater and its effect on human health with particular reference to Bangladesh.\\" Journal of Preventive and Social Medicine. 1997. 16, 65-73. Intervention measures such as awareness programs and the painting of tube-wells red if the water is above the government limit of 50 ppb arsenic (green otherwise) have been effective in preventing further poisoning. Available options for providing safe drinking water include deep wells, traditionally dug wells, treatment of surface water, and rainwater harvesting.Das NK, Sengupta SR. \\"Arsenicosis: Diagnosis and treatment.\\" Seminar: Chronic Arsenicosis in India. 2008. 74, 571-581. Between 2000 and 2009, more than 160,000 safe water devices have been installed in arsenic- affected regions of Bangladesh.http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/Arsenic_Mitigation_in_Bangladesh.pdf  Panama  Panama has a tropical climate and receives abundant rainfall (up to 3000mm per year), yet the country still suffers from limited water access and pollution. Intense El Niño periods reduce water availability. Rapid population growth in recent decades led to an unprecedented increase in freshwater demand. An estimated 7.5-31% of Panama’s population lives in isolated rural areas with minimal access to potable water and few sewage treatment facilities. Given the large quantities of rainfall, rainwater harvesting has been implemented as a solution to increase water access. Still, the rainwater is subject to pick up any substances on the rooftops that it runs over before entering a collection tank. Water quality tests revealed that the collected water often contains coliforms or fecal coliforms, likely from running through animal droppings on roofs. The Bocas del Toro province gets its water from a body of water named Big Creek. Although the water goes through a purification process, the treatment infrastructure was built to accommodate a much lower water demand than what is currently expected of it. Waterborne diseases are still a prominent problem for Bocas del Toro, with diarrhea, intestinal problems, and parasitosis being the leading causes for infant mortality in the province. ==See also== *List of water-related charities *WASH - Water, sanitation and hygiene ==References *UN  Water for Life Decade  Water Quality *akvo.org  Water and sanitation projects Category:Global environmental issues Category:Water and politics Category:Water supply Category:Sanitation ","title":"Water issues in developing countries"},{"id":"35226968","text":"Murai Maman is a 1995 Tamil language comedy film directed by newcomer Sundar C..

The tour started in August 2012, and ended in December 2013. ==Background== On March 26, 2012 Cohen announced the first eighteen concerts taking place in Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, France, Spain and Portugal forming part of the first European leg of the 'Old Ideas World Tour'. On April 2 two further concerts were added in Ghent due to high public demand and on April 4 it was announced that Cohen would perform a third concert for the same reason. It was revealed by the Telegraph newspaper that Cohen would perform his only UK show at the Hop Farm Country Farm in Kent in September. On May 17 a second concert at the Hop Farm Country Farm was announced for September 9. However, on August 23 both concerts would be moved to Wembley Arena in London, England, for unspecified reasons. First European Leg The first leg of the tour consisted of 31 shows, played all over Europe. The structure of each show was similar to the previous tour. The main set was split into two blocks with a short intermission in between. Many songs from the latest record were performed, most of them for the first time ever. \\"Darkness\\" (known as The Darkness on the previous tour) was the only song on the record that had been performed before this leg. \\"Amen\\", \\"Come Healing\\" and the aforementioned \\"Darkness\\" would become tour staples, played in every show on this leg. Other new songs that were performed more or less regular are \\"Going Home\\", \\"Different Sides\\", \\"Crazy to Love You\\", \\"Banjo\\" and \\"Anyhow\\". \\"Lullaby\\" and \\"Show Me the Place\\" remained the only two songs from the album not played on this leg. Apart from the new songs, some older songs made their way into the set, most notably the song Alexandra Leaving. It was performed in every show entirely by Sharon Robinson after a short introduction by Cohen. The song was preceded by the song Coming Back to You from the album Various Positions. It was performed in an acoustic version by the Webb Sisters, with Charlie and Hattie Webb taking over the vocals and instrumentation (harp and guitar). Both songs were not played on the previous tour. Other songs that were not performed on the previous tour were \\"I Can't Forget\\", \\"The Guests\\", and \\"Light As the Breeze\\" (performed for the first time ever). \\"Night Comes On\\" was played regularly on this leg of the tour after having only two outings on the previous tour. The concerts themselves were longer than the concerts at the beginning of the last tour. Opening night in Ghent for example featured 33 songs, with four encore blocks containing 9 songs. The concerts of this leg would often end close to or at curfew of the respective venues, with the last song often being \\"Save the Last Dance for Me\\", a song made famous by The Drifters. Overall, 40 different songs were performed on this leg. First North American leg The North American leg of the tour was announced via Cohen's official website on 3 May 2012. The first concerts to be announced were 11 in the United States and 10 in Canada. Cohen later announced second concerts in Montreal and Toronto due to increasing public demand. Soon after a second concerts were announced for Austin, Texas and Boston, Massachusetts. The concerts themselves followed the same structure as the first leg of the tours. Songs not performed in North America that were played in Europe were \\"Crazy to Love You\\" and \\"Light As the Breeze\\". Instead, a selection of other songs made their debut, including \\"Show Me the Place\\", leaving \\"Lullaby\\" as the only song from \\"Old Ideas\\" not played on this tour. \\"Going Home\\" became a concert staple, being played every night of this leg. Other songs that were played for the first time on this leg of the tour include \\"The Guests\\", \\"Joan of Arc\\" (both not played on the previous tour) as well as \\"Lover Lover Lover\\", \\"Chelsea Hotel #2\\" and the as-of-now unreleased \\"Feels So Good\\". This leg also featured a rare cover of George Dor's \\"La Manic\\", played in the Franco-Canadian part of the tour. Altogether, 46 different songs were performed at the 25 concerts of this leg. Second North American leg In January 2013, new dates for concerts in Canada and the United States were announced. The concerts were held in March and April, before the European Summer leg. The tour commenced after a two-month break, for another 21 shows in North America. Tour premieres in this leg of the tour included the song \\"Avalanche\\", while \\"Coming Back to You\\" was dropped from the setlists, after having received only little attention on the previous leg, in favor of \\"If It Be Your Will\\", a concert staple on the last tour. The Old Ideas songs \\"Anyhow\\" and \\"Show Me the Place\\" were featured in most shows on this leg, while \\"Different Sides\\" was only played twice. \\"Choices\\", made famous by George Jones was played in honor of his recent passing, making it the third cover version being played on this tour. 39 different songs were played on this leg of the tour. Second European leg In December 2012 the first dates for 2013 were announced with concerts to take place in Europe. Altogether, 32 shows have been announced. On his second run through Europe, Cohen revisited some of the larger cities, e.g. Amsterdam, Berlin, Dublin, London and Paris, but also included some new stops, including performances in Croatia, Czech Republic, Slovenia and Poland as well as Switzerland and Austria. Only two shows were open air, most of the performances were indoors at larger arenas. The shows themselves followed the structure of previous legs on this tour very closely, although noticeably shorter in length and with less songs performed. So featured the first concert in Berlin in 2012 29 songs and had to be cut short due to curfew constraints, whereas the second concert in 2013 featured only 26 songs, with a full length encore block. \\"Different Sides\\" and \\"Show Me the Place\\" went unplayed during this leg, which meant that the latter one has not been performed on Europe to this date. All three cover songs were played, with \\"Save the Last Dance for Me\\" being performed 16 times. \\"Avalanche\\", \\"Night Comes On\\" and \\"Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye\\" were rarities that received only little attention. The song \\"Anyhow\\" was performed at a few venues in the United Kingdom. A noticeable change in the setlist occurred during the early part of the leg when \\"Anthem\\" was dropped from the show. It had been a staple during the last tour and this tour until that point, having been performed at all shows, usually closing the first set. It was played only 6 times during the last 23 shows of this leg. Its place was taken over by the song \\"Lover Lover Lover\\". Similar to the last tour, Cohen presented a new song to his audience. \\"I've Got a Secret\\" had its debut at the second Dublin show, and has been performed twice more after that. It is described as an evolution of the song \\"Feels So Good\\", sharing some lines with the song. On this leg of the tour, 43 different songs have been performed. Australia/New Zealand leg On 29 July 2013 it was announced on Cohen's official page that the tour would continue in November and December with concerts in New Zealand and Australia. Additional concerts for Wellington, Sydney and Melbourne were announced a few weeks after. However, the Australian concerts of those concerts were rescheduled to smaller venues, indicating much slower ticket sales than anticipated. The last leg of the tour consisted of 16 concerts in both countries, including two open air shows for the \\"A Day On The Green\\" concert series. The setlist included \\"Anthem\\" again as the closing song of the first set at all concerts. Overall there was very little variation, with only 30 different songs being played (a standard setlist included between 25 and 28 songs). \\"In My Secret Life\\" was played on two occasions towards the beginning of the leg, as was the song \\"Waiting for the Miracle\\". The latter one re-appeared at the Wellington and Auckland concerts, though in a much different and 'darker' version as compared to the previous version that was played during this and last tour. The song \\"I've Got a Secret\\" was also played on a few occasions during the encores.

Guido Lauwaert (Knack) wrote about opening night \\"The 78-year-old poet and singer seems 50 years younger for the duration of the concert. What strikes me is a total lack of false feelings…\\". Bart Steenhaut (DeMorgen) gave high praise to the musicians and Cohen himself, saying \\"Everyone was given ample opportunity to solo, and both backup singer – Sharon Robinson and the British Webb Sisters – were handed Cohen songs which they could shine on. Cohen himself singing downright excellent, though his deep, almost otherworldly baritone had not much variation in the set, exactly why was it right that the ladies often introduced a different timbre, and the rest of the band – all virtuoso with an impressive track record – could demonstrate their skill.\\" Another reviewer (Robert Heller of Bloomberg Businessweek) states of the Berlin show in 2012 that \\"On record, Cohen has tended toward more spartan sounds, stripped back to just his voice and an acoustic guitar. Live, he has assembled an immaculate band. It plays with a manicured sweetness: A mandolin and violin add spice and color, a Hammond organ richness and depth. The Webb Sisters and Sharon Robinson provide luminous backing, careful arrangements making full use of each singer's tone.\\" Especially Cohen's appearance on stage found praise by many reviewers. Craig Jones of eGigs (UK) states of the concert at the Wembley Arena, \\"He may refer to himself on the self-deprecating Going Home as \\"a lazy bastard living in a suit\\", but Cohen is in fact quite the opposite. Just two weeks away from his 78th birthday, the fact that he is still able to deliver a three and a half hour set of intense beauty, melancholy and drama is quite a feat. He may be promoting ‘Old Ideas’, but still after all this time, those ideas remain the very best.\\". ==Songs performed== Source:http://www.setlist.fm/stats/albums/leonard-cohen- bd6d12a.html?tour=Old+Ideas+World+Tour/ ==Band== *Leonard Cohen – vocals, acoustic guitar, keyboard *Roscoe Beck – bass, musical director *Sharon Robinson – vocals *Rafael Gayol – drums, percussion *Neil Larsen – keyboards, accordion *Mitch Watkins – guitars *Javier Mas – laúd, bandurria, guitar *Alexandru Bublitchi – violin *Mike Scoble* – harmonica, tour manager The Webb Sisters: * Charley Webb – backing vocals, guitar * Hattie Webb – backing vocals, harp *Scoble only performs as a guest performer in one song, 'Darkness', though he has not appeared every night. ==References *LeonardCohen.com – Official website of Leonard Cohen *LeonardCohenFiles.com – Tour Guide Category:2012 concert tours Category:2013 concert tours Category:Leonard Cohen concert tours ","title":"Old Ideas World Tour"},{"id":"35226988","text":"Taphoxenus is a genus of beetles in the family Carabidae, containing the following species: * Taphoxenus alatavicus Semenov, 1908 * Taphoxenus cellarum Adams, 1817 * Taphoxenus cerberus Ganglbauer, 1905 * Taphoxenus gigas Fischer von Waldheim, 1823 * Taphoxenus goliath Faldermann, 1836 * Taphoxenus hauserianus Casale, 1988 * Taphoxenus persicus Jedlicka, 1952 * Taphoxenus transmontanus Semenov, 1908 * Taphoxenus trochanteratus Emdan, 1954 ==References== Category:Platyninae ","title":"Taphoxenus"},{"id":"35226994","text":"Nipponosynuchus abnormalis is a species of beetle in the family Carabidae, the only species in the genus Nipponosynuchus. ==References== Category:Platyninae ","title":"Nipponosynuchus"},{"id":"35227002","text":"Parabroscus is a genus of beetles in the family Carabidae, containing the following species: * Parabroscus teredai Habu, 1978 * Parabroscus crassipalpis Bates, 1873 ==References== Category:Platyninae ","title":"Parabroscus"},{"id":"35227023","text":"Aleksei Dressen (born 1968 in RigaDelfi: Dressen has been charged with working while under influence and losing his work ID) is a former Estonian Internal Security Service officer being charged with treason.Norman Aas: Possible traitor apprehended He is being charged with cooperating with Russian intelligence service FSB.

Stebnitsky. It has never been re-issued in its author's lifetime. In 1924 the novel was published in Leningrad by an editor and literary historian Pyotr Bykov in a different version and under the new title, Amour in LapotochkiLapotochtki (Russian, Лапоточки) – a small pair of lapti. subtitled: \\"An attempt at a peasant novel. The new, unpublished version.\\" This publication caused controversy and later its authenticity has been put to doubt. In the latter Soviet collections the original 1863 Leskov's text was used, all the editorial cuts and additions being mentioned in commentaries. ==Synopsis== Nastya, a quiet, shy and nice- looking peasant servant, strikes a friendship with Masha, the landlord's six- year-old daughter. Then disaster strikes: Nastya is to marry Grigory, an ugly half-wit with a reputation of a village idiot, the outrageous scheme being arranged between her own evil brother Kostik and his business partner Isay Prokudin, Grigory's father, desperately looking for an 'heir'. The marriage proves to be a tragic farce. For Nastya a long period of fierce mental and physical suffering follows. She tries to escape, gets retrieved, suffers from a mysterious mental condition people around her see as \\"possession\\" which promptly disappears as she finds herself in the home of Sila Ivanovich Krylushkin, an old man and a local herb-healer. Meanwhile, Grigory ventures for Ukraine to make money as a labourer, Nastya returns to Prokudin's house and slowly gets back to life, still feeling apathetic and unhappy. She meets Stepan, a good-looking peasant man, equally unhappy in his family life, who falls in love with her. She reciprocates. The two decide to run away, obtain false documents and head for the South aiming at Nikolayev, but get caught in Nezhin, a provincial Oryol Governorate town, and find themselves jailed. Nastya gives birth to a boy, who soon dies. As the pair is being transported back home, Stepan falls ill and lags behind, later to die of typhoid. Now raving mad, Nastya arrives back to the Prokudin house. Again Sila Krylushkin comes to help, giving the woman safe haven in his home where some of his patients are being kept. The house is raided by the police to investigate its owner's illegal healing practice. Nastya is sent to an asylum, escapes, lives in the local woods for some time, then, as the winter comes, is found frozen to death. The epilogue  The novel ends with a lengthy epilogue where the narrator (judging by some personal details, none other than Leskov himself) returns to the village of Gostomlh after five years' absence. He finds things changed here, some of them for the better, even if there's another melancholy note being struck by the news that lovely Masha, Nastya's little loyal friend, has died in the boarding house at the age of 12, of scarlet fever.The Works of N.S. Leskov in 6 volumes. Vol. 1. Pravda Publishers. Moscow, 1973. P. 232. Serfdom abolished, the atmosphere has changed (\\"People there became - not exactly happier, but showing more care, the former apathy's gone; they are busy talking about things among themselves\\"). Men's treatment of their women, though, remains the same. The author becomes a witness of an ugly scene: a woman gets flogged by a group of men just for \\"not showing enough respect\\" to her husband. Horrified, she pleads only to be punished by women, but the male community responds with good-natured laughter and, as afterwards she pronounces the humiliating \\"thank you for the lesson,\\" sincerely believe they've done a good job, only one of them mourning the fact that the team of punishers was not big enough. Another incident of the same kind takes place at the market square where a woman gets force-fed with a piece of soap she was trying to steal (\\"just to wash my baby's cloth,\\" she sobs). The author runs to a local policeman asking to stop the outrage, but the latter, treating the guest to his wine, remarks: \\"Come on, they sure know better. And what could I possibly do? They are self-governed nowadays.\\" \\"Self-government (samoupravle′nye) equals to self-handedness (samoupra′vstvo) in their minds,\\" the author bitterly comments. There's one thing that fills Leskov with unqualified delight, and that's the conversation with Misha, a 14-year-old brother to the late Masha. The teenager tells him about how different were now things in the gymnasium the author feared and hated. \\"Take our teacher of the Russian language, what a good soul he is, and how does he love common people,\\" Misha marvels. It turns out he, along with his classmates, volunteered to give lessons to peasant boys (who were \\"so respoding and so quick in learning!\\") In the end he recites to the elder guest the poem by Apollon Maykov, beginning with words: \\"Oh God! You give my motherland your warmth and bread, those sacred gifts of Heaven/ Please, dear God, impart to it some of your spiritual feeding, too...\\" \\"We firmly shook hands and kissed and parted as very good friends,\\" thus Leskov concludes the epilogue. ==The second version controversy== In the epilogue to his 1924 publication Pyotr Bykov wrote: According to Bykov, Leskov has presented him the manuscript as a gift, a sign of gratitude for the Bibliography of N.S. Leskov. Thirty years: 1860–1889 which Bykov compiled and also for the work he's done as an editor for the 1889 Complete Leskov edition. \\"I think it would be only fair to pass to you this re-worked version of The Life of a Peasant Woman which I renamed now into Amour in Lapotochki. Read this and do not judge me harsh. May be you'll be able to make use of it when better day for Russian peasants will come and there will be a renewed interest towards [this book],\\" Leskov has allegedly told him. The fact that Leskov indeed was going to make changes to his 1863 original text was indisputable, for he wrote of this very intention in his foreword to the 1867 collection called The Novelets, Sketches and Stories. It was there that he promised that the book's 2nd volume will feature \\"an attempt at a peasant novel\\" called Amour in Lapotochki. But this re-worked version of The Life of a Peasant Woman never materialized – neither in the Vol.2 of Stories by M.Stebnitsky (1869), nor in its 1873 re-issue or in the 1889 Complete Leskov. From Bykov's account it followed, though, that Leskov re- wrote his novel in the 1880s. The author's contemporaries insisted that such work could have been done much earlier, in the 1860s. Later scholars were doubting Bykov's tale in general as well as particular details of it, like that concerning the author's reading the original text (7 printer sheets) to his friends in one sitting – only to declare his intention to re-work it. It was only logical for Leskov to gather his friends to read them the new version of the text. The question why he's never published it (under the new title, which apparently appeared in 1867) remained unanswered. In the mid-20th century Soviet versions of Complete Leskov Bykov-published version has been ignored. In fact, the whereabouts of Bykov's manuscript by this time have been unknown, apparently it has been lost. Yet, the comparative analysis of the two texts has been made. Changes that Leskov has made, were mostly editorial cuts: he removed numerous descriptions and side-plots, like the whole story of Nastya's tender relations with (part 1, chapter 3), the anecdote about a bell being dragged uphill (part 1, chapter 4), the story of the newly-wed's journey to Nastya's landlord (part 1, chapter 5). It looked indeed as if Leskov was trying to make the piece look more like a traditional novel, removing sketch- like aberrations he deemed superfluous. A lengthy epilogue, describing the life of the villagers after the abolition of serfdom has been removed too; perhaps for the author it looked dated. One large piece of text has been added to the original one (part 1, chapter 8): it dealt with \\"strange feelings\\" Nastya has had on her way from the local smith's house back to that of Prokudin, - an obvious attempt to add psychological touch to the description of his heroine's mental condition. ==References * Житие одной бабы.

It runs from the R572 at Adrigole in County Cork to the R571 near Lauragh in County Kerry. It is a popular tourist route with the pass at an altitude of 300m giving panoramas towards Bantry Bay to the south-east and the Kenmare River to the north-west. The original track, called the Kerry Pass, was cut during the Great Famine as a poor relief public works project. It was renamed for Timothy Michael Healy, former Governor-General of the Irish Free State, who died in 1931 shortly after the road was improved. The name \\"Healy Pass\\" is now also applied to the pass itself, previously called Ballaghscart or Ballyscarta, anglicisations of , which remains its Irish name. == Famine Roads == Famine roads have been described as ‘a landscape legacy of often well-intentioned, but hopelessly misguided, initiatives’.Collins, Richard. ‘Famine and Landscape’. Secrets of the Irish Landscape. Eds. Matthew Jebb and Colm Crowley. Cork: Atrium, 2013. p210. They were part of a project initially conceived by Robert Peel’s Conservative government to improve infrastructure in Ireland and thereby strengthen the economy, while at the same time providing paid employment for those without other means of sustenance following the failure of the potato crop in 1845. The scheme was not executed as initially envisaged, and road improvement schemes predominated. Funding arrangements were ill-conceived. The treasury’s object was to have the schemes funded at county level, but there was also a ‘half- grant system’. Inevitably, this led to government officials suspecting landowners of lining their own pockets. Under Trevelyan’s stewardship from August 1846, ideology infused the administration of the relief works. He was determined to avoid the encouragement of what he saw as laziness in the workers and self-interest in the landed class. In order to achieve the former, he introduced payment by task rather than per diem, a scheme which was fraught with problems. To prevent landowners gaining from the work, the ‘reproductive’ benefit envisaged by Peel was abandoned. The Board of Works took sole charge and became an unwieldy bureaucracy. Lack of tools, the malnutrition of the workers, appalling weather in the winter/spring of 1846/7, starvation wages (which could be as little as threepence-halfpenny a day), delays in payment, official suspicion that local officers were not sufficiently draconian in minimising the numbers employed, and the fact that the schemes were not preventing the ever-increasing distress of the people eventually led to their abandonment. In October 1846, Denis McKennedy of County Cork died by the road on which he was working. He was owed two weeks’ wages. The Board of Works was found culpable of gross negligence leading to his starvation. This was not an isolated case.Donnelly, James S. Jr. The Great Irish Potato Famine. Stroud: Sutton, 2002 Famine roads have found their way into literature. Anthony Trollope’s narrator in Castle Richmond (1860), set in County Cork, found humour in the sight of ‘thirty or forty wretched-looking men […] clustered together in the dirt and slop and mud, on the brow of the hill, armed with such various tools as each was able to find. […] They were […] half-clad, discontented, with hungry eyes’ (201). The glib tone and racist disparagement with which he continues this description of coming upon a relief works party at the side of a remote hill can perhaps be explained by his genre and target English audience. Trollope makes a useful contribution to our understanding of the road-building schemes in action in his description of the arrival of the English ‘engineer’, for whom the workers have been waiting since assembling seven hours previously as instructed, before daybreak. The engineer, sent to direct the work, is ‘a very young fellow, still under one-and-twenty, beardless, light-haired, blue-eyed, and fresh from England’ (204). He doesn’t know where he is and sends the men home, noticing that they have no tools. Trollope, reflecting with irony on the ideology behind the scheme, tells us that no doubt the men will be put to work flattening the hill, and making the road impassable. ‘But the great object was gained; the men were fed, and were not fed by charity’ (205).Trollope, Anthony. Castle Richmond. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1989. In George Moore’s short story, A Play-House in the Waste, a priest reflects that ‘the policy of the Government […] from the first was that relief works should benefit nobody except the workers, and it is sometimes very difficult to think out a project for work that will be perfectly useless. Arches have been built on the top of hills, and roads that lead nowhere. […] I can tell you it is difficult to bring even starving men to engage on a road that leads nowhere’. In another story, A Letter to Rome, Moore returns to the same topic, a priest lamenting that the building of useless roads is ‘a wanton humiliation to the people’ (90).Moore, George.

Harman made her first screen appearance as Sasha during the episode broadcast on 31 August 2011. Harman decided to leave the show in 2014 and filmed her final scenes in October. Sasha made her official departure on 1 April 2015. Sasha was introduced as established character Sid Walker's (Robert Mammone) illegitimate daughter. Upon her mother's death, Sasha and her half-brother Felix Bezmel (Max Felice) were orphaned and Sasha had to move to Summer Bay. Sasha was initially \\"a rebellious and furious teenager\\". Harman described Sasha as being \\"sassy\\" and \\"angry\\", as well as having a stubborn streak. Shortly after her arrival, Sasha embarked on a relationship with Stu Henderson (Brenton Thwaites), which eventually turned abusive. Harman admitted that she was both scared and excited about taking on a domestic violence storyline. In February 2012, a whodunnit was formed when Stu was found dead. The Walker family soon became suspects and Sasha was bullied by a group of students led by Christy Clarke (Isabelle Cornish). Sasha soon confessed to killing Stu in self-defence when her father became the prime suspect. While on the rebound from Stu, Sasha began dating Xavier Austin (David Jones-Roberts). However, the age difference and timing soon caused them to break up and Sasha quickly developed feelings for Casey Braxton (Lincoln Younes). Sasha lost her virginity to Casey and also went through a pregnancy scare. After splitting from Casey, Sasha began dating Spencer Harrington (Andrew Morley). They initially kept the relationship a secret, so they did not hurt Spencer's ex-girlfriend and Sasha's close friend, Maddy Osborne (Kassandra Clementi). In the same year, Sasha befriended Rosie Prichard (Teri Haddy), who became obsessive with Sasha's company and almost caused them both to drown during a stunt to get Sasha's attention. The character of Sasha has been positively received by critics and Harman was nominated for the Most Popular New Female Talent Logie Award in 2012. ==Casting== Isabelle Cornish auditioned for the role of Sasha, however, it was actress Demi Harman who was eventually cast. Harman had not long been attending university and relocated from Brisbane to Sydney for filming. Receiving the role was Harman's \\"dream come true\\" and she fell in love with her character. While being interviewed by Holly Richards from The West Australian, Harman disclosed to her that the role forced changes in her and adjusting to them was \\"hell difficult\\". Harman made her debut screen appearance as Sasha during the episode first broadcast on 31 August 2011. ==Development== Characterisation Sasha is the illegitimate daughter of Sid Walker (Robert Mammone) and Regina Bezmel. On the serial's official website, Sasha is described as originally coming from \\"just another working class family\\" who were \\"battling along\\". However, the death of her mother leaves Sasha and her half-brother Felix Bezmel (Max Felice) orphaned. Sid meets Sasha a number of months after her mother's death because there is delay in the contact process. With \\"months of grieving, misery and building resentment\\" - Sasha becomes \\"a rebellious [and] furious teenager\\". She was also billed as \\"uncontrollable, naughty and independent\\". Harman said that liked her character's had a stubborn streak and that face that she is \\"sassy\\" and \\"angry\\". Sid was initially \\"just a means to an end\\" to Sasha because he played no part in her life. She was soon introduced to her older siblings Dexter (Charles Cottier) and Indigo Walker (Samara Weaving). Harman enjoyed working with her on-screen family and even came to think of Weaving as being her second sister. Sasha develops three romantic relationships during her first year in the series. Harman has stated that Sasha uses relationships as a method to convey that she is mature and grown up despite being sixteen. Domestic violence The serial used Sasha's relationship with Stu Henderson (Brenton Thwaites) to depict the issue of domestic violence. The actress told Erin Miller from TV Week that Sasha is \\"absolutely smitten\\" with Stu, despite Dexter's concerns. Sasha just begins dating Stu without carrying out any \\"groundwork\\" into who he is. There were no \\"warning signs\\" for her and it happened so rapidly that Sasha just \\"kind of fell into\\" the relationship. Harman added that he is \\"very protective\\" over Sasha, and went on to explain that he is jealous and does not want her to interact with other males. Lachie (Gig Clarke) begins text messaging Sasha and Stu becomes angry, the actress stated that Stu \\"tries to take Sasha's phone and he questions why she would be texting another guy\\" and subsequently hits her. Sasha decides to get advice from Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds), but does not tell her the full story. But Sasha decides to end their relationship. Stu then steals Xavier Austin's (David Jones-Roberts) car and forces Sasha to get into it. He threatens that he shall do something \\"extreme\\" if she does not forgive him. Harman said that \\"he is out of control and Sasha feels like she has no choice but to get in the car even, though she is scared.\\" Stu's anger issues are revealed to her at a \\"very fast rate\\" but there are \\"elements of ignorance\\" because she is not willing to accept the predicament. Harman opined that it could be \\"dangerous\\" for her character if she becomes embroiled in a cycle of forgiveness. One of the reasons she puts up with Stu is because she is not fully over the death of her mother. She concluded that it was a \\"disaster waiting to happen\\". The storyline later came to the centre of the serial. Harman told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that she was both scared and excited about taking on Sasha's domestic abuse storyline. The actress has anti-violence values and it was \\"really challenging\\" for her to portray - but she was grateful for the opportunity to play the victim. Harman researched the issue by visiting a range of anti-abuse blogs and websites such as White Ribbon and The Line. She also learned about the \\"psychology behind it\\". Harman explained that the story was \\"necessary\\" for Sasha's development and it subsequently scored positive feedback from the audience. There was also praise given to Home and Away for choosing to portray abuse within a teenage relationship. In various scenes the violence that Sasha endures from Stu becomes \\"quite heavy\\". Harman stated that she and Thwaites knew it was a \\"serious\\" issue and made an effort not to take both their character's state of minds home with them. Sasha is convinced that Stu will change and forgives him. Harman explained that \\"I think she reminds herself that as much as Stu hurts her, she genuinely loves him enough to want to help him stop doing what he's doing.\\" Sasha actually sees Stu's \\"true colours\\" from the first time he hurts her - but she does not do anything about it. She just carries on letting it happen until it begins happening in public. Harman felt that Sasha's denial was the most \\"frustrating part\\" of the scenario. She hoped that anyone in a similar situation to Sasha would seek help and tell someone. When her father, Sid learns the truth he attacks Stu in \\"intense\\" scenes. The actress revealed that some characters understand that Sid is trying to protect his daughter. But she added that \\"it does bring to light in the Summer Bay community the issue of trying to solve violence with violence.\\" Harman later revealed that the storyline had been her favourite so far because it was \\"epic\\". Discussing her character's future with a writer from Yahoo!7, she said that \\"a lot of people\\" wanted Sasha to grow up and Stu's behaviour would \\"greatly impact her in the future\\". Harman hoped that Sasha would eventually find a boyfriend who would treat her \\"right\\". Stu's death and bullying In the 2011 series finale, Sid is arrested for violently assaulting Stu in response to discovering his abuse towards Sasha. Harman later revealed that Stu's father Alan Henderson (Peter Phelps) would clash with Sid. In response to Stu's violence the Walker family \\"form a protective circle\\" around Sasha. In February 2012, it was announced that Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) would find Stu's body as the caravan park, sparking a whodunnit storyline. Because of Stu's \\"chequered history\\" the police believe that one of the local residents could be responsible for his death and Sasha's father Sid is the prime suspect due to the beating he gave Stu and the AVO that was taken out against him. A reporter from TV Week announced that the entire Walker family would become suspected of the murder when a bloodied shirt is discovered on their property. Luke Mitchell, who plays Romeo Smith revealed that the actual killer would confess. He added that the storyline would explore whether or not his death was accidental or premeditated. When her father become the prime suspect, Sasha decides to confess that she killed Stu. Mammone told Digital Spy's Kilkelly that Sid is quick to support Sasha because he believes it was an accident. He is \\"sad and disappointed in himself\\" because Sasha did not feel safe to trust him with her problems sooner. The family hire Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances) for legal support. Sid is frustrated with Sasha because her dishonesty gives the police reason to issue murder charges. Mammone explained \\"Demi is a lovely girl and a talented actress - she has handled this storyline like a veteran!\\" He concluded that Sasha's situation would worsen as students who liked Stu target Sasha. Shortly after it was announced that Isabelle Cornish had been cast as student Christy Clarke, who was good friends with Stu. Cornish explained that Christy had developed a crush on Stu and when she learned that he had died, she became determined to find out who was responsible. After Sasha admits that she killed Stu, Christy lashes out at her and Sasha finds herself victimised at school. Cornish revealed \\"Christy doesn't like Sasha. Her aim is to destroy her. She tries to get rid of her friends, bully her and make her uncomfortable.\\" The actress added that she had to make herself believe Sasha was a bad person and that she wanted her to feel unhappy. Harman explained that she found it easy to relate to Sasha's bullying storyline, as she herself was bullied at school. The actress said that Sasha does not cope with well with the bullying and it is \\"definitely a test of her strength and stability.\\" Relationships Xavier Austin In January 2012, a writer for TV Week observed that with sparks already flying between Sasha and Xavier, it looked like they would become Home and Away's newest couple over the coming months. Jones-Roberts agreed and stated that when Sasha first came to the Bay she and Xavier clashed nonstop. Xavier likes the \\"fiery\\" aspect of the girls he dates and tries to match them. Following Sid's arrest for Stu's murder, Sasha is taunted by some Summer Bay High students in the Diner and Xavier sticks up for her because he feels it is the right thing to do. Through this, Sasha and Xavier develop a friendship. The TV Week writer added \\"But because Sasha is quite strong- willed, this budding romance could take a while to develop.\\" Sasha also initially rejects him because she feels too \\"toxic\\" to begin a relationship. Sasha and Xavier's relationship eventually comes to an end. Harman told The West Australian's Richards that Sasha quickly got together with Xavier while on the rebound from Stu. She believed that Sasha loves him, but the age difference and Xavier not being ready cause the break up. Harman concluded that Sasha is left feeling bitter over Xavier and directly develops feelings for Casey Braxton (Lincoln Younes). The actress also told Susan Hill from the Daily Star that Sasha were more \\"big storylines\\" lined up for Sasha. Casey Braxton Lincoln Younes plays Sasha's third love interest, Casey Braxton. Harman told TV Week's Miller that she was shocked that her character would be interested in another River Boy, after what happened with Stu. The actress thought Casey was the good one out of the group, so that appealed to Sasha. Harman commented \\"I think she's had a bit of a bad run with Stu and then with Xavier not pulling his weight for her. But she's very keen on Casey because he's always been there and she hasn't really noticed him until now, so she becomes a bit curious.\\" Harman called the situation \\"the butterfly period\\" and explained that when Sasha is around Casey, she gets butterflies and then she wants more butterflies. Sasha and Casey become closer when she helps him with his feelings towards his incarcerated father, Danny (Andy McPhee). Sasha supports and encourages Casey, proving to be a loyal friend. Through this she slowly falls in love with him. Harman added that things between Sasha and Casey would not be smooth, saying \\"I think the upcoming stuff is all about Danny and Casey's issues, and he doesn't always treat Sasha the best way. She gets thrown around a little bit before she sees any good signs of him.\\" Sasha later loses her virginity to Casey, shortly after he is released from prison. She then believes that she may be pregnant. Harman said that she was shocked when she learned that a pregnancy storyline may be on the way for her character. She commented \\"I was reading the storyline and I was like, 'Oh my gosh!' I was extremely sad about the pregnancy. It's a terrible thing to happen to a 16-year-old. It would be so shocking. I wouldn't have known what to do [at that age]. I probably still wouldn't know what to do.\\" Sasha \\"feels unable\\" to talk to Casey, believing that he does not feel as strongly about her as she does him. Harman explained that the situation is awkward for Sasha because their night together meant more to her, plus Casey is in \\"a really bad headspace\\" with his upcoming court case. Sasha decides to confide in Natalie Davison (Catherine Mack), the school counsellor, because she trusts her. Spencer Harrington Following his break up with Maddy Osborne (Kassandra Clementi), Spencer Harrington (Andrew Morley) becomes attracted to Sasha and she feels the same way. It is not long before Dex and Indi notice it too. When Dex realises how much chemistry Sasha and Spencer share, he encourages Spencer to act on his feelings. Indi become aware of the situation when Sasha recommends Spencer for a job at her gym. Harman explained that Sasha's siblings want things to happen for Sasha, especially since she has had her fair share of heartbreak and \\"bad times with boys\\". Dex and Indi believe Spencer is eligible and they try everything to make him and Sasha admit their feelings for each other. When Spencer gets the gym job, he celebrates with Sasha and they start to realise that they are becoming something more than friends. However, they are hesitant to act on it, as they do not want to hurt Maddy. Sasha initially rejects Spencer's advances, but she eventually confesses her feelings for him. Spencer is suspicious at first, but realises that she is being genuine. Morley explained that Sasha does not want to jump in and get hurt like before, but Spencer realises that she is a sweet girl and that they are both unsure. When Sasha goes to walk away from Spencer, he kisses her. Morley quipped \\"It's a cute little scene, because they're both really honest with each other and go with their instincts.\\" The begin dating, but decide to keep the relationship to themselves at first, as they are worried about breaking the news to Maddy. Both Sasha and Spencer feel guilty and struggle to find the right time to tell her. Friendship with Rosie Prichard Teri Haddy played Sasha's friend Rosie. In January 2013, a new friend for Sasha arrived in the form of \\"sweet, but awkward\\" Rosie Prichard (Teri Haddy). Haddy revealed that Harman made her feel right at home on set and gave her a bug hug on her first day. Rosie had always lived in Summer Bay, but had never been seen on-screen before. Haddy called Rosie a bit of \\"a loner\\" and said that she looks up to Sasha. After Rosie becomes friends with Sasha, she is invited to a party at her house. Haddy explained that when Rosie learns that Sasha used to date Casey, she gets excited because, to her, he is like royalty in the Bay. Harman explained that Rosie would become \\"a bit obsessive about Sasha's company\\" and in trying prove that their friendship is genuine, she runs into the rough surf to get Sasha's attention. Rosie feels Sasha has not been taking enough notice of her. Rosie cannot swim and soon finds herself in trouble. Harman said that there is \\"huge danger\\" for the both of them, as the beach is not being patrolled and Sasha is not a confident swimmer. Sasha eventually becomes concerned for Rosie and she is forced to confront her fears and enter the surf to rescue her. However, both girls soon end up in danger when they become stuck in a rip. While filming the scenes, Harman and Haddy got stuck in a rip for real. Harman ended up getting dragged out further than Haddy and she called the experience scary, but felt safe as there were lifesavers on the beach. When Rosie was raped by fellow student Alexander Mullens (Louis McIntosh), she immediately turned to Sasha for help and support. Sasha proves to be \\"a tower of strength\\" for Rosie in the aftermath of her ordeal. Both girls are shocked when Mullens turns up at school and brags about being let go by the police. Seeing how much it is hurting Rosie, Sasha lashes out and punches Mullens in the face. Sasha finds herself in trouble and worries that Mullens might report her to the police for assault. Departure On 2 November 2014, it was confirmed that Harman had left Home and Away after three and a half years. She filmed her final scenes on 10 October. Of leaving, Harman commented, \\"Leading up to finishing was so traumatic, it was so scary. Letting go of something you have known and loved for three-and-a-half years was traumatic.\\" Sasha made her screen departure in mid-2015 and Harman hinted that her exit storyline would contain \\"tears, tears and more tears\\". ==Storylines== Following her mother's death, Sasha arrives in Summer Bay to live with her long-lost father Sid. He initially appears uncaring as he is forced to work shifts at the hospital. Sasha decides to seek employment with the aim of supporting herself and her half-brother Felix. Leah Patterson-Baker (Ada Nicodemou) offers Sasha a job at the Pier Diner. Felix runs away from his home and finds Sasha. When a storm passes through Summer Bay the pair take refuge in John Palmer's (Shane Withington) house. Sasha finds John has collapsed and she calls Sid, who sends an ambulance. Felix hides in the local school, while Sasha steals money from the Diner till. Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker) convinces Sasha to hand over the money and gives her a second chance. Sid asks Felix's father to let Felix move in with his family, but Felix's father refuses. Sasha begins dating Stu Henderson and Sid voices his disapproval, but later relents when he realises that Sasha will not stop seeing Stu. Sasha is delighted when Stu tells her he loves her. Stu later becomes angry when she does not reply to his texts. Sasha tries to explain herself, but Stu slaps her. He buys her a ring and apologises to convince her to stay with him. Sasha gets a tattoo for Stu, but he is unimpressed and slaps her in the face. She forgives him, but Stu slaps her again when she talks to another guy. Sasha attempts to give the ring back to Stu who becomes angry and steals Xavier's car. He insists that Sasha accompany him on a drive and successfully begs for another chance. Sasha's tattoo becomes infected and Xavier takes her to the hospital to be treated. Sasha tries to avoid Stu, but he begins to harass her via the telephone. While attending a Year 12 formal, Stu hassles Sasha and hits her once again. This time Sid witnesses the attack and he beats Stu up. Sasha reveals the truth about the abusive relationship and Stu's father, Alan, confronts Sasha about her accusations. Stu is later found dead and the Walker family become suspects. Sasha also becomes the victim of a bullying campaign. When Sid is named as the prime suspect, Sasha confesses to killing Stu in self-defence and the police are informed. However, they view it as a murder and press charges. She is later found innocent. Sasha has a brief romance with Xavier before turning her advances to Casey. She supports him through his many problems and they become good friends. As she spends more time with him she develops feelings for him and she loses her virginity to him. Sasha then has a pregnancy scare. When Tamara Kingsley (Kelly Paterniti) arrives in the Bay, Sasha finds herself competing for Casey's affections. He chooses Tamara, which leaves Sasha upset. Sasha befriends Rosie Prichard, but she soon becomes possessive. Rosie tries to gain Sasha's attention by running into the surf. While trying to help Rosie, Sasha nearly drowns in the process. Sasha then asks for space and Rosie refuses to speak to her. This hurts Sasha and she tries to make amends when Rosie befriends Mullens. Sasha and Spencer Harrington support Rosie when she is raped and the two grow close. They initially refuse to acknowledge their feelings, but soon begin dating. They try to keep the relationship a secret from Spencer's ex-girlfriend, Maddy, but she finds out and becomes jealous. Spencer's older brother, Chris (Johnny Ruffo), arrives in the Bay and Sasha does not get along with him, after he throws her in the sea. They eventually become friends when Spencer attacks Chris and she learns Spencer has bipolar disorder. Spencer joins a cult and when he cannot be persuaded to come home, Sasha asks Evelyn MacGuire (Philippa Northeast) to look out for him. She later becomes jealous of their closeness. Mangrove River High School is burnt down and some of the students are sent to Summer Bay High. Sasha does not get along with Matt Page (Alec Snow). After Dexter marries April Scott (Rhiannon Fish) and leaves for Paris, Sid tells Sasha that she must move to Broken Hill with him. However, wanting to stay in the Bay, Sasha moves in with Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger). Sasha, Irene, Chris and Spencer are held hostage by Sean Green (Khan Chittenden). He threatens Sasha and attempts to take her with him, but Chris saves her by tackling Sean. Sasha and Tamara compete for the school captain position. Matt also becomes involved and he and Tamara win. Sasha helps Matt with his speech and he kisses her. She rejects him as she is dating Spencer, but he later breaks up with her. Sasha grows closer to Matt when she learns that he is struggling to take care of his younger sister, Eloise (Darcey Wilson). Sasha convinces Matt to let Eloise go into care. Matt kisses Sasha again, but she rejects his advances. She finds him a place to live with Leah. Matt and Sasha later begin dating. Sasha writes an article about Oscar MacGuire (Jake Speer) hitting Tamara with a car. Evelyn blames Sasha when Oscar is arrested by the police and Matt comes to her defence, but embarrasses Sasha in the process. Matt apologises by Matt stripping off in public to embarrass himself. Sasha replaces Tamara as school captain. Matt and Sasha organise the year 12 formal and they consummate their relationship. Sasha learns Casey has died and she explains to Matt that she never forgave Casey for hurting her. Sasha tells Matt that she does not want him to end up like Casey and Matt comforts her. Sasha and Matt's relationship is strained when Matt's father, Gray (Craig Ball), arrives. He attacks Matt for letting Eloise go and threatens Sasha. Things become worse when Sasha thinks Matt cheated on her with Evelyn. Sasha learns that Matt is performing at Phoebe Nicholson's (Isabella Giovinazzo) music launch in the city and she joins other Summer Bay residents on a bus to the launch. The bus crashes, but Sasha only suffers minor injuries. She tries to save the bus driver, but he dies in her arms. Sasha gets into her preferred university and arranges to commute back to the Bay to see Matt every week, when he is forced to return to school. She spends her last night with Matt before leaving for university. Sasha returns early to surprise Matt and they spend the night in the diner. After missing her bus, Matt drives Sasha back to the city. Sasha returns after failing her first assignment. She and Matt break-up and Sasha leaves for good. ==Reception== For her portrayal of Sasha, Harman was nominated in the Most Popular New Female Talent category at the 2012 Logie Awards. Susan Hill from the Daily Star called Sasha a \\"wayward teen\\". A Daily Record reporter thought Sasha and Xavier were a \\"photogenic couple\\". Carena Crawford from All About Soap questioned whether a girl of Sasha's size could kill Stu and whether she was being truthful over the events. ==References * Sasha Bezmel at the Official AU Home and Away Website * Sasha Bezmel at the Official UK Home and Away Website Category:Home and Away characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2011 Category:Fictional waiting staff Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional domestic abuse victims Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas ","title":"Sasha Bezmel"},{"id":"35227316","text":"Directorate for Science and Technology may refer to: *Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Science & Technology *DHS Directorate for Science and Technology ==See also== *Department of Science and Technology (disambiguation) ","title":"Directorate for Science and Technology"},{"id":"35227324","text":"Orlando's Firestone building, now a club A second view The Firestone Building is a historic building constructed in 1929 in downtown Orlando.

The race marks the final career podium for Greg Moore, who finished third. == Report ==  Race  Championship leader Juan Pablo Montoya took his fifth pole of the season, and he dominated the early stages of the race, rapidly building a 6-second lead. Paul Tracy ran second early on, although it did not last for long as his teammate Dario Franchitti passed him. Franchitti was able to pull away from Tracy, but had no answer for Montoya, whose lead was up to 10 seconds before a caution caused by a coming together between Robby Gordon and Jan Magnussen triggered the first round of pitstops, during with the top 3 remained unchanged. Montoya continued to dominate once the green flag was brought out, although a miscommunication meant that he did not enter the pits when another caution period caused by Memo Gidley's car failing. The other drivers were all able to make their second stops and effectively gained a free pitstop on him. Montoya stayed out in an attempt to get as big a lead as possible once the track went green. He built a lead of 15 seconds before he made his pitstop, but rejoined only eighth, as Franchitti was handed the lead. Franchitti, despite more caution periods, went on to win the race ahead of teammate Tracy in another Team Green 1-2, with Greg Moore taking the final spot on the podium. The win handed Franchitti the championship lead as well, as Montoya was taken out of the race by Hélio Castro-Neves after the latter misjudged a restart attempt. == Classification ==  Race  {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" - !

They finished the season 2–9, 2–6 in Big Sky play to finish in a tie for 11th place. ==Before the season== 2012 recruits Spring Game The Weber State Purple and White 2012 Spring game was held on April 13, 2012. The match featured the Weber offense against the Weber defense. The game would start 20 minutes late due to a lightning delay. Once the lightning ended though, it was the defense that struck down Weber offense. The defense picked Weber's QB's four times, two coming from redshirt freshman Roman Venezuela. The offense would score four touchdowns against Weber's D over roughly 110-plays, but it was the defense that controlled the game according to the coaches. ==ScheduleGame summaries== Fresno State Sources: To open the season Weber faces another team with a new coaching staff. The match against Fresno State will be the Bulldogs coaching debut for Tim DeRuyter and will be only his second game as head coach overall. \\\\---- BYU {  - align=\\"center\\" ! Overall record !

The history of Sino-Korean relations dates back to prehistoric times. == Han and Gojoseon == According to Samguk Yusa, Wanggeom Joseon (Dangun Joseon) was the first country that represented Korean cultural identity. Although controversial, a legend tells that around 1100 BC a sage named Gija and his intellectuals fled from Shang Dynasty to avoid political turmoil and sought asylum in Gojoseon, and active cultural trades ensued after. In 194 BC, Wiman, a general from Yan State, sought refugee along with Yan immigrants in Gojoseon, and he was given a duty to guard borders in Liaodong. Wiman eventually became a leader of new immigrants and indigenous population, which led him to usurp the throne of King Jun. The expanding military might of Wiman Joseon soon threatened Han China, and the diplomatic relationship between the two countries deteriorated quickly. The Gojoseon–Han War occurred in 109 BC, resulting in the defeat of Gojoseon and the establishment of the Four Commanderies of Han. Chinese control over its northeast frontier and northern Korea provoked unity among the local tribes and indigenous population, resulting in the establishment of Goguryeo of Korea, which took advantage of Chinese conflict with the Xiongnu to expand into the Liaodong Peninsula. Goguryeo eventually reconquered the former territories of Gojoseon and kept expanding in all directions. == Cao Wei and Goguryeo == In 238, Sima Yi of Cao Wei led a successful campaign against his rival Gongsun Yuan, with the aid of Goguryeo. This led to the Chinese recapture of Liaodong as well as establishing great contacts with the Korean kingdoms. By 242, the alliance between Cao Wei and Goguryeo broke down when Dongcheon of Goguryeo initiated a raid into Wei territory. In response, the Goguryeo–Wei War erupted in 244, ending with the sacking of the Goguryeo capital and resettlement of many of its inhabitants. 15 years later Goguryeo defeated Wei at Yangmaenggok. The Xianbei-ruled Former Yan dynasty sacked the Goguryeo capital and made the king pay tribute. However, Goguryeo triumphed over the Xianbei decades later when Gwanggaeto the Great defeated Later Yan and conquered Liaodong and most of Manchuria. == Sui, Tang, Goguryeo, Balhae == Sui Dynasty launched four unsuccessful campaigns to subdue Goguryeo. Emperor Yang of Sui wanted to set order in East Asia after unifying various states and kingdoms within China proper. Goguryeo opposed this and started to prepare for defense against Sui Dynasty. A series of invasions from Sui took place in year 598, 612, 613, and 614. In the Battle of Salsu River, Goguryeo general Eulji Mundeok and his army inflicted tremendous damage on the army of Sui, where only 2,700 survived out of 300,000 men. Sui, out of exhaustion, disintegrated soon after. Goguryeo also engaged in many wars with Tang Dynasty of China, but it eventually lost as Silla, another Korean kingdom, took side with Tang instead in Goguryeo - Tang War. Later, Tang China rather saw the kingdom of Balhae, a successor state to Goguryeo, as a tributary state, whereas Balhae strongly opposed such view. As the Emperor of China saw himself as the emperor of the entire civilized world, it was not possible for such an emperor to have equal diplomatic relations with any other regional powers, and as such all diplomatic relations in the region were construed by the Chinese as tributary regardless of the intention of those regions. == Liao, Jin and Goryeo == During this time North China was ruled by the Khitan-ruled Liao Dynasty followed by the Jurchen-ruled Jin Dynasty. Goryeo triumphed over the Liao Dynasty in early 11th century and stalemated the Jin Dynasty in early 12th century. Goryeo paid tribute to maintain friendly relations and trade. == Mongol invasions == During the 13th century, the Mongol Empire invaded China and defeated the Jin and Song dynasties, eventually establishing the Yuan dynasty in 1271 under Kublai Khan. During the period of 1231–1259, the Mongol led Yuan Dynasty invaded Korea, ultimately resulting in the capitulation of Goryeo and becoming a tributary state of the Yuan Dynasty for 86 years until achieving its independence in 1356. The Yuan Dynasty eventually fell in 1368 and King Gongmin of Goryeo expanded its northern territory. == Ming and Joseon == Ming dynasty China shared a close trade and diplomatic relationship with Joseon Dynasty Korea. Both dynasties emerged from Mongol rule and shared Confucian ideals in society. Ming China assisted Joseon Korea during Toyotomi Hideyoshi's invasion of Korea, in which the Wanli Emperor sent a total of 221,500 troops. == Qing and Joseon, and Korean Empire == Under Emperor Hong Taiji, the Manchuria-based Qing dynasty invaded Korea twice, in 1627 and 1636. Following the Second Manchu invasion of Korea, the Qing claimed victory and forced Injo of Joseon into submission, severing its relations with the collapsing Ming dynasty, which eventually fell in 1644. Qing China's national strength gradually declined after its defeat in the First and Second Opium Wars. As such, China was forced to sign a series of concessions and \\"unequal treaties\\" with the Western powers. At the same time, the Meiji Restoration occurred in Japan and led to the rise of the Empire of Japan, which gradually expanded its military power. The Donghak Peasant Revolution of Korea in 1894 became a catalyst for the First Sino-Japanese War, which saw the defeat of the Qing military. As part of the terms in the post-war Treaty of Shimonoseki, China recognized the independence of Korea and ceased its tributary relations as well as Japan annexing the island of Taiwan (Formosa). The Korean Empire established modern diplomatic relationship with Qing, but Korea was eventually annexed, against their will, by Japan under the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910. == Republic of China and Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea == The anti-Japanese March 1st Movement protests erupted in Korea in 1919. Shortly after, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was established as a government in exile, based in Shanghai, with Syngman Rhee serving as its first president with its subsequent recognition by the Republic of China. They coordinated the armed resistance against the Japanese imperial army during the 1920s and 1930s, including the Battle of Qingshanli in October 1920 and Yoon Bong-Gil's assassination of Japanese officers in Shanghai in April 1932. The Provisional Government received modest recognition by the Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang regime in China. Following the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the fall of Shanghai, the Korean Provisional Government relocated to Chongqing, where it formed the Korean Liberation Army (KLA) in 1941. The hundreds-strong KLA engaged in guerrilla warfare actions against the Japanese throughout the Asian theater of war until Japanese surrender in 1945. The Republic of China was one of the participants of the Cairo Conference, which resulted in the Cairo Declaration. One of the main purposes of the Cairo Declaration was to create an independent Korea, free from Japanese Colonial Rule and restoration of Formosa and Manchuria to China. == Cultural relations == The Chinese character system, known as Hanja in Korean, was introduced into Korea through the spread of Buddhism during the Tang Dynasty. Hanja was used as the sole means of writing Korean until Sejong the Great promoted the invention of Hangul during the 15th century. Confucianism also became a fundamental part of Korean society, rising into prominence under Goryeo and prospered under the Joseon Dynasty. Examples included civil service examinations, known as gwageo, and educational institutions (gukjagam and sungkyunkwan), promoting the studies of Chinese classical texts. Since the nine years of Emperor Guangzong (958)of Song, he has followed the imperial examination system of the Tang Dynasty in China and established his own imperial examination system. Shuangji was a Chinese scholar. Emperor Guangzong appreciate his talent and admired the regular verse and rhythm in Tang verse, thus he started to adopt the examination system and fully adopt Confucian examination content and the Chinese writing system.So later he also be dispatched by Emperor Guangzong as an official ambassador to Korea, and delivered these system and culture to Korea. The Koryŏ dynasty, which lasted nearly 500 years, in fact, so its civilization exam system was actually a combination among the different type of imperial examination system the Tang, Five Dynasties, Song, and Yuan dynasties. The imperial examination system implemented by China was introduced into Korea, which was not only inseparable from the close exchanges and deepening commercial relations between the two countries, but also had an important relationship with the ruling class of Korea at that time. The reason why the imperial examination system became popular in Korea was because of the strong support and advocacy of the Korean government at the time. The imperial examination system is in line with the idea of the ruling class to manage the country, incorporates the idea of self- development in Korea, encourages more Korean scholars and intellectuals to safeguard the interests of the Korean ruling government, and has caused the pursuit of equality in Korean culture and academic excellence of booming thought. The thought process made people, even generals, like to write something to express their ideas. That is why in that period, at beginning, the sijo is only to be written by yangban, who went through a long and difficult process of education, but in the later period, there were many anonymous sijos to come out. Instead of using Chinese words, they used their own language and made it with more mordane but with a deep heart-touched sijo. The adoption of the civil service examination system is first helpful for the emperor to regulate the country and pick up the talented people, but then it transits into the path that made people’s minds free. No more could they only obey rules, but try to battle the constriction of a hard language, be creative, active, and likely to express themselves. ==See also== *PRC-North Korea relations *PRC-South Korea relations *ROC-South Korea relations == Notes  References == * * Alston, Dane. 2008. “Emperor and Emissary: The Hongwu Emperor, Kwŏn Kŭn, and the Poetry of Late Fourteenth Century Diplomacy”.

It brings together practitioners and representatives of industry in the region, particularly those involved in maritime and port services, undersea exploration, offshore oil and gas projects and associated infrastructure. Because these sectors are closely linked to rapid growth in economic development and trade in the region, it is expected hydrography will have an increasingly important role in the future development of the economy. ==History== The Australasian Hydrographic Society was originally part of The Hydrographic Society (THS), founded in 1972. It was one of five autonomous national branches, Australasia, the Benelux countries, Denmark, the UK and the USA. By 2000 it apparent that this structure was no longer workable and a decision was made to form national bodies, which would constitute a new international organisation, the International Federation of Hydrographic Societies (IFHS)]. Subsequently the Australasian Hydrographic Society was incorporated on 5 August 2002 and is now a registered a not-for-profit Public Company with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. ==Role of hydrography and related sciences in the region== Hydrography is essential for many economic, recreational and tourism activities. In particular the development of offshore projects in the oil and gas industries, particularly off the north west coast of Western Australia and coal export facilities in Queensland have required a considerable increase in the provision of accurate and up to date hydrographic information. The attendant increase in trade, for example, has made improved navigation through sensitive area, such as the Great Barrier Reef critical. Hydrography also plays an important role in national security, border protection and humanitarian support. The Australasian Hydrographic Society endeavours to represent all interests in these domains. The Australasian Hydrographic Society consequently \\"aims to serve anyone with an interest in the science (and art)\\" of hydrography, \\"the influence of which makes it the great common denominator for maritime nations\\".Alec Millett, President of the Australasian Hydrographic Society, Address to Hydro 2011 conference AHS Patron, Vice Admiral Chris Ritchie AO RANR (left) presenting award at Hydro 2011 ==Structure== The Australasian Hydrographic Society has four regions, the East Australia Region, the West Australia Region, the New Zealand Region, AOTM Australia on the Map Division and a South West Pacific Region. Each region is geographically based, except for the Australia on the Map Division which has a transnational focus on hydrographic history and heritage. The Australasian Hydrographic Society has a Council made up of elected officer-bearers (President, Secretary, Treasurer) and representatives from each of the regions. The Council is responsible for the governance of the organisation. The Patron of the Australasian Hydrographic Society is Vice Admiral Chris Ritchie AO RANR. The Australasian Hydrographic Society is a member of the International Federation of Hydrographic Societies. ==Activities== The Australasian Hydrographic Society regions engage in a wide range of activities. These include technical meetings, seminars, symposia, preparation of reports, social gatherings, educational initiatives and awareness-raising. The Society is also actively engaged in the development of international standards and protocols in hydrography, hydrographic surveying and technical specifications. The Australasian Hydrographic Society has an online presence through its website. The New Zealand Region and Australia on the Map Division also maintain separate websites. The New Zealand Region previously issued a newsletter, The Boustrophedon, and the Australia on the Map Division currently produces an electronic newsletter, Map Matters. Divisions may from time to time produce specialist publications. The Australia on the Map Division, for example, recently published the proceedings of a symposium, The Freycinet Map of 1811.Gerritsen, King and Eliason 2012 Hydro conferences The Australasian Hydrographic Society actively participates in the International Federation of Hydrographic Societies and has hosted that organisation's annual international conference on three occasions, Hydro 2003 (Christchurch, New Zealand), Hydro 2007Hornsby and Maschke 2008 (Cairns, Australia) and Hydro 2011 (Fremantle, Australia). ==Awards== The Australasian Hydrographic Society provides an annual Education Award for students studying in a range of hydrographic and hydrography related disciplines. The Australasian Hydrographic Society Awards, awarded annually, recognises the merit, contribution and achievement made by individuals, groups and corporate bodies in a range of categories. ==NotesReferences== *Hornsby, P. and Maschke, J.

A career fighter pilot, he served in the Korean War, the Cold War and the Vietnam War. ==Background== Cherry was born March 24, 1928, in Suffolk, Virginia into a poor farming family. He attended racially segregated public schools there. In 1951, Cherry graduated from Virginia Union University in Richmond, Virginia. ==Military career== On June 29, 1951, after his college graduation, Cherry enlisted in the Aviation Cadet Training Program of the U.S. Air Force, and was commissioned a second lieutenant. He was awarded his pilot wings at Webb Air Force Base in Texas on October 25, 1952. Korean War Cherry was soon serving in the Korean War, where he flew F-84 Thunderjets on more than 100 combat missions, with the 58th Fighter-Bomber Wing, which was stationed at Taegu Air Base in South Korea Vietnam War During a combat mission on October 22, 1965, Cherry's F-105 Thunderchief fighter-bomber was shot down over North Vietnam. Cherry ejected and landed with a broken ankle and wrist, and a crushed shoulder. He was immediately captured by North Vietnamese militia. Cherry was the first and highest ranking black officer among U.S. Prisoners of War during the Vietnam War. According to Cherry, his North Vietnamese captors wanted him to make public statements about racial intolerance in the United States, but he refused. As a result, Cherry spent 702 days in solitary confinement and was tortured or placed in punishment for 93 days in a row. Cherry's jailers placed U.S. pilot Ensign Porter Halyburton, a Southern white man, in Cherry's cell in the hopes that the two men would become antagonists. Instead, the two pilots helped each other to survive confinement and became very good friends. After seven years as a prisoner of war, Cherry was released from captivity on February 12, 1973. Cherry told the story of his POW's experience to Wallace Terry. Later career in Air force After returning home, Cherry discovered that his wife, Shirley Brown, had taken all of his life savings after the Air Force declared him missing in action and started dating another man. Cherry started legal proceedings with the Air Force to have back salary and other payments returned to him. After Vietnam, Cherry attended the National War College and was assigned to the Defense Intelligence Agency. He retired from the Air Force with over 30 years of service on 1 September 1981. ==Later life== In 1982, the United States Court of Claims found the Air Force negligent in handling Cherry's military pay and awarded him $38,449 in compensation. At the time of the award, Cherry stated that he would contest the decision, saying that he wanted more of the $129,000 that his wife had received from the Air Force. Following his retirement from active duty, President Ronald Reagan commissioned Cherry to serve on the Korean War Veterans Memorial Advisory Board. Cherry also served as the Director of Technical Support Services for E.H. White & Co. and as Marketing Manager for Data Transformation Corp. Most recently, Cherry has served as Chief Executive Officer for Cherry Engineering and Support Services, and as Director of SilverStar Consulting. ==Death== Cherry died of cardiac disease on February 16, 2016 at a hospital in Washington, D.C.

Although it is not the Philippines' first Chinese-language newspaper, it is the Philippines' oldest existing Chinese-language newspaper, and the country's third-oldest existing newspaper overall. ==History== The Chinese Commercial News was founded in October 1919 as the Huachiao Commercial News (), a monthly newsletter for the Manila Chinese Chamber of Commerce, then headed by Dee Cheng Chuan, with Yu Yi Tung (于以同) as the newspaper's first editor. The newspaper was founded because in the aftermath of World War I, the Philippines, then a colony of the United States, experienced rapid economic growth, which precipitated the need for a newspaper which would monitor the country's latest business developments for the large Chinese Filipino merchant class. Its first issue was published on Christmas Day, December 25, 1919. In February 1922, the last monthly newsletter was published, and the Commercial News became a daily newspaper two months later, when ownership of the newspaper was transferred to the newly established Chinese Commercial News Publishing Company (華僑商報出版公司), established by Go Ki Hoc (吳紀霍). Its initial print run consisted of two pages and a circulation of one thousand copies, with foreign and local news translated from local English newspapers. In 1927, the Commercial News became the first Chinese newspaper to print a pictorial, and it began printing a weekly magazine in 1933. Production of the newspaper was interrupted during World War II: refusing to publish the Commercial News as a propaganda organ for the Japanese, Yu Yi Tung was executed and the newspaper shut down. The newspaper, however, restarted publication on April 15, 1945, despite the lack of resources, by Yu Yi Tung's children: Quintin Yu Tiong Seng (于長城), Rizal Yu Tiong Keng (于長庚), Helen Yu Un Hui (于茵慧) and Yu Tiong Nay (于長籟), and continued publishing until the issuance of Proclamation № 1081 on September 21, 1972, which placed the Philippines under martial law and all media outlets, including the Commercial News, were shut down by the regime of Ferdinand Marcos. The Yuyitung family restarted publication of the newspaper after the People Power Revolution on June 12, 1986: the only pre- martial law Chinese-language newspaper to do so. The Commercial News launched its website in 1995, becoming one of the first Chinese newspapers to be available on the Internet. ==Editorial policy== The editorial policy of the Chinese Commercial News revolves around a ten-point mission of the newspaper as elaborated upon by Yu Yi Tung in 1922: *Coordinate Chinese organizations *Expand overseas business *Develop business investments in China *Disseminate business knowledge *Report business news *Improve relationship with the local community *Eliminate the class difference between capital and labor *Provide leadership for the Chinese community *Encourage the improvement of education for the local Chinese *Support political reforms in China In the 1960s, the Commercial News advocated for the assimilation of Chinese Filipinos into the wider Filipino community and Philippine recognition of the People's Republic of China. This angered Chinese Filipinos sympathetic to Taiwan, who viewed residence in the Philippines and the acquisition of Filipino citizenship as a convenience while awaiting return to mainland China. This advocacy led to the clandestine arrest of both Quintin and Rizal Yuyitung and their deportation to Taiwan in 1970 by the anti-communist Marcos government. Ironically, Marcos followed through on the advocacy of the Commercial News, even extending diplomatic recognition to the PRC in 1975. ==References *Chinese Commercial News website Category:National newspapers published in the Philippines Category:Newspapers published in Metro Manila Category:Chinese- language newspapers (Traditional Chinese) Category:Companies based in Manila Category:Daily newspapers published in the Philippines ","title":"Chinese Commercial News"},{"id":"35227708","text":"Gil Duran is the California opinion editor for The Sacramento Bee and the former press secretary for California governor Jerry Brown.

This necessitates planning, monitoring, management and information about logistics and manufacturing processes throughout the value chain. The goal of management accounting in supply chains is optimizing these processes. This strategy focuses on supporting management. == Overview == As value chains become more complex due to globalization, supply chain management (SCM) has become increasingly relevant in theory and practice. SCM encompasses extensive management-control tasks. This range of subjects is summarized by the definition of supply-chain controlling. The transfer of existing management control systems (MCM) to the SCM is insufficient because these primarily aim at internal (company) needs. Beyond past-oriented, financial figures there must also be future-oriented measurement; a number of approaches exist in the literature. == Definition == Supply-chain management (SCM) has become increasingly relevant in theory and practice in light of more-complex supply chains. The SCM performs extensive operational tasks, including supply-chain controlling. SeuringSeuring, S. (2006): \\"Supply chain controlling: summarizing recent developments in German literature\\", in: Supply Chain Management, 11/1 (2006), P. 10-14. transfers the three main concepts of German supply chain-controlling literature into the specific demands of SCM: {  + Supply-chain controlling concept - ! Criteria !! Rationality-oriented !! Coordination-oriented !! Information-oriented -  Specific problem  Ensuring rationality of supply- chain management  Assuring and maintaining coordination and flexibility in supply chain management  Decision-related information -  Direct controlling objective  Balancing task-related and staff-related bottlenecks  System building and coordination of planning and control and providing information throughout the supply chain  Implementing of supply-chain-wide information systems Providing problem-specific information to all participants in the supply chain -  Indirect controlling objective  Performance- objective system  Profit (efficiency, short- and long-term profit) Profit and liquidity objectives } The rationality-oriented approach of supply-chain controlling coordinates all participants in the supply chain to improve performance. Common management systems and instruments for performance measurement are developed, enabling guidance for individual companies and the entire supply chain. The coordination-oriented approach supports the supply- chain leadership. Organizational objectives include the selection of strategic partners, the distribution of tasks among companies, process management and ensuring the provision of information to all participants. The information- oriented supply-chain controlling concept emphasizes providing partners with relevant information for decision-making. An efficient reporting structure must be implemented, including strategic and operative organizations in the system and their technical aspects. == Requirements == A requirement for the supply chain is the support of cooperating companies, ensuring future cooperation; companies must focus on common tools and targets. For this, an understanding of processes within the participating companies is indispensable. Information exchange (including sensitive data) within a supply chain is necessary to ensure its control, with coordination among in-house information systems. The requirements for management accounting in supply chains are significantly higher than the provision of key figures, but this is a fundamental task. == Tasks and functions == The tasks and functions of controlling may be transferred to management accounting in supply chains, supplemented by a cross-company approach. However, the past-oriented aspects of the traditional concept are inappropriate. Due to the strategic importance of supply-chain management, forward-looking control requirements must be taken into account. Because of the complexity of a supply chain, a focus on interface management is necessary. In the literature, several tasks and functions are defined. Management accounting in supply chains has the following features: * Planning * Monitoring and control * Information supply * Coordination * Rationality and reflection == Aims == Because of different controlling directions, in management accounting of supply chains different aims are pursued and influence each other. Again, the challenge is the cross- company factor. Independent companies must agree on a common strategy for the SCM and define common aims. Two types of aims exist: direct and indirect.  Direct  Direct aims relate to the support of SCM and controlling. This ensures logistical processes between parties in a supply chain or the introduction of a common performance-measurement system for verification of lead times.  Indirect  Company-wide, generalized aims may be pursued with management accounting in supply chains. Examples are competitiveness, expanding cooperation, growth, market development and greater customer orientation. == Instruments == Management accounting in supply chains draws on modified traditional instruments of managerial accounting to accomplish cross- company objectives. There are two measuring instruments: the supply-chain mapGardner, T.; Cooper, M. (2003): “Strategic Supply Chain Mapping Approaches”; in: Journal of Business Logistics, Vol.24/2, 37–64. and the supply-chain operations reference (SCOR).Poluha, R. (2007): “Application of the SCOR Model in Supply Chain Management”, Youngstown, New York 2007.  Supply-chain scorecard  The basic model of the balanced scorecard (BSC) was introduced by Kaplan and NortonKaplan, R.; Norton, D. (1992): \\"The Balanced Scorecard - Measures that Drive Performance\\", Harvard Business Review, Feb. 1992. in 1992. The BSC aims to achieve a balance between non-financial and financial measures. To use the scorecard in a cross-company context, several modifications of content and structure are necessary. The BSC consists of four generic perspectives, which are geared to the individual company. According to this, a generally accepted framework does not exist.Brewer, P.; Speh, T. (2000): “Using the Balanced Scorecard to measure supply chain performance”, in: Journal of Business Logistics, Vol. 21/1, P. 91. From a common strategy, the supply-chain scorecard (SCS) maps cross-company measures. Brewer and Speh note that focusing on the supply chain requires four perspectives:Brewer, P.; Speh, T. (2000): “Using the Balanced Scorecard to measure supply chain performance”, in: Journal of Business Logistics, Vol. 21/1, P. 78. * Financial benefits * Supply chain-management (SCM) goals * SCM improvement * End customer benefits Independent of perspective, each should include internal and cross-company measures.  Cross-company activity-based costing  Activity- based costing is a model to assign indirect costs into direct ones.Drucker, P. (1999): “Management Challenges of the 21st Century.” New York: Harper Business. To use this model in the context of supply chains, there must be consistent defined and delimited cost and performance data. Since many companies participate in more than one supply chain, standardization across the sector is beneficial. Compatibility of information technology is important for improved data transfer, so manual entry is limited and high availability guaranteed. Several changes result from cross-company activity-based costing:Decker, H.C.; Van Goor, A.R. (2000): ““Supply chain management and management accounting: a case study of activity-based costing”, International Journal of Logistics: Research and Applications, Vol. 3 No. 1, pp. 41-52. * Determination of supply-chain efficiency (aggregate of cost and performance data) * Detailed cost analysis (for decisions) * Process benchmarking between supply-chain members * Realization of target costs  Supply-chain performance-measurement system  A primary task of management accounting in supply chains is performance measurement. The key elements of strategic goals include the measurement of resources, output and flexibility.Beamon, B.M. (1999): “Measuring supply chain Performance“, in: International Journal of Operations & Production Management, Vol. 19 Iss: 3, P. 280. Efficient resource management is critical to profitability; without an acceptable output, customers will turn to other supply chains. In a changing environment, supply chains must adapt.Beamon, B.M. (1999): “Measuring supply chain Performance“, in: International Journal of Operations & Production Management, Vol. 19 Iss: 3, P. 281. Measures for resource performance include total costs, distribution costs, manufacturing costs, measures of inventory and rate of return.Beamon, B.M. (1999): “Measuring supply chain Performance“, in: International Journal of Operations & Production Management, Vol. 19 Iss: 3, P. 282. Examples of performance measures are numbers of items produced, time required to produce, customer satisfaction and product quality (which is difficult to express numerically). Reductions in back orders, increased customer satisfaction and the ability to accommodate demand variations are advantages associated with flexibility. == See also == * Supply chain * Supply chain management * Management control system == References  Further reading == * Beamon, B.M.

Bakan was one of the earliest psychologists to promote the use of Bayesian statistics as an alternative to conventional statistical approaches, first publishing on the topic in 1953. He was one of the founders of the American Psychological Association's Division 26, the History of Psychology, and served as the president of the division in 1970–71. After attending Brooklyn College from 1942 Bakan studied psychology at Indiana University. He received his PhD in 1948 at the Ohio State University, under the direction of Floyd Carlton Dockeray, in aviation psychology, a field of application of industrial psychology . Bakan held several university positions from 1961, teaching at the University of Chicago, Ohio State, Harvard, and York University in Toronto, Canada. Bakan wrote on a wide range of topics including psychoanalysis, religion, philosophy, and research methodology, as well as child abuse. In his book \\"Sigmund Freud and the Jewish Mystical Tradition\\" (1958) he attempted to trace the roots of early psychoanalytic concepts and methods in the Kabbalah, the Zohar, and talmudic interpretations. His \\"Duality of Human Existence: An Essay on Psychology and Religion\\" (1966) made important contributions to the history of psychology, especially in relation to the problem of introspection, research methodology, and the psychology of religion. In this essay he also coined the psychological use of the terms \\"Communion\\" and \\"Agency\\". Other books by Bakan include \\"On Method: Toward a Reconstruction of Psychological Investigation\\" (1967); \\"Disease, Pain, and Sacrifice: Toward a Psychology of Suffering\\" (1968); \\"Slaughter of the Innocents: A Study of the Battered Child Phenomenon (1971)\\"; \\"And They Took Themselves Wives: The Emergence of Patriarchy in Western Civilization\\" (1979); and \\"Maimonides on Prophecy\\" (1991).

Originally a cross-country skier, he was inspired to take up track and field athletics by Finnish victories in the long-distance running events at the 1936 Summer Olympics. He began competing in 1945, following service in World War II, and made his first international appearance at the 1948 Summer Olympics, where he placed seventh in the men's 5000 metres event. The same year he was a national champion in both the 5000 metres and cross-country running and retained the former title through 1949. In 1950 he took home a bronze medal in the 10,000 metres at that year's European Athletics Championships and continued to participate through the 1952 Summer Olympics, after which he retired from active competition and resumed a life of farming. ==Early life== Koskela was born in Virolahti on 31 March 1921. He began his athletic career in the field of cross-country skiing, in which he won a national under-18 event in 1938. Inspired by the Finnish success in long- distance running at the 1936 Summer Olympics, however, he decided to pursue athletics as his sport of choice. His career was interrupted by World War II, during which time he served for his native Finland in the Gulf of Finland and around the Svir River. As a result, his first major competition did not come until the 1945 Kaleva Games in Turku, where he finished fourth in the 5000 metres event as a member of Virolahden Sampo. Despite winning the following year, however, he was not selected to represent Finland at the 1946 European Athletics Championships. ==Competitive career== In 1947, Koskela was first ranked eighth in the world for the 5000 metres. He got his chance to compete on the international stage in 1948 when he attended that year's Summer Olympic Games in London and placed 7th in a field of 33 competitors in the men's 5000 metres. He had been the Finnish national champion in the 5000 metres and cross-country distances that year and would retain the former title in 1949, during which period his world ranking fell to ninth, before to second (behind Emil Zátopek). He also entered the 10,000 metres chart in 1949, ranking fifth in the world. The following year Koskela captured his only major international medal, winning bronze in the 10,000 metres event at the 1950 European Athletics Championships. Nonetheless he fell to sixth and seventh in that year's rankings for the 5000 and 10,000 metres respectively, moving up to sixth in the 10,000 metres in 1951. By the time of the 1952 Summer Olympics (held in his native Finland) he was suffering from muscle pains and was not ranked among the top ten globally in either discipline. In Helsinki he finished 16th in a field of 33 participants in the men's 10,000 metres and did not make the finals of the men's 5000 metres. ==Later life== Koskela retired soon after the Helsinki Olympic Games and focused full-time on farming. As of 2012 he remained active and opened a local athletics event in 2011 at the age of 90 in the village of Pyterlahti, near his home town. His youngest daughter, Taina Sampakoski, was nominated for the Finlandia Prize in 2006. On 10 September 2016, he died at the age of 95. ==References== Category:1921 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1948 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1952 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic athletes of Finland Category:Finnish male long-distance runners Category:European Athletics Championships medalists Category:People from Virolahti ","title":"Väinö Koskela"},{"id":"35227861","text":"Thomas Johnson (died 1737) was an English cleric and academic, a moralist writer. ==Life== Johnson was a Fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge (B.A. 1724, M.A. 1728), who was senior university taxor in 1732; and later chaplain at Whitehall Palace.

He was shot by unidentified gunmen and died in Kirkuk at approximately 9 p.m. on July 21, 2008 in the suburban Kirkuk neighborhood of Shorija. Hama's death remains unsolved after four years. It is believed that he was the victim of the very corrupt police and government personnel, which he had previously reported on. ==Career== Hama’s last story in Livin Magazine was titled, ‘Prostitutes invade Kirkuk.' Hama said that he had the names of police brigadiers, many lieutenants, colonels, and many police and security officers involved in and covering up a prostitution network in Kirkuk. Hama had worked at Livin for three years. ==Personal== Hama was born in Kirkuk on Rashid Awa Street. In Kirkuk, he studied at primary and secondary school. When he died, he was attending the Fine Arts Institution of Kirkuk where he was senior in the Music department. ==Death== The Kurdistan Journalists Syndicate (KJS) said Mama Hama had received a threatening message from an unidentified person on May 15. Hama was shot and died in front of his home in Kirkuk. In the mobile phone Hama was using, there were messages discovered to be from a PUK politician who had threatened him with death prior to assassination. when the politician was asked to attend court hearing he threatened Judge by driving to court with escort of over 100 vehicles full of security forces who would even shoot judge if they were ordered to do so. ==Impact== Immediately after Hama's death, Kirkuk Police Brigadier Jamal Tahir told the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) that the department was investigating. He said it was a \\"serious situation\\" and would get \\"special attention.\\" As of July 21, 2011, Hama's murder remained unsolved. Partially in response to the lack of investigation into Hama's murder, thousands of Kurdish young people and students protested for 60-straight days to \\"address corruption and nepotism in Kurdistan, conduct reform in the political system, stop wasting natural resources, stop using the Kurdish military and security forces to kill civilians. The people have also called on the Kurdish government to stop suppressing and imprisoning journalists and independent writers.\\" Their protests concluded on April 18, 2011, when security forces jailed and injured them. ==Reactions== Livin journalists issued a statement on July 21, 2008, holding KRG officials accountable for Hama's death. Ahmed Mira, editor-in- chief of Lvin Magazine, expressed a desire that Kurdish parties be held responsible for Hama’s death because most security and police in the region are Kurdish. Mira said, \\"Kurdish parties in Kirkuk should be held accountable first, because no investigation has been done yet.\\" Kurdish writer Mariwan Wriya Qanie’s said, \\"Killing this young Kirkuki was a starting point to a world where nothing is normal anymore.\\" Shwan Muhamad, editor-in-chief of Awene newspaper said, “A dirty hand took this young Kirkuki. Soran’s murder was the beginning of a wave which has lasted still, and no one knows about its future. \\"Where’s the result of investigation committees of Kurdish authority?\\" Muhamad commented that the killing could be a starting point for those who want the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) to return to tyranny saying, “Those who are behind committing this act don’t understand democratic values and see returning KRG to tyranny as normal.” ==See also== *List of unsolved murders == References == Category:1987 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Deaths by firearm in Iraq Category:Iraqi journalists Category:Iraqi writers Category:Male murder victims Category:Unsolved murders in Iraq Category:20th- century journalists ","title":"Soran Mama Hama"},{"id":"35227988","text":"En Garde is the 17th volume of the Nancy Drew: Girl Detective series. It was published in 2006 under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene.En Garde at WorldCat ==Plot== The story is told with Nancy Drew as the narrator. Nancy's friend George Fayne is taking fencing classes at Salle Budapest. Every thing seems well except for a shadowy guy who seems to be at both the salle and the fencing meet, but Nancy ignores him for now. George is at the meet with her fencing friends and twins DeLyn and Damon Brittany. When Una, a fencer from Salle Olympique, gets a minor injury due to a faulty gauntlet, it leads to a fight between Bela Kovacs, the coach at Salle Budapest, and Paul Mourbiers, the coach of Salle Olympique, Nancy learns of the two coaches' long rivalry. This deeply affects Kovacs' business as a TV crew records this fight and interviews Mourbiers, who loses no time in bad-mouthing Kovacs. So, Nancy starts investigating to help out. Soon she discovers that Mourbiers called the TV crew to the meet. She also discovers the reason Mourbiers and Kovacs are rivals. At the 1976 Montreal Olympics, during the quarter-final match the duo faced each other. During the bout, Mourbiers' épée touched the ground. The referee did not notice this, but Kovacs did. He protested, but the referee penalized Kovacs a point. This led to him losing the bout. Mourbiers went on win the silver medal. Nancy uses her boyfriend Ned Nickerson's father's high position in mass media to arrange an interview with Kovacs so that he can regain his image, but in vain as Kovacs sends the TV crew away suspecting it to be sent by Mourbiers. As Nancy continues her investigation she discovers that several of the foils are missing their protective tips. While she is investigating, Damon gets involved in an accident when he smells ammonium carbonate (from an ampoule of smelling salts which were placed in DeLyn's fencing mask, which he accidentally wears). At the twins' home, Nancy realizes that over the past few years, DeLyn has won more awards than Damon, and that DeLyn has been throwing some bouts to not let her brother feel sad at being less talented. The next day when Nancy and George go to Salle Olympique to investigate, Una gets injured and Mobiers accuses the duo of being saboteurs from Salle Budapest. As she is about to leave she sees the very same shadowy guy (whom she has nicknamed Raggedy Man) trying to hurt Una. When she catches him, she realizes that he is Una's ex-boyfriend, Dough Calley, who is a member of a rock band (thus explaining his attire) who was at Salle Budapest as he had heard that she was dating Damon. When Nancy returns home, she sees that a saber has been plunged through the door with a note attached to it saying \\"THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO BUSYBODIES\\". After putting together the clues, Nancy finally realizes that the one responsible behind all the events is none other than Damon. The next morning at the college meet, she finds a bottle of strychnine in Una's bag. She finally catches Damon, who reveals that he did all this just to get back at Una for breaking up with him. He ripped off Una's gauntlet's seam, which led to her injury, but his intentions were not injure her, just to get her to lose the bout for improper equipment, but when he saw its effects when people cancelled their lessons, he decided to make it look like Mourbiers was really sabotaging the salle. He did not intend to injure DeLyn by putting the mask on her, instead planning to remove it before the fumes overcame her. He also put the fake poison bottle in Una's bag. Damon is kicked out of the college team and decides to let go of fencing as he was actually sad while competing in it. Meanwhile, DeLyn wins the bout, but Una seems quite happy because Dough Cally improves himself, becoming quite a decent man, and may finally be accepted by her father. Kovacs and Mourbiers reconcile by setting aside the Olympics incident. == References == Category:Nancy Drew books Category:2006 American novels Category:2006 children's books Category:American sports novels ","title":"En Garde (novel)"},{"id":"35227991","text":"The World Education Games is a global online event for all schools and students around the world and is held semi annually during the month of October.

It is organized by the 3PLearning and sponsored by Microsoft, UNICEF, 3P Learning and MACQUARIE. The World Maths Day holds the 'Guinness World Record' for the Largest Online Maths Competition in 2010. Its Global Ambassador is 'Scott Flansburg' aka the Human Calculator. Its inception with the expanded format was in 2012 when 5,960,862 students from 240 countries and territories around the world competed with each other. In 2013, it was held March 5–7. The World Education Games had taken place October 13 through 15, 2015, where over 6 Million students joined worldwide from over 20,000 schools in 159 countries and raised over $100,000 which will help send 33,000 students to school. ==History== The World Education Games is a major free online educational competition-style event, hosted by the global e-learning provider 3P Learning (creators of subscription-based e-learning platforms designed primarily for schools - such as Mathletics, Spellodrome and IntoScience). The World Education Games had its origins purely as a mathematics-based event, then known as World Maths Day in 2007. The event was powered by 3P Learning's flagship online learning resource, Mathletics. In 2011, the event expanded to include a second subject (World Spelling Day, renamed World Literacy Day in 2013), followed a year later by a third subject (World Science Day) and at which point the event took on the fully encompassing World Education Games name and branding. Since 2012 The World Education Games has been collaborating with UNICEF in the framework of a program called \\"School in a Box\\" that supports the development of education in regions that are affected by various disasters and poverty. == Rules == Participation in the games is open to all students from any country and is free. Registration is required and an access to the internet is a must. Students are matched according to their age and grade levels or abilities if such is requested by their teachers. Students play randomly against other students from all over the world. Students answer as many questions as possible during the allotted time for each game. Correct answers get points, wrong answers no points and three wrong answers end the game prematurely. Each student plays and scored for the points accumulated during the first 20 games only. Results are announced after counting all the points and after the organizers had communicated with the parents/ teachers of possible winners and ensured that they had participated in the Games under their own registered accounts. Multiple registrations and/ or playing under someone's else account is a violation punishable by annulling the results of everyone involved. Winners are the students who score the highest points in their grade level in each competition separately and in total. Schools are also awarded for receiving the highest point-average in each grade level as long as at least 10 students had participated from that school. Top 100 participants also get their achievements listed on the Hall of Fame. == World Education Games Ambassadors == Students who win their regional lead-up events in their countries are hand-picked to become ambassadors. {  - !No.!!

In 1577 he graduated there with a master's degree. In 1581 he moved as a private tutor to Ljubljana (Laibach). From 1582 he studied jurisprudence in Padua and was then active as a private tutor of young noblemen from Croatia and Styria. In 1588/89 he travelled to Italy and Malta, and in 1591 to North Germany, the Netherlands and England. In 1590/91 he was granted the title of \\"Ordinarius Historiographus\\" by Archduke Charles in Graz. In 1592, still in Graz, he published his Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene. He made the acquaintance of the young Johannes Kepler, and remained in learned correspondence with him. After further travels he settled in Frankfurt am Main and married the daughter of the printer Johann Spiess.Johann Spieß at Deutsche Biographie. From 1593 until 1601 he was the Rector of the evangelical \\"Collegium sapientiae et pietatis\\" in Klagenfurt, Carinthia. After returning to Frankfurt am Main he became Professor of History at the University of Leipzig. From 1610 the interest of the Upper Austrian dignitaries in history was so great that they required a historian to head up the provincial library, in a similar way to a court historian. Megiser was selected for this role in 1615, and was commissioned to write a chronicle of the province. In 1612 he published Annales Carinthiae or Chronica des Loeblichen Ertzhertzogthumbs Khaerndten, which he signed as his own work, although it was mainly written by Carinthian pastor Michael Gothard Christalnick and only edited by Megiser on the request of the Carinthian Estates.Grossman, Karl: Megiser, Christalnick und die Annales Carinthiae, Mitteilungen des Institus fuer Oesterreichische Geschichtsforschung 57, 1949, pg. 359-372. ==Further reading== * Hubert Bergmann: Beobachtungen zu Megisers 'Dictionarium quatuor linguarum' von 1592 bzw. 1744 aus Sicht der bairischen Dialektlexikografie, in: Fokus Dialekt.

The album reworks versions of \\"Missing\\", \\"Sane\\" and \\"Love's to Blame\\" which the band had recorded earlier. == Critical reception == Cross Rhythms' Simon Eden said \\"as a rock album, this is quite a man's man album - powerful stadium rock with a sound like a roaring inferno.\\" Indie Vision Music's Jonathan Andre said \\"Crave is not your cliché album, and I was very intrigued to listen to it, to see if their sounds on the album were similar to that of their sister, Rebecca.\\" Furthermore, Andre wrote \\"though not a perfect album, this is a solid one from two Australians that will definitely go far in the American industry!\\" Jesus Freak Hideout's Ryan Barbee said \\"at first listen, I was honestly expecting something unappealing and typical. I was pleasantly surprised and happily repented of my negative predisposition. The brothers have truly offered a well-crafted album in Crave, and have given listeners something fresh to hear. The lyrics have depth, the music has energy and it is balanced wonderfully. If this is how they begin, I will definitely be craving more fine songs in the future from for King & Country.\\" Jesus Freak Hideout's Michael Weaver said \\"Crave is full of soaring melodies as well as a stunning mix of guitars, piano, strings, keyboard, and electronic effects.\\" In addition, Weaver wrote \\"Crave has something great to offer at nearly every turn.\\" Weaver summed up \\"Crave, as a whole is nothing short of brilliant.\\" Christianity Today's Lisa Ann Cockrel said \\"Crave is full of hopeful anthems that ratify For King and Country's earnest moniker.\\" However, Cockrel wrote \\"More grit would have served the project well. Most tracks start with some creative promise, only to devolve into generic riffs.\\" New Release Tuesday's Sarah Fine said \\"Crave is hands-down one of the best debut projects I've heard from a group in years. Creative, poignant and moving, it comes from a very raw place of heartache and hope, never backing down from the honest truth, yet never shying away from the restoration found in Christ. Musically, it's unlike anything in the genre right now. Haunting, playful and deep all at once, it could quite easily beat out many of its mainstream counterparts.\\" New Release Tuesday's Jonathan Francesco said \\"Crave is destined to be a classic and will hopefully prove to have legs and land on many year-end lists despite its early release.\\" Out Housers' Jeremy Shane said \\"because of the pop sound, I find all of their album to be pretty listenable, and there's nothing on it I really hate. Although also because of this some of my favorite songs on Crave are probably the less poppy and more unique sounding songs.\\" The reason for the low score is because Shane only considers that \\"there are two or three songs on it that will be added into my regular playlists in my own music.\\" Lastly, Shane wrote \\"I'd recommend this album to anyone into light or pop rock.\\" == Track listing == An expanded edition was released in 2013 containing two additional songs: \\"The Proof of Your Love [The Monologue Mix]\\" and \\"Hope Is What We Crave\\".

The Court found that the test in R. v. Oakes (which is used to determine whether a law that infringes a section of the Charter is unconstitutional under section 1 of the Charter) does not apply to administrative law decisions, although there is \\"conceptual harmony\\" between the review for reasonableness and the Oakes framework. Instead, the question is whether the administrative decision is reasonable, in that it reflects a proportionate balancing of the Charter rights and values at play. In addition to the parties (Doré, the Barreau du Québec, the Tribunal des professions, and the Attorney General of Quebec), the Court heard from the following intervenors: the Federation of Law Societies of Canada, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, and the Young Bar Association of Montreal. ==Background== Initial dispute On June 18 and 19, 2001, Gilles Doré appeared as a defence counsel in a criminal proceeding in the Superior Court of Quebec. During Doré's oral arguments, the judge said in reference to Doré: \\"an insolent lawyer is rarely of use to his client\\". On June 21, 2001, in his written reasons dismissing Doré's arguments, the judge was highly critical of Doré's arguments and his manner and style in court. The judge called Doré's application \\"totally ridiculous\\", and that Doré \\"on or obsessed with his narrow vision of reality, which is not consistent with the facts, Mr. Doré has done nothing to help his client discharge his burden.\\" Doré's letter and complaint Later on June 21, 2001, Doré wrote an extremely insulting private letter to the judge, which included the following complaints: *\\"Just a few minutes ago, as you hid behind your status like a coward, you made comments about me that were both unjust and unjustified.\\" *\\"Your chronic inability to master any social skills (to use an expression in English, that language you love so much), which has caused you to become pedantic, aggressive and petty in your daily life...\\" *\\"Your legal knowledge, which appears to have earned the approval of a certain number of your colleagues, is far from sufficient to make you the person you could or should be professionally.\\" *\\"Your determination to obliterate any humanity from your judicial position, your essentially non-existent listening skills, and your propensity to use your court – where you lack the courage to hear opinions contrary to your own – to launch ugly, vulgar, and mean personal attacks not only confirms that you are as loathsome as suspected, but also casts shame on you as a judge...\\" *\\"...you possess the most appalling of all defects for a man in your position: You are fundamentally unjust.\\" On June 22, 2001, Doré wrote to the Chief Justice, indicating that he was not making a complaint, but that he was requesting not to appear in front of the judge in question. On July 10, 2001, Doré made a complaint to the Canadian Judicial Council about the judge's conduct. The council would later conclude in 2002 that the judge made \\"unjustified derogatory remarks to Mr. Doré\\", and supported some of the complaints that Doré had about the judge, but with less inflammatory language. The judge later recused himself from a trial where Doré was counsel. Disciplinary Council In March 2002, disciplinary proceedings began against Doré in relation to the June 21, 2001 letter he wrote to the judge. The complaint was that he violated Article 2.03 of the Code of ethics of advocates, which stated, at the time, that: \\"[T]he conduct of an advocate must bear the stamp of objectivity, moderation and dignity.\\" The proceedings took place between April 2003 and January 2006. The Disciplinary Council found that the letter was \\"likely to offend and is rude and insulting\\". The Council found that the letter was not private since it was written by Doré as a lawyer. The Council also found that the judge's conduct did not justify the letter. The Council rejected Doré's argument that Article 2.03 violated the freedom of expression in s. 2 of the Charter. The Council acknowledged that the rule limited Doré's freedom of expression, but that it was justified and necessary. As a penalty, Doré's ability to practice law was suspended for 21 days. Tribunal des professions Doré appealed to the Tribunal des professions. The Tribunal ruled that the full Oakes test to determine whether a Charter infringement was justified under s. 1 of the Charter was inappropriate in these circumstances. Instead, applying a test of proportionality, the Discipline Council's decision was a \\"minimal limitation\\". Superior Court of Quebec On judicial review, the Superior Court of Quebec upheld the Tribunal's decision. Quebec Court of Appeal The Quebec Court of Appeal applied the full Oakes test, but still found that the Discipline Council's decision was justified under s. 1 of the Charter. ==Reasons of the court== The only issue appealed before the Court was whether the Discipline Council's decision infringed his right to freedom of expression under s. 2(b) of the Charter. A unanimous decision was written by Abella J. The Court found that a more flexible approach is required to applying Charter values to administrative law decisions affecting a single individual, and that a full Oakes s. 1 analysis created too many difficulties. The Court went on to find that the standard of review for an administrative tribunal's decision as it relates to the impact on a specific individual's Charter rights is \\"reasonableness\\", not \\"correctness\\". That is, a reviewing court will only interfere if the decision was unreasonable. If the decision was reasonable, even if the reviewing court would have come to different conclusion, then the reviewing court will not interfere. With the standard of review in mind, the Court found that a decision will be reasonable if the decision-maker balances the Charter values with the statutory objectives by doing the following: #Considering what the statutory objectives are. #Determining how the Charter values at issue are best protected in view of the statutory objectives. A court reviewing the decision-maker's decision must decide whether the decision reflects a proportional balancing of the Charter protections in play. In applying the above analysis to Doré's case, the Court found that the issue was how to balance the right of freedom of expression and making open criticism of the judicial process with the need to ensure civility in the legal profession. The Court went on to find that the Discipline Council's decision to reprimand Doré was not an unreasonable balance. ==External links== * Category:2012 in Canadian case law Category:Canadian administrative case law Category:Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms case law Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:Canadian freedom of expression case law ","title":"Doré v Barreau du Québec"},{"id":"35228286","text":"Ashok Bhalchandra Gokhale is a retired Indian diplomat.

He was briefly an assistant in Munich and Darmstadt, before he went into the teaching profession in Gunzburg, Nördlingen. As a student he was drawn to the history of mathematics after observing his mentor Faber publishing works of Euler. Another influence was Henry Wieleitner, with whom he published several works on the history of calculus. As a school teacher, he continued his historical studies. In 1939 he habilitated in the history of mathematics at the University of Berlin. From 1940 to 1945 he edited an edition of the works of Leibnitz for the Berlin Academy of Sciences. Hofmann returned to secondary education in Gunzburg from 1947 until his retirement in 1963. He also had (in part-time) professor of the History of Mathematics at the Albert Ludwig's University of Freiburg, the Humboldt University of Berlin, the Eberhard Karls University of Tuebingen (honorary professorship in 1950) and the Technical University of Karlsruhe. Hofmann organized regular symposia on the history of mathematics at the Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach, where he worked right after the war. Hofmann was considered an expert in the development of calculus by Leibniz, whose time in Paris he studied carefully. He recorded how the Newton-Leibniz calculus controversy contributed to the invention of calculus. He was co-editor of the works of Leibniz, of Nicholas of Cusa, and of Johann Bernoulli as well as a mathematical history of Abraham Gotthelf Kästner. He also wrote about number theory of Leonhard Euler and Pierre de Fermat . He uncovered some new works of Fermat (published 1943). Out for a morning walk, he was killed by a vehicular hit and run. == Writings == *Selected Writings, 2 vols, (Editor Christoph Scriba ), Olms, Hildesheim 1990 with Oskar Becker : History of Mathematics, Bonn, Atheneum Publishing, 1951 (derived from Hofmann Part 2 and 3) *History of Mathematics, 3 volumes, de Gruyter, collection Goschen 1953-1957 (Part 1: From the beginnings to the emergence of Fermat and Descartes, 1953, Part 2: From Fermat and Descartes to the invention of calculus and to the development of new Methods, 2nd edition 1963, Part 3: From the debate over the calculus until the French Revolution, 1957, with detailed bibliography).

Its original title is in Tagalog: Kung Paano Ko Inayos Ang Buhok Ko Matapos Ang Mahaba-haba Ring Paglalakbay. The book, however, is commonly but unofficially also called Mondomanila due to the success of the film Mondomanila, which is very loosely based on the story. Published in 2005 by Kamias Road's Automatic Writings, the book How I Fixed My Hair After a Rather Long Journey became a critical success, receiving praise for its unflinchingly honest portrayal of life in the slums. The adaptation of the novel starring Tim Mabalot was released in 2012. Called Mondomanila, the film is directed by Khavn. It premiered at the 41st International Film Festival Rotterdam in January 2012. The screenplay was co-written by Khavn and Wilwayco. ==Plot== In a world where cargo boxes are houses and a full meal a day is a feast, Tony de Guzman subsists as a sophist but with plans to avenge his oppression. He begins his journey as the neighborhood water-carrier, cursing his estranged father for being a financial detriment with a pompous vision of education for his sons. Tony’s life is bridled by a string of endless acquaintances and relations dating back to his childhood. From his matchbox home of a nagging mother with dreams of romance and a kid brother sexually assaulted by an American pedophile, Tony takes minuscule steps along a narrow path of grime that is his community and elbows his way out of an interesting company of neighbors: Almang Paybsiks, the town gossip; Pablong Shoeshine, the arsonist Casanova; Mutya, the dilettante gangster; Sgt. Pepper, the town's resident macho who has a gay son; and Domeng, the pimp. When Tony is given the unique chance to become a scholar in the state university and later, to be employed as a prestigious computer engineer, he thought he had successfully escaped the filth of the slums—only to encounter worse depravity in fair skins and fragrant garments. Tony’s appetite for escape then becomes insatiable. ==Reception== Critics and readers alike are unanimous in their praise of How I Fixed My Hair After a Rather Long Journey, comparing the book to Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting, J.D Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, and Edgardo M. Reyes's now classic Tagalog novel Sa Mga Kuko Ng Liwanag. Wilwayco's crudeness of language emphasized the cesspool of violence and obscenity that the main character finds himself in. One reviewer writes on Good Reads, \\"This is another book, a local one this time. You will not find anything likeable but since it is written brilliantly, I have no qualms of giving this a 5-star rating here in Goodreads. You hate the characters and what they do but you love the writing.\\" Another comments, \\"Vulgar, crass, puke-inducing, shocking--these are the reflexes that How I Fixed My Hair After a Rather Long Journey playfully provokes. It is the much more 'squatter-punk' version of Wilwayco for you. A good read. It cleverly circumvented the categories of 'porno', 'violence porn' or 'I-Witness-type poverty porn' as Wilwayco displayed artistic mastery in story-telling and fleshing out the reality of otherwise 'fictional' characters.\\" One criticism of the book is that it is riddled with typographical errors. But Wilwayco and the publisher were quick to defend this, saying How I Fixed My Hair After a Rather Long Journey was intended as a gritty social commentary. The errors were deliberate in much the same way that typographical errors were deliberate in Jack Kerouac's On the Road. ==References *Palanca Awardees announced, September 02, 2002 *Palanca Harvest for 2003 by Reinerio A.

In the same year he started studying geography and history at the University of Vienna. His dissertation on the history of Croatian settlements in the south eastern border regions of the German-speaking lands was approved in 1937. Breu, who was a polyglot, worked at the Geography Department of the University of Vienna from 1936 to 1938. In 1939 he started teaching at the Abbey’s Secondary School at Melk, but was drafted to the Wehrmacht in the same year, where he worked for the cartographic service. After World War II Breu worked as a surveyor and private teacher, before he entered the service of the Federal Office for Metrology and Surveying at Vienna (Bundesamt für Eich- und Vermessungswesen). From 1959 until 1966 he again taught at a grammar school. Already in 1959 Breu hat started collaborating with the Vienna based Institute for East and Southeast European Studies (Ost- und Südosteuropa-Institut). From 1966 until 1979, the year of his retirement, he was the head of the geographic department of that institution. After his habilitation in 1974 Breu became a docent at the Geography Department of the University of Vienna. In 1982 he became a corresponding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. ==Fields of activities and works== Within the Institute for East and Southeast European Studies Breus main field of activity was the Atlas of the Danubian Countries.Breu, Josef (ed.): Atlas der Donauländer / Atlas of the Danubian countries / Atlas des pays danubiens / Atlas dunajskih stran. 11 fascicles. Wien 1970-1989. Josef Breu was also very active in the sphere of toponomastics, especially in the standardization of geographical names. In 1969 he initiated the foundation of the Austrian Board on Geographical Names (Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Kartographische Ortsnamenkunde), that functions as a clearinghouse of the main Austrian federal and provincial authorities and institutions of science and research as well as of private publishers concerned with geographical names. Breu held the chair of this board until 1982. In 1975 he published his Gazetteer of Austria,Breu, Josef: Gazetteer of Austria, edited in accordance with the recommendations of the United Nations / Geographisches Namenbuch Österreichs, bearbeitet nach den Empfehlungen der Vereinten Nationen. Vienna/Wien, Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften 1975. . edited in accordance with the recommendations of the United Nations. This dictionary of geographical proper names of Austria, one of his main works, covers rivers, lakes, glaciers, mountains, passes, mountain ranges, populated places, roads, railways, waterways, etc. It gives a broad range of data with every name, such as correct spelling, pronunciation, indication of the respective topographic category, location, geographical coordinates, elevation above sea level, name of the administrative unit in which the name feature is situated, variant forms (if any) and grammatical references. From 1976 until 1982 Breu held the chair of the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names (Ständiger Ausschuss für Geographische Namen), a board which promotes and coordinates the standardization of toponyms in the German-speaking countries. In 1977 Josef Breu was elected Chair of the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names (UNGEGN), where he had already been active for several years before. The UNGEGN Toponymic Guidelines were established on his initiative. ==NotesReferences== * Hausner, Isolde: Nachruf auf ao. Univ.-Prof. Dr. phil. Josef Breu.

This citizen science human-based computation game challenges players to map retinal neurons. Eyewire launched on December 10, 2012. Over five years, 250,000 people from 150 countries have signed up. The game utilizes data generated by the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research. Eyewire gameplay advances neuroscience by enabling the reconstruction of morphological neuron data, which helps researchers model information processing circuits. Anyone with an internet connection can participate by solving 2D puzzles to fit together segmentation produced by artificial intelligence used to map the connectome. In Eyewire, players reconstruct 3D models of neurons from electron microscope images by solving puzzles. Playing requires no scientific background. ==Gameplay== Eyewire challenges players, \\"Eyewirers\\", to map neurons in 3D. Upon registering, players are directed through a tutorial that explains the game. Supplementary video tutorials are available on the Eyewire Blog. In Eyewire, the player is given a cube with a partially reconstructed neuron branch stretching through it. On the right side of the screen is a grayscale image of the cross sections of neurons. The player learns to \\"color\\" inside a gray outline of a single neuron branch, which usually extends from one side of the cube to another. As a player colors, segmentations that were generated by AI are added to the 3D section on the left of the screen. Reconstructions are compared across players as each cube is submitted, yielding a consensus reconstruction that is later checked by expert players of rank Scout and Scythe. These players have the power to extend branches, remove erroneous segments (nicknamed \\"mergers\\"), and flag cubes for further review. This end result is volumetric reconstructions of complete neurons. Scoring Each volume is presented to two to five different players. Generally, the trace chosen by the majority of accurate players is accepted. Players win points based on whether their tracing matches the majority of other players' tracings, time spent on the cube, and the new amount of neural volume found. ==Goal== The goal of Eyewire is to identify and classify specific cell types as well as potentially expand the known broad classes of retinal cells. Eyewire aims to advance the use of artificial intelligence in neuronal reconstruction. The project aims to help determine how mammals see directional motion. Over 1,000 neurons mapped by Eyewirers may be explored on the Eyewire Museum, a browser-based visualization tool that pairs anatomical and functional data. ==Methods== The activity of each neuron in a 350×300×60 μm3 portion of a retina was determined by two-photon microscopy. Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, the same volume was stained to bring out the contrast of the plasma membranes, sliced into layers by a microtome, and imaged using an electron microscope. A neuron is selected by the researchers. The program chooses a cubic volume associated with that neuron for the player, along with an artificial intelligence's best guess for tracing the neuron through the two-dimensional images. ==Publications== * * * ==Accomplishments== * Eyewire neurons featured at 2014 TED Conference Virtual Reality Exhibit. * Eyewire neurons featured at US Science and Engineering Expo in Washington, DC. * Eyewire won the National Science Foundation's 2013 International Visualization Challenge in the Games and Apps Category. * An Eyewire image by Alex Norton won MIT's 2014 Koch Image Gallery Competition. * Eyewire named one of Discover Magazines Top 100 Science Stories of 2013. * Eyewire named top citizen science project of 2013 by SciStarter. * Eyewire won Biovision's World Life Sciences Forum Catalyzer Prize on March 26, 2013. * Eyewire named to top 10 citizen science projects of 2013 by PLoS.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Ormskirk, the archdeaconry of Warrington, and the diocese of Liverpool. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. ==History== A chapel was first built in Skelmersdale in 1776 as a chapel of ease to St Peter and St Paul, Ormskirk. It was enlarged in 1823 and again in 1850. In 1856 it became a parish church in its own right, and was dedicated to Saint Paul. Later in the 19th century the chapel was damaged by subsidence due to coal mining. The present church was built on different site nearby. Its foundation stone was laid in July 1903, and the church was consecrated on 18 December 1906 by the Rt Revd Francis Chavasse, bishop of Liverpool. It was designed by the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley, and provided seating for 575 people. The plan was to add a tower on the north side of the chancel, but this was never built. ==Architecture== Exterior The church is constructed in sandstone rubble with ashlar dressings, and has a red tiled roof. Its architectural style is free Perpendicular. The plan consists of a five-bay nave with a clerestory, a west canted baptistry, north and south aisles, and a chancel, with the base of the projected tower to the north, and a vestry to the south. The clerestory windows have arched heads and contain rounded tracery. The windows along the sides of the aisles are flat-headed, and also contain rounded tracery. At the west end of the church buttresses flank the baptistry, above which is an arched four-light window. On the tower base is a pyramidal roof. Interior Inside the church the arcades are carried on octagonal piers. Below the clerestory windows is a continuous impost with a raised carved inscription in Latin. The east window contains stained glass by Shrigley and Hunt. The two-manual pipe organ was built by Rushworth and Dreaper. ==External features== The churchyard contains the war graves of three service personnel of World War I, and seven of World War II. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Skelmersdale *List of ecclesiastical works by Austin and Paley (1895–1914) ==References== Category:Church of England church buildings in Lancashire Category:Anglican Diocese of Liverpool Category:Grade II listed churches in Lancashire Category:Churches completed in 1906 Category:Austin and Paley buildings Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in England Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Lancashire Category:Churches in the Borough of West Lancashire Category:Skelmersdale Category:1776 establishments in England ","title":"St Paul's Church, Skelmersdale"},{"id":"35228549","text":"Zahray-ye Bala Rural District () is a rural district (dehestan) in the Central District of Buin Zahra County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

In 1902 the elder Trujillo's home was destroyed by fire during conflicts between English-speaking cattle ranchers and the Spanish Trujillos, who were by then major landowners in the area.

The ranch house is a two-story rectangular log structure, covered by a modern metal roof. The walls consist mainly of unhewn logs, joined at the corners with V notches. Daubing fills the gaps between the logs. The main facade faces east, and is three bays wide, with sash windows in the outer bays, and a simple wooden doorway at the center.

It is considered to be benign since it does not spread beyond the bone. Unicameral bone cysts can be classified into two categories: active and latent. An active cyst is adjacent to the epiphyseal plate and tends to grow until it fills the entire diaphysis, the shaft, of the bone; depending on the invasiveness of the cyst, it can cause a pathological fracture or even destroy the epiphyseal plate leading to the permanent shortening of the bone. A latent cyst is located away from the epiphyseal plate and is more likely to heal with treatment. It is typically diagnosed in children from the aged 5 to 15. Although unicameral bone cysts can form in any bone structure, it is predominantly found in the proximal humerus and proximal femur; additionally, it affects males twice as often as females. ==Signs and symptoms== Most unicameral bone cysts do not cause any symptoms and are discovered as accidental findings on radiographs or CT scans made for other reasons. Large lesions can cause nearby areas of bone to thin, which may result in a fracture and cause pain. ==Cause== There is not a specific theory behind the etiology of the unicameral bone cyst, however, according to many researchers and doctors, there is a commonly known theory hypothesized by Jonathan Cohen in 1970. Cohen studied interstitial fluid in six children undergoing treatment for unicameral bone cysts. He believed that the chemical composition of the fluid found in the bone cyst was similar to the chemical make-up in serum. Cohen theorized that the unicameral bone cyst occurs when interstitial fluids in cancellous bones quickly accumulate in one region from blockage. One of the other theories is that the cysts result from a disorder of the growth plate. Another is that the cysts result from problems with circulation that are caused by a developmental anomaly in the veins of the affected bone. The role trauma plays in the development of these cysts is unknown. Some speculate that repeated trauma puts the bone at risk for developing a bone cyst. This, however, has not been proven. ==Diagnosis == X-rays Unicameral bone cysts are found incidentally on X-rays. About 90 to 95% of the lesion is found in metaphysics of long bones. The cyst is centered, oblong in shape along the long axis of a long bone. Rarely, they are large and multicameral and are found in diaphysis. When fracture is present, there may be a small bone fragment migrated in the cystic fluid. This is called \\"fallen fragment sign\\" which is diagnostic of unicameral bone cyst. Besides, a bubble migrating upwards (known as \\"rising bubble sign\\") is another feature suggesting of unicameral bone cyst. Computerized tomography (CT) Scan CT scan shows a thin-walled lesion with pseudo septum (incomplete septum or a septum with perforations that allows communications between two chambers). CT scan is used to access cyst wall thickness and risk of fracture. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Magnetic resonance imaging scans are used to identify the precise location of the cyst, to see how aggressive the disease is, and to determine the actual shape and size. The MRI uses a combination of magnets and radio-frequencies to produce various detailed, computerized images of the cyst and its surrounding body structures. Bone scans  a nuclear imaging method to evaluate any degenerative and/or arthritic changes in the joints; to detect bone diseases and tumors; to determine the cause of bone pain or inflammation. This test is to rule out other cysts (which are quite unusual) ==Treatment== If there is a high probability of a fracture resulting from the unicameral bone cyst, then surgical treatment is necessary. Specific methods can be determined by the physician based upon the patient’s age, medical history, tolerance for certain medical procedures or medicine, health, and extremity of the disease. The treatment can involve or incorporate one or more of the following surgical methods, which are performed by a pediatric orthopedic surgeon: *Curettage: :Surgeons create an incision or opening in the bone to drain out the fluids inside the cyst. After the fluid is drained, a curette is used to scrape the lining tissue out of the lesion. *Bone Grafting: :Bone grafting is proceeded with after curettage; the empty cavity is transplanted with donor bone tissue, bone chips taken from another bone, or artificial material. *Steroid injection: :An injection of methylprednisolone acetate into the lesion helps reduce the levels of prostaglandin. Prostaglandin is a fatty acid that reduces cyst’s ability to be reabsorbed into the bone. To begin an operation using steroids, biopsy needles are placed into the cyst and the interstitial fluids are drained. The cyst is then filled with radiographic contrast to determine the volume and shape of the cyst. If the cyst can be filled, it will be injected with methylprednisolone acetate in several intervals for a time span of six to twelve months. Once the level of prostaglandin decreases, the cyst will be reabsorbed into the bone and disappear. Treatments using steroid injections are preferred over curettage, but there are few risks from the method, which are limited to infection, fracture, and reappearance of the cyst. If a patient needs to be treated with surgery, a standard surgical procedure would be called for; the patient would be resting in Fowler’s position, a semi-sitting position, under general anesthesia. The exact size, shape, and distance between the acromion to the midpoint of the cyst are measured by a digital radiograph or MRI scan. A small, longitudinal skin incision, about 1 cm long, is made at the center of the cyst. Next, by using a trephine or drill bit, a small aperture is made inside the incision. Fluids contained in the cyst are drained and curved, metal impactors are used to break any septa, or membranes, within the cyst. Curettes are then used to remove the entire cyst from the diaphysis. After the removal of the cystic membrane, a 95% ethanol solution is injected into the cavity to produce a chemical cauterization to burn away any residual active membrane for 30 seconds and then aspirated. Saline solution is then immediately injected into the cavity to wash out any residual ethanol solution and to mitigate any damage to healthy tissue; this irrigation process of ethanol and saline solutions is repeated for another 2 to 3 times. A curved impactor is inserted into the cavity and used to penetrate the boundary between the cyst and bone marrow; the intentional penetrations will allow bone marrow cells to migrate into the cavity to produce a source of osteoinductive cells, cells that induce bony growth.

Various authors have proposed identifying many different leadership styles as exhibited by leaders in the political, business or other fields. Studies on leadership style are conducted in the military field, expressing an approach that stresses a holistic view of leadership, including how a leader's physical presence determines how others perceive that leader. The factors of physical presence in this context include military bearing, physical fitness, confidence, and resilience. The leader's intellectual capacity helps to conceptualize solutions and to acquire knowledge to do the job. A leader's conceptual abilities apply agility, judgment, innovation, interpersonal tact, and domain knowledge. Domain knowledge encompasses tactical and technical knowledge as well as cultural and geopolitical awareness. Publication available at Army Knowledge Online (www.us.army.mil) and General Dennis J. Reimer Training and Doctrine Digital Library at (www.train.army.mil), FM 6–22. Daniel Goleman (2000) in his article \\"Leadership that Gets Results\\" talks about six styles of leadership. ==Autocratic== The autocratic leadership style particularly emphasises the distinction between authoritarian leaders and their followers. These types of leaders make sure to create only a distinct professional relationship. They regard direct supervision as fundamental in maintaining a successful environment and followership. Authoritarian leadership styles often follow the vision of those that are in control, and may not necessarily be compatible with those that are being led. Authoritarian leaders focus on efficiency, potentially seeing other styles, such as a democratic style, as a hindrance on progress. Examples of authoritarian leadership: a police officer directing traffic, a teacher ordering a student to do their assignment, and a supervisor instructing a subordinate to clean a workstation. All of these positions require a distinct set of characteristics that give the leader the position to get things in order or to get a point across. Authoritarian traits include: setting goals individually, engaging primarily in one-way and downward communication, controlling discussion with followers, and dominating interactions. Several studies have confirmed a relationship between bullying, on the one hand, and an autocratic leadership and an authoritarian way of settling conflicts or dealing with disagreements, on the other. An authoritarian style of leadership may create a climate of fear, leaving little or no room for dialogue, and where subordinates may regard complaining as futile. As such, authoritarian styles have sometimes been associated with reduced group-member satisfaction relative to more democratic leadership styles. Forsyth, D. (2010). Group dynamics (5th Ed.). Belmont, California: Wadsworth. Authoritarian leadership became trendy for a period in the inter- war years - witness for example Stalin, Mussolini and Pilsudski. ==Paternalistion== The way a paternalistic leader works is by acting as a parental figure by taking care of their subordinates as a parent would. In this style of leadership the leader supplies complete concern for their followers or workers. In return they receive the complete trust and loyalty of their people. Workers under this style of leader are expected to become totally committed to what the leader believes and will not strive off and work independently. The relationship between these co-workers and leader are extremely solid. The workers are expected to stay with a company for a longer period of time because of the loyalty and trust. Not only do they treat each other like family inside the work force, but outside too. These workers are able to go to each other with any problems they have regarding something because they believe in what they say is going to truly help them. One of the downsides to a paternalistic leader is that the leader could start to play favorites in decisions. This leader would include the workers more apt to follow and start to exclude the ones who were less loyal. In today's market paternalism is more difficult to come by according to Padavic and Earnest who wrote \\"business dimensional and Organizational Counseling.\\" They believe this because there have become more lay-offs and stronger unionization. This affects paternalistic leaders because the co-workers may not believe that their jobs are 100% ensured. When this happens, workers begin to look for bigger and better job opportunities instead of staying at one company for a longer period of time. Because of this, the leader may be thinking that you could be leaving and not fully believe you when you tell them something about a job opportunity. This could put the workers and leader at risk for a bad situation. According to B. M. Bass, who wrote Leadership and Performance Beyond Expectations, workers who follow paternalistic leadership also have better organization skills. The leader encourages organization because they allow the workers to complete tasks so that they can stay on top of their work. The workers complete tasks this boosts self-confidence and it makes them work harder to reach a goal and exceed the goal to prove to their boss they are working hard. Having this style of leadership can also help implement a reward system. This system will allow their workers to work even better because there is something for them at the end of the tunnel. While doing this they will also be able to accomplish more work in a set time frame. Even though paternalistic leadership style is practiced in majority of places such as India, South east Asia, Middle East and Africa, there hasn't been concrete empirical research on the implications of this leadership style due to the pre-conceived negative notions of the Western Literature. These negative notions arise due to differences in the intrinsic cultural aspects defined by Geert Hofstede's study (1980). He stated that North American and Western European countries classify themselves as an individualistic culture that is centred around the principles of egalitarianism, lack of in-group interdependence, direct communication and low power distance. Therefore, from a western perspective, the authoritative aspects of paternalism are not accepted innately whereas the parental aspect of this leadership style is looked upon as an invasion of privacy as personal and professional lives are two separate facets of life. On the other hand, paternalistic leadership style is quite effective and successful in non-western cultures which are collectivistic in nature as these societies look up to their leaders as a fatherly figure and rely upon him for guidance and protection in return of deference and loyalty, thereby aligning with the principles of paternalistic style. It is essential that extensive research be initiated, from a Non- Western point of view to understand the implications of this leadership style on social, cultural and organisational metrics without any negative bias. This would help in better comprehension of factors which lead to successful leaders and organisations in emerging economies where paternalistic leadership style is practiced at large. ==Democratic== The democratic leadership style consists of the leader sharing the decision-making abilities with group members by promoting the interests of the group members and by practicing social equality. The boundaries of democratic participation tend to be circumscribed by the organization or the group needs and the instrumental value of people's attributes (skills, attitudes, etc.). The democratic style encompasses the notion that everyone, by virtue of their human status, should play a part in the group's decisions. However, the democratic style of leadership still requires guidance and control by a specific leader. The democratic style demands the leader to make decisions on who should be called upon within the group and who is given the right to participate in, make, and vote on decisions. Research has found that this leadership style is one of the most effective and creates higher productivity, better contributions from group members, and increased group morale. Democratic leadership can lead to better ideas and more creative solutions to problems because group members are encouraged to share their thoughts and ideas. While democratic leadership is one of the most effective leadership styles, it does have some potential downsides. In situations where roles are unclear or time is of the essence, democratic leadership can lead to communication failures and uncompleted projects. Democratic leadership works best in situations where group members are skilled and eager to share their knowledge. It is also important to have plenty of time to allow people to contribute, develop a plan, and then vote on the best course of action. '' ==Laissez-faire== The laissez-faire leadership style is where all the rights and power to make decisions is fully given to the followers. This was first described by Lewin, Lippitt, and White in 1939, along with the autocratic leadership and the democratic leadership styles. Laissez-faire leaders allow followers to have complete freedom to make decisions concerning the completion of their work. It allows followers a self- rule, while at the same time offering guidance and support when requested. The laissez-faire leader using guided freedom provides the followers with all materials necessary to accomplish their goals, but does not directly participate in decision making unless the followers request their assistance. This is an effective style to use when: * Followers are highly skilled, experienced, and educated. * Followers have pride in their work and the drive to do it successfully on their own. * Followers are experts, in situations where followers have more knowledge than the group leader. * Followers are trustworthy and experienced. Note that these conditions would intuitively mean that the group is already likely to be effective. This style should not be used when: * The leader cannot or will not provide regular feedback to their followers. This leadership style has been associated with lower productivity than both autocratic and democratic styles of leadership and with lower group member satisfaction than democratic leadership. Some researchers have suggested that laissez-faire leadership can actually be considered non- leadership or leadership avoidance.Bono, J. E. & Judge, T. A. (2010). Personality and Transformational and Transactional Leadership: A Meta- Analysis. Journal of Applied Psychology 89, 901–910. == Transactional == Transactional leaders focus their leadership on motivating followers through a system of rewards and punishments. There are two factors which form the basis for this system, Contingent Reward and management-by-exception. * Contingent reward provides rewards, materialistic or psychological, for effort and recognizes good performance. * Management-by-exception allows the leader to maintain the status quo. The leader intervenes when subordinates do not meet acceptable performance levels and initiates corrective action to improve performance. Management by exception helps reduce the workload of managers being that they are only called-in when workers deviate from course. This type of leader identifies the needs of their followers and gives rewards to satisfy those needs in exchange for a certain level of performance. Transactional leaders focus on increasing the efficiency of established routines and procedures. They are more concerned with following existing rules than with making changes to the organization. A transactional leader establishes and standardizes practices that will help the organization reach: *Maturity *Goal- setting *Efficiency of operation *Increasing productivity. Effect on work teams Survey done by Jun Liu, Xiaoyu Liu and Xianju Zeng on the correlation between transactional leadership and how innovations can be affected by team emotions. The research was composed of 90 work teams, with a total of 460 members and 90 team leaders. The study found that there is a relationship between emotions, labor behavior and transactional leadership that affects the team. Depending on the level of emotions of the team; this can affect the transactional leader in a positive or negative way. Transactional leaders work better in teams where there is a lower level of emotions going into the project. This is because individuals are able to: *Think freely when setting their emotions aside from their work. *Have all of their focus on the given task. A transactional leader is: #Negatively affected when the emotional level is high. #Positively affected when the emotional level is low. Transactional leadership presents a form of strategic leadership that is important for the organization's development. Transactional leadership is essential for team innovativeness. ==Transformational== Advocates of transformational leadership portray the transformational leader as a type of person not limited by followers' perception. The main objective is to work to change or transform their followers' needs and redirect their thinking. Leaders who follow the transformation style of leading, challenge and inspire their followers with a sense of purpose and excitement. Transformational leaders also create a vision of what they aspire to be, and communicate this idea to others (their followers). Schultz and Schultz identify three characteristics of a transformational leader: * Charismatic leadership has a broad field of knowledge, has a self-promoting personality, high/great energy level, and willing to take risk and use irregular strategies in order to stimulate their followers to think independently * Individualized consideration * Intellectual stimulation ==See also== * Narcissistic leadership * Management ** Management style * High-performance teams ==References Category:Leadership Category:Industrial and organizational psychology ","title":"Leadership style"},{"id":"35228764","text":"Shahidabad Rural District () may refer to: *Shahidabad Rural District (Fars Province) *Shahidabad Rural District (Mazandaran Province) *Shahidabad Rural District (Qazvin Province) ","title":"Shahidabad Rural District"},{"id":"35228765","text":"Mindset is the eleventh album by Australian improvised music trio The Necks first released on the Fish of Milk label in 2011 in Australia and on the ReR label internationally.Bandcamp: The Necks Mindset, accesssed January 16, 2019 Their first album to be released on vinyl, Mindset consists of two contrasting pieces titled \\"Rum Jungle\\" and \\"Daylights\\", the former propulsive and jangling and the latter more ambient in nature. ==Reception== Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, awarded the album a score of 78, based on 4 reviews which is considered as \\"Generally favorable\\".

It was the successor of the Syrian Federation (1922–1924) which had been created by providing a central assembly for the State of Aleppo, the State of Damascus and the Alawite State. The Alawite State did not join the State of Syria. == Background == In 1920, an independent Arab Kingdom of Syria was established under King Faisal of the Hashemite family, who later became the King of Iraq. However, his rule over Syria ended after only a few months, following the clash between his Syrian Arab forces and regular French forces at the Battle of Maysalun. French troops occupied Syria later that year after the League of Nations put Syria under French mandate. == History of Syria under the Mandate == Initial civil administration Following the San Remo conference and the defeat of King Faisal's short-lived monarchy in Syria at the Battle of Maysalun, the French general Henri Gouraud established civil administration in the territory. The mandate region was subdivided into six states. The drawing of those states was based in part on the sectarian make up on the ground in Syria. However, nearly all the Syrian sects were hostile to the French mandate and to the division it created. The primarily Sunni population of Aleppo and Damascus were strongly opposed to the division of Syria. Syrian Federation (1922–24) alt= Map showing the states of the French Mandate from 1921 to 1922 On 28 June 1922, the Syrian Federation was created between three of the states: the State of Damascus, the State of Aleppo and the Alawite State. Jabal Druze and Greater Lebanon were not parts of this federation. The autonomous Sanjak of Alexandretta was added to the state of Aleppo in 1923. The Federation adopted a new federal flag (green-white-green with French canton), which later became the flag of the State of Syria. State of Syria Arrete No 2980, which created the State of Syria, 5 December 1924 The Alawite state seceded from the federation in 1924. The states of Aleppo and Damascus were united into the State of Syria, with effect on 1 January 1925. General revolt In 1925, Syrian resistance to French colonial rule broke out in full scale revolt, led by Sultan Pasha el Atrash. The revolt broke out in Jabal Druze but quickly spread to other Syrian states and became a general rebellion in Syria. France tried to retaliate by having the parliament of Aleppo declare secession from the union with Damascus, but the voting was foiled by Syrian patriots. Despite French attempts to maintain control by encouraging sectarian divisions and isolating urban and rural areas, the revolt spread from the countryside and united Syrian Druze, Sunnis, Shiites, Alawis, and Christians. Once the rebel forces had besieged Damascus, the French military responded with brutal counter-insurgency techniques that prefigured those that would be used later in Algeria and Indo-China. These techniques included house demolitions, collective punishments of towns, executions, population transfers, and the use of heavy armor in urban neighborhoods. The revolt was eventually subdued in 1926-27 via French aerial bombardment of civilian areas, including Damascus.Michael Provence. The Great Syrian Revolt and the Rise of Arab Nationalism. University of Texas, Austin: University of Texas Press, 2005. Republic of Syria On May 14, 1930, the State of Syria was declared the Republic of Syria and a new constitution was drafted. ==Government== While the State enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy as a Mandate, France exercised significant authority over the government. The revolt that began in Jabal Druze led to France easing their hold on Syria and a constitution was drafted but not ratified by the French Chamber of Duties, and the coming of World War II stopped any progress in Syrian self-determination. Education Under French administration, the University of Damascus, known then as Syrian University was established in 1923, teaching in Arabic. It was the first university to be founded in Syria, being established through the merger of the School of Medicine and the Institute of Law, founded 1903 and 1913 respectively during the Ottoman era. == See also == *History of Syria *French Colonial Empire *List of French possessions and colonies == References  Bibliography == * * * == External links == *Timeline of the French Mandate period * Mandat Syrie-Liban ...

He served over 24 years as British consul in Oporto, Portugal. ==Career== Oswald John Frederick Crawfurd was born at Wilton Crescent, London, on 18 March 1834. He was the son of John Crawfurd, diplomat, and Horatia Ann Perry. He was educated at Eton College, he matriculated at Merton College, Oxford, in 1854, but left the university without a degree. In 1867 he became a clerk in the Foreign Office and was subsequently promoted to be H.M.'s consul at Oporto, Portugal. In 1873 Crawfurd founded the New Quarterly Magazine, which he sold to Francis Hueffer in 1877. He was awarded an Order of St Michael and St George in the 1890 New Year Honours. Crawfurd's last two years in Portugal were of exceptional difficulty. An ultimatum from Lord Salisbury in January 1890, the result of the occupation by Portuguese troops of British territory in East Africa, led to an outburst of anti-British feeling, more violent in Oporto than in other Portuguese towns. Crawfurd's house was stoned, but he carried on his duties till the trouble subsided, and then on 17 June 1891 he resigned and returned to England. Crawfurd become editor and director of Black and White, managing director of Chapman & Hall, and editor of Chapman's Magazine of Fiction from 1895 to 1898. He wrote 13 novels (of minor reputation) and contributed articles to the Fortnightly Review, Cornhill Magazine, Nineteenth Century, and the New Review. He died at Montreux, Switzerland on 31 January 1909. ==Family== Oswald Crawfurd was the youngest son and last (4th) child of John Crawfurd, who played an important role in the founding of Singapore. Oswald's first marriage was to Margaret 'Meta' Ford, the daughter of the writer Richard Ford, with whom he had one son who died in infancy. His first wife died in 1899. He remarried at the English church in Paris on 18 September 1902 to Lita Browne, daughter of Hermann von Flesch Brunnigen, an Imperial Counsellor at Vienna.Hermann von Flesch Brunnigen was also the father of Helena Regina Frederica von Flesch Brunnigen, who married Cecil Marcus Knatchbull-Hugessen, 4th Baron Brabourne. ==References Category:1834 births Category:1909 deaths Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Alumni of Merton College, Oxford Category:Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:English male journalists Category:English male novelists Category:19th-century English novelists Category:19th-century male writers Category:British expatriates in Portugal ","title":"Oswald Crawfurd"},{"id":"35228859","text":"Qaleh Hashem Rural District () is a rural district (dehestan) in Shal District, Buin Zahra County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

It is the third entry in the Bubsy franchise, which is preceded by Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind and Bubsy 2. The title itself is a word play in reference to Fractured Fairy Tales, a segment from the animated television series The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends. When all of the fairy tales suddenly become corrupted, Bubsy is now tasked on venturing through Fairytaleland and fixing them in order to protect all of the children in the world from these altered stories. Originally planned and advertised to be a port of the first entry in the series as part of a deal with Accolade for the Jaguar, Bubsy in: Fractured Furry Tales later became its own original title during development, while retaining all the gameplay elements from the original game. Bubsy in: Fractured Furry Tales received mixed reception since its release. While some critics praised the game's graphics, music and difficulty, others panned the controls, camera, level design, voice acting and personality of the main character. Reviewers also criticized the game for its lack of use of the hardware and compared it to the previous 16-bit iterations. By April 1, 1995, the game has sold less than 9,000 copies though it is unknown how many were sold in total during its lifetime. The series continued with Bubsy 3D, which was released in 1996 for the PlayStation. Retrospective reviews for the title have been equally mixed in recent years. == Gameplay == Bubsy is about to turn the signal light post from green to red during the game's first level. Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales is a side-scrolling platform game in which the players take control of Bubsy, the game's protagonist, across five worlds comprising three levels each that are themed after well-known fairy tales that have been corrupted such as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Jack and the Beanstalk, Ali Baba, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and Hansel and Gretel to restore them back into their original state. Although it plays very similarly to the previous two entries in the series, the game has more emphasis towards puzzle elements in order to progress through the levels themselves and it closely follows the design and mechanics from the original title. While it has a password feature that allows players to resume their last progress, the cartridge's internal EEPROM only saves high scores and other settings made by them. The game also has a two-player option which allows two players to play the game by alternating turns with either one or two controllers. The player must maneuver Bubsy through the levels by jumping and gliding, while also collecting objects scattered across the levels that grant points, now called Bubsy Balls instead of the orbs and yarn balls from previous titles and when 500 are collected, an extra life is granted and more lives can be earned by collecting numbered t-shirts. Players start off with nine lives at the beginning of the game, which are lost if Bubsy comes into contact with an enemy or an enemy attack, falls into either a spiked pit, a body of water or from heights without gliding, gets crushed, or running out of time and once all lives are lost the game is over, though players can keep playing from the last level they died by finding a continue item. Bubsy can only take one hit before losing a life, instead of three hits as in Bubsy 2. Another omission from the second game is the Nerf gun, which leaves Bubsy without any other means of facing against enemies and bosses besides jumping on them. Some of the enemies and bosses in the game are themed after their respective levels representing one of the five fairy tales and when killed, enemies do not respawn on the level, even after the player loses a life. Unlike the second game where players could choose stages, stage progression on Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales is instead linear. Other returning elements from the first game are crates containing objects that either benefit or harm players, invincibility t-shirts that render Bubsy immune to enemy contact and attacks but not from environmental hazards, checkpoints that let players restart at the last location reached after dying, among others. New to the game are signal light posts placed at a fixed position on the level, which act as switches to deactivate spiked doors that block a section of the level if they are colored red and when colored green the doors open, allowing players to progress further through the stage. Also returning from both the first and second title are doors that warp Bubsy into another section of the level or a hidden room. == Plot == The fairy tales on the world have suddenly become altered after Mother Goose, who maintained peace and balance throughout them on Fairytaleland, was captured by both Hansel and Gretel, leading to the appearance of creatures that corrupted these stories. As a result, Bubsy sets out to stop the creatures and antagonists of the now-altered stories in order to protect the kids from their current state.Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales game manual (Atari Jaguar, US) After Bubsy defeats both Hansel and Gretel as well as freeing Mother Goose from her captivity, all of the stories in Fairytaleland revert to normal and the creatures disappear afterwards, with Bubsy deciding on what is next for him. == Development and release == In November 1993, Accolade signed an agreement with Atari Corporation to be a third-party developer for the Jaguar and licensed five titles from their catalog to Atari Corp. in order to be converted and release them to the system: Barkley Shut Up and Jam!, Brett Hull Hockey, Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind, HardBall III and Jack Nicklaus' Power Challenge Golf (later renamed Jack Nicklaus Cyber Golf). The original intended idea was to port the first Bubsy title to the Jaguar, with magazines advertising it as such. According to producer Faran Thomason however, it was decided to create an original title in the series while using the source code from the first game as a base at one point during development. Some of the enemies were created by artist Shaun McClure at Imagitec. Mark Hooley was responsible for designing some of the levels in the game. Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales was showcased in a playable state at SCES '94. It was the only title out of the five games from the Atari-Accolade deal that was released for the system. == Reception == Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales received largely mixed reviews. The scores given by Electronic Gaming Monthlys five editors averaged to a modest 6.4/10, but reviewer Mike Weigand (who gave it a 7) lauded the game, commenting that \\"Bubsy fans will love this version of the popular character, and this one will prove challenging to even the most hardened veterans of the series. The levels are huge, the graphics are very detailed and the sound is equally impressive.\\" GamePro commented that \\"Bubsy offers a muddled mix of good and bad ingredients\\", citing colorful graphics but jerky animation, good music but raspy sound effects, inconsistent control responsiveness, and fickle collision detection. Next Generation said it has colorful and visually pleasing graphics but generic gameplay, and concluded, \\"Not a bad title, but platform fans will probably find Zool 2 a little more entertaining and a lot more innovative.\\" In a retrospective review, IGN stated that while the fairy tale theme worked, the game's attitude felt very forced, the extras and improvements from Bubsy 2 had been dropped, and that the game overall felt like \\"one giant step sideways\\". Atari HQ was equally critical of the game, citing a frustrating combination of sloppy controls and high difficulty, and suggesting Jaguar owners buy the original Rayman instead, due to better graphics and sound. Many reviews found the game to be too close to the previous installments of the games in the Bubsy series, which were not rated very well either. Additionally, several reviewers found the graphics to be impressive by Super NES standards, but not necessarily for a system that was advertised to be more advanced. The Atari Times, however, gave the game 70%, complimenting the graphics and music, though criticizing the animation and control. Electric Escape was also positive of the game as they gave it 7 out of 10, and stated \\"Enthusiasts of the first Bubsy adventure and of platformers in general will find this a decent title to add to their collection.\\" Oldies Rising scored it 15 out of 20, stating that while the game does not show the qualities of a 64-bit system, pleasure can still be found in it. The book Inside Electronic Game Design by Arnie Katz tells that 50,000 copies were sold the first 6 months of release, with only 60,000 being produced. == Notes  References  External links == * Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales at AtariAge * Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales at GameFAQs * Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales at Giant Bomb * Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales at MobyGames Category:1994 video games Category:Accolade games Category:Atari games Category:Atari Jaguar games Category:Atari Jaguar-only games Category:Bubsy Category:Imagitec Design games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Platform games Category:Side-scrolling platform games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games featuring female antagonists Category:Video games scored by Alastair Lindsay Category:Video games scored by Kevin Saville ","title":"Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales"},{"id":"35228875","text":"Robert Degos Robert Degos (1904–1987) was a French dermatologist who described several dermatoses including Degos disease which he first described in a seminal paper published in 1942 in the French journal of dermatology and syphilology.

In addition, most major oratorios and choral works as well as a variety of a cappella pieces are part of the choir's repertoire. Major works are regularly performed in the Marktkirche, Wiesbaden, and in Eberbach Abbey. The orchestra is the Bach Ensemble Wiesbaden, formed by leading musicians of orchestras in the Rhine-Main area. Works of Viennese Classicism and Romanticism are presented in historically informed performance. Since 2004, the choir has been part of a project to perform all Bach sacred cantatas as part of monthly services, introduced by a lecture.

Thirteen Martyrs Burned At Stratford-Le-Bow Foxe lists those executed: Henry Adlington, a sawyer of Grinstead, Laurence Pernam, a smith of Hoddesdon, Henry Wye, a brewer of Stanford-le-Hope, William Halliwel, a smith of Waltham Holy Cross, Thomas Bowyer, a weaver of Great Dunmow, George Searles, a tailor of White Notley, Edmund Hurst, a labourer of Colchester, Lyon Cawch, a Flemish merchant of the City of London, Ralph Jackson, a servant of Chipping Ongar, John Derifall, a labourer of Rettendon, John Routh, a labourer of Wix, Elizabeth Pepper of Colchester who was pregnant, and Agnes George of West Bergholt. A further three men, Thomas Freeman, William Stannard, and William Adams, were given a dispensation by Cardinal Pole, the Archbishop of Canterbury, because they had recanted although Foxe is dubious about that. The 16 accused had been brought to Newgate in London from various parts of Essex and Hertfordshire. Beginning on 6 June 1556, at an ecclesiastical tribunal under the direction of Thomas Darbyshire, the chancellor of Edmund Bonner the Bishop of London, they were charged with nine counts of heresy, to which they all either assented or remained silent. All of them were condemned to death and later published a letter detailing their beliefs in rebuttal of a sermon that had been preached against them by John Feckenham, the Dean of St Paul's. On 27 June 1556, the remaining 13 were brought from London to Stratford, where the party was divided into two and held \\"in several chambers\\". Here, the sheriff unsuccessfully attempted to persuade each group to recant, by telling them falsely that the other group had already done so.Oxley 1965, p. 225 ==Execution== The executions were said to have been attended by a crowd of 20,000. The exact place of the execution is unknown; the most likely site is thought to have been Fair Field in Bow (then known as Stratford-le-Bow), north of the present day Bow Church DLR station.London Remembers – Monument: Stratford Martyrs An alternative suggested location is Stratford Green, much of which is now occupied by the University of East London Stratford Campus. This theory seems to date only from the erection of a monument to the martyrs in the nearby churchyard of the Parish Church of St John the Evangelist in 1879.St John's Church, Stratford E15: The Martyrs Memorial According to Foxe, \\"eleven men were tied to three stakes, and the two women loose in the midst without any stake; and so they were all burnt in one fire\\". ==Martyrs' Memorial== The Martyrs' Memorial in Stratford (with St John the Baptist Church in the background) In 1879 a large monument was erected in St John's churchyard in Stratford Broadway, to commemorate the 13 and others who were executed or tortured in Stratford during the persecutions.

She was supposed to be the first Saudi female athlete to compete at the Summer Olympics. When she rode at the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010, she was amongst a high-profile group of speakers who addressed the recent International Olympic Committee Women and Sport conference in Los Angeles. The 20-year-old, who won individual bronze in Singapore, spoke of her hope of gender equality in all sports. ==Biography== Dalma Rushdi Malhas was born in Ohio in 1992. She speaks English, French as well as her native tongue, Arabic. At the age of four, Dalma began riding horses. At the age of 12, she traveled to Rome where she started to compete in more advanced competitions under the supervision of Duccio Bartalucci, a former coach for the national Olympic show jumping team of Italy. She then went to France and trained there at the Forsan Equestrian Centre in Chantilly. After participating in several competitions abroad, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) became aware of Malhas. Due to the fact that each country has to field a minimum of one woman in the mandatory quota set by the IOC in order for a nation to take part in the Games, the IOC invited Malhas to represent Saudi Arabia, although her links with that country are not strong. When interviewed during the Youth Olympics in Singapore in 2010, she admitted: \\"I didn’t care much about me being there as a representative of Saudi Arabia, because anyone could probably do that. But getting a medal was the key, and that’s not easy for anyone, and I wanted that — and only that gives recognition to my country\\". Malhas was set to compete at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. It would have been the first time a woman had represented Saudi Arabia at an Olympic Games and she would have been the only female Saudi athlete to have competed in any Olympic sport. However, Malhas was disqualified from the Games in late June for failing to meet minimum eligibility standards, according to the International Equestrian Federation. ==References== Category:Equestrians at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics Category:Saudi Arabian female equestrians Category:Living people Category:1992 births ","title":"Dalma Malhas"},{"id":"35229201","text":"Hesar-e Valiyeasr (, also Romanized as Heṣār-e Valīyeʿaṣr) is a village in Hesar-e Valiyeasr Rural District, Central District, Avaj County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

His first biography, that of Savarkar, was first published in 1950. Later he wrote biographies of Ambedkar and Tilak. Resigning from his job, he wrote biographies of Phule, Shahu and Gandhi.

The cave entrance lies about 285 feet above the River Wye on a hill, with a double interconnected entrance and two main chambers. It is protected as a nature reserve under the Herefordshire Nature Trust. There is evidence that the cave was occupied by man during the Upper Palaeolithic era, and flint tools and woolly mammoth bones have been unearthed within and around the caves. ==Background== It is uncertain exactly how the cave got its name. A skeleton of a \\"giant human\\" was supposedly discovered in the cave around 1700, but was lost when a local surgeon named Mr. Pye took the skeleton to sea on a voyage to Jamaica and his ship sank. The cave is shrouded in local superstition and is believed to have had a part in the early legend of King Vortigern, a native British king who fought against the invading Anglo Saxons. Vortigern is said to have made his last stand against Aurelius at nearby Ganarew. Lawman mentions a castle on Cloard Hill in the district of Hergin, and has Vortigern dying after the castle was besieged and fired by Aurelius and Uther.\\"Caer Guorthegirn\\", by Robert Vermaat, at vortigernstudies.org.uk Helen Hill Miller, in her 1969 book The Realms of Arthur, suggests a military use for the cave, arguing that the cave's \\"recesses penetrate very far into the hill, and could hide a substantial force\\". The cave has a parallel with Cadbury Castle in that it is a cave within a hillfort. ==Excavations== In 1871 the caves were excavated by Reverend William S. Symonds, after he learned that some miners had raided them. He unearthed hyena, lion, brown bear, red deer, rhinoceros, Irish Elk, reindeer, and horse bones dated to the Late Pleistocene. The evidence of hyena was particularly prominent and many of the bones showed signs of being crunched by them. He also found flint implements from the Upper Palaeolithic and fragments of Neolithic pottery. Members of the Cotswold Naturalists' Field Club also explored the caves, under the supervision of the Reverend Symonds, which led to further remarkable discoveries. They initially inspected one of the Doward caves, situated about 200 yards from King Arthur's Cave: Between 1925 and 1927 the University of Bristol Spelæological Society (UBSS) excavated here, and in 1926 Garrod dated his findings in the upper cave to the Upper Palaeolithic and those from the lower cave to the Middle Palaeolithic. The society returned in 1955 but found nothing new. In 1989, the caves and the Upper Wye Gorge of some 1.5 hectares (3.7 acres) was designated a SSSI. ==Structure== The cave is said to \\"consist of a broad entrance platform, a double interconnected entrance and two main chambers\\", about 300 feet above the River Wye. One of the chambers is large and circular in shape, about 25 feet in diameter. The main chambers obtained the names Bear's Den and Lion's Cave due to the paleontological items found there. There are also several other open rooms to the cave. ==References== : ==External links== *UBSS catalogue of King Arthur's Cave *Video Category:Caves of Herefordshire Category:Locations associated with Arthurian legend ","title":"King Arthur's Cave"},{"id":"35229661","text":"Fred Rogers (born 17 April 1910) was an English footballer who played as a defender for Liverpool in the Football League.

Pope was born in Fürth, Bavaria and immigrated to the United States as a teenager. He went to school at the Art Institute of Chicago where he was influenced in the Prairie School architectural style. In 1910, he opened an architectural firm with Harold W. Burton (Pope & Burton) in Salt Lake City, Utah. Pope designed a variety of places of worship for many faiths, civic buildings and homes, some of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ==Temple architecture== As young architects, Pope & Burton won design competitions for two of their most well-known works, the Cardston Alberta and Laie Hawaii temples for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).http://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp- content/uploads/articles/Dialogue_V14N01_11.pdf Later on he became Chairman of the Board of Temple Architects for the church and oversaw the design and construction of the Idaho Falls Idaho and Los Angeles California temples. At the dedication proceedings of the Cardston Alberta Temple, Pope remarked that temple architecture \\"should be ancient as well as modern. It should express all the power which we associate with God.\\" ==Personal life== Pope married Eliza Rutishauser. His son Theodore Pope also became an architect. Pope died unexpectedly of an apparent heart attack in Preston, Idaho in 1939 while inspecting the construction of the Franklin County Courthouse. With .

It can grow to a length of about . The skin is smooth with a scattering of small warts. The male has a large gland at the back of his fore legs which becomes enlarged in the breeding season. The front foot has four toes and the back foot has five with deeply indented webbing between them. The hind legs are short and at the back of each hind foot is a yellowish bony protuberance, the inner metatarsal tubercle or spade, that gives the animal its name. The colour of the frog is quite variable, the back often being pale grey with large, greenish, irregularly shaped blotches and the belly being pale grey. The eastern spadefoot can be distinguished from the western spadefoot (Pelobates cultripes) by the colour of the spade which is black in the latter, and from the common spadefoot (Pelobates fuscus) by the fact that its head is not domed.Pelobates syriacus AmphibiaWeb. Retrieved March 25, 2012. ==Distribution and habitat== The eastern spadefoot is native to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, Macedonia, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Syria and Turkey. It is quite common in Iran but is uncommon over much of its range. It is thought to be extinct in Jordan and its status is unclear in Albania, Iraq, Moldova and Ukraine. It lives in light woodland, bushy and semi-desert areas, badlands, arable fields and dunes. It prefers loose soil where it can use its spades to dig the burrow in which it lives, but is also found in rocky areas and pebbly clay soils. The range of eastern spadefoot is limited by mean annual temperature and rainfall (the species does not live in the areas with insufficient summer temperature and in areas with a high rainfall level), but the northern distribution limit may additionally depend on the distribution of common spadefoot. Because the species has large tadpoles, the distribution is additionally limited by presence of sufficiently large but fishless ponds. ==Voice== The eastern spadefoot has a distinctive call, usually emitted from underwater and often continuing all night. It is a rapid, staccato \\"clock...clock...clock\\" that is audible from some way away. ==Biology== Frogspawn (eggs) of the eastern spadefoot, Rehovot Vernal pool, Israel Close up of a several days old frogspawn (eggs) of the eastern spadefoot Rehovot Vernal pool, Israel The eastern spadefoot is nocturnal and returns to the same lair each night when it has finished foraging for molluscs, spiders, insects and other small arthropods. As well as digging its own burrow, it sometimes makes use of a rodent hole or a crevice under a rock. At times when the air temperature is very hot it retires to the deepest part of its burrow and may aestivate in mid-summer. At these times the toads that live in the moist soil of riverbanks may fare better than those elsewhere and in times of drought, there may be a high mortality rate among toads. In the winter it hibernates among tree roots or under rocks, sometimes several toads huddling together. Breeding takes place from February to May depending on location. Ditches and stagnant pools are favoured locations for amplexus. Several thousand eggs are laid in broad bands of gelatinous material that may be thick and long. The tadpoles hatch after three days, eat algae and water weeds and grow for three or four months before they undergo metamorphosis into juvenile toads. Many of these burrow into the mud at the edge of ponds to overwinter but some may overwinter as tadpoles. ==Status== The eastern spadefoot is considered of \\"Least concern\\" by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The chief threat it faces is habitat loss due to changes in land use and the drainage of areas in which it breeds. It has a wide distribution and is believed to have a large population, so, although its range is rather fragmented, it is thought to be declining sufficiently slowly as to not need to be listed in a more threatened category. However, some of its separate populations are susceptible to local extinction due to adverse conditions, especially in arid areas. ==References== Category:Pelobates Category:Amphibians of Europe Category:Amphibians of Asia Category:Amphibians of the Middle East Category:Amphibians described in 1889 ","title":"Pelobates syriacus"},{"id":"35229943","text":"During the 2009–10 season Cowdenbeath competed in the Scottish Second Division, Scottish Cup, Scottish League Cup and the Challenge Cup. ==Summary== Cowdenbeath finished third in the First Division, entering the play-offs winning 3–0 over Brechin on aggregate and were promoted to the First Division.

It is compiled from several of Gilliam's works from the late 1960s and early 1970s, and stylistically resembles the distinctive animations which Gilliam produced in that period for Monty Python's Flying Circus. Story Time is composed of three loosely connected animated segments. The first two, \\"Don the Cockroach\\" and \\"The Albert Einstein Story\\", were originally broadcast in the 1971–1972 TV series The Marty Feldman Comedy Machine, while the third, \\"The Christmas Card\\", was created for the 1968 Christmas Special of Do Not Adjust Your Set. The film was included on the 2001 DVD release of Jabberwocky as a bonus feature. It was also shown as an accompaniment to some British theatrical releases of Monty Python's Life of Brian. ==Plot== The film begins with an animated version of director Terry Gilliam reading from a children's storybook. The story, \\"Don the Cockroach\\", opens with a palace high atop a mountain. Inside the wall of one of its rooms lives a cheerful cockroach named Don, who is shown frolicking and generally enjoying his life as a cockroach. One day, as Don scurries across a kitchen floor, he is suddenly crushed by a foot. The narrator Gilliam remarks that this does not matter, as cockroaches are not very interesting. The story then shifts to the man who crushed Don, then to his brother, then to the brother's friend, then to the friend's employer, and so forth. Eventually the chain of interconnected people reaches a cleaning lady who is involved in a search-and- destroy mission against a colony of cockroaches, one of whom is named Don. The film then loops back to Don, replaying some of the earlier events until a gruff voice interrupts the narrator with \\"You already said that!\\" and the sound of a punch. An intertitle appears, announcing that the animator responsible for the previous cartoon has been sacked, and promising that the next one will be better. The next segment, entitled \\"The Albert Einstein Story\\", revolves around an English man who happens to share the name of the famous physicist, and is \\"quite interesting in his own right\\". The new narrator says that Einstein is very good with his hands, and that his hands are very good to him. However, they once stayed out late at night, carousing, misbehaving, and even cheating on their owner by shaking other hands. One of the hands was once seen out with a foot, causing a scandal in the upper-class society of hands, who were prejudiced against feet. The film then cuts to a musical extravaganza starring \\"Fred & Frank Feet & Their Dancing Body\\". The curtains draw to a close with the sound of a jeering audience, and the words \\"The End – Yours truly, Terry Gilliam\\" appear. Next the film cuts to a segment entitled \\"The Christmas Card\\", set on Christmas Day in 1968 London. A lonely old man receives a Christmas card in the post. A series of Christmas cards are then shown coming to life in bizarre ways, connected only by the Three Wise Men, who follow the Star of Bethlehem from one card to another. Suddenly the postman returns and takes the card back, apologising for delivering it to the wrong address. ==External links== * *Storytime on YouTube ==References== Category:1970s comedy films Category:1979 short films Category:Animated comedy films Category:British animated short films Category:British Christmas films Category:British comedy films Category:British films Category:British short films Category:Short films directed by Terry Gilliam Category:Cutout animation films Category:Films with screenplays by Terry Gilliam Category:Comedy short films ","title":"Story Time (film)"},{"id":"35230046","text":"Jarl Anders Lennart Borssén (14 March 1937 - 21 December 2012) was a Swedish actor and comedian.

The township is located about five kilometres away from the East London city business district (CBD). Duncan Village is divided into six wards, with each headed by a ward councillor. There are no clear divisions between the informal and formal parts of the township since most shacks are planted on the open spaces within formal houses. ==History== The township of Duncan Village was founded in 1941. It was named after the then Governor of East London, Patrick Duncan, who oversaw the opening of what was called a \\"leasehold tenure area\\" in the East Bank location. The township was created to solve a housing crisis in East London during the late 1930s and early 1940s. The decision to establish Duncan Village was based on the recommendations of the Thornton Commission of 1937, which was put in place to solve overcrowding in East Bank, East London. The commission recommended the building of an entirely new location on a new site, the utilisation of East Bank and that all the wood and iron dwellings in the East Bank be demolished and replaced with houses built \\"on town planning lines\\". The response of the East London Municipality to the commission's recommendations was to build Duncan Village in 1941. By 1944, 628 houses had been completed in the new township. Contrary to the Thornton Commission's recommendations, the shacks were not demolished in East Bank. The first residents in Duncan Village were black African migrant workers from the rural areas surrounding East London and a small group of black Africans who regarded themselves as fully urbanised East London residents with no links to the rural areas. Hygiene proved to be a problem in Duncan Village, largely because the government was struggling to maintain the streets and sanitation. The township was dealing with a serious case of tuberculosis in the 1940s. In 1949 every third child born in the location died from the disease. To deal with the issue of overcrowding and poor hygiene in the township and surrounding areas, the East London Municipality created Mdantsane in 1962. Between 1964 and 1983, 80 000 people were moved from Duncan Village to Mdantsane. In 1985, the East London Municipality launched a plan to improve Duncan Village into a middle-class neighbourhood. This proved unsuccessful as the state could not move the 15,000 shacks which were in the area at the time. In describing the government's attempt to move residents from Duncan Village to Mdantsane, one of the councillors interviewed by Patricia Ndhlovu for her research paper titled Understanding the local state, service delivery and protests in post-Apartheid South Africa: The case of Duncan Village and Bcmm, East London said, \\"For us it was an 'anti-removal struggle', we were supposed to be removed from this place in 1985; they made it worse in 1985. There was a call from the ANC abroad that we were following to render the country 'ungovernable', and apartheid 'unworkable' and we started with anti-removals because we were supposed to be moved to Mdantsane. We resisted but at a cost, we lost over 30 people and had massive funerals in 1985.\\" During the 1990s and early 2000s Duncan Village residents received houses in the Reeston area. This failed to combat the increasing number of shackdwellers from the surrounding rural areas. ==Duncan Village during apartheid== On 9 November 1952, 1500 residents of East London's locations attended a mass meeting at Bantu Square in Duncan Village. The residents gathered in support of the African National Congress' 1952 Defiance Campaign. But the 9 November meeting followed in the wake of rioting in Kimberley and Port Elizabeth, a ban on gatherings and the restriction of 52 Eastern Cape leaders in terms of the Riotous Assemblies and Suppression of Communism Acts. The ANC Youth League President, Skei Gwentshe, himself restricted, obtained permission from the chief magistrate and the district commandant for a prayer meeting to protest the bannings. Police were monitoring the meeting. As soon as the meeting ended, the police dispersed the crowd, the crowd retaliated. A battle between the residents and the police ensued. An Afrikaner salesman and an Irish nun, named Doctor Quinlan, were killed in the unrest. Doctor Quinlan (also known as Sister Aidan), who had set up the St Peter Claver mission hospital in East London, was stoned to death and burnt beyond recognition. According to newspaper reports, there nine people died, including seven black Africans from Duncan Village, and 27 reported injured. However, according to D. Card, an interviewee on Lungisile Ntsebeza's Masters research paper titled 'YOUTH IN URBAN AFRICAN TOWNSHIPS, 1945· 1992 A CASE STUDY OF THE EAST LONDON TOWNSHIPS, about 200 people were shot by the police. In his words, Card said: \\"Newspapers carried out that only nine people were shot, but from the removal of bodies we established that there were round about 200 people shot.\\" No police were injured during the riots. Within 10 days, 150 Africans were arrested for pass offences. Fifteen were charged with the murder of Dr Quinlan, five convicted of murder and two hanged. On 11 August 1985, Duncan Village was again the scene of violence, following the funeral of murdered UDF leader Victoria Mxenge in Rayi village. Returning mourners carried out arson attacks, and violence continued on the following days. All six community councillors' homes were burnt down and homes of police officers and suspected collaborators were also attacked. 19 people died and 138 were injured. On 28 March 2008, former South African President Thabo Mbeki unveiled the Duncan Village Massacre Memorial in honour of the victims of the 1985 massacre near the Duncan Village Cemetery. ==References * Official website of Buffalo City * Youth in urban African townships,1945·1992:A Case Study of the East London Townships * Village and Ikhayalethu – Our Home Category:Populated places in Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality Category:Townships in the Eastern Cape ","title":"Duncan Village"},{"id":"35230126","text":"Dazzle Vision was a Japanese rock band. They appeared at Sakura-Con in 2010. After playing in Taiwan in 2006, Dazzle Vision released their first album Origin of Dazzle. They were well known for their heavy rock sound and female vocalist Maiko's alternating melodic/death-voice vocals. The band announced their disbandment in April 2015. ==History== Formation Dazzle Vision formed in 2003. The two main founders of Dazzle Vision are brother and sister, Maiko and Takuro. Up until 2010, Dazzle Vision did not maintain a steady line- up, changing the drummer and several guitarists. Because of the line up changes, Dazzle Vision has managed to continue on with their work. Past members of the band are Natu (Dr.) (2003-2004), Tan (Gui.) (2003-2006), Ryu (Gui.) (2006-2008), and Yu (Gui.) (2008-2010). As of 2010 the main band members consisted of Maiko (vocals), Takuro (bass), John (guitar), and Haru (drums). ==Influences, Concepts, and Musical Styles== Maiko and Takuro began the band as an outlet for creation which is a part of the band's concept. The entire concept of the band was \\"Children Create The World\\" and was also a part of their logo. Drawing on outside sources Dazzle Vision grew its style. While basic influences from Western culture have impacted the band, several famous bands such as Evanescence, Black Sabbath, and Metallica have shaped the sound and style of Dazzle Vision. While the band self-described themselves as Screamo-Pop, they branched out into many different music genres such as alternative metal, hard rock, melodic death metal, progressive rock, glam metal, pop, post-hardcore, screamo and forerunners of kawaii metal. The band's albums each have a new distinct sound different from the last. Among the Japanese alternative scene, Dazzle Vision made an impact, mixing their strong vocals, dark riffs, and powerhouse screamo rants. ==Discography== Albums Dazzle Vision produced seven albums.

He was noted for his devout Roman Catholic beliefs and his strong support for the Irish Catholic political cause; this led him during the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and the ensuing Civil Wars to play a double game, offering support to both the Crown and the rebels, with the result that no party to the conflict fully trusted him. He was charged with treason by the Government of Charles I and his estates were forfeited by Oliver Cromwell, but he died in his English exile of natural causes. ==Background and early career== He was born at Dowth in Meath, eldest son of Nicholas Netterville, 1st Viscount Netterville and his first wife Eleanor Bathe, daughter of Sir John Bathe of Drumcondra, Dublin.Burke's Extinct Peerages 1978 Reprint p.392 His father was a favourite of James I who ennobled him in 1622 \\"in consideration of his good qualities\\". In time Nicholas like his son was to be accused of disloyalty to the English Crown- in both cases their aim seems to have been the desire to restore the Roman Catholic faith (two of Nicholas' younger sons were Jesuits).Bagwell, Richard \\"John Netterville\\" Dictionary of National Biography 1885-1900 vol. 40 p.237 In 1623 John married Lady Elizabeth Weston, daughter of Richard Weston, 1st Earl of Portland, the future Lord Treasurer, and his first wife Elizabeth Pinchion.Bagwell, p.236 The marriage gave him influence at the English Court and a useful ally in promoting toleration of Catholics, since Portland himself was a convert to the Catholic faith. In November 1632, shortly after the appointment of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford as Lord Deputy of Ireland, John and other prominent Catholics petitioned him not to enforce the Penal Laws.Bagwell, p.236 ==Rebellion and Civil War== On the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, John, with a troop of 100 men was sent to assist Viscount Moore in holding Drogheda, but he was suspected of inciting the population to join the rebellion, and was forced to withdraw to his own house.Bagwell, p.236 For the next few months he and his father both followed a devious course, professing loyalty to the Crown while offering covert support to the rebels. In February 1642 the Irish House of Commons ordered that John be removed from command of his troops. John, wishing to reach an accommodation with his opponents, approached the Marquess of Ormonde who arrested him and sent him to Dublin. The Crown's legal advice was that a clear case for treason had been made out against John, but that no Meath jury would convict him, so that if possible he should be tried in Dublin. His trial finally opened in February 1643, but the King and Ormonde now hoped for his support; the trial did not proceed and he was released in April.Bagwell, p.237 Immediately after his release he joined the army of the Irish Confederacy under Preston. He was still campaigning in 1650, by which time he had only about six men left.Bagwell, p.237 ==Last years and death== Under the Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 John and his father were both exempted from pardon for their lives and estates, but do not seem to have suffered any actual ill-treatment. John moved to England where his wife argued successfully that as an English subject she was entitled to enjoy part of the Netterville property. There seems to have been enough for John to live on even after his wife's death in 1656. He succeeded to the title in 1654, but was still in England when he died in September 1659. He was buried beside his wife in St Giles in the Fields.Bagwell, p.237 ==Family== He and Elizabeth had eleven children:Burke's Extinct Peerages p.614 *Nicholas Nettterville, 3rd Viscount Netterville *Jerome, who became a priest *James, an army officer *Richard *Lucas *Patrick *Robert *Mary, who married Henry Barnewall, 2nd Viscount Barnewall *Margaret, who married William Archbold *Frances *Eleanor. ==References== Category:Viscounts in the Peerage of Ireland Category:People from County Meath Category:1659 deaths Category:17th-century Irish people Category:People of the Irish Confederate Wars Category:Year of birth uncertain ","title":"John Netterville, 2nd Viscount Netterville"},{"id":"35230251","text":"Clare Wren (born May 4, 1962 as Helen Claire Wren) is an American actress.

The town was originally called Scotch Settlement. The founding families were headed by George Torrey, his son Dougald Torrey, Laughlin Currie and Robert Willis. ==Scottish Family Names== The heavy Scottish influence is evident in the early member roles of the Presbyterian Church established there: McArn, McArthur, McBride, McCall, McCallum, McCure, McClutchie, McCormick, McCorvey, McDonald, McDougald, McDuffie, McEachern, McFatter, McIntyre, McLaurin, McLean, McMillen, McMurchie, McNair, McPherson, McQueen, Galbreath, and McRae. Many of these names can be found today on headstones in the Union Church Cemetery. ==Churches== The community's name bears witness to its history as a \\"union\\" of two church congregations. While most of the earliest settlers were Presbyterians, there were a few Methodist families, who, lacking resources to start their own church, worshipped in union with the Presbyterians. There are a number of small country churches in and around Union Church proper, but below are a few of the key congregations in the community's history. Union Church Presbyterian Church The Presbyterian Church, the third oldest Presbyterian church in the state of Mississippi, was formally organized on March 2, 1817 by Reverend Joseph Bullen, although he began preaching to the community around 1810 or 1811. The first church building was a small log house located about 3 miles from the current church building, on the property of the Buie family, who were founding members of both the church and the town. Some years later, an old Irishman, having no descendants, donated 100 acres to his church, on which the second building was erected. When the congregation outgrew this building, the present sanctuary was built and dedicated by Reverend Angus McCallum in 1852, and the Presbyterians worship there to this day. Hickory Block United Methodist Church Hickory Block is the oldest African American church in the community, believed to have been founded shortly after the close of the Civil War. Prior to that time, many of its members were baptized into the faith to become members in full communion with the Presbyterian Church. There were two services held at the Presbyterian Church on Sundays; a morning service for the white members, and an afternoon service for the servants. Presbyterian Church membership records list by name a number of the \\"servants\\" of white church members, baptized into membership between the years 1827 and 1864. Many of the names recorded in those rolls can be found on headstones in the Hickory Block cemetery today. Hickory Block still has an actively worshiping congregation today. It is likely that after receiving emancipation, the black members chose to form their own congregation at Hickory Block. Galatia United Methodist Church Galatia Methodist Church was established in 1859. The Methodists worshiped in the original wooden structure until 2003, when the congregation was officially dissolved due to declining membership. Union Church Baptist Church The Baptist Church was established in 1922, in its original white wooden structure. A new building was erected nearby in 1995, where an active congregation still worships. ==Education== In its heyday, Union Church had a grammar school along with an agricultural high school, complete with dormitories, which housed students from mostly nearby communities. The school was established in 1910 and had a working dairy, and an agriculture/shop building. One of the dormitories and the main school building burned. The main school building was reconstructed and burned again prior to its closing in 1955. Part of the school land was acquired by the Presbyterian Church, along with the cafeteria/auditorium, which was used by the community for meetings, etc. In the early 1970s the cafeteria/auditorium was burned by a vagrant who had stayed the night in the auditorium, and started a fire on the heart pine floor in an attempt to warm himself before moving on. The only school building currently remaining was purchased, along with 20 acres, by a native resident and a 1953 graduate of Union Church High School, W.H. \\"Billy\\" Covington. He purchased the agriculture building and the remaining dormitory in March 1959, soon after his marriage to Veta Smith Covington. They razed the remaining dormitory, using the material to build two houses in the local area, and remodeled the agriculture structure into a Greek Revival/Colonial style home in 1971, where they reared four sons, and currently reside there today. ==Civil War== On April 28, 1863, Grierson's Raid was checked in a skirmish at Union Church. ==Notes== Category:Unincorporated communities in Jefferson County, Mississippi Category:Unincorporated communities in Mississippi Category:Scotch-Irish American history ","title":"Union Church, Mississippi"},{"id":"35230478","text":"Asyan (, also Romanized as Āsyān, Āsīān, and Asīyan) is a village in Abgarm Rural District, Abgarm District, Avaj County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

The Spartans were led by third year head coach Mike MacIntyre and played their home games at Spartan Stadium. They were members of the Western Athletic Conference. This was the Spartans' final season as members of the WAC. They joined the Mountain West Conference on July 1, 2013. They finished the season 11–2, 5–1 in WAC play to finish in second place. They were invited to the Military Bowl where they defeated Bowling Green. Head coach Mike MacIntyre resigned at the end of the regular season to take the head coach position at Colorado. Defensive coordinator Kent Baer was the Spartans' interim head coach for the Military Bowl. San Diego head coach Ron Caragher was hired as the Spartans new head coach beginning in 2013. ==Personnel== Coaching staff Head coach Mike MacIntyre returned for his third season with San Jose State. Under MacIntyre, San Jose State went 1-12 in its 2010 season and improved to 5-7 in 2011. On December 10, the University of Colorado at Boulder hired MacIntyre to be the new head coach of the Colorado Buffaloes football team. With a five-year, $10 million contract, MacIntyre would annually earn nearly quadruple his annual salary at San Jose State. The following day, San Jose State named defensive coordinator Kent Baer to be interim coach for the 2012 Military Bowl on December 27, in which they defeated Bowling Green 29-20. The previous week, MacIntyre stated that although other schools had contacted him about potential job openings, MacIntyre was not actively seeking another job. During San Jose State's late-season win streak, speculation occurred that MacIntyre might become head coach at Cal or Kentucky in 2013. {  border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size:90%;\\" - ! Name !!

The schedule had six home games and six road games. Because the WAC had only seven football member schools by 2012 due to conference realignment, San Jose State played six conference games and six non-conference games for the season. San Jose State played against all six other WAC member schools: Idaho, Louisiana Tech, New Mexico State, Texas State, UTSA, and Utah State. The non-conference games were against: Colorado State and San Diego State of the Mountain West Conference, Stanford of the Pac-12 Conference, UC Davis of the Big Sky Conference, and FBS independent schools BYU and Navy. On November 3, San Jose State became bowl eligible for the first time since 2008 after beating Idaho and attaining six wins against FBS schools. However, the win over UTSA did not count, because UTSA was not yet a full FBS member school. Six games were nationally televised this season. ESPN showed the Military Bowl on December 27, ESPN2 showed the games against BYU and Louisiana Tech, CBS Sports Network showed the game against Navy, and Pac-12 Network showed the game against Stanford. WatchESPN also streamed the games shown on ESPN and ESPN2 as well as two games—the ones against Colorado State and UTSA—broadcast by ESPN3, the game against New Mexico State via New Mexico State's AggieVision network, and the game against Utah State via ESPN Regional Television. KLIV in San Jose served as the flagship station for the San Jose State Spartans Football Radio Network, along with fellow affiliates KION in Salinas and newcomer KFIV in Modesto.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a maternal death is the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes. In situations where attribution of the cause of death is inadequate, another definition, pregnancy-related death was coined by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), defined as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the cause of death. Uganda is an African country within the Sub-Saharan African Region. When comparing the rates of Uganda to the region Uganda has a much lower maternal mortality ratio, 430 versus 619 deaths per 100,000. Sub-Saharan Africa fertility rate is 119 per 1,000 – which is significantly less than Uganda. This is suggesting that when compared to other nations in the same region, Uganda has more teen pregnancies and births. However, the region averages only 19 seats in parliament, which is much lower than Uganda. 22.2% of women in the region have at least a secondary education. This is significantly higher than Uganda suggesting that higher education for women is more difficult to achieve in Uganda compared to the average number in the region. 62.9% of women in Sub-Saharan Africa are actively participating in the labor force. Uganda seems to have greater participation from women than the region's average. Uganda is the average when it comes to contraceptive use in the region suggesting this is an issue of that entire region. 73.6% of women attend at least one antenatal care visit in the region. Uganda's is higher, suggesting more Uganda women take advantage of healthcare services than other women in the region. Uganda is also the average for the region in percent of births done with the aid of a skilled attendant also suggesting this is a regional issue. The fertility rate in Sub-Saharan Africa is 4.8, which is a lot lower than the fertility rate in Uganda. Multiple factors may be attributable to this high MMR in Uganda, for example, MMR is often a reflection of access to health care services. Even when health care services are available, healthcare worker under-staffing is common often with low medical supplies such as essential medication which can also have an effect.The health of a mother impacts the family and even the entire community. Her ability and access to receive necessary healthcare largely determines health outcomes for herself and her baby. Traditionally, Ugandan women seek to handle birth on their own as it is a time when they can use their own power and make their own decisions which can also be a factor in such a high maternal mortality rate. Many women report mistreatment from healthcare personnel as an additional reason to avoid seeking professional care during pregnancy and labor. A study also found that a majority of Ugandan women lack health literacy and in turn seek care in more traditional or homeopathic ways. Malaria is also a substantial issue. Pregnant women and their newborn babies are particularly susceptible to complications related to malaria, which is endemic in Uganda. This is also an issue that needs to be addressed in order to improve maternal mortality in Uganda. ==Maternal health as a capability and why it matters== A nurse in Uganda monitoring a patient's heart rate with a Pinard horn stethoscope. The WHO defines health as the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and is one of the fundamental rights of every human being. Amartya K. Sen, a feminist economist, adds to that as he said that health is among the most important conditions of human life and a critically significant constituent of human capabilities which we have reason to value. It has been found that healthier nations, or those with a greater life expectancy and lower infant mortality, see greater economic growth and prosperity. The argument has also been made the other way that economic growth contributes to healthier nations. It is not just the overall availability of resources that improves health, but access by the public to those resources. Sen argues that health only improves during economic prosperity if there is a shift in resource allocation towards health and education, equitable distribution of income, and extensive employment programs to decrease the unemployment rate. Sen writes, \\"The factors that can contribute to health achievements and failures go well beyond health care, and include many influences of very different kinds, varying from (genetic) propensities, individual incomes, food habits and lifestyle, on the one hand, to the epidemiological environment and work conditions, on the other...We have to go well beyond the delivery and distribution of health care to get an adequate understanding of health achievement and capability.\\" UNICEF found that healthy children need healthy mothers. A woman in Sub-Saharan Africa has a 1 in 16 chance of dying in childbirth. The report found that at least 20% of the burden of disease in children below the age of 5 is related to poor maternal health and nutrition, as well as the quality of care at delivery and during the newborn period. Yearly, 8 million babies die before or during delivery or in the first week of life. Further, many children are tragically left motherless each year. These children are 10 times more likely to die within two years of their mothers' death. It has also been found that the health of the mother vastly affects the health of all of her children. The health of our mothers vastly impacts the health and success of our future generations. ==Maternal mortality and morbidity== The World Health Organization (WHO) defines maternal health as the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. According to estimates from Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), Uganda’s maternal mortality ratio, the annual number of deaths of women from pregnancy-related causes per 100,000 live births stands at 343 after allowing for adjustments. Women die as a result of complications during and following pregnancy and childbirth and the major complications include severe bleeding, infections, unsafe abortion and obstructed labor. Uganda is slow in its progress in the fifth goal of improving maternal health in its Millennium Development Goals. With the 2015 target for maternal mortality ratio at 131 per 100,000 births and proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel set at 100%, Uganda has a long battle in reaching its intended goals. Moreover, the methodology used and the sample sizes implemented by the Uganda Demographic Health Survey (UDHS) do not allow for precise estimates of maternal mortality. This suggests that the estimates collated are erroneous and it is conceivable that the actual rates could be much higher than those reported. Uganda has over the years had a decline in infant and under-five mortality. The most common causes of under- five mortality are pneumonia (16 per cent), malaria (13 per cent), diarrhea (10 per cent) and HIV and AIDs (7 per cent). Child mortality is differently across the country. Karamojia, Southwest, West Nile and the western regions have the highest mortality. Although there is a decline in mortality, 1 out of 11 children dies before they turn five years old. Although the maternal mortality has increased from 435 in 1990 to 438 in 2011 per 1000 child, the neonatal mortality has dropped from 29 in 1990 to 27 in 2001 per 1000 child. https://www.unicef.org/uganda/what-we-do/child-survival-development High maternal mortality rates persist in Uganda due to an overall low use of contraceptives, limited capacity of health facilities to manage abortion/miscarriage complications and prevalence of HIV/AIDS among pregnant women. Despite malaria being one of the leading causes of morbidity in pregnant women, prevention and prophylaxis services are not well established. ==Human Development Report 2011== The Human Development Report ranked 183 countries based on a variety of criteria. Uganda ranked 161 out of 183 countries. Its high ranking puts it under the Low Human Development category. The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite index that measures the achievement of countries in three basic dimensions of human development-a long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living. Uganda received a value of 0.446. The closer the number is to one, the better the country is in regards to human development. Norway is ranked at number one with a HDI of 0.943. The next variable that was taken into consideration is life expectancy at birth in years. Uganda's life expectancy is 54.1 years. The mean number of years in school is the average number of years of education received by people ages 25 and older. In Uganda the mean is only 4.7. Expected years of schooling is the number of years of schooling that a child of school entrance can expect to receive if prevailing patterns of age-specific enrollment rates persist throughout the child's life. I Uganda, the expected years of schooling is 10.8. The Gross National Income (GNI) is the aggregate income of an economy generated by its production and its ownership of factors of production, less the incomes paid for the use of factors of production owned by the rest of the world, converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates divided by the midyear population. In Uganda the GNI is $1,124.00. The GNI per capita rank minus the HDI rank: Difference in ranking by GNI per capita and by the HDI. In Uganda this measure is 7. The last measure is the Nonincome HDI, which is the value of the HDI computed from the life expectancy and education indicators only. In Uganda this measure is 0.506. The Gender Inequality Index (GDI) is a composite measure that reflects inequality in achievements between women and men in three categories: reproductive health, empowerment, and the labor market. Out of 183 countries, Uganda ranks 11th and the maternal mortality is 343 per 100,000 live births. The fertility rate adolescents (ages 15–19) is 149.9 per 1,000. Women currently hold 37.2 seats in parliament. Only a meager 9.1% of the female population has a secondary education or higher. 78.3% of women are participating in the labor force. Only 24% of women who are in their childbearing years use some sort of contraceptive method. 94% of women are receiving at least 1 antenatal visit, but only 42% are giving birth with the aid of a skilled attendant. The fertility rate in Uganda is 5.59 children per female. Based on the information given in these tables there appears to be a correlation between the high maternal mortality ratio and high fertility rate which could be associated with low contraceptive use. The low percentage of women giving birth with a skilled birth attendant could also be associated with a high maternal mortality ratio. Low secondary education rates, low access to health care services, low use of contraceptives coupled with high fertility rates is contributing to a high percentage of maternal mortality in Uganda. However, we do see a high labor force participation which could potentially lead increase empowerment for women and an increase in monetary gain to spend on health services. However, currently the high labor force participation does not seem to be aiding Uganda women in regards to maternal health. Uganda's extremely low percentage of women with at least a secondary education could also be attributed to a higher fertility rate and less desirable birth outcomes, as education affects health literacy and identifying the need for assistance from a skilled birth attendant. Studies have shown how the poor health of women can have a negative impact on economic achievement for the country as a whole. Low economic development then constrains the capability of women to achieve better health. Poor quality of healthcare services Almost all women in developing countries have at least four antenatal care visits, are attended to by a skilled health worker during childbirth, and receive postpartum care. In contrast, only 47% of Ugandan women receive antenatal care coverage and only 42% of births are attended by skilled health personnel. Among the poorest 20% of the population, the share of births attended by skilled health personnel was 29% in 2005/2006 as compared to 77% among the wealthiest 20% of the population. The case of Jennifer Anguko, a popular elected official who bled slowly to death in the maternity ward in a major hospital, aptly exemplifies the poor state of maternal health care that is provided to women, even in major urban healthcare facilities. Despite the national policy of promoting maternal health through promoting informed choice, service accessibility and improved quality of care through the national Safe Motherhood Programme (SMP), it remains a challenge to the Ugandan government as to how it would achieve its 2015 Millennium Development Goals of reducing maternal mortality rates and 100% births attended to by skilled health personnel. In order to achieve future economic growth, it is vital that the population remains healthy. A study was done in 2007 in 54 districts and 553 health facilities in Uganda to determine the availability of emergency obstetric care and its related maternal deaths. The study found that few of these units had running water; electricity or a functional operating theater.A.K. Mbonye, M.G. Mutabazi, J.B. Asimwe, O. Sentumbwe, J. Kabarangira, G. Nanda, V. Orinda. “Declining maternal mortality ratio in Uganda: Priority interventions to achieve the Millennium Development Goal”, International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics, 21 May 2007. Retrieved 3 March 2012. However, having these items was shown to have a protective effect on maternal deaths. The availability of midwives had the highest protective effect, reducing the case fatality rate by 80%. This study found that while 97.2% of health facilities were expected to have emergency obstetric care services, few had provided these services. This is the most likely explanation for the high health facility-based maternal death rate of 671 per 100,000 live births in Uganda in 2007. The study concluded that addressing health system issues, particularly among human resources, and increasing access to emergency obstetric care could reduce maternal mortality. ==Limited access to healthcare services== Cultural barriers in seeking access There is not only the issue of a lack of resources in healthcare services, there are also cultural barriers in women seeking professional care. Ugandan women adhere to very traditional birthing practices and believe that pregnancy is a test of endurance and maternal death is merely a sad but normal event. This cultural view hinders the chances of women seeking professional maternal care. In the Kiboga community it is evident that pregnancy and childbirth are some of the major areas where women still command power and status, which they strive to embody in order to enhance their status within the household and community.Kyomuhendo, Grace. \\"Low Use of Rural Maternity Services in Uganda: Impact of Women's Status, Traditional Beliefs and Limited Resources\\", Reproductive Health Matters, May 2003. Retrieved 3 March 2012. Another factor preventing women from seeking emergency obstetric care among Ugandan women is the cultural desire for Ugandan women to 'protect their own integrity.' A common birthing practice is for women to give birth completely alone and the individual is the one who decides if outside help is needed.Jermone K. Kabakyenga, Per-Olof Ostergren, Maria Emmelin, Phionah Kyomuhendo, and Karen Odberg Pettersson. \\"The pathway of obstructed labour as perceived by communities in south-western Uganda: a grounded theory study\\", Global Health Action 2011, Retrieved 20 March 2012. It has also been found that women feel that they have the most power and control during the birthing process, which is something they often lack in other aspects of their lives. Women are considered to be strong and independent if they can handle the birthing process by themselves. These beliefs often lead to very dangerous circumstances as women often delay assistance, which sometimes costs their life or the life of the baby. Oftentimes one of these main issues is obstructed labor. When women realize labor is not progressing normally they first seek female friends or traditional birth attendants. This can result in a further delay in seeking medical attention from someone who is trained to handle such complications. A study conducted in 2001 found that one common remedy used for obstructed labor in home births was herbs. As high as 80% of childbirths used herbs. Ugandan culture also sees the birthing process as a woman's affair and therefore oftentimes there is little male involvement. Transportation is also another issue in Uganda. Most families do not own personal cars and cannot afford taxi fares. More remote and rural areas cannot be reached by car but must be reached using a motorcycle. These conditions are not ideal in transporting a woman in labor, so women tend to choose to stay home during labor. Women also avoid healthcare facilities as this also inhibits their own integrity. They feel that they are powerless in a hospital, have little say in decisions, and know little about procedures being done to them. There is also a lack of medical supplies in Ugandan hospitals and healthcare is run on a fee for service basis. Many women do not have the funds necessary to both travel to a hospital and pay for hospital services and supplies. Or if they do have the funds, hospitals could also be out of supplies. This further discourages them from giving birth in a healthcare setting. There is an urgent need to educate both men and women on the risks of having home or solitary childbirths that are not assisted by a skilled attendant. A study conducted in 2011, suggests that birthing outcomes would improve if men were intimately involved in the process and could assist in making decisions regarding obstructed labor or other complications. The integrity of women could be maintained if health workers were more compassionate and more able to support women and provide understandable information during labor. There is also a great need to improve both access and quality of healthcare offered to the masses in Uganda.  Emergency response  One major issue in regard to maternal health is access to quality emergency obstetric care and the many barriers Ugandan women face to gain access to such care. A needs assessment of emergency obstetric care was carried out in 197 health facilities in 19 out of 5 health districts in Uganda, covering 38% of the total population. V. Orinda, H. Kakande, J. Kabarangira, G. Nanda, A.K. Mbonye. \\"A sector-wide approach to emergency obstetric care in Uganda\\", International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics. 2005, Retrieved 4 March 2012. The study found in 2005, that there was a large number of missing signal functions at health facilities and an urgent need to improve the availability of emergency obstetric care. It was found that the improvement of care begins by improving district health workers' skills in emergency obstetric care so that they can effectively manage and treat obstetric complications. Part of this training includes hospital staff on how to properly manage data systems to better monitor and evaluate program implementation. An effective advocacy tool, known as REDUCE, has already been developed for Uganda to stimulate policy dialog and strategic planning. The REDUCE tool uses computer models to estimate the human and economic consequences of maternal mortality, and generates data that can be used to create arguments for giving higher priority to maternal mortality reduction in creating policies, strategy development, and resource allocation.  Distance, quality, bypassing  A number of barriers to the use of professional maternal health services have been identified, including distance to facilities and perceived quality of services. A study conducted in 2003 examined the proportion of deliveries from individuals in local area and the number of deliveries each year for several different facilities to assess barriers influencing an individual's access to maternal health care. The results of the study found that many people travel outside their local area, bypassing several other healthcare facilities, to reach more popular services–facilities with a high number of deliveries per year. Women associated popularity with a higher quality of care and costs, making the extra travel time worth it. As a result of this perceived quality of care, some facilities are underutilized and others over-stretched, decreasing the availability of staff and supplies.Ssengooba, Freddie, and Justin O Parkhurst. “Assessing Access Barriers to Maternal Health Care: Measuring Bypassing to Identify Health Centre Needs in Rural Uganda.” OUP Academic, Oxford University Press, 11 June 2009, academic.oup.com/heapol/article/24/5/377/586073. Mistreatment by medical personnel In 2003, a study was conducted in Hoima, Uganda, whose aim was to examine the reasons why women continued to choose high-risk options when faced with complications of pregnancy and delivery, ultimately leading to severe morbidity and mortality. The study found that women considered the use of primary health units and the referral hospital when complication occurred as a last resort. Women reported that a lack of skilled staff, complaints of abuse, neglect, and poor treatment in the hospital, and poorly understood reasons for procedures, plus health workers’ views that women are ignorant, also explain why many women consider going to a hospital for delivery as a last resort. Limited reproductive health literacy Many women do not utilize healthcare services because they do not understand reasons for procedures. Health literacy is a large issue among women in Uganda. It not only affects birthing outcomes but also information on reproductive care. Another study conducted in 2012, found that many Ugandan women rely on myths, rumors, and misconceptions that discourage them from using reproductive health services, particularly family planning.Belle, Taylor-McGhee. \\"The Right of Every Woman\\", GenderWatch, 2010, Retrieved 3 March 2012. Another study conducted in 2011 found that even those pregnant women who attended antenatal classes had very little knowledge of danger signs during pregnancy. An association was found between birthing preparedness and knowledge of danger signs. The most common birth preparedness practice was saving money to facilitate referral in case of complications. While only 68% of women in the study had attended at least four antenatal care visits during their last pregnancy. Only 19% of women in the study could indicate at least three danger signs.Jerome K Kabakyenga, Per-Olof Ostergren, Eleanor Turyakira, Karen O Petterson. \\"Knowledge of obstetric danger signs and birth preparedness practices among women in rural Uganda\\", Reproductive Health 2011, Retrieved 12 March 2012. This shows that a considerable share of those who seek professional care are not receiving or retaining vital information. It was found that women appear to be unaware of the risk they take by subjecting themselves to prolonged labor. The study found that among women who went to antenatal visits 40% had not been advised where to deliver and the staff were allegedly unfriendly. There also seems to be an association between having a delivery by skilled birth attendants and being under the age of twenty. It is hoped that it is becoming more culturally acceptable to give birth with the assistance of a skilled attendant than it is among the older generations. The study concluded that every woman should be made aware of the likelihood of complications during pregnancy, childbirth, labour, and the postpartum periods. There has also been success using mobile phones to provide health information in HIV programs in Uganda. Since mobile phones are becoming more and more common, it appears this could also be a good route for antenatal education. Reliance on traditional medicine In rural areas, conceiving pregnant women seek the help of traditional birth attendants (TBAs) due to difficulty in accessing formal health services and also high transportation or treatment costs. TBAs are trusted as they embody the cultural and social life of the community. However, the TBAs’ lack of knowledge and training and the use of traditional practices have led to risky medical procedures resulting in high maternal mortalities. In 2006 it was found that some rural areas of Uganda up to 90% of the population uses traditional medicine for day to day healthcare needs. The World Health Organization estimates that 80% of the developing world uses traditional medicinal practices. It was found that over 80% of child births that are conducted at home use herbal remedies in the Bushenyi district of Uganda.Maud Kamatenesi Mugisha, Hannington Oryem-Origa. \\"Medicinal plants used to induce labour during childbirth in western Uganda\\", Journal of Ethono-Pharmocology 2006, Retrieved 3 March 2012. Over seventy five plants have been recorded for use to induce labor and some of these plants could be oxytocic. The danger lies in levels of dosage as to whether or not the plants could potentially bring harm to the mother and baby. These medicinal herbs are often used because Ugandans cannot afford western pharmaceuticals. These herbal remedies are also socially and culturally accepted. In Uganda reproductive health issues such as maternal mortality and morbidity, account for the number one disease burden. Perinatal and maternal- related conditions account for 20.4%, malaria 15.4%, acute lower respiratory infections 10.5%, AIDS 9.1%, and diarrhea 8.4%. These conditions account for over 60% of the total burden. In Uganda, it is viewed that a woman who had died in childbirth is equated to a soldier who had died during a war. Maternal death is considered a natural phenomenon and encourages the use of herbs, while undermining safe birthing practices with a skilled birth attendant. Women in Uganda are generally more disadvantaged than men. There tends to be a patriarchal order of communities. Therefore, women have a very limited control of resources and in most cases have poorer health. The study found that dosing and toxicity levels need to be monitored in the use of medicinal herbs during labor. There is a need for further field and laboratory research to establish appropriate dosage levels. In 2006, the maternal mortality rate in Uganda is 506 deaths per 100,00 live births. There is a need for health provision programs, safe motherhood programs, health policies in reproductive health care, and collaborative approaches involving traditional medicinal practitioners such as traditional birth attendants. It is possible that a lack of knowledge on plant species used to induce labor and speed up childbirth could be one of the main factors that contribute to high maternal mortality in Uganda. Malaria and pregnancy Malaria is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Uganda. It is especially lethal among pregnant women and children under five. The mortality rate for all ages is estimated at 32.1% in 2004. A study in Mukono, Uganda, determined that the most effective delivery system of intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) for pregnant women was that education was a factor in health seeking behaviors. Those who were a part of the study accessed IPTp early and most of them adhered to the two doses of SP. Women experienced a reduction in malaria episodes, anemia, parasitaemia and low birth weight. While these results cannot be attributed to the intervention alone, after controlling for age, education, parity, and occupation, there were still significant differences for parasitaemia, reported malaria episodes and birth weight, indicating the importance of access and adherence to IPTp.A K Mbonye, I C Bygbjerg, P Magnussen. \\"Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy: a new delivery system and its effect on maternal health and pregnancy outcomes in Uganda\\", Bulletin of the World Health Organization 2007, Retrieved 17 March 2012. == Perception on pregnancy influence patterns of seeking care == Uganda's socioeconomic and political instability, characterized by the destruction of health infrastructure, chronic shortages of staff and healthcare supplies, low wages for health workers, low accessibility to health services and mistreatment by medical personnel, have long been to blame for its high infant and maternal mortality rate. Although these barriers play a substantial role in the limited access to healthcare services in Uganda, it has also become apparent that the way in which women perceive pregnancy can heavily influence patterns of seeking care. Some perceive pregnancy as natural, an honor, an achievement, or an exaltation of femininity, that brings joy to families and awards women respect, power, and status in their community.Lang-Baldé, R., & Amerson, R. (2018). Culture and Birth Outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Review of Literature. Journal of Transcultural Nursing, 29(5), 465–472. https://doi.org/10.1177/1043659617750260 Oftentimes these women feel socially accepted and excited for their futures, motivating them to seek antenatal care. Others perceive pregnancy as a life-threatening experience, characterized by fear, unpredictable timing, and a level of uncertainty. They often define their pregnancies as a painful or regrettable experience, especially if they conceived accidentally or against their will. This mentality towards pregnancy is associated with a decrease in the amount of antenatal care sought, exacerbating issues surrounding maternal health. Many women also define their pregnancy based on sociocultural values systems, including through gender and power relations.Morgan, R., Tetui, M., Muhumuza Kananura, R., Ekirapa-Kiracho, E., & George, A. S. (2017). Gender dynamics affecting maternal health and health care access and use in Uganda. Health Policy and Planning, 32(suppl_5), v13–v21. https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czx011 Osamor, P. E., & Grady, C. (2016, June 7). Women's autonomy in health care decision-making in developing countries: a synthesis of the literature. https://doi.org/10.2147/IJWH.S105483 In societies where women are seen as inferior to men in the public sphere, the idea that birthing yields immense power has been attributed to the nature of childbearing. It is not uncommon for women to conceptualize their birth as a battle–a test of endurance and tolerance of physical pain. This conceptualization often leads to pregnant women suppressing their concerns about potential complications or the need for immediate medical attention. It is crucial that one understands various childbirth experiences and perceptions, as it allows individuals to better understand patterns of seeking care and how to approach individualized and culturally sensitive maternal health care.Namujju, J., Muhindo, R., Mselle, L.

His career extended from World War II to his death: he worked for the US Air Force, then was professor at the University of Chicago and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), researcher at NASA and private consultant. Atlas owned 22 patents, published more than 260 papers, was a member of many associations, and received numerous honors in his field. == Early life == Atlas was born May 25, 1924, in Brooklyn, New York, from Jewish parents who immigrated from Poland and Russia. He studied primary and high school in Brooklyn, starting college in City College of New York afterward. He served in the U.S. Army during the Second World War in the US Army Air Corps, where he worked on the development of radars, in particular on the problem of precipitation echos. After the war, Atlas remained in the U.S. Air Force for 18 years, working at the Cambridge Research Laboratories, in Bedford, Massachusetts, as head of a research team on weather radars while working on his Master and Doctorate degrees. He particularly investigated the Doppler Effect for use in wind measurement. ==Career== From 1966 to 1972, Atlas was professor of meteorology at the University of Chicago. From 1972 to 1976, he was the director of the atmospheric technologies division at NCAR in Boulder, Colorado. The results of his team were used for the development of the actual United States Doppler weather radars network called NEXRAD. In 1977, Atlas formed the Laboratory for Atmospheric Sciences at the NASA at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. This center has produced numerous meteorological instruments to be used on weather satellites for study of the atmosphere, the oceans, and the cryosphere. Atlas officially retired in 1984, but remained active in the meteorology research community, in particular in radar meteorology. He still worked until recently at Goddard, he is a fellow of the American Geophysical Society, the Royal Meteorological Society (RMS),and the National Academy of Engineering. Atlas is a fellow of the American Meteorological Society (AMS), and a previous president in 1975. He received numerous awards, including the Symons Gold Medal of the RMS in 1988 and the Carl-Gustaf Rossby Research Medal in 1996 from AMS. He received in 2004, the Dennis J.

The Synod of Diamper (1599) was held during his time. In 1601, Francis Ros became Bishop, appointed by the Archbishop of Goa, Aleixo de Menezes. In the beginning there was cordiality, but the deliberate downgrading of Angamaly and the inertia of Bishop Ros frustrated him. When the Archdeacon protested, Ros excommunicated him. In 1615, the Bishop and Archdeacon reconciled each other, but again fell out later. The next Bishop, Etienne de Brito, also did not recognize the Archdeacon's ecclesiastical status. He led the church in a period of severe stress and turmoil, and held it together. After his time and his brother's time the root family of Pakalomattam became heirless.

Inter Milan Primavera After the departure of Fulvio Pea, who left Inter Milan Youth Sector in mid-2011 to become the new Sassuolo head coach, Samaden called Stramaccioni to offer him the vacant position at the club, which he accepted (Roma was unable to offer the same position to Stramaccioni as Alberto De Rossi was the coach of that team and 2011 champion). Inter Primavera was the first in the Group B of its own league as of round 21 (22), the last round Stramaccioni was in charge, ahead Milan with one more point (both 21 games) and Varese with two points (and Varese had one more game, 22).

He led Inter to sixth place and a success in the Derby della Madonnina against Milan that cost Inter's crosstown rivals the Serie A title; his results led club owner Massimo Moratti to confirm him as head coach for the 2012–13 season, as well. The FIGC allowed Stramaccioni to sign the contract without a UEFA Pro Licence as he was admitted to 2012–13 coaching course in order to obtain the licence in June 2013. On 7 October 2012, Stramaccioni guided Inter to a 1-0 victory over Milan, emotionally crying \\"è vostro, è vostro, questo derby è vostro\\" (Italian for \\"it's yours, it's yours, this derby is yours\\") towards Inter supporters at the end of the game. On 3 November 2012, Stramaccioni guided Inter to a 3–1 away victory over the previous season's champions, Juventus, claiming \\"[The] result will send a signal, as we came here to the Juventus Stadium against a team unbeaten in 49 rounds and attacked them with a trident\\".

The start of Panathinaikos' 2016-17 campaign in all competitions proved far beyond the fans' expectations, as it was characterized by a poor run of results, including defeats to Olympiacos (0-3), Xanthi (1-2) and Ajax (1-2 at home and 0-2 away), and marked by the team's elimination from the UEFA Europa League group stage with only one point in the first five fixtures. As a result of increasing fan outrage, further aggravated after Panathinaikos' 2-1 Greek Cup defeat to OFI, chairman Giannis Alafouzos decided to terminate Stramaccioni's contract with the club on 1 December 2016, replacing him later that day with Marinos Ouzounidis.

Upon being appointed, Stramaccioni declared that Meysam Teymouri, Farshad Mohammadi Mehr, Armin Sohrabian, Rouhollah Bagheri and Reza Karimi were not part of his plans for the coming season. Instead, he requested to sign two former Serie A players, Cheick Diabaté and Hrvoje Milić. Stramaccioni lost his first competitive game as Esteghlal's coach against Machine Sazi. On 28 December his team beat Tractor 4–2; with this victory, Esteghlal became the first team to reach over a total of 1000 points in all-time Persian Gulf Pro League table. On 8 December, Stramaccioni resigned as the manager of Esteghlal as the club failed to pay the wages of coaching staff due to the restrictions for transferring money outside Iran caused by the sanctions; however he did not close the door for a possible return to the club if the problems are solved. Following his departure, many Esteghlal fans protested in front of the offices of Iran’s Ministry of Sport and Youth which own the club in order to express their disagreements with the club's board of management and Stramaccioni's departure. On 2 January 2020, the club officially announced his departure from Esteghlal and the negotiations for his return were unsuccessful. ==Managerial statistics== {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Team !rowspan=\\"2\\"From !rowspan=\\"2\\"To !colspan=\\"5\\"Record - !G!!W!!D!!L!!Win % - align=leftInter Milan align=left26 March 2012 align=left24 May 2013 - align=leftUdinese align=left4 June 2014 align=left30 June 2015 - align=leftPanathinaikos align=left9 November 2015 align=left1 December 2016 - align=leftSparta Prague align=left28 May 2017 align=left6 March 2018 - align=leftEsteghlal align=left13 June 2019 align=left8 December 2019 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Total } ==Honours== Managerial Inter Milan *NextGen Series: 2011–12 ==References *Andrea Stramaccioni at Goal.com *Andrea Stramaccioni at FutbolPrimera.es Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Italian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Bologna F.C. 1909 players Category:Italian football managers Category:Inter Milan managers Category:Udinese Calcio managers Category:Serie A managers Category:Panathinaikos F.C. managers Category:Expatriate football managers in Greece Category:AC Sparta Prague managers Category:Expatriate football managers in the Czech Republic Category:Italian expatriate sportspeople in the Czech Republic Category:Czech First League managers Category:Italian expatriate sportspeople in Greece Category:Sapienza University of Rome alumni Category:Footballers from Rome Category:Esteghlal F.C. managers Category:Expatriate football managers in Iran Category:Italian expatriates in Iran ","title":"Andrea Stramaccioni"},{"id":"35230725","text":"Stephen Morrey (1880–1921) was an English-born merchant, farmer and political figure in Saskatchewan.

It was founded as the Sisters of the Third Order Regular of the Order of Discalced Carmelites on 13 February 1866 at Koonammavu in the southern state of Kerala. The first house of the new community was opened in Koonammavu with three women: Eliswa, a widow, her daughter Anna, Eliswa’s sister Tresa and another young lady named Clara came as the fourth member on the next day..

Bernardine Baccinelli, O.C.D.Fr.Leopold Beccaro O.C.D. was their spiritual director. Division In May 1887, the Holy See established the Syro-Malabar Church in India as independent of the hierarchy of the Latin Rite. This caused problems for the young congregation, as both Latin and Syrian bishops claimed authority over them. This had to be settled by Rome, which ruled that the Sisters were part of the Syro-Malabar Vicariate Apostolic of Trichur. The Sisters who belonged to the Latin Church separated and was named the Congregation of Teresian Carmelites (C.T.C.). With the eventual reorganization of the Syro-Malabar hierarchy, the Sisters found themselves divided among five different congregations, each under a different bishop and led by its own Superior General. The first foundation outside of Kerala from among the different groups was to the Punjab in 1958. Union Full union of the disparate congregations did not take place until 16 November 1963, when they were recognized by the Holy See as a congregation of the Eastern Church, at which time the congregation took the name of Congregation of Mother of Carmel, by which it is currently known. ==Current== The congregation today is divided among 20 Provinces and six regions throughout India and Africa. They also serve in Germany, Italy and the United States. ==Saints of the congregation== Elias Chavara, the founder of the congregation, was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1986, in the course of his visit to India. One of the congregation's early members, Mother Euphrasia of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, was beatified by Pope Benedict XVI in 2006.

The Treefort Music Fest is a five-day, indie rock festival which is held at numerous venues throughout downtown Boise, Idaho in late March. The inaugural 2012 festival took place March 20–23 with the featured acts Built to Spill, The Joy Formidable, and Poliça; the 2015 festival, scheduled March 25–29, featured TV On The Radio, Trampled By Turtles, and Emily Wells, and locals Built to Spill and Josh Ritter. Treefort has been called \\"the west’s best SXSW alternative\\" and \\"Boise's preeminent artistic, cultural and musical happening\\" which has \\"morphed from quirky music festival to consuming community event.\\" It has also been characterized as having become a \\"nationally renowned gathering just by maintaining its personable close-knit vibe\\" and a \\"music lover's joyous mayhem\\" which showcases and amplifies the soul of Boise. Given its track record, by its seventh year Treefort was being hailed as \\"the greatest music festival in the country\\" and \\"an absolute gem of a festival.\\" The 2020 festival was initially postponed until September 23–27 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==History== Although the idea of a multi-day, multi-venue music festival has been bruited since the mid-'80s, Treefort itself had its roots in tragedy when producer Lori Shandro's husband died in a private plane crash in 2009. The head of an independent health insurance agency, Shandro took up interests divergent from her married life, and eventually formed The Duck Club, which brings musical acts to Boise throughout the year and now produces the Treefort Music Fest. Logistically, Treefort was inspired in part by the touring schedules of bands headed home to the Northwest from SXSW in Austin, Texas (some of which had been hosted by the Visual Arts Collective at a post- SXSW mini fest in Garden City, Idaho the previous year), as well as late March being the beginning of spring break for many Idaho schools. A week before the festival itself, the Boise-based bands TEENS, Hillfolk Noir, Le Fleur, The Brett Netson Band, Finn Riggins, Youth Lagoon, and Built to Spill had themselves played at SXSW. Producer Lori Shandro reflected on Treefort's genesis a year later at a Scenius town hall-style meeting on artistic endeavours and economic growth that \\"There were just a certain number of people who were all in the same place regarding [Treefort]. ... This sort of synergy happened to make the project come together rather easily... With scenius, there's the thought of trying to put the right people in the same place at the same time, and then things will happen. That's really how Treefort happened. Everybody had the same vision that the Boise music scene is ready to develop and be a force on its own two feet.\\" The festival currently has six year-round staff, 100 contract employees during the festival itself, and nearly a thousand volunteers. ==Chronology== 2012 Off Center Dance Project at a free performance at the Linen Building Thoroughly grass roots, DIY and free of corporate sponsorship, and with an emphasis on emerging music, the indie-centric inaugural Treefort festival took place on March 22–25, 2012 and featured more than 137 bands from throughout the Northwest and as far afield as New Zealand and Australia, as well as performance art, art installations, and disabled and modern dance, seminars on the music business and social media, and local beers. (Initially the intention had been for a small two-day festival of sixty bands.) There were eight stages extant (including free all-ages venues), and ten hours of music scheduled daily on Treefort's initial Saturday and Sunday; an estimated and unexpected 3,000 people attended each of the last full three days of the festival's inaugural run, and some forty national media outlets provided reportage. Critically, the first day of festival was described as being \\"full of transcending bands,\\" and overall the festival was characterised as having \\"the look and feel of a developing SxSW,\\" and \\"a smashing success,\\" and as well as having \\"put Boise on the map\\" in terms of Boise having finally established a music festival due to the high quality of the musicians. The proceeds from Treefort benefit community radio station Radio Boise, KRBX 89.9 FM. 2013 Little Miss and The No Names perform hardcore punk at an all-ages show at the Linen Building in 2013 Months before any bands had even been announced for the Second Annual Treefort Music Fest, scheduled for March 21–24, 2013, the initial batch of early-bird priced wristbands had sold out in October 2012 in 17 minutes. and succeeding ticket sales continued to be faster than those at the same time last year. Treefort 2013 eventually signed up more than 250 bands (some of whom are included in Treefort's sound cloud) and features a lost yarn-bombed 560 lbs. monster (which is sorely missed) with a stone head as its mascot. The Coachella Festival has been compared (unfavourably) to the Treefort Music Fest by Buzzfeed. The second annual Treefort Music Fest aimed at the fence \\"carefully,\\" featuring a more diverse set of acts, but also more than 100 Idaho bands, one of which, Boise-based Youth Lagoon, was one of Rolling Stone's \\"Twenty Must-See Acts\\" at SXSW; it and Foxygen and Unknown Mortal Orchestra, also included in the twenty, performed at both festivals in 2013. The headline act was Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings, and fifteen bands came from the San Francisco Bay Area. Three times as many passes were sold as in 2012; the festival's own app overloaded on Thursday night, and the opening venue, the Shriner's El Korah Shrine, sold a record amount of alcohol. Festival organizers later estimated that they had come within 100 passes of selling out completely; more than 3,000 4-day passes were sold, and thousands variously journeyed to 13 venues throughout downtown Boise to watch more than 260 bands, with roughly 6,000 at the main stage on Friday alone. Sold-out shows, as with Foxygen on opening night, led to people seeing, and being surprised by, bands they had not planned to see, a phenomenon which festival organizer Eric Gilbert described as a \\"win-win situation.\\" Overall the four days of the music festival was acclaimed as turning Boise itself into the sociological third place as different artistic communities converged in a state and city where (the maximum of) six degrees of separation does not exist, and was praised for its high organization and good spirits in showcasing the best independent music North America has to offer and being a safe haven for all walks of life. \\"Happy Treefort\\" became a common greeting, and \\"Treeforting\\" and \\"Postfort\\" also entered the lexicon. 2014 Dan Deacon performs at El Korah The third annual festival, in March 2014, endeavoured to be more \\"green\\"/sustainablehttp://treefortmusicfest.com/first- artist-announcement-for-treefort-music-fest-2014/ and as of February had booked 350 bands (including solo projects and DJs, after rejecting over 1,000 other interested parties due to the sheer volume of talent) featuring the best of upcoming non-mainstream music from such genres as pop, heavy metal, hip hop, electronica, folk, and classic rock. Furthermore, the festival branched out with a film festival, Filmfort, the tech festival Hackfort (which was lauded by President Barack Obama during his January 21, 2015 visit to Boise), Storyfort, and Yoga Fort, as well as comedy showcases.[580923208656753]&action;_type_map=[%22og.recommends%22]&action;_ref_map=[] This synergy marked Treefort as having become \\"more than a music festival. It is a cultural phenomenon, not only propelling Boise’s music scene forward, but now connecting the city’s cultural communities of literature, technology, film and mind/body health.\\" The music festival too was appraised months later by the Boise Metro Chamber of Commerce CEO and president Bill Conners as having benefits to the city beyond that of tourism. (One quarter of those who bought tickets in advance in 2014 were from outside Idaho.) \\"It's become part of Boise's brand,\\" he said. \\"It's a positive brand that helps attract innovative companies, tourists, conventions and investments, so we hope the festival continues.\\"Chamber of Commerce CEO & President appreciation. It has been furthermore been cited as a potential entry in resumes regarding volunteering, and in its second year Hackfort partnered with the Idaho Department of Labor in furtherance of the state's tech industry and digital economy. The third festival kicked off with a \\"blast from the past\\" featuring the reunion of several notable Boise bands; the combined efforts of nearly 400 volunteers (vis-à-vis the nearly 200 for the inaugural festival and the more than 300 for the second) supported bands from the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States over the course of the festival. Treefort, which now has 40 staffers, had 140 bands during its inaugural festival in 2011, and included 140 local bands among the more than 350 during its third, a testament to the festival's burgeoning creativity. The festival averaged 7,000 people a day, an increase over the 6,000 people a day in 2013, had to order more Over 21 wristbands Saturday afternoon, and was expected to turn a profit for the first time. Although approximately 7,500 attended Saturday night and local bars experience a boom in business, the Boise Police Department issued no open alcohol container citations or responded to any significant incidents. Overall the third festival was described as having \\"veered more confidently than ever toward emerging artists in all genres\\" and having been an extensive community and cultural event where \\"good attitudes all but fell from the sky.\\" In August 2014 it was announced that Treefort has yet to make a profit (although it had come close to doing so in 2014), and that the festival was applying to change its business status from that of a limited liability corporation to a certified B corporation whose articles of incorporation and bylaws authorize the corporate board to consider social and other factors besides shareholder interests when making decisions. New co-owners and board members were brought in, and Lori Shandro, who had been subsidizing Treefort to this point, remarked that \\"I wanted to start something that can last forever... This thing could live on its own without me now.\\" It was also formally announced that the festival would return in 2015,Treefort adds co- owners and changes business plan. with its website marking a shift to a five- day festival. Treefort is also involved in public art in Boise via Bloomberg Philanthropies and Boise's Department of Arts and History, and in December 2014 was designated Boise's 2015 Cultural Ambassador by Mayor David Bieter and awarded a $25,000 grant for its \\"... positive impact on the city’s visibility, economy and cultural scene.\\" 2015 Seth Olinsky conducts a dozen bands as an indie rock orchestra The fourth annual festival, March 24-19 2015, booked 430 acts and was supported by some 600 volunteers, approximately 15% of whom went over their required nine hours of volunteer time. Local bands included Magic Sword, Hollow Wood, Thick Business, Transistor Send, Marshall Poole, Calico the Band, and Sun Blood Stories. It also featured Kidfort, Storyfort (a \\"loose literary happening \\"like a miniature version of Readings & Conversations,\\" and performance art featuring neo-burlesque amongst other artistic endeavours, \\"the trippiest part of Treefort,\\"Performance art at Treefort 2015. as well as a midnight to 4 a.m. Breakfastfort at El Korah, thus pulling out all the stops. The overlapping of synergistic events was of such complexity that the Boise Weekly published a layout of Venn diagrams, and some of the venues did not typically host musical acts. Band Dialogue III featured a dozen bands with their respective instrumental kit lined up on both sides of Grove St. conducted by Seth Olinsky holding up placards marked E, F#, B, and so on, riffing and generating shifting walls of sound. The festival was critically acclaimed for fostering \\"a genuine community between festival workers, festival goers and bands,\\" with an emphasis on an electronic music trend (most notably with Emily Wells), although \\"raw, rootsy, reverb-drenched, dreamy, dramatic and other descriptors for guitar music\\" were in abundance. More generally, its ethos was that of a \\"manageable experience devoid of douche bags and marketing companies infiltrating every crevice of the event.\\" Furthermore, \\"For a fourth year festival, Treefort is pretty mature. Over a five-day stretch, some 400 bands play about a dozen venues throughout downtown Boise, from impromptu outdoor stages to small clubs and arcades. The lineup is strong, the organization is admirable and, perhaps most importantly, the city loves to play host. The result is a fishbowl scenario wherein bands and fans are constantly running into each other, exchanging remarks, ideas, cigarettes and contact info in Idaho’s delightfully compact capitol... When Treefort assembles, the entire city puts on the festival wristband.\\" More generally the festival was also characterized for having demonstrating Boise's potential \\"to nurture the convergence of the big, bright, sprawling, conservative, mountain, desert west and the dark, creative, lush, liberal, urban centers of the Pacific Northwest.\\" While the number of attendees has increased annually, the percentage of out-of-towners remains steady at roughly 25%, and baristas’ tip averages doubled. In October it was announced that the 2015 festival had broke even, and that Treefort had in the summer become a Benefit Corporation (B Corp), the only music festival in the U.S. with that status. \\"We have often stated that we are a 'for profit entity ran like a non-profit' because we have always been a values-based project, driven by a purpose much more than the lure of profit. In the summer of 2014, we were presented with a legal option for which we could best represent who we are as a festival, as community members and as a business -- the Treefort Leadership Team officially formed Treefort, LLC and began seeking B Corp certification to lock in and protect the legacy principles the festival was founded upon.\\" 2016 The 2016 lineup was expected to feature more than 400 bands, including notable Boise acts Built to Spill, Hollow Wood, Thomas Paul, Toy Zoo, The Dirty Moogs, Get Wet +, Dark Swallows and Edmond Dantes. Veteran acts jam band Leftover Salmon and soul group Charles Bradley & His Extraordinaires have also been booked. The full lineup, announced on February 12, includes the indie acts Yacht, Chairlift, and Willis Earl Beal, and more than two dozen venues and 450 musicians and bands. Twenty-five of the bands are international acts, the most ever for Treefort, hailing from Japan, Italy, Israel, Australia, etc. Some of the approximately 600 Treefort volunteers have also contributed to local non- profits in keeping with their community ethos. The fifth annual festival was acclaimed as \\"possibly the most dynamic fest in the Northwest,\\" and \\"a unique celebration of art and music.\\" 2017 The sixth annual Treefort's initial announcement of 75 bands was characterized as being, as usual, \\"an insanely eclectic geyser of bands\\"; ultimately 411 bands were announced in a \\"fake news,\\" mockumentary, news satire format. With a wide variety of \\"forts,\\" initial non-musical offerings ranged from a seminar by refugees (hosted by Mayor Dave Bieter himself) to Jungo Blizzard, a macro-puppet 25 feet tall with an arm span of 45 feet based on the video game character from Primal Rage which is too large to get onto the main stage but which is generally expected to be ambushing festival goers, to symposiums on podcasts. More than 20 volunteers (of the 700 volunteers overall) set up Treefort regalia throughout downtown Boise utilizing its comprehensive yet incremental aesthetic which subtly changes annually. Musically, one reviewer opined that \\"With a lineup so large, at Treefort it’s as easy to miss everything as it is to miss nothing. Having a planned schedule when approaching the fest is mainly a plan for fools as the best part about Treefort is stumbling on to those afternoon pop-up sets at the Modern Hotel, or being just a little too deep in your Axe Handle IPL to march from the Linen Building to Pengilly’s. Either way, no one leaves Treefort disappointed, and everyone leaves with a new favorite artist.\\" A British reviewer remarked that \\"The mood on the fourth day of Boise, Idaho’s big music blowout... was buoyant and as bright as the sun shining on festival- goers all through downtown Boise,\\" and months afterwards, after the disastrous Fyre Fest and given the continuing backlash against Coachella, Treefort was held up as an exemplary \\"little party monster\\" and \\"holistic arts festival\\" with a \\"'come sit with us' vibe which pulses throughout the town.\\" Additionally The Boise All-ages Movement Project (styled B-AMP), an Idaho nonprofit which provides for inclusive venues for all ages of musicians and audiences which uses the pop-up retail model, joined the festival. They are active throughout the year. 2018 It was announced that the seventh annual Treefort shall be headlined by George Clinton. The second round of artists announced included Rapsody, Jamila Woods, and Princess Nokia. The third and final round of artists featured notable Russian feminist agitprop rockers Pussy Riot and Cindy Wilson of B-52's fame, initially making for 442 acts in all, but ultimately 462 acts, including a plethora of under the radar bands. \\"Overwhelm is a real thing. There is a lot going on.\\" The Boise All- Ages Movement Project (BAMP) was particularly well received, as was George Clinton & P-Funk's set, illustrating the range of decades of musical talent from funk to punk. Ballet Idaho and Tispur provided an early, mesmerizing highlight, and black, queer transgender musician bell's roar (Sean Desiree) performed a funny, poignant set at the Linen Building. Newsweek noted in its review that within sixteen blocks downtown one could see \\"200 people doing yoga; a child’s face wrapped in virtual reality goggles; a dozen bands arranged in a circle... [and] celebrity chefs plating Wagyu beef.\\" Thousands of people from around the world enjoyed the final days of the festival. Idaho was the only red state on Pussy Riot's first North American tour, and their politically-charged concert (more political rally than traditional concert) had people standing in line for nearly two hours; audience members raised their fists in solidarity as they played their music videos and performed, whereas some in the back of the venue left several songs into the set. Despite the occasionally inclement weather (it snowed on the morning of the final day), one power outage, and cancellations (one due to visa issues), both the inclusiveness of Treefort, bringing together as it does every imaginable walk of life, and the stellar musical acts, caused it to be hailed as \\"the greatest music festival in the country.\\" Although its profit did not increase, the 2018 festival experienced its largest consecutive year increase, with 24,000 people attending, a 33% jump from 2017's 18,000 attendees. 2019 The 8th Annual Treefort featured the headliners Liz Phair, Dan Deacon and Angélique Kidjo's Remain in Light (the latter of whom unfortunately had to cancel due to illness). Music Festival Wizard opined that \\"Boise in Idaho may sound like an odd city choice for an epic festival, but the Treefort festival continues to impress us year after year. Treefort typically takes places the week after SXSW to take advantage of artists heading back to the Northwest.

He also won promotion to Division Three, twice, and played under Jim Smith, Bobby Roberts and Allan Hunter. His long service was rewarded with a testimonial against West Ham in May 1983.

LFL Canada features four teams in four cities across Canada. For the 2012 season the League granted three new franchises: BC Angels, Regina Rage and the Saskatoon Sirens. The Toronto Triumph, who began play in the LFL's original U.S. league in 2011, carried over to LFL Canada; they have moved from the Ricoh Coliseum to the Hershey Centre in Mississauga, Ontario. Unlike previous seasons, for this season the LFL would only play in Canada, with the exception of a handful of exhibition games around the world. The LFL announced in April 2012 that its U.S. teams would not play their 2012 season, anticipating a move to a spring schedule. LFL Canada Lingerie Bowl I was played on November 17, 2012, between the Saskatoon Sirens and the BC Angels at the Abbotsford Entertainment & Sports Centre in Abbotsford, British Columbia, one week before the CFL's Grey Cup.Fan Alert: Lingerie Bowl I Canada date change to Saturday, November 17 The BC Angels won the inaugural championship game 25-12 with BC Angels' quarterback Mary Ann Hanson the game's MVP. ==Developments== On February 9, 2012, the LFL announced that Abbotsford, British Columbia, would be the next Canadian city to host a team in the League. The franchise would play its home games at the Abbotsford Entertainment & Sports Centre and will compete in the Western Division of LFL Canada. On February 20, 2012, the LFL announced that the franchise will be named the BC Angels following the results of an online fan vote. The decision for Abbotsford to host a team sparked some controversy, including expressed concern from at least one city councillor, as \\"Abbotsford is a deeply religious agricultural community.\\" On February 22, 2012, the LFL announced that Regina, Saskatchewan would be the next Canadian city to host a team in the League. Home games would be played at the Brandt Centre. On March 6, the LFL announced that the franchise will be named the Regina Rage after an online fan vote. Six days later, on February 28, the LFL announced that Saskatoon, Saskatchewan would join Regina as LFL Canada's second team in the Wheat Province. Home games would be played at the Credit Union Centre. Upon releasing the Saskatoon Sirens' logo and colours, the league announced that LFL Canada was set at four teams for the 2012 season, with the league playing an eight-game schedule, still scheduled to end with the Canadian Lingerie Bowl the day before the Grey Cup. The Canadian Lingerie Bowl was later rescheduled to start one week before the Grey Cup, due in part to a schedule conflict with the Vanier Cup, the Canadian college football championship. ==Teams== {  + 2012 Teams - !

While not a published alchemist, he was a significant figure in English alchemical work from the 1650s onwards; he is known to have used the pen-name \\"Halophilus\\".Donald R. Dickson, Thomas Vaughan and the Iatrochemical Revolution, Seventeenth Century; Spring 2000, Vol. 15 Issue 1, p. 24; PDF. ==Early life== The son of Benjamin Henshaw and his wife Anne, and brother to Nathaniel Henshaw. he was baptised at St. Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, City of London, on 15 June 1618.Ancestry.co.uk After attending school at Barnet and then at Cripplegate, London, under Thomas Farnaby, he was entered as commoner at University College, Oxford, in 1634, and remained there five years without taking a degree. At the suggestion of Obadiah Walker and Abraham Woodhead, he studied mathematics, a student of William Oughtred at Albury, Surrey for nine months from 1636, finding it more stimulating than the teaching of his tutor John Elmherst.Darley, p. 43. He also knew the Rosicrucian scholar William Backhouse, who was another of Oughtred's pupils.Darley, p. 49. Henshaw entered the Middle Temple, and in 1637 became tutor there to John Evelyn, to become a lifelong friend, and his brothers. On the outbreak of the First English Civil War he joined Charles I at York. Soon afterwards he went to London, and was taken prisoner by the Parliamentarians. ==Continental travel== Etching by John Evelyn, dedicated to Henshaw, from their Italian travels. Henshaw was allowed to leave England, on giving security not to join the king's army again, and sailed to Holland. He took part in a campaign under William II, Prince of Orange; and then entered the French army, in which he became major, and at some point served under Sir Robert Moray. He subsequently travelled through Spain, and on to Italy, where he lived at Rome, Venice and Padua. He spent a period from late 1644 as the travelling companion of John Evelyn,Darley, pp. 43–4. whom he had encountered at Pisa. They visited Athanasius Kircher's showy rooms in Rome together. When Evelyn moved on to Venice, Henshaw spent time accompanying the young Henry Howard.Darley, pp. 56–7. Evelyn, Henshaw and Francis Bramston were then together at Padua for a period.Darley, p. 60. At the end of the 1640s Henshaw left to return to England. He left Paris, where he had been staying, and came back in 1650;Darley, p. 157. or earlier, before the king's execution in January 1649. ==Under the Commonwealth== On his return to England Henshaw kept a low profile into the 1650s, living a studious life in Kensington, then outside London.Darley, p. 109. A \\"chemical club\\" in which he was involved was set up in 1650 by Robert Child: other members were Thomas Vaughan and William Webbe. In alchemy he collaborated with Vaughan, who resided with him in Kensington, and Samuel Hartlib reported Henshaw's claims to have found the alkahest, with a formula of provenance from Jan Baptist van Helmont, via Hugh Plat.Darley, p. 138. Henshaw is referred to in the preface to Elias Ashmole's Way to Bliss (1658) as an expert in the occult science of the time; Ashmole's Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum (1652) had made good use of Henshaw's library. Hartlib noted Henshaw's plans for a college, one of a number of proposals of the time entertained also by Evelyn and his friend Abraham Cowley. Henshaw was occupying the Pondhouse or Moathouse, in the manor of West Town, Kensington, a property that had been leased by his father. There for a period in the early 1650s a utopian \\"Christian Learned Society\\" existed; there was a group of eight, with Henshaw, Vaughan and six others. Across the political divide of the time, Henshaw kept in touch with Hartlib, and the title of the Society chimed exactly with the ideas of the Hartlib Circle, and in particular John Hall. The house itself was mostly demolished around 1800.'The Holland estate: To 1874', Survey of London: volume 37: Northern Kensington (1973), pp. 101–126. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=49870 Date accessed: 27 March 2012. Henshaw was called to the bar, in 1654, but dropped the practice of the common law.Darley, p. 130. He sold his accommodation in the Middle Temple to Ashmole, in 1658. At about this time, according to one account, he attended meetings at Gresham College of the \\"Oxonian Society\\" for virtuosi and natural philosophers.Reuben Percy and Sholto Percy, in the Percy Anecdotes; online text. ==Later life== Henshaw was one of the council that succeeded the 1660 committee of 12, and that actually set up the Royal Society. He was chosen a Fellow of the Royal Society at its first constitution in 1663, and was an officer of the Society over many years.Royal Society, Officers. He continued alchemical researches, with Sir Robert Paston.Donald R. Dickson, Thomas Henshaw and Sir Robert Paston's pursuit of the red elixir: An early collaboration between fellows of The Royal Society, Notes Rec. R. Soc. Lond. 22 January 1997 51 (1) 57–76. When the Society was in the doldrums in the 1670s, he was one of the group meeting with Robert Hooke to promote its activity. In 1688 he borrowed a work by Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont from Francis Lodwick, another of the \\"Hooke circle\\" that functioned also as a book club. In 1672 Henshaw attended Charles Stewart, 3rd Duke of Richmond, ambassador extraordinary to the court of Denmark, as secretary of the embassy and assistant to the duke. The latter died on 12 December of the same year, and Henshaw was commanded to remain in Denmark as envoy extraordinary, and held the office for two years and a half. He was appointed Charles II's under- secretary of the French tongue and gentleman of the privy council in ordinary; the appointment, gained with Evelyn's help, was during the 1670s. He continued as French secretary under James II and William III (inscription on his tombstone). Henshaw spent the last years of his life at his house in Kensington, where he died on 2 January 1700. ==Works== Henshaw published, from the Italian of Álvaro Semedo, History of the Great and Renowned Monarchy of China, to which is added a History of the late Invasion and Conquest of the flourishing Kingdom of the Tartars, with an exact account of the other Affairs of China, London, 1655. After the Restoration minor papers appeared by him in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society,Royal Society record. and two short treatises on making Salt Peter and Gunpowder. He edited with an epistle to the reader Stephen Skinner's Etymologicon Linguæ Anglicanæ, 1671. In 1654 there was printed at Spa a Vindication of Thomas Henshaw, sometime Major in the French King's service, in justification of himself against the Aspersions throwne upon him. In this he repudiates any share in plots on behalf of Charles II, but calls Oliver Cromwell \\"the greatest murtherer\\". This, however, was by a cousin of the same name. ==Family== According to his tombstone in the chancel of the parish church of Kensington, Henshaw married Anne Kipping, daughter of Robert Kipping of Tewdley, Kent; they had six sons and two daughters. His wife died 4 October 1671. A daughter Anne, his sole survivor, married Thomas Halsey of Gaddesden, Hertfordshire.Daniel Lysons, 'Kensington', The Environs of London: volume 3: County of Middlesex (1795), pp. 170–230.

Founded in May 2010, as of late 2014 the company produces a single model with an all-electric range of up to . The car was initially put on sale in selected Chinese cities only. ==Name== An invented name from the Chinese Tengshi (), Denza roughly translates to \\"rising power and momentum\\". Alternative translations include \\"wind power\\" or \\"winding circumstances\\". ==History== On 1 March 2010, BYD Auto and Daimler AG signed a memorandum of understanding for the joint development of electric vehicles. That initial link-up led to the creation of a new, equal-ownership legal entity, Shenzhen BYD Daimler New Technology Co., Ltd., which was formally established on 27 May 2010 and received a business license from the Chinese state in March 2011. Its brand name, Denza, debuted in March 2012, and a new energy vehicle (NEV) concept car was first shown in April 2012 at the Auto China motor show in Beijing.For brand name debut, see *For concept car showing, see It was expected that this product would be offered as a luxury car. While its initial product was set to be launched in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen in September 2014, in June of that year the launch date was pushed back to late 2014, and the car debuted in December of that year. ==Operations== In 2013, Denza was constructing its assembly plant in Pingshan, Shenzhen, which was set to have an annual capacity of 40,000 vehicles. ==Government subsidies== Successful sales may depend on subsidies provided by the Chinese government. The chairman of the Chinese co-owner of Denza expressed his hope that these would be in place by mid-2013, and many of the press releases posted on the Denza website concern subsidies. Prior electric car grants were in effect for only two years starting in 2010, but in September 2013 a scheme providing cash payments to buyers of all-electric and hybrid vehicles was established. When it was launched in December 2014, purchasers of the car qualified for a RMB 78,000 subsidy and while the total subsidy on offer depends on location of purchase, no more than RMB 120,000 can be deducted. Subsidies also increase demand for the car in other ways, too, and as of 2014 purchasers were exempted from Beijing's license plate lottery and qualified for free plates in Shanghai and Shenzhen. ==Models and products== Denza all-electric concept car at Auto Shanghai 2013 Initially, a single, eponymous model called the Denza 500 was on offer. Recently, an SUV concept, called Denza X, was officially revealed at the Guangzhou Auto Show in November 2019.

This event produced wildfires that burned 1,200,000 acres of land, and killed seven people. An extremely critical fire weather event is the greatest threat level issued by the NWS Storm Prediction Center (SPC) for wildfire events in the United States. Extremely critical areas are issued only several times a year when forecasters at the SPC are confident of extremely dangerous wildfire conditions on a given day. These are typically reserved for the most extreme events. Fire weather products have been issued by the Storm Prediction Center since 1998; however, there is very little online documentation for days before 2002 due to the lack of SPC archives.

Added to central government official and unofficial taxes and dues, and Kurdish chieftains extorting their traditional tributes, where predatory Kurdish tribesmen given an official status after being incorporated into the semi-regular Kurdish cavalry units known as the Hamidiye. As a result, thousands of Armenian farmers lost their lands and eked out a living as transient hired labourers or migrated to Constantinople and other cities to live in impoverished squalid conditions. The repeated failures of promised reforms by Constantinople led to some Armenians initiating local measures for self-defense. The Social Democrat Hunchakian Party and Armenian Revolutionary Federation were two Armenian political groups active in the region. After the massacres of Armenians in Sasun in 1894, and the more widespread massacres in the plain of Mush in 1895 and 1896 during the events known as the Hamidian massacres, the political activity of the 1880s developed into armed self-defense units, known as fedayee, who used the mountains as safe havens and as areas for political agitation.Richard G Hovannisian, Armenian Baghesh / Bitlis and Taron / Mush, pages 5 and 6, 2001. In 1899 several Armenian fedayee commanders were killed, and Andranik Ozanian was given the leadership of all such groups within the Sasun district of Bitlis Vilayet. Under Andranik's command were thirty-eight villages. ==The battle== In November 1901 Andranik came down from the mountains with some 30 experienced fedayeen (including Kevork Chavush and Hakob Kotoyan) and some 8 to 10 peasants from Tsronk village. Pursued by Turkish armed forces, Andranik's men were eventually cornered and on November 20 they barricaded themselves in the Holy Apostles Monastery located to the east of Mush. A regiment of five Turkish battalions, some 1200 men, commanded by the pashas Ferikh and Ali, began besieging the fortified monastery.The Armenians: history of a genocide, by Yves Ternon - 1990, p. 114 During this period the Turkish army had heavy losses because of cold weather and epidemics. After nineteen days of siege, and surrender negotiations in which Armenian clergy as well as the headman of Mush and foreign consuls took part, Andranik and his men succeeded in secretly leaving Arakelots monastery and moved in small groups back into the nearby mountains. According to Leon Trotsky, Andranik organized the escape by dressing in the uniform of a Turkish officer: \\"he went the rounds of the entire guard, talking to them in excellent Turkish\\" and \\"at the same time showing the way out to his own men\\". ==Aftermath== After breaking out of Arakelots Monastery, Andranik gained a legendary reputation amongst the province's Armenians.Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East & North Africa: A-C, by Philip Mattar- p. 195 \\"Andranik is not a human being, he is a ghost\\", Turks used to say after he disappeared.

It was released on June 20, 2012, by A&M; Octone Records. The album was recorded between 2011 and 2012 and was driven after the moderate success of their third album, Hands All Over (2010), and later by the enormous success of the re- released edition, which was promoted by the single \\"Moves Like Jagger\\", recorded as a collaboration with Christina Aguilera. It is the band's only album not to feature keyboardist, rhythm guitarist and background vocalist Jesse Carmichael, who took a temporary break from performing with the group to focus on his studies and was replaced by musician PJ Morton. The band worked with different producers, such as Max Martin, who serves as the album's executive producer, Ryan Tedder, Shellback and Benny Blanco. The band's guitarist and Levine's usual co-writer James Valentine, only has four credits on the album. The accompanying artwork, created by Los Angeles artist Young & Sick, is a colorful collage of illustrations seemingly inspired by the likes of Picasso and a range of modern cartoonists. Its title is a smirking allusion to Levine's ubiquity, while its sound is a reflection of how the group wishes to retain the large audience they won once again with \\"Moves Like Jagger\\". The album's lead single \\"Payphone\\", featuring rapper Wiz Khalifa, produced by Shellback and Benny Blanco, was released and performed on The Voice, on April 16, 2012. The song was a success, reaching number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, as well as on the ARIA Charts, while it topped the UK Singles Chart, Canadian Hot 100 and Italian Singles Chart. The second single \\"One More Night\\", was released on June 19, 2012. The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 for nine weeks, becoming their longest Hot 100 reign. All four singles released from Overexposed have reached the Hot 100 top-ten, including the last two of them: \\"Daylight\\" and \\"Love Somebody\\". The album received a mixed reception from music critics. Some praised the album, calling it their strongest effort, but others criticized the direction the band decided to take, calling it a failed attempt to go mainstream. Additionally, critics and fans alike perceived the album as overly focused on Levine. It debuted at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart, selling 38,000 copies, and on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 222,000 copies. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Overexposed was the 10th global best-selling album of 2012 with sales of 2.2 million copies. To promote the album, the band embarked on the Overexposed Tour (2012–2014). ==Background== According to Adam Levine, Hands All Over experienced moderate commercial success because of its sound and the location in which it was recorded (Vevey, Switzerland). In September 2010, the band released their third studio album, Hands All Over. While preparing the album, the band received a phone call from Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange, who had heard the band were beginning to write a new record, and expressed an interest in producing it. The album received generally favorable reviews from music critics and debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart. However, the album experienced moderate success in overall sales; regarding that, the band guitarist James Valentine expressed some frustration and said that a new album may be coming sooner than was originally planned. Valentine further commented: > \\"It would be nice to start working on another record next year\\". \\"I think > with the last two records, it's been a little bit unbalanced, in that we had > so much success and there was so much of the world to cover that our > studio/road balance was a little off... In a perfect world we'd tour for six > months and maybe record for six months, but that's not the way it works. But > the whole point is to make more music, and if anything you can spend too > much time out there.\\" Valentine also said the band has \\"tons of material\\" available, including holdovers including songs from Hands All Over and also other tracks the band has written since then. \\"I think everybody's been pretty busy compiling ideas for the next one,\\" he stated. \\"With technology and the recording capacity we have on our laptops, we can be a little more prolific while we're [touring]. We've never been able to do that before. I think we could go in and make a record today and have a pretty solid album.\\" In July 2011, the band re- released Hands All Over and included a new song called \\"Moves Like Jagger\\" which featured American recording artist Christina Aguilera. The song enjoyed a massive commercial success reaching number one on over 22 national singles chart including on the US Billboard Hot 100. In an interview with Mike Wood of Los Angeles Times, Levine explained what went wrong on Hands All Over, \\"I don't think we knew what kind of record we were making. It was such a hodgepodge — all these disparate ideas and songs that didn't make any sense together. He also stated, \\"We were in this idyllic paradise, which is a horrible place to make a record. Switzerland's neutrality is very famous, and I feel like that neutrality infected Maroon 5's third album\\". Levine further stated that \\"Moves Like Jagger\\" saved them and totally revived the group. ==Recording and production== According to Ryan Tedder, Overexposed contains a fresh sound. The band started writing songs for Overexposed during their latest tour in support of Hands All Over. After concluding with the tour, the band recorded the material of the album at the Conway Recording Studios located in Los Angeles, California. Speaking about the development on the material, Valentine revealed that \\"Moves Like Jagger\\" was the first time the band worked with an outside writer, so they decided to implement it more on Overexposed. \\"At this point in our career I think it was a good thing to completely mix up our process and it yielded good results, as well as a more collaborative spirit within the band. We wanted to make something that sounded contemporary with the elements of a lot of early eras of pop music\\" explained Valentine. On the development of the album, Levine also commented, \\"Overexposed is definitely our most diverse and poppiest album yet. We had a great time recording it. I can't wait for our fans to hear the record, as well as hitting the road to play it live for everyone later this year.\\" In another interview for Rolling Stone, the singer revealed that is their most dance- driven album ever, commenting: \\"It's very much an old-fashioned disco tune. I have a love/hate relationship with it – but mostly I love it.\\" The album was executively produced by Max Martin, with additional tracks produced by Benny Blanco and Ryan Tedder. Tedder commented that the sound of the songs was very fresh and would affect kids. However, he further stated, \\"maintaining that interest — that's the hardest thing in the world.\\" Blanco explained that he and Levine first met during recording the song \\"Stereo Hearts\\" by Gym Class Heroes on which Levine is featured. The producer explained that when Levine heard the song he solely wanted in for himself on which Blanco responded that they will make another track for the band. After producing \\"Moves Like Jagger\\", he also worked on Overexposed and produced some songs including the lead single of the album, \\"Payphone\\". Although new collaborators were recruited to help in developing the album, Levine wrote all the songs with additional help from Valentine and produced a large portion of it, including the ballad \\"Sad\\". According to Valentine, the development of the song began one morning, when he woke up and \\"before he was even awake\\" he was at his living room's piano playing the melody. For an interview with MTV News, Levine told that \\"Sad\\" is his most personal track on the album, but didn't reveal the inspiration behind it. ==Composition== Influence and sound Overexposed is a pop and pop rock album with dance-pop, disco, electropop, R&B; and reggae influences. According to the band's official website, the album is \\"a chock- full collection of undeniable, anthemic melodies.\\" Multiple critics stated that \\"Moves Like Jagger\\" served as the biggest influence for composing and writing most songs on Overexposed. Additionally, they noted that the works by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna influenced the album's sound. Songs and lyrics The album's opening track, \\"One More Night\\", is an \\"irresistible sexy reggae jam\\" that features influences of pop and rock music. Lyrically, the storyline follows or being able to untangle from the particular love interest. The second track on the album, \\"Payphone\\" is a pop and R&B; song that contains hip hop beats and piano hooks. Featuring a verse by American rapper Wiz Khalifa, the song explores the way a relationship used to be in the past. \\"Daylight\\" is a soft rock song, that carries influence from the works of English band Coldplay. According to Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly, the song has choruses that are thickly produced and the only physical instrument that you can pick is Levine's larynx. \\"Lucky Strike\\" is a funk song that features dubstep and soul rock influences and lyrically discovers the theme of sexual intercourse. The fifth track on the album, \\"The Man Who Never Lied,\\" produced by Brian West, is a pop and pop rock song that finds the protagonist in a relationship trouble where he is playing the role of a good person. According to Nate Chinen of The New York Times, in the song, Levine sings \\"about spoiling his perfect record of honesty to spare a quarreling lover some hurtful feelings.\\" \\"Love Somebody\\" is the sixth track on the album; a dance-pop song it contains a Sly Stone-meets-Eurythmics synth hook. The funk-laden seventh song, \\"Ladykiller\\" features a guitar solo and an elastic funk groove, combined with Adam Levine's blue-eyed soul vocal and pleasing echoes of Hall & Oates. It was inspired by the work of American recording artist Michael Jackson, as noted by the reviewers of BBC Music and Virgin Media. The eighth song on the album, \\"Fortune Teller\\" has a pop tempo piano beat, that meshes with the song to provide a mix of emotions. The song gives a sort of \\"I want you, but I can't decide for you\\" feel. \\"Sad\\" is a piano ballad, which highlights Levine's soulful tone that his voice possesses. Nick Levine of NME labeled the song as \\"an Adele-apeing weepie\\". Lyrically, \\"Sad\\" is a song on which Levine \\"achingly\\" declares the end of his relationship and his heartbreak. The tenth track \\"Tickets\\" features twisting production that \\"comes through as a tight, techno-influenced pop song\\". According to a reviewer of Billboard, the song is reminiscent of Maroon 5's 2010 single \\"Give a Little More\\" and it has lyrics about someone being a snob. \\"Doin' Dirt\\" is a high-energy, beat-driven song, and a \\"a revved, funky club cut\\". Its verses talk about \\"horndog rhapsodies\\", with lyrics such as: \\"I light you up when I get inside\\". The final track on the album, \\"Beautiful Goodbye\\" was described as a \\"rhythmic ballad.\\" It's an acoustic ode that's bittersweet, but at the same time positive. Additional three tracks are present on the deluxe edition of Overexposed, including \\"Wipe Your Eyes\\", \\"Wasted Years\\" and \\"Kiss\\", a cover of the 1986 single by Prince and the Revolution. \\"Wipe Your Eyes\\" is a mid- tempo piano-driven ballad that contains a sample of the recording \\"Sabali\\" by the Mali musical duo Amadou & Mariam. ==Artwork== On April 10, 2012, the band debuted the artwork of the album on their official website. Created by the LA based art project Young & Sick, the cover art doesn't feature any images of Maroon 5 and is instead a colorful collage of illustrations seemingly inspired by the likes of Picasso and a range of modern cartoonists. According to Natalie Finn from E! News, \\"the psychedelic Beatles-dipped-in-Cream cover is a where-do-you-look-first wink at the pop-music world, which is so crowded with egos and images these days that it becomes almost impossible to just focus on the music.\\" Allison Bowsher of MuchMusic described the artwork as a combination of the 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles and illustrations of American show The Simpsons. The reviewer further noted that this is second time the band uses similar illustration the first one being on their 2002 debut album Songs About Jane. Jessica Sager from Pop Crush wrote, \\"the bright colors and cartoon images are representative of the album's themes.\\" Similarly, Rebecca Francois of Global Grind wrote that the artwork is like Maroon 5's music \\"fun and pop\\". Becky Bain of website Idolator, negatively reviewed the cover and wrote that \\"it is what an episode of The Simpsons looks like if you're on acid.\\" ==Singles== \\"Payphone\\" featuring Wiz Khalifa, was released as the lead single from the album on April 16, 2012. The song was received generally positive reviews from critics, they noted departure from older Maroon 5 songs. However, some them were praised of the music direction where the band has taken. Magazine Rolling Stone placed \\"Payphone\\" at number 46 on their list of 50 Best Songs of 2012. Commercially, the song reached number one on over eight national singles charts and peaked within the top-ten on 20 additional charts. \\"Payphone\\" reached number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the UK Singles Chart. It was the fifth best selling single of 2012 with over 9.1 million digital copies sold worldwide. The music video of \\"Payphone\\" premiered on May 9, 2012 on E! and was directed by Samuel Bayer.

On September 7, 2012, Adam Levine announced that the band would be extending the tour and play some more shows, starting in early 2013. Apparently, extra eight shows in Istanbul, Auckland, Bogota, Madrid, Warsaw, Caracas and Quito were planned, but this ultimately never came to fruition. On October 22, 2012, Levine revealed the U.S. tour dates and stated that Neon Trees and Owl City, will be supporting them throughout the U.S. tour. The tour ended on January 20, 2014 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. ==Critical reception== Overexposed received generally mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 54, based on 14 reviews. Evan Sawdey of PopMatters found it both interesting and flawed because of Maroon 5's attempt to pursue different ideas, which are ultimately unsuccessful. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian said that the album lacks memorable hooks and \\"charm\\", despite Maroon 5's collaboration with popular producers. Adam Markowitz of Entertainment Weekly felt that the lyrics are poorly written and that its production by several \\"pop kingpins\\" detracts from the band's performance, as the album does not consolidate its \\"rock grit and dance-pop glitz\\". musicOMH's Martyn Young wrote that Maroon 5's pop-produced direction exposes their limitations and lacks subtlety. Andy Gill of The Independent found the album dull, unimaginative, and marred by inarticulate \\"whoah-oh-oh\\" hooks. Nick Levine of NME panned Adam Levine's singing and called him \\"the sort of chump who thinks that he's a 'player' but then goes and writes a song called 'Ladykiller' about, erm, a girl.\\" Keith Harris of Spin found the album middling with \\"plaintive vulnerability\\" that lacks both distractions and highlights. In a positive review for Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield called Overexposed the band's best album yet and said that its first-rate, dulcet sound is complemented by sharp, womanizing lyrics. Nate Chinen of The New York Times felt that, although Levine sounds awkward when deviating from the slick style, the album further invests in their \\"glib\\" strengths, including Levine's supple voice. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, writing for AllMusic, said that the \\"briskly contemporary\\" album may not be as good as Hands All Over, but it will ensure the band's commercial momentum. American Songwriter magazine's Eric Allen believed that newer fans of the band from \\"today's beat oriented downloading musical culture\\" will be excited by Overexposed, although it may alienate their older fans and \\"music snobs\\". ==Commercial performance== Overexposed debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200, behind Linkin Park's Living Things, with sales of 222,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. A little over 1,000 copies sold separates the two titles. Living Things also kept the album from reaching number one in many other countries. Overexposed is the band's fourth studio album, and follows 2010's Hands All Over, which also peaked at number 2, selling 142,000 in its first week. Overexposed's start marks the band's best sales week for an album since 2007's It Won't Be Soon Before Long debuted at number one with 429,000 copies. In the second week, the album fell to number 4, with sales of 68,000 copies. It felling out of top 10 in its seventh week, but the album rose to number 5, in its eight- week, as the album benefits from Amazon MP3 sale priced for $3.99 on August 17, 2012. It sold 988,000 copies in the US in 2012, the 11th best-selling album of the year. As of August 2013, it has sold 1,431,000 copies in the US. At the end of 2012, the album has sold over 2 million copies worldwide. In Canada, the album debuted at number 3 on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 17,800 copies. The album has sold 30,000 copies in Brazil, being certified Gold. The album was certified Gold in Japan after selling 100,000+ copies. The album debuted at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart, selling 38,000 copies, becoming their third British bestseller. It was 3,000 copies behind of Linkin Park's Living Things, which debuted at number one with 41,000 copies. The album sold 263,000 copies in 2012 in the UK. ==Track listings== ;Notes * signifies an additional producer * signifies a co-producer *\\"Wipe Your Eyes\\" contains a sample of the recording \\"Sabali\\", written by Damon Albarn, Mariam Doumbia and Marc Moreau, and performed by Amadou & Mariam. *\\"Wasted Years\\" contains samples of \\"The Rill Thing\\", written and performed by \\"Little\\" Richard Penniman. ==Personnel== ;Maroon 5 * Adam Levine – lead and backing vocals, rhythm guitar, songwriting, production * Mickey Madden – bass guitar, songwriting * James Valentine – lead and rhythm guitar, backing vocals, sitar, keyboards, songwriting, production * Matt Flynn – drums, percussion * PJ Morton – keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals ;Additional musicians * Dan Omelio – guitars, keyboards, synthesizers, songwriting, production * Benny Blanco – guitars, keyboards, synthesizers, songwriting, production * Shellback – production, songwriting, guitars, keyboards, synthesizers, programming, drums, backing vocals * Max Martin – backing vocals, guitars, keyboards, songwriting, production * Ammar Malik – backing vocals, guitars, songwriting * Wiz Khalifa – rap (featured guest on \\"Payphone\\") * Brie Larson – backing vocals (tracks #3 & #10) * Savannah Buffett – backing vocals * Dan Keyes – backing vocals * Z Berg – backing vocals * Vanessa Long – backing vocals * Sam Farrar – production, programming, backing vocals * Mason \\"MdL\\" Levy – keyboards, drums, production * Ryan Tedder – keyboards, songwriting, production * Noel Zancanella – keyboards, songwriting, production * Brian \\"Sweetwesty\\" West – guitar, programming, songwriting, production * Noah \\"Mailbox\\" Passovoy – production, keyboards * David Silberstein – wine glasses * Scott Yarmovsky – wine glasses Based on the liner notes of Overexposed, A&M; Octone Records. ==Charts== Weekly charts style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !Chart (2012) !Peak position - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" Russian Albums Chart style=\\"text-align:center;\\"19 - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\"Taiwanese International Albums Chart style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1 - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" } Year-end charts style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !Chart (2012) !Position - !scope=\\"row\\"Australian Albums (ARIA)  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"24 - !scope=\\"row\\"Canadian Albums (Billboard)  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"18 - !scope=\\"row\\"Korean International Albums (Gaon)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"7 - !scope=\\"row\\"Mexican Albums (AMPROFON)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"32 - !scope=\\"row\\"Swiss Albums (Schweizer Hitparade)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"87 - !scope=\\"row\\"UK Albums (OCC)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"29 - !scope=\\"row\\"US Billboard 200  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"21 - } {class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - !Chart (2013) !Position - !scope=\\"row\\"US Billboard 200  22 } Decade-end charts { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\"  - ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2010–2019) ! scope=\\"col\\" Position - ! scope=\\"row\\" US Billboard 200  64 } ==Certifications== - - !scope=\\"row\\" Philippines (PARI) Gold 7,500^ - !scope=\\"row\\" South Korea (Gaon)  16,766 - - ==Release history== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Country ! scope=\\"col\\" Date ! scope=\\"col\\" Edition(s) ! scope=\\"col\\" Label - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Japan  June 20, 2012   rowspan=\\"7\\" Universal - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Portugal  June 21, 2012  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Australia  rowspan=\\"2\\" June 22, 2012  Standard (CD) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Germany  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  France  rowspan=\\"4\\" June 25, 2012  Standard (CD) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  South Korea  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  New Zealand  rowspan=\\"6\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\"  United Kingdom  Polydor - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Canada  rowspan=\\"4\\" June 26, 2012  rowspan=\\"2\\" Universal - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Italy - ! scope=\\"row\\"  United States  A&M;/Octone - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Spain  rowspan=\\"3\\" Universal - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Sweden  June 27, 2012  Standard - ! scope=\\"row\\"  China  September 1, 2012  Standard } ==References * Category:2012 albums Category:Maroon 5 albums Category:Albums produced by Max Martin Category:Albums produced by Benny Blanco Category:Albums produced by J.

It is the seat of the Bishop of Kilmore, and the mother church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kilmore. ==History== In 1152, the Diocese of Kilmore was formally established by Cardinal Giovanni Paparoni at the synod of Kells. In 1454, Pope Nicholas V gave permission for the ancient church at Kilmore (founded in the sixth century by Saint Felim) to be the cathedral church of Kilmore diocese. It was rebuilt and became known in Irish as An Chill Mhór (meaning Great Church) and anglicised as Kilmore, which gave its name to the diocese, a name which has remained ever since. During the Reformation, the Roman Catholic diocese lost possession of the cathedral and all the other temporalities and passed into the hands of the Church of Ireland. Following the completion of the new Anglican cathedral in 1860, the pre-Reformation cathedral became a Church of Ireland parochial hall. For almost 300 years the Roman Catholic diocese did not have a cathedral. In 1862, Cavan parish church was extended and it became the new cathedral of the diocese under Bishop James Browne. ==The Cathedral== In 1938 construction of the present cathedral began, and was completed in 1942 under Bishop Patrick Lyons. Ralph Byrne of W.H. Byrne & Son were the architects of the new cathedral. The plan layout is quite unorthodox for Irish churches. The nave is lined with columns which extend down both sides, and unusually turn to form what could appear to be the beginning of a rood screen. Meanwhile, the transepts form a strong line across the cathedral without being impacted by the nave. the altar is in a recess opposite the nave. The church is beautifully built in a white granite by John Sisk & Son at a total build cost of £209,000. Externally the cathedral is dominated by a classical portico surmounted by a tower. The cathedral was dedicated to Saint Patrick and Saint Felim in 1942 and consecrated in 1947. ==Leaded Glass== There are artistic stained glass windows by George Collie.National inventory of Architectural Heritage Six stained glass windows from the studios of Harry Clarke were added to the cathedral in 1994. ==Sculpture== Some of the sculpture work was undertaken by Albert Power. ==Commentaries== The design of the cathedral has not been well received by commentators. \\"The cathedral is a disappointing sham-Renaissance structure by Ralph Byrne.\\" Lord Kilanin & Michael V.

In 2006 he was dismissed from his job with the public health service and arrested after reporting on an outbreak of dengue fever. Since then he has been repeatedly arrested for his human rights activities. Until 2006 Guillermo Espinosa Rodríguez worked as a nurse in the public health service and as a part-time reporter. In October 2005 Espinosa Rodríguez filed a report on an event in Santiago de Cuba attended by 20,000 young people as part of a campaign for the prevention of AIDS. Police tried to remove a participant, but were forced to retreat when the crowd turned against them. In July 2006 Espinosa submitted reports on an outbreak of dengue fever in Santiago de Cuba to the independent agency Agencia de Prensa Libre Oriental (APLO). Shortly afterwards he was dismissed from his job. Cuba suppresses reports of epidemics to avoid disturbing the tourists. Before Espinosa published his reports, the official media had refused to recognize the existence of dengue fever in Cuba. The reports seem to have triggered his arrest. Espinosa Rodríguez was arrested in October 2006 along with Armando Betancourt Reina and Raymundo Perdigon Brito. In November 2006 he was convicted under article 72 of the Cuban Penal Code in a Santiago de Cuba court on grounds of \\"social dangerousness.\\" He was sentenced to two years of home confinement. Although he had lost his job with the public health service, Espinosa was told he should find another job with a government department or he would have to serve his house arrest in jail. In a call for Espinosa's release on 8 November 2006, Reporters Without Borders noted that \\"social dangerousness\\" meant he might commit a crime although he had not in fact committed any. The authorities could use this charge to imprison anyone they wanted to. In a press release on 29 January 2007 the Office of the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights noted that Espinosa had been jailed and said it \\"reiterates its great concern over the systematic and continuous situation of utter and complete disrespect for freedom of thought and expression in Cuba.\\" In March 2009 Espinosa was working for the Center of Applied Marketing and Political Publicity in Santiago de Cuba. He was detained and then placed under house arrest for his activities on the sixth anniversary of the arrest of 75 activists in the \\"Black Spring\\" of 2003. In February 2011 Espinosa was detained for commemorating the death of Orlando Zapata, a political prisoner, one year earlier. He was one of many arrested during marches held across the country. In April 2012 during a papal mass in Santiago de Cuba a dissident named Andrés Carrión Alvarez shouted \\"down with communism\\" and was promptly arrested. A scuffle broke out, and Carrión was attacked by a Red Cross stretcher bearer. Espinosa went to Carrión's aid, and was himself arrested for \\"contempt of authority\\". At the time, Espinosa was under house arrest for three years for his pro-democracy activities. ==References== Category:Cuban journalists Category:Male journalists Category:Cuban bloggers Category:Cuban male writers Category:Living people Category:People from Santiago de Cuba Category:Cuban nurses Category:Male bloggers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Guillermo Espinosa Rodríguez"},{"id":"35231483","text":"Kevin McCurley (2 April 1926 – May 2000) was an English professional footballer who played as a forward. ==Career== Born in Consett, McCurley began his career with non-league Worthing.

The LP marked a change in the hard rock sound from the singer's previous albums Suzi Quatro and Quatro, instead displaying a more funk-oriented rock sound. The title track reached No. 31 on the UK singles chart in February 1975. The album's second single, \\"I Bit off More Than I Could Chew\\", also reached the charts, peaking at 54 in the UK charts. \\"Michael\\" also had limited promotion, being released as a single in some territories, including Australia where the song reached the top 100.

C.(2008). Work motivation in organizational behavior (2nd edition). New York: Psychology Press Understanding what motivates an organization's employees is central to the study of I–O psychology. Motivation is a person's internal disposition to be concerned with and approach positive incentives and avoid negative incentives. To further this, an incentive is the anticipated reward or aversive event available in the environment.Deckers, L. (2010). Motivation; Biological, Psychological and Environmental. (3rd ed., pp. 2–3). Boston, MA: Pearson. While motivation can often be used as a tool to help predict behavior, it varies greatly among individuals and must often be combined with ability and environmental factors to actually influence behavior and performance. Results from a 2012 study, which examined age-related differences in work motivation, suggest a \\"shift in people's motives\\" rather than a general decline in motivation with age. That is, it seemed that older employees were less motivated by extrinsically related features of a job, but more by intrinsically rewarding job features.Inceoglu, I., Segers, J., & Bartram, D (2012). Age-related differences in work motivationJournal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 85(2), 300-329. Work motivation is strongly influenced by certain cultural characteristics. Between countries with comparable levels of economic development, collectivist countries tend to have higher levels of work motivation than do countries that tend toward individualism. Similarly measured, higher levels of work motivation can be found in countries that exhibit a long versus a short-term orientation. Also, while national income is not itself a strong predictor of work motivation, indicators that describe a nation’s economic strength and stability, such as life expectancy, are. Work motivation decreases as a nation’s long term economic strength increases.Klonoski, R. (2011). Work motivation, culture, and economic development: Is work motivation shaped by its socio-economic context? International Journal of Management & Information Systems, 15(4), 91-97. Currently work motivation research has explored motivation that may not be consciously driven. This method goal setting is referred to as goal priming. Effects of primed subconscious goals in addition to goals that are consciously set related to job performance have been studied by Stajkovic, Latham, Sergent, and Peterson, who conducted research on a CEO of a for-profit business organization using goal priming to motivate job performance. Goal priming refers to the achievement of a goal by external cues given. These cues can affect information processing and behaviour the pursuit of this goal. In this study, the goal was primed by the CEO using achievement related words strategy placed in emails to employees. This seemingly small gesture alone not only cost the CEO very little money, but it increased objectively measured performance efficiency by 35% and effectiveness by 15% over the course of a 5 day work week. There has been controversy about the true efficacy of this work as to date, only four goal priming experiments have been conducted. However, the results of these studies found support for the hypothesis that primed goals do enhance performance in a for-profit business organization setting. It is important for organizations to understand and to structure the work environment to encourage productive behaviors and discourage those that are unproductive given work motivation's role in influencing workplace behavior and performance.Jex, S.M. & Britt, T.W. (2008). Organizational Psychology. Hoboke, New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.Mitchell, T.R.; Daniels, D. 2003. Motivation. Handbook of Psychology, Vol. 12. Industrial Organizational Psychology, ed. W.C. Borman, D.R. Ilgen, R.J. Klimoski, pp. 225–54. New York: Wiley. Motivational systems are at the center of behavioral organization.Emmons 1999; Steers, Mowday & Shapiro, 2004; Schein, 1980; and Knopf, 1967 Emmons states, “Behavior is a discrepancy-reduction process, whereby individuals act to minimize the discrepancy between their present condition and a desired standard or goal” (1999, p. 28). If we look at this from the standpoint of how leaders can motivate their followers to enhance their performance, participation in any organization involves exercising choice; a person chooses among alternatives, responding to the motivation to perform or ignore what is offered. This suggests that a follower’s consideration of personal interests and the desire to expand knowledge and skill has significant motivational impact, requiring the leader to consider motivating strategies to enhance performance.\\"Casteli,P., Castronova, F, Stavros, J. Galloway, J.(2007) Leaders and Followers: The Role of Achievement Motives and Their Effects on Motivating Strategies for Enhancing Performance, pg. 3. There is general consensus that motivation involves three psychological processes: arousal, direction, and intensity. Arousal is what initiates action. It is fueled by a person's need or desire for something that is missing from their lives at a given moment, either totally or partially. Direction refers to the path employees take in accomplishing the goals they set for themselves. Finally, intensity is the vigor and amount of energy employees put into this goal-directed work performance. The level of intensity is based on the importance and difficulty of the goal. These psychological processes result in four outcomes. First, motivation serves to direct attention, focusing on particular issues, people, tasks, etc. It also serves to stimulate an employee to put forth effort. Next, motivation results in persistence, preventing one from deviating from the goal-seeking behavior. Finally, motivation results in task strategies, which as defined by Mitchell & Daniels, are \\"patterns of behavior produced to reach a particular goal. ==Theories== A number of various theories attempt to describe employee motivation within the discipline of I–O psychology. Most of these theories can be divided into the four broad categories of need-based, cognitive process, behavioral, and job-based. Need-based theories Need-based theories of motivation focus on an employee's drive to satisfy a variety of needs through their work. These needs range from basic physiological needs for survival to higher psychoemotional needs like belonging and self-actualization. Maslow's hierarchy of needs An interpretation of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, represented as a pyramid with the more basic needs at the bottom. Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (1943) was applied to offer an explanation of how the work environment motivates employees. In accordance with Maslow's theory, which was not specifically developed to explain behavior in the workplace, employees strive to satisfy their needs in a hierarchical order. At the most basic level, an employee is motivated to work in order to satisfy basic physiological needs for survival, such as having enough money to purchase food. The next level of need in the hierarchy is safety, which could be interpreted to mean adequate housing or living in a safe neighborhood. The next three levels in Maslow's theory relate to intellectual and psycho- emotional needs: love and belonging, esteem (which refers to competence and mastery), and finally the highest order need, self-actualization. Although Maslow's theory is widely known, in the workplace it has proven to be a poor predictor of employee behavior. Maslow theorized that people will not seek to satisfy a higher level need until their lower level needs are met. There has been little empirical support for the idea that employees in the workplace strive to meet their needs only in the hierarchical order prescribed by Maslow. Building on Maslow's theory, Clayton Alderfer (1959) collapsed the levels in Maslow's theory from five to three: existence, relatedness and growth. This theory, called the ERG theory, does not propose that employees attempt to satisfy these needs in a strictly hierarchical manner. Empirical support for this theory has been mixed. Need for achievement Atkinson & McClelland's Need for Achievement Theory is the most relevant and applicable need-based theory in the I–O psychologist's arsenal. Unlike other need-based theories, which try to interpret every need, Need for Achievement allows the I–O psychologist to concentrate research into a tighter focus. Studies show those who have a high need for achievement prefer moderate levels of risk, seek feedback, and are likely to immerse themselves in their work. Achievement motivation can be broken down into three types: *Achievement – seeks position advancement, feedback, and sense of accomplishment *Authority – need to lead, make an impact and be heard by others *Affiliation – need for friendly social interactions and to be liked. Because most individuals have a combination of these three types (in various proportions), an understanding of these achievement motivation characteristics can be a useful assistance to management in job placement, recruitment, etc.McClelland, D. (1965). Toward a theory of motive acquisition. American Psychologist, 20, 321–33. The theory is referred to as Need for Achievement because these individuals are theorized to be the most effective employees and leaders in the workplace. These individuals strive to achieve their goals and advance in the organization. They tend to be dedicated to their work and strive hard to succeed. Such individuals also demonstrate a strong desire for increasing their knowledge and for feedback on their performance, often in the form of performance appraisal . The Need for Achievement is in many ways similar to the need for mastery and self-actualization in Maslow's hierarchy of needs and growth in the ERG theory. The achievement orientation has garnered more research interest as compared to the need for affiliation or power. Cognitive process theories Equity theory Equity Theory is derived from social exchange theory. It explains motivation in the workplace as a cognitive process of evaluation, whereby the employee seeks to achieve a balance between inputs or efforts in the workplace and the outcomes or rewards received or anticipated. In particular, Equity Theory research has tested employee sentiments regarding equitable compensation. Employee inputs take the form of work volume and quality, performance, knowledge, skills, attributes and behaviors. The company-generated outcomes include rewards such as compensation, praise and advancement opportunities. The employee compares their inputs relative to outcomes; and, then, extrapolating to the social context, the employee compares their input/outcome ratio with the perceived ratios of others. If the employee perceives an inequity, the theory posits that the employee will adjust their behavior to bring things into balance. Equity Theory has proven relevance in situations where an employee is under- compensated. If an employee perceives that they are under-compensated, they can adjust their behavior to achieve equilibrium in several different ways: * reduce input to a level they believe better matches their level of compensation * change or adjust the comparative standard to which they are comparing their situation * cognitively adjust their perception of their inputs or the outcomes received * withdraw * ask their employer for increased compensation * engage in employee theft If the employee is able to achieve a ratio of inputs to outputs that they perceive to be equitable, then the employee will be satisfied. The employee's evaluation of input-to-output ratios and subsequent striving to achieve equilibrium is an ongoing process. While it has been established that Equity Theory provides insight into scenarios of under-compensation, the theory has generally failed to demonstrate its usefulness in understanding scenarios of overcompensation.Ambrose, M. & Kulik, C. (1999). Old friends, new faces: Motivation research in the 1990s. Journal of Management, 25(3), 231–92. In this way, it could be said Equity Theory is more useful in describing factors that contribute to a lack of motivation rather than increasing motivation in the workplace. Concepts of organizational justice later expanded upon the fundamentals of Equity Theory and pointed to the importance of fairness perceptions in the workplace. There are four fairness perceptions applied to organizational settings: # Distributive justice, or the perception of equality of an individual's outcomes # Procedural justice, or the fairness of the procedures used to determine one's outcomes # Interactional justice, or the perception that one has been treated fairly with dignity and respect # Informational Justice, or the perception that one has been given all the information one needs in order to best perform their jobs When workplace processes are perceived as fair, the benefits to an organization can be high. In such environments, employees are more likely to comply with policies even if their personal outcome is less than optimal. When workplace policies are perceived as unfair, risks for retaliation and related behaviors such as sabotage and workplace violence can increase. Leventhal (1980) described six criteria for creating fair procedures in an organization. He proposed that procedures and policies should be: # consistently applied to everyone in the organization # free from bias # accurate # correctable # representative of all concerns # based on prevailing ethics Expectancy theory According to Vroom's Expectancy Theory, an employee will work smarter and/or harder if they believe their additional efforts will lead to valued rewards. Expectancy theory explains this increased output of effort by means of the equation whereas: F (Effort or Motivational Force) = Effort the employee will expend to achieve the desired performance; E (Expectancy) = Belief that effort will result in desired level of performance; I (Instrumentality) = Belief that desired level of performance will result in desired outcome; V (Valence) = Value of the outcome to the employee Expectancy theory has been shown to have useful applications in designing a reward system. If policies are consistently, clearly and fairly implemented, then the instrumentality would be high. If the rewards are substantial enough to be meaningful to an employee, then the valence would be also considered high. A precursor to motivation is that the employee finds the reward(s) attractive. In some instances, the reward or outcome might inadvertently be unattractive, such as increased workload or demanding travel that may come with a promotion. In such an instance, the valence might be lower for individuals who feel work–life balance is important, for example. Expectancy theory posits employee satisfaction to be an outcome of performance rather than the cause of performance. However, if a pattern is established whereas an employee understands his performance will lead to certain desired rewards, an employee's motivation can be strengthened based on anticipation.Lawler, E.E. & Jenkins, G.D. (1992). Strategic reward systems. In M.D. Dunnette and L.M. Hough (eds.), Handbook of industrial and organizational psychology (2nd ed., 1009–55). Palo Alto, CA: Consulting Psychologists Pres If the employees foresee a high probability that they can successfully carry out a desired behavior, and that their behavior will lead to a valued outcome, then they will direct their efforts toward that end. Expectancy theory has been shown to have greater validity in research in within-subject designs rather than between-subjects designs. That is, it is more useful in predicting how an employee might choose among competing choices for their time and energy, rather than predicting the choices two different employees might make. Goal-setting theory An I–O psychologist can assist an employer in designing task-related goals for their employees that are * attainable * specific * appropriately difficult, * feedback providing in hopes of rousing tunnel vision focus in the employees.Locke, E.A. & Latham, G.P. (1990). A theory of goal setting and task performance. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice- Hall. Following S.M.A.R.T criteria is also suggested. {  ! Letter ! Major Term !

(1992). An examination of the relationships among monetary incentives, goal level, goal commitment, and performance. Journal of Management, 18, 677–93. However, because of the tunnel vision focus created by goal-setting theory, several studies have shown this motivational theory may not be applicable in all situations. In fact, in tasks that require creative on-the-spot improvising, goal-setting can even be counterproductive.Staw, B.M. & Boettger, R.D. (1990). Task revision: A neglected form of work performance. Academy of Management Journal, 33, 534–59. Furthermore, because clear goal specificity is essential to a properly designed goal-setting task, multiple goals can create confusion for the employee and the end result is a muted overall drive.Gilliland, S.W. & Landis, R.S. (1992). Quality and quantity goals in a complex decision task: Strategies and outcomes. Journal of Applied Psychology, 77, 672–81. Despite its flaws, Goal-setting Theory is arguably the most dominant theory in the field of I–O psychology; over one thousand articles and reviews published in just over thirty years.Latham, G. & Pinder, C. (2005). Work motivation theory and research at the dawn of the twenty-first century. Annual Review of Psychology, 56, 485–516. Locke suggested several reasons why goals are motivating: they direct attention, lead to task persistence and the development of task strategies for accomplishing the goal. In order for a goal to be motivating, the employee or work group must first accept the goal. While difficult goals can be more motivating, a goal still needs to appear achievable, which in turn will lead to greater goal acceptance. The person or group should have the necessary skills and resources to achieve the goal, or goal acceptance could be negatively impacted. Specific goals that set a performance expectation are more motivating than those that are vague. Similarly, more proximal goals have greater motivation impact than those that are very long range or distal goals. There are three types of factors that influence goal commitment: * External- The external factors that affect it are authority, peer influence and external rewards. Complying with the dictates of an authority figure such as boss has been shown to be an inducement to high goal commitment. Goal commitment increases when the authority figure is physically present, supportive, pay increases, peer pressure and external rewards. * Interactive- The factors that influence commitment here are competition and the opportunity to participate in setting goals. It has been shown to be an inducement to setting higher goals and working harder to reach them. * Internal- these come from self- administered rewards and the expectation of success. The commitment decreases when the expectation to achieve is decreased. From: Psychology and Work Today by Schultz and Schultz. Feedback while the employee or group is striving for the goal is seen as crucial. Feedback keeps employees on track and reinforces the importance of the goal as well as supporting the employees in adjusting their task strategies. Goal-setting Theory has strong empirical support dating back thirty years. However, there are some boundary conditions that indicate in some situations, goal-setting can be detrimental to performance on certain types of tasks. Goals require a narrowing of one's focus, so for more complex or creative tasks, goals can actually inhibit performance because they demand cognitive resources. Similarly, when someone is learning a new task, performance-related goals can distract from the learning process. During the learning process, it may be better to focus on mastering the task than achieving a particular result. Finally, too many goals can become distracting and counterproductive, especially if they conflict with one another. Social cognitive theory Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory is another cognitive process theory that offers the important concept of self-efficacy for explaining employee's level of motivation relative to workplace tasks or goals. Self-efficacy is an individual's belief in their ability to achieve results in a given scenario. Empirically, studies have shown a strong correlation between self-efficacy and performance. The concept has been extended to group efficacy, which is a group's belief that it can achieve success with a given task or project. Self-efficacy is seen to mediate important aspects of how an employee undertakes a given task, such as the level of effort and persistence. An employee with high self-efficacy is confident that effort they put forth has a high likelihood of resulting in success. In anticipation of success, an employee is willing to put forth more effort, persist longer, remain focused on the task, seek feedback and choose more effective task strategies. The antecedents of self-efficacy may be influenced by expectations, training or past experience and requires further research. It has been shown that setting high expectations can lead to improved performance, known as the Pygmalion effect. Low expectations can lower self-efficacy and is referred to as the golem effect. Relative to training, a mastery-oriented approach has been shown to be an effective way to bolster self-efficacy. In such an approach, the goal of training is to focus on mastering skills or tasks rather than focusing on an immediate performance- related outcome. Individuals who believe that mastery can be achieved through training and practice are more likely to develop greater self-efficacy than those who see mastery as a product of inherent talent than is largely immutable. Major concepts of Social Cognitive Theory correlated with the effect of individual behavior change: *Self-efficacy, or an individual’s confidence in accomplishing a behavior *Behavioral capability, or knowledge and skill to execute a behavior *Expectations, or anticipation of outcomes of a behavior *Expectancies, or giving values to the outcome of behavior change *Self-control, or regulating behavior or performance *Observational learning, or watching the actions and outcomes performed by others *Reinforcements, or encouraging motivations and rewards to promote behavior change Behavioral approach to motivation The behavioral approach to workplace motivation is known as Organizational Behavioral Modification. This approach applies the tenets of behaviorism developed by B.F. Skinner to promote employee behaviors that an employer deems beneficial and discourage those that are not. Any stimulus that increases the likelihood of a behavior increasing is a reinforcer. An effective use of positive reinforcement would be frequent praise while an employee is learning a new task. An employee's behavior can also be shaped during the learning process if approximations of the ideal behavior are praised or rewarded. The frequency of reinforcement is an important consideration. While frequent praise during the learning process can be beneficial, it can be hard to sustain indefinitely. A variable-ratio schedule of reinforcement, where the frequency of reinforcement varies unpredictably, also can be highly effective if used in instances where it is ethical to do so. Providing praise on a variable-ratio schedule would be appropriate, whereas paying an employee on an unpredictable variable-ratio schedule would not be. Compensation and other reward programs provide behavioral reinforcement, and if carefully crafted, can provide powerful incentives to employees. Behavioral principles can also be used to address undesirable behaviors in the workplace, but punishment should be used judiciously. If overused, punishment can negatively impact employee's perception of fairness in the workplace. In general, the less time that elapses between a behavior and its consequence, the more impactful a consequence is likely to be. Job-based theories The job-based theories hold that the key to motivation is within an employee's job itself. Generally, these theories say that jobs can be motivating by their very design. This is a particularly useful view for organizations, because the practices set out in the theories can be implemented more practically in an organization. Ultimately, according to the job-based theories, the key to finding motivation through one's job is being able to derive satisfaction from the job content. Motivation–hygiene theory Herzberg's Motivation–Hygiene Theory holds that the content of a person's job is the primary source of motivation. In other words, he argued against the commonly held belief that money and other compensation is the most effective form of motivation to an employee. Instead, Herzberg posed that high levels of what he dubbed hygiene factors (pay, job security, status, working conditions, fringe benefits, job policies, and relations with co-workers) could only reduce employee dissatisfaction (not create satisfaction). Motivation factors (level of challenge, the work itself, responsibility, recognition, advancement, intrinsic interest, autonomy, and opportunities for creativity) however, could stimulate satisfaction within the employee, provided that minimum levels of the hygiene factors were reached. For an organization to take full advantage of Herzberg's theory, they must design jobs in such a way that motivators are built in, and thus are intrinsically rewarding. While the Motivation–Hygiene Theory was the first to focus on job content, it has not been strongly supported through empirical studies. Frederick Herzberg also came up with the concept of job enrichment, which expands jobs to give employees a greater role in planning, performing, and evaluating their work, thus providing the chance to satisfy their motivators needs. Some suggested ways would be to remove some management control, provide regular and continuously feedback. Proper job enrichment, therefore, involves more than simply giving the workers extra tasks to perform. It means expanding the level of knowledge and skills needed to perform the job. Job characteristics theory Shortly after Herzberg's Two-factor theory, Hackman and Oldham contributed their own, more refined, job-based theory; Job characteristic theory (JCT). JCT attempts to define the association between core job dimensions, the critical psychological states that occur as a result of these dimensions, the personal and work outcomes, and growth-need strength. Core job dimensions are the characteristics of a person's job. The core job dimensions are linked directly to the critical psychological states. The Job Characteristics Model (JCM), as designed by Hackman and Oldham attempts to use job design to improve employee intrinsic motivation. They show that any job can be described in terms of five key job characteristics:J.R. Hackman and G.R. Oldham. Work Redesign. Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Pearson Education, Inc, 1980; pp 78-80.Katz, Ralph. Motivating Technical Professionals Today. IEEE Engineering Management Review, Vol. 41, No. 1, March 2013, pp. 28-38 According to the JCT, an organization that provides workers with sufficient levels of skill variety (using different skills and talents in performing work), task identity (contributing to a clearly identifiable larger project), and task significance (impacting the lives or work of other people) is likely to have workers who feel their work has meaning and value. Sufficiently high levels of autonomy (independence, freedom and discretion in carrying out the job) will inspire the worker to feel responsibility for the work; and sufficiently high levels of Task Feedback (receiving timely, clear, specific, detailed, actionable information about the effectiveness of their job performance) will inspire the worker to feel the organization is authentically interested in helping to foster their professional development and growth. The combined effect of these psychological states results in desired personal and work outcomes: intrinsic motivation, job satisfaction, performance quality, low absenteeism, and low turnover rate. Lastly, the glue of this theory is the \\"growth-need strength\\" factor which ultimately determines the effectiveness of the core job dimensions on the psychological states, and likewise the effectiveness of the critical psychological states on the affective outcomes. Further analysis of Job Characteristics Theory can be found in the Work Design section below. Hackman and Oldman created the Job Diagnostic Survey (JDS) which measures three parts of their theory. #Employees views of the job characteristics #The level of growth needed by each employee #Employees overall job satisfaction JDS is the most frequently and commonly used tool to measure job and work design. JDS is a self-report which has small detailed phrases for the different job characteristics. An employee will be asked to fill out the JDS and rate how precise each statement describes their job. Self-regulation theory A theory based in self-efficacy, Self Regulation is \\"A theory of motivation based on the setting of goals and the receipt of accurate feedback that is monitored to enhance the likelihood of goal attainment\\".Munchinsky, Paul M. (2012). Psychology Applied to Work. Summerfield, North Carolina: Hypergraph Press, Inc. It is presumed that people consciously set goals for themselves that guide and direct their behavior toward the attainment of these goals. These people also engage in self-monitoring or self-evaluation. Self- evaluation can be helped along if feedback is given when a person is working on their goals because it can align how a person feels about how they are doing to achieve a goal and what they are actually doing to achieve their goals. In short, feedback provides an \\"error\\" message that a person who is off-track can reevaluate their goal. This theory has been linked to Goal setting and Goal Setting Theory, which has been mentioned above. Work engagement A new approach to work motivation is the idea of Work Engagement or \\"A conception of motivation whereby individuals are physically immersed in emotionally and intellectually fulfilling work.\\" This theory draws on many aspects of I/O Psychology. This theory proposes that motivation taps into energy where it allows a person to focus on a task. According to Schaufeli and BakkerSchaufeli, W. B., & Bakker, A. B. (2010), Defining and measuring work engagement:Bringing clarity to the concept. In A.B. Bakker & M.P. Leither (Eds.) 'work engagement:A handbook of essential theory and research' (pp10-24). New York: Psychological Press there are three dimensions to work engagement. *Vigor- a sense of personal energy for work *Dedication- experiencing a sense of pride in one's work and challenge from it *Absorption- The Capacity to be engrossed in work and experiencing a sense of flow. Work Engagement forwards the notion that individuals have the ability to contribute more to their own productivity than organizations typically allow. An example would be to allow workers to take some risks and not punish them if the risks leads to unsuccessful outcomes. \\"In short, work engagement can be thought of as an interaction of individuals and work. Engagement can occur when both facilitate each other, and engagement will not occur when either (or both) thwarts each other.\\" Some critics of work engagement say that this is nothing new, just \\"old wine in a new bottle.\\" ==Applications of motivation== Organizational reward systems Organizational reward systems have a significant impact on employees' level of motivation. Rewards can be either tangible or intangible. Various forms of pay, such as salary, commissions, bonuses, employee ownership programs and various types of profit or gain sharing programs, are all important tangible rewards. While fringe benefits have a positive impact on attraction and retention, their direct impact on motivation and performance is not well-defined. Salaries play a crucial role in the tangible reward system. They are an important factor in attracting new talent to an organization as well as retaining talent. Compensating employees well is one way for an organization to reinforce an employee's value to the organization. If an organization is known for paying their employees top dollar, then they may develop a positive reputation in the job market as a result. Through incentive compensation structures, employees can be guided to focus their attention and efforts on certain organizational goals. The goals that are reinforced through incentive pay should be carefully considered to make sure they are in alignment with the organizational objectives. If there are multiple rewards programs, it is important to consider if there might be any conflicting goals. For example, individual and team-based rewards can sometime work at cross-purposes. Important forms of intangible rewards include praise, recognition and rewards. Intangible rewards are ones from which an employee does not derive any material gain. Such rewards have the greatest impact when they soon follow the desired behavior and are closely tied to the performance. If an organization wants to use praise or other intangible rewards effectively, praise should be offered for a high level of performance and for things that they employee has control over. Some studies have shown that praise can be as effective as tangible rewards. Other forms of intangible performance include status symbols, such as a corner office, and increased autonomy and freedom. Increased autonomy demonstrates trust in an employee, may decrease occupational stress and improve job satisfaction. A 2010 study found positive relationships between job satisfaction and life satisfaction, happiness at work, positive affect, and the absence of negative affect which may also be interrelated with work motivation.Bowling, K., Eschleman, J., & Wang, Q (2010). A meta-analytic examination of the relationship between job satisfaction and subjective well-being. Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 83(4), 915-934. Since it may be hard for an employee to achieve a similar level of trust in a new organization, increased autonomy may also help improve retention. Motivation through design of work Reward-based systems are certainly the more common practice for attempting to influence motivation within an organization, but some employers strive to design the work itself to be more conducive. There are multiple ways an organization can leverage job design principles to increase motivation. Three of the predominant approaches will be discussed here: the Humanistic Approach, the Job Characteristics Approach, and the Interdisciplinary Approach. ;Humanistic Approach The Humanistic Approach to job design was a reaction to \\"worker dissatisfaction over Scientific Management\\" and focused on providing employees with more input and an opportunity to maximize their personal achievement as referenced by Jex and Britt. Jobs should also provide intellectual stimulation, opportunities for creativity, and greater discretion over work-related activities. Two approaches used in the Humanistic Approach to job design are job rotation and job enrichment. Job rotation allows employees to switch to different jobs which allows them to learn new skills and provides them with greater variety. According to Jex and Britt, this would be most effective for simple jobs that can become mundane and boring over time. Job enrichment is focused on leveraging those aspects of jobs that are labeled motivators, such as control, intellectual challenge, and creativity. The most common form of job enrichment is vertical loading where additional tasks or discretion enhances the initial job design. While there is some evidence to support that job enrichment improves motivation, it is important to note that it is not effective for all people. Some employees are not more motivated by enriched jobs. ;Job Characteristics Approach The Job Characteristics Approach to job design is based on how core dimensions affect motivation. These dimensions include autonomy, variety, significance, feedback, and identity. The goal of JCT job design is to utilize specific interventions in an effort to enhance these core dimensions. # Vertical Loading – Like the tactic used in the Humanistic Job Enrichment approach, this intervention is designed to enhance autonomy, task identity, task significance, and skill variety by increasing the number of tasks and providing greater levels of control over how those tasks are completed. # Task Combination – By combining tasks into larger units of work and responsibility, task identity may be improved. # Natural Work Units – A form of task combination that represents a logical body of work and responsibility that may enhance both task significance and task identity. # Establishing Client Relationships – Designs interactions between employees and customers, both internal and external, to enhance task identity, feedback, and task significance. This is accomplished by improving the visibility of beneficial effects on customers. # Feedback – By designing open feedback channels, this intervention attempts to increase the amount and value of feedback received. The process of designing work so as to enhance individual motivation to perform the work is called Job enrichment While the JCT approach to job design has a significant impact on job satisfaction, the effects on performance are more mixed. Much of the success of implementation of JCT practices is dependent on the organization carefully planning interventions and changes to ensure impact throughout the organization is anticipated. Many companies may have difficulty implementing JCT changes throughout the organization due to its high cost and complexity. ;Interdisciplinary Approach One of the most recent approaches to work design, the Interdisciplinary Approach is based on the use of careful assessment of current job design, followed by a cost/benefit analysis, and finally changes based on the area in which a job is lacking. The assessment is conducted using the Multi-method Job Design Questionnaire, which is used to determine if the job is deficient in the areas of motivational, mechanistic, biological, or perceptual motor support. Motivational improvements are aligned with the Job Characteristics theory dimensions. Mechanistic improvements are focused on improving the efficiency of the job design. Biological improvements focus on improvements to ergonomics, health conditions, and employee comfort. Finally, perceptual motor improvements focus on the nature and presentation of the information an employee must work with. If improvements are identified using the questionnaire, the company then evaluates the cost of making the improvements and determines if the potential gains in motivation and performance justify those costs. Because of the analysis and cost/benefit components of the Interdisciplinary Approach, it is often less costly for organizations and implementations can be more effective. Only changes deemed to be appropriate investments are made, thus improving motivation, productivity, and job satisfaction while controlling costs. ==Other factors affecting motivation== Creativity On the cutting edge of research pertaining to motivation in the workplace is the integration of motivation and creativity. Essentially, according to Ambrose and Kulik, the same variables that predict intrinsic motivation are associated with creativity. This is a helpful conclusion in that organizations can measure and influence both creativity and motivation simultaneously. Further, allowing employees to choose creative and challenging jobs/tasks has been shown to improve motivation. Malmelin and Virta indicate creating new processes or procedures goes along with the jobs/task.Malmelin & Virta (2016). Managing creativity in change: Motivations and constrains of creative work in a media organization. Journalism Pratice. In order to increase creativity, setting \\"creativity goals\\" can positively influence the process, along with allowing more autonomy (i.e., giving employees freedom to feel/be creative). Other studies have found that team support may enable more creativity in a group setting,West, M.; Anderson, N. (1996). Innovation in top management teams. Journal of Applied Psychology, 81, 680–93. also increasing motivation. Keeping creative employees productive and satisfied could be the key to retaining even the most difficult employees.Chamorro-Premuzic, Tomas; Seven rules for managing creative-but-difficult people. HBR Groups and teams As the workplace is changing to include more group-based systems, researching motivation within these groups is of growing importance. To date, a great amount of research has focused on the Job characteristic theory and the Goal-setting Theory. While more research is needed that draws on a broader range of motivation theories, research thus far has concluded several things: (a) semi-autonomous groups report higher levels of job scope (related to intrinsic job satisfaction), extrinsic satisfaction, and organizational commitment; and (b) developmentally mature teams have higher job motivation and innovation. Further, voluntarily formed work teams report high work motivation. Though research shows that appropriate goal-setting influences group motivation and performance, more research is needed in this area (group goals, individual goals, cohesiveness, etc.). There are inseparable mediating variables consisting of group cohesiveness, commitment, and performance. As the workplace environment calls for more and more teams to be formed, research into motivation of teams is ever-pressing. Thus far, overarching research merely suggests that individual-level and team-level sources of motivation are congruent with each other.Kozlowski, S. & Bell, B. (2003). Work groups and teams in organizations. Handbook of Psychology (12): Industrial and Organizational Psychology, 333–75. Consequently, research should be expanded to apply more theories of motivation; look at group dynamics; and essentially conclude how groups can be most impacted to increase motivation and, consequently, performance. Culture Organizational cultures can be broken down into three groups: Strong, Strategically Appropriate, and Adaptive.Kotter, J. & Heskett, J. (1992). Corporate Culture and Performance. New York, NY: The Free Press. Each has been identified with high performing organizations and has particular implications on motivation in the workplace. ;Strength The most widely reported effect of culture on performance is that strong cultures result in high performance. The three reasons for this are goal alignment, motivation, and the resulting structure provided. Goal alignment is driven by the proposed unified voice that drives employees in the same direction. Motivation comes from the strength of values and principles in such a culture. And structure is provided by these same attributes which obviate the need for formal controls that could stifle employees. There are questions that concern researchers about causality and the veracity of the driving voice of a strong culture. ;Strategic Appropriateness A strategically appropriate culture motivates due to the direct support for performance in the market and industry: \\"The better the fit, the better the performance; the poorer the fit, the poorer the performance,\\" state Kotter & Heskett. There is an appeal to the idea that cultures are designed around the operations conditions a firm encounters although an outstanding issue is the question of adapting culture to changes in the environment. ;Adaptability Another perspective in culture literature asserts that in order for an organization to perform at a high level over a long period of time, it must be able to adapt to changes in the environment. According to Ralph Kilmann, in such a culture \\"there is a shared feeling of confidence: the members believe, without a doubt, that they can effectively manage whatever new problems and opportunities will come their way.\\" In effect, the culture is infused with a high degree of self-efficacy and confidence. As with the strong culture, critics point to the fact that the theory provides nothing in the way of appropriate direction of adaptation that leads to high performance. ;Competing Values Framework Another perspective on culture and motivation comes from the work of Cameron & QuinnCameron, Kim & Quinn, Robert, (2006). Diagnosing and Changing Organizational Culture: Based on the Competing Values Framework. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. and the Competing Values Framework. They divide cultures into four quadrants: Clan, Adhocracy, Market, Hierarchy, with particular characteristics that directly affect employee motivation. * Clan cultures are collaborative and driven by values such as commitment, communication, and individual development. Motivation results from human development, employee engagement, and a high degree of open communication. * Adhocracy cultures are creative and innovative. Motivation in such cultures arises from finding creative solutions to problems, continually improving, and empowering agility. * Market cultures focus on value to the customer and are typically competitive and aggressive. Motivation in the market culture results from winning in the marketplace and creating external partnerships. * And finally, Hierarchy cultures value control, efficiency, and predictability. Motivation in such a culture relies on effectiveness, capability, and consistency. Effective hierarchy cultures have developed mature and capable processes which support smooth operations. Culture has been shown to directly affect organizational performance. When viewed through the lens of accepted behaviors and ingrained values, culture also profoundly affects motivation. Whether one looks at the type of culture—strong, strategically appropriate, or adaptive—as Kotter & Heskett do, or at the style of culture—Clan, Adhocracy, Market, or Hierarchy—as Cameron & Quinn do, the connection between culture and motivation becomes clear and provides insights into how to hire, task, and motivate employees. Personality Approach Personality traits, pre-dispositions, and behaviors can have an outcome on work motivation. Influences can be conceptualized in the Big Five trait theory (Barrick & Mount, 1991; John & Srivastava, 1999). The personality theory can characterize these traits into conscientiousness, agreeableness, extroversion/introversion, openness to experience, and emotional stability (Stajkovic, Bandura, Locke, Lee, & Sergent, 2018).Stajkovic, Bandura, Locke, Lee, & Sergent, (2018). Test of three conceptual models of influence of the big five personality traits and self-efficacy on academic performance: A meta-analytic path-analysis. Personality and Individual Differences. There are two types of personalities: Type A and Type B. Type A's are considered more dominant, aggressive, and work oriented. Type B's are detail focused, task oriented, and possess higher self- control. Individual perceptions may differ based on the job stressor or outcome (Day, & Jreige, 2002).Day, & Jreige, (2002). Examining type A behavior pattern to explain the relationship between job stressors and psychosocial outcomes. Journal of Occupational Health Psychology. Work demands that reflect on personality attributes can depend on tasks, job complexity, relationships, and work stress. The personality attributes most important for your workplace comes down to understanding the organizational work behaviors, characteristics of the jobs, and future strategies of the company.Sackett & Walmsley. (2014). Which personality attributes are most important in the workplace? Perspectives on Psychological Science. Personalities can be an influence on creativity in the workforce and behavioral expectations. ==See also== *Public service motivation ==References== Category:Motivation Category:Industrial and organizational psychology Category:Workplace ","title":"Work motivation"},{"id":"35231585","text":"Milaq (, also Romanized as Mīlāq, Milagh, and Meylāq; also known as Chāy Mīlāq and Mīlāq-i-Sufla) is a village in Kharaqan-e Sharqi Rural District, Abgarm District, Avaj County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

Brisbane Roar played in their second Grand Final in two years, and were aiming to become the first A-League team to win back-to-back Championships. Perth Glory played in their first Grand Final since the 2004 NSL Grand Final, and their first A-League Grand Final. Additionally, it was the second Grand Final since 2006 that did not include the Premiers. Brisbane Roar won the game, coming from behind after conceding an own goal, through Besart Berisha's two late goals including a controversial penalty in the final minute of injury time after the Glory had been reduced to ten men two minutes earlier. As the Grand Final winner, Brisbane Roar qualified for the 2013 AFC Champions League. ==Route to the final== The Roar went into the 2012 A-League Grand Final as clear favourites, with most pundits expecting an easy victory for the reigning Champions who were hosting the Grand Final for the second consecutive season. The Roar had easily accounted for 2011 runners-up, Central Coast Mariners 5-2 on aggregate in the major semi final, as they had done in the previous season to earn the rights to host the Grand Final at Suncorp Stadium. Perth also qualified for the final by defeating the Mariners; the Glory won the 2012 Premiers in a tense Penalty Shoot-out in the Preliminary Final at Bluetongue Stadium. ==Match== Summary In front of an official- sellout crowd of 50,334, it would be Brisbane Roar who would become the first A-League team to win back-to-back titles, at the expense of their West coast opponents, in the dying minutes of the game. The opening half an hour was evenly contested with both sides not really threatening, the best chance for either team fell to Sayed Mohamed Adnan who mistimed a free header over the crossbar from a Thomas Broich corner. Perth suffered a scare after 15 minutes when the A-League's all-time leading goal-scorer, Shane Smeltz suffered a deep laceration to the face following an accidental collision with Roar captain, Matt Smith. The Kiwi striker was treated on the pitch and played on but was substituted, for tactical reasons, in the 80th minute. Smeltz would later be taken to hospital where he would be treated by a plastic-surgeon and receive 50 stitches to repair the damage.http://www.foxsports.com.au/football/a-league/shane-smeltz-undergoes- plastic-surgery-after-stray-elbow-in-glorys-grand-final-loss-to-brisbane- roar/story-e6frf4gl-1226335713109 After the opening half an hour, the game started to open up, and with half time approaching, Brisbane had two chances to open the scoring through Mitch Nichols and Thomas Broich. However, the best chance of the half fell to Ivan Franjic, who saw a 20m low-driving effort tipped away by Glory goalkeeper, Danny Vukovic. That save by Vukovic ensured that the teams would go into half-time at 0-0. The second half started off where the first half had ended. Some trickery from Broich gave himself some space in the Perth box where he forced another superb save from Vukovic. It proved to be a vital save as not 60 seconds later, Perth had the opening goal of the game. Following the save from Vukovic, the ball was played to Billy Mehmet who made a strong run through the midfield where he played the ball out to Travis Dodd who was in space on the left wing. Dodd's initial cross was blocked however, on the second attempt, his low cross was inadvertently deflected into the Michael Theoklitos’ net off the leg of Ivan Franjic for an unfortunate own goal. Following the goal, Perth changed to a slightly more defensive game plan which also saw attacking options Travis Dodd and Shane Smeltz substituted for defensive players, Scott Neville and Steven McGarry (respectively). Roar manager, Ange Postecoglou also saw need for change bringing off the Roar’s two goal scorer’s from the 2011 Grand Final, Henrique and Erik Paartalu as well as club appearance record holder, Massimo Murdocca for the attack-minded young trio of James Meyer, Luke Brattan and Nicholas Fitzgerald in an attempt to find an equalising goal. However, the Roar were unable to immediately capitalise and Perth were able to keep the Brisbane sides’ attack at bay, at least temporarily. The breakthrough for the Roar eventually came in the 82nd minute. A throw-in near the corner flag of the Perth half by Shane Stefanutto found Broich in space, who was able to control and send in a cross that Besart Berisha met and fired an unstoppable header into the top left hand corner of Vukovic's goal. The game looked to be heading for extra-time when Dean Heffernan, who had earlier been booked for a needless yellow card in the 58th minute, was given his marching orders in the first minute of injury time after he was given a second yellow card following a scything tackle on Ivan Franjic. This encouraged Brisbane to push forward and they got the goal that arguably their dominance deserved, albeit through controversial circumstances. Liam Miller was adjudged to have brought down Bersart Berisha in the penalty box and referee Jared Gillett awarded the Roar a penalty. On replay, though Miller did make contact with Berisha's standing foot, many argued for and against that the contact was/was not sufficient to cause Berisha to miss the ball which resulted in the striker falling over.http://www.foxsports.com.au/football/a-league/besart-berishas-penalty- sparks-furious-debate-was-it-a-penalty-or-were-perth-glory- robbed/story-e6frf4gl-1226335928562 Following the game, Miller admitted there was contacthttp://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/sport/a/-/soccer/13494418/soccer- hold/ and referee boss Mark Shield backed the referee's decision.http://www.smh.com.au/sport/a-league/grand-final-penalty-call-was- right-insists-aleague-refs-boss-20120423-1xgz3.html However, none of that mattered as Berisha sent Vukovic the wrong way to secure Brisbane Roar their second A-League Championship and into the history books as the first team to win consecutive Championships. Perth captain, Jacob Burns was awarded the Joe Marston Medal for his man-of-the-match performance in midfield which stifled the Roar's attacking options. Burns’ award was incorrectly awarded to Thomas Broich during the post-match presentation; this was corrected and Burns was presented with his medal some 90 minutes after the presentation at the formal post-match press- conference.http://www.foxsports.com.au/football/a-league/a-league-mistakenly- awards-joe-marston-medal-to-thomas-broich-instead-of-rightful-winner-jacob- burns/story-e6frf4gl-1226335674201 Details { width=92%  -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"4\\"BRISBANE ROAR: - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - GK 1  Michael Theoklitos - RB 5  Ivan Franjic  - CB 2  Matt Smith (c) - CB 16 Sayed Mohamed Adnan - LB 3  Shane Stefanutto - DM 6  Erik Paartalu  - CM 17  Mitch Nichols - CM 8  Massimo Murdocca  - RW 10  Henrique  - LW 22 Thomas Broich - ST 7 Besart Berisha  - colspan=3Substitutes: - GK 20 Andrew Redmayne - DF 4  Matthew Jurman - MF 21  James Meyer  - MF 18 Luke Brattan  - FW 24  Nicholas Fitzgerald  - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=6 Ange Postecoglou Joe Marston Medal: Jacob Burns Assistant Referees: Mathew Cheeseman and Matthew Cream Fourth Official: Ben Williams } valign=\\"top\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=4PERTH GLORY: - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1  Danny Vukovic  - RB 19  Joshua Risdon - CB 5 Steve Pantelidis - CB 3  Bas van den Brink - LB 35  Dean Heffernan  - RM 13  Travis Dodd  - CM 10 Liam Miller  - CM 7  Jacob Burns  - LM 17  Todd Howarth - ST 9  Shane Smeltz  - ST 4 Billy Mehmet  - colspan=3Substitutes: - GK 20 Neil Young - DF 2  Josh Mitchell - DF 12  Scott Neville  - MF 14  Steven McGarry  - MF 27 Andrezinho - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=4 Ian Ferguson } } {  style=\\"text-align: center; margin: 0 auto; width: 20%\\" - !A-League 2012 Champions -  - Brisbane Roar Second Title } Statistics {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" - !width=150  Teams !width=111  Brisbane Roar !width=111  Perth Glory - Possession  62%  38% - Territory (inside own half)  46%  54% - !colspan=3 Attack - Shots at Goal  12  2 - Shots on Target  6  0 - Shots off Target  4  1 - Shots - Woodwork  0  0 - Corners  7  1 - Offsides  3  0 - Completed Passes  411  229 - Total Crosses  21  12 - !colspan=3 Defence - Keeper Saves  0  4 - Clearances  8  23 - Tackles  29  42 - !colspan=3 Discipline - Fouls Committed  7  18 - Yellow Cards  1  6 - Red Cards  0  1 } ==See also== * 2011–12 A-League * List of A-League champions ==References * Official A-League Website Category:2011–12 A-League season Category:A-League Grand Finals Category:Brisbane Roar FC matches Category:Perth Glory FC matches Category:Soccer in Brisbane ","title":"2012 A-League Grand Final"},{"id":"35231607","text":"Mesrabad (, also Romanized as Meşrābād and Mīsrābād) is a village in Kharaqan-e Sharqi Rural District, Abgarm District, Avaj County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

It was designed for use with the Boys Anti- Tank Rifle. ==Design== The .55 Boys is a .50 BMG cartridge necked up to accept a .55 caliber bullet and with a belt added to its case. It performed poorly when compared to contemporary foreign anti-tank rounds, such as the German 7.92×94mm Patronen and the Soviet 14.5×114mm rounds and, as a result, it was quickly deemed obsolete.Ammo Encyclopedia, Second Edition by Michael Bussard, p. 563 ==History== .A 55 Boys cartridge (left) and a .50 BMG cartridge (right). The concept of a small arm round for use against tanks began with the German 13.2mm TuF round, designed during World War I for use against the first British tanks. In the 1930s, the United Kingdom began designing an anti-tank rifle to counter enemy armoured vehicles in the event of a war. Early work on a round was started as a base, likely influenced by the first mass-produced anti-tank cartridge, the 13.2mm TuF, used a 13 mm calibre bullet. However, the idea of a 13.2 mm round was eventually abandoned. Development on what is known as the .55 Boys was started by Captain Henry C. Boys, a designer at the Royal Small Arms Factory, Enfield. Boys died before the rifle was officially adopted. The .55 Boys was a modified .50 BMG round necked up to accept a larger, steel cored bullet in order to increase its armour penetration. A belt was added to reinforce the case with the heavy propellant charge.It is incorrectly reported that the belt was added to ensure the round could not be chambered in weapons designed for the .50 BMG. though .55-calibre cartage could not be chambered in a .50-calibre weapon to begin with. The .55 Boys was adopted and manufactured alongside the Boys Anti-Tank Rifle in 1937 throughout the Commonwealth of Nations by firms such as Kynoch. However, when the United Kingdom entered World War II, the .55 Boys round was soon found to be insufficient against even early war Axis tanks in late 1939 and 1940. However, the United Kingdom had to rely on the .55 Boys round for several years because no better infantry anti-tank weapons were available. When the PIAT anti-tank weapon was introduced in 1943, the shaped charges it fired proved to be far more effective against enemy armour than the .55 Boys round had The Boys rifle was phased out of service as the PIAT became the British military's primary handheld anti-tank weapon. Despite its lack of effectiveness as an anti-tank weapon, the .55 Boys was used throughout World War II in both the Pacific and Atlantic theatre and also saw use during the Winter War and Continuation War by Finland. By the conclusion of World War II, the .55 Boys was no longer used in any major capacity. ==Variants== The .55 Boys round went through two major variants in its lifetime, along with an experimental variant that was never adopted by the United Kingdom. Mark I This is the first variant of the .55 Boys. It uses a . hardened steel core bullet with a lead sleeve, which is covered with a steel jacket. A ball and tracer version of this round was also created along with a practice round using an aluminum core in order to be more feasible for training. It has a muzzle velocity of roughly . Mark II An improved loading named the Mark II was released in order to increase the round's velocity and its penetration. It generates a muzzle velocity of approximately 884 m/s (2,899.5 ft/s).Bad Boys The British Rifle, Anti-Tank, .55 In, Boys At an ideal angle, the Mark 2 round was able to pierce 0.91 inches (23.2 mm) of armour at , 0.82 inches (20.9 mm) at 300 yards and 0.74 inches (18.8 mm) at 500 yards. APCR tungsten round An experimental armour-piercing composite rigid (APCR) .55 Boys round was designed in 1942.\\"An Introduction to Anti-Tank Cartridges\\" by Tony Williams It used a tungsten core instead of a steel core, which greatly increased its penetrating ability and gave a boost to its muzzle velocity from the Mark II's 884 m/s to approximately 944 m/s (3100 ft/s). It differs from the Mark I and II rounds because of its two-part bullet. This model was never officially adopted because far better anti-tank rounds and weapons, such as the PIAT, were entering service at the time. The .55 Boys, even with a greatly improved bullet, was simply too weak to defeat the tanks being fielded by the Axis powers. ==See also== * 13mm caliber * 14.5x115mm * 12.7×108mm * List of rifle cartridges ==Notes== Category:Pistol and rifle cartridges Category:Military cartridges Category:British firearm cartridges ","title":".55 Boys"},{"id":"35231634","text":"Torez () or Chystiakove (Чистякове) is a city of regional significance in Donetsk Oblast of Ukraine. Much of the city's economy relies on mining industries, despite a recent drop in the number of employed miners. In 2012, the city's population was 81,761, down from a 1970 peak of about 120,000. Pro- Russian separatists took control of Torez in June 2014.Letters From Donbas, Radio Free Europe (December 11, 2014) On July 17, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashed near the city. Torez was renamed from Chystyakove () in 1964 in honor of French Communist Party leader Maurice Thorez, who died that year. The Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament), although Ukrainian authorities have no control over the city, renamed it back to Chystiakove in May 2016 due to Ukrainian decommunization laws. ==History== The region was settled in 1778 at the confluence of the Sevostyanivka and Orlova Rivers (which drain into the Mius River) by runaway serfs from southern Russia and Ukraine. By 1800 the settlement, with 225 residents, was known as Sloboda Alekseevka after a son of landowner and founder S. Leonov. By the 1860s the town, now known as Chystyakove for a merchant and owner of a local manor, was a coal-mining hub. In 1875, two mining companies were founded: Chystyakovs'ke (which operated two coal mines) and Oleksiivs'ke, which was renamed Nadiya in 1907. The Chystyakove mines produced 4.7 million pounds of coal in 1909, and 76.8 million pounds by 1916. In 1924 the Chystyakove mining industry had 142 settlements, with a total of 44,679 residents. Eight years later the settlements became a town, and the town's ten coal-mining quarries were incorporated into the Chystyakovugol Industrial Trust a year after that. During the 1940s, the town had three administrative districts: * Chervona Zirka (Red Star) * Pivdenna Grupa (Southern Group) * Chystyakove Station (Railway) During World War II, Chystyakove was occupied by the German Army from October 31, 1941 to September 2, 1943. In 1964 Chystyakove was renamed Torez in honor of Maurice Thorez, the longtime leader of the French Communist Party who was a coal miner. In mid-April 2014 pro-Russian separatists captured several towns in Donetsk Oblast, including Chystyakove in June 2014. On 23 May 2014 a pro-Ukrainian militia endorsed by Oleh Lyashko had killed one pro- Russian separatist and left another badly wounded amidst a separatists takeover of city hall. On July 17 Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, en route to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam, was hit by a missile and crashed near Torez; all 298 people aboard were killed. On 12 May 2016 the Ukrainian parliament renamed the town to Chystyakove. Torez is a center of the Ukrainian coal industry. Its population is nearly 70,000, or 822 persons per square kilometer. == Demographics == As of the 2001 Ukrainian census: ;Ethnicity * Ukrainians: 50.8% * Russians: 45.1% * Belarusians: 1.3% * Tatars: 1.3% * Armenians: 0.2% * Greeks: 0.1% ==Transportation== Mykolaiv and Pioneerska Streets in central Chystyakove Torez's transport system consists of thirty-one routes served by buses and taxis and links to the cities of Snizhne and Shakhtarsk. The Luhansk-Donetsk Highway runs for nine kilometers through the center of the city. The bus station (vulytsia Popovycha) provides service to Donetsk, Kharkiv and other cities in eastern Ukraine. The city has three major railway stations: Chystyakove (vulytsia Vokzalna), Rozsypne and Pelahiyivka. Two stations serve electric commuter trains: Dronove in Pelahiyivka and Voskresenska in central Torez. ==Economy== Donbas mining monument Children's Creativity Palace Torez's major company is the state-owned Chystyakove Anthracite, which specializes in coal mining. The company controls a number of mines and production facilities, including the Progress Mine, the Lutugin and Volhynian Mine Administrations and the Chystyakove factory. Other employers include the Chystyakoveelectrical and alloy factories, the Vuhleresurs Company's Terra mine, the State Penal Department and the Chystyakove food- testing factory. ==Neighborhoods== Progress coal mine Torez's center includes Pionerska, Nikolaeva, Engels, Syzrantsev and 50 Years of the USSR Streets, Gagarin Avenue and Boulevard Illich. Neighborhoods are numbered one through four (Engels Street), 30th Anniversary of Victory, G and Red Star (Chervona Zirka).

After three seasons in Plymouth, Michigan, Daniels returned to college, this time attending Miami University and earning a Master's in sports organization while serving as a graduate assistant for the RedHawks in 1986–87. The next season saw Daniels as a full-time college assistant for Illinois-Chicago and in his second season the Flames saw their best performance, finishing 3rd in the CCHA and advancing out of the first round in the conference tournament for the first time. After the two-year stint Daniels moved back to Michigan, becoming an assistant at Ferris State under John Perpich. After a disappointing season in 1989–90 Bob Mancini replaced Perpich but Daniels was retained as an assistant. The first season under the new coach saw the Bulldogs post their first 20-win season in a decade but then slipped back under .500 in 1991–92. Mancini left to take over at Michigan Tech, leaving the door open for Daniels to take the reins. In his first season leading the team Daniels got the Bulldogs to another 20-win campaign, but it would be six more years before he could provide the Ferris State faithful win another winning season. Daniels' continued on in his position despite the lack of consistent success and rewarded the Bulldogs with their first 30-win season in 2002–03. Ferris State won its first regular season conference title that year and fell one game short of its first conference tournament championship, falling to Michigan 5–3 in the final. With their superb record, Ferris State received an at-large bid to the 2003 NCAA Tournament, their first appearance in the championship, and downed perennial power North Dakota in the regional semifinal before being eliminated. Daniels coached his first Hobey Baker Award finalist in 2003 and while Chris Kunitz failed to capture the award, Daniels himself received both the CCHA Coach of the Year and Spencer Penrose Award. Over the course of the next decade the Bulldogs hovered around the .500 mark until 2011–12 when Daniels got Ferris State its second regular season title, and NCAA Tournament appearance. The 2012 Tournament saw a better result for the team as they won each of their first three games while allowing only 1 goal in each game. They could not stop the #1 overall seed Boston College Eagles from taking the crown, losing 4–1 in the championship game. The season did finish with a silver lining as Daniels received his second CCHA Coach of the Year and Spencer Penrose Awards. The following season was Ferris State's last in the CCHA when the conference dissolved after the realignment resulting from the formation of the Big Ten. They joined the WCHA beginning in 2013–14 and got off to a fast start, winning the regular season title with a 29-win year and making their third NCAA berth, losing a double overtime game to North Dakota in the regional finals. For his efforts Daniels was awarded the WCHA Coach of the Year Award. ==Head coaching recordSee also== *List of college men's ice hockey coaches with 400 wins ==References * *Ferris State bio Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:American ice hockey coaches Category:Ferris State Bulldogs men's ice hockey coaches Category:Michigan State Spartans men's ice hockey players Category:American men's ice hockey forwards ","title":"Bob Daniels (ice hockey)"},{"id":"35231682","text":"Tiresias appears to Odysseus during the nekyia of Odyssey xi, in this watercolor with tempera by the Anglo-Swiss painter Johann Heinrich Füssli, c. 1780-85 Published around 30 BCE, the second book of Satires is a series of poems composed in dactylic hexameter by the Roman poet Horace. Satires 2.5 stands out in the work for its unique analysis of legacy hunting. ==Plot summary== Horace's Satire Book II, Satire V is poem about a discussion between Ulysses and Tiresias that is presented as a continuation of their interaction in the underworld in Book 11 of Homer's Odyssey. Ulysses is concerned that he will have no wealth once he returns to Ithaca because the suitors will have squandered the contents of his storehouses. Stating bluntly that breeding and character are meaningless without wealth, he asks Tiresias for any suggestions on how to rebuild his prosperity. Tiresias suggests that Ulysses try his hand at legacy hunting, and gives examples of characters through history that have ingratiated themselves with the affluent in order to be named as benefactors in their will. Despite Ulysses’ skepticism, Tiresias asserts the plan's merit and provides examples of how to curry favor. ;Outline of the PoemRoberts, Michael. \\"Horace Satires 2.5: Restrained Indignation.\\" The American Journal of Philology 105.4 (1984). pg. 427 :A. 1-22 Introduction :B. 23-44 Ensnarement of Victim. Flattery :C. 45-69 Precautions. Failure :D. 70-98 Maintenance of Hold over Victim. Flattery :E. 99-110 Conclusions. Success ==Analysis== The structure of the poem places the majority of focus on section C, especially the story of Nasica and Coranus.Roberts, Michael. \\"Horace Satires 2.5: Restrained Indignation.\\" The American Journal of Philology 105.4 (1984). pg. 427 The poem draws from the imagery of hunting, referring to the legacy-seeker as adept with snares and to his prey as an unwary tunny fish. Most importantly, in the poem “nothing suggests that the typical senex has a mind or will of his own.”.Roberts, Michael. \\"Horace Satires 2.5: Restrained Indignation.\\" The American Journal of Philology 105.4 (1984). pg. 428 The victim is utterly objectified and reduced to a feeble creature that the captator can exploit. On a linguistic level, the poem features very colloquial and expressive language. “‘breeding and character without assets are vilior alga--more worthless than seaweed.’ Tell me, says Ulysses, how I can rake together ‘piles of cash’-- aeris acervos.”.Rudd, Niall. The Satires of Horace. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1966. pg. 238 The analogies in the text are similarly graphic, as in the story of the over-insistent heir in Thebes who was required by the will of his benefactor to carry her oil-soaked slippery carcass on his shoulders during the funeral procession. Satire 2.5 is often thought of as the least “Horatian” of the Satires and is often compared to works by Juvenal, a poet of the 1st century AD. Juvenal’s poems focus on the perversions of man and hint at Man’s loss of “his highest potentialities”.Anderson, W.S., “Imagery in the Satires of Horace and Juvenal,” AJP 81 (1960). pg. 241-243Roberts, Michael. \\"Horace Satires 2.5: Restrained Indignation.\\" The American Journal of Philology 105.4 (1984). pg. 431 Many scholars acknowledge this cynicism in Satire 2.5 and see a connection between the two authors. As Shackleton Bailey writes, “Uniquely for Horace, it concerns a particular social malpractice (touting for legacies), and its mordant humour has reminded many readers of Juvenal.”Shackleton Bailey, D.R. Profile of Horace. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982. pg.36 ==Characterizations== Ulysses Horace diverges from classical portrayals of Ulysses in this satire. Ulysses is a heroic Greek protagonist, but in this poem he eschews the importance of noble bearing in favor of temporal riches. Michael Roberts writes that “the theme of perversion of human values runs throughout the satire,”Roberts, Michael. \\"Horace Satires 2.5: Restrained Indignation.\\" The American Journal of Philology 105.4 (1984). pg. 432 and this is especially relevant to the destitute Ulysses. Horace’s choice of an established epic hero to request Tiresias’ scheming advice displays a distortion of Greek heroic values. The poem also distorts the meaning of xenia, reducing the powerful bonds of host-guest friendship down to a calculated exchange of flattery for services. Although Ulysses is mostly silent after line 23, it is implied that he has been swayed by the pragmatism of Tiresias’ words. Tiresias Horace’s characterization of Tiresias is strikingly different from other authors. Instead of portraying him as a great prophet, Horace characterizes him as a shady figure, quick to reveal the secret to making money. With this, the characterization of Tiresias creates a moral tension between the paragon prophet so highly respected in ancient literature and the shady truth-teller that reveals the inner workings of legacy hunting. It is from this tension that the satirical nature of the work is derived.Rudd, Niall. The Satires of Horace. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1966. pg. 228 Penelope Horace also takes a noticeably different tack than other Roman and Greek poets with regard to his characterization of Penelope. Horace introduces her first as the virtuous wife she is typically characterized as in lines 77-78. Ulysses claims that his chaste wife would never betray their vows of monogamy, but Tiresias counters that she is chaste only because the suitors are more motivated by consuming Ulysses’ bountiful stores than by sex. :::”But if you make her a partner/ and let her taste some cash at an old fellow’s expense,/ there’ll be no holding her. She’ll be like a dog with a juicy bone.” Penelope, classically a bastion of chastity, is hereby portrayed as corruptible like any other woman. ==References== Category:Poetry by Horace ","title":"Satires 2.5 (Horace)"},{"id":"35231706","text":"Nosratabad-e Bayeh (, also Romanized as Noşratābād-e Bāyeh; also known as Noşratābād-e Bābeh, Bāya, and Bāyeh) is a village in Dashtabi-ye Sharqi Rural District, Dashtabi District, Buin Zahra County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

The architectural \\"sham castle\\" is on the hill behind Engraving of Castle- Hill, 1830 Castle Hill in 1880, south facade, published in Morris's \\"Country Seats\\" canting motto: Forte Scutum Salus Ducum (\\"A Strong Shield is the Salvation of Leaders\\").Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.461 Castle Hill, main range, viewed from SW Castle Hill in the parish of Filleigh in North Devon, is an early Palladian country house situated north-west of South Molton and south-east of Barnstaple. It was built in 1730 by Hugh Fortescue, 14th Baron Clinton (1696–1751), who was later created in 1751 1st Baron Fortescue and 1st Earl of Clinton, the son of Hugh Fortescue (died 1719), lord of the manor of Filleigh, Weare Giffard, etc., whose family is earliest recorded as residing in the 12th century at the manor of Whympston in the parish of Modbury in South Devon. The Fortescue family became major land owners, influential in British and West Country history. Castle Hill is a rare example in Devon of an 18th-century country mansion \\"on the grand scale\\".Cherry, p.247 The house was substantially reconstructed following a disastrous fire in 1934. It was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1967. The park and gardens are Grade I listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Today the property is leased by Eleanor, Countess of Arran (born 1949), the grand- daughter of Hugh Fortescue, 5th Earl Fortescue (1888–1958). ==Predecessor== The manor of Filleigh has been held by the Fortescue family since the 15th century, although the family's main seat until the late 17th century was Weare Giffard, some to the west. An older late Tudor manor house on the site was re- modelled in 1684 by Arthur Fortescue and his son Hugh Fortescue (died 1719). A plaque to the left of the north entrance front of the main range is inscribed in Latin: (\\"Re-built by Arthur Fortescue, esquire, AD 1684\\").Listed buildings text Lady Fortescue kept a record of the rainfall at Filleigh Castle Hill. A project being carried out at the University of Reading is recording handwritten weather records from the past. Her name is shown as being the observer making the records at Filleigh Castle Hill. ==Palladian rebuilding== Hugh Fortescue (1696–1751), who in 1721 inherited the title 14th Baron Clinton, via his mother, consulted Lord Burlington (1694–1753), the pioneer and arbiter of Palladianism in England, on the design of his proposed new mansion. In 1728/9 he appointed Burlington's favoured builder Roger Morris to reface the house in Portland stone. The former hall was remodelled as a double-height saloon. ==19th-century additions== Service wing to east side of house, 1861, to design of Blore, with clock tower above. Viewed from south The stable block, viewed from the east. The main vehicular entrance to the house is through the large arch along a road which passes directly in front of the service block, the clock tower of which can be seen behind. The main range is visible to the left (south) A circular library was added in the early 19th century. In 1841 the architect Edward Blore (1787–1879) added a porte-cochere on the north side of the main range, now demolished and replaced in 1974 by an entrance porch to the design of Raymond Erith. Blore also refashioned the entrance hall and stairs and added a top storey with mansard roof. In 1861 Blore added at the east side of the house service wings and stables, thus considerably elongating the southern appearance of the building beyond the east wing. The service wing is set back from the east wing by the width of the entry road which passes directly in front of it, and is topped in its centre by a clock tower. Adjoining it on its east end and extending backwards to give the ensemble an L-shape, is Blore's stable block. This has small circular windows with portrait busts, and is pierced on its long eastern face by the imposing full height main entrance arch, through which vehicles pass and continue past the front of the service wing and through decorative inner gates into the courtyard situated between the north facade of the main range and the steep and rocky hillside. ==1934 fire damage== A major fire broke out in the early morning of 9 March 1934 and burned for two days. It destroyed much of the interior and killed two members of staff, the housekeeper and a maid. The 5th Earl had recently installed a central heating system, the boiler of which, situated underneath the library floor, had malfunctioned. After the fire the house was restored to the 18th-century style by Lord Gerald Wellesley (1885–1972), soldier, diplomat and architect, with Trenwith Wills. Although 49 paintings, including many Fortescue family portraits, were saved from the fire with only minor smoke damage, all were shortly afterwards destroyed by fire when the delivery lorry returning them from the restorer caught fire whilst parked overnight in a garage pending their return to Castle Hill.Lauder, R. op.cit. p.81 ==Grounds== Castle Hill, panoramic view of west side, seen from Oxford Down Hill looking eastwards. A large \\"Peace Clump\\" of Scots Pine trees was planted on Oxford Down by the 4th Earl in 1919 to commemorate the end of World War I.Filleigh History Group, p.9 The house is surrounded by landscaped grounds containing many picturesque structures and decorative points-de-vue. The former include three small classical-style Greek temples, the Sunrise Temple (1831), the Sunset Temple (1831) and Satyr's Temple (1861); the Traveller's Cross, erected in 1831, but formerly situated on a roadside near North Aller; Ugley Bridge (1861), an imitation of an old Devon packhorse bridge; The Sybils' Cave (1861), filled in while the house served as a home for evacuated children during World War II, but since re-opened. The ancient parish church formerly situated next to the former pre-Palladian manor house was demolished in 1732 by Lord Clinton with the licence of Stephen Weston, Bishop of Exeter, and was rebuilt to a new design in its present position some to the west of the house, visible from the terrace. This made available an unencumbered site for the planned landscaping. Other points-de-vue include the Sham Castle, the Triumphal Arch, the Ebrington Tower and the Sham Village (now demolished). Sham castle Architectural \\"Sham Castle\\" on top of hill to immediate north of house, with decorative cannon aimed southward, viewed from SW A sham castle dating from about 1746, occupies the hill behind the house to the north, possibly inspired by Vanbrugh, and is said to be the feature which gave the house its name. When Lord Lieutenant of Devon, Hugh Fortescue, 4th Earl Fortescue (1854–1932) flew the Fortescue standard from the castle, and noted in his diary that his ancestor Matthew Fortescue, 2nd Baron Fortescue (d.1785) had \\"armed\\" it, as a modern reference to which in 1991 Lady Margaret Fortescue installed the decorative cannon now present on its south lawn. It served for a while as a banqueting hall, at which time it was lined with oak panelling from nearby North Aller House, which in 1812 was moved on to Weare Giffard Hall. The building was later converted into a dwelling house, originally intended for a couple to tend the tame pheasants, and later lived in by the huntsman of the Fortescue Harriers, Abraham Moggeridge. From the castle can be seen to the west Lundy Island and at a closer distance, Bampfylde Clump to the north in North Molton parish. Triumphal arch Triumphal Arch on top of hill opposite south front of house, here viewed from the Sham Castle The original Triumphal Arch, situated on top of the hill opposite the south front of the house and on the same axis as the sham castle behind, was built by Lord Clinton in 1730. It had been allowed to become covered in ivy and in 1951 collapsed during a strong wind. Following the death of both her parents in 1958, Lady Margaret Fortescue in 1961 rebuilt the Arch in its original form in their memory. Financial contributions were made by the tenants of the estate and by friends of the family. The modern structure is of reinforced concrete faced with the original stone.Filleigh History Group, op.cit., pp.24–5 Sham village A sham village, now demolished, with church tower was constructed by Lord Clinton on the horizon at High Bray. Ebrington Tower This was built in 1992 by Lady Margaret Fortescue, on the site of the former Sham Village, in memory of her only brother Viscount Ebrington, who was killed in action with the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of El Alamein in Egypt, in 1942, aged 21, and whose mural memorial marble tablet can be seen in the Fortescue Chapel in Filleigh Church. Due to his loss, on the death of his father the 5th Earl in 1958, the family titles passed by law to the latter's younger brother, but in the absence of an entail, the Castle Hill and Weare Giffard estates he was free to bequeath to his two daughters. The tower, made from local stone, consists of three stories and is crenellated on top. It was designed by Hal Moggridge who had organised much of the reparatory landscaping work following the great storm of 1990, and was built by Graham Davey.Filleigh History Group, p.22 ==Descent to Countess of Arran== crosses fitchée or The last Earl Fortescue to own Castle Hill was Hugh Fortescue, 5th Earl Fortescue (1888–1958) who died in June 1958, aged 70. As he had no surviving male issue he was succeeded in the earldom by his younger brother, Denzil Fortescue, 6th Earl Fortescue. However the 5th Earl bequeathed Castle Hill, his principal seat, to his elder surviving daughter, Lady Margaret Fortescue (born 1923). Lady Margaret had married in 1948 Bernard van Cutsem, and had issue. It is now the home of her daughter Eleanor, Countess of Arran (b. 1949), who married on 28 September 1974 Arthur Gore, 9th Earl of Arran (b. 1938). She was awarded the MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours 2008. They have two daughters, Lady Laura Duckworth-Chad and Lady Lucy Fortescue-Gore. ==Public access== The gardens are open to the public for much of the year.

Beaudry's parents met at a fencing class his father was teaching at Université de Montréal. Despite this Beaudry was not pressured into fencing. His first sport was basketball, but he never was passionate about it. At the age of thirteen, after his family came back from Lebanon, where they had spent part of his childhood, he tried fencing because it was offered at his high school and immediately took to the sport. Beaudry made his breakthrough in the 2006–07 season. He won the bronze medal at the 2007 Junior World Championships in Belek after being defeated in the semifinals by Korea's Park Young-jun. He won the gold medal at the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro, prevailing in the final over USA's James Williams. In the 2007–08 season, Beaudry won his ticket to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing by finishing first in the Americas qualifier in Querétaro. He won the bronze medal in the Pan American Championships also held in Querétaro. For his début Olympics Beaudry won his first bout 15–8 against Egypt's Gamal Fathy, but lost 4–15 in the second round to 2004 Olympic champion Aldo Montano of Italy. In 2010 Beaudry was injured when a speeding driver crashed into his car while he was stopped at a red light. He got out of the accident with only a few cuts to his right wrist, but the psychological trauma caused him to take a four-month pause, during which he focused on his studies at the John Molson School of Business of Concordia University. After he got back to training, Beaudry claimed his fourth bronze medal in a row at the 2011 Pan American Championships in Reno, Nevada after losing in the semifinals to USA's Daryl Homer. A few months later he reached the table of 16 at the World Championships in Catania, defeating first France's Boladé Apithy, then Belarus' Valery Pryiemka, but he suffered another drubbing at Montano's hands. A few days later Beaudry successfully defended his title at the 2011 Pan American Games in Guadalajara after defeating in the final USA's Tim Morehouse. He proved the only fencer from outside the United States to win a gold medal. His World Cup results pushed him to a No.21 world ranking at the end of the season, a career best as of 2015. Beaudry qualified to the 2012 Summer Olympics in London as the second-ranked fencer from the Americas. He received a bye in the first round, then lost 12–15 to Belarus' Dmitry Lapkes. ==References External links == * Olympic results at Sports Reference Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian male fencers Category:Canadian sabre fencers Category:Fencers at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Fencers at the 2012 Summer Olympics Category:Fencers at the 2011 Pan American Games Category:Fencers at the 2007 Pan American Games Category:Olympic fencers of Canada Category:Sportspeople from Sherbrooke Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for Canada Category:Pan American Games silver medalists for Canada Category:Pan American Games medalists in fencing ","title":"Philippe Beaudry"},{"id":"35232140","text":"Kher Khereh (, also Romanized as Kherkhereh; also known as Jazīreh Kher Khereh and Beyt-e Yāsīn) is a village in Bahmanshir-e Shomali Rural District, in the Central District of Abadan County, Khuzestan Province, Iran.

The outbreak began in the Great Plains, where, over a two-day period, several tornadoes touched down, some of which were significant. The North Platte area was damaged by an EF3 that was produced by a supercell that spawned many tornadoes throughout its lifespan. The tornadic activity then shifted the Southern United States over subsequent days, particularly in Louisiana and Mississippi. These states were struck by a series of tornadoes for 3 days, most of which were relatively weak on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. However, a few reached EF2 intensity and caused considerable damage. Tornado activity continued across the Ohio Valley on the 23rd, with one confirmed fatality in southern Illinois. == Meteorological synopsis == March 18–19 As a powerful trough ejected into the Central Plains on March 18, the Storm Prediction Center issued a Slight risk for Severe Weather stretching from southern Nebraska to western Texas. That evening, many supercells evolved across the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma, producing large hail and damaging wind gusts. As the supercells moved towards the northeast, four tornadoes were produced across western Oklahoma, all rated an EF0 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. Early that night, a tornado-producing supercell moved across southwestern Nebraska, where four tornadoes were confirmed. The first was an EF3, the second was an EF1, the third was an EF3, and the fourth was an EF2. Severe damage was noted just to the west of the city of North Platte, Nebraska. The following day, the Storm Prediction Center issued a Moderate risk of Severe Weather, encompassing much of central and eastern Texas, into southeastern Oklahoma and extreme western Arkansas. Although this event was not as severe as initially anticipated, EF2 tornadoes caused severe damage in Texas as they impacted areas in and around Devine, Gardendale, and Lytle. March 20–22 The slow moving system produced a series of tornadoes across the South for 3 days. Most of the damage occurred in Mississippi and Louisiana. An EF2 caused significant damage near Port Gibson, Mississippi, and another EF2 badly damaged a home near Pelahatchie. The town of Gueydan, Louisiana also sustained a direct hit from an EF2 tornado. An EF1 tornado also damaged at least 30 homes in Lake Arthur, Louisiana. Other tornadoes occurred along the Gulf Coast, and one touched down in North Carolina as well. March 23–24 A slight risk was issued for parts of the Ohio Valley, but notable tornado activity was not expected. However several tornadoes touched down across Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, and Kentucky. Supercell thunderstorms developed and produced large hail as well. One high-end EF1 tornado caused considerable damage to homes in the Louisville metro area. An EF2 tornado caused one fatality in southern Illinois when a mobile home was thrown and completely destroyed. On the 24th, an isolated EF0 touched down in Florida as the outbreak moved eastward and came to an end. == Tornadoes == March 18 event { class=\\" collapsible\\" width=\\"100%\\" !colspan=\\"7\\"List of reported tornadoes - Sunday, March 18, 2012 - EF#  Location  County  Coord.

She has appeared in the drama serials Tanhaiyaan and Ankahi, as well as the show Uncle Sargam. After her successful television career, she left the industry in the mid-1990s and has since been retired. ==Early life and education== Sheikh was born in Kalaw, Burma, and later migrated to Pakistan in 1965 as a UN refugee and settled in Lahore, Pakistan, with her family, including her aunt, classical musician, Saffia Beyg. She attended the Convent of Jesus and Mary, Lahore, and later attended the National College of Arts where she graduated with a degree in Fine Arts. ==Career== Acting and hosting Talking about start of her acting career, Sheikh said that \\"I wasn’t really ‘discovered’ as most actors and actresses are. Someone had actually referred me to Haseena Moin for Ajnabi. She and Shoaib Mansoor invited me to try out for one of the roles.\\" Sheikh made her debut in 1980 with drama serial Balila which was written by Shoaib Hashmi. The show aired only few episodes and it got cancelled later but Sheikh already got noticed by that time and signed in drama serial Ankahi written by Haseena Moin and directed by Syed Mohsin Ali and Shoaib Mansoor. She played the role of Sana Murad an ambitious and level headed girl from middle-class family. Her next drama Maray Thay Jin K Liye was a critical success. Her performance as a modern, independent woman who is still conservative at heart was praised. After the success of Ankahi, Sheikh again collaborate with Hassena Moin in her next drama serial Tanhaiyaan directed by Shahzad Kalil. The show got massive critical and commercial success and now considered cult classic. Raj Kapoor was looking for a Pakistani actress for his film Henna. Kapoor wanted to cast Sheikh but she refused to work in the movie. So after her refusal Haseena Moin recommended Zeba Bakhtiar, thus Zeba was cast in the title role of Henna. When the film released in 1991 it was a success and was also chosen as India's entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars. In the early 1990s she appeared in couple of episodes of shows such as Uncle Sargam and Yes Sir, No Sir. She also hosted shows Showbiz Masala for NTM and Meri Pasand for PTV. Retirement from acting During an interview, Sheikh described her reasons of not acting anymore because of lack of new characters and challenges as an artist. She said that, \\"I didn’t want to restrict myself to characters which depicted the exact same personality. I wanted to branch out into something more diverse, more challenging,\\" Tanhaiyan Naye Silsilay After 27 years of Tanhaiyaan drama serial, a sequel named Olper's Tanhaiyan: Naye Silsilay was aired in late 2012. The script was co-written by Haseena Moin and Mohammad Ahmed and directed by Marina Khan. Six of the 16 original cast members reprised their roles but Sheikh refused the offer since she has quit acting. But Haseena Moin wanted her to render her voice for some letters her character has written to her sister in the drama. Sheikh agreed to doing a voice-over but demanded some amount for it. According to Haseena Moin, the sponsors refused to pay and she in return turned down the voice-over offer too. During an interview, Haseena Moin said about Sheikh's refusal of the offer to be a part of Tanhaiyan Naye Silsilay that \\"My guess is that as she had created an image in the past serial with her looks and young age, she didn’t want to spoil it.\\" Sheikh's character was subsequently killed off before the events of Tanhaiyan Naye Silsilay. Theater direction In 2010, Sheikh moved into theater, and directed Agatha Christie's 1960 play The Mousetrap at LGS Paragon. She described it as a challenge because, \\"It isn’t an easy play to perform; not only are the dialogues lengthy, but the names of the characters as well as the places mentioned [in the play] are rather alien for today’s generation and, hence, difficult to remember and pronounce.\\" The play received favourable responses from critics and audiences during its run. In 2011, she was appointed as one of the judges for LUMS Dramafest. ==Personal life== Sheikh married Seerat Hazir on 24 December 1982, who is also a Pakistani Television personality. They have two sons together. She resides in Lahore with her family and teaching and directing children's plays, first at Aitchison College, Lahore and now at Lahore Grammar School, for over 18 years. Talking about her work, she said that, \\"I thrive in the environment I work in. With adults, I feel one always has to deliver. It’s always ‘what’s it going to be this time?’ You're always on your guard with adults. With children, it's more natural. They take you for what you really are. You don't have to pretend.\\" In November 2005, she along with her husband worked with FAME, a welfare organisation to help victims of 8 October 2005 earthquake in Northern Pakistan. ==Acting credits== * Balila – PTV * Ankahi (1982) – PTV * Maray Thay Jin K Liye – PTV * Tanhaiyaan (1985) – PTV * Daak Time with Uncle Sargam – PTV * Yes Sir No Sir – PTV * Showbiz Masla – NTM * Meri Pasand – PTV ==References Category:Pakistani television hosts Category:Living people Category:20th-century Pakistani actresses Category:Pakistani Muslims Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Pakistani television actresses Category:Actresses from Lahore Category:National College of Arts alumni Category:Pakistani theatre directors Category:Burmese emigrants to Pakistan Category:Women television presenters ","title":"Shehnaz Sheikh"},{"id":"35232451","text":"The following is a list of Pittsburgh Penguins broadcasters for the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League. ==Television== 2010s {  Year Channel Play-by-play Color commentator(s) Ice- level reporter Studio host Studio analyst -

The current population is 2,009 (PWA, 2018), and they have 19 villages spread along the rivers of Camanau/Curiau, Alalaii, Jauaperi, and Rio Branquinho (Bruno 2003, 12). These are located in the northern part of the State of Amazonas, and the southern part of the State of Roraima (Bruno 2003, 10). The people call themselves Kinja and call their language, Kinja Iara (meaning “people’s language”) (Do Vale). The language has many other names such as, Atroahy, Atroahí, Atroarí, Atroaí, Atrowari, Atruahi, Atruahí, Ki'nya, Krishaná, Waimirí, Waimirí-atroarí, Yawaperí (Glottolog). This language seems to have a high transmission as it is spoken by all members of the community and is the main language used for reading and writing (Do Vale). == Contact == First contact with the Waimiri Atroari occurred in the 17th century with the Spanish and Portuguese crown spreading to gain more territory (Do Vale). First official contact with the Waimiri Atroari took place in 1884 with Joãno Barbosa Rodrigues who enlisted the Waimiri Atroari as guides. At this point in time the Waimiri Atroari already had a reputation for being violent and Rodrigues sought to change the stereotypes associated with the group(Do Vale). In 1911 a member of the SPI (Indian Protection Services) made contact with the Waimiri Atroari, the following year the First Indian Attraction Station was established (Do Vale). Despite friendly contact the government of this region saw the great wealth of resources that the native land possessed and encouraged the invasion of the land in order to exploit the natural resources (Do Vale). As a result, the Waimiri Atroari took up defense of their land with bows and arrows. This led to many acts of violence between the Waimiri Atroari and non-indigenous people, with military forces used to combat the indigenous group and wiping out entire villages (Do Vale). The next large scale conflict with the Waimiri Atroari that has been documented is in the 1960s with the Amazonas State and Roraima Territory Government's plan for a highway between Manaus and Caracarai, cutting directly through indigenous land (Do Vale). This project brought in individuals and teams to “pacify” the Waimiri Atroari as well as Military forces to build the highway and intimidate the indigenous people (Do Vale). As a result of high tension and disagreements most of the non-indigenous pacifists were killed by the Waimiri Atroari (Do Vale). In 1971 the Waimiri Atroari Indigenous Reservation was created, however between plans for Amazonas expansion and the discovery of cassiterite deposits, the government continued to infringe on the land (Do Vale). The reserve was demoted to a Temporary Restricted Area for the Attraction and Pacification of the Waimiri Atroari Indians in 1981 in order to exclude the mineral deposits from their land (Do Vale). Later more land was taken from the Waimiri Atroari as a hydroelectric plant project flooded over 30,000 hectares of their land (Do Vale). Today the Waimiri Atroari have their own school system which they control independently (Do Vale). == Language Family == Waimiri Atroari belongs to the Carib language family, which is centralized in Northern South America. The Carib languages in northern Brazil are fairly similar, while Waimiri- Atroari is rather different (Moore, 2006, 119). Carib can be categorized into three groups: Northwest Amazon, Guiana area and Upper Xingu Basin. Waimiri Atroari seems to fall into the second group, Guiana area (Bruno 2003, 16). == Documentation == João Barbosa Rodrigues’ wordlist seems to be the first to document the language in 1885 and he refers to the people as “Crichanas” (Bruno 2003, 12). A century later, in 1985, a phonological proposal and alphabet were developed by a Catholic missionary couple from the Indigenous Missionary Council (Bruno 2010, 85). A year after, in 1986, another missionary couple from the Evangelical Mission of the Amazonian (MEVA), created a more accurate orthography (Bruno 2010, 86). It seems that the first detailed description was done by Ana Carla Bruno. She released a dissertation in 2003 on the descriptive grammar of the Waimiri-Atroari language. She extensively described the phonology, morphology, lexicon, and syntax of the language. In addition, she has continued detailing the typology of Waimiri-Atroari in further works. In 2004, she published a paper on reduplication in the language. The following two years, she detailed its pronominal system (2005) and causative construction (2006). Then, in 2008 and 2009, she further analyzed the syntactic features of case-marking; phrase structure, clauses and word order. Most recently, she explored the value of linguistic analysis to better language revitalization by analyzing the syllable structure in the orthography and formal education of Waimiri-Atroari (2010). == Projects == While there are currently no language documentation projects for Wairmiri Atroari, there are projects for other languages in the Carib family. Carib language documentation supported by DOBES include the following languages: Kuikuro, documented by Bruna Franchetto, as well as Kaxuyana and Bakairi, which have been documented by Sergio Meira (Báez et al., 2016, 32). == Phonology ==  Consonants  {   ! colspan=\\"2\\"  !Labial !Alveolar !Palatal !Velar !Glottal - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Plosive !voiceless p t  k ʔ - !voiced b d    - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Affricate !voiceless   t͡ʃ (tx)   - !voiced   d͡ʒ (dj)   - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Fricative  s ʃ (x)  h - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Nasal  width=\\"20px\\" style=\\"border-right: 0;\\" m  width=\\"20px\\" style=\\"border-right: 0;\\" n ɲ (nj)  width=\\"20px\\" style=\\"border-right: 0;\\"   - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Rhotic  r    - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Approximant w  j (i)   } (Bruno 2003, 31)  Vowels  {   ! !

Verbs have also been documented, covering tense/aspect suffixes, mood (imperatives and negation suffix), interrogative clitic, interrogative forms, causative forms and desiderative suffix. Waimiri Atroari also has documentation of adverbs, postpositions, particles and case markings (Bruno 2003).  Pronouns  Bruno states that pronouns can take both subject and object positions in Waimiri Atroari (76).  1st Person: awy, aa, kara~kra  = Subject position = Bruno states that kara~kra is used when responding to a question or to emphasize that the person did an action or wants something. It is also the only pronoun that can be used in the OSV order (77). (1) wasypy-pa kra w-ia hungry-Emph 1PRO 1-COP ‘I am hungry.’ (2) meprypyny kara h-yn-iany.

Negation particle  Waimiri Atroari uses non-verbal negation, that is, negation marked by particles kap~kapy~kapa and wan. These particles act to indicate negation rather than negation being marked on a verb and are often used to negate existence as seen below (Bruno 115). (25) aiana ram wyty kapa Sp.bird 2PART meat/food NEG ‘Any-preto is not food.’ (26) wyty wan naminja Meat NEG dog “Don’t eat the food, dog!’  Causative forms  There are two kinds of causative forms that can be used to signify if a subject causes an event. First, there is the -py morpheme that indicates if someone “made” someone else do something or if they are not resistant to “cause” an event to happen. There is one construction where the morpheme -py appears with the lexicalized verb, such as in examples (27) and (28), where -py attaches to the verb for ‘tell’ (Bruno 100). (27) Aa Kaina h-ary-py-pia kyrywu ini-se. 1PRO Kaina 1s-tell- CAUS-IM.P snake see-in order to. 'I told/dictated to Kaina to see the snake.' (28) Paruwe aa-iry-py-pia woky yry-ky Marta inaka Paruwe 1o-tell-CAUS-IM.P banana give-IMP Marta DAT 'Paruwe told/dictated to me to give the banana to Marta.' There is also a form where -py doesn't appear with a lexicalized verb, such as in examples (29) and (30), where -py attaches to the verbs ‘bleed’ and ‘laugh’. It also seems that intransitive verbs like these, behave like transitive verbs when they take a causative form like V[Intr+Caus [A O (Bruno 101). (29) kyka ram ka hu-myny-tah-py-pia. 1+2PRO 2PART 3PRO 1+2A-bleed-VERBL-CAUS-IM.P 'We made him bleed.' (30) Ka k-yeepitxah-py-pia. 3PRO 1+2o-laugh-CAUS-IM.P 'She/he made us laugh.' Second, there is a form that indicates if the subject is “letting” the event happen. Someone is ordered or permitted to do something without forcing the other or knowing if the other may fulfill the event. It seems that there is an absence of the morpheme -py, as in examples (31) and (32), and the particle tre’me is notable, however Bruno notes that the particle tre’me may not mean “let” because of example (33), in which it does not indicate “let/permit” (Bruno 103). (31) Aa wo'nj-e'me h-aminjaky-piany a-wenpa-typah tre'me tyruwa kapry pyky. 1PRO clay- VAL LA-permit/let-REC.P 2o-leam-?

PART 'I took you to the party for you to learn how to sing.' == Syntax ==  Split System-S  Waimiri Atroari is what Gildea (1998)Gildea, Spike. “On Reconstructing Grammar: Comparative Cariban Morphosyntax.” Oxford Studies in Anthropological Linguistics, vol. 18, Oxford: Oxford Press (1998). classifies to as an Inverse Split system-S. Characteristics of this language system include A and O nominals having no case marking, a lack of auxiliaries and personal prefix set as well as the collective number suffixes (Bruno 2015, 5). In Inverse Split System-s, also referred to as Set I systems the OV unit may either precede or follow the A, in Wamiri Atroari the order is AOV (Bruno 2015, 7).Bruno, Ana Carla. \\"Case Marking in Waimiri Atroari: typical nominative/accusative or nominative with some inverse/split-s features.\\" Revista Linguíʃtica 4.2 (2015) A Verb-Phrase may be formed with just the verb (Bruno 2015, 7) (1) Ka-ky! speak - IMPER \\"Speak!\\" A verb may be preceded by an Noun-Phrase (Bruno 2015, 8). (2) bahinja maia kɨnk-E Children knife break-T/ASP \\"The children break the knife.\\" The particle ram cannot separate elements of a single phrase, however it can be used as a tool to determine which element is moved within a sentence (Bruno 2015, 8). (3)a. tahkome i-inɨ-pia ram Irikwa elders REL-eat-IMD-PAST 2PART Irikwa ‘Irika (a mythological entity) ate the elders.’ b. *[tahkome ram i-inɨ-pia] Irikwa elders 2PART REL-eat-IMD.PAST Irikwa In OSV contexts the object may move independently to subject position rather than the Verb-Phrase preceding the Noun-Phrase through the process of topicalization in which its components cannot be separated (Bruno 2015, 8). (4) woky i-eki kra h-ee-ia Banana REL- juice 1PRO 1A-drink-T/ASP ‘I drink the banana juice’  Hierarchy  Hierarchical relationships exist in Waimiri Atroari in which the third person is ranked lower than the first, second and first plural inclusive and exclusive person. In situations where second person acts on first person, or first person acts on second person there is may be subject agreement or object agreement. Therefore, it is necessary that subject and object marking follow a hierarchy : 1=2, 1+2/1+3>3. The following table provided by Bruno (2015, 11) illustrates how case is marked in Waimiri Atroari as well as the hierarchy present in the language. {  + Person Hierarchy in Waimiri Atroari 1A3O Aa ram ka h-ini-pia 1PRO 2PART 3PRO 1A-see-IMD.PAST ‘I saw him.’ - 2A3O Amɨra ram ka m-ini-pia. 2PRO 2PART 3PRO 2A-see-IMD.PAST ‘You saw him.’ - 3A3O Mɨkɨka ram ka Ø-ini-pia. 3PRO 2PART 3PRO Ø-see-IMD.PAST ‘She/he saw him/her’. - 1+2A3O Kɨka ram ka h-ini-pia. 1+2PRO 2PART 3PRO 1+2A-see-IMD.PAST ‘We saw him.’ - 3A1O Ka ram aa=ini-pia. 3PRO 2PART 1O-see-IMD.PAST ‘She/he saw me.’ - 3A2O Ka ram a=ini-pia. 3PRO 2PART 2O-see-IMD.PAST ‘She/he saw you.’ - 3A1+3O Ka ram a’=ini-pia. 3PRO 2PART 1+3O-see-IMD.PAST ‘She/he saw us.’ - 3A1+2O Irɨ k-ini-pe-s na. 3PRO 1+2O-see-?-DESID COP ‘She/he wants to see us.’ - 1A2O Aa ram k-ini-pia. 1PRO 2PART 2O-see-IMD.PAST ‘I saw you’ - 2A1O Amɨra ram aa=ini-pia 2PRO 2PART 1O-see-IMD. PAST or Amra aa=k-ini-pia } == Semantics ==  Quantification   Adverbial quantifiers  Noun phrases which possess quantifiers show positional variation, as seen in examples (5) to (9). Adverbials quantifiers may be positioned on either side of the head noun. Bruno (2003) explains the relative mobility of these quantifiers by categorizing them as adjuncts. (5) waha xiba (6) xiba waha many fish fish many 'many fish' 'many fish' (7) kinja wyty ipo-piany wapy people meat look.for- REC.P many 'People hunted a lot.' (8)kinja wapy wyty ipo-piany (9) wapy kinja wyty ipo-piany people many meat look.for-REC.P many people meat look.for-REC.P 'Many people hunted.' 'Many people hunted.'  Numeral noun phrases  Examples (10) to (12) provide examples of the occurrence of the numeral one. (11) is unique in the set as it refers to ‘one group’ while (10) and (12) refer to one individual (Bruno 2003, 108). Example (13) demonstrates use of the number two and examples (14) and (15) provide depictions of the use of number three (Bruno 2003, 140). = amini ~ awinini -awinihe -awynihe (one, alone) (Bruno 2003, 108) = (10) awinihe petxi ka-ky ampa ia one wild pig talk-PAST other to. 'One petxi talked to the other.' (11) awinih-pa ka kinja txi-pia itxi taka alone-EMPH EVID people go-IM.P jungle AL ‘The kinja went to the jungle alone.’ (12) awynihe petxi Kwawura i-atyka-pa ty-kyda tohnaka One pig Kwawura REL-put-REM 3REFL-back over ‘One wild pig put Kwawura on his own back.’ =Typytyna (two, a couple, a pair) (Bruno 2003, 140)= (13) typytyna karyka two chickens ‘two chickens’ =Takynynapa (three) (Bruno 2003, 140)= (14) weri samka ka-pia takynynapa Woman hammock make-IM three ‘The woman made three hammocks.’ (15) takynyny pahky kaminja n-apynaka. three only non-native 3-escape ‘Only the three white men escaped.’  Loan Word Influence  As of recently, due to western influence, Portuguese loanwords are also used to refer to amounts higher than three, and it is common for younger speakers to use them for amounts lower than three (Bruno 2003, 140). (16) dois kinja xiba myry-myry-pia quatro pahky. Two people fish REDUP-fish-IM four only ‘Two people caught only four fish.’ (17) amy kinja dezessete apytphy Other people seventeen behind amy kinja dezessete nate’me Other people seventeen behind ‘Seventeen people were in front, and seventeen were behind.’  Many  Many However, traditionally, it is common for the Kinja people to use waha~wapy (many, a lot) for amounts more than three because they did not count up to three (Bruno 2003, 140). ==References== Category:Languages of Brazil Category:Cariban languages ","title":"Waimiri-Atroarí language"},{"id":"35232529","text":"{ class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"width: 25em; text-align: left; font-size: 90%; vertical-align: middle;\\" + Awards and nominations received by Coronation Street -  colspan=3  { class=\\"collapsible collapsed\\" width=100% ! colspan=3 style=\\"background-color: #D9E8FF; text-align: center;\\"  Awards and nominations - - d9e8ff; text-align:center;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Award  style=\\"text-align:center; background:#cec; text-size:0.9em; width:50px;\\" Won  style=\\"text- align:center; background:#fcd; text-size:0.9em; width:50px;\\" Nominated -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ;All About Soap Awards   -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ;British Academy Television Awards   -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ;The British Soap Awards   -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ;Inside Soap Awards   -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ;National Television Awards   -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ;Royal Television Society Awards   -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ;TRIC Awards   -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ;TV Choice Awards   -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ;TVTimes Awards   -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ;Other awards   - } - d9e8ff;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"3\\" ;Total number of wins and nominations -    - d9e8ff;\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"font-size: smaller; text-align:center;\\"  References } Coronation Street is a British soap opera first broadcast on 9 December 1960.

Typically, a business pays a small fee to a transportation department (or to a subcontractor of a transportation department such as Lamar Advertising subsidiary Interstate Logos) to have their logos displayed on a large panel alongside other businesses. Depending on the jurisdiction, businesses may have to meet certain criteria such as hours of service and distance from the sign. ==History== In the United States In the United States, logo signs were permitted on rural Interstates beginning in 1965 as part of the Highway Beautification Act, though the signs did not come into general use, especially in the western states, until the mid 1970s. Originally, such signs were limited to gas, food, lodging, and camping. The 1976 amendments to the Highway Beautification Act expanded the program to federal-aid primary rural highways. In 2000, provisions for allowing logo signs on urban highways (as long as adequate sign spacing can be maintained) were added to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices; however, as of 2018 not all states have adopted these provisions, with some states (such as California and New York) continuing to restrict the installation of logo signs to rural highways only. As of 2018, logo signs are permitted on urban highways in 18 states (Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin), with Tennessee being the most recent state (as of 2015) to repeal the restriction for installing logo signs on rural highways only. The 2000 MUTCD also added the attractions category, followed by the 2003 MUTCD which added the 24-hour pharmacies category. Logo signs in the United States are limited to six logos per sign, and additional signs may be used up to a total of four in each direction per interchange. In 2006, the Federal Highway Administration issued an interim approval to allow more than six logo panels per service type on up to two signs per direction, which was eventually incorporated into the 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. In California, as well as on the Pennsylvania Turnpike the label \\"GAS\\" is replaced by \\"FUEL\\". In 2019, Metropistas announced it will launch a logo sign program for Puerto Rico highways PR-5 and PR-22, the first U.S. logo sign program outside the continental United States and the first in a United States territory. In Canada Logo signs are found along major highways in Ontario, namely 400-series highways 400 and 401. A separate signage is used for ONroute rest areas. In Hong Kong Logo signs are found all across the country, primarily in Kowloon and The New Territories. ==References Category:Traffic signs Category:Logos ","title":"Logo sign"},{"id":"35232555","text":"Arára is a Cariban language of Pará, Brazil.

It is the prequel to Puzo's The Godfather. It was published by Grand Central Publishing and released May 8, 2012. It is the fifth and final book published in The Godfather novel series, but, being a prequel, it is chronologically set first. The novel, set in the Great Depression, at the end of prohibition, tells of how Vito Corleone consolidated his power to become the most powerful Don in New York City. Also, it tells of Sonny Corleone's inauguration into the family business and Tom Hagen's graduation from being an adopted member of the Corleone family before becoming the consigliere. The novel also reveals how Luca Brasi first became associated with the Corleones, and introduces a number of new characters, including the crime boss Giuseppe Mariposa. == Plot == In 1933 New York City, 17-year-old Sonny Corleone is aware that his father Vito Corleone's olive oil business is a cover for his Mafia activities. With prohibition ending, and tensions between the organized crime groups in the city rising, Sonny wishes to join his father's criminal empire. == Reception == Reception for the novel was mixed to positive, with George De Stefano in New York Journal of Books arguing that \\"Ed Falco deftly pulls off a feat of literary necromancy, bringing back to life one of the most iconic figures in American popular culture: Don Vito Corleone.\\" The Washington Posts Patrick Anderson wrote, \\"Falco has captured Puzo's rich prose style and eye for detail. If you want to read another installment of the Corleone story, The Family Corleone is a solid piece of work.\\" Kirkus Reviews gave it a positive review, calling it: \\"A worthy addition to the lurid world of the Five Families.\\" == Film adaptation == The estate of Puzo had sought to keep Paramount Pictures from producing a feature film based on the novel. This has been resolved, with Paramount gaining the rights to make more Godfather films (as of 2020, no plans had been announced). == Audiobook == An audiobook of The Family Corleone was produced by Hachette Audio, read by Bobby Cannavale. == References == Category:2012 American novels Category:Novels set in the 1930s Category:Prequel novels Category:The Godfather novels Category:Fiction set in 1933 Category:Novels set in New York City ","title":"The Family Corleone"},{"id":"35232740","text":"Graffiti reproducing Samira Ibrahim's face.

The military violently dispersed protest participants, and Samira and other women were beaten, given electric shocks, strip searched, and videotaped by the soldiers. They were also subjected to virginity tests. The tests were allegedly carried out to protect the soldiers from claims of rape. After succeeding in placing the case in front of a civilian court, a court order was issued in December 2011 to stop the practice of “virginity tests”. However, in March 2012, a military court exonerated Dr. Adel El Mogy from charges laid in connection with the virginity testing of Ibrahim.The World's 100 Most Influential People: 2012 - Samira Ibrahim by Charlize Theron, Time Magazine, Wednesday, April 18, 2012.

Acre's first flight was in a Montgomery tandem- wing glider replica at Daytona Beach, Florida in 1909. He married Anne M. Schatz (1894-1967) in 1910 and they had a son, Harry Raymond Acre (1911–1984). In 1910 Acre was living in a tent outside the Hawthorne Race Track in Chicago, Illinois. Acre and Edward Andrews (aviator) worked on a 1905 glider built by John Joseph Montgomery, fitted with a 12 hp Bates engine. Victor Loughead and his half brother Allan Haines Loughead were licensed distributors of Montgomery gliders with Chicago auto dealer James E. Plew as a client. They also purchased a 30 hp Curtiss pusher which Acre was able to fly after Allen. In 1928 Acre was working with Air Associates Inc, an exclusive east coast distributor of Lockheed aircraft. Acre flew as a passenger in the 1928 National Air Tour demonstrating the new Lockheed Vega. Acre became vice president in 1941 following a rare wartime government seizure by Franklin D. Roosevelt during a C.I.O strike. Acre stayed in the position through World War II. He remained active as a general aviation pilot, owning and flying a Beechcraft Bonanza. He died on January 16, 1966 in Los Angeles, California. == References  External links == * Category:Members of the Early Birds of Aviation Category:1966 deaths Category:1889 births Category:Aviation pioneers Category:Aviation history of the United States Category:Aviators from New York (state) Category:Glider pilots Category:People from Auburn, New York ","title":"Raynold E.

It is the seat of the Bishop of Cork and Ross, and the mother church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cork and Ross. Its name derived from the fact that it encompassed the ecclesiastical parish of St. Mary and the civil parish of St. Anne. ==History== The cathedral is both the seat of the Bishop of Cork and Ross, and the parish church for the Cathedral parish which includes the areas of Blarney Street, Shandon and Blackpool. Baptismal records date back to 1731. The parish boundary had also included the areas of Blackpool, Sunday's Well, Shanakiel, Clogheen, Kerry Pike and Curraghkippane until 1981. (Both chapels of ease to the Cathedral, The Church of the Most Precious Blood, became the parish church of Clogheen/Kerry Pike & The Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary became the parish church of Blackpool).Blackpool Parish The cathedral was built during the tenure of Bishop Francis Moylan. Construction began in 1799 on the site of a former church built in the 1730s. The cathedral was dedicated on 22 August 1808 by Archbishop Thomas Bray of Cashel. In his sermon, coadjutor bishop Florence McCarthy D.D. spoke of the \\"necessity of social worship, arguing the point from reason, scripture, and tradition.\\" McCarthy died of typhoid in 1810, contracted while visiting a sick parishioner. The building was extensively damaged by an act of arson in 1820. George Richard Pain undertook the restoration of the cathedral, enlarging the sanctuary and creating a Chancel Arch. The cathedral re-opened in 1828. In 1964, the sanctuary was extended, a sanctuary tower added, and the internal layout reorganised. These works were completed in 1968. The architects employed were Boyd Barrett and Associates. The most recent large-scale works were completed at the cathedral between 1994 and 1996. The tower and sanctuary were renovated and refurbished, and the high altar, altar rails and side altars were removed. The roof was re-slated and the gothic ceiling was repaired. External stonework of the cathedral was also repointed. The cathedral closed for the duration of the works. It was re-dedicated by Bishop Michael Murphy on 29 September 1996 (shortly before his death in October 1996). The cathedral celebrated its bicentenary in September 2008. In 2017 a visitor centre was established underneath the sanctuary of the cathedral, with tours of the Cork Folklore Project's exhibition and work. ==Architecture== Designed in early Neo-Gothic Revivalist style, the building combines sandstone with limestone dressings. The tower over the main door was added in 1869, designed by John Benson. The original altar was fashioned in wood by Italian craftsmen in Lisbon. In 1821, John Hogan carved twenty-seven statues in wood for the reredos behind the high altar.\\"Cathedral Parish, Cork, Ireland\\", Cathedral of St Mary and St Anne The bells were cast in 1870 by John Murphy of Dublin, and were originally hung for change-ringing, however they are now considered 'unringable'. The modern sanctuary of 1996 was designed by architect Richard Hurley, and is finished in white limestone. ==References * Corkcathedral.ie - Cathedral of St Mary and St Anne homepage Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in the Republic of Ireland Category:Roman Catholic Diocese of Cork and Ross Category:Roman Catholic churches in Cork (city) Category:Tourist attractions in County Cork ","title":"Cathedral of St Mary and St Anne"},{"id":"35232765","text":"Høyforsmoen is a small village in the municipality of Beiarn in Nordland county, Norway.
