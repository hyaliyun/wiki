Based on the April 2015 Iran nuclear deal framework, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action between Iran and the P5+1 and EU was announced on July 14, 2015 in Vienna. == Background == Negotiations for a framework deal over the nuclear program of Iran took place between the foreign ministers of the countries at a series of meetings held from March 26 to April 2, 2015 in Lausanne, Switzerland. On April 2 the talks came to a conclusion and a press conference was held by Federica Mogherini (High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy) and Mohammad Javad Zarif (Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iran) to announce that the eight parties had reached an agreement on a framework deal. The parties announced, \\"Today, we have taken a decisive step: we have reached solutions on key parameters of a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,\\" which they intended to complete by June 30.Julian Borger and Paul Lewis, \\"Iran nuclear deal: negotiators announce 'framework' agreement\\" , The Guardian, Thursday April 2, 2015 (page visited on April 2 2015). Announcing the framework, Foreign Minister Zarif stated: \\"No agreement has been reached so we do not have any obligation yet. Nobody has obligations now other than obligations that we already undertook under the Joint Plan of Action that we adopted in Geneva in November 2013.\\" The framework deal was embodied in a document published by the EU's European External Action Service titled Joint Statement by EU High Representative Federica Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif Switzerland,Joint Statement by EU High Representative Federica Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif Switzerland , European Union. and in a document published by the U.S. Department of State titled Parameters for a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action Regarding the Islamic Republic of Iran's Nuclear Program.Parameters for a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action Regarding the Islamic Republic of Iran's Nuclear Program , U.S. Department of State (April 2, 2015). ==Agreement details== According to the joint statement in Switzerland, the P5+1 countries and Iran agreed on a framework for a deal. According to this framework, Iran would redesign, convert, and reduce its nuclear facilities and accept the Additional Protocol (with provisional application) in order to lift all nuclear-related economic sanctions, freeing up tens of billions of dollars in oil revenue and frozen assets. In addition to the joint statement, the United States and Iran issued fact sheets of their own.  The joint statement  The joint statement outlines the following: = Enrichment = * Iran's enrichment capacity, enrichment level and stockpile will be limited for specified durations. * There will be no enrichment facilities other than Natanz. * Iran is allowed to conduct research and development on centrifuges with an agreed scope and schedule. * Fordo, the underground enrichment center, will be converted to a \\"nuclear, physics and technology centre\\". = Reprocessing = * The heavy water facility in Arak with help of international venture will be redesigned and modernized to \\"Heavy Water Research Reactor\\" with no weapon grade plutonium byproducts. * The spent fuel will be exported, there will be no reprocessing. = Monitoring = * Implementation of the modified Code 3.1 and provisional application of the Additional Protocol. * Iran agreed IAEA procedure which enhanced access by modern technologies to clarify past and present issues. =Sanctions= When the IAEA verifies Iran's implementation of its key nuclear commitments: * The EU will terminate all nuclear-related economic sanctions. * The United States will cease the application of all nuclear-related secondary economic and financial sanctions. * The UN Security Council will endorse this agreement with a resolution which terminates all previous nuclear-related resolutions and incorporate certain restrictive measures for a mutually agreed period of time.  Other listed parameters and reactions by the United States and Iran  In addition to the final statement, both the United States and Iran have made public more detailed descriptions of their agreement. Officials of both sides acknowledge that they have different narratives on this draft. The U.S. government has published a fact sheet summarizing the main points of the deal. Shortly after it was published, top Iranian officials, including the Iranian supreme leader and the Iranian minister of defense have disputed the document on key points which remain unresolved. On 22 July 2015, Abbas Araghchi, Iran's deputy foreign minister who led the negotiations, made an announcement on state-controlled television that the recently reached nuclear deal with the world powers did not include limitations on Iran's weapons capabilities or missile power and that Tehran would keep arming its regional allies. \\"We have told them [the P5+1 world powers] in the negotiations that we will supply arms to anyone and anywhere necessary and will import weapons from anywhere we want and we have clarified this during the negotiations,\\" Araghchi said.The Times of Israel, 22 July 2015, Iran‚Äôs deputy FM: We told world powers we‚Äôll keep arming our allies, http://www.timesofisrael.com/irans-deputy-fm-we-told-world- powers-well-keep-arming-our-allies/ In a speech the following Saturday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei added, \\"Our policy will not change with regards to the arrogant US government.\\" =Enrichment= According to details of the deal published by the US government, Iran's uranium stockpile will be reduced by 98% to 300 kg (660 lbs) for 15 years. The level of enrichment must also remain at 3.67%. Iran will retain no more than 6,104 out of almost 20,000 centrifuges it possesses. There are two uranium enrichment facilities in Iran‚ÄîNatanz and Fordo. Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreed on 14 July, the Natanz facility will be limited to installing no more than 5,060 of the oldest and least efficient centrifuges for 10 years. At Fordo, no enrichment will be permitted for 15 years, and the underground facility will be converted into a nuclear, physics and technology centre. 1,044 centrifuges at the site will produce radioisotopes for use in medicine, agriculture, industry and science. This level of enrichment, 3.67%, would be enough just for peaceful and civil use to power parts of country and therefore is not sufficient for building a nuclear bomb. According to press TV report based on Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran's extra centrifuges and the related infrastructure in the Natanz facility will be collected by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in order to be replaced by new machines consistent with the allowed standards. Iran will be allowed to allocate the current stockpile of enriched materials for the purpose of producing nuclear fuel or swapping it with uranium in the international markets. These comprehensive solutions permit Iran to continue its enrichment program inside its territory and also allowed to continue its production of nuclear fuel for running its nuclear power plants. =Fordo= According to the U.S. State Department fact sheet and a joint statement by Iran and the EU, Iran has agreed to convert its underground Fordo facility into a research centre for nuclear science and physics and about half of the Fordo facility would be dedicated to advanced nuclear research and production of stable radioisotopes which have important applications in medicine, agriculture, industry and science. Furthermore, Iran would maintain no more than 1,044 centrifuges for this purpose. =Sanctions= According to Press TV, the implementation of JCPOA followed by lifting of all the UN Security Council sanctions as well as all economic and financial embargoes by the United States and the European Union imposed on Iran's banks, insurance, investment, and all other related services in different fields, including petrochemical, oil, gas and automobile industries will be immediately lifted all at once. However, according to the fact sheet which is published by the U.S. government, U.S. and EU nuclear-related sanctions will be suspended after the IAEA has verified the implementation of the key nuclear-related steps by Iran. =Inspections and transparency= Iran will be required to provide the International Atomic Energy Agency access to all of its declared facilities so that the agency can be assured of the peaceful nature of the nuclear program. According to details of the deal published by the U.S. government, IAEA inspectors would have access to all of the nuclear facilities including enrichment facilities, the supply chain that supports the nuclear program and uranium mines as well as continuous surveillance at uranium mills, centrifuge rotors and bellows production and storage facilities. Iran will be required to grant access to the IAEA to investigate suspicious sites or allegations of a covert enrichment facility, conversion facility, centrifuge production facility, or yellowcake production facility anywhere in the country. Iran will implement an agreed set of measures to address the IAEA's concerns regarding the Possible Military Dimensions (PMD) of its program. According to the Iranian fact sheet, Iran will implement the Additional Protocol temporarily and voluntarily in line with its confidence-building measures and after that the protocol will be ratified in a time frame by the Iranian government and parliament (Majlis).  Summary of agreement  {  +Parameters of prospective actions by P5+1 -  Lift all sanctions within 4 to 12 months of a final accord. -  Develop a mechanism to restore old sanctions if Iran fails to comply as per IAEA reports and inspection. -  The EU will remove energy and banking sanctions. - The United States will remove sanctions against domestic and foreign companies that do business with Iran. -  All UN resolutions sanctioning Iran will be annulled. -  All UN-related sanctions will be dismantled. } {  +Parameters of prospective actions by Iran -  Reduction in the number of installed centrifuges from 19,000 to 6,104 and only 5,060 of these enriching uranium for 10 years. -  No enriched uranium above 3.67% purity (suitable for civil use and nuclear power generation only). -  Reduce stockpile of enriched uranium from current 10,000 to not more than 300 kilograms 3.67 percent enrich uranium for 15 years. -  Fordo uranium enrichment facility will operate not more than 1,000 centrifuges for research. 5,000 R-1 centrifuges will be running at Natanz.

He was an active supporter of King Charles I during the English Civil War. ==Biography== He was the eldest son of George Hay, 2nd Earl of Kinnoull and Ann Douglas, daughter of William Douglas, 7th Earl of Morton. His date of birth is not recorded, but his parents married in 1622 and his youngest brother, Peter, was baptized 11 June 1632. He succeeded to the earldom in 1644. He followed the brilliant strategist James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose to the north, and was with him at Crathes Castle in his Aberdeen expedition after the Battle of Tippermuir in 1644. Kinnoull apparently then went to France, on his mother's petition, to be \\"bred and brocht up as his ain son,\\" by his cousin the Earl of Carlisle. At some point he traveled further north, as a letter from Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia, sent from Rhenen dated to Montrose at The Hague, mentions him, \\"We have nothing to do but to walk and shoot. I am grown a good archer, to shoot with my Lord Kinnoul.\\" ==Return to Scotland== Kinnoull likely return to Scotland soon after, as he arrived in Orkney in September with a force of about 100 Danish soldiers and 80 officers, who were going to train the islanders for Montrose. In September 1649, Kinnoull sent an enthusiastic letter to Montrose telling him that he \\"is gapt after with that expectation that the Jeus look after their Messia.\\" Kinnoull stayed with his uncle, Robert Douglas, 8th Earl of Morton, who had considerable property in Orkney. On the day after his landing, a Captain Hall arrived with a ship full of arms and ammunition, sent by Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll to his own clansmen in the Highlands. Historian Samuel Rawson Gardiner writes: > In October, indeed, David Leslie hurried northwards, but the Committee of > Estates had no navy, and being unable to cross the Pentland Firth, Leslie > contented himself with leaving a few garrisons behind him, and retired into > winter quarters in the south. Beyond the reach of attack by an enemy without > a fleet, the Orkneys formed an impregnable fortress for the Royalists, > within reach of that Celtic part of Scotland where Montrose's earlier > victories had been won. Unluckily for Montrose, on 12 November 1649, the Earl of Morton died \\"of a displeasure conceived at his nephew George, Earl of Kinnoull,\\" writes Sir James Balfour. Balfour wrote that Morton felt slighted because commissions had been conferred on his nephew that he thought he himself deserved, although other historians feel they may have been on good terms. Gardiner writes that Kinnoull was \\"well received by his uncle, the Earl of Morton, who encouraged the islanders to enlist in the Royal cause.\\" In his letter to Montrose, Kinnoull writes that he gave the commissions to his uncle: > \\"My uncle, my Lord of Morton, was pleased to think he was neglected, in that > the commissions for stating the country were not immediately conferred on > him by your Lordship. Wherefore, having all assurance of his reality, I > waived my own interest so much that I resigned all power of my commissions > to him, which he was pleased to accept of before the gentlemen of this > country, who were convocated for the receiving of his commands and your > Excellencie's.\\" ==Death== The earl died shortly after his uncle; although there is no clear date of his death, there are several independent chronicles. Captain John Gwynne wrote, \\"About two months after the Earle of Kynoole fell sick at Bursay, the Earl of Morton's house, and there died of a pleurisy; whose loss was very much lamented, as he was truly honourable and perfectly loyal.\\" Charles Gordon, 1st Earl of Aboyne, wrote that Kinnoull's death occurred soon after his uncle: \\"Presentlie thereafter the Earl of Morton dyed, and within a fewe dayes Kinnoul dyed also at Kirkwall in Orkney, unto whom his brother succeeded.\\" Diarist John Lamont of Fife records Kinnoull's death in his journal in March 1650, but it is not clear whether this is the actual date of his death, or the date when Lamont heard of it. However, though Kinnoull is said to have died shortly after his uncle, the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland believed him to be alive on 21 February 1650, as on that day George, Earl of Kinnoull; Henry Stewart, son to the Laird of Maynes; George Drummond, son to the Laird of Balloch; and Captain Hall were all excommunicated for the invasion of Orkney and for \\"horrid and perfidious conspiracies against the Solemn League and Covenant.\\" He died unmarried, and was succeeded in the earldom by his younger brother William. ==References== Category:1650 deaths 03 Category:Scottish soldiers Category:Cavaliers Category:Deaths from lung disease Category:People excommunicated by the Church of Scotland ","title":"George Hay, 3rd Earl of Kinnoull"},{"id":"46304235","text":"Wright Tavern, also known as the Reid House and Reid Hotel, is a historic inn and tavern located at Wentworth, Rockingham County, North Carolina.

Its seat is in Patras, Western Greece, and it is currently headed by Acting Secretary- General Dionysios Panagiotopoulos. ==Formation and tasks== Decentralized Administrations were created in January 2011 as part of a far-reaching reform of the country's administrative structure, the Kallikratis reform (Law 3852/2010). They enjoy both administrative and financial autonomy and exercise devolved state powers in urban planning, environmental and energy policy, forestry, migration and citizenship. Beyond that, they are tasked with supervising the first and second-level self-governing bodies: the municipalities and regions, in this case the 52 municipalities of Peloponnese, Western Greece and the Ionian Islands, and the three regions themselves. ==Characteristics== Covering an area of with an overall population of Peloponnese, Western Greece and the Ionian is the third largest of the seven decentralized administrations both in area and population, and it is the only one that covers three Regions. In the revised European NUTS nomenclature, the regions of Peloponnese, Western Greece and the Ionian together with the two regions of the Decentralized Administration of Thessaly and Central Greece form the first level NUTS region EL6 (Kentriki Ellada). ==Secretary-General== The Decentralized Administration is led by a Secretary-General () who is appointed or dismissed by a Cabinet decision upon request of the Greek Minister of Interior, and is therefore considered the senior representative of the national government in the regions. Following the electoral victory of Syriza in January 2015, the new Minister for the Interior, Nikos Voutsis, declared that the decentralized administrations would be abolished, and their powers transferred to the regions. Until this reform is formalized, and as the Secretaries-General appointed by the previous administration resigned on 2 February, the decentralized administrations are run by their senior civil servants as Acting Secretaries-General. Current Acting Secretary-General is Dionysios Panagiotopoulos. ==ReferencesLiterature== * ==External links== * Category:2011 establishments in Greece Category:Peloponnese (region) Category:Western Greece Category:Ionian Islands (region) Peloponnese ","title":"Decentralized Administration of Peloponnese, Western Greece and the Ionian"},{"id":"46304277","text":"Elachista similis is a moth in the family Elachistidae.

It is usually a solitary insect, and it is only in India that it has exhibited swarming behaviour. The last plague of this locust was in that country between 1901 and 1908 and there have not been any swarms since 1927. It is thought that the behaviour of the insects has altered because of changing practices in agricultural land use. ==Description== Newly hatched Bombay locust nymphs are green with black spots. After they have grown and shed their skin several times they become more variable in colour. Some are plain green, and others are either orange-brown or green with a black spot at the base of each wingpad. The immature adults are at first pale brown with a yellowish dorsal stripe and a dark-coloured prothorax with two lateral pale bands. After six to eight weeks the general colour becomes darker and changes to a rosy red colour, particularly noticeable on the hind wings. When the locusts become mature the following year, they turn dark brown. ==Distribution and habitat== The Bombay locust is found in India, Southwest Asia and Southeast Asia. Its range extends from India and Pakistan to Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Japan, the Philippines and Indonesia. Its typical breeding habitat is grassy plains and rough, tussocky grassland with shrubs and scattered trees at elevations up to about . In India, where swarms were common at one time, there have not been any swarms since 1927; it is thought this is due to a change of land use, with the areas of grassland in which it used to breed now being largely under cultivation. In some other parts of its range, where it does not form swarms, it has become an important local pest after forest clearance. ==Life cycle== On becoming an adult, the Bombay locust enters a diapause which lasts throughout the cool dry season. With the coming of the rains the insect becomes mature and starts to breed. In southern Japan, for example, it remains in diapause from June to March. It has been shown that it is the increased day length in the spring that triggers the change to reproductive status. In India it breeds in June and July, in Malaysia in August and September, and in Thailand in March and April. Females lay one to four pods, each containing up to 150 eggs, in soft soil. These hatch 4 to 8 weeks later, depending on locality, and the nymphs pass through about seven developmental stages over a period of several months, before becoming immature adults. There is a single generation each year. In Thailand, the young nymphs feed on short grasses but after about the third moult they move into crops such as maize. In the morning they feed in full sun at the top of the plant, by midday they have moved down into cooler, shadier locations, and in the evening they move upward again, congregating on the sunny west-facing side of the plant. The immature adults of non-swarming populations congregate on a few adjacent maize plants, flying briefly to another location if disturbed. After the maize is harvested, they move back to grassland. ==Swarming behaviour== The Bombay locust has only exhibited swarming behaviour in India. The most recent plague lasted from 1901 to 1908 and the last recorded swarm was in 1927, since when the patterns of agriculture in the region have changed. When swarming, the insects spent the cool period from November to March in forested areas in the Western Ghats. In May, when the monsoon winds had started to blow, they moved northeastwards into Gujarat, Indore, Nagpur, Hyderabad and the Eastern Ghats, by then covering an area of . If the rains failed to arrive in June, the plague continued to move with the wind, sometimes as far as Orissa, Bihar and Bengal. On the arrival of the rains, the swarms split up, the females laid their eggs and the insects died. The pods were typically laid in heavy clay soils in grassland, burned millet fields or the vacant strips of land between fields. The eggs hatched a few weeks later, and as the hoppers grew and developed into winged adults, they fed on grasses or moved into ripening millet crops. Northeasterly winds blowing in October and November transported the immature adults back to the Western Ghats, mostly feeding by day and moving at night. ==References== Category:Cyrtacanthacridinae Category:Locusts Category:Orthoptera of Asia Category:Insects described in 1763 Category:Agricultural pest insects ","title":"Patanga succincta"},{"id":"46304351","text":"√Ångel Oca√±a (born 7 June 1960) is a Spanish former professional racing cyclist.

Wednesday is divided into Wednesday proper (midnight to noon) and Rahu (noon to midnight). Each day is associated with a compass direction, a planet, and a totem animal. ==Nundinum== The ancient Etruscans developed an eight-day market week known as the nundinum around the 8th or 7th century BC. This was passed on to the Romans no later than the 6th century BC. As Rome expanded, it encountered the seven-day week and for a time attempted to include both. The popularity of the seven-day rhythm won, and the eight-day week disappeared. The cycle of seven days -- named for the sun, the moon, and the five planets visible to the naked eye -- was already customary in the time of Justin Martyr, who wrote of the Christians meeting on the Day of the Sun (Sunday).Apology, chapter LXVII Emperor Constantine eventually established the seven-day week in the Roman calendar in AD 321. ==Celtic calendar== The Celts used periods of darkness such as night and winter to begin their calculations of time. This meant that the first period of time in a \\"week\\" was a night, followed by a day. Further, they also counted the ending night period, giving rise to periods of time with more nights than days.

Members of the corps were largely graduates of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. The corps was established on 1 October 1920, in the aftermath of the First World War following the demobilisation of the Australian Imperial Force, when Australia's part-time military forces were reorganised to re-assume the main responsibility for the nation's defences. As part of the reorganisation, it was decided to raise a force of two cavalry divisions and five infantry divisions with various supporting arms to be maintained through a mixture of voluntary and compulsory service. To oversee the training and planning for this force, the Australian Staff Corps was established, along with the Australian Instructional Corps (AIC); together these two corps replaced the previously existing Administrative and Instructional Staff (A & I Staff), which had been responsible for the organisation of the Australian Military Forces since the Federation of Australia in 1901. These personnel were posted to Militia units as part of a small Regular training and administration cadre. The corps' personnel consisted of all officers, except quartermasters (who belonged to the AIC), holding substantive commissions within the Permanent Military Force assigned to the previously existing A & I Staff, the Royal Australian Artillery, the Royal Australian Engineers or the Australian Army Service Corps. In the post Second World War period, the strategic imperatives of the Cold War resulted in the Regular Army taking primacy over part-time forces, and the training of part-time soldiers moved towards a more centralised scheme. The raising of regular combat units, including infantry, with corps-specific training schools, negated the need for corps such as the AIC, or the Australian Staff Corps. Amidst these and other changes the Australian Staff Corps was finally removed from the Order of Precedence in 1983. ==References== ;Footnotes ;Citations ;Bibliography * * * ==Further reading== * * ==External links== * Staff Corps collar badge Category:Defunct Australian Army Corps Category:Military units and formations established in 1920 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1983 ","title":"Australian Staff Corps"},{"id":"46304496","text":"W75N(B)-VLA2 in 1996 (top) and in 2014 W75N(B)-VLA2 is a massive protostar located in the Cygnus X region some 4,200 light-years from Earth, about 8 times more massivephys.org: VLA images 18 years apart show dramatic difference in young stellar system, 2 April 2015 and 300 times brighter than our Sun, observed in 1996 and 2014 by the Karl G.

Raised by his grandfather after his parents both died (mother from a blood clot in the brain, his father from cancer) when he was young, Andy is bullied by his classmates and dominated by his obnoxious best friend Louie. When he turns seventeen, the Andy (who is weak and skinny) begins smoking and suddenly experiences short bursts of what appear, to him, as being super strength. Shortly afterwards, Andy's grandfather provides him with a box containing belongings of his father that he had kept secret. These include a journal, that explain that as a kid, Andy was exposed to experimental hormones by his father to ensure that his son would not be frail and weak like he was. This causes Louie to believe that smoking causes Andy to become super strong. Louie then convinces him to become an amateur super-hero with him as his sidekick. Seeking to find out more about his father, Andy requests that his aunt send him anything that she might have that belonged to his father. His aunt sends him a box that contains a \\"death ray\\" that disintegrates anyone shot by its ray. Much of the story deals with Andy's relationship with his grandfather, who is suffering from the onset of dementia and his black nurse/aid Delia, who Andy secretly has a crush on. Louie becomes more and more obsessed with having Andy use the death ray to kill local bullies and troublemakers, such as the abusive father of a girl Louie has a crush on. As Louie and Andy drift apart, Andy befriends Sonny, the ex- boyfriend of Louie's sister who attempts to help Andy cope with his grandfather's mental decline. Ultimately, Louie attempts to crush Andy's head in with a rock in order to permanently steal the death ray from him. Andy is forced to kill Louie, disintegrating him as a result. Afterwards, Andy's grandfather is placed into a group home, Andy is given custody of Louie's dog by his family (who do not suspect Andy of foul play), and Andy and the dog are forced to leave school in order to move in with his aunt. The story then skips to the early 2000s; Andy is now in his late 40s and is bitter and cynical about life; twice divorced, he has since adopted Louie's nihilistic view on life and the death ray and repeatedly moves from town to town, to avoid suspicion for the murders he commits with the gun. Having used the death ray to murder the men that both of his wives cheated on him with, and having failed at a relationship with his high school crush Dusty, Andy sold the death ray to a pawn shop and moved on with his life. However, after his neighbor's pit bull murdered Louie's dog and then laughs about it, Andy seeks to retrieve the gun and murder his neighbor. Andy convinces Sonny to help him track down the death ray (which Sonny believes is just a toy gun) and along the way, Sonny visits Dusty for Andy and relays an apology to him for unstated incident that ended their budding relationship. Andy murders his neighbor with the death ray, off-panel and ultimately moves back to the town where he grew up. Once he arrives back to the town, Andy meets the main bully who terrorized him growing up and who, in their last meeting, told Andy that he hoped his grandfather would die from his dementia. Andy resists the urge to murder the now grown up bully, but comments that the bully's now mature and less jerkish behavior was a lie. The story ends with a three part epilogue: *The first part has the ghosts of four of Andy's victims that Andy murdered for selfish reasons and which he regretted: a drug dealer who sold drugs to Delia's daughter, two of the men who slept with his ex-wives, and Louie. *Sonny, Dusty, Delia, and Andy's grandfather describing Andy: while Delia and Sonny have favorable views of Andy, Dusty refuses to comment while Andy's grandfather is consumed with sorrow over his grandson being a murderer. *Three endings for the graphic novel, told in one panel with text that describes the endings: **Ending One has Andy going insane and using the Ray Gun to murder every living soul on Earth until only he exists **Ending Two has Andy committing suicide and the world going on as normal, with no one ever knowing about Andy's death ray ***Andy dates a divorced woman in his apartment building, murdering her ex-husband with the death ray among other people who annoy him. Andy's relationship with the divorced woman eventually fails and he buries the death ray in the woods to avoid any further temptation to use it, after he realizes that he no longer has the available funds to relocate at the drop of a hat. Andy adopts multiple dogs over the coming decades, and ultimately dies from cancer in his late 70s, alone and childless. The final set of panels has Andy and his dog watching fireworks in the distance, while repeating a mantra from earlier in the book (during a fantasy sequence where Andy imagines life as a super-hero, with Louie as his sidekick) saying that he will always be available to help a stranger out if they are in trouble. ==Reception== In 2012, The Death Ray won a Harvey Award for Best Graphic Album of Previously Published Work.\\"Congratulations to the Harvey Award Recipients\\" ==References== Works cited * * Category:Drama comics Category:Comics set in the 1970s Category:Comics set in the 2000s Category:Fiction with alternate endings Category:Comics by Daniel Clowes Category:2004 comics debuts Category:2011 comics endings Category:2011 graphic novels Category:Pantheon Books comics titles Category:Ignatz Award winners for Outstanding Story ","title":"The Death-Ray"},{"id":"46304586","text":"Rubbee Drive is a 250W friction drive module which fits most standard bicycles.\\"Rubbee Drive Burn rubber\\".

In 2017 the site was taken over by the developer Inhabit who disclosed that a planning agreement had been reached and that the work to convert the building into luxury apartments was to be started.\\"This is what's happening at Heaps Rice Mill in Liverpool\\", Liverpool Echo, 23 July 2017, accessed 28 October 2017. ==References * Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1780 Category:Grade II listed buildings in Liverpool Category:Buildings and structures in Liverpool Category:Warehouses in England Category:Commercial buildings in England Category:Unused buildings in Liverpool ","title":"Heap's Rice Mill"},{"id":"46304728","text":"Baminnahennadige Shanudrie Priyasad (born September 8, 1997) is an actress in Sri Lankan cinema and television as well as a model, dancer and singer. ==Career== Her first movie role was in Onna Babo, which was directed by her father and later she appeared in Rosa Kale, Suwanda Denuna Jeewithe, Angara Dangara and Lantin Singho.

The guests are the people she has quarreled with in the past year, and there is only one rule: Firearms must be parked in the hall. Her daughter Thelma is brought home from the convent she attends with two nuns. ==Background== It won a National Playwrights Competition in 1958 and was produced in Sydney the following year by the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust. The judges of the competition ere Hugh Hunt and Kylie Tennant.Richard Waterhouse, 'Kenna, Peter Joseph (1930‚Äì1987)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 2007, accessed online 3 April 2015 Judge Kylie Tennant called it \\"a witty commentary on human behaviour, passion, pride and vanity and the curious innocence which keeps people lovable for all their cunning and downright wickedness. It has humour, tolerance and the ability to bring people on the stage alive.\\" Kenna wrote the play while rehearsing in The Bells Are Ringing at the Princess Theatre in Melbourne. \\"Sometimes its easier to write when you have to squeeze time in for writing\\", he said. Kenna said the play was \\"about outlaws. Not outlaws in the sense that they are rejected by society, but outlaws in the sense that they break some of the rules.\\" Kenna revised the play for publication by Currency Press in 1972. According to one account \\"Some scenes have been re-written so that what was formerly spelt out in dialogue is now left to visual symbolism and the audience's imagination; an entire scene in which the statue of St Teresa was smashed has been removed. Not only did this parallel too closely the smashing of the dolls in 'The Summer of the Seventeenth Doll' but its purpose was only to underline a point already well established.\\" ==1959 original stage production== The original 1959 stage production was directed by Robin Lovejoy. It was the fourth \\"straight\\" Australian play from the Elizabethan Theatre Trust. Kenna wrote the part of Oona for Neva Carr Glynn. \\"It's one of the most difficult parts I've had\\", she said. \\"But it's a magnificent one.\\" Original cast *Neva Carr Glynn as Oola Maguire *Grant Taylor as Horrie Darcel *Dinah Shearing as Wilma Cartwright *Frank Waters as Paddy Maguire *Dorothy Whitely as Essie Farrell *Des Rolfe as Charlie Gibson *Patricia Connolly as Thelma *Rodney Milgate as Whitey Maguire *Diana Bell as Sister Mary Francis *Philippa Baker as Sister Mary Mark *Mary Mackay as Sister Mary Luke Reception The Sydney Morning Herald said the play \\"has the kind of power and color to give much incidental excitement immediately to an audience.\\" The Sydney Tribune said it was \\"a play that every theatre-lover should see; whether you like it or loathe it, you won't be bored by it.\\" The Woman's Weekly called it \\"a lively, amusing play that deserves a good run.\\" The Bulletin called it \\"a study in opposites, but there is no real conflict. The main action is between mother and daughter, and since from Act I mother has acquiesced in daughter's going into a convent, if only to get rid of her, there is no real feeling of a problem solved when she goes there. A play like this, fact piled on fact, spaced-out by \\"delicious cameos\\", or conversation pieces that hold-up the plot, increases one's regressive nostalgia for the play-of-stratagem, where a conflict of wills produces a swift continuity of action and counteraction.\\" Reviewing it years later, Filmink magazine said the play \\"has a brilliant core character, a fascinating world, a rogue‚Äôs gallery of colourful support players, clever dramatic set-ups that you know are going to be paid off in exciting ways (‚Äúguns left at the door‚Äù, ‚Äúno drinking‚Äù), and a very solid dramatic situation (a gangster tries to seduce a criminal mother and convent-educated daughter).

Among the victims was Total's Chairman and CEO Christophe de Margerie, who was returning to Paris, France. The driver of the snow removal vehicle, who was injured in the collision, was found to have alcohol in his blood and subsequently pleaded guilty to causing de Margerie‚Äôs death. == Accident == The accident occurred in darkness at 23:57 Moscow Time (MSK). While executing its take-off run, the Falcon 50 struck with its right wing and landing gear a snow clearing vehicle that was occupying the runway. The jet rolled inverted and crashed on the grass next to the runway. A post-impact fire broke out, but was quickly extinguished by the airport's fire crew. There were no survivors among the four people on board the jet: two pilots, a flight attendant and Margerie, the only passenger. == Aircraft == The Dassault Falcon 50EX with tail number F-GLSA, serial number 348, first flew in 2006 and was less than eight years old. The airplane was owned by Sanofi-Aventis Groupe SA but operated by Unijet, which specializes in business aviation. == Investigation and trial == Five people were eventually charged with a crime: airport aerodrome service lead engineer Vladimir Ledenev, snowplow driver Vladimir Martynenko, air traffic controller Aleksandr Kruglov, trainee controller Svetlana Krivsun and Vnukovo flight director Roman Dunayev. Martynenko, Ledenev and Krivsun were charged with violating the article 263.3 of the Criminal Code of Russia (violating safety rules of transportation and air travel, which led by neglect to death of two or more people). , the investigation was continuing on the matter of three more potential accused, Vnukovo Airport shift director Sergei Kosik, branch director of Moscow Air Traffic Control Center Vladimir Uzhakov and Uzhakov's deputy Aleksandr Povaliy. The final version of the indictment was issued on 18 January 2016. In March 2016, 5 insurance companies (Berkshire Hathaway International Insurance, Tokio Marine Kiln, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Group, Great Lakes Reinsurance and Mapfre) sued the airport for 10 million euros to recover the payments made to their clients in connection with the incident. The lawsuit was suspended in August 2016 until the resolution of the criminal case. On 7 July 2017, Martynenko and Ledenev were sentenced to 4 and 3.5 years of imprisonment respectively following a guilty plea, and immediately amnestied. The charges against Dunayev, Kruglov and air traffic controller Nadezhda Arkhipova were moved into a separate case. Charges against Krivsun were dismissed in early 2016 due to \\"absence of criminal actions\\". On 24 July 2017, the court accepted an appeal on Martynenko's and Lebedev's sentences from Patrick Vervelle, whose wife, stewardess Ruslana, died in the crash. According to Russian law, Vervelle is considered a victim of this crime. Vervelle's civil suit against the airport was not accepted by the court earlier. In January 2018, Moscow's Arbitration Court accepted a lawsuit by Unijet, the company that was operating the aircraft, against Vnukovo International Airport and FGUP \\"Goskorporatsiya po OrVD\\" (the Russian government-owned air traffic control corporation), for 6,700,000 euros in damages. ==See also== * Linate Airport disaster * Air France Flight 4590 ==References * Interstate Aviation Committee Final Report hosted on the Aviation Safety Network * Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2014 Category:2014 disasters in Russia Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Russia Category:Vnukovo airport Category:Transport disasters in Moscow Category:2014 in Moscow Category:October 2014 events in Europe ","title":"2014 Vnukovo Airport Falcon 50 crash"},{"id":"46304766","text":"Jagdeo Prasad (2 February 1922 ‚Äì 5 September 1974) was a politician in Bihar, India. ==Life== A member of the Koeri caste, Jagdeo Prasad was referred to as the \\"Lenin of Bihar\\" due to his charisma. He led the Shoshit Samaj Dal and during the early 1970s, at the height of the caste tensions known as the Bihar Movement, he was able to attract much support from both members of the Other Backward Classes and the Dalits in their opposition to upper-caste landlords. ==Family== Jagdeo Prasad's son, Nagmani is a veteran politician who started his career from his father's party itself.He later joined Rashtriya Janata Dal and remained minister in RJD government.The former Chief Minister of Bihar, Satish Prasad Singh, who held the office for shortest tenure in Bihar's history as a nominee of Shoshit Samaj Dal, was brother in law of Jagdeo Prasad. ==Career== Born in Kurtha village, Jahanabad district of Bihar; Jagdeo Prasad went to Jahanabad town for higher studies. He further moved to Patna University, from where he pursued his post graduation studies.Jagdeo is said to have revolutionary mindset since his early childhood as in his adolescence, he fought to end prevailing practices like \\"Panchkathia System\\", in which farmers had to leave 5 katta of their land for the elephant of landlord to graze. Later he came into contact with Chandradeo Prasad Verma, who persuaded him to study the political philosophers to know the prevalent societal condition in depth. Jagdeo agreed and soon he became sympathetic to idea of socialism. Later, he joined Samyukta Socialist Party and in the days of ideological wars between Ram Manohar Lohia and Jayprakash Narayan, he chose to go with Lohia. Jagdeo also became editor of the magazine of SSP called \\"Janata\\". Later he moved to Hyderabad and started editing two more magazines Uday and Citizen. His ideas brought great fame to the magazines but he had to face intimidation from orthodox section of society.This led him to leave the magazine and move to Patna once again. Though, initially he remained an active member of SSP, he later realised that the fruits of labour of many are reaped by few in the party and given his ideological difference with Lohia, he resigned and formed a new party called Shoshit Samaj Party (SSP). He also remained active member of Arjak Sangh a platform led by Ramswaroop verma. The \\"Shoshit Samaj Party\\" was more a revolutionary organisation than a political party as it urged the landless labourers to grab the lands of landlords, a practice which gave rise to a number of caste armies and private senas in Bihar. Due to his critic of upper caste dominance, Prasad many a times is branded as Anti-forward caste.He remained Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar for a brief period of time when SSP was at peak.Prasad was called as Bihar's Lenin in his lifetime due to his radical views, he also coined the politically radical slogan of: ==Death== Prasad was killed by police on 5 September 1974 while leading a protest involving 20,000 people. There have been claims that his death was ordered by a minister in the Government of Bihar who belonged to the Bhumihar landowning caste, although police said that the protesters were not peaceful, as claimed, and instead were armed. Vinayak Prasad Yadav, then a member of the Samyukta Socialist Party, resigned from the Legislative Assembly of Bihar in protest of this killing at Kurtha. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:1922 births Category:Indian political philosophers Category:Bihari politicians Category:1974 deaths Category:Political repression in India Category:Assassinated Indian people Category:People murdered in Bihar Category:People shot dead by law enforcement officers in India Category:People from Jehanabad district Category:Communist Party of India politicians from Bihar ","title":"Jagdeo Prasad"},{"id":"46304794","text":"Richard Kieckhefer is an American medievalist, religious historian, scholar of church architecture, and author.

Cast *Jacqueline Kott as Caroline *Lynne Murphy as Amy *Graham Hill as Christian *Marion Johns as Mrs Fall *Frank Waters as Mr Fall Production In September 1959 it was announced that the ABC had created a TV Writers Pool, with the aim of teaching local writers the techniques of learning for the screen. There were ten initial members: Alan Seymour, Jeff Underhill, Richard Lane, Barbara Vernon, D'arcy Niland and Ruth Park, Gwen Meredith, Kay Keaveny, Peter Kenna and Coral Lansbury. Early Australian TV drama production was dominated by using imported scripts but in 1960 the ABC was undertaking what has been described as \\"an Australiana drive\\" of producing local stories. Swamp Creatures was one in a series of ten plays made by the ABC in 1960 using local writers, others including The Astronauts and The Slaughter of St Teresa's Day Floor assistant David Twiby recalled that during the making of Swamp Creatures, the smoke machine caused a stage hand to nearly die during the broadcast. Reception The Sunday Sydney Morning Herald TV critic called it \\"one of the finest drama efforts I have seen done here. Both from a technical and acting point of view, it couldn't be faulted... it gripped the interest from the first sequence. A scene where the two demented sisters stage a dream party in the near empty house was a brilliant piece of work.\\" Another Herald critic said the production \\"was at least successful in showing how a handful of characters can be marshalled to produce gripping theatre\\" but thought \\"the central issues are somewhat cloudily expressed. It is as if Seymour, having bunched these characters in a relatively surreal situation, is content to pile shock on shock at the expense of fully developing the main thread: that humanism rather than science is the answer\\" ==Other adaptation== The play was adapted for radio by the ABC in 1958.

They enjoy both administrative and financial autonomy and exercise devolved state powers in urban planning, environmental and energy policy, forestry, migration and citizenship.

The framework is composed of molecules of urea that are linked by hydrogen bonds, leaving approximately hexagonal channels into which align the molecules of the chlorocarbon. Color scheme: oxygen is red, nitrogen is blue, chlorine is green. The urea extraction crystallization is a process for separating linear paraffins (n-paraffins, n-alkanes) from hydrocarbon mixtures through the formation of urea-n-paraffin-clathrates. The process is primarily used to lower the pour point of petroleum products, by-products of the process are n-paraffins in high purity. The method may also applied for the separation of fatty acids and fatty alcohols. In addition to urea also thiourea is used in the process. == Raw materials == Tetracosane, C24H50, a typical paraffinic component. In addition to the n-alkanes are also unbranched fatty acids with more than four carbon atoms, their esters and unbranched fatty alcohols can migrate into the channels of the crystallized urea and form a clathrate. The initial discovery of the method was based on a study of the fats in milk.M. F. Bengen: Mein Weg zu den neuen Harnstoff-Einschlu√ü-Verbindungen. In: Angewandte Chemie. 63, 1951, p. 207, . A deviation from the linear molecular geometry, for example, by C=C-double bonds in the molecule, leads to a less stable inclusion compound. Thus stearic acid (C18: 0) forms more stable urea adducts compared to oleic acid (C18: 1 cis -9) or linoleic acid (C18: 2 cis -9, cis -12). A branching in the fatty acid molecule or an autoxidation result in a large deviation from the straight-chain molecular structure, so that these compounds do not form urea adducts. This is used as part of the fatty acid analysis and for the separation or enrichment of specific fatty acids.Hans- Dieter Belitz, Walter Grosch: Lehrbuch der Lebensmittelchemie, Springer, 1992, , p. 151-155 == Process == For the separation of n-paraffins from other hydrocarbon compounds, urea is added with an approximately 20-fold molar excess. The urea crystallizes in a hexagonal crystal structure with about 5.5 to 5.8 √Ö wide channels. In these channels the n-paraffins are included. If the concentration of n-paraffins in the mixture is too high, the mixture is diluted with a solvent. In general, the reaction proceeds according to the scheme: :urea + adduct component -> urea adduct The equilibrium of the reaction is dependent on the concentrations of the reactants, the solvent and the temperature.Friedrich Asinger: Chemie und Technologie der Paraffinkohlenwasserstoffe. Akademie Verlag, 1956, p. 53‚Äì59. The necessary quantity of urea for the formation of inclusion compounds varies from about 1 to 0.8 mole of urea per methyl- and methylene group in a carbon chain. The urea is added as a supersaturated aqueous solution to compensate for losses due to adduct formation during the process. In order to avoid a too high concentrations of adducts in the dewaxed oil a solvent such as methyl isobutyl ketone or methylene chloride is used for dilution. The ratio of oil to water phase is about 1 to 0.5. The mixing of the oil and water phases occurs at slightly elevated temperatures of about 35 ¬∞C. In the course of the reaction the mixture is cooled to room temperature. Lower temperatures are advantageous for the formation of inclusion complexes. The urea-paraffin-adduct can be filtered off and thereby separated from the iso-paraffins and other non- paraffinic components. By washing with a solvent a solid adduct residue is obtained. The washing of the clathrates with hot water at about 75 ¬∞C breaks up the clathrates and releases the paraffins. The obtained n-paraffins have a purity of about 99%. Losses of urea are small, the hot urea solution can be returned directly back into the process. == Literature == * Kenneth D. M.

Air India helped evacuate 170,000 people by civil airline. The operation was carried out before the Persian Gulf War in 1990 to evacuate Indian expatriates from Kuwait. Foreign Minister I.K. Gujral was instrumental in getting Iraq to co-operate on these efforts. Following this operation Air India, the flag carrier Indian airline entered the Guinness Book of World Records for the most people evacuated by a civil airliner.1995 Guinness Book or World Records, pg. 585 Mathunny Mathews, Harbajan Singh Vedi, Abey Varicad, V.K. Warrier, Ali Hussain and few others based in Kuwait helped immensely in the evacuation efforts of fellow Indians. ==Background== The invasion of Kuwait started on August 2, 1990, and within two days of combat, most of the Kuwaiti armed forces were either overrun by the Iraqi Republican Guard or fell back to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. The Emirate of Kuwait was annexed, and Saddam Hussein announced a few days later that it was the 19th province of Iraq. More than 170,000 Indians were stranded on Kuwaiti soil. ==Response== Initial efforts were made by the government of India to evacuate nationals by military aircraft. However, due to difficulties in air-space clearances the switch was made to civilian aircraft. India had initially requested permission to evacuate its citizens by Air India but the request was not approved by the UN and the government of Kuwait in exile. India was required to use planes supplied to them under the UN banner. Complications arose due to the significantly higher number of nationals requiring evacuation, a lack of travel documents and poor communications. The airlift was completed before the start of Operation Desert Storm. About 111,711 people were evacuated (airlifted) from Amman, Jordan, to Bombay ‚Äì a distance of 4,117 km (2558 mi) ‚Äì by Air India, operating 488 flights in association with Indian Airlines, from August 18, 1990 to October 20, 1990 ‚Äì lasting 63 days. Buses were also used after winning Baghdad's approval to ferry Indians through Basra, Baghdad and to Amman in Jordan. ==Popular culture== The event was the basis for the 2016 film Airlift starring Akshay Kumar, who played a character inspired by the works of Mathunny Mathews and Harbajan Singh Vedi. ==References== Category:1990 in India Category:Evacuations of Indians Category:Airlifts Category:Gulf War Category:India‚ÄìKuwait relations Category:Air India Category:1990 in aviation ","title":"1990 airlift of Indians from Kuwait"},{"id":"46304992","text":"News24 Nepal is the premium news channel of Nepal owned by Nepal Broadcasting Channel Pvt.Ltd (NBC).

Wards in dark grey were not contested in 2010. The 2010 Swale Borough Council election took place on 6 May 2010 to elect members of Swale Borough Council in Kent, England. One third of the council was up for election and the Conservative party stayed in overall control of the council. After the election, the composition of the council was *Conservative 33 *Labour 10 *Liberal Democrats 3 *Independent 1 ==Background== After the last election in 2008 the Conservatives had a majority on the council with 26 councillors, compared to 9 for Labour, 7 independents and 5 Liberal Democrats. However both the Conservative and Labour parties gained a seat at two by-elections in September 2008, after the independent councillors from Sheppey First resigned from the council. By the time of the 2010 election there remained only one independent councillor, after Sheppey Central councillor Lesley Ingham joined the Conservatives in October 2009, before Pat Sandle and Paul Sturdgess also became Conservative councillors in March 2010. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrat group on the council was reduced when St Michael's councillor Nick Williams defected to Labour in October 2009. This meant that before the 2010 election the Conservatives had 31 seats on the council, while Labour had 11, the Liberal Democrats had 4 and there was 1 independent. ==Election result== The Conservatives made a net gain of two seats to win 14 of the 17 seats contested. The gains came at the expense of the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties, which each finished one seat down. The Conservatives took Murston from the Liberal Democrats and Roman from Labour, as well as gaining Sheerness East by a single vote from Labour. However Labour retained Chalkwell with a majority of 30 votes over the Conservatives and gained one of the two seats contested in Queenborough and Halfway from the Conservatives. ==Ward resultsReferences== 2010 Category:2010 English local elections Category:May 2010 events in the United Kingdom Category:2010s in Kent ","title":"2010 Swale Borough Council election"},{"id":"46305016","text":"Sybra ephippiata is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

As a urologist, Van der Merwe regularly performs kidney transplants. In 2008, he performed the first laparoscopic removal of kidney in South Africa. The kidney was removed from a living donor to be donated to her sister. The duration of the surgery was four hours in total, which is longer than a traditional kidney removal. Van der Merwe said that the longer surgery time was offset by the much quicker patient recovery time. Van der Merwe said that the new method of organ removal could attract up to 40% more donors than there were at the time.  Penis transplant  On 11 December 2014, Van der Merwe led a team of surgeons through a nine-hour surgery at the Tygerberg Hospital, in order to surgically attach a penis from a deceased donor to an anonymous patient, who had to have his penis amputated after a ceremonial circumcision went wrong two years prior to the surgery (three years prior to the announcement of the surgery). The surgery was announced by the University of Stellenbosch's faculty of medicine and health sciences on 13 March 2015. Van der Merwe predicted the transplanted penis to be fully functional in two years' time. Van der Merwe was 46 years old when the surgery was announced. Following the surgery, some media outlets dubbed him \\"Dr. Dick\\". ==Accolades== In 2008, Van der Merwe was awarded the Karl Storz Golden Cystoscope for the most outstanding young urologist in South Africa. In 2012, at the congress of the South African Urological Association, he received the Sanofi-Aventis award for urological excellence and outstanding service in furthering the practice of Urology in South Africa. == References == Category:South African urologists Category:Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons Category:Afrikaner people Category:Living people Category:1960s births Category:Organ transplantation Category:Stellenbosch University faculty ","title":"Andr√© van der Merwe"},{"id":"46305077","text":"Sybra binotata is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

His work became known following a documentary film featuring his creation paintings by riding a bicycle over a surface saturated with bitumen. From about 1965, Green withdrew from the art scene as a reaction to negative publicity. He resumed his work in 1995. One of his works is in Tate Modern. ==Early life== William Green was born in Greenwich, London, in 1934.Obituary, The Independent, 14 February 2001 After leaving school he worked in the drawing office of an architect in Sidcup, Kent. He then studied at Sidcup School of Art from 1952 to 1954, and there he made his first use of bitumen paint after discovering an old tin in his garden shed. Green was accepted for the RCA in 1954, but as a conscientious objector to National Service, he was imprisoned from January 1955 for three months so was unable to join immediately. At the RCA, Green was in John Minton's tutorial group, and influenced by Expressionism. ==Artistic career== Early in 1956, the exhibition Modern Art in the United States opened at the Tate Gallery, and included works by Abstract Expressionist artists, including Greene. He had already been strongly influenced by reproductions he had seen of works by Jackson Pollock and made a conscious decision to be a non-figurative painter. From then on, he followed Pollock's example and worked on the floor, treating the paintings as his \\"arena\\" and using ever larger sheets of hardboard instead of canvas. Since late 1955, he had gradually eliminated colour from his paintings, and in spring 1956 he decided to only make black bitumen paintings, with their monochrome surfaces subjected to increasingly more brutal gestures and mark-making, including attack by fire. In 1957, Green was approached by Lawrence Alloway and included in \\"New Trends in British Art\\" at the Rome-New York Art Foundation. Another of Green's paintings, Napoleon's Chest at Moscow was included in \\"Dimensions, British Abstract Art 1948-1957\\". During the winter of 1957/58, Green taught at a working men's college, making abstract etchings and experimenting with nitric acid on the metal plates as he was attracted by the possibilities of using acid to further traumatise the surface of his paintings. In 1958 Green was included in \\"Five Painters at the ICA\\", \\"Young Contemporaries No 9\\" and \\"Six Young Contemporaries\\". In 1960, Green exhibited in the significant first \\"Situation\\" exhibition. He was then teaching at Luton with John Plumb, and they were invited by the Skoob Group of artists from Cambridge University to make a joint work in front of a large audience. Green was also invited by students at St Martin's School of Art to give a demonstration of his own brand of action painting. He produced a work in the central courtyard which he finally set on fire - the smoke rose to the top of the building while students watched from the windows on every floor. Through his fellow student Tony Messenger, Green met the photographer and film-maker Ken Russell. Russell made a series of photographs and the film that was to make Green's name. Green was seen making action paintings by hurling bitumen and paraffin at a primed sheet of board before cycling across the picture, skidding over it in plimsolls and finally scorching the surface with fire. Green became known around the world, attracting a level of attention that made him among the most talked-about artists in Britain. His working methods were lampooned by Tony Hancock in his film The Rebel (1961). ==Later life== By 1965, Green had withdrawn completely from the art scene, to some extent as a result of negative publicly his work had attracted. His brief marriage had ended in the early 1960s and his son had been adopted by his ex- wife's new husband. He returned to Sidcup in 1967 where he worked full-time at Havering Technical College until 1981 when he retired from teaching. When a student asked if he was the same William Green that he had read about in a book on Pop Art, he replied enigmatically \\"William Green is a very common name.\\" In 1995, Green started to paint again, taking up where he left off many years before. His first new works were made on paper, but he soon ordered large sheets of board and cans of bitumen and began to work outside the house, incorporating the effects of rain and fire on the surfaces of his black paintings. The results were shown at The Susan Hayward Exhibition at England & Co in London in 1993. Green was also featured in an exhibition at the Barbican in 1993, The Sixties Art Scene in London, and in the book of the same title. The BBC made a documentary about Green for The Late Show that was shown around the same time. He continued to paint every day and systematically sawed up and destroyed almost all his furniture and house contents, with the resulting debris incorporated in vast black bitumen-covered paintings. A group of these late works was exhibited in the Gardner Arts Centre at Sussex University in 1999, where he had been the subject of a previous exhibition, in 1964. He died on 28 January 2001. ==References * Work at Tate Modern * Newsreel film of Green Category:1934 births Category:2001 deaths Category:20th-century British painters Category:British male painters ","title":"William Green (action painter)"},{"id":"46305114","text":"Sybra conicollis is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

He was appointed professor of art history first at the University of Pisa, where he established the Istituto di Storia dell'Arte, which opened in 1929, then at the University of Florence, where he founded the Istituto Nazionale di Studi sul Rinascimento in 1937.Istituto Nazionale di Studi sul Rinascimento From 1950 to 1964, he was professor of art history at the University of Rome, where he primarily taught Renaissance and Medieval art but also, for some years, modern art. Salmi's work was mainly focused on Romanesque art and Renaissance art, with a particular fondness for the work of Piero della Francesca. However, apart from these main areas of interest, he ranged over a much wider field of art historical studies, from early Christian art to Baroque art, even managing to focus his interest on areas and periods hitherto neglected or undervalued by most other critics, such as Coptic art. In 1952, he founded the \\"Centro italiano di studi sull'alto medioevo\\". Always critical in his approach, he also put his attention to the so-called minor arts. In 1949, Salmi established the art review journal Commentari. He was also supervisor of the 15-volume Enciclopedia Universale dell'Arte, published from 1958 to 1967, which was soon translated into English as The Encyclopedia of World Art. Salmi influenced many of his students at the universities of Pisa, Florence and Rome, among them Alessandro Marabottini, Enzo Carli, Umberto Baldini and John Carandente.

Its seat is in Heraklion. ==Formation and tasks== Decentralized Administrations were created in January 2011 as part of a far-reaching reform of the country's administrative structure, the Kallikratis reform (Law 3852/2010). They enjoy both administrative and financial autonomy and exercise devolved state powers in urban planning, environmental and energy policy, forestry, migration and citizenship. Beyond that, they are tasked with supervising the first and second-level self-governing bodies: the municipalities and regions, in this case the 24 municipalities of Crete and the region itself. ==Characteristics== Covering an area of , Crete is one of the smallest of the seven decentralized administrations by area, second only to Attica. With an overall population of it is also the third smallest decentralized administration by population, though having recently surpassed the much larger Decentralized Administration of Epirus and Western Macedonia. In the European NUTS nomenclature, Crete together with the two regions of the Decentralized Administration of the Aegean forms the first level NUTS region EL4 (Nisia Aigaiou, Kriti). ==Secretary-General== The Decentralized Administration is led by a Secretary- General () who is appointed or dismissed by a Cabinet decision upon request of the Greek Minister of Interior, and is therefore considered the senior representative of the national government in the regions. Following the electoral victory of Syriza in January 2015, the new Minister for the Interior, Nikos Voutsis, declared that the decentralized administrations would be abolished, and their powers transferred to the regions. Until this reform is formalized, and as the Secretaries-General appointed by the previous administration resigned on 2 February, the decentralized administrations are run by their senior civil servants as Acting Secretaries-General. ==ReferencesLiterature== * ==External links== * Category:2011 establishments in Greece Category:Crete Crete ","title":"Decentralized Administration of Crete"},{"id":"46305259","text":"Sybra praeusta is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

Retrieved 3 April 2015. Educated at Heathcote, he began his working career there on the McIvor Creek goldfields before moving to New South Wales in 1875 and then on to Queensland in 1882 where he commenced work as a shearer. In 1885, his work as a miner took him to Croydon in Queensland, the Kimberley region in Western Australia, and Broken Hill, New South Wales before returning to Queensland in 1885 to once again take up shearing. Taking part in the 1891 shearer's strike, Hamilton led a group of strikers in Clermont. On 7 March the strikers jostled and abused members of the Pastoralists' Association and threw rocks at the accompanying police. While Hamilton himself had called on his men to show restraint, he was charged with criminal conspiracy and sentenced to three years imprisonment, which was served at the St Helena Penal Settlement. When his release was first proposed, Hamilton exclaimed \\"I will see you in Hell before I'll scab on my mates\\", and went on to serve the full term. ==Political career== At the 1899 election, Hamilton, representing the Labour Party, contested the seat of Gregory and defeated the Ministerialist candidate. He went on to serve Gregory for sixteen years before resigning his seat on 10 July 1915. On that same day Hamilton was appointed by the Ryan Ministry to the Legislative Council, remaining there until his death some five years later. During his time in parliament, he served as Minister without Office for one month in 1915, and on the day of his appointment to the Council, Hamilton was promoted to Secretary for Mines. He resigned from the ministry on 15 February 1917 to become President of Legislative Council following the death Arthur Morgan and served in that role until own death in 1920. ==Personal life== Hamilton married Mary Ann Mitchell at Rockhampton on 8 June 1896 and together had four children.

The quarry site is located on one of a series of outcrops near Munsungan Lake in north-central Maine, all of which have yielded stone tools found at prehistoric sites throughout northern New England. The area is known to have been frequented by Native Americans, with an extensive array of habitation sites located in the area between Munsungan and Chase Lake. The Willard Brook quarry site provides evidence that Native Americans engaged in quarrying and mining operations to recover stone suitable for conversion to tools. The quarry site consists of a series of depressions ringed by debris, which were interpreted by lead investigator Robson Bonnichsen as resulting from native mining operations when analyzed in the 1980s. Archaeological excavation in and around some of these depressions yielded stone blocks, cores, and stone flakes. The stone blocks showed evidence of crushing along their edges, suggesting that leverage was used along natural fissure lines to free them. The finds of the Willard Quarry site have prompted a reevaluation of the means by which natives gathered stone from the region's stone outcrops. The concentration of lithic materials at this site, when compared with a general lack of such concentration in similar areas along other outcrops suggests that it may have been more common for natives to gather fallen stone, rather than engaging in explicit quarrying and mining activity. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Piscataquis County, Maine ==References== Category:Quarries in the United States Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Piscataquis County, Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Piscataquis County, Maine ","title":"Willard Brook Quarry"},{"id":"46305381","text":"Sybra subuniformis is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

She has a weakness in her eardrums which causes them to perforate easily. In 2012, Boye attended the University of Texas at San Antonio, where she played college soccer for the UTSA Roadrunners. Boye later returned to her Danish club BSF after the American season. Boye signed for Br√∏ndby IF in the Danish Elitedivisionen in 2013 and was deployed as a central midfielder at club level. Equally comfortable defending or attacking, she represented Br√∏ndby in the UEFA Women's Champions League. She was voted 2014 Danish Football Player of the Year. She was later appointed captain of Br√∏ndby. In June 2017, she signed for FC Roseng√•rd in Damallsvenskan. ==International career== Boye made her debut for the senior Denmark women's national football team in December 2011, a 4‚Äì0 win over Chile at the S√£o Paulo International Tournament. She entered play as a substitute for Mariann Gajhede Knudsen on 83 minutes. An injury sustained at the 2013 Algarve Cup kept Boye out of contention for a place in Denmark's squad for UEFA Women's Euro 2013. In November 2014, it was reported that national coach Nils Nielsen was building his team around Boye, who had shown some of the same defensive qualities as Denmark's male captain Daniel Agger. In 2017, Boye was named to Denmark's UEFA Women's Euro 2017 squad.

This event may be linked to trump the planned and announced project - not completed - on behalf of Sikelianos, to write the tragedies \\"Daedalus in Sicily\\" and \\"Ariadne\\". ==Plot== The dramatis personae and the plot of this play come from the - rich in mythical material - era of Minoan Crete. King Minos, Queen Pasiphae, the craftsman from Athens Daedalus and his son, Icarus, are the protagonists of this play (priests of Mother-Goddess and Jupiter-Taurus, chorus of warriors, priestesses and prisoners are also present).ŒòŒµœåŒ¥œâœÅŒøœÇ ŒûœçŒ¥Œ∑œÇ, 1971, œÉ. 849. Minos, a representative-symbol of the emerging patriarchal religion and oppression of his subjects (representing evil and tyranny in general) tries to sideline the existing matriarchal cult of Mother- Goddess (the primordial matriarchal worldview of the Minoans, represented by the persona of Pasiphae, a sensitive female figure) and kill ‚Äì as a tribute - the envoys sent from Athens (including Theseus), being himself now transformed into a bestial Minotaur (symbol of absolute male brutal force acting on a dual level: authoritarian and sexually). Finally, the technician (the artist, the critical force that will symbolically resist to the arbitrariness and violence of power, as a free and revolutionary spirit which wants to awaken the people) Daedalus will organize a mutiny to prevent the suffering while Theseus will release the captives and will cancel the plans of Minos. The final scene (the palace and the entire city of Knossos are being burnt) is equally dramatical with a tragedy (containing profound connections with ancient Greek tragedy), Daedalus and his son Icarus will escape flying with artificial wings (like the homonymous legend). This play has diverse multifaceted connections with ancient tragedy - especially those written by Aeschylus ‚Äì in terms of structure, motifs, form, always modified and used according to the theatrical and conceptual targeting and aspirations of Sikelianos. For example, the presentation of all the leading dramatis personae (especially Minos and Pasiphae) as masks of the archetype \\"Dionysos\\" (which applies to all the tragedies and the general perception of the core of tragedy by Sikelianos) and their gradual integration into this archetypal figure through a process of initiation, the motif of tragic silence and the apollonian ‚Äì initially ‚Äì chorus that completes the drama, breaking the straight course of Time and making the return to the Earth and Life, the identification of Pasiphae with Moon on a symbolic level. A prominent role in the play\`s motifs play the \\"three nights\\", which are the key stages in the spiritual evolution of Daedalus (who is also a poet and philosopher as an artist). A major issue that researchers were focused on is the relationship with the novel by Merezhkovsky \\"The Birth of Gods. Tutankhamen in Crete\\", which moves in the same environment and mythical world. In summary, apart from any (easily identifiable and widely accepted) common symbols and motifs, the Merezhkovsky addresses the core of the play with religious thought and willingness to compromise the historical and philosophical-spiritual disputes arising from the clash of the primitive matriarchal with the patriarchal element via a sequence that leads to the spirit of Christianity (within this mythical scenery), non-relating, and thus linking with the historical -and political - significations of Sikelianos, powered by the timeless social injustice, the domination of the authoritarian element (the barbaric male within the confines of patriarchy) and updating of the myth in the contemporary historical context (the conqueror is identified with violence and power at the same time).ŒìŒπœéœÅŒ≥ŒøœÇ ŒíŒ±œÅŒ∏Œ±ŒªŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ, Œ£ŒπŒ∫ŒµŒªŒπŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒúŒµœÅŒµŒ∂Œ∫œåœÜœÉŒ∫œÖ: ŒºŒπŒ± (œåœáŒπ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÑœåœÉŒø) œÄŒ±œÅŒ¨ŒæŒµŒΩŒ∑ œÉœÖŒΩŒ¨ŒΩœÑŒ∑œÉŒ∑, Œü Œ∫Œ±Œ∏œÅŒ≠œÜœÑŒ∑œÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒóœÅœâŒ¥ŒπŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœÇ.

It was introduced in 1880 in the UK and was worn as headgear by most female officers in western countries. It began to be phased out from the late 1960s. ==Origins of the design== The Salvation Army bonnet was first seen on Wednesday 16 June 1880 at William and Catherine Booth's silver wedding anniversary celebration in Whitechapel, London. Its design was due, in part, to the fact that one of the cadets training at the Salvation Army's Hackney college in 1880 was a milliner from Barnsley called Annie E. Lockwood. She trimmed a bonnet chosen from straw designs supplied by local companies ‚Äì initially the ribbon chosen was blue, but later this would become black. 1936 Salvation Army bonnet at a picnic in Australia In design, it was similar to the poke bonnet that had been popularly worn by women earlier in the century. In 1881, the Salvation Army published some general rules prohibiting alteration of the distinctive bonnet. This was among the more identifiable parts of the uniform as the guidance at this time was simply to wear modest clothing suitable for a military organisation. The design also became popularly known as the 'hallelujah bonnet' and came to symbolise the Army's work. The bonnet's purpose was not only to identify the wearer, but to protect the head from cold and ‚Äì in the early days ‚Äì objects hurled at the head by people unsympathetic to the Army's work. An early example of the design is part of the Museum of London collection. cloche worn by Norma Talmadge in 1929 1920s and 1930s fashion adaptations In the 1920s and '30s, a hat sometimes referred to as the Salvation Army bonnet became a fashion accessory. This had a similar basic silhouette to the original poke bonnet design but could be made in other hat materials and colours. A Guardian fashion feature of 1926 on the latest Paris hat fashions noted the parallels between new derivations of the cloche and Victorian bonnets: \\"Paris is growing tired of wearing saucepans, paper-bags and sugar-loaves on its head. It remembers that it once had a cap of liberty, which was very becoming if a little drastic, and that Salvation Army pokes were worn as well during the Directoire period...the hat with the rather high crown and the brim varying from nothing to the Salvation Army shape will be far more in favour\\". Another article in The Guardian later that year commented on the prevalence of Salvation Army-style straw hats, minus the strings: \\"In straws ‚Äì and there are a good many of these ‚Äì the brim forms a huge peak in front, and from this it is a short step to a sort of Salvation Army hat ‚Äì for there are no strings. The hair shows not at all at the back of the neck. A century ago this effect was achieved by doing the hair high. Today the hair is cut off, but the effect is the same\\". The Times reported a new modified poke bonnet style in pale pink created by the studio of Caroline Reboux for spring 1938. This was part of a Victorian and Edwardian revival in fashion that the newspaper described as dominating fashion during winter 1938. ==See also== * Bonnet * Poke bonnet * Cloche hat ==References== Category:19th-century fashion Category:1880 introductions Category:1920s fashion Category:1930s fashion Bonnet Category:Hats Category:Uniforms ","title":"Salvation Army bonnet"},{"id":"46305456","text":"Balaoan Church also known as the San Nicolas de Tolentino Church is a Roman Catholic church located in Balaoan, La Union, Philippines under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Fernando de La Union. It used to be called Purao, and is under the advocacy San Nicolas de Tolentino. == Church history == Balaoan used to be known as Purao. It was organized as a town from different rancherias in 1586. On June 29, 1587, Father Juan Bautista de Montoya was appointed as prior of Purao with the Augustinians accepting the convent to their order. Other references claim Father Juan Bautista de Sandoval as the first priest before Montoya while some other sources say Father Diego de Rojas. In 1597, the convent of Purao was allowed to vote in provincial meetings on the Augustinians. In 1603, Purao was annexed to Taguidin. People went back to the rancherias and population decreased. Purao was made a visita in 1734. It was annexed to Namacpacan in 1739 and the name of the town of Purao was changed to what is known today as Balaoan. The church was constructed around the 1820s. It was half-complete in 1829 with its sacristy and main chapel done. Father Juan Antonio Fernandez continued the construction by extending the church from the presbytery to the main entrance from his appointment to Balaoan in 1769 until his death in 1829. Father Valentin Noval continued the work on the church when he was appointed in 1839. When Father Noval died in 1864, the church was finally finished. In 1877, a convent and cemetery was built under the supervision of Father Casimiro Melgosa. The church was slightly damaged by an earthquake in 1880. Father Isidro Saez repaired the church in 1891. Although the church underwent major renovations, it has retained its original foundation and designs. == Features == The church falls under the Baroque architecture. It is made of lime, bricks, and stone. Across the three story facade is four pairs of columns and lantern-like finials with two acroterium on top of angular piers on the column's end. Its pediment ends up in a small scroll. A separate bell tower is found adjacent to the church. On the ceiling of the main altar is the murals of the Four Evangelists.

He escaped not once but twice from Edinburgh Castle. ==Biography== He was the second son of George Hay, 2nd Earl of Kinnoull and Ann Douglas, daughter of William Douglas, 7th Earl of Morton. His date of birth is not recorded, but his parents married in 1622 and his youngest brother, Peter, was baptized 11 June 1632. His older brother, George, became the third earl in 1644 after the death of their father. Like his brother, William was a supporter of Charles I and joined forces with James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose. Montrose's nephew, Archibald Napier, 2nd Lord Napier, wrote his uncle from Brussels, 14 June 1648, \\"At my parting from France there went in my company above fifty men that did belong to my Lord Montrose; amongst which was Monsieur Hay, Kinnoull's brother, and severall others of good quality.\\" He inherited the earldom after his older brother died without issue in late 1649 or early 1650. The third earl's date of death is uncertain, but writings referring to the Earl of Kinnoull in early 1650 are believed to be about William. He is mentioned in March 1650 as having arrived in Orkney with a fresh supply of continental troops for the Royalist cause. Charles Gordon, 1st Earl of Aboyne writes that Kinnoull accompanied Montrose after his defeat at the Battle of Carbisdale in April 1650, when he was ultimately captured. Gordon writes that Kinnoull \\"being faint for lack of meat, and not able to go any further, was left there among the mountains, where it was supposed he perished.\\" Kinnoull in fact escaped death and continued to fight Montrose's cause after the latter's execution in May 1650. In December 1653, he was captured near Glamis and taken prisoner in Edinburgh Castle. Along with some others, the earl succeeded in escaping in May 1654. He joined forces with James Graham, 2nd Marquess of Montrose, being with him in battle at the Wood of Methven in June 1654. On 23 November, Kinnoull was again captured and taken prisoner in Edinburgh Castle, from which he again escaped. Upon the death of his cousin James Hay, 2nd Earl of Carlisle in 1660, Kinnoull succeeded him in the proprietorship of Barbados, but sold it to the Crown in 1661 for a pension. He married first Lady Mary Brudenell, daughter of Robert Brudenell, 2nd Earl of Cardigan. She was born 7 January 1636, in Northampton, and died in 1665. He married secondly, Lady Catherine Cecil, daughter of Charles Cecil, Viscount Cranborne. They had two sons, both of whom succeeded in the earldom: # George Hay, 5th Earl of Kinnoull (d. 1687) # William Hay, 6th Earl of Kinnoull (d. 10 May 1709) He died 28 March 1677 and was buried in May in Waltham Abbey Church, Essex. ==References== Category:1677 deaths 04 Category:Younger sons of earls Category:Scottish soldiers Category:Cavaliers ","title":"William Hay, 4th Earl of Kinnoull"},{"id":"46305554","text":"Sirindhornia bifida is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

ITIL describes processes, procedures, tasks, and checklists which are neither organization-specific nor technology-specific, but can be applied by an organization toward strategy, delivering value, and maintaining a minimum level of competency. It allows the organization to establish a baseline from which it can plan, implement, and measure. It is used to demonstrate compliance and to measure improvement. There is no formal independent third party compliance assessment available for ITIL compliance in an organization. Certification in ITIL is only available to individuals. Since 2013, ITIL has been owned by AXELOS, a joint venture between Capita and the UK Cabinet Office. AXELOS licenses organizations to use the ITIL intellectual property, accredits licensed examination institutes, and manages updates to the framework. Organizations that wish to implement ITIL internally do not require this license.

The band was formed by Nate Eiesland, Alissa Ricci and Ryne Estwing after the dissolution of their previous band, Scattered Trees, in 2012. On An On released their debut album Give In in 2013 and their second album And the Wave Has Two Sides was released in July 2015. The band went on hiatus in 2016. ==History==  Give In (2012‚Äì2013)  On An On was formed by Scattered Trees members Nate Eiesland, Alissa Ricci and Ryne Estwing in March 2012. The threesome discussed the idea of reforming Scattered Trees, but decided to go with the risk and excitement of forming a new band. The trio utilised a previously-booked three-week block of studio time to work on new material with producer Dave Newfeld in Toronto. The three were tired of the more traditional songwriting and recording methods they had used in Scattered Trees and followed their desire to use electronic elements and drum machines. Producer Newfeld focused on helping the band capture moments of spontaneity and emotion, rather than perfection. Nate Eiesland later revealed that his writing was a reaction to touring Scattered Trees' 2011 album Sympathy, during which he \\"left the stage every night on the verge of tears. The songs I wrote after that time were born from a new perspective I had on death, something stronger and less afraid\\". Themes present on the album are relationships, death, pain, ambivalence and apathy. The album's title, Give In, was summed up by Eiesland: \\"we wanted to capture on tape a moment of finding something new that works and in doing that, you have to give in to the process and be willing to put yourself out there\\". The band signed recording and distribution deals with Roll Call Records (North America), City Slang (UK/Europe), Tugboat and P-Vine Records (Japan). In late August 2012, the band made their first song available for streaming, \\"Ghosts\\". After augmenting their lineup with a live touring drummer, they embarked on their first tour the following month, playing alongside Reptar and Rubblebucket. The band made \\"The Hunter\\" and \\"Ghosts\\" singles available for download in November and December respectively, before beginning their tour supporting the album in January 2013, supporting Geographer. Give In was released during the tour on 29 January. Music review aggregator Metacritic gives the album a score of 81, based on four reviews. The band embarked on their first European tour in February and would perform a second European tour and two further North American tours before wrapping their promotion for Give In in mid-November 2013. The band released the \\"Boy from School\\" / \\"Unison\\" cover single mid-tour on 20 August.  And the Wave Has Two Sides (2013‚Äì2016)  The band began writing their second album while touring Give In during 2013. Recording began with producer Joe Chiccarelli and engineer David Schwerkolt at Sunset Sound in Los Angeles in mid-September 2014 and wrapped three months later. On 6 January 2015, the band revealed the album would be titled And the Wave Has Two Sides. In late February, the first song from the album was made available for download, \\"Drifting\\". After adding an additional live guitarist to their touring lineup, the band embarked on their first tour supporting the album in late March 2015, alongside Big Data and Chappo. In late April, the album release date was revealed as 24 July 2015.  Hiatus (2016‚Äìpresent)  In June 2016, the band announced a final North American tour for July 2016 and its subsequent hiatus. In late August 2016, the band reassured fans that it had not broken up. ==Members== *Nate Eiesland ‚Äì vocals, guitar *Alissa Ricci ‚Äì keyboards *Ryne Estwing ‚Äì bass ==Discography== Studio albums *Give In (28 January 2013, Roll Call Records/City Slang/Tugboat Records/P-Vine Records) *And the Wave Has Two Sides (24 July 2015, Roll Call Records/City Slang/Tugboat Records/P-Vine Records) Other releases *\\"The Hunter\\" (Download, 14 November 2012, Roll Call Records/City Slang/Tugboat Records/P-Vine Records) *\\"Ghosts\\" (Download, 4 December 2012, Roll Call Records/City Slang/Tugboat Records/P-Vine Records) *\\"Boy from School\\" / \\"Unison\\" (7\\"/download, 20 August 2013, Roll Call Records/City Slang/Tugboat Records/P-Vine Records)) *\\"Drifting\\" (Download, 27 February 2015, Roll Call Records/City Slang/Tugboat Records/P-Vine Records) ==References *Bandcamp profile *Last.FM profile *ON AN ON page on City Slang record label *ON AN ON page on Roll Call Records Category:Indie rock musical groups from Minnesota Category:Shoegazing musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 2012 Category:Roll Call Records artists ","title":"On An On"},{"id":"46305639","text":"Takis Dimopoulos ( Greek:Œ§Œ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ ŒîŒ∑ŒºœåœÄŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ, Pyrgos, Greece, 1898 ‚Äì Athens, Greece 1981 ) was a Greek essayist, novelist and philologist. ==Life== His studies at the University of Athens included classic literature, philosophy and pedagogy (School of Philosophy), while he studied French and German literature. He worked as a teacher at secondary education in high schools of Crete, Ileia and Athens. He was a member of the Association of Greek Writers and had collaborations with the magazines Anglo-Greek Review, Nea Estia, Nea Skepsi and Parnassos and also with newspapers like Avgi Pyrgou, Kathimerini, Neologos, Patris etc. He wrote on essays, prose and poetry. He dealt with issues of aesthetics and philosophy in literature (especially the poetry of Angelos Sikelianos of which he was the main and most important connoisseur. ==Relationship with Sikelianos== Dimopoulos was a personal friend of Sikelianos, apart from a keen scholar of his work, fact that gave a very personal/loving tone in his reviews and an 'insider' look at specific and difficult ‚Äìalways poetic- cases based in -very, possibly- private information. His relationship with the work of Sikelianos had been a constant attempt (and care) of analysis, interpretation and explanation of the principles governing the work, the causes (also the \\"organic\\": the unbreakable unity of the human spirit and body of Sikelianos resulting in his idiosyncratic trends and moods) that created the specific aesthetic and worldviews of the poet, that created the forms and genres with which Sikelianos expressed himself (both in lyric, if such a discrimination is permitted, and also in dramatic poetry, the literary penetration and critic of Dimopoulos is crucial and valuable).ŒïœÅŒ±œÑŒøœÉŒ∏Œ≠ŒΩŒ∑œÇ Œì.

Œ∫Œ¥' -Œ∫Œµ'. In Dimopoulos, Sikelianos found a staunch supporter of the Delphic Idea but also a rare tracker of the ideas and necessary predispositions to capture a vision of this magnitude. Dimopoulos wrote and spoke about the thought of Sikelianos (and hence) about the Delphic Idea: but not as an ambassador, but as a scholar who understood Sikelianos and therefore understood how the concept of Delphi as a forum for an international meeting centre of the most important scholars meant. These scholars would only have on their mind the \\"Love towards the fellow Human\\". In his studies, Dimopoulos, demonstrates the link and the integration of the Delphic Idea to the main poetic body of Sikelianos\` work, as something natural, a concept that encompasses many seemingly contradictory entities and concepts in a unified and multifaceted outlook.Œ§Œ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ ŒîŒ∑ŒºœåœÄŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ, ¬´Œü Œ¨ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÇ¬ª, œÄŒµœÅ.

The ancient-mythic, the Dionysian- Bacchic, the Orphic-secret, the physiological-regenerative, Christian, erotic and maternal, national and competitive, the universal, peaceful-conciliatory element were the poetic themes of Sikelianos that were made objects of research and interpretative effort by Takis Dimopoulos, in the form of finding and indicating the fundamental 'axes' of Sikelianos' poetry.\\"ŒîŒ∑ŒºœåœÄŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ, Œ§Œ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ\\".

It was responsible for defending eastern Scotland. ==Origins== Large numbers of Territorial Army (TA) units were converted to anti-aircraft (AA) and searchlight roles in the Royal Artillery (RA) and Royal Engineers (RE) during the 1930s, and higher formations were required to control them. 36th (Scottish) Anti-Aircraft Brigade (36 AA Bde) was formed on 1 May 1938 at Edinburgh, to command the units responsible for the air defence of the City of Edinburgh and the Firth of Forth. Its first commander was Brigadier G.C. Kemp (appointed 1 May 1938).Frederick, pp. 1048‚Äì51.Monthly Army List.Farndale, Annex J. Initially the brigade was formed within Scottish Command, later being subordinated to 3rd Anti-Aircraft Division when that formation was raised at Edinburgh on 1 September 1938 to command all the AA defences of Scotland and Northern Ireland. Subsequently, Anti-Aircraft Command was created on 1 April 1939 and took control of AA Defence throughout the United Kingdom.Routledge, Table LVIII, p. 376. ==Mobilisation== The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì63. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti- Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì66, 371. 3.7-inch HAA gun deployed in 1939.

They enjoy both administrative and financial autonomy and exercise devolved state powers in urban planning, environmental and energy policy, forestry, migration and citizenship.

Its main house is an International style structure, originally built in 1940 to a design by Wallace K. Harrison in collaboration with Isamu Noguchi, and rebuilt from the original plans in 2005 after a fire destroyed the original. Outbuildings on the property include three once-detached Shingle style cabins and a carriage house (now converted to a caretaker's quarters), all built in the late 19th century by Erastus Corning. The most unusual structure on the property is a large reinforced concrete bomb shelter, built in 1961-62 to design by William F. Pederson. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009, for its exceptional collection of modern architecture, including the Cold War-era bunker and a rare Harrison design located outside New York. ==Description and history== Sea Change is located just east of the tip of Sargent Head, a small peninsula jutting south from the larger peninsula of Mount Desert Island on which Northeast Harbor is located. The entire Sargent's Head area was acquired in the late 19th century by Erastus Corning, a prominent Albany, New York businessman and politician, and it was his family that first developed what became known as ‚ÄúSea Change‚Äù. At that time it was known as Stony Point. In the 1880s they built a handsome Shingle style estate house, on Sargent Head and a carriage house at one end of his property, at the location of the future ‚ÄúSea Change‚Äù. Erastus gave his son Edwin the land with the carriage house. Edwin enlisted architect Fred Savage to design a main house and three cabins that he called ‚Äúsleeping pavilions‚Äù. It was reminiscent of an Adirondack style compound at lakeside. This portion of the Corning property was sold in 1939 to William A. M. Burden, a scion of the Vanderbilt family and longtime president of the Museum of Modern Art. The Burdens named their newly acquired property ‚ÄúSea Change‚Äù after a line sung by the spirit Ariel in Shakespeare's ‚ÄúThe Tempest‚Äù The Burdens disassembled the Corning's main house (of which parts were reused by the Cornings for a more modest house on the remaining land), and commissioned New York City architect Wallace K. Harrison and sculptor Isamu Noguchi to design an International Style house as a replacement, which was completed in 1947. Harrison's design was a structure that was scaled to harmonize with the remaining existing buildings, using their footprints and massing as a guide in designing portions of the house, and integrating them into what became a large indoor-outdoor living space. The interiors of the cabins were renovated incorporating materials used in the main house and adding a bathroom for each bedroom. In the 1950s Burden retained William F. Pederson to redesign the interior of one of the three cabins. Pederson's most unusual contribution to the complex, however, is the reinforced concrete bomb shelter, which Burden ordered designs for after return from Belgium after a stint as United States Ambassador to Belgium. Burden had for many years consulted for the United States government on military matters, including nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology, and was undoubtedly aware of Soviet advances in those areas. The first designs for the shelter are dated September 21, 1961; the Soviet Union detonated a hydrogen bomb the following October. It consists of a large central chamber from which two hallways radiate; it has a sleeping capacity of 24. In 1999 the main house suffered severe fire damage. An extensive and comprehensive restoration was completed in 2005 using the original plans, under the guidance of architect Heinrich Herman and family member Jean E. P. Burden, restoring virtually all of the interior and exterior features and furnishings. The only changes were the provision of more modern kitchen appliances, and updates to the mechanical and electrical systems related to safety codes. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hancock County, Maine ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Shingle Style architecture in Maine Category:International style architecture in Maine Category:Houses completed in 1945 Category:Houses in Hancock County, Maine Category:Mount Desert Island Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hancock County, Maine ","title":"Sea Change (Northeast Harbor, Maine)"},{"id":"46305784","text":"Herbert von Einem (February 16, 1905 in Sarrebourg, Lorraine, ‚Äì August 5, 1983 in G√∂ttingen) was a German art historian. ==Life and work== Von Einem studied art history at the University of G√∂ttingen, the Humboldt-Universit√§t Berlin and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.

He was also a scholar and historian, becoming a member of the Academy of Athens. == Life == He was born in Ermoupolis, Syros on 23 March 1878, the son of . At the age of 13 he entered the Navy Academy, graduating in 1895 as an Ensign. At the time he was the youngest officer of the Royal Hellenic Navy. As a young officer, he served on the ironclad battleships Hydra, Spetsai, and Psara, the gunboat Alfeios and the auxiliary Kanaris. During this period he began his studies of the Greek seas and coasts, and composed, on his own initiative, the first studies on a lighthouse network for the Greek coasts. His initial proposals to this effect fell on deaf ears, however. In 1904 he was appointed a professor at the Navy Academy, in 1908‚Äì10 he taught aboard the training vessels Acheloos and Pineios, and in 1910 he was placed captain of the torpedo boat . In February 1910, in the aftermath of a series of ship sinkings, a new law sought to reorganize the Navy's lighthouse service, and Lykoudis' reports came to the attention of Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos. In 1911 he was detached to the lighthouse service as research officer, but he became its de facto head, a post that was formalized in 1915. By 1920 he had reached the rank of Captain, and remained in his post as head of the Lighthouse Service until he retired as a Rear Admiral on 5 April 1939; at the time, he was the oldest serving officer of the Navy, with a continuous service of over 53 years. He was immediately recalled to active service by Royal Decree, however, as a special counsellor to the Lighthouse Service and the Navy Historical Service. He finally retired in April 1941, following the German invasion of Greece. During his 25-year tenure as head of the Lighthouse Service, 191 new lighthouses were installed, or 140% more than in the preceding 85 years of the service's existence, and 35 more already extant lighthouses were taken over as a result of territorial expansion. He also made major efforts to modernize the existing system, installing electricity and plumbing in many extant lighthouse stations, pioneering the use of Dal√©n lights in 1912, as well as the first automatic lighting installation in 1915. In parallel to his work as head of the Lighthouse Service, he continued to teach at the Navy Academy, published a number of historical studies like the 1917 History of lighthouses on the Greek shores from antiquity to the present day, and wrote articles on naval issues for encyclopaedias. His study for the lighting of the Dardanelles‚ÄìMarmara Sea‚ÄìBosporus area was accepted without modifications by the International Straits Commission of the League of Nations. As a result of his scholarly activities, in 1929 he was elected as a supernumerary member of the Academy of Athens, becoming a full member by unanimous vote in 1939. He died in 1958. The Greek Navy honoured his memory by giving the name Lykoudis (A-481) to one of its lighthouse tender ships, which entered service in 1976. == References  Sources == * * Category:1878 births Category:1958 deaths Category:20th- century Greek people Category:Greek writers Category:Hellenic Navy admirals Category:Lighthouses in Greece Category:Members of the Academy of Athens (modern) Category:People from Ermoupoli ","title":"Stylianos Lykoudis"},{"id":"46305791","text":"Jean-Claude Garde (born 12 September 1960) is a French former professional racing cyclist.

He is remembered as the first chaplain and head of English studies at the United States Naval Academy and for his participation in the landmark 1852‚Äì1854 expedition to Japan under the command of Commodore Matthew Perry. ==Background and early life== Jones was born on his family's estate near York, Pennsylvania, in 1800, the youngest son of Robert and Elizabeth Jones. He was educated at Yale University, where he graduated as the 1823 class valedictorian. After two years teaching in Washington, D.C., he served as schoolmaster on board the Navy frigates USS Brandywine and USS Constitution and as secretary to Commodore Charles Morris. Jones was ordained deacon in the Episcopal Church in Hartford, Connecticut, on January 16, 1831, thereafter serving as a parish priest in Middletown, Connecticut. Jones rejoined the U.S. Navy in 1832, first as an acting chaplain aboard the flagship of the Mediterranean fleet USS United States, receiving his commission as a chaplain in the U.S. Navy on April 20, 1833. In common with other shipboard chaplains of the era, Jones was responsible for the academic training of midshipmen in his charge. With a lifelong involvement in naval education, Jones made written recommendations to the Secretary of the Navy in 1839 to establish a more formalized officer training program. His appointment as the first head of English and chaplain of the newly opened Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1845 and 1851 respectively, was a recognition of his public advocacy on this topic. ==Perry Expedition to Japan== Foreign cemetery at Shimoda, Japan, 1854. Lithograph first published in 1856 by Wilhelm Heine Jones was chosen by Commodore Perry to join as chaplain on his expedition to Japan, serving not only in a ministerial capacity but also as a chronicler of the expedition, amateur naturalist, and astronomer. Departing Annapolis on the flagship USS Mississippi on November 18, 1852, Jones journeyed with the squadron for over two years. The squadron cleared Hampton Roads on November 24, heading first for Madeira, rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and continued to Hong Kong, Shanghai, and the Ryukyu Islands before entering Tokyo Bay on July 8, 1853. Jones as chaplain kept the navy custom of holding divine service each Sunday while on board ship. According to the journal of Commodore Perry dated March 9, 1854, Jones was also able to conduct a Christian funeral on land at Yokohama \\"to the forms of the Episcopal Church.\\" The funeral was for the interment of Private Robert Williams USMC, who had died on board the USS Mississippi. After many centuries of enforced isolation, this Christian ceremony was a significant event in terms of freedom of religious expression in Japan. In all, Jones was to conduct four more Christian burials during the fleet's stay in Japanese waters, one such funeral at Shimoda captured in sketch by the official expedition artist Wilhelm Heine. Jones contributed extensively on astronomical observations of Zodiacal light to the third volume of Perry's published account of the expedition, Narrative of the Expedition of an American Squadron to the China Seas and Japan. ==Later years== Jones rejoined the teaching and chaplaincy staff of the Naval Academy on his return to the United States. He was stationed at the Philadelphia Naval Asylum at the time of his death January 22, 1870. ==Family== Jones married Mary Amelia Silliman of Brooklyn, New York, in 1837. She died in Washington, D.C., in 1865. ==Legacy== The Fellowship Hall at the Hope Chapel, United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka, Japan is dedicated in honor of Jones. ==References== Category:1800 births Category:1870 deaths Category:United States Navy chaplains Category:Yale University alumni ","title":"George Jones (navy chaplain)"},{"id":"46305806","text":"Ewa Pajor (born 3 December 1996) is a Polish football striker, currently playing for VfL Wolfsburg.

It is an album composed mostly of cover versions, a fact borne out of necessity as Almond found himself unable to write following the accident. Almond told Time Out that the album is intended as \\"a trip down memory lane, a musical journey from the 1950s to where he finds himself today\\". The album features collaborations with Sarah Cracknell, Antony Hegarty and Jools Holland, with some of the tracks also featuring members of Jools Holland's Rhythm and Blues Orchestra. ==Critical reception== The album was well received by critics overall. Thom Jurek in his AllMusic review calls Stardom Road Almond's \\"finest studio moment as a solo artist\\" and describes Almond's voice as having \\"never been less histrionic, yet more expressive\\". Record Collector critic Joel McIver calls Stardom Road \\"the campest album ever released\\" and summarises that it is \\"entertaining rather than cutting edge\\".

The Delphic Festival was inspired by the ideals adopted by Sikelianos and Eva Palmer, focusing on the solidarity of people all over the world and of mutual respect. The Sikelianos couple believed that Delphi could actually serve as a focal point for this global understanding, due to the Amphictyony which had been established there for centuries. They built a house in the region and prepared the celebrations which were about to have an international calibre. The entire endeavor was funded by the Sikelianos couple and was repeated two times (1927 and 1930), a fact which exhausted them financially and soon led them to separation. ==First Day (May 9, 1927)== The festival began with a tour of the foreign visitors in the archaeological site and the Museum of Delphi guided by Greek and foreign archaeologists, who were charged with the task of explaining the importance (both historical and aesthetic) of the monuments and ruins, which had relatively recently been revealed. Then (at 1 pm, according to the program) breakfast was offered, accompanied by traditional Greek music Bruce Merry, Encyclopedia of Modern Greek Literature, 2004, p. 397. (\\"kleftika songs\\") by villagers and the tour continued. At 4 p.m. the signal to the visitors to gather in the ancient theater was given by someone standing at the top of the Phaedriades, so that the three main events of the first day could follow: the hymn to Apollo would be performed by the choir and orchestra (as an opening act), the tragedy Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound would be presented and, finally, Angelos Sikelianos, the founder of the Festival, would speak to the public for the purpose of the Delphic Organization in antiquity and today. The first day was concluded with a dinner (at 8 pm); then, those visitors who had come by boat were escorted down to Itea to their ships.‚ÄúThe world‚Äôs a circular stage‚Äù: Aeschylean tragedy through the eyes of Eva Palmer-Sikelianou. ==Second Day (May 10, 1927)== The second day started with a morning visit to the Delphi Artisan Fair, where Eva Sikelianos talked about the importance of folk art and about the value of the work on the loom, of which she was particularly fond. At 11 a.m. a speech on the Ancient Theatre was delivered in German by the archaeologist Wilhelm D√∂rpfeld and at 1 p.m breakfast was served to the guests. Then at around 3 pm, two events took place: the athletic games at the ancient stadium (in which students in various disciplines participated by practicing the ancient pentathlon along with sports teams from the cities of Thessaloniki and Desfina) and the ancient Pyrrhichios war dance performed by 'warriors'dancers dressed in armors, under the guidance of Athanasios Veloudios to the sounds of the music composed by Constantine Psachos. At 7 p.m. a dinner followed and at 8 p.m. a performance of Byzantine choir music at the Ancient Theatre concluded the day. The weekend would be concluded with a dance-theatre performance, a mimic representation of the Septeria (the battle between Apollo and Python) by the \\"famous dancer of ancient Greek dances\\", Vassos, and the \\"mime\\" Tanagra Kanellos (both Greek expatriates who came from the US for this purpose) with the repetition of the hymn to Apollo in the end. The departure of the foreign visitors was accompanied by a torch relay on the Sacred Way (Hiera Odos) by athletes with torches who would light the way so the visitors could descend towards Itea. ==References== Category:History of Delphi Category:1927 in Greece Category:Festivals in Greece Category:May 1927 events Category:1927 festivals Category:Angelos Sikelianos ","title":"First Delphic Festival"},{"id":"46306090","text":"Delphic Festival can refer to a festival held by Angelos Sikelianos and Eva Palmer-Sikelianos as part of their general effort towards the revival of the Delphic Idea. *First Delphic Festival (1927), *Second Delphic Festival (1930).

Ikatan Peninsula is the southeastern extremity of Unimak Island in the U.S. state of Alaska. The peninsula is approximately 13 miles long. It is divided into three mountain masses and from Unimak Island by low depressions which extend from West Anchor Cove to East Anchor Cove and from Dora Harbor and Otter Cove to Ikatan Bay. Cape Pankof, the eastern end of Ikatan Peninsula, terminates in three cliffs on the southern side, the highest about 1,200 feet, but on the northern side there is a gentle slope to the low isthmus between East and West Anchor coves. Some bare rocks lie within 0.25 mile from the cape, on the southern and eastern sides. Pankof Breaker lies a little over 2 miles from the southeast point at the entrance to East Anchor Cove. Bird Island, about 0.5 mile in extent, 750 feet high, and precipitous, lies 2 miles from the south coast of Ikatan Peninsula, off the entrance to Dora Harbor, and 8 miles westward from Cape Pankof. A sunken reef connects the island with the western point at the entrance to Dora Harbor. East Anchor Cove is large and is on the north side of Cape Pankof. West Anchor Cove is exposed to southerly weather, but with East Anchor Cove on the other side of the cape, safe and sheltered anchorage from any ordinary weather can be found in one or the other. Dora Harbor is on the south side of Ikatan Peninsula, 2 miles north of Bird Island. The entire shore of the harbor is fringed by ledges, partly bare at low water, to a distance of about 300 yards. Otter Cove is an open bight at the northwest end of Ikatan Peninsula. It is exposed to southerly winds and to the Pacific swell, and there is always a heavy surf. Northerly winds blow over the low isthmus separating it from Ikatan Bay. A rock awash at low water lies over 0.50 mile from the shore of Ikatan Peninsula and 3.5 miles northwestward from Bird Island. The unincorporated community of Ikatan is located on Unimak Island and is named after the peninsula. ==References== * Category:Peninsulas of Alaska Category:Unimak Island Category:Landforms of Aleutians East Borough, Alaska ","title":"Ikatan Peninsula"},{"id":"46306149","text":"Monika Kuli≈° (born 20 April 1995) is a Bosnian football midfielder who plays SFK 2000. == External links == * Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina women's footballers Category:Women's association football midfielders Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina women's international footballers ","title":"Monika Kuli≈°"},{"id":"46306162","text":"Tigers Jaw is the second full-length by American emo band Tigers Jaw.

Its territory bordered in the north to the Ottoman Empire. In 1514, Ottoman sultan Selim I, nicknamed Yavuz, literally \\"Grim\\" or \\"Inflexible\\", waged a war against Ismail I of the Safavids in Iran. His campaign route was close to Dulkadir border, and Selim I asked Bozkurt of Dulkadir to participate in the campaign. But Bozkurt refused to participate using the pretext of his old age. Also some tribes under his command disturbed supply units of the Ottoman army.Prof. Ya≈üar Y√ºce-Prof. Ali Sevim: T√ºrkiye tarihi Cilt II, AKDTYKTTK Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, 1991, p 241-242 ==After the campaign== After the Iran campaign, Selim I decided to end the Beylik. Instead of returning to ƒ∞stanbul, he waited in Central Anatolia with the main army and sent a force of 40,000 men under the commandship of Hadim Sinan Pasha, one of his viziers to conquer Dulkadir territory. Ali Bey, a relative of Bozkurt, who had previously escaped to the Ottomans, was with Sinan as a guide. ==The battle== Early fighting took place on 13 June 1515 close to G√∂ksun, what is today a town in Kahramanmara≈ü Province in Turkey. Although the Ottomans were victorious, Bozkurt was able to escape to southeast. The final clash was in Turnadaƒü, a mountain range now called Nurhak in Kahramanmara≈ü Province. At the end of the battle, Dulkadir army was totally defeated. Both Bozkurt and his sons were killed in the battle. ==Aftermath== After the battle, Beylik of Dulkadir ceased to exist. It was converted to an Ottoman sanjak, (Ottoman administrative unit). The first governor of the sanjak became Ali Bey of the Dulkadir. Hadim Sinan Pasha was promoted to be the grand vizier. The next year, Selim I waged a war against Egypt, and Egypt as well as Syria and Palestine came under the Ottoman rule. ==References== Turnadag Category:History of Kahramanmara≈ü Province Category:Dulkadirids Category:1515 in Asia Category:Conflicts in 1515 Category:Anatolian beyliks ","title":"Battle of Turnadaƒü"},{"id":"46306284","text":"Ey√∞v√∏r Klakstein (born 5 September 1995) is a Faroese football midfielder who currently plays for Mislata CF.

He was responsible for commissioning and directing the early plays of Caryl Churchill, Joe Orton, Tom Stoppard and Sue Townsend. Tydeman was the head of BBC Radio Drama from 1986 to 1994. == Education and military service== Tydeman was educated at Hertford Grammar School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He served as a 2nd Lieutenant in the 1st Singapore Regiment of the Royal Artillery in Malaya, 1954-1956. == Early BBC career == Even before joining the BBC as a general trainee, following his graduation from Trinity in 1959, Tydeman had received a credit on the BBC Third Programme, as an actor. He appeared in the radio broadcast of the Cambridge University Marlowe Society‚Äôs production of Christopher Marlowe's Edward II.Cambridge University Marlowe Society radio broadcast of Christopher Marlowe Edward II, BBC Third Programme, 31 March 1959, BBC Genome Tydeman played the Archbishop of Canterbury in a cast led by Derek Jacobi as Edward II, and student contemporaries including John Drummond, Clive Swift and Richard Cottrell, directed by Trinity alumnus Toby Robertson. Edward II was broadcast on 31 March 1959, and Tydeman joined the BBC as a general trainee later in the year, working in various parts of the Corporation, until he settled into the Radio Drama department. There he would cut his teeth on productions that would include many episodes of the popular radio soap, The Dales, as well as forays into the classics. His first radio production credit in drama was Operation Toothless, by Tom Waldron, on the BBC Home Service on 20 July 1959.First Tydeman production, BBC Genome, Operation Toothless, BBC Home Service, 20 July 1959 Within four years. he would establish himself as one of the most dynamic new talents in radio drama, progressing through soap opera and the relentless demand for popular afternoon entertainment to the challenges of Jean Genet‚Äôs The Maids (with Sian Phillips), and working with many of the leading actors of the time, from radio stalwarts such as Mary Wimbush to rising talents such as Michael Bryant and John Wood. He also put his hand to adapting works such as Rudyard Kipling‚Äôs Kim, Henry James‚Äôs The Turn of the Screw and Jane Austen‚Äôs Emma. Among the writers he would produce were David Rudkin, Cries from Casement as His Bones are Brought to Dublin (1973) , Edward Bond (Narrow Road to the Deep North), William Trevor (Scenes from an Album) and David Cregan and Tom Stoppard on many occasions. Although Caryl Churchill‚Äôs first play for radio, The Ants (produced by Michael Bakewell, was broadcast three times in 1962-63, the recording was not retained in the BBC Archives. For Churchill, as for Stoppard, the freedom of the radio form was significant in the development of their writing. Churchill‚Äôs work with Tydeman shows an unfettered imagination at work. The plays Identical Twins, Shreber‚Äôs Nervous Illness, Henry‚Äôs Past, Abortive, Not, Not, Not, Not, Not Enough Oxygen and Perfect Happiness do survive in the BBC, and foreshadow the freedom and discipline of her later stage work. Kenneth Haigh‚Äôs performance as twin brothers in Identical Twins, a 'duologue', is a tour-de- force of radio acting and writing. == Association with Joe Orton == Early in his BBC career, Tydeman became inextricably linked with Joe Orton, whom he was widely seen to have discovered. Tydeman saw his championing of Orton as more of a successful rescue from the rejection pile, as he recorded his memories for the BBC at the time of retirement as Head of Radio Drama in 1994.History of the BBC, The Strange Survival of Raid Drama. \\"The truth of that particular story is that I was in the Drama Department, very fresh from university, on an attachment basis as a trainee and a very extraordinary fresh script arrived, which was about to be sent back ... It wasn't like anything else I‚Äôd read. It was called The Boy Hairdresser ... By some chance I read it, and I went to Donald McWhinnie, who was then Assistant Head of the radio drama department, and I said, 'I think it's remarkable, I think it's quite wrong that it should be sent back.' Donald read it and said, 'Yes, there's a talent here. Why don‚Äôt you see the young man'?\\" Tydeman also told that story to Brian Jarman of the Fitzrovia News in 2011, in an interview when he was still living in his flat in Great Titchfield Street, parallel to BBC Broadcasting House where he had worked for more than 30 years. He talked about Orton‚Äôs first appearance at Broadcasting House: \\"Joe was wearing bovver boots and khaki. He said he‚Äôd just come out of prison. He‚Äôd been had up for defacing library books. He was revolutionary. I was a bit daunted.\\" Orton had been released from prison in September, 1962, where he had written much of The Boy Hairdresser, the first script he had written independently of collaborations with his lover, Kenneth Halliwell. The couple had been sent to different prisons for the same offence of defacing library books. After the script‚Äôs journey through the radio drama department, Tydeman then guided it through three revisions, and when Orton came in to discuss the final draft, now called The Ruffian on the Stair, he presented Tydeman with a new script. As Tydeman tells it on the BBC History website, Orton said, \\"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a radio play.\\" Tydeman flicked through it: it was Entertaining Mr Sloane. \\"I was just dazzled by what I saw. 'Have you got an agent?' And he said, 'No. I haven‚Äôt' and I said, 'The best agent is, in my opinion, is Margaret Ramsay, Peggy Ramsay. Get in touch with her, say that I sent you. And she can be a bit of a cow. But if the chemistry‚Äôs right, it‚Äôll be terrific'.\\" \\"About a week later the phone rang, and it was Peggy, and Peggy Ramsay and I had a very good relationship, and she said, 'What‚Äôs this, darling? You‚Äôve been calling me a cow all around London'.\\" \\"I said, I‚Äôve done no such thing, Peggy. 'Yes, you have. A young man came to see and he said you said I was a cow. I may be a perfect bitch at times, but I‚Äôm not a cow. Darling, it‚Äôs absolutely brilliant. I‚Äôve been on to Michael Codron and we‚Äôre going to put it on in eight weeks'. \\" \\"And they got that play on in at the Arts Theatre, directed by Patrick Dromgoole, before I got the radio play on. I would say it was about ten weeks of Joe Orton having been in my office that they got the play on. As a result of that, Joe and I remained friends all of his short life.\\" Entertaining Mr Sloane opened at the Arts Theatre, London, on 6 May 1964. The Ruffian on the Stair was first broadcast on the Third Programme on 31 August 1964, with the 19-year-old actor Kenneth Cranham as the ‚Äòruffian‚Äô. ==Later BBC career== One of the most prolific of radio directors, Tydeman directed 27 of Rhys Adrian‚Äôs more than 30 plays for radio, including the Prix Italia winning Evelyn (1970) and Prix Futura winning The Clerks (1979). (Michael Bakewell directed five of Adrian‚Äôs plays, and Ronald Mason directed two.) He commissioned and directed Sue Townsend‚Äôs first Mole script for BBC Radio 4, when the character was still known as Nigel, in The Diary of Nigel Mole Aged 13 ¬æ, and he then entered into a correspondence with the fictional Adrian who submitted his poetry efforts to Tydeman at the BBC. It was Tydeman who brought Townsend together with the publisher Methuen after that first broadcast. Tydeman himself became a quasi-fictional character in Townsend's Mole novels. Tydeman became Assistant Head, Radio Drama (AHDR) in 1979, and succeeded Ronald Mason as Head of Radio Drama (HDR) in 1986. He retired from the BBC in 1994, but continued to produce radio plays as an independent. ==Other activities and honours== Tydeman‚Äôs association with Peggy Ramsay continued after he introduced her to Joe Orton. After Ramsay died in 1991 he became a trustee for the Peggy Ramsay Foundation, leading to his continued support for new writing after he left the BBC, particularly through administering the Foundation‚Äôs annual grant to the Pearson Playwrights' Scheme, (originally the Thames Television Theatre Writers Scheme and later to become the Channel 4 Playwrights Scheme). Tydeman's stage productions included Caryl Churchill's Objections to Sex and Violence (Royal Court Theatre, 1975), David Buck's dramatisation of Robert Nye‚Äôs Falstaff (Fortune Theatre, 1984) and Emlyn Williams's Night Must Fall (Haymarket Theatre, 1996). He was made OBE in the New Year Honours List of 31 December 2002. He received numerous other awards, including the Radio Academy‚Äôs Lifetime Achievement Award for 2010. == References == Category:1936 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:BBC executives Category:BBC people Category:BBC radio producers Category:British radio producers Category:English theatre directors Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:Prix Italia winners ","title":"John Tydeman"},{"id":"46306309","text":"Simon Pusey (born 1986) is a British journalist and television presenter now at BBC News.https://twitter.com/sipusey == Early life == Pusey grew up in Winchester and attended Winchester College.

It was popular among inhabitants of the Riau Archipelago and Malay Peninsula. It is primarily associated with Austronesian languages such as Malay, Tagalog, Sundanese and Javanese, but modern examples can also be found in English. The term is derived from the Malay words for 'four' and 'words'. Singaporean poets including Alvin Pang have been reviving the form for its elegance, versatility and association with Language poetry. ==Structure== The classic empat perkataan abides by the following rules and has no fixed length. * All lines consist of exactly four words. * The four words should not proceed in traditional sentence form but consist of fragments associated by either meaning or sound. * The lines are rhymed or assonant with a rhyme scheme either conforming to couplets (AABBCCDD), or alternating rhymes (ABABCDCD). * In its strictest form, all of the words in an empat perkataan should be of two syllables. At its best, the empat perkataan can create a surprising confluence of associated meaning and mood reminiscent of more post-modern forms. ==Variants== The classic version of the form with adherence to all rules is known as the empat perkataan perempuan. Less adherent versions omitting the two-syllable rule are known as empat perkataan sajak, whereas the simplest version not adhering to any rhyme scheme or syllabic constraints is known as the empat perkataan kosong. ==See also== *Pantoum or Pantun *Syair *Hainteny ==References== Empat Perkataan Poetry, article by John Reinhart Category:Singaporean literature Category:Singaporean poetry ","title":"Empat perkataan"},{"id":"46306418","text":"Not to be confused with Broken Homes (1926 film) directed by Hugh Dierker Broken Homes is the fourth novel in the Rivers of London series by English author Ben Aaronovitch, published 2013 by Gollancz. ==Plot== Constable Peter Grant and Detective Chief Inspector Nightingale are called to investigate a road traffic accident involving Robert Weil. The investigating officers found human blood from a body in the early state of rigor mortis in his car. Subsequent enquiries lead to a shallow grave containing the body of a young woman killed with and disfigured by a shotgun whose fingers have been removed. Peter initially assumes Weil is a serial killer, but he and Nightingale learn that Weil is on their list of Little Crocodiles, members of an Oxford University dining club who were taught magic by Geoffrey Wheatcroft. Meanwhile, PC Lesley May, still on indefinite sick leave after suffering a magical attack that resulted in catastrophic facial injuries in Rivers of London, returns to The Folly after her latest round of reconstructive surgery. Nightingale instructs Peter and Lesley in the art of magical staff-making in the hopes of drawing out the Faceless Man. Sergeant Jaget Kumar calls in Peter to help with a case. Richard Lewis, on the Little Crocodile watch list, committed suicide by train while showing signs of being controlled through magic. Peter uncovers a rare German Grimoire handed in by a book dealer, who suspected it was stolen. CCTV coverage of the surrounding area leads Peter to the suspected thief, one Patrick Mulhern. Peter pays him a call but finds Mulhern dead by magic. While the house yields no clues, Mulhern's theft of one of Erik Stomberg's books takes Peter to the architect's home, West Hill House. Skygarden Tower is regarded as Stromberg's most significant work. Stromberg habitually sat drinking coffee beside his brass-bound telescope, and Peter uses a spell to see what Stromberg's telescope once revealed: Skygarden Tower in extreme close-up. Taking a break from investigation to provide a visible police presence, Peter, Lesley, Nightingale and Abigail ‚Äì as sole member of the Folly's junior wizard outreach programme ‚Äì attend the Summer Court of the God and Goddess of the River Thames (upper and lower reaches respectively) at Bernie Spain Gardens, doing so in their capacity as keepers of the Queen's peace. Returning to the plan to bait a trap for the Faceless Man, Peter and Lesley attend a 'Nazareth', or Goblin Market, a mobile event where the fey and magical practitioners meet to do business and socialise. There they recognise Varenka Debroslova, the late Geofrey Albert Woodville-Gentle's live-in nurse, who attacks them. When Nightingale hears Peter's account and examines the massive property damage she inflicted, he identifies Debroslava as Nochnye Koldunyi or a Night Witch. Follow-up of leads at Southwark Council convinces the team that there is a connection to Skygarden Tower, so Nightingale informally authorises Peter and Lesley to infiltrate the tower. When Peter finally manages to get into the tower's garden, he discovers river spirit Nicky gamboling with an impish girl wearing a Mary Quant dress and a battered straw hat who plays hide and seek, generally acting more like a child than a woman, who the bemused Peter is convinced is some kind of fey but exactly what kind he can't work out. Effra explains the impish girl, named Sky, is a tree nymph subject to the seasons, and thus in spring is in a childlike state and not available for interrogation. Peter bridles at this but still manages to establish the tower (which she says makes 'happy music') is being visited by 'lots of lorries'. Peter discovers a book Folly archivist Professor Postmartin thinks significant showed up in connection to Stromberg's library. The title Wege der industriellen Nutzung von Magi√© (Towards the Industrial Use of Magic) convinces Peter that Stromberg built Skygarden as a magical experiment, but the details remain hazy. Nightingale reveals Dr Walid has found chimeric cells on the body of the young woman buried near Robert Weil's 'accident'. While Peter's theory fails to convince Nightingale and Lesley (possibly because he uses the simile of a Terry's Chocolate Orange), Peter remains convinced the Stadkrone or 'city crown' is intended to act as a magical relief valve. Lesley (and Zach) retire for the night while Peter watches TV (with the sound up) until they are all roused by a piercing scream. Donning their Metvests and grabbing collapsible batons, Peter and Lesley rush down to the garden and discover a biker trying to restart a chainsaw to finish ring-barking an ornamental cherry. Throwing the saw at Peter he misses but manages to escape, while Lesley examines Sky, confirming she has died, apparently of natural causes. In no time, Nicky ‚Äì resident goddess ‚Äì arrives distraught and angry, followed by Oberon who appears at the run, sword in hand. Nightingale, warns him against any interfering with the Queen's peace, since this would breach ‚Äòthe agreement‚Äô. Dr Walid, summoned as the only 'Falcon' competent medical specialist, confirms the man apparently died when his lungs filled with water, but of what kind he can't determine without tests. Peter and Lesley head to Essex to interview the Transit van's owner. Finding the farm given as the owner's address seemingly deserted, Lesley and Peter investigate and discover newly constructed sheds. Leaving with all due, haste Peter and Lesley walk out and into the arms of a pair of thugs, one with a shotgun. Peter manages to deflect the shotgun so it discharges harmlessly, but the Night Witch arrives and, despite Peter raising a magical shield, effortlessly knocks him down and detains the pair, hoping to ambush Nightingale. At the conclusion of the battle, after the hostages have been rescued, the Night Witch is in custody, and the local force arrives. Under questioning, the Night Witch, AKA Varvara Sidorovna, explains she was captured during the Great Patriotic War, and became a part of the Organisation Todt slave-labour effort to build Hitler's Atlantic Wall. In the confusion that followed the war she was able to avoid repatriation and obtain genuine identity documents and settled down to live a more or less normal life. Lesley and Peter return to Skygarden Tower where Peter discovers a recently vacated apartment filled with explosives. Peter and Lesley evacuate the building, with Peter taking the upper floors. On the roof Peter finds the Faceless Man waiting. Peter directs a magical attack at him which the Faceless Man effortlessly deflects, not understanding he wasn't the intended target, the charges go off and the Stadkrone finally fulfils its intended purpose. Since the building is in imminent danger of collapse the Faceless Man flees the scene by jumping off the roof. Peter follows and catches the Faceless Man, who is concentrating on magically breaking his own fall and cannot knock Peter off. Upon landing Peter handcuffs the Faceless Man triumphantly. Peter is then tasered in the back by Lesley, who is now working for the Faceless Man, and Peter is left reeling. ==Characters== Returning characters * Police Constable Peter Grant; an officer in the Metropolitan Police and the first official apprentice wizard in sixty years. * Police Constable Lesley May; an officer in the Metropolitan Police.

The channel launched on 14 May 2012, and closed on 31 December 2014. The channel's name was derived from the digital channel number that the station was assigned on most digital television platforms. ==History== In December 1997, the VRT's second channel was split into two distinct channels: Canvas, aimed at an intellectual audience, and Ketnet, a children's channel. Both channels were broadcast on the same frequency: Ketnet typically ran from 6am until 8pm, with Canvas broadcasting from 8pm until the early hours of the morning. This setup remained in place until early 2012, when the VRT decided to extend the broadcasting hours of Canvas, in order to broadcast more documentaries, archival content, current affairs and political coverage; as a result, on 1 May 2012, Canvas and Ketnet were split, with Ketnet moving to channel 12 on most television platforms. On 14 May 2012, OP12 began evening broadcasts: these were primarily aimed at young people and expatriates living in Flanders, with cultural events and sport also being broadcast. The aim of the third channel was also to further strengthen the public mission of the VRT. In its first year of broadcasting, the channel primarily broadcast sport and programmes aimed at young people; in the autumn of 2013 followed a more comprehensive range of programming, albeit consisting largely of repeats. The OP12 name was often used in combination with some of the famous brands of the VRT; for example, concerts would often be broadcast under the name \\"Studio Brussel op 12\\" (Studio Brussel on 12), and live sports broadcasts under the name \\"Sporza op 12\\" (Sporza on 12). Due to financial cutbacks, the VRT announced that evening broadcasts on OP12 would cease on December 31, 2014. The channel remains in use for overspill; for example, during major sporting events, and when extra programming from E√©n and Canvas is broadcast, under the respective titles Een+ and Canvas+. ==Programmes== * Carte Blanche * Fans of Flanders * The New Generation * De nieuwe lichting * My Mad Fat Diary * An Idiot Abroad - The Seven Wonders * The Fades * Wolven with audio description * Buiten de zone * dasbloghaus.tv * De Ridder with audio description * In Vlaamse velden with audio description * Magazinski * Push-it * True Blood * World of Jenks * Stille Waters with audio description * Witse with audio description ==Logos== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"1\\" style=\\"border:1px solid #aaa\\" - align=center !height=\\"150px\\" bgcolor=\\"#F9F9F9\\"  120px !height=\\"150px\\" bgcolor=\\"#F9F9F9\\"  120px - !width=\\"150px\\" colspan=\\"1\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\"  OP12 logo used from 2012 - 2014 !width=\\"150px\\" colspan=\\"1\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\"  Ketnet op 12 logo } ==See also== * E√©n * Canvas * Ketnet * List of television channels in Belgium * Sporza * VRT ==References *Official site *Gebruik van de naam OP12 - VRT-Taalnet Category:Television channels in Flanders Category:Defunct television channels in Belgium Category:Television channels and stations established in 2012 Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2014 Category:2012 establishments in Belgium Category:2014 disestablishments in Belgium ","title":"OP12"},{"id":"46306442","text":"The history of limnology in Nepal focuses on the study of limnology in Nepal, which has been done by many foreign and Nepali researchers and students of Tribhuvan University. == Parameters == The research was done mainly on the following parameters: * pH * aquatic plants and their types * composition of fresh water * water and land relationship * seasonal changes in the lakes == Studies == * In 1970 The first study was done by a German limnologist L.Loffler in Khumbu area. * In 1980 there were 20 studies. * Until 1990 the number of studies were 20. * From 2001‚Äì2009 76 studies were done in lakes and ponds like Tilicho, Rara.

He was a founding member of the World Power Conference, a fellow of the Institute of Fuel and a founding member of the Irish Volunteers alongside his brother, the poet and politician, Thomas Kettle.History Ireland: Issue 1 (January/February 2014), Volume 22 ==Family background== Laurence Kettle was born in Malahide, Co. Dublin, one of twelve children of Land League leader and Nationalist politician Andrew J. Kettle (1833‚Äì1916), a founder of the Irish Land League, and his wife, Margaret (n√©e McCourt). He is the brother of writer, poet, Irish Volunteer and Member of Parliament (MP) at Westminster, Thomas Kettle, a man widely regarded as one of the greatest minds of his generation, who died in World War I. Andrew Kettle influenced his sons considerably through his political activities, having been involved from an early age in the constitutional movement to achieve Home Rule. Andrew joined Michael Davitt in the foundation of the Irish Land League and was one of the signatories of the \\"No Rent Manifesto\\". He had adhered to Parnell in the 1890 crisis, and stood for election as a nationalist candidate on several occasions.Cork Examiner, 25 September 1916: from Andrew Kettle's obituary (text in full in article on the latter) ==Early life and career== He received his early education in the O'Connell Schools, Dublin, at Clongowes Wood College, and at Faraday House, where he gained the Maxwell Scholarship. His varied practical training and early experience were gained with R. Stephenson, Newcastle upon Tyne, Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon, Switzerland, Soci√©t√© des Forces √âlectriques de La Goule, Switzerland, and the General Electric Company. He returned to Dublin in 1906 to join the corporation as works superintendent engineer and became deputy city electrical engineer in 1911 and engineer and manager in 1918. When the undertaking was taken over by the Electricity Supply Board (Ireland) in 1929, he was appointed adviser to the board. Portrait of Laurence Kettle by Se√°n Keating, Hugh Lane Gallery, Dublin From 1934 until his retirement in 1950 he was a member of the board. He also applied his engineering training and judgment towards promoting the development of Irish national resources. His experience as the technical representative in Ireland of the Board of Trade Coal Department led him to give full support to all projects for the economical use of fuel. He acted on the Water Power Board of Ireland Sub-Committee from 1916 to 1918, and during the 1916 Rising was held captive by the insurgents in the College of Surgeons, before resuming his responsibilities for the city‚Äôs power supply. In 1912, he took a leading part in the formation of the Irish Volunteers, becoming secretary of its provisional committee together with Eoin MacNeill.History Ireland: Issue 1 (January/February 2014), Volume 22 He was a founder-member of the World Power Conference and secretary of the Irish Committee for many years, a member of the Irish Committee of The Institution of Mechanical Engineers and a Fellow of the Institute of Fuel. He joined The Institution as a Student in 1899 and was elected an Associate in 1902, an Associate Member in 1906 and a Member in 1912. He served on the Dublin Local Centre Committee in 1913‚Äî14 and on the Irish Centre Committee from 1926 to 1931, being chairman from 1926 to 1928 and serving as honorary treasurer from 1933 to 1934. In 1933 friends and admirers of his public services made him a presentation, including his portrait by Se√°n Keating, now in the municipal art gallery. As President of The Institution of Civil Engineers from 1932 to 1934, he delivered an address calling for an investigation into the scientific problems of agriculture, a survey for drainage and a scheme for rural electrification. While president, he organized in 1934 a discussion on the organization of industrial research in Ireland. In that year he was appointed chairman of the newly formed Industrial Research Council and held office until 1957. He became the first chairman of the Industrial Research Committee, resigning in 1947. The movement for industrial research in Ireland owed much to his patient service. On the formation of the Industrial Credit Co. in 1933, to promote and finance by State aid industrial undertakings, he was appointed and remained a director, and in 1938 the National University of Ireland conferred on him the degree of D.Sc. honoris causa. ==References== Category:1878 births Category:1960 deaths Category:Irish civil engineers Category:People from Malahide Category:People educated at O'Connell School ","title":"Laurence Kettle"},{"id":"46306449","text":"Foxglove Summer is the fifth novel in the Rivers of London series by English author Ben Aaronovitch, published 2014 by Gollancz. == Plot == The protagonist Peter Grant is left shaken by the developments at the end of the previous book, the sudden betrayal and defection by a highly valued colleague to whom Grant also had a strong emotional tie. The moping Grant welcomes the chance to leave the familiar grounds of London and travel to rural Herefordshire, where the disappearance of two eleven-year old girls is a media sensation, the focus of an intensive police search - and might have grave magical implications as well. Grant finds that the tangle of marital and extra-marital relations in a small rural community is not only a matter for gossip, but bears very serious criminal implications, and some supernatural ones as well. He meets with a retired wizard, traumatized by the secret magical battles of World War II, and with the wizard's granddaughter who has a very special affinity with bees. Grant gets into intensive contact with Beverley Brook, the goddess or Genius loci of Beverley Brook, a tributary of the Thames - and learns by personal experience just how rivers gain such gods. He finds that unicorns are all too real and that their horns are deadly weapons; that fairies do exist and even in the 21st century they do sometimes kidnap human children and replace them with changelings; and he meets with a real-life faerie queen, very different from the one imagined by Spenser. As the ultimate result of all that, Grant faces the prospect of being stuck forever as a captive in the real-life fairyland - an alternative reality or Otherworld where Britain is still covered with a massive unbroken primeval forest, with no sign of the familiar towns and villages. Grant's single, slender hope of escape lies in the lasting magical (or possibly anti-magical) effect of the Roman Empire's engineering projects and of the Romans' habit of imposing themselves on the landscape and building \\"roads straight as an arrow\\" wherever they ruled. ==Characters== Returning characters * Police Constable Peter Grant; an officer in the Metropolitan Police and the first official apprentice wizard in sixty years. * Lesley May; formerly Police Constable in the Metropolitan Police and de facto apprentice to Nightingale; now criminal associate of the faceless man and subject to an internal investigation * Detective Chief Inspector Thomas Nightingale; head of the Folly and the last officially sanctioned English Wizard. * Molly; The Folly's domestic helper, of unknown species. * Dr Abdul Haqq Walid; world-renowned gastroenterologist and cryptopathologist. * Beverley Brook; goddess of a small suburban river and consulting ecologist.

Unlike a more typical sound reinforcement system, an A/B Sound System provides two electrically isolated signal paths from microphone to speaker, resulting in a system where signals from two microphones only interact acoustically and never interact electronically. This is accomplished by placing two separate loudspeakers at each speaker position and feeding the two speakers separate signals from separate microphones. The purported benefit of such a system is a reduction in phase cancellation and intermodulation distortion, and an improvement in speech intelligibility when two microphones are used simultaneously. A/B Sound Systems are unusual because they require double the speakers and therefore have double the cost. ==Origins== The development of the A/B sound system is credited to Martin Levan in 1988. ==Applications== Venues with A/B sound systems effectively have two separate sound systems which can be used simultaneously. Deciding what to do with such a system is generally an artistic rather than a technical decision, and so the decision is made by the Sound designer. An article describing an A/B system installed in the Helsinki City Theatre provides two potential uses for an A/B system: \\"One system provides the A mix of vocals, while the second system, in nearly the same position, provides the B mix of band and orchestra. The system is also useful when two singers are in close proximity, and placing them in different mixes can help avoid sonic anomalies caused by leakage between lavalier mics.\\" In an article describing the sound system for a touring opera, Michael Bodeen says, ‚ÄúI decided on an A/B vocal system, which would allow me to assign each child in the chorus to one of two matrixes. This made a complicated setup, but it helped reduce or eliminate the comb-filtering effect.‚Äù An A/B system is used in the Avon Theatre at the Stratford Festival in Canada. Stratford Festival sound designer William Fallon said, \\"I've found that it has also helped in creating separation and clarity in large production numbers, by being able to send half the cast down one path and the other half down another, either based on parts, blocking, leads vs ensemble, etc.\\" ==References== Category:Sound technology ","title":"A/B sound system"},{"id":"46306514","text":"Fort Vrmac (Montenegrin: Tvrƒëava Vrmac/–¢–≤—Ä—í–∞–≤–∞ –í—Ä–º–∞—Ü, German: Werk Vermac) is a former fortification of the Austro-Hungarian Empire located on the southern end of the Vrmac ridge near Tivat in Montenegro. Established in 1860, the present structure was built between 1894 and 1897, and saw action during the First World War, when it was heavily bombarded by the Montenegrins. It was repaired and disarmed before the end of the war and was abandoned after a period of occupation by Yugoslav troops. Today it is one of the best preserved Austro-Hungarian fortifications in the Bay of Kotor area. ==Background== Map of the Bay of Kotor in 1862 The southernmost tip of the Austro-Hungarian Empire included the area of the Bay of Kotor, which was used by the empire as a major naval base centred on the town of Kotor (known then as Cattaro). The hinterland behind the bay was controlled by the independent principality (later kingdom) of Montenegro, which controlled the mountains to the east of Kotor.Sullivan, p. 7 The Austro-Hungarians faced significant problems in holding on to the territory, as the Montenegrins and their Russian allies aspired to take control of the Bay and Austrian rule was not universally accepted by the area's inhabitants. Two serious rebellions were mounted by the powerful Krivo≈°ije clan who lived on the eastern flanks of Mount Orjen above Risan. In 1869 the clan defeated an Austro-Hungarian force sent to quell their rebellion, but Austrian control was reimposed in 1882. The Austrians responded to the uprising by building a series of fortifications around the Bay of Kotor and at strategic points further inland, and strengthening existing fort, including the one at Vrmac. ==Location== Fort Vrmac is situated on Vrmac, a limestone ridge that rises to and divides the inner and outer part of the Bay of Kotor. It overlooks Kotor to the east, the Troica pass leading to Kotor to the south, and the ≈Ωupa valley to the west. The fort is reached via a military road built by the Austro-Hungarians that runs over the top of the ridge from Troica to Gornja Lastva in Tivat municipality, or alternatively via a winding path that leads up the mountainside from Muo, a suburb of Kotor. Its position was chosen to enable it to support the outlying Fort Gorazda on the other side of the Troica pass and the ≈†kaljari Battery to the south. From 1909, it was also supported by Fort Tra≈°te located on the hills above the plain of Tivaksko polje to the west. The location is highly strategic but was vulnerable to artillery attack from the heights of Mount Lovƒáen on the other side of the Bay of Kotor.Sullivan, pp. 21‚Äì3 An Austrian publication of 1870 commented that the fortification's \\"central position ensures the possession of the whole Bocche [Bay of Kotor]. Here's accommodation and magazine buildings. Cisterns, depots, hospitals, defensive barracks and finally fortifications have been created, which make this position a truly impregnable rock castle...\\" However, it noted frankly that Austrian control of the Bay of Kotor was tenuous: \\"One shouldn't deceive oneself about the claim to control of the whole Bocche! Surrounded by an unreliable population that unabashedly gravitates toward Montenegro, our troops in the Bocche will be confined to fortified places and the area that their cannons control the moment Russian ships appear in the Adriatic Sea.\\" ==Description== The fort comprises a heavily reinforced stone and concrete structure situated within a ditch, defended by three caponiers. There is a single entrance on the north side, accessed from the ditch and protected by a caponier. The design is similar to that of the \\"Vogl period\\" fortresses in South Tyrol, with an irregular pentagonal shape constructed on two levels. The main guns were housed in armoured casemates, with howitzers and observation turrets in steel cupolas made by ≈†koda in Pilsen. The roof of the fort is a thick slab of concrete that was installed in 1906‚Äì7 following improvements to Montenegrin artillery capabilities. The barracks rooms are located on the ground and first floors on the north side while the casemates are situated on the other sides of the fort, facing towards what was then potentially hostile territory. A separate structure a short distance to the north of the fort was used as an ammunition magazine.Sullivan, p. 27 ==History== A fort was built on Vrmac as early as 1860, but it played only a minor part in the military actions of 1869 and 1882. The Krivo≈°ije rebellions prompted a decision by the Austro-Hungarian Reichsbefestigungskommission (State Fortification Commission) to replace it with a more advanced fortress. Constructed between 1894 and 1897, it was armed with eight minimum charter M80/85 mortars and four PH M05 guns, plus 12 gun carriages. It was initially designed to be able to accommodate four field guns erected on the roof, to be used for close defence. This unusual feature was removed in the 1906-7 strengthening of the fortress, following which it was redesignated as being purely for long-ranged artillery. By the outbreak of the First World War it was the most modern fortress in the vicinity of the naval base at Kotor and was the centre of the Austro-Hungarian Third Military District's defences. However, it was regarded as outdated by this point and a new bomb-proof fortress was envisaged on Hoher Vrmac (Sveti Ilija), the highest point on the ridge, about to the north. The war made such an undertaking impossible and the five officers and 177 men stationed at Vrmac found themselves the target of heavy bombardments from Montenegrin territory, from weapons of up to calibre. The fortress was heavily damaged but after the Austrians seized Lovƒáen in the spring of 1916 and drove the Montenegrins out of artillery range, the damage was fully repaired. Its guns were removed and reused elsewhere. After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of the war, the Bay of Kotor became part of the territory of Yugoslavia. Fort Vrmac was occupied for some years by the Royal Yugoslav Army before being abandoned. At some point during the Yugoslav tenure, one of the casemates was painted with icons depicting figures from Eastern Orthodox Christianity. The fortress remains in an abandoned condition; it is well-preserved overall and is the best-preserved of the fortifications on Vrmac. It can be visited by the public, though care needs to be taken, as there are open pits and holes in the floors.Sullivan, p. 25 ==References== Vrmac Category:Tivat Municipality Category:Government buildings completed in 1897 ","title":"Fort Vrmac"},{"id":"46306525","text":"Interior of the Oakland Municipal Garage and Repair Shop. A combination hose and chemical truck is under construction. Oakland Municipal Garage and Repair Shop Oakland Municipal Garage and Repair Shop Oakland Municipal Garage and Repair Shop was located in Oakland, California, US, a short distance from the city hall. The plant was under the supervision of the Street Department of the City of Oakland. It was established by the city in 1913 for the maintenance and repair of all municipal automobiles. It was said to be the most economically operated in the United States when comparison was made with corresponding costs of cars operated by large public service corporations, mercantile establishments, and garages operated by other municipalities. ==History== In 1913, the city of Oakland found that its automobile service called for attention, lest the operating cost should run beyond all fair proportions. To this end, with the cooperation of the Commissioner of Streets, the municipal garage was established in March, 1913, where every city department car could be brought under systematic control and supervision. The only exceptions were the police and the fire department machines, which were required to be handled within those departments. For the first year of operation, ended July 1, 1914, the average cost per mile was $0.075, showing a reduction of $0.011 per mile for the first half of the second year's work. This comparison was in line with data collected before the municipal garage was opened. City machines were then under individual department control. For the six months ended December 31, 1914, the cost per mile for each city machine was $0.064, as compared with $0.082 and $0.094 by the two largest private users of automobiles. Further comparisons showed that city cars had operated at an average cost of $40 per month against $60 to $65 a month in private business, where the number of cars in service was in fair ratio to those of the municipality. ==Operations== Machine shops and all accessories for the entire care of the city machines was installed. The service rendered included not only washing, oiling, gasoline and tire supply and ordinary repairing, but the overhauling or reconstruction of machines, after they had been run 10,000 miles or more. Repainting, body-building and reupholstering were also done by the city garage force. Close-up view of the rear end equipment of a large oil-spreader constructed by the employees at the Oakland municipal machine shops. The municipal garage and repair shops included a complete machine-shop, blacksmith-shop, paint-shop, and two garages which provided storage for cars belonging to the following city departments: Street, Health, Park, Playground, Harbor, Engineering, Auditors, Electrical, Building, and Public affairs. The garage and repair shops maintained and repaired all these cars as well as the motorized fire apparatus, chief and battalion chiefs' cars, two patrol wagons and all the cars operated by the Police Department. A number of different pieces of apparatus were constructed in the municipal shop, these including fire apparatus, oil spreaders, and trucks. The department constructed a number of oil spreaders for spreading hot oil for use in new streets and also in repair work. The shops constructed a combination hose and chemical truck which was used in connection with the high pressure fire protection system. Steam engine fire trucks were motorized by installing front drive tractors, as well as several ladder trucks. At a cost of about $800 each, a number of Fords were equipped with Ralston truck attachment and specially designed four-yard dump bodies, which were employed in picking up the contents of the street sweepers' cans and hauling them to the dump. The machine shop has built a number of trucks for the sewer repair crews, using second hand Cadillac chassis and installing a small wagon bed in the rear of the seat, capable of carrying about 1,500 lbs. of material such as sewer pipe, cement, brick, shovels and other tools. Two patrol wagons were built, using Cadillac chassis, the bodies being made at the municipal shop and all necessary changes to the chassis, the cost being approximately $1,800 each. These wagons were used for police duty and ambulance calls. A stock room was operated in connection with the machine shop. It carried parts for all of the makes of cars in the various city departments. Gasoline for operating the automotive vehicles was bought in the open market and stored in two underground tanks with a combined capacity of 560 gallons. Lubricating oil was stored in tanks, two in each garage. There were three hostlers at the municipal shops whose duties consist of seeing that the automobiles were properly supplied with gasoline and oil, and were washed when necessary, the intervals between washings averaging about three months. In case a car was wanted at the city hall in a hurry by a department head, it was delivered by one of the hostlers. ==References== * * Category:American companies established in 1913 Category:Retail companies established in 1913 Category:Automotive repair shops of the United States Category:Organizations based in Oakland, California Category:History of Oakland, California Category:1913 establishments in California ","title":"Oakland Municipal Garage and Repair Shop"},{"id":"46306527","text":"KVLD may refer to: * KVLD (FM), a radio station (91.7 FM) licensed to serve Norfolk, Nebraska, United States * KCON (FM), a radio station (99.3 FM) licensed to serve Atkins, Arkansas, United States, which held the call sign KVLD from 2002 to 2015 * Valdosta Regional Airport (ICAO code KVLD) ","title":"KVLD"},{"id":"46306541","text":" The Dittmar HD 153 Motor-M√∂we was a West German light aircraft that was first flown in November 1953. ==Design and development== The Motor-M√∂we, designed by Heini Dittmar who had designed the Dittmar HD 53 M√∂we sailplane, was a motorized development of this sailplane and was initially designed to be powered by engines of .

Others regard it as merely part of this very variable species. Plants given the name Mandragora autumnalis consist of a rosette of leaves up to across, close to the ground, with a central group of usually purplish flowers followed by yellow or orange berries. The large tap-roots as well as the leaves contain alkaloids and are toxic. They have traditional uses as herbal medicines. ==Description== The boundary between the two species Mandragora autumnalis and Mandragora officinarum varies among authors, with some regarding them as the same species (see ¬ß Taxonomy below). Whatever distinction is used, plants of M. autumnalis are herbaceous perennials, with a large upright tap-root, often branched and sometimes shaped somewhat like a person. There is little or no stem, the leaves being borne in a basal rosette up to across. The flowers are clustered at the centre of the rosette, each with five sepals, five petals and five stamens. Both the sepals and petals are fused at the base forming two five-lobed bell-shaped cups. The ovary has two chambers (locules) and a long style. The fruit is a fleshy berry with many seeds. For those authors who regard Mandragora autumnalis as the main species found around the Mediterranean, it has flowers varying in colour but typically violet or purple, long, and berries that are yellow or orange and egg-shaped, while the much less widespread Mandragora officinarum has somewhat smaller flowers, greenish-white in colour, and berries that are yellow and globe-shaped. Those who regard M. officinarum as the main species found around the Mediterranean, with M. autumnalis being found only in the Levant, use the size of the seeds as one of the distinguishing factors, those of M. autumnalis being more than twice the size of those of M. officinarum. In Israel, where the native taxon is M. autumnalis in both approaches, it flowers between December and February, i.e. not only in the autumn as the specific epithet might suggest. ==Taxonomy== In 1753, in the first edition of Species Plantarum, Carl Linnaeus described a single species, Mandragora officinarum, for plants found around the Mediterranean. Jackson and Berry (1979) and Ungricht et al. (1998) have documented the subsequent confusion over the number of Mediterranean species of Mandragora and their scientific names. Antonio Bertoloni used flowering time to name two species: Mandragora autumnalis, the autumn-flowering mandrake, in 1820, and Mandragora vernalis, the spring-flowering mandrake, in 1824. M. vernalis is considered to be the same as Linnaeus's M. officinarum. Three interpretations of Mandragora autumnalis are in use: * Works such as Flora Europaea list two Mediterranean species of Mandragora: M. officinarum and M. autumnalis. M. autumnalis is used for most plants, with M. officinarum confined to north Italy and former Yugoslavia. With this circumscription, M. autumnalis is the main species of mandrake found around the Mediterranean. * Using statistical analysis of morphological characters, Ungricht et al. found no distinct clusters among the Mediterranean specimens they examined and concluded that Linnaeus's M. officinarum is a single, variable species. On this view, M. autumnalis is a synonym for M. officinarum and not a distinct species in its own right. * Other sources continue to divide Linnaeus's M. officinarum into two species, but differently. Plants from the western Mediterranean, from Turkey westwards to the Iberian peninsula and Morocco, are placed in M. officinarum; plants from the eastern Mediterranean, the Levant, are placed in M. autumnalis. One difference between the two species thus circumscribed is that seeds of M. autumnalis are more than twice the size of those of M. officinarum. A molecular phylogenetic study found that when defined in this way, M. autumnalis is closely related to Mandragora turcomanica. ==Distribution== In one treatment, Mandragora autumnalis is the main species of Mandragora found all around the Mediterranean, in Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, southern Portugal, southern Spain, southern Italy, Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Jordan, being absent in northern Italy and a region on the coast of former Yugoslavia, where it is replaced by M. officinarum. In another treatment, Mandragora autumnalis is native only to the Levant (from Syria south to Israel), the species found elsewhere around the Mediterranean being M. officinarum. ==Toxicity and use== All species of Mandragora contain highly biologically active alkaloids, tropane alkaloids in particular. Jackson and Berry were unable to find any differences in the composition of these chemicals between Mandragora autumnalis and Mandragora officinarum (using the broader definition of M. autumnalis). Alkaloids present included hyoscyamine, hyoscine, cuscohygrine, apoatropine, 3-alpha- tigloyloxytropane, 3-alpha,6-beta-ditigloyloxytropane and belladonnine. Non- alkaloid constituents included sitosterol and beta-methylesculetin (scopoletin). The alkaloids make the plant, particularly the root and leaves, poisonous. Clinical reports of the effects of consumption of Mandragora autumnalis include severe symptoms similar to those of atropine poisoning, including blurred vision, dilation of the pupils (mydriasis), dryness of the mouth, difficulty in urinating, dizziness, headache, vomiting, blushing and a rapid heart rate (tachycardia). Hyperactivity and hallucinations also occurred in the majority of patients. Mandragora species have a long use in traditional medicine, an extract being used for its real or supposed aphrodisiac, hypnotic, emetic, purgative, sedative and pain-killing effects. Tropane alkaloids are known to be effective as analgesics and anaesthetics, and can be used to increase circulation and dilate pupils, among other effects. Continued use of M. autumnalis in folk medicine was reported in Sicily in 2014. ==References * Mandragora autumnalis in BoDD ‚Äì Botanical Dermatology Database Category:Solanoideae Category:Plants described in 1820 Category:Poisonous plants ","title":"Mandragora autumnalis"},{"id":"46306612","text":"Fidgetin-like 2 (FL2) is a human enzyme that slows the rate at which skin cells migrate to wounds to heal them.

As a child he grew up in Billom, France. Following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, Adrien became a horseman, a Republican, and studied to become a radio engineer. ==The Youngest Captain== In 1939 Pommier volunteered to be enlisted but was refused as he did not yet have the required age. Leaving the recruiting center he met a member of the secret army of Billom, and after being recruited served as an intelligence liaison until he joined the Resistance's Maquis and was wanted by the Gestapo. ==The secret army== During 1940 at the age of 21 Adrien Pommier was enlisted in and joined the 28th regiment as a transmission operator. In parallel he had already been serving in the secret army one year prior and he continued to work on counter intelligence missions in Clermont Ferrand and the surrounding regions with (alias Mazieres) and Pierre Dejussieu-Pontcarral (alias Felicien, Chief of the secret army region R6). ==The resistance maquis== From 1941 to 1942 Adrien Pommier was known by the alias Arthur chief of the secret army 7th sub-district to then later become Captain Hoche in command of the 4th company F.F.I. (4th corps franc of Auvergne region) of the region Maquis du Mont Mouchet headed by Colonel Emile Coulaudon alias Gaspard. From 1942 to 1944 the 4th company, headed by its young commandant, participated in many guerrilla and sabotage attacks on the German occupants and French authorities collaborating with the enemy stealing gas, guns, ammunition, food, etc. ==Captain Hoche's 4th Company== During the period of June‚ÄìJuly 1944 and in the center of France in the Mont-Mouchet forest at the confines of Cantal, Haute Loire and Lozere was the theater of a battle between the German army and the French Resistance. Captain Hoche's (alias of Adrien Pommier) 4th Company and other FFI companies were posted between Saint-Flour and Clavi√®res during the Battle of Mont Mouchet. Outgunned and with almost no ammunition they engaged the German motorized columns from the Jesser Divisions between Claviere, Pinols and Saugues. The sacrifices of these Maquisards, with the heavy losses of 260 deaths and 180 injured, blocked 2 German divisions that were heading to the Normandy front. ==His Role in the Liberation== At the end of June and in early July, the F.F.I. Companies were regrouped, equipped and kept up the fight until the country was completely liberated. The 4th company, like most of the other F.F.I. units, joined the 1st army commanded by General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny. Adrien Pommier then assumed command of the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th companies that then became the 2nd Battalion (the Rapid Column 3) which participated to the liberation of Thiers, Puy de D√¥me, and later Lyon (the second largest French city at the time). ==Medals / Recognitions== * Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur * Croix de guerre 1939‚Äì1945 with star * Resistance Medal * Combatant cross * Volunteer combatant cross * Volunteer resistance combatant cross ==See also== *Billom *Clermont Ferrand *Croix de guerre 1939-1945 *√âmile Coulaudon *French Resistance *Jean de Lattre de Tassigny *Ordre national de la L√©gion d'honneur *Saint Dier d'Auvergne ==References== * Rispal, Manuel.

He played 15 seasons in the PBA. ==Playing career== Lim played collegiate ball at San Beda College where he was a member of the last championship team that won the NCAA crown in 1978 (it was then followed by a 28-year title drought that ended in 2006). While in the amateur ranks, he suited up for YCO Painters in the old MICAA, which was then coached by Freddie Webb. He was part of the Philippine training team of coach Ron Jacobs in 1981 that took home the Jones Cup title. He turned pro in 1982 and was signed by Yco-Tanduay. Lim moved to Great Taste in his third season and won his first championship with the Coffee Makers. He spent most of the 1985 PBA season with knee problems and on the injured list. In 1986, he was acquired by new team Alaska Milkmen and Lim shared playmaker roles with Marte Salda√±a and later on with Ric-Ric Marata. He was the last from the original Alaska roster to leave the squad in 1993 when he transferred to Purefoods. Lim won two championships with the Hotdogs before playing his final two seasons with Shell and San Miguel. ==Post-playing career== Lim coached the San Beda Red Lions in the NCAA, where he won four titles with the school in 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2011. In 2010, his team posted an immaculate record of 18-0 by sweeping all its opponents from the eliminations to the finals. In 2012, he resigned, just before he was set to serve a two-year ban from the NCAA for getting involved in a brawl with then San Sebastian College-Recoletos volleyball head coach Roger Gorayeb. In 2013, he briefly left the Philippines to coach Stadium Jakarta in Indonesia‚Äôs National Basketball League. In January 2015, he joined Ginebra as an assistant coach to Ato Agustin. After the team suffered another early exit in the 2015 PBA Commissioner's Cup, he was appointed head coach of the Gin Kings, replacing Agustin. In June 2015, Lim was fined and suspended for striking out at Calvin Abueva. Abueva clashed with Orlando Johnson after a heated play, before LA Tenorio shoved Abueva hard who fell close to Lim, who seemed to lash out. The Philippine Basketball Association suspended Lim for a game, also well as giving him a fine along with Abueva, Johnson, and Tenorio for their respective roles in the incident. Besides coaching, he previously served as team manager for the Mobiline/Talk 'N Text franchise as well as the Smart Gilas National Team, both owned by Manny V. Pangilinan. He is best known as a disciplinarian who employs the run-and-gun system. ==Coaching Record== Collegiate Record {class= center\\" - !rowspan=2Season !!rowspan=2Team !!colspan=4 Eliminations !!colspan=5 Playoffs - !W!!L!!PCT!!Finish!!PG!!W!!L!!PCT!!Results - 2007  SBC  11  1  .917  1st  3  3  0  1.000 Won NCAA title - 2008  SBC  11  3  .786  1st  5  3  2  0.600 Won NCAA title - 2009  SBC  16  2  .889  1st  4  2  2  0.500 Lost via sweep to San Sebastian in the Finals - 2010  SBC  16  0  1.000  1st  2  2  0  1.000 Won NCAA title - 2011  SBC  16  2  .889  1st  4  4  0  1.000 Won NCAA title - 2018  UPHSD  11  7  .611  4th  1  0  1  0.000  Lost to San Beda in the semifinals - 2019  UPHSD  5  13  .278  7th colspan=5Did not qualify. - !colspan=2Totals !! 86 !! 28 !! .754 !! !! 19 !! 14 !! 5 !! .736 !! 4 championships } ==References * Frankie Lim's Professional LinkedIn Profile Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Filipino men's basketball coaches Category:Philippines men's national basketball team players Category:Filipino men's basketball players Category:San Beda University alumni Category:Sportspeople from Manila Category:Basketball players from Metro Manila Category:San Beda Red Lions men's basketball players Category:Tanduay Rhum Masters players Category:Great Taste Coffee Makers players Category:Alaska Aces (PBA) players Category:Magnolia Hotshots players Category:Shell Turbo Chargers players Category:San Miguel Beermen players ","title":"Frankie Lim"},{"id":"46306653","text":"Stitchers is an American science fiction crime drama series created by Jeffrey Alan Schechter. The show was picked up to series on September 29, 2014, and premiered on June 2, 2015, on ABC Family (now Freeform). In an October 2016 Facebook Live chat, it was announced that the series was renewed for a third season, which aired from June 5 to August 14, 2017. On September 15, 2017, Freeform canceled the series after three seasons. ==Plot== Stitchers follows Kirsten Clark, who has been recruited into a government agency to be \\"stitched\\" into the memories of people recently deceased to investigate murders and mysteries that otherwise would have gone unsolved. Dr. Cameron Goodkin, a brilliant neuroscientist, assists Kirsten in the secret program headed by Maggie Baptiste, a skilled covert operator. The program also includes Linus Ahluwalia, a bioelectrical engineer and communications technician. Camille, Kirsten's roommate and a computer science grad student, is also recruited to assist Kirsten as a \\"stitcher\\". LAPD Detective Quincy Fisher is recruited and added to the team after crossing paths with Kirsten. ==Cast==  Main  * Emma Ishta as Kirsten Clark, a Caltech student recruited to the secret Stitchers program. She was given a diagnosis of temporal dysplasia, a fictional condition in which a person could not sense the passing of time, at the age of eight after her father attempted to stitch her into her mother while she was still alive, resulting in the death of her mother and the loss of Kirsten's memories of her parents. This condition hinders her ability to form relationships as her lack of temporal perception hinders her emotional connection to others; as described by her when she witnessed her dead foster father, from her perspective the moment she was told he was dead he had been dead forever. She eventually begins a relationship with Cameron in the third season. * Kyle Harris as Cameron Goodkin, a brilliant neuroscientist who is part of the Stitchers program. He had heart valve surgery at a young age leading to his first meeting Kirsten. Born under the name Cameron Miller but took his mother's surname when his father was sent to prison for fraud. He dates a girl named Nina he met at a comic book store in the second season, but after he repeatedly interrupts their time together to assist the program, Nina breaks up with him. He subsequently begins a relationship with Kirsten in the third season. During the third season he is also promoted to interim head of the team when Maggie is required to be elsewhere after she is made head of the overall program. * Ritesh Rajan as Linus Ahluwalia, a bioelectrical engineer and technical communications for the Stitchers program. * Salli Richardson-Whitfield as Magrittehttps://freeform.go.com/shows/stitchers/episodes/season-1/8-fire-in- the-hole \\"Maggie\\" Baptiste, a former CIA assassin and the leader of the Stitchers program. She develops a more removed approach after she becomes head of the program overall, requiring her to attend meetings in Washington and other matters on a more regular basis. * Allison Scagliotti as Camille Engelson, roommate of Kirsten and talented graduate student of computer science. It was revealed that Maggie assigned her to keep an eye on Kirsten by paying off her student loans and living accommodation. She has been trained by Cameron to operate the equipment guiding Kirsten through the stitch in his absence.

It serves to amend the Warsaw Convention. While officially the Hague Protocol is intended to become a single entity with the Warsaw Convention, it has only been ratified by 137 of the original 152 parties to the Warsaw Convention. The binding version of the treaty is written in French, but certified versions also exist in English and Spanish. The official depository of the treaty is the Government of Poland. __TOC__ == The Warsaw Convention == The Warsaw Convention was established to create a legal basis for commercial aviation, both cargo and passenger. Specifically, it allowed for the basis of liability to be assigned to air- carriers in the event of an accident. == Purpose == There were multiple reasons as to why the Hague Protocol was added as a provision to the Warsaw Convention. Firstly, as the original Convention was written in 1929 and with the advance of technology and law the original treaty had to be updated. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the Hague Protocol limited the liability that commercial airliners would have to take on in the event of an accident. == References  External links == *The text

It pitted the forces of Cormac mac Cuilenn√°in, king of Munster against an alliance comprising the forces of Flann Sinna, High King of Ireland, Cerball mac Muirec√°in, king of Leinster, Cathal mac Conchobair, king of Connacht, and Cellach mac Cerbaill, king of Osraige. It ended in a decisive victory for the alliance led by Flann Sinna. The Conflict arose after Cormac mac Cuilenn√°in assembled an army to campaign against his eastern neighbour, Leinster, whose king Cerball mac Muirec√°in was Flann Sinna's son-in-law and staunch ally. After this hostile act Flann in an alliance with Cathal mac Conchobair, king of Connacht, led an army into Leinster in order to help his son-in-law. Despite the men of Munster being outnumbered and peace talks being held between both sides, Cormac refused to surrender, it ultimately proved to be his undoing, he and Cellach mac Cerbaill were killed during the course of the battle. ==Background== The war started when Cormac mac Cuilenn√°in and an adviser Flaithbertach mac Inmain√©n assembled an army to campaign against their eastern neighbours, Leinster, whose king Cerball mac Muirec√°in was Flann Sinna's son-in-law and staunch ally. The Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, a source compiled in the 11th century for Donnchad mac Gilla P√°traic, king of Osraige, and king of Leinster, contain a long account of these events, perhaps written within living memory.Wiley, \\"Cath Belaig Mugna\\". Before the battle many men had deserted Cormac, because while riding through the camp Flaithbertach's horse stumbled and threw him to the ground. This, it is said, was taken to be a very bad omen. Many of the Munstermen were unwilling to fight, and news of this came to Cerball mac Muirec√°in, who proposed a negotiated settlement. The Leinstermen would pay tribute, and give hostages, but the hostages would be given to M√≥enachm abbot of Diseart D√≠armata (Castledermot, modern County Kildare), rather than to the Munstermen. Cormac, it is said, was willing to accept this settlement, but Flaithbertach‚ÄîByrne refers to him as \\"Cormac's evil genius\\"Byrne, Irish Kings, p. 214‚Äî was not and persuaded Cormac to fight, in spite of the king's conviction that he would be killed.Wiley, \\"Cath Belaig Mugna\\"; Russell, \\"Cormac\\"; Fragmentary Annals, FA 423. ==Battle== Already with a distinct numerical disadvantage the Fragmentary Annals say that \\"the men of Munster came to the battle weak and in disorder\\" and they quickly broke and fled the field. Many were killed. Cormac was among them, after his neck was broken from falling off his horse while fleeing with his men, Flaithbertach his adviser was captured.Wiley, \\"Cath Belaig Mugna\\"; Russell \\"Cormac\\"; Fragmentary Annals, FA 423; Annals of Ulster, AU 908.3; Annals of Innisfallen, AI 908.2; Annals of the Four Masters, AFM 903.7. Cormac was beheaded and his head taken to Flann Sinna. The Fragmentary Annals say: > \\"That is indeed evil,\\" said Flann to them, and it was not thanks that he > gave them. \\"It was an evil deed,\\" he said, \\"to cut off the holy bishop's > head; I shall honour it, and not crush it.\\" Flann took the head in his > hands, and kissed it, and he carried the consecrated head and the true > martyr around him three times.Fragmentary Annals, FA 423; Byrne, Irish > Kings, pp. 214-215, notes that martyrdom is the usual term used of the death > of a cleric by violence. ==Aftermath== After the battle Cormac was considered a saint, his death left Munster without its own king until about 914 when Flaithbertach mac Inmain√©n was chosen. The contemporary poet Dall√°n mac M√≥re created the following poem which laments those killed, it has been preserved in Annals of the Four Masters: > Cormac of Feimhin, Fogartach, Colman, Ceallach of the hard conflicts, they > perished with many thousands in the great battle of Bealach-Mughna.

The first church was built by Father Francisco Albear when Bangar was still a visita of Tagudin. A church made of stone and molave on a floor made of lime and pebbles, and roof of split bamboo was completed by Father Albear in 1689. Bangar became an independent parish on 1700 with Saint Christopher as its patron saint. The first parist priest of Bangar, Father Agustin Ancheta was assigned to the parish in 1708. Father Evaristo Guadalupe built a new convent in 1866 and completed in 1878. == Features == The church is a mix of Baroque architecture with Neoclassical features. Its facade has a mixture of Baroque, Gothic and Moorish embellishments. The Gothic features are present on the lancet-arched doorway and the choir loft windows; Renaissance features on the scallops framing the pediment; and Moorish features on the twin bell towers on the facade and another campanile on top of the pediment. It is the only church in Northern Luzon and possibly on the entire Philippines to have three bell towers.

Radio frequencies have no way of obeying geographical borders and licensing arrangements, and the extent of overspill depends on where broadcast transmitters are sited and their power. In addition to traditional transmitters, overspill occurs when the footprint of a satellite is greater than that needed to serve its target audience. Transmitters located near to international borders may overspill into a large part of a neighbouring country, for example the signal from Republic of Ireland broadcaster 2RN's Clermont Carn site can be picked up in a large swathe of Northern Ireland, and vice versa BBC broadcasts can be picked up in the Republic. Overspill is usually welcomed by listeners and viewers as it gives them additional choices, when for example the Republic of Ireland began to migrate to a digital platform measures were put in place so that viewers in Northern Ireland could continue to receive the channels they had become used to. However, legally and often politically overspill can be unwelcome. Broadcast rights are sold on a per territory basis, and overspill can be seen as harmful to the commercial and intellectual property rights of creators. Politically some governments may be wary of their own populace becoming too familiar with the culture of a neighbouring country or territory and feel threatened by it. For example, in China prior to its reforms, television dramas from Hong Kong could be easily picked up in neighbouring Guangdong, and helped spread the desire for greater liberty and material goods in Guangdong. Cross border radio and television reception was an important influence on political developments in Germany during the cold war. Overspill may have an accidental soft power effect, for example for many years listeners in the Netherlands were able to pick up BBC radio signals, listeners wanting to learn English would tune into the BBC leading to a British cultural influence on the Netherlands. Some nations will purposefully site transmitters and broadcast at a higher power than strictly necessary as a purposeful exercise in soft power. With regards to television, countries wishing to prevent this will choose a television encoding system incompatible to that of its neighbours. Overspill is used as a cover by stations, such as those known as border blaster and those of the radio p√©riph√©rique, where the audience supposedly accidentally receiving a broadcast is actually the intended audience. The transmitters used are positioned and are very much more powerful than that needed to serve their licensed audience. ==See also== *Rimshot (broadcasting) ==References== Category:Broadcast engineering Category:International relations Category:Broadcast transmitters ","title":"Signal overspill"},{"id":"46306773","text":"The Right Reverend Michael Louis Vono (born September 15, 1948) was the ninth bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Rio Grande.

The house was built in 1848 by Francis Hurt behind his iron forge in Ambergate. It was owned by the Johnson family of industrialists for many years who were benefactors in the local area, building the parish church of St. Anne at Ambergate. ==History== 19th‚Äìearly 20th century Originally a forge house, it was leased by the Hurts to the Iron Master Charles Mold, who died there in 1846. Hurt persuaded the young William Henry Mold to live at Oakhurst in 1847 and promised ¬£1,000 to rebuild it. Construction of the new house was by Robinson of Belper and the new house was ready for occupation in 1848. Mold occupied the house and forge until 1859 when all works ceased.Letter from William Henry Mold dated 1900 to H.A Johnson of Ambergate Wireworks, successors to Mold on the site The forge and house appear to have remained vacant until in 1876 the forge was purchased by the Richard Johnson and Nephew wire company of Manchester and a wireworks was established on the site. The house was retained by the Hurt family until 1888 when it was purchased by The Midland Railway, with their architect Charles Trubshaw extending the house for the chief engineer. Also built at this time were a range of stone stables situated just north of the house. In 1893, the house was purchased by Thewlis Johnson, owner of the forge, and it was extended further in 1894 by architect John Douglas in the neo-Jacobean Arts and Crafts style for which it is best known locally. Between 1924 and 1939, the house was used as a retreat for the local diocese. The house is described as a \\"fair-sized country mansion\\" with \\"accommodation for twenty four\\" and a \\"large room being converted to a comely chapel\\". Late 20th‚Äì21st century With the post-war housing crisis, Oakhurst House was divided into twelve flats during 1945. However, during the 1970s with the deteriorating condition of the building and an increase in local council housing the residents were found alternative accommodation. Since then, the house has remained unoccupied and is now derelict. In 1994, permission was granted to demolish the house as it was beyond repair; however, the permission has now expired and no demolition has taken place. In 2000 the wireworks and estate were purchased by the Lichfield Group and the wireworks are now used as industrial storage. The stables and various other estate buildings are now leased as private accommodation. ==Current deterioration== Through a window.jpgShowing current extent of dereliction with floor joists and window frames collapsed View of rear of house.jpgRear bay of the garden fa√ßade, constructed in 1894 with Johnson family crest Scale of deterioration.jpgInterior detailing on ruin wall showing where floor joists were hung and former fireplaces Oakhurst House.jpgShowing north-eastern elevation from drive, 1894 neo-Jacobean sections in fair condition when compared to rest of the house Category:Houses in Derbyshire Category:Country houses in Derbyshire ==References== ","title":"Oakhurst House"},{"id":"46306825","text":"Anton Igorevich Kalalb (; born March 16, 1988) is a Russian curler from Moscow.http://cloudfront9.curling.ca/2015worldmen-en/files/2015/03/EYE-OPENER- WED-ALL.pdf Kalalb was a member of the Russian team at the 2010, 2012 and 2014 European Curling Championships.

She was also a model and appeared in rock magazines like Creem. Her outlandish behavior and appearance made her a controversial figure in the music world for most of her life.Willy Deville obituary accessed 4/3/2015 ==Personal life and career== She was adopted and her birth name and family is unknown. She stated her birth family was of Pima descent. Her adoptive parents named her Susan Berle, and they were a wealthy Jewish couple from South Carolina; Harriet (n√©e Harrison 1916-1987) and Maurice Berle (1916-2005). She was an only child and her parents later divorced. Her adoptive father's last name was originally \\"Berlinsky\\" which he shortened to \\"Berle\\". His father was Philip Berlinsky, an immigrant from Poland that started the Berle Apparel Group, which still operates today. Little is known about where her stage name \\"Toots\\" came from. Her family moved to Stamford, Connecticut. She attended Dolan Middle School in Stamford, and ran away from home to New York City, and became addicted to drugs. Her parents sent her to therapy and rehab, and eventually she was sent to boarding school at Windsor Mountain in Massachusetts. She dropped out of school and became pregnant at age 18 in 1968 by a man named Brian, with whom she had her son Sean. She was also briefly married to a man named Robert Martin during this time. Growing up she was influenced by artists like √âdith Piaf and The Ronettes.Berle Group website accessed 4/3/2015 She met musician Willy Deville as a child while living in Stamford in the late 60s. They were separated when she was sent to boarding school, but they reconnected and later married in 1971 in Stamford.Marriage record accessed 4/3/2015 Willy's birth name was William Borsey, and he adopted her son and gave him his name, Sean Borsey. The couple then moved to New York City, living in the East Village, where the punk rock music scene was in full swing with clubs like the Fillmore East and CBGB. Mink DeVille became the house band for CBGB from 1975 to 1978, where Toots was seen often. The two had matching black panther tattoos on their shoulders. Toots posed for Mink Deville's Le Chat Bleu album cover in 1980. Some of the band's early songs mention a woman named \\"Sue\\" that was inspired by Toots. Toots is credited for managing her husband's early music career and influencing the punk rock era of music. She would go on tour with Mink DeVille in Europe, and is credited with creating their stage costumes. She was known for her outlandish behavior and drug use. She was very protective of her husband and various media reports stated how she would pull out knives on women if they flirted with him. Toots had jet black hair she would keep often in a beehive hairstyle, and had a nose ring and tattoos, which was still uncommon in the early 1970s. She posed as a model for rock magazines like Creem.

The cabinet was named after Reichskanzler (chancellor) Gustav Stresemann and took office on 6 October 1923 when it replaced the First Stresemann cabinet which had resigned on 3 October. Stresemann's second cabinet resigned on 23 November 1923 and was replaced on 30 November by the first cabinet under chancellor Wilhelm Marx. ==Establishment== The first Stresemann cabinet resigned late on 3 October 1923 due to disagreement between the political parties over the extent to which the planned Erm√§chtigungsgesetz should give the government power to change the length of the working day by decree. However, the Gro√üe Koalition (grand coalition) of DVP, Social Democrats (SPD), Zentrum and German Democratic Party (DDP) was not replaced by a new constellation including the right-wing DNVP that would have been consistent with the earlier decisions taken by the DVP Reichstag fraction. Since the majority of the DVP wanted to keep Stresemann in office and it proved impossible to form a different coalition under him, the original parties once again tried to form a government. Hans von Raumer (DVP) and Rudolf Hilferding (SPD) did not return, as demanded by the DVP fraction. Raumer had already resigned on 2 October, i.e. even prior to the whole cabinet's resignation the next day. To replace Hilferding at the Ministry of Finance, Stresemann considered Hjalmar Schacht, but had to drop the idea after Schacht's actions during the occupation of Belgium during World War I became the subject of criticism. Hans Luther thus switched from Agriculture to Finance. Von Raumer's successor was Joseph Koeth, an independent former officer and Demobilisierungskommissar. , at the Ministry for Occupied Territories wanted to resign but was convinced to remain in office. Finally, on 22 October, , another independent but close to the DVP and landed interests within the DNVP, was appointed to Agriculture. ==Overview of the members== The members of the cabinet were as follows: {  !colspan=\\"3\\" Second Stresemann cabinet 6 October 1923 to 23 November 1923 -----  Reichskanzler and Ausw√§rtiges Amt (Foreign Office)  Gustav Stresemann  DVP -----  Reichsministerium f√ºr Wiederaufbau (Reconstruction)  Robert Schmidt (through 3 November) SPD ----  Reichsministerium des Innern (Interior)  Wilhelm Sollmann (through 3 November) Karl Jarres (after 11 November)  SPD DVP -----  Reichsministerium der Finanzen (Finance)  Hans Luther  independent -----  Reichsministerium f√ºr Wirtschaft (Economic Affairs)  Joseph Koeth  independent -----  Reichsministerium f√ºr Arbeit (Labour)  Heinrich Brauns  Zentrum -----  Reichsministerium der Justiz (Justice)  Gustav Radbruch (through 3 November) SPD -----  Reichswehrministerium (Defence)  Otto Gessler  DDP -----  Reichsministerium f√ºr das Postwesen (Mail)   Zentrum -----  Reichsministerium f√ºr Verkehr (Transport)  Rudolf Oeser DDP -----  Reichsministerium f√ºr Ern√§hrung und Landwirtschaft (Food and Agriculture)  Gerhard von Kanitz independent -----  Reichsministerium f√ºr die besetzten Gebiete (Occupied Territories)   independent } Notes: Stresemann kept the Ausw√§rtiges Amt and thus was his own foreign minister. It is not clear from the sources whether Schmidt retained his position as Vice- Chancellor that he held in the previous cabinet. The SPD pulled out of the coalition on 3 November and its ministers resigned. However, before the cabinet's resignation only Sollmann was replaced (by Karl Jarres on 11 November). The other positions remained vacant. Kanitz joined the cabinet only on 22 October. Previously, the position of Minister of Food and Agriculture had also been vacant. ==Erm√§chtigungsgesetz== Hans Luther The Erstes Reichserm√§chtigungsgesetz (emergency or enabling law) was passed on 13 October 1923.Ernst Rudolf Huber: Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte seit 1789. Band VI: Die Weimarer Reichsverfassung. Kohlhammer Verlag, Stuttgart [u. a.] 1981, S. 439, S. 441.Ernst Rudolf Huber: Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte seit 1789. Band VII: Ausbau, Schutz und Untergang der Weimarer Republik. Kohlhammer Verlag, Stuttgart [u. a.] 1984, S. 363, S. 387. It gave the government the powers to implement by decree the measures necessary to stop hyperinflation. These included the replacement of the Papiermark with the Rentenmark on 15 November. Due to a lack of gold, the new currency was backed by a special forced mortgage placed on all land in the Reich used for business or agricultural purposes. ==Other major issues== The cabinet had to deal with several crucial issues that threatened the integrity of the Reich. The most pressing was the Occupation of the Ruhr, closely connected to the issue of war reparations, and the cause of economic collapse and hyperinflation brought on by the policy of passive resistance against the French and Belgian intervention. Stresemann had announced the end of the Ruhrkampf on 26 September, but production did not resume immediately. The second Stresemann cabinet thus was closely involved in negotiations that resulted in the ' a series of treaties signed between November 1923 and September 1924, named after the Mission interalli√©e de Contr√¥le des Usines et des Mines (MICUM), the French-Belgian commission for the occupied territories. It ended the ruinous period of work stoppages in heavy industry which had resulted from passive resistance. Since the payments to the occupying nations did not just reflect a resumption of reparation payments but also included recompensation for the occupation costs, they were seen as marking the failure of passive resistance and, ultimately, a capitulation by Germany to French demands. During the Occupation of the Ruhr, the French actively encouraged separatism in the Rhineland which resulted in the establishment of two short-lived separatist and pro-French entities - the Rhenish Republic and the '. Since these did not enjoy widespread support among the German population, they soon collapsed. The British government also resolutely opposed France's attempt to extend its sphere of influence permanently to all of Germany west of the Rhine. Finally, there were regional challenges to the Reich government's authority from the left (Thuringia, Saxony) and the right (Bavaria). On the left, the Social Democrats under prime-ministers Erich Zeigner in Saxony and in Thuringia allied to the Communists of the KPD, made use of the economic crisis and the threat of right-wing counter-revolution in Bavaria (see below) and set up Proletarische Hundertschaften (armed militia), soon numbering around 100,000 men. This brought on a confrontation with the government in Berlin, which asked president Ebert to declare martial law and set into motion a process of military action against the state governments of Saxony and Thuringia (Reichsexekutionen). On 23 October, Gessler ordered the Reichswehr to move into both states. In Thuringia, the militias were disbanded and the Communist ministers resigned. However, in Saxony, there was armed resistance and Zeigner refused to reshuffle his cabinet. Stresemann now appointed Rudolf Heinze Reichskommissar for Saxony. Heinze had the state government deposed and arrested. In Bavaria, a hot-bed of right-wing opposition against the democratic Reichsregierung and now home to numerous activists - like Erich Ludendorff, Gustav von Kahr and Adolf Hitler, Ministerp√§sident (prime minister) Eugen von Knilling refused to accept the authority of Stresemann's cabinet in Berlin and appointed von Kahr as Staatskommissar, in effect establishing a right-wing dictatorship in the state. It also declared martial law and considered a march on Berlin to depose the Reich government. Local commanders disobeyed orders by Hans von Seeckt, the Reichswehr's commander in chief. Since von Seeckt refused to use military force against the Bavarian government, however, there was no repeat of the events in Saxony. On 8/9 November, Hitler launched his Beer Hall Putsch in Munich, but von Kahr failed to side with him and had it put down by local troops and police. ==Withdrawal of the Social Democrats== On 2 November, the Social Democrats in the cabinet decided to withdraw from the cabinet, thereby ending the Grand Coalition. The cause was the toppling and arrest in late October of the (Social Democratic- Communist) state government of Saxony by means of a Reichsexekution. This was implemented by DVP member and former minister Rudolf Heinz. The use of a DVP man in this function was resented by the SPD. However, Hermann M√ºller (SPD) was willing to accept it, on the condition that the Reich government would take similar drastic steps to deal with the right-wing state government of Bavaria. This became the official position of the SPD Reichstag fraction on 31 October. It also demanded the end of the state of emergency in Saxony. This latter demand was refused by the bourgeois (DDP and DVP) ministers. In a stormy cabinet meeting on 2 November things came to a head and the SPD ministers resigned the next day. ==Resignation== With the move of the SPD into opposition to the cabinet in early November, the government's period in office was now limited to the time before the Reichstag was next in session. The president of the chamber scheduled a session for 20 November. Motions of no confidence against the cabinet were to be expected on that day. Stresemann decided to go on the offensive and the bourgeois parties introduced a motion of confidence. This was voted down on 23 November by 231 against 151 (7 abstentions). Since this was not a vote of no confidence in the sense of Article 54 of the constitution, there was no legal obligation for the cabinet to resign.

The Indians were coached by Pop Warner in his sixth year as head coach, last coaching the school in 1903. The team compiled a record of 10-1 and outscored opponents 267 to 62. Jim Thorpe, undersized even for the Indians, persuaded Warner to allow him to try out for the team. Thorpe immediately impressed his coach and secured a starting position on the team.Carlisle Indians made it a whole new ballgame, The Washington Post, May 13, 2007. End Albert Exendine was a consensus All-American. In the game against Chicago, fullback Pete Hauser threw a 40-yard pass to Exendine, who ran out of bounds, around spectators and players, and back on the field for the catch.radiolab Hauser became a star during the 1907 season. In an early game, he scored a touchdown and kicked a field goal in a 10‚Äì0 victory over Villanova. In October 1907, Hauser ran for a touchdown and kicked to goals after touchdown, scoring eight points, in Carlisle's 14‚Äì6 victory over the team from Syracuse University. In November 1907, The New York Times wrote that Hauser handled kicking duties for Carlisle, returned punts, and was also \\"the mainstay of the defense.\\" That same month, Carlise defeated the Harvard football team, then one of the top teams in the country, by a 23‚Äì15 score in front of a crowd of 30,000 spectators in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The New York Times wrote that Hauser's end runs were \\"marvels\\" and that he was able to circle the Harvard ends \\"at will.\\" Carlisle's 1907 season ended with an 18‚Äì4 victory over Amos Alonzo Stagg's Chicago Maroons football team. Hauser was described as \\"a one-man wrecking crew\\" against Chicago, as he kicked two field goals and an extra point and threw a 50-yard touchdown pass as well. On October 26, 1907, Carlisle beat a Penn team that had won every other game and was declared national champion. The \\"national champions\\" lost 26-6, before an overflow crowd of 20,000 at Franklin Field. Hauser's most historic moment in this game. At a time when forward passes were generally short tosses, Hauser threw a pass 40 yards, hitting his receiver in stride. In her history of Native Americans in football, Sally Jenkins called Hauser's long, 40-yard spiral pass against Penn one of the \\"three or four signal moments in the evolution of football\\" and \\"the sporting equivalent of the Wright brothers taking off at Kitty Hawk.\\" The Philadelphia North American compared it to the \\"puny\\" passes of the day, called it \\"a lordly throw, a hurl that went farther than many a kick,\\" and predicted that Hauser's throw would be \\"talked of often this year.\\" Hauser's secret was throwing the ball in a spiral, allowing it to travel farther downfield. Carlisle head coach, Pop Warner, said that Hauser was credited as the first football player to throw a spiral pass and could \\"hit his ends on the dead run with uncanny accuracy.\\" ==ScheduleSee also== * 1907 College Football All-America Team ==References== Carlisle Category:Carlisle Indians football seasons Carlisle Indians football ","title":"1907 Carlisle Indians football team"},{"id":"46307013","text":"MutualArt.com is an art information website that provides auction prices, personalized updates and data on over 300,000 artists.

The petition referred to the British parliamentary report, \\"The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire 1915-16\\", authored by Viscount Bryce and Arnold J. Toynbee, better known as the Blue Book. Ara Sarafian, a British Armenian historian, had republished an uncensored edition of the Blue Book five years earlier in 2000. Once he heard about this petition, he set out on a campaign to demonstrate the authenticity of the original work and to defend the integrity of his republication. This observational documentary follows Sarafian as he travels to the site of massacres described in the eyewitness accounts which were used in the Blue Book. He confronts official Turkish historians at an academic symposium in Istanbul University. While there he answers questions from Turkish journalists who were interested in his motivations. Later he takes part in a television debate discussing the validity of this almost hundred-year-old report. Throughout the debate, the official Turkish historian casts doubt on the authenticity of the Blue Book. However, during a break in the broadcast, while still being filmed for the documentary, he admits to Sarafian and the presenter of the program that the TGNA petition was a political exercise, it was academically weak and Sarafian's response was accurate. == Background == The filming of the documentary started in August 2005. In 2007 a version was released briefly for funding purposes. Following this there was some additional filming, and the film was completed in August 2009. In 2014, as part of the Armenian genocide centennial commemorations, a Blue Book app was developed, including additional footage. == Screenings == * 25 November 2014, SOAS & UCL Armenian Society Screening, SOAS WC1H 0XG * 25 September 2010, Egyptian Theatre * 28 May 2010, Oxford Armenian Society & Oxford Aegis Society, New College, University of Oxford * 5 March 2010, London School of Economics, Armenian Society, Hong Kong Theatre\\"The Blue Book\\" Documentary: Screening and Discussion * 27 January 2010, Royal Holloway, University of London * 27 November 2009, Queen Mary College University London, Hitchcock TheatreArmenian Weekly * 29 October 2009, National Film and Television School Alumni, Warner Brothers, WC1X 8WB * 25 September 2008, Pomegranate Film Festival Toronto * 29 May 2008, Los Angeles, Laemmle's One Coloradohttp://www.laemmle.com/films/6978 * 4 November 2007, Riverside Studios London == Contributors == * Ara Sarafian, Director of Gomidas Institute, archival historian * Lord Eric Avebury, founder of Parliamentary Human Rights Group * ≈û√ºkr√º Elekdaƒü, member of Turkish Grand National Assembly (2002-2011) from the Republican people‚Äôs Party * Professor Justin McCarthy, professor of history at the University of Louisville * Dr. Professor Kemal √ái√ßek, Turkish Historical Society * Temel Demirer, Turkish scholar, author, political activist * Fatih Altaylƒ±, Turkish journalist, columnist, television presenter and media executive * Ragip Zarakolu, Turkish publisher and Vice Chair of Turkish Human Rights Association ==See also== * Gomidas Institute == References == * Armenian Reporter * Memory Lane * Oxford Aegis Society * Seta's Armenian Blog * Changing Turkey * Memory lan, * TimeOut London * h&f; news * Azad Hye * Hamaink == External links == * * Gomidas Institute campaign * The Blue Book documentary website Category:2009 films Category:2009 documentary films Category:Documentary films about the Armenian Genocide Category:Armenian Genocide denial ","title":"The Blue Book, Political Truth or Historical Fact"},{"id":"46307237","text":"Juan Carlos Blanco may refer to: *Juan Carlos Blanco (volleyball) (born 1981), Venezuelan volleyball player *Juan Carlos Blanco Fern√°ndez (1847‚Äì1910), Uruguayan politician *Juan Carlos Blanco Acevedo (1879-1952), Uruguayan politician, son of Juan Carlos Blanco Fern√°ndez *Juan Carlos Blanco Estrad√© (born 1934), Uruguayan politician, grandson of Blanco Fern√°ndez and nephew of Blanco Acevedo *Juan Carlos Blanco Pe√±alva (born 1946), Uruguayan football coach and former player, see Club Nacional de Football ","title":"Juan Carlos Blanco"},{"id":"46307251","text":"National Volunteer month in the United States takes place in the month of April.

The Indians were coached by Pop Warner in his fifth year as head coach. The team compiled a record of 11-2-1 and outscored opponents 274 to 62. In 1903, an Indian team coached by Warner first employed its infamous \\"hidden-ball play\\" against heavily favored Harvard. Warner, as coach at Cornell, had already used it against Penn State in 1897, but it had not achieved much notice. Carlisle led Harvard at halftime, and hoping to keep the game's momentum, Warner elected to try the play on the ensuing kickoff. Harvard executed the kick, and the Indians formed a circle around the returner. With the aid of a specially altered jersey, the ball was placed up the back of the returner. The Indians broke the huddle and spread out in different directions. Each player feigned carrying the ball, except Dillon, the man with the ball up the back of his jersey. The ruse confused the Crimson players, and they scrambled to find the ball carrier. Dillon, with both his hands free, was ignored by the searching Harvard players, and he ran untouched into the end zone. With the score, Carlisle extended its lead to 11‚Äì0, but Harvard came back and eventually won 12‚Äì11. Nevertheless, the close match, and trick play, resulted in national attention.Gridiron Guts: The Story of Football's Carlisle Indians, NPR, May 19, 2007.Football, the Indian Way, Newsweek, April 27, 2007.

This inhibitor is under development as an anti-leukemic drug. == Core binding factors == Core-binding factor (CBF) is a heterodimeric transcription factor composed by the CBFŒ≤ and RUNX subunits (the latter is encoded by RUNX1, RUNX2, or RUNX3 genes). CBF plays critical roles in most hematopoietic lineages, regulating gene expression of a variety of genes associated with cell cycle, differentiation, signaling and adhesion.Nat Rev Cancer. 2005 May;5(5):376-87 In hematopoiesis, CBF regulates progenitor cell fate decisions and differentiation at multiple levels. The function of CBF is essential for the emergence of embryonic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and establishment of definitive hematopoiesis at midgestation.Cell. 1996 Jan 26;84(2):321-30.Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Apr 16;93(8):3444-9.Cell. 1996 Nov 15;87(4):697-708EMBO J. 2000 Jun 1;19(11):2465-74.Nature. 2009 Feb 12;457(7231):887-91 Similarly, in adult hematopoiesis, CBF regulates the frequency and differentiation of HSCs, lymphoid and myeloid progenitors,Nat Med. 2004 Mar;10(3):299-304Blood. 2005 Jul 15;106(2):494-504 establishing CBF as a master regulator of hematopoietic homeostasis. == Core binding factors and leukemia == CBF members are frequent targets of mutations and rearrangements in human leukemia. Point-mutations in RUNX1 gene have been reported in patients with familial platelet disorder, myeloid dysplastic syndrome, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.Blood. 2001 Nov 1;98(9):2856-8.Nat Genet. 1999 Oct;23(2):166-75.

The chromosome translocation t(12;21) (p13.1;q22) causes the fusion of the ETS variant 6 (ETV6) and RUNX1 genes results in ETV6-RUNX1 gene fusion and is the most common genetic aberration in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).N Engl J Med. 2004 Apr 8;350(15):1535-48. The ‚Äúcore binding factor AML‚Äù (CBF AML) [WHO classification] is the most common group of AML, including groups with the chromosome rearrangements inv(16)(p13q22) and t(8;21)(q22;q22). The chromosome translocation t(8;21)(q22;q22) creates the RUNX1-ETO fusion gene, which is expressed in FAB subtype M2 AML samples.Blood. 1992 Oct 1;80(7):1825-31.

Current treatment for inv(16) AML uses chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin and cytarabine, with an estimated 5-year overall survival of 60% in young patients and only 20% in the elderly Curr Opin Hematol. 2005 Jan;12(1):68-75Blood. 2006 Jul 1;108(1):63-73 == Discovery == CBFŒ≤-SMMHC outcompetes CBFŒ≤ for binding to RUNX1 by direct protein-protein interaction.Nat Struct Biol. 2002 Sep;9(9):674-9Mol Cell Biol. 1998 Dec;18(12):7432-43.Blood. 2004 Apr 15;103(8):3200-7. Using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based assay, AI-4-57 was discovered as the lead compound which can inhibit CBFŒ≤- SMHHC ‚ÄìRUNX1 protein-protein interaction.Science. 2015 Feb 13;347(6223):779-84 To get good in vivo pharmacokinetics, selectivity and potency AI-10-49 was developed which has a seven atom polyethylene glycol-based linker and a trifluoromethoxy substitution. This molecule releases RUNX1 from CBFŒ≤-SMHHC specifically and restores the RUNX1 transcriptional program in inv(16) positive human leukemic cells. Viability assays showed AI-10-49 has an IC50 of 0.6ŒºM. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that AI-10-49 has half-life of 380 minutes in mouse plasma. AI-10-49 prolonged the survival of mice transplanted with CBFŒ≤-SMHHC leukemic cells without any signs of toxicity. AI-10-49 reduced viability and colony forming ability of human primary inv(16) leukemic blast cells, without affecting normal human bone marrow cells as wells non- inv(16) primary human leukemic blast cells. Overall, these findings validate inhibition of RUNX1- CBFŒ≤-SMMHC protein-protein interaction as a novel therapeutic avenue for leukemia with inv(16) and AI-10-49 as a specific inhibitor of CBFŒ≤-SMHHC oncoprotein. The discovery of AI-10-49 provides additional evidence that transcription factor drivers of cancer can be directly targeted. AI-10-49 belongs to a select group of protein-protein interaction inhibitors that has been shown to have specific and potent efficiency without toxicity in cancer therapy. == Mechanism of action of AI-10-49 == The mechanism of action of AI-10-49 was recently elucidated by Pulikkan and colleagues at University of Massachusetts Medical School.Cell. 2018 June 28;174(1):172-186Blood 2017 130:784Cancer Discovery 2018 Aug 8(8): 913Stem Cell Investigation. 2018 Sep 30;5:30 Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of RNA-seq data from inv(16) AML cells treated with AI-10-49 identified the deregulation of a MYC signature, including cell cycle, ribosome biogenesis and metabolism. MYC shRNA knockdown induced apoptosis of inv(16) AML cells, and MYC overexpression partially rescued AI-10-49 induced apoptosis. Furthermore, mouse leukemia cells transduced with Myc shRNAs showed significant delay in leukemic latency upon transplantation, validating the requirement of MYC in inv(16) AML maintenance in vivo. Pharmacologic inhibition of MYC activity, using a combined treatment with AI-10-49 and the BET-family bromodomain inhibitor JQ1, revealed a strong synergy in inv(16) AML cells and a significant delay in leukemia latency in mice. ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq analysis revealed that inhibition of the CBFŒ≤-SMHHC‚ÄìRUNX1 protein‚Äìprotein interaction by AI-10-49 results in increased RUNX1 occupancy at three MYC distal enhancers downstream from MYC transcription start site. Deletion of the RUNX1 binding site in these enhancers by genome editing (CRISPR/Cas9) reduced MYC transcript levels and the viability of inv(16) AML cells, indicating that each one of these enhancers plays a critical role in regulating MYC levels and sustaining the survival of inv(16) AML cells. Analysis of enhancer-promoter interactions by chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C) in inv(16) AML cells revealed that the three enhancers are physically connected with each other and to the MYC promoter. Analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that AI-10-49 treatment results in the displacement of the SWI/SNF complex component BRG1 and RUNX1 mediated recruitment of polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) component RING1B at the three MYC enhancers. Taken together, these results demonstrate that AI-10-49 treatment induces an acute release of RUNX1, increases RUNX1 occupancy at MYC enhancers, and disrupts enhancer chromatin dynamics which in turn induces apoptosis by repressing MYC. Furthermore, this study suggests that combined treatment of inv(16) AML with AI-10-49 and BET- family inhibitors may represent a promising targeted therapy. == Protein- protein interaction inhibitors in cancer therapy == Targeting protein-protein interaction with small molecule is known to be extremely difficult due to the fact that binding regions consist of wide, shallow surfaces.Nature. 2007 Dec 13;450(7172):1001-9. There are few protein-protein interaction inhibitors with specific and non-toxic effect in various cancer types. The first and best characterized protein-protein interaction inhibitor in cancer therapy is Nutlin.Science. 2004 Feb 6;303(5659):844-8. Nutlin inhibits the interaction between HDM2 and tumour suppressor p53. After the discovery of Nutlin, more than 20 small molecule inhibiters have been developed by academic institutes and pharmaceutical companies of which 8 inhibitors are under Phase 1 clinical trials.Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2014 Mar;13(3):217-36 Other examples for protein- protein interaction inhibitors include JQ1 (inhibits the interaction between acetylated histones and BRD4);Nature. 2010 Dec 23;468(7327):1067-73. 79-6 (inhibits BCL6 BTB domain dimerization);Cancer Cell. 2010 Apr 13;17(4):400-11 MI-463 and MI-503 (inhibit Menin-MLL interaction)Cancer Cell. 2015 Mar 25 and ABT-737 (inhibits BCL2L1-BCL2 interaction).Nature. 2005 Jun 2;435(7042):677-81 == References == Category:Benzimidazoles Category:Pyridines Category:Experimental cancer drugs Category:Trifluoromethoxy compounds ","title":"AI-10-49"},{"id":"46307300","text":"≈û√ºkr√º Altƒ±n (born February 22, 1956; Ilgaz, √áankiri-), Turkish historian, novelist, educator and painter. ≈û√ºkr√º Altƒ±n, who published his first work Clock Story in 1990, is married and has three children. ==Childhood== He finished Primary School in G√ºney Village of Ilgaz; Secondary School in Ilgaz; High School in Ankara Yildirim Beyazit High School, College in Bartin. ==Education life== He served as a teacher and school director in Gumushane, Kastamonu, Hatay, Sivas and Cankiri.

He has painted over 100 murals, many of them in San Diego, California. He is considered one of the pioneers of San Diego's Chicano art movement. Ochoa was one of the original activists at Chicano Park and a co-founder of Centro Cultural de la Raza in Balboa Park, both in San Diego. He helped establish the influential Border Art Workshop/Taller de Arte Fronteriza (BAW/TAF). Ochoa is also a teacher of art and Chicano heritage. His work has been shown nationally and internationally, including at the Venice Bi-Annual, at the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego and in the groundbreaking exhibition, Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation (CARA). In addition to creating his own work, he is also a master of art preservation techniques, especially relating to murals. He is considered to be a \\"serious cultural resource in the border region. == Biography == Ochoa's family has a long history of activism and struggling against discrimination. Ochoa was born in South Central Los Angeles and later his family moved to East Los Angeles. When Ochoa was seven, his family was removed from Los Angeles by United States Immigration as part of \\"Operation Wetback.\\" Ochoa lived in Tijuana for about ten years and spent time working with his family in a carpentry factory when he was old enough to help. Later his family was able to return to Los Angeles. Ochoa felt that living in Mexico gave him a new perspective on \\"racism and discrimination, and the general attitude about Mexicans\\" in the United States. Ochoa always enjoyed school and felt he was a good student. At junior high, an incident happened that deeply affected Ochoa. He was trying to help another student who only spoke Spanish. The school had a policy against speaking Spanish and when a teacher heard Ochoa using that language, he was incensed and began to criticize the Spanish language and insulting Mexicans, according to Ochoa. Ochoa was shocked by the teacher's display of racism. He hit the teacher and was taken to the principal's office, though he wasn't punished as he expected. Instead, the incident led to Ochoa and the principal becoming friends later on in life. Ochoa graduated from high school in 1967 and moved to San Diego, California. In San Diego, he attended City College and received an associate degree in technical illustration. Afterwards, he attended San Diego State and graduated with a BA in 1974. Ochoa became involved with Chicano activism while he was in college. In April 1970, he saw fliers at the City College Student Center for a park take-over for what would later become Chicano Park. Ochoa recalls leaving class to go to the protest. He and other artists added their own stamp to the protest by starting murals on the park. Along with Guillermo Aranda, Mario Acevedo, Tomas Casteneda, Salvatore Borjas, Ochoa began painting the retaining walls and pylons near Logan Avenue, claiming the park for the neighborhood. As the park was recognized by the city, Ochoa continued to help improve the art and the organization of Chicano Park. He later became part of the steering Committee for Chicano Park. Ochoa has continued to be involved with the park and its restoration, including writing a manual for how to restore the murals. Ochoa was part of the founding group of the Centro Cultural de la Raza called Tolecas en Aztl√°n. to. As controversy surrounding the creation of the Centro in Balboa Park escalated, Ochoa became a key negotiator during the protests. Later, he served as a director for the Centro from 1970-1973 and again from 1988-1990. Ochoa has been teaching in many different capacities throughout the years. He states that he never wanted to be a full time teacher, but when his son was born, he was wanted to ensure that he had a steady income. Ochoa has taught at the MAAC Community Charter school for 13 years and retired in 2014. He taught at Grossmont College for about 23 years. Ochoa also taught at UCSD and San Diego Mesa College. Many of his teaching jobs had a community function, like when he worked with youth to create murals with a grant from the Jacobs Foundation in the Diamond Neighborhoods located in southeastern San Diego. Ochoa and other artists would bring free paint and work on the area surrounding Chollas Creek. The program was named Graff Creek. His teaching youth how to paint decreased the amount of graffiti the neighborhood received. He worked as an art consultant for the Jacobs Foundation for 11 years. He has since retired from formal teaching, but plans to continue to paint and work with children's art classes and workshops. He has a son, Victor and a daughter, Xochitl. == Art == Ochoa has always felt that public art, like murals, is a very important teaching tool for members of his community. He believes that since many Chicanos do not visit galleries or museums and instead learn about history and other ideas through public art. His murals depict pre-Columbian culture, Mexican heroes and subjects he chooses to \\"raise social consciousness\\" in his viewers. Ochoa feels that communicating Chicano history through murals and other types of art is one of the most powerful and trustworthy sources of information about the movement. == Book  Quotes == \\"Art is part of the solution of issues in society and Chicano art has been the expression of our people's struggle.\\" == References  External links == * Victor Ochoa Talks about the Murals at Chicano Park (video) * Victor Ochoa and Veronica Enrique (video) * Textiles of our Motherlands Category:American muralists Category:American artists of Mexican descent Category:Chicano Category:Mexican-American culture in San Diego Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:People from East Los Angeles, California ","title":"Victor Ochoa"},{"id":"46307398","text":"Vanessa Filipa Santos Rodrigues (born 4 September 1993), known as Filipa Rodrigues or Pipa, is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a defender for Portugal women's national team. ==Honours== Atl√©tico Ouriense * Campeonato Nacional: 2013‚Äì14 Benfica * Campeonato Nacional II Divis√£o: 2018‚Äì19 * Ta√ßa de Portugal: 2018‚Äì19 ==ReferencesNational team data Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:People from Mangualde Category:Portuguese women's footballers Category:Portugal women's international footballers Category:Women's association football defenders Category:Atl√©tico Ouriense players Category:S.L.

Doke, the Lamba kingdom' (chiefdom) is estimated to have been established in the 16th century, between 1585 ‚Äì 1889. The founder of the tribe is believed to have been a female known as Chembo Kasako Chimbala. She was the youngest wife of the Great King Mwati Yamvwa of the Luba-Lunda kingdom; she did not accept being part of a polygamous marriage, so she fled with her son Chembo and settled in what is today known as: Lambaland (Ilamba) on the Copperbelt at Nkashiba Kabena Mofya (Lake of the Mofya clan), commonly known as St Anthony because the Catholics built a church there. The Kingdom grew and spread into the Southern part of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in the Katanga Province, a province equally rich in copper. Therefore, whether you are in Zambia or in DRC, the copperbelt of both countries is squarely Lambaland (Ilamba). Lamba is ‚Äòthe act of humbling oneself‚Äô. The Lambas are generally very humble people in nature. ‚ÄòThe people are divided into a number of exogamous clans and the clan descent is matrilineal. The Lambas may be described as hunting agriculturists. Physically, they are of medium built and remarkably robust and strong. Linguistically the Lambas belong to the Central Bantu Group of which ubulamba is a typical example. Their language is remarkably rich in folk- and proverb-lore and they take great delight in talking. Practically every Lamba is a born orator, unafraid to voice his views, no matter what size the assembly may be‚Äô (Doke 1931: 28-29). Ruling clans There is one main ruling clan namely: Abena Mishishi (hair clan) The following are Abena Mishishi chiefs of Ilamba (Lambaland): *Chief Mushili (Zambia) ‚Äì Designated Senior Chief officially by the Colonial government by mistake and the mistake was adopted by the Zambian government, but to the Lambas at all levels of discussion, Senior Chief Mushili is their Paramount chief and is accorded respect by all the Lamba people and chiefs accordingly. *Chief Lesa (Zambia) *Chief Selenje (Zambia) *Chief Kalilele (Zambia) *Chief Mkambo (Zambia) *Chief Mukutuma (Zambia) *Chief Shibuchinga (Zambia) *Chief Nkana (Zambia) *Chief Shimukunami (Zambia) *chieftainess Chikola (Zambia) *Chief Musaka (Zambia) *Chief Chiwala (Zambia) *Chief Saili (DRC) (Lumbembe village) *Chief Katala (DRC) (Mokambo village) *Chief Mfundamina (DRC) (Mfundamina and Nshinshimuka villages) *Chief Kombo (DRC) (between Mokambo and Lubumbashi rural areas) *Chief Katanga (DRC) (Katanga Province is named after the Lamba Chief) (Lubumbashi rural areas). *Chief Nsakanya (DRC) (Sakania rural area) Abena kashishi (rope clan) *Chief Kaponda (DRC) (Kipushi and Kolwezi rural areas) *Chief Nshindaika (DRC) (Likasi rural area) Abena Nyendwa (Leg Clan) *Chief Ndubeni (Zambia) *Chief Lumpuma (Zambia) *Chief Malembeka (Zambia) *Chief Kalunkumya (Zambia) *Chief Fungulwe (Zambia) Abena Nsoka (Serpent clan) *Chief Machiya (Zambia) Abena Bwali (Nshima clan) *Chief Chilukusha (Zambia) In total there are 25 Lamba chiefs: 4 female chiefs and 13 male chiefs in Zambia and 8 chiefs in the DRC. In the past, the chief had the power of life and death and in certain circumstances he/she would order someone to be jailed, executed or be sold into slavery and that was without doubt. That authority was inherited and over time, that has been enshrined in all of the people that have grown up in that culture. Despite many years of urbanization, the Lambas still maintain their culture and traditions. However to understand their practices; one must analyze them through the lenses of the Lambas themselves. As early as 1931, Doke had the following confession to make about the Lambas: :‚Ä¶understand better the people and their point of view‚Ä¶this is a record of the thoughts and lives of the people as far I can observe them, unaffected by Christianizing and the influence of Western civilization‚Ä¶.I can only say that I wish I had more knowledge of the significance of the native customs when I first went to work among the Lambas. I should have been saved from many grievous mistakes and many misjudgments. The ability to see through the Bantu eyes will give the missionary and the officials‚Äô better understanding and more sympathy with the people, and a greater ability to gain their confidence (Doke 1931: 9). ==See also== *Lamba language ==Sources== *Doke, Clement M.

He is commonly known by his pseudonym, Chief Henry Red Eagle. Perley became the youngest licensed guide in the state of Maine at the age of 14. He attended Greenville High School, and during that time earned money by making snowshoes and working in lumber yards. He was not only the first full-blooded Indian to graduate from Greenville High School, but was also class president and graduated valedictorian of his class of 1902.\\"Chief Henry Red Eagle Outstanding Maine Citizen\\" Editorial. Lewiston Evening Journal [Lewiston, ME] January 17, 1977: 8A. Accessed April 8, 2015. Perley's family roots can be traced back to the Maliseet Reservation in Tobique, New Brunswick, Canada. His parents, Gabriel and Philomen Tomah Perley, were known as Canadian Malecites, who migrated due to lack of game in the 1870s. Henry was the oldest of four siblings.Calvert, Mary R. (1986) The Kennebec Wilderness Awakens. Twin City Printery. He met his wife Wanna Eagle, a professional diver and swimmer, while working at Coney Island's Dreamland. Wanna returned to Greenville, Maine with Perley, where she established the Eagle Haven recovery swim camp on Sugar Island for polio victims.Parker, Everett L. (2004) The Moosehead Lake Region: 1900‚Äì1950. Arcadia Publishing. Perley died at the age of 87 in Greenville, Maine on November 15, 1972 and is buried in the Greenville Cemetery. ==Performance career== Upon graduation, he worked at the L.A. Harris Drugstore for several years before joining traveling shows throughout the United States and Great Britain in the 1910s.\\"The Center for Moosehead History Celebrates the Earliest Residents\\". The Moosehead Historical Society & Museums. Accessed April 3, 2015. Perley made his first appearance in traveling shows with the Kickapoo Indian Medicine Show, where he performed in full tribal regalia. He then followed an Indian troupe to Great Britain where he performed in 1911 and 1912. After returning to the United States, he joined Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show and the Barnum and Bailey Circus. Perley often played the role of Indians stereotyped as savages during the early 1900s. During his time working with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show and Barnum and Bailey's Circus, Perley attracted much attention from Hollywood talent scouts looking to bring \\"authenticity\\" to their productions. He appeared in numerous silent films with actors and actresses such as Mary Pickford, the Gish Sisters, Rudolph Valentino, and Richard Dix. The recognition Perley gained from appearing in the silent films landed him parts in six different Broadway plays, including Cole Porter's 1916 musical comedy See America First. He also appeared in Lynn Riggs and Cole Porter's Lo, The Poor Indian. Before retiring from performing, he appeared as part of an Indian show at the Chicago World's Fair. ==Writing career== Perley began his writing career under the pseudonym \\"Henry Red Eagle\\" in 1910, when he began writing short stories for pulp magazines such as Argosy, Top-Notch Stories, and All- Story Weekly. In the 1930s Perley moved back to the Moosehead Lake Region, where he worked as a wilderness guide and worked seasonally as a counselor at Camp Morgan, in Washington NH. He became well-established as a renowned storyteller who advocated for environmental conservation. He eventually retired from his position at the camp in 1966. During this time he wrote for more local publications such as In the Maine Woods and the Moosehead Gazette. Perley's stories encompassed themes of lumbering and adventures of wilderness guides. Focusing on the New England, he often highlighted the Native American presence in these areas to counteract the myth that they had disappeared from the northeast of the United States. In 1997, twenty five years after Perley's death, his niece and granddaughter published a volume of some of his works entitled Aboriginally Yours.Parini, Jay.

The youth here is very talented. But people lack a proper platform. The city used to have two studios but they don't exist now. Thus the basic requirements for shooting a film cannot be met and hence we have to travel to Pune or Mumbai for the editing and post-production process. I wish some effort is taken by the city administration to put up a studio in Kolhapur which will then give a boost to the local talent,\\" he says. Devendra says that his passion for acting and films helps him experiment with projects. \\"Acting is my passion and hobby. Till my graduation, I was never into it. I was always drawn to acting but never dared to take it up nor did I get a proper platform to showcase my talent,\\" he says. His first film Sambha- Aajcha Chava didn't do that well at the BO last year. \\"But at least we tried doing something different,\\" he says, adding, \\"Even in Welcome To Jungle, we have endeavoured to give something new to the audiences.

Vegas was one of three outposts called the Nevada Cities north of the Main Line of Resistance (MLR), the United Nations defensive line which stretched roughly around the latitude 38th Parallel. Vegas, and the outposts it supported, Reno and Carson, were manned by elements of the 1st Marine Division. On 26 March 1953 the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) launched an attack on the Nevada Cities, including Vegas, in an attempt to better the position of China and North Korea in the Panmunjon peace talks which were occurring at the time, and to gain more territory for North Korea when its borders would be solidified. The battle raged for five days until PVA forces halted their advance after capturing one outpost north of the MLR on 30 March, but were repelled from Vegas. The battle for Outpost Vegas and the surrounding outposts are considered the bloodiest fighting to date in western Korea during the Korean War. It is estimated that there were over 1,000 American casualties and twice that number of Chinese during the Battle for Outpost Vegas. The battle is also known for the involvement of Sergeant Reckless, a horse in a USMC recoilless rifle platoon who transported ammunition and the wounded during the U.S. defense of outpost Vegas. Map of the Nevada Complex ==Prelude== In March 1952, the 1st Marine Division redeployed from east-central to western Korea, to join US I Corps where they were assigned a sector to defend on the Main Line of Resistance (MLR). The specific sector on the MLR was called the Jamestown Line. This sector was located between PVA forces to the north and the South Korean capital of Seoul to the south. The 1st Division was supported by the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, who had also been recently deployed to western Korea. 1st Battalion, 5th Marines defended the Nevada Cities, reportedly coined as such by Lieutenant Colonel Tony Caputa because \\"it's a gamble if we can hold them.\\" Lieutenant Colonel Jonas M. Platt commanded 1st Battalion, while Colonel Lew Walt commanded the 5th Marine Regiment. The 1st Division's formations from left to right comprised the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) Kimpo Provisional Regiment, 1st Amphibian Tractor Battalion, 1st Marines and the 5th Marines. The 1st Marines had replaced the 7th Marines earlier in March. The 1st Marine Division was supported by separate units of artillery, tanks, and aircraft. The 11th Marines commanded by Colonel Mills provided artillery support. Three of four companies of the 1st Tank Battalion supported with M46 Pattons, flame tanks, and retrievers. The 1st Marine Air Wing, with 6,400 personal located throughout Korea, supported with helicopter evacuations of night frontline combat casualties, artillery spotting flights, airborne control of airstrikes and routine liaison and reconnaissance, administrative, and resupply flights. Opposing the Marines was the PVA line of formations, from left to right: the 19th Division of the 65th Army, who had three regiments forward; and the 120th Division of the 40th Army (under the control of the 46th Army), who had three regiments forward. According to the 1st Marine Division Diaries, the Chinese were active in patrolling and ambushing in defense of positions during the first part of March. During the last part of March the PVA began \\"limited objective attacks\\" against US outposts. These attacks varied from a squad to two battalions in strength against outposts Reno and Vegas, in order to deny the US observation into the PVA rear areas. I Corps commander General Bruce C. Clarke advocated defense on the hills north of the MLR to deny the tactical advantage they offered to the PVA. Vegas was the highest of the \\"Nevada Cities\\" and north from the MLR. \\"From North to South this observation included in its 180-degree sweep, enemy hill mass 57 to the right, friendly outpost Berlin, the MLR, key Marine defense highpoints, Hills 229 and 181 in the 1st Marines sector, and intervening terrain.\\" However, soldiers on Vegas could not see Reno. A rifle platoon of 40 Marines and two Navy corpsmen manned each outpost. of trench line surrounded the outpost, which ranged from deep. Beyond the trenches two parallel lines of barbed wire lay, linked with more parallel aprons of wire connecting the two, sometimes referred to as the \\"Canadian system. Outpost Reno, formerly Outpost Bruce, had been the scene of intense fighting from 5‚Äì6 September 1952 during the Battle of Bunker Hill and 3 Marines were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions there, 2 posthumously. The three outposts of Carson, Reno and Vegas differed from one another according to their location, the terrain to be defended, and the threat they faced. Outpost Carson, on the left, guarded a largely barren hilltop where a cave provided living quarters for the Marines, who manned an oval perimeter protected by barbed wire and including bunkers, tunnels and a main trench with fighting holes. Except for the slope nearest the Jamestown Line, where a deeper entrenchment was being dug, the main trench on Carson averaged deep by wide. Most of the 28 fighting holes had excellent fields of fire, though the overhead cover on some of them had reduced the opening for observation and firing. During darkness, two listening posts covered the likeliest avenues of PVA attack, from the Ungok hills to the west and Hill 67 to the north. Reno, in the center, was the most vulnerable of the three. It not only lay closest to PVA lines, but also occupied a ridge that forced the defenders into a perimeter vaguely resembling the wishbone of a turkey, open end to the north. As at Carson, a cave served as living quarters and might also become a last-ditch redoubt. A tunnel provided access to the cave from the main trench, which varied from deep. The Marines at Reno built no bunkers, relying exclusively on fighting holes in the trenches and, as a last resort, the cave itself. Outpost Reno had limited fields of fire in the direction of PVA-held Hill 67, also called Arrowhead Hill, but Outpost Carson, on the left, provided fire support in this area. As a result, the approach that seemed to pose the greatest danger to Reno‚Äôs defenders followed a ridge extending generally southward from Hill 150. Like the Marines defending the other outposts, those at Reno relied on C-rations and tossed the empty cans into nearby gullies. At night, when the tin cans clattered, the source of the noise might be PVA moving close to attack behind a sudden barrage. To the south of Reno lay Reno Block, an L-shaped trench with a small bunker at the end of the shorter leg and a machine gun position at the point where the legs joined. At night a reinforced squad manned the blocking position, which served as a listening post, helped screen the movement of supplies and reinforcements, and provided a rallying point for relief columns ambushed by PVA patrols. Perched on a hilltop, Reno Block afforded excellent visibility, but conversely it could easily be seen from PVA lines. Marines manning Reno‚Äôs east-west trench could fire in support of the blocking position, as could the garrison at Carson. To the right of Reno loomed Outpost Vegas, which as the tallest of the three, afforded the best fields of observation. Barbed wire and a well-constructed trench encircled the egg-shaped perimeter on Vegas, with its one warming and two living bunkers. Although the fields of fire on Vegas were less than ideal, handicapped in places by a steeply-pitched slope too irregular for grazing fire and also by the small firing apertures in some of the covered fighting holes, weapons there could support Reno with long-range fire. By day, Vegas proved a magnet for sniper fire and harassment by mortars and artillery, forcing the Marines to remain under cover. UN intelligence did not expect a PVA attack during late March. Winter had turned to spring, and with the change of temperature, the melting snow turned the roads to mud, making logistics near to impossible. The newly deployed 1st Marines expected a comparatively quiet front in western Korea to the fighting they experienced elsewhere.Furthermore, the lines of resistance had for most of the war remained static. There are different reasons for the PVA attack to come on March 26. According to Elliot Akermann, the Chinese wanted to capture the Nevada Cities north of the MLR in order to gain leverage at the Panmunjom peace talks. If the PVA gained a victory here, they could threaten Seoul, thus embarrassing and putting pressure on the UN negotiators at the talks. For Lieutenant Colonel Pat Meid and Major James M. Yingling, the PVA wanted to take the hills and ridgelines adjacent to the Marine MLR. This would then better their position at the peace talks, and solidify captured territory for North Korea after peace was achieved. ==Battle== March 26: Chinese attack Until the end of March, the PVA had shown no sign of attacking the Nevada Cities outposts and were reluctant to engage the Marines' patrols unless they engaged in their own positions. Meid and Yingling wrote that the Marines were as follows: \\"Operation orders read that the Marines were to make contact, capture prisoners, and deny the ground to the enemy.\\" The PVA offensive began on the night of March 26 against outposts Vegas, Carson, and Reno, in conjunction with attacking nearby outposts Dagmar, Esther, Bunker and Hedy. At 19:00, small arms and machine gun fire erupted from the PVA positions on the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines positions. This was followed by 15 minutes of mortar and artillery fire on the 5th Marines rear areas and supply routes along the MLR. At 19:10, over 3,500 PVA soldiers from the 358th Regiment, 120th Division attacked ouposts Carson, Reno, and Vegas. One of the PVA companies engaged the Marines atop outpost Vegas. Marine artillery responded to the PVA attacks by firing \\"protective boxes\\" and VT proximity fuses around the outposts and routes of attack. When VT was fired at PVA soldiers who were very close to the Marine positions - as was often the case - the Marines would run into previously dug caves on the opposite slope of the hills. There they would wait until the overwhelming numbers of PVA soldiers were pushed off the hill by the VT shells, and then the Marines would reemerge from the caves to man the defenses. Overwhelming PVA numbers and supporting fire forced the Marines on Vegas to abandon the outer ring of less easily defended trenches. At the same time during the evening of the 26th, Marine tanks and artillery had been positioned on the MLR to support an infantry raid to destroy PVA bunkers scheduled for the next morning on the 27th, designated \\"Operation Clambake.\\" It was pure chance that they were positioned there just as the PVA launched an attack in the same front. By 19:40, communications wire between Vegas and 1st Battalion Command Post had been lost because of PVA artillery and mortar fire striking in the rear areas of the Marine positions. Occasionally Marine engineers would repair the wires until the next barrage destroyed them again. By 19:50, more than 100 PVA soldiers occupied the lower trenches of outpost Vegas, where they could survive Marine artillery bombardments. 10 minutes later, the Marines at outpost Vegas withdrew in face of overwhelming numbers of PVA. A little over an hour later at 21:29 a Marine platoon was sent to Vegas to support the Marines who had just withdrawn. Yet even before they were able to get to the outpost's hill, they were pinned down from engulfing fire from nearby PVA. Three minutes before midnight, 1st Battalion lost communications permanently with the Marines near outpost Vegas. All of the Marines on Vegas were killed or captured. After 5 hours of fierce combat, the PVA attack had been partially successful. They had captured 2 outposts (Vegas and Reno) and Marine reinforcements to those outposts had been thwarted. Carson was still controlled by the Marines. Shortly after midnight, F Company 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines made an effort to recapture Vegas, but the lead platoon only managed to get close enough to confirm that Vegas was in PVA hands. By 03:00 on 27 March, these units had retreated back to the MLR. Wounded Marines were either carried to the aid stations of the 1st or 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, or in severe cases, evacuated by helicopter to Navy ships in Inchon harbor. After eight hours of fighting in and around the Nevada Cities, the PVA had endured an estimated 600 casualties, 4 times more than that of the Marines. March 27: USMC reorganization and counterattack After the Marines abandoned their initial attempts to fight their way to Vegas, Major General Edwin A. Pollock commander of the 1st Marine Division sent observation planes to direct fire for ground artillery and Air Force and Marine planes. Their fire was directed at PVA artillery behind their front lines and at fortifications atop of captured outposts Reno and Vegas. On March 27 over 60 fire missions were called. Marine mortars, artillery, and self- propelled guns contributed to the bombardment. Over 2 dozen Air Force and Marine aircraft also flew missions against PVA positions on the captured outposts, including Grumman F9F Panther jets. Instead of attacking both Reno and Vegas outposts, Pollock ordered attacks to be concentrated just on Vegas. This decision was made at 09:00 as the bombardment climaxed against PVA positions on both outposts. Company D, 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines was the first to assault Vegas, but they never reached their objective, and retreated with only 9 able-bodied soldiers remaining. At the same time, D company was pinned down while en route to Vegas. By 13:05, D company had reached the lower slopes of outpost Vegas. By 13:22, the Marines had \\"gone over the top\\" on the outpost's hill. E Company soon followed and passed through D Company's ranks to secure the trenches and crest of Vegas. At 18:00, F Company was still behind the other companies from outpost Vegas. After 10 hours of intense fighting on the 27th of March, the Marines had held the lower slopes of Outpost Vegas, PVA soldiers held the opposite slope of outpost Vegas but no- one held the summit. March 28: Fight for Vegas summit and final USMC capture On the morning of 28 March for 23 minutes the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing dropped some 28 tons of bombs on outpost Vegas. Their bombs landed from the lower trenches occupied by the Marines. Up until that time, Marine commanders had hoped they could recapture the outposts with defenses intact in order to be used at another time. But after the unsuccessful Marine attacks the night before, they concluded that the outposts could not be retaken without the necessary fire support and so destroying the facilities of outpost Vegas.At 13:13 E Company gained control of outpost Vegas after heavy fighting and by 14:55 the outpost was secured. At 23:00 more than 200 wounded Marines were kept at a makeshift hospital on the slope of Vegas. Soon after the hospital staff learned that a PVA formation estimated at battalion strength was moving in their vicinity. Armed with as many grenades as they could carry, wounded Marines threw the grenades down the slope in an attempt to blunt the PVA maneuver. March 29‚Äì30: Conclusion of battle For two days from the end of March 29 to the end of March 30, PVA formations continued to attack and counterattack in an effort to take back Vegas. According to Akermann, the PVA \\"went through 4,000 men\\" in two regiments. The attacks eventually halted on March 30 because the PVA simply could not afford to lose any more soldiers. By 11 am on March 30, as Marine artillery attacked PVA positions, the attacks finally stopped. The battle for Outpost Vegas was over. ==Aftermath== In early May, the 1st Marine Division was replaced by the Turkish Brigade, and the Marines went into reserve after almost a week of heavy fighting in and around the \\"Nevada Cities\\" outposts. According to the 1st Marine Division diaries, American casualties in the month of March were at 141 killed in action, 29 died of wounds, 701 wounded and evacuated, 510 wounded and not evacuated, and 104 missing in action. PVA forces suffered 1,351 killed in action, 3,631 wounded, and 4 captured. The Korean Marines had a minor presence during the battle for outpost Vegas, their casualties 26 killed in action, 97 wounded in action, and 5 missing in action. According to Akermann, the 1st Marine Division had 1,488 killed, wounded, or missing in the month of March. In the \\"Nevada Cities\\" sector, the 1st Marine Division had 1,015 casualties (killed, missing, wounded), which was nearly 70% of their total strength. 156 Marines were killed, 441 wounded and evacuated, 360 wounded but not evacuated, and 98 missing including 19 captured. These casualties were from Marines in action; non-combatant casualties are not included. The PVA would renew their attack on the Nevada Complex on 25 May and after 4 days of heavy fighting the UN Command ordered that it be abandoned. ==Sergeant Reckless== A young Marine purchased a horse for $250 in October 1952 which was trained as an ammunition carrier for a Recoilless Rifle platoon in the 5th Marines. Sergeant Reckless, as she was later called after the nature of the recoilless rifle and the platoon's radio call sign, went with the 5th Marines as they were put in support of a string of outposts on the MLR. It was there where she had her first taste of battle. Reckless had been moving about the Nevada Cities when the PVA attacked on March 26, 1953. When artillery began to hit Outposts Vegas and the support network behind it on the MLR, Reckless ran to the nearest bunker, where she remained clearly shocked by the impact of war. The next morning on the 26th, as the 5th Marines recovered from the previous day's fighting, Reckless was readied for her duties as ammunition carrier. Before dawn Reckless was fitted with 8 recoilless rifle projectiles, 192 pounds of weight distributed across her back. Reckless was then led by the other Marines in her platoon to the platoon's firing positions opposite of the southern slopes of outpost Vegas. She continued to haul ammunition, and at one point wounded Marines, up and down the hill. ==References== Category:Conflicts in 1953 Category:Battles of the Korean War involving China Category:Battles of the Korean War involving the United States Category:1953 in Korea Category:March 1953 events Category:United States Marine Corps in the 20th century ","title":"Battle for Outpost Vegas"},{"id":"46307518","text":"Bobby Smith (born February 1982) is a British political and fathers' rights activist. He is the founder and leader of the Give Me Back Elmo party which he set up to seek to change the law in family courts after his own experiences. ==Political activity== Smith stood in the Witney constituency for the Give Me Back Elmo party in the 2015 general election. He and the party received media coverage across the world as Smith and two other members of the party waited with placards to greet the UK Prime Minister David Cameron at the polling station where he cast his vote on election day (7 May 2015) and Smith appeared while dressed as Elmo at the vote count in numerous photos with the Prime Minister and behind him on the stage. Smith stood in the Chells ward at the 2016 Stevenage Borough Council election, receiving 23 votes. Smith stood in the 2016 Tooting by-election and received nine votes. He received just three votes in the general election in June 2017, standing in the Maidenhead constituency where Prime Minister Theresa May was re-elected. Smith was an independent candidate in the 2019 Peterborough by-election, receiving five votes. He stood against Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Uxbridge and South Ruislip in the 2019 General Election as an Independent. ==Activism== In August 2014, Smith camped outside the holiday home of Prime Minister David Cameron, in Daymer Bay, Cornwall. Smith was briefly arrested after using a megaphone in an attempt to speak to Cameron the previous day. In September 2014, Smith and fellow activist Carol Wheeler protested outside the home of Broxbourne MP Charles Walker. Smith said \\"My children are growing up without a father, I want a review of my case, or for someone to bring it up for debate ‚Äì to give fathers equal rights, ending secrecy in Family Courts and judgements on balance of probability.\\" Walker spoke of the protest in Parliament as a point of order, saying, \\"I recognise the right to protest, but the use of a loud- hailer made it almost impossible to hold a conversation with those visiting my surgeries.\\" A Real Birmingham Family by Gillian Wearing In November 2014, Smith, accompanied by Wheeler, covered the A Real Birmingham Family statue with a white sheet and pictures of his own two daughters in protest at no father being included in the statue. Smith said \\"They've depicted the normal family with no fathers. There's nothing wrong with single mothers, but this statue is saying one person can do both jobs, and I believe kids are always better off with both parents in their lives.\\" The director of the Ikon Gallery Jonathan Watkins said of Smith's protest after meeting with him, \\"We had a good exchange of ideas, he has his take on things, and I have my take on things. I think it's great that somebody has the freedom to express themselves. It's all good, it's part of this democratic society that we cherish.\\" In December 2014, Smith, along with other protesters from New Fathers 4 Justice, carried out a protest at the Witney constituency home of Prime Minister David Cameron, that resulted in Smith and the other protesters being issued with an harassment order. In a video taken by the protesters, Cameron told the group, \\"I really think you've made your point and you can go now. You are frightening my children and the neighbours and that's not fair.\\" Smith said, \\"We have been protesting within the law, we haven‚Äôt been using a loud hailer and were within our rights to be there\\" and \\"I‚Äôm not going to give up\\". In February and March 2015, Smith carried out a number of protests alone and with others aimed at Harriet Harman and the Labour pink bus campaign. Starting in Stevenage at the launch of the campaign, Smith first confronted Harman in Asda and then again later in the day whilst wearing a T-shirt that had \\"This is what a victim of feminism looks like\\" written on it. Smith said, \\"You're dividing up men and women ... you're making it them versus us. Are you thinking of getting blue van?\\" Smith also confronted Harman in Croydon, Cambridge and Gloucester where Smith said, \\"Fathers in this country falsely accused of domestic violence are lower down the scale when it comes to rights than a convicted paedophile. I haven't seen my children for four years. I have tried everything else so I have to protest like this.\\" When asked whether she would take the time to listen to Smith's story, Harman said: \\"I have talked to fathers' groups over the years and I know what they are protesting about. He [Smith] is protesting about his own family situation and that is not something that should be decided by politics. That is something for the family court.\\" In March 2015, after asking Ed Miliband a question at a Q & A session in Rotherhithe, Smith along with other New Fathers 4 Justice protesters were involved in an altercation outside. It was originally alleged that Miliband was \\"punched and shoved\\". New Fathers 4 Justice later released a video showing Miliband getting in the car unimpeded and smiling throughout. Smith told BuzzFeed News: \\"We were there because he didn‚Äôt answer my question on shared parenting. I think as long as you don‚Äôt block his path and he‚Äôs not scared, it‚Äôs OK to raise your voice and be heard.\\" On Father's Day 2015, Smith and another protester climbed Westminster Abbey and unfurled banners to highlight fathers' rights. In October 2015, Smith climbed onto the roof of the home of Chris Grayling, the leader of the House of Commons. On 30 November 2015, Smith climbed onto the roof of the Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace along with fellow campaigner Martin Mathews and remained on the roof for several hours before giving themselves up. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Fathers' rights activists Category:1982 births Category:People from Enfield Town Category:British political candidates Category:21st-century British politicians ","title":"Bobby Smith (activist)"},{"id":"46307540","text":"The United States Air Force Locomotive No. 1246 is a historic diesel-electric railroad switch locomotive on display at the Fort Smith Trolley Museum in Fort Smith, Arkansas.

He did not play college football as he was born in Nigeria and grew up in the United Kingdom, where he became the first international player to go straight from a European American football league to the NFL. ==Early years== At the age of 10, Obada and his sister were trafficked from the Netherlands (where they moved from Nigeria at the age of 8) into England and left homeless as soon as they arrived in London. They initially slept rough, then in an office block, then with a family friend, before living in 10 different foster homes. He eventually worked as a security guard at Grace Foods in Welwyn Garden City. In 2014, Obada began playing for the London Warriors of the British American Football Association National Leagues. He appeared in 5 games, while playing tight end and defensive end. ==Professional career== Dallas Cowboys Based on a recommendation from Warriors defensive coordinator Aden Durde, who previously served as an intern coach with the Dallas Cowboys in 2014, Obada was given the opportunity to work out for the team days before their game against the Jacksonville Jaguars in London. Although he was raw and didn't have much experience, he was signed as an undrafted free agent on 1 April 2015. In rookie mini-camp he was tried on the first days at tight end, before the team decided to move him to defensive end, where the learning curve would not be as steep. He was waived on 5 September. On 23 September, he was signed to the Cowboys' practice squad. On 7 October he was released to make room for linebacker Keith Smith. On 2 December he was re-signed to the practice squad. He was waived on 2 March 2016. Kansas City Chiefs Obada was signed by the Kansas City Chiefs on 9 March 2016. He was released by the team on 7 June. Atlanta Falcons On 28 July 2016, he was signed by the Atlanta Falcons. He was waived on 27 August. Carolina Panthers On 25 May 2017, Obada was signed by the Carolina Panthers, through the new NFL's International Player Pathway program, that guaranteed him a position on the team, after it granted an 11th practice squad slot to all four NFC South clubs (the division was selected in a random draw), so they could sign an international player. As part of the program conditions, he was ineligible to be promoted to the 53-man roster during the regular season. He was waived by the Panthers on 1 September 2017, and was re-signed to the practice squad. He signed a reserve/future contract with the Panthers on 8 January 2018. After a strong preseason, Obada became the first player from the NFL International Player Pathway program to make a 53-man roster. In Week 3, against the Cincinnati Bengals, Obada played his first regular season game, where he had one sack and one interception. He was later awarded the game ball, and was named the NFC Defensive Player of the Week. He finished the season with eight combined tackles and two sacks. On 23 January 2019, Obada signed a one-year contract extension with the Panthers. On 13 October 2019, Obada was made an honorary captain for the Panther's NFL London Game vs. the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as part of a very emotional day for him. On 6 January 2020, Obada signed a one-year contract extension with the Panthers. He was waived on 6 September 2020, but re-signed with the team the next day. In Week 3 of the 2020 season against the Los Angeles Chargers, Obada recovered a fumble lost by wide receiver Keenan Allen on the last play of the game to secure a 21‚Äì16 win for the Panthers. ==Career statistics== {  - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Team ! colspan=\\"2\\" Games ! colspan=\\"4\\" Tackles ! colspan=\\"6\\" Interceptions ! colspan=\\"4\\" Fumbles - !

He was educated in local schools. At the beginning of the American Civil War, Bethune enlisted in the Confederate States Army. He served for the majority of the war and was wounded at the battles of Chickamauga and Malvern Hill. The wound suffered at Chickamauga resulted in an extended hospital stay and its lingered for the rest of his life. Near the end of the war, Bethune had risen to the rank of first lieutenant in command of an artillery company. He surrendered to Union forces at Macon, Georgia. Following the war, Bethune settled in Warrenton, Virginia where he practiced law and operated a farm. He married Mary Agnes Clark in 1869. The union produced six children: Frank, James N., Isabelle, Joseph D., Fannie, and Mary Agnes. In 1876, Bethune moved to Los Angeles, California where he continued to work as an attorney. He was appointed register for the Los Angeles land office in September 1885. Bethune resigned from the position in August 1887. Health concerns prompted a move to Tucson, Arizona Territory in March 1893. On March 22, 1894, Marshall H. Williams received Senate confirmation to become Associate Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court. This triggered a political battle within Arizona's Democratic party. Williams eventually decided to not accept the position and Chief Justice Albert C. Baker recommend the next candidate be selected from outside the territory and thus not aligned with any of the battling factions. President Grover Cleveland nominated Bethune to fill the empty position on May 2, 1894. He was confirmed by the Senate on May 9 and took his oath of office in Tombstone on June 1, 1894. Upon taking office he was assigned to the first judicial district, consisting of Cochise and Pima counties. While serving on the supreme court, Bethune wrote eight opinions siding with the majority and one dissenting opinion. His writing tended to be brief, precise, fact based, and focused upon his understanding of the law as it existed instead of how he felt the law should be. In Evans v. Blankenship, 4 Arizona 307 (1895), David Neahr, an early settler in the Phoenix area, had set aside a section of land in 1880 to use as a \\"public square\\". In 1883, Neahr offered the same land for the site of a new capital building. Bethune found the land had already been given to the city of Phoenix despite the city's lack of a formal acceptance. Blevins v. Territory of Arizona, 4 Arizona 326 (1895) dealt with a case where the defendant was accused of illegally branding a calf but the indictment against him failed to state a motive for the conversion. In Blackburn v. the United States, 5 Arizona 162 (1897), the Federal government was attempting to cancel the patent on a mining claim while Salcido v. Genung, 5 Arizona 23 (1896) was an ejectment case. In Sullivan v. Garland, 5 Arizona 188 (1897), Mrs. Nellie Sullivan had filed suit for malicious prosecution after being arrested for a felony. Bethune's ruling found the trial court had incorrectly granted demurrer and ordered the case back to the trial court for retrial. When the McKinley administration took office, it decided to replace the judges on the Arizona bench. Bethune's time as a judge ended on July 8, 1897 when the Senate confirmed George Russell Davis to succeed him. After leaving office, he practiced law in Prescott for a time but had returned to Los Angeles by 1900. A heart attack around 1910 prompted his retirement. Bethune died at his home on October 8, 1912. He was buried at the Hollywood Memorial Park Cemetery. ==References== * * * ==External links== * Category:People from Columbus, Georgia Category:People of Georgia (U.S. state) in the American Civil War Category:Arizona Territory judges Category:California lawyers Category:Virginia lawyers Category:Confederate States Army officers Category:1842 births Category:1912 deaths Category:People from Warrenton, Virginia ","title":"Joseph D.

She co-starred on HGTV's show Flip or Flop alongside her ex-husband Tarek El Moussa and currently has her own HGTV show Christina on the Coast. == Background == Anstead was born Christina Meursinge Haack in Orange County, California. She has a sister, Carly, who is ten years younger. She went to school in southern California and began working in the real estate industry after college, where she met her future husband and business partner, Tarek El Moussa. ==Career== Real estate Anstead ran the real-estate agency Tarek and Christina: The El Moussa Group with her first husband Tarek in Orange County, California. In 2010, the El Moussas, along with their business partner Pete De Best, bought their first investment property in Santa Ana, California for $115,000, selling the property for a profit of $34,000. The trio continued to flip houses, expanding their real- estate investing business into Arizona and Nevada. The El Moussa Group was dissolved in 2018. The business is now owned by Tarek and Associates, a sole venture of Tarek El Moussa.What Tarek El Moussa's New Solo Venture Means for Flip or Flop https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/tarek-el-moussa-new-business- flip-or-flop/ Television The husband-and-wife team sold real estate in the southern California area. When the housing market plummeted after the October 2008 stock market crash, their real estate business suffered. Christina and Tarek went from living in a $6,000-per-month house to a $700-per-month apartment in just a few years. One day in 2011, on a spontaneous whim, Tarek asked a friend to help him make an audition tape for HGTV. The friend filmed an entire episode of the process of house flipping from start to finish. The audition tape of the flip was sent to a production company without anyone believing that it would be of much interest to them, but the production company, Pie Town Productions, loved it. HGTV producers had also noticed the couple's Instagram profile, which featured before and after profiles of many of the renovation projects they had undertaken. In 2012, HGTV signed the couple to a regular weekly program that featured the ins and outs of flipping a house, as well as a look at their family life. In a 2014 interview, Anstead said, \\"Each episode shows things that can go wrong, and do go wrong\\". In April 2013, Flip Or Flop finally hit the small screen on the network. In June 2018, it was announced that Anstead would be receiving her own spinoff show, Christina on the Coast. The first episode of season 1 focused on Anstead renovating her new post-divorce home, with the remaining seven episodes focusing on her renovating other people's homes. Filming began in fall 2018, for a spring 2019 premiere. The show's second season premiered on January 2, 2020 on HGTV. In 2017, Anstead presented at the Daytime Emmys. == Other businesses == In March 2020, Anstead released a book, The Wellness Remodel, with certified nutritionist Cara Clark. On July 14, 2020, Anstead announced she will be partnering with Spectra Furniture to create a furniture line for the brand. The new line, Christina Home Designs, will debut in October 2020. == Personal life==  Marriage to Tarek El Moussa  Christina and Tarek were married in 2009. Their daughter Taylor was born in 2010 and their son Brayden was born in 2015. In 2013, Tarek was diagnosed with both thyroid and testicular cancer. When doctors recommended radiation treatment, the couple decided to bank Tarek's sperm and try in-vitro fertilization to have a second child. The first attempt failed and Christina suffered a miscarriage on the second try. She became pregnant with their son in 2015. After having her second baby, Christina was back to work on Flip or Flop within four weeks. She began to feel overwhelmed and the tension between the couple escalated. ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt able to properly communicate anymore,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt got to the point where we weren‚Äôt even driving to set together.‚Äù In May 2016, the couple separated after an incident at their Southern California home. Tarek was found by the police, and maintained that he was never suicidal and had simply gone for a hike, taking a gun to protect himself from wild animals. Following the incident, Christina stated that \\"being separated was healthier for both of us\\". Tarek and Christina filed for divorce in 2017 and the divorce was finalized in January 2018. They continue to co-parent their children. Marriage to Ant Anstead In November 2017 she began dating English television presenter Ant Anstead. On December 22, 2018, she married Anstead at their Newport Beach, California home and officially changed her name to Christina Anstead, dropping the last name of her first ex-husband.

He created the Danny Grossman Dance Company which produced his political dances. ==Early life and dance career== Grossman was born in San Francisco, California to a Polish-Hungarian Jewish father and an Irish Catholic mother. When he was ten he walked his first picket line and remained politically active his whole life. He began folk dancing in grade school but by 1960 he was learning and performing modern dance with Gloria Unti. In 1963 Paul Taylor saw Grossman at a summer course at Connecticut College and invited him to join his dance company. Grossman remained with the company for ten years. ==Move to Toronto== In 1973 Grossman was invited to Toronto Dance Theatre as a guest artist and remained in Canada ever since. He joined the faculty of York University and choreographed a duet called Higher. This piece caused Grossman to create the Danny Grossman Dance Company. ==Notable works== In 1976 Grossman created his first political satire National Spirit, which was about American patriotism. In 1977 he created his first solo Curious Schools of Theatrical Dancing which was about a dancing clown in a circus ring. Also in 1977 he collaborated and danced with Judy Jarvis in Bella, a piece inspired by Giacomo Puccini's music and Marc Chagall's paintings of lovers. In 1981 Grossman premiered Endangered Species at the New York Space and City Centre. The piece was set in a post-apocalyptic world where the dancers fought against military oppression. In the 1990s, funding for the arts diminished in Canada and Grossman sought other ways to sustain his company. Grossman wanted to preserve Canadian dance as an art form by remounting works by famous Canadian choreographers like Patricia Beatty, Judy Jarvis, Robert Desrosiers and Peter Randazzo. These revivals were not financially successful and Grossman transitioned the company into an institute for licensing and teaching Grossman's repertoire. Grossman stopped creating new works for the company in 2008. He was profiled in Moze Mossanen's 1987 documentary film Dance for Modern Times, alongside David Earle, James Kudelka, Ginette Laurin and Christopher House.William Littler, \\"Dance feature puts viewers on stage\\".

They were being looked after by their grandparents, who had gone inside the house at the time. The gate flew open and their dog ran out. Sandy ran out trying to catch him. His sister Donna says that all she can remember was Sandy motioning for her to go too but she refused and went into the house to tell their grandparents. Work ground to a halt on the new building estate nearby to search for Sandy but nobody has seen him since. The most believed scenario is that there was a man delivering leaflets around the time of Sandy's disappearance and that he could have opened the gate and taken Sandy. Sandy's mother Margaret and father Phillip believe that it was a lonely man wanting a son. Another theory is that he ran down to the river five minutes away and followed the dog in, and subsequently drowned. ==Subsequent events== The case was featured in an episode of the television series Missing Children: Lorraine Kelly Investigates in 2009 but nobody phoned in with information. A DNA test was carried out in November 2013 on someone who was born around the same time as Sandy and who lived 20 miles away, but he turned out not to be the missing toddler. In September 2014, the Broomlands Primary School, which was constructed around the time of Sandy's disappearance, was demolished. The police and council refused to excavate the land to search for Sandy.

Lugo's work draws together hip-hop, history and politics into formal ceramics and 2D works. Born in Kensington, Philadelphia to Puerto Rican parents, Lugo began his career as a graffiti artist before discovering ceramics. Lugo holds a BFA from the Kansas City Art Institute and an MFA from Penn State, and is a professor of ceramics at Tyler School of Art. Lugo is an Assistant Professor of Art at Tyler School of Art and is the recipient of the 2019 Rome Prize. His unique works have garnered nationwide attention and numerous shows. == Early life == Lugo was born in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia in 1981, the third child to young first generation Puerto Rican immigrants. His mother, Maribel Lugo, was 21 years old and his father Gilberto, a Pentecostal preacher, had a middle school education, as he had been working sugar cane fields in Puerto Rico since he was a child. Raised during a time in Philadelphia that saw prevalent drug use and gang activity, with many of the neighborhood houses abandoned due to the crack epidemic, things were not easy for the Lugo family. Seeking better work opportunities, his father often biked to work in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, an act Lugo associates with his current work: \\"When I sit at a potter's wheel, I often think of my father's bike tire spinning, and this metaphor has always had me reach for more.\\" His mother worked two to three part-time jobs to help support the family while also caring for the three children. While his parents worked hard yet remained struggling, marginalized on the outskirts of American culture, Lugo was a quiet child, devoutly religious, with a thick Spanish accent and had trouble reading. Teachers failed to recognize his creative talents and even singled him out as a troublemaker in a school trip to a local prison. As a teen, he liked grunge rock and hockey, in addition to the salsa, rap, and baseball favored by neighborhood kids, who pointed to him as \\"weird\\" or \\"trying to be white.\\" He didn‚Äôt have access to art in school, and partly to better fit in, he took up writing graffiti with cousins on the streets of Philadelphia. He signed his work with the tag \\"Robske\\", which he continues to use on all his work and credits with his artistic career; \\"I couldn‚Äôt make the pottery I make today if I hadn‚Äôt started doing graffiti as a teen.\\" Lugo worked various factory jobs in Philadelphia, until at age 22 he moved to South Florida to live with family and decide what to do with his life. He saw college as a way to earn a decent living, which is when he enrolled in a ceramics class at a community college Told that \\"real, honest\\" art came from personal experience, he made pieces like a fire hydrant that evoked happy memories of showering in the street with his father on nights when the family's water had been turned off. \\"It was the first time in my life I was ever told I was good at anything,\\" he says of those early efforts, adding that artmaking immediately became his calling: \\"Right off the bat, it felt important.\\" == Education == In 2007 he briefly attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago before being accepted to the ceramics arts program at the Kansas City Art Institute, where he would graduate with a BFA in 2012. He began devouring ceramics history as well as anthropology, intrigued by how pots tell stories about past cultures. In historical ceramics, he found connections to his own work, such as how the lines of a leaf or flower on a Chinese pot looked like graffiti arrows, and had the same quick, gestural quality as tagging. By drawing graffiti on his surfaces with china paint, he could put his own stamp on ceramics history and discourse. He also realized that minorities and people of color were underrepresented in the field, and that, through his work, \\"I had the opportunity to speak on behalf of people where I come from.\\" That sense of mission intensified when he entered graduate school at Penn State University School of Visual Arts in 2012, around the same time that his brother was, Lugo says, unjustly convicted of a drug-related charge and sent to prison. Feeling sorrow and anger, and even guilt for his own situation, he created Oppression, a work he considers one of his best. The heads of two men of color ‚Äì Lugo and his brother ‚Äì sit in subjugation on a Victorian teacart, essentially serving as saucers for dripping cups. (His brother was eventually granted early release, has rebuilt his life, and is \\"doing really well,\\" Lugo says.) In 2013 he explored the theme of incarceration more directly, when photographer Richard Ross invited him to collaborate on Juvenile In Justice, a show in Philadelphia about imprisoned youth. Ross, whose work is photographing incarcerated youth, had come to Penn State to critique students in the photography department. Lugo put pots in his backpack and waited outside the critique room for Ross. The invitation to collaborate followed. Coming on the heels of an artist residency he did in Hungary through the Kansas City Art Institute, the show marked a turning point in Lugo's career. \\"I felt that I was empowered to do anything, and that my voice was an important and needed component to the ceramics community.\\" == NCECA 2015 == thumbThis Machine Kills Hate from 2015 NCECA conference Emerging Artists Presentation In late 2014, having recently graduated with his MFA from Penn State, Lugo received word he had been selected as an Emerging Artist for the National Council on Education in Ceramic Arts 2015 conference, to be held in Providence Rhode Island. Lugo's deeply personal lecture, part spoken word performance, part sermon, electrified the crowd of nearly 5,000 attendees. His speech about how pottery saved his life, including the image of the phrase \\"This machine kills hate\\" painted onto his pottery wheel earned him an enthusiastic standing ovation. \\"I want to take Roberto Lugo out of the equation for a moment, the individual. I am proud to be a part of a community of people that honors the things I just talked about, that finds those things valuable‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre a culture that can change the world.\\" The video of that lecture has nearly 20,000 views online, and Lugo has received more than 100 emails from people who saw the speech in person or online, thanking him and sharing similar experiences. Roberto Lugo at the Philadelphia Clay Studio == 2015 ‚Äì present == After NCECA, Lugo was contacted by a gallery in his hometown, only four miles from the ghettos of Kensington. Wexler Gallery in Old City now represents Lugo, and recently exhibited their first solo show with together in June 2016, titled Defacing Adversity: The Life and Times of Roberto Lugo. Like all of Lugo's work, Defacing Adversity tackles issue of social justice, politics, race and poverty through the vehicle of highly decorated historically themed ceramic forms. By combining graffiti, hip hop, history, pop culture and porcelain, Lugo is bringing new conversations to the table of contemporary art, supported by Wexler, a gallery that challenges the labels of traditional art. Outside of creating work for solo shows, Lugo has been very busy since his NCECA lecture. He has completed several short term residencies, one at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia and another at Baltimore Clayworks, giving lectures around the country to emerging ceramic artists and schools, and serving as a visiting artist in various locations. In 2015 he began teaching at Marlboro College in southern Vermont, where his is on tenure track. \\"I wanted to be in a place where I can see progress can be made, in a place that doesn‚Äôt have diversity‚Äî but really does have the desire to become more racially diverse,\\" he explained. He has been featured at multiple exhibitions, including SOFA Chicago and a solo show at Eutectic Gallery in Portland, Oregon. Lugo also remains active in social justice in other forums. He maintains a series of video diaries on social media, speaking out on issues of race relations in the US, diversity in the field, and inspiring future generations of artists to dare to be the voices of change. He has also contributed to social change organizations such as The Democratic Cup. Lugo is currently an Assistant Professor of Art at Tyler School of Art. == Film == Film ‚ÄúWithout Wax‚Äù is set to release in the Fall of 2019 Directed by Cyrus Duff and Produced by Edward Columbia. About this film IMDB shares ‚ÄúPast and present intertwine in this boundary-pushing cinematic documentary about world-renowned ceramics artist Roberto Lugo.‚Äù == Art == Lugo's work has been compared to Kehinde Wilde's portraits of young people of color in heroic poses, often based on famous historical paintings, and Lin Manuel Miranda's Hamiltons use of hip hop wigs and waistcoats treatment of the American Revolution. His forms often reflect historical ceramic patterns, in particular he is drawn to the Royal Worcester porcelain. Juxtaposed with traditionally precious porcelain, the imagery of poverty, social and racial injustice are illuminated. Lugo's vessels are multicultural mash-ups, traditional European and Asian porcelain forms reimagined with a 21st-century street sensibility. Their handpainted surfaces feature classic decorative patterns and motifs, the kind found on bandanas, combined with elements of modern urban graffiti, plus striking portraits of individuals you might not expect to find on a type of ornate luxury item historically made for the rich ‚Äì people like Sojourner Truth, Cornel West, and Erykah Badu, as well as Lugo's family members and, very often, the artist himself. Faces framed by colorful patterns are prominent, often in direct contrast, such as a confederate flag surrounding the faces of victims of racial discrimination. Lugo's work does not pull any punches, and delivers hard messages with delicate brushstrokes. == Exhibitions == * == Family == Roberto Lugo married his wife, Ashley, in 2009. Ashley Lugo is a fellow artist who hails from rural Alabama. They have two children, Theodore and Otto, both of whom feature prominently in Lugo's social media feed and writings.

Arsenic, the alleged murder weapon, was found in Kinney's stomach during an autopsy. Though Kinney was acquitted, public records indicate that Kinney's second husband, Reverend Enoch W. Freeman, and Freeman's father, died of arsenic poisoning years earlier. Public consensus following Kinney's trial deemed her guilty, and she published an autobiography in 1841 to defend herself. ==Early life and marriage to Ward Witham== Hannah Hanson was born in 1805 in Lisbon, Maine. At seventeen, she met Ward Witham, and they were married in January 1822, in Portland, Maine. After the first few months of their marriage, Hanson was accused by two neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Weymouth, of stealing their personal items. Witham defended his wife at the time, but later suspected her in the theft when he came to believe that she had been involved in an extra-marital affair. In October 1822, Hanson and Witham moved out of the home they had shared with the Weymouth family. In July 1823, Kinney gave birth to her first child, a daughter. Witham came to suspect Kinney had been involved in an affair during the winter of 1824. In 1825, Hanson gave birth to her second child, a son. In the winter of 1825, Witham worked outside the home gathering lumber. He suspected his wife was involved in a second affair, this time with a young man. Rozilla Moody, a ward of the Witham family, signed an affidavit in 1826 saying she had witnessed another man in the Witham household during the previous winter. In 1826, Witham moved Hanson and their two children from Portland to Dover, Maine. Witham moved to Boston on his own, and stayed there for two years. Hanson heard that Witham had begun a new life in Boston as a single man. In 1830, Witham and Hanson exchanged letters confirming that Kinney had no desire to live with her husband again. Later that year, Hanson moved to Boston without her children. In March 1832, Hanson and Witham legally divorced on the grounds of adultery, and full custody of their children was awarded to Hanson. Records at the time of their divorce indicate they had four children in total. ==Marriage to Enoch W. Freeman== Hanson began supporting herself as a seamstress in Boston. She visited her children in Dover several times a year. In July 1832, Hanson visited her cousin, Reverend Enoch W. Freeman, minister of the First Baptist Church in Lowell, MA. It was the first time Hanson had seen Freeman in fifteen years. In 1835, against the wishes of Freeman's congregation, Hanson and Freeman were married. On the first anniversary of their wedding, Freeman grew ill and died. He was thirty-seven years old. Following Freeman's death, Hanson was forced to leave town by the suspicious citizens of Lowell. ==Marriage to George Kinney== Hanson returned to Boston and married her third husband, George Kinney on November 26, 1836. Kinney was a known gambler and drunkard, and was five years Hanson's junior. His business collapsed soon after the wedding, and Hanson began supporting her husband and then three children through her work as a seamstress. In 1840, Kinney was treated for syphilis, which he had contracted through a sexual affair with a mistress. On August 9, 1840, Kinney drank a cup of herbal tea and died painfully afterward. ==Trial== On August 30, 1840, Hanson was visiting friends in Thetford, Vermont when she was arrested for the murder of George Kinney and transported back to Boston. Hanson was held in prison for four months awaiting trial. According to Hanson's autobiography, she lived in cell number 5 in the common jail. The cause of death on Kinney's autopsy read arsenic poisoning. During the investigation, Rev. Freeman's body was exhumed, and it was revealed on record that his stomach, too, had contained arsenic before his death. Hanson's trial began on December 21, 1840. Hanson's defense attorneys, Franklin Dexter and George T. Curtis, argued that no proof had been found of Hanson purchasing and administering poison to Kinney. The prosecution called a servant who worked in the Kinney household as a witness, and she reported seeing a piece of paper in the kitchen with \\"poison\\" written on it, but testimony was not concluded to be ample enough evidence to convict Hanson. During the trial, it was confirmed that Kinney had been treated for syphilis immediately before his death, and arsenic was a well-known medication prescribed to treat venereal disease at the time. During the trial, eighteen witnesses were interrogated by the prosecution, including Dr. Martin Gay, a Boston physician who confirmed the presence of arsenic in the late Kinney's stomach, Thomas G. Bradford, a local shopkeeper who sold arsenic but couldn't identify Hanson as a customer, and Mrs. Aurelia Bingham, Hanson's seamstress apprentice. The defense interrogated twenty two additional witnesses, including Earnest H. Cheetham and Thomas Ridley, Boston citizens who described the rumors about Hanson's guilt, Albert G. Leach, Hanson's brother-in-law and Mr. Coolidge, the local jailor who had once imprisoned the late Mr. Kinney for unpaid debts. On December 25, 1840, Hannah Hanson Kinney was acquitted of the murder charge and released from prison. The jury took a total of three minutes to deliberate on a verdict. She sold off her millinery shop to cover her late husband's gambling debts, which totaled $2,000. Once the debt was settled, Hanson was left with $89 in total. Hanson's brother-in- law, Albert Leach, who had visited her while in prison, mortgaged his horse and carriage to get Hanson and her three children back on their feet financially. Public opinion The public in Boston and Lowell continued to attribute Kinney and Freeman's deaths to Hanson despite the court declaring her not guilty, and rumors had even begun to attribute the death of Freeman's father to Hanson as well. Hanson's father-in-law, Mr. Freeman had died suddenly while Hanson and Freeman had been visiting him following their wedding. In 1841, Kinney published her autobiography, A Review of the Principal Events of the Last Ten Years in the Life of Mrs. Hannah Kinney: Together with Some Comments upon the Late Trial, Written by Herself to combat rumors of her guilt. In response, her ex-husband Ward Witham, published a biography of Hannah, entitled Life of Mrs. H. Kinney, for Twenty Years in 1842. He accused her of adultery and slander, but publicize an opinion on the murder trial. In 1868, The Republican, a Springfield, Massachusetts newspaper, mentioned Hannah Hanson as \\"Hannah Kinney, supposed to have poisoned the Rev Mr Freeman, her second husband, as well as Kinney, her third.\\" The Spectator compared Hanson to other women who had infamously used poison or violence to murder men, including Madame LeFarge and Mrs. Cutts of England. In 1989, a publication on New England genealogical records argued that Hanson had attempted to convince the doctors conducting Kinney's autopsy to cite cholera as the cause of death. ==References== Category:19th-century American criminals Category:American female murderers Category:American murderers Category:American female criminals Category:1805 births Category:American criminals Category:Deaths by poisoning Category:People acquitted of murder Category:Year of death missing Category:Mariticides ","title":"Hannah Hanson Kinney"},{"id":"46308131","text":"Capwell is a surname.

At some point, she met Daniel Alves, a trauma surgeon stationed at Lenox Hill Hospital; the two fell in love, and got married in New York City. Two hours after the wedding, the reception was crashed by minions of the Owl, who were being pursued by members of a burgeoning criminal syndicate called the Exchange. To ensure the elimination of their targets, the Exchange operatives opened fire on the reception, killing everyone except Rachel, who was hospitalized in critical condition. In the months she spent recovering, Rachel befriended Daily Bugle reporter Norah Winters, through whom she learned of the Exchange. Wanting revenge, Rachel infiltrated a gathering of Exchange higher- ups in North Creek, and massacred it; she was then confronted by the Punisher, who was also working on dismantling the Exchange. After a brief standoff, Rachel and the Punisher parted ways, the Punisher telling Rachel, \\"Stay out of my way\\". After she saves him from a group of Black Spectre agents, the Punisher allies with Rachel, giving her body armor with his skull insignia on it. Together, the two attempt to acquire the Omega Drive, a device containing data on Black Spectre, as well other terrorist groups such as A.I.M., Hydra, Agence Byzantine, and the Secret Empire. This leads to a temporary alliance with Daredevil (the current owner of the Omega Drive) and Spider-Man. Rachel betrays the others, taking the Omega Drive for herself, but she is convinced to give it back by Daredevil. The Punisher then goes in search of Rachel, and finds her through Norah, who had been visited by Rachel. Rachel and the Punisher fight over her recklessness and the wedding picture that Rachel had asked Norah to get for her, the brawl ending with the Punisher giving a Rachel a \\"pep talk\\" that prompts her to burn the photograph of herself and Daniel. Rachel proceeds to help the Punisher infiltrate a supervillain auction so that they can steal the adamantium casing of one of Doctor Octopus's tentacles. Rachel then gains access to the Exchange's headquarters by claiming to want to sell the tentacle, and meets the organization's leader, a woman named Stephanie Gerard. After the Punisher shatters the nigh-indestructible windows of Stephanie's office with an adamantium-tipped bullet, Rachel sets off a gas grenade hidden within the hollowed-out tentacle, and garrotes Stephanie while the Punisher uses one of Spider-Man's web-shooters to enter the room, and kill Stephanie's entourage. Stephanie's besmirched second-in-command, mad with grief over his employer's death, calls 911 on the Punisher, then embarks on a murderous rampage, which claims the lives of twelve bystanders, and two police officers. The NYPD breach the Exchange's building, and in the chaos that ensues, the Punisher kills Stephanie's second-in-command, while Rachel accidentally shoots a detective in the throat. Rachel and the Punisher escape, but the former, overcome with guilt over the detective's death, contacts Norah, and confesses to her involvement with the Punisher, while also trying to make it clear that Stephanie's second-in-command was responsible for the massacre that is being blamed on her and the Punisher. Rachel subsequently attempts suicide by cop, but this fails due to the Punisher tampering with her gun and incapacitating all but one of the officers sent after her. Rachel breaks down, wailing, \\"You bastard, Castle... why did you let me live?\\"  War Zone  Rachel is arrested, tried, and sentenced to death for the murders of the detective and the two officers, in what her attorney, Matt Murdock, regards as an instance of railroading intended to harm the Punisher. While imprisoned, Rachel (who had not protested what was she had been charged with) is visited by a disguised Black Widow, who is searching for the Punisher on behalf of the Avengers. Rachel claims to not know where the Punisher is, asserting, \\"This is on me, these are my crimes. You will not find him. You will not use me to find him. You leave the Punisher out of this... he's gone. He's not coming back.\\" The Punisher, despite being hunted by the Avengers, frees Rachel (which she initially protests) with the help of Wolverine. Knowing his capture by the Avengers is inevitable, the Punisher gives Rachel everything she needs to relocate, and reassures her by saying, \\"The mission isn't the man, sergeant. It never was\\". Rachel is next shown gunning down a pair of muggers in Hollywood.  Return  After the Punisher escapes from a Costa Rican prison, he calls Rachel (who he refers to as \\"the one person I can still trust\\") to give him a lift back to the United States. When the Punisher expresses doubts about continuing his mission, Rachel inspires him to keep going, and the two drive back to Los Angeles. Once in the city, the Punisher has Rachel drop him off at the home of his current weapons supplier, a military armory officer named Tuggs. When Black Widow puts out a call for backup to help her and the Punisher combat Baron Zemo and Mayor Wilson Fisk, the only heroes who bother to respond are Rachel, Night Thrasher, and Moon Knight. Rachel is captured by Zemo and Jigsaw during a battle with the Thunderbolts, but is rescued by the Punisher, who is forced to non-fatally shoot through Rachel to get to Zemo. == In other media == * Rachel is an \\"enhanced costume\\" for the Punisher in the 2013 online game Marvel Heroes, voiced by Kimberly Brooks. == References  *Rachel Alves at Comicvine *Rachel Cole at Marvel Wikia * Category:Punisher characters Category:Fictional vigilantes Category:Fictional sole survivors Category:Fictional military sergeants Category:Marvel Comics martial artists Category:Fictional United States Marine Corps personnel Category:Characters created by Greg Rucka Category:Fictional Silver Star recipients Category:Comics characters introduced in 2011 Category:Fictional women soldiers and warriors Category:Fictional characters from New York City Category:Fictional War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) veterans ","title":"Rachel Cole-Alves"},{"id":"46308170","text":"Gartrell may refer to: *Amy Gartrell (born 1974), American artist *Charles H.

Though there were several configurations of her name which appear in records, she signed her name as Elisa Acu√±a Rosseti. At age 13, she began teaching basic reading, writing, arithmetic, national history, pedagogy and drawing, in the rural schools of the area. She witnessed much poverty and discrimination, which had a profound effect on her development. Pre-revolutionary radicalism In 1900, she graduated with teaching credentials and the following year she joined the Liberal Club \\"Ponciano Arriaga\\" created by Camilo Arriaga. The club members were ardent supporters of the brothers Ricardo and Enrique Flores Mag√≥n, anarchist journalists and founders of the Mexican Liberal Party. The brothers were impressed with Acu√±a and invited her to serve on the board of directors of the Ponciano Arriaga Club. In 1901 she participated in the First Congress of Liberal Clubs, held to attack the government of Porfirio D√≠az, and helped Juana Bel√©n Guti√©rrez de Mendoza establish the newspaper V√©sper. Articles appearing in the paper attacked the Catholic Church, defended miners and workers, and criticized the Mexican public, as well as D√≠az, for their complacency in accepting dictatorship. In 1903, Acu√±a, B√©len, and Maria del Refugio V√©lez formed the leadership of the Mexican Liberal Club (CLM) and on 23 February signed a \\"Manifesto to the Nation from the Liberal Club Ponciano Arriaga\\" written by Camilo Arriaga advocating for more liberal clubs and anti- reelectionist clubs to be established. Acu√±a, Arriaga, Bel√©n, the Flores Magon brothers, and Juan Sarabia were arrested in 1903 and locked up in Bel√©n prison and V√©sper and other newspapers were confiscated. In prison, she met Dolores Jim√©nez y Muro and In√©s Malv√°ez with whom, along with Bel√©n, she wrote a newspaper called Fiat Lux from the prison. Their imprisonment created protest from their supporters and after three years, they were released and deported. Acu√±a, Bel√©n and Arriaga fled to San Antonio, Texas to re-establish V√©sper with the support of Francisco I. Madero. In cooperation with Sara Estela Ram√≠rez, Acu√±a, Bel√©n and Jim√©nez y Muro published feminist articles and promoted the ideology of the Mexican Liberal Party. In 1907 Acu√±a, Bel√©n and Jim√©nez y Muro founded the \\"Daughters of Anahuac\\", a group of about three hundred libertarian women, who demanded improved working conditions for women and advocated labor strikes. That same year, she joined the leadership of the Mexican Liberal Party (PLM). In 1908, she founded, with Bel√©n, Jose Edilberto Pinelo and Jim√©nez y Muro, a worker's organization in Mexico City called \\"Mexican Socialism.\\" They continued to publish the newspaper Fiat Lux, as the voice of an organization called the Mutual Society for Women. These activities and a failed attempt at rebellion by supporters of Arriaga resulted in the arrest of Acu√±a, Bel√©n, Jim√©nez y Muro, and Mar√≠a Dolores Malv√°es and their imprisonment at San Juan de Ul√∫a fortress in the Gulf of Mexico. Revolutionary radicalism In April 1910 Acu√±a participated in the organization of the Great Independent National Convention, held in Mexico City to announce the candidacy of Madero as president of Mexico, which brought about the beginning of the Mexican Revolution. That same year she joined in support of the Club Femenil Antirreeleccionista Hijas de Cuauht√©moc (Anti- Reelectionist Women's Club: Daughters of Cuauht√©moc), founded by Jim√©nez y Muro and others. She also founded the newspaper La Guillotina, part of the radical press. Between 1911 and 1912 she distanced herself from the Flores Mag√≥n brothers and supported Arriaga when their ideological split fractured the former alliance. In March 1911 she supported Arriaga's \\"Complot de Tacubaya\\" (Tacubaya Conspiracy) to overthrow Porfirio Diaz. After Francisco Le√≥n de la Barra assumed the interim presidency, Acu√±a, Bel√©n and Jim√©nez Wall, among others, organized the \\"Friends of the People,\\" and began calling for women's suffrage. They organized a demonstration in June, 1911 in the neighborhood of Santa Julia, but troops suppressed the protest killing nine participants. She was a staunch supporter of Madero, but when he was killed by the coup of Victoriano Huerta she used La Guillotina to expose Huerta's treachery. Along with other members of the radical press, she fled Mexico for a brief time, but returned to join Emiliano Zapata's propaganda team in Puebla. She was soon appointed head of propaganda and began acting as liaison between the followers of Zapata and those of Venustiano Carranza. In 1914, she and Juana Bel√©n Guti√©rrez de Mendoza created La Reforma, the first Mexican newspaper promoting the causes of indigenous peoples. Post-revolutionary career After the Revolution she worked with the Women's Council and the Pan-American League of Women. From 1920 onward, she was assigned to the Press Department of the National Library, which became the National Newspaper Library of Mexico in 1932. In 1927, Acu√±a directed the Sixth Cultural Mission (\\"Crusade Against Illiteracy\\") of the Secretary of Public Education (SEP). The program installed seven social missions to serve the indigenous communities in the states of Aguascalientes, San Luis Potos√≠ and Zacatecas. Elisa Acu√±a died on 12 November 1946 in Mexico City. On 16 November 2010, to mark the Centennial of the Mexican Revolution, her remains were moved from \\"Civil Pate√≥n of Dolores\\" in Mexico City, where she had been buried to the \\"Rotonda de los Hidalguenses Ilustres\\" at Pachuca in the state of Hidalgo, Mexico. == References == Category:1872 births Category:1946 deaths Category:People of the Mexican Revolution Category:Mexican rebels Category:Mexican revolutionaries Category:Mexican feminists Category:Mexican feminist writers Category:Mexican educators Category:Mexican anarchists Category:People from Hidalgo (state) ","title":"Elisa Acu√±a"},{"id":"46308215","text":"Minshall may refer to: *Diane Anderson-Minshall (born 1968), American journalist and author best known for writing about lesbian, gay bisexual and transgender subjects *Jacob Anderson-Minshall (born 1967), American author *Charles Minshall Jessop (1861‚Äì1939), mathematician at the University of Durham working in algebraic geometry *Barbara J.

Born in the Netherlands to a Huguenot family, Marron first came to Paris as the chaplain of the Dutch embassy. Protestants in France had been prohibited from worshipping openly since the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. The Edict of Tolerance in 1787 gave non-Catholics the right to openly practice their religion. Marron was recruited to lead the newly tolerated Protestant community of Paris, a task he accomplished through the French Revolution, several imprisonments, the Napoleonic Wars, the Bourbon Restoration and into the July Monarchy. ==Biography== A bust of Pastor Paul- Henri Marron in the sacristy of l'Oratoire du Louvre Marron's tomb Early life Marron was born in Leyden in 1754 to a Huguenot family who had fled to the Netherlands as refugees from Saint-Paul-Trois-Ch√¢teaux in the Dr√¥me department of France. He studied theology at Leyden and was ordained at the age of 20. He was called as the pastor of the Walloon church of Dordrecht in 1776. Paris In 1782 he moved to Paris to serve as the chaplain of the Dutch ambassador. A Protestant worship service in the French language had been allowed at the Dutch embassy since the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 providing one of the only means for French Protestants to participate in a worship service. After the Edict of Tolerance in 1787 Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-√âtienne recruited Marron to serve as the first pastor of the Protestant community of Paris. The new congregation first met on June 7, 1789 in the back room of a wine shop at the corner of rue Mond√©tour and rue du Cygne. Some of the faithful were distressed to sing the Psalms in a place that was home to more bacchanalian tunes. The church moved to 18 rue Dauphine in February, 1790, where Antoine Court de G√©belin, the famous interpreter of the Tarot, had held his meetings. In 1791, at the behest of Jean Sylvain Bailly, the mayor of Paris, and the Marquis de Lafayette, a recently suppressed church, Saint-Louis-du-Louvre was rented to the Protestants for the annual sum of 16,450 livres. On July 20, 1792 Marron came from Holland to America to deliver the funeral oration for John Paul Jones.John Paul Jones commemoration at Annapolis, April 24, 1906 In 1811 Napoleon decided to demolish Saint-Louis-du-Louvre to make way for an expansion of the Louvre. As a replacement building he gave Marron's congregation l'Oratoire du Louvre. Death Marion died on July 31, 1832 from a cholera epidemic and was buried in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. He was still the preacher at l'Oratoire at the time of his death and was succeeded by Athanase Coquerel.

In 1980 he became the first MƒÅori to be appointed as a District Court judge, and he was later the first principal Youth Court judge. ==Early life and family== Born in the Far North in 1937, Brown affiliated to NgƒÅti Kahu, Te Aup≈çuri, Te Rarawa and NgƒÅpuhi. His father was elderly and his mother died in Auckland from tuberculosis when Brown was one year old. He was subsequently fostered by the Flood family in Mount Albert. Brown's knee was affected by tuberculosis, and he spent three years between 1948 and 1951 at the Wilson School for disabled children in Takapuna, where he was friends with Bruce McLaren. He was educated at Mount Albert Grammar School from 1951 to 1956. ==Legal career== Brown initially pursued a career in teaching, but he was drawn to the law by a love of debating. He studied law at the University of Auckland, where he became friends with other law students including David Lange, Anand Satyanand, Sian Elias, Jim McLay and Doug Graham. After practising law in Auckland, Brown was appointed as a judge of the District Court in 1980, becoming the first MƒÅori to hold that position.Ken Mason (Ngai Tahu) was the first Maori to be appointed to the judiciary as a Stipendary Magistrate (later designated District Court Judge) in June 1970. He was, therefore, the first Maori judicial officer. Following the Queen Street riot in December 1984, Brown acquitted DD Smash lead singer Dave Dobbyn of charges of behaving in a manner likely to cause violence against person or property and using insulting language. In 1989 Brown was appointed the first principal judge of the Youth Court, a specialist division of the District Court, and held that office until 1995. ==University governance== Brown served as a member of the University of Auckland Council for 15 years and was the university's chancellor from 1986 to 1991. He was also pro vice-chancellor (MƒÅori) at the university until 2005. ==Honours and awards== In 1990, Brown received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. He was awarded an honorary LLD by the University of Auckland in 1992. In the 1996 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to the Youth Court, education and the community.

'As some of you already know, 2016 will be a big change for me, in the fact that I have recently decided to leave JPNSGRLS. It was a tough decision to make, but something I had been thinking about for a long time,' he said. 'Being a part of JPNSGRLS was amazing, and I am sad to leave it.

After the band mounted a search and auditioned several musicians, Colton Lauro, also from the Greater Vancouver area and having worked with several area acts as well as being a session musician, became the band's new lead guitarist in the spring of 2016. In April 2018, Charlie Kerr announced via several social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and the new band website, that the band was retiring the name of JPNSGRLS, and renaming the band as Hotel Mira. He also announced a new iteration of the band line-up, as Serl and McClelland had left the band in January 2017 for personal reasons.

They thus incurred a loss of RM300 on that tray of prawns alone. Team Mavericks began to sell their fish before the stall was properly set up. * Winning team: Apex ** Reasons for win: Both teams failed to make any profit and incurred losses instead. However, the women were able to minimise their loss by making large sales to restaurants at good margins to clear their remaining stock. They attained a loss of RM186 which was less than the men's loss of RM654. ** Reward: A private dinner at Chynna, Hilton Kuala Lumpur. * Losing Team: Mavericks ** Reasons for loss: Hanzo and Alex began channeling customers to their stall even though prices were not demarcated by the rest of the team yet.

The team also sold leftover fish at near-giveaway prices to nearby restaurants further worsening their loss. * Sent to boardroom: Hendy, Alex and Nazril * Fired: Hendy Setiono - for his inability to lead his team \\"in moments of crisis\\", lacking any form of strategy going into the task and allowing the team to be had by crafty housewives seeking the best bargain possible.

However, he reserved some criticism for Jonathan and Samuel as well, commenting that \\"all three should be fired\\". * Fired: Hanzo Ng Kian Tat - for his inability to co-operate with his team, as well as a general lack of engagement in the task. Episode 3 * Episode Title: The Hand, the Clueless Local, and the Shocking Twist * Air date: 5 June 2013 * Task: Make a sales pitch for 3 Taiwanese products (from a choice of 6) to large retailers (Giant Hypermarket and Sogo) and small retailers. The team with the highest sales revenue wins. ** The choice of products were done by alternate selection, with Apex winning the coin toss and the right to choose first. Apex chose the wireless IP camera, portable battery charger and portable bicycle and Mavericks chose the rice cooker, video projector and portable bicycle (a different model) ** Corporate restructuring: Since Mavericks lost the previous two tasks, Andrea was instructed by Fernandes to join Mavericks in order to even out the teams. * Project managers: ** Mavericks: Andrea ** Apex: Celina * Winning team: Mavericks ** Reasons for win: Although they did not make any sales to Giant due to poor pricing strategy, they came back with a large sale to Sogo. Also, the team made a decent amount of sales to small retailers because the large retailers sales pitch team decided to help sell to small retailers after they found out that Samuel and Nazril did not make many sales. They made a total of RM1,172,938. ** Reward: Shopping spree at La Martina with RM7,500 to spend among the team. * Losing team: Apex ** Reasons for loss: Although they made good sales to Giant, the products did not cater to the market that Sogo was targeting. In addition, they made poor sales to the small retailers because Ningku's hard- sell techniques put off potential buyers and Nik did not plan the route well to maximise the number of retailers they could meet. They made RM1,083,862 of sales in total. * Sent to boardroom: Celina, Nik and Ningku * Quit: Dussadee Oeawpanich \\"Dee\\" - as she felt that the cut-throat and ultra-competitive team dynamics did not suit her style of working, with team members being disrespectful to one another. While Fernandes was shocked at her decision, he eventually respected her decision and allowed her to leave. As such, no one was fired that week. * Notes: ** Fernandes chose the project managers this week, instead of the team deciding for themselves. ** Although Dussadee announced her intention to resign before the final boardroom (but after Celina chose whom to bring back to the boardroom), Fernandes still conducted the final boardroom before announcing that none would be fired. Episode 4 * Episode title: Coffee Can Be A Challenge * Air date: 12 June 2013 * Task: Promote the Nescaf√© Dolce Gusto with a pop-up caf√©. The winner would be judged by Nestl√© executives. * Project managers: ** Mavericks: Alex ** Apex: Ningku * Dramatic tension: Apex chose the ice cappucino flavour to be placed on the poster, which was not available at the retail outlet and only on the online store. Mavericks bought Ferrero Rocher chocolate to display, only to be pointed out by the Nestl√© executives that the chocolate brand belonged to their competitor. * Winning team: Mavericks ** Reasons for win: The team correctly identified the target market for the product to be premium consumers. In addition, the sales team had adequate product knowledge and engaged customers well. ** Reward: A spa trip * Losing team: Apex ** Reasons for loss: Although the team had a good tagline \\"Coffee can be an escape\\", they failed to make a good poster, showing only a single flavour (which was not even available at the retail outlet) and only one model of the machine when there were two available. Also, Ningku sent Nik and herself to distribute flyers, leaving the team short-handed at the pop-up caf√©. Furthermore, Dian mistakenly mentioned that the Genio model of the machine was manually operated when it was automatic, upsetting the Nestl√© executives. * Sent to boardroom: Ningku, Dian and Celina ** Boardroom tension: Ningku initially accepted responsibility for the task and asked to leave. However, Fernandes rejected her request (as opposed to the previous week, when Dussadee was allowed to quit.) This would have made little difference anyway, since she was fired. * Fired: Ningku Lachungpa - for poor leadership as a project manager, and for showing weakness by asking to quit the show. She had also tried to defend herself by emphasising on Dian's poor product knowledge which Fernandes felt was \\"pathetic\\". * Notes: ** This is a second week in a row that someone asked to resign. Should Fernandes had approved the request, it would be an Apprentice first whereby two competitors requested to leave the show in a row. Episode 5 * Episode title: One Befuddled Nash; One Distrusted Sam; And Winners and Losers * Air date: 19 June 2013 * Task: Make the biggest profit while trading contract for difference (CFD) products on the IG platform, starting with USD20,000 of virtual money. ** Corporate restructuring: Samuel and Alexis were asked to join Apex. Dian was asked to join Mavericks. * Project managers: ** Mavericks: Nazril ** Apex: Samuel * Winning team: Mavericks ** Reasons for win: The team adopted a conservative strategy, opening only 1 position at the start. They made a loss of $3,628. ** Reward: Dinner with IG's Head of the Asia Pacific region Tamas Szabo and Tony Fernandes at the Fukuya restaurant. * Losing team: Apex ** Reasons for loss: The team adopted an aggressive strategy at the start that failed to pay off, despite huge gains on the second day. They incurred a loss of $7,759. * Sent to boardroom: Samuel, Nik and Alexis * Fired: Nik Aisyah Amirah Binti Mansor - for failing to step up in this task given her financial background as an auditor, for making a major miscalculation, and for being the weakest member as a whole among the three. * Notes: ** Fernandes was not around to assign the task this week. Mark Lankester did the corporate restructuring and Fernandes announced the task via a video recording. ** Similar to the first task, both teams made losses, and Mavericks won by virtue of making a smaller loss. Nevertheless, Fernandes was displeased, stating that he \\"dislikes losses\\". ** Footage from this episode was later seen in an IG commercial. Episode 6 * Episode title: Tony. Loses. It. * Air date: 26 June 2013 * Task: Manage part of the Hilton Kuala Lumpur for the day. The winner would be judged by Hilton executives based on the quality of service. * Project managers: ** Mavericks: Jonathan ** Apex: Celina * Dramatic tension: Celina micro-managed Apex, calling Alexis every 2 minutes to check on their progress. This annoyed Samuel and Alexis as they were trying to focus on completing room service orders, and they eventually ignored Celina's calls. * Winning team: Apex ** Reasons for win: Despite a few minor hiccups with slow check-ins, the team provided service that most closely met Hilton's high standards of service. The executives were so impressed that they commented they would \\"hire Alex(is) right away\\". ** Reward: A night's stay at the Grand Executive Suite of Hilton Kuala Lumpur * Losing team: Mavericks ** Reasons for loss: The team made many critical errors. Nazril left the room keys at the front desk, wasting precious time as they went down to collect the keys, and overstepped his power as an employee by giving a complimentary pizza to one of the guests. Dian left the manual that described the layout of the room at the front desk, leading the housekeeping team to be unsure of the layout of the room. Jonathan took down a room service order incorrectly: when the guest ordered Mediterranean Pizza with Grilled Chicken with Feta Cheese and Olives, Jonathan only took down the latter half of the order (Grilled Chicken with Feta Cheese and Olives), leading the kitchen to produce a special order incorrectly. Furthermore, the team made a HHonors Diamond VIP member (the highest level) wait for 45-minutes to check in, which Fernandes found unacceptable. * Sent to boardroom: Jonathan, Nazril and Dian ** Boardroom tension: Jonathan and Nazril accused Dian for having a lack of integrity by claiming the manual was \\"missing\\" instead of mentioning that she left it on the front desk, and pointed that she had not stepped up during the course of the entire interview. Fernandes agreed, but he decided to give Dian a second chance. Nevertheless, he warned Dian that she would be fired the following week if she failed to step up. * Fired: Nazril Idrus \\"Nash\\" - for making too many mistakes, not just during this task, but in other challenges as well. * Notes: ** The reward for the previous week was shown in the prologue for this task. ** Andrea is on the losing team for the first time, breaking her five-week winning streak. Episode 7 * Episode title: They Rap! They Beat-box! They Make Girls Cry! * Air date: 3 July 2013 * Task: Design a new set of uniforms for AirAsia staff (guest services, weekend flight attendant and ramp attendant) and present them at a fashion show. The winner would be decided by AirAsia employees. * Project managers: ** Mavericks: Dian ** Apex: Alexis * Winning team: Mavericks ** Reasons for win: The team produced functional and fashionable uniforms that many employees liked. They especially liked the detachable apron \\"Snapron\\" on the flight attendant uniform which helped prevent wear and tear on the waist area of the uniform while pushing meal trolleys, protect the uniform from spills and included pockets to fit spare change. They won 82 votes out of 137. ** Reward: A flight lesson at the Airbus A320 flight simulator at the AirAsia Training Academy, taught by an AirAsia pilot. * Losing team: Apex ** Reasons for loss: Although the employees liked the guest services uniform, the cabin crew uniform was criticised for being too \\"old-fashioned\\", as well as having a white top which did not allow for easy clean-up after spills. They received 55 votes out of 137. * Sent to boardroom: Alexis, Samuel and Celina ** Boardroom tension: Alexis attacked Celina for her responsibility as the designer, and pointed out that she was insincere in handling people (at this point, a flashback to the previous episode was shown, in which Celina was seen attending to Hilton guests and Kathleen Tan criticising her for coming off as \\"insincere\\"). In return, Celina criticised Alexis for being a poor leader and not providing enough creative input to her designs. * Fired: Celina Le Neindre - for being responsible for the design of the uniform, being reluctant to admit her own mistakes, and not showing enough interpersonal skills - which Fernandes felt was key in his organisation. Episode 8 * Episode title: An Immature Girl, A Scheming Man, And A Fake Tony Fernandes! * Air date: 10 July 2013 * Task: Produce a live commercial for the Volkswagen Beetle (A5). * Project managers: ** Mavericks: Andrea ** Apex: Samuel * Winning team: Apex ** Reasons for win: The team produced a commercial that best met the brief, providing relevant information about the car and having a memorable tagline \\"You qualify. Beetle up.\\" ** Reward: A BlackBerry Z10 each and a chance to contact their loved ones. * Losing team: Mavericks ** Reasons for loss: The executives felt that the commercial they produced was too cheesy, generic and unmemorable. While the initial concept was good, the execution was poorly done. * Sent to boardroom: Andrea, Jonathan and Dian ** Boardroom tension: Jonathan and Dian pointed out that Andrea was not mature enough and tended to come across as a negative influence in the team. Andrea agreed with some of the pointers but felt that her flaws were part of her personality and that she has proven that she has a strong skills set, winning all but 2 of the tasks. Advisor Kathleen Tan spoke directly to Dian, saying, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here? This is the 8th task, and you‚Äôre still not stepping up. I‚Äôm very disappointed. You‚Äôve got to lead and not just shove the responsibility to your teammates!‚Äù This proved to be pivotal in Fernandes' decision, as he commented that Dian had already \\"lost Kathleen\\" and her teammates as well. * Fired: Dian Krishna Mukti - for showing the least potential among the bottom three, and for failing to step up significantly in the entire course of the interview. * Notes: ** As noted by Fernandes, this is Andrea's first time being in the bottom three. Episode 9 * Episode title: And Then, There Were Two. *Air date: 17 July 2013 *Task: Face one-on-one interviews with three of Fernandes' trusted associates. These associates would later meet in the boardroom with Fernandes and provide their inputs on the candidates. Two people will be fired. The interviewers are: ** Stuart L. Dean, Chief Executive Officer of General Electric ASEAN ** Aireen Omar, Chief Executive Officer of AirAsia ** Ruben Gnanalingam, Chief Executive Officer of Westports Malaysia * Boardroom tension: When Samuel mentioned that he previously worked with AirAsia people, Fernandes challenged him to mention some names. Samuel was stumped, while Alexis and Jonathan mentioned Aireen. However, Fernandes said that did not count, because they had just met her the same day. Andrea managed to name the five models that they worked with in Episode 7, impressing Fernandes. The other three were admonished by Fernandes for claiming that they were about \\"people and culture\\", but, in Fernandes's words, was all \\"bullshit\\". Fernandes said that he had 10,000-people working for him and he knew them all. *Fired: ** Samuel Rufus Nallaraj \\"Sam\\" - for not showing enough leadership, for being too analytical, and for his relaxed persona, which irked Fernandes as he felt that true passion translated into nervousness with every decision. ** Alexis Lothar Bauduin \\"Alex\\" - although Fernandes was impressed with Alexis' performance over the previous challenges, he was unsure of Alexis' motivations, and had doubts if this was just a stepping stone towards other things in the future. *Notes: **This is the fourth consecutive week that a candidate was fired after winning as project manager in the previous week. Episode 10 * Episode title: Bonnie And Clyde Organize A Charity Ball * Air date: 24 July 2013 * Prologue: Recaps of the first nine episodes were shown. * Task: Organise a charity black tie fundraiser for the AirAsia Foundation, with a cocktail event, charity auction and a Muay Thai demonstration. * Teams: Six eliminated contestants were available to assist Jonathan and Andrea in the task. The choice of contestants was done by alternate selection. Jonathan won the coin toss and the right to choose team members first. In addition, he had first choice of all the selections during the task. ** Team Jonathan: Samuel, Nazril, Celina ** Team Andrea: Ningku, Alexis, Dian * Notes: ** In the spirit of the Foundation, the contestants would not be judged solely based on auction proceeds. ** Unlike the American version of the show, both finalists worked on the same project instead of managing separate ones. Episode 11 (Finale) * Episode title: An Apprentice Is Chosen * Air date: 31 July 2013 * Dramatic tension: ** Jonathan's poster was criticised by AirAsia Foundation head Yap Mun Ching for having more negatives than positives, but Yap liked the idea of getting guests to sign on the poster. ** Andrea fumbled with the speech during the cocktail event, failing to get the guests' attention. (She had a smaller platform than Jonathan, who had a full stage) However, Yap felt that Andrea brought across the message of the AirAsia Foundation better when interacting with the guests. ** Jonathan conducted the auction well, however he was criticised for picking safe items that failed to attract the attention of the guests. ** Andrea fumbled during the auction again. She lost track of bids and conducted herself in a casual and unprofessional manner. Moreover, the increase in bid amounts was too slow, leading guests to shout out bid amounts instead. However, her items attracted high bids. Notably, the Richard Branson charity flight was auctioned off for RM400,000, which the crowd gave a standing ovation to. * Boardroom tension: ** The six fired team members that helped out in the task were brought back to the boardroom, and were asked to provide their feedback on Andrea and Jonathan. ** After the fired candidates left the boardroom, Fernandes pointed out that Andrea had a better winning record (6-2, 1-1 record as Project Manager, one time in bottom three) compared to Jonathan (4-4, 0-1 record as Project Manager, three times in bottom three). Jonathan pointed out that statistics are just numbers, and that even in his losses and Andrea's wins, he was a strong team member. Andrea felt that the statistics proved well that she had the versatility to do well in a wide range of tasks. ** Andrea pointed out that on several occasions, Jonathan did not step up to be the Project Manager even though the task played to his strengths in marketing and branding. ** Jonathan defended himself by arguing that he was a good team player by allowing others to be Project Manager instead of wasting time fighting over who should fill that position, and that he brought out the best in all his team members. He also pointed out Andrea's lack of positivity as a weakness, as she would shoot down ideas that she didn't like. Moreover, he doubted Andrea's intentions for being on the show. ** Jonathan argued that he was a better candidate than Andrea because he brought the best out of his team members, together with strong passion, leadership, adaptability and resilience. ** Andrea pointed out that she had greater potential, the right balance of intellect and emotion, and the drive to win. ** Fernandes asked for his advisors' opinions on who should he hire. Kathleen Tan felt that Jonathan had better people skills, bringing out the best in people, and wondered if Andrea's emotions would be a hindrance in AirAsia. On the other hand, Mark Lankester felt that Andrea had more potential and humility, the qualities of an apprentice, and that she would be a better leader. Moreover, he felt that he has not seen \\"the real Jonathan\\" yet. * Fired: Andrea Loh Ern-Yu * Hired: Jonathan Allen Yabut \\"Jon\\" * Notes: ** The teams raised a total of RM1,308,900 during the auction. The breakdown of auction proceeds from each team was not announced, although it was hinted that Andrea earned more (The Richard Branson charity flight would have made up almost half the proceeds). As mentioned above, the candidates were not judged solely based on auction proceeds. ** Jonathan won a year's contract with one of Tony Fernandes companies, reportedly AirAsia, with an undisclosed 6-figure starting salary. ==References== Category:The Apprentice (franchise) Category:Lists of reality television series episodes ","title":"List of The Apprentice Asia episodes"},{"id":"46308416","text":"Club Deportivo Utrera is a Spanish football team based in Utrera, in the autonomous community of Andalusia.

Inspired by Lewis Carroll's novels Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and Through the Looking-Glass (1871), the musical made its world premiere at the Palace Theatre, Manchester, in July 2015 as part of the Manchester International Festival. The musical transferred to London's Royal National Theatre from November 2015, before opening at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet, Paris, in 2016.'' ==Background== The musical is inspired by the novels Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, written by Lewis Carroll. On 21 January 2015, the musical was officially confirmed and it was announced that the show would premiere in July 2015, as part of the Manchester International Festival, with tickets going on sale the following day. The musical, which is a co-production between the Manchester International Festival, the Royal National Theatre and the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet, Paris, marks the 150th anniversary of the release of Alice's adventures in Wonderland. The idea for a musical based on Alice in Wonderland came from the artistic director of the Manchester International Festival, Alex Poots. Damon Albarn previously collaborated with the festival on Monkey: Journey to the West and Dr Dee.

It does not describe the Manchester World premiere version, which was significantly different in songs and some of the plot.  Act 1  The play opens with the MC telling us about technology and how it is used as \\"a portal to boundless lands\\" (\\"Prologue\\"). We are then introduced to teenager Aly. Her mother Bianca is exasperated with her as she has spent the entire weekend inside and on her phone. After some forceful persuading, Aly reluctantly follows her mum into the town and to the supermarket. Aly thinks that her life is being ruined by her parents and reflects on this whilst in the supermarket (\\"Who's Ruining Your Life?\\") Aly's father Matt is also in the supermarket and on meeting each other again, he and Bianca argue over their messy divorce and Matt's former gambling habits. Aly goes home, and fed up with everything, picks up her phone. Seeking solace online, she tries to engage with a few people from school, but is left with her self-confidence in tatters after they bully her (\\"Network\\"). Aly begins to wish that she is someone else entirely so she wouldn't have to deal with her parents' divorce or school bullies. After pasting \\"Be someone else\\" in a search engine, Aly comes across the Wonder.land app. Led by the MC, she is enticed into this strange online world and creates an avatar for herself, the beautiful and kind Alice (\\"Wonder.land\\"). There is only one rule in Wonder.land; extreme malice will result in deletion from the game. With her new identity complete, Aly and Alice befriend each other and encounter the Cheshire Cat, who explains that you can be anyone you want to be here (\\"Fabulous\\"). Fascinated, Aly decides to go on a quest and Alice follows the white rabbit down a rabbit hole, falling past various unusual objects and musical notes (\\"Falling\\"). The next morning Aly is too distracted by Wonder.land on her phone to listen to her mum's complaints about her baby brother Charlie. At school Aly plays Wonder.land on her phone through the corridors but it is confiscated by Ms Manxome, the school headmistress. In a school assembly, she laments about phone usage and tells the children that taking their pleasures from them is for their own good. (\\"I'm Right\\") During a break, Aly goes to Ms Manxome's office to retrieve her phone. Ms Manxome hands it back but gives her a warning - if she catches her with it again \\"it's a beheading- I mean detention.\\" In class Aly meets up with the three girls who bullied her online. They say they want to be friends but only if Aly says sorry. They begin to bully her again until the math teacher, Mr King, enters. Aly's friend Luke walks in late yet again and is given a detention. Still hurt by the girls' comments, Aly goes on her phone in class and takes her frustration and sadness out on Alice. Alice cries a massive pool of tears but is interrupted by Dum and Dee, two fat twins fighting with each other (\\"Freaks\\"). Alice goes to try and befriend them but her attempts backfire and they begin to insult her. Aly decides to take action and makes Alice fight them. Dum and Dee cry and Aly and Alice spot a gigantic mouse coming towards them. The mouse likes Alice's fighting and introduces himself. They are soon joined by other players, the Dodo, the Mock Turtle and Humpty, who each have problems in their lives. The Dodo is stressed because his Eco-obsessed parents want him to save the planet, Dum and Dee are dancers but hate the pressure it puts them under, Humpty has problems with her parents, the Mock Turtle has no self-esteem and hates her avatar, and the mouse is lustful. Wonderland is a place to hide for them all, taking away the pressures of teenage life (\\"Crap Life\\"). Aly snaps back to reality when Mr King asks her a math question and she is unable to answer. Given detention, Aly walks out of class with everyone else. Confronting the three bullies, Aly makes fun of one of them for having facial hair and she runs into the bathroom to hide from them. Getting out her phone, she immerses herself in Wonder.land again, where Alice meets a strange Caterpillar who is obsessed with identity (\\"Who are You?\\"). Aly realizes she has no clue who she really is. She is interrupted by the three girls who proceed to taunt her about her father's gambling addiction and poverty, then beat her up and leave. Alone and with her confidence at a new low, Aly seeks understanding in Alice, who is innocently still singing the Caterpillar's song. Alice is distraught at her friend's sadness and tries to get her to tell her what is wrong. Aly doesn't want to but Alice then reminds her that as an avatar, she isn't real. Aly is only admitting things to herself. Aly tells Alice her secrets about her family and how she hates her life, and is surprised that Alice has similar problems too, despite how liked and kind she is. (\\"Secrets\\") Luke comes into the girls' toilets, terrified as he is being threatened with violence by Kieran. Luke hides in a cubicle whilst Kieran enters. Aly defends Luke and manages to make Kieran leave. Luke reveals that the reason why Kieran hates him is because, like himself, he is gay. Aly is amazed. The friends decide to skip class and sit and play their games on their smartphones. Luke plays Zombie Swarm, whilst Aly plays Wonder.land. Ms Manxome suddenly enters the toilets. Luke hides his phone but Aly fails to. Ms Manxome confiscates the phone for three months and Aly and Luke quickly exit. Alone, Ms Manxome finds that Aly hasn't locked her phone screen and that Alice is calling her. Ms Manxome begins to talk to her and Alice thinks she is still talking to Aly. Meanwhile, Aly laments her phone being taken away from her to Luke. Aly's father Matt arrives and decides to take them out to tea to celebrate. He has a new career at the local garden centre (\\"In Clover.\\") However once at the tea shop things quickly begin to go wrong as her father's manic tendencies result in him dancing on the tables and playing with spoons on the table. When asked to stop he punches one of the waiters. Aly's mother Bianca arrives and the two begin to argue yet again. Aly is a still point in utter chaos and begins to notice that Wonder.land is invading reality as the MC emerges from a gigantic teapot and the landscape outside becomes surreally strange. (\\"Chances\\")  Act 2  Ms Manxome manipulates Alice around the gaming segment of Wonder.land on Aly's phone. Overjoyed, Ms Manxome immediately buys 3 pet playing cards, red accessories and a red dress for Alice. She changes Alice's hair to red. By the end of the gaming session, Alice is entirely under Ms Manxome's control. (\\"Entre Act\\") In the social side of Wonder.land, Ms Manxome meets with Alice and reveals her plans- to dominate and destroy the online world. Alice still thinks she is talking to Aly and so thinks nothing of this. Ms Manxome sings of the beauty \\"her\\" avatar exudes and wallows in self-absorption. (\\"Me\\") Meanwhile, Aly, her father Matt, her Mother Bianca and baby Charlie are at the police station. PC Rook tries to get Matt to take a statement as he is charged with assault and affray, but her attempts prove fruitless as Matt and Bianca argue again. Aly laments the loss of her family's unity. (\\"Heartless Useless\\") In Wonder.land, Ms Manxome is stunned when she meets Alice's avatar friends, Dum and Dee, the Mock Turtle, the Dodo, Humpty and the Mouse. Alice happily introduces them to her but Ms Manxome hates them. Telling Alice that they are \\"a rabble\\", Ms Manxome makes her chase them away, but Alice and Ms Manxome are driven away by Alice's friends, who are worried about the change in her. Is someone else controlling her? (\\"Me (Reprise)\\") At home Bianca discovers that Aly missed a detention and had her phone confiscated. Aly makes a pitiful excuse and Bianca worries that she is losing Aly to technology. She bans the internet. (\\"Gadget\\") Charlie vomits on the floor and Aly is left to clean it up, sarcastically singing about her brother. She goes out into the city, looking for an internet cafe so she can go to Wonder.land, the only place where she is truly happy. (\\"Everyone Loves Charlie\\") At the internet cafe, Aly is alarmed when she cannot log into Wonder.land and her avatar appears to be already in use. Aly watches as Alice is given a Vorpal sword, brought by Ms Manxome with the money on Aly's phone. Under Ms Manxome's control, Alice is no longer Alice, but \\"The Red Queen\\" a powerful and forceful monarch. Ms Manxome tells Alice to kill her friends. Alice is alarmed at this idea and her illusion is shattered- she now knows the person controlling her is no longer Aly. Despite this, Alice cannot rebel and under Ms Manxome's control, lashes out on her friends, bullying and attempting to hurt them. Ms Manxome is delighted and laughs at this in glee. The MC warns that Alice has a deletion warning- any more malice and she will be deleted. Both Aly and Alice are distraught. Alice is acting as if under possession and Aly now knows that Ms Manxome has seized control of her phone and avatar. (\\"O Children\\") After being told that the internet cafe will close, Aly comes up with the idea of having her friend Luke help with the problem. Aly contacts Luke through his Zombie Swarm game and tells him her problem. Aly decides to break into Ms Manxome's office to try and retrieve the phone and thus un-corrupt Alice. Luke agrees to meet her at the school gates. In his cell, Matt thinks over his and Bianca's problems, and wonders if they should put it behind them. At home, Bianca has the same thoughts. (\\"Man of Broken Glass\\") At the school gates Luke lectures Aly for not thinking her plan through. He is worried that she will do something stupid. Aly decides to break into the office anyway, leaving Luke outside the gates. Luke contacts the three girls who bullied Aly and tells them about Ms Manxome playing on Aly's stolen phone. They all decide to put the news out online so everyone will know it's not Aly. (\\"Fabulous (Reprise)\\") Bianca goes to the police station as she has now realized that Aly has gone missing, Bianca takes her smartphone out and gives it to Matt. If Aly is anywhere, she's likely to also be online and in Wonder.land. In Wonder.land, the avatars prepare for war against Alice as controlled by Ms Manxome, but they cannot agree on a strategy. In the police station, Matt hacks into Wonder.land and sees Aly's avatar Alice, but quickly realizes that she's being controlled by someone other than Aly. The White Rabbit appears, her old self for a brief second, Alice is delighted. He's going to lead her into more adventures after all. But Ms Manxome becomes violent, making Alice push him out the way. Reality and Wonder.land begin to melt into each other. Aly is now in Ms Manxome's office and grabs the phone off her when she isn't looking. They begin to fight over the phone. In Wonder.land, Alice fights between her real self and the Red Queen persona. The avatars are confused. Has Alice gone insane? In her confusion, Alice wields the vorpal sword and slices the head of the White Rabbit off. The MC declares that for two acts of extreme malice, Alice will be deleted. Aly and Alice are horrified and try to explain that Alice was hijacked but it is too late. Aly and Alice try to explain that they are the real Alice. Ms Manxome grabs the phone again and the fight resumes. As Aly and Ms Manxome fight, Matt and Bianca realize that Aly is in Ms Manxome's office and drive to come and fetch her. Online, the three girls and Luke watch. Luke comes into Wonder.land and hacks the game to include zombies from Zombie swarm. Ms Manxome makes Alice fight them off. Suddenly Ms Manxome has Aly in the guillotine in her office and is about to behead her. Alice aims the vorpal sword at Luke, but then innocently kisses him in confusion. Luke is appalled. Ms Manxome makes Alice kill Luke and flinching, Alice does. \\"(Who is Alice?\\") Horrified at what she has done, Alice fights off the Red Queen persona through glitching. Alice will be deleted in seconds, just before she is able to reveal that her quest was to help Aly understand who she was. Aly thanks her, and bids goodbye to her friend. Alice disappears. Wonder.land and reality finally part ways as in Ms Manxome's office everything settles back. Aly is reunited with Matt and Bianca. Luke has been livestreaming Ms Manxome on his phone to use as evidence. As far as Ms Manxome is concerned, she has done nothing wrong. But by breaking into the school, Aly and Luke will be expelled. Ms Manxome tells Aly that she will go to a juvenile detention centre for this. Matt finds Aly's phone and reminds Ms Manxome that she spent Aly's money on purchases for Wonder.land with it. PC Rook hears of this and declares that she'll have to take Ms Manxome down to the station with her. Ms Manxome thinks it is fine, after all, she's never wrong! (\\"I'm Right (Reprise)\\") As Ms Manxome is driven away by the police, Aly finds a renewed sense of self, she is Alice unshakably. Alice still lives in Aly's memory, and if Aly listens close enough, its almost like she can hear her. (\\"Secrets (Reprise)\\") Several months later, and as Aly goes online she finds her old friends in Wonder.land want her back. She decides not to go back, because she knows who she is now and has a new interest in her family. She might visit every now and then, but not spend all of her time there. The Company and MC reflect on the wonders of the Internet and the show draws to a close.

The Indians were coached by Pop Warner in his 1st year as head coach. The team compiled a record of 9‚Äì2 and outscored opponents 383 to 46. Frank Hudson was the quarterback and drop-kicker for the 1899 Carlisle Indian team. In a 22‚Äì10 loss to Harvard, Hudson's kicking was again a featured attraction. The New York Times reported: \\"And now came the feature of the game, for which everybody had been waiting. The Indians advanced the ball to Harvard's thirty-five-yard line, when Hudson dropped back for a goal from the field. A second later and the pigskin went straight through the goal posts, and everybody was digging his neighbors' ribs and saying, 'I told you so.'\\" For the first time, Carlisle defeated one of the \\"Big Four\\" of college football, defeating Penn by a score of 16 to 5. The 1899 Carlisle team drew further acclaim after defeating Columbia, 45‚Äì0, in a Thanksgiving Day game played at Manhattan Field near the Polo Grounds in New York. Hudson drop- kicked four goals from touchdown and one field goal in the victory over Columbia. The New York Times cited Hudson's use of the drop kick technique as one of the features of the game: > \\"The other novelty was the way in which Hudson kicked goals. Instead of > making a kick from a placed ball held by one of his eleven he chose to make > all his tries for a goal by a drop kick, and he succeeded in most of his > efforts. It was a new feature for a match game, though frequently tried in > practice.\\" With 10,000 fans in attendance, Isaac Seneca was the star of the game, having two runs of 30 yards and another of 40 yards. A press account of the game said: \\"The Indians were in prime physical condition and bore through the Columbia line and skirted the ends at will. At least eight times the Carlisle backs got around the ends for runs of thirty to sixty yards. Most of these runs were made by Seneca and Miller.\\" For just the second time in history, an eastern team traveled to the Pacific coast. Carlisle defeated the University of California by a score of 2‚Äì0. The news reported the contest as the first matchup of East and West, but was pre-dated by the 1894 Chicago vs. Stanford football game. Like the Chicago vs. Stanford game before it, the Carlisle vs. California game foreshadows the first bowl game, the 1902 Rose Bowl. At the end of the 1899 season, Seneca was elected as captain of the 1900 team (though he would opt to play professional football rather than return in 1900). Seneca was also honored by being named a first team All-American‚Äîthe first Carlisle player and the first American Indian to be so honored. With its only two losses having come to Harvard and Princeton (ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the country), the 1899 Carlisle team was ranked No. 4 in the country by Walter Camp. ==ScheduleSee also== * 1899 College Football All-America Team ==References== Carlisle Category:Carlisle Indians football seasons Carlisle Football ","title":"1899 Carlisle Indians football team"},{"id":"46308435","text":"Samantha Logic (born October 22, 1992) is an American basketball player.

It was formed of the Watton and Swaffham Railway, founded in 1866 as an independent venture by the Thetford and Watton Railway Company. Freight services commenced in January 1869, with passenger services in October 1869. The line ran from Thetford, via Watton to a junction with the Lynn and Dereham Railway at Swaffham and was completed in 1875. The extension to Swaffham cost ¬£72,000, On 21 July 1879 the line was leased to the Great Eastern Railway for 999 years, commencing 1 March 1880. It was vested into the GER in 1897, becoming part of the London and North Eastern Railway on 1 January 1923. The line was closed to passengers on 15 June 1964, with a two- car diesel multiple unit (DMU) driven by driver David Grant of Dereham operating the final service. There were only 70 passengers on the final stage of the journey. Roudham Junction to Watton was closed completely at this time, and the remainder was closed to freight on 19 April 1965, after transporting the final sugar beet and coal traffic. ==Rolling stock== On opening, the railway was approached by Robert Fairlie, who wanted a line to test his \\"Fairlie Steam Carriage\\",Image of the Fairlie Steam Carriage but the railway company were not interested in this proposal. Instead locomotives were obtained from Manning Wardle & Co. These were 0-6-0 tank locomotives with 3-foot driving wheels and 11-inch cylinders. The railway also secured a rebuilt 3'6\\" saddle tank. These locomotives were maintained at a shed at Watton. Two more Manning Wardle tanks, and two Sharp, Stewart and Company 0-4-2 tender locomotives were added by September 1876. The railway was taken over by the Great Eastern Railway in 1880, with the locomotives joining the GER stock list. The Sharp locomotives being scrapped in 1891 and the tank engines in the late 1880s. ==List of stations== * Swaffham - line and station closed. * Holme Hale - line and station closed. * Watton - line and station closed. * Stow Bedon - line and station closed. * Wretham and Hockham - line and station closed. * Roudham Junction railway station - line open, station closed. * Thetford - line and station open. ==The route today== The line was lifted after closure. The route either side of Stow Bedon station has been removed, and the station site levelled. The section of line between Stow Bedon and Wretham was intended to be used for a new road, and Stow Bedon station was demolished as part of this plan. The road was not, however, constructed. Watton station has also been demolished and the site redeveloped, although a level crossing gate survived on Church Road as late as 1983. The line from the junction with the Dereham line at Swaffham remains unobstructed, although with some bridges removed. Holme Hale station remains as a private residence, complete with signal box and signal post - although heavily extended.Norfolk Heritage Explorer: Route of Thetford, Watton and Swaffham Railway (later Great Eastern) Loch Neaton One of the ballast quarries created during the construction of the railway through Watton was converted into a leisure park and bathing lake known as Loch Neaton.

Childhood mortality was high in Medieval Scotland. The archaeology of burial sites suggests that childhood illness were common. Many individuals in Scottish urban society were affected by childhood disease and accidents that significantly affected their life chances. Wet-nursing had become common by the fifteenth century. Fosterage was common among Highland clan leaders. From the age of three children took part in imaginative play and more formal games such as football, golf, archery, and various bowling games. The rich may have taken part in hunting and hawking and there is evidence from the sixteenth century of bear-baiting, cock-fighting and dogfighting. In Gaelic society there were schools for bards and after the introduction of Christianity schools developed as part of monasteries and other religious institutions. There were also petty schools, more common in rural areas and providing an elementary education. By the end of the fifteenth century, Edinburgh also had \\"sewing schools\\" for girls. The growing emphasis on education culminated with the passing of the Education Act 1496. Boys wanting to attend universities had to go abroad until the founding of three Scottish universities in the fifteenth century. The majority of children did not attend school. In the families of craftsmen they might become apprentices or journeymen. In Lowland rural society many probably left home to become domestic and agricultural servants. By the late Medieval era, Lowland society was probably part of the north-west European marriage model, of life-cycle service and late marriage. ==Birth and infancy== Stone font in St Ternan's Church, Banchory Childhood mortality was high in Medieval Scotland.E. Ewen, \\"'Hamperit in ane holy came': sights, smells and sounds in the Medieval town\\", in E. J. Cowan and L.

Wormald, eds, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 278. Cemeteries may not represent a cross section of Medieval society, but in one Aberdeen burial site 53 per cent of those buried were under the age of six and in one Linlithgow cemetery it was 58 per cent. The diseases that are easiest to spot in the archaeological record are those that caused a \\"metabolic insult\\" evident in surviving bones and teeth. These were common in children up until about the age of four. These may have been due to increased risk from disease once the protective antibodies in a mother's milk ended after weening. There was also greater exposure to hard and soft tissue trauma, and subsequent infection, as children became more mobile by crawling and toddling. Iron deficiency anaemia was common among children, probably caused by long-term breastfeeding by mothers that were themselves deficient in minerals. Common childhood diseases included measles, diphtheria and whooping-cough, while parasites were also common. The most badly affected individuals rarely made it beyond the age of 25, thus many individuals in Scottish urban society were affected by childhood disease and accidents that significantly affected their life chances.R. D. Oran, \\"Disease, death and the hereafter in medieval Scotland\\", in E. J. Cowan and L. Henderson, eds, A History of Everyday Life in Medieval Scotland: 1000 to 1600 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2011), , pp. 198‚Äì200. In Lowland noble and wealthy society by the fifteenth century the practice of wet-nursing had become common. In Highland society there was a system of fosterage among clan leaders, where boys and girls would leave their parent's house to be brought up in that of other chiefs, creating a fictive bond of kinship that helped cement alliances and mutual bonds of obligation.A.

After the \\"de-gallicisation\\" of the Scottish court from the twelfth century, an order of bards took over the functions of poets, musicians and historians, often attached to the court of a lord or king, and passing on their knowledge in Gaelic to the next generation. They would continue to act in a similar role in the Highlands and Islands into the eighteenth century. They often trained in bardic schools, of which a few, like the one run by the MacMhuirich dynasty, who were bards to the Lord of the Isles,K. M. Brown, Noble Society in Scotland: Wealth, Family and Culture from the Reformation to the Revolutions (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , p. 220. existed in Scotland and a larger number in Ireland, until they were suppressed from the seventeenth century.R. A. Houston, Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , p. 76. The establishment of Christianity brought Latin to Scotland as a scholarly and written language. Monasteries served as major repositories of knowledge and education, often running schools and providing a small educated elite, who were essential to create and read documents in a largely illiterate society.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , p. 128. In the High Middle Ages new sources of education arose, with song and grammar schools. These were usually attached to cathedrals or a collegiate church and were most common in the developing burghs. By the end of the Middle Ages grammar schools could be found in all the main burghs and some small towns. Early examples including the High School of Glasgow in 1124 and the High School of Dundee in 1239. There were also petty schools, more common in rural areas and providing an elementary education.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (Random House, 2011), , pp. 104‚Äì7. Some monasteries, like the Cistercian abbey at Kinloss, opened their doors to a wider range of students. The number and size of these schools seems to have expanded rapidly from the 1380s. They were almost exclusively aimed at boys, but by the end of the fifteenth century, Edinburgh also had schools for girls, sometimes described as \\"sewing schools\\", and probably taught by lay women or nuns. There was also the development of private tuition in the families of lords and wealthy burghers. The growing emphasis on education culminated with the passing of the Education Act 1496, which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools to learn \\"perfyct Latyne\\". All this resulted in an increase in literacy, but which was largely concentrated among a male and wealthy elite,P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2006), , pp. 29‚Äì30. with perhaps 60 per cent of the nobility being literate by the end of the period.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 68‚Äì72. Tower of St Salvator's College, St Andrews, one of the three universities founded in the fifteenth century In the Middle Ages, boys entering university did so younger than now, at about the age of 15 or 16.D. R. Leader, A History of the University of Cambridge: Volume 1, The University to 1546 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), p. 36. Until the fifteenth century, those who wished to attend university had to travel to England or the continent, and just over a 1,000 have been identified as doing so between the twelfth century and 1410. After the outbreak of the Wars of Independence, with occasional exceptions under safe conduct, English universities were closed to Scots and continental universities became more significant.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 124‚Äì5. Some Scottish scholars became teachers in continental universities. This situation was transformed by the founding of the University of St Andrews in 1413, the University of Glasgow in 1451 and the University of Aberdeen in 1495. Initially these institutions were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who would begin to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative posts in the government and law. Those wanting to study for second degrees still needed to go elsewhere and Scottish scholars continued to visit the continent and English universities, which reopened to Scots in the late fifteenth century. ==Youth== The majority of children, even in urban centres where opportunities for formal education were greatest, did not attend school. In the families of craftsmen children probably carried out simpler tasks. They might later become apprentices or journeymen.E. Ewen, \\"An urban community: the crafts in thirteenth-century Aberdeen\\", in A. Grant and K. K. J. Stringer, eds, Medieval Scotland: Crown, Lordship and Community (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), , p. 157. In Lowland rural society, as in England, many young people, both male and female, probably left home to become domestic and agricultural servants, as they can be seen doing in large numbers from the sixteenth century.I. D. Whyte, \\"Population mobility in early modern Scotland\\", in R. A. Houston and I. D. Whyte, Scottish Society, 1500‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), , p. 52. By the late Medieval era, Lowland society was probably part of the north-west European marriage model, of life- cycle service and late marriage, usually in the mid-20s, delayed by the need to acquire the resources needed to be able to form a household.E.

Vernon Cole (1922 ‚Äì August 30, 2013) was a soil scientist known primarily for his work on nutrient cycling in agroecosystems. He was a member of Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Second Assessment report, and the lead author of Chapter 23 ‚ÄúAgricultural Options for Mitigation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions‚Äù. The IPCC was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. == Biography == He was born in Wenatchee, Washington on November 12, 1922 to Frederick and Olive Cole. He was raised and educated in Stow, Massachusetts. He served as a member of the US Army in WWII in the Philippines and Japan. After the war, he obtained his B.S. in Chemistry (1947) and in M.S. in Agronomy (1948) from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He then went to Madison, Wisconsin and earned his Ph.D. in Soil Science from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in 1950. Soon after, Dr. Cole settled in Fort Collins, Colorado where he worked jointly for the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory at Colorado State University and the Agricultural Research Service (USDA). He retired in 1993, and moved to Estes Park, CO. == Scientific work == Acknowledgement of C. Vernon Cole's contribution to the IPCC when it won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 Dr. C Vernon Cole was a soil scientist who specialized in soil chemistry, especially phosphorus cycling. He conducted research at the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory at Colorado State University and Agricultural Research Service (USDA) from 1950 to 1993. During this time, he contributed significant advances in the knowledge of phosphorus chemistry, including a method for extracting phosphorus from soil that has been adopted worldwide and cited over 5,000 times. His research expanded into plant responses to phosphorus and then into broader studies of phosphorus cycling in relation to organic carbon and nitrogen transformations. He was the principal investigator on two major interdisciplinary projects, entitled ‚ÄúOrganic Matter and Nutrient Cycling in Semiarid Agroecosystems‚Äù (1979-1985) and ‚ÄúOrganic C, N, S and P Formation and Loss from Great Plains Agroecosystems‚Äù (1985-1989).Soil Organic Matter in Temperate Agroecosystems: Long Term Experiments in North America. CRC Press These two projects were major undertakings that were at the forefront of ecosystem science (which was only just beginning to develop as its own field of research) because they integrated ecological and pedological principles, and employed scientists from the two disciplines. This work led to significant advances in the understanding of management impacts on nutrient cycling and long-term productivity in agroecosystems, and paved the way for collaborative research in ecosystem science. Around the same time, Dr. Cole and his colleagues were pioneering the development of ecosystem models to understand and predict plant nutrient dynamics in the soil and ecosystem. At the time, modeling was not widely used for this purpose, but the idea gained traction over the 1980s and 90s and modeling is now a standard tool in ecosystem science. Dr. Cole was a leader in the international scientific community. He was highly involved in the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE), serving as a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee on Biogeochemical Cycles and as the chairman of the International Phosphorus Project. As part of that work, he organized four regional workshops on Phosphorus Cycling that brought together 240 scientists from 51 countries. These took place in Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa, and culminated in a final synthesis workshop in Budapest in 1993. After his retirement in 1993, Dr. Cole continued his research contributions through publications and working with students and colleagues. == Key publications == * Cole, C.V., and M.L. Jackson. 1950.

Pfister competed at the 2015 Ford World Men's Curling Championship in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, as skip for the Swiss national curling team. The Swiss team had a great start at the tournament, but lost their last five games. These last five consecutive losses placed the young Swiss team at 5‚Äì6 after the round robin, finishing 7th. Also that season, Pfister and partner Carole Howald competed at the 2015 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship, placing in 13th overall. Sven Michel joined the team in 2015 to skip the rink. They would play in three Grand Slams, missing the playoffs in all of them. Pfister returned to the Worlds in 2016, on this team. The team had another disappointing tournament, going 4‚Äì7 and finishing 9th. After the season, Pfister took over as the skip of the team with Michel leaving them. Pfister skipped the Swiss team again at the 2018 World Men's Curling Championship. He led his team to a 6‚Äì6 record, in 7th place. They narrowly missed the playoffs, as they had the same record as the United States, but missed the playoffs by virtue of losing their last round robin game to the Americans who qualified in their stead. That season, Team Pfister won the German Masters which would qualify for them to play in the 2018 Humpty's Champions Cup, Pfister's first Grand Slam event as a skip. There, he went winless, missing the playoffs. ==Grand Slam record== {  border=\\"1\\" - !

Archaeology quickly became the primary focus of his studies, thanks especially to the influence of his teacher at M√ºnster, Friedrich Matz the Younger. In Munich he was mainly influenced by Ernst Buschor. In 1942 he received his doctorate for a work on depictions of Nike in the round completed at Munich. From 1945, Alscher led the establishment of the archaeological institute at the University of Jena, which he was director of until 1951. During this period, Alscher achieved his habilitation, in 1950, with a work on early Greek minor sculpture. The work was the first part of a multi-volume work on Greek sculpture, Griechische Plastik. In 1951, Alscher was hired by the Humboldt University of Berlin, where he taught as a lecturer until 1952, a lecturing professor until 1953 and as chair thereafter. In 1968 his chair was incorporated into the research area of Aesthetics and Art History. On the one hand, this ran against Alscher's interests, but on the other hand he had to accept that classical archaeology at Humboldt University at this time was in trouble. Most of the department's space had been lost and the subject was being reduced to an insignificant specialisation by political pressures. Nevertheless, Alscher as head of the department was one of the leading scholars of classical archaeology in the DDR. Along with such scholars as Gottfried von L√ºcken, Carl Bl√ºmel, Elisabeth Rohde and Gerhard Zinserling he was one of the most influential voices in his subject. In 1985 he died unexpectedly. His successor at Humboldt University was his student and long- term colleague Wolfgang Schindler. A large portion of the young archaeologists of the DDR were direct or indirect students of Alscher. Alscher focussed on the archaeological remnants of Greco-Roman antiquity. At the beginning of his time in Berlin, he restored the newly renamed Classical Archaeology Institute with scarce resources. This included the Institute's library which had to be assembled from scratch using old stocks and the library of Gerhart Rodenwaldt. In this he was supported for a long time by his two research assistants, Evamaria Schmidt and Wolfgang Schindler. His magnum opus was a five-part account of Greek sculpture in six volumes (I [1954], II/1 [1961], II/2 [1982, 1963], III [1956], IV [1957]). The long delay of volume II/2 resulted from increasing new information on the so-called Boston Throne and from health issues, which long troubled Alscher. He subsequently worked on a three-part continuation on Roman portraiture, of which only the first volume was published. Alscher approached the archaeological objects through form analysis. In his work, the significance and function of the objects under consideration was critical. In his research he united the insights and break- throughs of his teachers Metz and Buschor. According to Arch√§ologenbildnisse, Alscher was the most important German-speaking classical archaeologist of the post-war period.Wolfgang Schindler: Ludger Alscher, in Reinhard Lullies and Wolfgang Schiering (Edd.): Arch√§ologenbildnisse.

He was the son of Arnold von Tolnai, an official of the Hungarian administration. In 1918, he began studying art history and archaeology as Karl Tolnai in Germany, first at the University of Berlin (under Adolph Goldschmidt), then at the University of Frankfurt (under Rudolf Kautzsch). During these early years he was also a keen traveller. Between 1921 and 1922 he made his first trip to Belgium, visiting Brussels, Antwerp, Leuven, Ghent, Bruges, and Liege. In 1923 he went to Paris, Occitania, Spain, Lisbon, Turin, Milan and Venice. In 1924 he made a hundred- day journey to Italy, visiting Florence and Rome, where he was struck by the art of Michelangelo. He continued studying art history at the University of Vienna (under Julius von Schlosser and Max Dvo≈ô√°k), where he wrote a Ph.D. thesis on Hieronymus Bosch (1925).Hans Sedlmayr, Art in Crisis (New Brunswick, 2007), p. 186, note 2. In 1928 he became lecturer at the University of Hamburg and a friend of the young Erwin Panofsky. There Tolnay wrote his Habilitationsschrift on Michelangelo's late architecture (1929). He then moved to Rome, where he did much research at the Bibliotheca Hertziana. Between 1934 and 1939, he taught art history at the Sorbonne, Paris, where he changed his name to Charles de Tolnay. In 1939, he immigrated to the United States, where he became a citizen in 1945, working at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey, for some years. According to Ernest H. Wilkins, \\"Of the many specialists resident at the Institute for Advanced Study, probably none is a more tireless investigator than Charles de Tolnay, Hungarian-born authority on Renaissance art.\\"Ernest H. Wilkins, \\"Petrarca, Valla, Ficino, Pico, Pomponazzi, Vives: The Renaissance Philosophy of Man.

In 1953, Tolnay was appointed professor of art history at Columbia University, where he retired in 1965. In the same year, he became Director of the Casa Buonarroti in Florence, which he helped to reorganize.Casa Buonarroti: Biblioteca He wrote fundamental studies on Flemish painting, in particular Bosch, Jan van Eyck and the Master of Fl√©malle, Hugo van der Goes and Peter Paul Rubens, but also on the painting of Rembrandt and Jan Vermeer. From 1943 on, his attention focused on Michelangelo, which resulted in a 5-volume study on his work, which has been called \\"the biggest, most learned study of Michelangelo in our generation\\".Creighton Gilbert, \\"Tolnay‚Äôs Michelangelo\\" Also important are his writings on the court of Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary and Croatia, and the works of Bicci di Lorenzo, Masaccio, Filippo Lippi, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci, Tintoretto, Pontormo, Diego Vel√°zquez, Nicolas Poussin, Antoine Watteau, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Paul Cezanne, and others. Tolnay died on January 17, 1981, in Florence. According to Erwin Panofsky, Tolnay \\"excels by a rare combination of constructive scientific imagination and thorough connoisseurship ... Thanks to his extraordinary energy, Dr. v. Tolnay has greatly promoted our knowledge of Bosch, Breughel, and most particularly Michelangelo.\\" According to Ernest Manheim, \\"everybody liked Tolnay because he had very interesting opinions.

He had three siblings: Raymond Charles de Candolle 1864‚Äì1935, Florence Pauline Lucienne de Candolle 1865‚Äì1943 and Reyne Marguerite de Candolle 1876‚Äì1958. Having initially studied in Geneva, he was sent to England because of the maternal family connections and, in 1883, was sent to Rugby School where he remained until 1887. He then spent time in Frankfurt to improve his German before returning to London to study for the Civil Service, with the intention of entering the Diplomatic Service. However, he was obliged to abandon that ambition and, instead, studied for a career in law in Leipzig and Heidelberg from 1890 to 1893. Despite this he was always oriented towards botany, and, returning to Geneva, he vowed to continue the botanical family dynasty. He married Louise de Saugy in 1895 and they had three daughters and two sons. ==Career== Not having particularly prepared for a career in botany, he was mentored by his father. He made a study of the east Madagascan collection of Emile Mocquerys, publishing several descriptions of new species in conjunction with colleagues. In 1912 he was called to work for the British consulate, a role for which his formal education had prepared him well. The demands of this, particularly during the four years of World War I, inevitably reduced his botanical studies. The death of his father in 1918, and the end of war prompted him to resign from the consulate and he was set to continue his botanic career with renewed vigour. His death, at the age of 51, was unexpected. After his death, the de Candolle herbarium collection comprising 400,000 specimens and substantial library of 14,000 works, (which included a copy of the 1485, Herbarius latinus, the earliest illustrated work known, along with other pre-Linnean works) was donated to the city of Geneva == Awards, honours and affiliations == Member of: * Swiss Society of Natural Sciences * Botanical Society of Geneva, president 1903‚Äì1907 * Botanical Society of Switzerland * Geneva Society of Physical and Natural History, of which he was first treasurer, then president in 1914 == References == * * == External links == * Category:Swiss botanists Category:Swiss academics Category:People from the canton of Geneva Category:People educated at Rugby School Category:Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Switzerland Category:1868 births Category:1920 deaths ","title":"Richard √âmile Augustin de Candolle"},{"id":"46308839","text":"Events in the year 1816 in Brazil. ==Incumbents== * Monarch ‚Äì Queen Mary I of Portugal (until 20 March); King John VI of Portugal (starting 20 March) ==EventsBirthsDeaths== March * March 20 - Queen Mary I dies at the age of 81, leaving the throne to her 48-year old son John VI. ==References== Category:1810s in Brazil Category:Years of the 19th century in Brazil Brazil Brazil ","title":"1816 in Brazil"},{"id":"46308846","text":"Events in the year 1827 in Brazil. ==Incumbents== * Monarch ‚Äì Emperor Pedro I ==EventsBirthsDeathsReferences== Category:1820s in Brazil Category:Years of the 19th century in Brazil Brazil Brazil ","title":"1827 in Brazil"},{"id":"46308854","text":"Events in the year 1839 in Brazil. ==Incumbents== * Monarch ‚Äì None, regency (de facto); Emperor Pedro II (de jure) ==EventsBirthsDeathsReferences== Category:1830s in Brazil Category:Years of the 19th century in Brazil Brazil Brazil ","title":"1839 in Brazil"},{"id":"46308861","text":"Reidsville Historic District is a national historic district located at Reidsville, Rockingham County, North Carolina.

It is authored by Paul the Apostle about mid-50s to early 60s AD and addressed to the Christians in Philippi, written either in Rome or Ephesus. This chapter contains the greeting, thanksgiving, prayer and exhortation as an introduction (overture) to the major narratives in the next chapters. ==Text== The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 30 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Codex Vaticanus (AD 325-350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330-360) *Codex Alexandrinus (400-440) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (c. 450; extant verses 23-30) *Codex Freerianus (c. 450; extant verses 1-4, 11-13, 20-23) *Codex Claromontanus (c. 550) ==Greeting 1:1‚Äì2== The epistle opens using a formula found in other Paul's epistles, here with the introduction of himself and Timothy as Christ's \\"slaves\\" (\\"bondservants\\") as in . Verse 1 : Paul and Timothy, bondservants of Jesus Christ, :: To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: NKJV *\\"Bishops and deacons\\" could be translated as \\"overseers\\" and \\"helpers\\";\\"Overseers\\" in the New International Version and Darby Translation; \\"helpers\\" in the Good News Translation their functions in the church were not the same as they would later become. Verse 2 : Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. NKJV The wording is identical to .Moule, H. C. G., Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges. Philippians 1. Accessed 28 April 2019 ==Thanksgiving and Prayer 1:3‚Äì11== This is a common feature in Paul's epistles. Except in Galatians, Paul thanks or blesses God for the good things he has heard about a particular church in the beginning of his letters. In this epistle, Paul mixes it with his prayer for the church (1:3‚Äì4) and with joy (1:5), \\"a combination he will recommend in 4:6\\". Lutheran pietist Johann Albrecht Bengel says that the whole letter can this be summarised: \\"The sum of the epistle is, I rejoice, rejoice ye\\".Bengel, J. A., Bengel's Gnomon of the New Testament on Philippians 1, accessed 8 June 2020 Similarly Paul writes to the Thessalonians: Rejoice always; pray without ceasing. ==Paul's Situation in Chains 1:12‚Äì26== This section deals with Paul's condition during the confinement in a Roman administrative center, where he could still preach the gospel. It consists of two subsections with distinctive keywords: the first subsection (verses 12‚Äì18) was marked off with two words, \\"progress\\" (prokope; verse 12) and \\"confidence\\" (verse 14), and the second one (verses 19‚Äì26) has the inclusio markers \\"joy\\", \\"progress\\" and \\"trusting\\". Verse 18 : What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice. NKJV *\\"Is preached\\": the Greek (present) tense is best represented in modern English by \\"is being proclaimed\\". Verse 21 : For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain. NKJV * \\"To live is Christ\\": Christ becomes \\"efficiently\\" a believer's life, as the efficient cause and author of his spiritual life. * \\"To die is gain\\": It is not easy to say what a believer may gain by dying, but as soon as one dies one enters into the presence of God, where fullness of joy is, and immediately with Christ, which is far better than being here. This is the common interpretation, and is shown by the Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopian versions, which read, \\"to die\\", or \\"if I die, it is gain to me\\".John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible, - Philippians 1:21 ==Steadfastness in the face of opposition - 1:27‚Äì30== Paul states his wish that the Philippians have \\"steadfast unity in fidelity to the gospel\\" (verse 27) and \\"bold resistance to their opponents\\" (verse 28). ==See also== * Bishop * Deacon * Jesus Christ * Paul the Apostle * Philippi * Saint Timothy * Related Bible parts: Matthew 5, John 15, John 17, Romans 8, 2 Corinthians 13, Galatians 5 ==ReferencesBibliography== * * ==External links== * King James Bible - Wikisource *English Translation with Parallel Latin Vulgate *Online Bible at GospelHall.org (ESV, KJV, Darby, American Standard Version, Bible in Basic English) *Multiple bible versions at Bible Gateway (NKJV, NIV, NRSV etc.) 01 ","title":"Philippians 1"},{"id":"46308878","text":"Events in the year 1829 in Brazil. ==Incumbents== * Monarch ‚Äì Emperor Pedro I ==EventsBirthsDeathsReferences== Category:1820s in Brazil Category:Years of the 19th century in Brazil Brazil Brazil ","title":"1829 in Brazil"},{"id":"46308880","text":"Events in the year 1817 in Brazil. ==Incumbents== * Monarch ‚Äì King John VI of Portugal ==EventsBirths== * Jos√© Lu√≠s Mena Barreto (d. 1879) ==DeathsReferences== Category:1810s in Brazil Category:Years of the 19th century in Brazil Brazil Brazil ","title":"1817 in Brazil"},{"id":"46308896","text":"One Thousand Museum is a high-rise residential condominium in Miami, Florida, United States. The building, which is located at 1000 Biscayne Boulevard, across from Museum Park, was designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Zaha Hadid. After the death of Hadid, the Project Director of Zaha Hadid Architects, Chris Lepine, completed the project. Completed in 2019, the 62-story building stands at a height of , making it one of the tallest buildings in Miami. The deep foundation required drilling to record depths of over by HJ Foundation, part of the Keller Group. The depths of two auger-cast piles broke a record for Miami-Dade County that had recently been set by HJ Foundation at the Porsche Design Tower in Sunny Isles Beach. The exotic design of the building features a curving exoskeleton partially obscuring the balconies that also serves structural purposes, allowing the interior space to have fewer columns. To meet the architect's designs of smoothness and finish, the columns were finished with glass fiber reinforced concrete permanent form works. The effect of the design and height on wind loading is part of the reason the foundation had to be exceptionally deep. The building is considered ultra-luxury, containing about 84 large units priced at about double the cost per square foot of nearby condominium towers, with amenities possibly including a rooftop helipad. In early 2018, before the building was finished, an episode of PBS' Impossible Builds featured the building, which they referred to as the \\"scorpion tower\\", and described it as \\"one of the most complex skyscrapers ever to make it off the drawing board.\\" == Design == Designed by Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid, One Thousand Museum was Zaha Hadid's first residential tower in the Western Hemisphere, and one the final projects designed by Hadid in her lifetime. It was designed in association with O‚ÄôDonnell Dannwolf Partners Architects, a local architecture firm. A notable feature of the building is the curving exoskeleton, allowing the interior space to have fewer columns. The exoskeleton is composed of 5,000 pieces of glass fiber reinforced concrete. These pieces were shipped from Dubai early in the construction process. The exoskeleton is located in front of a glass facade. The building was topped out in February 2018. == Facilities == The building contains 84 residences, consisting of a two-story duplex penthouse, 4 townhouses, 10 full-floor residences, and 70 half-floor units. A swimming pool is installed at the top of the building, covered by a curving, faceted metal ceiling that reflects the water. The double-height space is occupied by the pool on one side and a seating area on the other. A similar metallic canopy design is used for the bar. A full two-room treatment spa, hair and beauty salon, acai and juice bar fueled by Raw Republic, and a sunbathing area is also installed, alongside a multimedia tower. == Gallery == File:1000 Museum construction December 2016.jpgDecember 2016 File:One Thousand Museum August 2017.jpgAugust 2017 File:One Thousand Museum construction December 2017.jpgDecember 2017; exoskeleton is clearly shown. ==ReferencesOne Thousand Museum (PDF) Category:Buildings and structures under construction in the United States Category:Zaha Hadid buildings ","title":"One Thousand Museum"},{"id":"46308897","text":"Events in the year 1818 in Brazil. ==Incumbents== * Monarch ‚Äì King John VI of Portugal ==EventsBirthsDeathsReferences== Category:1810s in Brazil Category:Years of the 19th century in Brazil Brazil Brazil ","title":"1818 in Brazil"},{"id":"46308899","text":"The Prime Minister of Morocco (officially Head of Government) is the head of government of the Kingdom of Morocco and serves in a position akin to a prime minister in other constitutional monarchies. The Prime Minister is chosen by the king of Morocco from the largest party elected to parliament. The Constitution of Morocco grants executive powers to the government and allows the head of government to propose and dismiss cabinet members, provincial governors, and ambassadors, to oversee government programs and the delivery of public services, and to dissolve the lower house of parliament with the king's approval. A newly appointed prime minister is responsible for forming the government it will head by leading negotiations between the king and parliament to fill ministry positions. Until the new government is approved by the king and formally takes office, parliament approves and oversees government programs and public service. There are no constitutional limits on a prime minister's term, and several have served multiple non-consecutive terms. Unlike typical presidential systems where the president is the highest ranking leader of the executive branch and is considered both head of government and head of state, the Moroccan head of state is the king who holds substantial discretionary power over the executive branch and has exclusive authority over the military, religion, and the judiciary.

It is authored by Paul the Apostle, probably in the mid-50s or early 60s CE and addressed to the Christians in Philippi. This chapter contains Paul's comments and exhortations centering on a narrative about his life. ==Text== The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 21 verses. The Philippians Fragments Hypothesis suggests that to constitutes a separate letter from the rest of the text, known as the Kampfbrief or Letter C.Sellew, P., \\"Laodiceans\\" and the Philippians Fragments Hypothesis, Harvard Theological Review, Vol. 87, No. 1 (Jan., 1994), pp. 17-28 Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 16 (3rd century; extant verses 10‚Äì17) *Codex Vaticanus (325-350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330-360) *Codex Alexandrinus (400-440) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; extant verses 1-4) *Codex Freerianus (~450; extant verses 4-6, 14-17) *Codex Claromontanus (~550) ==Paul's re-evaluation of values through Christ (3:1‚Äì11)== Paul tells his own story to draw the people's minds back to Christ, how he 'emptied himself' for Christ's sake and how his ultimate goal was now to follow the \\"upward call of God\\" (verse 14) to the end. Paul describes how his values had changed since becoming a follower of Christ. Jesuit theologian Robert Murray describes this process as a \\"transvaluation of values\\", using a phrase adopted from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. Verse 3 : For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh, NKJV Verse 5 : circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee; NKJV Verse 8 : Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ NKJV *\\"I count all things loss\\": in comparison to knowing Christ, anything else falls short. *\\"The excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus\\": is not meant subjectively about the knowledge \\"in Christ\\" or \\"about Christ\\" (as God or as man), but objectively, knowing him in person, as God of all, mainly as \\"Savior and Redeemer\\", as Paul emphasizes using the words, \\"my Lord\\". The knowledge is attained, not by natural enlightenment, nor by reasoning, nor by the law of Moses, but by the Gospel of the grace of God. The efficient cause of this knowledge is God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; the Father reveals Christ to his followers; the Son gives them an understanding to know him; and the Spirit gives wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him. This spiritual knowledge of Christ is more excellent than a knowledge of Christ as human, as the knowledge of Christ from the Gospel is also more excellent than that of the legal dispensation, by promises, prophecies, and the ceremonial law. * \\"For whom I have suffered the loss of all things\\": Paul dropped all confidence in his bodily privileges, civil, ceremonial, and moral righteousness, for Christ and his righteousness; losing his own good name and reputation among men, suffering many kinds of persecutions, losing the comforts of life, often in cold or nakedness, in hunger or thirst, even being ready to lose his own life for professing and preaching Christ. *\\"Count them as rubbish\\" (KJV: \\"dung\\"): or \\"dog's meat\\" (), what is only fit for dogs; that is, Paul treats as \\"worthless\\" his pedigree, religion sect, and moral righteousness before and after conversion; and everything material that he owns, same as what the early church held, considering its own righteousness as \\"filthy rags\\". *\\"That I may gain Christ\\": not just get \\"an interest in him\\", as this he knew he had already, and should never lose it, for it commenced from all eternity and cannot be obtained by good works, nor repentance, nor faith, but is freely given. Paul wishes that he might gain a larger knowledge of Christ, without care what pains he took, what expenses he was at, nor what loss he sustained or already suffered for what he regards precious, even willing to lose more, for more of this knowledge (cf. ), because then he gain more with Christ as a \\"justifying righteousness\\": acceptance with God, pardon, life, peace, grace, and glory.John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible, - Philippians 3:8 ==Following the Upward Call (3:12‚Äì16)== Paul emphasizes that while he has not 'obtained' (elabori) the resurrection or 'been made perfect' (NRSV, cf. ), but he said 'I press on' (dioko, lit. pursue; cf. ), 'to grasp it (katalabo), as I have been grasped by Christ Jesus'. ==Citizens of earth and heaven (3:17‚Äì4:1)== Paul states that it is right to be good citizens, but 'our citizenship (politeuma) is in heaven'. Murray joins verse 4:1 with this section as the conclusion of Paul's main exhortations in chapters 2‚Äì3. The section calls on the Philippians to be (summimetai, co-imitators) of himself, a word which is \\"not elsewhere preserved\\"., \\"imitators together\\" in the American Standard Version; \\"co-imitators\\" is from the English translation of Heinrich August Wilhelm Meyer's NT Commentary on Philippians 3 (1880) ==See also== * Jesus Christ * Knowledge of Christ * Pharisees * Torah * Tribe of Benjamin * Related Bible parts: Romans 6, Ephesians 1 ==ReferencesBibliography== * * ==External links== * King James Bible - Wikisource *English Translation with Parallel Latin Vulgate *Online Bible at GospelHall.org (ESV, KJV, Darby, American Standard Version, Bible in Basic English) *Multiple bible versions at Bible Gateway (NKJV, NIV, NRSV etc.) 03 ","title":"Philippians 3"},{"id":"46309069","text":"Elachista albrechti is a moth in the family Elachistidae.

Verse 3 :And I urge you also, true companion, help these women who laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life.

Verse 4 > Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, rejoice!

Since her father, Vijayan Menon, is a film producer, Menon was exposed to filmmaking from a young age. Her father is also a founder of Tara Arts, an English cultural ambassador for South India, showcasing musicals and films. Menon says while her parents encouraged her to pursue the arts, her father advised her to look at it as a hobby. Because of this way of thinking about film, Menon did not seriously consider filmmaking as a career until she attended Columbia University, and took classes that were taught by professional filmmakers. Menon she received a BA in English and Art History from Columbia, but while she was there, she began directing films and discovered a passion for the craft. She went on to receive an MFA from the USC School of Cinematic Arts. ==Career== In 2009, Menon wrote and directed the short film Mark in Argentina, a story about a governor searching for his mistress in Argentina. However, it wasn't until Menon released her feature- length debut when she started to get a great deal of recognition from the media. Menon's first full-length feature film, Farah Goes Bang was described by Jennifer Mills as one that, \\"explores many genres: the road movie, the sexual coming of age movie, the political film, the buddy movie.\\" Menon co- wrote the film with Laura Goode, who also acted as a producer. Not only did Menon win the Nora Ephron Prize for Farah Goes Bang, but the film also won awards at the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival and CAAMFest. In 2015, Menon directed the female-driven Wall Street drama Equity. The film premiered in Competition at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival.

This was because several express trains had passed, but no local stops were made. The people on the platforms waiting for the train were angry and threatened to tear down the waiting rooms, and in response an agent was sent to the station house for assistance.

The offensive started with a rebel assault on the capital of the province, Idlib. According to The Economist, the capture of Idlib came about largely because Gulf Arab states \\"gave more backing to their proxies despite American objections.\\" ==The offensive== Battle for Idlib On 24 March 2015, the newly established Fattah Army operation room (\\"The Army of Conquest\\") assaulted Idlib city from three sides. On 27 March, the rebels managed to penetrate the city. At this point, the city was almost completely encircled by rebel groups, leaving only two exit routes for government forces. The next day, after four days of fighting, rebels captured the city and managed to besiege the towns of Kafarya and al-Fu'a. Syrian government troops regrouped south of the city, and were preparing for a possible attack by rebel forces. The battle for Idlib left at least 132 rebels, 76 soldiers and 11 civilians dead. In addition, 15 prisoners held by the state security services were executed as the Army retreated. Assault on Mastouma Between 28 and 30 March 47 people, including 15 rebels, were killed during a government bombardment of Idlib city, which reportedly included chemical weapons. On 2 April, the rebels advanced in the area of Mastouma and its military base, where most of the retreated government forces were positioned. The next day, rebels intensified their attacks on three axes and further advanced in the Mastouma area, seizing parts of Mastouma during the night. According to rebel sources, Brigadier General Emad Ibrahim was killed in the battle. On 4 April, the Tiger Forces arrived at Ariha to support the entrenched government troops in and around Mastouma. By 5 April, after a two-day battle, that was described as a ‚Äúfull-scale assault‚Äù on Mastouma, the rebel attack on the military camp and village had been repelled. The initial rebel advance into Mastouma was revealed to be a trap set up by the military, which helped them surround the opposition fighters and engage in street fighting, after which the rebels were pushed back and retreated. The army repositioned on a strategic hill that represents the first defense line for the camp. According to different sources, between 50 and 450 rebels were killed. The pro-opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported six deaths among government troops. ==Aftermath== Government counterattack On 8 April, the military, led by the special forces unit the Tiger Forces, launched a counter-attack towards the villages of Qameenas and Faylan. By 10 April, they had secured the approaches to Mastouma but halted their advance in the outskirts of the two villages after encountering stiff resistance from the rebels. Four days later, the Tiger Forces and other army units had reportedly breached the rebel defenses and entered Qameenas. According to a military source, Air Force Intelligence intercepted the communications of local Al- Nusra Front commanders who were reportedly in panic over the collapse of their defensive line. Around the same time the Air Force had carried out 51 airstrikes throughout the province. On 15 April, Army troops went on the offensive near Ariha and captured the villages of Kafr Najd and Nahlaya. The military also reached Kurin, with clashes taking place as the troops tried to take over the village. By 18 April 349 air-strikes were conducted against Idlib city and its countryside since the rebel takeover of the provincial capital on 28 March. The air campaign left hundreds of rebel fighters dead. The same day, the military captured the village of Muqablah, linking up with NDF fighters in the southeastern part of Faylan,Syrian Armed Forces Making Gains in Idlib; Muqablah Captured and by 20 April advanced to Tell Zahir Al- Mufraq hill.A Paradox of Events: Syrian Army and Islamist Forces on the Offensive in Idlib The rebels also withdrew from Kurin due to a lack of support from their main headquartersLatif Hassan 20-04-2015 and the Tiger Forces were soon in the town, but had not yet reached Tell Kurin hill to the west.

Jenevieve was the mother of performance artist Jackie Curtis. Jackie was mostly raised by Slugger Ann and was often seen visiting her at the bar. Some of Jackie's art work was inspired by the people who came to Slugger Ann's. Slugger Ann gave Candy Darling a job working as a barmaid.POPism: The Warhol Sixties accessed 4/3/2015 She got her nickname \\"Slugger Ann\\" from working as a taxi dancer in the 1920s and 1930s in New York City. If a man would attempt to grope her while she was dancing, she would swing at him. This behavior would come in handy when she opened a bar on the corner of 12th and 2nd Avenue, near St. Mark's Church in the early 1950s. She could be found everyday at the bar. She lived in an apartment behind the bar and was the superintendent for the apartments above the building. Several television shows like Naked City were filmed outside the bar. Slugger Ann was similar in appearance to Mae West, with a large frame and blond hair.Slugger Ann Still a Champ accessed 4/3/2015Slugger Ann accessed 4/3/2015Interview with Melba LaRose, Jr. accessed 4/3/2015Queer Kinship in the New York Underground accessed 4/3/2015 ==Later life and death== Slugger Ann's closed in 1980 when Ann Uglialoro died.

He was credited with shooting down as many as 19 Allied aircraft between late 1941 and when he was himself downed in October 1942. After recovering from the injuries sustained in this incident, Harada served as a flying instructor for the remainder of the war. Following the end of hostilities in 1945, Harada worked as a farmer, before founding a nursery for children in 1965 and later a kindergarten. He was an anti-war activist from 1991, and remained a prominent speaker until late in his life. ==Biography== Military service Harada was born in the village of Asajawa in Nagano Prefecture on 11 August 1916.Hata, Izawa and Shores (2011), p. 383 After completing school, he joined the Imperial Japanese Navy's naval infantry force in 1933, aged 17. He later transferred to the Navy's aviation branch, and graduated first in the 35th pilot training class in February 1937.Hata, Izawa and Shores (2011), p. 271 Harada was posted to China in October that year during the Second Sino-Japanese War, but was not involved in any aerial combat. While in China he witnessed Japanese military personnel indiscriminately killing Chinese civilians in the mistaken belief that they were soldiers in disguise. In December he took part in the strike on the which led to increased tensions with the United States.https://www.nps.gov/valr/learn/historyculture/upload/KanameHarada.pdf Harada was sent back to Japan in January 1938, and subsequently served in several training positions. At the outbreak of the Pacific War, Harada was a Mitsubishi A6M Zero pilot assigned to the aircraft carrier S≈çry≈´, which formed part of the 1st Air Fleet. In this role, he took part in the 1st Air Fleet's series of operations during the initial months of the war. On 7 December 1941, he flew protective patrols over the fleet during the Attack on Pearl Harbor, and did not see any combat. Harada also escorted the aircraft which attacked the Australian port of Darwin on 19 February 1942. During the Indian Ocean raid, he was confirmed to have shot down three British fighters over Colombo on 5 April, and claimed another two as \\"probables\\". Four days later, he downed two British Bristol Blenheim light bombers which were attempting to attack the Japanese fleet. During the Battle of Midway, Harada shot down either three or five American aircraft. He landed on the last surviving Japanese aircraft carrier, Hiry≈´, after S≈çry≈´ was sunk by United States aircraft. Harada was in the air at the time of Hiry≈´s sinking later in the battle, and was rescued by a warship after ditching into the sea. In July 1942, Harada was reassigned to the aircraft carrier Hiy≈ç. In early October of that year, the carrier departed Japan to take part in the Guadalcanal Campaign. On 17 October, Harada formed part of the escort for a force of torpedo bombers which were attempting to attack targets on Guadalcanal. American Grumman F4F Wildcats attacked this force, and while Harada probably downed a Wildcat, his aircraft was badly damaged. His plane crash-landed near the Japanese base at Rekata Bay on Santa Isabel Island, and Harada had to dig himself out from underneath the wreckage of his plane with his bare hands. Harada was later returned to Japan on board a hospital ship. One of Harada's arms was badly injured in the crash, which ended his career as a combat pilot. He subsequently served as a flying instructor, and late in the war trained Kamikaze pilots. He also said that he helped train pilots for the Mitsubishi J8M rocket plane that Japan was developing late in the war. By the end of hostilities, he held the rank of lieutenant (junior grade) and had flown for 8,000 hours. The number of aircraft Harada is credited with shooting down differs among sources; in 2011 Ikuhiko Hata, Yasuho Izawa and Christopher Shores wrote that he \\"was credited with nine confirmed victories\\", while in a 2015 New York Times article he said that he downed 19 Allied aircraft. Later life Harada in 2010 Following World War II, Harada initially worked as a dairy farmer, but suffered from nightmares in which he saw the faces of the American airmen he had downed during the war. In 1965, he founded a nursery for children with his wife after she asked him \\"if you want to atone for the lives you have taken, what better way is there than to nurture new lives?\\" The couple opened a kindergarten in 1969. He continued as a principal of the kindergarten until his retirement. In a 2013 interview with The Australian Harada said: > The first incarnation of my life was as a ruthless killer. I still live with > a sense of sin over those I killed. I chased them and shot them down‚Äîsuch a > horrible thing to do. Now, I go to the kindergarten every day and interact > with the children. I want to nurture kind and considerate hearts in all of > them. Harada also traveled to the United Kingdom and United States to meet some of the American and British airmen he had fought against, including the American ace Joe Foss who is believed to have been the pilot who shot down his plane. As part of his travels Harada visited Santa Isabel Island, where he located the wreckage of his fighter and brought a section of it back to Japan. Harada was an anti-war activist from 1991. He began giving public talks about his combat experiences and the need to avoid wars that year after overhearing young Japanese discussing the bombing which took place during the Gulf War as if it formed part of a video game. In 2015, The New York Times reported that Harada, aged 98, was a \\"highly sought-after public speaker\\", who was motivated by a desire to pass on his experiences as a warning to the current generations of Japanese who he believed were unaware of the nature of warfare. He opposed efforts by conservative members of the Japanese government to change the country's pacifist constitution, saying that \\"these politicians were born after the war, and so they don‚Äôt understand it must be avoided at all costs. In this respect, they are like our prewar leaders\\". A documentary named Each and Every Battlefield covering Harada's life was released in Japan in March 2015. Harada died in Nagano on 3 May 2016. He was believed to have been the last surviving Japanese combat pilot who had taken part in the attack on Pearl Harbor. ==References== Citations Works consulted * Category:1916 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Japanese naval aviators Category:Japanese World War II flying aces Category:People from Nagano Prefecture Category:Japanese anti-war activists Category:Shot-down aviators Category:Japanese farmers Category:Japanese educators Category:Imperial Japanese Navy officers ","title":"Kaname Harada"},{"id":"46309696","text":"Osias Tager (21 June 1914 ‚Äì 26 March 2005) was a British businessman who was one of the founders of the Ravenswood community, a residential community for adults with learning difficulties. ==Early life and family== Tager was born in Hannover, German Empire.

Calling it the act's least enjoyable record so far, Allmusic journalist Tim Sendra felt that the album's departure from a less punk-influenced style to a more polished and mainstream sound caused it to lose the crazy energy and spirit that heavily contributed to the quality of their past releases. Jon Dolan, a critic for Rolling Stone, gave it a similar rating, writing \\"their all-smiles assault can be adorable, at least in moderate doses.

It was found in South Africa in the 1920s, and was cut in Amsterdam. The Nazis seized the diamond during World War II. It was rediscovered after the war, and changed owners multiple times before it was bought in 2007 by the Kazanjian Brothers. ==Description== The Kazanjian Red Diamond is a 5.05-carat emerald-cut red diamond. Red diamonds are the rarest type of colored diamond. The diamond measures on the sides, and in depth. It is the second-largest red diamond ever found, behind only the 5.11-carat Moussaieff Red Diamond. ==History== In the mid-1920s (possibly 1927), during a diamond rush in South Africa, a 35-carat piece of boart was found in Lichtenberg. The boart was sent to Goudvis Brothers, a firm in Amsterdam. There was initial disagreement over whether the boart was of any worth. Seven months were spent polishing and examining the stone, and the final 5.05-carat emerald-cut diamond was completed. It was said that the diamond had the appearance of \\"a drop of blood\\" when held near a candle. Tiffany & Co. offered $100,000 for the diamond, but the Goudvis Brothers declined the offer, because they wanted $150,000. When World War II began, it was locked in a safe in Arnhem. In 1944, however, the Nazis, who occupied the Netherlands, confiscated the diamond. It was then taken to Germany and placed in a salt mine in Berchtesgaden, near a retreat belonging to Adolf Hitler. The Nazis had also hidden some other stolen items in the mine. After the war ended, Joseph McNarney, an American general, found the diamond and thought it was a ruby. After it was discovered that the stone was not a ruby, it was returned to the Goudvis Brothers' estate, which was in debt as a result of the war. The diamond was sold for 57,000 guilders to George Prins, a broker. Sir Ernest Oppenheimer bought the diamond, and later sold it to the Royal Asscher Diamond Company. It was then purchased by a private collector. In February 2007, upon identifying the diamond, the Kazanjian Brothers, a jewelry company in Beverly Hills, purchased the diamond from a woman in East Asia. The diamond, which was previously known as the \\"Red Diamond\\", was then named the \\"Kazanjian Red Diamond\\". The diamond is now displayed around the world to raise funds for charity efforts. ==References== Category:Diamonds originating in South Africa Category:Red diamonds Category:Individual diamonds ","title":"Kazanjian Red Diamond"},{"id":"46309818","text":"715 Naval Air Squadron (715 NAS) was a Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm. ==References== Citations Bibliography * Category:700 series Fleet Air Arm squadrons Category:Military units and formations established in 1936 Category:Military units and formations of the Royal Navy in World War II Category:1936 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"715 Naval Air Squadron"},{"id":"46309854","text":"716 Naval Air Squadron (716 NAS) was a Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm. ==References== Citations Bibliography * Category:700 series Fleet Air Arm squadrons Category:Military units and formations established in 1936 Category:Military units and formations of the Royal Navy in World War II ","title":"716 Naval Air Squadron"},{"id":"46309867","text":"717 Naval Air Squadron (717 NAS) was a Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm. ==References== Citations Bibliography * Category:700 series Fleet Air Arm squadrons Category:Military units and formations established in 1944 Category:Military units and formations of the Royal Navy in World War II ","title":"717 Naval Air Squadron"},{"id":"46309885","text":"718 Naval Air Squadron (718 NAS) was a Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm. ==References== Citations Bibliography * Category:700 series Fleet Air Arm squadrons Category:Military units and formations established in 1936 Category:Military units and formations of the Royal Navy in World War II ","title":"718 Naval Air Squadron"},{"id":"46309887","text":"Camillo Wiethe (24 May 1889, Vienna - 10 July 1949, Vienna) was an Austrian otorhinolaryngologist.

His greatest achievement with the club was being awarded the golden ball trophy in 1976 which recognized the best player of the season. His first managerial job was with the Toronto Blizzard of the original Canadian Soccer League where he served as an assistant coach. His first head coach position was with the Scarborough Astros of the Canadian National Soccer League in 1993. His greatest achievement with Scarborough was reaching the Ontario cup finals, which ended in a 3-0 defeat in penalty shootout to the St. Catharines Wolves. In 1998, The Astros relocated to North York and joined the newly formed Canadian Professional Soccer League. In their first season in the CPSL the club finished fourth overall in the standings and reached the semi-finals, but were defeated by the Toronto Olympians. He coached the Woodbridge Strikers and won the Ontario Soccer League. Armua returned to the CPSL in 2004 to coach the Hamilton Thunder.

It grows to a large, dense shrub with broombrush foliage and profuse pale yellow flowers in late spring. == Description == Melaleuca hamata is a large shrub, sometimes a small tree growing to a height of , with flaking papery bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately, upward-pointing and needle-like, up to long and in diameter and with a sharp tip which is often hooked. The flowers are a shade of yellow, through cream to white. They are in almost spherical heads in many of the upper leaf axils, each head about in diameter and containing 5 to 15 groups of flowers in threes. The petals are long and often fall off as soon as the flower opens. The stamens, which give the flowers their colour, are arranged in five bundles around the flower with 3 to 8 stamens per bundle. Flowering occurs through spring and early summer and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules forming oval-shaped clusters up to in diameter.

The U.S. Weather Bureau established an office in the Sonna Building on December 1, 1898. Since then, the U.S Weather Bureau office, now known as the National Weather Service forecast office gained forecast responsibility of Southern Idaho on June 22, 1970 which was expanded to the entire state of Idaho in 1973. After modernization in 1993, the forecast responsibility was changed to Southeast Oregon and Southwest Idaho. The current office in Boise maintains a WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar system, 8 Automated airport weather station (ASOS) systems and Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) that greatly improve forecasting in the region. Continuous weather observations have been maintained for the city of Boise since February 1, 1864 about 5 months after the U.S. Army established Fort Boise. The post surgeon for the U.S. Army took observations until July 1, 1877 when the U.S. Signal Service, established an office downtown. The Signal Office was discontinued on July 1, 1890. ==History== Observations at Fort Boise (1864‚Äì1898) Weather Instruments next to the Post Hospital at Fort Boise circa 1890s. The first meteorological observations of high and low temperature and daily precipitation began at Fort Boise's Post Hospital on February 1, 1864 about 7 months after the fort was established by Major Pinkney Lugenbeel. Doctor Adam H. Cochrane, born in Paisley, Scotland, was the first post surgeon at the Fort and is believed to have taken the first weather observation. The observations were taken 3 times a day, 7 A.M., 2 P.M., and 7 P.M., at the post hospital built in 1863. Though the thermometers were sheltered, self registering thermometers were not installed until January 1872. Post surgeons and hospital stewards took continuous daily weather observations through November 30, 1898. The post surgeon was required to take weather observations as it was believed there was a possible link between human disease and weather. This prompted the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army, Doctor James Tilton to order U.S. Army senior medical officers on 2 May 1814 to ‚Äúkeep a diary of the weather‚Äù at each military station. The Fort was later renamed the Boise Barracks. U.S. Army‚Äôs Signal Service Office (1877‚Äì1890) Former Idaho Territory Governor and former U.S. House of Representative Thomas W. Bennett made an application to the U.S. Army's Signal Service to establish stations at Boise on February 9, 1876. On May 21, 1877, the application was granted and Sergeant Barnet E. Light was order per S. O. No. 62 to establish a station by July 1877. On June 22, 1877, the station was established on the second floor of the Overland Hotel on the northwest corner of 8th and Main Street. Weather observations began at the station on July 1, 1977. The station was moved to a third story addition to the Hotel shortly after Hosea Eastman bought it in 1878. The station was moved twice, next door to the Davis building in September 1880 and the Perrault Building on the southeast corner of Capital and Main Streets in January 1888. The weather instruments were on the roof except for the thermometers which were in a window shelter from 1877 to 1885. The thermometers placed in a Cotton region shelter on December 1, 1885. A lack of funding and Chief Signal Officer Adolphus Greely opening of a new station in Baker City, Oregon lead to the closure of the Boise station on June 30, 1890. Greenly felt the Baker City Station would be more valuable than the Boise station which was not supported by his forecasters in Washington. Barnet Light, James Kenealy, Henry Boynton and William Korts were the only four observers during the stations 13 years in Boise. U.S. Weather Bureau in Downtown Boise (1898‚Äì1939) George L. Shoup, the first Governor and Senator of Idaho, began discussing with the Chief of the U.S. Weather Bureau Willis L. Moore on establishing an office in Boise, Idaho in 1897. Both Chief Moore and the Secretary of Agriculture James Wilson supported the establishment of an office in Boise, Idaho which was added to the budget. The office was scheduled to be open in August 1898 but was delayed due to the U.S. Weather Bureau's expansion into the West Indies. On 29 September 1898, the Chief Moore sent the following order: ‚ÄúMr. Samuel M. Blandford will proceed from Salt Lake City, Utah to Boise, Idaho, to establish and assume charge of a Weather Bureau station at the latter point.‚Äù The U.S. Weather Bureau instruments on the U.S. Federal Building roof in downton Boise. Samuel Blandford was an experienced meteorologist and lawyer who worked at several Weather Bureau offices across the United States mostly in the west. He began his career with the U.S. Signal Service and worked at the station in New York City during the Great Blizzard of 1888 which he believed eventually gave him tuberculosis. He was the nephew of Dr. Samuel Mudd. The office was opened on the third floor of the Sonna Building on the corner of 9th and Main Street on December 1, 1898. Blandford had two assistants, John C. Dabney and Charles C. Garrett who help take observation and post the forecasts. The office moved to the fourth floor of the U.S. Federal Building now known as the U.S. Public Building on March 16, 1905. The building was expanded in the late 1920s and the U.S. Weather Bureau moved to the fourth floor of the new annex on November 13, 1930. In additions to the regular surface observations of temperature, precipitation and wind, the office started taking PIBAL observations from the roof of the building. A U.S. Weather Bureau Airport Station was established at the downtown Boise Airport, now the campus of Boise State University, on May 11, 1933 which is only about a 1-mile south of the U.S. Federal Building. Weather observations had been taken from the airport by the Bureau of Air Commerce personal since October 18, 1931. From July 1, 1939 to December 18, 1939, while the U.S. Weather Bureau office was moved to the airport at Gowen Field, official weather observations and one PIBAL flight a day were taken at the old airport.

The U.S. Weather Bureau office was moved to 2nd floor of the original Boise Air Terminal Building at Gowen Field on December 19, 1939. All operations at the U.S. Federal building and the old Boise Airport were transferred to the new office by February 20, 1940. In addition to the surface weather observations of temperature, precipitation and wind, Radiosonde observations which began September 1, 1939 at the downtown airport, were moved to a small building north of the Boise terminal building at Gowen Field in 1940. A new balloon inflation building was built east of the terminal in October 1954 with a dome on top to hold the signal receiving equipment. The building was moved to the NIFC campus in August 1969 where it is still being used today. The temperatures and precipitation were taken near the airport terminal building through 1969 though they were moved periodically to accommodate the growing airport. The wind instrument was moved several times through 1969 from the top of the United Hangar to the top of the terminal building to field northwest of the runway. The office remained on the 2nd floor of the terminal building until June 1969.

The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), was created in 1965 as a way for the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the U.S. Weather Bureau to work together, reduce the duplication of services, and coordinate national fire planning and operations. The U.S. Weather Bureau office was moved to the second floor of the old administration building on June 5, 1969. The U.S. Weather Bureau made the Boise office its ‚Äúhub of fire weather activities‚Äù in the west where fire weather specialists are able to make face to face contact with the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management fire dispatchers. U.S. Congress approved the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) requested for $316,000 in additional funds in the fiscal year 1970 budget in July 1969 for the Boise, Idaho, Indianapolis, Indiana, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and for bringing Oklahoma City, Oklahoma up to full Weather Service Forecast Office (WSFO) status. On June 22, 1970, the Boise Forecast Office began issuing official weather forecasts for Idaho south of the Salmon River. The U.S. Weather Bureau changed their name to the National Weather Service on October 1, 1970. The Boise office, which was already a forecast office for the state of Idaho, and Pocatello, Idaho were selected for modernization in the state of Idaho in early 1990s. On May 20, 1992, the National Weather Service broke ground on the first weather service specific building in Idaho. Construction on the building was completed on June 24, 1993 and the office was officially opened on July 21, 1993. As part of the modernization plan, new weather forecast offices were built, computer systems upgraded and weather radars were be installed across the country. The first weather radar in Idaho, WSR-88D, was installed in Boise, just south of the airport, on September 23, 1993 and officially commissioned on January 11, 1995. This was the 47th Doppler radar installed in a new national network known as \\"NEXRAD\\". Idaho has two Doppler radars, one in Boise, Idaho (KCBX) and Pocatello, Idaho (KSFX). The National Weather Service continues to operate from this building today. ==Former Weather Service Stations in the area== U.S. Weather Bureau Airways Station at the Baker City Airport on March 6, 1944. The U.S. Weather Bureau operated four airway stations, at Burns, Oregon, Baker City, Oregon, Ontario, Oregon and Weiser, Idaho in the 1930s and 1940s. The Burns station became a U.S. Weather Bureau Airways station on December 13, 1930 and later a U.S. Weather Bureau office on September 1, 1940. Observations continued in the city until February 15, 1980 when the office was moved to the Burns Airport. The office was closed after the Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) was installed on July 1, 1995. The U.S. Signal Service closed the station in Boise, Idaho to establish a station in Baker city, Oregon on July 10, 1889 which remained in operation until May 14, 1953. The U.S. Weather Bureau opened an Airways station at the Baker City Airport north of the city on March 29, 1939 which was closed on February 10, 1949. Observations were continued by the FAA until the ASOS system was installed in October 2001. A U.S. Weather Bureau Airways Station was established at Weiser Airport on July 4, 1932 but was moved to the Ontario Municipal Airport on October 25, 1938. The airways station in Ontario was only in operation until December 4, 1946. Observations were continued at the airport by the airlines until the ASOS system installed in April 1997. U.S Weather Bureau opened an Agricultural Service Office east of Twin Falls, Idaho in Kimberly, Idaho on April 19, 1962. The National Weather Service made it a Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) station for the USDA Agricultural Service on May 1, 1996. An ASOS station was installed at the Magic Valley Regional Airport south of Twin Falls, Idaho on January 28, 1997. ==Operations== WFO Boise operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and provides weather forecasts, warnings, aviation forecast and local statements for Southeast Oregon and Southwest Idaho. There is one WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar upgraded to dual polarization on August 30, 2012 improving the accuracy and identification of precipitation types and precipitation estimates. The office is also equipped with an Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS II) that greatly increases monitoring capabilities of weather, satellite, and computer model data by forecasters. The office also maintains eight Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) around the area. NWS Boise employs 18 meteorologist of which two are dedicated Fire Weather Forecasters and Incident Meteorologists and one hydrologist. There are also 7 support staff members that provide technical, administrative and IT support. Area of Responsibility The National Weather Service Boise, Idaho provides weather forecasts, warnings and local statements for 3 counties in Southeast Oregon and 14 counties in Southwest and South central Idaho. =Oregon Counties= *Baker *Harney *Malheur =Idaho Counties= *Ada *Adams *Boise *Camas *Canyon *Elmore *Gem *Gooding *Jerome *Owyhee *Payette *Twin Falls *Valley *Washington Aviation Forecasts The Boise Office issues aviation forecasts for the following seven regional airports: *Boise Airport *Caldwell Industrial Airport *Magic Valley Regional Airport *Jerome County Airport *McCall Municipal Airport *Baker City Municipal Airport *Burns Municipal Airport.

(Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), revolving around the character of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they deal with an amnesiac Lady Sif and revelations about the Kree and Inhumans. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The episode was written by Drew Z. Greenberg, and directed by Roxann Dawson. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Nick Blood, and Adrianne Palicki. Special guest star Jaimie Alexander portrays Sif, also reprising her role from the film series. \\"Who You Really Are\\" originally aired on ABC on March 10, 2015, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was watched by 3.80 million viewers. == Plot == In Faro, south Portugal, an amnesiac Lady Sif emerges from the ocean looking for Kava. S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Phil Coulson has asked Lance Hunter to become part of the S.H.I.E.L.D. team permanently. His ex-wife, Agent Bobbi Morse, who he has been getting close to again, ponders what this will mean, as she is sharing a secret with Agent Mack, who has been asked to take on missions in the field. The two of them discuss bringing Hunter into the loop, but Mack shuts down any chance of that happening and advises Bobbi to push Hunter away, which she does. S.H.I.E.L.D. travel to Portugal and try to work with Sif to find out what she was doing on Earth, rather than Asgard. Through social media they discover footage of Sif fighting a surprisingly strong man whose weapon removed her memories. Sif had managed to damage the technology that he was wearing, which was fuelled by nitrogen. Morse and Agent Skye track the man to the local hospital‚Äôs nitrogen supply. He is using the technology to hide his blue skin ‚Äì he is a Kree. In the ensuing fight, Morse is thrown across the room, while Skye loses control of her new and secret earthquake-powers, allowing the Kree to escape. Sif remembers that Kava means ‚Äúkeys‚Äù, which leads S.H.I.E.L.D. to the romanic City of Chaves (English: Keys), in the north of Portugal, where Daniel Whitehall found the Obelisk, or the Diviner (which gave Skye her abilities) during the dictatorial regime sympathetic to the Nazi ideology Estado Novo. There, they capture the Kree and confiscate the crate he had dug up. The Kree, named Vin-Tak, cooperates by restoring Sif‚Äôs memory and explaining his mission on Earth: he had learnt that Terrigenesis, the transformation of a human with special genetic material into a Kree war-slave, had recently taken place on Earth, and had come to put down the \\"abomination\\" and destroy the Diviners remaining on the planet. Panicking, Skye once again loses control, and everyone realises that she has been changed. Vin-Tak wants to kill her, while Sif wants to take her to Asgard for the safety of the human race, but Morse stops the former, removing his memory with his device, and Coulson convinces Sif to leave Skye be. Skye, unable to stop the shaking, uses a tranquilizer on herself, and when she wakes up, moves into the vibranium- laced cage away from the other agents, who fear her new abilities. Sif returns Vin-Tak to his homeworld of Hala and promises that the Kree will no longer be an issue for Earth, though she warns Coulson that Skye may be even more dangerous than he thinks. In an end tag, Hunter confronts Mack about him and Morse, forcing Mack to knock Hunter unconscious. == Production ==  Development  In February 2015, Marvel announced that the twelfth episode of the season would be titled \\"Who You Really Are\\", to be written by Drew Z. Greenberg, with Roxann Dawson directing.  Writing  Concerning Simmons' apparent anger at learning that Skye has gained new abilities due to her exposure to alien materials, executive producer Jeffrey Bell explained that \\"The way everyone reacts to the situation is different, and different types of concern and different types of fear, and different types of determination...and I think all of our characters are reacting in very different ways to that, which is the whole point of doing it. When one of your best friends comes out as a superhero, how do you react to that? And just trying to find out, ‚ÄúOh, my friend changed, they‚Äôre different, and how do I feel about that? And this is cool, but it‚Äôs scary, and I don‚Äôt know how I feel about that. And it‚Äôs wonderful, and why can‚Äôt I have that? Or, I don‚Äôt want that. Or, does Skye want that?‚Äù It just, to me, captures a whole bunch of questions, which is what we try to do.\\" On the title of the episode, Bell said \\"I think for all of us, ‚Äúwho you really are‚Äù is revealed in these kind of situations. Which side are you on, how do you feel about that, who do you stand with, how do you feel about that? So very much on point with that is Lady Sif, and one of the things on point with that is Skye, but one of the things that I think is nice about that title is it also reflects on the rest of the team as well.\\"  Casting  In February 2015, Marvel revealed that main cast members Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Nick Blood, and Adrianne Palicki would star as Phil Coulson, Melinda May, Skye, Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons, Lance Hunter, and Bobbi Morse, respectively. It was also revealed that the guest cast for the episode would include Henry Simmons as Alphonso \\"Mack\\" Mackenzie, Jaimie Alexander as Lady Sif, Eddie McClintock as Vin-Tak, Alexandra Manea as nurse, Lidia Porto as head nurse, Danny Lopes as Bruno, Ben Griesse as Tiago, Ruben Rabasa as Mr. Cardozo and Markell Andrew as officer Carvalho. Manea, Porto, Lopes, Griesse, Rabasa, and Andrew did not receive guest star credit in the episode. Simmons and Alexander reprise their roles from earlier in the series. Main cast member Brett Dalton, who portrays Grant Ward in the series, does not appear in the episode. On returning to the series after a similar single-episode guest appearance in the first season, Alexander said \\"This definitely came out of the blue. It was a last minute thing. They called up and said, ‚ÄúHey, would you like to come back on S.H.I.E.L.D.? We need you for something very specific.‚Äù And I said ... ‚ÄúYou know what? If this makes sense for my character in the film, then I‚Äôm going to say yes to this.‚Äù  Marvel Cinematic Universe tie- ins  When Coulson and Mack are taking inventory at the start of the episode, Coulson mentions that they get equipment from Stark Industries via Maria Hill, the former a major company from the Iron Man films, the latter a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who began working for Stark at the end of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The character of Vin-Tak is the first living Kree to appear on the series, after a Kree corpse was seen in the episode \\"T.A.H.I.T.I.\\" The species plays a significant role in the film Guardians of the Galaxy, where the idea of more peaceful members of the race, like Vin-Tak, was established. == Release ==  Broadcast  \\"Who You Really Are\\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on March 10, 2015.  Marketing  For the final twelve episodes of the season Marvel once again ran the \\"Art of...\\" initiative, in which an image was released the Thursday before the episode aired, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode, with the season's title being \\"The Art of Evolution\\". The different artists were once again chosen to create the teaser posters, based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode. For \\"Who You Really Are\\", the producers enlisted Marcos Mart√≠n to create the poster, which highlighted Sif's return to the show, as well as an \\"inside look\\" at S.H.I.E.L.D. as the logo crumbles, with Skye in the center of it, ambiguously leaving the viewer questioning if the logo was crumbling due to Sif's sword, or Skye's powers.  Home media  The episode began streaming on Netflix on June 11, 2015, and was released along with the rest of the second season on September 18, 2015, on Blu-ray and DVD. == Reception ==  Ratings  In the United States the episode received a 1.5/4 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 1.5 percent of all households, and 4 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was watched by 3.80 million viewers. == References  External links == *\\"Who You Really Are\\" at ABC * * Category:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Director Phil Coulson and new agent Lance Hunter travel to \\"The Retreat\\", a safe house where Coulson had left Agent Skye after she developed earthquake abilities. They see through surveillance footage that Skye had accidentally brought down a section of the forest when confronted by agents Bobbi Morse and Tomas Calderon, part of a faction of S.H.I.E.L.D. who do not follow Coulson, and are wary of the danger super-powered individuals possess. Calderon was seriously injured during the incident, and Skye had been promptly taken by a teleporting, eyeless man named Gordon. Agent Robert Gonzales, another high- ranking member of the other S.H.I.E.L.D. faction, believes that Coulson may be amassing gifted people, but to make sure he needs the \\"toolbox\\" to be opened, something that Coulson had previously refused to do. Agent Leo Fitz also refuses, as he is loyal to Coulson, but Agent Jemma Simmons is convinced by Morse that uncovering any dangerous secrets is the only way to safeguard S.H.I.E.L.D., and return everything to \\"normal\\". Simmons begins working at opening the toolbox herself. Skye awakens in a mountain hideaway with Chinese decor called Afterlife, which is a place where people like her are brought to be safe, and to be chosen/prepared for the transformation. As explained to her by Lincoln Campbell, her transitioner, she is a unique case in that she was transformed without being chosen or prepared, and that she did it in a Kree temple with a Diviner, rather than in the controlled environment and under the elders instruction. To her dismay, Campbell informs her that the transformation is irreversible, but he is confident that she can learn to master her abilities, as he once did ‚Äì he can electrically charge anything, which first caused him to almost burn down Afterlife, but now allows him to do many things, including levitate objects. Skye asks Gordon to get a message to S.H.I.E.L.D., to let them know that she is alright, but he explains that he can‚Äôt do anything without permission from the elders first. Gordon then visits Skye‚Äôs father, Cal, who they have imprisoned. The two of them get into a fight when Gordon refuses to let Cal see Skye, but shortly after, Gordon brings Cal‚Äôs wife, Jiaying, who reiterates that he cannot see their daughter. Cal is too unpredictable and lacks discipline. Coulson lures Gonzales‚Äôs troops to \\"The Retreat\\", where he and Hunter attempt to steal their quinjet, but are outnumbered and captured. However, reinforcements arrive in the form of Agent Mike Peterson, a man turned into a super-powered cyborg by Hydra, who takes out the rival S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. This convinces Gonzales that Coulson is dangerous and needs to be taken down, but he wants him to be fairly represented on their S.H.I.E.L.D. board when he is brought in, so Gonzales offers Agent Melinda May a position on the board. When Fitz discovers that Simmons is helping them open the toolbox, the two argue about it, and Fitz decides to leave S.H.I.E.L.D. Coulson explains to Hunter that Peterson has been tracking Hydra scientist Dr. List for S.H.I.E.L.D., and has learned that they have interests in super-powered people like Skye. Coulson announces that in order to move forward they will need to work with the traitor Grant Ward. Skye learns that Raina, the former Hydra operative who transformed alongside Skye, is in Afterlife as well, and confronts her, attempting to kill her. This is stopped by Jiaying, who offers to be her guide and help her master her abilities, if she chooses to stay, though she does not reveal that she is Skye‚Äôs mother. In an end tag, Simmons tells Morse and Mack that she is unable to open the toolbox without Coulson, but in reality she has given the real toolbox to Fitz, who is working with her against those not loyal to Coulson. ==Production== Development In March 2015, Marvel announced that the sixteenth episode of the season would be titled \\"Afterlife\\", to be written by Craig Titley, with Kevin Hooks directing. Writing Concerning the introduction of Luke Mitchell as the Inhuman Lincoln Campbell, executive producer Jeffrey Bell stated that \\"Meeting Luke‚Äôs character in the Inhuman world is just setting up a new dynamic. We‚Äôre taking [Skye] into a group with a whole bunch of different people. So far, we‚Äôve seen that there‚Äôs a guy with no eyes, and there‚Äôs a woman who now is covered in thorns. And as in the X-Men world, there are a handful of people who look more like them, but a lot of them turn out to be just attractive people with powers. And we thought, ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs have some of those as well!‚Äù We were looking for a new character to come on, and Luke just really impressed us.

Recurring guest stars Kyle MacLachlan and Dichen Lachman portray Skye's parents, while series regulars Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Nick Blood, and Adrianne Palicki also star. This episode reveals May's history, which had been teased since the beginning of the series, and which not even Wen had known about before reading the episode's script.

The encounter backfires when Eva and some local gangsters take a S.H.I.E.L.D. team and several locals hostage, and May enters the building they are using to rescue the hostages. She finds them acting out of character, and they attack her, but she defeats them and kills Eva in a fight, before discovering her young daughter, Katya, is the real threat, having taken control of the hostages to feed on their pain. When Katya kills the Bahrainis she is controlling, May is forced to fatally shoot her. S.H.I.E.L.D. assume Eva was the threat and Katya was caught in the crossfire, and May is lauded for saving the S.H.I.E.L.D. team single-handedly and given the nickname 'the Cavalry'. However she is deeply traumatized, and retires from field duty to move to an administrative role. Her marriage to Andrew also suffers, eventually leading to divorce. In the present May, now in command of the Playground, is shocked to learn that Coulson has been moving alarming amounts of assets and manpower across the world as part of a secret project, 'Theta Protocol', and has been meeting with Andrew in secret. Theta Protocol is the main reason Gonzales' faction instigated their coup, fearing Coulson is building a secret army of superhumans. Determined to find the truth, May orders Simmons to open the toolbox, unaware Simmons has secretly duplicated it so Fitz could take the real one to Coulson. At Afterlife, Gordon tries to help Raina adapt to her new form, and she mentions to Lincoln that she has been having nightmares about Skye and Cal. During training to focus her abilities to manipulate objects' natural frequencies, Skye mentions that she does not know when she was born. Jiaying becomes upset and tells her that she was born on July 2, 1988, revealing herself as Skye's mother and explaining that after she was mutilated by Whitehall, her body was repaired by Cal and her own healing abilities resurrected her. She convinces Skye to keep their connection secret, as the rules dictate that the child of an active Inhuman should not undergo Terrigenesis, and reveals to her that Eva and Katya were Inhumans, and that Eva disobeyed this rule and stole Terrigen crystals to bring about Katya's Terrigenesis, which drove her insane. Jiaying convinces Skye to visit Cal, and the family surprisingly enjoy their evening together, but Lincoln witnesses them together and realizes Raina's nightmares may be prophetic visions.

This is the May before this incident happened. And so there are qualities that Ming[-Na Wen] brings to the role.

On balancing this backstory with the series' present day story, and integrating the two, Bell said \\"We have a backstory, but the backstory needs to be compelling enough so that you don‚Äôt mind it being a backstory, so that when you come back to the present story, you‚Äôre equally interested. Anytime you‚Äôre telling two or three stories, you‚Äôre always worried about one being more interesting than the other. And I think this episode does a very nice job in that you‚Äôre happy to be in any of them.\\"  Casting  In March 2015, Marvel revealed that main cast members Clark Gregg, Wen, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Nick Blood, and Adrianne Palicki would star as Phil Coulson, Melinda May, Skye, Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons, Lance Hunter, and Bobbi Morse, respectively. It was also revealed that the guest cast for the episode would include Henry Simmons as Alphonso ‚ÄúMack‚Äù Mackenzie, Ruth Negga as Raina, Kyle MacLachlan as Calvin Zabo, Jamie Harris as Gordon, Christine Adams as Weaver, Blair Underwood as Andrew Garner, Dichen Lachman as Jiaying, Luke Mitchell as Lincoln Campbell, Kris Lemche as Ethan, Terrell Tilford as Agent Hart, Derek Phillips as Agent O‚ÄôBrien, Winter Ave Zoli as Eva Belyakov, Ava Acres as Little Girl/Katya, Brendan Wayne as Assistant, Ben Wise as Blue Jacket, Omid Zader as Burly Gangster, Hani Al Naimi as Fiasal El-Hashem, Houshang Touzie as Colonel, Branden Morgan as Tac Agent #1, Alex Paez as Tac Agent #2, and Antonio Leon as Bahranian Soldier. Acres, Wayne, Wise, Zader, Al Naimi, Touzie, Morgan, Paez, and Leon did not receive guest star credit in the episode. Simmons, Negga, MacLachlan, Harris, Adams, Underwood, Lachman, and Mitchell reprise their roles from earlier in the series. Main cast member Brett Dalton, who portrays Grant Ward in the series, does not appear in the episode. Wen explained the differences in portraying the younger, pre-incident May in flashbacks, saying \\"we got to part her hair in the middle with a little bit of fluff. We were trying to find a subtle way to distinguish her from the May that has been established besides her personality, which was still very much May, in that she‚Äôs not this outgoing, boisterous clown and then turned into this diehard killing machine. She always had a scary side to her, but at the same time there was a lightness, and a lot of love, and she was able to show her sexiness with Andrew, and her playfulness with Coulson in her earlier part of her life, before this event happened. ... It brought a little bit of Ming into May\\". == Release ==  Broadcast  \\"Melinda\\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on April 14, 2015.  Marketing  For the final twelve episodes of the season Marvel once again ran the \\"Art of...\\" initiative, in which an image was released the Thursday before the episode aired, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode, with the season's title being \\"The Art of Evolution\\". The different artists were once again chosen to create the teaser posters, based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode. \\"Melinda\\"s poster, by Jenny Frison, mirrored the focus of the episode by prominently featuring an image of May, highlighting her backstory and why she is called \\"the Cavalry\\".  Home media  The episode began streaming on Netflix on June 11, 2015, and will be released along with the rest of the second season on September 18, 2015, on Blu-ray and DVD. == Reception ==  Ratings  In the United States the episode received a 1.6/5 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 1.6 percent of all households, and 5 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was watched by 4.04 million viewers.  Accolades  Wen was named TVLines \\"Performer of the Week\\" for the week of April 12, 2015, for her performance in this episode, specifically her portrayal of May in the flashback sequences. == References  External links == *\\"Melinda\\" at ABC * * Category:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

He is the only member of his immediate family born in the United States. As a child, he lived with his family in Ireland, England, Peru, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Following the divorce of his parents, he settled in Cape Cod, graduating from Sandwich High School in 1982. He entered Salve Regina University in Rhode Island in 1982, then transferred the following year to double major in computer science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and philosophy at the College of the Holy Cross. He was very culturally and politically active in college, editing literary and science magazines, organizing poetry readings, founding a chapter of Student Pugwash USA, working for the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group and participating in numerous political rallies and teach-ins opposing U.S. intervention in Nicaragua and advocating global nuclear disarmament. He received a BA in Philosophy from College of the Holy Cross in 1987 and went on to study natural language processing as a fellow at Stanford University's Center for the Study of Language and Information and math at Columbia University. He backpacked in national parks and wilderness areas throughout Canada, the United States and Mexico for two years, funding his travels by working as a cook in Missoula, Montana. It was during these years that he first became an environmental activist, working with Earth First! groups in Montana, New Mexico and Arizona. In 1989 Suckling entered a PhD program in philosophy at Stony Brook University. His area of concentration was phenomenology, hermeneutics, deconstruction, anthropology and religion. He taught Introduction to World Religions and Introduction to Eastern Religions to undergraduates in the Religious Studies Department. In 1990, he began work on a Doctoral Dissertation on the relationship between the extinction of species, languages and cultures. During the summers, Suckling worked as a Mexican spotted owl and northern goshawk surveyor on National Forests and Native American reservation lands in New Mexico and Arizona. He started the Center for Biological Diversity in Reserve, NM, with Earth First!, owl surveying and native lands protection friends in 1989. He moved west permanently in 1992 (to Reserve) to work full time on endangered species and public land protection.

It is approximately long and flows through Ransom Township and Scranton. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek is considered to be a Coldwater Fishery. Some reaches of it have been channelized for flood control purposes and it also flows through several pipes. Its gradient is considerably higher in its upper reaches than in its lower reaches. Land uses in the creek's watershed include forests and low- intensity development. ==Course== Lindy Creek begins in a pond on Bald Mountain in Ransom Township, not far from the border between Ransom Township and Newton Township. The creek flows south down the mountain for several tenths of a mile before turning southeast and continuing to flow down the mountain. After several tenths of a mile, it enters Scranton and crosses Interstate 476. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, the creek reaches its confluence with Keyser Creek. Lindy Creek joins Keyser Creek upstream of its mouth. ==Hydrology== At its mouth, the peak annual discharge of Lindy Creek has a 10 percent chance of reaching 310 cubic feet per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching 420 cubic feet per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching 460 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 540 cubic feet per second. In 2006, the Turnpike Commission either applied for or received a permit to discharge stormwater into Lindy Creek for construction purposes. In the mid 20th century, the United States Bureau of Mines estimated the surface seepage in the area of Lindy Creek to be 2.60 gallons per minute per inch of rainfall. ==Geography, geology, and climate== The elevation near the mouth of Lindy Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. From its headwaters on West Mountain/Bald Mountain down, into the valley of Keyser Creek, the gradient of Lindy Creek is on the order of . However, in its lower reaches, its gradient is only on the order of . There is an ice pond dam site along Lindy Creek. Additionally, other historic stone and concrete structures are present in the vicinity of the creek. Its headwaters are in springs and wetlands on Bald Mountain/West Mountain. This mountain is part of the Allegheny Front and has an elevation of above sea level. Approximately of the creek has been reinforced with rectangular concrete channels. However, in some reaches, such as the section near Frink Street, its banks are natural. The creek has steep streambanks with a height of . Two debris basins in the creek's watershed help reduce flooding. Lindy Creek has been affected by abandoned mine impacts. Upstream of the flood control works near Frink Street, it has been moderate impacted by coal mining. Its channel also receives some residential trash. The creek flows through three pipes, whose diameters range from . Breached dams and the remains of old water works occur in the creek's vicinity. In early May 2013, the temperature in the vicinity of Lindy Creek was measured to be . ==Watershed== The watershed of Lindy Creek has an area of . The watershed is mostly in Scranton and Ransom Township, but also occupies a tiny corner of Newton Township. It is in the southwestern part of the Lackawanna River watershed. The creek is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Scranton. Lindy Creek is a first-order tributary of Keyser Creek. The part of the watershed that is on West Mountain/Bald Mountain is mostly undeveloped and extensively forested. However, low-density residential land is present in the watershed and some future development on the creek in Ransom Township is possible. Major roads and bridges in the watershed include South Keyser Avenue, Frink Street, and the Dewey Avenue Bridge. ==History== Lindy Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1199043. On March 12, 1936, Lindy Creek ran high in its channel during a major flood of the Lackawanna River, but did not overflow its banks. Several other creeks in that area were in a similar situation on that day. However, in June 1936, a flood caused Lindy Creek and two ice ponds in the Keyser Valley to inundate several blocks on Frink Street. This area was the hardest-hit area during that flood. A reach of Lindy Creek in Scranton was channelized by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection in 1999 and 2000. The channelization exists for flood control purposes. During Special Session No. 2 of 1996, a flood control project on Lindy Creek and several other creeks was authorized for a cost of $17,400,000. The repair of a retaining wall on the creek was also authorized for $16,000 and a project involving a culvert on the creek was authorized for $36,000. The city of Scranton once received a $13,975 grant for debris removal in the creek's watershed. ==Biology== Lindy Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery.

Health Builders believes that the best way to improve health care is to address the structural challenges that prevent it from operating efficiently. Its goal is to provide health facilities with the management frameworks, strong infrastructure and basic resources to operate efficiently and become sustainable. Health Builders works with an exit strategy in mind. It helps communities to build their own health systems, providing the knowledge, materials and technical assistance to provide primary care. In doing so, Health Builders aims to not only ensure locally managed health care, but also give local communities an opportunity to prosper. ==History== Health Builders' work began in 2007 by Josh Ruxin and was originally under the name Rwanda Works before changing it to Health Builders in 2013. The organization was created on the premise that by applying efficiency-focused business principles to health problems, resources could be maximized, people would be healthier, and poor economies would begin to thrive. Since its inception, Health Builders has partnered with the Government of Rwanda and other local partners to improve Rwanda's public health system through hands-on technical assistance, supportive supervision, and management training to public health facilities in need. In 2008, Health Builders expanded its services to include infrastructural development and technological implementation. Health Builders saw how many public health facilities needed basic facilities like stable walls and roofs, sources of clean water or reliable electricity. It considered these resources critical to health centers' success and, in response, began to provide them alongside its management services. Today, Health Builders through its partners has fortified primary care services for 1 million people across Rwanda and provided health care access to 186,000 people formerly without it. ==Work== Health Builders‚Äô interventions are divided into three categories: Management, Infrastructure and Technology. Management Health Builders' District Health Advisor sits with Health Center staff to install and train them in new computer-based accounting system. Health Builders‚Äô management work is designed to address the specific constraints faced by each health facility (e.g., limited power supply, staff with limited education and experience, inadequate infrastructure). In partnership with health center staff and local communities, Health Builders develops and implements management models that fit the facility‚Äôs needs and overcome specific operational challenges. Once the systems are fully functional, Health Builders withdraws, providing only monthly or quarterly assessments of the programs, and support upon request. Its six key domains of management intervention include: * Human Resources & Planning * Pharmacy Logistics * Infrastructure * Data Management & IT Systems * Financial Management * Quality of Clinical Management Infrastructure In partnership with the Government of Rwanda, Health Builders helped to build Gashora Health Center in one of Rwanda's poorest regions. Today, the health center serves approximately 25,000 people and provides everything from top- quality primary health care to such critical services as HIV/AIDS, maternity, and tropical disease care. By developing infrastructure, Health Builders seeks to ensure that every community has access to a safe and permanent local health facility that offers a full range of services, including HIV prevention and treatment programs, tuberculosis treatment, family planning, and maternal and child health care. Health Builders fills infrastructure gaps by initiating and overseeing the construction of modern health centers where they do not exist, or where existing facilities are not functional. Once constructed, ownership of the new facility is given to the national government to ensure sustainability. To date, Health Builders has built six health centers, two maternity wards, and provided solar power to facilities that remain off the grid. A seventh health center is currently under construction in Rubavu district in the Western province. Each new health center serves a catchment population of approximately 25,000 people, though thousands more travel by foot, bike, and bus from other districts to seek the health care those facilities offer. Technology By implementing basic technologies in three key categories, Health Builders has improved care delivery and health outcomes for multiple resource-limited communities. =Maternal and Child Health= Local Community Health Worker checks-in on a new mother. Due to Health Builders' RapidSMS training, she was able to request clinical support and ensure a safe delivery. Many countries continue to struggle with maternal and neonatal mortality, malnutrition, and stunting. Health Builders worked in collaboration with the Rwandan Ministry of Health, UNICEF, and the GE Foundation, to implement RapidSMS ‚Äí a tool that uses mobile text messaging to track health metrics among pregnant women and children under the age of two ‚Äí in Rwanda. Health Builders also seeks to improve maternal and child health through its management interventions, targeted approaches to the referral system, and the use of case-based training for healthcare providers. =Safe Water= Health Builders partners with the Center for Global Safe Water at Emory University and the GE Foundation to provide health facilities with high- volume water purification systems.

An adaptation of an Israeli series with the same title, Boom! is a general-knowledge quiz show where three players must correctly answer questions in order to defuse bombs. The program's stage utilizes 3D projection mapping featuring more than one million LEDs. Boom! is produced by Jeff Apploff and Bob Boden. On August 21, 2016, FOX cancelled Boom! after one season. ==Format== Main game Three players compete as a team to defuse a series of six time bombs by answering one question per bomb. Each question has several answer choices, only one of which is incorrect, and each answer corresponds to a differently colored wire on the bomb. The goal is to cut the wires for only the correct answers before the timer on the bomb reaches zero. Before each question, the category is given and the team chooses one player to attempt it. When the player cuts a wire, the timer briefly stops and the result is revealed after a three-second delay. If the player cuts all the correct wires, the bomb is defused and money is added to the team's bank. However, if the player cuts the incorrect wire or if time runs out, the bomb \\"explodes\\", spraying its contents all over him/her and the studio. That player is then eliminated from the game, and no money is added to the bank. The players and host all wear safety goggles for eye protection while onstage, and the audience members in the front rows wear goggles and plastic rain ponchos to keep themselves clean. The contents of the bombs are typically food items that are sticky and/or hard to clean off clothing, such as pizza sauce, maple syrup, and gravy. Every player must attempt to defuse at least one of the six bombs. If all three players are eliminated, the game ends and the team leaves with no winnings. Values, time limits, and numbers of answer choices increase from one question to the next as shown below. {  ! Bomb !! Value !! Time limit !! Possible answers -  1  $5,000  30 seconds  4 -  2  $10,000  30 seconds  4 -  3  $15,000  30 seconds  4 -  4  $20,000  40 seconds  5 -  5  $25,000  50 seconds  6 -  6  $50,000  60 seconds  7 - } Mega Money Bomb If at least one player is still in the game after the sixth bomb, the team must decide whether to take their winnings and end the game, or attempt to answer a seventh question and defuse the final Mega Money Bomb. The host gives them the category for this question in order to help them decide. The question has 10 answer choices, seven correct and three incorrect, and a 90-second time limit. One player cuts the wires, while the other two can offer advice, and all three must stand over the bomb. Any player may be chosen to cut the wires, regardless of whether or not he/she was eliminated from the main game. If the players successfully defuse the bomb, their entire bank is quadrupled; if not, it is cut in half. The maximum possible winnings total is $500,000, obtained by successfully defusing all seven bombs. ==Episodes== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; background:#fff;\\" - !0000FF; width:10%;\\"Ep. # !0000FF; width:40%;\\"Title !0000FF; width:20%;\\"Original air date !0000FF; width:20%;\\"Viewers (millions) } == International versions == Legend: Currently airing No longer airing Upcoming or returning version {  left; font-size:100%; line-height:16px; background:#F8F8FF; width:100%;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" cccfcf;\\"  Country ! scope=\\"col\\" cccfcf;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" cccfcf;\\"  Network ! scope=\\"col\\" cccfcf;\\"  Host ! scope=\\"col\\" cccfcf;\\"  Date aired -  FFC0CB;\\"   ¬°Boom!

It lies between and separates the three districts of the city (Auto Factory, Central, and Komsomol) from each other. It encompasses about one- quarter of the area of Tolyatti. A natural old-growth forest, it is a prime spot for city dwellers to escape the industrial confines of Tolyatti. The forest is a protected monument of regional significance by declaration of the provincial government of Samara Oblast. Lesnoye Sanatorium, in the middle of the forest (thus its name, which means \\"Sanatorium in the Forest\\") is also a protected monument of regional importance. At the time the Sanatorium was established in 1910, it was on the outskirts of Stavropol-on-Volga; since the city was moved (and renamed), it is now near its center. The forest includes cross-country skiing paths for winter recreation and tennis courts, miniature golf, and a swimming pool for summer. After the conflagration In 2010 (a summer of record heat and widespread fires throughout Russia) the forest was subject to a catastrophic forest fire which devastated large areas of the forest. This was one of the many 2010 Russian wildfires. The Lesnoye Sanatorium was saved (although it had to be evacuated and was closed for more than four months), but crown fires and ground fires devastated large sections of the forest. ==References== Category:Monuments and memorials in Tolyatti Category:Parks in Tolyatti Category:Geography of Tolyatti Category:Forests of Russia ","title":"Tolyatti Pine Forest"},{"id":"46310165","text":"Carnes is an unincorporated community in Sioux County, in the U.S. state of Iowa. ==History== A post office was established at Carnes in 1890, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1914.

He retired as the longest-serving and oldest journalist in Australia. ==History== Holden was born in Chichester, and emigrated with his family to South Australia in the Trusty, arriving 15 May 1838. During the journey became a friend of Jacob Pitman, brother of the famous shorthand inventor. Pitman was a devout Swedenborgian, and Holden became an adherent, helping Pitman establish a New Church in Hanson Street. From 1841 to 1851 the Holden family lived at Hope Valley, where he opened a butcher's shop and store. The name \\"Hope Valley\\" was coined by him when, after fire destroyed his home, he felt optimistic rather than despondent. In 1851 he moved into town, and on 17 November started on his career with The Register as one of only three journalists employed there. And when the rush began to the Victorian goldfields, he was the only reporter left in Adelaide. He soon became a valued member of the literary staff. He was honest, conscientious and hard-working. He had a profound love for literature and music; he had an understanding of mathematics, science and astronomy (he was a member of both the Mathematical Society and the Astronomical Society) and could be relied on to compile accurately the tide tables and statistical information that many of the public were reliant on. Every week from 1868 to 1896 he produced for The Observer, the Register's sister publication, its \\"Puzzler\\" page to stretch and delight the minds of the brighter children and adults so inclined. His views on art and music were respected, and he was considered a deeply religious and moral thinker, heavily influenced by his adherence to the New Church. Above all, his writing was clear and sharp, with an occasional sparkle of wit. And his opinions on practical problems were valued; he could usually be counted on to work out a solution to the most vexing problems Last years He sustained a severe shaking one Sunday night in 1896 when he was knocked down by a horse-drawn carriage in the city whilst crossing from the Register Office to catch the tramcar home. He eventually recovered sufficiently to go out of doors, and though he never returned to his desk at The Register Office, he insisted on contributing his literary work from his residence at North Adelaide. Eventually of course frailty of old age caught up with him and he died peacefully at home some six months short of his 90th birthday. He was buried in the Walkerville Cemetery. ==Family== He was married to Sarah n√©e Ellis (1805‚Äì1851). He married again to Susan Rosanna Williams (c. 1828 ‚Äì 15 July 1909). Among his children were: *George Holden (c. 1833 ‚Äì 29 November 1911) married Maria Wildy (1838 ‚Äì 20 August 1919) *Frances Holden (1836‚Äì1876) *Stephen Trusty Holden (1838 ‚Äì 8 January 1906) was born on voyage out; married Emily Fry Wilkey (21 November 1846 ‚Äì 31 May 1927) *John (c. 1840 ‚Äì 23 November 1869) *William (27 January 1844 ‚Äì ) *Emma Eleanor (17 September 1858 ‚Äì 28 February 1892) lived Jeffcott Street, then Barton Terrace; taught pianoforte from home after studying under Moritz Heuzenroeder.

Unimak pass shearwater flock. The Fox Islands Passes are waterways in the Fox Islands area of the U.S. state of Alaska, connecting the Bering Sea with the North Pacific Ocean . From the southward and eastward, bound for Bering Sea, there are three passes used by deep-draft vessels, known collectively as the Fox Islands Passes, and respectively as Unimak, Akutan, and Unalga passes. The largest and most desirable one to use in thick and foggy weather is the eastern one, Unimak Pass. This is clear of hidden dangers, the widest of the three, and is comparatively free from tide rips. It is especially recommended for sailing vessels, and for steamers bound direct to the northward. Akutan and Unalga passes are convenient for steam vessels bound to Unalaska Bay, but, being narrow and having strong currents and tide rips at times, are not recommended for sailing vessels bound north. A fair wind is almost necessary for the passage, and from the southward this would bring fog. The pass between Ashmiak and Ugamok islands on the east and Sea Lion Island on the west may be clear of dangers, but it is not recommended. All of the other minor passes between Unimak and Akutan passes are known to be full of rocks and reefs. The mountains in this vicinity would be excellent landmarks if they could be seen, but in summer they are almost always obscured by fogs or low-lying clouds. The lower hills and islands and objects near the sea level furnish the available landmarks. In coming from the southward or eastward in clear weather, and if bound through Akutan or Unalga passes, it is recommended to steer for Tigalda Island as the first land to be made. It is high and prominent, and when once made a course can be shaped for any of the three passes. ==Description== Unimak Pass Unimak Pass () is the widest of the Fox Islands Passes, being 9 or 10 miles wide in its narrowest part. It is clear of hidden dangers, free from dangerous tide rips, and the tidal current has less velocity than in the other passes. Except near shore, it is free of sudden blasts of wind descending from the mountainous coast to the sea, known as williwaws. It is the most desirable pass for sailing vessels, and also for all vessels not calling at Unalaska Bay. In approaching from the southward and eastward, care must be taken to keep clear of Sannak Reefs and Anderson and Lenard rocks. If very clear, the mountains of Unimak Island may be made out and the course for Unimak Pass shaped accordingly; but under ordinary conditions the hills back of Cape Khituk, or Ugamok Island, will be the first land sighted. If the weather is thick, soundings on Davidson Bank will be of use in feeling the way in to the land. In the vicinity of Cape Khituk the coast is bold and free from outlying dangers. A reef of rocks was formerly shown on the chart extending between 1 and 2 miles from the east end of Ugamok Island. The IMO Maritime Safety Committee per IMO SN.1/Circ.331 adopted five 'Areas to Be Avoided' (ATBA) in the region of the Aleutian Island Archipelago in order to reduce the risk of a marine casualty and resulting pollution and damage to the environment. These new ATBA‚Äôs came into effect on January 1, 2016. The five ATBA‚Äôs apply to vessels solely in transit through the Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean and in most areas extends no further than 50 nautical miles from the shoreline of the islands. The 50 nautical mile buffer zone is designed to allow for the repair of, or time to launch an emergency response effort to any marine casualty before it runs aground and damages the fragile ecosystem. The establishment of the ATBA adds minimal distance to a voyage. Akutan Pass is about 3 miles wide in its narrowest part. There are four small islets (Gull Rocks) on the western side of the pass, less than 1 mile from Unalga Island, with many detached rocks above water in the same group, but not extending beyond the islets into the pass. There is a reef with some pinnacle rocks on it extending from Cape Morgan not more than 1 mile into the pass. With these exceptions there are no known dangers. The current and tide rips are not so strong as in Unalga Pass. On this account, and because of its greater width and the fact that a straight course will carry through, this pass is preferred by many to Unalga Pass.Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary, Third Edition. Springfield, Massachusetts: Merriam- Webster, Incorporated, 1997. . p. 1219. Akutan Pass Akutan Pass is recommended for steamers bound to or from Unalaska Bay, and for sailing vessels from Unalaska Bay, having a fair wind. From the southward it is recommended to make the land in the vicinity of Tigalda Island and Avatanak Island and follow along the south side of these islands until the course is shaped from Rootok Island to Cape Morgan. From Cape Morgan a west by south course, making allowance for the current, will carry clear of the ledge off Cape Kalekhta. From Unalaska Bay, after clearing Cape Kalekhta, Akutan Pass is open and an east by north course can be steered through. Unalga Pass Unalga Pass is the small pass between Unalga and Unalaska islands. It is the narrowest and shortest of the three passes, and is more generally used by steamers bound to and from Unalaska Bay than either of the other two. It is about one mile wide in its narrowest part, and, with the exception of rocks above water which make out a short distance from the points of Unalaska Island, the pass is considered free from dangers. In the middle of the pass there are depths of 25 to 35 fathoms, with deeper water northwestward and southeastward. Its worst features are the strong tidal currents and tide rips, both of which are generally considered worse in this pass than in either of the other two; williwaws of great force are also experienced -in this pass. The advantage of using this pass in thick weather is that the shore of Unalga Island is clear of dangers, and when made can be followed close enough to keep it in sight while going through. The Signals, Egg Island, and Old Man are the prominent landmarks for making Unalga Pass from the southeastward. ==Soundings== To the southward of the passes, the 100-fathom curve is found from 20 to 40 miles offshore, and when inside of this depth the color of the water will have changed from dark blue to light green. This change in the color of the water is the best indication the mariner has in thick weather to warn him of his approach to land and that he is on soundings. Southwest of Unimak Pass the 50-fathom curve is from 3 to 5 miles offshore, and in thick weather the greatest caution should be used in approaching inside of this depth. Southeast of Unimak Pass, the water shoals rapidly from 100 fathoms to Davidson Bank, on which a least depth of 37 fathoms is marked 33 miles from Ugamok Island. ==Tides and currents== In the vicinity of the passes and in the passes, the tidal currents are strong and their directions uncertain. The current sets southward during the falling tide and northward during the rising tide, which is the longer and stronger of the two. Its velocity varies, but in Unalga Pass, where it is greatest, it has been found to be 61 knots an hour during the whole of the tide, and the current turned to the opposite direction at the same velocity in twenty minutes. At ordinary times the tidal current does not amount to more than three or four knots. On the Bering Sea side of Unalga and Akutan passes, with a strong northerly or northwesterly wind, heavy tide rips are raised. These do not extend through the passes, but seem to be confined to the Bering Sea side from about the middle of Unalga Island almost to Cape Kalekhta. With the ebb tide, a southerly wind does not seem to raise corresponding rips on the Pacific side. When the tide rips are heavy, the water is broken into heavy, choppy seas from every direction. Uniinak Pass is comparatively free from tide rips. In ordinary weather it is high or low water in Akutan Pass between one and two hours before high or low water at Dutch Harbor. ==Anchorages== Beaver Inlet, between Biorka and Unalaska islands, is a deep inlet on the western side of the southern entrance to Unalga Pass. There are several bays leading out of Beaver Inlet. The best anchorage is said to be in Food Bay, on the north side of the inlet, near its entrance. The anchorage near the shore off the village of Biorka, on the south side of the inlet, is poor on account of the deep water; it affords shelter in southerly weather. English Bay, southwest of Unalga Island, is a good harbor. The water is deep, and there are no dangers except on both sides of the entrance, near the shore. The anchorage is at the head of the bay, in about 10 fathoms. Kalekhta Bay, eastward of Cape Kalekhta, is clear of dangers except along shore. Anchorage should not be made in less than 10 fathoms. The bay is much smaller in every way than Unalaska Bay, but it is marked by a cascade on its western side not unlike the one recommended as a landmark for Unalaska Bay. There is also a pinnacle rock off Erskine Point, the eastern point at the entrance, somewhat similar to Priest Rock; but this rock is distinguished by a smaller one between it and Erskine Point. ==Prominent features== Peaks *Shishaldin Volcano, nearly 9,000 feet high, is cone-shaped and very regular in outline, with faint wreaths of smoke and vapor at times drifting from its blackened tip. It is for the most part snow-clad, except where the rocky cliffs and projections afford no lodgment. *Isanotski Peaks is seen close to the eastward of Shishaldin, very rugged, and having a broken or castellated double peak. The summit is bare and looks as though composed of great vertical rock masses. *Pogrumnoi Volcano, over 5,500 feet high, is a rugged, snow-clad peak, with dark vertical ridges cropping through the snow. From a flat-topped dome, apparently as high as Pogrumnoi, but seemingly not connected with it, there extends a long, high, snow-covered table-land, dipping gradually toward Cape Khituk. Except the snow-covered portions, the general color is green during July and August, from the grass-covered slopes. Pogrumnoi is a guiding landmark in clear weather in making Unimak Pass. Islands *Ugamok Island is rugged in outline, with bold rocky cliffs. It is highest at the eastern end, where there is a sharp conical peak, which is very conspicuous, and may often be seen when the summits of the higher islands in the vicinity are obscured by fog. The northern and eastern sides of the island are free from dangers. *Tigalda Island is high and prominent, with distinctly rounded hills, resembling knuckles. The southern shore of the island can be approached as close as 1 mile. The northern and northwestern sides of the island are foul and should not be approached. *Avatanak Island is highest at its eastern end, where it terminates in a bold cliff; toward the western end, which is low, is a pile of very prominent rocks, resembling a ruined castle. The hills are not rounded like those of Tigalda, but are rugged and torn. The southern shore is apparently safe. *Rootok Island, lying westward of Avatanak Island and separated from the latter by a foid passage, is high, bold, and abrupt, and about 3 miles long in a general east-northeast and west-southwest direction. The shores of this island are free from outlying dangers. *Akutan Island is 3,332 feet high. The volcano is a rugged cone, with generally a faint column of smoke issuing from its northeast side near the top. The north side of the island is a fairly regular slope, breaking off at the coast in steep cliffs. The south side is more irregular and the cliffs at the coast are higher and more rocky and broken. In summer the lower parts of the island are grass- covered. Cape Morgan, the southwest point, is high and very bold and precipitous. A shelf of dark rock is at the base of the cliffs, and a reef having three pinnacle rocks above water extends off the cape about 1 mile. *Unalga Island is comparatively low, with a steep ragged shore line of cliffs surrounded by detached pinnacle rocks. The top of the island is covered with grass and shows up well against the dark hills beyond. There is a reef which extends about 200 yards off the northwest end of the island. *Gull Rocks lie off the northeast side of Unalga Island. The group consists of four small islets, standing well out of the water and less than 1 mile from Unalga Island. There are many detached rocks in the same group, but not extending beyond the islets into Akutan Pass. *Egg Island, situated a short distance northward from Biorka Island, is a landmark for Unalga Pass. It is moderately high, rather ragged on top, dark in color, and has a comparatively rounded outline. There is a good passage between the island and Cape Biorka, with a depth of 35 fathoms. When the island bears about southwest by south, a small island, detached from the main island, will open out on its southeastern end. A dark pinnacle rock, showing plainly, lies close to the north end of the island. The shores of the island are free from dangers. The Signals are two low, barren rocks, about 3 miles southward of Egg Island. The channel between them and Biorka Island is clear, with a depth of 10 fathoms. A sunken rock is just outside the Outer Signal. Old Man is a small, square-topped rock, about 60 feet high, lying about 1 mile northwest from Egg Island. There is a low, round-topped rock close to the Old Man. Old Man stands out well clear from Egg Island and, in thick weather, serves as an excellent mark by which to recognize Egg Island. Aleks Rock, on which the sea breaks in a well-defined breaker, is about 20 feet across, and lies with Sannak Peak bearing approximately northeast, distant 19 miles. ==References== * Category:Fox Islands (Alaska) Category:Landforms of the Aleutian Islands Category:Straits of Alaska Category:Straits of the Pacific Ocean Category:Bodies of water of the Bering Sea ","title":"Fox Islands Passes"},{"id":"46310216","text":"Elpidio Quirino Avenue, also known simply as Quirino Avenue, is a major north- south collector road in Para√±aque, southern Metro Manila, Philippines. It is a four-lane undivided arterial running parallel to Roxas Boulevard and its extension, the Manila‚ÄìCavite Expressway, to the west from Baclaran at Para√±aque's border with Pasay in the north to San Dionisio right by the border with Las Pi√±as in the south. It is a continuation of Harrison Avenue from Pasay and was originally a segment of the coastal highway called Calle Real. The avenue is designated as a component of Manila's Radial Road 2 network. It was named after President Elpidio Quirino. ==Route description== Elpidio Quirino Avenue in Baclaran The street starts after F.B. Harrison Avenue at the junction of Harrison with Redemptorist Road and Taft Avenue (Taft Avenue Extension) near Baclaran station, the current terminus of the elevated Manila LRT-1. It travels south across the crowded marketplace of Baclaran just behind the popular Baclaran Church and crosses Airport Road into barangay Tambo. The street then runs parallel to the Estero de Tripa de Gallina to the east which serves as Para√±aque's border with Pasay and heads for the junction with NAIA Road and the elevated NAIA Expressway. A few hundred meters south, the road enters the barangay Don Galo and crosses the Para√±aque River into the old center (poblacion) of Para√±aque called La Huerta. It then curves slightly upon reaching the St. Andrew's Cathedral and straightens back as it heads south into barangay San Dionisio. The road intersects with Victor Medina Street near the Kabihasnan Entrance to the Manila-Cavite Expressway and ends just a few hundred meters south as it enters barangay Manuyo Uno in Las Pi√±as, where it continues as Diego Cera Avenue. ==History== The old fa√ßade of the St. Andrew's Cathedral and Saint Andrew's School on Calle Real Elpidio Quirino Avenue marks the original shoreline of Manila Bay in Para√±aque pueblo as it existed during the Spanish colonial period. It forms part of an old Spanish coastal highway that linked the Province of Manila to La Laguna and other southern provinces. It was called Calle Real or Camino Real (Spanish for \\"royal street\\") which spanned from Ermita to Muntinlupa, Rizal. It was the location of Camp Dewey, an early U.S. military installation during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. This \\"camp in Tambo\\" was converted into a Philippine Army camp in 1936. However, by 2003, the military camp known as Camp Claudio has been transformed into a housing and urban development site. At present, only the Las Pi√±as and Muntinlupa section is called Calle Real or Real Street as an alternative name for the road. The Para√±aque portion is renamed Elpidio Quirino Avenue while those of the City of Manila and Pasay have been renamed to M.H. Del Pilar Street and F.B.

Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an average of 6.5% per year from 1957 to 2005. Performance peaked in the early 1980s through the mid-1990s, as the economy experienced sustained rapid growth averaging almost 8% annually. High levels of foreign and domestic private investment played a significant role as the economy diversified and modernised. Once heavily dependent on primary products such as rubber and tin, Malaysia today is an upper middle-income country with a multi-sector economy based on services and manufacturing. Malaysia is one of the world's largest exporters of semiconductor components and devices, electrical goods, solar panels, and information and communication technology (ICT) products. ==Early and colonial history== The Malay Peninsula and has been a centre for trade for centuries. Various items such as porcelain and spice were actively traded even before Malacca and Singapore rose to prominence. The Malacca Sultanate controlled the Straits of Malacca from its founding in 1402 to the 1511 invasion by Portugal. All the trade in the Straits, and especially the spices from the Celebes and the Moluccas, moved under its protection and through its markets. In the 17th century, porcelain and spices were found in several Malay states and were actively traded. Large deposits of tin were found in several Malay states. Later, as the British started to take over as administrators of Malaya, rubber and palm oil trees were introduced for commercial purposes. Instead of relying on local Malays as a source of labour, the British brought in Chinese and Indians to work in the mines and plantations and provide professional expertise. Although many of them returned to their respective home countries after their agreed tenure ended, some remained in Malaysia and settled permanently. These three commodities along with other raw materials firmly set Malaysia's economic tempo well into the mid-20th century. As Malaya moved towards independence, the government began implementing economic five-year plans, beginning with the First Malayan Five Year Plan in 1955. Upon the establishment of Malaysia, the plans were re-titled and renumbered, beginning with the First Malaysia Plan in 1965. ==Post-independence== Malaysia¬¥s economic development was remarkable, given its troubled beginnings in the early 1960s and the ethnic partitions that were inherited from centuries of segmented economic development. In the 1970s, Malaysia began to imitate the four Asian Tiger economies (South Korea, Taiwan, the then British Crown Colony of Hong Kong, and Singapore) and committed itself to a transition from being reliant on mining and agriculture to an economy that depends more on manufacturing. In the 1970s, the predominantly mining and agricultural based Malaysian economy began a transition towards a more multi-sector economy. Since the 1980s the industrial sector has led Malaysia's growth. High levels of investment played a significant role in this. With Japanese investment, heavy industries flourished and in a matter of years, Malaysian exports became the country's primary growth engine. Malaysia consistently achieved more than 7% GDP growth along with low inflation in the 1980s and the 1990s. Central planning has been a major factor in the Malaysian economy, as government expenditure was often used to stimulate the economy. Since 1955, with the commencement of the First Malayan Five Year Plan, the government has used these plans to intervene in the economy to achieve such goals as redistribution of wealth and investment in, for instance, infrastructure projects. A legacy of the British colonial system was the division of Malaysians into three groups according to ethnicity. The Malays were concentrated in their traditional villages, focusing mainly on agricultural activities, while the Chinese dominated Malaysian commerce. Educated Indians took up professional roles such as those of doctors or lawyers, while the less better-off worked the plantations.Abdullah, Asma & Pedersen, Paul B. (2003). Understanding Multicultural Malaysia, p. 44. Pearson Malaysia. .Rashid, Rehman (1993). A Malaysian Journey, p. 28. Self-published. . Chinese businesses in Malaysia developed as part of the larger bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family and cultural ties. The Reid Commission which drafted the Malaysian Constitution made a provision for limited affirmative action through Article 153, which gave the Malays special privileges, such as 60% of university entrance (quota). However, after the May 13 incident of racial rioting in the federal capital of Kuala Lumpur, the government initiated more aggressive programmes aimed at actively establishing a Malay entrepreneurial class through direct intervention in the economy, aimed at alleviating poverty. This was done with the controversial New Economic Policy (NEP).Jomo Kwame Sundaram. UNRISD The New Economic Policy and Interethnic Relations in Malaysia. Its main objective was the elimination of the association of race with economic function, and the first five-year plan to begin implementing the NEP was the Second Malaysia Plan. The success or failure of the NEP is the subject of much debate, although it was officially retired in 1990 and replaced by the National Development Policy (NDP). Current GDP per capita grew 31% in the Sixties and 358% in the Seventies, but this proved unsustainable and growth scaled back sharply to 36% in the Eighties. It rose again to 59% in the Nineties led primarily by export-oriented industries. This increase in GDP was brought about due to a shift from the traditional agricultural and resource based economy to one based on manufactured goods. From 1988 to 1996, Malaysia's economy expanded at 8 per cent, the second fastest after China, resulting in manufactured goods such as microchips and semiconductors making up 80 per cent of exports. Per capita income doubled from 1990 to 1996. Infrastructure projects were greatly increased in this time. Other countries looked to Malaysia at the time as an example for economic reform. The rate of poverty in Malaysia also fell dramatically over the years. However, its precipitous drop has been questioned by critics who suggest that the poverty line has been drawn at an unreasonably low level. The rapid economic boom led to a variety of supply problems. Labour shortages soon resulted in an influx of millions of foreign workers, many illegal. Cash-rich PLCs and consortia of banks eager to benefit from increased and rapid development began large infrastructure projects. ==Tiger economy== Macro-economic trend This is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Malaysia at market prices estimated by the International Monetary Fund with figures in millions of Malaysian Ringgit. { class=\\"toccolours sortable\\" border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" style=\\"border-collapse:collapse; width:40em\\" - !

Mean wages were $6.95 per man-hour in 2009. From 1988 to 1997, the Malaysian economy experienced a period of broad diversification and sustained rapid growth averaging 9% annually. By 1999, nominal per capita GDP had reached $3,238. New foreign and domestic investment played a significant role in the transformation of Malaysia's economy. Manufacturing grew from 13.9% of GDP in 1970 to 30% in 1999, while agriculture and mining which together had accounted for 42.7% of GDP in 1970, dropped to 9.3% and 7.3%, respectively, in 1999. Manufacturing accounted for 30% of GDP (1999). Major products include electronic components ‚Äì Malaysia is one of the world's largest exporters of semiconductor devices ‚Äì electrical goods and appliances. During the same period, the government tried to eradicate poverty with a highly controversial race-based program called New Economic Policy (NEP). First established in 1971 following race riots, commonly known in Malaysia as the May 13 Incident, it sought to eradicate poverty and end the identification of economic function with ethnicity. In particular, it was designed to improve the distribution of wealth among the country's population. The NEP formally ended in 1991, however, much of it remains in effect through other governmental policies. The influx of foreign investment led to the KLSE Composite index trading above 1,300 in 1994 and the Ringgit trading above 2.5 in 1997. At various times the KLSE was the most active exchange in the world, with trading volume exceeding even the NYSE. The stock market capitalisation of listed companies in Malaysia was valued at $181,236 million in 2005 by the World Bank.Data ‚Äì Finance Some of the more visible projects from that period are Putrajaya, a new international airport (Kuala Lumpur International Airport), a hydroelectric dam (Bakun dam), the Petronas Towers and the Multimedia Super Corridor. Proposals that were eventually cancelled include the 95 km Sumatra‚ÄìMalaysia bridge (would have been world's longest), the Mega International Sea and Air port on reclaimed land in Kedah (would have been world's biggest) and the KL Linear City (would have been the world's longest mall and the world's first city built over a river). Concerns were raised during the time about the sustainability of the rapid growth and the ballooning current account. The mainstream opinion prevalent at that time was that the deficit was temporary and would reverse once imported equipment started producing for export. In spite of that, measures were taken to moderate growth especially when it threatened to overheat into the double digits. The main target was asset prices, and restrictions were further tightened on foreign ownership of local assets. Exposure of local banks to real estate loans were also capped at 20%. As was widely expected, the current account deficit did narrow steadily, year to year, from 9% to 5% of GDP. Malaysia has the largest operational stock of industrial robots in the Muslim world. Malaysia's capital market crossed the RM2 trillion threshold for the first time at the end of 2010. The capital market had achieved an annual compounded growth rate of 11% from RM717bil in 2000 due to rapid economic expansion and strong regulatory oversight that underpinned investor confidence in the Malaysian capital market. ==Asian financial crisis and recovery== One of the most significant events in the history of the Malaysian economy was the Asian financial crisis, which caused Malaysia's GDP to shrink from US$100.8 billion in 1996 to US$72.2 billion in 1998. The Malaysian economy's GDP did not recover to 1996 levels until 2003. The year 1997 saw drastic changes in Malaysia. There was speculative short- selling of the Malaysian currency, the ringgit. Foreign direct investment fell at an alarming rate and, as capital flowed out of the country, the value of the ringgit dropped from MYR 2.50 per USD to, at one point, MYR 4.80 per USD. The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's composite index fell from approximately 1300 to nearly merely 400 points in a few short weeks. After the controversial sacking of finance minister Anwar Ibrahim, a National Economic Action Council was formed to deal with the monetary crisis. Bank Negara imposed capital controls and pegged the Malaysian ringgit at 3.80 to the US dollar. It also fully suspended the trading of CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) counters, indefinitely freezing approximately US$4.47 billion worth of shares and affecting 172,000 investors, most of them Singaporeans. Malaysia refused economic aid packages from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, unlike the other countries affected by the crisis. By refusing aid and thus the conditions attached thereof from the IMF, Malaysia was not affected to the same degree in the Asian Financial Crisis as Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. Regardless, the GDP suffered a 7.5% contraction in 1998. It however rebounded to grow by 5.6% in 1999. To rejuvenate the economy, massive government spending was made and Malaysia continuously recorded budget deficits in the years that followed. Economic recovery has been led by strong growth in exports, particularly of electronics and electrical products, to the United States, Malaysia's principal trade and investment partner. Inflationary pressures remained benign, and, as a result, Bank Negara Malaysia, the central bank, had been able to follow a low interest rate policy. The Malaysian economy recovered from the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis sooner than neighbouring countries, and has since recovered to the levels of the pre- crisis era with a GDP per capita of $14,800. The fixed exchange rate was abandoned on 21 July 2005 in favour of a managed floating system within an hour of China announcing the same move. In the same week, the ringgit strengthened a percent against various major currencies and was expected to appreciate further. In September 2005, Sir Howard J. Davies, director of the London School of Economics, at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur, cautioned Malaysian officials that if they want a flexible capital market, they will have to lift the ban on short-selling put into effect during the crisis. In March 2006, Malaysia removed the ban on short selling.Financial Times. Malaysia relaxes short-selling ban. Retrieved 28 March 2006. Some of the measures taken by the Malaysian government in response to the Asian crisis, such as the ban on short selling, were swiftly adopted by the very countries that had previously been critical of the Malaysian response. Regardless of cause and effect claims, rejuvenation of the economy also coincided with massive government spending and budget deficits in the years that followed the crisis. Later, Malaysia enjoyed faster economic recovery compared to its neighbours. The country has recovered to the levels of the pre-crisis era ‚Äì as an example, the KLCI Composite Index reached 1,896 in 2014, significantly higher than the pre- crisis record of 1,275 in 1993. While the pace of development today is not as rapid, it is seen to be more sustainable.

It guarantees the defense of anyone in Alabama in a death penalty case. Founder Bryan Stevenson was depicted in the legal drama Just Mercy which is based on his memoir Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption which tells the story of Walter McMillian and, in less detail, the stories of numerous other cases that Stevenson worked (including not only adult death penalty cases but also U.S. Supreme Court cases which ended the death penalty and life imprisonment for child offenders). Equal Justice Initiative won the 2020 Webby People‚Äôs Voice Award for Charitable Organization / Nonprofit in the category Web. ==History== The Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) was founded in 1989 in Montgomery, Alabama, by attorney Bryan Stevenson, who has served as the organization's executive director ever since. He had been working on Alabama defense cases since 1989 for the Southern Center for Human Rights and was director of its center for Alabama operations. It had received federal funding to provide legal representation to prisoners on death row. In 1994, after Republicans gained control of Congress in a mid-term election, they ceased funding such centers. Alabama is the only state that does not provide legal assistance to death row prisoners; EJI has committed to representing them. Stevenson converted his operation in Montgomery by founding a non-profit, the Equal Justice Initiative. In 1995 he was awarded a MacArthur fellowship, and he applied all of the money to support the EJI. The EJI \\"guarantees legal representation to every inmate on the state‚Äôs death row.\\" It has worked to eliminate excessive and unfair sentencing, exonerate innocent death row prisoners, confront abuse of the incarcerated and the mentally ill, and aid children prosecuted as adults.\\"Bryan Stevenson\\", 2014, EJI website; accessed 17 August 2016 By 2013 EJI had a staff of 40, including attorneys and support personnel. On April 26, 2018, the EJI opened two new venues in Montgomery in memory of the victims of lynchings in the Southern United States: the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, and The Legacy Museum. Campaign against life-without-parole sentencing for juveniles Following the Roper v. Simmons (2005) ruling, in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to sentence to death a person who had been a minor under 18 at the time of the crime, Stevenson began to work to have similar thinking applied to the sentencing of a convicted minor to life-without-parole in prison. He has argued several cases in the Supreme Court, and has been part of a movement to urge changes in extreme sentencing of juveniles convicted of crimes. The Court has made several significant rulings to lighten sentencing of juveniles since Roper v. Simmons. In 2006 EJI started a litigation campaign to challenge the sentencing of minors to life-without-parole. Stevenson testified before the court in 2009 in one case. In Graham v. Florida (2010), the Court ruled that \\"mandatory life-without-parole sentences for all children 17 or younger in non-homicide cases are unconstitutional.\\" Since 2010, EJI has provided legal representation to nearly 100 people in the United States who are entitled to new sentences under Graham. \\"Death in Prison Sentences for Children\\" , Equal Justice Initiative website At that time, there were nearly \\"3000 children age 17 or younger who had been sentenced to imprisonment until death through life-without-parole sentences imposed with very little scrutiny or review. Children as young as 13 were among the thousands condemned to die in prison.\\" Most of the sentences imposed on these juveniles were mandatory, but EJI continued to argue along the lines of the Court's ruling in Roper v. Simmons, that juveniles have \\"unique immaturity, impulsiveness, vulnerability, and capacity for redemption and rehabilitation.\\" EJI argued in US Supreme Court cases Miller v. Alabama and Jackson v. Hobbs that the mandatory sentences constituted \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\" and were therefore unconstitutional. The Court ruled in these cases in June 2012 that even when cases involved homicide, mandatory life-without-parole sentences for minors 17 or younger are unconstitutional. The ruling affected statutes in 29 states. In Montgomery v. Louisiana (2016), the Court ruled that the decision in Miller v. Alabama had to be applied retroactively, and required those sentencing to consider ‚Äúchildren‚Äôs diminished culpability, and heightened capacity for change.‚Äù An estimated 2300 prisoners nationwide may be affected whose sentences will be reviewed. Campaign against the death penalty In April 2015, EJI won the release on different grounds of Anthony Ray Hinton, a black man who had been on death row in Alabama for nearly 30 years; he had continued to maintain his innocence. He was released after being wrongfully convicted of murder due to inadequate counsel and faulty evidence. He had finally gained a new trial on appeal, as the defense found flaws in the main evidence used by the prosecution. In preparation for trial, the prosecution found that the bullets used in the crime did not match the gun they had traced to Hinton's home. There was no case, and the state dropped the charges. , the EJI organization has prevented more than 125 people from receiving the death penalty.Jeffrey Toobin, \\"The Legacy of Lynching, on Death Row\\", New Yorker, 22 August 2016, pp. 38-47 Studies The EJI has published a number of studies, including Lynching in America: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror, which was first published in 2015 and is in its 3rd edition. It concludes that a total of 3,959 lynchings of African Americans had occurred in the twelve states of the South from 1877 to 1950. The victims were mostly African-American men, although women and children were also killed. The report classified the lynchings as racial terrorism, designed to suppress the African-American community, especially as the southern legislatures were passing new laws and constitutions to disenfranchise most blacks at the turn of the century. Whites maintained this political exclusion, in part through regular intimidation and violence, through the mid-1960s. The report discusses the long-term effects of the decades of violence on the African-American community and southern society, and on relations between the races. According to the EJI, the history of lynching and white supremacy underlies the South's history of extensive use of the death penalty and incarceration of African Americans. Stevenson and EJI staff believe this past must be acknowledged and commemorated \\"with memorials and monuments that encourage and create space for the 'restorative power of truthtelling' \\", as has been done by other countries and communities. This new research added nearly 700 cases to previous documentation of lynchings of African Americans in this period. EJI has since published two updated editions of its summary data, which increased the total number of black racial terror victims identified to 4,084 in the Southern states, and 300 in other states in this same time period. ==Legacy Museum and National Memorial for Peace and Justice== Legacy Museum The Legacy Museum, in Montgomery, Alabama, and the nearby National Memorial for Peace and Justice, opened on April 26, 2018. The topic of the museum is the post-slavery treatment of African Americans by whites. Rather than ending, according to Equal Justice Initiative's head Bryan Stevenson, slavery \\"evolved\\": sharecropping, Jim Crow laws, mass incarceration, convict leasing, and lynching. The museum reflects \\"Stevenson's view that, unlike in [post- Apartheid] South Africa or post-Nazi Germany or many other societies traumatized by history, we‚Äôve hardly begun to grapple with ours ‚Äî and so cannot yet get beyond it.\\" National Memorial for Peace and Justice Opened on April 26, 2018, also in Montgomery, the Memorial is intended to call attention to \\"an aspect of the nation's racial history that‚Äôs discussed the least,\\" according to Equal Justice Initiative Bryan Stevenson: the 4,400 victims of \\"terror lynchings\\" black people from 1877 through 1950. \\"The memorial's design evokes the image of a racist hanging, featuring scores of dark metal columns suspended in the air from above. The rectangular structures, some of which lie flat on the ground and resemble graves, include the names of counties where lynchings occurred, plus dates and the names of the victims. The goal is for individual counties to claim the columns on the ground and erect their own memorials.\\" ==Other exhibits== In 2019, the initiative cooperated with the Levine Museum of the New South in preparing their exhibit \\"The Legacy of Lynching: Confronting Racial Terror in America\\". ==References * *\\"Equal Justice Initiative\\", Charity Navigator *Equal Justice Initiative, Lynching in America: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror (2015) Category:Organizations established in 1989 Category:Organizations based in Montgomery, Alabama Category:1989 establishments in Alabama Category:Non-profit organizations based in Alabama Category:Wrongful conviction advocacy Category:Criminal defense organizations ","title":"Equal Justice Initiative"},{"id":"46310333","text":"2013 U.S. Figure Skating Collegiate National Champion Farah Jameela Sheikh (pronounced 'Shake') is the 2013 US Ladies Collegiate Figure Skating National Champion.Freshman Psychology Major Skates to Senior Title at Collegiate ChampionshipsSheikh, Carriere, Young earn titles at collegiates She is from Lexington, Kentucky. == Career == She began skating as a preteen.

The series starred Edward Binns and James Broderick as Lt. Roy Brenner and Det. Ernie Brenner, respectively. Brenner, a perennial summer replacement series, aired new episodes on CBS from June 6, 1959-September 19, 1959 and again from May 17-July 19, 1964. Reruns plus two previously unaired episodes were seen during the summer of 1961, an additional summer of reruns in 1962 and a final set of new and repeat broadcasts from July 26-September 13, 1964. ==Premise== The show was centered around the careers of the Brenners, Roy and his son Ernie. Roy (Edward Binns) is a street hardened lieutenant of the Internal Affairs Department of the NYPD. He has been a part of the NYPD for twenty years. His son Ernie (James Broderick) is an idealistic rookie detective also working for the NYPD. Together, the two face, fight and solve crime, as well as face police corruption and all its ugliness, and try to learn from their different views of life, death, and work. It was somewhat of a challenge for the two to portray a convincing father-and-son duo with Binns only 11 years older than Broderick. ==Synopsis== Development The series was created by producer Herbert Brodkin, who had already made himself a household name with producing credits on The Philco Television Playhouse, Goodyear Television Playhouse and The Alcoa Hour for NBC, and Studio One and Playhouse 90 for CBS. Brodkin later produced several other well-well-known television series including The Defenders and The Nurses. Brenner was a transitional project for Brodkin. It was his first independent production, his first series to be shot on film, and (aside from his first producing assignment, CBS's live Charlie Wild, Private Detective) his initial concession to the reality that programs with running characters were quickly supplanting the anthology drama. Like The Defenders and The Nurses, Brenner was based on a one-shot anthology show from Brodkin's catalog, a January 15, 1959 telecast of Playhouse 90 entitled \\"The Blue Men\\". Intriguingly, Alvin Boretz, who wrote The Blue Men, is not credited as the creator of Brenner, although he did contribute scripts to the series. Season 1 (1959-1961) Brenner premiered on Saturday June 6, 1959 on the CBS Television Network. Ratings were poor from the beginning and after fourteen episodes aired, on September 19, 1959, Brenner was cancelled. Two new episodes produced in 1960 aired in June and September 1961. Season 2 (1964) Sixteen episodes of Brenner aired on CBS between June 6, 1959 and September 11, 1961. Ten addition episodes that were produced between 1959 and 1960 had never aired on television. With reruns airing during the summers of 1961 and 1962, CBS decided that during the summer of 1964, they would air the remaining episodes five years after the initial cancellation and three years after new episodes of the series had last aired. The last of those ten episodes aired on Sunday July 19, 1964 with reruns airing until September 13. According to the Classic Television Archive (CTVA)Classic Television Archive (CTVA) a total of 25 episodes of Brenner aired on CBS between June 6, 1959 and July 19, 1964. ==Cast== *Lieutenant Roy Brenner - portrayed by Edward Binns.

It would be located on a lot at the northeast corner of Sand Lake Road and International Drive in Orlando, Florida. Plans for the complex were to include a tower, which would feature the world's tallest roller coaster, Skyscraper, and the world's largest Perkins Restaurant and Bakery. In January 2019 the project was planned to cost and include space for a future hotel. The complex was originally planned to open in 2020. However as of 2020, the project is in limbo and it is unclear whether or not the complex will be built. ==History== The project began in 2012 with a planned budget of US$500,000,000. After several successful negotiations for land to build the attraction, conducted under the name WF IDrive Realty, development of Skyplex and the roller coaster began. The complex was designed by Helman Hurley Charvat Peacock/Architects Inc. Winter Park Construction Company was chosen as the general contractor. Euforria LLC provided the pre-construction and construction management services. In May 2014, a website asking for investors was published. In 2015, Wallack Holdings LLC spent to develop a retail complex, a parking garage, and a Mango's Tropical Cafe on the southwest corner of the same intersection as Skyplex. On December 1, 2015, the Orange County Board of Commissioners unanimously approved the project's rezoning. The project was lobbied against by Save Our Orange County Community, a group backed primarily by Universal Orlando. Universal's main issues with the project were that the Skyscraper might ruin the sight lines from their parks, specifically The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, and that Universal was not permitted to build anything over . Portions of the roller coaster's track had been completed by Intamin and were in storage by April 2017, but the start of construction in Orlando was on hold pending the approval of permits. In January 2019, it was announced that the project had been scaled back to and would only take up a portion of the planned site, but that the size of the tower and 2020 opening date would remain unchanged. However, Wallack Holdings LLC started losing capital and investors began to have doubts in Wallack's ability to run the company. Due to multiple delays, the project was later removed from Mango's Tropical Cafe's website in June 2019 and was placed in limbo as of 2020. It is unknown whether or not construction will begin. ==Planned Attractions== Skyplex would feature Skyscraper, which would be the world's tallest roller coaster at over . Development of Skyscraper began in 2012 after the Polercoaster concept from US Thrill Rides was selected as an attraction for the new complex. Skyscraper was officially announced on June 5, 2014. In February 2015, it was announced that a drop thrill ride called SkyFall would be incorporated into the design of Skyscraper. An adult game room would feature party rooms, a central bar, billiards, video games, and simulators. The family game area would feature traditional games, electronic games, and simulators. There would be a high speed competitive go-cart track, and a track designed for all ages. The Apex Sports Bar would include private party rooms, VIP seating, a tequila bar, and large screen theatre style viewing of sports programs. The Skyplex Observation Deck would be high, and was planned to be accessible via what would be Florida's tallest glass elevator. There would be an open-air retail area promenade, SkyPlaza, with a raised pedestrian walkway leading to the main entrance. SkyPlaza would be anchored by a Perkins Restaurant and Bakery, which would be the largest in the world. The promenade would‚Äôve include several other retail and restaurant tenants. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Orlando, Florida Category:Tourist attractions in Orlando, Florida Category:Proposed skyscrapers in the United States ","title":"Skyplex"},{"id":"46310506","text":"Chia-Hui Lu () is a Taiwanese classical pianist.

On the right side is Iliukliuk Harbor, the South Channel and Captains Bay in the background. Unalaska Bay is a waterway of Unalaska Island in the U.S. state of Alaska. It is situated below the eastern slopes of Makushin Volcano. Composed of seven individual bays, Unalaska Bay opens onto the Bering Sea. ==Description== Dutch Harbor from outer space. Unalaska Bay is the general name of the indentation making in to the north end of Unalaska Island between Cape Kalekhta and Cape Cheerful. Commercially, it was the most important bay in western Alaska in the beginning of the 20th century. Its shores are generally mountainous with precipitous sea faces. Amaknak Island lies in its southern end. Westward of the island the water is deep, but there is no good harbor in this part of the bay; eastward of the island are the important anchorages of Dutch Harbor, Iliuliuk Bay, and Iliuliuk Harbor. The channel to Iliuliuk Bay and Dutch Harbor is free from dangers except along the shores. Iliuliuk Harbor is obstructed at its entrance by ledges. Cape Cheerful, the western point at the entrance to Unalaska Bay, is made up of bold, very high headlands, rounded on top, and intersected by deep, grassy valleys. The shore is free from dangers and has deep water close-to. A cascade, 125 feet high, south of Cape Cheerful, is a conspicuous mark from the vicinity of Cape Kalekhta, and is useful in thick weather when only the lower part of the land can be seen. Ulakhta Head, 900 feet high, the north end of Amaknak Island, is, in clear weather, one of the best landmarks for fixing the position of Unalaska Bay. In appearance it is like a pyramid with the top cut off. The top shows perfectly flat, and there is no other headland or mountain in this vicinity that has this feature. It is not as high as the background, but shows up well against it, and can be made out at a long distance from the bay. From its northwest point a reef extends off  mile, marked by Needle Rock, similar in appearance to Priest Rock, but not so large. From its northeast point a long, narrow sand spit extends to the southward l¬£ miles; its southern end, called Spithead, is marked by a beacon, about 15 feet high, standing close to its southern shore. Princess Head, 2 miles from Cape Kalekhta, is a large square-headed rock that projects from the shore far enough to be distinctly observed, even in thick weather, in following along the east shore. Constantine Bay, about 4 miles from Cape Kalekhta, is obstructed by numerous rocky ledges, many of which are only evident from the attached kelp. It is of no importance and should be avoided by all vessels. Summer Bay, the large, shallow bight, 3 miles from Constantine Bay and opposite Ulakhta Head, is shoal, and its shores are lined with kelp-marked rocks and ledges. At its southern headland is Pinnacle Rock, about 60 feet high. This bay is an excellent place to seine for salmon. The bay should be avoided by vessels. Iliuliuk Bay extends from Pinnacle Rock and Ulakhta Head to Iliuliuk. To the northward of Spithead there is a ridge extending across the bay, having a least depth of 10 fathoms. South of this ridge the depths increase to 16 and 19 fathoms. There is anchorage anywhere in the bay. The usual anchorage is at the head in 14 to 16 fathoms, muddy bottom, where, even with northerly winds, the force of the sea does not seem to reach home. At the head of Iliuliuk Bay, behind the village, there is a distinct ravine or break in the mountains, which extends through to the water to the southward. This is a useful guide for entering the bay and inner harbor. The portion south- southwestward of Amaknak Island is the long narrow inlet of Captains Bay. There is a narrow passage from it to Iliuliuk Harbor. On the western side of Unalaska Bay are Nateekin Bay, Broad Bay, and Eider Point Anchorage. ==Sailing directions== When bound for Unalaska Bay from any part of Bering Sea, it is recommended to shape the course for Cape Cheerful. In thick weather it is better to fall to the westward of Cape Cheerful and then round it than to fall to the eastward of it and get down among the passes. Makushin Volcano, 5,474 feet high, can generally be seen in clear weather, and is very prominent. An extinct crater, 2,314 feet high, back of Cape Cheerful and west of Eider Point, gives a distinct point for which to steer until close enough to distinguish the surrounding features. On getting close to the island, when the fog hangs over the land but leaves a clear space just along the water's edge, Wislow Island forms a good landmark. It is a very small, rounded island, regular in shape, and stands off far enough from the land to be distinctly seen as not a part of the main island. To the westward, under similar conditions, Makushin Cape can be seen at times. The land slopes gently to the cape from Makushin Volcano, and ends in a small, peak-like formation at the end of the cape. From the eastward the cascade south of Cape Cheerful is also useful. Strangers, when in the vicinity and uncertain of the identity of the bay and its landmarks, should endeavor to pick out Ulakhta Head. Looking into the bay, its flat top breaking off abruptly to sloping sides presents an appearance unlike any other in the vicinity, and shows up well against the background of mountains. ==Dangers== Navigators should avoid the kelp, which invariably indicates a rocky bottom. A large cluster of rocks, mostly awash, and usually marked by breakers, extends nearly to the westward of the south head of Constantine Bay. Pinnacle Rock is surrounded by reefs, awash and under water, for a distance of . Between Pinnacle Rock and a point opposite the entrance to Dutch Harbor the east shore is lined with rocks, and should not be approached closer than . The spit has a kelp-marked shoal on its east side which extends its whole length; at its middle point the shoal extends from shore. Spithead is bold-to, and may be safely approached as close as . There is a beacon, about 15 feet high, standing close to its southern shore. Rocky Point has a kelp-marked reef which extends toward Spithead about ; eastward of the point shoal water makes out about with little kelp. The northern extremity of the reef is marked by a buoy painted white. From Rocky Point south, the shore of Amaknak Island should not be approached closer than . Iliuliuk Reef consists of a ledge of rocks, portions of which are always exposed, extending in an east and west direction for . From the eastern dry rock a ledge, marked by kelp, extends south by east-southeast . The southern extremity of this ledge is sometimes marked by a buoy. Tuscarora Rock, marked by kelp, lies about south-southeast by east. from the southern extremity of Iliuliuk Reef. It is small and generally marked by an iron barrel buoy. These buoys were maintained by the Alaska Commercial Company. ==References== * ==External links== * Category:Bays of Alaska Category:Amaknak Island Category:Fox Islands (Alaska) Category:Unalaska Island Category:Landforms of the Aleutian Islands ","title":"Unalaska Bay"},{"id":"46310529","text":"One to Infinity (stylised as 1 ‚Üí ‚àû) is an EP and the second release by English punk rock band the Outsiders, released in 1977. == Reception == One to Infinity received mixed-to-favourable reviews from critics.

The character was designed to be \\"severe and dramatic\\", and has a heavily angular face representing her \\"hard edge\\". The developers wanted the Seeker armor to be easily recognisable, and it has a \\"strong and graphic\\" silhouette. Longer hair proved difficult to animate in the game, leading to her current short hair. It was intended that Cassandra visually display her authority and power. Miranda Raison provides Cassandra's voice in the games, though she does not voice the character in Dawn of the Seeker. Cassandra received a positive reception in Inquisition, with attention being drawn to her layered personality, as well as her place as one of Inquisitions diverse cast of women. For her earlier appearance in Dawn of the Seeker, she received a more mixed response, with some credit going to her design but her characterization being criticised. ==Character overview== The character is presented as a member of the Seekers of Truth, a \\"quiet\\" order dedicated to protecting and policing the Chantry, described as \\"the best of the best\\" with unique training and access to powerful magic. The order are \\"granted ultimate authority in its investigations\\", and answer directly to the Divine. Robert Purchese of Eurogamer roughly equated the Chantry and the Divine to the Christian Church and the Pope, respectively. Originally a noble, the Pentaghasts being the ruling family of Neverra as well as famed dragon hunters, Cassandra joined the Seekers after her brother died. In addition to being a Seeker, she is the Right Hand of the Divine, serving as the physical side in extending the Divine's reach. Cassandra is \\"strong, militant, with a very hard line\\" concerning the Chantry, someone who \\"won't take no for an answer\\". Creative director Mike Laidlaw described Cassandra as being \\"brash, impulsive\\" and having \\"anger management issues\\", but also being \\"incredibly dedicated\\" and in the third Dragon Age game doing \\"whatever it takes to set the world right\\". Cassandra's writer in Inquisition, David Gaider, attributed to her \\"a sense of propriety and duty\\", though felt she did what she felt was \\"right and just\\" over following \\"law or duty\\". He described her as \\"very practical in battle\\", and primarily focused on protecting the helpless or innocent over style or \\"showing off\\". Gaider also drew a distinction between how the character views herself and how others see her, with her appearing \\"very stern and rigid, perhaps even humorless\\" despite the occasional \\"surprise\\" of a \\"wry comment\\" or some small sarcasm. Her voice actor in the games, Miranda Raison, called the character a \\"toughie\\", yet noted her vulnerable side. Raison described her as \\"not just masculine, she's just a girl who's not a girly girl\\". Both Raison and Gaider noted her hidden sense of romanticism, with Gaider saying that she hides the things she holds passion for due to placing them \\"on display\\" feeling very unseemly. ==Conception and creation== BioWare needed a strong character in order to \\"carry\\" the story of Dragon Age II, where she acts as an interrogator. This meant she had to be \\"powerful\\", \\"forceful\\", and \\"a little bit angry\\". Dragon Age II itself was a sequel to 2009 game Dragon Age: Origins. For the games, British actress Miranda Raison was chosen to voice Cassandra. Raison uses a made-up accent to voice the character, reflective of her Nevarran origins. Cassandra was originally written by Jennifer Hepler, though then-lead writer David Gaider took up the character after Hepler left the company during the development of Inquisition. Her hidden romanticism proved an aspect which Gaider felt made her \\"quite fun\\" to write, and he commented he had yet to make a character quite like her. BioWare built upon the characters before deciding who the romance options would be, and felt it important to try to make each romantic arc unique and not a retread of past plots. Mike Laidlaw said, \\"In a lot of ways, I think she represents the opportunity to grow by understanding [and not] getting increasingly lost in the noise of Dragon Ages rising chaos.\\" Visual design left The character was intended to be \\"severe and dramatic\\", with associate art director Matt Rhodes likening her appearance to being \\"queen of the vampires\\". The in-universe country Cassandra came from influenced her appearance, Nevarra being closer to the equator and Nevarrans generally having darker-tone skin and black hair as a result. Art director Matthew Goldman attributed her with an \\"austere\\" beauty, reflective of her intelligence and devotion to good. Creative director Mike Laidlaw stated: :\\"And then, obviously, we wanted to make sure she was hot. To dial her to eleven, to make her absolutely gorgeous, really enticing‚Äîyet at the same time, she's powerful, she's strong, she's wearing platemail.\\" In the series, Cassandra has \\"hair as short as her temper\\". The character was originally designed with long hair. However, the long-hair proved difficult to manage, especially in Dragon Age II where the character was in dark lighting for almost the entirety of the game. The shorter hair tried to remain \\"severe\\" while working better in the game engine and not causing bugs with her armor. Improving the lighting on characters was one of the \\"main goals\\" of the second game.\\"Her face became all about her aggression. Through the angle of her facial structure to the angle of her ears. It all became about giving her a strong aggressive forward visual flow.\\" ‚ÄîCasper Konefal Cassandra's face has various elements to keep her unique, such as \\"narrow eyebrows, heart-shaped face, strong jaw, darker lips, and walnut hazel eyes\\". The choice of walnut hazel eye colour served to further her authoritative look, appearing a bit warmer than blue eyes and giving her a harder edge. Similarly, her portraiture is heavily angular, to reflect her \\"hard\\" demeanor. For her appearance in Inquisition, concept artist Casper Konefal decided to ignore the subjective criteria of \\"beauty\\", and try to focus her design on presenting her \\"power and authority\\", trying to give her \\"a strong aggressive forward visual flow\\". The character is depicted in heavy armor, fitting in with her \\"tough\\" character. Cassandra's \\"uniformed, practical attire\\" also acts to show her lack of love for \\"comfort or convenience\\". BioWare wanted the Seeker armor to be \\"instantly recognisable\\" or \\"iconic\\". The Seeker symbol, emblazoned on the armor, is an altered version of the Chantry symbol (a sun) with an eye in the middle, representative of the Chantry \\"seeking the truth\\". Her armor lets her cast a \\"strong and graphic\\" silhouette, again illustrating her \\"hard\\" demeanor. Dragon Age II uses an updated version of Origins Eclipse engine, internally called the \\"Lycium engine\\", with some graphical improvements. The artstyle was intended to be more distinct and \\"stylized yet still realistic\\". Dragon Age II has improved \\"facial topology\\" in order to make emoting more expressive, improved facial texture density, and a more realistic eye shader. The compression settings for textures were also altered, allowing for \\"higher visual quality per asset\\". ZBrush was used for characters in both Dragon Age II and Inquisition, and proved useful in creating head variations. Every head in Dragon Age II, Cassandra's included, is based from a single mesh with a morph applied, which allowed the mesh to be \\"stretched and pulled\\" in different ways to create a unique character. The change to the Frostbite engine for Inquisition allowed for increased visual fidelity, and enhanced model details with more sophisticated shaders and a \\"realistic surface response\\". Unlike the second game, in Inquisition party members may equip any armor barring class and other restrictions; however, each armor looks different on characters, with each having their own \\"themes\\". Cassandra and the other followers are divided into two bases and two bitpacks that can be interchanged, with each part of the bitpacks having three separate \\"progressions\\", and colors and material may be varied. BioWare wished to retain the feel of a character while still giving a sense of advancement. In the lead-up to Inquisitions release, BioWare released character kits of Cassandra and Varric in order to assist cosplayers. ==Appearances== Dragon Age II Cassandra first appeared in Dragon Age II, in 2011, as part of the game's frame narrative. The game opens with her interrogation of Varric Tethras, a party member in the game, who then recounts the story of Hawke, the refugee-turned-\\"Champion of Kirkwall\\" and player character. As the story plays out, Cassandra occasionally interrupts to either call Varric out on lying at certain parts or to offer commentary on the events. At the end of the game, it is revealed that the Circle of Magi and the Templar Order, a Chantry group dedicated to watching over or \\"imprisoning\\" mages, have both gone rogue and are warring in the streets, and Cassandra seeks Hawke to help resolve the conflict, no longer blaming them for starting the conflict. Laidlaw commented that, in his view, Cassandra has in some ways the \\"biggest transformative arc\\" of all the characters in the game. Dawn of the Seeker left Cassandra next appeared in Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker, a CGI-anime film by Funimation released in 2012, which explores her backstory. The choice to center the film on Cassandra as it tied into the themes the series had been building, giving \\"a new take\\" on the events and groups of the franchise. Mike McFarland, voice director of the film, felt the character had been well received in the second game, so seeing her again would be good for fans. The choice to use a female protagonist was to Laidlaw a \\"non-issue\\", calling the Dragon Age setting largely gender-blind and placing her gender secondary to being a \\"badass\\". Unlike the games, Cassandra is voiced by Chiaki Kuriyama in the Japanese film and Colleen Clinkenbeard in the English dub. The character's design and personality differs in the film. Dawn takes place after Cassandra has become a Seeker, but before she has become Right Hand of the Divine. Being younger, Funimation lengthened the character's hair and lightened her make-up in order to give her a \\"more innocent\\" appearance. A ponytail was chosen for its practicality, as it wouldn't obstruct vision during a fight. In addition to her heavy armor, the need for stealth led to the creation of light armor for the character. Early sketches explored the possible designs for these armors. Laidlaw called the Cassandra of Dawn of the Seeker \\"a little more emotionally tempestuous\\", someone more \\"vulnerable\\" physically and emotionally than in Dragon Age II. The film begins just before the Seekers launch an attack against a group of mages who have kidnapped a young girl for an unknown ritual, with Cassandra being warned to watch her fury by Byron, a fellow Seeker and a mentor/paternal figure to her. The Seekers successfully rescue the girl and Cassandra fells the mage's dragon, though the leader of the rogue mages escapes. Later, Cassandra finds Byron taking the girl from the other Seekers, and accompanies him as he warns of a possible conspiracy. The rogue mages ambush them, kill Byron, and re-kidnap the girl, with Byron's last words telling Cassandra \\"Hate can only breed more hate\\". Cassandra discovers another mage in the woods, named Regalyan (nicknamed \\"Galyan\\"), who claims to be unaffiliated with the other mages and is instead a contact of Byron, intending to take the girl to safe place. Cassandra is initially suspicious of him for being a mage, but after they escape from the other Seekers and he heals her wounds with magic, she becomes less hostile. Eventually, they discover a templar to be conspiring with the rogue mages' help. They try to tell the High Seeker of the plot, but the templar kills him and frames them from it, capturing them and slating them for execution. Galyan's fellowist loyalist mages rescue them, and reveal that the templar is part of a conspiracy to assassinate the current Divine, which would transfer power to the current Right Hand, also in on the plot. Cassandra confronts the templar, but spares him to be taken into custody, citing Byron's last words. However, she kills him when he suddenly gets up and tries to attack her by surprise. The rogue mages then complete their ritual and send dragons to attack the Divine and other high-ranking Chantry members in the middle of a festival, and a massive fight breaks out, with Cassandra saving the Divine and taking out the dragon killing her. At the end, Cassandra is named the \\"Hero of Orlais\\", and the Divine's new Right Hand. Inquisition alt= Cassandra is one of two returning characters from Dragon Age II in 2014's Inquisition, the third main game in the series, along with Varric. BioWare wanted returning characters to make sense, and had to ask questions like \\"How did they grow? How did they change in the intervening years?\\" Laidlaw noted how, after the events of Dragon Age II Cassandra's opinions could change, while Gaider commented that \\"what we find in Inquisition is a Cassandra who's realizing the world doesn't work like she believed it does\\", saying that she is walking a path of doubt. In contrast to II, Raison commented that the Cassandra in Inquisition has a more human, if \\"not exactly softer\\", side to her, and called her \\"angrier\\" in the second game. Cassandra is a party member and a possible love interest if the player chooses to play a male Inquisitor. The character is of the Warrior class, designed around close-range combat, and by default uses a sword and shield combination though this can be changed if the player wishes. Unlike other party members, she has access to the \\"Templar\\" skill tree, which is based around nullifying magical effects and fighting demons, one type of enemy found in the game, as well as providing support and buffs for other party members. The character is introduced interrogating the Inquisitor at the start of the game, who is the sole survivor of a large explosion that has ripped open the sky, causing demons to fall out, and killed the Divine, many mages, and many templars during their peace talks. She immediately joins the party and, after the Inquisitor temporarily seals the \\"Breach\\" in the sky, protests the player's innocence and forms the Inquisition, breaking away from the Chantry. Depending on the player's choices throughout the game, she may at its end be crowned Divine. If so, she ushers in an age of reform. Her personal quest, which each party member has, concerns her discovery that the other Seekers are all going missing. If the player chooses to complete it, they discover that Lord-Seeker Lucius has been luring the Seekers away to be killed, intending to wipe out the order due to their duplicity, attributing the ongoing mage/templar war to them. Lucis hands Cassandra a book full of Seeker secrets, and after Lucius is defeated and the Inquisitor and Cassandra return to base, Cassandra reads it and discovers the Seekers had knowledge vital to stopping the war. The player may choose to encourage her to rebuild the Seekers reformed, leave them, or let her make her own decision. ==Reception== Dawn of the Seeker received mixed to negative reviews, as did Cassandra's character. Zac Bertschy, of Anime News Network, called its characters uninteresting, saying there was no given reason to care about Cassandra other than her being \\"so brash, serious and in need of an ass to kick\\". Japanator.com's Pedro Cortes similarly criticized her character, saying she was only differentiated from other characters by her \\"hate of anything magic\\" from her \\"tragic past\\", though called her design \\"visually appealing\\". Both criticised the animation in the film. In a positive review of the film, Holly Ellingwood for activeAnime compared her appearance to that Bo from Lost Girl and praised \\"the expression in her eyes\\", saying the character \\"looked fierce and every bit the dangerous and elite knight she is supposed to be\\". Prior to the release of Inquisition, Kimberly Wallace of Game Informer considered the potential of her return to the series, and thought she could be interesting due to the mystery surrounding her, what she could bring to the group, and how she could develop. After Inquisitions release, Cassandra received a positive reception. Ray Ivey of Just Adventure noted how, while she seemed \\"cold and unappealing at first\\", she grew on him. Joe Juba, also from Game Informer, called the character his new \\"Garrus\\", a popular party member in the Mass Effect series. He appreciated her \\"detailed and believable character\\", as well as how she took a more measured approach instead of dealing in extremities. Wallace also included the character in their list of \\"the 10 best sidekicks\\" in 2014, commenting \\"she battles with you, but she's also an amazing adviser.\\" Inquisition got attention for its female characters. Danielle Riendeau, writing for Polygon, praised the female characters, stating that they all were \\"written with care, attention to detail, and enormous respect\\". Susan Arendt noted how the majority of the Inquisition's leaders were female, and how this was not made a point in Inquisition. Arendt commented that had Cassandra been a man, little would change, \\"but that's exactly why it's so encouraging for her to be a woman\\". GamesRadar's Ashley Reed and Andy Hartup listed her as one of the \\"most inspirational female characters in games\\", writing \\"Cassandra's an unstoppable storm, but one with a calm and quiet eye, too.\\" ==See also== *List of Dragon Age characters *Women warriors in literature and culture ==References *Cassandra Pentaghast on the official Dragon Age: Inquisition website *Character Kits of Cassandra and Varric on the official BioWare blog * Category:Dragon Age characters Category:Fantasy video game characters Category:Female characters in video games Category:Fictional royalty Category:Religious worker characters in video games Category:Video game characters introduced in 2011 Category:Video game sidekicks Category:Video game nobility Category:Woman soldier and warrior characters in video games ","title":"Cassandra Pentaghast"},{"id":"46310569","text":"Tibet in Song is a 2009 documentary film written, produced, and directed by Ngawang Choephel.

Although he was Passamaquoddy, he was widely versed in Wabanaki tradition, as Wabanaki was the overall surrounding language and more general culture of not just Maine, but the Canadian and New England area, home to several indigenous tribes during this time period (a decent amount of which still exist today, including the Passamaquoddy peoples, Mitchell's native tribe). ==Political career== As a tribal representative, he is most well-known for his 1887 speech delivered to the Maine State Legislature, that illuminated prior treaties guaranteeing Passamaquoddy land to the Passamaquoddy people, in order to provide a civil argument asking the government to recognize the Passamaquoddy right to hunt and fish, etc. on their own land (or rather, land that had been unlawfully sold). According to some, Mitchell is the first tribal member to have written in the Passamaquoddy language. ==Literary translations== Naturally, when many original manuscripts were destroyed in a fire that happened at John Dyneley Prince's home in 1911, Prince asked Mitchell to recreate these documents from memory. Not only did Prince and Mitchell share a community, but Mitchell was a known consultant for Prince. Earlier in Mitchell's life, he had served as consultant for Charles Leland, particularly on his text The Algonquin Legends of New England, published in 1884. Mitchell relied heavily on this text in order to reproduce the old Wabanki tales, exploits and adventures of Koluskap; the majority of Mitchell's recreation is said to be merely a translation of Leland's work from English into Passamaquoddy. These translations unfortunately contained a significant bias on the part of Leland. He believed that the Wabanaki people were connected culturally, and historically to the Norse. Many of his translations were skewed to align with this theory. It is also said that Mitchell is the first to have ever written, or at least to have kept written documentation in Passamaquoddy (using his own spelling and language system). John Dyneley Prince and Lewis Mitchell switch back and forth between their native languages, respectively. One chapter is written by Lewis in Passamaquoddy, the following reiterated by Prince in English. ==An excerpt of Mitchell's translations== Explanation In the excerpt from Prince's collaboration with Mitchell above, it exhibits lyrics that speak of summoning spirits and animals/creatures. Mitchell was a highly distinguished member of his community, yet he was still quite in touch with what some may consider his more \\"mythical\\" roots. Mitchell was regarded as an intelligent man, one of few who could write and translate Wabanaki into English and vice versa. He was a member of the Maine State Legislature, spoke in the courtroom to advocate for Passamaquoddy rights, and was often sought out for his expertise and consultation by other highly regarded members of the white community (like Leland and Prince). At the same time, he still published stories (particularly that of Koluskap) right along with his more governmental and reformative letters and documents directed toward Maine's government. This is notable because Mitchell was able to maintain his status in and around his community with not only his people, but with white people as well. He also wrote stories that some may consider either fictional or absurd, remaining true to his ancestry while advocating for the Passamaquoddy people with great vivacity and conviction. Mitchell was known for his professionalism intermixed with his heritage, and he was able to maintain that status amongst his colleagues, peers, opposers and supporters of both races. He is known for Native publications that express his cultural background and a more non-conventional form of expression, at least in the white world (for Native Americans, these stories, poems and songs are just as relevant if not more than any court system that has been implemented since the creation of these generational stories that Indigenous peoples, in this case the Passamaquoddy, and the Wabanaki on a grander scale, have passed down as rightful knowledge for as long as they have existed). ==Personal life== Other than his government position and writing, Mitchell was known for his skill at canoeing. During hunting season, Mitchell would be hired to take hunting parties out to areas good for porpoise and seals. The canoes he used and built were made of white birch bark. According to the Mount Desert Herald publication in July 1881, Mitchell made the record of traveling 60 miles in a mere 12 hours around Mount Desert Island in Maine. Also, according to passersby in a tugboat, Mitchell was seen waving his arms in what looked like distress, only to be in need of a book of matches. This practice was known as the Canoe Club, and Passamaquoddy were known for their expertise in building and manning these traditionally constructed paddles and canoes. Not only was Mitchell revered in both pen and the courtroom, but he was a skilled and reverenced man in his community, known for his excellency in cultural skill and knowledge. == References == Category:1847 births Category:1930 deaths Category:Members of the Maine House of Representatives Category:Native American state legislators in Maine Category:Passamaquoddy people Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"Lewis Mitchell"},{"id":"46310723","text":"Cyrus Leopold \\"Leo\\" Sulzberger (aka Cyrus Lindauer Sulzberger;WBIS Online: Cyrus Leopold Sulzberger (JBA) and Cyrus Lindauer Sulzberger (ABA).

It is native to northern Australia and the trans-Fly River region of New Guinea. It is a fish with a vertically flat, narrow body and a standard length generally between , with large specimens reaching long. It generally eats water fleas and other small invertebrates. This fish is considered to be a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although it could suffer from habitat degradation due to feral pigs and invasive water plants such as the water hyacinth. The fish is suitable for aquarium use in tanks containing other non-aggressive species. ==Taxonomy== French naturalist Francis de Castelnau described this species as Pseudoambassis macleayi in 1878, from specimens collected from the Norman River near the Gulf of Carpentaria in northern Australia. The species was named in honour of William Macleay for his important contributions to fish taxonomy. Castelnau placed it in a new genus, separate to Ambassis, due to its lack of a recumbent spine (spine laying against the dorsal surface) in front of its dorsal fin. Allan Riverstone McCulloch placed it in the genus Ambassis in 1929. Gilbert Percy Whitley made it the type species of the genus Austrochanda, calling it Austrochanda macleayi, in 1935. The species was subsequently returned to Ambassis in 1989 by J. R. Paxton, D. F. Hoese, G. R. Allen, and J. E. Hanley in the Zoological Catalogue of Australia. Common names include Macleay's glassfish, Macleay's glass perchlet, Macleay's perchlet and reticulated glassfish. ==Description== left Macleay's glassfish is a moderately large ambassid that may grow to a standard length (SL) of , but is usually between . Males tend to be larger than females. The body is deep, at close to half the SL, with a large head and a maxilla (upper jaw) that extends beyond the front edge of the large eye. The first dorsal fin is tall at up to 40% SL, with the second spine longer than the first; within the anal fin, the third spine is longer than the second. Colour varies from a partly transparent olive-green to a dark brown/green or a golden/yellow, with the lower surfaces generally paler. Scales have a darker edge giving a reticulated pattern, especially on the upper half. The caudal (tail), anal and dorsal fins are dusky with off-white to translucent spines and white to yellow rays; the caudal and anal fins may have a thin reddish or dark margin; pelvic fins are white and the pectoral fins are transparent often with a dark mark at the base of the fin. A. macleayi may be differentiated from other fish of the genus Ambassis by the relatively deep body, high gill raker count, interrupted lateral line and the dark spot at the base of the pectoral fins. ==Distribution and habitat== Ambassis macleayi occurs from the Carson River in the Kimberley region of Western Australia across the north of Australia to the Jardine River in Cape York, although the distribution in north-east Queensland is patchy. In New Guinea, the fish is found in the trans-Fly region, a lowland area of savanna and grasslands in the south of the island. Preferred habitat consists of streams and swamps, tending towards muddy lagoons at the end of the dry season to much further afield by the end of the wet season including lowland lagoons and the main channel of rivers and streams in the escarpments surrounding the Gulf of Carpentaria. It is typically found in heavily vegetated habitats with macrophytes, woody debris and leaf-litter and rarely at a depth of more than 1 m (3 ft). The fish is found in less vegetated water than other species of this genus and shows a preference for submerged rather than emergent vegetation. It has been found over all substrates, most commonly sand and mud then clay, gravel, leaves, rocks and boulders. Despite high levels of connectivity during the wet season, very little dispersion of A. macleayi occurs between adjacent catchments. This has been backed up by studies showing a high degree of genetic diversity between catchments. As a result, this species is unable to rapidly recolonise areas after a disturbance and it has been recommended that any conservation of the species should be on a catchment-by-catchment basis rather than across its entire range. ==Breeding and lifecycle== Ambassis macleayi is a moderately fecund fish with large females producing up to around 2,300 small (0.3 mm) eggs which expand on contact with water. A. macleayi is an obligate plant spawner, with the eggs adhering to aquatic vegetation as they descend through the water column. The fish spawn in batches of several hundred eggs over a period of a week. The eggs hatch in 21‚Äì23 hours at . The newly hatched larvae are poorly developed but mature quickly, are around on hatching and at first feeding after only three days, and having absorbed the yolk sac after just two days. The young fry attain a length of around upon completion of metamorphosis at 18 days. Reports vary as to the age at maturity, with some claiming 3 months and others 12 months. Spawning occurs all year round with a slight increase at the beginning of the wet season. ==Ecology== A. macleayi are classified as microcrustacivores (eaters of micro crustaceans). The diet generally contains about 70% tiny cladoceran crustaceans known as water fleas, with about 20% of the diet being aquatic insects, especially chironomid larvae. This ratio is reportedly quite different in the Normanby River, where cladocerans make up only 10% of the diet compared to around 70% chironomids. The species demonstrates a flexible foraging strategy with stomach contents including aerial and terrestrial invertebrates, small fish, other microinvertabrates, terrestrial plant matter and algae as well up to 15% unidentifiable material. Studies have shown that like other species of a similar size, A. macleayi will only patrol areas of open water with low predator count of such species as barramundi and Neoarius midgleyi. It is otherwise confined to areas of heavy cover and is often found in turbid water. ==Relationship with humans== The species may be kept as an aquarium fish with a temperature range of , pH from 6.0 to 9.7, and hardness around 100 ppm. In Queensland there is a possession limit of 20 individuals for this species. A. macleayi is non-aggressive and suitable for larger community tanks and coexists well with other fish that are not small enough to be considered prey. A naturally schooling fish, it is reportedly best kept in a group of six or more. Occasional live feed, such as brine shrimp or daphnia, is recommended by the Australia New Guinea Fishes Association. The Queensland Government recommends Macleay's glassfish for mosquito control in dams within the Gulf of Carpentaria drainage division. In 1991 a study noted that A. macleayi was one of three species of freshwater fish most suitable for Uranium toxicity testing in freshwater environments in northern Australia. ==Conservation status== This fish is classified as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature on their Redlist. A wide tolerance of poor water conditions and wide distribution, although patchy in parts, make the populations of A. macleayi resilient. There is, however, the potential for harm from extreme reduction in water quality from such threats as feral pig foraging (increasing the turbidity of waterways thus reducing the light available for aquatic plant growth) and infestation by exotic plants such as water hyacinth. == References  * Fishes of Australia : Ambassis macleayi macleayi Category:Freshwater fish of Australia Category:Freshwater fish of Papua New Guinea Category:Fish described in 1878 Category:Taxa named by Francis de Laporte de Castelnau ","title":"Ambassis macleayi"},{"id":"46310771","text":"The Belko Experiment is a 2016 American horror thriller film directed by Greg McLean and written by James Gunn, who also produced the film with Peter Safran. It stars John Gallagher Jr., Tony Goldwyn, Adria Arjona, John C. McGinley, Melonie Diaz, Josh Brener and Michael Rooker. The film follows eighty Americans working abroad for a company named Belko Industries in Bogot√°, Colombia. One day after they arrive at work, they are locked inside the building, and a mysterious voice announces that they have to start killing each other. Filming began on June 1, 2015 in Bogot√°, Colombia and concluded the following month. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2016 and was released in the United States on March 17, 2017 by Blumhouse Tilt and Orion Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics and has grossed $11 million worldwide, against its $5 million budget. ==Plot== Mike Milch (John Gallagher Jr.), an employee of Belko Industries, while driving to work is stopped by street vendors selling \\"lucky\\" handmade dolls. Barry Norris (Tony Goldwyn), also of Belko Industries, arrives at the office building in Bogot√°, Colombia, to find unfamiliar security guards turning away the local Colombian staff at the gate. New employee Dany Wilkins (Melonie Diaz) reports for her first day on the job and is told that a tracking device is implanted in the base of every Belko employee's skull in case something happens to them. Evan Smith (James Earl), Belko's head security guard, does not know who the new security guards are. Once all the employees show up, a voice on the intercom instructs them to kill two of their co- workers, or else there will be consequences. Several staff attempt to flee the building, but steel shutters seal off the walls and doors, locking them all in. They ignore the announcement at first, believing it to be a sick prank, but after the set time ends and the two have not been killed, four employees die when explosives hidden in their trackers detonate and blow their heads apart. Mike attempts to remove his tracker with a box cutter. Warned by the voice that he too will die unless he stops, he gives up. The group is told that unless thirty of them are dead within two hours, sixty will be killed. They split into two factions, one led by Mike, who believes that there should be no killing, and one led by chief operating officer boss Barry Norris who intends to follow the directions in order to save himself. Barry and his group, consisting of executive Wendell (John C. McGinley), as well as employees Terry (Owain Yeoman), Antonio (Benjamin Byron Davis), and Bradley (Andres Suarez) attempt to burn off the lock of the armory in order to gain access to its weapons. Mike and his group, including his girlfriend, Leandra Florez (Adria Arjona), Evan and employees Keith (Josh Brener), Leota (Gail Bean), Peggy (Rusty Schwimmer), Vince (Brent Sexton) and Roberto (David Del Rio), try to hang banners from the roof as a call for help, but soldiers outside shoot at them. Barry, Wendell, and Terry ambush the group in the stairway, kill Evan and take his keys to the armory. With his group now armed, Barry and Wendell select thirty people, including Mike and Peggy, forcing them to kneel in a line. He begins executing them with a gunshot to the back of the head. Dany, who has been hiding in the basement, sees what is happening and shuts off the building's lights before Mike and several others can be killed. The employees immediately run for cover as Barry and his group start firing, killing several more people. However, Bradley and Antonio are ganged upon and killed by the employees. During this, Dany goes into the elevator shaft with Roberto. Barry and Wendell hunt down the fleeing employees as the voice informs them that only twenty-nine have been killed. Then the two-hour time limit runs out. The voice states that 31 more people will die, including Terry, Leota, Peggy, and Keith, leaving only 16 survivors. They are then informed by the voice that, as a final task, the employee who has killed the most people within an hour will be spared. Barry finds Dany and Roberto in the elevator shaft. Still, Dany escapes while Roberto is crushed and killed in the elevator shaft. Leandra finds two employees, Marty (Sean Gunn) and Chet (Abraham Benrubi), collecting the un-exploded trackers from the heads of people who have died by other methods. They tell her that they are planning to use them to blow up the wall. However, they are killed by Wendell. Leandra kills Wendell, leaving the final six survivors: Vince, Mike, Barry, Dany, Leandra, and cafeteria lady Leezle, who is killed shortly afterward. Barry shoots Vince and Dany, killing them, and also shoots Leandra. With her dying breath, she proclaims her love to Mike. In a rage, Mike fights and then kills Barry by crushing his skull with a tape dispenser. The building is then unsealed, as he is the last survivor, and the soldiers escort him to the hangar next door. There, he meets the owner of the Voice (Gregg Henry), who says that they're part of an international organisation studying human behaviour. As he and his colleagues begin to question Mike about his emotional and mental state, Mike notices a panel of switches that correspond to the eighty employees. Having planted the trackers that Marty collected on the soldiers and the Voice, he flips every remaining active switch except his own. The trackers explode, killing the soldiers and wounding the Voice, before Mike grabs a gun and kills the remaining scientists. The Voice attempts to reason with Mike and appeal to his moral beliefs, but Mike kills him. He then leaves the warehouse in a state of shock. The view zooms out to reveal that Mike is one of many sole survivors from similar experiments, being watched by another group through security cameras. A new voice states, \\"end stage one\\" and \\"commence stage two.\\" ==Cast== *John Gallagher Jr. as Mike Milch, an employee at Belko Industries *Tony Goldwyn as Barry Norris, the COO of Belko and an ex- special forces soldier *Adria Arjona as Leandra Florez, Norris' assistant *John C.

Initially, Gunn wrote the film (as The Belco Experiment) prior to directing the 2010 film Super, although he backed away from the project once it got greenlit, owing to getting a divorce around the same time. Gunn says, \\"I just wanted to be around my friends and family. I didn't want to go shoot this thing that was about people who loved and cared about each other being forced into killing each other. It just didn't seem to be the way I wanted to spend the next few months of my life. So I backed out of it.\\" As Gunn's name became bigger and bigger, he had \\"kind of forgotten about it\\" until he received a call from Jon Glickman at MGM asking if he would still be interested in making it. Much of the cast was announced in May 2015, including John Gallagher Jr., Tony Goldwyn, and Melonie Diaz. More joined the cast in June, including David Del Rio, Stephen Blackehart, Josh Brener, and Rusty Schwimmer. Principal photography on the film began on June 1, 2015, in Bogot√°, Colombia. and concluded on July 12, 2015. ==Release== The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2016.

They are better known as the DAF 2800, 3300 and 3600. The cab was a wider development of the F218, DAF's first tilt cab placed on among others 2500. The names reflect the cab width in centimetres, at respectively. The cab was also used by Hungary's R√ÅBA for various applications.Peck, p. 31 ==History== Introduced at IAA in September 1973 the '2800' was DAF's replacement for the luxurious, but certainly not outdated 2600. The DAF 2800 had the first European intercooled turbodiesel under the hood of its new tilt cab. The 11.6 litre DKS engine produced 320 HP and 1260 Nm. Other engine choices were the turbocharged 280 HP DKTD and the naturally aspirated 250 HP DKA. While based on the modular design of the 1970 F218 cab, the front of F241 cab was redesigned and the new wider cab required the use of a set of three wipers, a distinguishing characteristic of the range. Gearboxes with 12 or 16 speed were offered from ZF, or 13 speed and twin splitter from Fuller. Cabs and engines were also delivered to Ginaf, the Dutch manufacturer of all wheel drive trucks. The DAF 3300 In 1975 the more comfortable yet \\"Superliner\\" model was added to the lineup in Britain; these luxurious trucks were aimed at users plying the route to the Middle East. They were converted by a caravan builder in Englands West Country.Peck, p. 33 To meet Swedens safety standards since 1975 every F241 and F218 cab got high tension steel adjustment. To meet regulation in Italy that put a lower limit for the number of horsepower per GCWR at 44 ton, output of the exceptional 2800 DKSI was in 1977 boosted to 353 HP and 1410 Nm. This special version 2800 was only sold in Italy and was continued to be supplied until the Ati engines came. Early Eighties The lineup was further modernized in 1980 when the cabs got a more luxuries interior and with a slight grille rearrangement whereby the \\"2800\\" lettering was moved into the upper grille and with an option for the extra efficient 2800 DKSE engine. 1980 was also the year in which R√ÅBA began using the cab for most of their trucks. Also in 1980 bonnetted N2800 6x4 NAT (drawbar) or NTT (tractor) was introduced, with new heavy tandem boogie, mainly for export to Africa and Middle-East. In February 1982 at RAI the 3300 model was introduced, with a more quiet and clean DKX 1160 engine, with , added with more sound insulation in the modified cab. Although sold well everywhere in Europe Daf was looking for niches in the market to sell more units. Examples were the topsleeper in 1982. A shortcab with sleeper above it, for high volume transport. Followed in September 1984 by the famous 3300 Space Cab. ATi In September 1985 DAF introduced the legendary DAF 3600 ATi with \\"Advanced turbo intercooling\\". DAF had taken several efficiency measurements at the engine for lower friction, and driveline including new hypoid drive axle, whereby greater fuel efficiency and power was reached. It helped boost sales of the range until it was superseded. The most powerful iteration of the new ATi engines was the 1160 DKZ. With DAF 2900 Turbo ==Revival== In 1987 the all- new DAF 95 arrived, meaning the F241 series was replaced and discontinued in Europe. However, DAF recognized a gap between the medium-duty 2500/2700 range and the new 95-series, and accordingly revived the F241 in 1990. The new 2900 and 3200 models were spartanly equipped models mainly targeting African, Asian and South American customers.Peck, p. 46 As indicated by the names, were on offer. DAF Trucks Australia however continued assembling the 3600 for a while, including 428 HP WS315 Ati engine, from the European 95. The new front design cabs which mimicked of the new 95 did not last long, and the F241 cab being taken out of production in 1995 after only a few hundred had been built. ==References== * F241 Category:Vehicles introduced in 1973 ","title":"DAF F241 series"},{"id":"46310854","text":"The Mercy is a 2017 British biographical drama film, directed by James Marsh and written by Scott Z.

He attended the public schools of his native city. Following a period of attendance at the University of Michigan, he graduated from Columbia University in 1900 with both a Bachelor of Laws and a Master of Arts degree. In that same year, he was admitted to the New York Bar. After practicing in New York for about two years, he returned to Pittsburgh in 1902. In 1906, he was appointed to a position as Assistant City Solicitor, by Mayor George W. Guthrie. He was elected as a Judge of the County Court in 1911 for a term beginning in 1912.

However, an anomaly in the experiment resulted in Hilda creating one of the world's strongest Strega. Through a series of covert dealings, Dirk Eberwein got his hands on Orphelia and she became a student at Le Wolfe. Her sheer power alone has allowed her to become the two-time champion of the solo tournament, the Lindvolus, defeating even the Sigrdr√≠fa, Sylvia Lyyneheym. She is the top-ranked student in the official charts of Le Wolfe as well as the unofficial ranking websites.

She is the world's top idol and is one of the strongest Strega in the history of Asterisk, the runner-up of the previous Lindvolus, losing only because Orphelia Landlufen was in the competition. Due to her popularity, she usually goes out in disguise. She is also in love with Ayato, the first of the five main heroines to realize that fact. ; : Another childhood friend of Ayato's, Yuzuhi reunited with Ayato in the seventh light novel volume.

The clip is used to attach it to the wearer's clothing. The electronic personal dosimeter (EPD) is a modern electronic dosimeter for estimating uptake of ionising radiation dose of the individual wearing it for radiation protection purposes. The electronic personal dosimeter has the advantages over older types that it has a number of sophisticated functions, such as continuous monitoring which allows alarm warnings at preset levels and live readout of dose accumulated. It can be reset to zero after use, and most models allow near field electronic communications for automatic reading and resetting. They are typically worn on the outside of clothing, such as on the chest or torso to represent dose to the whole body. This location monitors exposure of most vital organs and represents the bulk of body mass. These are especially useful in high dose areas where residence time of the wearer is limited due to dose constraints. ==PIN Dosimeter== PIN diodes are used to quantify the radiation dose for military and personnel applications. ==MOSFET dosimeters== MOSFET dosimeters are now used as clinical dosimeters for radiotherapy radiation beams. The main advantages of MOSFET devices are: 1\\\\. The MOSFET dosimeter is direct reading with a very thin active area (less than 2 Œºm). 2\\\\. The physical size of the MOSFET when packaged is less than 4 mm. 3\\\\. The post radiation signal is permanently stored and is dose rate independent.

Trbojevic has played for Prime Minister's XIII, Australia and New South Wales. ==Background== Trbojevic was born in New South Wales, Australia. He played his junior rugby league for Mona Vale Juniors, before being signed by the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles. As a youngster, he also played Australian Rules football at a high level and was placed in the Sydney Swans Talent Academy as a teenager but eventually decided to give the game away to focus on rugby league.How Manly Sea Eagles young gun Tom Trbojevic was almost lost to rugby league Despite playing for both Australia in junior representative teams, Trbojevic scored 94.3% on his HSC. He is currently attending Macquarie University where he is studying a double degree in Applied Finance and Economics.Jake and Tom Trbojevic are the future of the Manly Sea Eagles Trbojevic is the younger brother of fellow Manly Warringah Sea Eagles player Jake Trbojevic and brother of Ben Trbojevic. ==Playing career== Early career In 2014 and 2015, Trbojevic played for the Manly-Warringah in their NYC side. In June 2014, he played for the New South Wales Under-18s team. On 25 September 2014, he re-signed with Manly on a two-year contract. 2015 Trbojevic started 2015 playing fullback for Manly's NYC team and crossed for 4 tries in the opening game of the season against the Parramatta Eels at Pirtek Stadium. He continued to play a starring role in the Under 20's as Manly won its first four games of the season until injuries forced first grade coach Geoff Toovey to promote him to make his NRL debut on the wing for Manly-Warringah in their round 5 game against the Canberra Raiders at the Lavington Sports Ground in Albury in country NSW. Although Manly ultimately lost the game 29-16, Trbojevic scored a try with only his second touch of the ball and later crossed for his second try on debut. Unfortunately, a high ankle injury suffered in the following round against the Penrith Panthers sidelined him for a number of weeks. On 28 April, along with older brother Jake and fellow local junior Clint Gutherson, Trbojevic extended his contract with Manly from the end of 2016 to the end of 2017. Due to the quality of the Manly backline which included representative players Brett Stewart, Jamie Lyon, Steve Matai, Peta Hiku and Jorge Taufua, Trbojevic has been forced to bide his time playing in the NYC while being used as an injury replacement winger for the Manly's NRL side. On 25 July against the New Zealand Warriors at the Mt Smart Stadium in Auckland, New Zealand while playing fullback in the NYC, Trbojevic had his second 4 try game of the season (giving him 14 in 7 NYC games in 2015), accumulating a NYC record 466 running metres for the game, prompting calls for him to be made a permanent first grade player. Two weeks before he had played his 7th first grade game, crossing for a double in Manly's 38-6 victory over the Gold Coast Titans, but was dropped for the next game against the North Queensland Cowboys in favour of returning New Zealand test centre Hiku. On 1 August following the Warriors game, he was again called into the NRL team as a replacement for Steve Matai who had been heavily concussed the week before against the Warriors. Trbojevic scored his third double of the season, including scooping up a loose ball and racing 70 metres to score the final try of the game, and played a starring role as Manly defeated the competition leading Brisbane Broncos 44-14 at the Central Coast Stadium in Gosford. Despite only having played only 8 games in first grade in 2015, all of them on the wing, Trbojevic's talent as a fullback was recognised when he was named in the position for Rugby League Week's 2015 NRL Rookie Team of the Year. He was also named at fullback in the 2015 NYC Team of the Year. Trbojevic's final game for Manly in 2015 was the Holden Cup Grand Final played on NRL Grand Final day. Although he had another strong game and scored his 29th try in 22 games for the year (21 tries from 13 games in the under-20s and 8 tries in 9 NRL games), the Sea Eagles went down to the minor premiers Penrith Panthers 34-18. 2016 On 1 February, Trbojevic was named in Manly's 2016 NRL Auckland Nines squad. Trbojevic would play 23 games for the club in 2016, missing only round 9 due to a high ankle sprain suffered in the Anzac Day match against the Newcastle Knights. Although hampered by the injury which would require corrective surgery at the end of the season, he continued playing and was rewarded mid-season when he and brother Jake were called into the New South Wales squad before Game 3 of the 2016 State of Origin series as development players. He would go on to score 10 tries for the Sea Eagles after taking over from Brett Stewart at fullback (following season ending knee surgery to Stewart). On 7 September he was named as the Roy Bull Best and Fairest for the Sea Eagles 2016 season.Tom Trbojevic wins Manly's top award 2017 With the injury enforced retirement of Brett Stewart, Trbojevic became Manly's first choice fullback for the 2017 NRL season. His form was such that he was predicted to be selected on the wing for New South Wales until suffering an injury in a game against the Brisbane Broncos on 13 May. Broncos halfback Kodi Nikorima put up a bomb which Trbojevic was forced to let bounce. With Brisbane winger David Mead flying through in his chase of the kick, Trbojevic was forced to leap to catch the ball and was tackled while in mid-air, coming down with his left leg buckling awkwardly underneath him.Manly Sea Eagles vs Brisbane Broncos, highlights.

In round 4, Trbojevic was taken from the field during Manly's win over South Sydney with a hamstring injury. Trbojevic subsequently missed out on the opening game of the 2019 State of Origin series. Trbojevic returned to the Manly side in Round 13 against North Queensland. After only 2 games back in the Manly team, Trbojevic was selected to play for New South Wales in Game 2 of the State of Origin series. On 23 June, Trbojevic scored a hat-trick as New South Wales defeated Queensland 38-6 at the new Perth Stadium. Trbojevic was retained for Game 3 of the 2019 State of Origin series which was won by New South Wales 26-20 at ANZ Stadium. It was the first time since 2005 that New South Wales had won back to back series. Manly's 2019 season was a story of success with Des Hasler resurgence, guiding the Manly team from 15th to 6th. While Trbojevic enjoyed success during the year with winning 10/12 of the games he played in, but the year was mostly defined but the two hamstring injures and the torn pectoral muscle he sustained during the regular season which stop him playing in Manly's finals series. https://www.nrl.com/news/2019/08/31/manly-lose-tom-trbojevic-to-shoulder- injury/ 2020 Trbojevic stated the 2020 NRL season off very well, recording solid performances against both the Melbourne Storm and Sydney Roosters. When the season resumed in round 3, his form continued against the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs scoring two tries and producing three try assists. By round 6, he was leading the Dally M tally before he conceded yet another hamstring injury (grade 2 strain), ruling him out for 13 weeks. He made his injury return in round 19 of the 2020 NRL season against the Gold Coast Titans, where the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles lost 24-42. During that match, he yet again injured himself, injuring his left shoulder in the 52nd minute, which ruled him out of their round 20 clash against the New Zealand Warriors, and the 2020 NRL State of Origin series.

He contributed to the early development of still lifes as an independent genre through his delicate rendering of banquets and sumptuous tabletop still lifes. ==Life== David Rijckaert II was born in Antwerp in 1586 as the oldest child of David Rijckaert the Elder and Catharina Rem. As the family was Protestant, young David was not baptized in a Catholic church. After the restrictions on Protestants became tighter, his parents reconverted to Catholicism and had David baptized in the Antwerp Cathedral following Catholic rites on 9 August 1589. This was a few days before they married each other for a second time in a Catholic church.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, p. 601-603 David Rijckaert II at the Netherlands Institute for Art History David the Elder was a brewer and a painter of wooden statues who had become a master of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1585.Bernadette Van Haute.

He married Catharina de Merre on 19 July 1608. The couple had at least two children: Catharina in 1610 and David III in 1612. Some records note a second daughter Martina born in 1616.David Rijckaert III at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Sleeping Silenus David Rijckaert II appears not to have achieved great success as a painter. He likely worked as an art dealer to supplement his income. He never had sufficient resources to buy a property. Nevertheless, he must have enjoyed a good reputation among fellow artists as the young Peter Paul Rubens collaborated with him on the Sleeping Silenus (circa 1611, Academy of Fine Arts Vienna). Ryckaert was tasked with adding the glasses, metalwork and porcelain to the composition of Rubens. A third artist painted in the grapes.[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/263303 Peter Paul Rubens and David Rijckaert (II) and follower of Frans Snijders, Bacchic scene with the dream of Silenus (?), 1611 Vienna, Akademie der bildenden K√ºnste Wien, record at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He died in 1642 in Antwerp where he was buried on 3 October of that year. After he was buried on 3 October 1642 his small estate was confiscated. David Rijckaert II was the teacher of his son David III, who became a prominent genre painter. Even though not registered as such at the Guild, Gonzales Coques was also his pupil and became a leading Antwerp portrait painter. He married his daughter Catharina.Gonzales Coques at the Netherlands Institute for Art History In addition, Carel Ruwaert was registered as his pupil in the guild year 1609‚Äì1610, Jan Speeck in 1611 and Fransiskus de Fonteyn in the guild year 1628‚Äì1629. ==Work== David Rijckaert II was earlier believed to have been a painter of landscapes as well as genre scenes. The current view is that he did not paint landscapes as the attribution of landscapes to him was the result of a mix-up with his brother Martin, a prominent landscape painter. The genre scenes formerly attributed to him are now held to be by the hand of his son David III. A stoneware ewer, a Berkemeyer, a conical glass in a goblet holder and confectionery on a silver platter It was only in 1995 when Christie's offered the Still life with shells with a nautilus, vases, glasses and Chinese porcelain, which was signed and dated 'DAVIDT.RYCKAERTS. / .1616.' for sale that the art historian Fred Meijer identified the artist of the piece as David Rijckaert II. This led to the conclusion that David Rijckaert II was in fact a specialist still life painter rather than a landscape or genre painter.David Rijckaert (II) (1586‚Äì1642), A stoneware ewer, a Berkemeyer and a conical glass in a bekerschroef, with confectionary in a silver platter, on a ledge at Christie‚Äôs David Rijckaert II remains to date a relatively mysterious and obscure artist since art historians are still in the process of putting together his ≈ìuvre from a few signed works. New attributions still occur such as in 2009 when the Still life with a lemon and capon in the Rijksmuseum Twenthe was attributed to Ryckaert.F.G. Meijer, 'Herkend: Een stilleven van David Rijckaet II', Magazine Rijksmuseum Twenthe 2009, nr. 1, p. 26-28 There are currently only about 15 still lifes attributed to David Rijckaert II. As his style is close to that of the leading Antwerp still life painters Osias Beert and Jacob Foppens van Es, some of his works were previously attributed to these two artists.David Rijckaert (II) (1586‚Äì1642), Still life with shells, a nautilus, vases, glasses and Chinese porcelain at Christie‚Äôs This is for instance the case with the Still life with lobster at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, formerly attributed to Osias Beert and the Still life with oysters, fruit, biscuits and ornamental tableware in the Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent, formerly attributed to Osias Beert and Jacob Foppens van Es.Still life with lobster at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Still life with oysters, fruit, biscuits and ornamental tableware at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Apples, pears, plums and other fruit with walnuts in a wan-li bowl The known works of David Rijckaert II fall into two categories: sumptuous still lifes of porcelain, expensive glassware, silverware, pewter dishes, etc. and so-called ‚Äòbanketjes‚Äô, i.e. banquet or breakfast pieces depicting food on a tabletop.David Rijckaert II (Antwerp, 1586 ‚Äì Antwerp, 1642), Still life with a Silver-gilt covered Cup, Glasses, a Plate of Oysters, a Capon and a Chinese porcelain Plate with Sweets at Floris van Wanroij Fine Art His works follow the stylistic characteristics of the earliest still life painters Osias Beert (c. 1580-late 1624), Georg Flegel (1566-1638) and Clara Peeters (?1589-1657) in their chromatic palette, sharply illuminated foreground and meticulous, realistic rendering of the objects depicted. They also resemble to a lesser extent the work of his contemporary, the Antwerp still life artist Jacob van Hulsdonck. The market for his small cabinet pictures would have been educated collectors of Antwerp who were familiar with their symbolism and religious references. Ryckaert's compositions are painstakingly constructed with meticulous attention to detail. The objects and forms are arranged in separation from each other on the inclined surface of a table. By juxtaposing food, dishes and precious objects within various planes in space David Rijckaert II is able to increase their legibility. The frontal and distributive presentation is still archaic while his attention for detail and strong realism show his adherence to the Flemish tradition. Characteristic for his style are the dark abstract backgrounds and the bright, enamel-like colours. ==References * Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish still life painters Category:Flemish art dealers Category:Artists from Antwerp Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke Category:1586 births Category:1642 deaths ","title":"David Rijckaert II"},{"id":"46311317","text":"Lyc√©e Fran√ßais de Malabo \\"Le Concorde\\", previously √âcole Fran√ßaise \\"Le Concorde\\", is a French international school in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea.

Founded in 1958, its product range focuses on high-end automatic watches, watch movements and components. ==History== Beijing Watch Factory was established in Changping, Beijing in June 1958 with a staff of 21 craftsmen. From the beginning, Beijing watches were noted for their quality of craftsmanship. Beijing Watch Factory was one of the major developers of the Chinese Standard Movement. The Beijing Watch model based on the movement, designated ZB-1 (or SZB-1) with 17 jewels began production in 1972. The Shuangling brand name was adopted soon afterwards for export markets. Early in the production of the ZB-1, the factory developed a 40 jewel automatic version known as SZB-1C, which was the first automatic Chinese Standard movement in production. In the 1990s, the factory continued to export complete watches, as well as movements to foreign manufacturers. By the end of the decade, they were also producing complete OEM watches for external clients. As with many other factories, Beijing developed a skeleton version of their Standard movement. In 1995, Beijing Watch Factory commenced work on their first independently developed tourbillon watches led by master watchmaker Xu Yaonan. A prototype was running in 1996 and was ready for production the following year. However, the Asian Financial Crisis delayed these plans until 2004, when the TB01-2 tourbillon finally entered production. Beijing Watch Factory continues development of tourbillons to stay ahead of competitors such as Tianjin Seagull. ==Brands== * Beijing Shuangling == See also == * Chinese Standard Movement ==References*http://www.europastar.com/magazine/highlights/1004084031-the-beijing-watch- factory.html Category:Watch manufacturing companies of China Category:Watch movement manufacturers Category:Manufacturing companies based in Beijing Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1958 Category:Chinese brands Category:1958 establishments in China ","title":"Beijing Watch Factory"},{"id":"46311384","text":"The Women's Royal Australian Army Corps (WRAAC) was formed as an all women's corps of the Australian Army in April 1951. Its Colonel-in-Chief was Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon. The purpose of the corps was to counter a manpower shortage that developed due to fighting during the Korean War and post-World War II full employment. At the time of its formation, many senior WRAAC personnel had previously served in the Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS), which had been raised during World War II, and as a result the WRAAC is considered to have its origins in the AWAS. The corps consisted of both Regular and part-time personnel, and had commissioned officers, warrant officers, non commissioned officers and other ranks who filled a variety of roles including general duties, cooking, clerical work, instruction, warehousing, and signalling. There were also librarians, coders, projectionists, and psychologists. Training was completed separately from male recruits at various locations including Queenscliff for soldiers and Georges Heights for officers. Personnel were posted either to formed WRAAC companies, or to male units to fill position vacancies. By the late 1970s female soldiers had begun to be integrated into the Army at large and in late 1984, the WRAAC was disbanded with personnel being transferred to other previously all male corps based on their trade specialty. At this time, female officer cadets began training at the Officer Cadet School, Portsea alongside male cadets, and when Portsea closed down at the end of 1985, they were integrated into the Royal Military College, Duntroon. Female soldiers began training alongside male recruits at the Army Recruit Training Centre at Kapooka in 1985. There were four directors of the service before the title of director was abolished: Kathleen Best (1951‚Äì1957); Dawn Jackson (1957‚Äì1972); Kathleen Fowler (1972‚Äì1977); and Barbara Maxwell (1977‚Äì1979). ==References== Citations Bibliography * ==Further reading== * Category:Defunct Australian Army Corps Category:Military units and formations established in 1951 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1984 Category:1951 establishments in Australia ","title":"Women's Royal Australian Army Corps"},{"id":"46311450","text":"√Ñrzte-Zeitung (company name: √Ñrzte Zeitung Verlags-GmbH: , ZDB (DE) 604874-2) is a German newspaper for physicians and other medical professionals.

Its leaves are arranged in alternate pairs (decussate), each leaf long and wide, linear or very narrow elliptic in shape and tapering to a point. The flowers are white to creamy-yellow, in heads at or near the ends of the branches which often continue to grow after flowering and are about in diameter. There is usually only one flower in the head but sometimes up to three flowers. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around each flower with 17 to 24 stamens per bundle. Flowering occurs during spring and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long. ==Taxonomy and naming== Melaleuca haplantha was first formally described in 1988 by Bryan Barlow in Australian Systematic Botany as a new species. The specific epithet (haplantha) is derived from Ancient Greek words meaning \\"single\\" and \\"flower\\", referring to the single-flowered inflorescence. ==Distribution and habitat== This melaleuca occurs between the New Norcia, Mukinbudin, Stirling Range and Hopetoun districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows in clay and gravelly loam in winter-wet soil in kwongan or woodland. ==Conservation status== Melaleuca haplantha is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. ==References== haplantha Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Plants described in 1988 Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia ","title":"Melaleuca haplantha"},{"id":"46311484","text":"Prakash Mani Tripathi (born 30 June 1935) is an Indian politician and a former member of Lok Sabha from Deoria parliamentary constituency. ==References *http://www.electionplans.com/election/state/india/constituency/2533/200904/ Category:Living people Category:Bharatiya Janata Party politicians from Uttar Pradesh Category:People from Sultanpur, Uttar Pradesh Category:11th Lok Sabha members Category:People from Deoria district Category:Lok Sabha members from Uttar Pradesh Category:13th Lok Sabha members Category:1935 births ","title":"Prakash Mani Tripathi"},{"id":"46311492","text":"\\"Night\\" (–ù–æ—á—å/Noch') is a Russian art song by composer Modest Mussorgsky.

He attended Groton School and Yale University, Phi Beta Kappa summa cum laude in 1935. He then attended Yale Law School, edited the Yale Law Journal, and received his law degree in 1938. In 1940, Du Val married artist Susan Holdredge Bontecou (1919-1997), with whom he had a daughter Susan and three sons Clive III, Daniel and David. ==Career== During World War II, Du Val served in the U.S. Navy (1942-1946), including in the Pacific Theater aboard the , an aircraft carrier. He rose in rank from Lieutenant Junior Grade to Lieutenant Commander, and also earned five battle stars, a Commendation Medal and Presidential Unit Citation. In 1978 the Disabled American Veterans awarded him its National Commander's award for his subsequent legislative service. After five more years in private legal practice, Du Val entered his public service during the Republican administration of President Dwight Eisenhower, serving in the U.S. Department of Defense in positions including: Special Assistant to the Undersecretary of the Army (1951-1952), Special Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of the Defense (1953), and Assistant General Counsel (international Affairs) (1953-1955). He then became General Counsel for the U.S. Information Agency (1955-1959). In 1959, Du Val served as Associate General Counsel for the President's Committee to Study the United States Military Assistance Program. Du Val returned to private practice in 1959, with the Washington D.C. office of the New York law firm Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, where he worked in legislative affairs until retiring in 1970. After Democrat John F. Kennedy defeated Republican Presidential candidate Richard M. Nixon in the 1960 Presidential election Du Val joked that he rebuffed an attempt to purchase his McLean, Virginia home by Attorney General designate Robert F. Kennedy, because he and his wife found Kennedy arrogant. Du Val was a Rockefeller Republican but turned toward the Democratic Party as a result of the (losing) Presidential candidacy of Barry Goldwater in 1964, and because of Du Val's local political involvement concerning development of the Merrywood estate in McLean (the childhood home of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy). Du Val became President of the McLean Citizens Association and succeeded in getting the U.S. Department of the Interior to buy a conservation easement and thus block a proposed high rise development along that segment of the Potomac River. He later succeeded in transforming another estate along the Potomac River into the Scott's Run Nature Preserve. As a Virginia legislator (a part-time position) for nearly three decades, Du Val attributed his success to courtesy, patience and persistence.Washington Post obituary First elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1965 as a Democrat representing Fairfax County, Virginia after the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Davis v. Mann struck down the Byrd Organization reapportionment that had shortchanged Northern Virginia, Du Val was twice re-elected as delegate.http://dela.state.va.us/dela/Membios.nsf/94f6e9b9c9b5678f85256b1b00732227?SearchView However, when he ran for U.S. Congress in 1966 against incumbent conservative Republican Joel Broyhill to represent Virginia's 10th congressional district, he lost. The following year Du Val was one of only two northern Virginia Democratic delegates winning re-electing in what became a Republican landslide after an address by President Richard Nixon (and the collapse of the Byrd Organization). Du Val helped revise the Virginia Constitution in 1969-1970, and became known as a Virginia gentleman despite his accent. A consumer advocate, DuVal challenged electric and telephone utility rate increases before the State Corporation Commission and Virginia Supreme Court.clipping dated April 14, 1975 The National Wildlife Federation twice gave Du Val awards for his clean-river legislation and environmental stewardship, and he was Virginia's member of the Environmental Quality and Natural Resources Committee of the Southern Legislative Conference. He also worked with the Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Izaak Walton League, Sierra Club, National Trust for Historic Preservation, and with veterans organizations and Chambers of Commerce in his district. However, Du Val was also unsuccessful in his attempts to secure his party's nomination for U.S. Senate in 1970 and again in 1978. He lost the former to George Rawlings by 700 votes out of 120,000 and became his opponent's treasurer rather than demand a recount, but Rawlings still lost the general election to Harry F. Byrd Jr., who had run as an Independent rather than endorse his one time fellow Democrat as his father's Byrd Organization collapsed. Upon the announced retirement of Republican William L. Scott, DuVal again ran for U.S. Senate, but suffered from his association with fellow Democrat and consumer advocate Henry Howell, who had defeated Andrew P. Miller in the previous gubernatorial primary only to lose badly to Republican Ted Dalton.Shelley Rolfe, Du Val Aims Bid for Support of Both Wings, Richmond Times Dispatch April 10, 1978 Fairfax County voters elected Du Val to the Virginia Senate in 1971, when he defeated incumbent Republican Robert C. Fitzgerald after a redistricting that instituted single member districts (Fairfax previously had two senators and his district number had the previous year been assigned to Roanoke many hours drive to the southwest). Fairfax and north Arlington County voters re-elected Du Val four times before he announced that he would not seek re-election in 1991. Despite traveling to Richmond on a Greyhound bus and staying at an inexpensive motel, Du Val had risen to lead the Democratic Caucus. He served on the powerful Senate Finance Committee, as well as on a less official group of seven legislators who hashed out divergences between bill passed by the two legislative chambers. Du Val came to lead the northern Virginia delegation in the General Assembly after the retirement of Adelard L. Brault, who had questioned his very different style. The Washington Post analogized Brault's to Jimmy Cagney and Du Val's to Jimmy Stewart.Fred Hiatt, \\"The Price of Being Different,\\" Washington Post Feb. 20, 1983 In his last campaign, he carpooled to debates with his Republican opponent (and won). In addition to his courtesy and natty attire, Du Val became known for advocating conservation, consumer rights and clean-government legislation. Despite some skeptics who criticized him as \\"too nice\\", Du Val also blocked efforts to trim Metrorail funds and led efforts to secure funding for George Mason University and northern Virginia road projects circa 1985. ==Legacy== Du Val died of cancer at his historic estate on February 25, 2002. He had survived his wife of 27 years (who also died of cancer) by five years, and had dedicated an art studio at the McLean Community Center (she had served on the McLean Project for the Arts board of directors for 30 years) in her memory on April 29, 2000.Live Du Val II Dies at 89, McLean Connection February 27, 2002pamphlet in clippings file at Fairfax County Regional Library Both also outlived one son (who died in 1998).

He was also a maker of television documentaries, broadcaster and author. ==Early career== Marks was born to Jewish parents; his father was the son of immigrants from Ukraine.Goodwin (1993) Brought up in Harrow, London,Rozner (1999) Marks was educated at Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School and Trinity College, Cambridge.Anon (2015) Originally he hoped for a career in the theatre and was a member of the National Youth Theatre. Obtaining a job, originally as a researcher, at the BBC, he became a director and producer of television arts programmes. While making a programme in 1972 about Shandy Hall (home of the writer Laurence Sterne), he met the writer Michael Frayn and the two became lifelong friends. Leaving the BBC to work as an independent producer, Marks was invited back by Alan Yentob and eventually became Head of Music Programmes at the BBC. During this time he became involved in opera, including directing television versions of Michael Tippett's New Year and Mark-Anthony Turnage's Greek. ==At the ENO== In 1993 Marks succeeded Peter Jonas as General Director of English National Opera (ENO). He inherited financial problems (the company already had a deficit of over ¬£3 million) and a roster of new productions which initially drew low audiences and poor critical reception, including a controversial production of Alfred Schnittke's Life with an Idiot.Lister (1995) However, Marks wrote, \\"At ENO I was surprised and delighted to discover that the elusive force known as 'word of mouth' can overcome even the most savage press reactions.

Although audiences increased, particularly for a well-received production of Carmen, and revenues improved,Gilbert (2011), p. 500 Marks found himself increasingly at odds with the ENO board of directors, especially over his proposals to move the company's home from the expensive and elderly London Coliseum theatre to a new build out of the central London area. These disagreements, and lack of cogent funding proposals from the Arts Council, led to his resignation in 1997.Lister (1997)Gilbert (2011), p. 497 ==Later career== After leaving the ENO, Marks devoted himself to writing, broadcasting and travelling.

He went to school in Breslau and then graduated from Strasbourg University in 1887. He took his Staatsexamen one year later, and graduated as an M.D. in 1889 for research on eye pigmentation.Hirschfeld, Eugen (1866‚Äì1946) -- Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 4 April 2015. Arriving in Brisbane in July 1890 and registered to practice a month later, he became deeply involved in the medical and scientific aspect of Queensland and honorary bacteriologist to the Brisbane Hospital, specializing in tuberculosis. In 1895, he wrote a paper on the need for compulsory inspection of meat to help eradicate tuberculosis 'in man and beast'. Hirschfeld became a naturalized Australian in 1893 and, believing that dual nationality was possible, enrolled himself at the consulate as a German citizen to comply with German regulations. He was a leading figure in the German community, and 1906 he was appointed Imperial German Consul in Brisbane. In consultation with Governor William MacGregor, he founded a society for the propagation of German language and culture. In 1911, Hirschfeld became a founding senator of the Queensland University and was admitted M.D. ad eundem. A year later he travelled overseas to represent the university at a congress in London. While away, he studied tuberculosis and cancer treatment methods for the government as a member of the Queensland Medical Board. ==Political career== On 3 July 1914 and less than one month before the outbreak of the First World War, Hirschfeld was appointed by the Denham Ministry to the Queensland Legislative Council. He resigned from the Council four months later, on 2 November 1914. ==Later life== In February 1916, Hirschfeld was interned at Enoggera then one week later transported to Liverpool, New South Wales, being held there until he was released due to ill- health in August 1917. He was once again soon interned on the basis he had allegedly falsified medical evidence to secure his original release. A magisterial investigation ensued, and after a review of the case by Robert Garran, Hirschfeld was deported to Germany. He soon travelled to the Netherlands before arriving in the United States of America where he practiced in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Due in part to representations from John Monash, Hirschfeld was finally allowed to reenter Australia in 1927 and commenced practice at Wickham Terrace in Brisbane. He eventually moved to the Darling Downs area, purchasing stations around Inglewood where he spent 15 years carrying out botanical research into improving the quality of pasture for raising sheep and cattle. ==Personal life== On 21 April 1897, Hirschfeld married Annie Eliza Sarah Saddler at Holy Trinity Church, Kew, Melbourne, Victoria. They had four sons and two daughters with two of the sons, Konrad Hirschfeld and Otto Hirschfeld going on to distinguished medical and academic careers in their own right. On 18 June 1946, Hirschfeld died at his property in Bybera near Inglewood and was buried there. == Legacy == His grand-daughter Roisin Goss (n√©e Hirschfeld, daughter of Konrad Hirschfeld and wife of Queensland Premier Wayne Goss) researched Eugen Hirschfeld's life as a PhD thesis at the University of Queensland. ==References Further reading == * == External links == Category:Members of the Queensland Legislative Council Category:1866 births Category:1946 deaths ","title":"Eugen Hirschfeld"},{"id":"46311718","text":"The Anchor University is a private university owned by the Deeper Christian Life Ministry.

I was held in different remand prisons (SIZO), sometimes in the same cell with persons sick with pulmonary TB. I was ordered by the heads of security agencies to sign a statement saying that Olexander Omelchenko illegally transferred money from accounts of Kyiv City State Administration to his political project and to a construction project of his son's facilities. Coercion to give false testimony was unacceptable, so I stayed true to my positions and did not perjure.\\" Artemenko said. On October 22, 2004, A. Artemenko was released on bail of some MPs.

I was personally engaged in the installation of this technology in Qatar,\\" he stated. In November 2012, with his personal assistance, the Embassy of Ukraine was opened in the State of Qatar and the State of Qatar embassy was opened accordingly in Ukraine. == Parliamentary activities == Artemenko defines himself as a neoconservative. He held strong positions concerning urgent changes in the state. Therefore, he responded to the invitation of the leader of the Radical Party, Oleh Lyashko, and agreed to be on the list for early parliamentary elections in October 2014. A. Artemenko realized Ukraine needed an ideological party. He studied the performance and experience of various political systems, taking as an example the activities of political organizations like the US Republican Party and the UK Conservative Party. Together with other like-minded individuals and following his beliefs, he founded a political party called \\"Solidarity of Right Forces\\" in November 2014. It was all done in contrast to the numerous and artificial election projects. The \\"Solidarity of Right Forces\\" party set a goal to participate in all upcoming elections: local, parliamentary and presidential. Andrii Artemenko conducts pro-western parliamentary activity. He was the Deputy Chairman of the Committee of the Verkhovna Rada on issues of European integration, Subcommittees on Cooperation of Ukraine and NATO and EU Common Security and Defense Policy.

Besides, he is a co-chair of Parliamentary Friendship Group with Slovenia. On December 25, 2014 the establishment of inter-factional deputy group \\"Solidarity of Right Forces\\" was announced in the Parliament. Andrii Artemenko initiated the formation of the party and eventually headed it. The members of Parliament are working together on the draft bills aimed to solve middle class problems in Ukraine. In particular, creating a favorable legal environment for business, private property protection and fair trial. Andrii Artemenko authored 37 bills, of which 17 were voted into laws. Some of representative bills are: number 1601 \\"On Amendments to the administrative-territorial system of Luhansk region, changing and setting boundaries of Popasnjansky and Slavyanoserbsk districts of Luhansk region\\", number 1310 \\"On Amendments to Article 41 of the Law of Ukraine\\" On Joint Stock Companies\\" (with respect to the quorum of the general meetings of joint stock companies with majority state corporate rights), the bill number 1736 \\"On the appeal of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine to the European Parliament, the Parliament of the Council of Europe and the national parliaments of the EU Member States, the USA, Canada, Japan and Australia on the issue of the mass shooting of people near Volnovakha\\", the Resolution number 2066 \\"On holding parliamentary hearings entitled: \\"Perspectives of introducing visa free regime for the citizens of Ukraine by the European Union\\" (May 21‚Äì22, 2015). One of the more popular bills initiated by Andrii Artemenko was on legalization of dual citizenship No. 6139 - which currently enjoys support of incumbent President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky. During his tenure as Member of Parliament, Mr. Artemenko criticized Poroshenko‚Äôs regime and uncovered facts of internal and international corruption. Since 2015 Andrii Artemenko has been cooperating with the US investigative authorities in inquiries related to misappropriation of US financial aid to Ukraine by then President Petro Poroshenko. == Pro-Trump position == In 2016, still in the capacity of Ukrainian MP, Andrii Artemenko was the only Ukrainian politician who openly supported then Presidential candidate Donald Trump and demanded that Ukrainian policies were adjusted to take into account Trump‚Äôs program at the time when official Ukraine publicly supported Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton. Mr. Artemenko was politically harassed by Poroshenko‚Äôs regime, in violation of the Constitution of Ukraine and Civil Code of Ukraine, was deprived of Ukrainian citizenship, MP mandate, and was forced to leave Ukraine together with his family. Andrii Artemenko challenged this decision in Ukrainian courts but given their bias and loyalty to the then President, Petro Poroshenko, the decision remained in force, which gave him a right in 2017 to bring his case of unlawful deprivation of citizenship to The European Court of Human Rights, where it is being considered to the present. On August 11, 2020, the Central Office of the State Bureau of Investigation of Ukraine began a pre-trial investigation of a criminal offense under Article 367 Part 2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, as amended in 2001, with regard to the fact of improper performance of their official duties by officials of State Migration Service of Ukraine, Members of the Commission on Citizenship under the President of Ukraine and other high-ranking officials - during the preparation and approval of documents on the termination of citizenship of Ukraine of Andrii Artemenko. On August 18, 2020 The District Administrative Court of Kyiv received a lawsuit from Andriy Artemenko to the Commission under the President of Ukraine on Citizenship, third parties - the President of Ukraine and the State Migration Service of Ukraine. The plaintiff asks the court to declare illegal the actions of the Commission to submit to the President of Ukraine a proposal to satisfy the application of the State Migration Service of Ukraine dated April 21, 2017 to terminate his citizenship of Ukraine. Simultaneously ‚Äúliberal-democratic‚Äù press in US (The New York Times) insinuated that he was Putin ‚Äì Trump back channel. As a consequence, Mr. Artemenko was interrogated by Ukrainian General Prosecutor office and became part of the Mueller investigation in the US. In June 2018 Mr. Andrii Artemenko testified under the oath to the grand jury of the Supreme court in Washington DC. No charges were brought against Andrii Artemenko as a result of these investigations, which confirms politically motivated persecution by the Poroshenko regime and biased attacks by the US liberal-democratic media. During the 2019 Ukrainian Presidential elections, Andrii Artemenko endorsed the candidacy of Volodymyr Zelenskyy. After Zelensky's official statement about work on the reform of dual citizenship and the return of Ukrainian citizenship to Mikhail Saakashvili (he was illegally deprived of his citizenship in 2017 by the decree of the former President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko), Andrii Artemenko sent a letter to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, requesting the restoration of his constitutional rights and the abolition of decree No. 119/2017 regarding the termination of citizenship. == Current activities == Andrii Artemenko is currently the co-owner and Executive Chairman of Airtrans LLC that is part of the Frontier Resource Group. From the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic Airtrans LLC secured consecutive flights on SouthEast Asia ‚Äì US route to bring needed PPE supplies in a timely manner. Hundreds of tons of medical supplies were brought into the US when they were most needed. He is also actively developing (co-owner and President, American Industrial Group Inc.) a manufacturing company in the US that provides sustainable disinfectant and other personal protective equipment in the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Bruce Merry, Encyclopedia of Modern Greek Literature, 2004, p. 397. The play is set in 1st-century AD Rome, John Gassner, The Reader's Encyclopedia of World Drama, 2002, p. 397. a few years after the crucifixion of Christ at the exact point in time when the disastrous fire of Nero will burn the city to the ground. The main characters of the tragedy are Christ, Nero, Greek Prochoros and Jews Manain and Daisan. ==Plot== In this play, Sikelianos praises the tortured, tormented and despised people (which is cared for and supported by the Christ, a figure that is concerned first and foremost for the weak and underprivileged of this world) in an effort to elevate the integrity, the ideal of its original, folk spirit. The play addresses matters such as Greece and the way it deals with things and ideas, its contribution to the world (mainly through Prochoros), while in the end the tragedy highlights the Christian peace and purity (Christ is a symbol that is trying to unite the different views). Christ is the successor to the Greek spirit or at least he is the linking force that will play an important role on co-forming (with the Greek element) the new ideals for life. Formulating this shape through the terms of scholars, we would say that the prophetic and high tone of the tragedy is in parallel with the \\"human temperature\\", with human faith and militancy.Œ†Œ≠œÑœÅŒøœÇ ŒßŒ¨œÅŒ∑œÇ, ¬´ŒüŒπ œÑœÅŒ±Œ≥œâŒ¥ŒØŒµœÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒÜŒ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒøœÖ Œ£ŒπŒ∫ŒµŒªŒπŒ±ŒΩŒøœç¬ª, œÄŒµœÅ.

The predominant request - message of the play, the universal Unity into which the fragmented World needs to return to (the world was fragmented after the matricide committed with the refusal of the Mother-Earth within the city- states) is served only with a Catharsis, with the end of this historic cycle and the \\"reinvention\\" of the world (the \\"eternal return\\" also found in the Stoic theory) through a purifying-cathartic (and therefore destructive) power and manner. This manner, according to Sikelianos, is fire that will burn everything (a popular motif in the work of Sikelianos in general, since he has used it in many other tragedies). The main episode of Christ in Rome with great length and key importance ‚Äì and also the main theme of the plot is the scene of the fire that burns Rome. The re-creation of all things will come in the face the Jew Daisan, who will salvage an infant from the burning ruins of a building, a symbol of hope for the future: in other words and in direct correlation with the ancient myths and Greek tragedy, Daisan becomes the father-Zeus of the new Dionysus ‚Äì hope for the future of the world. But, as a man Daisan has also restored the fault of all mankind, the fault that cost him Paradise: he has rescued Dionysus-Art, which is the way to render the human race immortal. All these symbolisms and interpretations, as in all the other tragedies by Sikelianos, are based on the texts of the original sources, the inexhaustible material of ancient tragedy, which so aptly and delicately Sikelianos \\"disguises\\" and \\"hides\\" within his own text. ==ReferencesSources== * Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature, 1995. * John Gassner, The Reader's Encyclopedia of World Drama, 2002. * Bruce Merry, Encyclopedia of Modern Greek Literature, 2004. * Œ†Œ≠œÑœÅŒøœÇ ŒßŒ¨œÅŒ∑œÇ, ¬´ŒüŒπ œÑœÅŒ±Œ≥œâŒ¥ŒØŒµœÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒÜŒ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒøœÖ Œ£ŒπŒ∫ŒµŒªŒπŒ±ŒΩŒøœç¬ª, œÄŒµœÅ.

Shirou is a teenager who accidentally participates in the \\"Holy Grail War\\" alongside six other mages looking for the eponymous treasure, an all-powerful, wish-granting relic. Shirou was the sole survivor of a fire in a city and was saved by a man named Kiritsugu Emiya who inspired him to become a hero and avoid killing people during fights. While fighting alongside the servant Saber, Shirou develops his own magical skills and, depending on the player's choices, he forms relationships with the novel's other characters. He also appears in the visual novel sequel Fate/hollow ataraxia, the prequel light novel Fate/Zero, and printed and animated adaptations of the original game. Writer Kinoko Nasu created Shirou and Saber in stories he had written as a teenager. Nasu was worried that the story would not work as a bish≈çjo game because the main character was a girl. Artist Takashi Takeuchi suggested switching the genders of the protagonist and Saber to fit into the game market. For the anime adaptations following Fate/Zero, the staff wanted to make the character more serious in his interactions with the other characters while also giving him a more cheerful personality in contrast to the original visual novel. Shirou is regularly voiced in Japanese by Noriaki Sugiyama as a teenager and Junko Noda as a child; multiple voice actors have voiced him in the English releases of the anime adaptations. Critics have commented on Shirou's different characterizations; his role in each part of the original Fate/stay night visual novel has received positive reaction due to his character development and relationship with the character Archer. Shirou's appearance in Studio Deen's first Fate/stay night-based anime received a mixed response; critics initially disliked Shirou, but praised how his relationship with Saber evolved over time. In Ufotable's anime series, based on the visual novel's route Unlimited Blade Works, the character was praised for how he dealt with questions about his ideals. Shirou has also appeared in multiple polls related to Fate and anime in general. ==Character== Shirou Emiya is a red-haired Japanese high school student. Prior to the events of the visual novel Fate/stay night, Shirou's parents died in a fire caused by a war between mages known as the Fourth Holy Grail War. Shirou is saved by Kiritsugu Emiya, who then adopts him and teaches basic magic. Just before his adoptive father's death, Shirou is informed that Kiritsugu failed to become a hero serving justice, someone who saves as many people as possible. Shirou promises to become one in his stead. His desire to fulfill Kiritsugu's goal (referred to as an ideal) becomes his way of life. Through the three routes of Fate/stay night, his opinion of that ideal shifts. He suffers from extreme survivor's guilt and feels that, it is disrespectful to the deceased to prioritize his own needs before those of others. He has a distorted sense of values and can only find self-worth in helping others without compensation. Shirou takes Kiritsugu's values of being a hero regardless of being mocked by others who find him hypocritical for not caring about his own life; different routes of the novel make him choose different paths as he interacts with others. While Shirou is only able to perform basic magic for his daily life, he develops the power to project weapons such as two small twin swords and replicas of other weapons he knows. He is connected with the servant Archer as both can wield the same powers, most notably the extra-dimensional weapons known as , from a dimension in the future, allowing to reach the strength of other servants in a short moment in different routes of the novel's stories. ==Appearances== In Fate/stay night As the visual novel opens, Shirou lives in a Japanese household from the city of Fuyuki under the guidance of school teacher Taiga Fujimura, years after his father Kiritsugu died. One night at school, he witnesses a duel between warriors Archer and Lancer; the latter ambushes and kills Shirou. Using her magic, Archer's master, Rin Tohsaka, manages to revive Shirou. When Lancer attacks him again, Shirou accidentally summons the servant Saber who drives Lancer away. Saber swears to protect him from any danger. After forming an alliance with Rin, Shirou learns of the Fifth Holy Grail War, a conflict between multiple servants and masters who seek to obtain the Holy Grail. Shirou agrees to join the conflict to prevent further catastrophes being caused by other masters. =Fate route= In the Fate route, Shirou learns that Saber is the reincarnation of King Arthur. King Arthur blames herself for the fall of Britain. This unwavering ideal serves as a juxtaposition to Shirou's; although they believe that their respective goals are unreachable, both continue along their journey. While fighting a servant named Berserker, Shirou passes all of his energy to Saber to create a replica of Caliburn, the sword in the stone which chooses the rightful king of England which the pair wield together to kill their enemy. Shirou then adopts Berserker's master, Illyasviel von Einzbern, who is revealed to be Kiritsugu's daughter. Shirou learns that Kiritsugu was Saber's previous master, and that Excalibur's scabbard, , was hidden inside his body to protect him from enemies. Shirou and Saber prepare for final fight against Kirei Kotomine and his servant, Gilgamesh, who intend to sacrifice Illya to create the Grail. Before this, Shirou returns Avalon to Saber so that she can fight with Excalibur's full strength. Shirou and Saber win their fights by accessing Avalon's full power together, after which Saber returns to a past version of Camelot, where she passes away. In the PlayStation 2 remake, an extra ending was added, in which Shirou and Saber reunite on Avalon Island following their deaths. =Unlimited Blade Works route= In the Unlimited Blade Works route, Rin chastises Shirou for his ideal of becoming an ally of justice. Her servant is a future version of Shirou ‚Äì Archer ‚Äì who has suffered greatly from this ideal. Archer seeks to kill his younger self in the hope of erasing his own existence or at least erasing the ideal of being an ally of justice from Shirou's world. During a battle, Shirou learns of Archer's true identity. The two are also locked in an ideological conflict, with Archer criticizing Shirou for borrowing his ideal from his adoptive father and Shirou vowing never to become Archer. Although he refuses to give up his ideal entirely, Shirou works toward a compromise in which he will strive for fulfilling it despite knowing that it is borrowed. After Shirou wins his fight against Archer, he faces and defeats Gilgamesh, while Rin and Saber destroy the Grail created from the late Illya. In the Good ending, Saber does not fade away after destroying the Grail, and Shirou stays with Saber and Rin in the Emiya household. In the True ending, Shirou travels to London to live with Rin and study magic in the Mage's Association at the Clock Tower. =Heaven's Feel route= In the Heaven's Feel route, Shirou realizes that his schoolmate Sakura Matou is a mage who turns into a black shadow every night. He faces a dilemma: he can either uphold his ideal by killing Sakura, saving lives in the process, or he can forsake his ideal to save her. He chooses to abandon his ideal and become Sakura's ally. During a fight, Shirou's left arm is cut off and replaced with Archer's. Archer's arm ‚Äì ‚Äì is too powerful for an ordinary human to wield; its use would eventually result in Shirou's death. While fighting corrupted versions of Saber and Berserker created by Sakura's Shadow, Shirou fully taps into the arm's power, beginning the process of his mind and body breaking down. He then projects Berserker's own axe-sword to remove all nine remaining lives in one go using the technique . Shirou defeats Saber, and he and Rin purge the Shadow from Sakura. He stays behind to destroy the Greater Grail but is confronted by Kirei, whom Shirou defeats. In the Normal ending, Shirou sacrifices himself to destroy the Greater Grail. In the True ending, Illya sacrifices herself to close the Greater Grail and save Shirou from dying to his arm's effects. He then lives peacefully with Sakura. In Fate/hollow ataraxia In the sequel Fate/hollow ataraxia, Shirou meets Bazett Fraga McRemitz, a member of the Mages' Association and a master in the Fifth Holy Grail War. Both Shirou and Bazett find themselves in a four-day time loop that begins on the fourth day of the Fifth Holy Grail War. Each time they die or survive four days, they awaken on the first day of the loop, aware of what has happened to them since the first time since it began. Determined to end the sequence, Shirou, Bazett, and Avenger fight to discover the truth behind the endless four days. Shirou experiences changes in personality and momentary lapses in memory. It is later revealed that this is because Shirou is connected to Avenger, causing them to switch places when the night falls, implying that Avenger is either hiding in Shirou's body. Once Shirou discovers the truth, he becomes conflicted; he wants to end the loop, while Avenger wants to keep living out his days. It is revealed that Avenger created and possessed a replica of Shirou to fulfill his desires, trapping that replica in the four-day time loop. Meanwhile, the real Shirou was still present in the real world, and more than half a year had passed after the events of the Fifth Holy Grail War. Once Avenger ends the loop, he discovers the anomaly in spacetime continuum which caused the endless four-day cycle; it was caused by Rin's use of a copy of Zelretch's Jeweled Sword, which Rin had obtained with the help of Shirou and Illya six months after the War. Avenger then erases the memories of all the people who were present in the time loop world, including Shirou. The only people who know what occurred are Bazett, Caren, Illya, and Caster. In the epilogue, the true Shirou is tricked into allowing Bazett and Caren stay at the Emiya household.

He, along with other characters from Type-Moon, appears in the 2011 anime Carnival Phantasm. He is also the main character of the manga Today's Menu for the Emiya Family, in which Shirou's peaceful life is shown alongside those of the other characters. =Video games and CD dramas= In the role-playing game Fate/Grand Order, Shirou appears as a \\"pseudo\\" Servant under the name , a spirit that wonders about his vessel's persona. Muramasa wields demonic swords, including and , but is not certain about their success. This incarnation of Shirou reappears in the manga adaptation by Wataru Rei. Shirou appears in the fighting games Fate/unlimited codes, and Fate/tiger colosseum. Besides Type-Moon's works and adaptations, Shirou also appears in the video game Divine Gate. He is also present alongside Rin as a playable character in the side game Capsule Servant, as well as in the mobile phone game Hortensia Saga to promote the anime adaptations. A character CD focused on Shirou was released in 2007. A drama CD exploring Shirou's life with Kiritsugu and Fujimura as he deals with his trauma resulting from the fire and Kiritsugu's tutelage in basic magic was released. In promoting the animated adaptations of the routes, Shirou was added to the games Summons Board, Red Stone, and Puzzle & Dragons. ==Creation and conception== Shirou was originally conceived as a young girl by Kinoko Nasu until it was decided to change his gender to appeal to gamers. Before writing Fate/stay night, Kinoko Nasu wrote the Fate route of the visual novel in his spare time as a high school student. Nasu originally imagined Shirou Emiya as a female character named who wore glasses and Saber as male. Nasu swapped their genders due to his experience writing the novel Tsukihime and because Type-Moon believed a male protagonist would better fit the target demographic. Shirou's role in the story was meant to highlight parts of his personality and growth based on the paths the player picks. The first Fate storyline shows his slanted mind; the next, Unlimited Blade Works, presents his resolve, and in the last storyline, Heaven's Feel, he becomes Sakura Matou's ally and abandons his life-long passion of becoming a hero. Shirou was created with the idea of being a stubborn man with ideals that would change the way his role in the story based on the different routes, something the Type-Moon originally wanted to make with the protagonist of Tsukihime. Furthermore, Nasu wanted to portray him as a typical teenager while artist Takashi Takeuchi did not want him to have too much individuality in order to make players project themselves into him. By the end of the making of the visual novel, Nasu described Shirou as a joyless hero disinterested in the war, denying himself personal happiness in order to save as many people as possible. Shirou's character theme, \\"Emiya\\", while remixes and other themes were created to focus on important scenes related to his character. Nasu believes Shirou and Ryougi Shiki in The Garden of Sinners light novels are characters who face personal problems with narrow perspectives. Shirou was conceived as an amateur magician to create a strong contrast with the skilled heroes from the visual novel. Nevertheless, Nasu stated that Shirou was a weaker fighter in the Fate route, but the character's magical skills developed significantly in the Unlimited Blade Works storyline beyond the capability of a normal person. Nasu said it is difficult to call Shirou's relationship with Saber a relationship between a man and a woman because after ruling Britain under the pretenses of being a male, she \\"turned into a girl all of a sudden and fell in love with Shirou\\". To foreshadow Shirou and Saber's first meeting, the team of writers included a dream sequence in which the latter's sword, Excalibur, is seen by the former. Since Shirou possessed the scabbard Avalon from Excalibur, Nasu wrote this to explain how the two became Master and Servant. Nasu originally had an idea to extend the Fate route involving an alternative Fifth Holy Grail War where Shirou fought alongside Saber but the two did not have a romantic relationship; following their separation, Shirou would bond with Rin in a similar way to how it happened in Unlimited Blade Workss \\"True Ending\\". Takeuchi described Shirou as a strange character based on his personality. Nasu wrote the younger Shirou as a shy child, whom he deemed fun as he grows up and becomes more straightforward. While the Ufotable Unlimited Blade Works series generated multiple questions regarding Shirou becoming his future self, the warrior Archer. Originally, Shirou's future persona would turn out to be the antagonist Gilgamesh but the staff changed him to Archer Nasu said that Shirou still has potential to become a Heroic Spirit. Nevertheless, Nasu still intended from the beginning of the making of the novel that both Shirou and Gilgamesh would oppose one another. In the Heaven's Feel route from the original visual novel, he did not specify whether Shirou would become the same Archer. In another interview, Nasu stated that the Unlimited Blade Works kept sending hints that Shirou might become Archer and Rin would be with him to support him emotionally. Shirou's fate in the Heaven's Feel route was left up to the players' interpretation because of Shirou's apparent resurrection. There have been only small changes to Shirou's physical design since its inception. With red hair and stubborn eyes, Takeuchi aimed for a design that was typical of a straightforward sh≈çnen manga genre character. He felt that it was too standard, however, so he added more circles in his eyes. Takeuchi has trouble bringing out Shirou's expressions because of his unique eyebrows; as a result, Shirou remains the most difficult Fate/stay night character for him to draw. Their goal of creating \\"a protagonist without a face\\" to comply with the nature of bish≈çjo games in the initial release of Fate/stay night is another reason Takeuchi had trouble drawing Shirou, who only appeared in a handful of scenes. In the re-released R√©alta Nua version of the visual novel aimed for teenagers rather than just adults, the importance to show non adult content was increased and so Takeuchi had to draw Shirou more often. Development During production of the anime series Unlimited Blade Works, Ufotable said that they wished to develop Shirou to better fit with other characters in Fate/Zero and the anime's darker tone. Nasu explained that Shirou was made more comical to become a more enjoyable character; this proved to be difficult as his interactions with the other characters were modified, making the Nasu feel pressure during the creation of the series. Nevertheless, Ufotable kept the idea of Shirou not being able to smile too much due to his harsh past, with characters telling Shirou that he rarely expresses joy in some episodes; the staff, including series director Takahiro Miura, found this idea fitting. Still, his interactions with Rin Tohsaka were created to bring the former more joy. Miura wished the staff to make this Shirou's coming-of-age story; despite this, Nasu stated Shirou does not go through a character arc in the story, which left Miura with a different opinion regarding the character's writing. Producer Tomonori Sudou felt that to bring more success to the anime, the staff had to draw Shirou in a more appealing way. New clothing was also given to him. Miura pointed out that in future work he would prefer to focus more on revealing the character of Shirou as a character rather than women associated with him, which is why the producer Aniplex was firmly established in his choice, since the main line of the arch with Archer on the basis of following the ideals of his father. The CEO of Type-Moon believed that only Nasu himself was able to convey all the ideas he put into Shirou, help them reflect on the screen correctly and deepen public perception of the hero. According to the scriptwriter, the main problem of adaptation was the transfer of the culminating battle between Shirou and Archer, which, due to the great emphasis on the inner thoughts of the heroes, could not be transmitted as clearly as in the original source and, according to the creators, would be boring for the audience. For this reason, Nasu independently rewrote the entire course of the battle. In addition, since the format of the visual novel did not set the task to demonstrate the mimic expression of the protagonist's emotions, only during the processing of this scene did Nasu realize and prescribe the necessary range of feelings of the protagonist to reflect it during animation. According to Takeuchi, the final meeting between Nasu and Miura for the approval of the scenario of this battle lasted more than five hours. The choice of the epilogue was delayed for three months, and as a result, Nasu decided to write a script for a separate series telling about the future near future of Shirou and Rin, who went to study in London. Japanese pop singer Aimer composed the theme song \\"Last Stardust\\" which explores Shirou as the music is displayed on his fight against Archer. The vocals focus on the fire that destroyed Shirou's city while dealing with his acceptance of Kiritsugu's death as he decided to follow his dreams regardless of any regrets he takes in his life. This connects with Shirou's future self, Archer, who faced multiple tragedies after becoming a warrior but Shirou still embraced the pain he would endure in his life instead. Aimer also did research in the relationship between Jesus and his disciple Judas Iscariot while handling the relationship between Shirou and Archer with the latter often showing intentions to kill the former, believing he should have never been born; similar words are said between Jesus and Judas. For the release of the first Heaven's Feel film, director Tomonori Sudou said he wanted to further explore Shirou and Sakura Matou's past because he believes their relationship is the most important part of the story. Producer Yuma Takahashi had a similar opinion, feeling some scenes that symbolized the romance between Shirou and Sakura were needed. These scenes were mostly included by Ufotable; Takahashi believes people might want to watch the film again due to the significance it makes in early scenes. Sakura's Japanese voice actor, Noriko Shitaya, stated that the staff's biggest desire was to show the audience the scenes between Shirou and Sakura, with Sudou wishing to explore how the two met and became close. Aimer's theme song \\"I Beg You\\" was written to explore the relationship between these characters as Aimer wants to show Sakura's dark personality as she aims to be loved by Shirou but does not want him to know about her secrets. The author of the printed adaptation of Heaven's Feel noted that for the serialization of the manga he wanted to start the story between Shirou and Sakura with the first time the latter met the former and fell for him in contrast to the original visual novel which left this scene until some scenes more in the route. While Shirou retains his usual appearance in the spin-off manga Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya 3rei!! by author Hiroshi Hiroyama, during parts of his story, Shirou uses a magical card that dresses him in Archer's clothes. Hiroyama originally drew Shirou half-naked but felt this was ridiculous, mostly because the events depicted in the series take place in winter. In his final design, most of Shirou's torso is covered, giving him an appearance like that of his future heroic persona, with the exception of his right arm remaining uncovered. Already experienced in drawing Shirou before he started working on Illya's spin-off manga, Hiroyama had no problems with this version of Shirou, whom he referred to as one of the manga's protagonists due to the focus he gave him during the flashbacks about his past; Similar to the original visual novel, Hiroyama wanted to make Shirou select a route during his flashback chapters as he embarks on a quest to protect his sister, Miyu. For the film Oath Under Snow, singer ChouCho made two songs that focused the relationship between Shirou and Miyu who are the center of the plot describing it as heartwarming due to the close bond the siblings have. The song \\"Kaleidoscope\\" primarily focuses on Shirou's point of view when first meeting Miyu, and she becomes one of his most important people he has ever met. However, due to the film's plot, the lyrics were written to show darker tone in regards to the development of what happens to the two siblings. While not being a song about Shirou, Choucho states that by listening to it, viewers will find a bigger standing to the character. Voice actors Shirou is voiced in Japanese by Noriaki Sugiyama, who was surprised by the length of the Fate franchise. Sugiyama noted that they had a certain tension before the beginning of the recording process, since they had not been involved in the Fate series since 2010, they played the same characters only in the comedy works - the series Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya and Carnival Phantasm. According to Sugiyama, this forced them to rethink the images of their heroes, although he was glad to return to the \\"standard Shirou\\". Sugiyama, on the contrary, stated that recording director Yoshikazu Ivanami forced him for a long time to maintain emotional arousal in his voice. Both actors, Sugiyama and Junichi Suwabe (Archer), since they played the role of the same person, but of a different age, in the final season of the series consciously copied the manner and timbre of each other's speech (Sugiyama - bass, Suvabe - baritone) for greater identification of the characters by the audience. During the Unlimited Blade Works, Sugiyama enjoyed his character's confrontations with Archer, mainly because Shirou might become Archer in the future. Sugiyama once again returned to voice the character in the spin-off movie Oath Under Snow. Sugiyama said that \\"Shirou is a philanthropist in any world. He is a young boy who is wishing for the happiness of those around him, such as for Miyu Satsuki and Illya\\", two characters who appear as the sisters of his two incarnations from the spin-off series. Kaori Nazuka, who voices Miyu, said her character has a noticeable character arc in these spin-offs due to her growing relationship with Shirou. When asked about his favorite scene from the film, Sugiyama said he preferred the final scene due to Shirou's appealing characterization resulting from the impact Shirou's final line has on Miyu. Hiroyama felt that Shirou's voice contains in this film a bigger sense of security compared to his manga. Once the Heaven's Feel films started being promoted, Sugiyama said Shirou acted in a different way due to the different route the films were taking based on the visual novel. As the films were released, Sugiyama believed Shirou's characterization was far darker compared to the other routes from the visual novel, and he found it sad that Shirou loses Saber but is still determined to protect Sakura. He expressed understanding of how Shirou's character was treated in the film, aiming for most of his lines to be done in a cool state. For the spin-off Today's Menu for the Emiya Family, Sugiyama was surprised and delighted with Shirou's personality, finding him gentler than in the original series. He tried giving the character a different tone than the ones he used previously. As a child, Shirou is voiced by Junko Noda, who refers to her character as \\"Chibi Shirou\\" due to his appearance and like her work in Today's Menu for the Emiya Family when Shirou starts cooking hamburgers. Sam Riegel was Shirou's first English voice actor, and Mona Marshall voiced Shirou as a child. Patrick Poole voiced the two incarnations of Shirou appearing in Illya's spin-off anime series. English voice actor Bryce Papenbrook felt honored to take Riegel's place for the Unlimited Blade Works series. He stated Riegel's work is \\"awesome\\". Papenbrook felt that the story took a \\"different path in Unlimited Blade Works\\" and that the creators \\"wanted a different take on Shirou\\". He was surprised that series director Tony Oliver chose him to play Shirou. Papenbrook stated that there were moments when Oliver \\"would explain ... why Shirou was making a certain action or what had been happening surrounding Shirou\\". Oliver \\"added so much detail\\" to Papenbrook's performance; the actor enjoyed \\"watching it back after\\" and felt it was \\"really, really cool to actually see those things that [Oliver] described\\". He said Oliver wanted him to play Shirou in a \\"real\\" way and wished to perceive \\"the feelings behind\\" Papenbrook's words. As a result, Papenbrook had to get himself into a \\"deep mindset\\". Papenbrook had watched the first Heaven's Feel film in Japanese before he was told he would work on it. He said he had been \\"lucky enough to be at a convention with the Japanese actors\\". He added that while one moment in the film had made the whole audience laugh, he had not understood the reason behind their laughter until it had been explained to him; he comprehended that scene when he viewed it in English. After watching the film in Japanese, he \\"understood how Shirou should act in that scene\\". During the recording, he was asked to give Shirou more emotion; he found this challenging because he wanted to avoid expanding Shirou's tone. Papenbrook looked forward to Shirou's role in the Heaven's Feel film because of Shirou being different from the other series, mostly when it came to his relationship with Sakura. ==Cultural impact== Popularity In promoting Vow in the Snow, Takashi Takeuchi drew his take on Hiroshi Hiroyama's Shirou Emiya. Merchandise, including rubber straps and figures, have been modeled after Shirou, including replicas of his twin swords. In 2017, a caf√© based on Fate characters including Shirou was opened in Osaka, Japan. To promote the film Vow in the Snow, Takashi Takeuchi created a poster of Hiroshi Hiroyama's take on Shirou, which was offered to viewers in Japan. Hiroyama responded to this promotion enthusiastically. In promoting the Heaven's Feel films, Shirou's school uniform was recreated for the usage of cosplayers, while his image was later used as part of a Valentine's Day event. Shirou has been popular with fans of the series. He was ranked 12th in Type-Moon's 10th Anniversary Character Poll in 2012, and in an Unlimited Blade Works poll, he took sixth place. Outside of the franchise, Shirou has appeared in other anime polls. He took eighth place in the category \\"best male character\\" from a 2015 preliminary poll conducted by the magazine Newtype. In September and November 2017, he took the third and second places, respectively, in the male character category. In March 2018, he took fourth spot for his role in the first Heaven's Feel film. In a poll containing male anime characters conducted by Anime News Network, he took both the 9th and 10th spots. In a poll by Gakuen Babysitters, Shirou was voted as one of the male character fans wanted to have as their younger brother. In a Newtype poll, Shirou was voted the eighth-most- popular male anime character from the 2010s. In the March 2019 issue from the magazine, Shirou took the first spot for his role in the second Heaven's Feel film. In a Manga.Tokyo poll from 2018, Shirou was voted as the second most popular Fate character behind Saber. Shirou's line \\"I am the bone of my sword\\", which he says when fighting, is popular among the fandom as cited by Sugiyama. Anime News Network cited Shirou and Archer's fight scene from the Unlimited Blade Works television series as one of the best sword fights in anime due to handling of both characters in terms of similarities and how they use similar techniques. His role in the second Heaven's Feel movie also earned him the title of the 10th best male character of 2019. Critical reception  Shirou's characterization has attracted critical commentary. In the story aspect, the reviewers considered Shirou's behavior and his attitude to his own ideals as the most interesting and well-developed part of the whole novel. The main character in each of the story arches was placed in different conditions, which gave readers the opportunity to understand the conditions of the setting (\\"Fate\\"), to conduct a theoretical understanding of the ideals of the character (\\"Unlimited Blade Works\\"), to face the problems of their implementation (\\"Heaven's Feel\\") and, having combined this, to understand the details of his image. Gamasutra said his childish ideals of becoming a hero and the continuation of this goal while growing up make him an interesting protagonist, The site added that the player's in-game choices dramatically alter Shirou's character arcs and allow Nasu to convey a different aspect of his ideal. In his analysis of the magical system and details of the personalities of the characters, Makoto Kuroda sees in the idea of Shirou to become a ‚Äúchampion of justice‚Äù a direct analogy with the traditional view of the life of bodhisattvas in Mahayana Buddhism, seeking to save other people at the cost of their own efforts and suffering. In Kuroda's view, Buddhist concepts are opposed to the elements of Christian ethics contained in the plot through the opposition of Shirou and Kirei Kotomine in the form of the main character's rejection of the interpretation of Angra Mainyu as a creature who accepted the sins of others in the name of salvation. Similarly, novelist Sh≈´sei Sakagami praised the way the player can witness Shirou's \\"gradual change from a robot to becoming a human\\" through the three routes. Uno Tsunehiro from Kyoto University compared his traumatic background to survivors from the September 11 attacks while also showing different ways the Japanese society used to take care of their lives in such time. As a result, Tsunehiro views Shirou's change in each route as a way to recover from the trauma, grow up and become an independent person. MANGA.TOKYO said Shirou's heroic ideal might encourage viewers to support him as he faces enemies in the Holy Grail War. Anime News Network regards him as one of the most strongest orphans in fiction because of his strength and caring nature despite having lost Kiritsugu as a child and how he overcomes his traumatic past. Writer Gen Urobuchi wrote that the relationship between Shirou and Rin is more appealing than his relationship with Saber, describing them as a more realistic couple. Urobuchi enjoyed the way Shirou and Sakura's romantic relationship is handled due to the emotional support Shirou offers to the lonely Sakura. According to Anime News Network, in the visual novel's first animated series, Shirou demonstrates depth because he is less pacifistic and has become a more philosophical fighter than in previous appearances. THEM Anime Reviews was more critical of Shirou's personality, calling him a \\"complete idiot\\" who \\"shows a remarkable ability to get himself into trouble while knowing his actions aren't exactly the smartest courses to take\\". Makoto Kuroda of Wayo Women's University describes Shirou's actions towards Saber as neglect of a person's primordial survival instincts and as encompassing \\"selfless philanthropism and a purely boundless sense of moralism\\". Some reviewers commented on Shirou's relationship with Saber and on his growth in Studio Deen's anime that improves their personalities and adds romance to their relationship as the plot progresses. Reviewers' comments on Shirou's role in the Unlimited Blade Works film and television series have been mostly positive. Charles Cassady stated that Shirou is \\"bloodied so regularly, [Fate/stay night] might well have been titled The Passion of the Shiro[u]\\". The Fandom Post and Blu-ray enjoyed Shirou's characterization in the film, in which his ideals contrast with those of Archer and Kiritusgu, making him notably mature in the story. Both voice actor Kana Ueda and ReelRundown said Unlimited Blade Works makes Shirou's ideals of justice more interesting as the character's depths are further explored. Sequart Organization noted that while Archer hates his past self because of the regrets he had when he was Shirou, he makes peace with his decisions. An Anime News Network reviewer praised his fights in the film. Blu-Ray enjoyed the way Shirou and Rin begin as enemies and become closer as the story progresses. The same reviewer also praised the development of the relationship between Shirou and Archer during the film. Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post praised the protagonist's battle against Gilgamesh because both warriors had been fighting ever since their introductions. Beveridge also stated that Gilgamesh's role in Fate/Zero offers Shirou the opportunity to face the main antagonist from the prequel. Josh Tolentino of Japanator was amazed by Shirou's decision to become a tragic warrior despite his knowledge about this future, which was said to be uncommon in storytelling. Shirou's characterization was changed for the Heaven's Feel movies. Anime News Network said he shows facial expressions that give his scenes a bigger impact on viewers rather than relying of dialogue. Two writers from The Fandom Post were divided on whether Shirou is as engaging in these films as in Unlimited Blade Works, although his posttraumatic stress disorder was noted to explore a deeper part of his past. Martin Butler of UK Anime Network found Shirou \\"rather bland\\". Some reviewers praised his interactions with Sakura and called their relationship one of the most enjoyable romances in the franchise. The second film was noticed for making Shirou take one of the hardest decisions he ever could as it protecting Sakura would contradict his dreams of becoming a hero he took from Kiritsugu. Beside the main Fate series, critics focused on his spin-off incarnations. During his debut in Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya 3rei!!, Shirou earned praise from Thanasis Karavasilis of MANGA.TOKYO, who said his heroic actions make his first appearance the highlight of the episode. His role in the fighting scenes in the series were well-received by Karavasilis, but he received criticism for being overpowered. For the film Oath Under Snow, Mantan Web regarded Shirou's and Miyu's relationship as one of the most heartwarming moments of the feature, while another writer found him more adult and cold than previous incarnations. Anime Now found this Shirou as a more tragic character due to his constant loses in the movie but at the same time becomes a \\"fascinating and complex character\\" in film. The Fandom Post said he enjoyed Shirou and this film helped to further appreciate him more across the Fate franchise despite previous anime series providing a similar scenario. Otaku USA praised him in Today's Menu for the Emiya Family because the character's cooking is presented in a positive way despite his similarities with the archetypes of action series in the previous works. Anime News Network enjoyed the story because Shirou's cooking was so well-made that the reviewer felt hungry. In another review, the writer enjoyed the way this original net animation (ONA) handled the relationship between Shirou and Kiritsugu, which is only briefly shown in other works from the franchise. Ayaka Kawamata of MANGA.TOKYO commended Shirou's actions in the spin-off because his comments about his meals are easy to understand. ==References * Category:Adoptee characters in anime and manga Category:Adoptee characters in video games Category:Anime and manga characters who use magic Category:Anime and manga characters with accelerated healing Category:Fate/stay night characters Category:Fictional amputees Category:Fictional archers Category:Fictional characters with post-traumatic stress disorder Category:Fictional chefs Category:Fictional Japanese people in anime and manga Category:Fictional Japanese people in video games Category:Fictional philanthropists Category:Fictional swordsmen Category:Male characters in anime and manga Category:Male characters in video games Category:Orphan characters in anime and manga Category:Orphan characters in video games Category:Video game characters introduced in 2004 Category:Video game characters who use magic Category:Video game characters with accelerated healing Category:Video game protagonists ","title":"Shirou Emiya"},{"id":"46312026","text":"The following lists events that happened during 1952 in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. ==Incumbents== * General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ‚Äì Joseph Stalin (until 16 October) * Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union ‚Äì Nikolay Shvernik * Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union ‚Äì Joseph Stalin ==Events== * Mingrelian Affair * Doctors' plot: A group of prominent Moscow doctors, mostly Jewish, is falsely accused of conspiring to assassinate Soviet leaders.

He was an early member of the Mattachine Society, involved with the first attempt to pass a human rights ordinance inclusive of sexual orientation in New York City, and co-founder of Triangle Foundation (today known as Equality Michigan). ==Personal life== Messer (right) with his partner of 63 years (at the time of his death), Carl House (left) Messer was born in Madison, Florida on September 22, 1927 to Henry Messer, owner of a Chevrolet dealership, and Sarah Messer, a housewife. He moved to Durham, North Carolina to study premedicine at Duke University and went to Duke University School of Medicine. Messer met his life partner, Carl House, while serving as a captain in the United States Army Air Forces. House was a corporal in the United States Army when they met in 1951 after a night out with a group of gay servicemen. In 1953, after resigning from the Army Air Force, Messer and House moved to New York City's Greenwich Village. They moved to Dearborn Heights, Michigan in 1976. He was shot while volunteering at the Triangle Foundation's office in Detroit on June 28, 1995. The incident received national attention as a possible anti-gay hate crime. Messer died at approximately 5:00am on February 18, 2014 at his home in Dearborn Heights after a struggle with cancer. ==Professional work== During the Korean War, he entered the United States Air Force as a first lieutenant. During the war, he was stationed at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama, and began his specialization in neurosurgery under orders from his commanding officer. Messer was forced to resign his commission as a captain in 1953 after an officer with whom Messer had been involved turned him in for being a gay man. Air Force investigators went through his phone book and the film on his camera while searching for evidence. The investigation lasted three months and included the investigators traveling to his hometown and asked acquaintances whether he had shown signs of being gay while he was growing up. After resigning from the Air Force, Messer completed his residency and then practiced neurosurgery at Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center in Greenwich Village. In the late 1960s, he took a position at Harlem Hospital Center, where he became chief of neurosurgery in 1972. He left in 1976 to become chief of neurosurgery at Wayne County General Hospital, at that time a teaching unit of the University of Michigan. When Messer applied for the position, he listed a 1974 article that essentially identified him as an openly gay man. At the time, it was unusual for physicians to be open about their sexuality. He retired from Wayne County General Hospital at age 60. ==LGBT rights activism== Messer posing with Senator Debbie Stabenow and President Barack Obama. Messer's LGBT political advocacy focused on police entrapment and improving the climate for LGBT youth, especially young people in the medical field. Shortly after moving to New York City in the early 1950s, Messer joined the Mattachine Society. His participation as a neurosurgeon was especially notable as he did not participate in the group under a pseudonym, which was the most common practice for members of the organization at that time. Messer also participated in the Stonewall riots of 1969. Around 1970, Messer and House hosted a meeting with Mattachine members and New York City Councilman Eldon R. Clingan, where the members of the organization shared their firsthand accounts of discrimination with the city leader. Clingan and Councilman Carter Burden introduced a bill in 1971, which Messer helped author, that would have prohibited discrimination in employment and housing on the basis of sexual orientation in New York City. The bill was unsuccessful and such a bill would not pass in New York City until 1986. In 1974, he wrote a chapter entitled \\"The Homosexual as Physician\\" for Human Sexuality: A Health Practitioner's Text by Richard Green. It was the first account of gay doctors to be included in a medical textbook. After moving to Michigan in 1976, he became involved with the Association of Suburban People (ASP) as a board member and public face of the organization. In 1977, he appeared with Wes Rogalski, president of ASP, on \\"Gayly Speaking\\", a WDET-FM program. He also helped organize the first \\"Developing a Positive Gay-Lesbian Identity\\" conference in 1980, and was profiled in Metra magazine in 1982. Messer later became involved with the Michigan Organization for Human Rights (MOHR) as a board member and proponent of lobbying elected officials and holding them accountable to their LGBT constituents. Messer was arrested in January 1985 by an undercover police officer at the Irving Art Theater for alleged indecent behavior. He was convicted of the crime, fined, and placed on one year's probation. New York State rescinded his medical license because of his conviction. While his Michigan license was not in danger of being rescinded, he decided to retire at age 60. Messer recounted his experiences in MOHR's newsletter. He co-founded Triangle Foundation in 1991, at age 63. The organization merged with Michigan Equality in 2010 to form Equality Michigan. Following his death in 2014, Messer's estate donated approximately to the organization's endowment and approximately , spread over four years, to support the organization's work. ==Acknowledgements== Messer (bottom left) and partner Carl House (bottom right) with Equality Michigan's staff at 60th Anniversary event in February 2012. Tribute by Senator Debbie Stabenow to Messer, recorded for his April 2014 memorial service. Equality Michigan has annually awarded a Henry D. Messer Youth Activist Award since 2000 to recipients such as State Representative Jon Hoadley. Messer received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the annual Southeast Michigan LGBT Pride Banquet on June 15, 1995. Representative David E. Bonior stood on the floor of the United States House of Representatives and acknowledged Messer and House's 50th anniversary in 2002, also noting their many years of activism. State Representative Patricia Godchaux requested, and received, a tribute to the couple on their 50th anniversary from Michigan Governor John Engler. The Governor's office later stated that the tribute was signed by a machine, and that the Governor wouldn't have signed the tribute if he had known what it was for. Representative Hansen Clarke made remarks commemorating the couple's 60th anniversary at an anniversary party and benefit for Equality Michigan in 2012. The National LGBTQ Task Force dedicated its 2015 National Conference on LGBT Equality: Creating Change to Messer. ==See also== * Equality Michigan * Michigan Organization for Human Rights * LGBT rights in Michigan * LGBT rights in New York ==References * Tribute by Equality Michigan Category:1927 births Category:2014 deaths Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:Gay men Category:American neurosurgeons Category:People from Dearborn Heights, Michigan Category:People from Greenwich Village Category:People from Madison, Florida Category:Duke University School of Medicine alumni Category:American air force personnel of the Korean War Category:United States Air Force officers Category:Articles containing video clips Category:LGBT people from Florida Category:American LGBT military personnel ","title":"Henry D.

It was written in 1940,Bruce Merry, Encyclopedia of Modern Greek Literature, 2004, p. 397. a few months before the Greco-Italian War and published in 1944, a few months before the liberation of Athens, in the journal Nea Estia. ==Plot== One of the main scenes of the play is the visit of Nero at the oracle of Delphi to take the oracle by Sibylla, priestess of the Oracle, and the reactions of the latter. This work, unlike his first one, the Dithyramb of Rose, is a complete tragedy, in terms of genre and structure: with distinct and complete parts both in the dialogue and chorus parts as well as in the plot and characters. The messages of the time for resistance against the oncoming storm and the pursuit of freedom and human dignity through struggle that the work depicts are portrayed through a dense dramaturgical and finely processed storyline of symbolic relations, influences and elements of ancient drama. A vast number of structures and textual (vocative or expressive) sequences can be found in \\"Sibylla\\" all of which can be attributed to ancient tragedy (for instance the way that the landscape of Delphi is depicted is similar to certain tragedies on the same topic). Sibylla (and the other characters) as a prophetess, also expresses and symbolizes the Greek spirit John Gassner, The Reader's Encyclopedia of World Drama, 2002, p. 398. and conscience against the Roman roughness (during the time of the plot), as well as against the spirit of the conqueror in general (an allegorical approach, based on the historical circumstances at the time of writing of the play). The play expresses personal ideas of Sikelianos, similar to the ideas of his time, expressed through the theatrical garb of ancient tragedy and the elements that are traditionally used in tragedies (religious, psychological and other). What is important for the understanding of the play are the concepts of the \\"mantosyni\\" (the art of oracle as an inner power, spiritually superior to the other inner powers of every man) a property that Sibylla has as a mythical figure and symbol and also the concept of the combination of the Apollonian and the Dionysian element (the individual, logic-wise, prophetic, cult of Apollo in connection with the collective, bacchic-frenzied, ecstatic, joyful worship of Dionysus, cults that were in stark contrast before the advent of Dionysus in Delphi).ŒìŒπœéœÅŒ≥ŒøœÇ ŒíŒ±œÅŒ∏Œ±ŒªŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ, \\"ŒëœÄŒøŒªŒªœéŒΩŒπŒ± ŒúŒ±ŒΩŒØŒ±\\", Œü Œ∫Œ±Œ∏œÅŒ≠œÜœÑŒ∑œÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒóœÅœâŒ¥ŒπŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœÇ.

The first thoughts and discussions started in the 1930s when, in the aftermath of the Delphic Festivals (1927 & 1930), the Parliament and the Senate passed a law providing for the establishment and organization of an International Intellectual Cooperation Centre of Peoples similar to the \\"treasures\\" of the ancient Greek city of Delphi. In 1957, Greece filed a draft proposal to the Council of Europe for the Foundation of an Intellectual Centre in Delphi, which was also accepted. The construction for the conference venue began in 1966. The cost was covered by state funds and funds of the Council of Europe. In 1977, by an act of the Greek Parliament, the European Cultural Centre of Delphi (ECCD) was established as a \\"corporate body under private law\\", under the supervision of the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and the auspices of the Council of Europe.ŒïŒªŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑ ŒìŒªœçŒ∫Œ±œÑŒ∂Œ∑ ‚Äì ŒëœÅŒ≤ŒµŒªŒ≠œÅ ¬´ŒúŒπŒ± ŒºŒµŒ≥Œ¨ŒªŒ∑ ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒØŒ¥Œ±¬ª, œÑŒπŒºŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒµŒ∫Œ¥ŒÆŒªœâœÉŒ∑ ‚Äì Œ±œÜŒπŒ≠œÅœâŒºŒ± œÉœÑŒø Megaron Plus, œÉŒµ œÉœÖŒΩŒµœÅŒ≥Œ±œÉŒØŒ± ŒºŒµ œÑŒøŒΩ Œ£œçŒªŒªŒøŒ≥Œø ¬´ŒüŒπ Œ¶ŒØŒªŒøŒπ œÑŒøœÖ ŒïœÖœÅœâœÄŒ±œäŒ∫Œøœç Œ†ŒøŒªŒπœÑŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫Œøœç ŒöŒ≠ŒΩœÑœÅŒøœÖ ŒîŒµŒªœÜœéŒΩ¬ª. According to its founding law, its aim is to \\"serve international cultural interests\\" and \\"develop common cultural principles that will unite the peoples of Europe\\" through the \\"publication of studies on European culture, the organization of cultural meetings and other artistic activities‚Ä¶‚Äù The board of directors of the European Cultural Centre of Delphi consists of 11 members, 7 of which are Greek, while the remaining members are appointed from countries participating in the Council of Europe. The Secretary General of the Council of Europe and representatives from the Greek Ministries of Culture and Foreign Affairs respectively are council members by office. The other members are personalities from the realms of the Letters and Arts. The board of directors and the managing Director of the ECCD are appointed by decision of the Minister of Culture and their term is renewed every three years. The Ministry of Culture finances the ECCD's regular budget. ==Facilities== Delphi The Conference Centre of the European Cultural Centre of Delphi is located on the western edge of the village of Delphi. Its facilities are spread in a wooded area of 10 hectares and include a Conference Centre, a Guesthouse and an open- air theater. The Conference Centre and the Guesthouse were built in the mid-1960s, designed by Kostas Kitsikis and Anthony Lampakis, and are a typical architectural example of the Modern Movement. The facilities are an elegant architectural ensemble of autonomous discrete buildings that follow the natural slope of the mountain, with large windows and patios. The Conference Center has two main and four auxiliary Conference halls, a library and secretarial facilities. The Guesthouse is a modern midsized hotel unit, with a total of 46 rooms, terraces, a bar, a restaurant, lounge and a reception. In 2005 the open-air theater Frynihos was added to the Centre's infrastructure, designed by architects Eleni Chatzinikolaou and Solon Xenopoulos, in the style of the ancient theaters, lined with stone, with a capacity of 1,100 seats. The theatre's ground floor is equipped with a ground-level Multi-Purpose Conference Hall suitable for exhibitions and seminars. The view to the olive grove of Amfissa and the bay of Itea is magnificent, while the lush gardens and the pine groves of the Conference Center offer to the visitor the opportunity to tour the Park of Sculpture with important works by contemporary European artists. Œëthens The Central Offices are housed in a neoclassical building of 518 sqm, in Plaka. The building dates back to the late 19th century and for decades it was the residence of a well known Athenian family. It was purchased by the European Cultural Centre of Delphi in 1983 and was restored to its original form. Changes to the interior were kept to the minimum required by its new function with offices on the ground floor and the first floor while the basement is a single room, which hosts occasional small artistic events, lectures, seminars etc. ŒïœÖœÅœâœÄŒ±œäŒ∫œå Œ†ŒøŒªŒπœÑŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫œå ŒöŒ≠ŒΩœÑœÅŒø ŒîŒµŒªœÜœéŒΩ: ŒëŒ∏ŒÆŒΩŒ±. ==Activities== Main Event The annual central event of the European Cultural Centre of Delphi is usually organized during the first ten days of July and includes an international scientific symposium and artistic program (theater, music, visual arts, dance performances, documentaries etc.).

After the war he became a print and broadcast journalist. During the 1950s he became a publisher. Between 1953 and 1957 Karl Anders worked as the director of the publishing business of the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper group. As a publisher he devoted much effort to promoting Anglo-American criminal fiction in Germany. In the 1960s he returned to politics, although by now the youthful Communist had become a member of the moderate left-wing SPD (party). ==Life== After leaving his Berlin middle school Karl Anders (as he later became known) worked as a furniture upholsterer and undertook a traineeship as a Landscape gardener. He also attended evening classes in 1929-31 and which led the belated but successful completion of the School final exams with which, given a more academic focus and less political distraction during his teenage years, he would have concluded his secondary schooling. He joined the German Communist Party in 1929 and quickly assumed leadership roles within the party, becoming in the same year General Secretary of the \\"World Youth League\\". Between 1929 and 1931 he also served on the board of the Socialist Students' League. In 1931 her became Party Secretary for literature and propaganda in the Berlin-Brandenburg district. Two years later, in January 1933, the NSDAP (Nazi Party) took power and lost little time in establishing a one-party state in Germany. Anders nevertheless continued with his (now illegal) support for the Communist Party, becoming a Central Committee Instructor for Pressure and Propaganda. In June 1933 he was a victim of the K√∂penick Blood letting week, and was held in the SA Wendenschlo√ü detention centre where he was badly maltreated. In March 1934 Anders fled to Prague where until 1936 he was the exiled German Communist Party's leader for Agitation and Propaganda work. From 1936 till 1937 he belonged to the Red Aid executive for Germany. In 1937 he became a member of the Salda Committee and the organisations's Secretary for Slovakia based in Bratislava. War broke out in 1939 and Anders emigrated first to Poland, where he married Marie D√∂rrer at Krak√≥w in 1939, and then to Britain. In 1939 he was concealing his identity behind various cover names including \\"Karl Schreiber\\" and \\"Karl Schlegel\\". In 1940 the British identified him as an enemy alien and he was interned in June 1940, his detention continuing till the end of the year. It was from this time that he started to use the pseudonym \\"Karl Anders\\" in place of his birth name which had been Kurt Wilhelm Naumann. In London he joined the socialist New Beginning anti-Nazi opposition group and started working as a broadcaster with the Broadcaster of the European Revolution radio station which transmitted from London between 1940 and 1942, before being effectively subsumed into the more snappily named British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Between 1943 and 1945 Anders worked as chief editor for German language workers' broadcasts by the BBC. From 1943 he was also employed to give lectures to German prisoners of war held by the British. After the war ended, formally in May 1945, Karl Anders continued to be employed by the BBC till 1949. In addition to his BBC work he also wrote for some British newspapers. He reported (in German) for the BBC Overseas Service on the Nuremberg trials and also, at this time, wrote his first book, \\"Im N√ºrnberger Irrgarten\\",\\"Im N√ºrnberger Irrgarten\\" = \\"In the Nuremberg Maze\\" which was a re- working of some of his broadcast reports. Unusually, he was able to have his book published by his own publishing company, at this stage a small-scale operation called \\"Nest-Verlag\\" which with three colleagues he had set up locally in Nuremberg in 1946. He relocated permanently to Germany in 1949: after his three co-founders disappeared from the business his publishing house, which in 1955 relocated to Frankfurt am Main, became the focus of his career. Although the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper group took a 50% share in Neste-Verlag in 1955, Anders continued to run it single-handedly till 1960. By this time, however, in 1959 he had sold the residual 50% of it to the Frankfurter Rundschau. There followed a period of growing mutual acrimony and Anders resigned from his publishing company in 1961, returning the focus his evidently undimmed energies to politics. \\"Neste Verlag\\" had started out as a publisher of political books, but in 1948 the background for publishing in Germany changed with a reduction in demand for political books, a change in the rules governing paper rationing and the West German currency reforms. Anders' BBC career had left him with good contacts in the world of British books and authors, and these he now matched with an idea that proved timely. \\"Neste Verlag\\" became a specialist publisher of German language translations of English-language crime novels. Its better remembered (at least among English language readers) writers included Margery Allingham, Raymond Chandler, Francis Durbridge, Erle Stanley Gardner, Michael Innes and Dorothy Sayers. The German translations of the anglophone crime novels appeared in a series called \\"Kr√§hen B√ºcher\\", with print runs typically of 5,000 copies. However, the appetite for them faded in the 1960s and the Frankfurter Rundschau in turn sold the business on, after which it faded from the scene. In 1961 Karl Anders accepted the invitation to join the national election team of the Social Democratic Party (SPD / Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands). He also served, between 1971 and 1974, as a member of the party's \\"Core Values Commission\\" (\\"Grundwerte-Kommission\\"). He was an adviser to the IG Bau-Steine-Erden trades union, which led to the publication in 1969 of his history of the trades union under the title \\"Stein f√ºr Stein\\" (\\"Stone for stone\\"). He continued to write, also remaining active as a contributor to the party newspaper, Vorw√§rts. ==Death== Karl Anders died in 1997 at Dreieich, on the south side of Frankfurt am Main, and to the north of Darmstadt. ==Honour== *1967: Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany 1st class ==References== Category:20th-century publishers (people) Category:German radio journalists Category:Officers Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Category:Communist Party of Germany politicians Category:Social Democratic Party of Germany politicians Category:German resistance members Category:Exiles from Nazi Germany Category:Nuremberg trials Category:1907 births Category:1997 deaths ","title":"Karl Anders"},{"id":"46312426","text":"The Rhineland Football Association (), the FVR, is one of 21 state organisations of the German Football Association, the DFB, and covers the northern part of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate.Regional Associations DFB website - Map and details of the regional associations, accessed: 4 April 2015 DFB, its five regional and 21 state associations The FVR is also part of the Southwestern Regional Football Association, one of five regional federations in Germany.

In red, canals proposed in parliament, which rejected the proposal. Amsterdam's connection to the Rhine was improved much later and Rotterdam went on to dominate the trade on the German hinterland Some beurtships in the Singel in Amsterdam, around 1570 The 1911 beurtvaart ship St√¢nfries X Wikimedia Commons Beurtvaart was a Dutch line shipping system for (mostly) inland navigation, that existed from the late 15th century. It was a form of packet trade and a precursor of public transport. The beurtships transported passengers, livestock and freight along fixed routes at fixed prices. Departures were scheduled, with ships even sailing when not fully laden, and local authorities took legal measures to rule out the competition. ==Background== The Netherlands is a country particularly rich in waterways. Next to many natural ones, a fair number of canals have been dug over the centuries. Between 1632 and 1665 alone, in the heyday of the Dutch Golden Age, 658 km of canal was constructed by cities and investors. Also, the Zuiderzee, a large body of water in the middle of the northern part of the country, was a major interchange for shipping. Roads on the other hand, were of poor quality if they existed at all. A road network of some significance wasn't constructed until the early 19th century. Consequently, all cities of any importance were on a waterfront and water transport between them grew with an expanding economy from the late 15th century. Before the beurtvaart merchants had to hire an entire ship if they wanted something transported, although middlemen like shipbrokers probably saw to some break bulk cargo as well. From the end of the 15th century wealth and trade were growing in the Netherlands, pushing the demand for transportation. Meanwhile, the cities increasingly involved themselves in regulating the transport business, primarily to advance their own skippers at the expense of those from other places. For instance, the right of lastbreken meant that a shipment of goods had to be unloaded upon arrival, involving fees for porters, warehouses and such. The medieval staple right is another example. As competing skippers would regularly get involved in fistfights over rights, shipments and times to load and sail, the cities made more and more rules and regulations. ==The system== Beurtvaart was set up as a contract between two cities or a city and a lord. The two would enter negotiations to establish the demand for transport, fix prices and schedules, and make a list of requirements for the ships and the skippers. Then ship owners were bound to the system by licenses and competition was made impossible. For instance, merchants shipping goods to another city were obliged to make use of the beurtvaart. On the other hand, ships had to sail at scheduled times, fully laden or not. The system guaranteed travellers and merchants reliable shipping at fixed prices and it provided the skippers with a reasonable income, even in bad times. The skippers were organised in guilds, that further regulated the system and saw to day-to-day operations. Sometimes a guild would own the ships collectively, but in most of the cases the skipper owned the ship he sailed. The cities had the ships inspected yearly and made increasingly long lists of requirements for ship and skipper, with fines for all kinds of reasons. The freight carried was usually break bulk cargo, while bulk was left to an early form of tramp trade. The passenger service of the trekschuit was related to the beurtvaart, but not the same thing. The system evolved in the course of more than a century, with the beurtvaart coming of age around 1600. Open sea, international While most ships sailed inland, the beurtships also travelled the open sea, like the Zuiderzee and the Wadden Sea. Amsterdam had beurtvaart contacts with London and Rouen from 1611, Hamburg in 1613 and Dunkirk in 1699. In the Southern Netherlands the system flourished as well, but only in the western parts. Some German cities had beurtvaart connections with Dutch ones, and after that between them as well. ==History== Some form of scheduled transportation probably originated in the 15th century, with marktveren (market ferries) providing reliable transport of goods into the cities on market days. Most of these connections were maintained by the skippers or their guilds. In 1488 a veer was organised between the towns of Antwerp and Veere, with a certain amount of regulation. In 1510 a veer was arranged by skippers between Amsterdam and Spaarndam and ten years later one between Haarlem and Amsterdam, regulated unilaterally by the latter. The fee for one traveller was set at five stuivers, double that in the case of bad weather. In 1529 a bilaterally organised beurtveer was arranged between Hoorn and Amsterdam. Especially in the second half of the 16th century connections were established between most of the major cities and some of the minor ones as well. In 1594 The Hague regulated a line to Amsterdam unilaterally. It was the first time a legal monopoly for local skippers went hand in hand with the obligation to sail at scheduled times, which became the habit of the system. After this, the beurtvaart grew to an extensive network spanning the coastal provinces of the Netherlands, most prominently Holland. An observer in Amsterdam in 1765 estimated some 800 departures to 180 destinations weekly. One source states that the beurtvaart system is in part responsible for the fact that in the Netherlands not one port was growing to dominate the sea trade, as was the case in surrounding countries.Ormrod, D. (2003); The Rise of Commercial Empires. England and the Netherlands in the Age of Mercantilism, 1650‚Äì1770, Cambridge, p. 13. Online here, retrieved 4 April 2015. When early 19th century the guilds were legally abolished, the beurtvaart system was continued by royal decree. Later that century however, when the age of liberalism came to the Netherlands, pressure was on to end the system. In 1841 in the legal protection of the beurtvaart national government made an exception for steamship companies. Between 1859 and 1880 local and national authorities withdrew legal intervention, ending the beurtvaart in a stricter sense. Shipping companies With legal protection withdrawn, and under competition from the railways, inland line shipping did not wither: it flourished instead. Main reasons for this are the industrialisation in the Netherlands and Germany, greatly pushing the demand for transportation, and the fact that the Dutch network of waterways is far more intricate than the railways would ever be. In the innovative time of iron built steam ships, a great number of small shipping companies sprang up. They were known as beurtvaartrederijen (beurtvaart shipping companies) and they continued to provide scheduled services between local ports. At first, all of them carried passengers, livestock and freight, but some withdrew to passenger service only, becoming more like public transport companies. Some companies grew, others merged and a few went bankrupt, but overall they were quite successful. In 1872 164 steamships were in service, owned by 110 entrepreneurs, most of them on one route. By 1890 the number had grown to 201. Company revenue was good in this period, with a per annum dividend of 8-10% for most of them, and more for some. Companies like Alkmaar Packet and Verschure & Co. at some point each owned in excess of 20 ships. The largest was J. & A. van der Schuyt, which operated 78 steam vessels in 1917. Belgium The young country of Belgium had chosen to rapidly build an intricate railway network, which would carry freight to a greater extent than the Dutch one. For these reasons in Belgium beurtvaart companies were not of the importance they had in the northern Netherlands.

From the 1920s onward, they could maintain a business by switching to the internal combustion engine, for which investment and operating cost were not as high as for steam engines. Two sources estimate the number of inland ships in service of the beurtvaart around 1890 to be a 1000. A government agency counted 1804 of them in 1910. Competition, war Between the 1910s and the late 1930s Dutch inland navigation faced growing competition from the railways, but especially from the truck, as both trucks and roads were getting better. Truck transport is profitable at a much lower rate of loading than a steam ship. During the time of the Great Depression this competing edge became painfully clear, with numbers of ships and shipping lines declining fast after 1934. Some companies started to operate truck lines of their own, at first to service their ships and later competing with them. WWII and after World War II was an outright disaster, as ships were lost to acts of war or were claimed. Companies like Van der Schuyt lost ships, the yard and offices in the Rotterdam Blitz. Large exclusion zones imposed by German forces meant a lot less demand for transportation. Getting back in business after the war proved difficult for all inland shipping companies, impossible for some. Especially the years 1947 and 1948 saw many liquidations, mergers and some shipping lines becoming trucking companies. A few inland lines kept operating into the 1960s, but by 1970 beurtvaart had ended. ==See also== * Dutch barge ==Sources== * Brouwer, P. and G. van Kesteren, with A.

Three years later, in 1950, the music of the play was written following a cooperation between Manos Hadjidakis and Sikelianos.Œ£Œ±ŒΩ œÉŒÆŒºŒµœÅŒ± ¬´Œ≠œÜœÖŒ≥Œµ¬ª Œ±œÄœå œÑŒ∑ Œ∂œâŒÆ Œø ŒúŒ¨ŒΩŒøœÇ ŒßŒ±œÑŒ∂ŒπŒ¥Œ¨Œ∫ŒπœÇ. ==Plot== The work focuses on the last moments of Digenis Akritas. Sikelianos uses the acritic cycle (frontiersmen tales) for the historical material (i.e. the conditions and some historical figures of the time, such as the Byzantine Emperors Michael III and Basil I) and the image of Digenis, whom he places as leader of a heretic group of paulician warriors, adjusting and transforming the historical material according to his own dramaturgical and ideological objectives (particularly the importance of the hero's tomb and other relevant issues). Mainly due to its second name, this tragedy has been associated with the third part of the lost Promethean trilogy by Aeschylus, Prometheus Unbound, with Digenis being presented by Sikelianos with the same characteristics: a social and cultural fighter - revolutionary for the good of the people ‚Äì Prometheus, more or less, offers culture to mankind ‚Äì a hero that links Christ and Prometheus, while there are other scholars‚Äô opinions that consider Hercules top have served as a model, as well as Oedipus (mainly in relation to the issue of the initiation of the hero and his death - as the return to Mother Earth). In general, ancient Greek tragedy - not only the lost Promethean trilogy - has been used by Sikelianos for the rendering of other persons through an implicit link with characters of ancient drama (Emperor Michael III, Monk Hilarion). The scene with the impious communion of Digenis is considered to be the centre of the play (some Orthodox symbols are being declared void in a \\"blasphemous\\" way ‚Äì for example the cross, the symbolism of which is sought to change from a symbol of martyrdom into a \\"tree of life\\", set in a natural habitat of unsurpassed beauty, which is also the set for the death of Digenis. Perhaps this is a way to demonstrate the heretical thought of the Paulicians).ŒòŒµœåŒ¥œâœÅŒøœÇ ŒûœçŒ¥Œ∑œÇ, ¬´ŒüŒπ œÑœÅŒ±Œ≥œâŒ¥ŒØŒµœÇ œÑŒøœÖ Œ£ŒπŒ∫ŒµŒªŒπŒ±ŒΩŒøœç¬ª, œÄŒµœÅ.

The first performance was held in Athens, in 1933. This play, is fermented through the beliefs of Sikelianos for Delphi, the Delphic Idea, and the two, already completed, Delphic Festivals (containing in their programme the staging of tragedies: \\"Prometheus Bound\\" during the first Delphic Festival and the \\"Suppliants\\" in the second). The play, was translated into English in 1939.Bruce Merry, Encyclopedia of Modern Greek Literature, 2004, p. 397. ==Plot== The tragedy is inspired by the ancient Greek myth of Orpheus and this is stated by the announcement to his faithful followers and comrades that he will perform a sacrifice to the God at the top of mount Paggaio with the risk of execution and dismemberment by the sacred Maenads of Dionysus. The personae speaking are Orpheus, the First Leader of the Chorus A and the Second Leader of the Chorus B (the latter two as representatives of the large chorus of faithful-comrades following Orpheus). This tragedy has the structure of the early types of this genre, showing higher correlations with the dithyramb (exchange of responses ‚Äì partly improvised ‚Äì between the leader of the chorus or the leaders of the chorus and other persons outside the chorus) that evolves into a tragedy, more than a tragedy (with distinct principles and structure) itself. Sikelianos, influenced by the Orphic theology and its founder and leader, Orpheus, places him as Hierophant ‚Äì officiant in the myth, with clear references to Dionysus. As scholars have said, the individual symbols (besides Orpheus-Dionysus) of ear of grain (symbolizing the earth), the vine (symbolizing the intoxication of love) and, especially the rose (symbol of life embedded in love) that are eminent in the play are allegorically bound with the tragedy itself (these symbols do not lose their mystic nature throughout the course of the play) and aim at transmitting a universal message of peace, harmony and unity among all people, a \\"key\\" message to understanding all creative events of Sikelianos (literary work and organization of the Delphic Festivals ‚Äì the dedication to Delphic Idea).

As a result of this decision, Gothic, Classic and Mysterious elements were purposely included within the musical composition. This was in addition to the \\"strange mood\\" musical stylings of previous collaborator Ryujin Kiyoshi, which was seen as complementary to their intended art direction.

In 2017, the SFV had 3,113,899 members, 9,809 member clubs and 60,929 teams playing in its league system. ==History== DFB, its five regional and 21 state associations The S√ºddeutscher Fussball-Verband was formed as the Verband S√ºddeutscher Fu√üball- Vereine on 17 October 1897 in Karlsruhe in a meeting of the eight leading football clubs in Southern Germany, these being the Karlsruher FV, Ph√∂nix Karlsruhe, Fidelitas Karlsruhe, 1. FC Pforzheim, FC Heilbronn, FG 96 Mannheim, FC Hanau 93, and Germania 94 Frankfurt.100 Jahre S√ºddeutscher Fussball- Verband, p. 8 The new federation soon began to organise a regional football competition, the Southern German football championship, followed by a league system a few years later.100 Jahre S√ºddeutscher Fussball-Verband, p. 9-10Geschichte SFV website ‚Äì History, accessed: 5 April 2015 Originally the VSFV covered the Kingdom of Bavaria, the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, the Grand Duchy of Baden, the Grand Duchy of Hesse, Alsace-Lorraine, the Prussian Province of Hohenzollern, the Prussian Province of Hesse-Nassau (southern parts only) and the Prussian Rhine Province (southern parts only). Alsace- Lorraine ceased to be part of Germany and thereby the SFV after the First World War when the territory was returned to France.S√ºddeutschlands Fussballgeschichte in Tabellenform 1897-1988, p. 4, 9 & 10 In January 1900 the VSFV was a driving force in the formation of the German Football Association, the DFB. In 1914 the VSFV renamed itself to S√ºddeutscher Fu√üball-Verband. In November 1927, the federation merged with the Southern German track and field association, forming a much enlarged federation, the S√ºddeutscher Fussball- und Leichtathletik-Verband - SFLV.100 Jahre S√ºddeutscher Fussball-Verband, p. 13-14 With the rise of the Nazis to power in 1933, the federation received the order from Berlin to disband itself in March 1933. On 6 August 1933, the SFLV held its last general meeting, in Stuttgart, where the order to disband was officially carried out. At the time the association was without a president as Eduard Kartini had died in 1932 and a new president was to be elected in 1933. Paul Flierl lead the SFLV in an acting role in its final pre-Second World War year and it was him that preserved the Southern German Championship trophy from the Nazis during this era.100 Jahre S√ºddeutscher Fussball-Verband, p. 14 The financial liquidation of the federation was completed in 1942.100 Jahre S√ºddeutscher Fussball-Verband, p. 15 Post-Second World War Germany the reestablishing of a Southern German federation seemed initially impossible as travel between occupation zones was very difficult and the area of the former SFLV was split between the U.S. and French zones. Instead, state associations were formed but these new association was not exclusively popular, as it was seen by former members of the SFLV as an obstacle to reestablish the later.50 Jahre Bayerischer Fussball-Verband, p. 21 The situation soon deteriorated into conflict as, in September 1945, a regional football league was established, the Oberliga S√ºd, which was made up of 16 of the foremost football clubs of Southern Germany. The organisers of this competition had also received the permission to reestablish the SFV from the US authorities. Below the Oberliga, the not yet officially reestablished SFV degreed that Landesligas were to be established for each of the states.100 Jahre S√ºddeutscher Fussball-Verband, p. 15-16 In 1948 professionalism was legalised when the Oberliga approved a statute for contracted players for the league,100 Jahre S√ºddeutscher Fussball- Verband, p. 17 which was expanded to the 2. Oberliga after formation of the league in 1950.100 Jahre S√ºddeutscher Fussball-Verband, p. 19 On 19 December 1949, the Southern German Football Association was officially reestablished. To alleviate any friction between the Southern German and the state associations, the state associations became a member of the SFV but the football clubs remained members of their state associations only, not the SFV. The SFV had the responsibility to organise the Oberliga and the new 2. Oberliga S√ºd, all other leagues were part of their state associations. The new SFV had already lost the Saarland as a region and, in 1950, lost the southern half of Rhineland-Palatinate as well when the South West German Football Association left the SFV in mutual consent over a dispute over whether the Oberliga should be played in one or two regional divisions. On the other hand, the SFV gained the region of northern Hesse which had not been part of the association before the Second World War.S√ºddeutschlands Fussballgeschichte in Tabellenform 1897-1988, p. 4 With the introduction of the Bundesliga in 1963 the SFV lost its premier football competition, the Oberliga S√ºd but maintained control of the second tier, the Regionalliga S√ºd. When the 2. Bundesliga was introduced in 1974 the association had to share control of the southern division of this league with the neighbouring Regional Football Association South West. When the 2. Bundesliga became a single division league the SFV lost control over the second tier as well and did not have a league under its direct control. The establishment of a new Oberliga S√ºd, now as a tier three league, was considered from 1980 onwards but such a step was not taken until 14 years later when the Regionalliga S√ºd was reestablished, now as the third tier.100 Jahre S√ºddeutscher Fussball-Verband, p. 20-23 As of 2015 the SFV organises only three leagues, the third tier Women's Regionalliga S√ºd, the Girls Under-17 Bundesliga and the Under 15 Regionalliga S√ºd. The Regionalliga S√ºd, the senior men's league it administrated since 1994, was disbanded in 2012 and replaced by the Regionalliga Bayern which coveres Bavaria and the Regionalliga S√ºdwest, which coveres the remaining area of the SFV and the area of the Regional Football Association South West. ==Presidents== The presidents of the SFV:100 Jahre S√ºddeutscher Fussball-Verband, p. 24 {  - align=\\"center\\" President Years - align=\\"center\\"  align=\\"left\\"  Friedrich Wilhelm Nohe  1898‚Äì1908 - align=\\"center\\"  align=\\"left\\"  Max Dettinger  1908‚Äì1910 - align=\\"center\\"  align=\\"left\\"  Lothar Popper  1910‚Äì1921 - align=\\"center\\"  align=\\"left\\"  Emil Flasbarth  1921‚Äì1923 - align=\\"center\\"  align=\\"left\\"  Ivo Schricker  1923‚Äì1925 - align=\\"center\\"  align=\\"left\\"  Eduard Kartini  1925‚Äì1932 - align=\\"center\\"  align=\\"left\\"  Paul Flierl (acting)  1932‚Äì1933 - align=\\"center\\"  align=\\"left\\"  Hans Huber 1949‚Äì1962 - align=\\"center\\"  align=\\"left\\"  Paul Flierl  1962‚Äì1963 - align=\\"center\\"  align=\\"left\\"  Ludwig Hopfensberger  1962‚Äì1973 - align=\\"center\\"  align=\\"left\\"  Otto Andres  1972‚Äì1975 - align=\\"center\\"  align=\\"left\\"  Ernst Knoesel  1975‚Äì1993 - align=\\"center\\"  align=\\"left\\"  Georg Heigl  1993‚Äì1999 - align=\\"center\\"  align=\\"left\\"  Rolf Hocke  1999‚Äì2011 - align=\\"center\\"  align=\\"left\\"  Rainer Koch  2011‚ÄìPresent } * After the death of Eduard Kartini in 1932 Paul Flierl became acting president of the association until a new president could be elected at the general annual meeting in 1933 but the SFLV was dissolved before this took place. ==References== Sources * 100 Jahre S√ºddeutscher Fussball-Verband - SFV, publisher: Vindelica Verlag, published: 1996 * 50 Jahre Bayerischer Fussball- Verband - BFV, publisher: Vindelica Verlag, published: 1995 * S√ºddeutschlands Fussballgeschichte in Tabellenform 1897-1988 History of Southern German football in tables, publisher & author: Ludolf Hyll ==External links== * DFB website * SFV website Category:Football in Baden-W√ºrttemberg Category:Football in Bavaria Category:Football in Hesse Category:Football governing bodies in Germany Category:1897 establishments in Germany Category:1933 disestablishments in Germany Category:1949 establishments in West Germany Category:Sports organizations established in 1897 ","title":"Southern German Football Association"},{"id":"46312603","text":"MTV Wolfenb√ºttel was a basketball club based in Wolfenb√ºttel, Germany.

He was one of the founder of Banca di Valle Camonica, Banca San Paolo di Brescia and Banco Ambrosiano. His nephew was Blessed Mos√® Tovini. He was beatified in 1998 after a miracle was found to have been attributed to his intercession. The cause still continues as it awaits confirmation of another miracle. ==Biography== Giuseppe Antonio Tovini was born in 1841 as the first of seven children to Mos√® Tovini and Rosa Malaguzzi. He went to high school in Bergamo from 1852 to 1858, and later graduated from the University of Pavia in August 1865. He then moved to Brescia in 1867 to become a lawyer and obtained all the appropriate qualifications to become a lawyer in 1868. He later married Emilia Corbolani on 6 January 1875 and they went on to have a total of ten children. One son became a Jesuit priest and two daughters became nuns. From 1871 to 1874, Tovini served as the mayor of Cividate Camuno, his birthplace. As mayor, he made important decisions in the life of the city from promoting the establishment of banks to the construction of infrastructure like railway lines. Tovini also became a member of the Secular Franciscan Order and was among the founders of a Catholic newspaper which published its first edition in 1878 after its founding on 3 April. He founded Banca di Valle Camonica in 1872, Banca San Paolo di Brescia in Brescia in 1888, Banco Ambrosiano in Milan in 1896. In 1882 he founded Saint Joseph's Kindergarten and he also established other Catholic institutions. He died in 1897 with a reputation for personal holiness. ==Beatification== The cause of beatification was introduced on 14 April 1977 under Pope Paul VI despite the fact that a process had been opened in 1948 and closed in 1957. Another process - a historical commission - continued to investigate the cause from 1992 to 1993 which resulted in the Positio being submitted in 1993 to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints for further evaluation. Pope John Paul II declared he lived a life of heroic virtue and made him Venerable on 6 April 1995 and approved a miracle attributed to his intercession on 18 December 1997. He was beatified on 20 September 1998. ==References *Hagiography Circle *Fondazione \\"Giuseppe Tovini Category:1841 births Category:1897 deaths Category:Italian beatified people Category:Beatifications by Pope John Paul II Category:19th-century venerated Christians Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope John Paul II ","title":"Giuseppe Tovini"},{"id":"46312627","text":"Athanasios Veloudios (Greek: ŒëŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒ¨œÉŒπŒøœÇ ŒíŒµŒªŒøœçŒ¥ŒπŒøœÇ, 1895 ‚Äì 1992)Lifo:ŒàŒΩŒ± Œ±œÜŒπŒ≠œÅœâŒºŒ± œÉœÑŒøŒΩ ŒºœçœÉœÑŒ∑ ŒòŒ¨ŒΩŒø ŒúŒøœçœÅœÅŒ±Œ∑-ŒíŒµŒªŒªŒøœçŒ¥ŒπŒø. was a Greek military officer, actor and writer. ==Biography== Veloudios was born in Athens in 1895.

The game released on 23 September 2015. == Plot == A Fistful of Gun is about railroad baron Clayton Boon, who has signed a contract with the devil to obtain wealth and might, because of which he is building a doomed track to the depths of hell, connecting it to the overworld. What he did not expect, however, is that an old shaman is living there, raising shootists from the dead to fight their way through the Wild West, killing the enemies they encounter and stop Boon in three acts of pure action. == Gameplay == In A Fistful of Gun, the player selects one of eleven gunslingers. Each features a different control scheme, for mouse, keyboard or gamepad. The player may choose between story, arcade and online mode, where the online mode features co-op for up to nine players. In the story mode, the player is given the opportunity to directly follow the plot or complete side-quests to obtain gold, upgraded weapons and bottles of whisky. After every stage, the player may choose one of five random skill upgrades, enhancing the character's ability. At the end of each act, the player faces a boss, who is keeping the secret to reach the next act, bringing the player nearer to antagonist Clayton Boon. == Development == A Fistful of Gun is the upgrade of FarmerGnome's free game a Fistful of Gun, set to release under the name a Fistful of Gun: For a Few Gun More. It was eventually acknowledged and picked up by Devolver Digital, supporting FarmerGnome and making him expand the game to a full, commercial release. To accomplish this, the game concluded to release as A Fistful of Gun. While the original game only featured three gunslingers, one for each device, the game was expanded to eleven playable characters, each of them including a different control scheme. Additionally, during a long and silent development phase in 2015, the story mode of three acts, with more music composed by Steven \\"Surasshu\\" Velema added to the game to suit the story. It was finally announced on 27 August 2015, that the game is going to release on 24 September 2015, however, it launched one day earlier, namely, 23 September 2015. == Reception == A Fistful of Gun received mixed reviews, and holds an average score of 62/100 on Metacritic. Stephen Turner of Destructoid praised the game, saying \\"A Fistful of Gun is a bombardment of the senses. It‚Äôs your usual post-modern, knowing wink to the camera fare; very loud, very brash, but also raising a smile with its constructive asides and one-liners.\\" However, he blamed the game's Story Mode by stating, that the Arcade Mode is where \\"A Fistful of Gun becomes more accessible, more fun.\\" The only thing Turner criticized about the game is that \\"A Fistful of Gun‚Äôs only major errors lie in its repetitive and muddied action, all blasted through an ADD pacing.\\", but still noted that it is \\"still fun and humorous\\". == References  External links == * Category:2015 video games Category:Action video games Category:Devolver Digital games Category:Shoot 'em ups Category:Video games developed in New Zealand Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Clickteam (game engine) games ","title":"A Fistful of Gun"},{"id":"46312667","text":"Boone Road Historic District is a national historic district located at Eden, Rockingham County, North Carolina.

The church's titular is Malabon's patron saint, Saint Bartholomew the Apostle whose feast day falls on every 24th day of August. ==History== A former visita of Tondo, Malabon was founded on May 21, 1599. In 1614, it became an independent parish, with Padre Luis Gutierrez as vicar prior. When Padre Diego de Robles became prior of Malabon in 1621, he began the construction of the first stone church a year after. The construction was gradual as additions were made by succeeding priests. The transept was added in 1835 under Padre Francisco Valencia. The two lateral aisles together with the media naranja dome were added when Padre Raimundo Cueto assumed the post of minister of Malabon in 1854. This was done in collaboration with architects Vina and Urquiza. In 1861, construction of the Parthenon-like facade and the twin towers began under the direction of Luciano Oliver and supervision of parish priest Padre Martin Ruiz. During World War II, San Bartolome Church suffered heavy damages and restoration began only in 1951 under the secular priest Father Trinidad. In 1958, Father Reyes took on the task of repairing the dome, transept, main altar, and the belfry. San Bartolome Church now has seven bells, two of which are dedicated to Santa Rita and one to San Bartolome. One bell has Father Guillermo Diaz's name inscribed on it. Father Diaz, OSA, was minister of Tambobong from 1881-1885. In celebration of the church's 400th anniversary, the Philippine Postal Corporation issued a limited edition stamp designed by Victorino Serevo. The stamp measures 80mm by 30mm and bears the image of St. Bartholome alongside the old Malabon Church. ==Architecture== San Bartolome Church's protruding triangular pediment, supported by the colonnade of the facade, bears Augustinian symbol and the year 1861. The facade features eight imposing ionic columns reminiscent of a Greco-Roman temple. Measuring by , the church has a central nave and two aisles, transept, and a dome in the media naranja or barrel vault style which is cupped by a campanile. The main entrance to the church is a jubilee door decorated with wood carvings. Numerous paintings framed with gold leaf line the church ceiling. A simple yet elegant retablo can be found in the sanctuary where the image of Saint Bartholomew the Apostle is surrounded by the image of the Blessed Virgin Mary above, the tabernacle below, and St. Augustine and St. Nicholas de Tolentine on both sides. The writer I.V.

His father, descended from a family of small tenant farmers residing at Coltfield in the parish of Alves in Elgin, became an inspector of masonry under the great engineer, George Stephenson, and was engaged in building the well-known skew bridge near Rainhill at the time of his son's birth. The younger George resided with his father successively at Liverpool, Coventry, and Halifax, where he attended the grammar school. == Early career == At the age of fourteen he left school and worked as a mason on the Halifax branch railway, then in course of construction. Two years later he was assistant to his elder brother James on the Trent Valley Railway. The brothers were in the employ of Thomas Brassey, with whom George remained connected for seventeen years. Brassey early appreciated his abilities, and afterwards gave him opportunity to use them. On the completion of the Trent Valley line in 1847, Findlay proceeded to London, and entered the service of Messrs. Bransome & Gwyther, contractors, by whom he was employed in building the new engine sheds of the London and North Western Railway Company at Camden Town, and the 'Round House' at Chalk Farm. He was afterwards engaged, under Messrs. Grissel & Peto, in building the new houses of parliament, and fashioned with his own hand much of the stone tracery of the great window at the east end of Westminster Hall. Within a year he left London and found employment till 1849 under Brassey's agent, Thomas Jones, in the construction of the Harecastle tunnel on the North Staffordshire Railway. On the completion of this work he undertook the contract for building the principal tunnel entrances, and was for a short time in charge of the construction of the bridges on the Churnet Valley branch of the North Staffordshire Railway between Froghall and Alton. Before the close of 1849 Brassey appointed him assistant engineer under his agent, Miles Day, in charge of the mining and brickwork of the Walton or Sutton tunnel on the Birkenhead, Lancashire, and Cheshire Railway. In 1850, when Messrs. Brassey & Field commenced the construction of the first section of the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway between Hereford and Ludlow, Findlay was appointed engineer and superintended the making of the line. On its completion in April 1852 Brassey, deciding to take a lease of it and work it himself, offered Findlay the post of manager, which he accepted after some hesitation. Brassey placed implicit confidence in him, seldom troubling himself about the details of the accounts, and only inquiring, 'George, have you got enough money in the bank to pay the rent?' In 1853, when the railway was extended from Ludlow to Hereford, it formed a connection with the Newport, Abergavenny, and Hereford Railway, which the London and North Western Company had undertaken to work. Brassey contracted to supply the locomotive power on this line, and Findlay thus first came into relations with the London and North Western Company. == Later career == In 1862 the London and North Western and Great Western Companies took a joint lease of the Shrewsbury and Hereford line. Findlay assisted in conducting this transaction, which proved of benefit to both companies. The North Western appointed him their district manager for Shropshire and South Wales. With the concurrence of the North Western board he also accepted the post of manager of the Oswestry, Newtown, and Llanidloes Railways from Thomas Savin, who had leased those lines. His authority was subsequently extended over the Hereford, Hay, and Brecon Railway; the Brecon and Merthyr, the Old Rumney Railway, and the extension of the Oswestry and Newtown Railway to Aberystwyth and Towyn. His responsibility extended to all departments on these lines, Savin leaving everything to him, including the arrangements in connection with the opening up of new districts. This arrangement with Savin lasted from January 1862 till December 1864, when Findlay realised that a change was inevitable. Savin had engaged in the promotion of the Cambrian system of railways, and Findlay perceived clearly that the system could not be commercially successful, at least for many years. He laid his views before (Sir) Richard Moon, chairman of the North Western Company, and procured his transfer at the end of 1864 to Euston station, where he was appointed general goods manager to the London and North Western Railway. In 1874 he was advanced to the post of general traffic manager, and in 1880, on the retirement of William Cawkwell, to that of general manager. While at Euston he was largely concerned in the development of the through traffic between England and Ireland by the Dublin and Holyhead route. He was a familiar figure in parliamentary committee rooms and before royal commissions from 1854 onwards, and enjoyed the reputation of being an admirable witness. He was a strong opponent of the Manchester Ship Canal, appearing as an adverse witness on six occasions. In 1888 several of his suggestions were adopted by government as modifications of the policy in regard to Irish railways, recommended by the royal commission on Irish public works. At the prolonged inquiry before the board of trade in 1889 as to the revised schedules of maximum rates and charges preferred by the companies under the railway and canal traffic bill of 1888, he was under examination for eight days, and was highly complimented by the chairman, Lord Balfour of Burleigh, on the quality of his evidence. In 1891 he declined joining the royal commission to inquire into the relations between capital and labour, but appeared before it as the chief witness on behalf of the railway companies. On the retirement of Sir Richard Moon in the same year, Findlay was offered the post of chairman of the London and North Western Company, but preferred to retain his more arduous position. In his later days he was the most prominent figure among railway men in England. He had an admirable talent for organisation and direction, and was capable of intense labour. His jocular remark to a committee of the House of Commons that he could manage all the railways in Ireland, and find time for two days' fishing a week, was based on no exaggerated estimate of his own capacity. Findlay was well known as a lecturer on railway matters, and he developed a lecture on the 'Working of an English Railway,' delivered at the Chatham School of Military Engineering, into a volume on 'The Working and Management of an English Railway' (London, 1889, 8vo), a valuable practical treatise, which had reached a fifth edition in 1894, under the editorship of S. M. Philip, and is widely studied both in England and abroad. Findlay was elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 1 December 1874. He was a lieutenant-colonel of the engineer and railway volunteer staff corps, justice of the peace for Middlesex, and from 1889 an alderman of the county council. At the Paris Exhibition in 1889 he acted as vice-president of a committee formed for the purpose of exhibiting a collection of appliances, past and present, used in the conveyance of passengers and merchandise, and was created a chevalier of the legion of honour. He was knighted on 21 May 1892. Findlay died on 26 March 1893 at his residence, Hill House, Edgware, Middlesex, and was buried at Whitchurch on 30 March. == Family == He was twice married. By his first wife, Annie, daughter of Swanston Adamson of Rugeley in Staffordshire, he had a large family, of whom four sons and two daughters survived him; she died in 1883. In 1885 he married Charlotte, daughter of Pryse Jacob of Bridgend, Glamorganshire. ==ReferencesWorks== * The Working and Management of an English Railway (2nd edition, 1889) Category:1829 births Category:1893 deaths Category:Knights Bachelor Category:London and North Western Railway people Category:Engineer and Railway Staff Corps officers Category:Members of Middlesex County Council ","title":"George Findlay (railway manager)"},{"id":"46312729","text":"A school building being used as a polling place during the 2015 election Parliamentary elections were held in Kyrgyzstan on 4 October 2015. ==Electoral system== The 120 seats in the Supreme Council were elected by proportional representation in a single nationwide constituency, with an electoral threshold of 7% on the national level, as well as 0.7 % on each of the nine provinces.

Expanding access to earlier HIV diagnosis and treatment as a means to address the global epidemic by preventing illness, death and transmission was first proposed in 2000 by Garnett et al. The term is often used to talk about treating people that are currently living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) to prevent illness, death and transmission. Although some experts narrow this to only include only preventing infections, treatment prevents illnesses such as tuberculosis and has been shown to prevent death. The dual impact on well being and its 100% effectiveness in reducing transmission makes TasP the most important element in the HIV prevention toolkit. In relation to HIV, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a three or more drug combination therapy that is used to decrease the viral load, or the measured amount of virus, in an infected individual. Such medications are used as a preventative for infected individuals to not only spread the HIV virus to their negative partners but also improve their current health to increase their lifespans. Other names for ART include highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), triple therapy and triple drug cocktail. When taken correctly, ARVs are able to diminish the presence of the HIV virus in the bodily fluids of an infected person to a level of undetectability.World Health Organization (WHO) (2012) 'Antiretroviral treatment as prevention (TASP) of HIV and TB'[pdf] Undetectability ensures that infection does not necessarily have an effect on a person's general health, and that there is no longer a risk of passing along HIV to others. Consistent adherence to an ARV regimen, monitoring, and testing are essential for continued confirmed viral suppression. Treatment as prevention rose to great prominence in 2011, as part of the HPTN 052 study, which shed light on the benefits of early treatment for HIV positive individuals. Evidence through observational, ecological and clinical trials like HTPN 052 reveal positive results in regards to the implementation of antiretroviral drugs as preventative measures against HIV transmission and the global HIV response is not focused on delivering treatment to reach at least the UN 2030 95-95-95 targets (95% of people living wth HIV diagnosed, 95% of those on treatment, and 95% of people on treatment being virally suppressed). Progress in scaling up access to treatment is brisk and as of 2018 over 23 million people are now reported to be on it. Challenges to scaling access to treatment include cost and drug resistance. However, modeling studies suggest that the costs of not providing access would be far greater and concerns regarding resistance have not been borne out despite tens of millions of people accessing treatment. Current challenges include how to change thinking from the now obsolete \\"test and wait until severely ill\\" to one where people who are at risk access rapid HIV testing and immediate treatment. TasP's legitimacy has influenced the World Health Organization's (WHO) 2015 shift from \\"test and wait\\" to \\"test and treat\\" recommendation, which push to alert as many people as possible of their HIV status through testing, and start people infected with HIV on ARVs, no matter their viral load or CD4 count.World Health Organization (WHO) (2015) 'Guideline on when to start antiretroviral therapy and on pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV' The diminished rate of new HIV infections brought about by these strategies are marked progress towards UNAIDS' 90-90-90 and 95-95-95 target to eliminate HIV/AIDS as a public health crisis by 2030.UNAIDS (2014/2017) ‚Äò90-90-90: An ambitious treatment target to help end the AIDS epidemic‚Äô[pdf] However, key populations in countries in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East may still have lower access to treatment and the benefits it brings, as a result of the stigma that surrounds HIV.UNAIDS (2016) 'Prevention Gap Report'[pdf] Understanding whether marginalized groups have access to testing and treatment are often hampered by harsh laws that do not allow for the accurate collection of data regarding these communities. In some countries answering a question about being gay in the affirmative could garner long jail sentences or even the death penalty. Estimates of the number of people who are men who have sex with men, female sex workers, and/or drug users are very difficult to ascertain, rendering understanding diagnosis and access to treatment levels also difficult to determine. TasP and test and treat to maximize access to early treatment is now the scientific proven policy and has been implemented in most countries providing treatment for people living with HIV. == HIV Prevention Trials Network Clinical Trial 052 == Early work by Quinn in Uganda demonstrated that transmission was reduced by over 90% when people living with HIV were on treatment and virally suppressed. Observational evidence accumulated and the Attia metaanalysis supported the 2008 Swiss Statement that said that those suppressed on treatment had little or no chance of transmission. Many experts, citing the Bradford Hill criteria, accepted this observational data. However, others called for randomized control trials. The HIV Prevention Trials Network conducted a clinical trial, HPTN 052, that analyzed the effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs on the HIV-1 virus. 1,783 HIV sero-discordant couples, or couples that consist of an HIV-positive individual and an HIV-negative partner, from nine different countries were a part of the study, 97% of the couples being heterosexual. In August 2011, the HIV Prevention Trials Network concluded that the likelihood of transmission between the couples who were provided early antiretroviral therapy reduced by 96%. When the trial completed, the overall reduction percentage of HIV-1 transmission between couples who were treated early with ART or received the delay-ART treatment was 93%. The study's purpose was to reveal that HIV-1 viral transmission can be prevented through treatment, leading many regions to incorporate a treatment as prevention plan into their public health policy for responding to HIV. == Implementation == Treatment as prevention has been used as a form of controlling the spread of HIV since the mid-1990s, initially in the context of preventing the transmission of the virus from mothers to their children. Research in 1994 revealed how the drug zidovudine can reduce vertical transmission. The testing and treatment of HIV-positive mothers during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding has since led to the reduction of the risk of transmission by up to 95%.World Health Organization (WHO) 'Mother-to- child transmission of HIV' [accessed 23 May 2016] A program for offering ARVs for life to any HIV-positive pregnant person called \\"Option B+\\" served as a precursor to the \\"test and treat\\" strategy that is now being rolled out in various countries.Kalua, T. et al (2017) ‚ÄòLessons Learned From Option B+ in the Evolution Toward ‚ÄúTest and Start‚Äù From Malawi, Cameroon, and the United Republic of Tanzania‚Äô Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes Assessments of the Option B+ program are able to aid in the improvement and further establishment of \\"test and treat\\". From 2013 to 2018, the global number of people receiving ARV treatment rose by a third, and now is at 23 million people.UNAIDS (2016) 'Get on the Fast-Track' [pdf] This is a result of increased use of \\"test and treat\\". In 2015, about one fourth of the 148 countries informed about national treatment plans had initiated the WHO's \\"test and treat\\" approaches, and 44 more countries pledged to implement them by the end of 2016. The five-year HPTN 071 \\"PopART\\" study is currently examining the efficacy of TasP in 21 communities throughout South Africa and Zambia.Cori, A. et al (2014) 'HPTN 071 (PopART): A Cluster-Randomized Trial of the Population Impact of an HIV Combination Prevention Intervention Including Universal Testing and Treatment: Mathematical Model' PLOS One 9(1):e84511 PopART is focused on the advantages and downfalls of providing free voluntary HIV testing in combination with instant treatment for those who test positive.London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine 'HPTN 071 (PopART)' This study has a scope of about 1 million residents, making it the largest executed test of \\"test and treat\\".HPTN (2017) ‚ÄòHPTN 071 (PopART) at CROI 2017: HPTN 071 (PopART) at CROI 2017: Mid-Study Successes and Challenges‚Äô [pdf] == Challenges and Risks Associated with Treatment as Prevention == While TasP has a huge potential to prevent the further spread of HIV worldwide, the major barrier to implementing TasP is lack of political will. Specifically, estimates suggest that only around 60% or all resources for HIV go towards ensuring diagnosis and treatment while the rest is spent on other priorities. In some African countries multiple billions of dollars have been allocated with some only achieving 60-70% ART coverage. Global HIV control priorities often include 90-90-90 and 95-95-95 (proxies for TasP coverage), however, TasP is often not included when calling for increased efforts in preventing and ending the epidemic. Many of the most vulnerable populations may not be seeing these benefits as a result of a social and political climate that is deterrent to seeking testing and treatment, in addition to making it difficult to stick with the ARV regimen. With this, antiretroviral therapy should be implemented within every country's public health policy, yet challenges and risks are faced when such implementation is put into action. While vulenrable populations often have difficulty accessing services, it is unknown what proportion of MSM, FSW and DUs are on ART due to uncertainties in determining estimating the numbers of people and the understandable reluctance for many people to disclose whether they are in these groups when accessing services.  Overall Cost of Treatment  For many countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, the overall cost of treatment in the 1990s and early 2000s was too expensive for infected patients to afford it. In addition, individuals with low incomes in United States struggle to pay high prices set by pharmaceutical companies for antiretroviral drugs. As a result, it was implausible for a global treatment system or policy to be put into place since no universal HIV/AIDS test and medication regimen existed and due to technology and wealth disparities worldwide. However, with the advent of rapid HIV testing (including self testing), viral load testing, and effective ART regimens at less than $100 per year treatment scale up (read widespread implementation of TasP) is now a reality in many settings.  Side Effects Caused by ART  Newer ART regimens are largely side effect free and side effects are no longer a major barrier to starting treatment. Additionally, newer regimens are almost 100% resistance free and can translate into lifelong effective therapy. In the past antiretroviral drugs can also cause patients to experience various side effects including becoming nauseated or suffering from gastrointestinal pains and issues, as a results of medications at times being too toxic for a specific individual. In addition, in low and middle income countries (LMICs), an increase in the number of side effects expressed in a country leads to the underdeveloped health care systems of said country having to use their limited funds to account for service delivery costs of medications to counter the newly inflicted problems among infected individuals.  HIV-1 Drug Resistance  HIV drug resistance has also come to the forefront of worries in regards to how effective TasP can be against the spread of the virus. The widespread global use of ARVs is feared to lead to an increase in drug resistance as a result of interrupted treatment and a lack of adherence. Despite these fears widespread resistance threatening the efficacy of ART has not emerged despite tens of millions of people being on treatment in the harshest conditions. Likewise fears of non-adherence also proved to be overblown. Developed countries, when first discussing the implementation of ART in the developing world, believed that the allowance of third-world countries to have early access to antiretroviral drugs would potentially lead to the development of drug resistance. Recently, such resistance has developed in third-world countries as a result of medication combinations failing to diminish the viral load of HIV-1 in infected individuals, the lack of existence of virological testing to discover such failures in patients in these regions of the world and the lack of different variants of medication regimens to suppress the evolution of the infection. In the case of resistance to the first-line of combination medications for the HIV-1 virus, mutations occurred within genes of HIV-1 viral RNA that enters T-cells within the human body. Mutations are the result of reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that is responsible for reverse-transcribing the viral RNA into viral DNA, having a high error rate when copying the viral RNA. The mutations occur within the nucleotide bases of the new viral DNA. After the mutated viral DNA is implemented into the host cell's DNA, the DNA is translated to produce viral proteins that will assist in the infecting of other surrounding cells. When translated, the mutations lead to different amino acids formulating the viral proteins. The primary proteins that are focused upon in relation to HIV-1 are the viral protease and reverse transcriptase because these enzymes are the ones that are inhibited by antiretroviral medications. Overall, the transmitted drug resistance (TDR) among resource-limited setting (RLS) adults in regions such as Africa, Asia and Brazil has increased, the calculated rate of TDR being 6.6% as of 2015. In addition, studies that were conducted within these regions revealed a correlation between the length of time ART was implemented as a method of treatment and the likelihood of the establishment of TDR. The studies concluded that the likelihood of TDR in LMICs is 1.7 times greater if ART is implemented for equal to or more than five years.  Necessity for Adherence  Antiretroviral therapy requires HIV-positive individuals to abide by strict adherence and thrives when countries have the necessary HIV services available for infected individuals to access. Management of HIV/AIDS includes services such as HIV testing and diagnosing, consistent HIV care and treatment, education lessons regarding how to use ART effectively and distribution methods to ensure individuals receive their medications. In LMICs, HIV testing has expanded, which, in turn, creates the opportunity for the initiation of treatment as a preventative method as an increasing number of infected individuals are aware of their HIV status. == Short-Term and Long- Term Solutions ==  Global Fund  In 2002, The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund)was a financial initiative developed to raise and provide funding to the developing world in an attempt to enhance their care and treatment programs for individuals who are living with HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. For the international organization to be successful, developed countries must work in conjunction with third-world countries, private organizations, civil society and afflicted communities to ease the impact of the epidemics. In an attempt to prevent the misuse of funding provided by the Global Fund, a system has been set in place for countries to apply for funding through submission of proposals and implementation plans. As a result of the impact of the Global Fund, seventeen and a half million people are being treated with antiretroviral therapy as of 2017.  PEPFAR  In 2003, in an attempt to promote the importance of HIV research and funding, George W. Bush enacted the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR/Emergency Plan), committing the United States government to authorize $15 billion to support HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB) and malaria over a five- year period in third-world countries. With the improvement of ART treatment as a result of PEPFAR, the number of new infections has declined by 51-76% worldwide since the enactment of the Emergency Plan. In addition, the funding received from PEPFAR has allowed developing countries to treat millions, prevent millions of new infections and provide other care services to millions of already infected individuals.  Generic Drugs  Antiretroviral generic drugsare medications that are identical to brand names drugs. Pharmaceutical companies in Brazil and India like Cipla and Farmanguinhos have dedicated their efforts to reduce the prices of ART drugs. For example, Cipla has reduced prices of antiretroviral drugs for poor third-world countries to practically zero. Through their initiatives in combination with pharmaceutical companies in Brazil, individuals in third-world countries are being provided access to antiretroviral treatment regimens that they could not afford before. Today, ART drug combinations cost $75 dollars in Africa. With the providing of generic drugs at such low costs in the developing world brings about turmoil regarding the current expensive prices of antiretroviral drugs in the United States. Antiretroviral drug regimens in the United States range in price from $10,000 to $40,000 as a result of pharmaceutical companies having control of price regulation. With this, the future of price reduction in the United States depends on pharmaceutical competition and negotiation to make antiretroviral drugs available to all low- and middle-income individuals despite where they may live in the world.  \\"Community-Based Care\\"  \\"Community-based care\\" refers to communities with high rates of HIV transmission and infected individuals taking the initiative to end the spread of AIDS within their own community. Community based care services include access to: * HIV testing * directly observed therapy with HAART (DOT-HAART) ** DOT-HAART refers to the administration and delivery of antiretroviral drugs by community members to ensure individuals adhere to drug regimens. Such community members observe the taking of medications to provide guidance and clarify any questions infected individuals may have. * educational services regarding HIV transmission and prevention methods * condoms and other barrier methods * maternal-child transmission packages * social services for families and orphaned children * other services to ensure suppression of HIV transmission The utilization of community-based care assists in the efforts in diminishing HIV transmission to reduce the number of new infections annually. There have been studies of key populations in communities like Cape Town, South Africa that assert the benefits of community-based approaches, like adherence \\"clubs\\", where participants meet every two months for group counseling and the distribution of their ARV treatments.  Cost- Effectiveness  In South Africa and India, a clinical trial was completed to determine the cost-effectiveness of administering antiretroviral drugs early to treat HIV. Sero-discordant couples were used in the study and each couple was provided either early or delayed antiretroviral treatment. Over a five- year period, researchers concluded that early ART was cost-saving in South Africa and cost-effective in India. Over a lifetime, early ART was determined to be very cost-effective in both countries. After the release of such results, other countries have concluded that it is cost-effective to utilize combination therapy resources especially when implementing them early into practice.  Single-tablet Regimens  When doctors prescribe antiretroviral drugs to patients, the initial prescriptions consist of drug regimens that contain multiple pills of different classes that must be taken daily. Although triple therapy is most commonly used, there are single-tablet regimens (STRs) that exist to treat AIDS. STRs are created through combining three antiretroviral drugs into one pill. Single-tablet regimens are only available at specific clinics around the world‚Äîmeaning there is limited access to these regimens‚Äîand are only prescribed if a doctor feels a patient will struggle with the treatment schedule of antiretroviral therapy. The implementation of STRs worldwide could serve as a replacement for the triple-drug antiretroviral therapy and allow patients to have a less strict ART schedule to abide by.  Injectable HIV-1 Treatment  The greatest struggle faced by HIV-positive individuals is maintaining compliance of taking the ART pills every day. The lack of compliance can lead to drug failure or drug resistance. In July 2017, The Lancetreleased an article revealing the results of a study conducted involving an injectable HIV-1 treatment to serve as a future replacement for the three-drug oral combination therapy. This new treatment would consist of two drugs: cabotegravir and rilpivirine, and injections would occur every four to eight weeks for each patient. Thus far, the treatment has passed Phase II of the clinical trial and has been proven to be just as effective as the oral regimen. In August 2018, ViiV Healthcare, a collaboration between GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer revealed the findings of a study that found that receiving monthly injections of two long-acting ARVs over a course of 48 weeks is just as effective as taking daily pills. However, logistical questions still remain about cost, the effect of missed shots, and side effects of taking monthly injections. The study, which is called Antiretroviral Therapy as Long-Acting Suppression (ATLAS) is experimenting with the drugs cabotegravir‚Äîmade by ViiV‚Äîand rilpivrine, which is a licensed drug from Janssen Sciences Ireland UC. ATLAS has a scope of 618 HIV-positive individuals from 13 countries, all of which had reached undetectability. Half of the participants continued with daily pills, while the others switched to receiving an injection each month. Viral suppression was the same in both groups. The results of the ATLAS study may also impact those who are not yet infected and are participating in PrEP, yet are reluctant to take daily pills. Other studies are underway which are testing viral suppression in HIV-positive people who have never taken antiretrovirals, and whether the injectables are still effective when only taken once every 8 weeks. With the introduction of long-acting drugs come questions on the optimal dose and timing, and how the virus may mutate to become resistant to the new form of treatment. == Moving Forward == Treatment as prevention has the ability to shift the paradigm of how HIV is received and treated. The effects of universal testing and treatment, and connecting people with resources for care will allow for global effects in terms of reduced rates of new HIV infections.Smith, L. et al (2011) 'HIV-1 treatment as prevention: the good, the bad, and the challenges' Current Opinion in HIV and AIDS 6(4):315-325 The success of TasP is contingent upon innovation in strategies to increase the rate of HIV testing, along with exploring other dimensions of improving adherence, such as including cognitive and emotional support in those efforts.Dewing, S. et al (2014) 'Antiretroviral adherence interventions in Southern Africa: implications for using HIV treatments for prevention' Current HIV/AIDS Reports 11(1):63-71Scheurer, D. et al (2012) 'Association between different types of social support and medication adherence' The American Journal of Managed Care 18(12):461-467 The cost of viral load testing is another factor in TasP's longevity, and increased access to that resource will allow for greater access to the beneficial effects of treatment as prevention. ==References== Category:Prevention of HIV/AIDS ","title":"Treatment as prevention"},{"id":"46312751","text":"Herbert Edward Stacy Abbott CBE, DSO (6 April 1855 ‚Äì 13 June 1939) was a British Army officer and an English amateur cricketer who made one appearance in first-class cricket.

He came from a family of local dukes, Bojƒçiƒás (alternative spelling: Bojiƒçiƒá), rich merchants who controlled the famous mines. As the Ottoman authorities tightened control of Kratovo reducing its autonomy, his father, duke Nikola Bojƒçiƒá, decided to become a monk. After that he turned Mihailo, still a young man, to the custody of the Serbian Patriarch Pajsije I. Mihailo spent his youth in the Patriarchal Monastery of Peƒá and was ordained as an archdeacon.

Perhaps this happened for the same reason a few years later patriarch Gavrilo I had to flee for Russia: due to the War of Candia the Ottomans were very suspicious of any connections with the West, which the Serbian Patriarchs cherished, hoping for material help of the impoverished and highly taxed church.

However, he stayed only until Easter of 1654 when he once again came to Mount Athos. In 1656 he went onto a pilgrimage visiting Jerusalem on Easter 1657. From there he traveled back to Russia via Egypt, Constantinople, Mount Athos, Moldavia, Wallachia and Poland. He stayed in Russia until 1660. The last years of his life Mihailo spent in Chilandar where he lived in the hermit's cell of Saint Nicholas.

She was to represent Armenia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 with the song \\"Chains on You\\". ==Career== Manoukian's first experience in the music industry was in 2007, when she participated in and won first prize at a talent contest called \\"This Is What's Missing\\", an international TV show production of Alpha Television Network Greece. A year later, in 2008, she participated in the Greek national selection for the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2008 with the song \\"To Fili Tis Aphroditis\\" where she placed seventh . In 2011, Manoukian released her first single named \\"Party Like A Freak\\", which became one of the biggest hit singles in Greece and has over a million views on YouTube. Following the success of \\"Party Like A Freak\\", which was nominated twice for winning an award at the MAD Video Music Awards, in 2012 she released a follow-up single \\"I Surrender\\" which instantly became the summer hit of year. She added a new song to her music discography a few months later named \\"Na Les Pos M' agapas\\". Manoukian also received a Gold Disc for \\"Party Like A Freak\\", \\"I Surrender\\" and Na Les Pos M'agapas. In 2014, Manoukian released the single \\"XO\\", published by Warner/Chappell and Max Music Scandinavia. The track was recorded in Sweden, Stockholm, and its music video was shot in Australia, Sydney with a successful music video and had great success in Europe, Asia, Australia and America. A collaboration of a team behind the likes of Celine Dion, Madonna, Selena Gomez, Ace of Base, Ashley Tisdale, Enrique Iglesias, Ola Svensson, Jennifer Lopez, GLEE and several others. She also reached number 1 in charts and won the Armenian Pulse Awards competition for Best Song In English. She also won the European Song Contest in Armenia with 122 votes. In 2017, Manoukian broke into the music industry as a songwriter and wrote the music and lyrics for \\"Palia Mou Agapi\\", performed by Helena Paparizou, the winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 2005. Manoukian got a Platinum Disc, as the song reached over a thousand sales. In 2018, Manoukian she did a guest audition appearance on the UK version of The X Factor, which reached the front page of the newspaper The Sun and got coverage in many more major newspapers and magazines, talking about the fierce stage presence. She amazed the judges Louis Tomlinson from One Direction, Simon Cowell, Robbie Williams and Ayda Field, and, as a result, her live show appearance went viral. She was also being discussed to represent Armenia in Eurovision Song Contest, particularly in 2015 and 2016. She discussed a desire to compete in Eurovision for either Armenia, Greece, or Cyprus. She won Depi Evratesil 2020, the third season of the Armenian national selection and was supposed to represent Armenia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands with the Hip-Hop and R&B; inspired song \\"Chains on You\\". However this event was cancelled due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic and replaced with Eurovision: Europe Shine a Light and Eurovision Song Celebration, which revealed she would have performed 14th in heat 2. She also appeared on BBC's Newsbeat documentary about the cancellation of the contest, sending a video message to fans, along with several other acts. On the same weekend as Shine A Light, she released a new Tropical house inspired song \\"Dolla\\", one of 5 would-be 2020 entries to release new music that weekend. She was the creative, artistic and the main director of \\"Dolla\\"'s music video, which she released in July that year. Before Depi Evratesil had taken place, and before the COVID-19 pandemic forced Eurovision to be cancelled, she had revealed she was working on a first full- length album in an interview with Wiwibloggs chief editor William Lee Adams. ==Discography== Singles ;As lead artist { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:15em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:1em;\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" Album - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"I Surrender\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2012  rowspan=\\"3\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Na Les Pos M'Agapas\\" (featuring S i N) - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"XO\\"  2014 - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Chains on You\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2020  rowspan=\\"2\\"TBA - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Dolla\\" } ;As featured artist { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:15em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:1em;\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" Album - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Party Like a Freak\\" (DJ Kas featuring Athena Manoukian)  2011  } ==Awards== {  style=\\"font-size:90%;\\" !

More specifically, in the morning (at around 10:00) the visitors gathered in front of the Archaeological Museum of Delphi in order to take a tour around the ancient monuments and the exhibits in the museum led by Greek and foreign archaeologists. At 1.00 p.m. food was served and at 4.30 p.m. the visitors gathered at the sound of the trumpet from the Phaedriades, in order to go to the Ancient Theatre. At 5 p.m. they watched Aeschylus' \\"Prometheus Bound\\" (as an introduction, the orchestra would execute the hymn to Apollo). Dinner was served at 8 p.m. and the day was concluded with the return of foreign visitors to the ships at Itea and at Arachova, as in those days no hotel infrastructure existed in Delphi.Œö. ŒëŒ∏.

From 10.30 until 12.30, the spectators watched the parade and the oath of the athletes, the pentathlon (consisting of race, javelin, disc throwing, long jump and wrestling), the torch relay (along with the tug of war), the sporting games and the pyrrhic dance. Some new demonstrations and sports were introduced this time, namely the equestrian show-anthippasia- maneuvers, the hoplite-race and the demonstration by archers. A respite in this heavy program were the meals that the guests were offered at 01.00 p.m. and then at 4.00‚Äì6.00 p.m. The main and most important part of the evening, the \\"closure\\" of the Second Delphic Festival was the \\"brief lectures by Greek and foreign intellectuals on the Delphic Idea,\\" the experience of these three days, and suggestions regarding the Festival. ==References== Category:History of Delphi Category:1930 in Greece Category:Festivals in Greece Category:1930 festivals Category:Angelos Sikelianos ","title":"Second Delphic Festival"},{"id":"46312829","text":"Hulme End railway station is a disused railway station in Staffordshire, England. The station was the terminus of the Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway which ran from where it made a connection with the standard gauge Waterhouses branch line of the North Staffordshire Railway. Opened in 1904, the station had a single platform and a small goods yard with two sidings laid out for the use of transporter wagons, with a section of standard gauge track at the end of each siding. The station was also the servicing and storage point for the line's locomotives and coaching stock with both a locomotive shed and a carriage shed being provided. The line became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923 but the finances of the line were poor and the line closed in 1934. After closure, the route's right of way was acquired by Staffordshire County Council and the station site at Hulme End became a car park. The station building was retained and, now restored, is used as a visitor information centre. Interestingly, it was sometimes referred to as Hulme End for Hartington.

Walsh Bay is officially defined as that body of water that stretches from the Dawes Point (Aboriginal: Tar-ra) in the north east, to the Millers Point (Aboriginal: Coodyee) in the southwest and the original shoreline has been altered to include developments now known as Piers 1 to 9. In more recent times, Walsh Bay refers to the Walsh Bay Wharves Precinct or the Walsh Bay Arts Precinct, a harbour-side area in Sydney, located next to the neighbouring suburbs of Dawes Point and Millers Point that historically was a working port. The wharves were converted to apartments, theatres, restaurants, cafes and a hotel, and in 2015 was designated as a major arts precinct. Much of the precinct is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register. The bay was first named in 1918 on drawings of a major new ‚Äòwharfage scheme‚Äô to modernise all Sydney‚Äôs docks to handle steamships and motor vehicles. The rejuvenation was planned by Henry Deane Walsh as engineer-in- chief of the Sydney Harbour Trust.

It was the first time that the first stage of an orbital rocket made a successful return and vertical landing. The successful landing of the first stage at Landing Zone 1, near the launch site, was the result of a five-year technology development program to develop a reusable launch system and came on a flight test that followed the primary launch mission. Following separation of the second stage, SpaceX conducted the eighth of its controlled booster descent tests of the spent first stage, the first in which the descent target location was on land, and also the first ever successful landing. Prior to this flight, SpaceX's two previous attempts at a vertical landing and booster recovery ended in failure to recover the rocket. The success of flight 20 marked a significant milestone en route to the company's goal of creating a reusable rocket system that would significantly reduce the cost of launching payloads into orbit. Falcon 9 flight 20 was the first launch of the substantially upgraded Falcon 9 Full Thrust version of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle. It carried 11 Orbcomm-OG2 satellites to Earth orbit. The launch was also notable as it was the first SpaceX launch following the catastrophic failure of a Falcon 9 v1.1 launch vehicle's second stage on Falcon 9 Flight 19 in June 2015. == Launch schedule history == SES announced in February 2015 that it would provide the payload on the first launch of the revised-design Falcon 9 Full Thrust (also called Falcon 9 v1.2 ). At the time, SES expected its SES-9 geostationary communications satellite would launch by September 2015. SES kept the decision despite the loss of the launch vehicle and payload of another SpaceX mission in June 2015, but postponed the launch until late 2015. On 16 October 2015, after considering all options, SpaceX announced a change: Orbcomm's 11 OG2 satellites would be the payload on the return-to- flight launch of the redesigned Falcon 9 instead of SES-9. The Orbcomm payload with its lower orbit would allow SpaceX to test relighting the second-stage engine, a capability required to successfully put the heavier SES-9 on a geostationary orbit. The launch was delayed to mid-December or later, while SES-9 was scheduled to follow within a few weeks. A required pre-launch static-fire test was initially scheduled for 16 December, but a few issues emerged with the new processes required for the colder propellants for the launch vehicle and the related ground support equipment. The test was successfully carried out on 18 December, which resulted in a launch delay of one day to 19 December (local time). The launch was subsequently delayed an additional day after statistical analysis indicated a somewhat higher probability of recovering the booster on the later date. == New launch vehicle == First stage of Falcon 9 flight 20 landing on a ground pad in December 2015 The Falcon 9 Full Thrust launch vehicle used on flight 20 had a number of significant modifications from the previous Falcon 9 v1.1 vehicle. These included: * increased second stage tank length and propellant volume * larger Merlin 1D vacuum engine nozzle * larger and stronger interstage with revised stage-separation mechanism * revised grid fin design to support the continuation of the Falcon 9 booster controlled-descent and landing tests, and ultimately, the operational Reusable Falcon 9 launch system * upgraded structure in the landing legs, also to support the reusable development program and objectives * upgraded first stage structure and octaweb engine support structure * denser liquid oxygen and RP-1 propellants through the use of subcooling, refrigeration below the typical temperature of previous Falcon 9 launch conditions. * first stage booster can reach low Earth orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite. == Launch and on-orbit test == Long-exposure of launch (left) and landing (right) during the flight. Flight 20 was launched on 22 December 2015 at 01:29 UTC (21 December, 8:29 pm local time).  Second stage re-ignition  Following successful launch and deployment of the OG2 satellites, the Merlin Vacuum (1D) second-stage engine successfully re-ignited, demonstrating its capability to launch SES-9 into geostationary transfer orbit. The engine burn de-orbited the second stage as planned for a destructive re-entry, preventing it from becoming space debris. == Payload == Falcon 9 Flight 20 carried 11 Orbcomm-OG2 second-generation satellites, which will provide enhanced ORBCOMM messaging capabilities, increased data capacity, and automatic identification systems (AIS) service. All 11 satellites were successfully deployed by the Falcon 9 second stage, beginning approximately 14 minutes after takeoff. All 11 satellites successfully checked in with ground control stations. The satellites were placed by the launch vehicle \\"within a fraction of a degree in inclination and in altitude of the intended orbit,\\" and by 9 January, were in the middle of on-orbit testing, while executing propulsion maneuvers that had spread the 11 satellites over a orbital arc.OG2 Mission 2 Launch Update, ORBCOMM, 8 January 2016, accessed 10 January 2016. Initial ORBCOMM customer message traffic began to be tested by late January. Satflare reported in February 2016 that one of the 11 flight 2 satellites will reenter Earth's atmosphere in late-February 2016. The satellite manufacturer, Sierra Nevada, completed checkout work and handed all 11 satellites off to ORBCOMM in early March.Sierra Nevada: We have handed to Orbcomm operational control of all 11 OG2 sats launched in December, Peter B DeSelding of Space News, 6 March 2016] == Post-mission landing == SpaceX performed a controlled-descent test on the rocket's first stage‚Äîthe eighth propulsive return test of the series. For the first time, SpaceX was able to vertically land and successfully recover the first stage. Earlier tests had proven the high-altitude deceleration and atmospheric re-entry portions of the test protocol, but no landing attempt had previously been successful, including two attempts earlier in 2015 to land a first stage on a floating landing platform. The entire controlled-descent through the atmosphere and landing attempt is an arrangement that is unusual for other launch vehicles. The flight test was planned for the twentieth Falcon 9 launch, even after the manifested payload was switched from SES-9 to the 11-satellite Orbcomm OG-2 payload. SpaceX preparing for Static Fire test on first Full Thrust Falcon 9 First Stage, 24 October 2015, accessed 26 October 2015. The test was scheduled for and successfully carried out on 21 December 2015, when the first stage landed intact at Landing Zone 1. SpaceX decided not to fly the B1019 again. Rather, the rocket was moved a few miles north to Launch Pad 39A, recently refurbished by SpaceX at the adjacent Kennedy Space Center, to conduct a static fire test. This test aimed to assess the health of the recovered booster and the capability of this rocket design to fly repeatedly in the future. The historic booster was eventually displayed outside SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California.  Evaluation of the recovered first stage  thumb On 31 December, SpaceX announced that no damage had been found on the stage and that it was ready to perform a static fire again. Falcon 9 back in the hangar at Cape Canaveral. No damage found, ready to fire again., Elon Musk, via Twitter, 31 December 2015, accessed 2 January 2016. SpaceX had initially moved the booster to their hangar at LC 39A, but they moved the stage to LC 40‚Äîthe pad from which it was launched‚Äîon 12 January. On 15 January 2016, SpaceX conducted the static fire test on the recovered booster, obtaining good overall results except for one of the outer engines experiencing thrust fluctuations. Elon Musk reported that this may have been due to debris ingestion. Falcon 9 booster fires again at Cape Canaveral, Spaceflight Now, 16 January 2016, accessed 18 January 2016. In February 2016, SpaceX President and COO Gwynne Shotwell indicated that some unspecified modifications to the stage design would occur as a result of the booster's post-flight evaluation and static fire. == Display == In August 2016, the returned first stage was put on permanent display on a stand outside SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California. == Live coverage == SpaceX live coverage of the launch and landing included cheering crowds and tours of the SpaceX manufacturing and launch facilities. The Atlantic technology editor Robinson Meyer called the scripted broadcast \\"a way of treating a rocket launch not like a dry engineering procedure, but like some combination of the Macy‚Äôs Thanksgiving Day Parade and the Super Bowl\\". Upon the unprecedented first stage landing, a SpaceX engineer announced \\"The Falcon has landed\\", reminding audiences of the first Apollo landing. ==See also== * List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches ==References * SpaceX video of full mission * Musk pre-launch backgrounder on Falcon 9 Flight 20, 22 December 2015. * Round-trip rocket flight gives SpaceX a trifecta of successes, SpaceflightNow, 22 December 2015. * Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX returns to flight and pulls off dramatic, historic landing, Washington Post, December 2015.

The three members of Waiora are Horomona Horo, Korey Atama, and Joshua Henare Rogers. The musical performances of Waiora are centred upon the ancient cultural practices of the Maori people and their musical instruments commonly referred to as taonga p≈´oro. Their performances combine elements of traditional war dances or haka, melodic songs with lyrics written in the Maori language, and instrumental music that fuses the mystical sounds of taonga p≈´oro with guitar and percussive instruments from around the globe. When the group was formed in early 2013 Waiora was originally a duo with the founding members being Horomona Horo and Joshua Henare Rogers. In March 2014 Korey Atama joined the group just before Waiora's performance at WOMAD Taranaki. Historically the concept of Waiora was formed many years earlier in 2002 at a taonga p≈´oro workshop held at the Heitiki Art Gallery in Rotorua, New Zealand. Taonga p≈´oro expert Richard Nunns and his proteg√© Horomona Horo were tutoring the workshop.

In 2014 he became the first and only Spanish to win a transoceanic single-handed race, the Route du Rhum. Alex Pella made history once again, on the 26th of January 2017, when he broke, with the rest of the team, the absolute round-the-world speed sailing record, known as the Jules Verne Trophy., aboard the sophisticated maxi-multihull IDEC 3. They circumnavigated the planet in 40 days, 23 hours, 30 minutes and 30 seconds. ==Early life== Alex was born in Barcelona on 2 November 1972, within a nautical environment and a sailing family. Second of four brothers, who have all made boats and sailing their profession, he began to sail as a very young boy aboard his family‚Äôs yacht. To date, Alex has sailed on all kinds of racing boats, from the light Mini Transat 6.50 to the most sophisticated Maxi-Trimarans. Alex has been a professional sailor for over 15 years, in which he has completed more than 150.000 nautical miles. He discovered his passion for offshore single-handed sailing at the end of the 1990s while preparing two Spanish boats for the Solitaire du Figaro. In his first internationally renowned race -the Mini Transat 6.50 - Alex Pella obtained the best classifications in history for a non-French skipper. He was third in 2003 and second in 2005, winning the long leg from the Canary Islands to Brazil. He thus became the first and only Spanish to win a leg in a transoceanic solo race. ==Other accomplishments== On 19 November 2014, Alex Pella wins the Route du Rhum aboard the \\"Tales II\\" and becomes the first and only Spanish to win a transoceanic single-handed regatta. Alex Pella wrote himself into the history books of the Route du Rhum solo Transatlantic race and Spanish ocean racing when he crossed the finish line of the 3542 miles La Route du Rhum-Destination Guadeloupe race first in Class40 at 06:47:08 hrs TU/07:47:08hrs CET/02:47:08 Local Gaudeloupe. He sets a new course record of 16d17h47m8s, beating the 2010 mark for the 40 foot Class 17d 23h 10m by 1d 5h 23m 09s. After starting off Saint Malo on his 42nd birthday, Sunday 2 November, the Spanish sailor took 16d17h47m8s to complete the 3542 miles course, at a theoretical average speed of 8.82kts. In reality he sailed 4336 miles at an average speed of 10.79kts. ==Sporting career== 2020: 3rd in IRC1 category Caribbean 600 race, 1st in Nautor Swan category.

The Sphinx of Naxos, also Sphinx of the Naxians, now in the Archaeological Museum of Delphi, is a colossal 2.22 meter tall marble statue of a sphinx, a mythical creature with the head of a woman, the chest and wings composed of the impressive feathers of a prey bird turned upward, and the body of a lioness. The Sphinx stood on a 10 meters column that culminated in one of the first Ionic capitals, and was erected next to the Temple of Apollo in Delphi, the religious center of Ancient Greece, in 560 BCE. The first fragments were excavated from the sanctuary of the Temple of Apollo in 1860. The remainder was found in 1893. It was originally set up on a stele around 560 BC as an offering to the Temple of Apollo by Naxos, one of the richest Cycladic islands at the time. The overall height of the statue, the column and its base topped 12.5 meters. The Greek sphinx, a lion with the face of a human female, was considered as having ferocious strength, and was thought of as a guardian, often flanking the entrances to temples.Stewart, Desmond. Pyramids and the Sphinx. [S.l.]: Newsweek, U.S., 72. Print. Sphinxes depictions are generally associated with architectural structures such as royal tombs or religious temples. ==Description== The famous Sphinx of the Naxians stood on a column that culminated in an Ionic capital. The statue of this mythical creature stood on a towering Ionic column, which may have been the oldest Ionic construction project in the site of the Oracle of Delphi. Her statue had been set up close to the Halos, the most sacred spot of Delphi, where Apollo had presumably killed the python. According to tradition and its mythological representation, the Sphinx had the face of a woman bearing an enigmatic smile, prey bird wings, and the body of a lioness. It was carved from a large piece of Naxian marble. The solid construction combined elements that gave the statue a character of motion and vitality, such are the details that depict the hair, chest, and wings.Œ°ŒøŒ∂ŒØŒΩŒ± ŒöŒøŒªœéŒΩŒπŒ±, Œ§Œø ŒëœÅœáŒ±ŒπŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∫œå ŒúŒøœÖœÉŒµŒØŒø ŒîŒµŒªœÜœéŒΩ, ŒöŒøŒπŒΩœâœÜŒµŒªŒ≠œÇ ŒäŒ¥œÅœÖŒºŒ± ŒôœâŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒ∑ Œ£.

It is also notable because it is an early example of carving in-the-round, as opposed to relief carving that was common during that time. The monument was made entirely of marble and reached 12.45 meters in height. The monument created awe to the visitors and constituted a typical example of Naxian sculpture in its peak period, i.e. in the sixth century B.C. On the base there was an inscription dated to 328-327 B.C., renewing the promanteia for the Naxians: Thus, the Naxians had the right to acquire oracles first. ==Other columns== Many more similar columns crowned by sphinxes were discovered in ancient Greece, as in Sparta, Athens or Spata, and some were used as funerary steles. It has also been suggested that 6th century BCE Greek columns such as the Sphinx of Naxos may have been an inspiration for the pillars of Ashoka in 3rd century BCE India, following the contacts initiated by Alexander the Great in 320 BCE, and continued by the Greco-Bactrians and the Indo-Greeks.Graeco-Indica, India's cultural contexts with the Greek world, Ramanand Vidya Bhawan, 1991, p.5 File:Pillar base of Sphinx of the Naxians (Delphi).jpgNaxos Sphinx pillar base and notice.

Berkeley participated in Operation Ariel, the evacuation of the remnants of the British Expeditionary Force from ports in western France. She was made available to Paul Reynaud and the French government for conferences with Churchill. After the Fall of France, she evacuated the remaining British embassy staff as well as W≈Çadys≈Çaw Raczkiewicz and Polish and Czech troops. In August 1940, Berkeley escorted minelayers during minelaying Operation SN32. She spent September on anti- invasion patrols in the English Channel. She escorted convoys in October and November. On 20 December 1940, she was damaged by a mine in the Medway and was repaired at Chatham Dockyard. After the repairs were completed, Berkeley resumed convoy escort duties in January 1941. On 22 February, she escorted during the minelaying Operation JK off the French coast. For the rest of the year, Berkeley escorted convoys and patrolled the English Channel. In February 1942, she participated in the unsuccessful attempt to intercept the German battleships and during the Channel Dash. Lieutenant James York became her commander on 27 March 1942. Berkeley continued convoy escort duties until July 1942, when she was selected to be part of the naval force supporting Operation Jubilee. On 18 August 1942, Berkeley escorted the Dieppe raiding force. During a 19 August air attack, she was hit by two bombs dropped from Focke-Wulf Fw 190s, which broke her keel and killed 13 ratings.

Here it inhabits clear flowing streams and it is common among the vegetation in their margins. It prefers shallow water over streambeds consisting of sand or gravel. It forms shoals. They spawn on multiple occasions between September and January, although this peaks earlier in the season. They form pairs for spawning, the eggs being deposited on aquatic vegetation to which they adhere. The eggs are large measuring 1.15-1.25 mm in diameter and have adhesive filaments. The eggs hatch after around a week and the larvae measure about 5.7 mm standard length. Their diet consist mostly of aquatic insects and their larvae, small crustaceans, algae and fish eggs. This species was described by Gilbert P. Whitley in 1948 with the type locality given as Eidsvold on the Burnett River in Queensland. Whitley may have named this species in honour of his sister Marjorie Frewer. ==References * Fishes of Australia : Craterocephalus marjoriae Marjorie's hardyhead Category:Freshwater fish of Australia Marjorie's hardyhead ","title":"Craterocephalus marjoriae"},{"id":"46312939","text":"Pieces Project is an experimental art/ comics project.

Sometimes it was also known as a tam cap or the traditional term tam o'shanter might also be used. It became popular in the early 1920s, when it followed the prevailing trends for closer-fitting hats that suited shorter hairstyles and for borrowing from men's fashion; other traditional men's hats that rose to popularity in women's fashion during this period included the top hat and bowler. ==Design and origins== Priscilla Dean wearing a tam with side draping The tam was a draped design that came in a variety of shapes and fabrics. Often it had a stiffened and close-fitting inner cap, over which fabric could be draped in a variety of ways. Along with other headgear formerly reserved for men ‚Äì including the top hat and bowler ‚Äì it was popular by the 1920s, suiting the fashion for shorter hairstyles. A 1920 article in The Guardian described the prevalence of closer fitting designs based on the tam' o shanter in combination with more ornate blouses and neater hairstyles, noting: \\"Since the majority of blouses follow Greek or quasi-Greek lines, it is natural for the hat worn with them to follow also the Greek type of headgear\\". The article noted that its versatility was another reason for current popularity: \\"it can be twisted and folded into the close-fitting shapes that are so remarkably becoming...it lends itself admirably to...all kinds of embroidery or needlework stitched apparently at random over it\\". A year later, The Guardian reported that the tam was: \\"dominating the small-hat system\\" in women's fashion. Describing this ubiquitous millinery design in more detail, it added: \\"Nor are the present tams by any means tam-like in shape. They are elongated or heightened or squared or triangularised...The tam is merely a sort of envelope which can be pulled about over an under-structure, the shape of which is all important\\". The article went on to provide tips on how to create a tam successfully at home, advising the creation of a small peak or small brim on the inner cap to create a more becoming effect. Trimmings included appliqu√©, as with this ornate design worn by Katherine MacDonald Lupe V√©lez in co- ordinated outfit and tam for the 1934 film Laughing Boy Fabrics and variations The tam could be made in a variety of fabrics, but typically drapeable materials such as felt, velvet, or silk were used. Trimmings might include embroidery or appliqu√© or it might have the addition of a buckle or brooch. Tassels and feathers were sometimes added. Some varieties might also be made of fur, or have a fur brim. By the late 1920s, less voluminous versions ‚Äì similar in design to a toque ‚Äì were in fashion in materials such as velour, a correspondent for The Times noted, adding that these simple hats were generally worn with ornate dresses. By the early 1930s, there was a revival of the tam in checks and plaids, alongside the fez and cloche-brimmed designs. In the same year, new macram√© (knotted form of weave similar to crochet) designs appeared, some being worn with matching collar and cuffs. Tam designs continued to be fashionable throughout the 1930s; The Times highlighted an outfit for Royal Ascot in 1938 comprising dress and bolero jacket with matching black velvet tam with high corners in the style of a mortar board hat. == Graduation tam == A graduation tam is an headware item of academic regalia in some institutions. They take the place of a mortarboard, and are made of black velvet with a soft top. Graduation tams are prescribed for those who have graduated with a masters or doctoral degree, and can have four, six, or eight sides, depending on the degree. Junior master's tams often have four sides, senior masters have six sides, and doctors have eight. == See also == *Cloche hat *Beret ==References== Category:1920s fashion Category:1930s fashion Category:Hats Category:Caps ","title":"Tam cap"},{"id":"46312960","text":"Brinsley Colliery was a coal mine in west Nottinghamshire, close to the boundary with Derbyshire, in what is now Broxtowe district. ==History== It was opened around 1842.

According to the myths regarding the founding of the Delphic Oracle, Zeus, in his attempt to locate the center of the earth, launched two eagles from the two ends of the world, and the eagles, starting simultaneously and flying at equal speed, crossed their paths above the area of Delphi. From this point, Zeus threw a stone from the sky to see where it will fall. The stone fell at Delphi, which since then was considered to be the center of the world, the omphalos ‚Äì \\"navel of the earth\\". Indeed, the same stone thrown by Zeus took the same name and became the symbol of Apollo, the sacred Oracle and more generally of the region of Delphi. The marble-carved stone which constituted the omphalos in the monument with the tripod and the dancers troubled the excavators, because they could not decide if it was the original or a copy from Hellenistic and Roman times. In the 2nd century A.D., Pausanias traveled to the area of Delphi and has provided us with rare evidence through his work. The stone of the omphalos seems to have been decorated in high relief and had an oval shape. It is possible that in ancient times it was covered by a mesh of wool cloth and it was kept in the adyton (inner sanctum), beside the tripod and the daphne (bay leaves), the other sacred symbols of the god. As described by Pausanias, within the woolen cloth that was wound around the stone there were precious stones designed in the shape of a mermaid, while two gilded eagles were fixed on top of it. Recent studies by French archaeologists have demonstrated that the omphalos and the columns are connected and interlocked. In other words, the stone navel was mounted on the bronze tripods supported by the three dancers, at the top of the column. This is the spot where the omphalos is thought to have been placed till today, as a cover of the column, in order to symbolically supplement the meaning and importance of the Athenian votive offering. The Athenians, wanting to placate and honor the god of light, offered him this copy of the original stone, which combined both delphic symbols as a gift from the hands of the three priestess figures of Athenian origin.ŒúœåŒΩŒπŒºŒ∑ ŒàŒ∫Œ∏ŒµœÉŒ∑ ŒëœÅœáŒ±ŒπŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∫Œøœç ŒúŒøœÖœÉŒµŒØŒøœÖ ŒîŒµŒªœÜœéŒΩ: ŒüŒºœÜŒ±ŒªœåœÇ.Œ°ŒøŒ∂ŒØŒΩŒ± ŒöŒøŒªœéŒΩŒπŒ±, Œ§Œø ŒëœÅœáŒ±ŒπŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∫œå ŒúŒøœÖœÉŒµŒØŒø ŒîŒµŒªœÜœéŒΩ, ŒëŒ∏ŒÆŒΩŒ±, Œ•œÄŒøœÖœÅŒ≥ŒµŒØŒø Œ†ŒøŒªŒπœÑŒπœÉŒºŒøœç ‚Äì Œ§Œ±ŒºŒµŒØŒø ŒëœÅœáŒ±ŒπŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ œÄœåœÅœâŒΩ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒëœÄŒ±ŒªŒªŒøœÑœÅŒπœéœÉŒµœâŒΩ, 2009, 60 ‚Äì 62.Œ†Œ¨ŒΩŒøœÇ ŒíŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ≤Œ¨ŒΩŒ∑œÇ, ŒôŒµœÅŒ¨ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒëŒ≥œéŒΩŒµœÇ œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒëœÅœáŒ±ŒØŒ± ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥Œ±.

Today, the only surviving parts are some architectural relics. It hosted two famous paintings by the famous painter Polygnotus the Thasian, namely the Capture of Troy and the Nekyia. It was built in the second quarter of the 5th century B.C. Apparently a rectangular building bearing a clerestory along its western side and possibly had a tripartite interior arrangement. In the 4th century along its southern side was added a wall for placing ex votos. ==Description== The Lesche of the Knidians is one of the most renowned buildings within the sanctuary of Apollo in Delphi, north of the temple of Apollo, due to the two famous paintings of the Thasian painter Polygnotus it hosted, namely the Capture of Troy (Iliou Persis) and the Nekyia (the visit of Odysseus to Hades). It was located on the northeast edge of the sanctuary, at an ideal spot to enjoy stunning views of the sanctuary as well as of the Delphic landscape. It was built on a steep slope which needed strong retaining walls to secure the grounds and appears to date to around the second quarter of the 5th century B.C. The building must have been constructed between 475 and 450 B.C. According to a plausible hypothesis, the lesche was built after the Battle of the Eurymedon (467 B.C.), which marked the final defeat of the Persians at the Persian Wars and the liberation of the Greek cities of Asia Minor. Regarding the use of the building, it has been suggested that it functioned as a club or restaurant. In the course of the 4th century B.C., to the south of the monument was built a wall made of local limestone, on which were possibly exhibited votive offerings, according to the model of the Treasury of the Athenians. It was a rectangular structure of approximately 19 x 10 meters in size. The north and the south sides were its long sides. Today, the only surviving parts of this rather large building are only a few parts of the wall, some stones on the west and east side and almost the entire north wall. It seems that inside the Lesche there were two rows of four wooden columns, placed symmetrically to support a clerestory. This allowed natural illumination, which apparently enhanced the beauty of the paintings. The Lesche was first excavated in 1894, but without Pouilloux, J., Fouilles de Delphes II. La r√©gion nord du sanctuaire (de l‚Äô√©poque archa√Øque √† la fin du sanctuaire), Paris 1960, 120-139. yielding any trace of the paintings. Due to the large fragmentation of the monument, scholars are not in a position to give definitive answers regarding the entrance, the windows, the roof, and the arrangement of the paintings by Polygnotos inside the Lesche. The most likely scenario is that the two painting compositions by Polygnotos extended along the long sides of the building, the north and the south, with the entrance being located in one of the narrow sides, probably the west side. Literary sources inform us that the building had many doors; this helped reconstruct the architectural design as a building with two rooms, leading to the main room where the paintings were exhibited. The reconstruction of the fa√ßade is not definitive. The roof was gabled, covered with terracotta tiles. Ancient sources say that as one entered the longitudinal building you could see the composition of Nekyia on the left and the composition of Iliou Persis (the \\"Fall of Troy\\") on the right. We are not in a position to know exactly how the building was lit, nor what colors Polygnotos used to create his painting compositions. There is also disagreement as to whether they were painted directly onto the walls (i.e. Frescoes) or on to wooden slabs which were then hung on the walls. Also unknown are the height, the length and the width of the compositions, except only through unconfirmed assumptions.Œ•œÄŒøœÖœÅŒ≥ŒµŒØŒø Œ†ŒøŒªŒπœÑŒπœÉŒºŒøœç Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒëŒ∏ŒªŒ∑œÑŒπœÉŒºŒøœç: ŒõŒ≠œÉœáŒ∑ ŒöŒΩŒπŒ¥ŒØœâŒΩ.ŒúŒ±ŒΩ.

The film stars some of Egypt's most prominent stars of the era, including Ahmed Ramzy, Rushdy Abaza, Fayza Ahmed, Naima Akef, and Zeinat Sedki. Set in a time where gypsies still roamed Egypt freely and had their own areas of living. This movie tells the tale of a rich man falling in love with a gypsy and transforming her into a socialite in order for her to be accepted by his family, and so he can win a bet. However, as the movie progresses, a love triangle forms between the girl, the rich man, and the carnival's strong man, and that leads to heightened drama. ==Plot== The movie takes place in Egypt, 1957, where gypsies still roamed and had designated living areas where they could go about their lives. In this particular gypsy living area, there is a carnival where Tamr Henna, the main character, works along with Hassan, the carnival's strong man and her love interest at the beginning of the movie. During the first part of the movie, Tamr Henna is a belly dancer, coveted by all sorts of men, both rich and poor. Hassan is jealous. During one of Tamr Henna's belly dancing performances, a rich man by the name of Ahmed sees her and strikes up a conversation. Hassan is displeased and vows to kill him, so Tamr Henna goes to Ahmed's mansion to warn him but gets caught by Ahmed's father, who sees her as nothing but a useless gypsy. Tamr Henna manages to escape the makeshift prison in which Ahmed's father locks her up, and warns Ahmed. The two then start meeting up and Ahmed convinces Tamr Henna to live with him in his mansion and promises to transform her into a socialite. He changes her name to Yasmine, buys her new clothes, and in the process convinces his father that she is from a very wealthy family. Meanwhile, Hassan searches for Tamr Henna but is unable to find her. As the movie progresses Ahmed's father starts coveting Tamr Henna for himself, because of the money he thinks she has, and so he hosts a party at which he plans to propose to her. During this glamorous party, Hassan manages to find her, with the help of Ahmed's ex-fianc√© and socialite Maysa, and vows that he will kill her. She finds out, reveals herself as a fake, and tells everyone her true occupation and origin. She flees to try to find Ahmed only to overhear him talking about the bet that he has made with his neighbor in order to fool his father. Tamr Henna is devastated and runs to her room only to find Hassan waiting for her with a knife in hand. She professes her love to him, but he stabs her. Whilst she is bleeding she says that she still loves him and he carries her back to the carnival. It is implied that Tamr Henna recovers and ends up marrying Hassan. ==Cast== Main characters: * Ahmed Ramzy as Ahmed * Rushdy Abaza as Hassan * Naima Akef as Tamr Henna Supporting actors: * Fayza Ahmed as Maysa, a socialite interested in Ahmed * Zeinat Sedki as Tamr Henna's helper and friend ==Production and direction== The movie Tamr Henna was produced and directed by Hussein Fawzi, an Egyptian film maker who studied fine arts in Italy and worked as an illustrator and designer. Fawzi started off as an actor then pursued a career in directing. He directed many notable works with his wife Naima Akef, most prominently Tamr Henna.(Armes, Dictionary of African Filmmakers) (Darwish) ==Writing== In addition to being produced and directed by Hussein Fawzi, he also had a major role in writing the movie along with Galil El Bendary. Together they collaborated to write a movie that is considered one of the best movies to ever be shown on Egyptian screens. Tamr Henna is considered one of Egypt's most valuable classics. ==Music== Even though the movie Tamr Henna had but a few songs, it is known to have one of the most memorable and influential sound tracks. The music that was written for this particular movie is still widely listened to today and many dancers use its soundtrack as music for their dancing. The songs included are all from the album Tamr Henna (1957) and all sung by Fayza Ahmed.

The circular temple, a \\"tholos\\", shares the immediate site with other ancient foundations of the Temple of Athena Pronaia, all located less than a mile east of the main ruins at Delphi, in the modern Greek regional unit of Phocis. The tholos is part of the Delphi UNESCO World Heritage Site. Tholos of Delphi ==Architecture== The architect of the \\"vaulted temple at Delphi\\" is named by Vitruvius, in De architectura Book VII, as Theodorus Phoceus (not Theodorus of Samos, whom Vitruvius names separately). Externally, twenty Doric columns supported a frieze with triglyphs and metopes. The circular wall of the cella, the central chamber of the building, was also crowned by a similar frieze, metopes and triglyphs but to a lesser extent. Inside, a stone bench was positioned on which stood ten Corinthian style pilasters, all of them attached to the concave surface of the wall. The manifold combination and blending of various architectural styles in the same building was completed through a natural polychromatic effect, resulting from the use of different materials. Materials used included Eleusinian thin slabs (called ‚Äútitanolithos‚Äù) and Pentelic marble in the superstructure and limestone at the platform. The building's eight-arched roof was also constructed of marble, and was decorated respectively by eight female statues carved in sharp and lively motion. ==The sculptures on the dome== The sculptured decoration of the dome was also beautifully crafted by hitherto unknown craftsmen. It is dated between 380 and 370 BC. High reliefs ascribed the figures of the metopes, which contributed to being easily detached from the plates and be reused as building material and tomb covers in the early Christian years after they were smoothed over again. Following strenuous and time-consuming efforts of specialists who attempted to agglutinate the fragments around the monument, we can today have at least an incomplete picture of its original form and the stylistic and decorative elements of its relief representations. In the major metopes of the outer side there are scene representations from Amazon and Centaur battles, already known from mythology and very dear to Greek sculpture. In the inside, the figures of the frieze survived unfortunately at a very small scale and with high fragmentation. They allegedly portrayed labors, either by Hercules or Theseus. Despite their fragmentary nature, the architectural reliefs on the Dome of Delphi reveal the great skill of their creators, as regards both the treatment of materials ‚Äì especially marble ‚Äì and catching details with vitality and excellent anatomical accuracy. All these novel compounds with unexpected combinations in the iconographic tradition of the 4th century BC introduce an innovative artistic movement, resulting in a creative competition between the art of relief and sculpted plastic art. Particularly to achieve the above confrontational blending of antithetical elements, the discernible elements include the high relief which may be detached from the plate of the panel, the kinesiological freedoms of the sculptures achieved through their details, as well as the dramatic intensity reflected in the figures to demonstrate the passion and the fury of the conflict of enemies in lively battle scenes.Œ°ŒøŒ∂ŒØŒΩŒ± ŒöŒøŒªœéŒΩŒπŒ±, Œ§Œø ŒëœÅœáŒ±ŒπŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∫œå ŒúŒøœÖœÉŒµŒØŒø ŒîŒµŒªœÜœéŒΩ, ŒöŒøŒπŒΩœâœÜŒµŒªŒ≠œÇ ŒäŒ¥œÅœÖŒºŒ± ŒôœâŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒ∑ Œ£.

How the case against him unraveled\\", The Washington Post, 3 April 2015 (page visited on 9 April 2015). In 2015 the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously overturned his conviction on appeal, and the state dropped all charges against him. It was unable to affirm the forensic evidence of a gun, which was the only evidence in the first trial. After being released, Hinton wrote and published a memoir The Sun Does Shine: How I Found Life and Freedom on Death Row (2018). He was portrayed by O'Shea Jackson Jr.. in the 2019 film, Just Mercy. ==Background== Incidents On February 25 and July 2, 1985, two fast food managers, John Davidson and Thomas Wayne Vason, were killed in separate incidents during armed robberies at their restaurants in Birmingham. A survivor of a third restaurant robbery picked a photo of Anthony Ray Hinton, then age 29, from a lineup, and the police investigated him. He worked at a supermarket warehouse and lived with his mother Buhlar Hinton at her home in rural Alabama, about a half hour north of Birmingham. ==Arrest, prosecution and conviction== After Hinton's arrest, his public defense attorney did not provide adequate counsel. He said to Hinton, \\"All of y'all blacks always say you didn‚Äôt do something.\\" and \\"Y'all blacks always sticking up for each other.\\" The credibility of his ballistics expert - the only one the attorney thought he could hire with the funds available - was torn apart by the prosecutor due to the expert's physical limitations and lack of experience.Anthony Ray Hinton, \\"I spent 28 years on death row \\", The Guardian, 21 October 2016 (page visited on 1 April 2018). The jury disregarded the testimony of Hinton's boss, who testified that he was at work at the time of the alleged crimes. The prosecution's only evidence at the trial was a statement that ballistics tests showed four crime scene bullets matched Hinton's mother's gun, which was discovered at her house during the investigation. No fingerprints or eyewitness testimony were introduced. Hinton was convicted of each of the two murders and sentenced to death. In June 1988, the unanimous Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Hinton's conviction and death sentence. In June 1989, that judgment was affirmed by the unanimous Supreme Court of Alabama. ==Death row== He was sent to death row, which meant that he was held in solitary confinement for nearly three decades. During his decades in prison, he was supported by his mother's unwavering faith in his innocence, as well as that of a longtime friend, Lester Bailey, who visited him monthly. His mother died in 2002. While on death row, Hinton began to read frequently. He eventually organized a book club that was allowed to meet in the prison's law library. Among the authors whom the prisoners read and discussed were James Baldwin and Harper Lee. Finally Hinton was the last prisoner left on death row. Appeals Hinton's initial appeals continued to be handled by his public defender, who lost each case. After Hinton had been on death row about a decade, Bryan Stevenson at the Equal Justice Initiative, a non-profit based in Montgomery, Alabama, picked up his case, handling his defense for 16 years. During the appeals, EJI introduced evidence from three forensics experts, including one from the FBI, showing that the bullets from the crime scenes did not match Hinton's mother's gun. But the state court of Alabama refused to overturn his convictions or grant a new trial. ==Exoneration, release and aftermath== In February 2014, the Supreme Court of the United States vacated the state court conviction in a unanimous per curiam decision. The Court ruled that Hinton's original defense lawyer had provided \\"constitutionally deficient\\" ineffective assistance of counsel, and remanded his case to the state court for retrial. Hinton's defense lawyer had wrongly thought he had only $1,000 available to hire a ballistics expert to rebut the state‚Äôs case on evidence. The only expert willing to testify at that price was a civil engineer with little ballistics training and limited by having one eye; he admitted in court to having trouble in operating the microscope. In November 2014, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals closed Hinton's case. On April 1, 2015 the Jefferson County district attorney‚Äôs office moved to drop the case. Their forensics experts were unable to match crime-scene bullets to Hinton's mother's gun. Prosecutors admitted that they could not match four bullets found at the crime scene with Hinton's gun, and that this was the only evidence offered in the original murder trial. At 9:30 am on April 3, 2015, Hinton was released from prison after Laura Petro, Jefferson County Circuit judge, overturned his conviction and the state dropped all charges against him. Hinton is the 152nd person since 1973 to be exonerated from death row in the United States, and the sixth in the state of Alabama. He said, ‚ÄúEverybody that played a part in sending me to death row, you will answer to God.‚Äù Hinton filed a claim for nearly $1.5 million in compensation for his time in jail due to wrongful conviction. The legislature has resisted approval of this payment, as state authorities say that he did not prove his innocence. Anthony Ray Hinton speaking at Politics & Prose in 2018. Since his release, Hinton has spoken in various venues about the injustices of the Alabama judicial system and other issues related to his conviction and imprisonment. He completed a memoir entitled The Sun Does Shine: How I Found Life and Freedom on Death Row (2018), and has given readings and talks around the country about the book and his experiences. On May 19, 2019, Hinton spoke at St. Bonaventure University's commencement exercises and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Human Letters degree. He had previously spoken to the students of the Class of 2019, six months after his release, in 2015. The students had been so inspired by his earlier address that over 100 of them submitted a petition to the university administration, asking that he be invited to speak at commencement. == See also == * Capital punishment in the United States * List of exonerated death row inmates * List of wrongful convictions in the United States ==References * Case page at the Equal Justice Initiative * The Death Row book club (27 min.) from the BBC World Service * \\"They Couldn‚Äôt Take My Soul\\": Anthony Ray Hinton on His Exoneration After 30 Years on Death Row, Democracy Now!

It is located 5 miles from the well-known Fort White (named after Field Marshal Sir George White) which in turn is located at halfway between the 48-mile Tedim-Kalaymyo motor car road. The inscription is a brief autobiography of him, including his genealogy, the capture of a semi- automatic rifle in a hand-to-hand combat with a British soldier during the first British invasion of Chin Hills in the year of 1888-1889, his involvement in the Sizang-Gungal rebellion of 1892-94 and also about his hunting trophies. The inscription is written in both Burmese and English. == History of Lophei == According to his own estimate, Khup Lian' was about 20 years old when he fought against the British in 1888-89. He died of old age on 3 December 1962 at Lophei. The village of Lophei was founded by his great, great, grandfather Chief Kim Lei, eleven generations before him. This village was completely destroyed by the Tashons in circa. 1800s. At that time, there were around 100 households in the village. When the British invaded Chin Hills in 1888-1889, Chief Khup Lian, with other fellow Sizang Chiefs, led some of the fiercest battles against British troops who were under the command of Major-General (later Field Marshal) George White. Khup Lian personally captured a semi- automatic rifle in hand-to-hand-combat; it was the first semi-automatic gun ever to fall into the hands of the Chin people. He then fought once again, together with the famous heroes of the Sizang-Gungal Rebellion of 1892-93: Chief Khup Pau of Khuasak and his sons Khai Kam and Mang Pum. After the failure of the rebellion, Kim Lel's descendants and the Lopheis were divided into two, independent villages of Khuasak and Lophei, in order to weaken the power of the Thuan Tek. Khup Lian‚Äòs hereditary chieftainship was restored, and his people were allowed to return to Lophei in 1894. == Full Inscription by Ex-Chief Khuplian, Lophei == I am the 15th generation down from the house of Thuan Tak who is the original progenitor of the Sizang tribe. Being an orphan from childhood I exerted myself all alone in many enterprises by which I became a self-made man with many and various achievements. When the British invasion of 1888 undertook their first expedition against us (the Chins) I attained the age of 20 years and I played an active part in the defence against them. When the British troops marched up the Signalling at No. 5 Stockade the united forces of the Sizang, Sukte and Kamhau made a good resistance to the British attack which was easily repulsed. On this occasion I personally captured one rifle. When the second expedition took place in 1889 the British, too well armed to be resisted against, carried the day: hence the annexation of Chin Hills. I then rebuilt and settled in Lophei Village which was founded by Kim Lel and was destroyed by the Tashons in my grandfather, Lua Thuam‚Äôs time. Henceforth my hereditary chieftainship of the Lophei clan was restored to me. Moreover, I founded the three villages-Tuisau, Tuival, and Suangdaw all of which have ever since been in my jurisdiction. As I was advanced in age after my service of 40 years as Chief, my eldest son succeeded me to the chieftainship. Being highly pleased with my meritorious and loyal services, His Honour., the Lieutant-Governor of Burma in 1922 presented me a D.B.B.L [a double barrel hunting] gun as a reward and a good service certificate. And to mention more I was given many good certificates, by the various Administrative Officers of Chin Hills. The Burmese text on the inscription may be translated as follows: The Sizang people who dwell in the villages of Lophei, Khuasak, Buanman, Thuklai, and Lamkhai are the descendants of Suantak/ Thuantak. I belong to the fifteenth generation. The history of my lifetime has been recorded in Chin/Zo and English. The animals drawn on the memorial stone indicate Khup Lian‚Äôs hunting trophies: a tiger, 3 bison, 2 leopards, 3 wild boars, 4 deers and several barking deers. (The number of pictures on the memorial stone are only symbolic and they do not say the amount of the animals being killed by him.

The opponents were, however, largely outnumbered by supporters of the march, despite contradictory reports on Kremlin-financed news websites and other media, and despite the pro-Russian stance of the Czech president, Milo≈° Zeman. However, president Zeman criticised the description of the convoy as \\"occupation forces, because We (Czechs) have experiences with occupations (1938 and 1968) and it looks different.\\"http://liberec.idnes.cz/zeman-nesouhlasi-s-tim-aby-byl-americky- konvoj-oznacovan-za-okupacni-armadu-17c-/liberec- zpravy.aspx?c=A150324_132123_liberec-zpravy_tm According to an article published by Newsweek, the exercise met with a \\"mixed response\\" in the Czech Republic.

John was a proponent of traditional Central Alaskan Yup'ik culture, including the use of the Central Alaskan Yup'ik language and a subsistence lifestyle, including wild food. Additionally, John helped to settle the village of Toksook Bay, Alaska. A traditional chief of the Nunakauyarmiut tribe, he was a member of the Association of Village Council Presidents (AVCP), which is based in Bethel, Alaska. == Early Life == Paul John was born in the village of Old Cevv'arneq, also known as Chefornak, Alaska. He was raised in a sod house in an Alaskan village on the Bering Sea. John, who spoke very little English and conversed in fluent Central Alaskan Yup'ik language, recalled living with seals as a child to promote respect for animals. He later moved to nearby Nightmute, Alaska, to marry his wife, Martina (n√©e Anguyaluk). In 1964, Paul and Martina John moved to Toksook Bay when the village was established. == Contributions and Collaborations == Paul John, who possessed an in-depth knowledge of Yup'ik traditions and language, was featured in a number of books by Ann Fienup- Riordan, an Alaskan cultural anthropologist. John was cited dozens of times in Fienup-Riordan's book, \\"Yuungnaqpiallerput\\" (\\"The Way We Genuinely Live\\"). For example, in \\"Yuungnaqpiallerput\\", John described the qasgi, a traditional men's community house, saying \\"The qasgi was like college, and our elders were like our professors.\\" He was one of the last Yup'ik who was raised with the qasgi men's house as an integral part of the village community. He recalled the qasgi as a place where the community learned \\"how to live and how to work.\\" John also authored several books on Yup'ik history and folkways in his native language, composed Yup'ik songs, and created dances which are still performed. He was also able to describe Yup'ik artifacts to researchers. He was among a group of Yup'ik who travelled to museums as far away as Berlin, New York City, and Washington D.C. to view and identify artifacts from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Additionally, he taught classes and workshops on Yup'ik crafts, dance and language to students. Paul John received an honorary doctorate from the University of Alaska Fairbanks for his promotion of Yup'ik culture. == Leadership and Legacy == Paul John was a commercial fisherman in Bristol Bay by profession. He was among the first village residents to compete in sled dog races in Anchorage and Bethel. He was a member of the Association of Village Council Presidents, the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, and a founding member of the board of directors of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corp. Paul John died at the Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage, Alaska, on March 6, 2015, at the age of 85. His illness, which required hospitalization in Anchorage, had prevented him from making a final visit to Toksook Bay. He was survived by his wife Martina (then aged 62), nine surviving children, thirty grandchildren, and thirty-five great-grandchildren. His memorial service was held at St. Anthony's Catholic Church in Anchorage on March 10, 2015. Dignitaries in attendance included Lt. Governor Byron Mallott.

He progressed through the club's academy and signed a professional contract on 26 February 2014. Raya gained his first senior experience with a four-month spell on loan at Conference Premier club Southport during the first half of the 2014‚Äì15 season and made 24 appearances.

C. Lathrop (1868 ‚Äì 1918) was a rodent fancier who bred fancy mice. ==Biography== Lathrop was born in 1868 in Illinois to schoolteachers. She was homeschooled until she was 16 and earned an Illinois teaching certificate after about two years at an academy. She taught elementary school before moving to a Granby, Massachusetts farm in 1900. After her poultry business failed, she started breeding rats and mice for hobbyists and pet owners. She also raised ferrets, rabbits, and guinea pigs. She was assisted by her friends Edith Chapin and Ada Gray. Lathrop started out with a pair of waltzing mice she obtained in Granby and her farm grew to hold over 11,000 mice at one point. Her breeding records later proved useful for researchers. Lathrop began selling rodents to scientific researchers, including Harvard University's Bussey Institute. The United States government purchased her guinea pigs to test for toxic gas in the trenches of World War I. For the Granby Mouse Farm Lathrop sourced wild mice from Michigan and Vermont. She bred Japanese waltzing mice as well as fancy mice. The mice had straw bedding and lived in wooden boxes. They were fed a diet of oats and crackers. Lathrop reported going through one and a half tons of oats and over 12 barrels of crackers each month. She occasionally paid local children 7 cents an hour to clean the cages. As early as 1908 Lathrop found that unusual skin lesions were developing in some of her mice. She sent samples to scientists and corresponded with experimental pathologist Leo Loeb, who identified the lesions as malignant. Lathrop began developing inbred strains around 1910. Loeb and Lathrop performed experiments at her farm and the pair authored 10 journal articles from 1913 to 1919, including those published in the Journal of Cancer Research and the Journal of Experimental Medicine. They established that ovariectomies reduced the incidence of mammary tumors and that tumor susceptibility varied in different strains of mice. A \\"Black 6\\" mouse Mammalian geneticist William E. Castle purchased some of Lathrop's mice in 1902. He trained C. C. Little who bred C57BL/6J (\\"Black 6\\") from Lathrop's mouse number 57. Black 6 became the most frequently used strain of laboratory mouse. While Little patronizingly called Lathrop a \\"talented pet-shop owner,\\" his own DBA strain was probably derived from her partially inbred silver fawn mice. Karin Knorr Cetina wrote in 2009 that at least five of the primary strains of laboratory mice in use may derive from a single female from Lathrop. Lathrop died of pernicious anemia in 1918. She was interred at West Cemetery in Granby, near her friends Chapin and Gray. Her notebooks, observations, and breeding records are kept in the library of The Jackson Laboratory. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * *The Abbie Lathrop Collection (1907‚Äì1918).

It was created in 2008 in the United Kingdom with the formation of Chameleon Circuit. ==History== The first Doctor Who inspired songs were recorded during the Dalekmania of the mid 1960s. The most famous of these was the novelty song I'm Gonna Spend My Christmas With A Dalek, recorded by Newcastle band The Go-Go's in 1964. Other notable songs of this time included Who is Dr Who by Roberta Tovey,The actress who played Susan Foreman in Dr. Who and the Daleks Frazer Hines'Better known as the Second Doctor's companion Jamie McCrimmon album Time Traveller, and also the Third Doctor Jon Pertwee's hit single I Am the Doctor. In 1988, The KLF released the single \\"Doctorin' the Tardis\\" under the alternative band name The Timelords, which reached number 1 in the UK singles chart as well as charting in other countries. However, the group never released anything else under this name or with the same subject, nor did any other band follow up on the single, leaving it as a novelty rather than a genre. In the summer of 2008, Alex Day, a fan of Doctor Who, was inspired by the growing phenomenon of wizard rock (formed from Harry Potter fandom) to begin writing songs about Doctor Who, dubbing the resulting genre \\"Time Lord Rock\\" (abbreviated to \\"Trock\\", after the \\"Wrock\\" abbreviation used for wizard rock). Archive on SoundCloud. Charlie McDonnell, also a fan, did the same, and released an acoustic video performance of \\"Blink\\" on YouTube. Combined with the Scottish vloggers Liam Dryden and Chris Beattie, they formed the first Time Lord rock band, Chameleon Circuit. Time Lord rock performers are usually British or Australian. Chicago-based Time Crash may be the first American band playing in the genre. In 2013 Legs Nose Robinson became a trock-rocking American band picking up the new genre and broad in range. \\"references to the series, while present, are subtle, with styles ranging from glam-tinged rock to a burlesque reminiscent of Kurt Weill.\\" ==Groups and performers== * Chameleon Circuit * The Doctor's Daughter * Mr. Saxon * Allegra Rosenberg * Time Crash * Turn Left * Legs Nose Robinson ==References== Category:2008 in music Category:Alternative rock genres Category:Doctor Who fandom Category:Geek rock Category:Music based on Doctor Who ","title":"Time Lord rock"},{"id":"46313676","text":"Jean-Julien Rojer and Horia TecƒÉu were the defending champions, but chose not to participate this year.

It is an approach that addresses the complex and non-linear nature of governance. EGT is different from other theoretical approaches in the sense that it recognizes that governance and its elements are constantly changing in interplay with each other. It places emphasis on the co-evolution between discourses, actors and institutions. Therewith it offers a perspective on the way institutions, markets and societies evolve.Van Assche, Kristof, Beunen, Raoul, Duineveld, Martijn (2014) Evolutionary Governance Theory: an introduction. Springer, Heidelberg. Ostrom, E. (2014) Do institutions for collective action evolve?. Journal of Bioeconomics, 16(1), 3-30. It builds on a broad range of theoretical sources that includes Systems theory, Post structuralism, Institutional economics, Actor‚Äìnetwork theory and Development studies. EGT offers a framework for understanding how actors, subjects, objects, formal and informal institutions, and knowledge are in a continuous process of co-evolution, how different dependencies influence the course of evolution, and how different evolutionary pathways are created and influencing each other‚Äôs development. Within EGT social systems theory is compatible with a version of discourse theory, largely in line with the Michel Foucault tradition, while also offering a place for actors and their strategizing.Beunen, R., Van Assche, K., Duineveld, M.

He played regularly for Berkshire throughout the 1920s, and in 1931 he was selected to play in first-class match for a combined Minor Counties cricket team against the touring New Zealanders at Gainsborough. He succeeded his father as the 2nd Baron Remnant in 1933. He made two further first-class appearances for the Minor Counties cricket team in 1934 and 1936, playing twice against Oxford University at the University Parks. In his three first- class appearances he scored a total of 113 runs with a high score of 47, while with the ball he took 5 wickets with best figures of 3/80.

On the line were the brothers Bemus Pierce and Hawley Pierce. The two Pierce brothers, each weighing over 200 pounds, were both among the best players of their day.

When he became a succeedingly vocal critic of his party, he was expelled in 2008. In the 2010 elections, he was however popularly elected Regional governor of Peloponnese, and was reelected in 2014, following a reconciliation with his former party. ==Biography== Born 1953 in a small village in Cynuria, Tatoulis studied medicine at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and worked as a surgeon in hospitals in Arcadia, Athens and Piraeus. MP and Deputy Minister of Culture Following the 1990 legislative election, Petros Tatoulis served for six consecutive terms as a Member of the Hellenic Parliament for the Arcadia constituency. In the first Karamanlis cabinet (2004‚Äì2006), he was Deputy Minister for Culture under Prime minister Kostas Karamanlis who at the same time served as Minister for Culture. He eventually became known as a \\"party rebel\\" though, and fought a number of disputes with his own party. In 2008 he condemned a conflict of interest of Minister of State Theodoros Roussopoulos regarding the role of his wife's job as a journalist and publisher, and asked for one of the two to step down. Prime minister Karamanlis rejected Tatoulis' reproaches: \\"Such views are anachronistic, if not medieval, about the role of women in modern society.\\" He has also been a vocal critic in the affair around Christos Zahopoulos whom he had already distrusted when he was Deputy minister. Following an Ethnos interview in which Tatoulis railed against the government for failing to crack down on corruption, on 10 November he was finally expelled from both Nea Dimokratia's parliamentary faction and the party, but remained an independent MP until 2009. Regional governor of Peloponnese In the 2010 regional election, Tatoulis ran on an independent ticket for the governorship of the Peloponnese region. Supported by an unusual duet of social democratic PASOK and right-wing LAOS party, he defeated Nea Dimokratia's candidate Dimitrios Drakos in the second round winning 52.53% of the popular vote. He eventually reconciled with his former party so it subsequently supported him in the 2014 regional election when he was reelected defeating SYRIZA's candidate Odysseas Boudouris in the second round winning 59.35% of the electoral vote. ==References * Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:National and Kapodistrian University of Athens alumni Category:Greek surgeons Category:New Democracy (Greece) politicians Category:Greek MPs 1990‚Äì1993 Category:Greek MPs 1993‚Äì1996 Category:Greek MPs 1996‚Äì2000 Category:Greek MPs 2000‚Äì2004 Category:Greek MPs 2004‚Äì2007 Category:Greek MPs 2007‚Äì2009 Category:Regional governors of Greece Category:20th-century Greek physicians Category:21st-century Greek physicians Category:People from North Kynouria Category:20th-century surgeons ","title":"Petros Tatoulis"},{"id":"46313839","text":"Windows Server 2016 is the seventh release of the Windows Server server operating system developed by Microsoft as part of the Windows NT family of operating systems. It was developed concurrently with Windows 10 and is the successor to Windows Server 2012 R2. The first early preview version (Technical Preview) became available on October 1, 2014 together with the first technical preview of System Center. Windows Server 2016 was released on September 26, 2016 at Microsoft's Ignite conference and broadly released for retail sale on October 12, 2016. It has two successors: Windows Server 2019, and the Windows Server Semi-Annual Channel, which excludes the graphical user interface and many older components. == Features == Windows Server 2016 has a variety of new features, including * Active Directory Federation Services: It is possible to configure AD FS to authenticate users stored in non-AD directories, such as X.500 compliant Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directories and SQL databases. * Windows Defender: Windows Server Antimalware is installed and enabled by default without the GUI, which is an installable Windows feature. * Remote Desktop Services: Support for OpenGL 4.4 and OpenCL 1.1, performance and stability improvements; MultiPoint Services role (see Windows MultiPoint Server) * Storage Services: Central Storage QoS Policies; Storage Replicas (storage-agnostic, block-level, volume-based, synchronous and asynchronous replication using SMB3 between servers for disaster recovery). Storage Replica replicates blocks instead of files; files can be in use. It's not multi-master, not one-to-many and not transitive. It periodically replicates snapshots, and the replication direction can be changed. * Failover Clustering: Cluster operating system rolling upgrade, Storage Replicas * Web Application Proxy: Preauthentication for HTTP Basic application publishing, wildcard domain publishing of applications, HTTP to HTTPS redirection, Propagation of client IP address to backend applications * IIS 10: Support for HTTP/2 * Windows PowerShell 5.1 * Windows Server Containers Networking features * DHCP: As Network Access Protection was deprecated in Windows Server 2012 R2, in Windows Server 2016 the DHCP role no longer supports NAP * DNS: ** DNS client: Service binding ‚Äì enhanced support for computers with more than one network interface ** DNS Server: DNS policies, new DDS record types (TLSA, SPF, and unknown records), new PowerShell cmdlets and parameters * Windows Server Gateway now supports Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnels * IP address management (IPAM): Support for /31, /32, and /128 subnets; discovery of file-based, domain-joined DNS servers; new DNS functions; better integration of DNS, DHCP, and IP Address (DDI) Management * Network Controller: A new server role to configure, manage, monitor, and troubleshoot virtual and physical network devices and services in the datacentre * Hyper-V Network virtualization: Programmable Hyper-V switch (a new building block of Microsoft's software-defined networking solution); VXLAN encapsulation support; Microsoft Software Load Balancer interoperability; better IEEE Ethernet standard compliance. Hyper-V * Rolling Hyper-V cluster update: Unlike upgrading clusters from Windows 2008 R2 to 2012 level, Windows Server 2016 cluster nodes can be added to a Hyper-V Cluster with nodes running Windows Server 2012 R2. The cluster continues to function at a Windows Server 2012 R2 feature level until all of the nodes in the cluster have been upgraded and the cluster functional level has been upgraded. * Storage quality of service (QoS) to centrally monitor end-to-end storage performance and create policies using Hyper-V and Scale-Out File Servers * New, more efficient binary virtual machine configuration format (.VMCX extension for virtual machine configuration data and the .VMRS extension for runtime state data) * Production checkpoints * Hyper-V Manager: Alternate credentials support, down-level management, WS-Management protocol * Integration services for Windows guests distributed through Windows Update * Hot add and remove for network adapters (for generation 2 virtual machines) and memory (for generation 1 and generation 2 virtual machines) * Linux secure boot * Connected Standby compatibility * Storage Resiliency feature of Hyper-V is formed for detecting transitory loss of connectivity to VM storage. VMs will be paused until connectivity is re-established. *RDMA compatible Virtual Switch Nano Server Microsoft announced a new installation option, Nano Server, which offers a minimal-footprint headless version of Windows Server. It excludes the graphical user interface, WoW64 (support for 32-bit software) and Windows Installer. It does not support console login, either locally or via Remote Desktop Connection. All management is performed remotely via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), Windows PowerShell and Remote Server Management Tools (a collection of web-based GUI and command line tools). However, in Technical Preview 5, Microsoft has re-added the ability to administer Nano Server locally through PowerShell. According to Microsoft engineer Jeffrey Snover, Nano Server has 93% lower VHD size, 92% fewer critical security advisories, and 80% fewer reboots than Windows Server. Nano Server is only available to Microsoft Software Assurance customers and on cloud computing platforms such as Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. Starting with the new feature release of Windows Server version 1709, Nano Server can only be installed inside a container host. ==Development== Microsoft has been reorganized by Satya Nadella, putting the Server and System Center teams together. Previously, the Server team was more closely aligned with the Windows client team. The Azure team is also working closely with the Server team. In March 2017, Microsoft demonstrated an internal version of Server 2016 running on the ARMv8-A architecture. It was reported that Microsoft was working with Qualcomm Centriq and Cavium ThunderX2 chips. According to James Vincent of The Verge, this decision endangers Intel's dominance of the server CPU market. However, later inquiry from Microsoft revealed that this version of Windows Server is only for internal use and only impacts subscribers of Microsoft Azure service. Preview releases A public beta version of Windows Server 2016 (then still called vNext) branded as \\"Windows Server Technical Preview\\" was released on October 1, 2014; the technical preview builds are aimed toward enterprise users. The first Technical Preview was first set to expire on April 15, 2015 but Microsoft later released a tool to extend the expiry date, to last until the second tech preview of the OS in May 2015. The second beta version, \\"Technical Preview 2\\", was released on May 4, 2015. Third preview version, \\"Technical Preview 3\\" was released on August 19, 2015. \\"Technical Preview 4\\" was released on November 19, 2015. \\"Technical Preview 5\\" was released on April 27, 2016. Windows Server 2016 Insider Preview Build 16237 was released to Windows Insiders on July 13, 2017.  Public release  Windows Server 2016 was officially released at Microsoft's Ignite Conference on September 26, 2016. Unlike its predecessor, Windows Server 2016 is licensed by the number of CPU cores rather than number of CPU sockets‚Äîa change that has similarly been adopted by BizTalk Server 2013 and SQL Server 2014. The new licensing structure that has been adopted by Windows Server 2016 has also moved away from the Windows Server 2012/2012R2 CPU socket licensing model in that now the amount of cores covered under one license is limited. Windows Server 2016 Standard and Datacenter core licensing now covers a minimum of 8 core licenses for each physical processor and a minimum of 16 core licenses for each server. Core licenses are sold in packs of two with Standard Edition providing the familiar rights to run 2 virtualized OS environments. If the server goes over 16 core licenses for a 2 processor server additional licenses will now be required with Windows Server 2016. ==Version history== Technical Preview Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview, released on October 1, 2014, was the first beta version of the operating system made publicly available. Its version number was 6.4.9841. Technical Preview 2 Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 2 was made available on May 4, 2015. Its version number was 10.0.10074. (A similar jump in the most significant part of the version number from 6 to 10 is seen in Windows 10.) Highlights of this version include: * Nano Server installation option * Hyper-V: hot add and remove memory and NIC; resilient virtual machines to keep running even when their cluster fabric fails * Rolling upgrades for Hyper-V and Storage clusters * Networking: Converged NIC across tenant and RDMA traffic; PacketDirect on 40G * Storage: Virtual Machine Storage Path resiliency; Storage Spaces Direct to aggregate Storage Spaces across multiple servers; Storage Replica * Security: Host Guardian Service, helping to keep trust and isolation boundary between the cloud infrastructure and guest OS layers; Just Enough Administration, restricting users to perform only specific tasks * Management: PowerShell Desired State Configuration; PowerShell Package Manager; Windows Management Framework 5.0 April Preview and DSC Resource Kit * Other: Conditional access control in AD FS; application authentication support for OpenID Connect and OAuth; full OpenGL support with RDS for VDI; Server-side support for HTTP/2, including header compression, connection multiplexing and server push * Installation options: Minimal Server Interface was made default and renamed the Server installation option to ‚ÄúServer with local admin tools‚Äù. Technical Preview 3 The third technical preview of Windows Server 2016 was made available on August 19, 2015. Its version number was 10.0.10514. Highlights of this version include: * Windows Server Containers * Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS): authentication of users stored in Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directories * Installation options: The Server installation option had been renamed to ‚ÄúServer with Desktop Experience‚Äù having the shell and Desktop Experience installed by default. Due to the structural changes required to deliver the Desktop Experience on Server, it is no longer possible to convert from Server with Desktop Experience to Server Core or to convert Server Core up to Server with Desktop Experience. Technical Preview 4 The fourth technical preview of the operating system was made available on November 19, 2015, one year and one month after the initial technical preview. Its version number was 10.0.10586. Its highlights include: * Nano Server supports the DNS Server and IIS server roles, as well as MPIO, VMM, SCOM, DSC push mode, DCB, Windows Server Installer, and the WMI provider for Windows Update. Its Recovery Console supports editing and repairing the network configuration. A Windows PowerShell module is now available to simplify building Nano Server images. * Hyper-V Containers encapsulates each container in a light weight virtual machine. Technical Preview 5 The last technical preview of Windows Server 2016 was made available on April 27, 2016. Its version number was 10.0.14300. Its highlights include: * Mostly general refinements. Greater time accuracy in both physical and virtual machines * Container support adds performance improvements, simplified network management, and support for Windows containers on Windows 10 * Nano Server: an updated module for building Nano Server images, including more separation of physical host and guest virtual machine functionality as well as support for different Windows Server editions. Improvements to the Recovery Console, including separation of inbound and outbound firewall rules as well as the ability to repair configuration of WinRM * Networking: traffic to new or existing virtual appliances can now be both mirrored and routed. With a distributed firewall and Network security groups, this enables dynamically segmented and secure workloads in a manner similar to Azure. One can deploy and manage the entire Software-defined networking (SDN) stack using System Center Virtual Machine Manager. Docker can be used to manage Windows Server container networking, and associate SDN policies not only with virtual machines but containers as well * Remote Desktop Services: a highly available RDS deployment can leverage Azure SQL Database for the RD Connection Brokers in high availability mode * Management: ability to run PowerShell.exe locally on Nano Server (no longer remote only), new Local Users & Groups cmdlets to replace the GUI, added PowerShell debugging support, and added support in Nano Server for security logging & transcription and JEA (Just Enough Administration) * Shielded Virtual Machines: ** New \\"Encryption Supported\\" mode that offers more protections than for an ordinary virtual machine, but less than \\"Shielded\\" mode, while still supporting vTPM, disk encryption, Live Migration traffic encryption, and other features, including direct fabric administration conveniences such as virtual machine console connections and Powershell Direct ** Full support for converting existing non-shielded Generation 2 virtual machines to shielded virtual machines, including automated disk encryption ** Shielded virtual machines are compatible with Hyper-V Replica Release to manufacturing Windows Server 2016 was released to manufacturing on September 26, 2016, bearing the version number of 10.0.14393 (same as Windows 10 Anniversary Update). Microsoft added the following final touches: * Available for a 180-day evaluation * Fixed Start menu corruptions * Improved user experience and performance * Windows Store apps have been removed * Login screen now has a background * The Windows Hello feature has been added * Dark theme has been added ==Semi-Annual Channel releases== Version 1709 Windows Server, version 1709 (version shared with Windows 10 Fall Creators Update) was released on October 17, 2017. The release has dropped the Windows Server 2016 name and is just called Windows Server by Microsoft. It is offered to the Microsoft Software Assurance customers who have an active Windows Server 2016 license and has the same system requirements. This is the first Windows Server product to fall under the \\"Semi-Annual Channel\\" (SAC) release cadence. This product only features the Server Core and the Nano Server modes. Of the two, only the Server Core mode of the OS can be installed on a bare system. The Nano Server mode is only available as an operating system container. Version 1803 Windows Server, version 1803 (version shared with Windows 10 April 2018 Update) is the second Semi-Annual Channel release of Windows Server. It is also the final version to be branched off the Server 2016 codebase, as the next release shares the version number 1809 with Windows Server 2019. == See also == * Microsoft Servers * Comparison of Microsoft Windows versions * History of Microsoft Windows * Comparison of operating systems * List of operating systems == References  * PluralSight: Windows Server vNext First Look ‚Äì An introduction to the new features of the Windows Server vNext operating system * Our Server Journey ‚Äì video session describing the path that Windows Server has taken from its creation to the current day and where it is going from here * Michael Pietroforte: Nano Server ‚Äì Goodbye Windows Server? * Microsoft Windows Nano Server, the future of Windows Server?

The company was active under various ownerships in building steam locomotives from 1882 until 1911. The New York Locomotive Works should not be confused with the earlier Breese, Kneeland, and Company which traded under the same name in the 1850s. The company was organized in 1881 with T.

The company was an instant success, as railroads were expanding a feverish pace. NYLW offered a robust, no frills locomotive and was well connected with banking interests that allowed sales along the \\"Car Trust Plan\\" with payments out to ten years. ==Reorganizations== Business collapsed suddenly after the death of President Noch in 1890 and the financial panic of the early 1890s dried up new orders. The company shut down in June 1891 and was reorganized as the Rome Locomotive and Machine Company. The new company announced its focus would be rebuilding steam machinery and general shop work. Some compressed air locomotives were constructed by the new company but only two new steam locomotives were built after the reorganization, the last in 1911.

Rome Manufacturing built trolley cars, French designed automobiles and a line of heavy construction equipment including road graders and continued rebuilding steam locomotives into the 1920s. ==Production== Rome built 695 steam locomotives in a decade, a significant number in a highly competitive field, the seventeenth largest total among 19th century North American locomotive builders.

The 2011 Swale Borough Council election took place on 5 May 2011 to elect members of Swale Borough Council in Kent, England. The whole council was up for election and the Conservative party stayed in overall control of the council. ==Background== For the 2011 election Swale switched to having the whole council elected every four years, from the previous system where a third of the seats were elected each year, followed by one year without an election. The decision was taken by the council in March 2010, after a consultation produced 162 responses in favour of the change and 136 responses against changing. As a result, all 47 seats on the council were contested with over 120 candidates standing at election. ==Election result== The Conservatives remained in control of the council with 32 of the 47 seats, after a net loss of 1 seat. Labour increased to 13 councillors, the Liberal Democrats were reduced to 1 seat and the only independent councillor retained her seat. Labour's Mark Ellen regained a seat in Sheerness East that he had lost at the 2010 election, while in Milton Regis Labour defeated the leader of the Liberal Democrat group Elvie Lowe who had represented the ward for 24 years. However the Conservatives took a seat from Labour in St Michaels ward, where the Conservative deputy mayoress Sylvia Bennett gained a seat on the council. In West Downs the only independent councillor, Monique Bonney, held her seat defeating Conservative county councillor Mike Whiting by 41 votes. Meanwhile, the closest result came in Murston where both the Conservative and Liberal Democrat councillors, Ed Gent and Dave Banks, took 420 votes after six recounts. Conservative Ed Gent took the seat after his name was pulled out of a hat and he was therefore given one extra vote. This meant Mike Henderson was the only Liberal Democrat to be elected after he held his seat in Davington Priory. Following the election Roger Truelove became the new leader of the Labour group, replacing the leader for the previous 15 years Angela Harrison. The only Liberal Democrat councillor, Mike Henderson, meanwhile joined with the independent councillor Monique Bonney in the independent group on the council to ensure they both got positions on council committees. ==Ward resultsBy-elections between 2011 and 2015== Kemsley A by-election was held in Kemsley on 8 March 2012 after the death of Conservative councillor Brenda Simpson. The seat was held for the Conservatives by Mike Whiting with a majority of 72 votes over Labour candidate Richard Raycraft. Sheppey Central A by-election was held in Sheppey Central on 16 October 2014 following the death of Conservative councillor John Morris. The seat was gained for the UK Independence Party by David Jones with a majority of 507 votes over Conservative Tina Booth. David Jones became the second UK Independence Party councillor on Swale council after the defection of Adrian Crowther from the Conservatives in 2013. ==References== 2011 Category:2011 English local elections Category:2010s in Kent ","title":"2011 Swale Borough Council election"},{"id":"46313989","text":"Malka Marom is a Canadian writer, journalist, radio broadcaster, folksinger and dancer.

An octagonal keep was built on the motte in the early 13th century at roughly the same time that the towers and gatehouse were added. It was here that in 1349 King Edward III bent down and assisted the \\"Countess of Salisbury\\" (either Edward's future daughter-in- law Joan of Kent or her former mother-in-law, Catherine Montagu, Countess of Salisbury) with her garter and, in honour of that moment, subsequently founded the Order of the Garter. Thomas Dacre described the newly refurbished castle in June 1518 after work directed by the Master Mason of Berwick. The donjon or keep was finished, and fit to mount great cannon on each vaulted floor. Cannon could be hoisted up the donjon through an internal well. The watchman on top could see Norham and the outskirts of Berwick. There were three wards or courtyards, almost complete.J. S.

In September 1523 the Earl of Surrey, William Frankelyn, Chancellor of Durham, and Sir William Bulmer, Sheriff of Durham viewed the defences at Wark and Norham Castle. Surrey gave orders for new bulworks and earthwork defences at Wark. He thought the inner ward could withstand a 10 day siege, but the outer ward could only be held for 2 days. He thought the keep at Wark was as strong as any he had seen, and stronger than the keep at Gu√Ænes.State Papers Henry VIII, vol. IV part IV (London, 1836), 37.

It was the largest sh≈çen of medieval Japan. The Shimazu clan took its name from this estate as the clan succeeded the position of jit≈ç (land steward). ==History== Heian Period No contemporary source recorded the foundation of the Shimazu Estate. According to a document dated circa 1291, a \\"wasteland belonging to no one\\" was developed during the Manju era (1024‚Äì1028) and was donated to Kampaku (de facto ruler of Japan) Fujiwara no Yorimichi to break free from the provincial government's control. Another document states that its founder was Taira no Suemoto, the Dazai Daigen (high-ranking official of the administrative center of Ky≈´sh≈´). It is likely that Taira no Suemoto was the founder of the Chinzei Heishi, a branch line of the Taira clan in Kyushu. A notable member of the Chinzei Heishi was Ata Tadakage. The Shimazu Estate originally covered Shimazu, Morokata District of southern Hy≈´ga Province (modern-day Miyakonoj≈ç, Miyazaki Prefecture) but was soon expanded into the neighboring lands of the province. Under the patronage of the powerful Fujiwara clan, Taira no Suemoto exercised effective administrative control over the lands. In 1029, Taira no Suemoto even raided the government office of the neighboring ≈åsumi Province but a fragmentary sources suggest that he was not punished severely. The Shimazu Estate was expanded substantially in the first half of the 12th century. Large portions of Satsuma, ≈åsumi (including the island of Tanegashima) and southern Hy≈´ga became part of the estate, either as ichien no sh≈ç (estate under complete control) or yose g≈çri (where tax revenue was shared with the provincial government). The Shimazu Estate was inherited by the Fujiwara family, but came under the control of the Taira clan in the second half of the 12th century. Yorimichi's 6th generation descendant, Kampaku Fujiwara no Motozane, was married to Taira no Moriko, a daughter of Taira no Kiyomori. After Motozane died in 1166, his widow Moriko managed the property of the Fujiwara clan. After Moriko's death in 1179, the estate was inherited by the Konoe branch family of the Fujiwara clan. Kamakura Period With the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate, supporters of the Taira clan were replaced by the sh≈çgun's retainers. In 1185, Koremune no Tadahisa was appointed as jit≈ç of the Shimazu Estate. Although he was originally a retainer of the Konoe family, he moved in an inner circle of the shogunate for his kinship ties with the first sh≈çgun Minamoto no Yoritomo and his powerful retainer Hiki Yoshikazu. He was also appointed as the military governor of Satsuma, ≈åsumi and Hy≈´ga Provinces. Thereafter he claimed the clan name of Shimazu, which indicated the ownership of the estate. By the time Tadahisa took the position of jit≈ç, the Shimazu Estate occupied 70% of agricultural fields of Satsuma Province although over 70% of the lands were yose g≈çri and were not under the estate's full control. A small portion of the Shimazu Estate in Satsuma was controlled by the Chiba clan. In Satsuma, the provincial government was fused with the Shimazu Estate, as a large overlap in membership between the two polities is observed. The Shimazu Estate's area of influence was smaller in ≈åsumi Province, being just over half, and the largest part of the remaining portion was controlled by ≈åsumi Sh≈ç-Hachimang≈´. However, it had a stronger control over the land, as over half of the lands were ichien no sh≈ç. The provincial government and the estate remained largely separate entities. In 1203, Shimazu Tadahisa was ousted from his positions as a jit≈ç of the estate and the military governor of the three provinces because his relative Hiki Yoshikazu was annihilated by the H≈çj≈ç clan. He managed to regain the posts of the jit≈ç of the Shimazu Estate in Satsuma (1213) and the military governor of Satsuma Province (1205). However, the jit≈ç of the estate in ≈åsumi and the military governor of ≈åsumi Province were succeeded by the H≈çj≈ç clan. The Nagoe branch family of the H≈çj≈ç clan maintained the post of jit≈ç in ≈åsumi until the end of the Kamakura period. They sent the Higo clan to ≈åsumi as deputy rulers. After the H≈çj≈ç clan was annihilated, one line of the Higo clan made itself autonomous in Tanegashima and began to claim the clan name of Tanegashima. The post of the military governor of ≈åsumi Province was transferred from the Nagoe family to the Chiba clan in the early 1280s and then to the Kanesawa branch family of the H≈çj≈ç clan in the early 1290s. Because the Nagoe family kept the position of the jit≈ç of the estate in ≈åsumi, the military governor had to devote much effort to consolidate power. In fact, Kanesawa Tokinao actively incorporated the officials of the military government as his retainers and relabeled their lands as the \\"private territories of the military governor\\" (ÂÆàË≠∑ÁßÅÈ†ò). Even in Satsuma Province, the Shimazu clan's rule was not stable. As a result of the J≈çky≈´ War, Satsuma's Kawanabe District came under the control of the Tokus≈ç (mainline) family of the H≈çj≈ç clan. H≈çj≈ç's retainer, the Chikama clan, served as the district governor and deputy jit≈ç of Kawanabe District.  Afterwards  During the downfall of the Kamakura shogunate, Shimazu Sadahisa successfully sided with Ashikaga Takauji. In reward for his service, the Shimazu clan won back the jit≈ç of the Shimazu Estate in ≈åsumi and the military governor of ≈åsumi and Hy≈´ga Provinces. Because the military government and the estate in ≈åsumi remained distinct entities, the Shimazu clan had much trouble regaining control over the province. ==Notes *The Documents of Iriki: The documents of the Irikiin clan published and translated by Kan'ichi Asakawa.

It originally aired on April 1, 2015. The episode was written by Paul Corrigan & Brad Walsh & Jeffrey Richman, and directed by James Bagdonas. In the episode, Alex gets accepted at Caltech but is acting weird, making Claire believe that she hasn't praised her enough. The family gathers at Jay's for his birthday, where Phil tries desperately to impress Jay with his gift. Gloria tries to give Manny and Luke a lesson for sneaking booze. Mitchell and Claire decide to give Jay back the money he loaned them a long time ago to help them with their houses, without telling Phil nor Cameron. Andy wants to talk to Haley about his feeling but her coming at Jay's with her new boyfriend makes things a little difficult for him. \\"Grill, Interrupted\\" received positive reviews from the critics. ==Plot== Gathering at Jay's (Ed O'Neill) house for his birthday, Claire (Julie Bowen) and Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) decide to pay their father back the money he loaned them for the down payment on their respective houses. Mitchell intends on using the money that Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) has received from a recently deceased distant relative, and Phil (Ty Burrell) starts to believe the money problems are what have caused the slight rift between himself and Jay. After Phil's present (a new, state-of-the-art barbecue grill) backfires, he, Claire, Mitchell and Cameron all begin arguing in the driveway about the various monetary issues that have surfaced that day. Luke (Nolan Gould) and Manny (Rico Rodriguez) come up with a plan to steal and drink a bottle of Gloria's (Sofia Vergara) tequila. Before they can take it, she swaps it out with water so she can teach them a lesson, leaving Luke and Manny suffering a placebo intoxication. When they are \\"drunk\\" enough, Gloria makes them believe that the bottle of tequila had a deadly worm inside it that was probably got drunk by them. The only way to kill the worm once you had drunk it, is by taking an ice cold bath, something that Luke and Manny rush to do. Gloria appears and takes a photo of the boys being in the tub together, threatening them to post it online if they attempt to steal from her or get drunk underage again. Meanwhile, Andy (Adam Devine) wants to talk to Haley (Sarah Hyland) about his feelings, since it is the first time he will see her after the events of \\"Closet? You'll Love It!\\", where Haley told him that he has a shot with her while she thought he was sleeping. Andy is nervous and Haley appearing with her new boyfriend Will (Nick Ballard) does not help the situation. A series of mishaps leaves Andy and Haley in bed together and, later, Haley removing her clothes due to a drink spillage, but Will does not suspect Andy, nor feeling threatened by him. When Haley leaves the room, Will asks Andy to help him come up with a message for a card for Haley, but once Will leaves Haley struggles to read the handwriting. She asks Andy to read it to her and gets frustrated about how clingy Will is already after only two weeks of dating. Haley kisses Andy on the cheek and heads downstairs, leaving him both disappointed and hopeful. Alex (Ariel Winter) finds out she has been accepted into Caltech, but she is acting strange after her parents' reaction. Claire blames herself for never praising Alex's achievements because she expects them from her, and begins to overtly praise Alex in front of the whole family, leaving Alex embarrassed and irritated. Jay later finds her with a bottle of tequila, the placebo bottle that Gloria swapped out earlier with water, in his new car in the garage. When confronted, Jay explains the bottle of water in the tequila bottle, commenting that drinking will not help her with her problems. Alex expresses worry about being the least intelligent person at her new College and talks about how scared she is. Jay reassures her that she will do great at College and drives her out of the garage into the yard in front of the bickering family. He tells her that the family needs a leader and one day he will not be around to do it anymore, implying that in the future she will be the one to keep the family in check because she is the only one who can do it. ==Reception== Ratings In its original American broadcast, \\"Grill, Interrupted\\" was watched by 9.43; up by 0.72 from the previous episode. Reviews \\"Grill, Interrupted\\" received positive reviews from the critics. David Kallison of The A.V. Club awarded the episode with a B+, saying that \\"Modern Family has no business being as good as it is. [The show] is on a tear of superb episodes lately, starting with the anti-Luddite ode, 'Connection Lost'. What makes this family different from others is the depth and heart the characters possess.

Kallison further went on to praise the season as a whole, saying \\"This season proves that sitcoms can survive on solid characters and solid jokes. \\"Grill, Interrupted\\" lives up to those expectations perfectly\\". Ashley Bissette Sumerel of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.2/5, saying that this was the kind of episode she liked to see. Sumerel further went on to label the episode \\"intricate and fun\\", and also praised Luke, Manny and Gloria's subplot, by saying \\"In reality, this is a serious topic, and it's nice to see it being dealt with\\". She closed her review by stating \\"Overall, this is a really enjoyable, funny installment. It tries to do a LOT, but that's part of what makes Modern Family, well... Modern Family\\".

Fernandes summarizes her review by stating \\"Some good moments, the Jay/Alex pep talk and most of the Haley/Andy storyline salvage the episode\\".

It is both a cookery book and a history of English cuisine. It was acclaimed on publication; the contemporary critic Harold Nicolson described the book as a classic. It has remained in print ever since. The book provides what has been called an idiosyncratic and a combative take on the history of English cooking. The book is unusual as a history in not citing its sources, serving more as an oral social history from Hartley's own experiences as she travelled England as a journalist for the Daily Sketch, interviewing \\"the last generation to have had countryside lives sharing something in common with the Tudors.\\" The book strikes some readers as principally a history, but it consists mainly of recipes. Some of these such as stargazey pie are old- fashioned, but all are practical recipes that can be cooked. ==Context== Dorothy Hartley's mother was from Froncysylltau, near Llangollen in North Wales, where the family owned quarries and property. In 1933 Hartley moved to a house in Froncysylltau, where she lived for the rest of her life.Wondrausch, Mary, \\"Hartley, Dorothy Rosaman (1893‚Äì1985)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 It was there that she began work on the book for which she is best known, Food in England, leading to its publication in 1954. ==Book== Approach Most of the chapters address aspects of English food, whether types of food such as meat, eggs, fungi, and bread, or ways of dealing with food such as salting, drying and preserving. Some chapters such as 'Elizabethan households' are explicitly historical. Every chapter, however, is also a history. For example, chapter V, Meat, discusses \\"a rather interesting mediaeval miracle\\" and illustrates a traditional \\"Colonial Travelling Meat Safe of Mosquito Net\\".Hartley, pp. 61‚Äì62 The text switches repeatedly from instructions (\\"To prepare mutton fat for a mutton piecrust, melt it over a bowl of hot water\\") to historical asides (\\"Mutton fat was used in the mountain-sheep districts for the same purposes as suet or goose-grease in the valleys\\").Hartley, p. 64 Many of the processes are distinctly old-fashioned; thus, Hartley describes basting, dredging, and frothing, switching between the past and present tenses: \\"Dredging. This was done between bastings. Thus you dredge with powders or spices to give flavour, or with acid juices, or chopped herbs, which the pouring fat washes down into the crevices of the roasting meat.\\"Hartley, p. 65 A substantial part of the text consists of recipes. In the Meat chapter, these begin with recipes for beef, including \\"Baron of Beef\\", \\"Sirloin (Norman-French, sur loin)\\", \\"Rib of Beef\\", \\"Boiled Beef with Carrots\\", and \\"Oat Pudding, for Boiled Beef\\".Hartley, pp. 71‚Äì75 Each recipe has a heading in italics; some have an illustration, drawn by Hartley, or else a quotation or proverb. There is no list of ingredients. The first paragraph often describes the dish or its ingredients. Thus for sirloin, she advises \\"This is the best beef joint and should be roasted. Never have the undercut taken out...\\". The instructions are given in a few paragraphs: \\"Let the sirloin be well hung; dust it lightly with dry mustard, pepper and brown flour to give a crisp crust; bed the fat end well under the lean undercut, and secure in place with string or carefully placed skewer. Roast carefully, basting frequently.\\"Hartley, p. 73 Where quantities or cooking temperatures have to be specified, these are included in the instructions; otherwise, matters are left to the cook's discretion. Thus in \\"Spice Sauce (sauce for fish or flesh)\\", Hartley directs \\"Take a quart of sharp cider, .... some mace, a few cloves, some lemon peel, horse-radish root sliced, some sweet herbs, 6 schaloys [shallots], 8 anchovies, 3 spoonfulls of shred red peppers...\\"Hartley, p. 95 For baking, where exact instructions are needed, these are given in Imperial units, but the oven temperature and timing are again left mainly to the cook's experience. Thus for \\"Bath Buns\\", she instructs: \\"Make a light dough with 1/2 lb. of flour, 1/4 lb. of butter or lard, 1 oz. of castor sugar, 2 eggs, 1/2 pint of lukewarm milk, and about 1.2 oz. of yeast. Rub butter into flour; blend ... Set it to rise in a warm place, ... bake lightly and thoroughly till golden brown.\\"Hartley, p. 511 Contents Food in England has 27 chapters: * I Introduction * II Some English Kitchens * III Basic English * IV Fuels and Fireplaces * V Meat * VI Poultry and Game * VII Eggs * VIII Mediaeval feast and famine * IX Trade, Magic and Religious Cooking * X Fish * XI Seaweeds * XII Fungi * XIII Elizabethan households * XIV The New World and the Sailors' Cook * XV Salting, drying and preserving * XVI The House and Garden in 1600 * XVII Vegetables * XVIII New Freedom * XIX Coaching Days * XX Fruits, Herbs, Seeds and Flowers * XXI The Hafod * XXII Dairy produce * XXIII Bread * XXIV Drinks * XXV The Industrial Revolution * XXVI Pies, Puddings, Pastries, Cakes * XXVII Sundry household matters There is a bibliography and an index.

The Manchester Guardian called it \\"fascinating‚Ä¶unusually readable\\";The Manchester Guardian, 145 May 1954, p. 5 Harold Nicolson in The Observer said, \\"it will become a classic\\", though he made gentle fun of the combative Englishness of Hartley's culinary pronouncements.Nicolson, Harold, \\"English Fare\\", The Observer, 22 August 1954, p. 7 Modern The Sunday Times, reviewing the seventh edition of the book, wrote \\"For food scholarship at its best see Dorothy Hartley's robust, idiosyncratic, irresistible Food in England... As packed with diverse and fascinating information as a Scotch bun with fruit, this untidy bundle of erudition is held together by the writer's huge enjoyment of her subject, her immense curiosity about everything to do with the growth, preparation, preservation and eating of food in this country since the Middle Ages.\\"Quoted at \\"Dorothy Hartley\\"' Gale Literary Databases: Contemporary Authors, accessed 31 January 2010 (subscription required) The cultural historian Panikos Panayi describes the book as a tour de force, seminal, and richly illustrated; and he notes that Food in England is partly a recipe book, partly a history. He contrasts it favourably with Philip Harben's Traditional Dishes of Britain, published a year earlier, which he criticises as accepting the \\"stereotypical stalwarts of British food\\", whereas Hartley rightly accepts (Panayi quotes) that \\"foreign dishes ... like the foreigners, become 'naturalised English'\\". The historian of food Bee Wilson, rereading \\"this endearing work\\" 58 years on for The Guardian, wrote that she had remembered it as a history book and an epic account of English cooking, \\"interspersed with recipes.\\" She was therefore \\"startled\\" to find that almost the whole of the text is \\"taken up with practical recipes and techniques, with very little historical narrative.\\" Wilson finds the book as Hartley explicitly intended, an untidy kitchen, \\"a warm friendly place\\". For Hartley, writes Wilson, \\"the past is not a foreign country\\", but ever-present. She notes that Hartley \\"announces dogmatically\\" that English cooking is old-fashioned \\"because we like it that way.\\" Wilson finds \\"Hartley's devotion to archaic recipes such as stargazey pie and posset ... mildly crazed.\\" But whether mad or not, Hartley \\"approaches the cuisine of the past with the humour and sharpness of a journalist.\\" The Historic Royal Palaces curator Lucy Worsley presented a BBC film, 'Food in England', The Lost World of Dorothy Hartley, on 6 November 2015. Worsley, writing in The Telegraph, calls Food in England \\"the definitive history of the way the English eat.\\" She describes the book as \\"laden with odd facts and folklore ... a curious mixture of cookery, history, anthropology and even magic, ... with her own strong and lively illustrations.\\" She admits it is not a conventional history, since Hartley breaks \\"the first rule of the historian: to cite her evidence. She wasn't fond of footnotes.\\" In a year of filming Hartley's places and people she knew, Worsley discovered that \\"my frustration with her technique as historian was misplaced.\\" Hartley had travelled continually to gather materials for her weekly Daily Sketch column, sometimes sleeping rough \\"in a hedge.\\" The work is thus effectively, Worsley argues, an oral history, as Hartley interviewed \\"the last generation to have had countryside lives sharing something in common with the Tudors.\\" The emphasis on local, seasonal food chimes well, Worsley suggests, with the modern trend for just those things. The Museum of English Rural Life at the University of Reading curates the Dorothy Hartley collection. It cites the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography's entry on Hartley, (subscription required) calling Food in England \\"Arguably her best work, and the one for which she will be remembered\\". It calls the book \\"as full of magic and potions as any medieval herbal.\\" ==NotesReferences== Category:1954 non-fiction books Category:History books Category:Cookbooks ","title":"Food in England"},{"id":"46314441","text":"Chen Wei (; born October 1966) is a former Chinese politician who spent most of his career in East China's Shandong province.

The names reflect the cab width in centimetres, at respectively. DAF's first tilting cab design, all in steel, it also benefitted from a new diesel inline-six. After a thorough facelift with a new front clip in the style of the larger F241 series, the cab was renamed the F220 in 1976. The range was originally sold as the F1600 or F2000, with the new model F220 marketed as the F2300. Gradually, a number of other iterations appeared, with the range eventually stretching from the 1700 to the intercooled 2700 ATi. ==History== F218 Introduced in early 1970, the DAF F1600 and F2000 were all-new and tilted for ease of access. The cab used standard pressings and was designed so as to easily allow for a large number of variations to be developed.Peck, p. 25 Both rigids and tractors were offered from the get go. The new 8.25 liter cross-flow six-cylinder diesel was offered in naturally aspirated (DH825) or turbocharged (DHB825) forms, with either SAE.Peck, p. 26 In 1972, the heavier-duty (32 tons GVW) F2200 appeared, with three versions of the 825 engine with power ranging from . The more powerful models showed the strongest sales. F198 The narrower yet, at , F198 cab arrived in 1972. It was available as the F1200 or the F1400 and was meant for light duty work.Peck, p. 27 This version was short-lived, being replaced in 1975 by DAF's new 500-1300 range which used the all new Club of Four cab, built by Magirus in Ulm, Germany.Peck, p. 33 The F1200 has a 4770 cc inline-six engine with . The larger F1400 receives the 5760 cc DD575 diesel motor with DIN at 2400 rpm. The range seems to have been produced for another few years in small numbers, until around 1978 (when the heavier F1300 and F1500 Club of Four models were introduced). F220 1983 DAF FA 2105 In 1976, at the Earl's Court Commercial Motor Show, the F2300 appeared.Peck, p. 34 This model had been developed due to pressure from the British sales network, and DAF, seeing a sales potential in Europe as well, was happy to oblige. The facelifted 2300 received an all new front appearance, looking like a smaller version of the DAF 2800 (which is exactly what it was). The 2300 was available with two, three, or four axles. The new cab design was called the F220. It replaced the F2200, and soon thereafter a series of smaller variations appeared, replacing the old F218 cabs entirely. Either a short or a sleeper design were available. The heavier 2100 and up models have twin round headlights mounted down low, while the lighter F1600 and 1800 have single rectangular headlamps mounted in the bumper. DAF F1600 tanker A choice of six-, nine-, or twelve-speed manual transmissions were on offer for the 2300, while the smaller 2100 received six- speed transmissions with or without synchronization.Baldwin, p. 40 Engine options were for the 2300 (with an intercooler for the more powerful model) and for the 2100, depending on whether the 825 was normally aspirated or turbocharged. The 2300's cabin was mounted 40 mm higher than on the old 2200 (F218) to allow room for the intercooler plumbing, requiring extra grab handles on the door pillar. The 2300 was a considerable success in the United Kingdom, where it outsold bigger brother 2800 and made DAF a name to be reckoned with. In the early months of 1982, the DAF F2500 arrived. A fettled version of the intercooled 2300 engine provided at 2400 rpm and . The power delivery was somewhat peaky, meaning that multiple gears were a necessity. Standard fitment was the six-speed S.6-90 transmission with a splitter for twelve total gears, and a sixteen-speed \\"Ecosplit\\" ZF 16S112 was an available option. As with the 2300, the 2500 was available with a short or a sleeper cab, two to four axles, as tractors or as rigid trucks. The more powerful engine made it more fuel efficient than the 2300 as well as quicker and easier to drive.TRUCK (September 1982), p. 74 DAF 1900, post-1987 facelift model =Facelift= The F1600 and F1800 were replaced by the modernized 1700 and 1900 in 1987; their front continued DAF's new family design as introduced with the new 95. This facelift also found its way onto the 2100, 2300, and 2500 models. At the Auto RAI in Amsterdam 1989, the new ATi-engined 2700 appeared, supplanting the 2500 in many markets. As for the 2500, the 2700 was designed for inter-regional use, rather than for real long-distance work. While more modern, the nearly twenty years old cab design was beginning to show its age, with questionable ergonomics and a small front windscreen. The new HS 200 ATi engine received DAF's new \\"Advanced Turbocharged Intercooling\\" and produces , a very high specific output for the time. 1990 DAF 2700 ATi tractor After the 1987 merger of Leyland and DAF, the 2300 and 2700 series replaced the Leyland (T45) Cruiser in the British market.Peck, p. 44 The F218 and F220 cabs were also used for a number of military vehicles provided to the Dutch Armed Forces from 1976 into the 21st century. Originally as the YA-4440 rigid, other models are the 5441, 4442, 5442.

Headlined by stars Shin Young-kyun, Choi Eun-hee, Choi Moo-ryong some of the best known South Korean actors of their time, Red Scarf is among the most iconic of prolific director Shin Sang-ok's work, and was well received outside of South Korea. The film was made with the cooperation of the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) and is particularly well remembered for its aerial sequences; especially the final showdown between RoKAF F-86 Sabres and Korean People's Air Force MiG-15s. It inspired the 2012 action film R2B: Return to Base. ==Plot== In 1952, during the Korean War, many South Korean fighter pilots were killed. Of those that remain is one of the bravest and best, Major Na Gwan- jung. In the air he is cool and level headed, and directly and swiftly dispatches the enemy with a minimum of complication. On the ground he spends his time drinking with his comrades, the vagaries of life and death in wartime has led to the pilots adopting a live for the moment approach to life. Ji-seon is the wife of a fallen pilot, widowed very soon after becoming married, unable to support herself the only option left to her is to become a bargirl. Na Gwan-jung saves her from this fate, helps provide for her, and falls in love with her. However, as she is the widow of a close comrade Gwan-jung cannot bring himself to act on his love; instead he acts as matchmaker introducing her to Bae Dae-bong, a cocky hotshot pilot, newly transferred to his unit. Na Gwan-jung's unit is tasked with the destruction of a vitally strategic bridge, during which Bae Dae-bong's plane is shot down. Not wanting Ji-seon to lose another loved one, Gwan-jung risks all to keep the downed pilot safe until he can be recovered. The South Korean pilots are victorious and complete their mission, however with thoughts other than taking down the enemy fighter pilots spoiling his focus, Na Gwan-jung is unable to fly and fight in his usual cool, detached and dispassionate way and is killed in action. The unit returns to base and Na Gwan-jung's will is read out, and in accordance with it his effects, including the red scarf which all the pilots wear, are divided amongst his comrades. Na Gwan-jung's mother arrives to visit her son with a delivery of beer, only to find that he has died in action.

In Taiwan it proved popular from the school playground upwards, children played at and wanted to grow up to be aviators, the theme song could be heard in every back alley and the red scarf became a fashion item.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLgm6XCF2a4 The film has been described as a precursor of the Korean Wave in Taiwan. In Taiwan and Chinese speaking areas it was known as Á¥ÖÂ∑æÁâπÊîªÈöä, literally Red Scarf Special Operations Unit. ==Remake== In 2011 work began on loose remake of the film as a last project for Korean entertainer Rain prior to the start of his mandatory military service. Red Scarf was used as a working title and in preproduction, the film was released in 2012 as R2B: Return to Base. In the remake the point of view character is the new hotshot pilot transferred to the unit. Like its predecessor Return to Base was made with the full support of the RoKAF, and like its predecessor its final message is that the RoKAF stands vigilant and ready to defend South Korea from the North. ==See also== *The Bridges at Toko- ri ==ReferencesNotes== *This article is based on the Chinese language version of this article. *This article uses where possible the established romanizations of cast and crew member's names, where these have been impossible to find (and for the character names), the names used are revised romanizations of the names given in the Chinese Wikipedia article read as Hanja. ==External links== * * *Red Scarf at Naver Category:Korean War aviation films Category:1964 films Category:South Korean war films Category:South Korean films Category:Aviation films ","title":"Red Scarf (film)"},{"id":"46314495","text":"Leaksville-Spray Institute, also known as Leaksville-Spray Academy and Leaksville-Spray Intermediate School, was a historic school complex located at Eden, Rockingham County, North Carolina.

Warrant Officer Cluff‚Äôs expertise in small-boat life-saving operations and confidence in his men's abilities resulted in Coast Guard Motor Lifeboat CG 36500 crew‚Äôs rescue of thirty-two survivors from the stern section of the SS Pendleton ‚Äúonly minutes before it capsized.‚ÄùLetter of Commendation from Vice Admiral Merlin O‚ÄôNeil, USCG Commandant, to BOSN Daniel W. Cluff, dated April 16, 1952 The rescue of survivors from SS Pendleton's stern was not the only rescue operation underway by the Chatham station in this storm. Cluff also oversaw the rescue efforts of another Chatham motor lifeboat that spent twenty two hours at sea assisting in several attempts to locate and rescue survivors from the bow of the SS Pendleton and the SS Fort Mercer. Simultaneously, while coordinating and directing all phases of Chatham‚Äôs rescue operations, Cluff stayed in communication with the Coast Guard‚Äôs First District, assisted local fisherman, and maintained cooperative relations with a large number of the press who reported on the rescue from the Chatham Lifeboat Station. Chatham‚Äôs rescue efforts during those two days were part of an even larger rescue operation overseen by the Coast Guard‚Äôs First District that resulted in the rescue of seventy mariners‚Äîincluding those from the SS Pendleton‚Äôs stern‚Äîwithout any loss of life of the eight men from Chatham who risked their lives by heading out to sea in thirty-six-foot motor lifeboats. The media reported on this rescue operation extensively and pressed the Coast Guard for real-time information as rescue operations unfolded. Cluff, who grew up in the fishing and Coast Guard community of Chincoteague, VA, was the son of a thirty-year career Coast Guardsman. Cluff served 13 years as an enlisted small-boat, life-saving operator and a combat tour in the Pacific as a World War II assault-boat coxswain before his promotion to warrant officer and assignment as officer-in-charge of Chatham Lifeboat Station in 1950. ==Early life and education== Cluff was born in Chincoteague, Virginia, and grew up on the water as a Coast Guard dependent. His father was a career Coast Guardsman. After attending high school and business school, Cluff enlisted in the Coast Guard on December 17, 1936, in Chincoteague, Virginia.Id. ==Initial active duty service== Cluff began his thirty-year Coast Guard career as a Surfman at Parramore Beach Station on Virginia‚Äôs Eastern Shore, not far from his hometown of Chincoteague, Virginia. He served the first thirteen years of his career operating small boats with a focus on life-saving operations. ==World War II service== During World War II, he served on the USS McKean as an ‚Äúassault boat coxswain‚Äù for beach-landing boats where he, along with his shipmates, earned a Navy Unit Commendation for their service during ‚ÄúThe Guadalcanal Campaign, August 7 to September 5, 1942.‚ÄùLetter from Chief of Naval Personnel to BMC(L) Daniel W.

He served as officer-in-charge of the Chatham Lifeboat Station from September 15, 1950, to July 31, 1952. As the officer-in-charge of Chatham Lifeboat Station, Cluff led the station‚Äôs rescue operation efforts on the fateful night of Monday, February 18, 1952. Chatham Station and its men made an important contribution to one part of a larger rescue operation led by the Coast Guard First District that would eventually lead to the rescue of seventy men and special recognition for twenty-one Coast Guardsmen.An Epic Job, by Paul V.

Much earlier that day, at around 12:30pm, February 18, 1952, Cluff had dispatched Coast Guard Motor Lifeboat CG36383 to assist with rescue operations of Fort Mercer, but what later turned out to be the bow of Pendleton. The crew, led by BMC Donald H. Bangs and consisting of BM1 Emery H. Haynes, SN Antonio F. Ballerini, and SN Richard J. Ciccone, coordinated rescue operations with another lifeboat, Coast Guard cutters and air-sea planes until 10:45pm the following evening. Although this crew did not bring in any survivors, they spent more than twenty-two hours at sea, under grueling conditions in an attempt to rescue potential survivors.Affidavit of witness to the SS Pendleton and SS Mercer rescue operation (name illegible) witnessed before Levi Denson, Justice of the Peace, February 26, 1952. Cluff recommended both crews for awards: the Gold Lifesaving medal to the crew of CG36500 and the Coast Guard‚Äôs Commendation medal to the crew of CG36383.

The campaign for the statue's removal received global attention and led to a wider movement to \\"decolonise\\" education across South Africa. On 9 April 2015, following a UCT Council vote the previous night, the statue was removed. Rhodes Must Fall captured national headlines throughout 2015 and sharply divided public opinion in South Africa. It also inspired the emergence of allied student movements at other universities, both within South Africa and elsewhere in the world. == Background == The bronze statue of a seated Cecil Rhodes was sculpted by Marion Walgate (n√©e Mason), wife of architect Charles Walgate, who worked with J. M. Solomon in designing and constructing the new buildings at the University of Cape Town (UCT). It was unveiled in 1934.Jeremy Harding, Rhodes Must Fall, London Review of Books Blog, 1 April 2015WALGATE, Charles Percival, Artefacts.co.za Calls for the statue's removal had been slowly increasing for several decades, with Afrikaner students first demanding the removal of the statue in the 1950s. Afrikaner students wanted the statue removed because Rhodes was a British imperialist who wanted to continue British rule in South Africa, and considered the Afrikaner population to be less-than the British. ==Ideology and goals== Rhodes Must Fall describes itself as \\"a collective movement of students and staff members mobilising for direct action against the reality of institutional racism at the University of Cape Town.\\" Whilst initially being focused on the removal of the statue of Cecil John Rhodes, Rhodes Must Fall states that \\"the fall of 'Rhodes' is symbolic for the inevitable fall of white supremacy and privilege at our campus.\\" The movement was initially about the removal of the statue of Cecil Rhodes, a symbol which the protesters felt was oppressive, and grew to encompass institutional racism, the lack of racial transformation at the university, and access to tertiary education and student accommodation. Students made use of occupation, civil disobedience, and violence during the protests. Actions included throwing human feces at the Rhodes statue, occupying UCT offices, and burning art, vehicles, and buildings. Students also made use of the internet; protesting students created a Facebook page entitled 'Rhodes Must Fall' and promoted and made use of the hashtag '#RhodesMustFall' on Twitter. Leaders The first action of the movement took place on 9 March 2015, when Chumani Maxwele \\"picked up one of the buckets of faeces that sat reeking on the kerbside\\" and \\"hurled its contents\\" to a bronze statue of the 19th- century British colonialist Cecil John Rhodes, as reported by The Guardian. The Times later named Chumani as \\"The faeces-throwing activist who orchestrated the #RhodesMustFall campaign at UCT.\\" Ntokozo Qwabe was named as \\"one of the leaders of the Rhodes Must Fall movement at Oxford University in the UK\\" by BusinessTech and by the Daily Mirror. Parisian magazine Jeune Afrique named Youssef Robinson \\"one of the leaders of the movement in Britain.\\" Athabile Nonxuba was also named a leader of the movement at UCT by City Press. National Public Radio interviewed Kgotsi Chikane and named him \\"one of the leaders of the Rhodes Must Fall movement.\\" == Protests ==  2015 Protests: The statue, decolonisation  Rhodes falls (9 April 2015) The first protest, and the action that started the Rhodes Must Fall campaign occurred on 9 March 2015, when Chumani Maxwele threw human faeces onto the statue and toyi-toyi'd with approximately a dozen protesters at the statue. Maxwele was charged with assault after he was involved in a physical altercation with a security officer during the protest. It was reported that a UCT security officer had prevented a photographer from taking photos of the protest. UCT announced that it was investigating the incident. On 12 March 2015, an open air dialogue took place on the stairs of Jammie Plaza, the focal point of the UCT Upper Campus, to discuss the statue, with points from all sides being heard. The following week, a march to the UCT administrative building, Bremner, took place, demanding a date for the removal of the statue. On 20 March 2015, students stormed the Bremner building, which houses the UCT offices during a speech addressing the removal of the statue by UCT vice- chancellor Max Price. On 22 March, it was reported that the students were still occupying the building and that members of the public were supplying them with food. The protesters \\"renamed\\" the building Azania House, an indication that the movement takes an Africanist position on national identity, thus rejecting the civic and non-racial tradition of the ANC. UCT's senate voted in favour of the removal of the statue on 27 March 2015, and following the vote, the statue was boarded up pending the final decision from the university's council. On 9 April 2015 the Rhodes statue was removed. Protest quickly spread around South Africa's universities, defacing statues and calling for the \\"decolonisation of education\\" in South Africa. =Controversial statements= == \\"One Settler, One Bullet\\" == On 8 April 2015 protesters disrupted the UCT Council meeting which had been called to discuss the removal of the statue and prevented members of the Council from leaving. According to a statement issued by Max Price, Vice-Chancellor of UCT, protestors chanted \\"One Settler, One Bullet\\", a rallying cry during apartheid, both at the meeting and the following day during the removal of the statue. On Tuesday 14 April 2015, Rhodes Must Fall issued a statement from its official Facebook page calling on its members to join a protest in the parking lot of the Bremner Building which ended with the slogan \\"ONE BULLET, ONE SETTLER!\\" This post was subsequently deleted. == Support for Mcebo Dlamini == On 25 April 2015, Mcebo Dlamini, then president of the Students' Representative Council (SRC) of Wits University, stated in a Facebook post that he \\"loves Adolf Hitler\\" and admired Hitler for his \\"charisma\\" and \\"organisational skills.\\" In the same post Dlamini also stated that he \\"loves Robert Mugabe.\\" Dlamini later declared during a radio interview on PowerFM, \\"Jews are devils,\\" a remark which led the South African Jewish Board of Deputies to lay criminal charges of hate speech against him. Dlamini was ultimately dismissed as SRC President on unrelated charges of misconduct. Wits University Vice Chancellor Adam Habib stated, \\"I believe that Mr Dlamini has single-handedly wrought more damage on Wits University's reputation than any other person who I can think of in at least the last two decades.\\" On 7 May 2015 Rhodes Must Fall tweeted \\"Why Mcebo Dlamini's views on Hitler are not outrageous\\", including a link to an anonymous letter in the student newspaper Wits Vuvuzela bearing this title. On the same day Eyewitness News reported that the Rhodes Must Fall movement stated that it \\"rejects the removal of Wits SRC President Mcebo Dlamini.\\" 2016 protests: accommodation, decolonisation, and institutional culture Protests resumed at the University of Cape Town at the start of the academic year on 15 February 2016, when members of the Rhodes Must Fall movement constructed a shack at a heavily used pedestrian crossing and road at the base of the Jameson Steps on the university's main campus. The shack was set up to protest what some students perceived as a lack of housing for black students and unfairness in the allocation of student housing. The University responded, stating that the shack needed to be relocated by 5 p.m. the following day, as its placement was causing traffic congestion. The following day, the shack was removed after 6 p.m. by the University. In response, Rhodes Must Fall supporters vandalised two statues, one of Jan Smuts and another of Maria Emmeline Barnard Fuller; burned paintings, predominantly portraits of white people, collected from university buildings (including two collages in remembrance of the revered anti-apartheid activist Molly Blackburn,South Africa: Art destroyed and censored at the University of Capetown. Freemuse.org, 21 July 2007 five anti-apartheid-themed paintings by black artist Keresemose Richard Baholo, who was the first black student to receive a master's degree in Fine Art from UCT and who later supported the activists' actions); torched three vehicles, including a Jammie Shuttle transport bus; and petrol-bombed the office of the university's vice-chancellor. The University of Cape Town stated that the shortage, 6,680 beds for 27,000 students, was due to three reasons: greatly increased student numbers caused by lower fees, students rewriting deferred exams caused by the protests the previous year, and the clearance of historical student debt increasing the number of returning students. The university also stated that their ability to respond to the housing problem was hampered by the occupation of three buildings hosting the Student Housing department by Rhodes Must Fall protesters. The university also refuted protesters' claims of prioritising the housing of white students, stating that 75% of students in university residences were black. The university claimed that a number of the protesters were not university students and that due to the \\"intimidation of others, demeaning utterances, and distortion of facts\\" it was taking criminal action against the protesters. Eight protesters were arrested on charges of public violence and malicious damage. In the same week, non-black students were also barred from the UCT residences' dining hall by Rhodes Must Fall protesters and denied food from the cafeteria. Similar protests erupted across South Africa during February 2016 with protests at North-West University, University of the Free State, University of Witwatersrand, University of Pretoria, and the University of KwaZulu-Natal. == Reactions == On 22 March 2015, UCT lecturer Xolela Mangcu told the Cape Times newspaper that the university was not hiring enough black professors. He said that only 5 out of the 200 senior professors at the university were black. A week later, Julius Malema of the Economic Freedom Fighters agreed that the statue should be removed and that the student protests were against not only the statue, but white supremacy itself. Albie Sachs suggested to \\"keep him [Rhodes] alive on the campus and force him, even if posthumously, to witness surroundings that tell him and the world that he is now living in a constitutional democracy.\\"Albie Sachs: 'The Rhodes debate: How we can have the last laugh'. In: CityPress, 29 March 2015 During March 2015, the Faculty of Engineering & the Built Environment at the University of Cape Town ran a poll on whether or not the statue should be moved. Out of 2700 students, 1100 students voted. Sixty percent of them were against the removal of the statue, 38% were in favour of its removal and the remaining 2% abstained. However, the poll did not measure strength of opinion. A consensus in the Senate found that many who are against removal did not feel strongly about the issue. Apartheid-era president, F. W. de Klerk has criticised the movement, calling the movement a \\"folly\\" and the students \\"full of sound and fury\\". He argues that Rhodes was \\"the architect of the Anglo-Boer War that had a disastrous impact on our people, yet the National Party government never thought of removing his name from our history\\". De Klerk continued on by saying in a letter to The Times that for better or for worse, \\"Rhodes had made an impact on history, which included the positive contribution of his scholarship scheme.\\" Some critics of the movement worry that the focus is on quantity rather than quality of education, and that an increase in the number of students accepted to universities will lead to a decrease in the quality of their education, as money which would have gone towards securing quality educators goes instead to subsidising students' fees. Sikhakhane draws parallels between South Africa's path and the situation in Chile and Colombia. The university protests have been criticised for their increasingly violent nature and their racism against non-black students, especially their \\"extreme hatred of whites\\". Some black students claim they fear retribution should they not support the protests. == Other universities == Stellenbosch University In mid April 2015, the student- and staff-led activist organisation Open Stellenbosch was founded at the University of Stellenbosch to promote similar aims, but with more of a focus on the role of language‚Äîspecifically Afrikaans‚Äîin education at the university. The organisation was inspired by the Rhodes Must Fall movement at the University of Cape Town. Four independent University of Cape Town students produced a short video documentary called Luister in which students attending Stellenbosch and Elsenburg College explained their experiences of racism and slow transformation at the university and the college. On 12 November 2015, the University of Stellenbosch's Rector's Management Team recommended a new language policy in line with Open Stellenbosch's demands; specifically the adoption of English as a lingua franca. Rhodes University At Rhodes University, the Black Students Movement was started on 17 March in solidarity with the UCT Rhodes Must Fall Movement. The movement then began agitating for the name of Rhodes University to change, and has since made several interventions towards transforming Rhodes University, which it regards as a colonial university. In late May 2015, following protests and complaints by the Black Students Movement, the university, Rhodes University (named after Cecil Rhodes) approved plans to formally begin the process of changing the university's name. In 2017, the Rhodes University Council voted 15‚Äì9 in favour of keeping the existing name.Name change for Rhodes University rejected, Times LiveRhodes University votes to keep its name, Business Live While the university agreed with critics that \\"[it] cannot be disputed that Cecil John Rhodes was an arch-imperialist and white supremacist who treated people of this region as sub-human\\", it also said it had long since distanced itself from the person and had distinguished itself with the name Rhodes University as one of the world's best. The main argument against the change was financial, as such a change would cost a significant amount of money and the university was already having trouble with its budget. Furthermore, changing the university's name could have an adverse effect on its recognition internationally.No name change for Rhodes University following council vote, Mail & Guardian University of Pretoria On 19 February 2016, the AfriForum Youth, the Progressive Youth Alliance, and the EFF as well as the Democratic Alliance Student Organization (DASO) met with the university to vote on the removal of Afrikaans as a language of instruction. Following clashes between students and police, 24 students were arrested for public violence. The following day, the university announced that the Hatfield and Groenkloof campuses would be closed until the university could ensure the safety of its students and staff. On 22 February 2016, the university proposed that its medium of instruction would become English-only. Protests against Afrikaans continued, with students boycotting classes and forcing other students out of their lectures. Lectures were cancelled as a result. University of the Free State On 22 February 2016, a group of 35 people consisting of contract workers and students, were arrested at the University of the Free State on charges of contempt of court and illegal gathering. Oriel College at University of Oxford, UK The High Street facade of Oriel College, Oxford, UK, with the Cecil Rhodes Statue magnified. This statue has been the focus of the Rhodes Must Fall movement in Oxford to date. At the University of Oxford, students called for a statue of Rhodes to be removed from Oriel College, and started a movement at the university to better represent non-white culture in the curriculum as well as to combat racial discrimination and insensitivity. Organising members of Rhodes Must Fall in Oxford stated that awareness should be raised at the university about the institution's implication in colonialism and the violence that accompanied it, and that representation of 'black voices' should be improved. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Harry Mount described Oxford's Rhodes Must Fall campaign as the product of \\"a generation raised to believe that their feelings are all that matter\\", arguing that academics had been too indulgent towards student activists. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica made this comment about Rhodes which explains the controversy: he \\"once defined his policy as 'equal rights for every white man south of the Zambezi' and later, under liberal pressure, amended 'white' to 'civilized'. But he probably regarded the possibility of native Africans becoming 'civilized' as so remote that the two expressions, in his mind, came to the same thing.Encyclopaedia Britannica Effects Of The Jameson Raid On Rhodes‚Äôs Career On 19 January 2016, students at the Oxford Union (a private student debating society, without official endorsement or links to the University of Oxford) voted 245 to 212 in favour of removing the statue of Rhodes. Ultimately, on 29 January 2016, it was announced that the statue would remain, after \\"furious donors threatened to withdraw gifts and bequests worth more than ¬£100 million\\" if it was removed. Commenting on the Rhodes controversy, and a similar demand to remove Nelson's column due to slavery issues, the former director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Sir Roy Strong, stated: \\"Once you start rewriting history on that scale, there won't be a statue or a historic house standing....The past is the past. You can't rewrite history.\\" The legacy of Cecil Rhodes at The University of Oxford is far-reaching, as in his will Rhodes established The Rhodes Scholarships. Each year, some 100 international students are selected to study at Oxford under the scholarship that bears Rhodes' name. This scholarship is regarded as one of the most prestigious scholarships in the world. When some of those in receipt of the scholarship were challenged over their opposition to iconography of Rhodes in Oxford, they commented \\"this scholarship does not buy our silence\\" and that \\"...there is no hypocrisy in being a recipient of a Rhodes scholarship and being publicly critical of Cecil Rhodes and his legacy\\". This followed a number of criticisms by British media outlets, and on social media, against the scholarship holders Ntokozo Qwabe and Joshua Nott in response to their involvement in the movement. The students commented that \\"...a wave of ad hominem and unfounded accusations, hate speech and racism have flooded social media, the press and indeed Ntokozo‚Äôs personal inbox.\\". In June 2020, the issue was again brought to attention during the George Floyd protests in the United Kingdom. Two large Rhodes Must Fall protests occurred outside Oriel College, on High Street in central Oxford to call for the removal of the Rhodes statue from the Oriel building. The first protest occurred on the 9th of June 2020 and was attended by over 1000 people. The second protest occurred on the 16th of June and was a march from Cowley, a nearby suburb of Oxford, through to the Oriel College building on High Street and onto the University of Oxford Museum of Natural History. Both protests were peaceful. On the 17th of June 2020, some University of Oxford professors expressed opinions in support of the Rhodes Must Fall movement at Oxford. In particular, within a letter to The Telegraph, they criticised the University of Oxford Vice-Chancellor Louise Richardson for claims she made concerning the Rhodes Must Fall movement engaging in the 'hiding of history'. In response to this, meetings of the Oriel College undergraduates, the Oriel junior common room (JCR), and the Oriel graduates, the Oriel middle common room (MCR), as they are called at Oxbridge colleges, both passed motions calling for the removal of the statue. On the 17th of June 2020, the Oriel College Governing Body convened to vote on the possible removal of the Rhodes statue. The outcome of this meeting was that the college would formally move to have the Cecil Rhodes statue removed from their building, along with the King Edward Street Plaque. The announcement was not for the immediate removal of the statue, but rather that the College move to immediately establish a 'independent Commission of Inquiry into the key issues surrounding the Rhodes statue', and that the submission from the College Governing Body to this Commission would be for the removal of the Rhodes statue and plaque. The Commission will be led by Carole Souter CBE, the current Master of St Cross College, Oxford, and it was announced that the commission will accept written and oral evidence from all stakeholder including activist groups such as Rhodes Must Fall, and the general public. The Commission intends to report by the end of 2020. Councillor Susan Brown, Leader of Oxford City Council, welcomed this announcement and invited a 'early submission of a formal planning application from Oriel to accompany the review process and feed into it'. Should Oriel College submit a planning application for the removal of the statue from what the College refers to as 'The Rhodes Building' listed building consent and the permission from Historic England will be required, as the building is grade II* listed. The possible removal of the Rhodes statue at Oriel College follows a 2016 YouGov survey which concluded that 59% of British people say a statue of colonialist Cecil Rhodes at Oxford University should not be taken down ‚Äì and 44% even said 'we should be proud of British colonialism'.https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles- reports/2016/01/18/rhodes-must-not-fall It is not clear how the views of the British public may have shifted in light of the 2020 reinvigoration of the Black Lives Matter movement across the Western world. In June 2020, international lawyer Ann Olivarius, a former Rhodes Scholar, wrote an op-ed in The Financial Times advocating replacing the Cecil Rhodes statue with two other Rhodes Scholars, Alain Locke, the first African-American scholar and Zambian human rights advocate Lucy Banda-Sichone.Ann Olivarius, \\"Rhodes must fall, but who should stand in his place?,\\" Financial Times 15 June 2020. That same month, the governing body of Oxford's Oriel college voted to remove the statue of Rhodes. Later that month, an essay in the London Review of Books suggested that though Rhodes Must Fall had made a good start, anti-racist organising in UK higher education had much further to go.  Harvard Law School, USA  In Fall 2015 a group of law students calling itself Royall Must Fall and inspired by Rhodes Must Fall called for the retirement of the Harvard Law School shield, publishing an open letter to law school dean Martha Minow in the Harvard Law Record and posting signs and posters throughout the campus. Depicting three wheat sheaves, the shield incorporated the coat of arms of Isaac Royall Jr., a Harvard benefactor who had endowed the law school's first professorship. The shield had become a source of contention among Royall Must Fall activists because of the Royall family's history as slave-owners. The movement's inception was accompanied by several controversial incidents, most notably when black tape was mysteriously placed over the portraits of prominent African-American faculty members. In addition to spurring several students to express their views about the incident in an \\"#HLSUntaped\\" feature in the law school's student newspaper and at on-campus assemblies, the controversy soon eclipsed the law school and garnered university-wide interest, with several articles published in The Harvard Crimson and with some Harvard undergraduates joining protesting law students in solidarity. Several national news organizations picked up on the controversy as well. After the shield was ordered retired on 15 March 2016, Royall Must Fall renamed itself Reclaim Harvard Law and broadened its focus. Prominent members of Reclaim included third-year student A.J. Clayborne, but the group was organized in an equitable manner to counteract the perceived hierarchical nature of Harvard Law School. Reclaim sparked controversy when it occupied the law school's lounge and renamed it Belinda Hall after a female slave who was enslaved by the Royall family. After conservative students placed posters in the occupied lounge that were then torn down by students from Reclaim, Dean Martha Minow reaffirmed the school's commitment to free speech in an email to the student body and in the school's student newspaper. This and other incidents sparked an on-campus debate in Spring 2016 about whether free speech could undermine social justice. As part of the debate, the Harvard Law Record's editor-in-chief and third-year law student Michael Shammas faced criticism from right-wing students for refusing to publish videos of activists tearing down pro-free speech posters, as well as criticism from some left-wing activists for accepting conservative op-eds for publication. Shammas, who was politically liberal, noted that even though he supported anti-racist protesters, his role was \\"editor-in-chief, not thought- policeman-in-chief.\\" Prominent Harvard Law professors such as Duncan Kennedy, Annette Gordon-Reed, Randall Kennedy, and Scott Brewer also weighed in, including in national newspapers such as The New York Times. The effects of the Royall Must Fall and Reclaim Harvard Law continue to be felt on the law school campus today. In September 2017, the school unveiled a plaque acknowledging slavery's role in its history, which reads, \\"May we pursue the highest ideals of law and justice in their memory.\\" The controversies that occurred over the 2015-2016 year are recounted from a conservative perspective in a book by Kayleigh McEnany, a prominent conservative and former Trump spokeswoman who was a third-year law student at the time. McEnany's view of the controversy, in which she is critical of the protesters, differs from many expressed at the time. Indeed, some students who defended free speech during the controversy nonetheless wrote that they suspected that some on-campus conservatives may have rallied around free speech as a way to fight Reclaim's aims while hiding their own racism. Several articles appeared comparing the Rhodes Must Fall and Royall Must Fall movements, in both positive and negative lights. Other  Small student protests in support of or directly inspired by the removal of the statue and the Rhodes Must Fall movement also occurred at the University of Edinburgh and the University of California, Berkeley. Berkeley protesters felt the demands of the Rhodes Must Fall movement were relevant to their own grievances of perceived black marginalisation at Berkeley. At the University of Cambridge the movement catalysed the creation of similar 'decolonisation' student led initiatives such as the return of the okukor cockerel statue (taken during the punitive Benin Expedition of 1897) at Jesus College to Nigeria. == Other statues == J.H. Hofmeyr in Cape Town being cleaned by a pair of non-protesting volunteers on 11 April 2015 On 22 March 2015, the EFF's president, Julius Malema, called for all other symbols of colonialism and apartheid in South Africa to be removed. Following that, a number of colonial era statues across the country were vandalised, including the statue of King George V at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. EFF members were implicated in the vandalism of a number of Anglo-Boer War statues, including that on 4 April of the Uitenhage War memorial statue for fallen British soldiers, a 6 April attack on the Horse Memorial in Port Elizabeth dedicated to the animals that served in the war, and the 7 April vandalism, with green paint, of Paul Kruger's statue in Church Square, Pretoria. The statue of Louis Botha situated outside the Houses of Parliament in Cape Town was vandalised on 9 April. EFF spokesperson Mbuyeseni Ndlozi said on 9 April that the party would have to take responsibility for its members' actions, but that the EFF was for the removal, not vandalism or destruction, of colonial and apartheid symbols in the public space. In response to the vandalism of the Louis Botha Statue and Horse Memorial, local supporters of the monuments laid wreaths at the monuments a few days afterwards. To protect it from future vandalism, the Horse Memorial was temporarily moved to a safe space by the local municipality. The chairperson of the Nelson Mandela Bay region of the EFF, Bo Madwara, threatened to \\"unload it into the sea\\" should the monument be restored. On 18 September 2015, the bronze bust of Rhodes at Rhodes Memorial was vandalised. The nose was cut off and the memorial was daubed with graffiti accusing Rhodes of being a \\"Racist, thief, [and] murderer\\". It appeared that the vandals had attempted to cut off the whole head. In October 2018, the nose was restored by a local artist.

(2015) == Controversies over Rhodes Scholars who are Rhodes Must Fall activists == Ntokozo Qwabe, one of the founders of Rhodes Must Fall and a Rhodes Scholar, was the subject of controversy over seemingly racist comments towards a white waitress in South Africa. For this he was widely criticized in the UK and in South Africa. A few days after the November 2015 Paris attacks Qwabe also caused controversy comparing the French flag to the Nazi swastika and calling for it to be banned from universities. Joshua Nott, a former publicist for Rhodes Must Fall, was accused of hypocrisy, including by Rhodes Must Fall, over subsequently applying for and accepting a Rhodes Scholarship. The Rhodes Trust was criticized for not awarding the scholarship to someone more deserving. Following the completion of his studies at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, Nott took up a position of paid employment at the Rhodes Trust. He is employed as 'Associate - Global Partnerships' within the Trust's Rise program. ==See also== * Occupy movement * Rhodes Memorial * Black Nationalism * Decommunization in Ukraine * Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials * List of protests in the 21st century ==References * Statue of Cecil Rhodes, University of Cape Town Category:2015 in South Africa Category:2015 protests Category:Internet memes Category:Internet-based activism Category:Nonviolent occupation Category:Nonviolent resistance movements Category:Progressivism in South Africa Category:Protests in South Africa Statue of Cecil Rhodes, University of Cape Town Statue of Cecil Rhodes, University of Cape Town Category:Vandalism Category:University of Cape Town Category:Cultural depictions of Cecil Rhodes Category:Removed statues ","title":"Rhodes Must Fall"},{"id":"46314757","text":"Andr√©s Palomino in 2014 Andr√©s Palomino Robles (born 1978, Barcelona) is a Spanish webcomic creator and screenwriter, best known for creating the webcomic Las Cr√≥nicas PSN. == Career == a cartoon drawn by Palomino in 2014 Palomino began working as a for Televisi√≥ de Catalunya in 2002, doing screenwriting for the Spanish children's TV show Club Super3.

Having served as mayor of the town of Karpenisi, he was popularly elected Regional governor of Central Greece in the 2014 local elections. In June 2019, he was elected as the new Mayor of Athens starting from 25 August 2019. ==Early life and education== Born 1978 in Athens to New Democracy politicians Dora and Pavlos Bakoyannis, Kostas Bakoyannis lost his father Pavlos in 1989, when he was assassinated by the leftist terrorist group, Revolutionary Organization 17 November. He studied history and International Relations at Brown University and graduated from Harvard with a Master of Public Administration. He is currently working on his PhD thesis at St Antony's College, Oxford, in the field of Political Science and International Relations. He speaks English and German. Kostas Bakoyannis‚Äô articles are often published in the Greek and foreign press. ==Career== Mayor of Karpenisi In August 2010, Bakoyannis announced to run for mayoral office as an independent candidate in the small town of Karpenisi in Evrytania, where his father had originally come from. New Democracy decided not to challenge Bakoyannis with a candidate of its own, though the party had expelled his mother Dora in May for voting in favor of the austerity measures proposed by the Papandreou government. Bakoyannis won the local elections with 54.3%. In a To Vima interview he strongly defended the bailout deal stating that \\"where we have come to after all the crimes that the Greek political system made over the past 30 years, we had no choice but the Memorandum.\\" He said that he wouldn't rule out joining the new Democratic Alliance party his mother had founded, and that \\"Greece needs suicidal governments ready to kill themselves to save the country.\\" Regional governor of Central Greece During his third year as Mayor of Karpenisi, Bakoyannis decided to run for the governorship of Central Greece, again as an independent. His decision to leave the Mayorship was initiated by a growing number of citizen‚Äôs voices from the greater Central Greece area, not only Karpenisi, who saw the risks and the opportunities that were coming up ahead for their area in the next 5 year term of the new Governor, and wanted a results oriented, tested and tried candidate for the job. He was however backed by New Democracy, which again nominated no candidate of its own, and clearly won the 2014 regional election with 56.06% in the second round, defeating Syriza's candidate Evangelos Apostolou.

However, due to his lack of temper on the field, he was advised to leave football by his father, Nelsinho. In 2002, after spells at clubs in his native state, Baptista joined his father's staff at Goi√°s, as a fitness coach. The duo remained together for the following nine years, only splitting due to the Japanese tsunami in 2011, when both were at Kashiwa Reysol; Eduardo subsequently returned to Sport (club which he already worked from 2007 to 2009) while Nelsinho remained at Kashiwa. On 31 January 2014 Baptista was appointed interim manager, replacing fired Geninho. On 14 February he was definitely appointed as manager, and led the side to both Campeonato Pernambucano and Copa do Nordeste winning campaigns. On 17 September 2015, Baptista left Sport and was appointed at Fluminense, replacing fired Enderson Moreira. On 25 February 2016, after only two wins in six matches, he was sacked by Flu. On 15 April, he replaced Alexandre Gallo at Ponte Preta's reign. Baptista took Ponte to an impressive eighth place in the league, only four points shy of qualifying for the continental championship. On 2 December 2016 he resigned, and signed a one-year contract with Palmeiras fourteen days later. On 4 May 2017, Baptista was relieved from his duties at Verd√£o. He was named Atl√©tico Paranaense manager on 23 May, but was sacked nonetheless on 10 July. On 20 September 2017, Baptista returned to Ponte.

The original settlement there consisted of a cluster of wells in the wadi protected by an ancient fort (husn). Caravans on the Incense Route would water there and the place also served as a base for Bedouin tribes such as Sa'ar or Sei'ar. Abdulla bin Schuwail al Dawsai, who was active against the Sa'ar in the late 1940s, is known to have been present in the town. One of the first western women to reach this area was Barbara Toy who wrote of her visit there in the 1960s. ==Geography== To reach it from Sana'a involves hundreds of miles of driving across desert. It lies along the N5 highway, north-northwest of Seiyun. The Wadi Hadhramaut has its source near Al Abr and it is about 3,000 feet above sea level. It is served by a small airport. ==Poetry== Poetry is politically significant in the region and the popular poet, Khamis Salim Kindi, made reference to the place in a famous quatrain about the powerful Adbat clan whose area was bombed by the British during WW2 because of their Axis sympathies, as the British had previously bombed the al-Say'ar tribe in the al-'Abr area.

The Government of India honoured him in 1957, with the award of Padma Shri, the fourth highest Indian civilian award for his services to the nation and followed it up with the third highest civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan in 1970. ==Biography== Krishnaswamy Ramiah, born in 1892, started his career, in 1914, as a member of research staff at the Paddy Breeding Station in Coimbatore, in Tamil Nadu. In three years time, by 1917, he produced new cross breeds of rice though pure line selection and breed improvement. Later, he introduced systematic hybridisation programmes, known to be the first Indian scientist to pursue such a protocol in rice breeding. When the Government of India established the Central Rice Research Institute (CRRI) in 1946, Ramiah was selected to head the institution as its founder director and continued at his post when the institute was later brought under the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR). During his tenure there, he also led the International Rice Commission, a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) initiative. He was reported to have contributed to the FAO sponsored Indo- Japonica Hybridization programme which yielded the nitrogen responsive rice varieties of Mahsuri, Malinja, ADT 27 and Circna, the first two released in Malaysia, the third in India and the last one, in Australia.. He also evolved a number of varieties of rice which include GEB 24, ADT 3, CO 4 and CO 25.\\"NRRI Annual Report 2017-2018.\\"icar-nrri.in retrieved on 9 December 2018.

Ramiah was one of the first scientists who advocated for standardisation of gene symbols for rice. Serving as the FAO expert based in Bangkok, he was involved with the rice breeding in many countries. He was known to have conducted advanced research on X-Ray induced mutation of rice and established a gene bank for rice. He was the author of two books on the subject, Rice in Madras and Rice Breeding and Genetics. The British government appointed Ramiah a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1938 Birthday Honours list. After India's independence, the Government of India recognised his services by awarding him the fourth highest civilian honour of Padma Shri in 1957 and the third highest honour of the Padma Bhushan in 1970.

At the same time, fighters from Hadrami tribal alliance, entered the port to fight AQAP.https://www.alarabiya.net/ar/arab-and- world/yemen/2015/04/04/%D9%82%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%84-%D8%AD%D8%B6%D8%B1%D9%85%D9%88%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%AE%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%83%D9%84%D8%A7-%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A9.html There were conflicting accounts of the situation on 5 April, with the Yemen Times reporting that anti-AQAP tribal fighters surrounded the city but were unable to enter it and Reuters reporting that the tribesmen were successful in retaking much of the city from the jihadists, pushing the al-Qaeda fighters out, although the militants reportedly remained in some neighbourhoods. One tribal fighter and two soldiers were reportedly killed in clashes between tribesmen and Yemeni Army soldiers on 5 April. The Yemen Observer reported on 7 April, citing \\"tribal sources\\", that the Hadhramaut Tribal Alliance and militiamen loyal to the embattled president Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi were successful in retaking Mukalla. However, Reuters cited local residents as saying that al-Qaeda remained in control of about half of the city. In 12 April, an drone strike killed 7 AQAP fighters in one of their gatherings in Mukalla.http://www.alweeam.com.sa/331598/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%B7%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%84-8-%D8%B9%D9%86/ One of the killed, was Ibrahim Sulayman Muhammad Arbaysh.http://www.aljazeera.net/news/arabic/2015/4/14/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%86-%D9%85%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%84-%D8%A3%D8%AD%D8%AF-%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A Al-Qaeda-affiliated militants calling themselves the Sons of Hadhramaut seized an oil terminal and infantry base in Mukalla on 16 April, as well as an air defense base and military airport on the city's outskirts. Yemeni troops reportedly deserted their posts to avoid a fight with the militants. The jihadists also captured a massive weapons depot that contained dozens of tanks, Katyusha rocket launchers and small arms. With this advance, Al-Qaeda consolidated its hold on Hadhramaut province.Al-Qaida in Yemen Takes Massive Weapons Depot From Army ==Related incidents== An apparent United States drone strike killed an al-Qaeda leader and spokesman, Ibrahim al-Rubeish, to the west of Mukalla on 12 April. The airstrike was the first carried out by the United States since it abandoned Al Anad Air Base during the previous month. Al-Rubeish was a former Guantanamo Bay detainee who had been released in 2006, after five years in the military prison camp. About 4,000 soldiers in the 135th Brigade based in Hadhramaut switched sides, announcing their support for Hadi after previously backing Saleh and the Houthis, on 16 April. Days later, on 19 April, Brigadier General Abdulrahman al-Halily declared the support of the First Military District and at least 15,000 troops belonging to it for Hadi. In an apparent error by the Arab Coalition Forces, over 70 soldiers loyal to President Abdo Rabu Mansur Hadi were killed and 200 wounded by shelling during the night of 8 July.http://news.insidetheworld.org/2015/07/08/70-soldiers-killed-in-a- bombing-hadi-mistakenly-coalition-in-yemen/ ==See also== *Battle of Mukalla (2016) ==References== Mukalla 2015 Category:2015 in Yemen Category:Yemeni Crisis (2011‚Äìpresent) Mukalla 2015 Mukalla 2015 Category:April 2015 events in Asia Category:Mukalla ","title":"Battle of Mukalla (2015)"},{"id":"46315224","text":"Elachista galbina is a moth of the family Elachistidae.

He overcame persistent injury problems to win twelve races under National Hunt rules. He showed promise as a hurdler and as a Novice steeplechaser before recording his first major win in the 1986 National Hunt Handicap Chase. As a ten-year-old in 1988 he defeated Desert Orchid in the Gainsborough Chase, before taking the Gold Cup at Cheltenham in March. He never won again, but produced a fine effort to finish third on heavy ground in the 1989 Gold Cup. ==Background== Charter Party was a dark bay gelding with no white markings bred in Ireland by Avia Riddell Martin, who once described him as \\"the biggest, ugliest camel you have ever seen\\". He was the only racehorse of any consequence sired by Document, a half-brother of the St James's Palace Stakes winner Above Suspicion and the Ormonde Stakes winner Doutelle. Charter Party's dam Ahoy There also produced Current Call, who in turn produced the Sun Alliance Chase winner Nahthen Lad. Ahoy There was a female-line descendant of Lady Mischief, the grand-dam of The Derby winner Manna.Thoroughbred Bloodlines - Grand Duchess - Family 22-d As a four-year-old, Charter Party was sent to the Doncaster Sales in May 1982 and was bought for 8,000 guineas by Raymond and Jenny Mould who owned the Grange Stud in Guiting Power, Gloucestershire.Jenny Mould dies, aged 54; Owner's horses included Charter Party and Barton Bank. - Free Online Library The Moulds later sold a half- share in the gelding to Colin and Claire Smith. During his racing career the gelding raced alternately in the colours of Jenny Mould and Claire Smith. Charter Party was sent into training with David \\"The Duke\\" Nicholson at Condicote in Gloucestershire. Throughout his racing career, Charter Party was hindered by injury problems related to the navicular bones in his feet. Although he was noted for his ability to sustain a fast gallop over extended distances he was prone to making mistakes in his jumping and often failed to complete the course. ==Racing career== Early career Charter Party began his racing career as a Novice hurdler in the 1982/3 National Hunt season. He finished eighth on his debut at Towcester Racecourse and finished second at Nottingham before recording his first success at Haydock Park Racecourse. He went on to finish second at Newbury and fifth at Aintree before unseating his jockey Peter Scudamore when ten lengths at Newcastle. When switched to novice chasing he was beaten in his first three races before being stepped up in distance and recording his first success over two and a half miles at Worcester Racecourse. He went on to win chases at Sandown Park Racecourse and Newbury but fell heavily at Ascot Racecourse on his final appearance of the season. In the 1984/5 National Hunt season, Charter Party was matched against more experienced chasers. After being placed at Sandown, he fell at Ascot before winning a minor event at Worcester. The gelding went on to win a chase at Newbury, but on his first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival he fell in the Kim Muir Chase. Later that spring he won again at Newbury and finished second to Aces Wild at Cheltenham in April. On his first appearance of the next season Charter Party fell in the Hennessy Gold Cup, before winning at Kempton Park on Boxing Day, but then ran poorly at Windsor in January. In March 1986 Charter Party made his second appearance at the Cheltenham Festival and carried 150 pounds in the National Hunt Handicap Chase. Ridden as in most of his previous races by Peter Scudamore, he won from a field which included the previous year's winner West Tip. On his final appearance of the season he carried top weight to victory in the Golden Miller Chase at Cheltenham in April. Richard Dunwoody took over as Charter Party's regular jockey in the 1986/7 National Hunt season. The campaign was not a successful one, as the gelding failed to win in six races. He finished fourth on his debut at Wincanton, was pulled up in the Hennessy Gold Cup and ran third in under top- weight in the Mandarin Chase. He fell in the Gainsborough Chase at Sandown (won by Desert Orchid) and was beaten when attempting to concede twenty-eight pounds to the future Grand National winner Mr Frisk at Nottingham. On 19 March he made his first attempt to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup. A fall of snow delayed the start and created very challenging conditions. Charter Party fell at the fifth in a race won by The Thinker. 1987/1988 National Hunt season On his first appearance of the 1987/1988 National Hunt season, Charter Party was beaten on heavy ground at Lingfield Park but improved to finish a handicap chase at Kempton on Boxing Day under a weight of 168 pounds. In February the gelding carried 151 pounds in the Gainsborough Chase, and established himself as a serious contender for the Cheltenham Gold Cup, winning by eight lengths from the Welsh National winner Rhyme 'n' Reason, with Desert Orchid third ahead of Run and Skip. On 15 March Charter Party, ridden by Dunwoody, started at odds of 10/1 for the 61st running of the Cheltenham Gold Cup. With Desert Orchid switched to contest the Queen Mother Champion Chase, the favourite for the race was Play School, a New Zealand-bred gelding who had won the Welsh National and the Vincent O'Brien Gold Cup since relocating to Britain. The other contenders included Rhyme 'n' Reason, Run and Skip, Forgive 'n' Forget (winner of the race in 1985), Cybrandian (runner-up in 1987), the French Challenger Nupsala (King George VI Chase), Kildimo (RSA Chase) and the diminutive but improving Cavvies Clown. Dunwoody settled Charter Party just behind the leaders as Beau Ranger set the early pace from Cybrandian. By the end of the first circuit Golden Friend had moved to the front from Cavvies Clown and Run and Skip with Charter Party well placed in fifth. Cavvies Clown took the lead early on the second circuit and took the fourth last in front from Charter Party, whilst Forgive 'n' Forget who appeared to be travelling best of all in third sustained a serious leg injury and was immediately pulled up. With most of the other runners beginning to struggle, the Gold Cup became two-horse race, with Cavvies Clown turning into the straight a length in front of Charter Party. When Cavvies Clown jumped poorly at the penultimate fence and began to hang to the right, Dunwoody sent Charter Party into the lead on the inside. Charter Party jumped the last fence in front and maintained his advantage on the run-in to win by six lengths, with Beau Ranger another ten lengths back in third place. Later career Charter Party remained in training for two more seasons but failed to win again, and became increasingly subject to his leg problems. In December 1988 he finished last when carrying top weight of 168 pounds in the Rehearsal Chase at Chepstow and then came home last of the five runners behind Desert Orchid in the King George VI Chase at Kempton. In February he finished last of four behind Desert Orchid in the Gainborough Chase and then fell in the Vincent O'Brien Gold Cup, which was won by Carvill's Hill. On 16 March, Charter Party started a 14/1 outsider as he attempted to repeat his 1988 success in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Desert Orchid started favourite, whilst the other runners included Carvill's Hill, Cavvies Clown, The Thinker, West Tip and Ten Plus. In a race run on heavy ground Charter Party was one of the few runners to cope with the conditions and raced prominently throughout before finishing third behind Desert Orchid and Yahoo.Results From The 3.30 Race At Cheltenham  16 March 1989  Racing Post The gelding fell at the twelfth fence in the Martell Cup at Aintree Racecourse and unseated Dunwoody at the final fence when favourite for the Golden Miller Chase at Cheltenham in April. In the Whitbread Gold Cup at Sandown on 29 April, Charter Party carried a weight of 160 pounds and finished third behind Brown Windsor and Sam da Vinci, both of whom were carrying 140 pounds. On 22 November 1989, Charter Party started at odds of 8/1 for the Edward Hanmer Chase over three miles at Haydock Park on what was to be his final racecourse appearance. He led until the second last before finishing third behind Golden Friend and The Thinker.Results From The 2.00 Race At Haydock  22 November 1989  Racing Post ==Retirement== Charter Party was retired from racing after his defeat at Haydock in 1989 and spent the rest of his life at the Moulds' farm at Guiting Power. He was euthanised in June 2000 at the age of twenty-two after becoming incapacitated by arthritis. David Nicholson said \\"I consider winning a Gold Cup with Charter Party was my best training performance. He was a very talented and very brave horse, but also a very unsound one. Unfortunately he didn't get the recognition he deserved\\".Charter Party put down at age of 22; Nicholson pays tribute to \`very talented and brave' Gold Cup winner. - Free Online Library ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1978 racehorse births Category:2000 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 22-d ","title":"Charter Party (horse)"},{"id":"46315242","text":"Arb√´r Shytani (born 25 January 1985, in Shkod√´r) is an Albanian retired footballer who last played as a defender for T√´rbuni Puk√´ in the Albanian First Division.Soccerway profile ==References * Profile - FSHF Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Shkod√´r Category:Albanian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:KS Ada Velipoj√´ players Category:KF La√ßi players Category:KF T√´rbuni Puk√´ players Category:Bes√´lidhja Lezh√´ players Category:Albanian Superliga players Category:Albanian First Division players ","title":"Arb√´r Shytani"},{"id":"46315260","text":"The 2015 Duck Commander 500 was a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race held on April 11, 2015 at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, Texas.

He would not maintain the lead, however, as his teammate Kevin Harvick passed him exiting turn 4 on the opening lap. Engine issues were prevalent in the opening stages of the race, as J. J. Yeley took his car to the garage on lap 13 because of engine issues, and Ryan Blaney also reported that his engine was sputtering. The first caution of the race flew on lap 32 when Alex Kennedy spun out in turn 4 after he got loose in turn 3. Kurt Busch exited pit road ahead of Harvick to take the lead, while Justin Allgaier was forced to restart from the tail end for a commitment line violation. Dale Earnhardt, Jr. made a second stop under the caution to add lug nuts to the left-rear of his car ‚Äì instead of the normal five, the tire had only two. The race restarted on lap 37 with Busch out front. Harvick took the lead by the end of the lap, before Busch was able to get back to the front. Brad Keselowski, running fourth at the time, made an unscheduled stop on lap 67 and dropped to 30th. Blaney retired from the race on lap 71, as his engine issues continued. Kyle Larson kicked off a wave of green flag pit stops on lap 79. Busch surrendered the lead on lap 81 to make his stop and Jeff Gordon assumed the lead. Gordon pitted the next lap and the lead cycled to Keselowski, following his unscheduled pit stop. Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. was forced to serve a drive-through penalty for speeding on pit road. Jimmie Johnson took the lead on lap 109, just as debris in turn 3 brought out the second caution of the race. Johnson and Harvick swapped the lead on pit road with Johnson maintaining the lead on exit. Denny Hamlin was forced to drop to the tail end of the field for driving through too many pit boxes exiting pit road. =Green flag run= The race restarted on lap 114 with Johnson in the lead. Kevin Harvick took back the lead on lap 125, and led the next portion of the race before Johnson took back the lead on lap 156, just as cars began hitting pit road for green flag pit stops. Johnson and Harvick swapped the lead over the next few laps, before Harvick ceded his position for a stop and Kasey Kahne assumed the position. Kahne spent two laps at the front of the race, before Johnson cycled back to the head of the field on lap 160. Landon Cassill made an unscheduled stop on lap 167 for a flat tire, almost hitting the wall in turn 4. Second-half =Halfway= Debris in turn 3 brought out the third caution of the race on lap 169. Johnson and Harvick swapped the lead on pit road being pitted on opposite ends, but it was Johnson that exited with the lead. The race restarted on lap 177. Kahne, running eighth, made an unscheduled stop for a loose wheel on lap 198, and rejoined the race in 22nd position. Johnson gave up the lead on lap 220 to make his stop, handing the lead to Paul Menard. He led a lap before the lead went to Kahne, after his unscheduled pit stop. Johnson passed him on fresher tires on lap 226, and held the lead to the fourth caution of the race, which flew on lap 227 when Matt Kenseth just about spun out in turn 4. Johnson and Harvick again swapped the lead on pit road with Johnson again leaving with the lead for the restart, with 100 laps to go. =Bad night for HScott Motorsports= The fifth caution of the race flew with 86 laps to go when Michael Annett hit the wall in turn 2. Just as in the previous pit stop cycle, Johnson and Harvick swapped the lead on pit road with Johnson exiting with the lead. Trevor Bayne was forced to restart at the tail end for driving through too many pit boxes exiting pit road. The race restarted with 79 laps to go, but was soon back under yellow flag conditions ‚Äì for the sixth time, with 75 laps to go ‚Äì after Allgaier hit the wall in turn 2. After an extensive clean up of oil on pit road, a number of drivers stayed out ‚Äì led by Joey Logano ‚Äì while Johnson pitted. Keselowski was forced to drop to the tail end of the field for a commitment violation, while Stenhouse was forced to drop to the tail end of the field for his crew being over the wall too soon. =Final 100 miles= The race restarted with 65 laps to go with Logano in the lead. Kevin Harvick retook the lead with 49 laps to go, before debris in turn 3 brought out the seventh caution of the race as Kenseth hit the wall with 41 laps to go. The race restarted with 35 laps to go, before more debris brought out the eighth caution of the race as A. J. Allmendinger hit the wall with 25 laps to go. Jamie McMurray exited pit road with the lead by taking just two tires, while Kyle Larson and Casey Mears were forced to drop to the tail end of the field for driving through too many pit boxes. ==Finish== Jimmie Johnson, seen here at the 2015 Daytona 500, scored his 72nd career win at Texas Motor Speedway. The race restarted with 21 laps to go. Joey Logano was bumped out of the way by Kevin Harvick in turn 1 and managed to avoid hitting the wall, but fell back to eighth in the running order. Harvick stated post-race that the incident was \\"the chance you take when you block\\" and that a driver would \\"just have to kind of knock them out of the way\\". Logano felt that the move was \\"understandable\\" and that he expected \\"to get raced the way I race people, and I would do the same thing\\". Johnson took the lead from McMurray with 14 laps to go, and was able to hold off Harvick ‚Äì who had been closing in after the Logano incident ‚Äì to score the victory. Post-race =Driver comments= In Victory Lane, Johnson reflected upon his 72nd win in the series, describing his Chevrolet as \\"a great, great racecar\\", and that it was the perfect result after the Easter break, stating that it \\"was good for us, gave us a chance to reboot, relax and get back in the swing of things\\". After his second-place finish, Harvick stated that he was \\"not disappointed at all\\", adding that \\"racing for wins is what we're here to do\\". Gordon, who gambled on the final pit stop by changing just two tires, restarted second and scored a seventh-place finish ‚Äì his best of the season. Gordon felt that he \\"struggled\\" during the race, but also praised his crew chief Alan Gustafson for a \\"great gamble\\". Truex, who had only five top ten finishes in 2014, scored his seventh top ten finish of 2015 with a ninth-place finish. Truex described the evening as \\"a hard-fought night, for sure\\" but also stated the result was \\"still a top 10, so all in all, it was a good night for us\\".

It was most recently broadcast Monday to Thursday from 4:00pm until 7:00pm, including a 15-minute break for Newsbeat at 5:45pm. The main focus of the show is music and entertainment in the form of features and celebrity interviews. The show is award-winning, achieving a Sony Radio Academy Award in 2014 for 'Best Entertainment Programme'http://radiotoday.co.uk/2014/05/2014-radio-academy-awards-full- winners/ and an ARIA in 2016 for 'Best Entertainment Production'.https://www.radioacademy.org/articles/news/arias-the-winners/ The final show aired on 19 July 2018 as James went on to present Radio 1 Breakfast. ==History== After joining BBC Radio 1 in June 2007 and presenting the early breakfast show from October 2007, on 21 September 2009, a new schedule was launched on Radio 1, and it was announced that James would move to an Early Afternoon slot; 1pm to 4pm - replacing Edith Bowman, who moved to the weekend breakfast slot. It was in this early afternoon slot that the majority of the features in the current show were formed. His early breakfast show was taken over by Dev. It was announced on 28 February 2012 that James and Scott Mills would swap shows as of 2 April 2012. James currently hosts the 'drive time' show (4‚Äì7pm) weekdays, while Mills took over the weekdays 'early afternoon' show (1‚Äì4pm).Radio 1 schedule: Scott Mills and Greg James to swap BBC Radio 1, 28 February 2012 James's drivetime show was initially produced by Laura Sayers (known as Headmistress Laura), with Sarah Underwood, and later Pippa Taylor as Assistant Producer. After Sayers left the show to go on maternity leave, she was replaced by Taylor, and new Assistant Producer Travis Walby joined. James is joined regularly by newsreader Chris Smith (referred to as Chris Smith With The News), who takes part in a number of segments during the show, when he is free of Newsbeat duties. There used to be a daily handover at 19:00 with Zane Lowe, prior to his departure from Radio 1. This tradition ended when Annie Mac took over Zane's show. Dev is the regular cover, who would also involve Smith, Taylor and Walby in the discussions, and continue some of the regular features. In June 2015, Taylor and Walby left the show; Taylor to eventually work on The Chris Moyles Show on Radio X, Walby to produce the weekend shows. Their final show was on 5 June 2015. Ian Chaloner took over producing, with Jenny Keough as assistant producer.https://uk.linkedin.com/in/keoghjennifer It was at this point that Chris Smith's involvement in the show was reduced somewhat, with him no longer participating in links and features between 4:30 and 5:45, including Nerd Alerts and Rage Against the Answer Machine, or regularly speaking to Greg after the news. He now appears only between 6:10 and 6:30 on certain days. The show has over five million listeners, and won a Sony Radio Academy Award in 2014 for 'Best Entertainment Programme'. It won silver the year before. It won the Gold for Best Entertainment Production at the ARIAS 2016. From 10 December 2012 for a week, James hosted his show from the BFBS Radio Studio in Camp Bastion, Afghanistan. Whilst in Camp Bastion, James met with a large number of troops and invited some personnel to 'shout-out' to their family and friends, and also invited celebrities to read out messages from the families of serving soldiers from the BBC Radio 1 studios in London. In the week leading up to T In the Park, Greg often takes the show to Scotland to take part in activities there. In 2012 and 2013, this was 'Sofa Surfing', where Greg would stay with listeners and take part in activities chosen by them. In 2014, he put on G In the Park, a mini-music festival from the BBC in Glasgow, with tents where he and several listeners would sleep, and music acts would play on a stage. Every night was live streamed online, on Radio 1's website and on YouTube.. On 24 October 2013, the first episode of the That's What He Said Podcast was released, featuring Greg and newsreader Chris Smith chatting about what happened on his radio show over the previous week, and playing out the highlights. This has performed well on the iTunes podcast chart. In March 2015, following changes to the global release day for singles, Radio 1 announced its own changes to the Official Chart Show. From July 2015, it will move to Friday afternoons, between 16:00 and 17:45, integrating into James' current show, with James as host. In February 2016, Greg took part in the Gregathlon for Comic Relief, in which he completed five triathlons in five days in five cities.https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3v8RPZ8GFYQhBV7x2k5FrfT/bbc- radio-1-s-gregathlon-for-sport-relief This was whilst still doing the show every day at 4pm from the city he had done the triathlon in. During this week, Alice Levine co-hosted the programme from the location. It was announced on 31 May 2018 during the Radio 1 Breakfast Show that current Breakfast Show host Nick Grimshaw would be switching shows with James in September 2018 effectively ending the Greg James show. Some features of the Greg James show will move with him to the Breakfast Show with James stating \\"There will be bits that will come with me and the spirit of the show will come with me\\". It was announced on 7 July 2018 edition of the podcast that Chris Smith would not be joining Greg on the breakfast show https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06d3v4s, ending their on-air partnership after seven years. A change.org petition was started by fans in an attempt to reverse this decision. ==Features==  Current  * Big Thursday Guest - A high-profile celebrity guest will come on the show on a Thursday. * Film Reviews - Radio 1 Movie Critic Ali Plumb, and previously Rhiannna Dhillon, review the latest releases in the cinema every Thursday. * Impossible Karaoke - Two callers go against each other with their renditions of difficult-to-sing songs. * The Official Chart Update * Rage Against the Answer Machine - People call a special phone number (03703 333 433) to rant about things that annoy them, which Greg and a guest (usually a fellow Radio 1 DJ, including the likes of Clara Amfo, Alice Levine, Annie Mac, Huw Stephens, Scott Mills, Chris Stark and Charlie Sloth) then go through on a Wednesday. This feature has created a number of running gags, including \\"I can't do a survey if it's not in the right place, Simon\\". Messages are often started by saying, \\"Do you know what really (somethings) my (something else commonly associated with something). This feature began in early 2013, and uses the song Killing In The Name by Rage Against the Machine. It used to be hosted every week by Greg and Chris Smith, but this changed to a rotation of DJs in mid-2015.\\" * Shouldn't Be News - Greg is joined by Chris Smith to go through well known facts that listeners have only recently learnt. * The Ten Minute Takeover - This feature began on the afternoon show, usually happening daily at about 15:00, and moved to the drivetime show happening straight after Newsbeat at 18:00, Monday to Thursday. Listeners contact the show requesting a song, of which three are chosen, one each from the text, Facebook and Twitter. The following criteria have to be met in order for it to be played: it must not have been played on the show already that day, and it must be in the Radio 1 computer system. This second rule has created much controversy over the years, because songs are regularly not in the system, leading Greg to criticize the 'music police', who delete songs they consider to be too old for the station. The feature is a parody of the former 'Ten Hour Takeover' request feature that used to happen on Bank Holidays. * What's My Age Again - Greg and Chris speak to three callers and ask them questions, with the objective of guessing their age. Whoever guesses the closest wins the round, and the winner is decided via the best of three. The theme tune is 'What's My Age Again' by Blink-182. * Wrong 'Uns - Introduced in August 2015, a quiz in which a caller must answer a series of questions incorrectly. Broadcast every Tuesday at 17:10. Producer Ian Chaloner takes the role of 'quiz adjudicator' and gives a score at the end of the quiz, ensuring answers are not repeated or too irrelevant for the question context. Callers are encouraged to beat the previous week's score. This feature replaced Nerd Alerts.  Recurring  These features don't happen regularly, but reappear from time to time, some more frequently than others. * Rent-A- Greg - A feature where Greg runs random errands for listeners, including driving a listener to the airport at 2:00am and acting as a receptionist in a nail salon. This first aired during the summer of 2016, and returned for the summer of 2017. * Accent or Faccent- This game involves three callers doing accents. Greg, Chris Smith or a guest must ask them three questions after which they must decide which caller(s) is/are doing a real accent (accent), and which are doing a fake accent (faccent). The theme tune is the theme tune to Keeping Up Appearances. * Just What the Doctor Ordered - Chris Smith plays the part of a doctor, who needs certain things. Greg must remember as many as he can. This feature happened only a few times, on the afternoon and drivetime show. * Lady Time (with Greg and Chris) - Ladies call up Greg and Chris to ask for advice about lady problems. Lady Time happens once a month, and the theme is \\"Lady Time, with Greg and Chris\\", sung over Jazz Talk by Doug Perkins. This has been done on many occasions with guests on the show, and on one occasion, whilst sitting in, Alice Levine hosted an edition of 'Lad Time'. * The Mayor of Where - Long running feature that began in early 2014. Greg and Chris get a mayor on the phone, and ask them five questions in order to ascertain their 'mayorabouts' and guess what town they are the mayor of. This used to happen on a Thursday, but was moved to Wednesday to create time on Thursday's show for the fired Apprentice candidates, and was never returned to its original slot. When the mayor is Scottish, the feature is renamed \\"The Provost of Wovost\\", and when a mayor is unavailable, the feature is replaced with \\"The Claire of Where\\", \\"The Clown From Which Town\\" or in December 2016, \\"The Dame From The Town Of What Name\\" when Greg and Chris had to guess which town a pantomime dame was performing in. * Talk 'Til The Cows Come Home - Two callers would compete to talk about a certain subject for as long as possible. Chris Smith With the Moos was the a-moo-dicator, who would sound a cow's moos when he believes they have run out of things to say. It is based loosely around Radio 4 comedy Just a Minute. It began in late 2014. * The Tiny Big Thursday Guest Game - On occasions where a Big Thursday Guest could not be booked, Greg and Chris play this instead. Clips from guests who have been on the show are played out, but at a higher pitch, and a caller must guess who the guest was. * North Star Caller - A variation of 'Star Caller' done at Christmas, where young children get phoned by Santa Claus (played by Chris Smith). * Tiny Celebrity Party - Chris Smith reads a story involving tiny celebrities, and Greg does their voices using a voice changer to make himself more high pitched. Tiny celebrities have included Tiny Gary Barlow, Tiny Hillary Devey, Tiny Fearne Cotton, Tiny Nick Grimshaw, and Tiny Kanye West. * Tiny Kanye's Big Quiz- Tiny Kanye West spawned his own feature. He is the host of his Big Quiz, involving questions given to a caller from him and other Tiny Celebrities.  Former  *Ask the Nation - This began on the afternoon show, and continued on the drivetime show until mid-2014, when it was replaced with Nerd Alerts. A listener would call up with a dilemma, to which they would put several options to the nation. Ten calls would then be taken, telling the listener which option to choose, or often creating solutions of their own. It used the theme music to Little Britain. *The Blunder Log - The natural successor to 'Best Bit of the Radio'. It involved Greg playing out clips of mistakes from other radio stations or TV programmes. This feature began on the drivetime show, and happened sporadically. It hasn't featured since early 2013. *Feet Up Friday - This began on the afternoon show. Two teams of listeners would come in and play games, including 'The Yes/No Game' and 'The Square' to win Feet Up Friday. When Greg moved to drivetime, the feature was reinvented so that the two teams make music choices to be played between 17:15 and 17:45, the winning team, that got to play their choices, was chosen by listener vote. This feature ended when The Official Chart occupied the Friday show. *Flash Flash - At the beginning of the Early Breakfast show, Greg would play the piece \\"In the Mood\\" by Glenn Miller, whilst singing \\"flash flash\\" to the tune and encouraging listeners to flash any lights they had available in time with the music. * The Going Home Song - A song sung every day (except Fridays due to the Official Chart) at 16:10 between June 2012 and December 2017, with three people who are going home singing to the tune of Nut Rocker by B. Bumble and the Stingers. It is often themed, for people with specific characteristics. The feature has created some controversy on Rage Against the Answer Machine, with some saying 16:10 is too early for people to be going home, to which Greg responds that they cannot do lots of different Going Home Songs throughout the whole show. In May 2016, singer Craig David recorded his own version of the Going Home Song. It ran fromm *Greg's Best Bit of the Radio From Yesterday - A daily feature on the early breakfast and afternoon shows. Greg played out a clip from another radio station that he finds amusing, usually of slip ups. On Monday, this would be Greg's Best Bit of the Radio from Friday. *Nerd Alerts - This feature began in 2014, and happens on a Tuesday. People email in to report inaccuracies (acts of nerder) spotted on TV and Radio, and Greg and Chris go through them and point them out, or at times proving the nerds to wrong. When this happens, Greg will sing the \\"Up Yours\\" song. The correspondence often causes passionate discussion amongst the nerds, with each trying to prove the last wrong. Greg has often stated that it is not a nerd hunt, but a celebration of nerds and pedantry. The theme tune is the theme from Star Wars, with Greg and/or Chris singing \\"Nerd Alerts\\" over the top. It was quietly dropped in late 2015. * Pun Pong - Greg and a caller compete to come up with the most puns on a given topic. The topic is revealed, after which they have the duration of one song to come up with the puns and must deliver them in a quickfire alternating style. Producer Ian is known as the \\"Iandependent adjudicator\\" with the occasions where he is absent filled by assistant producer Jenny. The loser is the first person to run out of puns. The theme tune is the Take Me Out theme. This replaced Star Caller on Mondays. * Secret Teacher - This feature ran from September 2012 to early 2013 on Wednesdays. Greg would hear weekly from an anonymous 'secret teacher', in her first term as a newly qualified teacher at a secondary school. She wrote a diary, detailing her embarrassing situations, and often criticized her rival 'Miss Perfect'. The feature ended after people from her school began to discover her identity. *Star Caller - The feature began on the afternoon show, and took place on Monday. A celebrity phones up someone, who has the opportunity to chat to them and ask a question. It was decided in 2015 that people being called were no longer allowed to ask for a follow on Twitter, after people complaining about it on Rage Against the Answer Machine. *The Summer Mix - An hour of upbeat, uninterrupted music mixed together from 6pm until 7pm every day. Broadcast throughout the summer holiday period of 2015, it replaced any other features usually taking place in that slot (such as the Ten Minute Takeover Monday-Thursday and Dance Anthems on a Friday). It returned in the summer of 2016 but in a modified format, so that it was only half an hour and ran from 15:45-16:15, thus only occupying fifteen minutes of Greg's show.  One Off  These features may have only appeared once or twice. * Count the Cocks - An audio montage was played out containing clips of cockerels. Greg and Chris had to count them up, with the person with the least accurate answer having to present with a live cockerel called Penny on their head, as can be seen in this video. The theme tune was the words, \\"all you have to do is count the cocks / count the little cocks\\", to the tune of 'Old Macdonald Had a Farm'. * Don't Put All Your Gregs In One Basket - This feature involved Chris Smith reading the entertainment news from a cardboard box as a forfeit, and the theme tune was the James Bond theme. It can be heard on 31 January 2014 podcast. * How's Your Father - Greg gets people on the phone and asks them how their father is. The theme tune is the Thomas the Tank Engine theme. * John Romero Thursdays - Since 5 May 2016 the Going Home song has been a special recording of accordion player and Britain's Got Talent contestant, John Romero, who played Nut Rocker for his audition on his show. It has become tradition that on Thursdays listeners will text the studio to remind Greg that they don't need participants for Friday's Going Home Song as there is no Going Home Song on a Friday (thanks to The Official Chart), and he kept incorrectly informing them this was the case by mistake. ==Parody videos== A common way in which James promotes his show is his parody videos, in which he dresses up as popular (often female) pop artists and does ridiculous parodies of their music videos. A popular recreation was of Miley Cyrus' 'Wrecking Ball'. It is one of Radio 1's most viewed YouTube videos. He has also done a version of Kiesza's 'Hideaway' and recently drove Taylor Swift around London while performing a 'lip-sync' video for her new song 'Blank Space'. In 2013, Chris Smith wrote a Christmas parody of the Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams song, Blurred Lines. Called Mulled Wines, and sung by Father Chris Smith and Pharrelf, the video featured celebrities such as Chris Martin, Fearne Cotton, Charlie Sloth, Jamie Oliver, and Jake Bugg. Zane Lowe said that if the song got more than one million views on YouTube, he would play it on his show. The video can be seen here, and the unofficial lyrics video starring Travis Walby can be seen here. ==Awards and nominations== {  - ! Year ! Ceremony ! Award !

Padi is also cited in a docket dated to 699 B.C.E., according to which he delivered a light talent of silver to Sennacherib (Fales and Postgate 1995: 21-22). Ikausu is listed as one of the 12 coastal kings who transported building materials to Nineveh for the palace of Esarhaddon (680-669 B.C.E.), and his name also appears in a list of kings who participated in Ashurbanipal's first campaign against Egypt in 667 B.C.E. (Pritchard 1969: 291, 294).\\" King Padi is mentioned in connection to events from the years 701 and 699 BC, King Ikausu in relation to 673 and 667 BC, placing the date of the inscription firmly in the first half of the 7th century BC, and most likely in the second quarter of that century. Peter James, The Date of the Ekron Temple Inscription: A Note, in Israel Exploration Journal (IEJ), vol., 55 No. 1 (2005), p. 90 It is the first connected body of text to be identified as \\"Philistine\\",Gitin, Dothan, and Naveh, 1997, p. 15, quote: \\"Until now, the inscriptions found in Philistia have contained mainly proper names; hence, the Ekron dedication is the first fluent text containing two whole phrases\\" on the basis of Ekron's identification as a Philistine city in the Bible (see and ). However, it is written in a Canaanite dialect similar to Phoenician and Old Byblian, such that its discoverers referred to it as \\"something of an enigma\\".Gitin, Dothan, and Naveh, 1997, p. 15, quote: \\"If so, one may ask why should a seventh century BCE inscription be written at Ekron in a language close to Phoenician and reminiscent of Old Byblian. Phoenician was the prestige language in the tenth and ninth century BCE. To find an inscription, however, in seventh century BCE Philistia, where a script from the Hebrew tradition was used, is something of an enigma.\\"Jaacob Callev, \\"The Canaanite Dialect of the Dedicatory Royal Inscription from Ekron\\". ==Discovery== The inscription was discovered in the Albright Institute of Archaeological Research Tel Miqne excavations of Ekron led by Seymour Gitin and Trude Dothan. The inscription is one of the primary documents for establishing the chronology of events relating to the end of the late biblical period, especially a possible late history of the Philistines. The inscription has therefore been referred to as one of the most important archaeological finds of the 20th century in Israel. ==Translation== The text is written from right-to-left in the style and dialect of Phoenician inscriptions from Byblos.Berlant, 2008, p.15, \\"According to the excavation leaders Gitin, Dothan, and Naveh, the inscription, written from right to left in a style reminiscent of tenth century b.c.e. Phoenician inscriptions from Byblos, records the temple‚Äôs dedication by Ekron‚Äôs ruler Ikausu in a West Semitic dialect resembling Phoenician and Old Byblian, apparently spoken at Ekron and perhaps other Levantine Philistine city states. some seemingly Hebrew letters, some seemingly Phoenician letters, and some letters that seem to have been unique to Ekron\\" It has been transcribed and translated as: ::ê§üê§Åê§ïê§üê§Åê§çê§üê§Äê§äê§âê§îê§üê§Åê§çê§üê§êê§Éê§âê§üê§Åê§ç ::bt¬∑bn¬∑ æky≈°¬∑bn¬∑pdy¬∑bn¬∑ ::The temple (which) he built, Achish son of Padi, son of ::ê§âê§éê§Éê§üê§Åê§çê§üê§Äê§Éê§Äê§üê§Åê§çê§üê§âê§èê§ìê§üê§îê§ìê§èê§í ::ysd¬∑bn¬∑ æd æ¬∑bn¬∑y ør¬∑≈õr øq ::Ysd, son of Ada, son of Ya'ir, ruler of Ek- ::ê§ìê§çê§üê§ãê§êê§ï[ ]ê§âê§Ñê§üê§Äê§Éê§ïê§Ñê§üê§ïê§Åê§ìê§äê§Ñê§üê§Öê§ï ::rn¬∑lpt[ ]yh¬∑ ædth¬∑tbrkh¬∑wt ::ron, for Pt[ ]yh his lady, may she bless him, and ::ê§üê§îê§å‚∏¢ê§ì‚∏£ê§Ñê§üê§Öê§ïê§Äê§ìê§äê§üê§âê§åê§Ñê§üê§Öê§ïê§Åê§ìê§ä ::≈°m‚∏¢r‚∏£h¬∑wt ærk¬∑ymh¬∑wtbrk¬∑ ::protect him, and prolong his days, and bless ::ê§Ä‚∏£ê§ì‚∏¢ê§ë‚∏£ê§Ñ‚∏£ ::‚∏¢ æ‚∏£r‚∏¢·π£‚∏£h ::his land ==Interpretation== The language and form of writing of the Ekron inscription show a significant Phoenician influence, and the name  æ-k-y-≈° is understood as Achish. The inscription contains a list of five of the kings of Ekron, fathers to sons: Ya'ir, Ada, Yasid, Padi, and Ikausu, and the name of the goddess Pt[ ]yh to whom the temple is dedicated. Padi and Ikausu are mentioned in the Neo- Assyrian Royal Annals, which provide the basis for dating their reigns to the late 8th and 7th centuries BCE. The inscription also securely identified the site by mentioning the name Ekron. The identity of \\"pt[g/r/-]yh\\" has been subject to scholarly debate, with the third letter being either a very small gimel giving \\"ptgyh\\" which could be a previously unknown deity,Berlant, 2008, p.15-16, \\"Gitin, Dothan, and Naveh went on to state that the questionable letter... is undoubtedly an ancient form of the Hebrew letter gimmel. Yet this letter would be a remarkably small gimmel, and no Semitic goddess named Ptgyh has ever been identified. Nevertheless, Gitin, Dothan, and Naveh concluded that Ptgyh was ‚Äúsurely‚Äù a previously unknown Philistine and Indo-European deity based on: (1) the presence of terminal -yh in two feminine personal names in a Philistine name list found in the excavation of Tel Jemmeh; (2) the belief that Ikausu is a form of the Greek name Anchises, Achean or both; and (3) the generally accepted belief that the Philistines were known biblically as the Caphtorim, who presumably migrated from Crete and other parts of what is now Greece to the Levant in the late second millennium b.c.e.\\" or a resh giving ptryh or \\"Pidray\\" the Semitic daughter of Baal,Berlant, 2008, p.21, \\"...G√∂rge‚Äôs suggestion that the letter may have been a resh in Ptryh, a variant of Pidray, Baal‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs name... In view of the preceding evidence and analysis, the hypothesis that the questionable letter is a resh is certainly no less founded than the hypotheses that the letter was supposed to be a nun... The resh hypothesis is also more supportable, instructive, and ultimately important than the other hypotheses because the resulting name is a highly attested Semitic and, more broadly, Afro-Asiatic word that more aptly fits the inscription‚Äôs setting. G√∂rge‚Äôs hypothesis therefore melds quite well with the hypothesis that the Ekron goddess was Pidray/Ptryh, rather than some previously unknown Semitic, much less Greek, goddess.\\" or a nun giving \\"ptnyh\\",Demsky Aaron, 1997. The Name of the Goddess of Ekron: A New Reading, JANES, 25, p. 3. \\" I therefore propose to read the word pt[n]y.h, which in Canaanite letters would represent the Greek term potni‚Äô, potnia (œÄŒøœÑŒΩŒπ', œÄŒøœÑŒΩŒπŒ±), i.e., ‚Äúmistress,‚Äù ‚Äúlady,‚Äù the formal title of various goddesses in the Minoan, Mycenean and archaic Greek writings. The root is pot, meaning ‚Äúlord, master,‚Äù as in despot. The term is found already in Myceanean documents written in Linear B dated to the 14th‚Äì12th centuries BCE, from Knossos (Crete) and Pylos (Peloponnesus)(Ventris & Chadwick, 1973). After making a search, I find that the term appears 90 times in the Homeric epics and hymns...\\"Finkelberg Margalit, (2006) Ino-Leucothea between East and West, J. of Ancient Near Eastern Religions, 6:105-121, referred in Lopez-Ruiz C., Mopsos and Cultural Exchange between Greeks and Locals in Cilicia, in Ueli Dill, Christine Walde (eds.) \\"Antike Mythen: Medien, Transformationen und Konstruktionen,\\" Walter de Gruyter, 2009, p. 497. or no letter at all giving \\"ptyh\\".Berlant, 2008, p.16-18, \\"After inspecting the questionable letter closely, however, Demsky concluded that it ‚Äúis no more than a wedge shaped chip in the porous stone,‚Äù and that Yardeni had drawn the letter‚Äôs left line ‚Äútoo concave‚Äù In addition, Demsky concluded that what Gitin, Dothan, and Naveh had interpreted and Yardeni had drawn as the letter‚Äôs right line was nothing but an unintended ‚Äúspur,‚Äù rather than a real line. On the other hand, after comparing the questionable letter to the inscription‚Äôs nuns, Demsky went on to hypothesize that the name of this deity is Ptnyh, presumably representing the Greek word potni or potnia for ‚Äúmistress‚Äù or ‚Äúlady,‚Äù in agreement with what Demsky identified as the archaic Greek practice of denoting various deities in Linear B sometimes simply as ‚ÄúMistress‚Äù or ‚ÄúLady,‚Äù and sometimes more specifically as ‚ÄúMistress or Lady So and So.‚Äù... Sch√§effer-Lichtenberger argued that, among other problems with Demsky‚Äôs hypothesis: (1) ‚Äúthere is no known example of potnia hitherto as a name‚Äù; (2) all the nuns begin at the top of lines, but the questionable letter begins six mm. below the line; (3) the letter‚Äôs left line was indeed curved, as Gitin, Dothan, and Naveh had claimed; and (4) the space available below the questionable letter would not have allowed the scribe to chisel the tail of a nun or, for that matter, a resh\\" ==Other inscriptions from Ekron== The excavations also produced 16 short inscriptions including kd≈° l‚Äô≈°rt (‚Äúdedicated to [the goddess] Asherat‚Äù), lmqm (‚Äúfor the shrine‚Äù), and the letter tet with three horizontal lines below it (probably indicating 30 units of produce set aside for tithing), and silver hoards. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * S.

It was originally developed to solve difficult package management challenges faced by Python data scientists, and today is a popular package manager for Python and R. At first part of Anaconda Python distribution developed by Anaconda Inc., it ended up being useful on its own and for things other than Python, so it was spun out as a separate package, released under the BSD license. The conda package and environment manager is included in all versions of Anaconda, Miniconda, and Anaconda Repository. Conda allows users to easily install different versions of binary software packages and any required libraries appropriate for their computing platform. Also, it allows users to switch between package versions and download and install updates from a software repository. Conda is written in the Python programming language, but can manage projects containing code written in any language (e.g., R), including multi-language projects. Conda can install Python, while similar Python-based cross-platform package managers (such as wheel or pip) cannot. The big difference between conda and the pip package manager is in how package dependencies are managed, which is a significant challenge for Python data science and the reason conda was created. Pip installs all Python package dependencies required, whether or not those conflict with other packages previously installed. So a working installation of, for example, Google TensorFlow can suddenly stop working when a user pip- installs a new package that needs a different version of the NumPy library. More insidiously, everything might still appear to work, but the user gets different results, or is unable to reproduce the same results elsewhere because the user did not pip-install in the same order. Conda analyzes the user's current environment, everything that has been installed, any version limitations that the user specifies (e.g. if the user only wants tensorflow >= 2.0) and figures out how to install compatible dependencies. Otherwise, it will tell the user that what he or she wants can't be done. Pip, by contrast, will just install the package the user specified and any dependencies, even if that breaks other packages. A popular conda channel for bioinformatics software is Bioconda, which provides multiple software distributions for computational biology.Bioconda official website. ==See also== * Anaconda (Python distribution) ==ReferencesCategory:Free package management systems Category:Software distribution Category:Free software programmed in Python ","title":"Conda (package manager)"},{"id":"46315599","text":"Henrik Leek (born 15 March 1990) is a Swedish curler.

He was notable for his rebetiko songs. He was also a songwriter and best known as a singer. == Life and career == Diamantidis was born in 1892 in the Arnavutk√∂y suburb of Istanbul (then Constantinople) in the Ottoman Empire (present-day Turkey). He took up music from an early age, learning to play both the guitar and the oud, and by 1910 he began to work professionally as a singer. Because of the unusual and stirring \\"waves\\" in his voice, he was given the nickname Dalgas (\\"ŒùœÑŒ±ŒªŒ≥Œ∫Œ¨œÇ\\" which means \\"passion\\" in Greek, and \\"ripple\\" in Turkish), by which he would be known for the rest of his professional career. In 1919, he married Argyro Nikolaou in Istanbul, with whom he had one daughter, Anna. From 1920 to 1922, he and his band entertained Greek immigrants to America on the ocean liner \\"King Alexandros.\\" It was during one of these voyages that he learned of the Catastrophe in Asia Minor, and he afterwards settled permanently in Greece with his family, first in Piraeus and later in Petralona. In the early years, he worked as a singer and musician in various caf√©s featuring Smyrneiko, Rebetiko and Laiko music. Among his associates at the time were Costas Tzovenos, Dimitrios Semsis, Kostas Karipis and Spyros Peristeris. During this time he also began to compose his own music. Between 1926 and 1933, he recorded more than 400 traditional and rebetiko songs, primarily under the His Master's Voice label. His vocal abilities were unprecedented, and as a result of his talent he emerged as one of the most lauded of his era, alongside other \\"manes\\" performers like Costas Nouri and Vangeli Sofroniou. After 1933, he stopped appearing as a musician, and largely disappeared from recording, preferring live performances in exclusive venues, and focusing on a lighter genre of popular romantic songs. His main partner in this era was Mark Philandros, who later married his daughter Anna. From 1937 to 1939, Dalgas made a brief reappearance in the music industry as a composer, recording a small number of songs, and he continued to perform until 1941. With the arrival of the Germans in Athens, however, Dalgas sunk into a deep depression, and he eventually died under mysterious circumstances in early 1945. == See also == * Oud * Rebetiko * Laiko * Greek music == References  Notes == # Then autonomous, subject to the Ottoman Empire Category:1892 births Category:Greek singers Category:Greek male singers Category:Constantinopolitan Greeks Category:Greek songwriters Category:Greek music Category:Rebetiko musicians Category:Turkish people of Greek descent Category:Greek guitarists Category:1945 deaths Category:Singers of the Ottoman Empire Category:Greeks of the Ottoman Empire Category:20th-century Greek singers Category:Greek rebetiko singers Category:20th-century guitarists Category:20th-century male singers ","title":"Antonis Diamantidis"},{"id":"46315763","text":"Ticket of Leave is a 1936 British crime film directed by Michael Hankinson and starring Dorothy Boyd, John Clements and George Merritt.

The novel, published in 1985, narrated the dilemma of a village young girl who must choose between three suitors, who is deflowered and agonizes about her secret being discovered on her wedding night. Scholar Wendy Griswold classifies The Virgin as a \\"village novel\\", a book that deals with the mores of a traditional Nigerian village, in the same vein as some works by Chinua Achebe. __NOTOC__ ==Plot== A girl from a Yoruba village is engaged to a hunter from another village. Having been seduced by a man returning to the village from his life in a Nigerian city, she nervously awaits her wedding night. ==Background== Adebowale is considered a member of the \\"third generation\\" of Nigerian authors, whose works generally deal with more cosmopolitan themes than earlier generations of Nigerian writers. However, unlike other members of the \\"third generation\\", Adebowale's work deals with rural life in Nigeria, particularly life in small villages. The Virgin is an example of one such work; Adebowale believes that Nigerian writers and artists have a duty to examine and reflect on traditional Nigerian life. ==Film adaptation== Tunde Kelani wrote the screenplay and directed a 95-minute film version, titled The Narrow Path, filmed and released on May 12, 2006. The film starred Sola Asedeko, Ayo Badmus and Khabirat Kafidipe while the sound track was written and produced by Beautiful Nubia. The film was edited by Mumin Wale Kelani and Frank Efe Patrick and the costume was designed by Abiola Atanda Much of the dialogue and narration is taken directly from the novel.

Almost two months later, he returned via the Victorian Football League (VFL), collecting 24 disposals and kicking 4 goals against the Northern Blues. During the season, De Goey re-signed with Collingwood for another two years, turning down multi-year, multi-million contract offers from North Melbourne and from St Kilda.

It is approximately long and flows through Ransom Township and Scranton. The watershed of the creek has an area of . It is considered to be a Coldwater Fishery and contains trout. However, it loses flow to underground mine pools. Land uses in its watershed include forests, open space, and industrial land. A county park known as McDade Park is in the stream's vicinity. ==Course== Lucky Run begins on Bald Mountain in Ransom Township. It flows down the mountain in a south- southeast direction for several tenths of a mile before turning southeast. After several tenths of a mile, it enters Scranton, crosses Interstate 476, and leaves Bald Mountain behind. For the next several tenths of a mile, it flows southeast near the border between Scranton and Taylor. The stream then turns east for a short distance before turning south. After a few hundred feet, it reaches its confluence with Keyser Creek. Lucky Run joins Keyser Creek upstream of its mouth. ==Hydrology== In 2006, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission either applied for or received a permit to discharge stormwater into Lucky Run for construction purposes. There is one stormwater detention facility in the watershed. The stream receives runoff from the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Lucky Run lacks any perennial flow because it loses flow to underground mine pools. For this reason, it is unlikely to attain its designated uses. In 2013, it was recommended that the stream be assessed for flow loss. ==Geography, geology, and climate== The elevation near the mouth of Lucky Run is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between above sea level. Lucky Run has a steep gradient. In its upper reaches, on West Mountain/Bald Mountain, the stream has a gradient of approximately per mile. However, in the relatively flat Keyser Valley, its gradient decreases to a mere per mile. A mountain known as West Mountain/Bald Mountain is partially in the watershed of Lucky Run. This mountain has an elevation of above sea level and is part of the Allegheny Front. The stream has a shallow streambank that has been restored with concrete and stone. It flows through ten pipes whose diameters range from . The headwaters of Lucky Run are in springs and wetlands on Bald Mountain. One reach of the stream flows over land that has been heavily strip mined. A reach of it was removed by strip mining in the 1940s, but a rock-lined channel was constructed for the stream in the 1970s. In 2001, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan recommended that the stream channel of Lucky Run be restored from McDade Park downstream to its mouth. At that time, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation was near to completing a project involving sealing of the stream's streambed to prevent infiltration into a mine pool. On 45 percent of Lucky Run, an impervious surface was observed. There is substantial tree debris rerouting the stream and parts of it experience erosion. In early May 2013, the temperature in the vicinity of Lucky Run was measured to be . ==Watershed== The watershed of Lucky Run has an area of . A large area of the watershed is in Ransom Township and smaller areas are in Scranton and Taylor. The watershed is in the southwestern part of the Lackawanna River watershed. The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Scranton. Lucky Run is a first-order tributary of Keyser Creek. The part of its watershed that is on West Mountain/Bald Mountain is mainly forested. Other land uses in the watershed include open space and industrial land. The stream's mouth is at an industrial park known as Stauffer Industrial Park. Major roads and bridges in the watershed include Keyser Avenue and Park Edge Lane. ==History== Lucky Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1199095. A culvert under Keyser Avenue in the watershed of Lucky Run was repaired in 2013 and 2014. ==Biology== Wild trout naturally reproduce in Lucky Run from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. The creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery. The riparian area of Lucky Run has sparse areas of trees. It consists of forested land and grassland. The stream's bank is covered with knotweed. ==Recreation== A county park known as McDade Park is in the watershed of Lucky Run. It was established in the 1970s. In 2001, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan proposed a trail and greenway linking the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail to McDade Park via the stream corridors of Lucky Run and Keyser Creek. Additionally, the Lackawanna Coal Mine Tour site is in the stream's vicinity. ==See also== *Lindy Creek, next tributary of Keyser Creek going upstream *List of rivers of Pennsylvania ==References *Google Street View image of Lucky Run Category:Rivers of Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania Category:Tributaries of the Lackawanna River Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania ","title":"Lucky Run"},{"id":"46315999","text":"is a professional Japanese ice hockey player for Vortex Sapporo and the Japanese national team.

In the simulation of mixtures, the choice of combining rules can sometimes affect the outcome of the simulation. ==Combining rules for the Lennard-Jones potential== The Lennard-Jones Potential is a mathematically simple model for the interaction between a pair of atoms or molecules. One of the most common forms is : : V_{LJ} = 4\\\\varepsilon \\\\left[ \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{r}\\\\right)^{12} - \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{r}\\\\right)^{6} \\\\right] where Œµ is the depth of the potential well, œÉ is the finite distance at which the inter-particle potential is zero, r is the distance between the particles. The potential reaches a minimum, of depth Œµ, when r = 21/6œÉ ‚âà 1.122œÉ. Lorentz-Berthelot rules The Lorentz rule was proposed by H. A. Lorentz in 1881: :\\\\sigma_{ij} = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{ii} + \\\\sigma_{jj}}{2} The Lorentz rule is only analytically correct for hard sphere systems. Intuitively, since \\\\sigma_{i}, \\\\sigma_{j} loosely reflect the radii of particle i and j respectively, their averages can be said to be the effective radii between the two particles at which point repulsive interactions become severe. The Berthelot rule (Daniel Berthelot, 1898) is given by:Daniel Berthelot \\"Sur le m√©lange des gaz\\", Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des s√©ances de l‚ÄôAcad√©mie des Sciences, 126 pp. 1703-1855 (1898) :\\\\epsilon_{ij} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon_{ii} \\\\epsilon_{jj}}. Physically, this arises from the fact that \\\\epsilon is related to the induced dipole interactions between two particles. Given two particles with instantaneous dipole \\\\mu_i, \\\\mu_j respectively, their interactions correspond to the products of \\\\mu_i, \\\\mu_j. An arithmetic average of \\\\epsilon_i and \\\\epsilon_j will not however, result in the average of the two dipole products, but the average of their logarithms would be. These rules are the most widely used and are the default in many molecular simulation packages, but are not without failings. Waldman-Hagler rules The Waldman-Hagler rules are given by: :r_{ij}^0 = \\\\left( \\\\frac{ (r_i^0)^6 + (r_j^0)^6 }{2} \\\\right)^{1/6} and :\\\\epsilon_{ij} = 2 \\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon_i \\\\cdot \\\\epsilon_j} \\\\left( \\\\frac{ (r_i^0)^3 \\\\cdot (r_j^0)^3 }{ (r_i^0)^6 + (r_j^0)^6 } \\\\right) Fender-Halsey The Fender-Halsey combining rule is given by :\\\\epsilon_{ij} = \\\\frac{2 \\\\epsilon_i \\\\epsilon_j}{\\\\epsilon_i + \\\\epsilon_j} Kong rules The Kong rules for the Lennard-Jones potential are given by: :\\\\epsilon_{ij}\\\\sigma_{ij}^{6}=\\\\left(\\\\epsilon_{ii}\\\\sigma_{ii}^{6}\\\\epsilon_{jj}\\\\sigma_{jj}^{6}\\\\right)^{1/2} : \\\\epsilon_{ij}\\\\sigma_{ij}^{12} = \\\\left[ \\\\frac{ (\\\\epsilon_{ii}\\\\sigma_{ii}^{12})^{1/13} \\\\+ (\\\\epsilon_{jj}\\\\sigma_{jj}^{12})^{1/13} }{2} \\\\right]^{13} Others Many others have been proposed, including those of Tang and Toennies Pena, Hudson and McCoubrey and Sikora (1970). ==Combining rules for other potentials== Good-Hope rule The Good-Hope rule for Mie‚ÄìLennard‚ÄêJones or Buckingham potentials is given by: :\\\\sigma_{ij} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma_{ii} \\\\sigma_{jj}} Hogervorst rules The Hogervorst rules for the Exp-6 potential are: :\\\\epsilon_{12} = \\\\frac{2 \\\\epsilon_{11} \\\\epsilon_{22}}{\\\\epsilon_{11} + \\\\epsilon_{22}} and :\\\\alpha_{12}=\\\\frac{1}{2} (\\\\alpha_{11} + \\\\alpha_{22}) Kong-Chakrabarty rules The Kong-Chakrabarty rules for the Exp-6 potential are: :\\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_{12}\\\\alpha_{12} e^{\\\\alpha_{12}}}{(\\\\alpha_{12}-6)\\\\sigma_{12}} \\\\right]^{2\\\\sigma_{12}/\\\\alpha_{12}}= \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_{11}\\\\alpha_{11} e^{\\\\alpha_{11}}}{(\\\\alpha_{11}-6)\\\\sigma_{11}} \\\\right]^{\\\\sigma_{11}/\\\\alpha_{11}} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_{22}\\\\alpha_{22} e^{\\\\alpha_{22}}}{(\\\\alpha_{22}-6)\\\\sigma_{22}} \\\\right]^{\\\\sigma_{22}/\\\\alpha_{22}} :\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{12}}{\\\\alpha_{12}}= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{11}}{\\\\alpha_{11}} + \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{22}}{\\\\alpha_{22}} \\\\right) and :\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_{12}\\\\alpha_{12}\\\\sigma_{12}^6}{(\\\\alpha_{12}-6)} = \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_{11}\\\\alpha_{11}\\\\sigma_{11}^6}{(\\\\alpha_{11}-6)} \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_{22}\\\\alpha_{22}\\\\sigma_{22}^6}{(\\\\alpha_{22}-6)} \\\\right]^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} Other rules for that have been proposed for the Exp-6 potential are the Mason-Rice rules and the Srivastava and Srivastava rules (1956). ==Equations of state== Industrial equations of state have similar mixing and combining rules.

The primary goal of their mission is to collect information and monitor enemy satellites, which he and Vollmer must report back to Colorado Command. The narrator also reveals that, while this is his third orbital mission, it is Vollmer's first. He believes that having been in space for so long, and therefore gaining a different perspective on the planet, has changed Vollmer. The narrator acknowledges that the same changes have occurred in him, and that they are likely impossible to avoid - describing the experience of orbiting the Earth as a 'privileged vista', he admits that one cannot help but gain a universal feeling and in turn dwell on the human condition. Vollmer is described as 23 years old, and having many personal effects. The narrator, on the other hand, only carries a 1901 vintage coin. He ponders whether Vollmer's parents imparted so many possessions on him for the journey out of fear that the orbital mission would lack 'human moments', which the narrator uses as a jumping off point to describe activities and things aboard that characterize the aforementioned term. The hammocks, shipboard diet, slippers, and football jerseys are all items and practices which the narrator uses to exemplify this. While contrasting their routine on the mission with the routine of a typical Sunday back home on Earth, they are forced to inspect potential laser activity in an orbital section code-named \\"Dolores\\". While doing this, the narrator thinks about how, despite having been pulled from the natural waking/sleeping rhythm of day and night on Earth, Vollmer still speaks within its terms. It is at this point that the narrator also reveals how Vollmer seems to annoy him on a fundamental level, describing Vollmer's voice as 'stupid' and a 'grave, naked bass'. When Vollmer tries to start conversations about wide-spanning or deep subject matter, he attempts to redirect the conversation to something more mundane or routine. Through their conversations, it is revealed that the war has only been going on for three weeks. Vollmer senses that there is a lack of satisfaction, a fatigue with the war on Earth, and this is what unnerves the narrator more than anything else: while he does not share such opinions out loud, Vollmer's convictions about society and their situation are often the same as his. Unlike Vollmer, the narrator chooses to not share such thoughts out of fear. The narrator then begins a stream of consciousness regarding the nature of war, which he harkens to a form of longing in itself, a 'human moment'. His further conversations with Vollmer after docking for supplies elaborate this idea, as Vollmer describes the ideal that war should be a unifying force, giving a group of people a common sense of destiny; the narrator then poses the question of what happens when such a shared crisis dwindles sooner than anyone could have thought, reflecting once again his underlying fear of Vollmer's ideas. While receiving transmissions from Colorado Command, a faint, strangely familiar signal punctures the communications and sends the narrator into another series of self-reflecting thoughts. Colorado Command assures the narrator that it's probably just 'selective noise', but the narrator insists that he has heard a voice. Colorado Command claims it's a weather report from another component of their geosynchronous orbital systems, and the narrator is advised to disregard it. Ten hours later, Vollmer hears not just one, but multiple voices through the signal, and manages to identify vague references as well as the sound of human laughter coming through his headset. The narrator realizes that these are shows, interviews, music, and ads - radio signals from decades prior to their time period. The narrator then observes landmasses on the surface below, listing them off aloud. Vollmer remarks that the best thing science does is \\"name the features of the world,\\" which sends the narrator into a spiral of thoughts regarding his fear of Vollmer's 'human' insights. As the narrator is a self-admitted specialist (actually meaning someone who doesn't specialize in a given field in Colorado Command's context), he doesn't have the specific knowledge or degrees that Vollmer does, which makes him more frustrated when Vollmer indulges in non-scientific wonderment at the Earth instead of sticking to his routine system checks. When Vollmer proclaims, \\"I'm happy,\\" the narrator fills with rage, wondering how someone could possibly be happy in their situation. The narrator's bleak view of the human condition has worn out his sense of optimism, something that Vollmer's absolute feelings of well- being only intensify for him. As the narrator describes laser technology, along with its clean lethality, he asserts that the reason two men (in this case Vollmer and himself) are tasked with the job of operating one must come from this horror at the destructive technology that man has created. As he phrases it, \\"Fear of the power of light, pure stuff of the universe.\\" Now Vollmer and the narrator sit at their respective control panels, which are placed back-to-back with one another (a means of ensuring that the tics or anxieties of one man do not inhibit the decision-making of the other). As the two men count down to fire, thoughts of devastation and horror on Earth cross the narrator's mind. Within the same cycle of thoughts, however, is a sense of satisfaction for the narrator at having a life based around a series of specific steps and commands. He wonders if this sense of pleasure is almost an independent being unto itself, and confesses that such pleasure is a source of shame for him. While preparing to fire, Vollmer asks the narrator if he has ever experienced a sense of well-being so powerful that it became a sort of blissful arrogance, a sense of superiority over others simply felt through one's life energy. Non-verbally, the narrator admits that he has felt such emotions. Vollmer continues by describing the fragility of such a feeling, that if one thing goes wrong humans can be reduced to a sense of despair and hopelessness (the narrator again agrees silently). Their station then floats over the Missouri River towards the lakes of Minnesota. Vollmer is filled with excitement (Minnesota being his home), and begins poring over the maps trying to confirm. He also talks at great length about his childhood memories, as the narrator thinks to himself that Minnesota is yet another 'human moment'. They continue to listen to the ghost signals of old radio programs as they prepare to make a quantum burn. Vollmer observes the variety of harsh climates and weather patterns on the surface and wonders how humans can persevere and survive under such harsh conditions. The narrator thinks about how, when Vollmer forgets the war, he himself becomes a 'human moment'. The narrator is then pulled out of his trance upon remembering that, now in a time of war, there is no place for such human moments to occur. The absolution of meaning through death in war has replaced everyday life for the two, and (as the narrator observes) is beginning to change Vollmer's outlook. Vollmer (he believes) is close to inferring that life on Earth was a unique mistake, and that we are in fact alone in the universe (once again, his thinking is a product of wartime). The narrator wonders if such an idea is true, or if humans project their attitudes about their own existence into the cosmos - in which case the spirit of a given generation is all that determines such universal assertions. Vollmer's patience with Colorado Command begins to wane, and the narrator finds himself (despite agreeing with many of Vollmer's qualms) increasingly irritated with his companion. He wonders if it has something to do with his seniority over Vollmer, or if it is simply Vollmer's voice that is getting to him. Eventually, however, Vollmer becomes completely withdrawn and non-verbal, doing all routines and checklists at the window while gazing out over the Earth. The narrator describes how every single anxiety, desire, and philosophical debate within Vollmer has been satisfied by his place above the Earth now, ending with Vollmer saying, \\"It's just so interesting... the colors and all.\\" The story leaves us with the narrator repeating the phrase in his mind. ==References== Category:1983 short stories Category:Works by Don DeLillo ","title":"Human Moments in World War III"},{"id":"46316059","text":"is a Japanese ice hockey player for G√∂teborg HC of the Swedish Women's Hockey League (SDHL) and the Japanese national team.

Its mission was to repair environmental damage caused by abandoned mine lands, acid mine drainage, and other issues associated with historic mining. The operation began around the time that the Land and Water Conservation and Reclamation Act was passed and became inactive in the 1970s due to a lack of funding. During the operation, a total of $141,000,000 was spent on a variety of tasks, including remedying pollution in hundreds of streams, extinguishing dozens of mine fires, and constructing acid mine drainage treatment plants. Numerous reports on mining-impacted streams were produced during the operation, many of which continue to be used for assessing watersheds. ==Background== On May 16, 1967, voters in Pennsylvania approved a $500 million bond issue for the purpose of resolving environmental problems. In 1968, Pennsylvania passed the Land and Water Conservation and Reclamation Act, which was the first act in the United States concerning abandoned mine reclamation. It was this act that led to the formation of Operation Scarlift to repair damage caused by abandoned mines. A chunk of the money from the $500 million bond issue was used to fund the operation. Operation Scarlift is so-named because of its mission to remove the \\"scars\\" left by historical mining activities in Pennsylvania. ==Operations== The purpose of Operation Scarlift was to remedy the environmental damage that historic mining in Pennsylvania has caused to the land, water, and air. The operation carried out abandoned mine reclamation projects. These projects addressed such environmental issues as abandoned strip mines, open underground mine shafts, burning refuse banks, mine fires, identifying and gathering data on acid mine drainage sites across Pennsylvania. The operation built a series of lime neutralization stations to remedy acid mine drainage. Additionally, it produced dozens of studies on mining-impacted areas, including watersheds and mine complexes. These reports were created between 1968 and 1982. The actions taken by Operation Scarlift used a total of $141,000,000. It used the money to carry out 500 stream pollution abatement projects, eliminate 150 areas of mine subsidence, extinguish 75 mine fires, and alleviate air pollution at 30 burning refuse banks. Between 1968 and 1981, approximately $78,000,000 were spent on remedying stream pollution and approximately $64,000,000 was spent on the other tasks carried out by the operation. By 1976, of streams had been made free of pollution by the operation and another had had their pollution levels reduced. A total of 32 deep mine complexes were sealed and were reclaimed. Operation Scarlift was first administered by the Department of Mines and Mineral Industries. Later, that role passed to the Pennsylvania Department Environmental Resources (now known as the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection). Operation Scarlift became inactive in the 1970s after using up all the money provided by its revenue bond. Stream pollution remedies Operation Scarlift had two main methods for remedying stream pollution by acid mine drainage. These methods were source correction and treatment. Source correction methods in deep mines included deep mine sealing and reducing the flow of surface water into deep mines. The operation also carried out various source correction procedures on strip mines and refuse banks. Where source correction was impractical, treatment was used instead. Treatment sometimes used lime or limestone and was successful at reducing acidity and iron concentrations. However, due to the high cost involved, the operation rarely attempted to treat high sulfate concentrations except when remedying pollution in sources of potable water. Nevertheless, several chemical treatment plants were constructed, and were largely successful. However, several were shut down due to the high cost involved in maintaining them. In the 1980s, some of the remaining funds were used to attempt to construct passive treatment systems such as aerobic and anaerobic wetlands and ponds. However, these systems were mostly ineffective. ==Aftermath== While Operation Scarlift was underway, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection periodically created updates on the status of the operation. These updates were known as Bond Issue Report and the last one was published in 1990. It serves as a historical summary of the operation's work. Operation Scarlift has been described as achieving \\"limited success\\" with acid mine drainage abatement. Despite being several decades old, the information in the reports produced by Operation Scarlift \\"still provides much valuable background information for groups assessing their watershed\\", as described by the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Clearinghouse. A number of the reports on mining-impacted watersheds \\"remain the best descriptions and outlines of the AMD problems in the watersheds\\". The reports were scanned and digitized in the 2000s. ==See also== *Environmental impact of mining *Quakake Tunnel - subject of an Operation Scarlift report ==References *Example Operation Scarlift report (for Catawissa Creek) *Video on Operation Scarlift Category:Government programs Category:Environmental mitigation Category:1960s in Pennsylvania Category:1970s in Pennsylvania ","title":"Operation Scarlift"},{"id":"46316167","text":"is a Japanese ice hockey player for Toyota Cygnus and the Japanese national team.

He attended Princeton University, graduating in 1880. He received his medical degree from New York University School of Medicine in 1883, and studied at Heidelberg, Berlin and Vienna before returning to the U.S. in 1887.Conant (2013), pp. 22‚àí24. ==Career== He was a leading expert on heart and lung diseases and was a contributor to several medical journals and the author of a number of treatises on diseases. Loomis was professor of pathology at New York University from 1887 to 1895, visiting physician at the New York Hospital in 1896, and consulting pathologist of the New York Board of Health in 1897.

In the summer of 1907, Loomis's wife filed suit for divorce, claiming that Emilie Grigsby (an heiress of the estate of Charles T. Yerkes) had a relationship with Loomis. The family were snubbed socially as a result, since a divorce was regarded as a shameful event. He died of pneumonia on December 22, 1907 at his home in Manhattan before the divorce went through.

The event served as the opening round of the 2015 World Endurance Championship; it was fourth running of the event as part of the championship. The No. 17 Porsche 919 Hybrid of Timo Bernhard, Brendon Hartley and Mark Webber qualified in pole position by setting the fastest lap in class. They led for the opening 80 minutes until they suffered a terminal rear drivetrain failure, allowing the sister No. 18 team of Marc Lieb, Neel Jani and Romain Dumas into first position. Thereafter, the crew of the No. 18 Porsche battled the No. 7 Audi R18 e-tron quattro of Andr√© Lotterer, Marcel F√§ssler and Beno√Æt Tr√©luyer for the lead throughout much of the event. Although the No. 7 tean took a 10-second stop-and-go penalty for a track limits transgression in the final 14 minutes, they finished first to achieve Lotterer, F√§ssler and Tr√©luyer's ninth overall career victory in a record-breaking distance of 201 laps. Lieb, Dumas and Jani finished second and the No. 1 Toyota TS040 Hybrid of S√©bastien Buemi, Kazuki Nakajima and Anthony Davidson was third.

Their teammates Mike Conway, St√©phane Sarrazin and Alexander Wurz were fourth on 12 points, and Lo√Øc Duval, Lucas di Grassi and Oliver Jarvis were fifth with 10 points. Audi took the early lead of the Manufacturers' Championship with 35 points, seven points ahead of Toyota in second; the third-placed manufacturer Porsche had scored 19 points with seven rounds left in the season. ==Background== Entry list Oliver Jarvis (pictured in 2009) took the place of nine-time 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Tom Kristensen. A total of 29 cars were officially entered for the 6 Hours of Silverstone with most of the entries in the Le Mans Prototype 1 (LMP1) and Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) classes. The 2014 race winners, Toyota, returned to defend their title. Three manufacturers, Porsche, Toyota and Audi Sport Team Joest, were represented in LMP1 by two cars each. Team ByKolles were the sole LMP1 privateer team partaking in the race. Nissan were scheduled to debut two GT-R LM Nismos at the circuit but decided to forego the first two rounds after issues with the car during testing. The team decided to focus on making its debut at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Similarly, Rebellion Racing signed a contract to run Advanced Engine Research V6 twin-turbocharged engines instead of Toyota V8s they had used since 2012. This prompted the team to withdraw from the first two races so they and chassis developer Oreca could modify the R-Ones to accomdate the new engine. After the retirement of nine- time 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Tom Kristensen, Audi internally promoted Oliver Jarvis to the squad. ByKolles's Simon Trummer was stranded in Switzerland due to a French air traffic control strike, and Christian Klien was contacted on the day of the first practice session to take his place. LMP2 consisted of 8 cars with 27 drivers in 4 different types of chassis. Defending LMP2 champions SMP Racing and driver Sergey Zlobin opted not to return, instead focusing on the European Le Mans Series (ELMS) to develop their new BR01 chassis. 2013 class champions OAK Racing returned to the World Endurance Championship (WEC) under their own banner for team owner and driver Jacques Nicolet. Their G-Drive Racing team, which won four races in 2014, expanded to two-cars for 2015. All three entries used the Ligier JS P2-Nissan. KCMG also remained in the WEC for 2015, replacing their Oreca 03R with the newer 05 car. Strakka Racing, who had filed a full-season entry in 2014 but failed to race after development delays with their Strakka-Dome S103 car, returned for 2015 with an unchanged programme. David Brabham (pictured in 2007) replaced Johannes van Overbeek who injured his rib due to a coughing fit. Defending ELMS champions Signatech, who previously participated in 2012, had backing from Alpine with their Oreca-based A450 chassis with Nissan power. Morand Racing also shifted from the ELMS, partnering with the Japanese firm SARD in a joint effort. The team initially entered two improved Morgan LMP2 cars with Judd engines but problems with a sale to data encryption company Kairos meant the team missed the event. Extreme Speed Motorsports (ESM) was the series' sole North American-representative, moving from the United SportsCar Championship to the WEC, with their twoHPD ARX-03bs after a pre-season testing issue forced them to discard the newer 04 chassis. One of their drivers Johannes van Overbeek injured his rib due to a coughing fit the week before and was replaced by 2009 Le Mans co-winner David Brabham. The Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance Professional (LMGTE Pro) field consisted of three manufacturers (Aston Martin, Ferrari and Porsche), while Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance Amateur (LMGTE Am) included six teams: Aston Martin Racing, AF Corse, Larbre Comp√©tition, Dempsey-Racing Proton, Porsche Team Manthley, and SMP Racing. Three-time LMGTE champions AF Corse's Ferraris had a near identical line-up, and Porsche Team Manthey also kept the drivers for its two cars largely unchanged. Aston Martin Racing expanded their effort to three cars for 2015 after partner Young Driver's entry, which won the LMGTE Am category in 2014, moved to the Pro class. They again fielded two cars in the LMGTE Am class. AF Corse also remained in the category, downgrading from a two-cars to one. Porsche added a second car for Manthey Racing. 2012 LMGTE Am Teams' champions Larbre Comp√©tition returned to the series for the first time in two years, campaigning the first customer Chevrolet Corvette C7.R. Preview A FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting in Doha on 3 December 2014 confirmed the 6 Hours of Silverstone as part of the FIA WEC's 2015 schedule. It was the first of eight endurance sports car races of the 2015 FIA World Endurance Championship, and the fourth running of the event as part of the championship. It was held on 12 April 2015 at the 18-turn Silverstone Circuit in Northamptonshire, England, following two days of practice and qualifying. Since the 2013 edition, the overall winners have been presented with the RAC Tourist Trophy. Audi's head of motorsport Wolfgang Ullrich said the manufacturer was ready for the upcoming season, and noted the closeness of the competition while setting Audi the objective to win at Silverstone for the third time in the WEC: \\"At the Prologue at Le Castellet, we met with our opponents for the first time in the 2015 season and were able to see everyone is thoroughly prepared ‚Äì even though nobody put their cards on the table there.\\" Romain Dumas, one of three drivers of the No. 18 Porsche 919 Hybrid, expected more of a battle with his rivals than in 2014. His co-driver Marc Lieb said there was \\"a score to settle\\" after retiring early from the 2014 edition. Defending series champions S√©bastien Buemi and Anthony Davidson along with their co-driver Kazuki Nakajima revealed their aim of repeating their victory at Silverstone, but Buemi noted the unpredictability of the conditions at the track. Going into the race, the sport's governing body, the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile, and the organiser of the series, Automobile Club de l'Ouest, altered the balance of performance in the LMGTE classes for the first time in the season to try to create parity. of ballast was added to the LMGTE Pro class Ferrari 458 Italia and the Aston Martin V8 Vantage to reduce their handing abilities. The weight of the Porsche 911 RSR was lowered by to increase its performance. The Aston Martin V8 Vantage also received an decrease in performance with the reduction of its air restrictor by . No changes were made to the Chevrolet Corvette C7.R. ==Practice== Beno√Æt Tr√©luyer (pictured in 2013) set the fastest overall lap in all the three practice sessions. Three practice sessions‚Äîtwo on Friday and a third on Saturday‚Äîwere held before the Sunday race. The Friday afternoon and early evening sessions lasted 90 minutes; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. The first session was held in sunny weather and most of the best efforts from the drivers came in its opening minutes. Lucas di Grassi set the fastest lap in the No. 8 Audi at 1 minute, 42.291 seconds, 0.144 seconds faster than Mark Webber's No. 17 Porsche. Andr√© Lotterer in Audi's No. 7 vehicle was third, and Neel Jani was fourth in the sister Porsche. The fastest Toyota was fifth after a lap from Alexander Wurz. Gustavo Yacam√°n led LMP2 in G-Drive Racing's No. 28 Ligier JS P2-Nissan car with a lap of 1 minute, 50.213 seconds, 0.053 seconds quicker than teammate Sam Bird. The No. 95 Aston Martin V8 Vantage driven by Nicki Thiim was quickest early on in LMGTE Pro. Klaus Bachler in the No. 88 Abu Dhabi-Proton Racing Porsche 911 RSR led in LMGTE Am. Jarvis in the Audi No. 8 car led the second session early on before teammate Beno√Æt Tr√©luyer's sister No. 7 entry ended as the fastest driver with a best time of the day at 1 minute, 41.526 seconds. Jarvis's lap was 0.298 seconds slower putting the No. 8 car second overall. Brendon Hartley was the best of the Porsches in third and his teammate Dumas was fourth. The two Toyotas of St√©phane Sarrazin and Nakajima were fifth and sixth. The pair of G-Drive Racing Ligiers were again fastest in LMP2 with Pipo Derani going quickest of the day with a 1 minute, 48.676 seconds lap, and Bird being six-tenths of a second slower. The two Porsche Team Manthey cars of Richard Lietz (No. 91) and Fr√©d√©ric Makowiecki (No. 92) led LMGTE Pro. Pedro Lamy's No. 98 Aston Martin recorded the fastest lap in LMGTE Am. The third (and final) practice session was held in damp weather. Buemi and Wurz's Toyotas were the early pace setters until Marcel F√§ssler's No. 7 Audi went faster as some cars went off the slippery track and into Copse corner's gravel trap. A dry line began to appear after 25 minutes. The fastest overall leaders laps fell by five seconds as Lotterer improved on co-driver F√§ssler's time. Nelson Panciatici necessitated the showing of localised full course yellow flags when he spun and beached the No. 36 Signatech Alpine in the gravel trap at Stowe corner with 12 minutes to go. After practice restarted, Lotterer set the fastest overall lap at 1 minute, 52.094 seconds in the final minutes. Nakajima was the fastest of the two Toyotas in second, and Porsches teammates Lieb and Timo Bernhard were third and fourth. Derani set a late lap of 2 minutes, 5.786 seconds to go fastest in LMP2, followed by Matthew Howson's No. 47 KCMG Oreca 05. Makowiecki put the No. 92 Porsche atop of LMGTE Pro, as the fastest LMGTE Am lap came from Emmanuel Collard's AF Corse No. 83 Ferrari 458 Italia. ==Qualifying== Brendon Hartley helped put the No. 17 Porsche 919 Hybrid on pole position in qualifying. Saturday's afternoon qualifying session was divided into two 20 minute groups. Cars in LMGTE Pro and AM were sent out first before LMP1 and LMP2 entries. All cars were required to have two drivers set one timed lap each and their fastest average lap times determined the starting order. The fastest team and drivers earned one point towards their respective championships. Webber in the No. 17 Porsche set a benchmark 1 minute, 39.908 seconds lap, which his co-driver Hartley improved on in clear air, with a 1 minute, 39.634 seconds time. The team claimed pole position with a two-lap average of 1 minute, 39.721 seconds. They were joined on the grid's front row by their teammates Jani and Dumas who were 0.619 seconds slower. Dumas attributed the No. 18 car's slower pace to him making an error on his first lap and being delayed by slower traffic on his next try. Di Grassi and Jarvis put the No. 8 Audi just 0.012 seconds behind the slower Porsche in third. The fastest Toyota was the No. 1 car of Davidson and Nakajima in fourth after Nakajima lost time in slower traffic in the final third of the lap. The third row was shared by Lotterer and F√§ssler's No. 7 Audi in fifth. Sarrazin and Mike Conway's No. 2 Toyota qualified sixth. The LMP1 manufacturer field was close together as the first six were separated by almost two seconds. The crew of the No. 4 ByKolles Racing car were more than ten seconds slower than the manufacturer field and were the final LMP1 qualifiers. In LMP2, G-Drive Racing swept the front row of the class grid as Derani and Ricardo Gonz√°lez in the No. 28 car took pole position by going faster than Roman Rusinov's and Olivier Pla 2014 pole lap with a two-lap average lap of 1 minute, 48.021 seconds, 0.062 seconds ahead of the sister No. 26 car of Rusinov and Bird. Howson and Nick Tandy in the No. 47 KCMG car was 1.3 seconds slower in third. Signatech Alpine's No. 36 vehicle came fourth in the hands of Paul-Loup Chatin and Vincent Capillaire. The No. 30 ESM car of Ryan Dalziel and David Heinemeier Hansson in fifth were seconds slower than the new generation of class vehicles. Thiim and Marco S√∏rensen, competing in the No. 97 Aston Martin, were the fastest LMGTE Pro qualifiers. They had the only two-lap average time under 2 minutes, at 1 minute, 59.970 seconds, although S√∏rensen made some minor errors on his lap. Richie Stanaway and Fernando Rees in the No. 99 car were 0.206 seconds slower in second, while Darren Turner and Stefan M√ºcke gave Aston Martin first to third in class in the team's No. 95 car. Lietz and Michael Christensen sharing the No. 91 Porsche took fourth and the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari of Gianmaria Bruni and Toni Vilander qualified fifth. In LMGTE Am, Lamy and Paul Dalla Lana completed a sweep of GTE pole positions for Aston Martin with a two-lap class average of 2 minutes, 1.998 seconds, 0.937 seconds faster than Larbre Comp√©tition's No. 50 Corvette of Paolo Ruberti and Kristian Poulsen in second. The No. 88 Abu Dhabi Racing Proton Porsche driven by Khaled al Qubaisi and Bachler qualified third in class. The duo held second until the No. 50 Larbre Comp√©tition Corvette went faster.

When the race began before a crowd of 45,000 spectators at 12:00 British Summer Time (UTC+01:00), Webber retained the lead into the first corner as his teammate Dumas came under attack from di Grassi into Aintree turn. Elsewhere, Tandy made a fast getaway in the KCMG Oreca to claim the lead of LMP2 from the pair of G-Drive Ligiers. On lap three, Di Grassi again tried to overtake Dumas but put himself on the outside of Loop corner, forcing him to slow and give Buemi an opportunity to pass him for third. The No. 4 ByKolles Racing CLM P1/01 of Vitantonio Liuzzi sustained damage to its floor after reported contact by Dalziel's No. 30 ESM, necessitating half an hour of repairs to the car in the garage. After going wide, Wurz lost fifth to Tr√©luyer as Bird retook the LMP2 lead from Tandy at Brooklands corner on the sixth lap. The overall leaders encountered slower traffic twelve minutes in; di Grassi was caught out by this and fell to fifth behind Tr√©luyer and Wurz by running wide. Mark Webber (pictured in 2014) led from pole position until the No. 17 Porsche's rear drivetrain forced him out of the race. Derani passed Tandy on the run to Village corner for second in LMP2. Tr√©luyer put Buemi under pressure for third overall, and di Grassi retook fifth from Wurz. Later, Bachler took over the lead of LMGTE Am, and Tr√©luyer lost fourth to his teammate di Grassi leaving Copse corner. Overtakes occurred in LMGTE Pro as Porsche teammates Lietz and Patrick Pilet got by Stanaway, and Bruni moved past the latter at Stowe corner. Forty-one minutes in the first full course yellow was necessitated by Chatin's No. 36 Signatech Alpine car's incorrectly fitted left-rear wheel coming loose into Corse turn, causing him to veer into the outside tyre barrier with the left-rear of his vehicle. Chatin was unhurt and boarded an ambulance without aid. Several drivers in the top categories made their first pit stops for fuel and tyres under the full course yellow while others remained on the circuit. Racing resumed in the 46th minute with Webber leading teammate Dumas. Race control noticed no repairs to the wall at Copse corner had been done. The second full course yellow was activated early in the second hour to allow this to happen. This caused the trio of LMGTE Pro Aston Martins to lose time making their pit stops between the green flag and the full course yellow. Immediately after the restart, Buemi could not use his hybrid boost system because there was no charge in the capacitor. Buemi was caught off guard as Tr√©luyer overtook him on the outside at Becketts turn and then by di Grassi at Vale corner to fall to fifth overall. Davide Rigon in the No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari took the LMGTE Pro lead because it was on an alternative strategy. Tandy lost third in LMP2 to Dalziel after a slow in-lap. An hour and 20 minutes in (lap 44) Webber drove the No. 17 Porsche into the pit lane to retire the car with a rear drivetrain issue. This gave Lieb the outright lead as he relieved Dumas in the No. 18 Porsche and the Audis of di Grassi and Tr√©luyer gained second and third. The Audis duelled over second in slower traffic when Tr√©luyer passed di Grassi on the inside into Abbey corner. Their fast pace, however, put them onto the run-off area, but they rejoined into Farm curve without losing a plethora of time. Di Grassi was lapping Christian Ried's No. 88 Abu Dhabi Proton Racing Porsche when the two connected at Becketts corner. Di Grassi returned to the pit lane and repairs to the No. 8 vehicle's rear-left deck took two minutes. The car rejoined a lap down in sixth with Lo√Øc Duval aboard. Roman Rusinov (pictured in 2013) contributed to the No. 26 G-Drive Racing Ligier's win by a lap from the sister No. 28 car. As the second round of pit stops for fuel and driver changes began, Tr√©luyer drew closer to Lieb and used his being delayed by Danny Watts' No. 42 Strakka Racing Dome to momentarily take the lead on the outside into Becketts turn before Lieb retook it due to his car's higher straight-line speed on the Wellington Straight into Stowe corner. The two made their pit stops afterwards as F√§ssler took over the No. 7 Audi and Jani entered the No. 18 Porsche. Wurz gained the overall lead after an earlier pit stop during the full course yellow allowed him to lead by 40 seconds. Later, Tandy's No. 47 KCMG car went into the garage after a stone punctured a hole in its radiator and created water pressure issues. Jani lost second to F√§ssler at Village corner; Jani responded by reclaiming the position on the Wellington Straight. The two repeated the same manoeuvres over the following three laps until F√§ssler slowed slightly. In the meantime, Makowiecki's No. 92 Porsche gained the LMGTE Pro lead when Rigon made the No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari's second pit stop and James Calado relieved him. Davidson was closing by one second per lap on the duelling Jani and F√§ssler. Duval got the No. 8 Audi back onto the lead lap when he and Jani negotiated their way past a LMGTE Am Ferrari. During the third phase of pit stops, Conway's No. 2 Toyota was lapping Gianluca Roda's No. 50 Larbre Comp√©tition Corvette at Becketts corner when he was unseen by Roda. Conway mounted the kerb in avoidance hitting a thin plastic bollard that lodged itself in the front of the Toyota's splitter affecting its turn-in handing. Conway's teammate Davidson overtook him for second soon after and took the lead when Jani's No. 18 Porsche entered the pit lane for fuel and tyres; Dumas relieved him. Dumas emerged just ahead of the No. 7 Audi which now had Lotterer aboard. Dumas forced Lieb wide onto the outside line at Village corner for third and kept the position on the Hangar Straight. Lotterer's newer tyres allowed him to close on Conway, and he passed him on the inside at Vale corner for second. Conway later ran wide at Abbey turn because of his worn tyres and lost fourth to Dumas. Rusinov had an anxious moment in the No. 26 G-Drive Ligier when the No. 97 Aston Martin blocked him under braking for the end of the Wellington Staight and spun at Brooklands turn. He recovered without losing the LMP2 class lead to teammate Gonz√°lez as he held a one-minute lead. Lotterer was quicker than race leader Davidson through slower traffic and attempted to pass him on the inside at Brooklands corner, but Davidson blocked him on the Wellington Straight. The following lap, Lotterer tried again into Village turn and was successful this time round and subsequently pulled away. Bruni's No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari took the lead of LMGTE Pro in the fifth minute of the third hour after Pilet's No. 92 Porsche picked up a right-front puncture from going off the circuit. The car entered the garage for four minutes and fell to sixth in class with Makowiecki aboard. Dumas returned to the overall lead during the next pit stop cycle before Lotterer retook it by double stinting his tyres and only stopping for fuel. Lieb now drove the No. 18 Porsche when he went off the racing line onto some astroturf leaving Stowe corner but regained control of the car without losing too much time. Conway turned to the inside at Vale corner to pass Lieb for third three minutes later. Marcel F√§ssler (pictured in 2015) helped achieve the No. 7 Audi's ninth overall win. Duval's No. 8 Audi was forced into the pit lane after running onto grass. The team took minutes and four laps to clean debris at the front of the car and Jarvis overtook it. Rigon caught his teammate Vilander and tried unsuccessfully to pass him on the outside at Village corner for the LMGTE Pro lead. A few minutes later, Rigon tried again, passed Vilander and pulled away. Jarvis in the No. 8 Audi saw some space to pass Poulsen's No. 50 Larbre Comp√©tition Corvette at Becketts turn, but Poulsen turned to block Jarvis and the two collided. Poulsen continued after marshal assistance to extricate him from the gravel trap. Meanwhile, Jani relieved Dumas, and F√§ssler took over from Lotterer at their pit stops. The two LMGTE Pro AF Corse Ferraris started again to duel for the class lead. Bruni tried to overtake Calado at Brooklands corner but was unable to pass because Calado blocked him. On the next lap, Bruni tried again and was successful in passing Calado at the same corner. In the final hour, Jani moved the No. 18 Porsche into second and closed on F√§ssler's No. 7 Audi. Jani moved past F√§ssler on the Wellington Straight due to the Porsche's straightline speed advantage, but the latter came back to reclaim the lead. It momentarily returned to Jani until it was retaken by F√§ssler entering Copse corner as the Porsche struggled to stay with Audi in the turns. Jani re-took the lead and kept it for two minutes before making his last pit stop for left-hand side tyres and no fuel. The final retiree came with 40 minutes to go when Klien went off at Village corner and damaged the radiator and had stiff handling because of aerodynamic deficiencies. Buemi made the No. 1 Toyota's final pit stop for fuel from second overall and came out behind Jani who opened up a four second gap over the car. Drama came with 18 minutes left when race control deemed F√§ssler to have transgressed track limits while passing slower cars on the outside tarmac run-off area at the exit of Club corner, imposing a 10-second stop-and-go penalty that he took with 15 minutes to go and then took up fuel. F√§ssler kept the lead after his race engineer Leena Gade encouraged him to push hard. In the meantime Jani lowered the gap to 12 seconds, and steadily reduced it over the next 14 minutes by pushing hard with his lap times in the 1 minute, 42 second range. However, F√§ssler maintained the overall lead and crossed the start/finish line in a new race distance record of 201 laps to win by 4.610 seconds for his, Lotterer and Tr√©luyer's ninth outright career victory. Buemi got the No. 1 Toyota onto the final step of the overall podium in third. Bird maintained No. 26 G-Drive Oreca's lead to win in LMP2 by one lap over the sister No. 28 car. The third-placed No. 30 ESM car failed its post-race technical inspection. Its front and rear underfloor skid planks were deemed to be under the minimum thickness of , and the No. 42 Strakka Racing entry was given third in LMP2. The No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari of Rigon and Vilander was unchallenged in the final hour of the race and won in LMGTE Pro. The No. 91 Porsche of Christensen and Lietz took second; Bruni and Calado's No. 71 AF Corse car took third. In LMGTE Am, Dalla Lana, Mathias Lauda and Lamy took their third successive win at Silverstone in the No. 98 Aston Martin and were 13.712 seconds ahead of Rui √Åguas, Emmanuel Collard and Fran√ßois Perrodo's No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari. Post-race The top three finishers of all four classes appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. Lotterer acknowledged Audi were under pressure to perform from the first lap and spoke of their desire to carry momentum into Spa-Francorchamps. F√§ssler was sad to incur a stop-and-go penalty and said he felt it would have been fairer had the team been given time to think about the situation. Nevertheless, he was pleased with the duel he had with Jani. Tr√©luyer also expressed his frustration over the penalty as he discussed the situation with his co- drivers. He noted several cars had gone off the circuit throughout the race, but said he was happy with the victory, which he called \\"a well-deserved reward for all the effort the team have put in over the winter.\\" Jani said he enjoyed driving in the race and was trusting of F√§ssler to battle him without contact, \\"For sure it was a great sportscar race and all three manufacturers are all very close. We have to push because it is a six-our sprint race.\\" Davidson said he felt Toyota had to double stint their tyres to stay in contention for the victory but hoped to get into a position where they had an advantage on circuits with higher levels of tyre wear than Silverstone. Journalists reviewing the race agreed that the battle between F√§ssler's No. 7 Audi and Jani's No. 18 Porsche for the win was its highlight. Jack Philipps of Motor Sport wrote that it was like \\"Mini Cooper against Ford Falcon\\", and called it, \\"Utterly scintillating and, when the second Audi joined the battle to unlap itself, even more spectacular\\". The Guardians Giles Richards commented that the momentum Audi were anxious to maintain would be tested at Spa and the 24 Hours of Le Mans since the gap between the three manufacturers was marginal. \\"Audi have once again made their point that you underestimate them at your peril, but the team who use the hashtag #welcomechallenges have found their offer accepted with a powerful and determined threat this year and one that bodes well for a cracking season.\\" Writing for NBC Sports, Luke Smith said, \\"At the start of what looks poised to be the WEC‚Äôs biggest season to date, Silverstone played host to an incredible feast of racing on Sunday as the LMP1 titans all laid claim to their title bid.\\" David Hobbs of AOL considered Lotterer to be Audi's best driver at Silverstone as he was instrumental in helping the team take what the journalist called \\"a famous victory\\". As this was the first race of the season, Lotterer, F√§ssler and Tr√©luyer took the lead of the Drivers' Championship with 25 points, seven points ahead of Lieb, Jani and Dumas in second. The trio were a further three points ahead of Buemi, Davidson and Nakajima in third. Their teammates Wurz, Sarrazin and Conway were fourth with 12 points, with Duval, di Grassi and Jarvis fifth with 10 points. Audi took the early lead in the Manufacturers' Championship with 35 points, seven points ahead of Toyota in second; the third-placed manufacturer Porsche had scored 19 points with seven rounds left in the season.

It is the mammalian homolog of doubletime. CK1Œµ is a serine/threonine protein kinase and is very highly conserved; therefore, this kinase is very similar to other members of the casein kinase 1 family, of which there are seven mammalian isoforms (Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥1, Œ≥2, Œ≥3, Œ¥ and Œµ). CK1Œµ is most similar to CK1Œ¥ in structure and function as the two enzymes maintain a high sequence similarity on their regulatory C-terminal and catalytic domains. This gene is a major component of the mammalian oscillator which controls cellular circadian rhythms. CK1Œµ has also been implicated in modulating various human health issues such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes. == Discovery ==  CK1Œµ-tau Mutation  In hamsters, the CK1Œµ-tau mutation was first discovered by Michael Menaker and Martin Ralph in 1988 while studying a laboratory shipment of Syrian hamsters. They observed a hamster with an abnormal circadian period, and after breeding and further characterization, the two realized the mutation in hamsters conferred a shorter than normal free-running period. They attributed this phenotype to what they termed the ‚Äútau mutation‚Äù, which was the first full description of a mammalian circadian mutant. This discovery provided a tool for other scientists to perform research on biological clocks and was an important early development in the field.  Human CK1Œµ Cloned  In 1995, the human form of CK1Œµ was first isolated and cloned by the Virshup lab at the University of Utah. It was officially identified as an isoform of the casein kinase 1 family. Three transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene in rats: CK1Œµ1, CK1Œµ2, and CK1Œµ3; and two have been found in humans.  Gene Mapping  In 2000, the CK1Œµ gene was later mapped and identified by Joseph Takahashi and colleagues, who, using genetically directed representational difference analysis, discovered that the tau mutation was located on the CK1Œµ gene. The CK1Œµ gene was found to be similar to the doubletime gene in Drosophila, which had been first characterized and incorporated into biological clock function by Michael Young and colleagues in 1998. In humans, the CSNK1E gene localizes at 22q13.1 and consists of 12 exons.  Structural Imaging  Structural imaging was performed of CK1Œµ in 2012 by Alexander Long and colleagues using X-ray crystallography. Certain kinase-related structural motifs were subsequently confirmed, such as a Œ≤-strand-turn-Œ≤-strand motif that anchors ATP, a DFG motif that orients ATP‚Äôs phosphates, a catalytic loop that resembles that of PKA, and major substrate recognition sites in the C-terminal domain. == Structure == The three- dimensional structures of the catalytic domains of the mammalian CK1Œ¥ and CK1Œµ were first solved by X-ray crystallography in 1996 and 2012 respectively. CK1 kinase has multiple isoforms, including a total of seven characterized isoforms in mammals (alpha, beta, gamma1-3, delta, and epsilon. The different isoforms differ mostly in the length and structure of their C-terminal non- catalytic region. Only the delta and epsilon isoforms have been shown to play an important role in circadian rhythm regulation. CK1Œ¥ and CK1Œµ share a highly similar pattern in their structures. The glycine rich P-loop is between the Œ≤1 and Œ≤2 strands, forming a classical Œ≤-strand-turn-Œ≤-strand motif that anchors and clamps the alpha phosphate of ATP. CK1Œ¥/Œµ additionally share conserved features within the catalytic domain, which are composed of both a N-terminal lobe and an Œ±-helical C-terminal lobe. The catalytic center is located in the cleft region between the two lobes, which also associates with the nucleotide and the substrate. All known inhibitors bind to this center, blocking ATP binding. == Function ==  Enzyme function  The protein encoded by the casein kinase 1 epsilon gene is a serine/threonine protein kinase and a member of the casein kinase I protein family, whose members have been implicated in the control of cytoplasmic and nuclear processes, including DNA replication and repair. Like other casein kinase 1 protein family members, casein kinase 1 epsilon recognizes the Ser(p)XXSer/Thr motif for phosphorylation. It is found in the cytoplasm as a monomer and can phosphorylate a variety of proteins, including itself. This autophosphorylation occurs in the protein's C-Terminal domain, a region believed to behave as a pseudosubstrate, and inhibits kinase activity.  The Circadian Clock  The Casein kinase 1 epsilon protein is part of the mammalian oscillator, a group of proteins that keep cells on a roughly 24-hour schedule. This oscillator, or \\"circadian clock,\\" is made up of a transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL) in which several proteins work in tandem, each regulating the others' expression to generate a roughly 24-hour cycle of both mRNA and protein levels. The TTFL also generates roughly 24-hour rhythms of outputs such as levels of cellular hormone release. Daily oscillations in protein and mRNA transcription have been observed in many cells, including the mammalian master clock known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). However, unlike most circadian rhythm proteins that oscillate in their expression, casein kinase 1 epsilon is constitutively active. The core proteins that comprise the mammalian TTFL include Period (PER), Cryptochrome (CRY), BMAL1, CLOCK, and casein kinase 1 epsilon. BMAL1 and CLOCK work to increase PER and CRY transcription by forming a heterodimer and binding on the E-box domain upstream from the PER and CRY gene coding sequences. PER and CRY levels are regulated by negative feedback, meaning that they repress their own transcription. Phosphorylation of PER proteins by CK1Œµ in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus marks these proteins for degradation. Phosphorylation also hinders PER's ability to enter the nucleus by inducing a conformational change in its nuclear localization sequence. On the other hand, the protein complex FBXL3 mediates the degradation of CRY proteins in the cytoplasm and nucleus. If CRY binds to PER before it is phosphorylated by CK1Œµ, these three proteins stabilize into a complex that can enter the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, PER and CRY work to inhibit their own transcription while casein kinase 1 epsilon works to modulate the activity of BMAL1 and CLOCK through phosphorylation. As previously stated, the C-Terminal domain of casein kinase 1 epsilon behaves as a pseudosubstrate when phosphorylated, inhibiting kinase activity. The C-Terminal domain has also been shown to be dephosphorylated by phosphatases such as Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) in vitro and cell culture, which regulates levels of active casein kinase in vivo. Current theory of circadian rhythms hypothesizes that this phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle of casein kinase 1 epsilon is important in modulation of the period of circadian rhythms in the cell, with increased phosphorylation decreasing casein kinase 1 epsilon activity (and subsequently increasing active CRY and PER) and dephosphorylation of casein kinase 1 epsilon resulting in a more active kinase (and lower levels of active CRY and PER). In mice, casein kinase 1 epsilon has been shown to phosphorylate both PER1 and PER2, as well as CRY1 and CRY2. Casein kinase 1 results in a cyclic expression of mammalian oscillator proteins, resulting in a timekeeper (mammalian oscillator) for the cell: {  +Mammalian PER and CRY Protein Levels - ! !Protein Level !Immediate Result !Delayed Result - Dawn (7 am) low PER and CRY protein concentration Per and Cry (gene) actively transcribed and stimulated by transcription factors BMAL1 and CLOCK N/A - Dusk (7 pm) high PER and CRY protein concentration high PER and CRY protein levels repress Per and Cry (gene) transcription casein kinase 1 epsilon phosphorylates PER and CRY, marking the protein for degradation: PER and CRY protein concentration decreases } = Mutations to circadian function = The prominent phenotype in the CK1Œµ tau mutant hamsters discovered by Menaker was an unusually short free-running period ‚Äî 22 hours in heterozygotes, and 20 hours in homozygotes for the mutation‚Äîmaking this allele semidominant. The CK1Œµ gene was later mapped and identified by Joseph Takahashi and colleagues, which revealed a single base-pair C-to-T substitutional mutation in the hamster CK1Œµ gene. This single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) results in an arginine-to-cysteine substitution in a phosphate recognition domain region of CK1Œµ, a highly conserved region of the gene across mammals. Presently, it is unclear how exactly the CK1Œµ-tau mutation results in a shorter free-running period. However, it has been suggested that the tau mutation is a gain-of-function mutation, leading to increased phosphorylation of certain PER sites, thereby increasing the rate of PER degradation and shortening the circadian period. The CK1Œµ-tau mutation in hamsters was the first full description of a mammalian circadian mutant. In humans, mutations affecting the PER2 phosphorylation site of the CK1Œµ and/or CK1Œ¥ gene result in Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (FASPS). This mutation, S662G, which results in the loss of a single phosphate acceptor site on PER2, prevents CK1Œµ protein from binding to PER and leads to an unusually short circadian period. Additionally, a heritable mutation in human CK1Œ¥, T44A, has been identified as another mutation that causes period shortening, and it has been identified as another mechanism that causes FASPS. This mutation reduces CK1Œ¥ activity in vivo in humans, and has similarly been shown to do the same in mice. However, experiments in other species such as flies have shown that this mutation induces period lengthening effects. Furthermore, in humans, the P415A and H417R mutations in PER3 have been shown to destabilize the protein. These mutations have been shown to generate FASPS and are also associated with impaired mood regulation. = Temperature compensation = CK1Œ¥/Œµ is temperature-compensated, a feature of many circadian rhythms. The ability of CK1Œ¥/Œµ to phosphorylate its substrates remains constant even when temperature fluctuates, whereas normal reactions rates tend to increase with increasing temperature. Moreover, CK1Œµ tau mutants show a loss of temperature compensation. = Non-mammalian homologs = Two circadian rhythm functional homologs of this mammalian protein can be found in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly). Functional homologs refer to proteins sharing a similar function in another animal but that are not necessarily genetically similar. One gene, coding for the protein Doubletime (abbreviated dbt), serves a similar purpose to casein kinase 1 epsilon in chronobiology, as it plays a role in the phosphorylation of PER. However its gene sequence shows no sequence homology. In addition, casein kinase 1 epsilon does not completely rescue circadian rhythms in fruit fly doubletime knockouts (dbt -/-), suggesting that these enzymes serve similar, but not identical, functions. Another functional homolog, the Drosophila gene for glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), called shaggy and abbreviated sgg, codes for a protein which phosphorylates Timeless (TIM), the fruit fly CRY functional homolog. Like dbt, shaggy is not a sequence homolog to casein kinase 1 epsilon. Conversely, Gsk3 is also found in mammals, and mutants have been implicated in circadian rhythm abnormalities in patients suffering with bipolar disorder. The Drosophila melanogaster genome contains other casein kinase 1 family enzymes, which are believed to serve no circadian function. However, a different casein kinase family enzyme, casein kinase 2 alpha, has been implicated in providing the initial phosphorylation of a serine residue that is recognized by both DBT and Shaggy for sequential PER and TIM phosphorylation. = Importance of CK1Œ¥ = While CK1Œµ has traditionally been considered the main regulator of PER and CRY phosphorylation, Casein kinase 1 isoform delta (CK1Œ¥ or CSNK1D), an isoform, is thought to play a similar role in the TTFL. Both CK1Œµ and CK1Œ¥ phosphorylate and destabilize PER in vitro as well as interact with PER and CRY in vivo. Moreover, CK1Œ¥ has been shown to better interact with proteins of the drosophila molecular clock than CK1Œµ, indicating that CK1Œ¥ may be more homologous to dbt than CK1Œµ. Additionally, mass spectrometry has shown CK1Œ¥ to be over 20 times as abundant as CK1Œµ in the liver. = Phosphoswitch Mechanism = Phosphorylation of PER2 is believed to be regulated by a phosphoswitch mechanism. Specifically, PER2 requires an initial priming phosphorylation in order to be phosphorylated and subsequently degraded by CK1Œ¥ and/or CK1Œµ. In this manner, temporally sequenced phosphorylations of PER2 act to delay its degradation rate and may provide insight into how the circadian clock is temperature compensated. CK1Œ¥ and/or CK1Œµ may provide the priming activity. The FASP site on PER2 is a key target of this priming kinase activity. Mutations to this site can affect the ability of PER2 to receive a priming phosphorylation, leading to a lengthening or shortening of period. Other studies have suggested that down stream phosphorylation of PER2 leads to stabilizing interactions that decrease the degradation rate of PER. This is thought to increase the period of the circadian clock. Mutations in the phosphorylation area of PER2 are thought to be related to FASPS patients  Other functions  = Canonical Wnt pathway = The canonical Wnt Pathway involves the accumulation of Œ≤-catenin in the cytoplasm, which activates transcription factors. Casein kinase 1 epsilon, and related casein kinase 1 delta, is dephosphorylated in this pathway. Dephosphorylation of casein kinase 1 epsilon is likely achieved by Protein Phosphatase 2 (PP2A), which increases both the enzymes' kinase activity in vivo. Casein kinase 1 epsilon and casein kinase 1 delta have been implicated in increasing Œ≤-catenin's stability in the cytoplasm, although studies of the mechanism for this stabilization are inconclusive. The current theory for how casein kinase 1 epsilon and/or casein kinase 1 delta function in this pathway is that both casein kinases either directly stabilize Œ≤-catenin though positive regulation, or that they indirectly stabilizes Œ≤-catenin through negative regulation of the Œ≤-catenin degradation complex (protease). == Cancer == Casein kinase 1 epsilon and delta are known to phosphorylate a tumor suppressor protein, p53 in vivo in both humans and murine, or old world rats. CK1 phosphorylates p53 on its N-terminus to induce its activation, which subsequently increases cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Damage to DNA has been shown to activate p53 through enhanced CK1 activation. Inactivation of CK1 leads to decreased resistance to apoptosis. Casein kinase 1 epsilon is also implicated as indirectly causing cancer through its regulation of Yes-associated protein (YAP), an oncogene and regulator of organ size. After priming through phosphorylation by the serine/threonine kinase LATS, both casein kinase 1 epsilon and casein kinase 1 delta have been shown to phosphorylate YAP and mark it for ubiquitination and degradation. = Addiction = Several studies have demonstrated a connection between molecular components of the circadian clock and psychiatric disorders, particularly drug abuse. Genetic association studies in humans have implicated CK1Œµ/CK1Œ¥ in the development of addictions to methamphetamine, heroin, and alcohol. Moreover, mouse studies reveal a link between CK1Œµ/CK1Œ¥ activity and the stimulant effect produced by methamphetamine. Additionally, inhibition of CK1Œµ/CK1Œ¥ in rodents has been shown to decrease alcohol and opiate relapse behavior during withdrawal. == Interactions == Casein kinase 1 epsilon has been shown to interact with PER1, PER2, CRY1, CRY2, BMAL1, CLOCK, NPAS2, and AXIN1. PER1, PER2, and BMAL1 can be directly phosphorylated by CK1…õ, while PER3, CRY1, and CRY2 can only be phosphorylated by CK1…õ when associated with PER1 or PER2. == Inhibitors == Several inhibitors have been produced by biotechnology companies to facilitate research on the function of casein kinase 1 epsilon. Testing utilizing CK1Œµ inhibitors have confirmed the involvement of CK1Œµ in a variety of processes, especially in regulation of circadian rhythms.  Pf-670462 and PF-4800567  PF-670462, developed by Pfizer, is a well-characterized inhibitor of both CK1Œµ and CK1Œ¥ that has been shown to lengthen the period of circadian rhythms when administered in vitro to rat fibroblasts and COS cells, and to mice in vivo. PF-4800567, also developed by Pfizer, is a specific inhibitor of CK1Œµ. However, its ability to lengthen circadian rhythms is weaker than that of PF-670462 in both the in vitro rat fibroblasts and in vivo mice models. The mechanisms of inhibition of PF-670462 and PF-4800567 differ between the two molecules as well. PF-670462 maintains CK1Œµ/Œ¥ with the DFG motif facing inward, whereas PF-4800567 hydrophobically interacts with CK1Œµ/Œ¥ to turn the DFG motif outwards, indicative of a Type-II Kinase.  IC261  IC261 is an inhibitor that targets the ATP binding site of both CK1Œ¥ and CK1Œµ. Similarly, it has been shown to lengthen circadian period in rat fibroblasts, and has been implicated in cancer treatment therapies for pancreatic and neuroblastomic cancers.  Others  Other CK1 inhibitors, such as D4476, and pyrazolopyridine analogues, that both target CK1Œ¥, have been characterized to have therapeutic abilities, but their beneficial effects are not well-studied and may stem from other cellular targets. == See also == * Casein kinase 1 family * Doubletime * Gene nomenclature *CSNK1D *CSNK1E == References == Category:Protein kinases ","title":"Casein kinase 1 isoform epsilon"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:R},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function F(s,a,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâLife Quotesü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",I,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(P,[["render",F]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/35.md","filePath":"quotes/35.md"}'),D={name:"quotes/35.md"},N=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{E as __pageData,N as default};
