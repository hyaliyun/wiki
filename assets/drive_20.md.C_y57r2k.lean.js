Before Lethal Lesbian was organized as a festival, it began as independent lesbian film nights, organized by friends of the Ziv and Nir. The evenings were so successful, that the need for a festival in this niche seemed clear to the two founders. The goal of Lethal Lesbian is to promote lesbian filmmaking of all types. The festival screens short and full-length films of all genres, and in some years, produces a concurrent exhibition of women's art. Though occasionally films by straight women (and one man) have been included in the festival lineup, the majority of films are by lesbian and bisexual women. Every year the festival has a theme, and a short promotional movie is produced. These promos have become very popular online. In its first years, the festival took place in various venues, though in recent years, as it has grown to sold-out crowds, the Tel Aviv Cinematheque has become its home. In 2018, as the festival celebrated a decade of queer women's film, the mainstream press lauded its staying power \\"in a landscape in which cultural events have trouble maintaining stability over time\\". The festival is one of only few events aimed specifically for women in the LGBT community, and has provided a supportive venue for the works of filmmakers in the community. == See also == * List of women's film festivals * Women's cinema * List of LGBT film festivals * TLVFest == References == == External links == * Category:2008 establishments in Israel Category:Festivals in Tel Aviv Category:Film festivals established in 2008 Category:Film festivals in Israel Category:Lesbian culture in Asia Category:Lesbian events Category:LGBT culture in Tel Aviv Category:LGBT events in Israel Category:LGBT film festivals Category:Women in Israel Category:Women's film festivals ","title":"Lethal Lesbian"},{"id":"60301927","text":"Lang's worm lizard (Chirindia langi) is a species of amphisbaenian in the family Amphisbaenidae.

He appears first in Silius's list of the Carthaginian forces, being described as the young commander of both the Gallaeci and the Lusitanians in Hannibal's army. He is then compared to the posterior, more famous Viriathus, by stating that his name \\"was to win fame from Roman disasters at a later day\\". Later in the work, he is described as a noble ruler of his peoples, who goes to battle armed with sword and caetra.Silius Italicus, Punica, 5, 219-233 His relationship with his namesake has not been fully understood. Some believe the Carthaginian Viriathus could have been an invention by Silius in order to embellish his work, inserting by parachronism the true Viriathus in the Second Punic War despite chronological impossibilities. By this approach, attributing to him the death of a Roman from the Servilia gens in Punica could be a reference to the historical Viriathus being murdered by order of Quintus Servilius Caepio. However, others have argued that this Viriathus might have been a true historical character with the same name, given that the latter could be actually a title used by chieftains of Celtic peoples.Luís de Camões, Os Lusíadas, Canto III According to the poem, his Lusitanian forces scored a feat in the poem by taking down Roman officer Mamercus at the Battle of Lake Trasimene. Afterwards, Viriathus got his own individual participation in the Battle of Cannae. He and his contingent attacked the positions nearby to the consul Gaius Terentius Varro, where Viriathus killed the proconsul Gnaeus Servilius Geminus by capitalizing on his battle fatigue. This attracted the attention of Lucius Aemilius Paullus, Servilius's superior, who charged at the Spaniards and killed Viriathus while the latter was shouting a song of victory. However, Lucius would be immediately disabled by a slinger and later killed by surrounding Carthaginian soldiers. ==In film and television== In the 2016 series Barbarians Rising, the character of Cumelios (played by Clive Russell) mirrors Viriathus.

This was experienced in some historic periods by the non-Vietnamese populations of territories controlled or substantially under the influence of Vietnam. As with other examples of cultural assimilation, it could either be voluntary or forced and is most visible in the case of territories where the Vietnamese language or culture were dominant or where their adoption could result in increased prestige or social status, as was the case of the nobility of Champa, or other minorities like Tai, Chinese and Khmers. To a certain extent Vietnamization was also administratively promoted by the authorities regardless of eras. ==Summary== Vietnamization is one of major example over cultural assimilation. Dated back from the antiquity of ancient Vietnam, the Vietnamese state, regardless which Governments, had initiated its attempt to assimilate by introducing Vietnamization across the country. Vietnamization efforts were divided into two eras: * Ancient and medieval Vietnam: judging the complicated nature of Vietnam and its country, especially Đại Việt, Vietnamese Emperors used several assimilation process; in one side, loyalty and state assimilation were done with Tai and Hmong tribes within the country; and in one side, is forced ethnic assimilation on remaining ethnics, such as Chinese, Chams, Montagnards, Malays and Khmers. While the first one was more successful, as Tai and Hmong tribes of Vietnam remain largely loyal to the Imperial Vietnamese dynasties, the second one tended to be less successful, due to resistance and even violence. To ensure total ethnic assimilation in later territory, the Vietnamese often used brutal violence and executions. * Modern Vietnam: due to previous wars, the Vietnamese process of forced assimilation tended to be derived by pacifying various ethnic groups. As Vietnamese just regained their independence from France and Japan, it found themselves vulnerable and even unthinkable break-up of Vietnamese state. Since more than 30% Vietnamese population then were not Vietnamese and had a tendency of supporting separatism, Vietnamese nationalists of Vietnam independence movement, notably Việt Minh, regardless what types, both emphasized the need for the ethnic and cultural homogeneity of the state in the long term. This trend went continued at the heat of Vietnam War, especially in South Vietnam while North Vietnam also followed similar methods despite varied tactics. The promotion of Vietnamese language in administration and society soon proved to be the greater threat for non-Vietnamese, eventually leading them to resistance against Vietnamese rule. Eventually, it led to en-masse ethnic rebellions, notably in the South, where its policies were believed to have alienated native population alike. Even after 1975, ethnic rebellions would remain a problem for the newly-established communist Government, but unlike the former Imperial and South Vietnamese Governments which had struggle on maintaining unity in the south, the Communists implemented Vietnamese nationalist fervors and employing Józef Piłsudski-based state assimilation, judging their loyalty on the state above while do not rule out ethnic assimilation once there were rebellions. Subsequently, ethnic rebellions started to be weakened, though not completely ended, such as Degar rebellion in Central Highlands in 2003. ==Antiquity to medieval Vietnamization== Attempts to assimilate non-Vietnamese people began in ancient era, after decades suffering Chinese domination of Vietnam and Sinicization on Vietnamese people. By the time of ancient Văn Lang and Âu Lạc, as well as Nanyue, assimilation policy had not existed. Using elements of previous Sinicization process, Vietnamese dynasties began its process of Vietnamization on smaller ethnic people, in which targeted on the first, the Tai, Muong, Chinese and other mountainous tribes including the Hmongs. All these attempts were mostly successful, due to being able to gain support and loyalty from these tribes, and this would remain for most of antiquity to medieval eras. There had been previous rebellions against it as well, such as the rebellion of Zhuang Tai tribes led by Nùng Trí Cao, who previously fought together with the Vietnamese against the Song dynasty in fear of Vietnamization against the Zhuang people. The rebellion of Nùng Trí Cao was not able to repel the Vietnamese, but he was able to secure the border within Yunnan, which help him establish a Tai state of Danan (Great South) and then Nanyue. Throughout history, Nùng's relations with the Vietnamese were a controversial one, due to mixed characteristics or both cooperations and his resistance to submission to Vietnamization. The Nùng people in Vietnam today was named after his surname and is still a revered hero, while the Vietnamese Government officially acknowledged Nùng's role on Vietnamese history. Vietnamization process since then had remained with little interruption, with the only exception of later Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam. However, the repel of Chinese out from the country soon created a more aggressive Vietnamization, as Vietnam started to attack a number of China's allies like Lan Xang, Lan Na, Cambodia and Champa, as well as penetrating south and attacking Malays in the sea. Captured prisoners and later ethnic people, notably the Hmongs of Central Vietnam, whom unlike the Hmongs of the north, had little to no connection, set up new chapter.https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/5970855d4.pdf Vietnamization of Chams and Khmers was the most known, and the most brutal one. Many Chams had refused the Vietnamese authority within them, and as for the result of the growing Trịnh–Nguyễn War and later Vietnamese Shogunate era, the Nguyễn lords decided to impose restriction of movement on Chams and Khmers, importing Chinese refugees fleeing from Qing conquest of Ming (in which many Chinese immigrants were later Vietnamized, and more successful than with Chams and Khmers).https://kyotoreview.org/issue-5/vietnam-champa-relations-and-the- malay-islam-regional-network-in-the-17th-19th-centuries/ The Vietnamization of Chams went as for the result of resistance by the Chams, with continued from 15th century until the end of Vietnam War, was a sole evidence of the resilient of Vietnamization process; although not judge out anti-Vietnamese unrests by Chams alike. The process of Vietnamization also penetrated to Central Highlands, creating an uneasy sense of sentiment among the Montagnards, those who remained independent tribes for many years despite previous incursions. While the former Khmer Empire and Champa were not able to conquer and only put them as vassalage instead, the Vietnamese were more successful, taking over the Highlands and placed them under Vietnamese control. Nonetheless, for the first years under the Nguyễn dynasty, the Vietnamese Imperial Government only considered the region as its buffer zone rather than placing assimilation, as they needed loyalty from these people. Eventually, the process was okay since the Montagnard ethnic tribes were loyal to the Vietnamese state, and even helped the Vietnamese army to suppress Cham rebellion at 1830s. The process would remain until French conquest. ==French Indochina from 1858–1954== With the French Empire/French Republic took over Vietnam at 1884, Vietnam went under direct rule of Paris. Nonetheless, due to the complicated nature in the region, France soon found out the only way to build their unity single French Indochina (composed Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia) was to place a possible ethnic assimilation under the vision of French Government. By this point, the French soon tolerated parts of Vietnamization process, placing Vietnamese officials in the colony and valued them; while on the same time, buying loyalty with non-Vietnamese ethnic groups to de-Vietnamize others, making/inviting them to establish their own community that supportive of France whenever any attempts of Vietnamese rebellions could occur. This was the trend of \\"divide and rule\\" policy aimed on Vietnamization process. For example, Chinese immigration into Vietnam visibly increased following the French colonisation of Vietnam from 1860 onwards following the signing of the Convention of Peking whereby the rights of Chinese to seek employment overseas were officially recognised by the Chinese, British and French authorities. Unlike their Vietnamese predecessors, who would Vietnamize them, the French were very receptive of these Chinese immigrants as it provided an opportunity to stimulate trade and industry, and they generally found employment as labourers or middlemen. The French established a special Immigration Bureau in 1874 requiring Chinese immigrants to register with the Chinese clan and dialect group associations and eased trade restrictions that were previously in place.Khanh (1993), pp. 21–22 Historians such as Khanh Tran viewed this as a divide-and-rule policy especially upon the possible Vietnamization, and the intention of its implementation was to minimise the chances of any internal revolt against the French authorities.Khanh (1993), p. 28Tong (2010), p. 77 The Chinese population nevertheless witnessed an exponential increase in the late 19th century and more so in the 20th century; between the 1870s and 1890s, some 20,000 Chinese settled in Cochinchina. Another 600,000 arrived in the 1920s and 1930s, and peaks in the migration patterns was especially pronounced during the 1920s and late 1940s when the effects of fighting and economic instability arising from the Chinese Civil War became pronounced.Khanh (1993), pp. 22–23 Both were sponsored and financed by the French authorities in an attempt to de-Vietnamize minorities in French Indochina. This \\"divide-and-rule\\" of France would remain in practice, and was very successful on putting ethnic divisions, as France's de-Vietnamization process increased ethnic awareness of non-Vietnamese people. On the same time, France's assimilation and pacification policy created a new group of educated elites in the country. Notably, France brought Christianity within the Degar community, and the Degar tribes were educated and influenced by French system, which made them one of the most educated minorities in the country. The Montagnards even found their community raising its purpose, which is still relevant today. Assists from France also came to other non-Vietnamese people, though varied on times. French Government would maintain this ethnic policy as their rule remained in Vietnam until the outbreak of First Indochina War. The war changed rapidly with the rise of Việt Minh, an anti-colonial group that later functioned into its own army. The Việt Minh, represented by the idea of a united Vietnamese state, directly embraced the idea of Vietnamization process and placed minorities on its target via loyalty to the nation. This targeted greatly on non-Vietnamese, and even non-Buddhists, many were thought to have sided with France against the Vietnamese, notably Hmongs, Chams, Khmers and Degars. When France was expelled from Vietnam, the policy of Vietnamization, encouraged by both the communists and Republican Government, continued resulting with forcing name changes, religious conversions and rising Vietnamese awareness. ==Vietnam War and after 1975== Both North Vietnam and South Vietnam practiced similar Vietnamization process, as both targeted on its minorities and to raise stronger Vietnamese awareness. The most relevant was the Vietnamization process launched by the South against its Degar population. Although the South Vietnamese and Degars were common allies of the United States against growing threat from communist North, the South Vietnamese, composed by mainly ethnic Vietnamese and Vietnamized minorities like Khmers, distrusted its Degar allies and had done very little to promote ethnic awareness of Degars. Rather, South Vietnamese Government promoted Vietnamness and Vietnamese nationalism, hoping to completely Vietnamize the Degars, in which after 1975 the communist North continued. The Americans, however, were seen as an unwanted counter against Vietnamization process of Degar minorities, as they formed bonds with the Montagnards while the Montagnards hated the increasing of Vietnamese population regardless North or South alike. Montagnards' alliance with the Americans didn't make them prefer the South Vietnamese, as South Vietnamese Government continued to enact Vietnamization, accused by Montagnards as ethnic genocide on them; in which both South Vietnam and later communist Government of Vietnam vehemently denied. Continuous Vietnamization was sponsored directly by the Southern Government without opposition from ethnic Vietnamese majority. The Communist North Vietnamese Government, on the other hand, attempted to use Vietnamization process for the same thing, and inherited the previous successful Vietnamization on indigenous Tai, Lao and Hmong tribes in the north to deal with South Vietnam, especially Degars. The Degars were almost opposing every Vietnamese regardless from the South or North, had to face forced displacement by various attacks led by both South Vietnamese and North Vietnamese armies. The Americans were unable to prevent this, despite being ally of both Degars and South Vietnam as Vietnamization had been practiced by both North and South Vietnam alike. Montagnards rebelled against the South Vietnamese in 1974. Similar to the Degars, the Chams and Khmers were too main major other ethnic people to suffer forced Vietnamization, although Vietnamization had been longer to them than to the Degars. The Vietnamese, already assimilated and Vietnamized the Chams since 15th century, continued to openly discriminate the Chams due to unlimited opposition to Vietnamization among the latter, even fiercer than with Degars due to longer history of contact. Chams had founded the FULRO in hope to fight the much larger and more armed Vietnamese, culminating FULRO insurgency against Vietnam. Same to Degars, Chams and Khmers also fought both North and South Vietnamese Government, and later unified communist Government of Vietnam, and their resistance against Vietnamization process remained. The end of Vietnam War forced ethnic minorities, mostly in the south, to face forced Vietnamization, or to give up. FULRO became a united force for almost every ethnic minorities of Southern Vietnam against the Vietnamese, composed both Khmers, Chams, Degars and Hmongs (mostly Hmong Christians). The level of insurgency against unified Vietnam came tenser at 1980s after the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia, received arms and ammunitions against the Vietnamese forces. Cambodians, majority of ethnic Khmers, whom suffered previous discrimination and Vietnamization process, also attempted to resist Vietnamization.http://viet-studies.net/kinhte/CambodiaVietnam_SEA.pdf Both these resistances eventually ended in complete failure at 1990s, as Vietnam enacted Đổi mới reforms and normalization of relations between Vietnam to China and the West, who used to support de-Vietnamization process. The normalization of relations allowed Vietnam to be free on ongoing Vietnamization process. Despite the collapse of FULRO and weakening the insurgency, Vietnamization process had been the cause of 2001 and 2004 Degar rebellions in Central Highlands, aimed on the same accusation of Vietnamization. Since then, ongoing Vietnamization forced Degar refugees to flee Vietnam en-masse. In the same thing, Cham and Khmer refugees also attempted to flee from Vietnam due to Vietnamization, even it is not large like the situation of Degar refugees. ==References== ==Further reading== * * Category:History of Vietnam Category:Vietnamese culture Category:Cultural assimilation Category:Khmer language ","title":"Vietnamization (cultural)"},{"id":"60302245","text":"Daba () is a town under the administration of Heping County, Guangdong, China. , it has one residential community and 15 villages under its administration. == References == Category:Township-level divisions of Guangdong Category:Heping County ","title":"Daba, Heping County"},{"id":"60302258","text":"Elmer Herman Droste (June 16, 1895 - April 23, 1972) was an American lawyer, politician, and Army officer.

He was the second son of Geraldyn Redmond (1854–1918) and Estelle Maud (née Livingston) Redmond (1860–1916). His brothers were Johnston Livingston Redmond and Geraldyn Livingston Redmond. In New York, the Redmonds lived at 701 Fifth Avenue, next door to their aunt at 705 Fifth Avenue, in what was disguised by McKim, Mead & White as a single French limestone mansion. His parents, who were prominent in Catholic circles, donated the funds to the Fathers of Mercy, a French community of priests, to build Church of Notre-Dame on 114th Street in Manhattan. His paternal grandparents were Sabina Elizabeth (née Hoyt) Redmond and William Redmond, a prominent merchant with Wm. Redmond & Son, who was born in Ballymena, County Antrim in Northern Ireland, and was one of the founders of the Union Club. His paternal uncle was the bachelor Goold H. Redmond, and through his paternal aunt, Matilda Redmond Cross, the wife of banker Richard James Cross, he was a first cousin of John Walter Cross and Eliot Cross, prominent architects with the firm of Cross & Cross. His maternal grandparents were Johnston Livingston and Sylvia Mathilde (née Livingston) Livingston. Through his maternal grandmother, a granddaughter of U.S. Representative Henry W. Livingston, he was also a descendant of the Schuyler family. In 1902, his mother and aunt, Countess Carola de Laugier- Villars, built St. Sylvia Church in Tivoli, in memory of Redmond's maternal grandmother. Redmond attended Harvard University and after graduation in 1915 (cum laude), attended Columbia Law School where he obtained his juris doctorate in 1917. ==Career== From May 12, 1917 to March 2, 1919, he served in the U.S. Army, obtaining the rank of 1st Lieutenant, Field Artillery. Redmond was a member of the Plattsburg Movement and attended Officers Training Camp. After sailing to France, he was detailed to the Artillery School at Fontainebleau and Gondrecourt. Beginning in 1918, he took part in the Battle of Château-Thierry, was transferred to the 306th Field Artillery and fought in the Oise-Aisne and the Meuse-Argonne Offensives. After his return from War, he was admitted to the bar in 1919. In 1929, Redmond joined the prestigious New York law firm of Carter, Ledyard & Milburn and was with the firm, as counsel, until his death in 1982. For a time, he was Vincent Astor's personal attorney. He also served on the board of many institutions, including the Pierpont Morgan Library, the New York Public Library, the American Geographic Society and the United States Trust Company of New York. ===Metropolitan Museum of Art=== Open letter to Roland L. Redmond, May 20, 1950, from the Hedda Sterne papers. From 1947 to 1964, Redmond served as president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and was a \\"trustee, elective and emeritus, for 48 years, a record for a Met trustee.\\" While president, two directors worked underneath him, Francis Henry Taylor and James Rorimer, and a massive expansion program that took place between 1951 and 1954, and involved nearly the entire reconstruction of the existing building and modernization of the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium. The most popular exhibition while he was president was in 1963 when the Mona Lisa was on display for one-month. His tenure was also marked by several attacks from artists who felt the museum was opposed to contemporary art, which \\"Redmond did not take pains to conceal his own lack of sympathy with a good deal of modern art.\\" In 1950, in response to a juried exhibition, entitled American Painting Today - 1950, eighteen well-known American painters later, including Clyfford Still, Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock, collectively known as The Irascibles, sent an open letter to Redmond stating they would not participate because the juries were \\"notoriously hostile to advanced art.\\" ==Personal life== On June 5, 1915, Redmond was married to Sara Delano (1894–1984) at St. Sylvia's Memorial Church with a reception held at the Delano country estate, Steen Valetje. Sara was the youngest daughter of coal tycoon Warren Delano and Jennie (née Walters) Delano. Her mother was the daughter of William Thompson Walters, a merchant and art collector, and the niece of Henry Walters, who formed the Walters Art Museum. Through her namesake aunt Sara Delano Roosevelt, Sara was a first cousin of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They had a home in New York City, at 760 Fifth Avenue (and later at 350 Fifth Avenue), and a residence in Syosset on Long Island known as White Elephant Farm. Before their divorce in 1953, they were the parents of four daughters: * Sylvie Livingston Redmond, a writer who married William Griffiths Jr. in December 1940. * Sheila Delano Redmond (d. 2000), who married Malcolm D. Perkins in 1944. * Joan Walters Redmond (1919–1995), who married Curtis Seaman Read. * Cynthia Redmond, who married Maj. Peter Somes Hopkins in 1946. She later married Donald E. Mead. In 1916, upon the death of his mother, he inherited $75,000 (equivalent to $ today) outright and an interest in the trust set up for the remainder of her estate, valued between $3,000,000 and $4,000,000. 1925, he inherited his aunt's home at Tivoli-on-the-Hudson upon her death, along with a legacy in excess of $200,000 (equivalent to $ today). After he left his wife in the fall of 1952, he took up with Lydia Paine (née Bodrero), Princess di San Faustino, and they married in Palm Beach on December 2, 1957. Lydia, the daughter of Commendatore Gen. Alessandro Bodrero, was the mother of two children, Edith Carpenter Macy (b. 1927) (the wife of Friedrich Karl von Schönborn-Buchheim), from her first marriage to Valentine E. Macy Jr., and Montino Bourbon del Monte, Prince di San Faustino (b. 1942), from her second marriage to Ranieri Bourbon del Monte, Prince di San Faustino. Ranieri was a son of Carlo Bourbon del Monte, Prince di San Faustino and brother to Virginia Bourbon del Monte, wife of industrialist Edoardo Agnelli. Redmond died on April 20, 1982 at his home in Tivoli. ===Honors and legacy=== Redmond was awarded the Legion of Honor from France as well as decorations from the Netherlands (as Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau) and Denmark. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources ==External links== * Bust of Roland L.

The episode has contestants pose for fake mug shots for the mini challenge, and to act in the mock prison sitcom \\"Hot In Tuckahoe\\" for the main challenge. Max Mutchnick and Nicole Sullivan serve as guest judges, alongside regular panellists Billy B, RuPaul, and Michelle Visage. == Episode == === Mini Challenge === Willam who won the mini challenge with Madame LaQueer The ten remaining contestants are told to pair up to pose for fake mug shots. The pairs are as follows: * Madame LaQueer and Willam *Chad Michaels and Sharon Needles * DiDa Ritz and Jiggly Caliente * Kenya Michaels and Phi Phi O'Hara *Latrice Royale and Milan The queens are handcuffed together and have to do each other's prison style make-up. Madame LaQueer and Willam win the challenge for their blue dye pack inspired looks making them team captains for the maxi challenge. === Main Challenge === For the main challenge, the queens star in the mock sitcom \\"Hot In Tuckahoe\\" starring four friends and one butch prison guard, \\"Large Marge\\". Madame LaQueer's team is made up of DiDa, Kenya, Milan, and Sharon and Phi Phi, Latrice, Chad, and Jiggly are on Willam's team. The queen's are directed by Will and Grace co-creator Max Mutchnick. He mentors the teams as they act in two innuendo-filled episodes, \\"Dressed in Beaver\\" starring team Madame LaQueer and \\"Mr Happy's Tasty Nuts\\" with team Willam. Latrice is cast as the prison guard and Ru asks if she will draw on personal experience as she previously served time. While directing Max Mutchnick specifically praises DiDa and Latrice for their performances. Back in the workroom, Phi Phi and Sharon fight after Sharon reveals she criticised Phi Phi's leadership skills the previous week on the main stage. This leads to a heated argument and Phi Phi tells Sharon to \\"Go back to Party City where you belong\\", criticising Sharon's 'costume' like drag, one of the most famous quotes from the show. === Runway === Latrice Royale who won the maxi challenge as \\"Large Marge\\" RuPaul introduces guest judges Max Mutchnick and Nicole Sullivan, and reveals the runway theme for the runway category: \\"Television Premiere\\" (red carpet style outfits). On the main stage, the judges watch the performances of both groups and Ru declares Willam's team as the winners and Latrice as the winner of the challenge for her performance as \\"Large Marge\\". She wins a cruise courtesy of the company AlandChuck.travel. Willam's team are all declared safe and head backstage while Madame LaQueer's team are critiqued. Kenya and Milan are both praised for their runway looks but criticised for their acting in the challenge. The judges also note that Madame LaQueer made poor casting choices and performed badly in the challenge. DiDa is highly praised for her performance in the challenge but has negative critiques of her outfit. Max Mutchnick also critiques Sharon for speaking back when being directed but Nicole complements her unusual character. DiDa, Sharon, and Kenya are declared safe and Madame LaQueer and Milan lipsync to \\"Trouble\\" by P!NK. Milan wins the lip sync and Madame LaQueer is eliminated from the competition. == Reception == Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club said the mini challenge was \\"a brilliant challenge, forcing the queens to put their faces in the hands of another, and the smart pairs take advantage of the handicap and create a story around their messy makeup.\\" The performances in the main challenge were criticised by Mark Peikert from Out magazine who says \\"The sitcoms are… leaden, I guess is the word. The judges cackle good-naturedly, but they’re mostly only impressed with Latrice and DiDa.\\" == Legacy == Latrice reprised the role of \\"Large Marge\\" for a mini challenge on season 7 episode 8 where the queens had to dress up as prisoners in \\"Tuckahoe Prison for Ladies\\". She also repurposed a quote from the episode, \\"Get those nuts away from my face!\\" as her entrance quote on the Holi-slay Spectacular episode where she entered saying \\"Get those chestnuts away from my face!\\" == References == == External links == * Queens Behind Bars at IMDb Category:2012 American television episodes Category:American LGBT-related television episodes Category:RuPaul's Drag Race episodes ","title":"Queens Behind Bars"},{"id":"60302439","text":"I Feel Better () is a 2017 French comedy film directed by Jean-Pierre Améris.http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=250678.html ==Cast== * Éric Elmosnino : Laurent * Ary Abittan : Edouard * Judith El Zein : Elise * Alice Pol : Pauline * François Berléand : Audibert * Lise Lamétrie : Laurent's mother * Henri Guybet : Laurent's father * Sacha Bourdo : Vassilis * Sabine Pakora : The prostitute ==References== ==External links== * Category:2017 films Category:French films Category:French-language films Category:2017 comedy films Category:Films directed by Jean-Pierre Améris Category:EuropaCorp films Category:French comedy films ","title":"I Feel Better (film)"},{"id":"60302456","text":"Menke-Hennekam syndrome is a rare condition characterised by a constellation of lesions mostly involving the brain. ==Signs and symptoms== The feature of this condition include * Microcephaly * Ventriculomegaly * Absent corpus callosum * Autistic behavior * Feeding problems * Epilepsy * Variable intellectual disability * Staphyloma * Cochlear malformations * Mild hearing impairment * Exomphalos * Short stature * Recurrent upper airway infections ==Genetics== This condition has been associated with mutations in the CREB binding protein gene (CREBBP).

However, it then dropped the plans and effectively abandoned the cemetery. *East Sheen Cemetery, in East Sheen, opened in 1906 and is now contiguous with Richmond Cemetery, though the original boundary is marked by a hedge. The cemetery's chapel, now used for services by both sites, was built in 1906 in the Gothic Revival style by local architect Reginald Rowell, who was himself later buried in the cemetery. The cemetery contains several particularly noticeable memorials. The most important monument in the cemetery is the memorial to coal mining industrialist George William Lancaster and his wife by Sydney March (1876–1968) – a bronze sculpture of an angel weeping over a stone sarcophagus dating from the 1920s. It was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1992, and according to Historic England is \\"considered one of the most significant 20th-century examples of funerary sculpture\\". The cemetery also contains over 70 war graves, cared for by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. *Hampton Cemetery, in Hampton, was opened in 1879. Fourteen Commonwealth servicemen and servicewomen of World War I and seven of World War II are buried in the cemetery. *Mortlake Cemetery is a cemetery in Kew. It is also known as Hammersmith New Cemetery as it provided burials for the then Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith when Margravine Cemetery was full. The cemetery opened in 1926 and is still in use. It is now managed by Hammersmith and Fulham Council. The cemetery includes the Commonwealth war graves of 109 service personnel of World War II, some of them in a special services plot in the south-eastern corner of the cemetery. Seventy-seven Commonwealth servicemen of World War II who were cremated at Mortlake Crematorium, which adjoins the cemetery, are listed on a screen wall memorial erected by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in the cemetery. They include England rugby international Vivian Davies (1899–1941) who was a captain in the Royal Artillery. The memorial is listed Grade II by Historic England. North Sheen Cemetery *North Sheen Cemetery, established in 1909 and still in use, is in Kew (historically in North Sheen, Surrey). It is managed by Hammersmith and Fulham Council. The cemetery includes 110 identified graves of Commonwealth service personnel in the First and Second World Wars and a memorial garden. *Old Mortlake Burial Ground, in Mortlake, was established in 1854, and enlarged in 1877. It includes Commonwealth war graves of 21 British service personnel, 19 from World War I and two from World War II. CWGC cemetery report; breakdown obtained from casualty record. *Richmond Cemetery, in Richmond, opened in 1786 and has been expanded several times. Many prominent people are buried in the cemetery, as are 39 soldiers who died at the South African Hospital in Richmond Park during the First World War and many ex- servicemen from the nearby Royal Star and Garter Home. These residents are commemorated by the Bromhead Memorial, which lists the names of those who are not commemorated elsewhere, while the South African soldiers are commemorated by a cenotaph designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, derived from his design of the Cenotaph on Whitehall in central London. The war graves and the cenotaph are the responsibility of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. *Teddington Cemetery is a Grade II listed cemetery in Teddington. It opened in 1879, and includes the war graves of 70 Commonwealth service personnel, 42 from World War I and 28 from World War II. Breakdown obtained from casualty record. *Twickenham Cemetery is a cemetery in Whitton. It was established in 1868 and was expanded in the 1880s when the local parish churchyards were closed to new burials. *Vineyard Passage Burial Ground is a cemetery in Richmond. Established in 1790 and consecrated in 1791, it was enlarged in 1823. The last burials were in 1874. Managed by Richmond upon Thames Council and maintained by volunteers from the Environment Trust for Richmond upon Thames, it is now a garden of rest. It includes a Grade II monument to English architect Thomas Cundy (senior) (1765–1825) and his wife Mary. The brick walls to the cemetery (forming the side of Vineyard Passage) and the 19th-century iron railings are also Grade II listed. ==Crematoria== *Mortlake Crematorium in Kew was licensed in 1936 under the Mortlake Crematorium Act 1936, thereby becoming the first crematorium in England to be established under its own Act of Parliament. It opened in 1939 and has been a Grade II listed building since 2011, being assessed by Historic England as having \\"a distinctive Art Deco design that survives little altered in a compact and practical composition\\". ==Mausoleums== Comte de Vezlo Mausoleum * The Comte de Vezlo Mausoleum, in the churchyard of St Mary Magdalen Roman Catholic Church, Mortlake, commemorates the very young Comte de Vezlo, Guilaume Henri (1894–1901). A plaque near the mauseolum's entrance also commemorates his mother, Annette Rosamonde Blasio, the Comtesse de Vezlo, who died in 1938. * The Grade II* listed Kilmorey Mausoleum, in St Margarets, is in the style of an ancient Egyptian monument and has been described as a \\"fine example of an Egyptian-style mausoleum, with an unusually good interior\\". Designed by Henry Edward Kendall Jr. (1805–1885), it was commissioned in the 1850s by Francis Needham, 2nd Earl of Kilmorey (1787–1880) and contains the bodies of the Earl and his mistress, Priscilla Anne Hoste (1823–1854). * The Mausoleum of Sir Richard and Lady Burton, in the churchyard of St Mary Magdalen Roman Catholic Church Mortlake, is a Grade II* listed tent-shaped mausoleum of Carrara marble and Forest of Dean stone. Completed in 1891, it contains the tombs of the Victorian explorer Sir Richard Burton (1821–1890), who took part in the search for the source of the River Nile and translated The Arabian Nights, and his wife Isabel, Lady Burton (1831–1896), who designed it. ==War memorials== *The Hampton Wick War Memorial, in Hampton Wick, was unveiled in 1921 and has been Grade II listed since 2015. * The Richmond War Memorial, in Richmond, was unveiled in 1921 and has been Grade II listed since 2017. * The South African War Memorial in Richmond Cemetery was designed by architect Sir Edwin Lutyens in the form of a cenotaph, similar to that on Whitehall, also by Lutyens. The memorial commemorates the 39 South African soldiers who died of their wounds at a military hospital in Richmond Park during the First World War. It was unveiled by General Jan Smuts in 1921 and has been Grade II listed since 2012. Other listed war memorials include: *The Kew War Memorial, near St Anne's Church, unveiled in 1921 and Grade II listed since 2015. *The Mortlake and East Sheen War Memorial, in East Sheen, unveiled in 1925 and Grade II listed since 2017. *The Petersham War Memorial, in the churchyard of St Peter's Church, unveiled in 1920 and Grade II listed since 2017. *The Teddington War Memorial, in Teddington, unveiled in 1921 and Grade II listed since 2017. *The Twickenham War Memorial in Radnor Gardens, designed by Mortimer Brown and erected in 1921. It has been Grade II* listed since 2017. ==Other memorials== Bromhead Memorial Bolan's shrine, on what would have been his 60th birthday, 30 September 2007 *The Bromhead Memorial is a Grade II listed memorial in Richmond Cemetery to deceased residents of the nearby Royal Star and Garter Home. It was commissioned as a gift from the Bromhead family in the name of Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Bromhead – who served as a governor of the Star and Garter Home – and his wife Margaret, who was also a governor and the home's matron. The memorial was designed by Cecil Thomas (1885–1976) and has been described by historian Darren Beach as \\"probably the finest sight at Richmond Cemetery\\". *Marc Bolan's Rock Shrine is a memorial to Marc Bolan, of glam-rock band T-Rex, on the site where he died in a car crash in Barnes on 16 September 1977. It is recognised by the English Tourist Board in its guide England Rocks as a \\"Site of Rock 'n' Roll Importance\\" in England. * There are several memorials in Richmond Park: **Trees: The Jubilee Plantation, commemorating the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria, was established in 1887. Prince Charles' Spinney was planted out in 1951McDowall, p. 131 with trees protected from the deer by fences, to preserve a natural habitat. The bluebell glade is managed to encourage native British bluebells. Teck Plantation, established in 1905,McDowall, p. 122 commemorates the Duke and Duchess of Teck, who lived at White Lodge. Their daughter Mary married George V.McDowall, p. 70 Tercentenary Plantation, in 1937, marked the 300th anniversary of the enclosure of the park. Victory Plantation was established in 1946 to mark the end of the Second World War. Queen Mother's Copse, a small triangular enclosure on the woodland hill halfway between Robin Hood Gate and Ham Gate, was established in 1980 to commemorate the 80th birthday of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. The park lost over 1000 mature trees during the Great Storm of 1987 and the Burns' Day storm of 1990. The subsequent replanting included a new plantation, Two Storms Wood, a short distance into the park from Sheen Gate. Some extremely old trees can also be seen inside this enclosure. **James Thomson: A bench sculpted by Richard Farrington and known as \\"Poet's seat\\" is located at the north end of Pembroke Lodge Gardens, in a spot called Poet's Corner, which also has three curved benches inscribed with a couplet by the Welsh poet W. H. Davies (1871–1940), \\"A poor life this, if, full of care, we have no time to stand and stare\\". The seat is inscribed with lines by the poet James Thomson (1700–1748) who is also commemorated by a wooden memorial plaque with an ode to Thomson by the writer and historian John Heneage Jesse (1809–1874). King Henry's Mound, also in Pembroke Lodge Gardens, is inscribed with a few lines from Thomson's poem \\"The Seasons\\". **Ian Dury: In 2002 a \\"musical bench\\", designed by Mil Stricevic, was placed in a favoured viewing spot of rock singer and lyricist Ian Dury (1942–2000) near Poet's Corner. On the back of the bench are the words \\"Reasons to be cheerful\\", the title of one of Dury's songs. In 2015 the bench was refurbished, and now includes a QR code which, when scanned with a smartphone, gives access to nine Ian Dury and the Blockheads songs and Dury's Desert Island Discs interview with Sue Lawley, first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 15 December 1996. ==References== ==Source== * Category:Cemeteries in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames Category:Lists of cemeteries in the United Kingdom Category:London Borough of Richmond upon Thames Category:Military memorials in London Category:Monuments and memorials in London Category:Lists of monuments and memorials in London ","title":"List of cemeteries, crematoria and memorials in Richmond upon Thames"},{"id":"60302549","text":"Freedom of religion in Slovakia refers to the extent to which people in Slovakia are freely able to practice their religious beliefs, taking into account both government policies and societal attitudes toward religious groups. The laws of Slovakia guarantee the freedom of religious belief, and criminalize the defamation of and discrimination against religious groups. Religious groups may register with the government in order to receive certain privileges, but the threshold of membership required for new groups to register is prohibitively high. Government officials have explicitly stated that preventing Islamic organizations from registering is a reason for this requirement. Christian groups have also complained that this membership threshold stymies the ability for individuals in registered religious organizations to dissent against their religious leadership. Politicians from far-right parties in the National Council, Slovakia's legislative body, frequently espouse Islamophobic and antisemitic rhetoric and conspiracy theories. Some of them have faced censure as a consequence of their violation of laws against the propagation of extremist materials and against affiliation with groups dedicated to the suppression of fundamental rights and freedoms. According to NGOs and unregistered religious groups, negative attitudes toward unregistered religious groups are prevalent, and there are significant amounts of hate speech online against religious minorities and refugees. == Demographics == According to the 2011 census, Roman Catholics constitute 62 percent of the population. Augsburg Lutherans 5.9 percent, and Greek Catholics 3.8 percent; 13.4 percent did not state a religious affiliation. Other religious groups present in small numbers include the Reformed Christian Church, other Protestant groups, Jehovah's Witnesses, Orthodox Christians, Jews, Bahais, and Muslims.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Slovak Republic, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Greek Catholics are generally ethnic Slovaks and Ruthenians, although some Ruthenians belong to the Orthodox Church. Most Orthodox Christians live in the eastern part of the country. Members of the Reformed Christian Church live primarily in the south, near the border with Hungary, where many ethnic Hungarians live. Other religious groups tend to be spread evenly throughout the country. ==History== ===Early modern period=== For much of the late medieval and early modern period, the territories corresponding to modern day Slovakia were controlled by the Austrian Empire. During this period, Hungarian aristocrats encouraged Jews from elsewhere in eastern and central Europe to immigrate into their territories. Parts of modern-day Slovakia were also controlled by the Ottoman Empire until the late 17th century, incorporate in the Budin Eyalet, Eğri Eyalet and Uyvar Eyalet. The populations of these regions were religiously diverse, including Muslims, Christians of various denominations, and Jews; non-Muslims were required to pay a special tax to the Ottoman government.Ottoman Warfare 1500-1700, Rhoads Murphey, 1999, p.258 During the 18th century, Maria Theresa actively tried to suppress the Jewish and Protestant communities living in the Austrian Empire, at certain points going as far as ordering the expulsions of Jews en masse.Beales, Derek (2005). Enlightenment and Reform in Eighteenth-Century Europe. p. 14. London: I.B.Tauris. Kann, Robert (1980). A history of the Habsburg Empire, 1526–1918. pp189-90. Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press. . Her son and successor, Emperor Joseph II of Austria, reversed these policies and passed the Patent of Toleration in 1781 followed by the Edict of Tolerance in 1782, with the former granting religious freedom to non-Catholic Christians, and the latter extending religious freedom to Jews,Ingrao, W. Charles. The Habsburg Monarchy 1618-1815Great Britain:Cambridge University Press, 1994. pg 199 although it also limited the ability of Jews to publish literature in traditional Jewish languages such as Yiddish and Hebrew.O'Brien, H.C. Ideas of Religious Toleration at the time of Joseph II.Transactions of the American Philosophical Society pg.30 Retrieved 02-2008 === First Czechoslovak Republic === Following the dissolution of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, Slovakian territories were incorporated as part of Czechoslovakia. Early on, Czechoslovakia was one of the most favorable countries for Jews in Eastern Europe in the interwar period, with the government providing political support to Jews as an official national group within the country. However, this policy of ethnic and religious tolerance waned during the 1930s as antisemitism became increasingly popular in the country. === Slovak State === During World War II, Slovakia was governed by a Nazi client-state. This state broadly complied with the Nazi regime's genocidal policies, first imposing anti-Jewish laws analogous to the Nuremberg Laws,Nižňanský, Eduard (2010). Nacizmus, holokaust, slovenský štát [Nazism, holocaust, Slovak state] (in Slovak). p 178. Bratislava: Kalligram. and later deporting Jews to German-run camps in Poland as part of the Holocaust. Around 105,000 Jews, 77% of the pre-war Jewish population, were consequently killed. === Czechoslovak Socialist Republic === After World War II, Czechoslovakia was reconstituted as a socialist state. During this period, religion was suppressed by the government, which promoted atheism. Article 32 of the 1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia establishes the freedom of religion for individuals. === Independent Slovakia === Since the establishment of the Republic of Slovakia in 1993, the government has granted subsidies to religious groups on a yearly basis. In 2017, politicians in government, including representatives of Direction – Social Democracy, the largest political party in the government and part of the ruling coalition, stated that their support for raising the number of religious members required for group registration was explicitly due to a concern that Islamic groups would otherwise be able to register in the country. In January 2017, then-Prime Minister Robert Fico stated that a “unified Muslim community” within the country's territory would be a “constant source of security risk,” and that this justified a refusal to accept migrants under the European Commission's refugee resettlement program. Members of opposition parties have also expressed strong opposition to Islam. As of the 2016 Slovak parliamentary election, Kotleba – People's Party Our Slovakia (L'SNS), a Neo-Nazi party, won 14 seats in parliament (out of 150), making it the 5th largest party in parliament. Its representatives have engaged in Islamophobic and antisemitic rhetoric in parliamentary debates, among other things claiming that Islam condones pedophilia and necrophilia, and that \\"Zionist\\" politicians were involved in a conspiracy to bring Muslims into Slovakia. Individual representatives of L'SNS have been charged by the Slovak Police Force for propagating extremist rhetoric and the defamation of nations and beliefs. In 2017, a Supreme Court received a proposal made by the prosecutor general to dissolve L'SNS for being a threat to the country's democratic system, as well as for violation of the constitution and other laws. The case was dismissed in 2019, ruling that the prosecution had failed to provide sufficient evidence. A 2017 case filed against L'SNS MP Stanislav Mizik for incitement on Facebook was similarly dismissed in 2019. Later that year, however, Mizik's attorney and six other people were arrested for the possession of Nazi paraphernalia, and in October a L'SNS official was convicted for shouting a greeting associated with a Slovak fascist paramilitary at a Supreme Court hearing in 2018. L'SNS and other far-right sympathizers organized a variety of other actions commemorating the fascist First Slovak State over the course of 2019. == Legal framework == The constitution guarantees the freedom of religious belief and affiliation. It further states the country is not bound to any particular faith and religious groups shall manage their affairs independently from the state, including in providing religious education and establishing clerical institutions. The constitution guarantees the right to practice one's faith privately or publicly, either alone or in association with others. It states the exercise of religious rights may be restricted only by measures “necessary in a democratic society for the protection of public order, health, and morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.” The law does not allow burial earlier than 48 hours following death, even for religious groups whose traditions mandate an earlier burial. === Anti-discrimination laws === The law prohibits establishing, supporting, and promoting groups dedicated to the suppression of fundamental rights and freedoms, including religious freedom, as well as “demonstrating sympathy” with such groups. These crimes are punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment. The law further prohibits Holocaust denial, including questioning, endorsing, or excusing the Holocaust. Violators face sentences of up to three years in prison. The law also prohibits the denial of crimes committed by the prior fascist and communist regimes. The law criminalizes issuance, possession, and dissemination of extremist materials, including those defending, supporting, or instigating hatred, violence, or unlawful discrimination against a group of persons on the basis of their religion. Such criminal activity is punishable by up to eight years’ imprisonment. The law prohibits the defamation of a person or group's belief as a criminal offense punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment. === Religious group registration === The law requires religious groups to register with the Department of Church Affairs in the Ministry of Culture in order to employ spiritual leaders to perform officially recognized functions. Registration also confers the legal status necessary to perform economic functions such as opening a bank account or renting property, and civil functions such as presiding at burial ceremonies. Registered groups and churches receive annual state subsidies. Clergy from unregistered religious groups do not officially have the right to perform weddings or to minister to their members in prisons or government hospitals. Unregistered groups may not establish religious schools or receive government funding. In order to register with the government, a religious group must have at least 50,000 adult members in the country, either citizens or permanent residents, and they must submit an “honest declaration” attesting to their membership, knowledge of the articles of faith and basic tenets of the religion, personal identity numbers and home addresses, and support for the group's registration to the Ministry of Culture. This was requirement increased from a previous requirement of 20,000 in 2017. Of the 18 registered churches and religious groups in Slovakia, only 5 meet the 50,000 member requirement; the rest were registered before the requirement was established. The law requires public broadcasters to allocate airtime for registered religious groups but not for unregistered groups. The 18 registered churches and religious groups are: the Apostolic Church, the Bahai Community, The Brotherhood Unity of Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, Brotherhood Church, Czechoslovak Hussite Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession, Evangelical Methodist Church, Greek Catholic Church, Christian Congregations (Krestanske zbory), Jehovah's Witnesses, New Apostolic Church, Orthodox Church, Reformed Christian Church, Roman Catholic Church, Old Catholic Church, and Central Union of Jewish Religious Communities. A group without the 50,000 adult adherents required to obtain status as an official religious group may seek registration as a civic association, which provides the legal status necessary to carry out activities such as operating a bank account or entering into a contract. In doing so, however, the group may not call itself a church or identify itself officially as a religious group, since the law governing registration of citizen associations specifically excludes religious groups from obtaining this status. In order to register a civic association, three citizens are required to provide their names and addresses and the name, goal organizational structure, executive bodies, and budgetary rules of the group. A concordat with the Holy See provides the legal framework for relations between the government and the domestic Catholic Church and the Holy See. Two corollaries cover the operation of Catholic religious schools, the teaching of Catholic religious education as a subject, and Catholic priests serving as military chaplains. An agreement between the government and 11 of the 17 other registered religious groups provides similar status to those groups. The unanimous approval of the existing parties to the agreement is required for other religious groups to obtain similar benefits. == Government practices == The Department of Church Affairs of the Ministry of Culture oversees relations between religious groups and the state and manages the distribution of state subsidies to religious groups and associations. The ministry may not legally intervene in the internal affairs of religious groups or direct their activities. The government allocates approximately 40 million euros ($48 million) per year in annual state subsidies to the 18 registered religious groups. The basis for each allocation was the number of clergy each group had, and a large portion of each group's subsidy continued to be used for payment of the group's clergy. The Ministry of Culture's cultural grant program allocates money for the upkeep of religious monuments. === Criticism === Members of registered Christian churches have argued that stringent registration requirements limit religious freedom by preventing dissent within churches. Dissenting members stymied in attempts to reform official theological positions might normally split off to form their own church, but the difficulty in registering a new religion prevents such an action. Representatives of the Muslim community have reported that their lack of registration prevented them from formally employing an imam. Prisons and detention facilities prevent Muslim spiritual representatives from gaining access to their adherents. The lack of official registration has made obtaining the necessary construction permits for prayer rooms and religious sites more difficult, although there was no law prohibiting unregistered groups from obtaining such permits. Various members of parliament, including members of both ruling and opposition parties, have made anti-Muslim public comments. Jewish community leaders have criticized the Nation's Memory Institute, a state-chartered institution, for reportedly downplaying the role of prominent World War II-era figures in supporting antisemitic policies. Representatives of the Jewish community stated that members of the ruling Direction – Social Democracy party, as well as L'SNS, made anti-Semitic comments and promoted anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. == Education == All public elementary school students must take a religion or an ethics class, depending on personal or parental preferences. Individual schools and teachers decide what material to teach in each religion class. Although the content of the courses in most schools is Catholicism, parents may ask a school to include teachings of different faiths. Private and religious schools define their own content for religion courses. In both public and private schools, religion class curricula do not mention unregistered groups or some of the smaller registered groups, and unregistered groups may not teach their faiths at schools. Teachers from a registered religious group normally teach about the tenants of their own faith, although they may teach about other faiths as well. The government pays the salaries of religion teachers in public schools. == Societal attitudes == NGOs and unregistered religious groups report that they have had difficulties altering negative public attitudes towards smaller, unregistered religious organizations, because of the social stigma associated with not having the same legal benefits accorded to registered religions. NGOs report that there is significant online hate speech towards Muslims and refugees. Local NGOs have distributed anti-Muslim literature to churches in Slovakia. Representatives of the Muslim community have stated that they live in fear, and that they do not publicize the locations of the prayer rooms so as not to inflame public opinion. In 2018, a man committed a knife attack at a kebab shop in Banska Bystrica while shouting anti-Muslim slurs. He was convicted in 2019 and sentenced to 4 years in prison, reduced from an original charge of 21 years. Some Christian groups and other organizations characterized in the press as far-right have issued statements praising the World War II-era fascist government responsible for the deportation of thousands of Jews to Nazi death camps, and they continued to organize gatherings where participants displayed symbols of the World War II-era fascist First Slovak Republic. According to a 2019 study carried out by the European Commission, 13 percent of Slovakians believe that discrimination based on religion is widespread while 74 percent said that it was rare. 84 percent stated that they would be comfortable with having a head of state that belonged to a religion other than the country's majority religion. A survey conducted by the Public Affairs Institute found that nearly 60 percent of respondents would oppose a Muslim family moving into their neighborhood, and that 17 percent felt similarly about the prospect of a Jewish family moving in. Sociologists and representatives of the Jewish community have stated that they believe anti-Semitic statements to be on the rise as of 2019, citing increases in anti-Semitic vandalism as well as the increasing popularity of the L'SNS. == References == Category:Religion in Slovakia Category:Human rights in Slovakia Slovakia ","title":"Freedom of religion in Slovakia"},{"id":"60302559","text":"Daba Miao Ethnic Township () is an ethnic township for Miao people, which is under the administration of Xingwen County, Sichuan, China. , it has one residential community and 16 villages under its administration. == References == Category:Township-level divisions of Sichuan Category:Xingwen County ","title":"Daba Miao Ethnic Township"},{"id":"60302560","text":"Valentina Cámara (born 18 November 1993) is an Argentine footballer who plays as a defender for Spanish Segunda División Pro club Deportivo Alavés and the Argentina women's national team. ==International career== Cámara made her senior debut for Argentina during the 2018 Copa América Femenina on 5 April that year in a 1–3 loss to Brazil. ==References== Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:People from Río Negro Province Category:Argentine women's footballers Category:Women's association football defenders Category:Club Atlético Belgrano footballers Category:UAI Urquiza (women) players Category:Argentina women's international footballers ","title":"Valentina Cámara"},{"id":"60302630","text":"Ziwe Fumudoh is an American comedian and comic writer based in Brooklyn who is notable for her commentary on politics and race and young adulthood.

Falling into disuse in the 17th century, from 1872 until 1997 the restored building housed the Antwerp Stock Exchange. After further restoration, the building is now part of an events venue that goes by the English name Antwerp Trade Fair. The Royal Exchange, London was modelled on the Antwerp Exchange. ==History== As Antwerp took over the role of trade center from Bruges, it grew into a large metropolis with more than 100,000 inhabitants, including 10,000 foreign merchants, mostly Spaniards and Portuguese. From 1531 the old bourse was given a new building, conceived as a rectangular square with galleries covered on four sides, built on top of a street intersection. For half a century this exchange would be the focal point of European trade and the model for cities with similar ambitions. On the initiative of Thomas Gresham, the representative of the English crown in Antwerp, the Royal Exchange, London was opened in 1565 on this model. It was also called \\"the Bourse\\" until Queen Elizabeth I, after a visit on January 23, 1570, changed its name to the Royal Exchange.British-history.ac.uk: Old and New London: Chapter XLII, The Royal Exchange (Walter Thornbury, 1878) The Middelburg stock exchange was opened in 1592, then Rotterdam in 1595 and Amsterdam in 1611. ==Building== The first building in Brabant's late Gothic style dates from 1531, after a design by Domien de Waghemakere. A rectangular open space was enclosed by a colonnade covered with star and net vaults.J. Denucé, \\"De Beurs van Antwerpen, oorsprong en eerste ontwikkeling, 15e en 16e eeuwen\\", Antwerpsch Archievenblad. Antwerpen, Dienst der Stadsarchieven, 1931, pp. 80-145. The gallery concept of this building served as a model for London's Royal Exchange (designed by Hendrik van Paesschen), as well as for Rotterdam, Amsterdam and Lille.Sonja Anna Meseure (1987), Die Architektur der Antwerpener Börse und der europäische Börsenbau im 19. Jahrhundert, Scaneg, München The high-rise 'pagoda towers' with octagonal and cylindrical hull may have served as a lookout for the harbor. Every nation had a more or less permanent location at the exchange.Joey De Keyser (2007), De visie van vreemdelingen op de Zuidelijke Nederlanden in de late middeleeuwen en de renaissance, Masterproef Universiteit Gent After a fire in 1583, the Bourse was immediately rebuilt to the same plan. The Siege of Antwerp (1584-1585) and the surrender to the 'Spanish' Army of Flanders led to a decline in trade, with Antwerp unable to compete with Amsterdam. Between 1661 and 1810 the building was used, among other things, as a drawing academy and seat of the Guild of Saint Luke.Fiche Handelsbeurs (ID: 6243); Inventaris van het Bouwkundig Erfgoed. Consulted 28 Feb. 2014. The open interior space was domed in 1853 by Charles Marcellis, following the example of London's Crystal Palace. After a second fire in 1858 had once again destroyed the building, the Antwerp city authorities twice organized a design competition in which the old concept had to be preserved. The current building was finally completed in 1872 by architect Joseph Schadde. It is a remarkable combination of the neo- gothic style and revolutionary techniques, in particular the metal construction for the covering of the interior. The building housed the Antwerp Stock Exchange (a true stock exchange) from 1872 until its 1997 merger with the Brussels Stock Exchange. With the closure of the Antwerp Stock Exchange in 1997, the building lost its function and was abandoned and neglected.Handelsbeurs lijdt onder extreme verwaarlozing, Gazet van Antwerpen, 10 June 2011.

He edited several important Hebrew periodicals, and wrote fiction, poetry, essays, feuilletons, literary criticisms, and translations. ==Biography== ===Early life and career=== David Frischmann was born in the town of Zgierz to Shaul and Freida Beila Frischmann. Frischmann's family moved to Lodz when he was two years old, where he received a private education combining Jewish and humanistic studies. Frischmann showed signs of literary talent at a young age, and was considered a prodigy. He published his first article, in Chaim Selig Slonimski's journal Ha-Tsfira, at the age of 16 (written at age 13). He went on to publish articles and poems in Ha-Shachar, Ha-Melitz, and Ha-Yom, and later edited Ha- Dor and Ha-Tkufa. In 1883 he published a Tohu va-Vohu ('Chaos and Emptiness'), a scathing criticism of Hebrew journalistic methods, especially directed against Ha-Melitz. He moved to Warsaw in the mid-1880s, where he wrote Otiyot porḥot ('Flying Letters'), a series of long stories. In 1886, he became an editor of Ha-Yom in St. Petersburg. Between 1895 and 1910 Frischmann studied philology, philosophy and the history of art at the University of Breslau where he befriended Micha Josef Berdyczewski. There he worked on translating works of European literature into Hebrew, among them works by Nietzsche, Pushkin, Eliot, Shakespeare, Baudelaire, and Ibsen. At the same time he worked as a Yiddish journalist for the Warsaw Jewish newspapers Hoys-Fraynd, Der Yud, and Fraynd. He visited the Land of Israel in 1911 and 1912 on behalf of the newspapers Ha-Tzefira and Haynt. Reports from his visits to Israel were collected in the book Sur la terre d'Israël ('On the Land of Israel', 1913), in which he described the landscapes, sacred places, and the revival of the Hebrew language. The impressions gathered there led him to believe in the future of Hebrew as a spoken language, although in his writings he remained faithful to classical Hebrew all his life. Painting of Frischmann (left) and Hayim Nahman Bialik by Leonid Pasternak ===Later life=== Frischmann was imprisoned in Berlin as an enemy alien at the outbreak of the World War I. After a few months he was allowed to return to Poland; he returned to Warsaw and was deported to Odessa by the Russian authorities when the German troops approached in 1915. In Odessa he translated the works of the Brothers Grimm, Tagore, Goethe, Heine, Byron, Wilde, and France, and contributed poetry to the Yiddish magazine Undzer Lebn. He briefly moved to Moscow following the Russian Revolution of 1917, where he became chairman of the editorial board of the Stybel Publishing House. He returned to Warsaw after the Bolsheviks closed the publishing house down in 1919. Frischmann went to Berlin in 1922 to be treated for a serious illness, and died there that year. Eulogies at his funeral were given by Hayim Nahman Bialik, David Bergelson, , and . His last work was a translation of Shakespeare's Coriolanus into Hebrew, which appeared posthumously. ==Works== * Be-Yom Ha-Kipurim ('On the Day of Atonement'), Y.

Alison has her own problems when she supposedly receives a text from Nolan. Caitlin and Dylan find Ava in her room and the two convince her that they all need to stick together. At Nolan's funeral Mona tells Alison that there was a partial Beacon Guard blackout in cell service and that would explain the delayed text from Nolan.

Alison begins suspecting that someone is trying to frame her for Nolan's murder. Caitlin and Dylan look for Nolan's secret stash to find things before his belongings are searched.

Alison meets with Dana who requests to read the essays she assigned over the topic \\"Can murder be justified?\\" just before Nolan's death. Alison returns home and is spooked by Claire who was waiting inside. Mona calls Hanna Marin who informs her that Spencer and Toby have eloped since Mona left Rosewood. Dana interrupts Alison's class and requests to see Caitlin, Dylan, and Ava.

Banerjee received global attention for the Arabari project in West Bengal, India where he introduced the JFM concept for the first time in 1972. ==Early life== Dr. Banerjee was born to Sudha Madhab Banerjee and Utsa Rani Banerjee, in an elite family located at Kalighat. His grand parents were Amrita Banerjee and Tufan Tarangini Debi. He went to Ballygunge Government High School and then graduated from Presidency College, Kolkata. He acquired PhD from University of Toronto. ==Career in Indian Forest Service in West Bengal== The concept of Joint Forest Management was originated by Dr. Ajit K Banerjee. The major hardwood of Arabari is sal, a commercially profitable forest crop. in 1972, Dr. Banerjee, a silviculturalist, then working for the Forest Department as the Divisional Forest Officer in West Bengal, was conducting trials which were constantly being disturbed by grazing and illegal harvesting by the local populace. At the time there were no initiatives for sharing of forest resources between the government and the local people. The forest official, against the suggestions of his co-workers, sought out representatives of eleven local villages and negotiated the terms of a contract with an ad-hoc Forest Protection Committee. The initial program involved 612 families managing 12.7 square kilometers of forests classified as \\"degraded\\". 25% of profits from the forests were shared with the villagers. The Government did not approve the scheme initially, but when International acclamation started reaching in, the JFM was accepted and expanded to other parts of the state during 1987 and onward.. JMM is the official and popular term in India for partnerships in forest movement involving both the state forest departments and local communities. The policies and objectives of Joint Forest Movement are detailed in the Indian comprehensive National Forest Policy of 1988 and the Joint Forest Management Guidelines of 1990 of the Government of India. Although schemes vary from state to state and are known by different names in different Indian languages, usually a village committee known as the Forest Protection Committee (FPC) and the Forest Department enter into a JFM agreement. Villagers agree to assist in the safeguarding of forest resources through protection from fire, grazing, and illegal harvesting in exchange for which they receive non-timber forest products and a share of the revenue from the sale of timber products.Study on Joint Forest Management ==Career== In the mid-1980s, Dr. Banerjee joined the World Bank, and drew attention of the Bank to the success of his innovative project in Medinipur. The Bank funded the West Bengal Social Forestry Project which was restructured in 1987 to include a JFM component. The West Bengal Forest Directorate issued a Circular in 1989 to officially endorse the JFM approach, and in 1990, the government agreed to entitle the FPCs to a quarter of the net profits from the sale of timber. Banerjee acted as a senior forestry specialist in the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the Asia Technical Department of the World Bank. He also acted as a national trustee and chairman of the Eastern Regional Committee of the WWF. He was also president of CEMO, FACE, secretary of the Kolkata chapter of Transparency International, and member of IDSK. ==Legacy== He wrote many books, reports, chapters of books, articles in technical journals as well as in popular News paper articles, etc. Some of the publications of Dr. Ajit Kumar Banerjee are noted below: *Banerjee, A.

Although the Golf reached considerable success in the North American markets, Volkswagen observed the hatchback body style lacked some of the appeal to those who preferred the traditional three- box configuration. The styling of the 1970 AMC Gremlin was controversial for truncating the Hornet sedan, but Volkswagen stylists reversed the process by essentially grafting a new trunk onto the tail of the Golf to produce a larger Jetta saloon. The Jetta became the best-selling European car in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Sales were slower in Europe, but were strong enough for Volkswagen to develop future generations of the Jetta. ==History== Volkswagen Jetta 2-door Volkswagen Jetta 4-door The Jetta was introduced to the world at the 1979 Frankfurt Auto Show. Production of the first generation began in August 1979ETKA at the Wolfsburg plant. In Mexico, the Mark 1 was known as the \\"Volkswagen Atlantic\\". The car was available as a two-door sedan (replacing the aging rear-engined, rear-wheel drive Volkswagen Beetle 2-door sedan in the United States and Canada) and four-door sedan body styles, both of which shared a traditional three-box design. Like the Volkswagen Golf Mk1, its angular styling was penned at ItalDesign, by Giorgetto Giugiaro. Styling differences could be found depending on the market. In most of the world, the car was available with composite headlamps, while in the US, it was only available with rectangular sealed beam lamps due to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108 (FMVSS 108). The suspension setup was identical to the Golf and consisted of a MacPherson strut setup in front and a twist-beam rear suspension. It shared its 2,400 mm (94.5 in) wheelbase with its hatchback counterpart, although overall length was up by 380 millimetres (15 in). The capacity of the luggage compartment was 377 litres (13.3 ft3), making the Jetta reasonably practical. To distinguish the car from the Golf, interiors were made more upscale in all markets. This included velour seating and color coordinated sill to sill carpeting. Engine choices varied considerably depending on the local market. Most were based on 827 engines of the era. Choices in petrol engines ranged from a 1.1 litre four-cylinder engine producing , to a 1.8-litre I4 which made and of torque. Some cars were equipped with carburetors, while others were fuel-injected using K or KE Jetronic supplied by Robert Bosch GmbH. Diesel engine choices included a 1.6-litre making and a turbocharged version of the same engine which produced and of torque. Volkswagen briefly considered producing the Jetta in a plant located in Sterling Heights, Michigan in the US.Robson, p.168 However, due to declining sales in North America, the decision was postponed and abandoned in 1982.Grieger, p. 92 The site was subsequently sold to Chrysler in 1983 and was in operation . This generation was also produced in SFR Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, under the joint venture Tvornica Automobila Sarajevo (TAS) for the Balkan area. ==USA and Canada== In North America, the Jetta was introduced for the 1980 model year. Volkswagen was standardizing their engine lineup and the Jetta received the same 1588 cc four-cylinder with at 5500 rpm as also used in the Scirocco, the Audi 4000, and fuel injected Rabbits. Specs were nearly identical for 49-state and Californian cars, although at torque was one pound-foot lower in 49-state cars. Those received a two-way catalytic converter and exhaust gas recirculation, while the Californian Jettas received a three-way catalyst and lambda sensor. The three-way catalyst electronics system required extra space and replaced the glovebox in early Californian cars.Notchback and trunk variation on a Rabbit theme, p. 196 For 1981, the engine was switched to the new, North America-only 1715 cc unit with at 5000 rpm. The dashboard was also upgraded (including the return of the glovebox on California cars) as were the seats and ventilation system. ==Safety== Volkswagen was an early adopter of passive restraint systems. The first generation cars could be equipped with an \\"automatic\\" shoulder belt mounted to the door. The idea was to always have the belt buckled thereby doing away with the requirement that the driver and passenger remember to buckle up. Instead of a lap belt, the dashboard was designed with an integrated knee bar to prevent submarining underneath the shoulder belt. One quirk was that cars with this system lost the central dash air vents (unless equipped with an AC). The passive system was standard on 1980 California cars but was not available elsewhere in the United States until later. In crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Mark 1 received five out of five stars in a 56 km/h (35 mph) frontal crash test for both driver and passenger protection. ==Testing and review== The first generation was met with generally positive reviews. Testers found the car handled precisely, although the lack of power steering contributed to heavy steering when parking. The brakes worked well for a car of the day, but some brake fade was evident. The ride was taut but firm in the typical style of German cars, with large bumps being well absorbed by the suspension but smaller undulations coming through. Reviews differed on noise levels, some found the car fairly quiet, while others thought the engine contributed to higher noise levels. Critics found the seating comfortable, but noted that the rear seat lacked sufficient head room. Most major controls and displays such as the speedometer and climate controls were well liked, but some secondary switches were not well placed or intuitive. The aforementioned automatic seat belts in some markets that were attached to the door frame made it impossible to forget to buckle the belt, but it was difficult to enter the car with a package in hand. Writers liked that the luggage space was generous, especially for a car of its size. Additionally, numerous storage areas also gave practicality to the sedan. In one test, the car scored nearly as high as the more expensive Volkswagen Passat/Dasher and the Audi 80/4000.CR, p.292 The Volkswagen Atlantic was introduced in the Mexican market in February 1981. The sole competition for the Atlantic in the Mexican market was the Renault 18. The Mark 1 continued to be manufactured and marketed in South Africa after the introduction of the Mark 2, badged as the \\"Fox\\". South African Foxes have the regular Golf front treatment, with round headlamps rather than the square ones used internationally. The Fox, like its CitiGolf sibling, received a facelift around 1990, with bigger, more rounded bumpers and a new grille. The Fox continued to be built until at least 1999.

For the third generation, the Jetta name was discontinued, and it was officially renamed the Volkswagen Vento in European countries, following the precedent of naming cars after winds, debuted in 1992. The Jetta 3 debuted in North America in 1993 after production delays and quality problems at the Volkswagen plant in Puebla, Mexico.Robson, p. 208 The name \\"Vento\\" means \\"wind\\" in both Portuguese and Italian. It went on sale in most of Europe in the first quarter of the year, though it did not arrive on the British market until September 1992. Because of the success of the second generation in North America, Volkswagen decided to keep the Jetta nameplate. However, in Europe the car was given its new name to appeal to a younger market. Styling was penned by a design team led by Herbert Schafer, and again the car became more aerodynamic than the previous generation. Although visually similar to the Mark 2, there were many refinements underneath. The two-door model was dropped, aerodynamics were improved, with the car now having a drag coefficient of 0.32. This included a new structure which now met worldwide crash standards.Robson, p. 202 Suspensions were an evolutionary rather than revolutionary refinement of the setup on previous editions, and mainly consisted of a wider track, and even maintaining backwards compatibility with older models. In addition, the car became more environmentally friendly with the use of recycled plastics, CFC- free air conditioning systems, and paint that did not contain heavy metals. This generation of the car is widely credited for keeping Volkswagen from pulling out of the North American market. At the time of its introduction in 1993, Volkswagen of America's sales hit a low not seen since the 1950s. The division sold only 43,902 cars in that year. Sales began slowly due to the aforementioned issues at the Puebla plant. However, sales rebounded dramatically in the following years, mostly based on the strength of the Jetta, which continued to be the best-selling Volkswagen in the USA.Robson, p. 210 ==Safety== When equipped with dual airbags, the Mark 3 received three out of five stars in a 56 km/h (35 mph) frontal crash test carried out by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In a 64 km/h (40 mph) frontal offset crash test conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the car received a score of \\"Marginal\\". ==Testing and review== Newly available on the third generation was Volkswagen Group's 1.9 litre Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engine. Fuel economy was a strong point with ratings of urban cycle and extra urban. In top trim lines, the 2.8-litre VR6 DOHC six- cylinder engine was available. In one car magazine's test, the power plant was able to accelerate the car from 0 to 97 km/h (60 mph) in 6.9 seconds. Reviews were generally positive, with testers praising the crisp handling and comfortable ride, as well as a greater level of refinement compared with the previous generation. However, some reviews noted that the more sporty suspension tuning found in some trims made the car bouncy, especially on the expressway. The manual transmission shifted crisply; however, the automatic transmission reduced acceleration noticeably. Some critics complained that the controls had some quirks, including a cryptic windshield wiper control, where the \\"off\\" position was unfittingly placed between the \\"intermittent\\" and \\"continuous\\" modes. If equipped, power window controls had the unusual arrangement of the front buttons located on the door, while the rear buttons were located on the center console. As with previous generations, the luggage compartment provided generous space. In earlier build cars, the glove compartment was deleted if the car was equipped with dual airbags, and in the later models (when airbags became standard equipment), the glove compartment was small and could barely hold the owner's manual and a folding paper map. There were also some complaints about the lack of cup holders in the earlier cars, as well as the lack of a safety interlock which would require the driver to press the clutch pedal prior to starting the car. The 1994 through 1996 models of the Jetta had some electrical issues causing the car not to start and shorting to occur in some of the electrical devices due to a non existent plastic V underneath the windshield, which was added in later models to divert rain water flowing to the electrical box. The catastrophe of this glitch can be avoided by removing leaves and debris that have accumulated below the windshield and by installing adhesive weather sealant linings underneath the plastic cover directly onto the windshield. Another major complaint was that the North American TDI model was not rated to tow a trailer, which, according to the owner's manual, is \\"for technical reasons.\\" Contrary to the American market, The European TDI model, which has an identical power train and chassis, was rated to tow a trailer according to the owner's manual. Many North American TDI owners speculated that Volkswagen decided not to risk liability issues on the American market, and some owners disregarded the owner's manual and installed hitches on their vehicles. Owners argue that the diesel engine delivers superior towing performance compared to a gasoline engine. ==Specifications== { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\\" !

The fifth generation debuted at the Los Angeles Auto Show on 5 January 2005. After the New Beetle, it was the second Volkswagen product to make its world debut at a U.S. auto show. The Mark 5 sedan went on sale in the USA prior to any other country, reflecting the importance of the car in that market for Volkswagen. VW spent US$800 million to upgrade its Puebla facilities for this model's production. This included a US$290 million new engine production line for the 5-cylinder power plant, a US$50 million investment in the press shop, as well as a US$200 million purchase of 460 robots, which increased automation by 80%. Although produced in the largest volumes in Mexico, final assembly of the car also takes place in China and South Africa for those respective markets. Like initial production of the second generation in China, the Asian and African plants build the car from a complete knock down (CKD) kit shipped from the factory in Puebla. Local assembly in Kaluga, Russia, started in early 2008. Production also began in India in 2008. Currently, the Škoda factory in Aurangabad is used for final assembly. As with the previously mentioned assembly plants, CKD kits from Volkswagen de México will be used. In most countries, the fifth generation is marketed as the Jetta. Exceptions to this include \\"Bora\\" in Mexico and Colombia, \\"Vento\\" in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, and \\"Sagitar\\" in China. The Mark 5 is longer, wider, and has a longer wheelbase than the previous iteration. Interior room has increased from 2.46 cubic metres (87 cu ft) to 2.58 cubic metres (91 cu ft). In particular, rear legroom was increased by over the fourth generation. Luggage compartment volume is up to 453 litres (16 cu ft). One major change is the introduction of the first multi-link independent rear suspension in a Jetta. The design of the rear suspension is nearly identical to the one found in the Ford Focus. Volkswagen reportedly hired engineers from Ford who designed the suspension on the Focus. Styling reflects a new direction for the Volkswagen brand, with a new chrome front grille, first seen on the Volkswagen Golf Mk5 R32, which has spread to other models. Some critics appreciated the new styling, whilst others dismissed it as just as bland as the 4th generation. For model year 2009, certain markets saw a new base model internal combustion engine and automatic transmission. The previous 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine, and six- speed automatic transmission, were replaced with a smaller, more powerful, and more fuel efficient, 1.4-litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine, and six- speed DSG transmission (the same as used in the new Golf Mk5). As a result of the change, fuel consumption has been improved (by 17% for the manual, from down to ), and 23% for the automatic, from down to . Power has increased 7%, from , to , while torque is up 20%. In addition, acceleration times 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) have improved, from 9.2 s to 8.5 s for the manual (an 8% improvement), and from 9.9 s to 8.5 s for the automatic (a 14% improvement). ==Features== Volkswagen Jetta Mk5 (Rear) The body of the fifth generation used extensive high strength steel, and use of laser welding is up from 5% to 35% of body parts. This resulted in double-digit increases in both dynamic and torsional rigidity. Other body innovations include an impact-absorbing front bumper which yields slightly in the event of a collision with a pedestrian, reducing the chance of injury. A new door design allows just the outer panel to be removed and replaced if damaged, rather than the entire door.Volkswagen Academy, 891403, p. 14 Safety was again enhanced with many active and passive features available or standard. These included side curtain airbags, seat- mounted rear side airbags, new generation Electronic Stability Programme with Anti-Slip Regulation and Brake assist, as well as active head restraints. A Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG) transmission, available dual-zone automatic climate control, and electro-mechanical power steering are also new innovations. Halogen headlamp showing the bulb shield incorporating the VW logo The fifth generation car has a totally redesigned electrical system. Control modules are used for everything from the radio to the powertrain, transmitting over Controller Area Network (CAN) buses. Transmission of signals is done digitally at 500 kilobits per second, which reduces the number of wires needed, and thus reduces the chance for faults. Cars equipped with halogen headlamps have a 'VW' logo integrated into the bulb shield. In most of the world, the rear lights use light-emitting diodes (LEDs). However, in North America, standard filament bulbs with a different design are used to comply with FMVSS 108. Volkswagen has developed a very strict motor oil quality standard, oil meeting this standard must be used to ensure full warranty coverage. ==Engines== Volkswagen 2.5 L engine The internal combustion engines available are dependent on the destination market. In Europe, a range of the new generation Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) engines are available. Additionally in that market, the car can be had with an engine known as the 'Twincharger'. This 1.4 litre petrol engine combines turbo- and supercharging, to make a small but powerful engine with low fuel consumption. The Jetta available in the Americas and the Middle East is powered by a 2.5-litre 5-cylinder 20-valve engine in most trims. This engine shares its cylinder head design with the V10 engine found in the Lamborghini Gallardo and Audi R8. When the Mark 5 Jetta was introduced, the Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engine was not offered in five U.S. States due to the tight emission standards promulgated by the California Air Resources Board. In addition to California, four other states adopted the more stringent California standards. Where it was available, it fell into the least-restrictive emission category. That category was removed in 2007, prompting the diesel Jetta to be unavailable for more than a year until the introduction of a new common rail diesel engine, which appeared in August 2008. The introduction was delayed for approximately six months due to technical issues with the new emissions control system. The TDI Clean Diesel engine is rated , and uses advanced features such as a diesel particulate filter and NOx-storage catalyst (vs. AdBlue) to reduce NOx in order to qualify as a Tier II Bin 5 vehicle (equivalent to California's LEV II rating), and thereby allowing it to be sold in all 50 U.S. states. AdBlue (urea injection fluid) is not required, further reducing maintenance requirements. In 2015 it was found that this engine's emissions had been falsified. In the U.S., in August 2010, it was reported that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was investigating 37,889 2009 Jetta TDI's regarding a stalling problem. There were complaints to the agency about the Jettas going into \\"limp-home\\" mode and then stalling almost immediately while being driven. Motor Trend reported that there were also complaints about premature failures of its high-pressure fuel pump. ==Safety== A 2005 Jetta crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash testing the Jetta received an overall \\"Good\\" rating in both front offset and side impact tests. In the side impact test the Jetta received \\"Good\\" marks in all nine measured categories. In 2005, the Institute noted that the side impact protection performance was the best they had ever rated. In 2006, the car received a \\"Top Safety Pick\\" award from the Institute. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the fifth generation Jetta for both driver and passenger protection in a frontal impact, while the car received stars in a side impact crash test. To tout the safety of the car, a series of television commercials with the tag line \\"Safe happens\\" showed the car being involved in a collision whilst afterward the occupants are shown to have emerged unscathed. The VW Jetta received the maximum 5 stars in the China NCAP crash tests. ==Testing and review== Volkswagen Jetta GLI Fahrenheit (US) The fifth generation received generally positive reviews with some reviewers complaining the car lost some of its character with the redesign. Most reviewers found the ride to be firm and well controlled, but not always as forgiving as the previous generation. Handling was a strong point, with quick and precise steering and minimal body roll due to the MacPherson Strut suspension up front. Fit and finish received excellent marks, with reviewers noting the car felt very upscale. The front seats were firm but well liked, and the rear seat was roomy, in contrast to the cramped quarters in the fourth generation. Controls and displays were decent, but fell apart and started shorting out with age. Reviewers were particularly impressed with the \\"Sportline\\" models (known as the GLI in North America). Equipped with sport seats, a firmer suspension lowered by , and low profile tyres, critics praised the excellent handling that was an improvement over the already good performance on the standard model. Additionally, the 2.0 Turbo FSI engine also won commendation for its high power figures, smooth operation, and low fuel consumption. Along with its hatchback brethren, the fifth generation ranks among the top cars on the market in independent reviews of resale value. Although improved over the fourth generation, the Mark 5 still took over 42 hours to assemble at the factory in Mexico. Part of this disparity is blamed on the switch to the more complex independent rear suspension. Volkswagen has publicly stated its discontent over the excessive assembly time, and pledged to streamline manufacturing in the next generation of A platform cars. In the interim, Volkswagen de México is making a concerted effort to further increase productivity at the plant by consulting outside experts from Toyota and other Japanese companies. By implementing many lean manufacturing principles and techniques, a goal has been set to increase productivity levels at the factory by 30% or more in the coming years. ==Engine specifications== VW engine in Jetta 2.0 TDI (PD) DPF { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"text-align:center; font- size:91%;\\" !

VW marketed the station wagon as the Jetta SportWagen in the United States, Bora Sportwagen in Mexico, Golf Break and later Golf SW in France, Jetta Variant in Brazil, Vento Variant in Argentina, Jetta Wagon in Canada (2009 only), Golf Wagon in Canada (2010 onwards), Golf Estate in the United Kingdom and Golf Variant in the German domestic and most other markets. In 2010, the Sportwagen received a minor interior and exterior facelift, and remained based on the fifth-generation Golf, with front end styling mirroring the sixth-generation Golf. ==2010 Jetta TDI Cup \\"Street\\" edition== It is a version commemorating the 2008+ Jetta TDI Cup Race series, the last year of the Mk V, and based on the TDI Clean Diesel sedan. The same and of torque diesel motor is supplied, but the package includes GLI brakes, suspension, and sway bars. Additional upgrades from the base TDI are \\"TDI Cup Edition\\" body side stickers, 18 inch wheels with Pirelli P-Zero or Yokohama ADVAN 225/40R18 sport tires, aluminium pedals, leather-wrapped steering wheel, chrome door linings, aerodynamic body kit (front, side & rear), an Interlagos cloth interior with heated sport seats, short shifter, faux carbon fiber inlays (as opposed to metallic), and a black interior (headliner/doorcards/dash). It can be purchased with either a 6-speed Manual or DSG transmission (DSG includes paddle shifters), and a \\"Thunderbunny\\" body kit is optional (and available from VW only on the Cup edition). The vehicle was unveiled in the 2008 SEMA Show. The production version went on sale in January 2010 with a base MSRP of $24,990USD (not including destination or options). Per VW North America, worldwide only 1,501 Jetta TDI Cup Editions were produced; 588 were manufactured with a manual transmission, and 913 were built with DSG transmissions.

The sixth- generation Volkswagen Jetta, known as the NCS (New Compact Sedan) during its development, was announced in the North American market on 16 June 2010. The new model was larger and less expensive to manufacture than the previous generation making the vehicle more competitive against rivals such as the Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic and Nissan Sentra as part of Volkswagen's goal of reaching sales of 800,000 units in the North American market by 2018. Production of the vehicle is at Volkswagen's Puebla, Mexico, facility. The sixth generation Volkswagen Jetta was primarily designed by Volkswagen Mexico under the supervision of Volkswagen Germany and 70% of the parts are designed and manufactured in Mexico. The 2013 Volkswagen Jetta Hybrid unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show. Although no longer sharing any body panels with the Golf and having a longer wheelbase, this generation was partly based on the same PQ35 platform. Volkswagen's target of increasing its North American sales removed the Jetta from the premium compact car market. This forced many cost-cutting measures to be made for the North American models, which included a lower quality trim material for the interior and the replacement of leather with leatherette as an optional seating upholstery. Leather was still available on Canadian-spec models. The North American version also lost the multi-link rear suspension of the previous generation on lower-end models until the 2015 model year. Engines from the MK5 Jetta carried over included the 127 kW (170 hp; 177 PS) 2.5 L (five-cylinder) as well as the economy-minded 104 kW (140 hp; 142 PS) 2.0 TDI (diesel) engine. A Turbo Hybrid, 1.4 L TSI intercooled turbocharged engine mated with a electric motor providing a combined and became available in 2013, due to Hybrid popularity in North America. Additionally, the SEL Premium model retains the upscale soft touch interior, as well as the multi-link independent rear suspension found on the GLI, though softened for a more comfortable ride. It also has as standard a 6-speed sequential manual DSG gearbox, with Sport and Tiptronic modes. The Jetta Turbo Hybrid has an estimated combined fuel economy of . The 2013 Volkswagen Jetta Turbo Hybrid was unveiled in January 2012 at the North American International Auto Show. In North America, the base model (S in the US, Trendline in Canada) received a 2.0-liter 8-valve four-cylinder engine with and torque. Sales of the 2013 model year Jetta Turbo Hybrid are scheduled to begin in the U.S. by late 2012. From model year 2016 onward, American S and SE models, and Canadian models Trendline and Comfortline Jettas would receive a 1.4 liter turbocharged engine that produces and of torque. This engine replaced the 2.0-litre in those markets. New for 2014, VW is replacing the 2.5 L inline 5 with the new 1.8 L TSI turbo-charged 4 cylinder. Based on VW's EA888 platform, the 1.8 TSI is listed as one of Ward's 10 Best Engines for 2014, producing and of torque, all while achieving an EPA rating of 25 MPG city / 36 MPG highway. Other updates for 2014 include an independent multilink rear suspension as found in European counterparts, and electronic power steering (1.8 TSI models only.) In Europe, the engine range consists of the 1.2 TSI, 1.4 TSI (122 or 160 PS), 2.0 TSI, 1.6 TDI and 2.0 TDI engines. The European version will differ in some respects, particularly in having multi- link suspension at the rear. The European version will also incorporate soft- touch plastics on most of the dashboard (not the doors for this generation), and the rear seat center air vents have been restored. For the 2015 model year, Volkswagen made numerous improvements to the Jetta such as new front and rear fascias, headlights, reworked interior, fully independent suspension for all US models, a suite of driver-assistance systems such as blind spot monitoring, cross traffic alert, and standard rearview camera. The sixth- generation Jetta went on sale on 22 July 2010 in Mexico, thus becoming one of the only countries in the world where both the fourth (sold as the Volkswagen Clásico), and sixth generation Jetta were available simultaneously. (Both models are also both available in Colombia and Argentina). The sixth generation Jetta replaced the fifth, known in Mexico as the Volkswagen Bora. A special edition called the \\"Volkswagen Jetta Edición Especial Bicentenario\\" and approved by the Mexican Federal Government commemorates that country's 200th anniversary of the beginning of the Mexican War of Independence, on 16 September 1810. It is also the first car in Mexico with granted permission to use an official government logo (a \\"2010\\" plaque). It was launched in India on 17 August 2011. Volkswagen launched the 2015 Jetta facelift in the Indian car market on 17 February 2015. The sedan came with a Completely Knocked Down (CKD) kit, and is locally assembled at Volkswagen's Chakan factory, near Pune. It was launched in Australia and South Africa in September 2011. The revised 2015 Jetta has secured the highest ratings from most of the key crash testing agencies across the world: Top pick+ in IIHS, 5 stars in NHTSA, 5 stars each in Euro NCAP and Australian NCAP. In 2016, the Hybrid model was discontinued from the U.S Market and was replaced by a new 1.4 engine replaced the TDI and hybrid models. This was the last model produced in the UK as of November 2017 after 379 models were sold between 1 January and 1 October 2017. Orders closed in September 2017. In January 2018, Volkswagen axed the Jetta in Europe as sales fell by a quarter in 2017 with just over 5,000 units being sold all year. Sales slipped in the US by 4.4%. ==Chinese market== Volkswagen Sagitar II For China, this generation Jetta entered the market in March 2012 as the Sagitar and became popular in sales, reaching 271,000 cars sold in 2013, followed by 300,000 in 2014, nearly 280,000 in 2015, 341,000 in 2016 and 327,000 in 2017. The Sagitar was available with the 1.4 litre turbo and 1.6 litre engine paired with a 5 speed manual gearbox for both engines, 6 speed automatic gearbox for 1.6 models and 7 speed dual clutch for 1.4 models. 1.8 TSI models were available for 2014 followed by the 2.0 litre TSI for 2016 and 1.2 TSI for 2017 and 2018. Current models for sale on the FAW-Volkswagen website consist of the 1.6 Comfort, 1.6 Fashion, 180TSI, 280TSI Comfort, 280TSI Luxury and 280TSI Flagship. Other trim levels consist of the Sagitar GLi and Sagitar R-Line which are available with the 2.0 litre TSI engine and 6 speed DSG and 1.4 litre turbo with 7 speed dual clutch gearbox. Pricing for the Sagitar currently ranges between 131,800 and 218,800 yuan (19,610 to 32,560 USD). For horsepower ratings, the 1.2 litre engine produces 81 kw (110 hp) which is also shared with 1.6 litre engine, the 1.4 litre turbocharged engine produces 110 kw (148 hp) and the 2.0 litre TSI known as EA888 produces 147 kw (197 hp). The EA211 engine is powered in newer Volkswagen models for the Chinese market from 2013 onwards which consist of the Volkswagen Bora, Volkswagen Jetta Night, Volkswagen Lavida, Volkswagen Lamando and the Volkswagen New Santana all assembled by SAIC VW of Shanghai and FAW VW of Changchun. Chinese production for this generation Sagitar ended in September 2019. ==Jetta GLI== The Jetta GLI, a sedan version of the Golf GTI based on the new Jetta, was revealed at the 2011 Chicago Auto Show with the 2.0 TSI 200 hp engine and a fully independent suspension, as well as the European Jetta's soft touch materials. A black honeycomb grill, aggressive lower intakes, side adorning foglights, smoked taillights, dual tailpipes, red painted calipers, and red stitching are all elements to separate it from its run-of-the-mill counterpart. The GLI, as well as the Jetta TDI, are the only two trims to receive Volkswagen's 6-speed manual transmission as well as the optional 6-speed DSG gearbox. GLI models feature a sport suspension that rides 0.6 inches lower than other Jetta models and the XDS® Cross Differential System. ===Jetta GLI Edition 30 (2014)=== Including Edition 30 and the Edition 30 with Navigation, they are versions of 2014 Jetta GLI commemorating the 30th anniversary of Jetta GLI in the US market. Changes include 18-inch \\"Laguna\\" aluminum-alloy wheels, red trim on the front grille, a trunklid-mounted spoiler, Edition 30 badging, Bi-Xenon headlights (Edition 30 with Navigation), contrasting color V-Tex leatherette seats with red accents; red contrast stitching on the steering wheel, shifter, brake lever, and armrests; carbon- look trim inlays; Edition 30 kickplates; floormats with red stitching, Choice of four body colors (Deep Black Metallic, Pure White, Tornado Red, and Reflex Silver Metallic). The vehicle was set to go on sale in 2014. ==Jetta 1.8T Sport (2015–2017)== In 2015 Volkswagen offered a limited-edition Jetta Sport in the US market. Based on the 1.8T SE with Connectivity (minus the sunroof), this trim adds a sport suspension, RNS 315 navigation with rearview camera, 17-inch \\"Joda Black\\" alloy wheels; two-tone heatable sport seats; foglights; black headliner; contrast stitching on leather-wrapped steering wheel, seats, handbrake and shift lever; rear spoiler. It is available in a five-speed manual and six-speed automatic transmission. Choice of four body colors (Black, Pure White, Tornado Red, and Platinum Grey Metallic) In 2016 the radio was upgraded to a 6.3\\" screen MIB II unit with no other change to the car. A lighting package similar to the GLI is an available option which includes High-intensity Bi-Xenon headlights with LED Daytime Running Lights and an Adaptive Front-lighting System along with interior ambient lighting. The Sport and GLI models feature a sport suspension that rides 0.6 inches lower than other Jetta models. 2017 was the last year Volkswagen offered this trim with its sport tuned suspension. ==References== ==External links== Category:Compact cars Category:Euro NCAP small family cars Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Sedans Category:Cars introduced in 2010 Jetta 6 ","title":"Volkswagen Jetta (A6)"},{"id":"60303279","text":"Maria Bittner is Professor Emerita in Linguistics at Rutgers University.

Balindong (born January 1, 1940) is a Filipino lawyer and politician. He is the current Speaker of the Bangsamoro Parliament. He is also a former Deputy Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives and a member of the 1971 Philippine Constitutional Convention. == Early life == Born in Pualas, Lanao del Sur on January 1, 1940, Balindong is the eldest son of Sultan Amer Macaorao Balindong, former mayor of the Municipality of Malabang, and Hajjatu Maimona Marohom Balindong. He studied at the Malabang Central Elementary School and graduated in 1954. He then went to Our Lady of Peace High School and graduated in 1958. He took up Bachelor of Arts Major in Political Science at the Manuel L. Quezon University and graduated in 1962. He studied law at the same university and graduated in 1966 with a Bachelor of Laws degree(LL.B.). He pursued further studies later and earned his Master of Public Administration degree from Mindanao State University. ==Career == Balindong engaged in private legal practice and served as legal counsel for the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) which works for peace initiatives with the government. In 1971, he joined the Philippine Constitutional Convention representing the Lone District of Lanao del Sur. He started his political career when he held the post of Assemblyman from 1990 to 1993 representing the 2nd District of Lanao del Sur and was elected as Speaker of the Regional Legislative Assemblyman of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) between 1991 and 1993. In 1995, he ran and was elected as the congressional representative of the 2nd District of Lanao del Sur during the 10th Congress. He ran again in 2007 and became a member of the 14th, 15th, and 16th Congresses of the House of Representatives. In 2013, he rose to the Deputy Speaker post of the House of Representatives until 2016. In 2018, under Executive Order 10, Balindong was appointed by President Rodrigo Duterte as a member of the 25-member Consultative Committee to Review the 1987 Philippine Constitution. A committee composed of former government officials, veteran lawyers, and academicians which were tasked by the President to craft a Federal constitution. ==Key legislation== === Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) === For most of his political life, Balindong advocated the age-old quest for self-determination of the Filipino-Muslims in Mindanao. He introduced and authored the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), which was later renamed the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), in the 16th Congress. During a privilege speech, he stated that he has always believed that this is essential in ushering unity in Mindanao and the entire country, where Filipino Muslims, Christians, Lumads, and virtually all sectors of the Filipino society could live in harmony, peace, and inclusive prosperity. This to him will mark the end of the 400-year struggle for independence and at the same guarantee every Muslim's right to life, property, and prosperity. Under succeeding president Rodrigo R. Duterte. The BOL was ratified by the Philippine Senate on July 23, 2018, and House of Representatives on July 24, 2018, and signed into law by President Duterte on July 26, 2018, establishing the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region to replace the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. === The Moro History, Culture and Identity Studies Act === House Bill No. 4832 or “The Moro History, Culture and Identity Studies Act” which mandates the teaching of Moro history, culture, and identity in the higher education curriculum in the entire country. This bill has already passed the House of Representatives. Balindong sees the need to highlight the ethnicity, shared origins or commonalities between Muslims and non-Muslims in order to foster respect and positive relationships between minority and majority groups. He said, “While Filipino and Muslim cultures may have differences, it is a fact that they are bound by a common heritage, the land they call the Philippines, and they have a lot in common, on top of which, is the clamor for peace.” Though Filipino and Muslim cultures have differences, peace is attainable through understanding, respect, and tolerance for cultural and religious diversities. === National Commission on Muslim Filipinos Act === Another vital legislative initiative Balindong sponsored is the Republic Act No 9997, also known as the “National Commission on Muslim Filipinos Act of 2009” which was enacted into law on February 8, 2010. This act created the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) headed by The Commission, mandated to preserve and develop the culture, tradition, institutions, and well-being of Muslim Filipinos in conformity with the country's laws and in consonance with national unity and development. === House Bill No. 1447 === Balindong filed and lobbied for House Bill No. 1447, which prohibits the use of the words “Muslim” or “Christian” in mass media to describe any person suspected of or convicted for committing criminal or unlawful actions. He argued if the media puts labels on suspects and convicted criminals regarding their nationality, ethnicity, and religious affiliation it fosters negative bias to people who shares their affiliation, affecting the collective image of such groups. He cites that there is negative reception whenever other countries branded a housemaid as Pinay for the simple reason that there are so many Filipino women workers working as maids. “Why then is our media doing the same to our Muslim countrymen? Indeed, our Muslim brothers are a minority among the Filipino majority, but should be treated with the same respect and privileges as any other Batangueño, Visayan or other Filipino citizens.” === Synchronized National and Local Elections Act === This Act synchronizes ARMM elections with the national elections which started with the 2013 elections. == Principles and Ideals == In one of his privilege speeches he said, “If some sector of society stands in the way of peace and progress, something must be done to make them toe the line. Being at odds with one another is not contributing to progress despite the claim of economic gains brought about by the appreciation of the Peso.” He added that whatever it is that something must be given, it must be sincere so that there would be no need to go back every now and then to the negotiating table, thus, there will no longer have reason to fight each other again. “Unity must not be dictated. The unity needed must come from the Moro, and not dictated by somebody else but by the events of the day.” Balindong believes in the power of elixir of eternal youth, and that is found in obedience to the principles of the Qur'an and love of service. When he decided to run for the Provincial Governor position, he looked at it not as a personal or political ambition, but an extension of his desire to continue serving the people and his beloved Philippines. To him, public service is not as a job or work; it is a way of life. Balindong, having gone through the crucibles of life, both personal and professional, acknowledges that experience is the best teacher of life. With such principles, he deserves without a doubt to continue serving the people and will continue to serve in whatever capacity he can. When the BBL failed to pass into law, Balindong lamented it because the next generation will inherit the vicious cycle of war and peace and all efforts, public hearings, and debates were all thrown into the wastebasket. ==References== Category:1940 births Category:People from Lanao del Sur Category:Members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament Category:Members of the House of Representatives of the Philippines from Lanao del Sur Category:Living people Category:Filipino Muslims ","title":"Pangalian Balindong"},{"id":"60303387","text":"p-Phenetidine (4-ethoxyaniline) is a chemical compound with the molecular formula C8H11NO.

In 1889, Elena and her siblings embarked on a tour of Europe with their mother, Julia Makowsky, which included trips to Venice, Florence, Nice and other places, and to which Luksch-Makowsky would later credit her ability with languages and fluency in English, French, and German. Although Makowsky's childhood included training for her assumed future as wife, mother and homemaker, her father acknowledged and encouraged her artistic talents. Ver Sacrum, 1901. Between 1894 and 1896, Makowsky studied with Ilya Repin at the St. Petersburg Academy, where she won a scholarship to study with Anton Ažbe in Munich. From Munich, Makowsky had a studio in Dutenhofen northeast of Dachau, where she met her future husband, the Viennese sculptor Richard Luksch, in 1900. She accepted Luksch's proposal with the promise that should be able to return to Russia at any time, and would continue to work as an independent artist. Their son, Peter Luksch, was born in 1901. Luksch-Makowsky moved to Vienna shortly after her marriage, and regularly exhibited with the Vienna Secessionists until they split in 1905. She was the only woman artist with a monogram within the group, but was not granted voting rights. In 1902, Lucsch-Makowsky was featured prominently in the 14th Vienna Secession exhibition, also known at the Beethoven exhibition. In 1903, she contributed color woodcuts to a special issue of Ver Sacrum. During her time in Vienna she also worked for the Wiener Werkstätte and designed three reliefs for the main façade of the Burgtheater, as well as two of her most prominent works, Adolescentia and Ver Sacrum. In 1907, the Lukschs moved to Hamburg after Richard Luksch was made a professor at the School of Arts and Crafts. it was there that Luksch-Makowsky began work on her sculpture, Frauenschicksal (Woman's Fate), which art historians have suggested foreshadows her struggle as a single parent. Indeed, when she and Luksch divorced in 1921 she was left to support her three sons on her own. Her ability to support her family was an issue throughout the rest of her life, although she did accept commissions under the Reichskammer der Bildenden Kunste (Reich Chamber of Fine Arts). Following the Second World War, her artistic work was primarily focused on religious iconography and decoration for the Russian Orthodox congregation in Hamburg. Her work was included in the 2019 exhibition City Of Women: Female artists in Vienna from 1900 to 1938 at the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere. == References == Category:1878 births Category:1967 deaths Category:19th-century Russian painters category:20th- century Russian painters Category:19th-century Russian sculptors Category:20th-century Russian sculptors Category:Painters from Saint Petersburg category:Russian women sculptors ","title":"Elena Luksch-Makowsky"},{"id":"60303422","text":"A portrait of Ranković-Toza Svetozar Ranković-Toza (; 1880 - November or December 1914) was Serbian Chetnik soldier and voivode during the struggle for Macedonia, the Balkan Wars and World War I.

Innocent claimed that the Crusade offered an opportunity for salvation: \\"[H]ow many, converted to penitence, have handed themselves over by service of the Crucified for the liberation of the Holy Land, as is by suffering martyrdom they have obtained the crown of glory, who would perhaps have perished in their iniquities entangled in carnal desires and earthly seductions.

He co-founded and was the founder, chairman and CEO of five companies including American Tower, American Radio Systems, American Cablesystems, Windover Development, and Beverly Crossing. Dodge was inducted into the Academy of Distinguished Entrepreneurs at Babson College in 2002 and the Mobile Infrastructure Hall of Fame in November 2018. Throughout his career he served on numerous boards, including Sotheby’s, The Cabot (Beverly, Massachusetts), the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Endicott College, and Montserrat College of Art. Dodge died in Bonita Springs, Florida, after being struck by a vehicle while crossing a road with his bicycle. At the time of his death, Deborah Parenti, publisher of the trade journal Radio Ink, wrote that Dodge was \\"an extraordinary human being who made people proud of their work.” The Boston Globe added that he was “a serial entrepreneur en route to becoming one of Greater Boston’s most successful businessmen.” ==Early life== Dodge was born in New Haven, Connecticut, to Nelson Dodge, a sales executive, and Betsy (Adams) Dodge, an artist. The senior Mr. Dodge died when Steve was 9. His mother married Donald Bradley (The Hotchkiss School, 1925), a banker, and the family moved to Cheshire, Connecticut. Dodge graduated from Hotchkiss (1963) and from Yale University (1967) with a degree in English. He attended Navy Officer Candidate School in Newport, Rhode Island, and served the Navy for four years, most of his time aboard a destroyer, rising in rank to lieutenant and chief engineer. “I did more learning and growing up in the Navy than anywhere else—before or since,” Dodge said in a 2018 interview. “Actions produced tangible outcomes that mattered, and working hard became a habit.” ==Career== ===Bank of Boston=== Back in civilian life, Dodge joined the Bank of Boston in the commercial loan officer training program. Selected from the program by bank executive William L. Brown, Dodge was asked to research and later lend to a new industry, cable-TV. “I fell in love with it,” Dodge said. He became the senior lender for the bank on the Continental Cablevision account, among others. He enjoyed commercial lending but said, “I wasn’t cut out to work for other people for very long.\\" His exposure to the cable TV industry and its players \\"convinced me that they were just normal guys, not that formidable.” Dodge decided to leave the bank to launch his own cable company. ===American Cablesystems Corporation=== In 1978 Dodge founded American Cablesystems Corporation (ACS), initially headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, moving to Beverly, Massachusetts, in 1983. ACS built and operated cable franchises in Massachusetts, New York, Florida, California, Illinois, West Virginia, Virginia, and Tennessee. Dodge was Chairman and CEO from the company’s founding until its sale in 1988. He found it challenging, saying, \\"All of a sudden, I had to learn to buy paper clips and do payroll.” The company’s initial public offering was in May 1986 and priced at $14.50 share price (AMEX:ACN). In October 1987, ACS signed a definitive merger agreement with Continental Cablevision for a per subscriber price of $2,100 and a per share price of $46.50. The transaction, valued at $723 million ($473 million equity plus the assumption of debt), closed in February 1988. ===American Radio Systems Corporation=== In February 1988, Dodge founded Atlantic Ventures (later Atlantic Radio L.P.) with a small team from American Cablesystems, led by executives Eric Schultz, Joseph Winn, and Michael Milsom. Atlantic purchased radio stations in Boston, Rochester, and Syracuse, New York, and Burlington, Vermont. By 1993 Atlantic had sold all of its stations except Boston, where the company owned Mix 98.5, Eagle 93.7, WEEI, and WRKO. On November 1, 1993, Atlantic merged with Multi Market Communications, Inc. and Stoner Broadcasting System Holding, Inc., forming American Radio Systems Corporation (American Radio) with Dodge as Chairman, President and CEO, Winn as CFO and Director, and David Pearlman and John Gehron, and later Don Bouloukis, as co-chief operating officers until its merger with CBS Corporation in 1998. In June 1995, American Radio completed an initial public offering at $16.50 per share, with proceeds of $70.4 million. By the end of 1995 the Company owned 24 radio stations in eight markets. In April 1997, the Company merged with EZ Communications, adding 24 radio stations in eight markets, for an aggregate purchase price (including assumed debt) of $830 million. By the end of 1997, the Company owned 100 radio stations in 21 markets, and had also acquired 760 wireless communications sites. ARS became the country’s fourth-largest radio group. Dodge was on Radio Ink‘s “40 Most Powerful People in Radio” list in 1996 (at #7) and 1997 (#6). In June 1998, American Radio became a wholly owned subsidiary of CBS Corporation pursuant to a merger agreement. American Radio shareholders received $44.00 per share plus one share of American Tower (NYSE:AMT) common stock in a transaction valued at a then-record enterprise price of over $2.6 billion. ===American Tower Corporation=== While operating American Radio in 1995, Dodge recognized the opportunity in the wireless-communications site industry. ARS owned towers and wireless companies began approaching it for space. “It seemed obvious to me that wireless was coming,\\" Dodge said, \\"so we started building new towers to see what kind of business they might attract.” In July 1995, American Radio organized American Tower Systems Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary. When the early towers filled quickly and became profitable, Dodge added, \\"We knew we were onto something. . . .” On June 4, 1998, American Tower Corporation became a standalone public company (NYSE:AMT). Dodge was Chairman, President, and CEO of American Tower Corporation from its founding until 2004. In 1998, American Tower Systems Inc. merged with its competitor, American Tower Corporation, and acquired Gearon & Co., Inc. At the end of 1998 American Tower operated 3,200 towers in 44 states. Dodge retired as Chairman at the 2004 Annual Meeting of shareholders. At the time, the Company operated approximately 15,000 communications sites in the United States, Mexico, and Brazil. ===Windover Development, LLC=== In 2005, Dodge founded Windover, a custom builder of luxury homes on Boston’s North Shore, later expanding to Bonita Beach, Florida, and adding Windover Construction, a full-service construction management firm focused on residential, commercial and institutional projects. In 2017, Windover Construction was purchased by its employees, led by CEO Lee Dellicker. ===Beverly Crossing LLC=== In 2016, Dodge founded Beverly Crossing, a real estate development group that creates, owns, and operates residential communities in Massachusetts, and in Florida, where it serves the Gulf Coast from Naples to Ft. Myers as Windover Development of Florida. “Beverly has become our main area of focus,” Dodge said in 2018, “as we are replacing the City’s dying or dead industrial core with a new community of apartments, restaurants, and related amenities, with bustling Beverly Depot at its center.” ==Personal Life== In 1974, Dodge married Anne Nordblom, whom he had met at the Bank of Boston. The couple had three children, Thomas, Kristen, and Benjamin. Dodge and his wife were benefactors of Brookwood School, Brown University, Middlesex School, Milton Academy, the Boston Renaissance Charter Public School, and the University of Vermont. “Throughout his professional endeavors and personal relationships,” Dodge’s obituary read, he “repeatedly demonstrated the importance of maintaining genuine humility, selfless generosity, and a sense of humor. Despite his extraordinary success, Dodge is remembered and revered most for his quiet leadership qualities, specifically his ability to mentor and instill confidence in others. Countless people regarded his guidance, which he offered freely, as key in reaching significant life decisions.” Dodge’s launch of Windover in 2005 was a result of his personal interest in architecture and construction and an opportunity to create spcial places. He artfully enhanced landscapes in Massachusetts and Vermont featuring weathered fieldstone fences, newly planted trees, and classic New England structures. Surveying Dodge’s work, a neighbor once remarked, “It’s what God would have done if he hadn’t run out of money.” Dodge was a lifelong Red Sox fan and an avid reader. His favorite getaways included fishing the mountain streams in Chile and motorcycling in Sardinia. “We biked there because they had no speed limits,” he said. When asked to describe what makes a good entrepreneur, Dodge replied, “Remain humble, approachable. Pay attention to what’s going on around you. Learn how to listen more than your talk.” ==References== Category:1945 births Category:American chief executives in the media industry Category:Yale University alumni Category:Cycling road incident deaths Category:2019 deaths ","title":"Steven B.

He matriculated at Corpus Christi, Oxford on 1 March 1722, aged 17. He succeeded his father on 16 January 1725, to the baronetcyand to the estate at Aston worth £4,000 p.a. Aston was returned as an opposition Whig Member of Parliament for Liverpool at a by-election on 28 May 1729 and acted strongly in the interests of Liverpool’s merchants and traders. His opponent Thomas Brereton, raised a petition which was finally rejected by the House in April 1730 after protracted hearings. Aston was elected to serve on the gaols committee. On 19 February 1730, he sent a reassuring report to the mayor of Liverpool, and thus the port’s independent traders, of a debate on the Royal African Company’s attempt to make independent traders pay for the maintenance of its forts in Africa. In the debate on Hessian troops on 3 February 1731, he proposed ‘that the House should address the King to give away his Hanover dominions to anybody that would take them’, but the move was ignored. On the Address on 16 January 1733, he challenged the statement expressing satisfaction with the situation of the country’s affairs given difficulties to trade caused by Spain and France. He spoke on the qualification bill that to expect merchants serving seaport towns to have land qualification was unreasonable. .He also spoke against the excise bill. At the 1734 British general election he decided not to stand for Liverpool, and was returned instead for St Albans on the recommendation of Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough.

During his 35 years as president, the school expanded, adding college courses with Departments of Theology, Teacher Training, Commerce and Liberal Arts. At a time when many missionaries regarded non- Christian religions as enemies, Schneder saw traditional religions of Japan, particularly Amida Buddhism, as preparations for the gospel. He is considered in the vanguard of his missionary generation for these ideas. Nevertheless, he never entered into dialogue with non-Christian religious leaders. A student of Buddhism, Schneder wrote Japanese Buddhism in 1899. He felt that the Buddhism of his time had lost some its early virtues and had become a cult of glitter and pomp to impress the vulgar mind. Excerpt Schneder and his wife made seven trips to the U.S., \\"never ceasing in their labors to build international goodwill and raise money for the school's expansion.\\" He retired in 1936, becoming President Emeritus, and was awarded his second Order of the Rising Sun for distinguished service to education. His final speech was entitled \\"Why I'm Not Ashamed of the Gospels.\\" He stayed in Sendai after retirement and died in 1938. In 1917, he was awarded Fourth Class Order of the Rising Sun by the Emperor \\"in appreciation of ... his efforts in the maintenance of friendly relations between Japan and America.\\" He later tried to bridge the growing U.S.-Japan antagonisms that led to World War 2 by sharing Christian viewpoints on reconciliation with his many contacts, including presidents and prime ministers. ==See also== *Masayoshi Oshikawa *William Edwin Hoy ==References== Category:1857 births Category:1938 deaths Category:Franklin & Marshall College Category:Protestant missionaries in Japan Category:Missionary educators ","title":"David Bowman Schneder"},{"id":"60303461","text":"Satyajeet Tambe is President of Maharashtra Youth Congress. ==Early life== Satyajeet was born in Sangamner on 27 September 1983 to Sudhir Tambe who is member of Maharashtra Legislative Council.

The residence also hosts events for residents and outside groups in its great hall, and serves breakfast and dinner to residents during weekdays. ==History== ISH-DC was established in 1936 by a group of Quakers as part of the international student house movement spearheaded by the missionary Waldo Stevenson. They sought to promote intercultural exchange and to aid international students of color unable to find housing due to racist housing norms prevalent in the city at the time. The group was originally located at 1708 New Hampshire Avenue NW, but in 1946, it moved to its present location, a Tudor mansion built in 1912. In 1967, an additional residential building, Van Slyck Hall, was constructed adjacent to the main building, and in the 1980s, ISH-DC purchased a residential building, now named Marpat Hall, located behind the main building. The main building and Marpat Hall are listed as contributing properties to the Dupont Circle Historic District. ==Demographics== At full capacity, ISH houses 96 people.

It was built in 1887, and has been an inn since 1950. The inn has accommodations in the main building, Oceanfront Lodge and The Newport. It has two restaurants: the Reading Room and (in the high season only) the Terrace Grille. A bar, called the Oasis Lounge, is located off of the Reading Room. There is also a spa on site. The inn closes from December to late March. ==History== The property was originally known as the Mount Desert Reading Room when it was built by the men-only, 1874-founded\\"‘Reading Room’ was once a front\\" - Mount Desert Islander, May 16, 2015 Oasis Club in 1887 to be its new clubhouse. The purpose of the club was to promote literary and social culture. It was designed by William Ralph Emerson. The main entrance to the inn is on the southern side of the building. This view is from spring 2019 The inn viewed from Agamont Park in 2013. Also in view, the four-masted schooner Margaret Todd and Bald Porcupine Island beyond the pier In 1902, a steel pier was constructed at the shore path in front of the Reading Room to accommodate visitors that wanted to come in from Frenchman Bay. President William Howard Taft was provided a grand reception at the Reading Room in 1910. Ladies were permitted into the club for the time in 1921. A restaurant was opened to the public. In 1922, due to the outbreak of World War I and a resultant decline in membership, the Reading Room was sold to Maine Central Railroad Company. It leased the building to the Bar Harbor Yacht Club. Over the ensuing quarter-century, the building had a number of proprietors. In 1933, a group of hotel owners formed the Shore Club, which allowed guests at local hotels to use the Reading Room's facilities. During World War II, the United States Navy leased the building for use as an observation headquarters. When Bar Harbor was inflicted by the great fires of 1947, the American Red Cross used the building to provide shelter to many who had lost their homes. The following year, a committee set out to raise funds, by way of a stock program, to build a new hotel. The committee was headquartered at 6 Mount Desert Street, and by September 8, 1948 they had raised $231,600. They extended the campaign \\"in an effort to sell the entire authorized $300,000 stock issue.\\" Work on the new hotel — named the Hotel Bar Harbor — began in 1950. The work incorporated the Reading Room but also included the addition of a 40-room wing. In 1960, a 20-room motel overlooking Frenchman Bay was added to the hotel. The Spa at The Bar Harbor Inn, pictured in 2019 David J. Witham purchased the hotel in 1987 and changed the name to the current Bar Harbor Inn. The following year, he oversaw the addition of the 64-room Oceanfront Lodge to the property. The 20-room motel was relocated to make way for the new construction, but it was torn down in 1992 and replaced with the two-story Newport Building, adding 38 more rooms to the property. The hotel is still owned by his Witham Family Hotels Group, which owns two other hotels in downtown Bar Harbor: the Villager Motel and the Bar Harbor Grand. In 2006, the Bar Harbor Inn Spa building was erected. The inn underwent renovations during the winter and spring of 2018 and 2019, including a new infinity-edge swimming pool and a continental-breakfast building.Bar Harbor Inn - \\"Renovation Notice\\" ===Gazebo=== The inn's gazebo, pictured in 2019 To the west of the inn, on the slope leading up to Agamont Park, stands a gazebo.

The room of that hospital became an oratory at this site, and in the 15th-century, this church was erected, conserving the bed (letto) in which the miracle occurred in one of the chapels. The bed is still kept in a chapel of the church. The construction lasted until 1484, with the intervention at the time of completion by Ventura Vittoni. In 1526, an adjacent Augustinian monastery was established, under the supervision of the cathedral and the Operai di San Jacopo. The church was consecrated in 1535. After the suppression in the late 18th-century, the church was assigned to what was then the adjacent Hospital del Ceppo. It subsequently became a parish church.Diocese of Pistoia. The interior decoration with bands of decorative strips, airy nave with free-standing columns, and apse dome recalls the work of Michelozzo. The stone facade has a large round oculus and a portal flanked by elegant pilasters.

He was associated with the Franciscan Order and, from 1498, held various positions at the Church of Santa Maria Corteorlandini.

He was directly influenced by Domenico Ghirlandaio and Filippino Lippi, who worked in Lucca during the early part of the 1490s, and indirectly by Sandro Botticelli, making him the first fully Renaissance painter in that area. His composition, in particular, owes much to Lippi. He also incorporated some Flemish elements into his works; After 1481, the documentary record of his works is quite long, although many have since been lost. The high amounts paid for these works is testimony to the high opinion in which they were held. His workshop, managed by his brother, was always busy and, in 1490, there is record of their agreement to split the profits. Although the exact date and place of his death is unknown, he was contracted, in 1505, to paint part of an altarpiece (depicting the Virgin and Child) at the Church of San Gennaro, which had to be completed by Ranieri di Leonardo da Pisa, presumably due to Frediani's death.

Their practice is notable for injecting humour and theatricality into the sphere of performance art. The three performers initially worked using lip sync and choreography as their tools to parody pop culture depictions of femininity and later expanded their practice by including elements from science fiction and theatre in their performances. The Clichettes are notable for their impact on Canadian performance art as well as Feminist and performing arts in general.A picture of the Clichettes in the 1980s performing Up Against the Wallpaper. == Background == The Clichettes were a feminist performance collective of three choreographers, Johanna Householder, Janice Hladki and Louise Garfield, who formed in Toronto and were active in North America from the mid 1970s through 1990s. Their subversive practice was typified by an exaggeration of the hallmarks of contemporaneous female performing groups as well as camp references to drag-performance and science fiction. The depiction of women in mass media was a primary subject of critique and parody in their performances. Johanna Householder was born in Alabama in 1949 and attended Oberlin College. Following a brief period in London where she studied choreography, Householder relocated to Toronto where she continued her art and writing practice. Householder describes her initial study of dance as an attempt to learn a medium in order to reject it. Householder has assisted in founding Danceworks and the Women's Cultural Building in the 80s, and the 7a*11d International Festival of Performance Art that is held biannually in Toronto. She is currently a professor in the Integrated Media Program at OCAD university, where she is also the Chair of the Criticism and Curatorial Practice Program. Janice Hladki studied at Queens University and later moved to Toronto to study dance at the Toronto Dance Theatre. Hladki was influenced by a trip to the United States where she encountered the work of the Mabou Mines theatre group. An important aspect of Hladki's practice was to combine dance with a feminist consciousness. She is currently an associate professor in theatre and film studies at McMaster University. Hladki is also a founding member of Danceworks and the Woman's Cultural Building. Louise Garfield is a trained dancer, choreographer and television producer. She was notorious for dropping out of several institutions prior to the formation of The Clichettes, including York University. Householder admiringly stated that \\"Lou was the model for quitting\\". She was motivated by an interest in performative dance, but was dissatisfied with traditional ballet and modern choreography. Later, she studied dance with Gail Mazur in Toronto, where she found her interest in dancing. Garfield was briefly enrolled at York University, which was another meeting place for the three members. Louise Garfield was the executive director at Arts Etobicoke for 13 years since 2004 before retiring, and has been a producer of films including Zero Patience and The Hanging Garden. === Formation === A photograph of The Clichettes performing in She Devils of Niagara. In the mid 1970s, all three members of The Clichettes were living and performing in Toronto, Ontario. The performers became acquainted with each while working as servers at The Parrot restaurant on Queen Street West. All three members also attended 15 Dance Lab and dance conferences in which they developed and observed each other's individual practices. It was there that they discovered their shared vision to explore a witty, humorous, and feminist approach to performance. Their gravitation towards one another was the result of a mutual admiration of style and desire to resist and parody contemporaneous dance practices. It was around the same time as their meeting that Toronto developed its own official art scene. Coincidentally, it was the Queen Street West area that budded with potential and style - associated with not only music and visual arts, but also theatre, design, fashion, and dancing. Clive Robertson wrote, \\"it can be argued that the birth of the Clichettes coincided with the birth, or public emergence of Toronto's recent progressive cultural scene.\\" == Early work == The central themes that would preoccupy The Clichettes throughout their career – satire, appropriation, parody, feminist commentary, and pop-culture and media deconstruction – were clearly present during their formational period. As a feminist performance group, The Clichettes' practice resisted the conventions of girlhood and dance through satirical, humorous performances. They contested gender stereotypes through the use of pop culture cliches and brash humour. The Clichettes made their debut at the Tele-Performance Festival in 1978, an event themed in response to television as content and technology. Dressed in kitsch-60's good girls outfits, the trio lip-synced to Lesley Gore's \\"You Don't Own Me\\" for the first time. Lip-synching the words “ You don’t own me. I’m not just one of your many toys”, and their other early performances, revealed and reflected the \\"performativity\\" of gender norms. This full-frontal method of feminist assault was greatly inspired by satirical musical group the Hummer Sisters. Their brand of camp media parody exemplified the blurring between high art and entertainment occurring in the 1970s. This style of non-detached and ironic pop-culture appropriation enabled them to be critical without alienating their audience. == Later Work and Disbandment == By 1981, the trio's lip-sync performances had begun to expand to include increasing theatricality, and influences were drawn from more subversive sources. Marni Jackson became a collaborator for the production Half-Human Half-Heartache, a move for the group to expand beyond dance and into satirical theatre. The 1981 production featured a narrative casting The Clichettes as aliens who could kill by speaking, thus establishing a narrative purpose for lip-sync. The trio of aliens begins to live the facade of '1960's good-girls' but eventually become entangled in the problematic dynamics of this life. The cabaret show was a hit in Toronto, with productions that followed in Ottawa and Vancouver. Their next stage endeavour was more ambitious: She-Devils of Niagara (1985) depicted a dystopian future where gender was strictly regulated, and history had been banished to the basement of a wax museum in Niagara Falls. As the Clichettes' acclaim increased throughout the 1980s, their performances started to poke fun at more than just mass-market depictions of girls. Their 1985 production Go To Hell saw the group adopt anatomically correct male bodysuits as a means to expand their critique to the stereotypes of masculinity. Armed with fake guitars, they parodied the macho posturing of “cock-rock” bands. By spoofing the gestures of those musicians and lip-syncing their lyrics, The Clichettes were hilariously denouncing the contrived affectations of male stars. The height of their lip-sync career came in 1984, when the three friends travelled to Houston, Texas to compete and win the grand prize in the National Lip-Sync Contest. By 1991, the group had been working together for twelve years. Each production required a long period of developing and researching music, sound, choreography, and music, and the combined economics of these factors was becoming a burden. After Out for Blood (1990), The Clichettes mutually disbanded in 1992 to individually pursue financial stability and new artistic direction. == Legacy == The Clichettes' impact on the practices of Canadian dance, performance and feminist art is extensive. The success of their performances proved that cultural criticism could also be fun, rather than strictly moralistic; and control of the means of representation could be a playful engagement with the \\"oppressor\\". In 2017, the group was commemorated in a virtual exhibition, 150 Years  150 Works, celebrating the history of Canadian art for Canada's 150th anniversary. The exhibit showcased works that have shaped or changed the country's history over the past century and a half and selected The Clichette's famous Go to Hell (1985) lip-sync performance as a feature. The trio's enduring impact on Canadian dance is evident in that several Clichettes performances are frequently recreated by Danny Grossman's dancers. == Notable performances == Secret Life of Sergeant Preston, 1979. Performed at the AGO. You Don't Own Me, 1978. First Performed at the Tele- Performance Festival. The Clichettes Performing Go to Hell in 1985 Half-Human Half-Heartache, 1981.

He was the son of Mahitbel \\"Mabel\\" (née Hollister) Houghton (1867–1938) and Arthur Amory Houghton Sr. (1866–1928), a former president of Corning Glass. His parents lived in Corning and in New York City at 920 and 941 Park Avenue. He had two older sisters, Phoebe Hollister Houghton, who died young, and Gratia Buell Houghton, who married writer and playwright Alan Rinehart. His paternal grandparents were Amory Houghton Jr., a former president of Corning, and Ellen Ann (née Bigelow) Houghton. Arthur was nephew of Alanson Bigelow Houghton (a U.S. Representative and Ambassador to England and Germany) and a great- grandson of Amory Houghton Sr., a founder of Corning Glass Works in 1851. Among the many prominent family members of his generation were the U.S. Ambassador to France, Amory Houghton, and Alice Tully, who donated the funds for a chamber music hall at Lincoln Center named in her honor (Alice Tully Hall built in 1963). Like his father before him, Houghton attended St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire in 1925, and graduated from Harvard University in 1929. ==Career== After his graduation from Harvard, Houghton joined the family business. In 1933, he began his forty-year service as president of Steuben Glass Works, a subsidiary of the Corning Company, where he is credited for a change of artistic direction toward more modern forms, which incorporated Art Deco and modernist themes. He hired renowned sculptors including Sidney Waugh, Massimo Vignelli. In 1940, while remaining in his role as president of Steuben but relinquishing day-to-day operations, he began to serve as the curator of rare books at the Library of Congress, in Washington, D.C., under Archibald MacLeish, the Librarian of Congress. Houghton served in this role for two years until the outbreak of World War II, where he served as an officer in the Army Air Corps for three years, retiring in 1945 as a Lieutenant colonel. He also served as a director of the USX Corporation (formerly U.S. Steel) and the New York Life Insurance Company as well as an honorary trustee of The United States Trust Company. In 1951, along with his cousin Amory Houghton, he co-founded the Corning Museum of Glass. ===Philanthropy=== In 1942, he endowed Houghton Library at Harvard as a repository for the university's collections of rare books and manuscripts, and, later, donated Wye River, his plantation on the Eastern Shore of Maryland where he bred Black Angus cattle, to the Aspen Institute, the international public policy organization, which is today the Aspen Institute Wye River Conference Centers. In 1952, he joined the board of the New York Philharmonic, serving as chairman from 1958 to 1963 and on the board itself until 1965. While he was on the board, and during his presidency, the Philharmonic moved from Carnegie Hall to the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, while he served, as vice-chairman, alongside John D. Rockefeller III, as chairman, of a committee to create Lincoln Center. He was also a vice president of the Pierpont Morgan Library, a president of the English-Speaking Union of the U.S., a trustee and chairman of the Cooper Union, a trustee and chairman of the Parsons School of Design, and chairman of the Institute of International Education. In September 1964, Houghton was elected to replace Roland L. Redmond as the 10th president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, and became chairman in 1969 (and serving until 1972). Houghton, who was a member of more than 100 education and arts organizations, served on the board of the Museum from 1952 to 1974. He was succeeded as president by C. Douglas Dillon, a former investment banker who had worked with the Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson Administrations. ==Personal life== On June 12, 1929, Houghton married Jane Olmsted (1909–1982) at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in Harrisburg. Jane was the daughter of Gertrude (née Howard) McCormick and Marlin Edgar Olmsted, a Republican member of the U.S. Congress from Pennsylvania. Before their divorce in July 1938, they were the parents of: * Jane Olmsted Houghton (1930–1989), who married Rollin Van Nostrand Hadley Jr. in 1950. She later married Robert Gordon Hankey, Horace E. Henderson, and George R. Kneeland. * Sylvia Houghton (b. 1933), who married Richard Gordon Garrett in 1963. His first wife remarried to Hugh McMillan in 1947. On June 7, 1939, he was married for the second time to Ellen Crenshaw (1906–1961) in Queenstown, Maryland. Ellen was a friend of Washington journalist Joseph Alsop. Before their divorce in January 1944, they were the parents of one child: * Arthur Amory Houghton III (b. 1940), who married Sherrill Jean Mulliken in 1968. He later married Linda Livingston Davis, daughter of Goodhue Livingston Jr., in 1987. Arthur was the assistant curator in antiquities at the J. Paul Getty Museum. On January 15, 1944, he married for the third time to Elizabeth Douglas McCall (1919–1996), a daughter of Arthur May McCall. They lived at 3 Sutton Place, a four-story brick townhouse that was built in 1921 for Anne Morgan, daughter of financier J.P. Morgan. In 1971, Mr. Houghton Jr donated it to the United Nations for use as the official residence of the Secretary-General in 1972Teltsch, Kathleen. \\"Town House Offered to U. N.\\", The New York Times, July 15, 1972. Accessed December 27, 2007.) and before their divorce in 1972, were the parents of one child: * Hollister Douglas \\"Holly\\" Houghton (b. 1945), who married equestrian William D. Haggard III in 1968. After their divorce, Elizabeth remarried to prominent architect Walker O. Cain in 1973. On May 22, 1973, he married for the fourth, and final time, to Nina (née Rodale) Horstmann (b. 1937) at Annapolis. Nina, the daughter of J. I. Rodale of Rodale, Inc. and sister of Robert Rodale, was previously married to Robert Horstmann. Houghton, who also had a home in Boca Grande, died at Venice Hospital in Venice, Florida on April 3, 1990. He was buried at the Old Wye Episcopal Church Cemetery in Wye Mills, Maryland. In 1971, he was awarded the Skowhegan Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney Award by the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture for his for his outstanding efforts as \\"a patron of the arts.\\" ==References== ;Notes ;Sources ==External links== * Category:1906 births Category:1990 deaths Category:St. Paul's School (New Hampshire) alumni Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Presidents of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Category:American philanthropists ","title":"Arthur A.

Sociogeny, or sociogenesis, describes the development of a social phenomenon. That a phenomenon is sociogenetic thus indicates that it is socially produced, as opposed to ontologically given, immutable, or static. Fanon was a Martinician writer, revolutionary, and psychoanalyst whose work focused on the pathologies and neuroses produced through European colonialism.Frantz Fanon: A Biography, Verso, 2012. In Black Skin, White Masks, Fanon expanded upon Freud's concepts of ontogeny and phylogeny, alongside which Fanon placed sociogeny.Black Skin White Masks, Fanon, Grove Press, 1967. Freud employed ontogeny, a term borrowed from the field of biology, to describe the natural development of the individual subject; phylogeny, Freud proposed, could be used to understand the development of groups of subjects, such as families or societies.Sigmund Freud, The Wolfman and Other Cases. Penguin Books, 2003, 112. Building upon Freud's work, Fanon developed the concept of sociogeny, which he employed to articulate how socially produced phenomena, such as poverty or crime, are linked to certain population groups as if those groups were biologically, or ontogenetically, predisposed towards those phenomena. The conflation of sociogeny and ontogeny - i.e., the conflation of a sociogenetic phenomena with an ontogenetic or \\"natural\\" predilection - plays an important role in the social construction of race, according to Fanon.Black Skin White Masks, Fanon, Grove Press Since the time of Fanon's writing, the concept of sociogeny has been taken up by many scholars in disciplines such as sociology, psychology, Black studies, Women's studies, and Postcolonial studies.Beyond Whitehead: Recent Advances in Process Thought, Jakub Dziadkowiec and Lukasz Lamza eds.

In 2006, the film was co-produced by Philippe Bober and Susanne Marian (Essential Filmproduktion, Germany), Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg (Germany), WDR/Arte (Germany), Arte France Cinema (France), Mitteldeutsche Medienförderung (Germany), Eurimages, Swedish Film Institute, Film i Väst (Sweden), Hubert Bals Fund (Netherlands), Ukrainian Ministry of Culture, and X Filme Creative Pool Entertainment GmbH (Germany). The funds provided by the Russian Ministry of Culture were returned. The first round of filming took place in Saint Petersburg and Kharkiv. The film's premiere will consist of a number of separate events. == DAU Project == In conjunction with the development of the film, the DAU multimedia project was started. Since 2007, thanks to the collaborative, financial, and ideological support of philanthropist Serguei Adoniev, the project began to take new, unique forms, for which it is now renowned. The DAU Institute was built on the site of the former Dynamo Aquatic Stadium in Kharkiv, Ukraine, occupying 12,000 m2. It became the largest film set in Europe and a sort of alternate reality for three years between 2008 and 2011. The project involved scientists, artists, musicians, philosophers, religious figures and mystics, as well as cooks, cleaners, nurses, hairdressers, and secret service agents, all of whom lived and worked at the institute, observing the rules of dynamic historical reconstruction of a period spanning from 1938 to 1968. Cameras recorded the natural behavior of each character in circumstances orchestrated by the director. Everyone, with the exception of Dau (portrayed by Teodor Currentzis), his wife (Radmila Schegoleva), their son (Nikolai Voronov), and Krupitsa, director of the institute from 1938 to 1953 (Anatoly Vasiliev), lived in the institute under their own names. Their biographies were adapted to the new Soviet reality. In total, 392,000 people auditioned for the film. There were two departments at the DAU Institute: the theoretical department, where the actual theoretical physicists worked, and the experimental department, staffed mostly by contemporary artists. Research into the quantum physics concepts of string theory and loop quantum gravity was carried out at the institute. In addition to this, experiments were conducted in less conventional fields, such as orgone energy, teleportation, and superhuman abilities. Ilya Khrzhanovsky's original idea of creating a film about Lev Landau has been transformed through the process of filming into a large-scale study of human nature that continues to this day. At different stages of the project, contemporary artists Marina Abramović, Carsten Höller, Boris Mikhailov, and Philippe Parreno, among many others, have been involved, as were stage and film directors Peter Sellars, Romeo Castellucci, Anatoly Vasiliev, designers including Rei Kawakubo, musicians Robert Del Naja (Massive Attack) and Brian Eno, and many more. == Filming == True to its immersive nature, the film set operated 24/7, regardless of the shooting schedule. The head camera operator of DAU, Jürgen Jürges, developed a unique lighting system that allowed the crew to shoot without any lighting equipment. In November 2011, the filming process was completed and the location was dismantled, a process which became a part of the plot. Remaining objects, small and large props, artifacts, and costumes were preserved and later reused in other contexts of the project. The filming process captured 700 hours of material in total, from which 14 feature films, 3 series, as well as video performances and scientific films were created. Post-production on the films ended in 2018. The movies were voiced by Gérard Depardieu, Willem Dafoe, Isabelle Adjani, Fanny Ardant, Isabelle Huppert, Charlotte Rampling, Iris Berben, Hanna Schygulla, Barbara Sukowa, Katharina Thalbach, Veronica Ferres, Heike Makatsch, Toni Garrn, Lilith Stangenberg, Kathrin Angerer, Palina Rojinski, Vicky Krieps, Jella Haase, Lars Eidinger, Martin Wuttke, Blixa Bargeld, Bela B, Bill Kaulitz, Tom Schilling, Marc Hosemann, Frederick Lau, Franz Rogowski, Louis Hofmann, Sven Marquardt, Tahar Rahim, Denis Lavant, Lou de Laâge, Éric Cantona, Pascal Greggory, and Amira Casar. == Conferences == In 2017 a series of conferences was organized in London to explore the wide range of cultural, social, and political issues raised in DAU. The following conferences took place: * \\"Import and export of the Russian revolution: ideological, political and communal exchange.\\" (25–25 February 2017, London School of Economics and Political Science). Some of those who took part in the conference were professors Teodor Shanin, Alexander Etkind, Mark Steinberg, Simon Dixon, John Butler, Erik van Raaij, Viktoria Zhuravleva, and David Wolf. * \\"The protagonists of political mythology: how do individuals and collectives enter into history?\\" (25–26 March 2017, House of Commons, Parliament of the United Kingdom, University of Westminster), with the participation of the first president of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, the first state secretary of Russia Gennady Burbulis, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus Stanislav Shushkevich, UK Ambassador to USSR Sir Roderick Braithwaite, West German Ambassador to USSR Andreas Mayer Landrut, professors Robert Service, Linda Cook, Mark Fenster, and Judith Pallot, and others. * \\"The experience of extremism: faith, violence and liberation movements.\\" (24–26 May 2017, House of Lords, Parliament of the United Kingdom, London Royal Society), with the participation of the former Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the United Kingdom, Sir Michael David Jackson, Representative of the Government of Autonomous Kurdistan His Excellency Karvan Jamal Tahir, Colonel Vladimir Azhippo, Professor James Fallon, members of the international tribunal from the former Yugoslavia Marko Sladojević (Serbia), Amir Cengic (Bosnia), and Davor Laznic (Croatia), former publicity director at Sinn Féin Danny Morrison (Northern Ireland). == Release in Paris == Films created from the material filmed at the Institute were released for the first time in Paris between January 25 and February 17 2019, with the support of the City Hall of Paris and executive producer Martine d'Anglejan-Chatillon. The immersion into the world of DAU took place in two Parisian theaters, Théâtre du Châtelet and Théâtre de la Ville, during a period of simultaneous renovation. Moreover, at the Pompidou Centre, the atmosphere of the DAU Institute was recreated with an installation featuring various characters from the project who lived within the artwork 24 hours per day. To visit the DAU project, visitors were required to obtain a DAU-visa. Within the theaters, round-the-clock public screenings of the films were accompanied by individual conversations by members of the audience with \\"active listeners,\\" among whom were priests, pastors, and rabbis, as well as social workers and doctors. Conferences, performances, concerts, and shamanic rituals were held at both theaters. It was impossible to learn about them in advance. Instead of offering a guided experience, the principle of uncertainty and the constant metamorphosis brought visitors into unexpected encounters—a core characteristic of the DAU project. In accordance with this principle and as part of the project, performances by renowned musicians were held incognito, without posters or ads. During Paris events, Théâtre du Châtelet and Théâtre de la Ville hosted Teodor Currentzis and MusicAeterna, Jazz Aeterna, and TrigolOS, musicians Mikhail Rudy, Tatiana Grindenko, Vladimir Martynov, Vladimir Tarasov, Leonid Fyodorov, Mikhail Mordvinov, Dmitry Uvarov, Vangelino Currentzis, Marko Nikodievich, and Vladimir Volkov, singer Sergey Starostin, opera singer Ekaterina Shcherbachenko, singer and performer Arca, Robert Del Naja (Massive Attack), and Brian Eno, who developed a bespoke acoustic architecture for DAU. Also, performances of Sasha Waltz and her dance troupe, as well as installations of Romeo Castellucci and Philippe Parreno, took place in different DAU spaces. Writer Jonathan Littell, futurologist Real Miller, professor of physics and string theorist Nikita Nekrasov, writer and social critic Evgeny Morozov, photographer Reza Deghati, biophysicist prof. Sonia Contera, writer Alexander Etkind, and others took part in the DAU conferences in Paris. According to preliminary estimates, in the period from January 25 to February 17, 2019, around 40,000 people visited DAU project venues in Paris. == Criticism of the project == Criticism of the project predominantly focused on questions of transparency, work ethics, and respect for the rights of DAU participants. Critical accounts mostly contain references to the testimonies of participants involved for only a short time. Neither participants nor creators of the DAU material shown at the Paris premiere criticized the project. Criticism in regards of the filming of children with Down syndrome, in particular, was rejected by the director and the press service of the project. In addition, the project has spawned discussions about the limits of what is permissible in cinema. The project team has filed a lawsuit in relation to material published by Le Monde, which allegedly quoted some of the participants. == Future of the project == In the future, the project will continue to exist on the DAU Digital platform, available online. The release of the feature film \\"Dau\\" is scheduled for the second half of 2019 or first half of 2020, with details to be confirmed. == Production team == * Serguei Adoniev – Chief Producer * Jürgen Jürges – Director of Photography, Lighting Designer * Manuel Alberto Claro – Saint Petersburg Unit Operator * Denis Shibanov – Project Art Director * Jekaterina Oertel, Ilya Permyakov, Alexey Slyusarchuk - Editing Directors * Boris Shapovalov – Art Director of the Saint Petersburg Unit * Olga Gurevich – Art Director of the Kharkiv Unit * Jekaterina Oertel – Make-up Artist * Maksym Demydenko – Post-Production Executive Producer and Sound Director * Anastasia Smekalova – Casting Director * Alexey Slyusarchuk, Vera Levchenko, Inna Shorr – Second Directors at the Site * Volker Gläser – The Second Camera * Jörg Gruber – First Assistant Operator, Third Camera * Michael Siebert – Focus- Puller, First Assistant Operator * Yevgeny Kravchynia – Art Assistant * Arina Galantseva – Art Assistant * Alexander Mordovin – Art Assistant * Elena Shmakova – Assistant Art Director for Props * Julia Zelenaya – Assistant Sound Engineer * Alexandra Timofeeva – Head of the Costume Department, Executive Producer * Irina Tsvetkova, Elena and Olga Bekritskie, Lyubov Mingazitdinova, Alexandra Smolina - Costume Designers * Susanne Marian – Producer * Philippe Bober – Film Producer * Svetlana Dragayeva – Executive Producer * Artem Vasiliev – Producer of the Preparation and Filming of the Saint Petersburg and Kharkiv Units * Daria Sherman – Post-Production Line Producer * Menelaos Pampoukidis – Visual Effects Supervisor ==See also== * Dau (film) * DAU.

She was an activist against female feticide in India. Her case became well-known when she took legal action against her husband and his family on accusations of performing an ultrasound to reveal the sex of their children without her consent, pressuring her to abort their two daughters once sex was known, and domestic violence after she refused to consider sex-selective abortion. She died in March 2020 from complications in heart surgery. == Biography == Khurana first entered mainstream media coverage when she initiated landmark legal action against her ex-husband and his family in 2008. Khurana claimed the sex of her children with then-husband Dr. Kamal Khurana was determined without her consent. In January 2005, her husband and his family took Khurana to the Jaipur Golden Hospital in Delhi for stomach pain. There, her husband and his family allegedly worked with hospital staff to arrange an ultrasound without her consent. The knowledge was later used against her to pressure her to have a sex-selective abortion against her will. After the hospital visit, her husband and his family began to pressure her to seek abortion. \\"They didn't say anything to me, but afterwards it was clear that my husband and my in-laws knew that I was carrying girls,\\" Khurana said. \\"After that, they began badgering me to have at least one of them killed. They told me we could not bring up two girls, we would not be able to afford to get them married.\\" Upon returning home, she faced domestic abuse by her husband and his parents. At one point during pregnancy, her husband pushed her down a flight of stairs to induce a miscarriage.

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Baker, to the northwest. ==History== The first ascent of the mountain was made in August 1897 by George Percival Baker, J. Norman Collie, H. B. Dixon, Charles Ernest Fay, Arthur Michael, C. L. Noyes, H. C. Parker, and Charles Sproull Thompson, with Peter Sarbach as guide. The mountain was named in 1897 by Charles Sproull Thompson of the first ascent party for John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair, at the time Governor General of Canada from 1893 to 1898. After descending from the summit of Mount Gordon, Thompson fell into a crevasse and became lodged which required rescue by the team. Mount Thompson, six kilometres to the north of Mount Gordon, was one of several peaks named by this same climbing party. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1924 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. ==Geology== Mount Gordon is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Gordon is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.

An alveolar cleft is a failure of the premaxilla to fuse with the upper jaw leaving a defect in the bone. It is common in people with cleft palate and is also associated with holes between the mouth and the nose that affects speech, and allows fluid to move into the nose when eating and drinking. Surgeries on the roof of the mouth early in life typically close the larger hole between the mouth and the nose (caused by the cleft in the palate) but do not repair the defect in the bone, or any holes further forward between the palate and the upper lip. About the age of 8, just before the eye teeth are about to erupt into the bone defect (the cleft), braces are used to first widen the upper jaw, and position the premaxilla. Then, a surgery places bone or a bone substitute in the defect to allow the premaxilla to fuse to the rest of the maxilla, provide bone for eruption of the canine, and close any remaining holes between the mouth and nose. If completed early, the canine teeth will erupt into the mouth with good bone support and remain healthy. ==Medical uses== Alveolar cleft grafting is used primarily to allow the eruption of the maxillary canines into the mouth between the ages of 8–13 years old. It is also used to close oranasal fistulas, stop fluid reflux into the nose, improve speech, support the maxillary lateral teeth, and stabilize the jaw for orthodontics or orthognathic surgery. ==Technique== In cleft palate patients bone grafting during the mixed dentition has been widely accepted since the mid-1960s. The goals of surgery are to stabilize the maxilla, facilitate the healthy eruption of teeth that are adjacent the cleft, improving the esthetics of the base of the nose, create a bone base for dental implants, and to close any oro-nasal fistulas. ===Pre-treatment monitoring and timing === The incisors and first molars start to erupt between the ages of 6 to 8 years. Panorex xray showing defect (red arrow) in the alveolus with maxillary canine tooth erupting into the cleft about age 13 One of the most controversial topics in alveolar cleft grafting is the timing of treatment, however, most centres recommend grafting around the ages of 6–8 years old as the lateral incisor and maxillary canine near the cleft site. This is referred to as secondary grafting during mixed dentition (after eruption of the maxillary central incisors but before the eruption of the canine). A smaller proportion recommend primary grafting around the age of 2, but success rates are lower, and fewer patients are good candidates. Late secondary grafting (after eruption of the canine) has also been advocated but has been largely abandoned due to the loss of tooth support. In secondary grafting, the dental age of the patient needs to be closely monitored for the eruption of the first maxillary molars in unilateral cases around the age of 6, and in bilateral cases the eruption of central incisors about the age of 8. This timing is used because there is minimal growth of the upper jaw after ages 6–7, the patient is more compliant with orthodontics that is required prior to surgery for expansion, the donor site is better developed, and the grafting precedes the eruption of teeth into the site. In cases with a single cleft, 35-60% of lateral incisors are congenitally missing, and cannot be relied on for timing. Instead, the eruption of the incisors and first molars is used as a queue to begin assessments. With bilateral cases, the premaxilla must be repositioned before grafting and special consideration must be given. During this time, the orthodontist must be wary of rotating teeth into the cleft site. Last, the size of the patient, defect, and social issues must all be taken into consideration and is best assessed with a CBCT scan as the patient enters the mixed dentition phase of dental development. ===Pre-surgery Orthodontics=== Fan rapid palatal expander in cleft palate prior to alveolar cleft grafting In cleft lip and palate cases, the maxilla is typically narrow compared to the lower jaw and must be expanded outward. An expansion appliance is placed in the maxilla 6–9 months prior to correct any crossbite or upper arch constriction. This will widen the cleft size, and so that parents and patients need to be warned the symptoms such as fluid reflux may worsen, although some centres will expand the jaw after surgery is complete. In the case of double clefts, expansion is typically before surgery because the premaxilla needs to be repositioned forward, which cannot occur until the upper jaw is widened to allow room. ===Surgical correction=== Incisions used in alveolar cleft grafting. Red arrow marks oro-nasal fistula, blue lines mark incisions The goals of the surgery are to: # Close any fistulas between the mouth and the nose # Leave keratinized tissue around the tooth margins # Create enough bone to stabilize the maxilla and allow teeth to erupt without a bone defect At surgery, the gingiva is incised along the cleft margin to allow creation of pocket of tissue up towards the nose (recreating a nasal floor), and down towards the mouth (recreating a palate, and closing the palatal opening). The bony edges of the cleft are cleaned, and any extra teeth in the cleft are removed. The gingiva along the outside part of the upper jaw is raised, so that it can be drawn forward to close the cleft. After creation of the pocket, but before suturing closed the gingiva a bone graft is placed into the bony defect. This is most commonly harvested from the anterior hip but can also be obtained from other sites, donor bone, or bioactive materials such as bone morphogenic proteins. Once packed the cleft is filled with bone material the gingiva is sutured closed to create a water tight closure between the mouth and the nose. ===Source of bone graft=== Location of the incision to harvest bone from the anterior iliac crest The most common source of the bone graft is from the iliac crest, harvested at the time of the cleft closure. Other sources such as the chin, and posterior iliac crest, or skull can also be used. Artificial grafts such as demineralized bone, recombinent bone morphogenic protein or a mix of harvested bone and artificial grafts have also been used. Insufficient data exists to show that one is beneficial over the other. ==Recovery== The mouth wounds recover in 7–10 days with precautions for fluid only diet for 5 days, and not to increase pressure in the nose or sinuses for 2–3 weeks. Evidence that the bone graft is forming will be seen on x-ray at about 8 weeks. Movement of teeth into the graft can begin at 3 months once bone graft consolidation is seen on xray. Recovery from the bone harvest will vary depending on the site (if harvested) with the anterior iliac crest being sore for 2–3 weeks. Success of the bone graft with the first surgery are approximately 85% but may vary with technique and bone grafting material. Orthodontics after surgery can close the space between the central incisor and maxillary canine in 50-75% of cases, and for those who can't have the space closed the gap can be filled with a dental implant once growth has finished. Orthodontics start 3 months after surgery. ==History== The first attempts at bone grafting cleft patients were made by Lexer (1908) and Drachter (1914). Between 1921 and 1952 various attempts were made to graft patients using the turbinate, rib and other harvest sites. Schmid (1954) at meetings in 1951 and 1952 reported on the treatment of patients using iliac crest bone grafts but stated, \\"The procedure has merely been presented for discussion\\". By 1964 the iliac crest bone graft had gained popularity and was presented at multiple meetings. ==See also== *Cleft lip and cleft palate *Palatal expansion == References == Category:Surgical procedures and techniques Category:Oral and maxillofacial surgery Category:Dentistry procedures Category:Tissue transplants Category:Oral surgery ","title":"Alveolar cleft grafting"},{"id":"60304492","text":"Renilla koellikeri (also spelled R. kollikeri or R. köllikeri) is a species of sea pen that has been reported from the southern coast of California, including Santa Barbara, California. ==References== Williams, Gary C. \\"Index Pennatulacea Annotated Bibliography and Indexes of the Sea Pens (Coelenterata: Octocorallia) of the World 1469-1999\\".

Partially documentary and partially based on a true story Western, it reflects on the events of the 1917 Bisbee Deportation, 100 years later; it is set in Bisbee, Arizona, both in 1917 and 2017. ==Synopsis== Five years after its statehood and a few months after the United States' entry into World War I, xenophobia and anti-unionism is growing in the southernmost towns of Arizona near the Mexican border. In Bisbee, immigrant workers organized and were violently rounded up and transported to the desert in New Mexico; not as famous as the events in nearby Tombstone, the deportation didn't live in the national memory, but is quietly remembered by the townsfolk today. And so at the 100 year anniversary, Bisbee citizens organized a re- enactment. The events unfold again, as if they were happening in 1917, framed alongside interviews with the present day locals. ==Production== Multiple producers are listed for the film, they are, alphabetically: Susan Bedusa, Dan Cogan, Geralyn White Dreyfous, Bennett Elliott, Davis Guggenheim, Laurene Powell Jobs, Jenny Raskin, Jonathan Silberberg, Nicole Stott, Douglas Tirola, Scott Woelfel, and Stacey Woelfel. The cast are local people, with a lot of focus placed on Fernando Serrano, a young Mexican-American who became the face of the film. His performance has been praised by several critics. The film was scored by Keegan DeWitt, with Vox saying that the score \\"sounds ripped from a ghost movie, spiky and glassy and a little dissonant\\", but that it fits the tone of the film. ==Critical response== On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 93% based on reviews from 58 critics . It is listed as a \\"must see\\" with \\"universal acclaim\\" on Metacritic, having an 87 average from 22 reviews. Writing for RogerEbert.com, Matt Zoller Seitz gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising its exploration of more than just the event itself and for the use of certain images, saying about both that \\"a series of shots of carved-out quarry rock, the multicolored layers stacked up in the frame become metaphors for the movie you're watching, one of many that Bisbee '17 supplies as it goes along\\". He also wrote that Errol Morris was clearly a big influence on the film. Vanity Fair looked closer at the interviews with Bisbee residents, and compared the debate with the nation's present political situation in 2017; it notes that some of the views are \\"disconcerting\\" but is glad that the film doesn't make judgement. Alissa Wilkinson of Vox.com also compared the past with the present, calling the film an \\"unsettling cipher for America\\". The film's use of acting within its narrative has been compared to the other Greene films Actress and Kate Plays Christine by multiple reviewers. ==References== Category:2018 films Category:American films based on actual events Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:Documentary films about labor relations in the United States Category:History of labor relations in the United States Category:Labor- related violence in the United States Category:Miners' labor disputes in the United States Category:Labor disputes in Arizona Category:Riots and civil disorder in Arizona Category:History of Arizona Category:History of Cochise County, Arizona Category:Bisbee, Arizona Category:Vigilantism in the United States ","title":"Bisbee '17"},{"id":"60304722","text":"The Anisette Bottle (1914) by Juan Gris The Anisette Bottle is a 1914 painting by Juan Gris, now in the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid.

In defiance of a ban on public gatherings in Berlin the KPD organized a rally to celebrate May Day. Although fewer supporters showed than what the KPD hoped, the response by the Berlin Police was immediate and harsh, with police using firearms against mostly unarmed civilians. During the three days of rioting 33 civilians were killed and over a thousand would be taken into police custody. The event would be a significant moment in the decline of the Weimar Republic and its political stability. The incident also marked a turning point in relations between the center-left SPD government and the far-left Moscow-aligned KPD, weakening any prospect of a united left-wing opposition to fascism and the rising National Socialist German Workers Party. Criticisms of the severity of the police response also led to a further erosion of public trust in the government. ==Background== The Social Democratic Party (SPD) had emerged with the largest number of seats in the Reichstag from the 1928 German federal election, with 153 of the 491 seats. This victory was due to its leading position in the Weimar Coalition and the politically liberal, economically prosperous Golden Twenties. Due to its coalition agreements with centrist and even right-wing parties, however, the extent to which it could pursue meaningful reforms addressed at labor relations and workers' rights were curtailed. The KPD, meanwhile, remained one of the largest and most politically potent communist parties in Europe and actually saw its total number of seats increase in the 1928 election from 45 to 54. The KPD was led by Ernst Thälmann, who supported a close orientation with the Soviet Union and the Communist International. At the time, the dominant position supported by Moscow was that social democracy was a form of social fascism that frustrated rather than helped the proletariat. Accordingly, the KPD under Thälmann pursued a hostile, confrontational position toward the SPD as defenders of the capitalist status quo. This perception was encouraged by numerous anti- communist SPD politicians in the German and Prussian governments, including Chancellor Hermann Müller, Interior Minister Carl Severing, Prussian Prime Minister Otto Braun, Prussia Interior Minister Albert Grzesinski, and Berlin police chief Karl Zörgiebel. Despite its ideals of democracy and liberalism, the Weimar Republic had acquired heavily militaristic state institutions accustomed to using repressive methods from its authoritarian predecessor. The Berlin Police used military-style training methods and was criticized both for its reactionary culture and acquisition of infantry weapons and equipment. The police were regularly involved in political violence throughout the 1920s, including against communist dissidents. This led to a willingness among the Berlin Police to use a \\"a military advantage to inflict a decisive defeat on the 'proletarian enemy.'\\" Headline of Der Abend (The Evening), late edition of Vorwärts, on April 29, 1929: \\"200 Dead on May 1? The Criminal Plans of the Communists\\" The KDP had a paramilitary wing, the Roter Frontkämpferbund (RFB), which had a history of clashing with police. Like the Nazi Sturmabteilung (SA), the RFB operated in small mobile fighting squads trained (to various degrees) in street fighting. In late 1928 four people had died in fights between paramilitary groups. In December 1928 Zörgiebel issued a ban on open- air gatherings in Berlin, citing a recent stabbing involving RFB members. The ban also appeared to affirm the official communist party line that capitalism had entered its Third Period and therefore the state would become more draconian in obstructing efforts to organize the proletariat. In the lead-up to the 1929 celebration of International Workers' Day on the first of May, KPD-affiliated newspapers urged members and sympathizers to take to the streets. The KPD urged workers to defy the ban and organize peacefully, but to be prepared to strike on May 2 \\"if Zörgiebel dares to spill workers' blood.\\" The newspaper Die Rote Front stressed \\"the sharpened movement of the power organs of the capitalist State against the proletariat\\" in describing potential police violence against communists. The SPD newspaper Vorwärts reported SPD politician Franz Künstler's belief that the KPD was seeking to intentionally sacrifice supporters' lives, saying the party would have to \\"reckon with\\" 200 dead. SPD support for the ban, however, was not unanimous, given the irony of a social democratic government preventing public gatherings on an international holiday for working men and women. Meanwhile, the National Socialist newspaper Der Angriff declared in April 1929 that the SPD and KPD fighting among themselves represented a \\"favorable wind\\" for the Nazi Party. ==Riots of May 1-3== On May 1 the KPD failed to organize a showing greater than normal, the majority of demonstrators coming from communist strongholds in northern and eastern Berlin. Most businesses operated normally. SPD- affiliated trade unions held their own peaceful, well-attended meetings in closed assemblies. The Berlin Police, however, still responded in force to the open-air gatherings, with flying squads arriving in trucks and attacking any civilians with truncheons where any demonstration was reported. When the lawful indoor conventions dispersed and people took to the streets for home, the police arrested people merely because they found themselves on the incorrect side of a police checkpoint or were caught up in fleeing a police sortie. Law enforcement handled the defiance of the ban as if it were the popular revolt the communist press had called for, rather than the confused and haphazard act of civic disobedience that it truly was. The police soon cleared the streets in central Berlin. In the Wedding district, home to many communist supporters, police violence gradually escalated into persistent street combat, including civilians erecting barricades. The Berlin Police began to use firearms, and one of the first victims killed was a man who was watching from his window. The police would later be criticized for not warning about shooting on sight. Two other victims were shot through doors, including an 80-year-old man in his apartment. Most of the fighting was limited to Kösliner Street in Wedding and by midnight most of the area was under police control. In the southeast, in the Neukölln district (another KPD bulwark) around the Hermannstrasse, the rioting would last into the evening, with the police using personnel carriers and armored cars, occasionally aiming their weapons at residences. Berlin Police in the streets of Neukölln. On May 2 Severing met with Grzesinski and Prussian Prime Minister Braun. They immediately banned the primary German communist newspaper Die Rote Fahne, both as a consequence of its incitement but also to hinder news spreading of the high civilian casualties. In the Reichstag, KPD politician Wilhelm Pieck condemned Zörgiebel as a \\"common murderer.\\" The KPD had called for a general strike on May 2 in response to the police violence, but as with the May Day turnout, this was met with limited success. The KPD claimed 25,000 people went on strike in Berlin on May 2, 3, and 4 and an additional 50,000 walked out in sympathy throughout Germany. The RFB, previously operating underground in fear of outright proscription, joined the rioting in Wedding during the afternoon of May 2, once more constructing barricades in largely spontaneous defensive actions. Gunfire was exchanged between the communist militants and the police in the streets. Contemporary police and media accounts depict a balanced urban battle between both sides, although modern scholars dispute this. For example, the Berlin Police attacked Kösliner Street from both ends, giving the perception gunfire was coming from each side of the barricades. The police also enforced a general curfew, leading to confused confrontations in the darkness. Finally, the communists were not as armed or prepared as the police, some having looted a hardware store for starting pistols that sounded like firearms but fired no bullets. By the afternoon of May 3 the fighting had ended and on May 6 the Berlin Police lifted martial law in the Wedding and Neukölln districts. Grzesinski extended the ban on the RFB from Berlin to all of Prussia; by May 15 the RFB and its youth wing, the Rote Jungfront (RJ), were illegal throughout the country. Police conducted house-to-house searches in Wedding and made further arrests, heightening the political tension produced by the riots. By this point the harsh police suppression had led to a full furor in the Reichstag and the Prussian Diet, with heavy media coverage by independent and partisan newspapers. ==Aftermath== It was determined that over thirty people were killed, all civilians, and all by police firearms save for one individual struck by a speeding police van. Around 200 were injured and approximately 1,200 were arrested, with only 44 imprisoned (five were RFB members). Eight of the civilians killed were women and nineteen were Wedding residents. Of the first 25 victims, two were SPD members and seventeen belonged to no party; none were KPD members. Most police reports stated the identity of the killer was unknown. Police found no evidence that the demonstrators who took to the streets were prepared for armed insurrection, with the house-to-house search in Wedding producing mostly souvenirs from World War I. A little over a month after the riots the KPD held its Twelfth Party Congress in Berlin. It passed a resolution calling the rioting \\"a turning-point in political developments in Germany... The preconditions are appearing for the approach of an immediately revolutionary situation, with the development of which the armed uprising must inevitably step onto the agenda.\\" The KPD deepened their commitment to opposing the SPD as a fascist institution who would use instruments of the state against them. Yet there was less recognition that the KPD had failed to muster the sort of national or even local influence in Berlin to actually launch a rebellion of credible danger to the status quo. The rioting had been less motivated by KPD clamoring as it was a more or less spontaneous reaction to the heavy-handed police tactics, even if the neighborhoods in question were occupied predominately by communists. The SPD had their equivalent of the \\"social fascism\\" perspective in its leaders' anxieties over a new Spartacist uprising. Although the KPD did desire to overthrow the Weimar Republic, extremist parties did not have the same appeal they would enjoy after the Great Depression of 1929 hit Germany. The SPD government considered the KPD more of a threat than the Nazi Party, as evidenced by Grezesinski lifting a ban on Adolf Hitler speaking publicly in September 1928. \\"Hysterical assessments\\" by SPD politicians of the threat posed by the KPD combined with the militant nature of the Berlin police meant that conflict and even violence between the two groups was probable if not inevitable. == References == Category:1929 in Europe Category:1929 in Germany Category:Politics of the Weimar Republic Category:Political violence Category:Protests in Germany Category:Communist Party of Germany Category:Anti-communism in Germany Category:Riots and civil disorder in Germany ","title":"Blutmai"},{"id":"60305082","text":"Harens is a surname.

She was the founder of the Universal Chiropractors' Association (now known as American Chiropractic Association). After suffering from many health issues, she tried chiropractic as a last resort and found that it worked completely for her. She then worked as a chiropractic until the age of 79. ==Biography== Ashworth is often referred to as the “Grand Old Lady of Chiropractic”, as she was the matriarch of a long line of the Cleveland family of notable chiropractors. Sylva was a single mother of four children, and she suffered severe health problems, including “valvular” heart trouble, diabetes with leg ulcers, cystic tumors, and dropsy; due to these issues, she was not expected to survive more than a few months when she first tried chiropractic as a last resort from a local Nebraska chiropractor. Her recovery was considered complete and inspired her to devote her life to the chiropractic field. This led her to enroll at the Palmer School of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa, and she graduated in May 1910 at the age of 35. Her long legacy of accomplishments and contributions to the profession started immediately after returning to her home state of Nebraska, where she started private practice and continued to practice until the age of 79 (in 1954). Her accomplishments include a reputation as a charitable practitioner delivering chiropractic care to death row inmates of the Nebraska penitentiary in Lincoln, 1918 Influenza victims, and many others in her community. In 1921, the Lincoln Herald credited her with the largest chiropractic practice in the state, and one of the largest in the United States.

During the campaign, McClellan vowed to do a better job of prosecuting the Union Army effort in the American Civil War than incumbent U.S. President Abraham Lincoln did. Ultimately, the McClellan-Pendleton ticket lost to the National Union ticket of Abraham Lincoln and former U.S. Senator Andrew Johnson. ==1864 Democratic National Convention== Connecticut Governor Thomas Seymour ran against McClellan for the 1864 Democratic presidential nomination and lost. General Sherman's capture of Atlanta in 1864 reduced McClellan's chances of winning the U.S. Presidency that year. A map of the results of the 1864 U.S. presidential election. By the summer of 1864, the United States had been at war with the Confederacy for over three years (with 250,000 Union soldiers dying as a result of this war by this point in time and even more Union soldiers becoming maimed or crippled by this war) and Union victory in this war was not yet in sight. Democrats were energized by what they saw as \\"death, debt, and destruction with no end in sight\\" and also hoped to capitalize on public opposition to various policies of incumbent U.S. President Abraham Lincoln such as \\"emancipation, the military draft, the use of black troops, and violations of civil liberties.\\" Democrats also argued that the Republicans were advocating in favor of miscegenation (sexual relations and marriage between people of different races) trying to destroy the traditional race relations in the United States. The delegates at the 1864 Democratic National Convention adopted proposals by former Congressman Clement Vallandigham and Congressman Fernando Wood for a cease-fire and a negotiated settlement with the Confederacy to end the American Civil War. However, the delegates also chose War Democrat George McClellan as their Presidential nominee. In his fight for the Democratic nomination, McClellan beat out New York Governor Horatio Seymour (who would become the Democratic presidential nominee himself just four years later) and former Connecticut Governor Thomas Seymour--both of whom ran as peace candidates. Once former Treasury Secretary James Guthrie withdrew from consideration, the Democratic vice presidential nomination went to Ohio Congressman George Pendleton. ==The campaign== After he captured the Democratic presidential nomination, McClellan repudiated the peace plank of the Democratic platform and instead vowed to continue the war effort and to do a better job with this than the incumbent Lincoln Administration was doing. McClellan emphasized the fact that he previously led the Union military effort in the American Civil War and that he was and remains committed to \\"the restoration of the Union in all its integrity\\" due to his belief that the massive sacrifices that the Union endured during this war should not be in vain. Incumbent U.S. President Abraham Lincoln worried about his reelection chances and was afraid that if McClellan won the election, the Copperheads (the Peace faction of the Democratic Party) would successfully pressure McClellan to recant his campaign promise to continue the war. Thus, Lincoln made his Cabinet secretly promise to cooperate with McClellan if he won the election to win the war by the time that McClellan will be inaugurated. Fortunately for Lincoln, the tide of the war effort began to turn in the Union's favor in the autumn of 1864 as a result of Union General William Tecumseh Sherman's capture of Atlanta on September 2 as well as Sherman's subsequent military successes. These successes increased Lincoln's popularity and reduced McClellan's chances of defeating Lincoln in November 1864. ==Results== With a voter turnout of 78%, incumbent U.S. President Abraham Lincoln won a decisive victory in the November general election. Lincoln won 55% of the popular vote to McClellan's 45% and received over 90% of the total electoral votes (212 for Lincoln versus 21 for McClellan). Lincoln's popular vote victory was the largest since 1828 and wouldn't be surpassed again until 1872. In this election, McClellan did the best in the cities and among Irish-Americans and German-Americans (many of whom were immigrants). Meanwhile, Lincoln received the votes of 78% of all Union soldiers and sailors--something that, while not being decisive in Lincoln's victory--did help Republicans win some additional seats in the U.S. Congress and recapture control of several state legislatures. However, McClellan could bask in the fact that he won 48% of the total vote in a bloc of U.S. states stretching from Connecticut to Illinois (Lincoln's home state), that Lincoln underperformed in 1864 relative to 1860 in several crucial U.S. states (such as New York, Pennsylvania, and Indiana), and that the Republicans lost the Governorship in his (McClellan's) home state of New Jersey. ==References== Category:Democratic Party (United States) presidential campaigns Category:1864 United States presidential campaigns Category:Democratic Party (United States) ","title":"George McClellan 1864 presidential campaign"},{"id":"60305326","text":"The Fontenette-Bienvenu House, at 201 N.

She is currently based in Palmerston North. Bek is related to Steve Coogan through their fathers, who are cousins. == Education == Coogan completed a Masters in Fine Arts (First Class Honours) at Massey University in 2004, and a Graduate Diploma in Secondary Teaching at Victoria University of Wellington in 2012. == Music == Coogan first appeared on the New Zealand music scene in 2004 as part of art-rock band Cortina. Their music was described as a fusion of \\"heavy metal guitar (courtesy of Ace Hurt aka Matt Hunt), odd synth noises, and bizarre lyrics (“ILLUMINATI! JENNY SHIPLEY!”).\\" Gareth Shute described her stage persona and dress as \\"an insane, but stylish 80s housewife: tight jumpsuits, tinted sunglasses, and headbands. At one show at Bodega, Wellington, she squeezed a pie out of the slit in the front of her satin/lace one piece jumpsuit and began scooping out pieces to feed to the crowd. One another occasion, she was recovering from a car accident and completed a national tour wearing a neck brace with “fucked off” scrawled across it.\\" Luke Rowell of Disasteradio characterised her performances as \\"breaking down the hierarchy between performer and audience.\\" In 2013, she formed the group Fantasing with Sarah Jane Parton, Claire Harris, and Gemma Syme. A combination of installation art and live performance, they were the Audio Foundation's artists in residence in 2016. Coogan described the group's emotional and artistic support of each other as central to their practice; \\"Sometimes that is kind of the art.\\" She has also performed solo as Oona Verse and Sheville, and was a member of the band Full Fucking Moon. Coogan is part of the Wellington International Ukulele Orchestra, with whom she toured various parts of the world between 2012 and 2016, including a month at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2013. Member Andy Morley-Hall describes Coogan: \\"My mum calls Bek The Original Rebel. I reckon she's like a cosmic whirlwind of new and refreshing ideas. She doesn't see the world quite like the rest of us do. Though she thinks deeply about things she is the opposite of earnest.\\" Coogan performed the role of Janet in Frankensplurta, a musical prequel to the Rocky Horror Picture Show, in the March 2018 Dunedin Fringe Festival. == Art == Coogan first exhibited her drawings in 2002, which began an ongoing practice based around a character called Sheville and referencing a mythic female utopia. Her influences range from the painter Colin McCahon to feminist, punk- inspired drawing and collage. She has continued to exhibit and perform widely, including shows at Enjoy Gallery, The New Zealand Film Archive and Depot Artspace in Devonport. Coogan was a contributor to the New Zealand women's comics anthology Three Words, in which she describes her practice: \\"Coogan is a multidisciplinary artist who likes to test what Art is. Bek sees Performance Art, Video, Bands and Drawing as an active and politicised ideology. Art is a call to the wild or to the source, which Bek endures the shit-fight to get back to using whatever medium she can get her hands on, a vivid or a microphone drawing it up from the earth...There was, and is still now an idealistic aspect to this practice, positing an alternative female and mythic utopia. \\"But why the farg is it even idealist?\\" says Sheville, \\"this shit is normal where I come from.\\" Coogan has also been the subject of paintings by Liz Maw. == Publications == * Bryce Galloway, Caroline Campbell, Gavin Hipkins, David Hall, Bek Coogan, Adrian McNabb, Clem Devine, Jason Lingard, John Douglas (2002) Incredibly hot sex with hideous people #8 : Exquisite corpse II. * Coogan, Bek (Summer 2006) \\"Sheville\\" Natural Selection 5 * Full Fucking Moon.

Montalvo's own record label Ophelia released it on February 16, 2018. ==Background and release== \\"Calling You Home\\" was announced to the debut release of Montalvo's own record label, Ophelia. Alongside the announcement, Montalvo released a statement regarding Ophelia, writing: Billboard Dance's Matt Medved interviewed Montalvo during Miami Music Week at SiriusXM's \\"House of Chill\\". In which, they talked about the launch of Ophelia, saying that the song was \\"more of like a throwback to old school Seven Lions stuff\\" and that the record label would be able to do \\"all the stuff that a bigger record label would do but with a smaller team.\\" On February 16, 2018, the song was released as a digital download on international digital stores through record label Ophelia, as well as being released through various music streaming services. Prior to release, Calling You Home appeared as a scarcely-played ID in several of Montalvo's live sets. Alongside the song's release, Montalvo announced Chronicles, an experimental live show that was planned to debut at the WaMu Theatre in Seattle on May 12, 2018. The show was planned to feature various artists alongside Montalvo, including Liquid Soul, Kill the Noise, and Jason Ross. ==Remixes== An extended play of \\"Calling You Home\\" was released on March 14, 2018; it features three remixes by two artists, including American chillout artist Direct and English house and trance musician Oliver Smith. EDMTune's William Vance described Direct's remix as one that \\"brings on the downtempo chill-out feels in full force. With laidback drums and dreamy vocal chops to dazzle up the soundscape, it is easy to get lost in his otherworldly take.\\" Writing for RaverRafting, Tori Matthews noted the faster pace and trance-inspired melody in Oliver Smith's remix, writing that Smith \\"isn’t afraid to bring in some dark elements with that ominous synth before totally lifting us up again. And then it’s just a masterful back and forth between both moods.\\" ==Critical reception== \\"Calling You Home\\" was well received by most critics. Dancing Astronaut's Farrell Sweeney wrote that the song has the \\"capacity to appeal to a diverse group of fans as well with its mystical vibe\\", stating that \\"Runn's vocals are a focal point of the track, but pulsing basslines with dramatic breaks and builds captivate the listener to their chore.\\" Diana Jadd of EDM Sauce described the song as one that is \\"filled with stunning vocals, wonderful melodic chords and obsessively great drops\\" Your EDM's Karlie Powell stated the song played out \\"gloriously with ethereal vocals, euphoric melodies, and straight up addictive drops — all of which make this track a worthy first release for the label.\\" Lisa-sun Nguyen of EDM Identity praised the song, describing it as a song that could be instantly recognised to be produced by Montalvo, writing that the song was \\"This new track is completely representative of his signature sound, which combines beautiful vocals, catchy lyrics, and dubstep for an epic track.\\" ==Track listing== ==Release history== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" !Region !Date !Format !Version !Label ! -  rowspan=\\"2\\" scope=\\"row\\" Worldwide  February 16, 2018  rowspan=\\"2\\" Digital download  \\"Calling You Home\\" (feat.

The reforms were diverse and varied, however the three main ones were: * Creation of the Costa Rican Social Security Fund that universalized healthcare. Through the enactment of the law of the Savings Bank, all employers were obliged to insure their employees and make the corresponding payments to the worker-employer's quota, which allowed the insured, his spouse and his immediate ascending or descending family to receive healthcare by half of the services of the Fund. All minors under the age of 18 who are resident in the country without distinction of nationality are automatically insured by the state. Uninsured persons (unemployed, for example) can also receive the services of the Caja on credit and generally at lower costs than a private medical service.http://www.ts.ucr.ac.cr/binarios/pela/pl-000358.pdf * Creation of the University of Costa Rica, which provides higher education to Costa Ricans. The UCR became the best university in Central America and is currently rated as one of the best in the world ranking of universities.http://www.nacion.com/2012-08-07/ElPais/UCR-sube-118-puestos-en- ranquin-mundial.aspx. * Promulgation of the Labor Code, a labor law that covers all workers in Costa Rica and that posed a series of pioneering rights for the time in any country in Latin America, including the minimum wage, eight-hour workday, holidays, vacations, social charges, Aguinaldo (compulsory Christmas bonus), double payment of salary to work on holidays, the right to strike and severance payments in case of being dismissed without justification, as well as the specific reasons for which an employee can be dismissed without a severance payment (although in this case the accrued vacation and aguinaldos must still be paid, this being part of the salary and not bonuses). These reforms were included in a specific chapter of the Political Constitution.http://www.laboralred.net/leer.php/195 ==The 48 War== The Social Guarantees generated great popular support but also the discontent and anger of the most powerful classes including the coffee oligarchy, the creole aristocracy, some intellectual sectors and won the distrust of the US government that looked badly on Calderon's relationship with communism.Castro Vega, Óscar Figueres y la Constituyente del 49 EUNED In addition, a series of measures taken by the Calderonista government swelled the ranks of the opposition, as was the persecution of Germans and Italians, which included the confiscation of their property and their detention in concentration camps after declaring war on the Third Reich during the World War II, accusations of electoral fraud and corruption as well as accusations of repression of opponents. In the opposition, among others, José Figueres Ferrer was at the time a little-known character who would have a huge role in post-war Costa Rican politics, Otilio Ulate Blanco, a journalist and a conservative politician, León Cortés Castro, an ex-president who had served in Calderon's own Republican Party but later defected and was even an opposition candidate in 1944. Cortés has been accused of sympathies for fascism and anti-Semitism, during his government he persecuted Jews and communists, the opposite of Calderón who was an ally of the Communist Party and who persecuted Germans and Italians when declaring war on fascism. Castro was a candidate against the Republican candidate supported also by the communists Teodoro Picado Michalski, the son of a Polish immigrant whose community had been persecuted by Cortés. In 1948 after that year's elections between the Victory Bloc (the coalition of Calderón and Communists, the latter participating as part of the so-called Popular Fronts that took place in several nations at the international level) that nominated Calderón for the second time and the opposition that postulated Ulate, both sides are accused of electoral fraud and the war of 48 breaks out. The opposition camp was led by José Figueres, commander of the National Liberation Army, along with various allies such as the Caribbean Legion and the anti-communist forces led by Frank Marshall who had dual Costa Rican and German nationality and whose family had been persecuted by Calderón. The opposition wins the civil war defeating Calderonismo. Calderón goes into exile in Nicaragua and then in Mexico as well as Mora Valverde also emigrates to Mexico. However, before the end of the war Mora and Figueres negotiate by signing the Pact of Ochomogo and the Pact of the Embassy of Mexico, where Mora is committed to surrender in exchange for Figueres does not revert Social Guarantees, which Figueres agrees. In fact, Figueres himself, who exercised the de facto presidency for less than two years before giving power to Otilio Ulate, made a series of socialist and progressive reforms that included the creation of the Costa Rican Institute of Electricity, women's suffrage, the end of racial segregation (before 48 blacks could not leave certain areas or vote), the nationalization of the Bank and the abolition of the army. That is why it is generally accepted in Costa Rican historiography that the four great social reformers of the country were Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia, Manuel Mora Valverde, José Figueres Ferrer and Víctor Manuel Sanabria Martínez. The first three created their own ideologies of transcendence throughout history such as Calderonismo, Figuerismo and communismo a la tica (tico-style communism). Figueres said he was visited by several representatives of the most conservative business, including Ricardo Castro Beeche, Francisco Jiménez Ortiz (shareholder of the Nation Group), Fernando Lara Bustamante and Sergio Carballo who urged him to roll back the Social Guarantees and abolish the Labor Code and the Costa Rican Social Security Fund, offering him in return the presidency of the country and placing the Great Capital and the press at his service. Figueres declined indignantly and reported it to Ulate. ==Outcome== Social Guarantees had an important impact on Costa Rican social and economic development. Universal healthcare has allowed the country to have one of the highest health rates (it is currently considered an important destination for medical tourism and has the highest levels of lowest of infant mortality in Latin America only below Cuba), compulsory public education up to high school has allowed it to have a literacy level of 98% (one of the highest in Latin America) while the creation of the ICE has provided the country with accessibility in telecommunications and electrification of 90% of the territory. Another important aspect is the Labor Code, which provides Costa Rican wage earners with a series of rights that are even higher than those of some developed countries (such as the United States) and according to some studies may have contributed to the creation of a strong middle class.http://elalumbradopublico.com/2013/01/15/clase-media-ubica-a-costa-rica- en-cuarto-lugar-de-america-latina/ In any case in Costa Rica there was never the semifeudalization that occurred in the rest of Central America, and since its identity began to develop, the differences between social classes were never very marked.http://www.ina.ac.cr/biblioteca/biblioteca_central/bib_HISTORIADECOSTARICA.pdf ==See also== * Reform State ==References== Category:History of Costa Rica Category:Politics of Costa Rica Category:20th century in Costa Rica ","title":"Social Guarantees"},{"id":"60306697","text":"Wendell Mosley (1932 – December 31, 1989) was an American football player and coach.

The Gymnasium featured a swimming pool, men's and women's locker rooms, a main-floor gymnasium, 1/16-mile running track, a batting cage, a full range of gymnastics equipment and a 2,500-seat auditorium. The gymnasium served many purposes including dances, enrollments, commencements, concerts, lectures, and even as emergency housing immediately after World War II. The men's basketball team amassed a 148–28 record at Robinson before the team moved to the larger Hoch Auditorium in 1927. The gymnasium was demolished in November 1967 and was replaced with Wescoe Hall. == References == Category:Indoor arenas in Kansas Category:Defunct college basketball venues in the United States Category:Kansas Jayhawks basketball Category:Sports venues in Kansas Category:University of Kansas campus ","title":"Robinson Gymnasium"},{"id":"60307192","text":"Syllis is a genus of marine bioluminescent polychaete worms. ==References== Category:Polychaete genera Category:Bioluminescent annelids Category:Syllidae ","title":"Syllis"},{"id":"60307194","text":"Act. 5 New Action is the third extended play by South Korean girl group Gugudan.

A native of Manhattan, where she was born Jean Herzberg, Lipman grew up in Midtown before receiving her BA from Wellesley College and her MA in art history from New York University, taking as the topic of her master's thesis a collection of profile portraits from Florence. She was married to Howard Lipman, an investment banker and sculptor, who shared her interests. She began collecting folk art in 1936 with the goal of furnishing a home in Connecticut. In 1938 she became an associate editor of Art in America, moving to the position of editor two years later; she remained in this post until 1971, when she moved to the Whitney Museum of American Art to become director of publications. Art in America was devoted to the entire history of American art, but Lipman took especial care to introduce American folk art to its pages; during her tenure it grew from a small scholarly publication, with a circulation of a few hundred, to a widely influential magazine. Jean and Howard Lipman sold their collection of folk art to Stephen Clark of the New York State Historical Association in 1950; nevertheless, she remained committed to the subject, continuing to research and write. She collaborated with Alice Winchester and Mary Black in some of her work, and produced monographs about Rufus Porter and Jurgan Frederick Huge, among other works. With her husband she began again to collect American folk art, selling the new collection to the American Folk Art Museum in 1981. The couple also collected modern American sculptor, eventually acquiring works by Alexander Calder, Donald Judd, Louise Nevelson, and David Smith, among others; these they donated to the Whitney Museum of American Art. Lipman wrote extensively in this field as well. In 1974, Lipman organized an exhibit of American folk art at the Whitney Museum, writing the accompanying book, The Flowering of American Folk Art, with Alice Winchester. In 1980 she and Thomas N. Armstrong III co-edited another exhibition catalogue for the museum. Other exhibits followed in 1986 and 1990. As a historian, Lipman came to specialize in the fields of American painted furniture and folk carving. She was a trustee of the American Folk Art Museum from 1965 to 1978, later becoming a trustee emerita. Later in life, she was also active as a painter and a collage artist; beginning in 1981 she showed her work in numerous museum and gallery shows. Late in life she moved to Carefree, Arizona, where she died. She was survived by her son, Peter, and two grandsons, Howard having died in 1992. The Lipmans' papers are currently housed in the Archives of American Art of the Smithsonian Institution, which also owns an interview conducted with her in 1973. Other archives related to her work are housed at the American Folk Art Museum and the Museum of Modern Art. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1909 births Category:1998 deaths Category:American art historians Category:American women historians Category:Women art historians Category:20th-century American historians Category:20th-century American women writers Category:American magazine editors Category:Women magazine editors Category:Writers from New York City Category:Historians from New York (state) Category:People from Manhattan Category:American art collectors Category:Women art collectors ","title":"Jean Lipman"},{"id":"60307251","text":"Adrian Hill (born in Washington, D.C.) is an American football official in the National Football League (NFL) since the 2010 NFL season, wearing uniform number 29. ==Career== Hill was an official in Conference USA, where he worked at the referee position.

He is the Minister of State Security, a member of the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), an alternate member of the Politburo of the WPK, and a member of the State Affairs Commission of North Korea. ==Family background== Jong's father was Chong Jun Taek, an intellectual at the core of North Korea's early industrialization efforts under Kim Il Sung and who served as the DPRK's Deputy Premier from 1956 to 1961. Chong headed national industrial planning between 1945 and 1950. He worked closely with Kim Il Sung, traveling with the leader to meet Stalin in Moscow in March 1949, and joining Kim's new Military Affairs Commission with the outbreak of the Korean War. After the war he headed North Korea's chemical industry. Chong Jun Taek had an economics university named after him (Chong Jun Taek Kyongje Daehak) in Kangwon in 1960. He traveled to Syria and Sudan in 1972 on diplomatic missions, meeting President Assad. Chong died in 1973 when his son was 10 or 12 years old. ==Career== Jong's appears to have made his career with the Korean People's Army. He first surfaced as a public figure in November 2015, when he was listed on the funeral committee for Ri Ul-sol, the Korean People's Army General and elder Manchurian guerrilla veteran. In early 2017, Kim Won-hong was removed from the role of Minister of State Security (also known was the Director of the State Security Department, SSD). Won-hong had apparently been punished following a party inspection. The appointment of Jong Kyong-thaek as Minister came at the same time as Choe Ryong-hae was appointed director of the Organization and Guidance Department (OGD) which works closely with the SSD. According to North Korea Leadership Watch, \\"Choe's appointment along with the appointment of Jong Kyong Thaek at State Security are no accident... Choe and Jong's new positions represent a kind of house cleaning to avoid some of the problems that have affected State Security during the last 18 months. Choe and Jong's appointments are also intended to usher in 3rd generation DPRK cadres in the internal security services.\\" In this capacity, Jong directs both censorship and counter- intelligence. For instance, during Kim Jong-un's trip to the 2018 North Korea–United States Singapore Summit, Jong \\"supervised the collection, consolidation and analysis of myriad intelligence reports from around the DPRK derived from eavesdropping and SSD's pyramid-like human intelligence networks. Col. Gen. Jong probably supervised the mobilization of additional electronic capabilities and personnel to monitor the DPRK's defense industry.\\" Since October 2017, Jong has been a member of the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and an alternate member of the Politburo of the WPK. At the sixth session of the 13th Supreme People's Assembly on 11 April 2018, Jong also took Kim Won-hong's seat in the State Affairs Commission of North Korea. Jong's military rank is colonel general. He resides in Pyongyang. On 10 December 2018, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on Jong and two other top North Korean leaders, citing abuses and Jong's role in the government of North Korea and the WPK, a step criticized by the Rodong Sinmun. Jong was part of a high- level welcoming delegation for China's paramount leader Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan, greeting them both at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun square and attending an artistic performance with them in Pyongyang on 20 June 2019. Jong was promoted to the rank of general on 23 May 2020. ==See also== * Censorship in North Korea * Politics of North Korea ==References== Category:Living people Category:Workers' Party of Korea politicians Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:1960s births Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:North Korean generals ","title":"Jong Kyong-thaek"},{"id":"60307312","text":"\\"Head Hunter\\" is a song performed by American rock band Dance Gavin Dance.

It was directed by J.C. Gonzalez and written by Elijah Aron and Jordan Young. The episode was released in the United States, along with the rest of season three, via Netflix on July 22, 2016. ==Plot== Having gone sober for 9 months, Sarah Lynn wakes up to a calm and positive life. BoJack calls Sarah Lynn for an invitation to a drinking party, and Sarah Lynn quickly accepts, opens a bottle of vodka, and ends her 9-month sobriety. At night, having drunk excessive amounts of alcohol with Sarah Lynn, BoJack begins to experience blackouts. Throughout the blackouts, the pair watch old episodes of Horsin' Around, visit an AA meeting where BoJack confesses his attempt to sleep with Penny, and visit the houses of Mr. Peanutbutter, Diane, Princess Carolyn, and Ana Spanakopita to make amends. While visiting Ana, BoJack experiences multiple blackouts while trying to hear a story about her lifeguard experience. After experiencing a two-week blackout, BoJack hears the story, in which Ana explains that she became a lifeguard after almost drowning, but was told by her instructor that there are people in this world one should not attempt saving, as they will pull you down in the long run. After another blackout, BoJack is seen driving to Ohio with Sarah Lynn to make amends with Penny. The pair find Penny at a library and follow her to a school party, where they are caught by Penny when BoJack drunkenly trips over a group of boys. Scared, Penny distressedly tells the pair to leave. Driving home, Sarah Lynn finds the BoJack heroin BoJack had been given earlier that year. At home, the pair decide to snort the BoJack heroin, like \\"sophisticated adults\\", rather than inject it. Now high, BoJack experiences a flashback to 2007, in which his former boss, Cuddlywhiskers, told him that The BoJack Horseman Show was gaining bad ratings and that they should cast Sarah Lynn as a guest star. In the present, Sarah Lynn learns that she has won the Oscar for Best Original Song. This saddens her, as she doesn't like who she is, so BoJack finally agrees to visit the Griffith Observatory with Sarah. While inside, Sarah Lynn succumbs to a heroin overdose as BoJack nudges her shoulder and calls her name multiple times. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== The episode received positive reviews from critics. Les Chappell, writing for The A.V. Club, gave the episode an A. He praised the development of BoJack's character, and the show's movement from a comedy to a drama, stating that \\"BoJack Horseman wants to believe that his life is a sitcom... but BoJack Horseman isn’t even close to being a sitcom. For all its bright colors, absurd images, and a plethora of puns, it’s a show whose path is littered with broken things, a dark and uncompromising world more on par with prestige cable dramas.\\" Jenny Jaffe, writing for Vulture, gave the episode a rating of 5 out of 5 stars, lauding the ending of the episode, stating that \\"It is hard to imagine another show putting its characters through quite as much as BoJack [has] suffered over the past three seasons. More impressive is how the writers allow those choices to influence the way each character does or doesn’t grow. “That’s Too Much, Man!” goes a step further still. If you thought BoJack's Oscar campaign might serve as the crux as the season, you severely underestimated just how dark this show can get.\\" Sarah Manuszak, writing for The Bull & Bear, praised Sarah Lynn's character development, stating that \\"Until her death, Sarah Lynn did not get the chance to live her own life.\\" Valerie Ettenhofer, writing for Film School Rejects, noted that this episode was the \\"Tragic Centerpiece of BoJack Horseman\\". ===Accolades=== That's Too Much, Man! was honored at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards. Kristen Schaal, who voiced Sarah Lynn in the episode, received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performance. ==References== ==External links== * \\"That's Too Much, Man!\\" on Netflix * * Category:BoJack Horseman episodes Category:2016 American television episodes Category:Netflix original television series episodes ","title":"That's Too Much, Man!"},{"id":"60307395","text":"Pengkalan Hulu is a state constituency in Perak, Malaysia, that has been represented in the Perak State Legislative Assembly. ==References== Category:Perak State Legislative Assembly ","title":"Pengkalan Hulu (state constituency)"},{"id":"60307399","text":"Bailey Scott (born 9 July 2000) is a professional Australian rules footballer playing for the North Melbourne Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). ==Early life== Scott was born in Melbourne.AFL draft 2018: Sneaky signs that suggested Bailey Scott was destined for North Melbourne His father, Robert, was a professional footballer who played for Geelong and North Melbourne between 1986-2000.

The first event took place on August 17, 1986. ==History== All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling was the only women's professional wrestling promotion prior to 1986. All Japan Women's was experiencing a boom period due to the Crush Gals of Lioness Asuka and Chigusa Nagayo as was Onyanko Club, a Japanese idol music group. Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling was imagined to be a wrestling version of Onyanko Club. All Japan Women's had strict rules, including what became known as \\"the three no's\\" of no drinking, no smoking and no boys, along with a rule that all wrestlers must retire once reaching the age of 25 years old. Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling countered this by having no such rules and due to this were able to recruit Jackie Sato, who was a top All Japan Women's star that was forced to retire at the age of 25. The promotion also was able to recruit Shinobu Kandori, a judoka who had captured the bronze medal at the 1984 World Judo Championships and Nancy Kumi, a former All Japan Women's wrestler. Gran Hamada and Atsushi Onita also joined as coaches. Japan Women's Wrestling had their first show on August 17, 1986. Antonio Inoki and Minako Honda, a famous Japanese idol appeared. This show was notable for featuring the debut of future stars such as Mayumi Ozaki, Dynamite Kansai, Cutie Suzuki and Rumi Kazama along with the main event being Jackie Sato's return from retirement as she faced Shinobu Kandori. Suzuki and Kazama became idol's through music and television, with Kazama appearing in Japan's version of Penthouse. The promotion started to fracture on July 6, 1987, when Sato hit the injured eye of Kandori. The two exchanged words and on July 18, 1987, a match between the two turned into a shoot, which became an infamous incident. In October 1987, Kandori, who had become a free agent due to the incident, appeared at an All Japan Women's show to challenge Yukari Omori. She attempted to join All Japan Women's, but was prevented from doing so due to contractual disputes and eventually returned to Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling. Jackie Sato retired on March 20, 1988. The promotion officially closed on January 26, 1992 and split into two groups: Ladies Legend Pro-Wrestling which featured Shinobu Kandori, Rumi Kazama, Harley Saito and others while JWP formed with Mayumi Ozaki, Dynamite Kansai, Cutie Suzuki and others. ==Alumni== *Jackie Sato *Shinobu Kandori *Nancy Kumi *Mayumi Ozaki *Plum Mariko *Rumi Kazama *Eagle Sawai *Dynamite Kansai *Esther Moreno *Xóchitl Hamada *Cutie Suzuki *Harley Saito *Utako Hozumi ==References== ==See also== *Puroresu Category:Japanese women's professional wrestling promotions Category:Sport in Tokyo ","title":"Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling"},{"id":"60307403","text":"Protosolpuga carbonaria is an extinct species of solifuges, the only one of the genus Protosolpuga and the family Protosolpugidae.

Audie Cornish, Sharon Horgan, and Robert Siegel provide voices in guest appearances in the episode. The episode follows the aftermath of a mass shooting at a mall, including the public relations and business decisions producers make in an effort to show sensitivity while carrying on with business as usual. == Plot == After a mass shooting, Courtney Portnoy's film is delayed.

It has also been known at different times as Silver Creek, Sylvan Creek, and also Rosedale Brook. The former source of Yellow Creek begins near Sheppard West station in the Downsview neighbourhood. Most of the creek and its sources are buried underground in storm sewers until they emerge into Avoca Ravine in the Deer Park neighbourhood and continues its way to the Don River. == Former reach == Much of the former reach of Yellow Creek was buried, starting from its source approximately around Sheppard West station, near Downsview airport. It followed a southeasterly course from there to just south of Rondale Boulevard. Continuing south-east, it was fed by two small streams, one at Bathurst Heights and one near Briar Hill Avenue. == Buried sections == The modern storm sewer main located near the confluence of the two former streams at Bathurst Heights and near Briar Hill Avenue is a major source of water for Yellow Creek. At this portion, Yellow Creek is effectively a buried and channelled stream which flows south via the storm sewer under Chaplin Crescent, which then follows the path underneath beltline south east. The buried creek crosses Yonge street south of the Davisville railyard into Mount Pleasant Cemetery and is further fed by water from the Yonge street storm sewers before emerging from the southern protrusion of the cemetery into the Vale of Avoca. == Surface sections == The surface sections of the creek start at the Vale of Avoca, a deep ravine located in Deer Park. It surfaces at the southern end of Mount Pleasant Cemetery, flows in a southeasterly course to the Park Drive Reservation Ravine,and then towards the east until it empties into the Don River. The creek is buried twice in the two ravines. === Vale of Avoca === The surface section of the creek starts when it flows out into a deep ravine known as the Vale of Avoca (also known as the Avoca Ravine), which forms a large portion of David A. Balfour Park. Although the park contains a significant portion of this ravine, its name is occasionally attributed erroneously to both the ravine and the waterway itself. The creek is crossed at this section by the Vale of Avoca bridge. The creek often spills its banks in the ravine during periods of heavy rain due to diversion of water from storm drains and sewers into the ravines, thus over-exceeding the channels' design limits and causing damage to the trails and footbridges in the ravine. ===Park Drive Reservation Ravine=== Yellow Creek is again buried underground as it exits the Avoca Ravine and flows into the Park Drive Reservation Ravine, surfacing partway in the latter ravine. It enters the sewers again near Bayview Avenue before joining the Don River. ==Restoration== In 2019, The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority identified Yellow Creek as a location which has become a public health concern due to erosion damaging pedestrian paths. Exposed rock retaining walls were removed and replaced with a more gently sloped creek bed which will be less prone to collapse due to erosion. These changes will ultimately allow Yellow Creek to flow without further maintenance and without unnecessary flooding. == References == Category:Rivers of Toronto Category:Dredged rivers and waterways ","title":"Yellow Creek (Toronto)"},{"id":"60307523","text":"Pokok Assam is a state constituency in Perak, Malaysia, that has been represented in the Perak State Legislative Assembly. == References == Category:Perak state constituencies ","title":"Pokok Assam (state constituency)"},{"id":"60307529","text":"Chenderoh is a state constituency in Perak, Malaysia, that has been represented in the Perak State Legislative Assembly. == References == Category:Perak state constituencies ","title":"Chenderoh (state constituency)"},{"id":"60307534","text":"Lubok Merbau is a state constituency in Perak, Malaysia, that has been represented in the Perak State Legislative Assembly. == References == Category:Perak state constituencies ","title":"Lubok Merbau (state constituency)"},{"id":"60307535","text":"Javier Chillon is a Spanish director of films and music videos, known for his \\"bizarre and compelling\\" short films, \\"simply unlike anything anyone else is making\\". Between them, Die Schneider Krankheit (2008), Decapoda Shock (2011), and the English-language They Will All Die in Space (2015) have been screened at over 800 international film festivals and won approximately 140 awards or honours. ==Early life and education== Javier Chillon was born on 16 July 1977 in Madrid. He attended the Universidad Complutense de Madrid and received a licenciate in audiovisual communication, pursuing further education at the Institute of Filmmaking at Solent University, Southampton, where he graduated with a Master of Arts. After his studies, he began working in the audiovisual world and graphic design. ==Career== Miguel Bosé in 2006 ===Music video director=== In 2005, Miguel Bosé released Velvetina, a 13-track audio CD as well as a special edition on Creative Zen which included video clips for each single. Together with Jaime Barnatán, Chillon co-directed the clip for the second track on the album, Aún Más. The video is set in a futuristic dystopia inspired by films like the early George Lucas film THX-1138 and novels such as George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Chillon has since directed three more music videos for Madrid-based bands Waldorf Histeria in 2010 (Dicen que es Satán and Fantasmas), and Delobos in 2018, No One Saves. ===Short film director=== ====Debut==== Making a living as an editor, Chillon undertoook a two-and-a-half-year film project in his spare time obtaining various elements for free or cheaply through his family connections or friends. Chillon's first short narrative film, Die Schneider Krankheit (2008), is a science fiction mockumentary inspired by the \\"Hollywood look of the 50s\\", in particular, the B movies and newsreels from the United States. Shot on black and white Super 8 film, with a Spanish-language voice- over dubbed over another German one, with credits and most other onscreen text in German, the short film gives the impression of being a West German educational documentary film of the 1950s, concerning the effects of an extraterrestrial plague brought to Earth by a Soviet chimpanzee cosmonaut after its capsule crash landed near the border with East Germany in 1958. Financed entirely by Chillon himself, the short film was selected for more than 200 international film festivals and received more than 45 awards within the first two years of its release. Since the release of his first narrative film, Chillon has accumulated many credits as a poster or title designer on several films. ====Later films==== In June 2009, Chillon was in Paris pitching a project called Outfinite, which would \\"pay tribute to sci-fi B movies and blaxploitation pics.\\" The film that became Decapoda Shock, a science fiction action parody film, was filmed between July 2009 and March 2011. In this film, the director allowed himself more spontaneity and improvisation. The film depicts an astronaut infected by an alien crab-like creature, transforming him into a decapod crustacean/human hybrid and whose family has disappeared, both the result of a sinister conspiracy, for which he seeks vengeance. As of 2019, Chillon's second film has been selected for more than 300 international film festivals, and received over thirty awards and honours within the first two years of its release, including a Silver Méliès. Julio Perillán For his third film, Javier Chillon wanted to do something a bit more conventional, a film that was \\"straight up science fiction\\" with no supernatural elements, something closer to a detective story: he had always liked the idea of a starship stranded in space, and one day the story just came to him. They Will All Die in Space (2015) is the director's first English-language film, about a starship technician (Julio Perillán) who is awoken from cryo-sleep and is told that the vessell is adrift and lost in the cosmos, and that he is needed to help repair the communications system to call for help, but quickly realises that something has gone horrifyingly wrong. Like his second film, it has been shown at well over 300 film festivals between its premiere and the end of 2018, and has won approximately sixty awards and honours, including Best Short Film from the 2015 Sitges Film Festival, the most important fantastic film festival in Spain. They Will All Die in Space is included in the 2017 Canadian anthology film, Galaxy of Horrors, which comprises eight shorts within a larger narrative frame, premiering in Toronto at Imagine Cinemas Carlton on 1 March 2017. ==Common themes== As well as the director's use of science fiction elements present in his music videos, the director's first two films share particular themes and plot elements, such as monstrous creatures resulting from \\"spatial\\" mutations or genetic manipulation, primarily derived from the science fiction B movies of the 1950s, the \\"atomic age\\"; as well as animated sequences, and \\"retro-inflected material\\". The plots of both films involve a returning astronaut. ==Filmography== ;Videos *Miguel Bosé: Aún Más (2005) *Waldorf Histeria: Dicen que es Satán (2010) *Waldorf Histeria: Fantasmas (2010) *Delobos: No One Saves (2018) ;Short films *Die Schneider Krankheit (2008) *Decapoda Shock (2011) *They Will All Die in Space (2015) ==References== ==External links== Javier Chillon on IMDb Category:Living people Category:1977 births Category:Spanish film directors Category:Spanish film producers Category:People from Madrid ","title":"Javier Chillon"},{"id":"60307538","text":"Lintang is a state constituency in Perak, Malaysia, that has been represented in the Perak State Legislative Assembly. == References == Category:Perak state constituencies ","title":"Lintang (state constituency)"},{"id":"60307549","text":"Hulu Kinta is a state constituency in Perak, Malaysia, that has been represented in the Perak State Legislative Assembly. == References == Category:Perak state constituencies ","title":"Hulu Kinta (state constituency)"},{"id":"60307552","text":"Canning is a state constituency in Perak, Malaysia, that has been represented in the Perak State Legislative Assembly. == References == Category:Perak state constituencies ","title":"Canning (state constituency)"},{"id":"60307561","text":"Citizen Power Initiatives for China, previously known as Initiatives for China or Citizen Power for China, is pro-democracy movement and NGO committed for a peaceful transition to democracy in China through non-violent strategies.

To prevent this, a group of wizards sealed all the world's magic into a device known as the , and since then, magic has been largely forgotten and wizards have been slowly disappearing, with just a few magical families existing all over the world. In the modern age, however, magic is making a resurgence thanks to the Granbelm, a tournament involving magical girls that pilot giant robots called , with the winner becoming the and becoming able to wield all the magic inside the Magiaconatus.

She has no particular talents or aspirations, so she tries to be as helpful and friendly as possible to make up for it. Beneath this facade, however, she is very insecure about her being \\"empty.\\" After meeting Shingetsu and becoming friends with her, she slowly begins to open up and decides to help make her wish come true. She is eventually revealed to actually be an artificial being created by the Magiaconatus to help Shingetsu win the Granbelm. :Her Armanox is , a white mecha with a sword as its primary armament, through she also has some ranged attacks. Though untrained, as a being made by Magiaconatus, she possessess enormous magical readings and can sometimes enter a state of extreme concentration, during which she is capable of overpowering her opponents through brute force. Shingetsu also teaches her how to summon her own familiar, Orca, a whale-like magical spirit that aids her in battle. :Her given name literally means \\"full moon\\", mirroring Shingetsu. ; : :A mysterious young woman who moved back to Japan from Germany in order to compete in Granbelm. Although she is initially opposed to Mangetsu entering Granbelm, she teams up with her and teaches her how to fight, which leads to their friendship. She was once friends with Anna Fugo, until the latter's jealousy towards her magical talents ended their friendship. This led her to hate magic resulted in her wish for winning the Granbelm being to erase it completely. It is eventually revealed that the Magiaconatus already decided for her to become the Princeps Mage and the entire Granbelm is actually just a test to determine if she's worthy. :Her Armanox is , a black mecha capable of both melee and ranged combat. Due to her experience as a mage, she possesses a large arsenal of spells and tactics. Her trump card is Gnome, a spirit that takes on the form of a giant golem. :Her family name literally means \\"new moon\\", mirroring Mangetsu. === Granbelm participants === ; : :A proud mage descending from one of Europe's most powerful mage families.

By the time she discovered her mother wanted her to live a life free of the pressures of being a mage, it was too late as her jealousy of Shingetsu and obsession with beating her had caused her to fall into madness. She is the third mage to be eliminated from the Granbelm, after being defeated by Shingetsu. Afterwards, her existence was erased from the world, causing everyone not present during the battle to forget about her. :Her Armanox is , a red mecha resembling royalty.

It is also heavily implied, and later confirmed, that she was the one who cursed Kuon's sister Shisui into a coma.

She is the second mage to be eliminated from the Granbelm, after being defeated by Mangetsu.

She participates in the Granblem in the hopes of finding a cure for her sister Shisui, who has fallen into a magically induced coma. She later becomes enemies with Suishō, suspecting that she is responsible for her sister's condition. She also agrees to an alliance with Mangetsu and Shingetsu, so they can survive the Granbelm. Kuon is one of the very few that remembers Anna after her defeat in the Granbelm causes her to be erased from history. As the Granbelm continues, Kuon realizes Suishō consumed a part of Shisui's soul and Suishō uses this particular information in an attempt to demoralize Kuon, but Kuon later discovers that Shisui only did that so that Kuon could have a chance at winning the Granbelm. Despite her renewed efforts, however, Kuon is killed by Suishō and the Magiaconatus alters reality so that everyone, except the remaining Granbelm fighters, forget she ever existed, much like Anna before her. :Her Armanox is the , which can manipulate the environment and uses light-generated fans for battle. === Supporting characters === ; : :Mangetsu's younger sister, who is unaware of her role in the Granbelm.

She has been placed into a coma and Kuon participates in the Granbelm in order to save her. ==Production== The producer of Granbelm, Takayuki Nagatani, approached the anime studio Nexus in wanting to create a new series with them. Nexus told Nagatani that they are interested in creating an anime that features a \\"chibi- style robots\\", and Nagatani accepted the idea as he also love those kind of anime. Nagatani left the creative process to the studio while he would organize it. While hiring the Granbelm 's staff, Nagatani and the studio firstly decided to bring a director, with Nexus suggesting Masaharu Watanabe as the director for the series since they worked with him in his production of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World, thus Watanabe was appointed as the director. The series composition was handled by Jukki Hanada. When deciding on who should be responsible for the series' character design, the staff discussed that they wanted \\"mellow visuals for the anime because it’s the story of girls fighting with all their might\\", hearing that, director Watanabe suggested Shinichiro Otsuka, who's known for illustrating the artwork for Re:Zeros light novel. For the mecha designs, Nexus recommended Jimmy Stone. Nagatani stated that Anna, a controversial character in the series, is the character he liked the most and stated that he understands her \\"personalty\\" and sympathized with the character for carrying a \\"heavy burden\\". He praised Hanada on his ability for making each of the main characters \\"charming as well as unique\\", and states that \\"each character has their own great attributes\\" but Anna is the one that fascinates him the most. Nagatani thinks that as the story progresses, the viewers' favorite character will change. During the scenario meetings, the staff had agreed on the idea of \\"girls and magic\\" themed-series. When asked on why there aren't any male character in the series, Nagatani replied: \\"We decided that the Granbelm would be an all-girl battle pretty early on. I can’t even recall us talking about any male characters joining the battle. We called the participants of the battle ‘witches’ and the story was about the female line of the family. I think that’s why we didn’t even consider a male character. I’d say that it naturally became an all-girls affair.\\" The anime was announced by Nexus on March 1, 2019. The series is directed by Masaharu Watanabe, with Jukki Hanada handling series composition, Shinichirou Otsuka as the original character designer, and Kenichiro Suehiro composing the music. Infinite is producing the anime. Eir Aoi performed the series' opening theme song , while Uru performed the series' ending theme song . ==Release== Granbelm aired from July 5 to September 26, 2019 on the Animeism programming block on MBS, TBS, and BS-TBS.

The PBA Open Conference started in the second offing of the 1977 season through 1979. In 1980-1981, the Open Conference became the PBA's first tournament of the season and in 1985, 1987-1989. Three times in 1982-1983 and 1986, the Open Conference was the season-ending tournament. The only time it was not held was in 1984 where the league had two All-Filipino Conferences. The PBA Open Conferences from 1978-1987 had four semifinalist in a double-round robin, back-to-zero standings to determined the two finalist. The previous year had the first- ever, six-team semifinal cast where Crispa and U/tex played in the finals which the Redmanizers took in the deciding fifth game to win their six straight PBA title. The last two Open Conferences from 1988-1989 had five teams entering the semifinal round. The First Conferences from 1990-1992 may still be considered \\"Open\\" as well as the Third Conference being called \\"Reinforced\\" but like in the first two years of the league in the 1970s, the word \\"Open\\" was rarely written in newspaper articles. ===Trivias / Teams' first championships=== The U/tex Wranglers in 1978, Royal Tru-Orangemen (former team name of San Miguel Beermen) in 1979 and Ginebra San Miguel in 1986 have all won their first PBA championship in the Open tournament. In 1978, U/tex won their first five semifinal assignments to clinch the first finals seat and lost their last game to Crispa, denying the Toyota Tamaraws of a chance to tie Crispa and forge a playoff for the second finals berth. It was a similar case the following year when Royal Tru-Orange won their first five games in the semifinals and it was Toyota's turn to beat the Orangemen in their last outing and nailed the second finals seat and avoid a possible playoff with Crispa. Two of the best final four semifinals took place when the Open Conference was the last conference of the season in 1982-1983. Only one point separates a possible four-way deadlock when Gilbey's Gin beat San Miguel to booked their first finals appearance in 1982. The following year, it happened as all four teams ended up with three wins and three losses each, thus resulting to the first-ever, double-playoff match. Incidentally, three of the four semifinalist in the Open Conferences from 1982 and 1983 were Great Taste (N-Rich in 1982), Gilbey's Gin and San Miguel Beer. The two traditional powerhouses that won the Open title, Toyota Super Corollas in 1982 with Crispa having their worst finish in that conference, and in 1983, Crispa won the Grandslam while Toyota have their worst finish too in their final conference. ===Open Conference Imports=== Two imports were allowed from 1977 to 1983 and again in 1986. While only one import per team in 1985, 1987-1989. In the 1982 Open Conference, six of the eight American reinforcements playing in the semifinals were returning imports. The Toyota-Gilbey's finale were the only time that four returning imports (Andrew Fields, Donnie Ray Koonce, Lew Massey and Larry McNeill) were playing in the PBA championship.

He also did engraving and sculpting. == Biography == He began his art education by taking evening classes, mostly devoted to sculpture, at the \\"National School of Decorative Arts\\". When he first turned to painting, he found his inspiration in the Barbizon School, to which he was introduced by a local artist, originally from Spain, named Antonio Cortès (1827-1908), who had studied with Constant Troyon. Later, he became acquainted with the xylographers, Maximilien Luce and Émile-Gustave Cavallo-Péduzzi, after which he produced posters from lithographs and woodcuts. In 1885, he considered his artistic development to be complete; as reflected in a lengthy letter to Émile Zola, with whom he had long corresponded. He also made an extended stay in Brittany. In June 1890 Gausson was mentioned in a letter from Theo van Gogh to his brother Vincent \\"Vincent Van Gogh: The Letters\\"]. Van Gogh Museum Amsterdam. Retrieved August 24, 2020. in connection with a proposed exchange of paintings which was completed after Vincent’s death. Ever desiring something new, he slowly turned to Synthetism and, from 1889 to 1894, simplified his paintings and brightened his colors. During that period, he participated in avant-garde exhibitions; notably with \\"Les XX\\" in Brussels, the association \\"\\" in Antwerp and in Paris at Le Barc de Boutteville and the \\"Salon des Cent\\". Some of his poster designs were reproduced in the magazine, Les Maîtres de l'Affiche. He also had a connection with the Symbolist movement; corresponding with several noted writers. Later, he would provide illustrations for works by and Gustave Kahn provided commentary for the catalog of Gausson's 1896 exhibition at the Galerie Laffitte. Gausson himself wrote a book of short stories, Histoires vertigineuses (Giddy Stories), but it was not very successful. In 1900, he was named an officer of the Académie des Beaux-Arts for his work on a monument to the builder, at Fontainebleau. Despite his successes, he continued to have financial difficulties. In an effort to alleviate them, he took a position with the French Colonial Administration and was posted to Guinea in 1901, where he spent eight years. Upon returning to France, he settled in Paris. Having no children, he often visited his nephew, who had a small shop in Lagny-sur-Marne. He was there when the German Army occupied Paris in 1940, and remained until his death.Archives of Paris (5th Arrondissement) == Selected paintings == File:L333 - Léo Gausson - Les arbres du quai de la Gourdine à Lagny.jpgTrees on the Banks of the Quai de la Gourdine File:L334 - Léo Gausson - sous bois.JPGUndergrowth File:L336 - Léo Gausson - Les toits pointillés.JPGThe Roofs File:L0577 - Léo Gausson - Le hangar couvert de Chaume à Gouvernes.jpgHangar with a Thatched Roof File:Gausson- selfportrait2.jpgA later self-portrait == References== ==External links== * Le site de Léo GAUSSON * More works by Gausson @ ArtNet Category:1860 births Category:1944 deaths Category:French painters Category:French landscape painters Category:French poster artists Category:People from Lagny-sur-Marne Category:Pointillism ","title":"Léo Gausson"},{"id":"60307880","text":"National Highway 227J, commonly referred to as NH 227J is a national highway in India.

It was staged as part of the 2016 AFL finals series to determine which of the two clubs would qualify for that season's Grand Final. In their fifth season in the AFL, and first finals series, the Giants were attempting to reach their first Grand Final, while the Bulldogs were looking to reach their first Grand Final since 1961. ==Background== The 2016 AFL season was contested by eighteen clubs between March and October 2016. The top eight clubs qualified for the finals series, which was conducted under the AFL finals system introduced in 2000 AFL season. At the conclusion of the regular season, the Greater Western Sydney Giants finished fourth on the ladder with sixteen wins and six losses, and caused a major upset in its qualifying final when it defeated cross-town rivals, the Sydney Swans, by 36 points at Stadium Australia, ensuring it received a bye straight into the preliminary final. On the other hand, the Western Bulldogs finished seventh with fifteen wins and seven losses following a regular season in which several key players suffered serious injuries, among them captain Robert Murphy, midfielder Mitch Wallis and forward Jack Redpath, while they were also without forward Stewart Crameri who was serving a season-long suspension for his role in his former club 's controversial sports supplements program during the 2012 AFL season. Despite these setbacks, they would eliminate both of the previous year's Grand Finalists, the West Coast Eagles and , in consecutive sudden death finals to reach their first preliminary final since 2010. The winner of the preliminary final would progress to the Grand Final on 1 October, against the Sydney Swans, who had won the Second Preliminary Final the previous night. Despite this only being their fifth season in the AFL, and missing Steve Johnson through suspension, Greater Western Sydney was an overwhelming favourite to win the preliminary final and progress to the Grand Final. The Bulldogs, on the other hand, had lost nine of their previous ten preliminary finals, the most recent in 2010. In the week leading up to the match, bookmakers were offering odds of $1.45 for a GWS victory and $2.85 for a Western Bulldogs victory. == Match summary == === First half === ==== First quarter ==== After over five minutes of play, Greater Western Sydney registered the first score of the match, a behind to Dylan Shiel, before Clay Smith (Western Bulldogs) kicked the first goal of the match less than a minute later. Two goals to each side saw the Bulldogs lead by two points at the quarter-time break. ==== Second quarter ==== The Bulldogs then kicked four goals to three in the second quarter, during which two players suffered game-ending injuries: Bulldogs ruckman Jordan Roughead, who had a ball kicked in his face, and Giants co-captain Callan Ward, who was accidentally kneed in the head by Zaine Cordy. At half-time, the Bulldogs led by nine points. === Second half === ==== Third quarter ==== Three minutes into the third quarter, Rory Lobb kicked a goal for the Giants to bring the margin back to one point, before a rushed behind brought the scores level at 41-apiece. However, Tory Dickson would kick a goal shortly after to give his side back the lead; another goal to Lobb and one to Jonathan Patton would see the Giants open up an eleven-point lead, before late goals to Marcus Bontempelli and Caleb Daniel saw the Giants' lead reduced to one point at three-quarter-time. ==== Final quarter ==== Two goals to the Giants to start the final quarter saw them take a 14-point lead, the biggest by any side during the match, before goals to Dickson, Bontempelli and Cordy saw the Bulldogs reclaim the lead. Shortly after, Patton would kick a goal for the Giants and with less than five minutes remaining, scores would be tied at 82-apiece. Jack Macrae, who to that point of the season had only kicked one goal, was then paid a mark inside the Bulldogs' forward 50 despite a late spoil from Nick Haynes; he then kicked the match's final goal and despite some desperation from the Giants, the Bulldogs would ultimately hang on to win by six points. ==Aftermath== By winning, the Western Bulldogs progressed to the 2016 AFL Grand Final the following week against the Sydney Swans. It was to be just their third appearance in a Grand Final, but first since 1961. The Bulldogs ultimately went on to win their second flag, defeating the Swans by 22 points with Jason Johannisen winning the Norm Smith Medal as the best player on ground. They thus became the first team since in 1997 to win four consecutive finals, as well as the first ever team to win the premiership after finishing seventh at the conclusion of the home-and-away season. Subsequent meetings between the two sides saw the Giants won by two points in round six, 2017, by 48 points in round 21, 2017 and by 82 points in round one, 2018, before the Bulldogs won by 61 points in round 22, 2019, in what was their first match at the Sydney Showground Stadium since the 2016 preliminary final. The Giants, however, won their next finals meeting, defeating the Bulldogs by 58 points in the 2019 second elimination final to progress to a semi-final against the Brisbane Lions at the Gabba. == Legacy == The match attracted an average television viewership of 2.387 million viewers across the Seven Network and Fox Footy, making it the second-most watched AFL game outside of a grand final ever and the most watched AFL game outside of a grand final since the 2007 preliminary final between and . It was also considered by many fans to be the best AFL match played in the 2010s. == Scorecard == == Teams == == See also == * 1999 AFL First Preliminary Final * 2016 AFL season == Footnotes == :1.

The BBC rescheduled the planned broadcasts of the episodes due to a breaking news bulletin about the UK's Brexit negotiations, which aired 90 minutes before part one was due to air. The first part aired on 19 March 2019, and the second on 20 March 2019 on BBC One in the United Kingdom. Both parts were written by Patrick Homes and Julie Edwards directed the first episode and Nimer Rashed the second. \\"A Simple Lie – Part One\\" focuses on the story of Holly Cartwright (Emma Curtis), a patient being aided by a life support system and that doctors have declared brain dead. Holly's parents Ruth Cooper (Marianne Oldham) and Michael Cartwright (Christopher Harper) do not consent to doctors ending her life. The hospital trust take the matter to court, where it is decided that life support must be withdrawn from Holly's care plan. The ordeal is observed outside the hospital by media and a group of right to life protesters. Consultant paediatrician Ange Godard (Dawn Steele) is Holly's main doctor and she becomes a target of the protester's anger and they attack her. \\"A Simple Lie – Part Two\\" focuses on the continuing fall out of Holly's death and the abduction of Theo Fletcher (Stanley Rabbetts). His father Adrian \\"Fletch\\" Fletcher (Alex Walkinshaw) searches the hospital believing a protester has taken Theo in retaliation for Holly's death. The show's writers played a red herring as the mystery assailant is revealed to be disgruntled former employee Amira Zafar (Poppy Jhakra). The episodes drew praise from television critics because of the emotional nature of Holly's storyline. Steele and Walkinshaw's performances were also praised for their emotional acting. The storyline was also compared by Steele and David Brown from the Radio Times to real-life incidents such as the 2017 Charlie Gard case. Both episodes were featured in various \\"pick of the day\\" features in television coverage magazines. The second episode also featured the introduction of Jack Ryder as surgeon Evan Crowhurst which generated media interest. ==Plot== ===Part one=== The hospital prepares for trouble on the day of a court ruling over the removal of life support from the child patient Holly Cartwright (Emma Curtis). Holly's doctor consultant pediatrician Ange Godard (Dawn Steele) monitors Holly's condition while her parents Ruth Cooper (Marianne Oldham) and Michael Cartwright (Christopher Harper) wait anxiously. Ange reminisces about past conversations she had with Holly, which make her realise that she must be firm in her decisions and diagnosis for Holly. Outside right to life protesters picket the hospital entrance. Chief executive officer Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry) receives news that the judge presiding the case has ordered that life support be removed from Holly. Ange informs Ruth and Michael, who agree to attend a press conference outside the hospital. When Hanssen and Ange publicise the court ruling, Ruth decides to announce her intentions to appeal the ruling. Ange is then attacked by a protester who throws tomato soup over her. Ange later convinces Ruth to consent to Holly's life support being removed and she dies. Hanssen updates the press with the news of Holly's death. Protesters jeer that Ange is the \\"Angel of Death\\" and nursing director Adrian \\"Fletch\\" Fletcher (Alex Walkinshaw) reacts angrily, telling the protesters off on the public platform, making himself a target for their anger. Following a series of death threats Ange is given a police escort to a safe location. Fletch finishes his shift gets ready to leave with his son Theo Fletcher (Stanley Rabbetts). He talks to locum registrar Chloe Godard (Amy Lennox) at the car and Theo goes missing. Consultant general surgeon Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) deals with the admission of his granddaughter, Darla Johnstone (Naomi Katiyo). Ric knows that Darla is pregnant and has to inform his son Kofi Johnstone (Richard Pepple) about the news. Kofi reacts angrily because of his strict Christian values and accuses Ric of meddling. Consultant Serena Campbell (Catherine Russell) expels Kofi from Darla's room for upsetting her. Kofi states that he turned to religion because he felt that Ric neglected him as a child. Ric convinces Kofi to support Darla, but she decides to move in with her grandfather. Returning registrar Frieda Petrenko (Olga Fedori) is met by fellow registrar Zosia Self (Camilla Arfwedson), who wants to become acquainted with her. Darwin's clinical lead Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel) forces the pair to work together, but they do not get along. Frieda is reluctant because she thinks Zosia mistreated her old love interest Oliver Valentine (James Anderson). Zosia explains that she still loves Oliver and talks sense Frieda. While operating on a patient together they discover they have more in common and agree to be friends. ===Part two=== Fletch searches for Theo in the hospital basement and receives a confusing telephone call from him. Fletch receives a message informing him that Theo's abduction is a retaliation over Holly's death. He is warned not contact the police so Fletch tells Hanssen they must conduct a search alone. They check the hospital security cameras but fail to find who has taken Theo. Security guards block all exits to prevent the mystery person taking Theo from the hospital grounds. Trainee doctors Cameron Dunn (Nic Jackman) and Nicky McKendrick (Belinda Owusu) search for the assailant and incorrectly identify an innocent protester. Fletch becomes frantic and steals a surgical scalpel and starts kicking doors down in his search for Theo. Ange returns to the hospital and reviews security footage with Jac and Hanssen, where they identify the abductor as being nurse Amira Zafar (Poppy Jhakra), a disgruntled former employee from the hospital. They locate Amira on the roof and she explains she would not hurt Theo before letting him go. She blames Fletch for her past grievances with the hospital which lead to her dismissal. Amira reveals that following her dismissal she developed alcoholism and lost custody of her daughter. Ange realises she treated Amira previously and explains she has mental health problems. Amira is arrested and admitted into psychiatric care. Nurse Donna Jackson (Jaye Jacobs) encounters Nanette Duval (Suzette Llewellyn) on AAU, she is the mother of registrar Xavier Duval's (Marcus Griffiths), who is also Donna's boyfriend. Nanette complains about a hand ailment which Donna does not take seriously. She and Nanette do not get along well but Donna tries her best to please Xavier. Donna assesses Nanette's hand and decides that she is okay and discharges her. Soon after Nanette returns to the ward in agony claiming her hand is now in severe pain which causes tension between Donna and Xavier. When a man enters the Keller ward and startles Chloe, her colleague Dominic Copeland (David Ames) retrains him. Chloe reveals the man is her ex-boyfriend Evan Crowhurst (Jack Ryder). Evan is a general surgeon from Capel Cross Hospital, who specialises in parasitic infections. Evan asks Chloe to return to Capel Cross and resume their relationship. She reveals that Jac has offered her a permanent role on the cardiothoracic ward Darwin and she may accept. Evan helps diagnose Dominic's patient with a case of parasitic worms from working with livestock. Chloe and Dominic successfully operate on their patient thanks to Evan's help. Chloe then decides to stay at Holby City hospital, but Evan informs her that he will not give up on their relationship. ==Production== \\"A Simple Lie\\" focuses on the culmination of Holly Cartwright's story, a brain-dead patient being kept alive by a life support system. Hospital staff decide that she is brain dead and want to remove her life support. Holly's parents Ruth and Michael fight the hospital board over her care and the matter is taken to court. The story had been developed over previous episodes, beginning in January 2019 when Holly was admitted to Holby City Hospital and Ange enlisted her daughter Chloe to assist on the case. Ange and Chloe encountered problems in the operating theatre which resulted in Holly sustaining brain damage. \\"A Simple Lie – Part One\\" focuses on the day of the court ruling and the trouble caused by right to life protesters that gather outside the hospital to jeer at and threaten staff members. Ruth and Michael still believe that they can take Holly to the US for treatment, despite the court ruling that support must be removed. Steele told a Victoria Wilson from What's on TV that the storyline is similar to the 2017 Charlie Gard case. She explained Holly's parents are fighting for life that is no longer present just like what happened in that case. She also noted that the subsequent press coverage of the case which generated protesters picketing the hospital also occurs in this fictional telling. When Hanssen addresses the media and protesters about the court ruling, tensions escalate and a protester throws cold tomato soup over Ange. Steele explained that her character is a \\"strong woman, so she can cope, but it's still shocking.\\" She added that when Fletch defends her, the crowd jeer at him calling Ange a murderer. Steele had to play Ange as an isolated figure in the incident, but added it was nice to have Fletch's support. The episode culminates in the revelation that protesters have leaked Ange's home address online. She is given a police escort as her safety is severely compromised. \\"A Simple Lie – Part Two\\" continues the story directly from where the first episode ended. Fletch's son Theo goes missing and everyone presumes that he has been abducted by protesters. The mystery assailant threatens Fletch over messages not to involve the police. He searches for Theo armed with a surgical scalpel to attack them once he locates Theo. Ange leaves her safe house to help Fletch search. Steele said that her character feels responsible for bringing the protesters to the hospital and wants to help. The episode was structured to make viewers believe it was a safe assumption to think a protester had taken Theo. Steele concluded that by the end of the episode \\"we soon find out that it's really not Ange's fault.\\" Then came the surprise reveal that former agency nurse Amira has taken Theo. Ange manages to talk Amira down from the hospital roof and Theo is returned to safety. While Amira's involvement in Theo's abduction was a surprise for viewers, her involvement in the episode was known due to Jhakra being listed on an advance spoiler cast list. The second part also features the introduction of a new character, general surgeon Evan Crowhurst played by Jack Ryder. Ryder's casting was announced in November 2018 and reported in the media due to Ryder's high profile because of his previous work. Ryder said that he was delighted to join the cast of Holby City. The show's producer Simon Harper revealed that he had been negotiating with the actor to appear the show for a long time. ==Promotion and broadcast== \\"A Simple Lie\\" was first teased in a trailer publicised on 6 March 2019 which showcased the upcoming spring storylines. It previewed Theo's abduction, Darla's pregnancy dramas and relationship problems between Donna and Xavier. Advance episode stills were also released to promote Ryder's introduction into the series. \\"A Simple Lie – Part One\\" was scheduled to air on BBC One on 12 March 2019 at 8 p.m. The broadcast was cancelled just hours before due to a breaking news bulletin, which was covering the fallout from the UK's Brexit negotiations. The coverage finished fifteen minutes before the episode would have aired. However the BBC decided to put episodes of EastEnders and Would I Lie to You? on air instead. In the following days Kyle O'Sullivan from the Daily Mirror described as the move as controversial, noting that many viewers were angry on social media. Both episodes were rescheduled to air on the 19 and 20 March 2019 respectively, in the 8 p.m. timeslot. ==Reception== \\"A Simple Lie – Part One\\" received praise from viewers because of its emotional content and many said that Holly's story upset them. Rose Hill from the Daily Mirror named Holly's life support story as \\"tragic events\\" and a \\"heartbreaking decision\\". Sasha Morris writing for the Daily Star opined that the dramatic events with the protesters \\"seemed to foreshadow the brutal ending\\". Helen Kelly of the Daily Express branded Holly's story as an \\"emotional case\\", Digital Spy's Sophie Dainty named it \\"the harrowing Holly Cartwright ordeal\\" and Victoria Wilson (What's on TV) called it \\"emotional trauma\\". The Metro's Sue Haasler said that the protesters throwing soup over Ange should have been the end of the story, rather than escalating it further. She opined that Ange and Holly's flashback scenes would likely become more important in future episodes. The episode was featured in What's on TV's \\"Hot TV\\" picks of the week. It was also featured in the TVTimes \\"Tuesday highlights\\" feature and was given a three out of five star rating. David Brown writing for the Radio Times compared the storyline to both the Charlie Gard and Alfie Evans case, as \\"vituperative protesters\\" descend on the hospital. He added that they think they know better than medical professionals when it comes to Holly's welfare. He also praised the episode's structure stating \\"to give the show credit, events do play out in a credible and, at times, moving way. And it's a fine example of soaps being able to take real-life headlines and then dramatise them in a relatively short period of time.\\" He also noted that shows in other timeslots would take longer to be commissioned, while Holby City took on the story while it still felt relevant. Brown also heaped praise on Steele and Oldham's strong performances as Ange and Ruth. Reviewing \\"A Simple Lie – Part Two\\", the Metro's Haasler praised Walkinshaw's performance as \\"desperate Fletch\\", adding that he proved what \\"a marvellous asset he is to the Holby cast.\\" She branded Xavier and Donna's relationship as \\"delightful\\" but believed it \\"took a bit of a hit\\" during the episode, due to Nanette's behaviour. The Daily Star's Morris called the scenes between Donna and Nanette \\"very frosty\\". She added that her behaviour caused viewers on social media to fear that she is plotting to harm Donna. This episode was featured as one of the two main \\"Hot TV\\" picks of the week, chosen by staff from What's on TV. Richard Arnold writing for Woman's Own chose the episode in his \\"must watch TV\\" segment. He stated that Ryder's introduction proved he was still able to \\"get pulses racing\\" as Evan. It was featured in the TVTimes \\"Tuesday highlights\\" feature for Donna and Xavier's relationship dramas. Sam Elliot (Daily Mirror), Michelle Townsend (RSVP Live) and a reporter from Heart all commented on Evan's debut, where they observed Ryder looking \\"unrecognisable\\" from his previous roles. Radio Times Brown said that Evan made \\"quite the entrance\\" into the show. He also praised Walkinshaw's performance as the desperate Fletch. He opined that the actor portrayed the search \\"filled with a sense of palpable dread.\\" ==References== ==External links== * \\"A Simple Lie – Part One\\" on BBC Online * \\"A Simple Lie – Part Two\\" on BBC Online * * Category:2019 British television episodes Category:Holby City episodes ","title":"A Simple Lie"},{"id":"60308298","text":"The 1890 Georgetown football team represented the Georgetown University during the 1890 college football season.

Koduri is a computer engineer and executive for computer graphics hardware. He is currently the chief architect and senior vice president of Intel's discrete graphics division. Before Intel, he worked as the senior vice president and chief architect of the Radeon Technologies Group, the graphics division at Intel's competitor AMD. ==Career== Koduri joined S3 Graphics in 1996. He became the director of advanced technology development at ATI Technologies in 2001. Following Advanced Micro Devices's 2006 acquisition of ATI, he served as chief technology officer for graphics at AMD until 2009. He then went to Apple Inc., where he worked with graphics hardware, which allowed Apple to transition to high-resolution Retina displays for its Mac computers. He returned to AMD in 2013 as a vice president in Visual Computing, which includes both GPU hardware and software, unlike his pre-2009 role at AMD which only concerned GPU hardware. AMD reorganized its graphics division in 2015, promoting Koduri to the executive level by naming him senior vice president and chief architect of the newly formed Radeon Technologies Group. Under this role, Koduri reported directly to AMD CEO Lisa Su. Koduri took a three-month break from his job at AMD in September 2017, with the intention to spend time with his family. He resigned from AMD on November 7. Two days later, he joined Intel, a competitor to AMD, as chief architect and senior vice president of the company's newly formed Core and Visual Computing Group. Matthew S. Smith of Digital Trends argued that this would feel like a stab in heart for fans of AMD, noting that Koduri was \\"loved for his confident yet easy-going demeanor\\" and had become the unofficial face for AMD's underdog image. In June 2018, Koduri announced Intel's plans to compete with AMD and Nvidia in discrete graphics processing units, with a planned launch of its first GPU in 2020. In a March 2019 interview with Barron's, Koduri mentioned Intel's people and resources as his main reason for leaving AMD, described how he successfully headhunted former AMD and Apple engineer Jim Keller for Intel, and said that his visual computing group at Intel has 4,500 people.

The raiders are led by Xanathar's Guild, who have returned to take over Waterdeep. Lacking in manpower from the city Watch, the leading Lord of Waterdeep, Piergeiron the Paladinson summons a group of adventurers to investigate the city sewers, uncover the evil entity and if possible destroy it. ==Gameplay== The games uses a stripped-down version of the 3rd edition D&D; rules\\" with only four basic character classes and several traits, feats and skills. It is not a port of the original game, though it possesses roughly the same plot. It bears stronger resemblance to the original Gold Box games, such as Pool of Radiance. Navigating through the dungeons is done in first-person mode, where the characters can make use of their skills to get through difficulties and have very limited use of spells. When an enemy is encountered, the game mode switches to an isometric topdown view, where the player does turn-based combat against monsters. Killing all enemies ends the combat mode. In some places, the player can recruit up to two additional characters, gather information and buy or sell items. Using items requires the player to equip them in a menu- driven inventory system. ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== The game received moderately negative reviews compared to the original computer game. It was given a 41% rating by NGC Magazine, criticizing it for its slow pace between exploration and combat, its bad interface and confusing menus, while highlighting only its variety of spells and character customization, that give the game some level of depth. According to GameSpy, this game \\"only managed to be a curiosity for older gamers and an annoying Western-style RPG for a new generation of Nintendo fans who had no idea what a Gold Box game was\\". ===Promotion=== The game was showcased at the 2002 Electronic Entertainment Expo and presented at the DunDraCon XXVII the following year, where the company president and game designer Randy Angle was interviewed.http://www.dundracon.com/DDC_Files/DDC27ProgramBook.pdf ==References== ==External links== *Official GBA website * Category:2002 video games Category:First-person party-based dungeon crawler video games Category:Forgotten Realms video games Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:Game Boy Advance-only games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games featuring protagonists of selectable gender ","title":"Eye of the Beholder (2002 video game)"},{"id":"60308492","text":" The Ivchenko AI-8 is an aircraft auxiliary power unit developed and produced by Ivchenko-Progress and Motor Sich. == Variants == ;AI-8: The base model which is used to generate electricity or supply compressed air to air- start systems.

This is known as the Allograft Theory. Her work has focussed on devil facial tumour disease (DFTD), a contagious cancer that affects Tasmanian devils. For this she has won multiple awards, including the 2012 Prince Hitachi Prize for Comparative Oncology. == Education == Pearse graduated from the University of Sydney in 1972 before starting an MSc at the University of Tasmania in 1976. During her Masters she worked on the flea, Uropsylla tasmanica, which is a flea that infects quolls and Tasmanian devils. She was unable to complete her PhD due to symptoms of progressive and severe degenerative spinal disease. == Career == Pearse worked in the Cytogenetics Laboratory at the Royal Hobart Hospital, Tasmania for seventeen years where she worked on human leukemia but also continued studying quolls. During this period she published work on cancer in quolls. She initially retired from scientific work, establishing a flower farm, before returning to science to work on DFTD. She joined the Save the Tasmanian Devil program at the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment, Tasmanian Government, in 2004 after hearing about the disease on the radio. Tumours protrude from the face of a tasmanian devil In 2006, Pearse and her colleague Swift published a paper on their findings on DFTD in Nature. In their report they studied tumours from eleven Tasmanian devils. They observed that the tumours had major chromosomal abnormalities and these abnormalities were the same between individual animals. This led them to conclude that the tumour cells in different animals were of the same clonal origin. As a result, they proposed the hypothesis that \\"the disease is transmitted by allograft, whereby an infectious cell line is passed directly between the animals through bites they inflict on one another.\\". Since then, other scientists have added further evidence to the Allograft Theory of DFTD whilst Pearse has continued to uncover new information on the disease. In particular, she has investigated how the disease mutates in Tasmanian Devil populations. The conclusion of this research is \\"that DFTD should not be treated as a static entity, but rather as an evolving parasite with epigenetic plasticity\\". These findings have implications in humans in terms of donor- derived malignancy in organ transplantation and transmission of a malignancy between a mother and a fetus or between twin fetuses. == Awards and honours == * 2011 Australian Museum Sherman Eureka Prize for Environmental Research (shared) * 2012 Prince Hitachi Prize for Comparative Oncology == References == Category:Living people Category:Australian scientists Category:Cytogenetics Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:University of Sydney alumni Category:University of Tasmania alumni Category:Australian women scientists ","title":"Anne-Maree Pearse"},{"id":"60308766","text":"Portrait of Johan August Meijerfeldt the Younger by Per Krafft the Elder Count Johan August Meijerfeldt (1725-1800) was a Swedish field marshal.

Her parents were Thomas and Ann (Dowbiggin) Bennison. They had moved into Hornby Hall in 1735. An early picture by Arthur Devis records them arriving in their new home. Thomas died soon after it was built and his will left his house and fortune to his daughter Ann. His wife and Ann's mother was the executor. In 1737 her fortune increased when an uncle died and left her a share in the ship True Love. Her mother was Catholic and an educated woman whose father had been a leading lawyer. Her mother looked after the property until her daughter was twenty- one. She married a Protestant named John Fenwick in 1752 and her fortune was assigned temporarily to her husband to increase his collateral. However, in 1757, her husband died whilst hunting and the property was still in his name. Meanwhile, Ann was dying of cancer in her home of Hornby Hall. However, the property was destined for her brother-in-law, Thomas Wilson, who was a Gray's Inn barrister and took his brother's surname of Fenwick. The ownership of Hornby Hall was in dispute and Ann accepted an offer from her brother-in-law in 1759. He offered to let her have the use of the hall for her lifetime, a sum of £3,000 and an annuity of £400 per year. Her brother-in-law's career went well and in 1768 he became a Member of Parliament for Westmorland. However, the £400 per year failed to arrive on time, or at all, and Ann Fenwick went to the courts to enforce the agreement in 1770 since she faced debtor's prison. Her case was undermined because Thomas Fenwich used his status as an MP and she was a Catholic – the law discriminated against litigants who were not Protestants. Despite this, Ann won her case and was awarded £18,000. Her brother-in-law objected to the decision and Ann had to appeal to the House of Lords in 1772. Her brother-in-law lost the case and the support that had enabled him to be an MP. He was not reelected. ==Religion== Fenwick's mother was Catholic, and it was a major part or her life that she greatly enjoyed. In 1762 when her mother died, she lost her good health and she brought a Douai trained priest named Thomas Butler to Hornby where he celebrated Mass. Butler celebrated Mass in Claughton. Despite marrying a Protestant, she reached out to Catholics such as Richard Challoner who gave her books. ==Death== Fenwick died in Hornby Hall on 28 April 1777, leaving detailed wills. She was buried with her parents in St Wilfrid's Church, Melling. Historian John Lingard began an association with Hornby in 1811. ==References== Category:18th-century English women Category:1724 births Category:1777 deaths Category:English Roman Catholics Category:People from Lancaster, Lancashire ","title":"Ann Fenwick"},{"id":"60308803","text":"Ghodaghodi Municipality is a Municipality in Kailali District of Sudurpashchim Pradesh.

She finished her elementary studies in her hometown and then completed her secondary education in Nazareth. Her first novel, \\"Journey on a Train of the Past,\\" was published in 1973, in a volume with several short stories. Her play \\"Carry Your Secret\\" won the House of Karma Theater Award in 1978. She also won the Literary Achievement Award, and several honorable mentions and other recognition of her work. Dhiab wrote many newspaper and magazine articles, and had regular columns in Al-Sanara and Al-Arab, which like her literature, addressed women's issues in Arab society She worked as an editor for Lilac magazine. In the early 1970s, Dhiab was one of very few Arab women writing and being published within Israel. She wrote short stories, novels, children's books, plays, and poetry. Unlike her contemporaries on the other side of the Green Line, Dhiab avoided writing about political-national issues. Some researchers posit that this was due to fear of retaliations by the authorities. In her poetry, however, she did take inspiration from Palestinian nationalist poet Mahmoud Darwish, and stressed the importance of time, place, and context - which is nevertheless political. In her writing about women in Arab society, she also wrote about rape, which was considered a taboo subject, and she was targeted by family and strangers alike because of this. It took her almost a decade to return to her writing. Dorit Gottesfeld, a researcher of Palestinian women's literature, places Dhiab in the \\"middle generation\\" of local writers - the first generation laid the groundwork for Palestinian feminist discourse in their romantic-humanistic style, the middle generation adopted realism, and sought balance between the social and the national-political, while the current generation uses modernism and post modernism to challenge conventions - both literary and social. Her works have been included in several collections, and at least one poem set to music, and featured in a festival of Arabic poetry in 2009. Some of her works have been translated into other languages, including Hebrew and English. == Works == * The Repentant Ostrich, Collection of Children's Stories, 1972. * Journey on the Last Train, novel, 1973. * Ali Sayyad, A Children's Story, 1982. * Heart Wound, Thoughts, 1983. * Mad Fantasy, novella, 1983. * \\"Carry Your Secret\\" and \\"No Wandering\\", Two Plays, 1987. * Women's Case, novel, 1987. * Ice Days, Collection of Stories and Thoughts, 1995. * The Cord and the Crow, novel, 1997. * Wall of Memories, Literary Texts, 2000. * City of the Wind, novel. == References == Category:Living people Category:1951 births Category:Israeli women writers Category:Israeli short story writers Category:Israeli women poets Category:Israeli poets ","title":"Fatima Dhiab"},{"id":"60308944","text":"Mizancı Murat Bey (1854–1917) was an Ottoman monarchist, democrat, historian and statesman, who was renowned for his work on reviving the concept of Ottomanism during the Second Constitutional Era.https://www.beyaztarih.com/ansiklopedi/mizanci-murat Early portrait == References == Category:1854 births Category:1917 deaths Category:People from Dagestan ","title":"Mizancı Murat"},{"id":"60308956","text":"Entre-Vignes is a commune in the Hérault department in the Occitanie region in southern France.

Limerick and his third wife, Jane Baylee of Lough Gur, Co. Limerick. He was educated in Trinity, Dublin 1768. He was twice married, first to Aphra Crone (d Sept. 1814), daughter of John Crone of Doneraile, Co. Cork with whom he had seven sons and five daughters. In 1818 he married Anna Maria Finucane of Ennis, niece and heir of Fr. James Finucane, Catholic priest and substantial landowner, of Kilfarboy, co. Clare. ==Public Life== Odel held several offices apart from being a Member of Parliament, he was High Sheriff of County Limerick between 1789–90. In 1793 Odel was made Lieutenant Colonel of the newly formed County Limerick Militia. He sat in the Irish House of Commons for County Limerick. In 1817 with John Maxwell-Barry he became the first Irish Commissioners of the Treasury after that office was merged with Lord High Treasurer of Ireland. While a member of the Irish House of Commons Odel was a supporter of the Act of Union and boasted at the time that he was the only member that did so without seeking reward. As a member of the House of Commons he first came to notice when in 1803 along with Charles Silver Oliver the other County Limerick MP he voted with the Opposition for an inquiry into the finances of the Prince of Wales's finances. He was down as a supporter of the second Pitt administration but this was conditional on obtaining a position in the army for his son. This intrigue continued after Grenville became Prime Minister after Pitt's death in 1806. Grenville was less accommodating than Pitt so Odell transferred his support to Portland and Portland rewarded him with an office for his son. During this period Odell increased his commitment to the Militia and was away from Parliament. Indeed, throughout his Parliamentary career there is no record of him speaking though he did vote on occasion. he did make time, however, in 1808 and 1813 to be present to support Catholic Relief. The government was and needed support of Irish MPs, Odell was one of those that supported the Walcheren Campaign likewise he supported the government by opposing various attempts at reform. He was returned in 1812 unopposed. Between 1811-14 he was a member of the board of the Lord high Treasurer of Ireland after that office was abolished in 1816 he served on the board of Lords Commissioners of the Treasury until he lost his seat in 1819. In that period he continued to support Catholic Relief and at one stage quoted as saying he \\"... should always vote for everything favourable to the Roman Catholics...\\" For the remainder of the decade Odell was an infrequent attender at Parliament though he did make the effort to attend whenever the matter of Catholic Relief came up. He also continued to canvas for his son to receive an office. No office for his son was forthcoming neither was any other office for Odell and in the 1818 election he was forced to step aside because of lack of government support. Throughout his political career Odell was supported by the Lords Clare who acted as his patron as he had little means of his own. He was succeeded in his seat by Richard Hobart FitzGibbon, the second son (and later third Earl) of 1st Earl of Clare. ==Later life== In 1818 the year he lost his seat Odell married Anna Maria Finucane, a Catholic, and this did not endear him to the Establishment. Having failed to secure for himself or his sons any office and income attached to the office his financial difficulties increased. He was unable to pay his debts and as a result he was confined to Marshalsea debtors' prison where he remained for 12 years until his death in 1831. ==References== Category:1752 births Category:1831 deaths Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for County Limerick constituencies (1801–1922) Category:UK MPs 1801–1802 Category:UK MPs 1802–1806 Category:UK MPs 1806–1807 Category:UK MPs 1807–1812 Category:UK MPs 1812–1818 ","title":"William Odell (MP)"},{"id":"60309006","text":"Luitré-Dompierre is a commune in the Ille-et-Vilaine department in Brittany in northwestern France.

He was appointed Apostolic Administrator of Santiago by Pope Francis on 23 March 2019, then Archbishop there on 27 December (installed 11 January 2020). ==Biography== Aós Braco was born in Artaiz (Unciti) in the province of Navarra, Spain, on 6 April 1945. He studied philosophy in Zaragoza and theology in Pamplona. He took his initial vows as a Capuchin on 15 August 1964 at Sangüesa and his final vows on 16 September 1967 in Pamplona. He received his priestly ordination on 30 March 1968. He then fulfilled assignments in Spain as professor in Lecaroz–Navarra and vicar in Tudela. He earned his licentiate in psychology at the University of Barcelona in 1980. In 1980-1981, he held a fellowship that allowed him to conduct psychological research at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. Returning to Spain he was professor in Pamplona and vicar in Zaragoza. He was transferred to Chile in 1983 where he was appointed parochial vicar in Longaví, diocese of Linares. Two years later, he was elected superior of the Capuchin community in Los Ángeles and subsequently he was transferred to Recreo (Viña del Mar), becoming the episcopal vicar for the consecrated life of the Diocese of Valparaíso. Other responsibilities included economic provincial of the Capuchins in Chile, Promotor of Justice of the ecclesiastical tribunal of Valparaíso, judge of the ecclesiastical tribunal of Concepción, and treasurer of the Chilean association of canon law. In 2007, while promoter of justice in Valparaiso, he heard but judged \\"implausible\\" a complaint of sexual abuse made by a former seminarian against a former rector of the seminary, and the seminarian did not file a formal complaint to press the issue. Pope Francis named him Bishop of Copiapó on 25 July 2014, and he received his episcopal ordination on 18 October from the apostolic nuncio to Chile, Ivo Scapolo. On 23 March 2019, Francis gave him the additional position of Apostolic Administrator of Santiago, and Aós took up his responsibilities at a Mass there the next day. On 18 April 2019, Aós Braco refused communion to at least two people who knelt to receive it, though norms allow communicants to stand or kneel. A week later he distributed Communion to people kneeling. In mid-May he told an interviewer: On 27 December 2019, Pope Francis named him Archbishop of Santiago.

Jonathan Dowling Shaw (born July 4, 1953) is an American tattoo artist and writer. He founded New York City's oldest tattoo shop, Fun City Tattoo, in 1976, before tattooing was legal in the city. == Early life == Shaw was born in 1953. His father was big band musician and bandleader Artie Shaw, and his mother was the musicians' seventh wife, actress Doris Dowling. He was raised in Los Angeles, and from his own description had a very rough upbringing. His parents' marriage dissolved when he was three years old, and he developed a heroin addiction in his teenage years, occupying his time with varied acts of juvenile delinquency. At age 19, while working at the Los Angeles Free Press, he met the author Charles Bukowski who inspired him to hitchhike from Los Angeles to Rio de Janeiro in 1972. He arrived in South America, finding work as a deckhand and tattoo artist. ==Career== === Fun City Tattoo === Returning to the United States in 1976, Shaw relocated to the Bowery neighborhood in Manhattans' Lower East Side where he opened Fun City Tattoo, the oldest tattoo shop in New York City, where he specialized in neo-tribal tattoos and tattooed celebrities as Johnny Depp, Iggy Pop, Jim Jarmusch, Max Cavalera (Sepultura) and Kate Moss. Tattooing, however, had been illegal in New York City in 1961, and wasn't legalized until 1997. Shaw later founded the first magazine exclusively dedicated to tattoos, International Tattoo Art in the 1980s. In 1990, Jonathan Shaw, Johnny Depp, Iggy Pop and Jim Jarmusch founded the Death Is Certain Club to celebrate their friendship. The club involved each member getting a matching ring and tattoo. === Retirement and writing career === Shaw sold Fun City in 2002, after only five years of legal operation, to focus on writing. After 28 years tattooing, Jonathan retired from the profession in 2004 and moved back to Rio de Janeiro, where he wrote his first novel Narcisa: Our Lady of Ashes, published in 2008 by HarperCollins. Iggy Pop described Shaw as \\"the great nightmare anti-hero of the new age\\".

He was closely involved with the Association of Evangelical Churches (\\"Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen\\" / BEK) and worked on many of the cases in which the BEK's leading figures were involved. He also became well networked, on more than one level, with the country's political establishment. East Germany was a one-party dictatorship. During the 1970s and 1980s, the churches increasingly provided an outlet for alternative political views which, under a more decentralised system, would have been expressed through an effective multi-party parliamentary structure. Schnur was a founding member of the oppositional \\"Demokratischer Aufbruch\\" (loosely \\"Democratic Awakening\\" / DA) in October 1989. He was one of the \\"new party\\" leadership team's most attractive and dynamic members: over the next few months there was talk of Wolfgang Schnur becoming prime minister in a new genuinely democratic German Democratic Republic. In February 1990 he appointed Angela Merkel as a press spokeswoman, the start of a remarkable political career. Wolfgang Schnur's political career had peaked, however. On 8 March 1990 he rejected allegations that he had been a Stasi informer. On 14 March 1990, less than a week before East Germany's first (and only) free parliamentary election, it was reported that Schnur had resigned from the presidency of Democratic Awakening. He was expelled from the party the next day. ==Life== ===Provenance and early years=== Wolfgang Schnur was born in Stettin which at that time was in Germany. Stettin was a strategic port and as Schnur was born the city center and many of the surrounding residential and commercial districts were bombed by British bombers. Infection was rampant and very soon after his birth Wolfgang fell ill with Laryngeal Diphtheria. Wolfgang Schnur never knew his father: such vague and contradictory \\"facts\\" as have emerged about his paternity have been difficult to confirm and are likely to be, at least in part, incorrect. Wolfgang's mother, Erna Hermine Schnur had been born in Danzig on 24 July 1915. Schnur was her birth-name, so she was probably unmarried. At the time of Wolfgang's birth she was working as a domestic servant for a couple called \\"Piper\\". When, in the context of the ethnic cleansing of 1944/45, the Pipers moved to Lübeck, Erna Schnur went with them, leaving Wolfgang behind. She had already, in December 1941, given birth to Wolfgang's sister, Brigitte who had been taken from her mother within a few days and transferred to an orphanage. In the context of the chaos of the final part of the Second World War, records that may have been created concerning Wolfgang's paternity and first weeks of life do not survive, but it is known that once he had recovered from his Diphtheria he was moved directly from the hospital wing to the \\"Bergquell Children's Home\\" in Stettin, since \\"his mother did not want him\\". By the time the Soviet army captured Stettin on 27 April 1945, inmates and patients from the children's home and the nearby children's hospital had been evacuated to the Island of Rügen a short distance to the west, where an abandoned barracks building was reassigned to accommodate them. The \\"Children's Barracks\\", as it became known, also accommodated the smaller infants. Meanwhile, following a redrawing of frontiers, Stettin had become part of Poland, ostensibly to compensate for the Polish lands now incorporated into the Soviet Union. Evacuation to the island meant that Schnur would grow up, classified as a \\"parentless child\\" (\\"elternloses Kind\\") in the part of Germany administered as the Soviet occupation zone. In April 1946 he was placed with foster parents at Natzevitz, a small village on the southern part of Rügen. Martha and Rudolf Mummethei were so-called \\"new peasants\\", who had been allocated a parcel of land following the break-up by the military authorities of the great landed estates (and before the more long-lasting East German land reforms). Rudolf Mummethei had become a \\"milker\\" and Martha Mummethei, who before the war had worked as a domestic servant for one of the landowning families in the region, now ran the home and helped her husband with his agricultural work. Wolfgang spent his early childhood believing that Martha and Rudolf Mummethei were his parents. When he was five or six they carefully explained to him that they were not his \\"real parents\\", and that his real parents were \\"probably dead\\". Later Schnur would describe his shock at the revelation and also his anger that his foster parents had only told him the truth after the Children's Office of the local Welfare Department had intervened on several occasions, instructing them to do so. For the next ten years, he grew up believing himself a \\"full orphan\\", unaware that his mother was still alive. Despite his conflicted emotions, on learning that the Mummetheis were not his \\"real parents\\", Schnur had a mostly good relationship with his foster parents, who treated him \\"as their own\\". Files nevertheless refer to his having run away at least once, and having been removed from his foster parents home on several occasions, which Schnur later attributed to his foster mother's nervous illness on account of a bad nose fracture and resulting \\"substantial social difficulties\\". In many respects, Schnur's situation was not so different from that of many of his contemporaries. War had created many orphans. In 1951 he was sent to the junior school at a village in the area called Seedorf. Interviewed sixty years later his former teacher, Horst Bürger, still recalled his deep interest in politics. He was a \\"good student\\" and engaged fully in the activities and trips of the Ernst Thälmann Pioneer Organisation and also stood out because of his contributions in school plays. He excelled in lessons and his teacher recommended, unusually in rural East Germany at this time, that he should be entered for the Abitur, which would have opened the way to university-level education. On 1 September 1959 he transferred to the senior school at Bergen auf Rügen in order to prepare for the exam. ===Mother=== At Christmas 1960 the sixteen-year-old Wolfgang Schnur discovered that he was not an orphan. His mother was alive and had been found living in the west. The news came from Dr.Alfred Weckram, his former pediatrician at the little hospital in Bergen. The doctor also told him that as far back as 1946 his mother had posted a small \\"search advertisement\\" [in a newspaper]. The doctor showed him the \\"small ad\\". The doctor seems to have been operating on behalf of the East German tracing service. Schnur immediately became convinced that in the chaos of the final months of the war he and his mother had become separated against his mother's will. This is what he would write in an extensive autobiographical résumé that he provided to the Ministry for State Security much later, in March 1983. There could be no other explanation for the \\"search advertisement\\" from 1946. It was only much later that he learned from Erna Schnur's stepmother something of the difficulties that his mother had experienced during the National Socialist years. Erna Schnur was half Jewish and had herself spent the war years in Stettin, hidden by a succession of families in order to avoid being caught up in the Shoah. It was only with the arrival of the Red Army in April 1945 that she had been able to come out of hiding. (An explanation for her not having retrieved her child from the orphanage before leaving for Lübeck never emerged, however.) By 1960 Erna Schnur had been living for fourteen years in Bad Homburg, near Frankfurt am Main. She was employed by the Waldkrankenhaus, a psychiatric hospital in the Köppern quarter of Friedrichsdorf, a couple of kilometers outside Homburg. Although she never married, she had told the tracing services in West Germany that the existence of her children should not be disclosed to her employers. In August 1961 (eight days before the sudden and unexpected erection of the Berlin Wall heralded a rapid intensification of east-west travel restrictions) Wolfgang Schnur booked himself time off work and set off excitedly for a joyful reunion with his mother, traveling via Berlin and passing through the Friedrichstraße passport control point without encountering any delays. Since Christmas mother and son had written to each other several times, but Wolfgang had not mentioned his plans for a visit. That would be a surprise. Since Christmas he had left school and embarked on an apprenticeship at the Stralsund shipyard. His school in Bergen had arranged the apprenticeship for him only after becoming convinced of his determination not to complete his academic course. After crossing into West Berlin he stopped off at a Youth Camp where he was required to undergo a medical examination. A shadow in his lungs was identified. On 13 August 1961 the wall went up. On 23 August 1961 he was nevertheless able to leave the city, taking a flight from West Berlin to Giessen where he was accommodated at another Youth reception Camp, not far from his mother's home at Bad Homburg. When Wolfgang turned up, unannounced, at her front door, Erna Schur's reaction was not the one that her son had anticipated. There was no welcoming hug. She did not even invite him into her home. She was simply overwhelmed by the situation. She did, in fact, almost at once arrange for him to transfer from the Youth reception Camp in Giessen to an Internationaler Bund establishment in Homburg which specialised in preparing young refugees from East Germany for life in the west. Wolfgang was nevertheless desperately hurt that he had crossed the country in search of his long lost mother only to find himself an inmate of yet another institution. His relationship with his mother would never become close. Commentators have seen some of his more remarkable actions and character traits as evidence of a deeply seated search for an \\"alternative mother\\". For the next few years, he stayed in the area. Between August 1961 and October 1962 he was able to support himself as a youth worker. The tasks were not so different from some of the activities in which he had been involved with the Young Pioneers. In October 1963 he was able to collect a western Middle School completion certificate. He was not unduly troubled by the political differences that had by now developed between east and west. There were people in charge who set the rules, and you did what you did within those rules. He was appointed, in May 1962, to the vice-presidency of a Youth Social Work forum in Hesse. In the longer term, he decided to build a career as a journalist, and he applied successfully for a traineeship with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which started in September 1962. The paper was keen to send him to East Berlin to gather material on politics, economics and sport. However, Schur was nervous about the idea, fearing (with good cause) that after his extended stay in the west he might find himself convicted of Escaping from the Republic (\\"Republikflucht\\"), a crime which under Paragraph 213 of the East German criminal code would normally lead to a prison sentence. ===\\"Asylum\\" back home in the German Democratic Republic=== At some stage Wolfgang Schur nevertheless decided to return to East Germany. He himself later explained that \\"there were two things that drew ... [him] ... back.\\" One was that he badly missed his stepmother, whom he had neglected to tell about his plans when he had headed across to Bad Homburg, and the other was that in Oberursel he met up with a school teacher whom he identified, in the context of the times, as a Nazi. That may have been less than a total explanation, but it does appear that he could see no long term future for himself in the west. On 21 October 1962 he crossed into the German Democratic Republic at the Wartha border crossing near Eisenach. As he had anticipated, the East German officials were unsure of how to deal with him. He was not a typical disillusioned westerner seeking a new life in the workers' and peasants' paradise. The question arose, as he had anticipated, of whether he might be charged with \\"Republikflucht\\". He was held at a detention centre in Eisenach while decisions were made about his future. There were questionnaires to be filled out. Then, after two days, he was permitted back into the country without further ado, and by the end of October 1962 he was back with his foster parents in Natzevitz. His foster mother welcomed him home with the immediate hug that his birth mother had not been able to provide. It was only later that various more intractable difficulties with the authorities, arising from his year in the west, became apparent. In many ways, he had to start again. After intense investigations by the Ministry for State Security he was accepted under a conditional contract as a track construction assistant, working for the rail depot at Bergen. At the political and bureaucratic levels there was a powerful mutual suspicion between East and West Germany, and the authorities evidently thought that Schur might have been smuggled back into East Germany in order to spy for western intelligence. He himself was under intense surveillance from comrades looking for any signs that he might be a spy. After six months a back injury made it necessary for him to give up the labouring job on the railways, and in May 1963 he was assigned to an office job with the East German Trade Organisation, with which he remained till October 1966. Here the situation seemed more relaxed, and an older female comrade with a motherly touch took him in hand and showed him how to become a \\"good comrade\\". He soon worked out how to join the political mainstream and on 16 March 1965 his application to become a candidate for party membership was accepted and his name was added to the candidates list. He took on (unpaid) party work and became a local leader with the Free German Youth. ===Free German Youth=== Schnur's obvious intellectual ability and meticulous approach, combined with his determination to become a \\"good comrade\\" brought him to the attention of the authorities. His complicated childhood and relationship with his mother, along with questionable aspects of his year in the west, also opened up vulnerabilities which might turn out to be useful. He was headhunted to study Marxism-Leninism at the \\"Free German Youth Wilhelm Pieck Academy\\" (\\"Jugendhochschule Wilhelm Pieck\\" – housed in a lakeside villa which had been, in another time, the holiday home of Joseph Goebbels). The course commenced at the beginning of September 1965. By the end of October 1965 Schnur had withdrawn from it, ostensibly on health grounds. Ministry of State Security files disclose a more complicated reason. New information had come to the attention of FDJ officers concerning Schnur's time in the west when he had engaged in youth work in Oberursel. The Oberursel facility in which he had been based was believed – probably correctly – to be heavily infiltrated by US-Intelligence, and further enquiries failed to extinguish intensified security service suspicions about Schnur. The Ministry of State Security themselves had already investigated his background thoroughly and had already filled files with large amounts of information about his time in the west, but those details could not be disclosed in elaborate detail to the Free German Youth (FDJ) decision-takers who now simply asserted that no future FDJ official should have links to the west. And his mother actually lived in the west! Schnur was expelled from the FDJ which he himself always claimed to regard as a career catastrophe for his subsequent career prospects. The Ministry of State Security tended to take a more strategic view, however, and seem to have regarded the entire incident as no more than a setback. Their fundamental faith in Wolfgang Schnur's long term potential – of which Schnur himself still knew nothing – was not affected. In the aftermath of the FDJ affair, Schnur's candidacy for party membership was set aside on 28 February 1966, which he himself regarded as a major punishment (ein \\"hohes Strafmaß\\"). Meanwhile, it turns out that he had already been providing information to Ministry of State Security (\\"Stasi\\") officers, possibly without even knowing that they were Stasi officers, in connection with \\"Operation Bussard\\". No surviving files describing Operation Bussard have been located and Schnur himself, when asked about it decades later, said he could not remember what it was all about. There is no equivalent uncertainty, however, concerning his signature, dated 4 June 1965, on the declaration agreeing to become a Stasi informer. The document includes his code name, \\"GI Torsten\\". By now he was 21. Exceptionally ambitious personally and financially, he recognised that he still had much \\"catching up\\" to do if he ever wanted to be a \\"good comrade\\", following his year in the west. He chose the name Torsten because a friend at work had a son called Torsten. ===Stasi=== The meeting at which he had signed up had taken place in a \\"secret apartment\\" (\\"konspirative Wohnung\\") near his home somewhere on Rügen, and this apartment, made available by the elderly lady who lived in it and who was herself an IM, now became his Stasi contact location. His first operation - probably a test mission - announced itself in the form of a letter from a young woman in Hamburg who wanted to visit him on the island. He had originally met Marlies Bähr at a large FDJ east-west social event in East Berlin the previous year. Schnur wrote back just four days later, recommending a holiday apartment which the municipality rented out to holiday makers. When he reported back to his Stasi handler it was agreed that the authorities would arrange the Miss Bähr's holiday themselves, and a room was booked for her at a little guest-house in Binz. Marlies Bähr arrived and a \\"holiday romance\\" ensued although, as his handling officer's surviving report approvingly attests, his genuine infatuation did nothing to compromise the excellent quality of Schnur's \\"espionage\\" work with respect to the young women. Over several days, as they danced, walked, flirted and just sat and talked, he subjected her to a sustained and intensive interrogation which, it appears, she barely noticed, in order to evaluate her true feelings and motives in respect of political matters and her personal life. Officers who read his detailed reports of the social interaction between himself and Marlies compared him to an \\"uninterrupted continually running tape recorder\\". That quality is apparent from the level of detail in a succession of Stasi files covering Schnur's activity over the next 24 years. Marlies was a student at the (US-funded) Free University of Berlin. His Stasi handlers became satisfied that she was not an American spy, and they shared Schnur's conviction that she must have picked up a large amount of knowledge about East German students who had emigrated – after 1961 \\"escaped\\" – to the west. The opportunities were all too obvious. Marlies was just the person to convince \\"Torsten\\" about the superior freedoms available in the west, and to help him plan and organise an \\"escape to the west\\" on his own account. Marlies Bähr was of limited interest to the Stasi as a potential intelligence source, but as a possible route into the closed circle of FU students around Detlef Girrmann (and others) helping often desperate East German citizens escape to the west, she could be invaluable. At the end of her holiday, Marlies Bähr was more unsure than ever of what to make of \\"Torsten\\". As he reported to his handlers, she had made clear that she had no wish to engage with him in any more discussions about politics. Possibly he had \\"gone too far\\". But she was happy to tell him what she knew about escaping from East Germany to the west. She knew it was very dangerous. To do it he must be 150% sure that it was what he wanted. She had heard of East German escaping via Turkish ships in the Mediterranean after managing to get themselves included on government-sponsored Mediterranean youth-holidays on an East German ship. But she very strongly counselled him to do everything he could to find a legal route for any escape to the west before involving himself with the illegal methods. \\"Torsten\\" was not successful in getting her to disclose whatever she knew about the \\"Fluchthelfer\\" (escape helpers) among her university contemporaries. He reported that she knew \\"nothing concrete\\" about that side of things. But Schnur's handlers were more interested in using Marlies to enable \\"Torsten\\" himself to become involved with the \\"traffickers\\". She introduced him to \\"Hendrik\\", a student at the Technical University of Berlin to whom \\"Torsten\\" confided that he still feared arrest, following the unpleasantnesses at the \\"Free German Youth Wilhelm Pieck Academy\\". Hendrik did not want to know the details, but he was indignant on Torsten's behalf and understood the point at once. He knew a man.... Somehow \\"Torsten\\" very soon broke off contact with both Marlies and Hendrik, but the exceptionally comprehensive and detailed nature of the reports of his various meetings that Schnur submitted to his handlers continued to impress. His progress may well still have been held up through suspicions generated on account of his connections with the west, but he was nevertheless given a succession of further assignments to investigate and report back. On his home base at Rügen he was employed as an \\"omni-directional radar\\" to identify and investigate possibly negative or hostile elements among the young people on the holiday island. ===The church community and a first marriage=== A possibly more important assignment came up in April 1966 when \\"Torsten\\" was sent to join the youth club attached to the protestant church at Binzen. The Stasi knew that the church's youth community included conscript soldiers and so- called \\"Bausoldaten\\" (non-combatant conscientious objector soldiers) from the NVA barracks at Prora. The \\"Bausoldaten\\" were viewed with particular suspicion. \\"Torsten\\" reported back with characteristic detail and precision on conversations at the weekly \\"tea and sandwiches\\" functions held by the pastor – even in weeks when the pastor himself was unable to attend – enabling handlers to identify potential trouble makers and, indeed, potential informants among the coming generation. It was through the church youth community that \\"Torsten\\" met Bärbel, who on 1 July 1966 became the first of his several wives. Bärbel came to the marriage with a son from a previous relationship. She herself was part of a large and \\"interesting\\" extended family. The couple's three children together – believed to be the first three of Wolfgang Schnur's eleven children – had been born by 1974. Schnur was a restless and frequently absent father: childcare responsibilities fell almost exclusively to Bärbel. It was also Bärbel who \\"led him to faith\\": Wolfgang Schnur became a Christian. ===Back to school=== In June 1967 Schnur returned to his studies for the Abitur (secondary school final exam) in order, belatedly, to work towards a university degree. By now he had abandoned the idea of obtaining a degree in Journalism, favouring instead \\"Wirtschaftsrecht\\" (loosely, \\"Economic Law\\") he undertook his Abitur course locally, through the \\"Kreisvolkshochschule\\" (large secondary school) in Putbus. As before, his unconventional past created suspicions on the part of local party officials which resulted in difficulties in securing a study place, but behind the scenes contacts via the Ministry of State Security in the end enabled those difficulties to be overcome. Then, in the Autumn term of 1967, he commenced his student career, studying law at (East) Berlin University. According to the relevant ministry files he had \\"organised his student place himself\\". His plan was to focus on his studies in order to become a full-time informer. A few weeks after becoming a student he informed his Stasi handlers that once he had his degree his future would undoubtedly involve a posting in the west, a plan which the responsible officer felt was at best \\"opaque\\". He was also beginning to lose a little of the trust he had formerly enjoyed from his handlers, after it was discovered from routine postal intercepts that \\"Torsten\\" still (or again) had on-going contacts with Marlies Bähr in Hamburg, but had neglected to mention the fact in his reports. One of her postcards to him was also copied for the Stasi files on him. Despite an apparent cooling in the relationship with his Stasi handlers, \\"Torsten\\" was offered and accepted a mission to report \\"everything\\" about the youth community in Binzen. He was nevertheless encountering difficulties on obtaining law-related work because he had not been able to join the party and because the record of his expulsion from the FDJ remained on the files. He asked the ministry contacts for help, but it is not clear how much effort they were able or willing to exert on his behalf at this point. Nevertheless, with a family to support, he had no choice but to try and find a job at which he could work in parallel with his university law studies. Eventually, he accepted a job as a justiciar (legal officer) with a newly created abattoir (\\"VEB-Fleischkombinate\\") in Stralsund. He was appalled by the absence of effective political-ideological education taking place at the business, which is fully reflected in his reports to his handlers of the time. He seems to have become depressed and disillusioned at this time, and in around 1968, which was the year of the crushing of the Prague Spring, he ended his habit of regularly completing and submitting application forms for party membership. Much of his energy was necessarily devoted to his studies, but he was also spending more time involving himself with the protestant church community at Binzen, and providing his handlers with the relevant reports. ===The lawyer=== Despite the distractions and difficulties, in 1973 Wolfgang Schnur finally received his law degree after what had become, by this stage, a \\"distance-learning\\" based degree course. He now supported himself as a lawyer, based in Binzen. In 1978 he opened his own legal practice in Rostock, along the coast on the mainland, to the west. This suggests that he was at the time well regarded by his handlers, since permission for a lawyer to set up in what amounted to a form of private practice was a \\"rare privilege\\" in the German Democratic Republic. It was partly as a result of his engagement with the protestant church community at Binzen since the 1960s that Schnur had established and sustained contacts with many former so-called \\"Bausoldaten\\", people conscripted for military service who served in non-combatant units for reasons of conscience. Some of these later went on to become high-profile artistic figures whose commitment to environmental protection and human rights brought them into serious conflict with the government. As a civil rights lawyer Wolfgang Schnur's clients included the song-writers Stephan Krawczyk and Freya Klier, along with civil rights activists such as Bärbel Bohley und Vera Wollenberger and many other less well remembered \\"dissidents\\" and objectors to the government's military service requirements. He also became one of East Germany's best-known church representatives, both as a lawyer and in the public sphere more generally. He was a member of the synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church for Mecklenburg, and served for at least one term as vice-president of the national Evangelical Church synod. Alongside his intellectual horsepower, endless energy and sheer ambition, there were those who thought they noticed something else a little odd about the church's increasingly high-profile lawyer. Bishop Horst Gienke of Greifswald described him as a \\"man with a devilish look\\" (\\"... als einen Mann mit diabolischem Blick\\"). His self-evident travel privileges, granted by the authorities, and his habit of driving a western car, were hard to miss. No one seems to have asked why a lawyer specialising in political dissidents could finance such a lifestyle. East Germans had learned not to ask questions. ===The networker=== Schnur always had a close working relationship with Horst Kasner, who had worked in Templin (near Berlin) for many years as head of the Evangelical Church's pastoral college for Berlin-Brandenburg. Kasner was a shrewd if cautious man who took his own decisions and who was seen as an important intermediary between the church nationally and the state. He was a member of the influential Weißensee Working Circle of senior churchmen and was viewed by the state authorities as one of the more progressive (i.e. pro-party church leaders. The working relationship between Schnur and Kasner extended to friendship between their families, and it placed Schnur for many years close to the critical fulcrum of East Germany's church-state relations. A regular interlocutor for Schnur and Kasner in the context of the church's on-going conversations with the party was the lawyer-churchman Clemens de Maizière (1906–1980), whose son Lothar later became East German prime minister. Clemens de Maizière was both a member of the Berlin-Brandenburg synod and a leading member of the East German CDU (party). On the government side the principal interlocutor for all three men was the State Secretary for Church Affairs. Between 1979 and 1988 that office was held by Klaus Gysi. ===The political pioneer=== On 1 October 1989 Wolfgang Schnur was a co-founder of \\"Demokratischer Aufbruch\\" (loosely \\"Democratic Awakening\\" / DA), an organisation with many of the characteristics of a western-style political party. As the professional lawyer among the group it had fallen to Schnur to draft the party constitution, taking every possible care to try and ensure that DA could not legitimately be declared illegal. At the founding conference, held in East Berlin, he was elected \\"party president\\" – effectively the leader of the operation. The movement had grown out of various increasingly politicised elements from within the evangelical churches, and there are indications that one reason for Schnur's election was that he was \\"not a theologian\\", unlike Rainer Eppelmann who was also keen to take on the position, and indeed did so in succession to Schnur half a year later. In December 1989, as the political changes gathered pace, Schnur was also an early participant at the National Round Table meetings (\\"Zentraler Runder Tisch\\"). Ominously, however, he withdrew from these meetings on 27 December 1989 following allegations (which he refuted) of \\"Corruption and abuse of office\\". As right-left tensions within DA were resolved in favour of the \\"moderate right\\", several of the founding leaders such as Friedrich Schorlemmer moved away, while the larger part that remained joined with the (East German) DSU and the (East German) CDU to form the Alliance for Germany, formally launched on 6 February 1990, with Schnur one of the co-founders. Wolfgang Schnur had for some months been spoken of as a \\"future East German prime minister\\" and at this point he retained his leading position in the enlarged party. ===Nemesis=== At the beginning of 1990 it was far from clear to most people that the path on which East Germany had embarked was a one-way street to reunification. One person with rather fewer doubts on the matter was the West German chancellor, Dr. Kohl. He had already held in-depth discussions on the issues involved with his friend Mikhail Gorbachev as they walked together in the woods behind Deidesheim (and, no doubt, in the Deidesheim restaurant where Helmut Kohl liked to entertain his fellow statesmen to hearty meals involving Saumagen). Kohl was a supporter, regularly endorsing the view that Wolfgang Schnur would make an excellent East German prime minister through the run-up to some \\"theoretical\\" coming together of the two Germanys. During the campaign that preceded the East German General election scheduled for March 1990 Helmut Kohl even took time out to join his new friend on campaign visits. On Monday, 5 March 1990 Wolfgang Schnur's political ambitions met with an insurmountable setback, however, after disclosures surfaced concerning the nature, duration and extent of his activities as a Stasi informer. The information came from the carefully maintained and indexed files held by the Ministry for State Security at their Rostock office. The following afternoon the Rostock regional party executive of DA was informed of the discoveries. They immediately sent an express courier with the news to Magdeburg where Schnur was campaigning with Helmut Kohl. The following day, which was a Wednesday, the Rostock branch confirmed to the DA national executive members Rainer Eppelmann, Oswald Wutzke and Fred Ebeling that there could be absolutely no doubt as to the authenticity of the \\"IM Torsten\\" files which had, during the intervening two days, been subjected to further scrutiny. That evening they confronted Schnur with the findings of the Rostock branch executive. Schnur's immediate reaction was that the files could not possibly refer to him, since he had never been an MfS informer. It must be a forgery. He was thinking about taking legal action. Schnur rejected the allegations again the next day, Thursday 8 March 1990: then he collapsed and was taken to hospital. On Thursday afternoon his friend and party colleague Rainer Eppelmann read out a statement to the press defending Schnur and insisting that Schnur had never worked for the Stasi. He read out Schnur's own forthright denial. Eppelmann knew by now about the files in Rostock, but still could not bring himself to believe what he had been told about what had been discovered. Sources differ over just how much evidence had been found against Wolfgang Schnur. One refers to the biographer Alexander Kobylinski, who interviewed Schnur at very great length, having also combed through 12,000 pages in 39 Stasi files. (Koblinski noted that two more of the Stasi files listed had disappeared.) After 1990 millions of Stasi files became accessible to researchers, causing widespread amazement and horror over the detailed extent of the close surveillance under which East Germans lived during the four decades up to 1989, but at the time of Schnur's unmasking it was not clear why so much detailed information should suddenly have become available to the DA regional leadership team in Rostock, less than two weeks before a general election which seemed more than likely to be followed by the appointment of Wolfgang Schnur as East Germany's first democratically endorsed prime minister (with open West German backing). The Stasi offices in Rostock had been occupied and sealed since 5 December 1989 by a local \\"Citizens' Committee\\" determined to ensure no further destruction of Stasi files. There are no clear answers on how the information about Schnur's past emerged, but there are hints. The actual discovery of Schnur's name in the Stasi records came about on account of a \\"clumsy misfiling\\" as a result of which a reference to the succession of military awards awarded to \\"the lawyer Wolfgang Schnur\\", and a couple of unexpected references to \\"meetings\\", turned up in papers being reviewed by an investigation committee working for the Citizens' Committee in Rostock on the supervision of the winding-up of the Rostock regional Stasi administrative office. During the closing months of 1989 Schnur had presumably reported back with precision and insight on his participation in the Round Table meetings, but his own contributions must nevertheless have been particularly upsetting for senior (and other) Stasi officers. An important responsibility for the Round Table participants involved supervision of the winding-up of the detested Ministry for State Security (Stasi). As a trained lawyer and as the representative at meetings of DA, it was principally Wolfgang Schnur who complained about the inadequacy of that supervision. Even after his twenty-five years as an exceptionally well-placed and productive Stasi informer, for his handlers and senior officers doubts persisted as to which team Wolfgang Schnur was really part of. Once the news broke, the first person to whom Schnur confessed his Stasi past, albeit at this stage only orally, was Helmut Kohl. From Kohl's own autobiography it appears that he may already have been aware of the breaking news, which he received from his own sources late one evening after a day of campaigning in the East German election. Kohl immediately conferred with his party colleagues Eberhard Diepgen and Bernd Neumann, who handled the (West) German CDU's relationship with DA. The priority was clarity. Kohl's team were keen to establish whether Schnur really had been working for the Stasi for many years, or whether he was simply the victim of a high-level personal undermining programme, of the kind in which the Stasi were known to specialise, launched by political opponents. CDU Party Secretary Volker Rühe thought immediately of Stasi \\"dirty tricks\\". Once, however, it had been established that the reports were true, Neumann and others in Kohl's team were keen to obtain Schnur's confession in writing as a matter of critical urgency, in order to minimise the risk that on-going doubts or some subsequent retraction might undermine the electoral prospects of the CDU's eastern ally, the Alliance for Germany. On Friday 9 March 1990, nine days ahead of the elecion, Helmut Kohl was campaigning in Rostock on behalf of his Alliance for Germany allies. It was noticed that the DA leader was unexpectedly absent from the big man's side. It was explained that reports had been received from his party that the previous day Wolfgang Schnur had collapsed with a blood circulation complaint (\\"einen Kreislaufkollaps\\"). Over the previous couple of days, reports of the discoveries in the Rostock Stasi files had been filtering through to the press, along with reports of Schnur's denials. On Monday 12 March the DA leaders issued a statement to the press in which the focus was on Schur's medical condition: it was still \\"very bad\\". Visited the previous day in hospital his face had worn a \\"glazed look\\": he was affected by heavy medication. But he had nevertheless given a declaration concerning his personal honour with great \\"mental clarity\\". The matter of the Rostock files and a detailed follow-up report appearing in Der Spiegel could only be cleared up by Schnur himself. Meanwhile, the East German prosecutor's office had already confirmed that a preliminary investigation against persons unknown had already been launched in respect of an alleged defamation. Wolfgang Schnur resigned the leadership of DA on Tuesday 13 March 1990. At the other end of the country, apparently unaware of this development, his party colleague Horst Schulz was addressing an election rally in Erfurt. Schulz told his 2,000 listeners that the allegations against party leader Schnur were a slander and a lie, meticulously prepared by Stasi experts over a long period for \\"disclosure\\" directly ahead of the election. He demonstrated his own verdict on the Rostock Stasi files by holding up what he said was an almost perfect \\"Stasi file\\" on the poet Goethe, produced by a Citizens Committee and DA in the space of just 24 hours. \\"Things which are possible even for us non- experts are childs' play for the third best security service in the world\\", he pointed out his audience. On 15 March 1990 it was reported that the DA party executive, keen to \\"draw a line under the Schnur affair\\", had excluded Wolfgang Schnur from the party at the same time as they had appointed Rainer Eppelmann as the new party leader. The election duly took place three days later DA did not perform well, but the Alliance for Germany, the three-way grouping of which they were a part, received 48% of the votes cast. ===After politics=== In October 1990 the two versions of Germany were formally reunited. In 1991 Wolfgang Schnur set up a law firm in Berlin. In 1993, however, he lost his practicing certificate on account of his \\"unsuitability\\" (\\"Unwürdigkeit\\") and for \\"Mandantenverrat\\" (serious breach of clients' trust). The ban arose out of accusations (which Schnur always denied) that in his reports to his Stasi handlers he had breached his duty of professional confidentiality towards clients, especially dissidents planning their escape from East Germany and those objecting to military service on grounds of conscience. It was confirmed by the High Court the next year. On 15 March 1996 he was convicted at the Berlin District Court on two counts under §241a of the Penal Code. §241a was added to the West German law during the early years of the Cold War, in 1951 and was deemed to have applied across the reunified country even in respect of events predating reunification. It defines as a criminal offence the action of placing someone else in danger of political persecution. Examples given of political persecution include the suffering of admonition or of damage to life or limb by violent or arbitrary measures such as deprivation of liberty or of economic disadvantage in the workplace. The case against Schnur involved Stephan Krawczyk and his wife Freya Klier, a dissident couple who were high-profile East German authors who had experienced difficulties with the authorities before 1990. The difficulties had culminated in the two of them being unceremoniously expelled to the west in 1988. Wolfgang Schnur had been their lawyer. He had also been, they believed, a friend of longstanding, and they had trusted his advice uncritically. In the 1997 case against Schnur was presumably launched on the basis of investigations involving the Stasi archives. The court determined that Schnur had breached §241a when he reported to his Stasi handlers his suspicion that Stephan Krawczyk had been in contact with western television companies. He was further convicted because the court determined that he had reported to the Stasi his suspicion that Freya Klier, who is an author, had hidden in the loft of the house where she was living a manuscript that was clearly critical of conditions in the German Democratic Republic. On conviction Wolfgang was sentenced to a total of twelve months in jail, but the sentence was suspended on the condition that he should comply with the conditions of a probation order issued as part of the sentencing process. Schnur appealed the judgement, citing an intervening decision in another case to argue that §241a had not applied in the German Democratic Republic at the time of the events giving rise to the charges, but on 27 November 1996 the court rejected his appeal. The circumstances of the §241a case gave rise to a further conviction in September 1997, this time accompanied by a DM 1,320 fine. Schnur was found guilty of having disrespected a judge whom he had accused of antisemitic acts in the course of heated pleadings. Between 1990 and 2000 there were also criminal cases involving allegations of financial misconduct. By the turn of the century Wolfgang Schnur was living in diminished circumstances with his latest wife and their two year old son in a poorly maintained \\"grey villa\\" in the Hessenwinkel district on the eastern edge of Berlin. At this stage he was describing himself as an investments and projects consultant, although according to one unsympathetic journalist his only client was a family in Niedergörsdorf who were committed to creating Europe's largest museum of agricultural machinery. The consultancy was not proving lucrative. He had acquired the house in which he lived under complicated circumstances before reunification. More recently he had sold it to a cousin, from whom he was renting it, but he was still by now badly indebted. His new wife had been deeply shocked when he had told her about his former double life. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Lawyers from Szczecin Category:People from Rostock Category:People from the Province of Pomerania Category:20th-century German lawyers Category:East German politicians Category:German Lutherans ","title":"Wolfgang Schnur"},{"id":"60309266","text":"National Highway 727AA, commonly referred to as NH 727AA is a national highway in India.

The team finished in eleventh place. Fomm joined the German women's national team in 2018, initially at lead position. The German team would have success at the Europeans. The team reached the playoffs at Fomm's first European Curling Championships with a 5–4 record. In the semifinal, they lost to the Swiss team Silvana Tirinzoni 6–4. In the bronze medal game though, the Germans turned things around. The team would win the game 7–4, winning them the bronze medal. It was her first medal at an international competition. Fomm won her first tour event this season. Two months after the Europeans, the team won the Qinghai Curling Elite. At the Worlds, her team of Daniela Jentsch, Emira Abbes and Analena Jentsch were sitting at 4–6 after their tenth game with two still to go. The team had another chance to clinch a playoff spot. But once again they lost their next game eliminating them from contention. The team did have a good final game though, beating eventual winners Switzerland 10–8 after scoring four in the last end. Team Jentsch's first event of the 2019–20 season was at the 2019 Cargill Curling Training Centre Icebreaker where they lost in the quarterfinals. They also had playoff appearances at the 2019 Cameron's Brewing Oakville Fall Classic and the Prestige Hotels & Resorts Curling Classic making the semifinals in both events.

The name originated during the medieval period, as a comparison with church windows which were called rose windows. On the oud they are called by the Arabic language term shams, meaning sun. ==History== From the medieval to the baroque periods, it was common to have ornately carved soundhole designs, called roses. These were either carved directly into the wood of the soundboard or inserted from behind and made of carved wood or parchment. The designs used for lutes and other early instruments were often inspired by the geometric patterns in Islamic art, probably from those used on the oud. During the medieval period, most such designs were 4-sided, whereas during the renaissance and baroque periods, 6-sided designs were used.

This style is still used today on classical and acoustic guitars. Modern rosettes can be made of wood or plastic. Roses inserted from behind are still used on Ouds, Lavtas, Laoutos and other modern lutes. Decorative inserted roses are also sometimes used in modern times on electro-acoustic instruments, to prevent feedback.

Upon release, the album received mixed reviews by the Latvian media. == Background and recording == The lyrics and music for the album' songs were written by the band as a whole as opposed to any particular member. The album's title is a reference to German writer Günter Wilhelm Grass' book Tin Drum, about the boy Oskar Matzerath, who distances himself from the horror of World War II. The album was recorded in three places: Rīga, Ikšķile and Stockholm, and was produced by Swedish producers Povel Olson and David Larsson.

The steeply sloping site has calcium-rich springs supporting vegetation rare in the county. ==Location and natural features== Fallowlees Flush is situated in the north-east of England in the county of Northumberland, to the west of Fontburn Reservoir and the east of Harwood Forest, west-north-west of Netherwitton and east-south-east of Forestburn Gate. The site is situated on a north-east facing slope descending from to , above sea level above a stream feeding the reservoir. ==Flora== Flora on the site grades from species rich areas fed by lime-rich springs, through to a wooded fringe by the stream. The SSSI citation sets out four distinct groups of vegetation. Moss-donimated turf dominates areas where springs arise, and are characterised by stonewort (Charales), flea-sedge (Carex pulicaris), tawny sedge (Carex hostiana), long-stalked yellow-sedge (Carex lepidocarpa) and broad-leaved cottongrass (Eriophorum latifolium). A wider area is influenced by the springs, and in addition to the sedges and cottongrass, supports dioecious sedge (Carex dioica), marsh lousewort (Pedicularis palustris), creeping willow (Salix repens), devil's-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis), purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea), marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris), meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria), jointed rush (Juncus articulatus) as well as common butterwort (Pinguicula vulgaris), grass-of-Parnassus (Parnassia palustris), marsh valerian (Valeriana dioica), and early marsh-orchid (Dactylorhiza incarnata). More acidic areas of the site support water plants such as oval sedge (Carex ovalis) and star sedge (Carex echinata), as well as greater amounts of jointed rush. Woodland areas by the stream are composed of alder (Alnus glutinosa), downy birch (Betula pubescens) and hazel (Corylus avellana). Ground flora in the woodland area includes tufted hair-grass (Deschampsia cespitosa), water avens (Geum rivale), wood crane’s-bill (Geranium sylvaticum) and a substantial stand of lesser pond- sedge (Carex acutiformis). The condition of Fallowlees Flush was judged to be favourable in 2011, with some concerns about bracken encroachment noted. ==See also== *List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Northumberland ==References== ==External links== *Natural England SSSI record for Fallowlees Flush Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Northumberland Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest notified in 1990 ","title":"Fallowlees Flush"},{"id":"60309560","text":"Poster for Let 'Er Go Gallegher Let 'Er Go Gallegher was a 1928 film based on the Gallegher character from American author Richard Harding Davis' 1891 publication Gallegher and Other Stories.

At the same time, he served on the Jos Township Advisory Board, the Provincial Education Committee, the Provincial Liquor Board, and the Jos Local Education Committee. During that time, he was also the Manager of the Jos Township School and President of the Jos Club. In the late 1950s, he returned to Onitsha and was appointed as a Senior Crown Counsel of the Eastern Region Government by the British administration. On the eve of independence in 1960, he was appointed into the Federal Public Service. Thus, he became the first Nigerian administrator to be appointed with the main purpose of redirecting the work of a government department to meet the requirement of a newly independent country. He was sent to the Royal College of Defence Studies in London for more training. When he returned to Lagos, he was posted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where he served as the first Nigerian Permanent Secretary from 1960 until 1963. In 1964, he was assigned the task of opening the Nigeria Embassy in Italy where he was Nigeria's first representative.

In North and Northwest Germany it is eaten before the beginning of the pre-Easter fasting period known as Lent, especially from Rose Monday (Rosenmontag) to Ash Wednesday (Aschermittwoch). It is basically a sweet bread roll made with milk and wheat flour that is eaten hot, hence the name: Heißwecken literally means \\"hot rolls\\". Heißwecken are predominantly eaten in the area influenced by the Hanseatic League i.e. most of northern Europe from what is now the Netherlands to Poland and the Baltic Sea coast. It has numerous dialectical names that are almost all derived from the term Heißwecken. The most common are Hedewäggen, Hetwegge, Heiteweggen and Heetwich. == General == There are several historical descriptions of Heißwecken, although there were certain variations in the different regions. They were usually round, but other shapes were also used. The sources most frequently state that the rolls were covered with hot milk and melted butter before being eaten. They were not homemade but invariably produced by bakeries. In a 1928 Schleswig-Holstein dictionary, the following description is given: \\"The Heißwecken are produced by bakers, usually to a secret recipe, as round cakes about 10-15 centimetres in diameter. The main ingredients are wheat flour, butter and sugar; various spices (caneel [\\"cinnamon\\"], cardamom, raisins) are then added to this mixture (...) Coated with butter or filled with sugar, caneel and butter and soaked in milk or egg milk, they were often eaten at every meal of the day during the first half of the 'week of fasting'.\\" There is a very similar definition in 1781 in a Low German dictionary, the Plattdeutsche Wörterbuch, from Western Pomerania, which calls them Heetweggen and says that they are \\"a Fastnacht [carnival] roll, prepared with spice, butter and eggs in hot milk as a titbit (\\"Löffelspeise\\")\\". The 1800 Holsteinische Idiotikon also records that servants in cities like Hamburg were sent to the baker in the morning in those days with a basket and cushions to keep the fresh rolls warm. Here three different types of Heetwegen were distinguished: those made from simple sweet dough with spices, finer milk rolls with additional raisins and thirdly, as the simplest variant, unsweetened rolls (round in shape). In Hamburg and Altona, \\"whole circles of relatives and acquaintances were invited to this hot breakfast, at which fine wines, spirits, mulled wines or tea were usually served to top it off.\\" In a 1737 Swedish cookbook there is a recipe for hedvägg in high cuisine. In this version, a hole was made in the soft milk roll, the inside was scooped out with a spoon, cooked in cream and butter and then used to refill the roll, which was then eaten sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. == Distribution == === Germany === Heißwecken were regionally known in Westphalia and North Germany as early as the Late Middle Ages. Evidence from the 16th and 17th centuries shows them being produced inter alia in Soest, Geseke, Lübbecke and Münster. They have been recorded in Hamburg since the 15th century; being mentioned in the cook books of St. George's Hospital in 1447 and 1457. Heetwegge are also described in the Idioticon Hamburgense in 1755: \\"heisse Wecken: warm white roll, which is kneaded with melted butter or hot milk, and fills the belly during the first week of fasting. In this way, it made all the more holy the old practice of fasting from meat.\\" The Atlas of the German Peoples (Atlas der deutschen Volkskunde) gives an overview of the distribution of Heißwecken in 1930. \\"The southernmost body of evidence in Northwest Germany extends from the north of the Bergisches Land and County of Mark to East Westphalia and reaches the Weser at the northern edge of the Lippe region. This diagonal runs from southwest to northeast, grazes Dortmund (south) and includes Soest, Lippstadt and Paderborn. Further north there is an accumulation of evidence in the area of the former Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück.\\" Heißwecken were known throughout Schleswig-Holstein and in Hamburg, and in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern up to the Zarow, which functions as a geographical cultural border. Beyond this river, pretzels were traditionally eaten instead of rolls; in Farther Pomerania, in Posen-West Prussia, in Brandenburg and in the north of Saxony-Anhalt, the usual carnival pastry at that time was the Berliner. In East Prussia, however, there were Heißwecken again, about 320 kilometres away from the rest of its distribution area. In Mecklenburg, Heißwecken were being eaten at Fastnacht as early as the 16th century. Around 1930, in the region of Greifswald/Wolgast and the County of Demmin, a Fastnacht roll known as a Böller was known which amounted to the same thing. This region came under Swedish influence after the Thirty Years' War, the County of Demmin until 1720, Greifswald-Wolgast until 1815; the word Böller is a Germanization of the Swedish bullar for milk roll. The distribution of the rolls, which is restricted on Low German language region, has led historians to posit that Heißwecken originally came from the region of Westphalia/northern Lower Saxony and then spread further eastward during the Middle Ages in the course of migration and new settlements. === Scandinavia === Modern Swedish Fastnacht roll In Sweden today there are fastlagsbulle or fettisdagsbulle, which means something like \\"Fastnacht rolls\\" . They comprise sweet milk rolls with a filling of marzipan and whipped cream. This roll was introduced by the conditoreis in the 19th century. However, even before that there were Fastnacht rolls in a much simpler form, which were basically the same as the Lower German Heißwecken. In southern Sweden, Shrove Monday is traditionally called bullamandag (\\"Roll Monday\\"). In the 18th century they still called them hetvägg in Sweden. Historical evidence is the news of the death of the Swedish king Adolf Frederick in 1771 after a meal consisting of Heißwecken, sauerkraut, meat, lobster, caviar and buckling. The oldest known mention of these rolls in Sweden dates to 1698. Segschneider assumes that the merchants of the Hanseatic League and German settlers brought Heißwecken to Sweden and the Baltic States, as early as the Middle Ages. From Riga there is a source dating to the 15th century. === United Kingdom === British hot cross buns In the United Kingdom, light-coloured, sweet, milk rolls are called buns and there are many varieties. Hot cross buns are round yeast rolls containing sugar, butter, egg, raisins and various spices such as cinnamon or nutmeg. They are traditionally eaten on Good Friday and are generally still sold warm, usually also eaten warm. They bear a cross made of lighter dough that is a symbol of the Easter cross. The word 'bun' has been used in English since the 15th century. Seasoned 'spice buns' emerged during the Tudor reign in the 15th century. In 1592, an edict was issued that allowed the sale of these rolls only on special occasions, namely Good Friday, Christmas and at funerals. Today they are sold from as early as January. ==See also== * List of buns == References == == Literature == * David, Elizabeth (1979).

His first works, in the 1970s, stood at the crossroads of conceptual art, minimal art and the tradition of modern sculpture. Afterwards, the photographical documentation of his own work became more and more significant, until it became an entire aspect of it, photographs and sculptures responding to each other and generating new works all the while. Didier Vermeiren lives and work in Paris and Brussels. He has been teaching since 2002 at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf in Germany and since 1991 at De Ateliers, Amsterdam (Netherlands). He is a member of the board of the Musée Rodin (Paris). == Work == In the late 1970s, he turned his attention to the question, essential in the history of modern sculpture, of the plinth, or base,.This question was the subject of an exhibition at the musée Rodin, in 2005, that showed some Vermeiren's sculptures, see La Sculpture dans l'espace - Rodin, Brancusi, Giacometti, Bourgeois, Vermeiren, Musée Rodin, Paris, November 2005-February 2006 creating the « plinth sculptures » through which he was introduced to the international art scene, starting with a group show at the Museum of Modern Art in 1984, titled An International Survey of Recent Painting and SculptureMuseum of Modern Art, An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture], p. 312-313.. Traditionally, the base was not considered to be part of the sculpture, but served to transport the sculpted figure from the \\"real\\" space into the artistic or monumental space. The function of the plinth as pedestal then gradually disappeared in the course of the twentieth century. Whereas certain artists, like Brancusi, turned the plinth into an integral part of their work by incorporating it into the sculpture, others no longer wanted the sculpted object to be separated from the ground by this presentational element and chose to place the sculpture directly on the floor, on the same level as the spectatorSee Dominic Van Den Boogerd in « Caryatid by moonlight », in Didier Vermeiren: Collection de solides, Van Abbemuseum, exhibition catalogue, 1986 : « The modern sculpture of the twentieth century extricated itself from the tradition of the pedestal. That history is well-known. Rodin was the first to model his own bases for his figures; Brancusi treated the pedestal as an integral part of his work; and with Andre and Judd the pedestal was banished altogether ». Modernism, in other words, made the plinth useless. Taking this development seriously, but wanting to think it through more rigorously, Vermeiren reevaluated the purpose of the plinth and turned it into an autonomous volume in the space: if the plinth is a base or a foundation, it can be displayed for its own sake and on its own merits, taking on the fate of a work of art. All that is left is the pure presence on the ground and its many sculptural possibilities\\"If one thing is certain, it's the question of where a sculpture starts. It starts on the floor. It has no boundaries, in terms of height and width, but it does on the floor. That's the crucial point, the place where sculpture happens — right here on the floor\\", interview of the artist 123 plans sur la sculpture de Didier Vermeiren , réal. Elsa Cayo, 26 min, 1988. This interview is also available on the Tate Modern website, in Tate Papers n°8, Didier Vermeiren, Je travaille sur la présence. This gave rise to an ongoing dialogue with space. Situating works in the space and reconfiguring the space in relation to these works became the purpose of every exhibition. For Vermeiren, space is not empty, but plastic, which is why he thinks of his works as hollowing it out and sculpting it \\"The actual material of the sculpture is the space. The space creates the sculpture and the sculpture creates the space\\", interview of the artist 123 plans sur la sculpture de Didier Vermeiren , réal. Elsa Cayo, 26 min, 1988. Sculpture's incorporation of the space — the entire space, including the firmament — constitutes one of the characteristic features of twentieth-century sculpture. Carl Andre, in dialogue with Brancusi's Endless Column, once stated that his sculptures, as horizontal, flat and low-lying as they are, nevertheless support \\"a column of air\\" on their entire surface area. This column can be pictured as extending \\"endlessly\\" above the works, or as bounded by the vault of heaven or that of a building\\"I don't think of them as being flat at all. I think, in a sense, that each piece supports a column of air that extends to the top of the atmosphere. They're zones. I hardly think of them as flat, any more than one would consider a country flat, because if you look at it on a map it appears flat\\", Phyllis Tuchman, \\"An Interview with Carl Andre\\", Artforum n°10 (june 1970), p. 60-61.. Beginning in the seventies, Vermeiren set out to explore this incorporation of space and the sculptural demarcation of pure presence on the ground. We might think here of his works consisting of an object made of solid and heavy material (a parallelipided of stone, plaster or iron) placed on an object of identical size but made of soft and light material (polyurethane foam), with one crushing the other in a demonstration of the weight of the work in every sculptural project\\"In the works with styrofoam the important thing is that the traditional relations between sculpture and plinth are switched; and you have to remember that in the traditional relationship the plinth is more solid than the sculpture standing on it. Here the opposite is the case\\", 123 plans sur la sculpture de Didier Vermeiren , réal. Elsa Cayo, 26 min, 1988. Then, in a direct confrontation with the problem of the plinth — which is also the problem of tradition — Vermeiren began to exhibit « replicasVoir Michel Gauthier, « Transferts (sur les «répliques» de socles dans la sculpture de Didier Vermeiren) » in Les Cahiers du Musée national d'art moderne n°47, p. 117-131, 1994 » of plinths of sculptures by Rodin, Carpeaux, Chamberlain..., usually made from the same material (plaster, bronze, etc.) as the figures their originals supported in the museum. It was no longer space in general that was incorporated into the work, but the space of tradition — in a gesture of memory\\"Vermeiren's work embody the memory of both Giacometti's Palace and Donatello's dancing children, of Carl Andre's floor pieces as well as the endless columns of Brancusi. For the sculptor material, says Vermeiren, is not plaster bronze or marble, but recollection\\", Dominic van den Boogerd, « Caryatid by moonlight », in Didier Vermeiren, Collection de Solides, Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, 2003.. The plinth for Vermeiren is thus not simply a \\"ready-made\\" or a found object\\"It is true that I make mine something that already exists, but I don't think that It can be seen as a ready-made. A plinth is something that already belongs to the art world. Whereas a ready-made is something that has been taken outside the art world and is now incorporated into it\\", interview of the artist in 123 plans sur la sculpture de Didier Vermeiren , réal. Elsa Cayo, 26 min, 1988, but rather brings into play the very origin of the work of art« Before sculpture, ergo, there was sculpture. This is precisely the message of Vermeiren's work, who claims his anchorage in the history of an art whose innermost principle harbors a sort of perpetual echo (...) repetition, translation, are the very essence of the history of sculpture », Jean-Pierre Criqui, « Six Remarks on the Sculpture of Didier Vermeiren », in Didier Vermeiren, Centre d'art contemporain du Domaine de Kerguéhennec, Locminé, 1991, p. 12.. In a truly plastic process, the artist reconfigures, reworks and \\"sculpts\\" the chosen volume using traditional techniques (such as modelling, moulding or assemblage) in order to accomplish the incorporation of space and presence into the work. To this end, a \\"plinth\\" can be posed in reverse on another one identical to it, or on its negative (its own mould), or even turned inside out like a glove with the armature on the outside. Thus, if Vermeiren's sculptures often make references to other sculptures that belong to the history of his art, this approach only becomes meaningful to the extent that his pieces also refer back and forth to each other within his own body of work. A sculpture is always like a term in a sequence and forms a response to earlier works. In this sense, Vermeiren's work is also always a remembering of his work. Each of the artist's exhibition looks both backward and forward\\"My sculptures refer to the work of other sculptors, but also to my own. That means there are backward glances from sculpture to sculpture. One sculpture alone can't exist. A single sculpture doesn't say anything yet. The works form a network, but they also work as individual articulations. If I make a sculpture, it's defined by the scultpure I made before; and it defines the sculpture I'll make afterwards. All sculptures constitute one large ensemble\\", 123 plans sur la sculpture de Didier Vermeiren , réal. Elsa Cayo, 26 min, 1988. A quote of the same statement is to be found in Erik Verhagen, « Endogenous / Exogenous: Didier Vermeiren's Dangling Signs », in Didier Vermeiren, Solides Géométriques - Vues d'Atelier, exhibition catalogue, Musée Bourdelle, Paris, 2005, p. 20. See Erik Verhagen, « Didier Vermeiren, Much More than a Minimalist », in artpress n°392, juin 2012, p. 48 : « For Vermeiren, the moment of exhibition is always synonymous with a present where the dynamics of looking forward and looking backward converge in a single movement, and where older pieces dialogue with and reveal themselves through newer work, which, furthermore, announces what will probably come next» == Collections == Vermeiren's works are part of several major public collections such as the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New-York, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Chicago, the Tate Modern, London, the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, the Bonnefanten Museum, Maastricht. == Exhibitions == Skulpturenpark Walfrieden, Wuppertal, 2012 * 1974 Galerie Delta, Brussels * 1976 Galerie Albert Baronian, Brussels; Galleria Massimo Minini, Brescia * 1977 Galerie Maier Hahn, Düsseldorf, Germany * 1979 814 Spring Street, Los Angeles; 11 rue Clavel, Paris * 1980 Vereniging voor het Museum van Hedendaagse Kunst, Gent * 1981 Galleria Massimo Minini, Brescia * 1982 Galerie Micheline Szwajcer, Antwerpen * 1983 Galerie Eric Fabre, Paris * 1984 Artist Space, New York (exhibition catalogue); Galerie Micheline Szwajcer, Antwerpen * 1985 Galerie Pietro Sparta, Chagny (exhibition catalogue) * 1987 Galerie Art & Project, Amsterdam; Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels & Villa Arson, Nice (exhibition catalogue) * 1988 Galleria Massimo Minini, Brescia, Italy; Le Consortium, Dijon, France * 1990 Donald Young Gallery, Chicago; Bonnefantenmuseum, Maastricht, NL (exhibition catalogue) * 1991 Centre d'Art Contemporain du Domaine de Kerguéhennec, Bignan (exhibition catalogue); Galerie Micheline Szwajcer, Antwerpen * 1992 Galerie Jean Bernier, Athens, Greece; Galerie Ghislaine Hussenot, Paris * 1993 Museum Haus Lange, Museum Haus Esters, Krefeld, Germany (exhibition catalogue) * 1995 Kusthalle Zürich (exhibition catalogue); Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume, Paris (exhibition catalogue); XLIVe Biennale di Venezia, Belgian pavilion (exhibition catalogue) * 1998 La Criée, Centre d'art contemporain, Rennes, France * 2000 Galerie Nächst St. Stephan, Wien, Austria; Galerie Xavier Hufkens, Brussels * 2002 Galerie Massimo Minini, Brescia * 2003 Collection de Solides, Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, NL (exhibition catalogue) * 2005-2006 Solides géométriques – Photoreliefs – Vues d’atelier, Musée Bourdelle, Paris (exhibition catalogue) * 2009 Galerie Greta Meert, Brussels * 2012 Galerie Greta Meert, Brussels Sculptures 1974 – 1995; Musée Dhont – Dhaenens, Deurle Sculptures; La Maison Rouge, Paris Didier Vermeiren, Sculptures et Photographies * 2012-2013 Skulpturen Park, Walfrieden, Wuppertal Didier Vermeiren, Sculptures (exhibition catalogue) * 2013 Église Saint Philibert, Dijon Étude pour un Monument à Philippe Pot (1996-2012) * 2016 Galerie Greta Meert, Brussels * 2017 Construction de distance, Rennes, Frac Bretagne, France * 2018 Galerie Laurence Bernard, Geneva, Sculptures / Photographies == Group shows (selection) == Didier Vermeiren - Zeitlos, Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin, 1988 * 1984 An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture, Museum of Modern Art, New York, États-Unis (cat., pp. 312-313) * 1985 Athènes – Site de la création, création d’un site, Dracos Art Center, Athènes, Grèce (cat.).

In 1921 they expanded into the town of Gold Hill where they converted an hotel into the Blue Bird Lodge. The Blue Bird Lodge served as a vacation spot for Chicago's working-class women, providing a respite from the city. The lodge was sold in 1962 by the Holiday House Association, but the building continues to function as an hotel.

He had also served as a prosecuting attorney, a prosecutor and as a judge. ==Early life== Torres was born on October 16, 1844 from a poor family in Santa Cruz, Manila. His father died in a ship mishap when he was still young; his mother, Luciana Santos–Torres, died during the cholera epidemic of 1882. ===Education and career=== Torrest obtained his Bachelor of Philosophy in Colegio de San Juan de Letran. He obtained his Bachelor of Canon Law and Bachelor of Civil Law at the University of Santo Tomas in 1866 and 1868, respectively. ===Marriage=== Torres was married to Sabina Vergara with whom he had six children: Manuel, a prominent lawyer; Luis, former Justice of the Supreme Court; Antonio, a councilor and a former Chief of Police of Manila, Pilar, Alejandra and Rosita. ==Career== He was admitted to the bar in 1871 and was immediately appointed as the prosecuting fiscal of the Court of First Instance in the judicial district of Binondo, Manila.

He was the cousin of the poet Émile Verhaeren. He studied at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts of Brussels under Jean-François Portaels and Louis Dubois. He studied still lifes by the old masters to perfect his technique. Lost in thoughts Verhaeren was a member of the group of artists called Chrysalide founded in Brussels in 1875 and to which belonged artists such as James Ensor, Constantin Meunier and Frans Van Leemputten. Chrysalide held its first exhibition in 1876 and the last one in 1881. Verhaeren remained independent for a while until he joined the Cercle Pour l'Art.Jules Du Jardin, L'Art Flamand, Bruxelles, A. Boitte, 1896, p. 81-85 He later joined an association for young artists, which was given the Dutch name Voorwaarts ('Forward') in 1885. Co-founders were Franz Meerts and Louis Baretta. Its motto was: Hooger is ons doel ('Higher is our goal'). What is remarkable is both the Dutch-language name of the association and the Dutch-language motto. Its members included Ernest Hoerickx, Léon Massaux, Emile Rimbout, Jan Stobbaerts, Pieter Stobbaerts, Eugène Surinx, Flori van Acker and Camille Wauters. Later others joined including Theodoor Verstraete, Emile Claus, Adrien-Joseph Heymans, Gustave Vanaise, Victor Gilsoul, Eugène Laermans, August De Bats, Henri Ottevaere and Emile Van Doren. The first salon of Voorwaarts was held in 1885 in the IJzerenkruistraat in the bustling heart of Brussels. In 1888 Voorwaarts exhibited in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels. The association ceased to exist in 1893.Ernest Verlat, Exposition du Voorwaarts 1892 in: La Jeune Belgique, 1892, XI, 2, p. 124 Interior of a church Verhaeren participated in numerous exhibitions: in Paris in 1889, in Berlin in 1891 and at the Maison des Arts in Brussels in 1896. At the Exposition Universelle (1900) he won a silver medal.

Critics appreciated the discipline she showed in constructing a solid base on which these stylistic phases evolved. As one of them, Helen Appleton Read of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, said in 1932, she was \\"at heart a painter with a painter's sensuous enjoyment of the medium itself.\\" L'Engle herself at one time described her art as \\"a play of form and color\\" and at another said, \\"My pictures represent my feelings about experiences. They are experiments in modern art.\\" Over the course of a long career she used studios in both Manhattan and Provincetown and exhibited in both commercial galleries and the annual shows held by two membership organizations, the New York Society of Women Artists and the Provincetown Art Association. ==Early life and training== L'Engle was born in Manhattan on September 26, 1889, to a wealthy real estate broker and his wife. As a young adult she traveled abroad to study art without enrolling in an instructional program. In 1922 she reported that she received \\"conventional school training\\" at the Art League and in Paris. By \\"Art League\\" she meant the Art Students League, where, between 1911 and 1912 she studied with George Bridgman and others. By \\"Paris\\" she meant a subsequent two years of informal study with the cubist painter, Albert Gleizes and also spent two years in classes at the Académie Julian. Although not mentioned in 1922, her grandson reports that in 1909 she may have attended a session of Charles Webster Hawthorne's Cape Cod School of Art in Provincetown. After returning to the United States in 1916 she spent the next two summers at the Hawthorne school and in 1924 returned to Paris for further study with Gleizes, who by then had become a friend and colleague as well as teacher. ==Career in art== In April, 1918, L'Engle contributed two paintings to the second annual exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists, an organization that abided by the slogan \\"no jury, no prizes\\" and that welcomed all artists to show their work on payment of a small fee. She contributed paintings to subsequent exhibitions in 1920 through 1923, 1925, and 1936. In the summer of 1918 she set up a studio in Provincetown and showed at the fourth annual exhibition of the Provincetown Art Association. From this time until 1946 she contributed paintings to the association's annual exhibitions almost every year. In 1922 she participated in a joint exhibition with Florance Waterbury, an artist, who, like herself, came from a prosperous and well-connected New York family and who, like herself, had studied at the Hawthorne summer school. Held at the newly-opened Art Centre, the show attracted notice of the prominent New York critics. The critic for the New York Times was interested in her handling of form and color, while the Evening Post contrasted Waterbury's decorative paintings with L'Engle's modernistic ones, and the Evening Telegram admired the \\"rare personal quality and a freshness of viewpoint, combined with an unusual sense of coloring.\\" Later in 1922 L'Engle participated in a group show held by Salons of America and did so again in 1925 and 1934. In 1925 L'Engle was invited to show in an Parisian exhibition of Cubist paintings called L'Art Aujourd'hui that included the principal French exponents of that style. That year she also became a founding member and subsequently an officer of the New York Society of Women Artists, an organization that was created to provide a radical alternative for women who were dissatisfied with the relatively conservative National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors. She showed in the society's exhibition of 1926 and in most later years until 1949. In 1930 she showed for the first time in a commercial gallery, the S. P. R. Penthouse Galleries belonging to a group of architects and designers whose goal was the development of a distinctive American modernism in design. In 1931 and again in 1933 and 1934 she participated in group exhibitions held at a commercial gallery, the Weyhe Gallery. With her in the 1931 show were Dorothy Brett, Caroline Durieux, Elinor Gobson, Lois Lenski, Alice Newton, Amelie Pumpelly, Ruth Starr Rose, and Helen Woods Rous. She showed paintings at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts annual of 1934 and showed prints in a group exhibition at the Grant Gallery in 1939. In 1947 she participated in a four-woman show at the Studio Gallery and in 1951 was given a solo exhibition at the Wellons Gallery. Appearing with her husband William L'Engle in 1956 at the Bodley Gallery, she showed composite works that were called montages at the time and that have since come to be known as combines. The Times critic said \\"Mrs. L'Engle has assembled bits and pieces of many materials in her montages. Her idea is to show, by example, that costly materials are not necessary for creation.\\" She had a solo exhibition at the Lynn Kottler Gallery in 1962 and in 1965 showed drawings of archaic Greek sculpture at the Hotel Barbizon. L'Engle died in Provincetown on March 14, 1978. Posthumous exhibitions include joint exhibitions for both L'Engles in 1978 and 1999 in Provincetown, in 1997 in Truro, Massachusetts, and in 2010 at D. Wigmore Fine Art. ===Artistic style and critical reception=== Lucy L'Engle, Boats on the Beach at Cavalaire, France, 1923, 23 1/2 x 28 3/4 inches Lucy L'Engle, Standing Figure, 1927, 60 x 24 inches Lucy L'Engle, Two Nuns, 1944, watercolor, 14 x 19 inches Lucy L'Engle, Graffiti, 1951, gouache, ink, and graphite on paper, 18 x 22 3/4 inches L'Engle's early style was Cubist, based on her association with Albert Gleizes. Later, she said she felt she could continue for a long time to express herself in that mode, but then, as later, her approach was eclectic and she also painted in a more individual style which reminded critics of fellow Provincetown artists, Oliver Chaffee and Agnes Weinrich whose manner of painting could not be easily pigeon-holed. The paintings, \\"Boats on the Beach at Cavalaire\\" of 1923 (shown at left) and \\"Standing Figure\\" of 1927 (shown at right) illustrate her early style. Writing in 1928 of a complex work showing an interior view with mirror and a through view to a tall building outside, Elizabeth L. Cary of the New York Times credited L'Engle with a \\"clear precision\\" and said the work \\"succeeds quite remarkably in keeping everything in its separate plane without insistence on planar perspective.\\" As a member of a small group of women exhibiting in 1930, L'Engle subscribed to a practice of evolving \\"a more modern American style,\\" one that was more in keeping with 20th Century American life than are the prevailing Continental designs.\\" Noting that L'Engle seemed to have stopped making pure abstractions, Helen Appleton Read of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle wrote in 1931 that L'Engle appeared to have been \\"always at heart a painter with a painter's sensuous enjoyment of the medium itself.\\" In 1932, when L'Engle showed with Adelaide Lawson and Alice Newton a critic for the New York Evening Post said \\"her interest in abstractions has enabled her to build up a solid structure of organic design. In 1934, 1936, and again in 1943 critics called attention to her skill in composition. During the late 1940s L'Engle painted pure abstractions that Howard Devree called \\"bright\\" and \\"well- organized.\\" The painting, \\"Two Nuns,\\" (at left) shows L'Engle's representational style of the 1930s and 1940s and her \\"Graffiti,\\" (at right) is an example of a pure abstraction from the late 1940s and early 1950s. Later in the 1950s she made montages incorporating metal foil, wire, wood, plaster, and broken glass as well as paint. She became interested in archaic Greek statues in the 1960s and, during that period, exhibited drawings of pieces she found in the Athens Museum. ==Personal life and family== L'Engle was the daughter of a prosperous Manhattan real estate broker, Charles Stelle Brown (1851-1935), known as C. S. Brown, and his wife Lucy Barnes Brown (1859-1924). C. S. Brown began business in 1893 and continued working as a broker specializing in valuations and appraisals for the next 41 years. The business he ran is now known as Brown Harris Stevens. Lucy B. Brown made her name when in 1895 she won the first U. S. women's amateur golfing championship. L'Engle had three brothers, Archibald Manning Brown, an architect; Lathrop Brown, a real estate executive who became a U.S Congressman for New York; and Charles Stelle Brown, Jr., who succeeded his father in the real estate business. In 1914 she married the artist William L'Engle in a civil ceremony in Paris where both were studying art. They were married a second time in a religious ceremony shortly afterwards. The couple spent a year on an automotive tour of Europe. Their first child, Madeleine, was born in Marseille shortly before their return to the U.S. in 1915. After returning to the U.S. the L'Engles lived in Manhattan. Her parents usually spent the warm months in their mansion in Mount Kisco, New York and the cold ones at a club on Jekyll Island, Georgia, leaving their Manhattan apartment available for the L'Engles to use. The couple's second child, Camille, was born in 1917. In 1923 the family spent the summer in Cavalaire, a small coastal town near the Côte d'Azur in Provence, with Albert Gleizes and his wife. The following year they moved their summer quarters from Provincetown to Truro. During the 1930s and 1940s, the L'Engles traveled in Cuba, Mexico, and New Mexico as well as St. Augustine, Florida. After William L'Engle died in 1957 Lucy L'Engle opened his Provincetown studio as a gallery to show his work. She also donated many of his paintings and drawings to museums. == Notes == ==References== Category:1889 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Artists from New York City Category:Abstract painters Category:20th-century American painters Category:American women painters ","title":"Lucy L'Engle"},{"id":"60309987","text":"Conquest Pictures was a film production unit launched in 1917 as part of Thomas A. Edison Inc. It produced films for young people and families including subjects from popular children's authors such as Robert Louis Stevenson, Richard Harding Davis, Ralph Henry Barbour, and Mary Shipman Andrews. Anna M. Callan was in charge of the division. Its films were distributed through the George Kleine System. It closed in 1918 and its films were sold off as Edison exited the film production business. ==Background== Conquest's first release was July 14, 1917. The Conquest Pictures plan included weekly releases of 7 reels of film including varying content such as a main 4-reel film, a 1-reel comedy, a 1-reel travel feature, and magazine style news reel. The films could also be ordered individually. The programs were intended to be promoted by involvement from women's clubs who advocated for wholesome fare and marketed to educators and families. In February 1918, an advertisement touting Conquest Pictures programs ran in the Boy Scouts of America publication Boys Life. The ad compared the film programs to the Every Boy's Library calling them the \\"Every Boy's Library of the Motion Picture World\\". Edison's movie division faced stiff competition and difficult times in the World War I era. In 1918 the Lincoln and Parker Film Company of Worcester, Massachusetts acquired Edison film company assets and equipment as well as some of its film footage including Conquest's programs. ==Filmography== ===Conquest Program #2=== *Knights of the Square Table, a film adaptation from James A.

The book, which became a New York Times Bestseller, is about three German women during and after World War II. The three are widows of conspirators involved in the assassination attempt on Hitler, and each deals with the fallout of her personal life and the devastation around her differently. == Background == According to the author, she grew up with a deep sense of shame for being half-German. She was embarrassed by her mother's accent, and avoided family tree projects at school. She inherited this shame and hatred of Germany from her mother, who had arrived in the United States at age 16 to work as an au pair, and remained on an academic scholarship. The mother had been born during the war, Germany's ugliest episode, and her parents had been Nazis. When she married, they were not invited. As an adult, Shattuck began to make sense of her complex emotions, and develop curiosity as to the experiences of \\"ordinary\\" Germans of the Nazi era. She grew more interested in her family history after her mother's death, and spent a summer during college in Germany interviewing her grandmother. The grandmother was very open about her history and attitudes, as Shattuck wrote: \\"Unlike many Germans her age, including my grandfather, she did not want to sweep these subjects under the carpet. As I knew her, she was not a racist or an anti-Semite. And she wanted to explain how it was possible that she could have been swept up in a movement that later became synonymous with evil. She did not want to be forgiven. She wanted to be understood. This is, I think, an important and often confused distinction. And in some ways, it formed the foundation of my novel.\\" Another source of inspiration for the novel was a family friend whose father had been executed for participating in a plot to assassinate Hitler. Shattuck was struck by the difference in the life narrative of those whose German connections were on the \\"right\\" side of history, and set out to explore both sides in greater depth. == Plot summary == The story begins at the site of a Bavarian castle in 1938, with detailed descriptions of the society of the pre-war days in Germany among a certain class of landed aristocrats. Countess Marianne von Lingenfels is hosting her family’s annual party, at which men wearing Nazi insignia parade casually through the grounds, while inside, privately, a small group of young men, including Marianne’s husband, are plotting armed resistance against the nation’s leader, Adolf Hitler. The novel then advances to the year 1945. The war has ended and the conspirators have been executed after their failed attempt to assassinate Hitler. Marianne, back at the same crumbling castle, is determined to \\"do right\\" by the wives and children of the men who died trying to save her homeland from a tyrant. She is raising three children by herself, in occupied post-Nazi Germany. She then rescues 6-year-old Martin, the son of her dearest childhood friend, from a Nazi reeducation home. Together, they make their way across the smoldering wreckage of their homeland to Berlin, where Martin’s mother, the beautiful and naive Benita, in the hands of the occupying Red Army. Finally, she locates Ania, another resister’s wife, and her two sons, now refugees in one of the many camps that house the millions displaced by the war. As Marianne assembles this makeshift family from the ruins of her husband’s resistance movement, she is certain their shared pain and circumstances will hold them together. But devastated by trauma, broken by the deprivations and brutality they suffered in the war, and burdened by their own guilt, Marianne finds that nothing is as black and white as she thought. Each woman's experiences, attitudes, and feelings about the war, their husbands, Germany and each other are at the core of the book's narrative, as well as how they see the rest of their lives, and what they do to get there. == Characters == The main characters are the three women who are \\"the women in the castle\\": *Marianne von Lingenfels: A fierce, cultured, vehemently anti- Nazi aristocrat with a sense of righteousness that is the source of her strength—and, ultimately, her greatest weakness. Her husband, Albrecht, was involved in a plot to assassinate Hitler, together with Marianne's childhood friend Connie Flederman, and several other men. *Benita Fledermann: Connie's young new bride, she is from a peasant background, non-political, but like most of her milieu, participating in the Nazi rush of nationalism. She is disappointed by her marriage to the young aristocrat, but is very devoted to their son. *Ania Grabarek: A woman of fervent patriotism and dark secrets who is far different from what she appears. Unlike the first two women, she is unknown to the reader at the beginning of the book - she comes into the story during the devastation of post-war Europe, having learned how to keep herself and her two sons safe in all the hardest ways. == Reception == The book was mostly well-received, and rapidly became a New York Times bestseller. According to NPR, the book offers a never-before seen perspective of Germany during the Nazi period. Carrie Callaghan, for the Washington Independent, called the novel \\"brave\\" and wrote \\"'The Women in the Castle' pleads the case for humanity as both dreadful and beautiful.\\" Publishers Weekly also called the book's perspective \\"unique\\", and praised Shattuck's exacting research, which contributed to the novel's historic realism. Judith Reveal called Shattuck \\"a genius at character development and narrative description\\" in her New York Journal of Books review, and Mary Pols, in her New York Times review, wrote \\"Shattuck’s characters represent the range of responses to fascism. Her achievement — beyond unfolding a plot that surprises and devastates — is in her subtle exploration of what a moral righteousness like Marianne’s looks like in the aftermath of war, when communities and lives must be rebuilt, together.\\" === Recognition === * New York Times bestseller * Short list, New York Times best fiction 2017 * Goodreads Choice Awards Semifinalist == References == Category:2017 American novels Category:Novels set during World War II Category:Historical novels Category:Novels set in Germany ","title":"The Women in the Castle"},{"id":"60310077","text":"Persona () is a South Korean anthology web television series starring Lee Ji- eun.

Waller was educated at Harrow 1775–6; and matriculated from Trinity, Dublin 17 Apr. 1779, aged 17. He was further educated at Lincoln Inn 1783. He married Isabella Sarah Oliver, daughter of Silver Oliver, of Castle Oliver, and aunt of William Silver Oliver. Silver Oliver was MP for Limerick from 1768–83. Waller was a descendant of Hardress Waller MP for County Limerick from 1639–61. Waller was also Sheriff, Co.

Though he was known as an opponent of the Act of Union he was personally friendly with the main supporter of the Act, Lord Clare and the administration in Dublin Castle believed he was of their way of thinking. He was elected unopposed in 1801. In his brief period as MP there is no record of him taking his seat. He declined to stand in 1802 and the seat was taken by his brother-in-law Charles Silver Oliver. ==Later life== Little is known of Waller after he left politics other than he and Lady Waller traveled to France and in 1805 Waller was detained by the French at Verdun and refused to accept special treatment because of his acquaintance with General Arthur O'Connor and in 1806 Lady Waller died in France. It's possible Waller was a prisoner of war in Verdun as he was a Captain in the 88th Foot as his own death notice mentioned.

To combine his Western-oriented musical education and Chinese-Taiwanese cultural tradition, he creates music that is Western structured and plays with Western musical instruments, but his music has a Chinese-Taiwanese characteristic and spirit in its sound. His compositions reflect both traditional Western Classical and Chinese music influences. Most of his musical creations belong to piano music. Although his piano sonatas are sophisticated to play and offer pianists the opportunity to demonstrate their virtuosity, his piano sonatinas are suitable for piano training with a high demand on musicality. Due to his work as a music professor at National Taiwan Normal University, he elaborates systematically teaching materials for music education from the primary school level to the secondary school level, with a focus on solfège practice and fundamental music training. In cooperation with Taiwanese contemporary poets, for example, Xi Murong, he composes several lieders that reflect the zeitgeist of the modern Taiwanese society. In 2013, Chen Mao-shuen was honored by the 17th National Awards of Art in Taiwan for his contributions to music composition and education. == Biography == In 1955, Chen Mao-shuen enrolled in the department of music at Taiwan Provincial Normal College (now National Taiwan Normal University), majoring in piano. In his last college year, he studied music analysis and composition with Hsu Tsang-houei, who had just finished his studies in France and came back to Taiwan. He began to teach at Chiayi Normal College (presently National Chiayi University) in 1966. In 1970, he went to Vienna to study composition at the Hochschule für Musik und Darstellende Kunst (now University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna). In 1972, Chen returned from Vienna and began to teach music at Soochow University and National Taiwan Normal University. From 1985 to 1991, Chen was dean of the Department of Music and Institute of Music Research at National Taiwan Normal University. He also served as deputy director of the Experimental Symphony Orchestra (now the National Symphony Orchestra) and the National Experimental Choir (now the Taiwan National Choir). After retiring from National Taiwan Normal University in 1999, Chen began to teach as a guest professor for the department of music at Shih Chien University. Since 2008, Chen has been teaching as a distinguished visiting professor in the Department of Applied Music at Aletheia University. == Contributions to composition and music education == Chen has made considerable contributions to composition and music education in Taiwan. To promote contemporary music composition, he organized a music society called Waves Music in 1962. In 1983, in collaboration with his students, he formed a composer organization called Formusica, which has now expanded with about 30 regular composer members and organizes annual concerts to introduce new compositions. In 1992, with the pianist Wang En, he co- established the WACH Conservatory of Music, which introduced several fundamental music teaching materials and set up an integrated music testing system in Taiwan. == Compositions== * 17 piano sonatas from 1960 to 2017 * 35 piano sonatinas from 1980 to 2015 * 2 piano nocturnes * 2 piano fantasy ballads * 1 ballad for two pianos * 14 pieces of chamber music * 5 pieces for symphony orchestra * 4 concertos for piano, cello, trumpet, and oboe * 29 Chinese lieder * 1 musical ballet: Dayan and Tien Lien == Publications for music education== * 1983: Lessons and Exercises on Music Theory * 1984: Music for Solfège Practice Vol. 1-4 * 1984: Atonal Music for Solfège Practice Vol. 1-2 * 1984: Solfège for Pitch and Rhythmic Practice * 1984: Fundamental Rhythmic Lessons and Exercise * 1986: Lessons and Exercises on Slow Beats * 1987: Clave Lessons and Exercises for Piano 2:3, 3:2 * 1990: Clave Lessons and Exercises for Piano 3:4, 4:3 * 1995: Fundamental Music Training (84 vols.) == References == Category:1936 births Category:Living people Category:National Taiwan Normal University alumni Category:People from Yunlin County Category:Taiwanese composers Category:20th-century Taiwanese musicians Category:21st-century Taiwanese musicians Category:Taiwanese music educators Category:National Taiwan Normal University faculty Category:Soochow University (Taiwan) faculty Category:Taiwanese expatriates in Austria Category:University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna alumni ","title":"Chen Mao-shuen"},{"id":"60310317","text":"Haga Kashif Badri is a Sudanese women's rights activist, one of the pioneer women in Sudanese education. == Education == Born in Omdurman, Haga completed her primary, intermediate and secondary education in Omdurman.

Their music and lyrics, which are written exclusively in Old Church Slavonic language, are inspired by the Eastern Orthodox Church. The band members wear habits and eastern orthodox schemas during live performances to conceal their identities, and remain anonymous. In contrast with many other black metal bands, they use seven, eight and recently nine string guitars. ==Name== The word Batushka (Russian Cyrillic: Батюшка) is the titular equivalent of a hieromonk in Eastern Orthodoxy or, broadly, of any Orthodox priest. The transcription used by the band is improper, another possible transcription of Батюшка into Latin would be Batyushka. ==History== Batushka was founded in Białystok, Poland in the spring of 2015 by multi instrumentalist Krzysztof \\"Derph\\" Drabikowski at his home studio; Sphieratz Productions in Sobolewo, he came up with the idea of combining black metal and traditional liturgical songs of the Orthodox Church after reading comments on YouTube videos of Orthodox music, saying how \\"God’s hymns are more metal than any satanic black metal music out there\\". Throughout the first quarter of 2015, Drabikowski proceeded to compose and record the music, write the lyrics, paint the artwork for the album and create the band's overall concept by himself until deciding to bring Marcin Bielemiuk to re-record the drum parts in acoustic percussion. Drabikowski originally invited his friend and former Heuresis bandmate Lech to do the vocal parts but dropped out of the project because he didn't know how to write old Church Slavonic. In July 2015, before adding the finishing touches on the album, Drabikowski recruited Hermh vocalist Bartłomiej Krysiuk to record the vocals. The album was completed in the following months and Drabikowski convinced Krysiuk and Bielemiuk to make Batushka an anonymous project, according to Drabikowski this was decided in order for the listeners to focus on the musical experience itself, as such and for the next year the band's line up remained unknown to the public and started using monikers in Cyrillic to further conceal their identities. The group released the single \\"Yekteníya VII\\" in November 2015, prior to their debut album Литоургиіа (\\"Litourgiya\\") (English: Lithurgy) in December. Both recordings were released through Witching Hour Productions, owned by vocalist Bartłomiej Krysiuk. The album was critically acclaimed, with various sites naming Litourgiya one of the best metal albums of 2015, it also became a commercial hit in the Polish metal scene. The album's overwhelming success prompted the band to start touring due to massive demand from various European festivals. The band's live line up featured a total of 8 performers: Drabikowski on lead guitars, Krysiuk on lead vocals, and Bielemiuk on drums alongside 3 backing vocalists, a bassist, and a rhythm guitarist. Following some regional touring, concerts in Russia and Belarus were also planned, but were canceled due to protests and alleged death threats made against them. This incident also ended the public anonymity of the band's core line up since Drabikowski started doing interviews explaining the situation. In 2016, together with Behemoth and Bölzer, the group embarked on a concert tour in Poland called Rzeczpospolita Niewierna (English translation: The Republic of the Unfaithful). In 2017 they performed at Wacken Open Air and Brutal Assault. In October 2017, the band were signed to Metal Blade Records in the US and rereleased Litourgiya worldwide in both physical media and digital platforms, the signing of the band, however, was done without the knowledge and involvement of founder and main composer Krzysztof Drabikowski. In April 2018, Marcin Bielemiuk left the project for undisclosed reasons. A year later on May 24, 2019, he stated on a Facebook post that he was fired by Drabikowski after he criticized his attitude and behaviour toward him, Krysiuk and the rest of the band's live performers. ==Split with key members== On 23 December 2018, Drabikowski announced via the Batushka Instagram account that he had decided to part ways with vocalist Bartłomiej Krysiuk \\"due to innappropriate behaviour on his part.\\" In the same post, Drabikowski stated that \\"There were attempts to take my creation Batushka away from me\\" and \\"the upcoming album Панихида (English: Requiem) will not feature his voice\\". The following week, the post was taken down and a new post stated that Drabikowski \\"was told earlier this month that he would not participate in Batushka activities as we move into 2019\\" and that any pages operated by him were to be shut down based on a claim \\"based on intellectual property and trademark ownership\\". In a counter-claim, Drabikowski uploaded a video statement claiming that Krysiuk had been pressing him to release the new album and, when he disagreed, Krysiuk then \\"hired musicians to produce an album that he planned to release as the new Batushka record, behind [his] back\\". He also stated that he had taken legal action, being advised by his lawyer to not say anything further and that pictures on the website and Facebook page were of Krysiuk and people like his son pretending to be Batushka. On 6 May 2019, Drabikowski released an update on the court proceedings, stating that the court decided that Bartłomiej Krysiuk cannot tour under the name \\"Batushka\\" or release new music under the moniker until the proceedings are over. Despite the uncertainty of the band's status, tour dates have been committed to from June 2019 and onward. Krysiuk also stated that he had no intention of honoring the court's decision. A month later Krysiuk posted an update where his legal team succeeded in appealing a reversal of the court's decision that forbade him from using the \\"Batushka\\" moniker for touring and merchandising while the case proceeds, however, Drabikowski is still allowed to use the band name in various capacities in spite of Krysiuk's attempts at censoring him through bans and takedowns on Bandcamp and social media. On 13 May 2019, Drabikowski's Batushka released a song through their own YouTube account from their upcoming album Панихида (English: Requiem), called \\"Песнь I\\" (English: Ode 1). On 15 May 2019, Krysiuk's Batushka released the first single through Metal Blade's YouTube account from their upcoming album Господи (English: God Almighty), called \\"Chapter I: The Emptiness – Polunosznica (Полунощница)\\". Their album is scheduled to be released on 12 July 2019. Subsequent music videos were made for the songs \\"Wieczernia\\", \\"Liturgiya\\", \\"Utrenia\\" and \\"Pierwyj Czas\\" but due to backlash from supporters of Drabikowski all music videos had the likes/dislikes and comment sections disabled on YouTube. Posts about Batushka on Metal Blade's Instagram also had their comments disabled. These actions stirred even more fan backlash. On 27 May 2019, Drabikowski's Batushka released a new full-length album called Панихида (\\"Panihida\\") (English: Requiem) and was very well received by both critics and fans alike. On 12 July 2019, Krysiuk's Batushka released a full-length album called Hospodi (English: God Almighty), the album received mixed reviews from critics and was panned by the vast majority of the band's fans, with most of the criticism aimed at their \\"illegitimacy\\" to use the name Batushka. In the wake of the public falling out and ensuing drama between Drabikowski and Krysiuk several parody bands using variations of the \\"Batushka\\" name emerged online as a widespread meme, each also claiming to be the \\"true Batushka\\", the most notable being \\"Batyushka\\" an anonymous project claiming to be from Russia and being actual Orthodox priests and adhering to the Orthodox dogma. Their music is completely instrumental and have independently released over a dozen albums on Bandcamp which were met with indifference and annoyance, as well as mockery from fans of the real band, several people also pointed out how the music uses a drum machine. Despite the public backlash, Krysiuk's version of the band continues to tour and play at various festivals, notably replacing Dimmu Borgir at Bloodstock Open Air. However, most of those shows have been poorly received, reportedly including boos and chants of \\"Krzysztof\\" at a 2018 show in Poland. On September 6, Krysiuk's Batushka uploaded a trailer for a documentary titled \\"Batushka: Uncovering the Truth\\", about the name dispute and the split between Krysiuk and Drabikowski. The announcement was again poorly received by fans, with accusations of Krysiuk trying to sway public opinion in his favor, however, no further updates or a release date have been revealed since the first announcement. Amidst the backlash, Krysiuk's band canceled Australian and North American tours with fellow Polish band Hate. While no official reason was given for the former, Krysiuk later released a statement saying both tours were cancelled due to the costs of the legal battle. Krysiuk later stated the planned European tour would proceed and revealed plans to work on new music, but on January 6, the European tour was announced to be indefinitely postponed due to an unspecified member of Krysiuk's band having to \\"undergo medical treatment\\". All three tours are suspected to have been cancelled due to poor ticket sales. After a prolonged silence, Krzysztof Drabikowski announced on 9 September 2019 that he will be performing Panihida live in its entirety with a new line up at the MonteRay Club in Kyiv on 9 November 2019, the performance was very well received and was reportedly a sold-out event for the venue. Drabikowsky has also expressed his hopes of going on a proper tour in 2020. In late October, several dates were confirmed for Drabikowski's version of the band's European tour, and will take place in 2020, with confirmed dates for 3 January, at the Czech Republic, on the Barrack Club in Ostrava, 4 January, in Austria, at Haufgasse in Vienna, and will also play at Wolfszeit Festival on 27 to 29 August in Germany near the town of Crispendorf. Drabikowski's Batushka also joined Malevolent Creation on their European tour from February to March 2020; the tour was a success with many sold-out venues, however the tour was cut short on March 11, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the band's scheduled performances at Poland were canceled due to safety concerns. On January 19, 2020 it was announced that Drabikowski's Batushka will be also performing at the fifth \\"México Metal Fest\\" at Monterrey on November 14, 2020. It is also confirmed that Drabikowski's Batushka will perform at the Latvian ethnographic and crafts festival Zobens un Lemess on 7 to 9 August held in Bauska castle grounds. ==Members== ;Up until the dispute * Христофор (Krzysztof \\"Derph\\" Drabikowski) – guitars, bass, vocals, drums * Варфоломей (Bartłomiej \\"Bart\\" Krysiuk) – lead vocals ;Former * Мартин (Marcin \\"Beny\\" Bielemiuk) – drums (2015–2018) ;Live members up until the dispute * Błażej Kasprzak – backing vocals (2016–2018) * Черный Монах (Patryk G.) – backing vocals (2016–2018) * Jaca (Jacek Wiśniewski) – backing vocals (2016–2018) * Paluch (Artur Grassmann) – bass (2016–2018) * Wdowa (Paweł Wdowski) – guitars (2016–2018) * P.

He is a fifth- generation bluegrass musician from the Shenandoah Valley and a multi- instrumentalist. He and his wife Martha Hills have performed as the duo Me & Martha since 2005. He is founder of the Shenandoah Music Trail and the first \\"bluegrass church\\". He won first place in dulcimer at the 2017 Old Fiddlers' Convention in Galax, Virginia. He is currently an adjunct professor at Eastern Mennonite University where he teaches all the bluegrass instruments. He and his wife Martha live in the Village of West View in Swoope, Virginia. ==Biography== Donald Allen \\"Don\\" DePoy was born in Harrisonburg, Virginia to Euva Taylor and Carl William DePoy. He is the descendant of four previous generations of bluegrass musicians in the Shenandoah Valley. His grandfather Carl C. DePoy, Emory Stroop, and Herb Smoke were recorded in 1940 by Alan Lomax to be included later in the Folklife Collection at the Library of Congress. DePoy, \\"a hometown farm boy\\", first started performing as a musician at the age of eight. In 1957, DePoy joined his father’s band, the Mountain Music Makers, on the snare drum — later playing banjo and guitar with the group. When DePoy's mother joined her husband and son on stage the band name changed to Carl & Don: The Skyline Pals, who from 1962 to 1979 played community dances, lawn parties, and beer taverns in the Shenandoah Valley and eastern West Virginia. The Skyline Pals started performing a weekly live one- hour radio program on WABH-AM in 1963, later expanding to a two-hour show. The group made their first recording at Ace Recording Studio in Boston, Massachusetts in 1964, called Songs for Mom and Dad. It was released in Europe in 1965, and released in the United States in 1973 (under the Skyline Records label.) As his father served as engineer for a local television and radio station, DePoy grew up in the field. He recalls: DePoy began disc jockeying at 16 while still in high school. Growing up playing bluegrass, combined with his performing and technical experience, made him \\"kind of bound to this kind of work,\\" he believed. After taking a bachelor's degree in \\"radio-television- film\\" at Hampton Institute, DePoy found employment \\"designing education television programs for the Virginia community college system.\\" DePoy graduated from Buffalo Gap High School in Buffalo Gap, Virginia in 1968, where he appeared in the senior play. In 1971 he founded the North Mountain Ramblers, a musical group featuring Herb Smoke (who was recorded by Alan Lomax in 1940). As part of his employment, DePoy moved to the Philadelphia area in 1979. He founded the band Northeast Extension in Perkasie, Pennsylvania in 1986. He moved to Newburgh, Maine in 1989 and then to Belfast, Maine a decade later, where he met his future wife, Martha Hills. In 2000, he began operation of a sailboat charter business during summers named Gafia (for \\"get away from it all\\"). DePoy and Hills started playing music together in Belfast in 2003. They moved back to Virginia in 2007. ===Education=== DePoy graduated from Blue Ridge Community College in Weyers Cave, Virginia with an A.S. degree in Education in June 1970. He received a B.A. in Mass Communications in June 1975 from the Newport News Institute in Newport News, Virginia. In December 1992 he was awarded a B.U.S. degree in Liberal Studies from the University of Maine at Orono, where he later received an M.Ed. in Social Studies Education (May 1994) and a Ph.D. in the cultural context of bluegrass music (December 1996). ===Teaching=== DePoy worked for the Virginia Community College System as a media specialist and lecturer throughout the 1970s, teaching courses in Beginning and Advanced Bluegrass Banjo and Beginning and Advanced Guitar. From 1995 to 2005, DePoy was Assistant Professor at the New England School of Communication in Bangor, Maine, teaching courses in music appreciation, electronic and web page production, desktop publishing, multi-media production, multiculturalism, advertising, and public relations. During the same period, he served at Husson College as graduate and undergraduate adjunct faculty, teaching courses in social science, marketing/public relations, and communication technology. He has taught sociology at the college level in Virginia at James Madison University and Bridgewater College. He serves as adjunct professor at Eastern Mennonite University where he teaches all the bluegrass instruments. === Business === In 1979, DePoy worked in New York City as a design engineer with international design and consulting firm Hubert Wilke, Inc., commuting by train two and a half hours each way to Yardley, Pennsylvania. Tiring of the long commute after a year, he became a television producer and executive in Philadelphia in the early 1980s, starting his own television studio, Teleimage, Inc., in 1981 — which became Philadelphia's second-largest independent television/audio production company. As Project Coordinator/Executive Producer for Goodway Marketing, Inc. in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania between 1984 and 1986, DePoy was responsible for block media buys and syndication for a national marketing holding company with twenty-three separate businesses. DePoy was owner of two Laserset Publishing Centers in the late 1980s in Doylestown and Norristown, Pennsylvania. He was President of D&D; Marketing, Inc. in Orono, Maine from 1989 to 1995. He also published Auntie M's Guide for Bargain Hunters, a bi-monthly publication with a circulation of 10,000 copies distributed throughout the greater Bangor, Maine region. DePoy founded Gafia Sailing Charters in 1999, sailing from Belfast City Harbor in Belfast, Maine aboard the ViVa, a registered National Historic Treasure \\"classic racing yacht\\" launched in 1939. ViVa, a was retired from charter operation in 2007. ==Music== DePoy is a fifth-generation bluegrass musician from the Shenandoah Valley, coming from a musical family dating back to the mid-1700s. The long line of traditional musicians he descends from have been recorded by famed American ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax. DePoy himself has been a professional musician since 1959, mastering bluegrass banjo and the thumb-picking style on guitar. DePoy also plays mountain dulcimer, autoharp, Dobro, mandolin, and the \\"bass fiddle\\". He is a winning instrumentalist at the Old Fiddlers' Convention in Galax, Virginia — a popular and prestigious old- time and bluegrass music festival.Nick Kaye, Celebrating the Sounds of Appalachian Strings. New York Times (July 2, 2009).Matt Bai, The Fallback, New York Times (March 12, 2006). He has performed throughout the U.S., and Europe and has recordings in the Library of Congress like his grandfather. \\"I grew up in a musical family that goes back a long way,\\" DePoy says. \\"It was always there. It's like a language, once it's there you always have it. It's just who I am.\\" Referring to himself as \\"Dr. Bluegrass\\", DePoy has dedicated his life to teaching and preserving the music he plays, which he terms \\"Southern mountain music style of Appalachia\\". He is Executive Director at Shenandoah Valley Mountain Music Makers Association, a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization he founded, along with the Shenandoah Music Trail. In 2011 he organized the Oak Leaf Bluegrass & Mountain Music Festival at Luray Caverns and Luray Valley Museum. The show celebrated the 50th anniversary of the first single-day \\"bluegrass\\" festival held July 4, 1961 — which sparked the thousands of bluegrass festivals that take place around the world today — and featured such first-generation bluegrass acts as The Stanley Brothers and Bill Clifton & The Dixie Mountain Boys,. DePoy served as Executive Director (1993-1997) for F.O.L.K., Inc. (Focus On Local Knowledge) a 501-C-3 not-for-profit corporation chartered to support preservation, dissemination, and education of folk practices, specifically relating to performance and visual arts. F.O.L.K. is publisher of MuseNews, a monthly arts/literature guide. In 2013 he became a certified Pete Wernick Jam Instructor. ===Me & Martha=== DePoy and his wife Martha Hills have been performing together since 2005 as Me & Martha, performing some 250 shows a year. Hills fronts the duo, sings, and plays the upright bass — which DePoy taught her to play. The duo continues the centuries-old music-making tradition of fusing musical genres to create a fresh approach to the music. Me & Martha see themselves as keepers of the flame of Americana rural roots mountain music, which includes American fiddle/banjo traditions, old-time string band, sea shanties, work songs, hillbilly, traditional and classic country, bluegrass, rural swing, and contemporary folk ballads. They perform on mountain dulcimer, 5-string banjo, autoharp, guitar, Dobro, mandolin, and bass fiddle. Me & Martha are members of America’s Old-Time Country Music Hall of Fame and are on the artist rosters of the Virginia Commission for the Arts and Young Audiences of Virginia as traditional musicians. In 2012, they played 212 concerts, hosted 34 weekly Tuesday night bluegrass jams at James Madison University, participated in a number of community service events, and worked tirelessly on the Shenandoah Music Trail, an organization they founded. === Shenandoah Music Trail === DePoy and his wife organized the nonprofit Shenandoah Music Trail, which maps out different major venues, trail stops, historic locations, festivals and jam sessions from Winchester down to Roanoke focusing on bluegrass, old-time string band, blues, rural swing, and classic country music. According to their mission, the Shenandoah Music Trail \\"is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, all volunteer, Virginia-based corporation whose mission is to preserve, promote and celebrate the music traditions of the Shenandoah Valley by bringing together musicians, venues and audiences.\\" DePoy and Hills work with local towns and communities to create economic opportunities from the region’s cultural capital to better advance the community’s economic development efforts through social entrepreneurship and niche marketing opportunities. The Shenandoah Music Trail is sponsored in part by the Virginia Commission for the Arts, the National Council for the Arts, and Virginia Tourism Corporation — to promote the Shenandoah Valley’s musicians, historical events, festivals, and live music venues. === WestView Community Place === When DePoy and Hills moved back to the area where he'd grown up in September 2017, they moved into his parent's former house just down the street from the West View United Methodist Church, where they'd hoped to worship. They discovered the church had closed. With the building sitting vacant for some months, DePoy called the Methodist dioceses and ask what could be done. As to how they got a \\"bluegrass church\\" going, Hills explains: They've been holding monthly bluegrass jams, known as Bluegrass Spirit Jams, at the once-vacant church since February 2018. The aim of these sessions is \\"to celebrate God’s presence, communicate God’s love and to honor the rich music heritage of the Shenandoah Valley.\\" As Hill states, \\"It is here diversity of talents and gifts are not only invited but encouraged through fellowship and bluegrass music.\\" She adds, \\"It's a non-traditional church, it's unconventional.\\" The Bluegrass Spirit Jams are an extension of the work they were doing as live performers. Touring around the country as Me & Martha, doing 250 or so shows a year, people often encouraged DePoy and Hills after shows to keep doing their \\"ministry.\\" As DePoy describes it, \\"People would comment, 'We love your spirit and hope you continue your ministry.' Ministry? We were just being ourselves and playing music. We were not doing ministry. That’s what preachers do.\\" But he did see that their music was bringing people together on common ground and, \\"Anytime you gather people together in fellowship, wherever, not necessarily in a building, that (sic) you're in church.\\" DePoy adds, \\"A church brings people together.\\" == Recordings == DePoy is a featured performer on eleven recordings and four anthologies of traditional American music. Me & Martha CDs comprise: * On the Road Home (2005) * Porch Picking CD (2007) * Soul Searching CD (2008) * Whispering Pines (2013) == Performance == In addition to performance in thousands of live shows, club, house concerts, festival performances, and workshops throughout the United States (1959 – present), DePoy appearances include: * WABH-AM one-hour weekly \\"live\\" Mountain Music Show (1963-1967). * Mountain Heritage Craft and Music Festival (1974-1977). * Philadelphia Folk Festival (1987 and 1988). * Gettysburg Bluegrass Festival (1988 and 1989). * American Cowgirls, a bluegrass music play (1992). *Bulgarian National Television segment (1992). *Bulgarian National Radio segment (1992). * Roots & Branches, a bluegrass play (1999). * Schooner Days, Camden, Maine (2000 and 2001). * Joe Val Bluegrass Festival, Framingham, Massachusetts (2005, 2006, 2007). * Shenandoah Valley Music Festival (2012, 2013). * Featured performer Red Barn Radio Show, Lexington, Kentucky (2015). == Publication == * “Cultural Context of Bluegrass Music: Preference, Familiarity & Stereotypes.” PhD. dissertation, Orono, ME: University of Maine (1996). * _Music Maker’s Guide_ , Lulu Press: Morrisville, NC (2007) * _Songs to Lift the Spirit_ , Lulu Press: Morrisville, NC (2008) * \\"Along the Shenandoah Music Trail\\", _Americana Rhythm_ monthly publication (2011–15) * _Music Maker’s Guide_ , 2nd Edition, Lulu Press: Morrisville, NC (2012) * _Music Maker’s Guide_ , 3rd Edition, Lulu Press: Morrisville, NC (2018) == Presentation == * Enhancing one’s life through music making (presentation) 23rd Annual Pacific Rim Conference on Disabilities, Waikiki, HI (2007) * Music Making Workshop (presentation), Blue Ridge Community College Folk Life Festival, Weyers Cave, VA (2007) * Featured Speaker, Bridgewater College Speakers Bureau, Bridgewater, Virginia Appalachian Square & Round Dances, Bluegrass for Parents & Children, Roots Music History, Sharing Maine’s Coast, Bridgewater College, Bridgewater, VA (2008) * Washington, DC’s role in preserving the folk music of the Shenandoah Valley: 1940 to present, Historical Society, Washington, DC (2008) * Music Making in the Shenandoah Valley: Status of oral transmission practices.

Beare began working as a journalist for The Miami News before fully committing to the fledgeling feminist movement in Florida. She was hired as a lobbyist by NOW in an effort to pass the Equal Rights Amendment and worked to fight instances of job and insurance discrimination. Beare was invited to the Third and Fourth World Conference on Women in 1985 and 1995. She was inducted into the Florida Women's Hall of Fame in 1994. ==Early life== Muriel Nikki Brink was born on March 7, 1928, in Detroit, Michigan, as the only daughter of parents Stanley and Dorothy Brink. She also had one younger brother named Stanley Jr. Her father was a basketball player and her mother worked so she was raised by housekeepers. Growing up, she attended Noble Grade School, Tappan Intermediate, and Cass Technical High School. She graduated from Cass Technical High School in 1946 and married Richard A. Beare. Their daughter Sandra was born in 1947. ==Career== The family moved to Islamorada, a village in the Florida Keys, in 1956 where she wrote for the Key West Citizen newspaper before moving to Miami. In 1962, Beare published a book titled From turtle soup to coconuts; a gourmet guide to good eating and restaurants on the Florida Keys. In 1968, Beare was inspired by American feminist Roxcy Bolton to help found the Florida chapter of National Organization for Women (NOW). While working as a Women’s Page reporter for the Miami News, Beare was elected vice-president of the Florida NOW. After leaving journalism to tackle feminism, she convinced The Miami Herald to eliminate the gendered newspaper classifieds sections. She was later named president of Florida's NOW chapter after Martha Ingle resigned. In 1970, Beare helped Gwen Cherry, Dade County’s first female black attorney, get elected to the Florida House of Representatives as well as helped Elaine Gordon get elected as a Democrat legislator from Dade County. As part of her job with NOW, Beare prepared workshops for women to educate them on how to lobby and interact with lawmakers. In 1975, NOW hired Beare as a lobbyist to help pass the Equal Rights Amendment. She also began her own feminist newspaper titled \\"Women's Almanac\\" which ran from 1975 to 1985. That same year, Beare began her own public relations company called \\"Nikki Beare and Associates Inc. In 1976, Beare worked with the Florida Insurance Task Force to fight against instances of discrimination based on gender. She teamed up with Gordon, now an established state legislator, to start a statewide feminist credit union. This was a response to banks refusing to loan money to young women on the basis of sex. She also worked with Gordon and Elaine Bloom, who also became a legislator, on WKAT Radio with a feminist radio show titled \\"Women's Powerline\\". In 1978, Beare served as Vice President of the Women's Business Council of Dade County and later she served on NOW's Advisory Board for the National Women's Political Caucas. In 1980, Beare earned her Bachelor of Arts from Skidmore College where she focused on Women in Nineteenth Century American Culture. As a member of NOW in the 1980s, Beare helped form a Women's International News Service, and lobbied for women's rights such as childbirth or adoption unpaid leave. In 1985 and 1995, Beare was invited to the United Nations World Conference on Women. Starting in 1988, Beare worked as a lobbyist for the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) to fight against travel fraud. In 1992, after Hurricane Andrew, she moved to Havana, Florida where she and her daughter Sandra were charter members of the Gadsden County Domestic and Sexual Violence Task Force. She also worked with Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth on the Florida Commission on the Status of Women. In 1994, Beare was inducted into the Florida Women's Hall of Fame. The next year, she was elected vice president for policy planning in the Florida Women's Political Caucus. She further continued her activism work by serving as a chairwoman of the National Committee on Travel for Persons With Disabilities of ASTA. Through her work with ASTA, Beare helped introduce the Travel Agency Fair Treatment Act and lobbyied to protect travel agent services from increased taxes. She also worked to end travel scamming. In 1996, Beare and Sandra opened an antique store and later a book shop. Her family also ran a Blueberry picking farm called \\"Beare’s Berries.\\" However, in 2005, Beare returned to journalism and worked as the Gadsden County correspondent for the Tallahassee Democrat; a position she kept until 2011. Beare died on November 10, 2014, in Tallahassee. ==Publications== List of publications: *From turtle soup to coconuts; a gourmet guide to good eating and restaurants on the Florida Keys.

She currently lives Atlanta, Georgia. She is the mother of two children. Her work revolves around the evolving identity of African Americans throughout history, especially African-American women. Davis Johnson's work has shown in numerous exhibitions including the Delta Exhibition at Arkansas Arts Center in Little Rock, Arkansas, Texarkana Regional Arts Center in Texarkana, Texas, and Baton Rouge Center for Contemporary Art in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Her pieces can be seen in galleries and private collections throughout the United States. == Early life == Angela Davis Johnson was born in Orlando, Florida. She and her family later moved to Virginia, where she attended Governor's School for the Arts, an art magnet school in Norfolk, Virginia. Davis Johnson's interest in art began at a young age. She was first inspired to create art by her mother, who had returned to school for fashion design when Angela was 4 and would share what she had learned with Angela and her siblings. When Angela was 14, she, along with her mother and three siblings, were evicted from their home in Norfolk and moved to Lambrook, Arkansas. Despite being impoverished, her mother encouraged Angela and her siblings to embrace and explore their creativity through singing songs, reading, and whittling, and would purchase art supplies. == Style == A self-taught artist, Davis Johnson explores \\"universal connections, identity and historical occurrences through personal symbols\\" in her work. Davis Johnson's work addresses several issues facing black women including trauma, domestic violence, poverty, gentrification, state-sanctioned violence, the silencing of black women, and displacement. When asked what she hoped people will take away from her body of work, she responded: > I want people to feel the complexity of the embodied experience of black > womenhood.

He was also affiliated with Johns Hopkins University as a research professor. He was a prolific researcher, conducting many studies on anti-psychotics, early research on the treatment of alcoholics using psychedelics and making integral contributions to the research unit at the Spring Grove State Hospital. == Early life == Kurland was born June 29, 1914, in Edwardsville, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania to parents who had emigrated from the border region of Poland and Belarus. He moved to Baltimore and lived with other relatives as a teenager, completing his diploma at City College Baltimore in 1932. Kurland completed his medical degree at the University of Maryland Medical School in 1940 and afterwards served as an assistant battalion surgeon under General Patton in World War II. Under Patton, Kurland encountered gruesome physical and psychological suffering among soldiers. He received a Legion of Merit medal for his valor.Taylor, Bruce T. (2007). Obituary. Albert Kurland. American College of Neuropsychopharmacology. Kurland explained that his combat experiences motivated him to engage in neuropsychiatric medicine: > Well, I saw in combat an awful lot of stress. I saw a lot of stress > reactions. I saw troops killed by friendly fire, and then the troopers shoot > themselves. I saw all kinds of dreadful things….[So] I'd like to go to a > neuropsychiatric unit if possible to learn something about this situation, > and maybe, I might be able to find ways and means of being helpful in this > areas.Hollister, Leo H. (1997). \\"Oral History with Albert Kurland\\". The > Betsy Gordon Psychoactive Substances Research Collection. == Post-war developments == Kurland received neuropsychiatric training at Mason General Hospital and then received a Fellowship in Neuropsychiatric Research at Sinai Hospital in East Baltimore while also working part-time at the Veterans' Administration. Following these positions, Kurland arrived at Spring Grove State Hospital in 1946. At this time the hospital had roughly 2,700 patients and 23 psychiatrists. The physician-patient ratio was not conducive one on one doctor:patient consultations, and this motivated Kurland to explore new methods of treatment. In his spare time and without funding from Spring Grove, he began to explore the use of Thorazine (chlorpromazine) in psychiatric experiments. By the mid-1950s, Kurland's efforts were recognized by Charles Savage and Lou Cholden at the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH). With his research opportunities increasing, Kurland founded Friends of Psychiatric Research to coordinate additional funding for, and to simplify the administration of, his research. Soon afterwards he was promoted to Director of Research at Spring Grove in 1953.Center for the Study of the History of Neuropsychopharmocology He also received increasing support from Gene Brody at the University of Maryland and Joel Elkes at Johns Hopkins University at about this time. With additional funding from the state of Maryland, Kurland and his colleagues launched the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center. As he conducted his research, Kurland founded the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, of which he was the first director. The Center was built with $1.5 million of funding from state of Maryland in 1967. Ten years after his appointment to the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, Kurland was appointed to Research Associate in Psychiatry at the University of Maryland Medical School, in January 1977. The Center continues to operate today with eight active research programs, including neuroscience, neuroimaging research, and the Maryland Brain Collection program. Kurland also served as a Research Professor at Johns Hopkins University. Near the end of his career, Kurland suggested that developments in psychotropic drugs alone were not sufficient to help individuals grow to their full capacity: > There's much to be done but I think it will be done in the future, because > we know the limitations of the drugs we're using today. We treat a panic > disorder, we treat alcoholism, we treat depression, and we ameliorate the > symptoms, but what are we doing so far that is adding to the individual's > capacity for development? Kurland's concern for the “individual's capacity for development” can be placed alongside the description that Kurland, “never said an unkind word about anyone.” == Contributions to neuropsychopharmocology == Kurland published over 150 studies in the fields of psychiatry, in particular, neuropsychopharmacology. The figure shown at right presents the frequency of Kurland's published research by different treatment modalities. Treemap of the frequency of Kurland's published articles. === Research with LSD === With Cholden and Savage, Kurland published his first peer reviewed research on psychedelics in 1955.Cholden, L., Kurland A., Savage, C. (1955) Clinical Reactions and Tolerance to LSD in Chronic SchizophreniaJournal of Nervous and Mental Disorders. Entitled \\"Clinical reactions and tolerance to LSD in chronic schizophrenia,\\" the study sought to ascertain reactions to LSD among “chronic, regressed, schizophrenic patients” so that results could be compared to earlier research that described reactions of LSD among other subjects. This information was preliminary to the study's second aim, which was to examine the clinical and therapeutic potential of LSD. The research team also sought to replicate research conducted by Abram Hoffer and Humphrey Osmond who had done earlier LSD research in Canada beginning in 1952. Dyck, Ericka. (1965) Flashback: Psychiatric Experimentation with LSD in Historical Perspective. Canadian Journal of Psychiatry 50(7). Kurland's work with Cholden and Savage predated their efforts in the subsequent Spring Grove experiment. Unlike previous research on LSD, Kurland and his peers administered LSD intramuscularly, providing better control of dosing patients who often did not swallow oral doses completely. The team also took steps to allow patients to adjust to new research settings such that any reactions to LSD would be independent of reactions associated with environmental change. Kurland and his colleagues found that reactions to LSD in the regressed schizophrenic subjects had at least three types: (1) covert reactions, in which no striking behavioral change was observed (e.g. patients became withdrawn), (2) intensified reactions, in which subjects presented increased agitation, anxiety or delusion and (3) reversed reactions, in which behaviors changed dramatically from what was typical (e.g. hostile patients became friendly). This research also found that tolerance to LSD was not entirely psychological in nature because cross-tolerance with brom-lysergic acid was present while cross-tolerance with mescaline was negative. Finally, the team provided observations of how much time was required before larger doses of LSD were necessary to have the same impact as an initial dose. Kurland's research at Spring Grove was not unique. According to Dyck's analysis, there were at least 100 articles on LSD by 1951, over 500 by the end of the 1950s, and ten years later there were more than 1000. However, Kurland and his team developed a research program that was the most ambitious and longstanding of its kind. According to one of Kurland's subsequent co-authors: > The body of research that emerged from these 23 years of study [at Spring > Grove] remains the largest, most sustained and systematic research into > therapeutic use of psychedelic drugs and psychotherapy yet attempted.Yensen, > Richard (2007) Addiction, Despair and the Soul in Psychedelic Medicine > (Praeger). Kurland's 1955 research on LSD paused until the 1960s when Sanford Unger arrived at Spring Grove. Unger was a psychologist from Hollywood Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia. By 1963, Kurland was collaborating with Unger and Charles Savage in renewed research, examining the efficacy of LSD in treating alcoholics and subsequently cancer patients. Kurland's continued research on LSD in the 1960s and 1970s was complicated by the “moral panic” the general population had about the drug as well as by increased regulations for medical research. Additionally, LSD research posed methodological complications in observing the drug's effects on treatment and control groups. While the standard in medical research was a double-blind study, the effects of LSD were obvious to investigators. For these reasons, LSD research waned by the late 1970s. Today, however, research on the efficacy of psychedelics continues. === Research on antipsychotic compounds === Kurland published with various colleagues nearly 50 studies on antipsychotics, beginning with his study of chlorpromazine (Thorazine) in 1955. Chlorpromazine had been shown to have useful applications by French psychiatrists Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker, and then in Canada under research directed by Heinz Lehmann. Kurland's first chlorpromazine study (1955) was conducted concurrently with research underway by Joel Elkes, who was examining the substance in 1954 from Birmingham, England. Kurland's research on the effectiveness of antipsychotics addressed numerous diseases, including schizophrenia, addiction, psychosis and other acute psychiatric illnesses. === Research on antidepressants === Kurland published 14 articles on antidepressant medications, including nialamide, aletamine, dilantin, amoxapine among others. His later research included studies that aided the development of buproprion. === Other research === Among his published research, Kurland analyzed a variety of other clinical treatments for depression, addiction, anxiety and other diseases. His investigations of haloanisone, pyridoxine, and perphenazine-benztropine mesylate, are examples of the broad range of compounds that Kurland studied while his focus on other antipsychotics and psychedelics continued. Even more publications evidence Kurland's examination of general topics in psychiatry not directly related to clinical treatments, but describe appropriate admission procedures for psychiatric patients or the role of patients' general practitioners. Kurland's attempts to observe the human condition were not limited to traditional research methodology common in medical science. While he typically utilized standard methodological protocols in his published work, he also considered phenomena that did not easily fit within the quantitative, positivist perspectives common in medical research. For example, as described by his former colleague Stanislav Grof, Kurland invited Joan Grant and Dennys Kelsey, European therapists who used hypnotic therapy to assist patients uncover past lives, to a symposium to inform research on the compound. ==References== == External links == *The Betsy Gordon Psychoactive Substances Research Collection *The Maryland Psychiatric Research Center Category:Baltimore City College alumni Category:University of Maryland School of Medicine alumni Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:Psychopharmacologists Category:1914 births Category:2008 deaths Category:People from Luzerne County, Pennsylvania ","title":"Albert Kurland"},{"id":"60310620","text":"The 1921–22 season was the 21st season of competitive football played by Cardiff City F.C. and the team's first in the First Division of The Football League. Cardiff had won promotion to the highest tier of English football the previous season by finishing as runners-up in the Second Division, becoming the first Welsh team to reach the top tier of English football. The side endured a difficult start to the season, losing the first six matches of the campaign. However, they eventually saw results improve and finished the campaign in fourth place. In the FA Cup, Cardiff reached the fourth round before being defeated by Tottenham Hotspur after a replay. Cardiff went on to win the Welsh Cup for the third time in its history after defeating Ton Pentre in the final. During the campaign, 31 players made at least one appearance for the club. Billy Grimshaw made more appearances than any other player, featuring in 47 matches in all competitions. Len Davies finished the season as the club's highest goalscorer with 30 in all competitions. His tally of seventeen in the First Division was three short of Jimmy Gill but fourteen in cup matches, including eight in four appearances in the Welsh Cup, saw him out score his teammate. The highest attendance recorded at Ninian Park was 51,000 for the FA Cup fourth round tie against Tottenham Hotspur. However, the league fixture against Tottenham recorded an attendance of 50,000 after an extra 6-10,000 were estimated to have broken into the ground after turnstiles were closed. The lowest attendance recorded was 5,500 for Welsh Cup matches against Newport County and Merthyr Town. The average league attendance during the season was 27,000. ==Background and preseason== During the 1920–21 season, Cardiff City were elected into the Second Division of The Football League having spent the previous decade playing in the Southern Football League. In the side's first season, they finished as runners-up behind Birmingham on goal average after the two teams accumulated the same number of points. As a result, Cardiff won promotion to the First Division, becoming the first Welsh side to play in the top tier of English football. Manager Fred Stewart remained in charge of the first team for the tenth year. He made several additions to the squad, signing full back Tommy Brown arrived from New Brighton and forward Willie Page, the brother of Cardiff defender Jack Page, from Port Vale. Cardiff were investigated by The Football Association (FA) and the Football Association of Wales (FAW) over an illegal approach for Wolverhampton Wanderers defender Dickie Baugh Jr.. The club was found guilty with Baugh having signed an agreement with an agent acting on behalf of Cardiff despite still being contracted to Wolves. Cardiff were fined £50 and Baugh £20. The agent involved was subsequently banned from all football grounds under the jurisdictions of either the FA or FAW. Cardiff also made significant investments in the club's ground Ninian Park. A new pitch was laid using sea-washed turf which officials at the club labelled as \\"now being equal to the best in the country\\". The earthen embankments that enclosed the pitch were also built up to improve viewing for spectators. Having won promotion and reached the semifinal of the FA Cup, The Times expected Cardiff to adapt well to the higher tier. ==First Division== In the team's first match in the First Division, they met FA Cup holders Tottenham Hotspur at Ninian Park. The game therefore became the first top tier match in English football to be played in Wales and was described in The Times as \\"the most important event in their (Cardiff's) history\\". The fixture attracted a large crowd and when 50,000 supporters had paid and been allowed into the ground officials attempted to close the gates. However, with thousands still queuing to gain entry, supporters broke through the gates and forced their way into the ground. Club officials estimated between an extra 6-10,000 people broke into the ground after the gates were initially closed. Cardiff started the season without influential defender Jimmy Blair; Jack Page starting the opening match in his place. Tottenham received a blow early into the game as Jimmy Seed picked up an injury. Despite the setback, Tottenham proved too strong for Cardiff and scored the only goal of the game through Jimmy Banks from outside the penalty area. The excessive crowd numbers produced several unsavoury incidents which included fans taking over the score board to use as a vantage point. This experience prompted the club to approach local police to seek advice on crowd control at future matches. Defeat to Tottenham was the start of a difficult beginning in the First Division for the club. Defender Bert Smith became the first player to score for Cardiff in the division in the side's following match with a consolation goal during a 2–1 defeat to Astin Villa. Cardiff met Tottenham in the reverse fixture five days later but, having proven a stubborn opponent for the more experienced side in the first meeting, they were soundly beaten after conceding three goals in the opening 30 minutes of the match. The game finished 4–1 to Tottenham with The Times describing victory for the London-based side as \\"a very easy matter\\". A 4–0 defeat in the reverse fixture against Aston Villa followed, prompting manager Fred Stewart to make changes to his side ahead of back-to-back fixtures against Oldham Athletic. Blair returned to action having missed the first four matches and goalkeeper Herbert Kneeshaw was dropped in favour of Ben Davies. Billy Hardy, who had been ever present the previous season, was also left out due to injury along with forward George West. The changes yielded little reward as Cardiff lost both fixtures against Oldham, 1–0 at home, 2–1 away, starting the campaign with six consecutive defeats which left them bottom of the table. Cardiff's next fixture was against unbeaten league leaders Middlesbrough in a match that was described as \\"The most noteworthy example of disparity of strength between contesting clubs\\". In a surprising turn of form, Cardiff recorded its first victory in the First Division after causing an upset to win 3–1. Jimmy Gill who had been the club's top scorer the previous season scored his first goals of the campaign with a brace and Harry Nash added a third. The victory prompted an upturn in fortune for the team as they lost only one of their five matches in October, a 2–1 defeat to Bolton Wanderers. Gill enjoyed a fine run of form during this time, scoring six goals in the five matches including braces during victories over West Bromwich Albion and Bolton in the reverse fixture. With the club struggling for goals, October also saw the arrival of Joe Clennell from Everton for £1,500. In an attempt to recoup some of the transfer fee, two forwards who had played an integral role in promotion in the 1920–21 season, Arthur Cashmore and Fred Pagnam, were sold having failed to score in a combined 17 appearances. Back-to-back fixtures against Manchester City at the start of November yielded only a point for Cardiff after losing 2–0 at home and drawing 1–1 away. However, two victories against Everton later in the month proved a turning point in the season for Cardiff. The departure of Pagnam allowed Len Davies to make his first appearances of the season, scoring all three of Cardiff's goals in 2–1 and 1–0 victories. The second fixture also saw Hardy and Smith return after injury layoffs. A remarkable run of form ensued with Cardiff losing only one of their following thirteen league matches led by the goals of Davies, Gill and Clennell. Davies also scored the first hat-trick in The Football League by a Cardiff player during a 6–3 victory over Bradford City on 21 January 1922. As well as Bradford, the team's run included wins over Birmingham (twice), Arsenal, Preston North End, Blackburn Rovers and Chelsea. The Times described the team during this time as appearing \\"almost invincible\\" as their improved form lifted them to sixth in the table. The team's victory over Blackburn during this spell saw an unusual debutant when club trainer George Latham was forced into action. Hours before the game was due to start, Gill and Evans both went down with sickness and only one player, Nash, had travelled in reserve. Latham, who had played professionally previously, stepped in and became the oldest player in the club's history at 41 years old. On 25 February, Cardiff suffered its first defeat since early December, losing 1–0 to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge as the opposition defence proved impregnable. The team recovered to beat Sheffield United 2–0 in their following match with goals from Clennell and Ken MacDonald but suffered a further blow after losing 1–0 to struggling Bradford who were 21st in the table. Two matches against reigning First Division champions Burnley produced positive results as the team's drew 1–1 before Cardiff won the reverse fixture 4–2 at Ninian Park. Len Davies scored a brace with Gill and Jack Evans scoring one each. Cardiff repeated the pattern in its following two matches against Newcastle United, drawing away before Len Davies scored the only goal in a home victory. Despite taking the lead early in the match, Cardiff suffered a 5–1 defeat to league leaders Liverpool on 15 April. Two days later, they lost heavily again in a 3–1 defeat to Blackburn. They met Liverpool in the reverse fixture on 22 April, with their opponents already having secured the First Division title, winning 2–0. Cardiff finished the season with consecutive draws against Sheffield United and Manchester United before beating the then relegated Manchester again in the final game.

Cardiff won the match 4–1, following a brace from Len Davies and one each from Nash and Clennell, and were praised for a \\"very brilliant performance\\". In the second round, the team was drawn against Third Division side Southampton who they had defeated in the third round the previous year. The lower ranked side held Cardiff to a 1–1 draw at The Dell but goals from Gill and Clennell in the replay sent Cardiff through in a 2–0 victory. The side met Second Division leaders Nottingham Forest in the third round. Len Davies scored his second brace in the competition to lead the side to a 4–1 victory in front of over 50,000 spectators at Ninian Park. Their victory led to a fourth round meeting with cup holders Tottenham Hotspur. The match was hotly anticipated, being described by The Times as \\"the greatest of the day\\". Over 50,000 fans again attended Ninian Park for the tie and despite Cardiff having the better of the first half, Tottenham took the lead through Jimmy Seed after the forward dribbled through the defence to finish past Ben Davies with a powerful shot. Cardiff pressed for the remainder of the match with Billy Grimshaw, Gill and Clennell all going close. As the match entered the final minute, Len Davies was able to turn the ball into the net to salvage a replay for Cardiff. The replay was held at Tottenham's ground White Hart Lane and such was the demand for tickets, match officials agreed for spectators to be allowed to sit or kneel to the very edge of the pitch. Tottenham enjoyed the brighter start to the match but Cardiff took the lead when Jack Evans beat his man on the wing and crossed for Gill to convert. In the second half, Tottenham continued to attack and were rewarded with an equaliser when Jimmy Dimmock headed in from a corner. Tottenham went on to score a second when Ben Davies failed to clear a cross and the ball fell to Charlie Wilson who scored the winning goal. The goal was controversial as Cardiff players complained that goalkeeper Davies had been taken out as he attempted to deal with the cross but the referee ignored their complaints and the goal stood. Tottenham advanced to the semifinal where they lost 2–1 to Preston North End. ===Match results=== ;Key *In result column, Cardiff City's score shown first *H = Home match *A = Away match *pen. = Penalty kick *o.g. = Own goal ;Results { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" - ! scope=colDate ! scope=colRound ! scope=colOpponents ! scope=colResult ! scope=col class=unsortableGoalscorers ! scope=colAttendance -  7 January 1922  First ! scope=row Manchester United (A)  align=center  4–1  L.

A strong Cardiff side ultimately proved far too strong for Newport as the match ended 7–0 with Len Davies scoring four, Grimshaw two and Keenor one. The side continued their free-scoring form in the following round where the defeat Meryhyr Town where Len Davies scored a hat-trick during a 5–0 win. In the semifinal, they were drawn against Pontypridd who had eliminated them from the competition the previous year. Keenor, Gill and Jack Evans each scored once to secure a 3–0 victory and send Cardiff through to the final. Ton Pentre were their opponents as Cardiff secured their third Welsh Cup title after winning 2–0 at Taff Vale Park. Gill and Len Davies each scored once, Davies' goal was his eighth in the competition. ===Match results=== ;Key *In result column, Cardiff City's score shown first *H = Home match *A = Away match *pen. = Penalty kick *o.g. = Own goal ;Results { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" - ! scope=colDate ! scope=colRound ! scope=colOpponents ! scope=colResult ! scope=col class=unsortableGoalscorers ! scope=colAttendance -  18 January 1922  Third ! scope=row Newport County (H)  align=center  7–1  Keenor, Grimshaw (2), L.

Billy Grimshaw made the most appearances of any Cardiff player during the season, featuring in 47 matches in all competitions. He also made the most league appearances with 38. Jack Evans was the next highest with 44 appearances and a further five players made 40 or more appearances. Goalkeeper Tom Farquharson made a single appearance in the final match of the season. He would go on to set a club record for appearances in The Football League with 445 that stood until 1985 when it was surpassed by Phil Dwyer. Farquharson was one of six players who featured in just one match for the club during the campaign. The others included Albert Barnett, who was recovering from a broken leg suffered the previous season, and George Latham, the club's trainer who played one match during an injury crisis. At the age of 41, Latham remains the oldest player ever to feature in a competitive fixture for Cardiff. Two of the players, Ernie Anderson and James Melville, never played another match for Cardiff before moving on. Len Davies was the club's top goalscorer with 30 goals in all competitions. Although he scored three less than Jimmy Gill in league competition, his prolific scoring in cup competitions saw him outscore his teammate. Davies and Gill were two of the three players to score ten or more goals for Cardiff during the season, the third being Joe Clennell. Eleven players scored at least one goal during the course of the season and one opposition player scored an own goal. ===Player statistics=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" - !rowspan=2 style=\\"width:20em\\"scope=colPlayer !rowspan=2Position !colspan=2 style=\\"width:10em\\"scope=colFirst Division !colspan=2 style=\\"width:10em\\"scope=colFA Cup !colspan=2 style=\\"width:10em\\"scope=colWelsh Cup !colspan=2 style=\\"width:10em\\"scope=colTotal - !style=\\"width:5em\\"Apps !style=\\"width:5em\\"Goals !style=\\"width:5em\\"Apps !style=\\"width:5em\\"Goals !style=\\"width:5em\\"Apps !style=\\"width:5em\\"Goals !style=\\"width:5em\\"Apps !style=\\"width:5em\\"Goals - ! scope=rowErnie Anderson HB 10000010 - ! scope=rowAlbert Barnett DF 10000010 - ! scope=rowJimmy Blair DF 3206030410 - ! scope=rowCharlie Brittain DF 2701040320 - ! scope=rowTommy Brown DF 20000020 - ! scope=rowArthur Cashmore FW 40000040 - ! scope=rowJoe Clark FW 10200030 - ! scope=rowJoe Clennell FW 321063204013 - ! scope=rowBen Davies GK 3406030430 - ! scope=rowLen Davies FW 251765483530 - ! scope=rowHerbie Evans HB 2906040390 - ! scope=rowJack Evans FW 3614041442 - ! scope=rowSidney Evans FW 40001050 - ! scope=rowTom Farquharson GK 10000010 - ! scope=rowJimmy Gill FW 342054324226 - ! scope=rowBilly Grimshaw FW 3866032478 - ! scope=rowBilly Hardy HB 3216020401 - ! scope=rowEddie Jenkins HB 90000090 - ! scope=rowFred Keenor DF 2711032313 - ! scope=rowHerbert Kneeshaw GK 70001080 - ! scope=rowGeorge Latham HB 10000010 - ! scope=rowKen MacDonald FW 42000042 - ! scope=rowJames Melville DF 10000010 - ! scope=rowHarry Nash FW 811121113 - ! scope=rowJimmy Nelson DF 20000020 - ! scope=rowBilly Newton HB 10000010 - ! scope=rowJack Nock FW 20000020 - ! scope=rowJack Page DF 2106010280 - ! scope=rowFred Pagnam FW 1300000130 - ! scope=rowBert Smith DF 2914040371 - ! scope=rowGeorge West FW 41000041 - } FW = Forward, HB = Halfback, GK = Goalkeeper, DF = Defender Sources: ==Aftermath== Brown and Willie Page, the two signings made at the start of the 1921–22 campaign, would both depart after a single season with only Brown having played for the first-team. Such was Stewart's confidence in his side that the club made no major signings prior to the start of the following season and only a poor run of form toward the end of 1922 prompted the arrival of a small number of players. As a result of the team's performance, they were regarded as an established side for the 1922–23 season with The Times describing the side as possessing \\"undeniable all-round ability\\" in its preseason report. ==References== Specific Bibliography * * * Category:Cardiff City F.C. seasons Cardiff ","title":"1921–22 Cardiff City F.C. season"},{"id":"60310622","text":"Montgomery Creek is a stream in the U.S. state of Georgia.

After finishing a doctorate of medical studies in 1819 at the Paris School of Medicine, he devoted his life to the study of mental health. He founded a nursing home on the heights of Montmartre, where he took up again principles of a treatment developed by Philippe Pinel, but had his patients keep in touch with a new family instead of isolating them from others. Doctor Blanche counted Nerval and Gounod among his many patients. In 1826, he moved his Montmartre institution to the Hotel of Lamballe (l’Hôtel de Lamballe) in Passy; the building and its grounds belonged to the Princess of Lamballe. After his death, his son Émile Blanche, the father of painter Jacques-Émile Blanche, took over the management of his nursing home, which he kept until 1872. Guy de Maupassant, the French writer, stayed there during the last months of his life (1892-1893), at the clinic of Doctor Blanche. A member of The Medical Board of Association of Dramatic Artists, he was awarded the Legion of Honor (la Légion d’honneur) in 1834. He married Marie, Madeleine, Sophie Bertrand (1800-1876). His daughter Claire became the wife of architect Léon Ohnet and the mother of writer Georges Ohnet. He was also the father of Alfred, born in 1823 and an architect in Paris, and Émile Blanche, born in 1829 and a French psychiatrist. He was buried at the 2nd section of Passy Cemetery. ==Posterity== A street in Paris (la rue du Docteur Blanche) was named after him. Another street with the same name, in Rouen, owes its name to doctor Antoine Emmanuel Pascal Blanche. ==Books== * Du danger des rigueurs corporelles dans le traitement de la folie (On the danger of physical rigors when treating insanity), Paris, Gardembas, 1839 * De l’état actuel de traitement de la folie en France (On the current treatment of insanity in France), Paris, Gardembas, 1840 ==See also== ===Bibliography=== *Georges-Paul Collet, Jacques-Émile Blanche.

It is located in the southwestern part of the municipality of Candelaria. To the north, it borders the village of San Joaquín; on the south, with the municipality of Puerto Tejada (Cauca), on the east, with the villages of Buchitolo and Cabuyal; and for the west, with the municipality of Cali, whose natural limit is the Cauca River. Its relief is completely flat, on the fertile valley of the Cauca river. 90% of its population belongs to the Afro-descendant ethnic community. Many people from this village work for the sugarcane mills of Valle del Cauca. This ethnic community has been strongly impacted by the environmental liabilities generated by the sugarcane agroindustry. == History of Tiple == El Tiple, formerly called \\"Amor Chiquito\\" (Little Love) was colonized in the late 1800s. The first inhabitants were located in what is known today as Tiple Abajo. Great families coming from Jamundí, families that until today are conserved as the Saldañas and Los Valencias. Very organized clans, conservative and enclosed in their customs.

Different techniques may be used depending on the objective, which may include searching, sorting, mathematical optimization, constraint satisfaction, categorization, analysis, and prediction. ===Brute force=== Brute force is a simple, exhaustive technique that evaluates every possible outcome to find a solution. ===Divide and conquer=== The divide and conquer technique decomposes complex problems recursively into smaller sub-problems. Each sub-problem is then solved and these partial solutions are recombined to determine the overall solution. This technique is often used for searching and sorting. ===Dynamic=== Dynamic programming is a systematic technique in which a complex problem is decomposed recursively into smaller, overlapping subproblems for solution. Dynamic programming stores the results of the overlapping sub- problems locally using an optimization technique called memoization. ===Evolutionary=== An evolutionary approach develops candidate solutions and then, in a manner similar to biological evolution, performs a series of random alterations or combinations of these solutions and evaluates the new results against a fitness function. The most fit or promising results are selected for additional iterations, to achieve an overall optimal solution. ===Graph traversal=== Graph traversal is a technique for finding solutions to problems that can be represented as graphs. This approach is broad, and includes depth- first search, breadth-first search, tree traversal, and many specific variations that may include local optimizations and excluding search spaces that can be determined to be non-optimum or not possible. These techniques may be used to solve a variety of problems including shortest path and constraint satisfaction problems. ===Greedy=== A greedy approach begins by evaluating one possible outcome from the set of possible outcomes, and then searches locally for an improvement on that outcome. When a local improvement is found, it will repeat the process and again search locally for additional improvements near this local optimum. A greedy technique is generally simple to implement, and these series of decisions can be used to find local optimums depending on where the search began. However, greedy techniques may not identify the global optimum across the entire set of possible outcomes., ===Heuristic=== A heuristic approach employs a practical method to reach an immediate solution not guaranteed to be optimal. ===Learning=== Learning techniques employ statistical methods to perform categorization and analysis without explicit programming. Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning techniques are included in this category. ===Mathematical optimization=== Mathematical optimization is a technique that can be used to calculate a mathematical optimum by minimizing or maximizing a function. ===Modeling=== Modeling is a general technique for abstracting a real-world problem into a framework or paradigm that assists with solution. ===Recursion=== Recursion is a general technique for designing a algorithm that calls itself with a progressively simpler part of the task down to one or more base cases with defined results., == See also == * Algorithm engineering * Algorithm characterizations * Theory of computation ==Notes== ==External links== * Algorithmic Design and Techniques - edX * Algorithmic Techniques and Analysis – Carnegie Mellon * Algorithmic Techniques for Massive Data – MIT Category:Mathematical logic Category:Theoretical computer science ","title":"Algorithmic technique"},{"id":"60310748","text":"Justice Prashant Mishra (born 29 August 1964) is an Indian judge.

She is remembered for painting the portraits of prominent figures of the times, including Prime Minister Paul Eyschen (1841–1915) and the mayor of Luxembourg City Alphonse Munchen (1850–1917). She exhibited at the Cercle artistique from 1894 to 1912. ==Biography== Born on 18 April 1858 in Luxembourg City, Marie-Thérèse Hartmann was the daughter of the architect Antoine Hartmann (1817–1891). Encouraged by her father who introduced her to painting, she became one of the first women from Luxembourg to study abroad. In 1877, when she was only 19, she spent a year in Düsseldorf studying privately under Gustav Süs. She then continued her studies in Munich for a further two years under Sándor Liezen-Mayer. Finally, she spent two years in Paris where she was the pupil of Emile Carolus-Duran and Jean-Jacques Henner who had opened a school for female artists. It was unusual for a young woman from Luxembourg to receive such expert training in art at the time and to spend so many years abroad. The Luxembourg academy did not admit women until the end of the 19th century which possibly explains why her Portrait de S.A.R. Madame la Princesse Henri des Pays-Bas (1879) was not considered worthy of inclusion in Luxembourg City's collection. Shortly after returning from Paris, she married the jurist and state councillor Mathias Glaesener (1858–1924). Even after her daughter was born in 1886, she continued to paint. While still a student she began to exhibit in Luxembourg at the Galerie Louis Segers. Her works, particularly her portraits of men, were considered to be of a high quality. From 1894 to 1912, she exhibited at the Cercle artistique. Thérèse Glaesener-Hartman died in Luxembourg City on 19 February 1923. A street in the city bears her name.

This continued a tradition of gendered physical activity dating back to the early 20th century, with the Harmonic Gymnastics of Genevieve Stebbins in America and Mary Bagot Stack in Britain. One of the pioneers of modern yoga, Indra Devi, a pupil of Krishnamacharya, popularised yoga among American women using her celebrity Hollywood clients as a lever. The majority of yoga practitioners in the Western world are women. Yoga has been marketed to women as promoting health and beauty, and as something that could be continued into old age. It has created a substantial market for fashionable yoga clothing. Yoga is now encouraged also for pregnant women. ==A gendered activity== Mary Bagot Stack in \\"Seal\\" posture in Building the Body Beautiful, the Bagot Stack Stretch-and- Swing System, 1931. It closely resembles the modern yoga asana Salabhasana, locust pose. The yoga author and teacher Geeta Iyengar notes that women in the ancient Vedic period had equal rights to practice the meditational yoga of the time, but that these rights fell away in later periods. The Indologist James Mallinson states that the Gorakhnati yoga order always avoided women, as is enjoined by hatha yoga texts such as the Amritasiddhi, the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, and the Gheranda Samhita; but all the same, women are mentioned as practising yoga, such as using vajroli mudra to conserve menstrual fluid and hence obtain siddhi. The yoga scholar Mark Singleton notes that there has been a dichotomy between the physical activities of men and women since the start of European gymnastics (with the systems of Pehr Ling and Niels Bukh). Men were \\"primarily concerned with strength and vigor while women [were] expected to cultivate physical attractiveness and graceful movement.\\" This gendered approach continued as the practice of yoga asanas became popular in the mid-20th century. A masculinised form of yoga grew from Indian nationalism, favouring strength and manliness, and sometimes also a form of religious nationalism, and continues into the 21st century among Hindu nationalists like the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, continuing the tradition of gymnastics and bodybuilding exemplified by early-20th-century figures like K. V. Iyer and Tiruka. The other form emphasises stretching, relaxation, deep breathing, and a more \\"spiritual\\" style, continuing a women's tradition of exercise dating back to the Harmonic Gymnastics of Genevieve Stebbins and Mary Bagot Stack. Yoga practitioners are predominantly female, young, affluent, fit, and white. Alongside the yoga brands, many teachers, for example in England, offer an unbranded \\"hatha yoga\\", often mainly to women, creating their own combinations of poses. These may be in flowing sequences (vinyasas), and new variants of poses are often created. The gender imbalance has sometimes been marked; in Britain in the 1970s, women formed between 70 and 90 per cent of most yoga classes, as well as most of the yoga teachers. The scholar of modern yoga Kimberley J. Pingatore similarly notes that yoga practitioners in the United States are predominantly female, young, affluent, fit, and white. In the United States in 2004, 77 per cent of yoga practitioners were women; in Australia in 2002, the figure was 86 per cent, the majority middle-aged and health-conscious. The imbalance may be increasing: Yoga Journals survey in 1997 found that a little over 80 percent of readers were female; in 2003, the journal's advertising page reported 89 percent female readership. This is causing yoga to evolve as a female practice, taught by women to women. Leading \\"yoginis\\", women in modern yoga, include Nischala Joy Devi, Donna Farhi, Angela Farmer, Lilias Folan, Sharon Gannon (co-founder of Jivamukti Yoga), Sally Kempton, Gurmukh Kaur Khalsa, Judith Hanson Lasater, Swamini Mayatitananda, Sonia Nelson, Sarah Powers (founder of Insight Yoga), Shiva Rea (founder of Prana Vinyasa yoga), Patricia Sullivan, Rama Jyoti Vernon, and Sadie Nardini (founder of Core Strength Vinyasa Yoga). ==History== ===Louise Morgan=== In 1936, the journalist Louise Morgan interviewed the rajah of Aundh, Bhawanrao Shriniwasrao Pant Pratinidhi, in the News Chronicle. Her report announced \\"Surya Namaskars – The Secret of Health\\", claiming that not only were the rajah and the rani (his wife, the queen) in perfect health (although he was over 70, and she had had eight children), but the 60-year-old wife of the rani's tutor looked younger than her daughters. According to Goldberg, many American mothers secretly but heartily wished that. This was the first time that Surya Namaskar had been sold to Western women. ===Indra Devi=== Indra Devi's 1959 Yoga for Americans encouraged women to practise at home. On the cover (top left), she wears her characteristic sari. A pioneer of modern asana-based yoga, Indra Devi (born Eugenie V. Peterson), the Russian pupil of the founder of yoga as exercise, Krishnamacharya, argued that yoga was suitable for well-to-do Indian women: \\"Yogic exercises since they are non- violent and non-fatiguing are particularly suited to a woman and make her more beautiful.\\" The historian of modern yoga Elliott Goldberg notes that the normally progressive Devi was effectively arguing for \\"a gentle yoga for the fairer sex\\", deprecating the more energetic exercises such as Surya Namaskar. Devi was encouraged by Krishnamacharya to begin teaching yoga in China. In 1939, she opened the first yoga school in Shanghai, continuing to run it for seven years, mainly teaching American women. On her return in 1947, she opened a yoga studio on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, teaching yoga to film stars and other celebrities including Greta Garbo, Eva Gabor, Gloria Swanson, Robert Ryan, Jennifer Jones, Ruth St. Denis, Serge Koussevitsky, and the violinist Yehudi Menuhin. This famous clientele helped Devi to sell yoga, and her books such as her 1953 Forever Young Forever Healthy, her 1959 Yoga for Americans, and her 1963 Renew Your Life Through Yoga, to a sceptical American public. Not all her clients were women, but all the same, much of the advice in her books was to women. For example, in Forever Young Forever Healthy, Devi advises her readers that \\"No make-up can hide a hard line around the mouth, a selfish expression on the face, a spiteful glance in the eyes.\\" She instructs them to stay absolutely quiet and ask themselves if they are as beautiful as they can be; in her view, yoga brought beauty by assisting with peace of mind. ===Marcia Moore=== A yoga model wearing a Lululemon outfit performs Eka Pada Urdhva Dhanurasana. The American heiress (her father was the founder of Sheraton Hotels) Marcia Moore studied yoga in Calcutta in the 1950s, and trained as a yoga teacher under Swami Vishnudevananda in Canada in 1961; she opened the Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centre in Boston in 1962. Her classes were, according to the journalist Jess Stearn, \\"wholly attended by upper-middle- class fortyish housewives\\". Stearn reflected on why their husbands did not join the classes; he supposed that the men were put off by how easily their wives performed the asanas, and being unfit office workers, felt they would lose face if seen to be less physical than their wives. Moore explained to Stearn that the women were more interested in caring for their bodies than their husbands, since they had been caring for that \\"package\\" all their lives, and they didn't want to \\"see the wrapping wrinkled and spoiled.\\" Goldberg adds that this did not explain why the women chose classes rather than home practice; he suggests that, as well as the skill and motivation that a teacher could provide, going out to a class gave these 1960s housewives an identity of their own, \\"being involved in an exotic exercise practice with a group of other daring women.\\" They developed their own subculture with yoga books, lectures, classes, friends and a shared uniform of black leotards and stockings, combining a dancer's \\"hip severity\\" with a chorus girl's \\"ostentatious allure\\". ===Britain=== While Devi and Moore were spreading asana-based yoga on the other side of the Atlantic, women in Britain took up the practice from the 1960s, and yoga, in other words asana sessions, became a common option among adult education evening classes. For example, in Birmingham, a local newspaper editor, Wilfred Clark, gave a lecture on yoga to the Workers' Educational Association in 1961, meeting such an enthusiastic response that he proposed yoga classes to the local education authority, and founded in turn the Birmingham Yoga Club, the Midlands Yoga Association, and finally the British Wheel of Yoga in 1965. Yoga groups soon sprang up all over Britain. Yoga has increasingly been marketed as \\"an aid to women's health and beauty\\". Yoga reached London's evening classes in 1967. The Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) stated that classes in \\"Hatha Yoga (sic)\\" should not cover the philosophy of Yoga, favouring \\"Keep Fit\\" classes in asanas and \\"pranayamas (sic)\\" especially for people aged over 40, and expressing concern about the risk of \\"exhibitionism\\" and the lack of suitably qualified teachers. The ILEA's Peter McIntosh watched some classes taught by B. K. S. Iyengar, was impressed by his book Light on Yoga, and from 1970 ILEA-approved yoga teacher training was run by one of Iyengar's pupils, Silva Mehta. Yoga classes grew beyond those of local education authorities when ITV screened Yoga for Health from 1971; it was adopted by more than 40 TV channels in America. The yoga researcher Suzanne Newcombe estimates that the number of people, mainly middle-class women, practising yoga in Britain rose from about 5,000 in 1967 to 50,000 in 1973 and 100,000 by 1979; most of their teachers were also women. With the rise of feminism and being well-educated, middle-class British women were starting to resent being housewives, and given their relative economic freedom, were ready to experiment with new lifestyles such as yoga. Newcombe speculates that their husbands may have found having their wives attending \\"course on traditionally feminine subjects like flower arranging or cooking ... less threatening and more respectable than employment outside the home.\\" The women saw evening classes as safe, interesting, and a good place to make friends with like-minded people. Further, women in Britain were accustomed to gendered physical education, dating back to Mary Bagot Stack's Women's League of Health and Beauty before the Second World War. ===India=== Little is known of many of the women who helped to develop modern yoga in India, but one of Bishnu Charan Ghosh's pupils in Calcutta was Labanya Palit, who published a manual of 40 asanas, Shariram Adyam (\\"A Healthy Body\\"), in 1955, a work admired by the poet and polymath Rabindranath Tagore. Fashion leggings (yoga pants) are becoming big business. ==Health and beauty== Yoga has been marketed to women as something that made them look younger, and that they could carry on learning or teaching into old age, a message taught by books such as Nancy Phelan and Michael Volin's 1963 Yoga for Women: \\"Most yoga teachers know ... of women who have astonished everyone ... discarding stiffness and tension for suppleness, slimness, serenity and poise\\". The yoga models in the 1960s and 1970s wore \\"flattering and sexy fishnet stockings and a tight-fitting leotard top.\\" ==Clothing and accessories== Women's yoga has created a large market for fashionable yoga clothing. Major yoga clothing brands include Lululemon, known for their yoga pants. Sales of athleisure clothing including yoga pants were worth $35 billion in 2014, forming 17 per cent of American clothing sales. ==Pregnancy== Indian Minister for Women and Child Development Maneka Sanjay Gandhi participating in a programme of yoga for pregnant women In the 1960s, Krishnamacharya identified asanas suitable for pregnant women. Geeta Iyengar's 1990 A Gem for Women described a yoga practice adapted to women, with sections on yoga in menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause. Before 1980, few books considered whether yoga was relevant to pregnancy. Since then, numerous books have addressed the subject, including Geeta Iyengar's 2010 Iyengar Yoga for Motherhood, Françoise Barbira Freedman's 2004 Yoga for Pregnancy, Birth, and Beyond, and Leslie Lekos and Megan Westgate's 2014 Yoga For Pregnancy: Poses, Meditations, and Inspiration for Expectant and New Mothers. According to the American Pregnancy Association, yoga increases strength and flexibility in pregnant women, helping them with breathing and relaxation techniques to assist labour. The practice of yoga asanas has sometimes been advised against during pregnancy, but that advice has been contested by a 2015 study which found no ill-effects from any of 26 asanas investigated. The study examined the effects of the set of asanas on 25 healthy women who were between 35 and 37 weeks pregnant. The authors noted that apart from their experimental findings, they had been unable to find any scientific evidence that supported the previously published concerns, and that on the contrary there was evidence including from systematic review that yoga was suitable for pregnant women, with a variety of possible benefits. ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== : : : : : : : : : : : : : : Category:Yoga as exercise Category:Women's culture ","title":"Yoga for women"},{"id":"60310810","text":"The 2007–08 Bill Beaumont Cup (Rugby Union County Championship) was the 108th edition of England's County Championship rugby union club competition.

It was built around 1425. It houses three tombs, possibly belonging to Sultan Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah, his wife, and son Shamsuddin Ahmad Shah, but the identification is disputed. The structure represents a village hut with a sloping roof and serves as a prototype for the various other buildings constructed during the Bengal Sultanate. ==History== The mausoleum was built in the early 15th century (). It houses three tombs. One tomb is believed to be that of Sultan Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah, the other two of his wife and son Shamsuddin Ahmad Shah. The orientation and the identification of these tombs is disputed. Jalaluddin was a son of Raja Ganesha and had later converted to Islam. He was the first native Muslim king of Bengal and the last Sultan of Bengal to rule from Pandua. According to tradition, the construction of the mausoleum cost one lakh rupees (). The mausoleum received its name \\"Eklakhi\\" () from this amount. The mausoleum is designated as a Monument of National Importance (N-WB-100) by the Archaeological Survey of India. ==Architecture== The mausoleum is the earliest surviving square-shaped building with a single dome in Bengal. The brick structure has thick walls and an octagon-shaped interior, which together minimize the size of squinches required. The mausoleum has a smoothly curved cornice, terracotta ornamentation on the walls, and engaged towers at the corners. The cornice supports the hemispherical dome on square squinches. The mausoleum is wide and in height. The diameter of the dome is . A doorway is present at each of its facades. Each doorway has a pointed arch. The interior chamber measures and has no window. Historian Perween Hasan writes that the architecture may have been inspired by the brick temples in pre-Islamic Bengal. As Jalaluddin was the first native Muslim king of Bengal, he may have built the mausoleum in typical Bengali style, highlighting his roots. The mausoleum's structure represents a thatched hut with a sloping roof forming eaves. It is the earliest example of the distinctive Bengali architecture which was popularised during the period of the Bengal Sultanate and later. ==Gallery== File:Eklakhi Mausoleum at Pandua in Malda district 11.jpgTerracotta carvings on the walls File:Eklakhi Mausoleum at Pandua in Malda district 04.jpgOctagonal tower strengthening the structure File:Eklakhi Mausoleum at Pandua in Malda district 10.jpgCarvings File:Eklakhi Mausoleum at Pandua in Malda district 14.jpgDecorated gate and walls ==Notes== ==References== ===Bibliography=== * Category:Monuments of National Importance in West Bengal Category:Mausoleums in India Category:Bengali architecture Category:Architecture of Bangladesh Category:Tombs in India Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 15th century Category:Indo-Islamic architecture ","title":"Eklakhi Mausoleum"},{"id":"60310906","text":"The Fort of Nossa Senhora das Mercês de Catalazete, also known as the Fort of Catalazete, is located on the right bank of the River Tagus estuary in the municipality of Oeiras in the Lisbon District of Portugal. The fort dates back to 1762, when a small battery was erected on a site between the Fort of São Julião da Barra and the Fort of Santo Amaro do Areeiro, with the purpose of strengthening the defence provided by those two forts. ==History== Built at the time of the Spanish–Portuguese War (1762-63) and the Seven Years' War (1756-63), which involved all European powers, the Fort of Catalazete had an irregular pentagonal design. It initially consisted solely of a masonry parapet, which had been completed by 1763 when an inspection visit reported a garrison with nine firearms, two of 40-gauge bronze and seven of 24-gauge iron. An inspection in 1777 reported that it was still open on the land side (northwest). At this time it was given to a farming family to guard and maintain, while still having artillery and bullets on site. Conservation work was carried out in 1793 and a report from 1796 indicated there were ten 24-gauge pieces. In 1804 it was garrisoned by two corporals and thirteen soldiers. Unlike other maritime strongholds at the time, it remained garrisoned and equipped after the Peninsular War ended in 1814. During the Portuguese Civil War (1828-34), the Fort of Catalazete was guarded by a sergeant, a corporal and twenty artillery soldiers. In 1831 its 36-Caliber pieces responded with 17 shots to the fire of the French fleet that, under the command of Admiral Roussin, entered the River Tagus in 1831, going on to anchor in the port of Lisbon, where it captured eight ships and imposed on Miguel I of Portugal a humiliating surrender. This appears to have been the only time the fort was involved in combat. The fort today The fort was deactivated in the middle of the 19th century, when it was inhabited by a single veteran soldier. In 1888 the premises were leased for nine years to a private individual who converted the fort into his residence. He was evicted in 1897 for having failed to pay the rent and a new tenant identified. During the Estado Novo dictatorship (1926-68) the Fort of Catalazete was used by the families of military officials. It was considerably damaged by waves during a strong cyclone-like windstorm that had a direct hit on Lisbon on February 15-16, 1941. Repairs were carried out in 1942 as part of the landscaping for the new Lisbon to Cascais road, known as the Marginal. Following considerable dispute about its use in the 1950s, it became a holiday camp in 1959 for the Mocidade Portuguesa, a youth group established by the right-wing government. Since 1977, it has been occupied by the Portuguese Association of Youth Hostels. ==References== * Catalazete Category:Buildings and structures in Oeiras, Portugal Category:Coastal fortifications in Portugal ","title":"Fort of Nossa Senhora das Mercês de Catalazete"},{"id":"60310925","text":"David Donato may refer to: * David Donato (singer), American singer for White Tiger and Black Sabbath * David Donato (footballer) (born 1970), Australian rules footballer ","title":"David Donato"},{"id":"60310948","text":"33 Ledgelawn Avenue is an historic building in Bar Harbor, Maine, formerly St. Edward's Convent.

However, Morocco became an independent Berber-Arab Kingdom while Syria became part of the Ottoman Empire until both were again together occupied by France. ===Modern relations=== Morocco and Syria began to establish relations upon the withdrawal of France from Morocco at 1956. However, Syria was later met with political turmoil, as the wave of pan-Arabism and anti-Israeli sentiment was on the rise. This fervour soon reached Morocco, but unlike Syria, Morocco was able to stand its ground. This was the initial cause of the tensions between the countries.https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00424544/document Moroccan-Syrian tensions soon erupted, with Morocco siding with the West and Syria, whilst the United Arab Republic, sided with Algeria during the Sand War. Since then, Syria had a distrust for Morocco due to its close ties with the West, particularly, the United States and Israel and they often had limited cooperation. In 1965, Moroccan King Hassan II secretly invited Mossad and Shin Bet agents to record the Arab League's meeting in Casablanca, which was instrumental in leading to the Six-Day War and Syrian defeat, which further strained relations between two. The relations improved slightly when Morocco sent troops to help its Arab allies, including Syria, during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, this slight improvement, however, did not last long. Despite Morocco's efforts during the 1973 conflict, Syria supported the Polisario against the Moroccans during Western Sahara War from 1975, angering Morocco, and was later admitted by Bashar al-Assad over Syria's efforts to help Polisario militants fighting Royal Moroccan Armed Forces in 2013. This was even further gone by Hafez al-Assad's decision to cut tie with Morocco after Hassan II held a secret meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres. Morocco would remain in tensions with Syria throughout the rest of both leaders' reigns, and their relations only got little improvement since the death of both Hafez al-Assad and Hassan II. ===Syrian Civil War=== The outbreak of civil war in Syria once again strained relations, with Morocco supporting the Syrian opposition against Assad regime in Syria and has hosted meeting anti-Assad coalition in 2012 and 2013. Even though Morocco has tried to distance from the conflict and even endorsed a political solution instead of military intervention, Morocco has been accused by Syria for financing and helping the Free Syrian Army against Assad. Morocco expelled Syrian ambassador in 2012 as a protest against Assad. While Morocco maintains supportive of Syrian refugees, cases like Syrians trapped between Algerian–Moroccan border also gave concerns to Moroccan authorities. In 2019, due to the changing tide in favor to Bashar al-Assad, Morocco opted to secure a position that would accept Syria's return to Arab League; but tensions between both countries developed by historical mistrusts still play a role on hampering its development. ==References== Category:Bilateral relations of Morocco Category:Bilateral relations of Syria ","title":"Morocco–Syria relations"},{"id":"60311020","text":"Isaac Davydovich Glikman (1911–2003) was a Russian literary critic, theater critic, librettist, screenwriter, and teacher at the St. Petersburg Conservatory.

It passes through the districts of Siming District and Huli District. It is 43 kilometers long, and its number is County Route 401. == Overview == Beaches on Island Ring Road Island Ring Road is 43 kilometers long. Construction of the road began in 1991 at a cost of 3.8 billion RMB, lasting for three weeks. Throughout its length, the road is either a four-lane divided highway or a six-lane divided highway. Island Ring Road begins at Mt. Shigu Interchange in the northern region of Xiamen Island. From there it follows Shugang Road, Hubin West Road, and Lujiang Avenue near Gulangyu. It continues from Heping Wharf, along Yanwu Bridge, towards Xiamen University and Hulishan Fortress. The section of the road beginning at Hulishan Fortress is known as Island Ring South Road; it passes Zengcuo'an, Huangcuo, continuing towards Xiamen International Conference and Exhibition Center. At this point, the name of the road becomes Island Ring East Road. The route keeps heading in a northern direction till Wuyuan Bridge, in Wutong. It eventually follows Fangzhong Road to the south of Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport through the Gaoqi Interchange and Jiahe Road. Finally, it returns to its terminal of Mt. Shigu Interchange. The 13 kilometers of Island Ring Road from White City of Xiamen University to Xiangshan constitute a notable tourist attraction of Xiamen. In 1997, they were listed as one of the \\"Top 20 Sceneries of Xiamen\\", and dubbed \\"Watching the Sea at East Ring.\\" Here, the road is constructed up close to the sea; sights along the way include Lieyu, Dadan, two islets, and a large sign that reads, \\"one country, two systems\\". == Bridges == === Yanwu Bridge === Yanwu Bridge () forms the southwest portion of Island Ring Road from the port area of Xiamen to Baicheng in Xiamen University. It spans a total of 2.2 kilometers, going through interchanges at Chenggong Avenue, Yanwu, and Baicheng. The bridge opened to traffic on 2003 Sep 6th, costing a total of 560 million RMB. The bridge is constructed with fish-belly beams and concrete pillars, and it is painted in white. In order to avoid affecting the landscape of the coast, the bridge's lighting system is only attached to the guardrails, not the pillars. Since the bridge deck elevation of the lower bridge section of the Yanwu Bridge is only 5.5 meters, it is considered to be the closest bridge to the sea level in the world. === Wuyuan Bridge === Wuyuan Bridge (), formerly Zhongzhaiwan Bridge (), was renamed to its current name in February 2006. The bridge spans the mouth of Wuyuan Bay, connecting the sections of Island Ring Road between Wutong and Dunshang.

In 2017 he completed a project that called for running five marathons on five different continents, and climbing five summits in five different continents. ==Early life== Necdet Turhan was born in Balıkesir, Turkey, in 1957. He was schooled in Bursa due to his father's professional assignment. He lost his eyesight due to a corneal disease which began when he was 23. After finishing high school, he studied political science and public administration at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara. He graduated with honours in 1994. ==Career== Turhan started mountaineering by joining the \\"Mountain Climbing and Winter Sports Club\\" at his university. He initially faced objection from the club members due to his blindness, but afterwards was allowed to take part in climbing activities. He reached the summits of Bey Dağları, Mt. Erciyes, and other peaks in Turkey. He became interested in long-distance running after he met master athletes exercising at the Bursa Atatürk Stadium. In 2000, he took part in the Istanbul Marathon, running in the category. As part of a project titled \\"Five marathons, five summits in five continents\\", which was sponsored by the \\"Bridge to Turkey Fund\\" of the Turkish people living in the U.S., Turhan ran the New York City Marathon (Americas) in 2002, the Athens Classic Marathon (Europe) in 2004, the Japan World Blind Marathon (Asia) in 2005, the Sydney Marathon (Australasia) in 2006, and the Egyptian Luxor Marathon (Africa) in 2007. He climbed the Mt. Ararat (Asia) in 2007, the Mt. Kilimanjaro (Africa) in 2008, the Mont Blanc (Europe) in 2010, and the Mt. Sherman (Americas) in 2014. After completing five marathons and four summits, he achieved his project goal in 2017 by climbing the Mt.

He was lightly campaigned in his early career but eventually developed into a top class miler who won the Celebration Mile in 2016 and 2017 and recorded his biggest victory at the age of seven when he took the Sussex Stakes. He was also placed in numerous top-class races including the Queen Anne Stakes, Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and Lockinge Stakes. Lightning Spear was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. ==Background== Lightning Spear is a chestnut horse standing 16.1 hands high bred in England by the Hertfordshire-based Newsells Park Stud. As a yearling in October the colt was put up for auction at Tattersalls and was bought for 260,000 guineas by David Redvers Bloodstock on behalf of Fahad Al Thani's Qatar Racing. He was sent into training with Ralph Beckett at Kimpton, Hampshire. His sire Pivotal was a top class sprinter who won the King's Stand Stakes and the Nunthorpe Stakes in 1996. He went on to become an “excellent” sire, getting the winners of more than a thousand races across a range of distances including Sariska, Somnus, Farhh, Kyllachy and Immortal Verse. Lightning Spear's dam Atlantic Destiny showed good form as a two-year-old in England when she won the Sirenia Stakes but had little subsequent success on the track. Her grand-dam Treat Me Nobly was a half-sister to Be My Guest and closely related to Golden Fleece. ==Racing career== ===2013 & 2014: early career=== On his first and only run as a juvenile, Lightning Spear started at odds of 11/4 in a thirteen-runner maiden race on the synthetic polytrack surface at Kempton Park Racecourse on 29 August. Ridden by Jamie Spencer he tracked the leaders before accelerating to gain the advantage inside the final furlong and won \\"readily\\" by three quarters of a length from Alpine Retreat. For his second season, Lightning Spear was transferred to the stable of Olly Stevens at Chiddingfold in Surrey. After an absence of well over a year the colt returned on 29 October for a minor handicap race over eight and a half furlongs at Nottingham Racecourse. With Jim Crowley in the saddle he took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by one and a quarter lengths from the four-year-old Artful Prince to whom he was conceding nine pounds in weight. ===2015: four-year-old season=== Lightning Spear began his third campaign in a one mile handicap race on the polytrack at Lingfield Park on 29 April in which he was ridden by Jim Crowley and finished strongly to win by half a length from Sacred Act. After a break of two months he carried top weight of 136 pounds in a similar event at Salisbury Racecourse and extended his unbeaten record, coming home two lengths clear of his nine opponents. In this race he was partnered by Oisin Murphy, who became his regular jockey. In July Lightning Spear was stepped up sharply in class for the Group 2 Summer Mile Stakes and Ascot Racecourse and sustained his first defeat as he finished second behind the favourite Arod, who was also owned by Qatar Racing. In the following month he was sent to Deauville Racecourse in France for the Group 1 Prix Jacques le Marois and came home fourth behind Esoterique with Toormore, Belardo and Karakontie finishing behind. In the Boomerang Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse in Ireland he started the 7/4 favourite but was beaten into third behind Custom Cut and Top Notch Tonto. On his final run of the year he was stepped up in distance for the ten furlong Champion Stakes at Ascot in October but made no impact and finished tailed off at the rear of the field. Olly Stevens retired from training at the end of the year and Lighting Spear moved to the yard of David Simcock in Newmarket, Suffolk. In the 2015 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Lighting Spear was given a rating of 115, making him the 205th best racehorse in the world. ===2016: five-year-old season=== On his first appearance of 2016 Lightning Spear started a 20/1 outsider for the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot in June and exceeded expectations as he finished a close third behind the American mare Tepin. In the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in July he was restrained towards the rear of the field and made some progress in the traight but never looked likely to win and came home sixth of the ten runners in a race which saw The Gurkha win from Galileo Gold and Ribchester. At Deauville on 14 August the horse ran for the second time in the Prix Jacques le Marois but was never in serious contention and finished unplaced behind Ribchester. Thirteen days after his run in France Lightning Spear was dropped back to Group 2 class for the Celebration Mile at Goodwood and started at odds of 4/1 in a five-runner field. The Thoroughbred Stakes winner Thikriyaat headed the betting with the other starters being Toormore, Arod and Zonderland (Sovereign Stakes). He raced towards the rear of the field, and despite briefly struggling to obtain a clear run in the straight he produced a strong late run, took the lead in the closing stages and won by one and three quarter lengths from Zonderland. David Simcock said \\"he's a very talented horse and he hadn't been able to produce for one reason or another. I've always said he's good, and I think he'll show his true potential next year. His turn of foot is something we've seen at home. We’ve always said he's the best miler we've had, and I'm just really relieved\\". Lighting Spear ended his season in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in which he came from the rear of the field to finish third of the thirteen runners behind Minding and Ribchester. Lighting Spear was given a rating of 120 in the 2016 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, making him the 34th best racehorse in the world. ===2017: six-year-old season=== Lightning Spear made his first appearance as a six-year-old in the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury Racecourse on 29 May in which he proved no match for Ribchester but finished clear of the other six runners in second place. He finished unplaced in his next two starts, coming home ninth to Ribchester in the Queen Anne Stakes, and seventh behind Ulysses in the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park on 8 July. The horse contested his second Sussex Stakes on 2 August and finished a close third behind the 20/1 outsider Here Comes When and the odds-on favourite Ribchester. On 26 August Lightning Spear attempted to repeat his 2016 victory in the Celebration Mile and started favourite ahead of Zonderland with the other four runners being Hathal (Superior Mile), Richard Pankhurst (Hungerford Stakes), Oh This Is Us (Spring Trophy) and Opal Tiara (Balanchine). After racing towards the rear of the field, Lightning Spear produced a strong late run in the straight and caught Zonderland on the line to win by a nose. Murphy commented: \\"I made no secret about how tactical the race was going to be. It was impossible to know what was going to happen, but you have to have confidence you have chosen to do the right thing and thankfully I just about got it right... It was a good performance today\\". On his two remaining starts in Europe that year, Lightning Spear ran sixth to Ribchester in the Prix du Moulin at Chantilly Racecourse in September and sixth again behind the filly Persuasive in the Queen Elizabeth Stakes in October. In December he started a 139/1 outsider for the Hong Kong Mile at Sha Tin Racecourse and came home tenth of the fourteen runners behind Beauty Generation. In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Lighting Spear was given a rating of 115, making him the 237th best racehorse in the world. ===2018: seven-year-old season=== As in 2017, Lightning Spear began his campaign in the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury and started a 16/1 outsider. He took the lead approaching the final furlong and looked likely to win but was caught on the line and beaten a short head by the filly Rhododendron. At Royal Ascot in June he ran for the third time in the Queen Anne Stakes and again ran well in defeat as he was beaten less than a length by the outsiders Accidental Agent and Lord Glitters. On 1 August Lightning Spear ran for the sixteenth time in a Group 1 race when he contested his third Sussex Stakes at Goodwood. Without Parole started favourite ahead of Expert Eye, Beat The Bank (Summer Mile) and Gustav Klimt (Superlative Stakes), with Lightning Spear fifth in the betting on 9/1. The other three runners were Lord Glitters, Orbaan (Prix de Saint-Patrick) and So Beloved (Spring Trophy). Murphy restrained the horse in fourth place in the early stages as Without Parole set a steady pace before making a forward move in the straight. After looking unlikely to get a clear run he accelerated through a gap between horses, took the lead inside the final furlong and won by a length and a half from Expert Eye. After the race Simcock commented \\"That’s the horse we see at home quite often and it all clicked into place today. As much as I’m pleased for his owners and myself, I’m more pleased for the horse – to win in a Group 1 is great. He is a lovely horse and has never let us down\\". Lightning Spear returned five weeks later for the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp in which he started second favourite but finished fifth behind Recoletos. In October he ran for the third time in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and was partnered by Mickael Barzalona as Murphy rode Qatar Racings' more fancied runner Roaring Lion.

Hollenbeck (born November 5, 1931) is an American Democratic Party politician who served six terms in the New Jersey General Assembly from the 36th Legislative District. ==Biography== Hollenbeck was born in Carlstadt and graduated from East Rutherford High School. A veteran of the Korean War, he attended Albright College in Reading, Pennsylvania and technical trade schools before becoming a supervisor for Public Service Electric and Gas. He is a cousin of Congressman Harold C. Hollenbeck. He was elected to the Carlstadt Borough Council for two separate terms— from 1965 to 1968 and from 1970 to 1973. He also served on the board of the Carlstadt Sewer Authority including being chairman. In 1973, Hollenbeck and Richard F. Visotcky were elected to the General Assembly from the newly created 36th district defeating incumbent Republican Assemblyman Peter J. Russo and East Rutherford mayor James L. Plosia. Hollenbeck and Visotcky would be reelected five more times on the Democratic ticket. Hollenbeck was appointed chair of the Assembly Energy and Natural Resources Committee in 1980 and would eventually chair the Assembly Agriculture and Environment Committee. In 1985, both Hollenbeck and Visotcky were defeated by Republicans Paul DiGaetano and Kathleen Donovan in the general election. In addition to the coattails from Thomas Kean's landslide victory in the gubernatorial election, DiGaetano and Donovan also criticized the Assembly's policy of allowing a free buffet lunch to legislators while in session which the two incumbents had partaken. ==References== Category:1931 births Category:Living people Category:People from Carlstadt, New Jersey Category:New Jersey city council members Category:American military personnel of the Korean War Category:Albright College alumni Category:Members of the New Jersey General Assembly Category:New Jersey Democrats ","title":"Robert P.

Similar taxespayable in the form of an animal's furalso existed in other territories. These taxes were typically paid by the Slavic inhabitants of the densely forested regions of Eastern Europe to the rulers of the neighboring nomadic peoples. Historian Pál Engel proposes that the marturina was also \\"originally a special tax that the Slavs of Slavonia had to pay to their Hungarian overlord\\". The tax was also collected in other territories to the south of the Drava (in Baranya, Požega and Valkó Counties). ==Collection== A document recorded in 1300 that those who were obliged to pay the marturina used to give one marten's fur to their lords in each year. During or before the reign of Coloman the Learned, King of Hungary (r. 1095–1116), the marturina was converted into a money tax. Initially, each mansio (or peasant household) was to pay 12 Freisach denars, but it was gradually raised during the 13th century before it was returned to its original rate around 1300. Those who were to pay marturina were also obliged to pay another tax, known as pondus. On the other hand, commoners paying the marturina were exempt of the chamber's profit (a tax collected in Hungary). ==From royal to seignorial tax== The marturina was initially a royal revenue, collected for the monarch, or for the duke who ruled Slavonia in the monarch's name. However, when parcels of the royal domain were given away, the grantee typically also seized the right to collect the royal taxes in his new estate. The marturina (and the pondus) collected in royal estates was attached to the honor of the Bans (or governors) of Slavonia in the 14th century. Revenues from the marturina made up around 8,000 florins in 1427. ==References== ==Sources== * * ==Further reading== * Category:Economic history of Croatia Category:Economic history of Hungary Category:Medieval Kingdom of Hungary Category:History of Slavonia ","title":"Marturina"},{"id":"60311255","text":"Amy Wing-Hann Wong, or Amy Wong, is a Canadian Chinese visual artist of Cantonese Chinese descent from Toronto specializing in oil painting exploring culture, identity politics, and feminism.

The legality of chapels in private houses was a controversial issue in the Byzantine law for centuries. In order to ensure that private eukteria remained separate and did not overburden the church's structure, as well as to prevent the dissemination of heresy, the emperor Justinian I () introduced several preconditions for their construction and ordered some restrictions, including a ban on celebrating the liturgy in the oratories of private houses. The Council in Trullo in 692 extended the prohibition to baptism. Under Leo VI (), the restrictions were lifted, but the patriarch Alexios Stoudites decided that this relaxation had led to many abuses and deprived bishops of much of control over the clergy and diocesan properties; in 1028, he forbade the use of eukteria for any service apart from the liturgy. Theodore Balsamon, the leading 12th-century Byzantine canonist, upheld the right of patrons to have regular liturgies and baptisms in their eukteria, but he was against the idea of anyone using a religious institution for his personal financial advantage. According to him, an eukterios oikos was a church that lacked consecration through chrismation, deposition of martyr relics, and enthronement of the officiating prelate. == Notes == == References == * * Category:Chapels Category:Types of church buildings Category:Greek words and phrases Category:Byzantine culture Category:Eastern Orthodoxy- related controversies ","title":"Eukterion"},{"id":"60311319","text":"Emmanuel is a romanization of the Hebrew name Immanuel. ==People== * Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy (1562-1630) * Charles Emmanuel II of Savoy (1634-1675) * Charles Emmanuel IV of Savoy (1751-1819) * Victor Emmanuel I of Savoy (1759-1824) * Victor Emmanuel II of Italy (1820-1878) * Victor Emmanuel III of Italy (1869-1947) * Victor Emmanuel, Prince of Naples (b. 1937) * Charles Emmanuel III of Savoy (1701-1773) * Emmanuel Adebayor (born 1984), Togolese football striker * Emmanuel Banahene (born 1988), Ghanaian footballer * Emmanuel Bett (born 1985), Kenyan long-distance runner * Emmanuel Boileau de Castelnau (1857-1923), French mountain climber * Emmanuel Callender (born 1984), Trinidadian sprint athlete * Emmanuel Collard (born 1971), French racing driver * Emmanuel Ellerbee (born 1996), American football player * Emmanuel Farhi (1978–2020), French economist * Emmanuel de Grouchy, Marquis de Grouchy (1766-1847) * Emmanuel Kiprono Kipsang (born 1991), Kenyan long- distance track runner * Emmanuel Kriaras, Greek lexicographer and philologist * Emmanuel Lescure (?-2017), French businessman * Emmanuel Levinas, French- Lithuanian Philosopher and Talmudic commentator * Emmanuel Lewis, American actor * Emmanuel Christopher Loblack (1898–1995), Dominican trade unionist and politician * Emmanuel Macron (born 1977), President of France *Emmanuel Maquet (born 1968), French MP * Emmanuel Mbende, footballer * Emmanuel de Merode (born 1970), director of the Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo * Emmanuel Moseley (born 1996), American football player * Emmanuel Pacquiao (born 1978), Filipino world champion professional boxer * Emmanuel Rhoides, Greek writer and journalist * Emmanuel Danilo Clementino Silva, naturalized Equatoguinean football goalkeeper * Emmanuel Yáñez, Uruguayan road cyclist * Jesús Emmanuel Arturo Acha Martinez (born 1955), stage name Emmanuel, Mexican singer * Maurice Emmanuel (1862-1938), French composer, teacher and musicologist * Tommy Emmanuel (born 1955), Australian guitar player * Ivor Emmanuel (1927—2007), Welsh singer and actor ==See also== *Emanuel (name) Category:Given names Category:Modern names of Hebrew origin ","title":"Emmanuel (name)"},{"id":"60311322","text":"Edith Mary Bataringaya née Kaijuka (1929–1977) was a prominent Ugandan Political Activist and Ugandan Political figure in post-independence Uganda. She was a co-founder of the Ugandan Women's Union and the Uganda Council of Women alongside Rhoda Kalema and Theresa Mbire. She was the wife of Basil Kiiza Bataringaya a prominent Ugandan politician in post-independence Uganda. ==Early life== Edith Mary Kaijuka was born in 1929 in Kabale, a city in the Western Region of Uganda. Her father was Reverend Kaijuka, a prominent reverend in the Church of Uganda and teacher from the neighboring village of Bugongi Hill. == Political career == Edith Mary Kaijuka married Basil Kiiza Bataringaya, son of Marko Kiiza the Ssaza Chief of Bunyaruguru, and she changed her name to Edith Mary Bataringaya. At the time of their marriage, Basil Kiiza Bataringaya was attending school, at the Government Teacher Training College of Uganda (TTC) and at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. Basil Kiiza Bataringaya quickly became a prominent political figure in Uganda. Bataringaya ran as a member of the Democratic Party of Uganda for the legislative seat for the Ankole District to the Uganda Legislative Council in the transitional government between the colonial-era Uganda Protectorate and the Republic of Uganda in the first Ugandan nationwide direct elections, the March 1961 Ugandan general elections. He became the Leader of Opposition during the Apollo Milton Obote regime and helped to establish the role as a check on the political leadership in Uganda. Basil Kiiza Bataringaya defected from the Democratic Party of Uganda to Apollo Milton Obote's Uganda People's Congress party on the floor of the Parliament of Uganda in the first high- profile political defection in Ugandan history. Basil Kiiza Bataringaya became the powerful Minister of Internal Affairs and quickly earned the trust of Prime Minister Apollo Milton Obote, and earned a spot in Obote's small inner circle of trusted advisors and amassed a large policy portfolio as one of the most powerful ministers in the Obote government. Edith Mary Bataringaya became an influential figure in the Apollo Milton Obote regime following Basil Kiiza Bataringaya's defection and ascension to the role of the Minister of Internal Affairs. She frequently traveled with her husband on trips abroad representing Uganda, representing Uganda and discussing her role as the head and co-founder of the Uganda Council of Women with diplomats abroad. She most notably traveled to the United States of America and met with members of the United States Department of State in addition to visiting Disneyland. == Activism == Edith Mary Bataringaya was a prominent activist in addition to the political duties she assumed as a high profile political spouse. Bataringaya started the Uganda Women's Union and the Uganda Council of Women alongside Rhoda Kalema and Theresa Mbire. In 1960, under the leadership of Bataringaya, the Uganda Council of Women passed a resolution urging that laws regarding marriage, divorce, and inheritance should be recorded in written form and publicized nationwide—a first step toward codifying customary and modern practices. During the first decade of independence, this council also pressed for legal reforms that would grant all women the right to own property and retain custody of their children if their marriages ended.Uganda country study. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 1990). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The work of the Uganda Council of Women under the leadership of Bataringaya led to changes in Uganda's Divorce Laws, leading to the written codification of the Divorce Act that gives men and women equal opportunities for divorce. == Death == Edith Mary Bataringaya's husband Basil Kiiza Bataringaya led an attempted arrest of Idi Amin, making him one of the first Ugandans to be detained by the new Idi Amin government. While in detention, Bataringaya was Tortured and was imprisoned in Makindye Prison. Bataringaya was then sent to the outskirts of the town of Mbarara, where he was dismembered alive. His severed head was then displayed on a pole, and paraded around the town of Mbarara until ultimately his severed head was displayed in the Mbarara barracks. Edith Mary Bataringaya became a widow raising her eight children alone on the Bataringaya land in Mbarara, and became a prominent threat political opponent to Idi Amin. Bataringaya herself was executed in 1977 during a later purge by Idi Amin, allegedly at the hands of Juma Bashir, the governor of the Western Province of Uganda. Her burnt body was later found on land in Mbarara owned by the Bataringaya family. This left her eight children orphaned. They were raised by her brother, Dr. Emmanuel Kaijuka. == Personal life == === Family === Edith Mary and Basil Kiiza Bataringaya had eight children, Dr. Geoffrey Basil Bataringaya, Basil Bataringaya Jr., Grace Bataringaya, Kenneth Bataringaya, Jackie Bataringaya, Janet Bataringaya, Juliet Wavamunno, and Dr. Aisha Bataringaya-Ssekalala. The children were orphaned in 1977 as both parents were killed by the Amin regime. Edith Mary Bataringaya's brother, Dr. Emmanuel Kaijuka who later served as the Ugandan Commissioner of Health, raised the children since they were still young when they were orphaned by their parents' murders. In 1985, the eight children reunited for the first time since their mother's murder in the town of Muyenga, Uganda. Their children all went on to successful careers as of 2003: Grace Bataringaya is a veterinary doctor and events manager, Kenneth Bataringaya is a businessman who manages the family estate, Jackie Bataringaya is a doctor for Action Aid working in Harare, Zimbabwe, Janet Bataringaya is working in Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts in the United States, Juliet Wavamunno (née Bataringaya) is a doctor working for the World Health Organization, and Aisha Bataringaya- Ssekalala (née Bataringaya) is studying at the University of Western Cape in South Africa. === Religious Views === Bataringaya was a Catholic and involved with the Catholic Church in Uganda throughout her career in both activism and politics. Bataringaya's father was a Church of Uganda reverend, and Bataringaya was raised in the Church of Uganda. Bataringaya's husband was initially a teacher at a Catholic school in Ankole, and eventually ran all Catholic schools in Ankole before entering politics. Edith Mary Bataringaya became a Catholic after marrying Basil Kiiza Bataringaya and she worked with local Catholic ministries throughout her career, and has been listed as a friend and ally of the Catholic missions in the Mbarara Region of Uganda. == References == Category:1929 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Ugandan Christians Category:Ugandan activists Category:Ugandan women activists Category:Ugandan politicians Category:Ugandan women in politics Category:People from Kabale District ","title":"Edith Mary Bataringaya"},{"id":"60311328","text":"Anne Buck (14 May 1910 – 12 May 2005) was a British cultural historian and curator of dress, who established the Gallery of Costume at Platt Hall in Manchester. She was a leading scholar of dress, who was a founder member and long-time chairman of the Costume Society, and author of many books and papers on the history of dress. She was described as \\"a towering presence, her contribution to her subject matched by only a handful of outstanding individuals world-wide in the twentieth century\\". ==Biography== Anne Buck was born in Harpenden, Hertfordshire on 14 May 1910. She attended St Albans High School for Girls and then Bedford College, London. After graduating in 1932, she took employment with the Times Book Club in London. In 1938, she joined Luton Museum, a speciality of which was the history of lace-making and straw hat manufacture - both trades formerly commonplace in its environs - and about which she became expert. In 1947 she moved Manchester to become the founding curator of the Gallery of Costume at Platt Hall, which had acquired a large collection of 19th century dress amassed by Cecil Willett Cunnington and Phillis Emily Cunnington. There, over the course of 25-years, she established what became a model for the curation and dissemination of information about dress, helping to transform what had been a twee and amateur pursuit into a rigorous academic discipline characterised by well-researched, factual and unsentimental expositions. Anne Buck was a founder-member of The Costume Society in 1964. She retired from the Gallery in 1972, a year after being awarded an OBE, and now dedicated her time to research, publication, and to the development of scholarship of dress. She was Chairman of The Society for Folk Life Studies from 1972 to 1975, and Chairman of the Costume Society for six years between 1974 and 1980. She published Dress In 18th-Century England in 1979, described as 'masterly' and dealing with the dress of 'actual people' (as opposed to the well-off), and detailing how clothes were worn and of what they were made. In retirement, her home in Bedfordshire became a nexus for dress scholarship.

The river is long, and has a drainage basin of . The width of the river is about 2–3 meters near the village of Satis (Pervomaisky District), which is a few kilometres from the source. The depth at this point is about 0.3 - 0.5m. The flow rate is about 0.8 m/s and the water remains clear. The river bed has sediment of pebbles and sand and the shores are lined with trees. The nature of the terrain remains almost uniform until the city of Sarov. The water is characterized by a fairly high content of sulphates and calcium salts. The soil is rich in limestone and limonite. The presence of the latter is manifested in the water's red hue after heavy rain. The water is cold even on hot summer days owing to the many springs that feed it. The presence of underwater springs largely explains the river does not freeze during the winter period in some areas. Geese on the river ==Fish == The ichthyofauna of the river is diverse. The following fish species inhabit the Satis, including its tributaries and other bodies of water in the river basin: * Chub * Minnow * Ruff * Dace * Crucian Carp *Crucian Carp Silver (Carassius Gibelio) * Carp * Rudd *Bream * Tench * Burbot * Minnow * Roach * Perch * Chinese sleeper(rus. ротан) * Bleak * Loach * Pike *Amur Sleeper * Orfe Representatives of the ichthyofauna of Moksha are found in the lakes located on the territory of the Mordovia Reserve: Sheatfish, Pikeperch, etc. In general, the dominant species are Roach, Gudgeon, Perch and Bleak - Oxyphilic species, which indicates favourable abiotic and biotic regimes. The population of species that are sensitive to pollution, such as Gudgeon, Bleak, Chub, Ruff, and Dace has increased. This indicates the ecological recovery processes of the river are succeeding. == References == Category:Rivers of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast ","title":"Satis (river)"},{"id":"60311590","text":"Mount Vernon is an unincorporated community in Whitfield County, in the U.S. state of Georgia. ==History== The first permanent settlement at Mount Vernon was made in 1830. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Whitfield County, Georgia Category:Unincorporated communities in Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Mount Vernon, Whitfield County, Georgia"},{"id":"60311595","text":"Florian Stork (born 27 April 1997) is a German cyclist, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam .

It was built and established on top of a small hill during the reign of the Sultan of Bengal, Shamsuddin Yusuf Shah in 1476 and is named after Afghan chieftain Khwaja Usman. ==History== According to local villagers, when the mosque was being constructed, the area was covered in dense forest and inhabited by tigers. To this day, three marks of a tiger's paw remains on the eastern pillar inside the mosque. During the reign of Shamsuddin Yusuf Shah, Musa ibn Haji Amir and his son, the Minister of Sylhet, Majlis Alam, built the mosque in 1476. Majlis Alam is also known for building Shah Jalal's mosque in Sylhet. In 1593, an Afghan chief by the name of Khwaja Usman, one of the Baro-Bhuyans of Bengal and the last Afghan ruler in Bengal, took shelter in this mosque after the Afghan rebellion against the Subahdar of Mughal Bengal, Man Singh I. In the late 1930s, a scholar by the name of Azam Shah is said to have settled near the mosque. In 1940, the original dome fell apart and Azam Shah raised money for the building of a new dome in which he successfully built alongside Ismail Mistri of Baniachong. In 1960, the mosque was again refurbished. After the depart of Azam Shah, it fell apart again and was held with branches and seedlings. ==Architecture== The dome is white-tiled and 18 feet tall. There are 3 large doors as well as 6 smaller doors. On the eastern pillar of the interior of the building, there is a mark of a tiger's paw. Near the ceiling, there is an Arabic inscription with a flowery design. There is a rock inscription on the western wall which is protected by an iron cage to avoid thieves.

She now resides in Albany, New York, where she continues to devote herself to supporting the activism of young feminists across China. == Early life and education == Lü was born in Shandong, China. In 1994, Lü received her master's degree in Chinese from Shandong University. In 2017, Lü enrolled in the graduate program in gender studies at University at Albany, SUNY. ==Career== Lü worked as a journalist at the national newspaper for women China Women's News (zhongguo funübao) after graduating from Shandong University. She took part in the United Nation's 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing, which gave rise to a strong wave of NGO organizing related to women's issues in China during the 1990s. Lü resigned from her job and became a freelancer in 2004. In 2009, she founded the electronic newsletter Women's Voice, which was the precursor of the later multi-platform media hosted on both Sina Weibo and Wechat. Feminist Voices, founded in 2009, is the most influential social media for feminist advocation in China. The channel fostered a generation of young Chinese feminists and created a community for activist engagements before it was censored in 2018. Lü also played a vital role in offline feminist activism in China, providing general moral support as well as concrete ideas.

Lü decided to remain in the United States after learning that the police visited her Beijing apartment. Her involvement in online feminist activism includes the Facebook group \\"Free Chinese Feminists\\", which campaigned for the release of her five colleagues, but has continued as a venue for related news and political organization and a Western window into Chinese feminism activism.

The phenomenon is associated with an unusually wet rainy season. The term may have developed as a label in the 1990s. ==Necessary conditions and sequence of events== The conditions under which a superbloom can occur are exceptional. Because some invasive grasses, such as bromes, will compete with native flowers for moisture, the desert must remain dry enough prior to the bloom to keep them from becoming established. The desert must receive rainfall in the autumn, and this rain must penetrate deep into the soil matrix in order to reach a majority of the dormant seeds of flowering plants. If subsequent rainfall is excessive or inundating, the young plants may be carried away in flash floods; if it is inadequate, the seeds will die from dehydration. Next, the ground in which the seeds lie must warm slowly over the several months which follow the first soaking rain, and the desert must have enough cloud cover both to shield the soil from intense daytime desert heat and to insulate it from overnight freezing temperatures. Finally, once the newly germinated plants have reached the surface of the soil, the desert must remain undisturbed by strong winds which would uproot the plants or damage the young shoots. The rare concatenation of these events is what makes a superbloom such an extraordinary occurrence. Carrizo Plain National Monument in 2017 In California, common plants which participate in superblooms are brittlebush (yellow flowers), California poppies (bright orange), bluebells (deep purple), lupine (purple), sand verbena (yellow), desert sunflowers (bright yellow), evening primrose (mostly white, occasionally yellow), popcorn flowers (white or yellow), and desert lily (white). Several of these plants are also invasive, such as wild mustard. In California, superblooms typically occur once every ten years or so. This has happened less often since the beginning of the 21st century due to persistent state drought. The state's Anza-Borrego Park is one of the most popular places to witness a superbloom, and the bloom of 2019 was particularly abundant. This followed another only two years prior, in 2017. === Tourism effects === Due to the massive influx of tourists, flowers were trampled. A number of people picked them or plants were pulled out with their roots. Additionally, massive traffic jams from the cars the tourists used prompted Lake Elsinore, California to shut down access to Walker Canyon. ==Algal superblooms== Because algae often reproduce in large sporadic bouts, referred to as algal blooms, the term \\"superbloom\\" is sometimes applied to especially prolific short-term algal growth that causes discoloration of water on a large scale. Other than sharing a botanical context, however, the two events have nothing in common. ==References== Category:Flowers Category:Phenomena Category:Natural history of California Category:Desert flora ","title":"Superbloom"},{"id":"60311769","text":"Abu Abdullah Ja'far ibn al-Aswad ibn al-Haytham was an Isma'ili da'i born in 268 AH (881/2 CE) in Qayrawan.

His brother John Gregory Duch (1960–2017) would follow Thomas in serving in Garfield city government. He graduated from Garfield High School, received a B.A. in government from Lehigh University in 1978, and a J.D. from Seton Hall University School of Law in 1981; he was admitted to the bar that same year. He practices law at a firm in Elmwood Park, New Jersey. In 1980 at the age of 23, Duch was elected mayor of Garfield and was reelected in 1984. In 1987, Duch and running mate Passaic Council President Louis J. Gill defeated Republican candidates Frank B. Calandriello and Andrew E. Bertone for two seats in the New Jersey General Assembly from the 36th district after the two incumbent Republicans chose not to run for reelection. The two were reelected in 1989. In 1990, Duch cast one of the final votes in favor of Governor James Florio's unpopular income tax increases. In the 1991 elections, following a redistricting which moved Garfield into the 38th district, Duch and his new running mate Frank Biasco were defeated by incumbent Republican Assembly members Patrick J. Roma and Rose Marie Heck. Duch would later move to Wyckoff. In 2003, he was hired as the city manager for Garfield. In 2017, he was the Democratic nominee for the New Jersey Senate from the 40th district. However, he was defeated in the general election by appointed Republican incumbent Kristin Corrado.

Photosynthetic eukaryotes mainly convert sunlight into energy via photosynthesis, but light also is important for movement and development, regulation of biological activities. The effective wavelength for light responses in photosynthetic eukaryotes is mainly in the red light (RL) and blue light (BL) regions (Mohr 1980; Furuya 1993). The red/far-red receptor phytochrome and phytochrome-mediated responses like suppression of hypocotyl growth have been studied intensively. BL-induced responses may include phototropism and chloroplast photo-relocation movement (Christie 2007). Various BL receptors have been discovered in green plants. Takahashi et.al isolated BL receptors from the Xanthophyceae alga, Vaucheria in 2007 and named it Aureochrome (Latin meaning: aureus = gold). This new class of blue light photoreceptors is unique in a way because of the presence of a bZIP (DNA binding domain) along with LOV (light perception) domain which makes it function as transcription factor as well as photoreceptor as shown by Takahashi et al. in 2007. Four orthologues of aureochromes have been identified in model diatom P. tricornutum, i.e. AUREO 1a, 1b, 1c and 2. Aureo1a recognizes the sequence TGACGT, which is the typical binding site for certain subfamilies of bZIP transcription factors. It was also shown that PtAUREO1a and 1c are regulated in a light-independent circadian rhythm and that they are capable of forming homodimers and heterodimers which recognize the ACGT core sequence within the aureochrome. The photoreactions of AUREO 1 protein have been studied recently by Tsuguyoshi et al (2011) and they concluded that the AUREO1-LOV exists in equilibrium between the monomer and dimer. Huysman et al. showed that Aureo1a is involved in regulation of expression of diatom-specific cyclin dsCYC2 which is involved in G1 to S phase transition after dark arrest in 2013. Aureo1a, indeed is shown to function as a repressor of high light acclimation. == References == == Further reading == * * * Category:Photoreceptor cells ","title":"Aureochromes"},{"id":"60312085","text":"Maura Doyle (born 1973) is a Canadian conceptual artist. She is best known for her controversial sculpture There's a New Boulder in Town. ==Early life and education== Doyle grew up in the Ottawa Valley in Ontario, Canada. She graduated with a BFA from the Emily Carr Institute in Vancouver, British Columbia, and an MFA from the University of Guelph. Beginning in 1994, Doyle and her friend Annie Dunning created a series of ten annual mail order catalogues, from which objects could be ordered from the artists. The catalogues were created as zines, to be shared with other artists through the mail. At the time, her zine work was not accepted as art by the faculty of Emily Carr. ==Career== Doyle's career has spanned numerous artistic forms, including publications, sculpture and public installations. In addition to Doyle's public art work There's A New Boulder In Town, she also has boulder- related work installed in Vancouver, British Columbia. Monument to All Boulders in Vancouver and on Planet Earth is a five tonne granite boulder, donated to the City of Vancouver by Or Gallery in 2005. In 2014, Doyle exhibited a series of 19 clay fired pots in the exhibition Who the Pot? at YYZ Gallery in Toronto. This work was subsequently shown at a 2016 exhibition at the Carleton University Art Gallery in Ottawa, where it won the “Innovation in Collection-Based Exhibition” Award at the 40th annual Ontario Association of Art Galleries Awards. ===There's a New Boulder in Town=== In 2004–2005, the Toronto Sculpture Garden exhibited Doyle's There's a New Boulder in Town. The exhibition included Erratic, a boulder known as a large glacial erratic, accompanied by a booklet titled There's a New Boulder in Town: Guidebook to Toronto's Erratic Boulders for Locals and Visitors. The booklet highlighted 20 similar boulders, all in the city of Toronto. The boulder itself had been brought from Peterborough, Ontario, to Toronto for the exhibit. A bronze plaque stating \\"ERRATIC BOULDER\\" was attached to it. The billion-year old boulder was offered for sale through the booklet for $9500, or 50 cents a pound. This arrangement would come with free delivery - largely covered by the cost of sale. When no offers were made, the artist considered paying to have the boulder removed to the Leslie Spit, an urban clean fill park, or to donate the work to the city as a work of public sculpture. In 2005 the boulder was permanently installed in Christie Pits park. ===Exhibitions=== * 2016. Maura Doyle: the Vessel, that with fugitive Articulation answer'd how deep is your love?.

It was a spin-stabilized rocket that was filled with 39 sticks of solid propellant weighing and the exhaust gasses were forced through six venturis that were angled at 18° to impart spin. The total weight of the rocket motor was .German and Japanese Solid-Fuel Rocket Weapons, pg.66-68 The body of the motor, warhead and nose cone were all made from rolled steel and were welded together. The warhead contained of Trinitroanisole and in the center of the nose cone, there was a pocket that could house either a Navy nose fuze as used by the 20 cm naval rocket or Army mortar fuze. The launcher was a two-wheeled wooden cart with a metal baseplate that held the base of the rocket. The rocket was launched by pulling a lanyard which tripped a spring powered hammer at the bottom left of the launcher which set off a percussion cap which started the rocket motor. The launcher could only be used once because the force of the launch destroyed the launcher. The first captured rocket was tested in Manila and although launched successfully at a 43° angle the rocket started wobbling during the latter half of its flight and only reached a range of .

'Bowmont' is a combination of their names. The Park was created in the 1980s. The escarpment formed by the Glacial Lake Calgary, runs the length of the park. Both Silver Springs and Varsity communities are perched at the top of the escarpment overlooking the Bow River and are access points to the Park. Bordering the northern banks of the Bow River, the park is includes \\"grasslands, gullies, valleys, a waterfall with a lookout, off-leash dog-walking areas, hiking, walking and cycling trails, access to the river for swimming and fishing, and more. The most recent expansion of Bowmont Park, Dale Hodges Park which was opened to the public in June 2019, includes innovative public art in the form of sculpted land structures that treat stormwater before it enters the Bow River through the outfall. ==Description== Bowmont Park is a large Natural Environment Park along the Bow River that stretches along the northern river edge and escarpment forming an \\"important wildlife corridor providing safe nesting for osprey and other birds\\". It offers expansive views from the top of the escarpment at Silver Springs and Varsity communities. The escarpment was left in its natural state and it is covered in a network of walking and cycling trails. A section of the Bowmont Natural Area forms the southern border of Silver Springs and is known locally as \\"The Ravine\\" or \\"The Gully\\". This Waterfall valley is a popular recreational area. The natural environment area contrasts with the adjacent suburban area. The lookout spot provides views of the Bow River, northern Bowness, and the railroad bridges.\\"The park is situated within the area bounded by Stoney Trail NW to the west, Crowchild Trail to the north and 16th Avenue/TransCanada Highway to the south and southeast (Map 1). It consists of a long narrow strip of land extending for about four kilometres from 85th Street NW at the west end to Home Road to the east. It is bordered on the north by the communities of Varsity and Silver Spring, and on the south side by the Bow River and the communities of Bowness and Montgomery. The main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway cuts across the west portion of the park, parallel to the river.\\" Page 7 ==Geological formations== ===Glacial Lake Calgary=== The slopes along Bowmont Park were carved by Glacial Lake Calgary which was formed as the last glaciers melted but the runoff was blocked by an ice dam further down the Bow River Valley, during the Pleistocene epoch. The slopes are incised by ravines. They rise up along the Silver Springs and Varsity escarpments. ==Background== In 1994 the City of Calgary designated the Bowmont area as a Natural Environment Park. In 2004, the City approved the Bowmont Natural Environment Park Management Plan. The Bowmont Natural Environment Park Management Plan was updated in 2016. In 2010 the City acquired the former privately-owned Klippert Concrete property, \\"located on the lower terrace below Varsity and accessed via Home Road\\", which \\"operated as a gravel pit until 2010.\\" O2 Planning + Design Inc completed a Biophysical Impact Assessment (BIA) in 2012 and a Design Development Plan (DDP) in 2014 for the area. ==Maintenance== The park is maintained by the city of Calgary Recreation Department. ==Naturalization initiatives (biodiversity)== In Bowmont Park the naturalizing project enhances the \\"sensitive grassland habitat\\" and improves the \\"important wildlife corridor\\". In a city-wide naturalization program in 2017, Calgary Parks announced that they were naturalizing a section of Bowmont park, the off-leash area parallel to Silverview Way NW. As part of the Bowmont Park Management Plan, they were \\"reintroducing native species to open spaces\\" and in this area removing smooth brome which is an invasive plant.Calgary has a 10-year biodiversity strategic plan with a goal of restoring \\"20% of Calgary's open space by 2025\\". According to Calgary Parks, naturalization refers to creating landscapes that \\"help support plant, animal and insect life\\"—biodiversity—which also helps \\"control invasive weeds and pests.\\" ==Features== The park has a network of recreational pathways, nature trails, interpretive trails, and paved sections of the Bow River pathway (BRP), that can be used for hiking, running, walking, and cycling, with some single track mountain biking trails. Some sections are designated as off-leash with both fenced and unfenced areas. There are picnic sites with tables, two playgrounds, a baseball field, which is accessible off Silver Hill Rd. N.W., and a soccer field, which is accessible off Silver Hill Rd. N.W. There are areas for passive use for birdwatchers, for example and lookout points with platforms. There are a number of river access points for fishing and swimming. Bowmont is part of an important wildlife corridor or green corridor in the city along with other city parks nearby, such as Nose Hill Park, Edworthy Park, Shouldice Park, Bowness Park, and Baker Park. Bowmont Park also includes Waterfall valley which runs from the south end of Silver Springs Boulevard to the river below. One of the major new features is Dale Hodges Park—in east Bowmont Park—that was recently restored through a multi-year consultation, planning, design, and implementation of the East Bowmont Park Improvement Project. In 2010 the City acquired the former Klippert gravel pit, which was located along the northern bank of the Bow River, and highly visible from the escarpment above. By 2018, the gravel pit operation and other disturbed lands were in replaced with \\"wetlands, wet meadows, riparian shrubland and Balsam Poplar forest.\\" The ecological integrity of the site was restored increasing the \\"bio-diversity index of one of the city's largest natural environment parks.\\" The site was transformed into a structured series of upland native riparian habitats with recreation and park amenities including \\"stormwater wetlands, wildlife habitat, trails for cycling and walking, and lookout points across the scenic river valley\\". ==Bow River pathway== Bowmont Park can be reached on the paved Bow River pathway (BRP) or from points along the escarpment. On the north side of the river the Bow River pathway runs along the river edge from west to east from Baker Park to Bowmont Park. The pathway network runs through Bowness Park with its railway bridges and then through waterfall valley. From the higher elevations the railroad bridges to the low-lying Bowness Park and Baker Park are visible, as is the Stoney Trail bridge to the west, and the Canada Olympic Park which is just across the river. From waterfall valley the pathways lead east to Dale Hodges Park, which was previously known as east Bowmont Park. The next park on the Bow riverside pathway heading east, is at Bowness Park. This includes the 12.7 kilometer Baker and Bowmont Park Loop cycling trail. The three parks—Baker, Bowmont, and Bowness—which are technically separate are linked by two pedestrian bridges creating a larger interconnected park.MEC ===Waterfall valley=== A trail-head for waterfall valley is at the south end of Silver Springs Boulevard at the top of the escarpment. The waterfalls include spring-fed tufa waterfalls where run-off from communities on the hill outflows into the Bow River. A series of boardwalks and wooden stairs lead to the valley below where there is a viewing platform. According to the City of Calgary, \\"Below the sediments lies the bedrock called the Porcupine Hills Formation. This bedrock was formed about 65 million years ago. When water percolates down from the surface, through the sediments it absorbs calcium carbonate. As it strikes the bedrock it flows sideways and exits out the side of the valley resulting in the falls in Waterfall Valley. The water then deposits the calcium carbonate on the algae covered rocks, producing the tufa.\\" ==Dale Hodges Park== File:Nautilus Pond from the escarpment with Calgary Olympic Park in the background.jpgNautilus Pond from the escarpment with Calgary Olympic Park in the background File:Nautilus Pond, Dale Hodges Park.jpgLarge sediment particles are removed from the stormwater in the Pond draining system File:Nautilus Pond.jpg File:Nautilus Pond in March with mallard ducks.jpgNautilus Pond with mallard ducks in the spring.

Dale Hodges Park, formerly known as the East Bowmont Natural Environment Park (NEP), was renamed on April 5, 2017 by Calgary's City Council, The engineering firm AECOM Canada, a local subsidiary of Los Angeles-based AECOM, a multinational, was formerly Tecsult. to recognize Calgary’s longest-serving member of council.\\"Dale Hodges (born 1941) was Calgary City Council Alderman from 1983 until his retirement in 2013. Among his major projects he worked to protect and create Calgary parks including the east Bowmont Park which is now Dales Hodges Park, Nose Hill Park, and Baker Park. He also worked to establish the Enmax Legacy Parks Program to provide ongoing funds to maintain the parks. Dale Hodges Park. Twitter The park was expanded in 2010 to include East Bowmont when the City of Calgary acquired the Klippert gravel pit, a former gravel-mining pit which was run by Klippert for sixty years, at the east end of Bowmont Park. Prior to its expansion and transformation, in 2010, The Calgary Herald described it as \\"one of Calgary’s biggest, prettiest and possibly least-known parks—a destination currently undergoing big changes itself. In an 2010 interview with the Herald, natural area management lead with the City of Calgary parks department, Chris Manderson, described how they created two \\"new wet ponds\\" which were educational and functional—the wet ponds \\"protect the Bow River by incorporating green stormwater treatment\\". In 2010, AECOM completed a scoping study.AECOM. (2010). Stormwater Quality Retrofits East Bowmont Scoping Study. Calgary: City of Calgary Alongside the ecological restoration, one of the main focuses of the project was stormwater treatment before entering the Bow River. The design includes a Nautilus Pond, a polishing marsh, a wet meadow, a stream, outfall, a dry stream, riparian areas, and a lookout mound. The stormwater enters Dale Hodges Park through the Nautilus Pond which is located at the west of the Park. Large sediment particles are removed in the Pond draining system and the water moves slowly through polishing marsh area where wetland plants remove finer particles. A surface stream carries water from the Pond to the marsh. The stream also collects the wet meadow stormwater and \\"conveys it to the outfall\\". The lookout knoll is encircled by the marsh with sedge and willows growing nearby.The design for the \\"sculpted polishing marshes and wet meadows\\" created by Sans façon, O2 and S2S were inspired by anabranches. \\"An anabranch or meander scroll is a section of a river or stream that diverts from the main channel or stem of the watercourse and rejoins the main stem downstream. Local anabranches can be the result of small islands in the watercourse. In larger anabranches, the flow can diverge for a distance of several kilometers before rejoining the main channel.\\" The 2012 and 2014 reports by O2 Planning + Design Inc noted that the contaminated soil from the gravel pit would be treated with phytoremediation. In November 2015, the City of Calgary began work on developing the Natural Environment Park. The project incorporates \\"green stormwater treatment as a functional element of the park\\" with \\"stormwater wetlands\\" that provide wildlife habitat\\". The park has cycling and walking trails as well as scenic lookout points across the Bow River valley. By April 2014 Calgary's Recreations department said that the east Bowmont Park would become a natural environment park and would \\"incorporate stormwater treatment for a large northwest Calgary drainage catchment.\\" The large area of nearly hectares is a \\"high priority as a stormwater quality retrofit project.\\" The transformation of the site, which incorporated \\"water engineering, public art, landscape architecture and ecological design\\", was the result of a collaboration between O2 Planning + Design, Source 2 Source Inc., Sans facon for Watershed+ and AECOM. The $2,006,000 project was scheduled to be completed in 2018. The design of the park includes innovative flood mitigation strategies, one of a number of initiatives to make Calgary more resilient. ==Fish habitat compensation== The main CPR railway crosses the Bow River in west Bowmont Park. By July 18, 2018 the Bowmont West Fish Habitat Enhancement Project—Fish Habitat Compensation project—was underway in the west border of Bowmont Park which is east of 85 ST NW, near the CPR railway tracks. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans's (DFO) Fish Compensation program required the creation of healthy habitat for fish to replace some that was lost during riverbank repairs undertaken following the 2013 flood. Some fish habitat had been negatively affected by riverbank stabilization projects. The Project undertaken in 2018 included the \\"widening of a river side channel to allow water to flow through year-round\\" the removal and replacement of the pedestrian bridge on the north.The fish habitat compensation project is located near the western boundary of the park, east of 85 ST NW, south of Silver Spring Boulevard NW and southwest of Silver Crest NW. There is a main channel in the Bow River and three smaller channels. This is the area with the south pedestrian bridge and south CPR bridge. This habitat site is near the area where the Canadian Pacific Railway main line cuts across the park, running parallel to the Bow River. ==Wildlife corridor== Bowmont Park is a part of an important wildlife corridor created by a series of closely linked city parks including Nose Hill Park to the east, Edworthy Park and Shouldice Park downstream from Bowmont Park, and Bowness Parkand Baker Parks upstream. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Parks in Calgary ","title":"Bowmont Park"},{"id":"60312118","text":"Jan Dijkstra (14 April 1910, Lemmer – 22 November 1993) was a Dutch politician.

Lucky Baldwin is famous for breeding fine racehorses. Baldwin founded the original Santa Anita Park racetrack on his 46,000 acre Rancho Santa Anita estate. Bragg was approached by a Native American named Soxo who explained he used to work at a gold mine in the 1840s known as the Lost Padre Mine. The Indian offered the doctor a deal. In exchange for two horses, the Indian said he would show Bragg the location of the lost mine. Together they journeyed to the vicinity of the concealed workings but the Indian did not reveal the hidden entrance to the mine. Instead, he showed Bragg an unworked, gold-bearing seam nearby. Bragg decided to mine, but there was a complication right from the start. The outlaw, Bronco Charlie Riley, lived in a cabin nearby, so Bragg took the outlaw on board as part of the crew. Together with Soxo and three Mexican laborers (one of them a child), they started to mine in 1876. Working with hand tools, they dug down on an angle for about forty feet in a vein of decomposing quartz containing pure web and wire gold which became richer with depth. The miners were paid by keeping what they dug out of the mine on one day of each week. The spoils from the other days were retained by Bragg who owned the mine. However, as they dug deeper they encountered problems with water flooding the shaft. To deal with this problem, Bragg had a pump made to special order by Fairbanks Morse in New York that could be operated by mule power. The mining continued from spring to fall for three seasons from 1876 to 1878 until tragedy struck. It is not clear who started the shooting or why, but the only survivors were the outlaw, Bronco Charlie Riley and Bragg who fled the scene on horseback. It is said the cause of the shootings was a single strike worth $93,000 from a particularly rich pocket. After the murders, the mine was covered over and concealed, and the four bodies disappeared without trace. The bodies of the four victims were hidden, but not in the mine itself as the legend claimed. Annie Rose Briggs found the skeletons of the four murdered Bragg miners 52 years later in September 1930. While drunk, the outlaw Riley boasted in public about the incident admitting he carried out the murders. A few days later Riley himself was shot and killed. Without any witnesses, the exact circumstances of his demise are unclear. The Bragg operation was apparently a rich mine, as records from the old Hellman Bank in Los Angeles are said to have showen Bragg made deposits of around $800,000. Bragg had become ill with tuberculosis and never reopened the mine. Bragg died in Los Angeles in 1915. Despite his considerable wealth, he is said to have died a \\"poor man\\". ==Validity== The story of the Dr. B. F. Bragg Mine comes primarily, if not exclusively, from the mining entrepreneur Annie Rose Briggs who staked multiple mining claims covering the entire area where the lost mine was believed to be located. While considerable detail is known about the life of Benjamin Franklin Bragg, there is nothing to indicate Bragg was ever involved in a gold mining enterprise in Bear Canyon. There is also no hard evidence that the young Annie Rose ever meet Bragg as she claims. Moreover, there is nothing to show the outlaw, Bronco Charlie Riley, was a real person. There is no mention in the newspapers of the day of four mine workers being murdered at this alleged mine site in 1878. No mention of an outlaw known as Bronco Charlie Riley. Nor is there any mention of the existence of the mine itself. While Annie Rose Briggs offers a large amount of detailed information about this mining enterprise, no other references can be found in support of the existence of this mine in the historical record. There is a complete absence of cross referencing by any other independent source. Any evidence of the mine's existence, such as it exists, is, at best, highly circumstantial. This strongly suggests that the story of the Dr. B. F. Bragg Mine is purely legend.

Namely, the most widely accepted models of the Big Bang suggest that three times as much primordial lithium, in particular lithium-7, should exist. This contrasts with the observed abundance of isotopes of hydrogen (1H and 2H) and helium (3He and 4He) that are consistent with predictions. The discrepancy is highlighted in a so-called \\"Schramm plot\\", named in honor of astrophysicist David Schramm, which depicts these primordial abundances as a function of cosmic baryon content from standard BBN predictions. CL) and the BBN D + 4He concordance range (wider vertical bands, at 95% CL) should overlap with the observed light element abundances (yellow boxes) to be in agreement. This occurs in 4He and is well constrained in D, but is not the case for 7Li, where the observed Li observations lie a factor of 3−4 below the BBN+WMAP prediction. ==Origin of lithium== Minutes after the Big Bang, the universe was made almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of lithium and beryllium, and negligibly small abundances of all heavier elements. ===Lithium synthesis in the Big Bang=== Big Bang nucleosynthesis produced both lithium-7 and beryllium-7, and indeed the latter dominates the primordial synthesis of mass 7 nuclides. On the other hand, the Big Bang produced lithium-6 at levels more than 1000 times smaller. later decayed via electron capture (half-life 53.22 days) into , so that the observable primordial lithium abundance essentially sums primordial and radiogenic lithium from the decay of . These isotopes are produced by the reactions :{ border=\\"0\\" - style=\\"height:2em;\\"  +  →  +  - style=\\"height:2em;\\"  +  →  +  - style=\\"height:2em;\\" } and destroyed by :{ border=\\"0\\" - style=\\"height:2em;\\"  +  →  +  - style=\\"height:2em;\\"  +  →  +  - style=\\"height:2em;\\" } The amount of lithium generated in the Big Bang can be calculated. Hydrogen-1 is the most abundant nuclide, comprising roughly 92% of the atoms in the Universe, with helium-4 second at 8%. Other isotopes including 2H, 3H, 3He, 6Li, 7Li, and 7Be are much rarer; the estimated abundance of primordial lithium is 10−10 relative to hydrogen. The calculated abundance and ratio of 1H and 4He is in agreement with data from observations of young stars. ===The P-P II branch=== In stars, lithium-7 is made in a proton-proton chain reaction. Proton–proton II chain reaction :{ border=\\"0\\" - style=\\"height:2em;\\"  +  →  +  - style=\\"height:2em;\\"  +  →  +  +  /  - style=\\"height:2em;\\"  +  → 2 } The P-P II branch is dominant at temperatures of 14 to . Stable nuclides of the first few elements ==Observed abundance of lithium== Despite the low theoretical abundance of lithium, the actual observable amount is less than the calculated amount by a factor of 3-4. This contrasts with the observed abundance of isotopes of hydrogen (1H and 2H) and helium (3He and 4He) that are consistent with predictions. Abundances of the chemical elements in the Solar System. Hydrogen and helium are most common, residuals within the paradigm of the Big Bang. Li, Be and B are rare because they are poorly synthesized in the Big Bang and also in stars; the main source of these elements is cosmic ray spallation. Older stars seem to have less lithium than they should, and some younger stars have much more. The lack of lithium in older stars is apparently caused by the \\"mixing\\" of lithium into the interior of stars, where it is destroyed, while lithium is produced in younger stars. Though it transmutes into two atoms of helium due to collision with a proton at temperatures above 2.4 million degrees Celsius (most stars easily attain this temperature in their interiors), lithium is more abundant than current computations would predict in later-generation stars. Nova Centauri 2013 is the first in which evidence of lithium has been found. Lithium is also found in brown dwarf substellar objects and certain anomalous orange stars. Because lithium is present in cooler, less-massive brown dwarfs, but is destroyed in hotter red dwarf stars, its presence in the stars' spectra can be used in the \\"lithium test\\" to differentiate the two, as both are smaller than the Sun. ===Less lithium in Sun-like stars with planets=== Sun-like stars without planets have 10 times the lithium as Sun-like stars with planets in a sample of 500 stars. The Sun's surface layers have less than 1% the lithium of the original formation protosolar gas clouds despite the surface convective zone not being quite hot enough to burn lithium. It is suspected that the gravitational pull of planets might enhance the churning up of the star's surface, driving the lithium to hotter cores where lithium burning occurs. The absence of lithium could also be a way to find new planetary systems. However, this claimed relationship has become a point of contention in the planetary astrophysics community, being frequently denied but also supported. ===Higher than expected lithium in metal-poor stars=== Certain orange stars can also contain a high concentration of lithium. Those orange stars found to have a higher than usual concentration of lithium orbit massive objects—neutron stars or black holes—whose gravity evidently pulls heavier lithium to the surface of a hydrogen-helium star, causing more lithium to be observed. ==Proposed solutions== Possible solutions fall into three broad classes. === Astrophysical solutions === Considering the possibility that BBN predictions are sound, the measured value of the primordial lithium abundance should be in error and astrophysical solutions offer revision to it. For example, systematic errors, including ionization correction and inaccurate stellar temperatures determination could affect Li/H ratios in stars. Furthermore, more observations on lithium depletion remain important since present lithium levels might not reflect the initial abundance in the star. In summary, accurate measurements of the primordial lithium abundance is the current focus of progress, and it could be possible that the final answer does not lie in astrophysical solutions. === Nuclear physics solutions === When one considers the possibility that the measured primordial Lithium abundance is correct and based on the Standard Model of particle physics and the standard cosmology, the lithium problem implies errors in the BBN light element predictions. Although standard BBN rests on well-determined physics, the weak and strong interactions are complicated for BBN and therefore might be the weak point in standard BBN calculation. Firstly, incorrect or missing reactions could give rise to the lithium problem. For incorrect reactions, major thoughts lie within revision to cross section errors and standard thermonuclear rates according to recent studies. Second, starting from Fred Hoyle's discovery of a resonance in carbon-12, an important factor in the triple-alpha process, resonance reactions, some of which might have evaded experimental detection or whose effects have been underestimated, become possible solutions to the lithium problem. === Solutions beyond the Standard Model === Under the assumptions of all correct calculation, solutions beyond the existing Standard Model or standard cosmology might be needed. Dark matter decay and supersymmetry provide one possibility, in which decaying dark matter scenarios introduce a rich array of novel processes that can alter light elements during and after BBN, and find the well-motivated origin in supersymmetric cosmologies. With the fully operational Large Hadron Collider (LHC), much of minimal supersymmetry lies within reach, which would revolutionize particle physics and cosmology if discovered. Changing fundamental constants can be one possible solution, and it implies that first, atomic transitions in metals residing in high-redshift regions might behave differently from our own. Additionally, Standard Model couplings and particle masses might vary; third, variation in nuclear physics parameters is needed. Nonstandard cosmologies indicate variation of the baryon to photon ratio in different regions. One proposal is a result of large-scale inhomogeneities in cosmic density, different from homogeneity defined in the cosmological principle. However, this possibility requires a large amount of observations to test it. == See also == * Big Bang * Halo nucleus * Isotopes of lithium * List of unsolved problems in physics * Lithium burning ==References== Category:Lithium Category:Big Bang Category:Nucleosynthesis ","title":"Cosmological lithium problem"},{"id":"60312598","text":"Copy of a painting by Wilder of U.S. Congressman William D.

Wilder was born on May 22, 1868 in Honolulu, Hawaii, the son of shipping magnate Samuel Gardner Wilder. He had five siblings. Wilder attended Harvard University and Harvard Law School in 1893–1896. Wilder married Sarah Harnden September 12, 1899 in Alameda, California and had two children. His daughter Kinaʻu Wilder (1902–1992) married Charles B. McVay III and had son Kimo Wilder McVay (1927–2001), who managed Don Ho when he popularized the song Tiny Bubbles. ==Background== He became an artist and founded the first Boy Scout troop in Hawaii with D. Howard Hitchcock, another artist who married Wilder's cousin. Wilder was active in Hawaii Scouting and traveled to the eastern United States where he developed Seascouting for older teen scouts and the Pine Tree Patrol System. Seascouting was introduced in 1919. The James A. Wilder Residence built in 1907 in Honolulu is historic. In 1917 Wilder wrote a story titled Knights of the Square Table. This was adapted into a Conquest Pictures film of the same title, in which Wilder played a scoutmaster. The film is held by the Library of Congress. He painted a portrait of Prince Kuhio that hangs in the 'Iolani Palace's throne room and painted U.S. Congressman William D. Thomas.

He collected numerous specimens of animals, insects and plants, and presented them to the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna in his home city for scientific study. He is remembered for having had during his lifetime several taxa named in his honour. ==Biography== Little seems to be known of his life or background. The honorific cavaliere (roughly equivalent to the British 'Sir'; in the Latin- language sources which mention him, eques) suggests that he himself or his family had some civil distinction. He was from Bologna. Either, he travelled to Pernambuco in Brazil, and, on returning by way of Lisbon and Genoa to Bologna, was encouraged by Professor Antonio Bertoloni and by Count Camilla Salina to pursue in Africa his interest in natural history, and travelled to Mozambique; or, the House of Salina took a paternal interest in him, he left Bologna for Lisbon to pursue a career in commerce, and from there he went to Mozambique. He was a trader in ivory. In a letter dated 1843, he said that he had first visited Mozambique twelve years earlier. He was active as a naturalist in the Inhambane area of Mozambique from 1839 or from 1842. He presented the many natural history specimens he collected during his time in Africa to the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna, where they were studied by Antonio Bertoloni (1775-1869, physician and botanist), his son Giuseppe Bertoloni (1804-1874, botanist and entomologist), and Giovanni Giuseppe Bianconi (1809-1878, zoologist, herpetologist, botanist and geologist), all professors at the University of Bologna, all full of praise for his labours. Antonio Alessandrini, another professor at the University, called him 'courageous' (). He was last mentioned in the scientific annals of Bologna in 1866. He does not seem to have written any scientific papers. He is not named as author in any of the journals published by the Academy of Sciences between 1834 and 1866. ==Taxa named in honour== These are (in date order of the epithet fornasini and suchlike): *Anthia fornasinii G.Bertoloni 1845, a ground beetle *Thornback cowfish, Lactoria fornasini Bianconi 1846 (as Ostracion fornasini), a marine fish *Fornasini's blind snake, Afrotyphlops fornasinii Bianconi 1849 (as Typhlops fornasinii) * Fornasini's spiny reed frog, Afrixalus fornasini Bianconi 1849 (as Euchnemis fornasini) *Fornasinia Bertol. 1849, a genus of legume in family Leguminosae * Fornasinia ebenifera Bertol. 1849 (type species), a species in genus Fornasinia * ' Bianconi 1851 (as Menippe fornasinii), a crab in genus ' in family Menippidae * ' G.Bertoloni 1853, a genus of scarab beetle in subfamily Cetoniinae * ' G.Bertoloni 1853 (as Goliathus fornasini; type species), a species in genus Fornasinius *Fulvia fragilis Forsskål in Niebuhr 1775, Cardium fornasinianum Bianconi 1856, a cockle (a shellfish) in genus Fulvia *Eleotris fusca Forster 1801, Eleotris fornasini Bianconi 1856, a freshwater and estuarine fish *Harlequin quail, Coturnix delegorguei Delegorgue 1847, Coturnix fornasini Bianconi 1865, a bird ==Notes== ==References== Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:1800s births Category:People from Bologna Category:1865 deaths Category:Date of death unknown Category:Place of death unknown Category:Italian botanists Category:Italian zoologists Category:19th-century botanists Category:19th-century zoologists Category:Italian merchants Category:19th-century merchants Category:19th-century Italian businesspeople ","title":"Carlo Antonio Fornasini"},{"id":"60312638","text":"Beverly Jacques Anderson (born September 10, 1943) is an American mathematician and emeritus professor at the University of the District of Columbia. In the 1990s she worked at the National Academy of Sciences as Director of Minority Programs for the Mathematical Sciences Education Board, and led the Making Mathematics Work for Minorities program. == Early life and education == Anderson grew up in the 7th Ward of New Orleans in a time of segregation. She was born to Alvin Joseph and Dorothy Ann, who never finished high school. Anderson attended Valena C. Jones Normal School, an elementary school. She attended a high school for African-Americans, where she excelled in mathematics. She earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics at Dillard University. She was the first member of her family to leave New Orleans when she moved to Howard University for graduate school. She completed a PhD at the Catholic University of America in 1978. == Research and career == Anderson was began teaching Mathematics at the University of the District of Columbia in 1969. She was awarded one of the faculty awards from the White House Initiative for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. She took a leave of absence to join the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences in 1988, where she launched the Making Mathematics Work for Minorities program. The program had three aims: to attract national attention to the need for minority students in mathematics, to identify best practice in mathematics education for minority students and develop a national strategy and alliance to improve mathematics education. She ran a series of workshops around the country, sharing ideas about how to help minorities excel in mathematics. Anderson argued that teaching mathematics without acknowledging the cultural bias that favoured students aligned with European tradition could significantly disadvantage people of colour. Anderson identified that minority students enrolled in two-year college programs were 20% less likely to earn a bachelor's degree than those who started in four-year programs. She emphasized that school mathematics programs needed to be maintained long-term, for magnet schools to support the teaching profession and for comprehensive four-year college programs. In her 40-year career at the University of the District of Columbia, Anderson was a Professor of Mathematics, Mathematics Department Chair, and Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. She was made Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs in 1997; however her appointment as provost was rescinded in 1999 after it was deemed to have been made without a proper search. She remained as a consultant on the National Academy of Sciences mathematics education program, serving as a consultant for the Everybody Counts report in 2000. In 2013 Anderson was appointed to the Prince George's County School Board. == References == Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:African-American mathematicians Category:University of the District of Columbia faculty Category:Dillard University alumni Category:Howard University alumni Category:Catholic University of America alumni ","title":"Beverly Anderson"},{"id":"60312644","text":"Maia Cruz Palileo is an interdisciplinary artist based in Brooklyn, New York. Her work consists of paintings, drawings and sculptures, and explores her Filipino-American heritage through the examination of memory, family photographs, and oral histories. == Background and education == Maia Cruz Palileo was born in 1979 in Chicago, Illinois, to parents who had emigrated from the Philippines. She received a BA in studio art at Mount Holyoke College (2001), and an MFA from Brooklyn College (2008). She attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in 2015. The death of Palileo's mother, in 1999, affected her profoundly. She described the event as \\"completely severing my connection to home, both geographically and psychologically. My naïve sense of wholeness and security was changed forever and I’ve been making work about it ever since.” == Work == Palileo is best known for her paintings. Her work has been described as a cultural and historical pastiche that has a \\"tropical gothic\\" aesthetic, a term associated with the Filipino writer Nick Joaquin. Cora Fisher of ArtForum writes that Palileo's paintings are \\"redolent with history but not beholden to it. The artist’s figures, emancipated from their source material, now look back at us as part of her decolonized imagination.\\" In her exhibition \\"Curves of a Meandering Creek\\" at PioneerWorks, Palileo examined the Philippines' legacy of colonialism. The imagery for this body of work was rooted in 19th Century colonialist culture, which she researched at the Newberry Library in Chicago. The ethnographic photographs of Dean Conant Worcester, the watercolors of Damian Domingo, and a text by Isabelo de los Reyes, were all sources that she used in the work, ultimately transforming the narratives. == Exhibitions == Palileo has had solo exhibitions at Monique Meloche Gallery, Taymour Grahne Gallery, Pioneer Works, Cuchifritos Gallery + Project Space, and Soapbox Gallery. She has participated in group exhibitions at Yutaka Kikutake Gallery, the Rubin Museum of Art, Skylab Gallery, Alfred University, the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art, and the CUE Art Foundation. == Recognition == Palileo has received grants from the Rema Hort Mann Foundation, the Joan Mitchell Foundation , the New York Foundation for the Arts, the Jerome Foundation, and the Astraea Visual Arts Fund.

On 14 December 1886 at the Great Synagogue in London he married Russian-born Rose Hast (1860-1934), daughter of Rev. Marcus Hast, the celebrated Reader of that synagogue,Francis Lyon Cohen in the England & Wales, Civil Registration Marriage Index, 1837-1915 - Ancestry.com and with her had three children: Harold Reuben Cohen, Basil H Cohen and Dulcie M Cohen.Francis Lyon Cohen in the 1901 London Census - Ancestry.com In 1886 he was appointed a tutor in Jews' College; in 1892 he became acting chaplain to the Jews in the British army; and in 1896 staff chaplain to the Jewish Lads' Brigade, the formation of which he was the first to advocate. He has also acted as editor to the choir committee of the United Synagogue. Cohen organized military services on Ḥanukkah at his own and other synagogues, and altogether did much to promote the patriotic and military ardour of English Jews. With B. L. Mosely he was the author of A Handbook of Synagogue Music for Congregational Singing (1889) and, with David M. Davis, of The Voice of Prayer and Praise (1899 and 1914), affectionally known as ‘The Blue Book’. In addition, he wrote numerous articles on Jewish music, among which have been: 'Synagogue Music; Its History and Character' in The Jewish Chronicle (1883); 'The Rise and Development of Synagogue Music' (1887); 'Synagogue Plain-Song' in The Organist and Choirmaster (1897); 'La Revue de Chant Grégorien' (Marseilles, 1899); 'Song in the Synagogue' in The Musical Times (London, 1899), and 'Traditional Hebrew Melodies' (1896).Text from the article 'Francis Lyon Cohen' - The Jewish Encyclopedia (1906) Under his own name and the nom de plume Asaph Klesmer he wrote articles in the Jewish press and for the commemorative volume of the Anglo-Jewish Historical Exhibition (1887) and the Jewish Historical Society of England (1894). ==Jewish Lads' Brigade== In April 1891 The Jewish Chronicle published a letter from Cohen headed ´But what about the boys?´ in which he called for the creation of a Jewish youth group based on the Boys' Brigade for the well-being of working-class Jewish boys in the East End of London at the important period ´\\"Between their leaving school and their attainment of manhood\\". Colonel Albert Goldsmid brought this idea to fruition in 1895 with the formation of the Jewish Lads' Brigade with which Cohen served as staff chaplain from 1896.'A good Jew and a good Englishman' - Jewish Lads´ Brigade - British Jews in the First World War ==Military chaplain (1892-1904)== Cohen leading a military Hanukkah service in 1901 Jews were only recognised in the British Army as a distinct religious group from 1889. The Visitation Committee of the United Synagogue were responsible for the religious welfare and spiritual needs of Jews in public bodies and it decided to include serving members of the British Forces in its remit and applied to the War Office for the appointment of a Jewish military chaplain. This request was granted in 1892 when Cohen, then the minister of the Borough Synagogue, became the first Jewish chaplain to the British Army; following this Lord Rothschild gave him a letter of introduction to General Sir Evelyn Wood, who was in charge of the Camp at AldershotFrancis L Cohen – Britain’s First Jewish Chaplain - Biography by Rabbi Dr Raymond Apple AO, RFD - Emeritus Rabbi of the Great Synagogue, Sydney and who appointed Cohen as chaplain to Jewish troops at Aldershot.Cohen and the Borough Synagogue - Synagogue Scribes Jewish Genealogy Having been born and brought up in Aldershot at a time when the town was rapidly growing due to the arrival of the British Army Cohen was already very familiar with military life. At first the duties of the Jewish chaplain were part-time and in December 1893 Cohen initiated an annual Hanukkah military service, holding the first in his own Borough Synagogue; by the time of the Boer War these were attended by the Lord Mayor of London, the Aldermen of London and the Chief Rabbi. He also attended summer camps on Salisbury Plain where he conducted services for Jewish soldiers, later involving senior students of Jews’ College in helping to conduct these services, which were eventually transferred to Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. Cohen wrote a letter to The Jewish Chronicle publicising these services and asking Jewish servicemen and their relatives to contact him and declare their religion. At the same time, in an attempt to quell allegations that Jews were not patriotic, Cohen launched a campaign to encourage Jews to enlist in the army and navy, believing that only through joining the forces could the Jewish community prove its loyalty to Britain. Of the reluctance of Jewish servicemen to identify themselves Cohen wrote: > \\"I had noticed, in my boyhood near Aldershot Camp, that Jewish soldiers and > sailors almost invariably concealed their origin because of outside > prejudices, and still more through their own people’s feeling about the > difficulties in observing certain religious duties, and the dislike of all > uniforms so natural in our people who had come to England from countries > where authority condones such cruel oppression.” In 1895 he was able to report: > \\"About thirty-two Jewish regulars and militia-men at Aldershot, and twenty- > eight at other stations, have come under my notice during two years of > officiation, quite fifty of whom are at present serving in the army.

Cohen held the position of music editor of The Jewish Encyclopedia (1901–06) and Jewish chaplain to the British Army from 1892 to 1904, in which year he prepared to leave for Australia to take up the position of Chief Minister of the Great Synagogue in Sydney; he was succeeded as Jewish chaplain by Rev Michael Adler. ==Great Synagogue in Sydney== Cohen was Chief Minister of the Great Synagogue in Sydney for nearly 30 years Wishing for a new challenge in 1904 Cohen was appointed as Chief Minister of the Great Synagogue in Sydney, the mother congregation of Jewry in Australia. Before leaving Britain for this new role Cohen had to attain full rabbinical qualifications so that he could lead the Sydney Beth Din but he did not find it easy to gain them as obstacles were placed in his way, perhaps out of jealousy at his previous achievements or perhaps out of suspicion that in some areas of his ministry he had not been a strict traditionalist. In the Great Synagogue he was to show that the suspicion was correct.Raymond Apple, The Great Synagogue: A History of Sydney's Big Shule, UNSW Press (2008) - Google Books pgs. 85-91 Eventually Cohen gained the necessary rabbinical qualifications and on settling in Sydney in 1905 with his family he was the first and, for most of his ministry, the only minister in Sydney with semikhah. The Jewish population of Sydney was about 4,000, with about 700 regularly attending the Great Synagogue. Cohen was opposed to Zionism and, despite the origins of his own parents, to Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe. He early gave an indication of his stance by referring to \\"the extremes\\" of Orthodoxy and Reform, and stating his belief that his congregation stood \\"perhaps midway between the extremes\\". He was not opposed to the continuation of the mixed choir nor to the removal of the bimah from its central position to a place near the Ark to accommodate more seats. In 1907 he introduced the military Hanukkah service he had pioneered in Britain and which continued for several years. During his nearly thirty years as Chief Minister of the Great Synagogue Cohen was active in all facets of Jewish life including being President of the New South Wales Board of Jewish Education, a founder of the New South Wales Jewish War Memorial and being involved in developing suburban synagogues. He worked for such philanthropic institutions as the Chevra Kadisha, the Sir Moses Montefiore Home for the aged and the local branch of the Anglo-Jewish Association; he was also involved in the Jewish Literary and Debating Society of Sydney. In 1928 he published the Jubilee History of the Great Synagogue, Sydney. He was an active Freemason. Having grown up in Aldershot surrounded as a boy by the pomp and pageantry of mid-Victorian military life Cohen never lost his great love for the Army and patriotism for Empire and was described by Rabbi Raymond Apple as \\"the passionate patriot\\"Raymond Apple, Francis Lyon Cohen - \\"the passionate patriot\\", Australian Jewish Historical Society Journal, Vol. XII, Part 4, August 1995, pgs. 663-747Serge Liberman, The Bibliography of Australasian Judaica 1788-2008 - Google Books and as \\"A tireless promoter of the model 'Anglo-Jewish gentleman', one proudly loyal to his ancestral religion yet fully and patriotically integrated into wider society...\\" He joined the Australian National Defence League and was appointed chaplain of the Australian Military Forces in 1909. During World War I he was vice-president of the Universal Service League and encouraged Jews to enlist in the Australian militias and strongly supported conscription. In 1929 he was awarded the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration (VD). Francis Lyon Cohen died of cancer in hospital at Potts Point in Sydney in 1934 aged 71 and was buried in Rookwood Cemetery, Rookwood, Sydney, New South Wales.Francis Lyon Cohen - The Dictionary of Sydney His wife Rose, who had been very involved in the Jewish community in Sydney, died the same year.

The match ended in a 2–2 draw with Penn State and San Francisco sharing the title. The game was used to determine the champion of the 1949 ISFA season, which predated the NCAA as the premier organizing body of collegiate soccer, and represented the concluding game of the season for both teams. == Background == Soccer had been played at the American collegiate level since at least the late 1860s, with variations of a kicking game being played since the mid-1840s. Organized collegiate soccer did not formally occur in the United States until the arrival of the Intercollegiate Soccer Football League, which began in 1904. The ISFL determined national championships for college programs from 1905 until 1925, and from 1926 until 1940 the Intercollegiate Soccer Football Association of America determined national champions. These championship titles were determined by a selection committee and were largely subjective. These championships are not formally recognized by the NCAA as legitimate national championship claims. Throughout World War II and into the late 1940s, the ISFAA did not claim any national championships, although several college programs with undefeated records, or teams atop the NSCAA poll claimed national championships during this time, causing numerous programs to stake championship claims in the same year. After World War II, the ISFA began declaring national championships, which drew ire from programs that felt they deserved a national championship title, but were not considered by the ISFA committee. The goal of the Soccer Bowl was to take the highest ranked NSCAA and ISFA teams to have them play a one off match at a neutral venue. The concept of a neutral venue and titling the match as a \\"bowl\\" was heavy inspired and barrowed from the bowl game system that college American football uses. == Route to the bowl == === Penn State === === San Francisco === San Francisco ended the regular season with a perfect 10–0–0 record with a 6–0–0 record in the Northern California Intercollegiate Soccer Conference. In the championship game for the NCISC title, San Francisco defeated UCLA, 3–1, to win the title. Ahead of the Soccer Bowl, the Dons played an exhibition match against a semi-professional team known as the Los Angeles Aztecs (unrelated to the NASL Aztecs), and tied 2–2. The San Francisco soccer teams of the mid 20th century were known for recruiting international talent, partially due to the city's cosmopolitan and international recognition. While the team was traveling from San Francisco to St. Louis, the team was going out to dinner at a local restaurant in the area. The waiter refused to serve San Francisco's Olifumni Osibogu, a black Nigerian player on the team. Head coach, Gus Donoghue, rounded up the team and the left the restaurant and went to a hotel and restaurant in East St. Louis, Illinois, where integration was allowed. == The Match == In the 1940s through 1950s, college soccer in the United States was played in four 22-minute quarters, partially in an effort to Americanize the sport to prevent alienating spectators. The match drew a crowd of 4,500 spectators at Sportsman's Park. The match was played in partly cloudy conditions, with unseasonably warm weather for winter. The high temperature that day was 61°F and at kick off the temperature was around 56°F. The first goal of the match was scored by San Francisco's Dick Baptista. Penn State's Harry Little scored the tying goal off of a deflected shot. Baptista would score the go-ahead goal later in the match to give San Francisco the 2–1 lead. The match remained that scoreline until late into the fourth quarter. The center official allowed for six minutes of stoppage time, and with 10 seconds left in the match, the center referee, Harry Lyons, awarded a penalty kick to Penn State. Several San Francisco players protested saying that there was no handball to prompt the penalty kick. Penn State's Little would score the tying penalty kick ending the match in a 2–2 draw. It has been disputed as to whether or not the match was agreed to end in a draw, or if San Francisco refused to play overtime against Penn State. Nevertheless, the 1st Soccer Bowl was declared to be a share title between Penn State and San Francisco, a national title both programs, the ISFA, as well as the American Soccer History Archives, recognize. === Details === { width=92% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"40%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK   George Lawther - FB   William Yerkes - FB   Chuck Margolf - HB   Dick Hannah - HB   Ralph Hosterman - HB   Will Kraybill - QL   Ray Buss - IL   Ron Coleman - C   Joseph Lane - IR   Harry Little - OR   Ted Lieb - colspan=3Substitutes: - OR   Harry Lawroski - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3 Bill Jeffrey } valign=\\"top\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%; margin:auto\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK   Angelo Carmassi - FB   Stephen Negoesco - FB   Carlos Diaz - HB   Olifumni Osibogu - HB   Robert Lee - HB   Charles Heredia - QL   Joe Matute - IL   Henry Kirner - C   Dick Baptista - IR   Mario Ugarte - OR   Luis Ugarte - colspan=3Substitutes: - HB   Mark Steinberg - QL   Tony Ragusla - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3 Gus Donoghue } } { width=100% style=\\"font-size:90%\\"  Assistant referee: Justin Keeney (United States) style=\\"width:60%; vertical-align:top;\\" Match rules: *88 minutes. *Four 22-minute quarters *Unlimited substitutes } == See also == * Soccer Bowl (1950-52) * Intercollegiate Soccer Football Association * Soccer in St. Louis == References == == External links == * Penn State Men's Soccer * San Francisco Men's Soccer Championship Game 1950 Category:1950 in sports in Missouri Category:Penn State Nittany Lions men's soccer Category:San Francisco Dons men's soccer Category:January 1950 sports events ","title":"1950 Soccer Bowl"},{"id":"60312816","text":"Fallen Legion is a role-playing video game series developed by Indonesian studio Mintsphere and YummyYummyTummy.

The violence came in the aftermath of the Malian government cracking down on Islamic terror cells in the country. Two villages, Ogossagou and Welingara, were particularly affected. The massacre caused large protests in Mali against the government's perceived inaction, and led to the resignation of Prime Minister Soumeylou Boubèye Maïga and his ruling council. == Background == The Fulani herdsmen have been increasingly in conflict and competition with other groups over land and water access for their cattle. These conflicts are exacerbated by climate change, land degradation, and population growth. According to African Arguments, \\"Even though only a fraction of all Fulani are actively supporting such Islamist groups, this propaganda has succeeded in associating whole communities with these violent actors, further escalating the circle of violence.\\" == Attacks == The attacks took place in the Fulani villages of Ogossagou and Welingara. According to local Malian officials, the attacks were carried out by Dogon hunters armed with firearms and machetes. The attackers accused the Fulani villagers of having ties to jihadists and stated the attack was in retaliation for an al- Qaeda attack on a Malian military base the prior week which left 23 Malian soldiers dead. Witnesses stated that nearly every hut in the villages had been burned to the ground. == Aftermath == In the aftermath, Mali president Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta fired army chief of staff General M'Bemba Moussa Keita and chief of land forces General Abdrahamane Baby. The United Nations announced that on 26 March they would send in a crime-scene investigation team. President Keïta ordered the ethnic Dogon militia thought to be responsible for the attack, Dan Na Ambassagou, to be dissolved. Human Rights Watch has also accused the militia of being responsible, though the head of the group has denied it. The UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Adama Dieng, warned of a growing ethnicization of the conflict. They noted that on 26 March six Dogon villagers were killed and a further 20 abducted by suspected Fulani armed elements in the hamlets of Ouadou and Kere Kere. On 30 March, Mali detained five suspected attackers who had previously been treated as survivors of the assault. Thousands of citizens protested on 5 April against the Malian government's failure to stem religious and ethnic violence. Under the growing threat of a no-confidence vote, the government of Prime Minister Soumeylou Boubèye Maïga collapsed and President Keïta accepted Maïga's resignation on 18 April. Heavily armed members of Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM), the leading Islamist group in Mali, attacked an army base in west-central Mali on 22 April. The militants called it partial revenge for the Ogossagou massacre and claimed that 16 soldiers had been killed, although the Malian Defence Ministry put the death toll at 11.

The guy who wrote \\"Milwaukee Poop Poop Poop\\" (and 20,000 other songs) wrote a song about me and now I'm complete, Milwaukee Record His music is released under a variety of band names. ==Biography== Farley grew up in Massachusetts and graduated from Providence College in Rhode Island. Around 2008, he discovered that songs with silly titles from his band \\"Moes Haven\\" (which he had streaming on Spotify) were the only ones generating revenue. He soon began writing and recording songs about everything and anything that he thought people might search for. His band names, which exceed 70, often correlate to the subject matter of their songs. For example, \\"Papa Razzi and the Photogs\\" release albums filled with songs about celebrities, and \\"The Hungry Food Band\\" releases songs about food. Thousands of songs celebrate birthdays with different names. Over 500 songs are \\"prom proposals\\" songs each sung with a different name. Yet another series of albums are composed completely of songs about towns within a U.S. state or other country, with lyrics derived from reading Wikipedia articles on each town. However, his most lucrative band is likely the \\"Toilet Bowl Cleaners\\", who sing songs about fecal matter. According to Farley, one song that contains only the word \\"poop\\" repeated over and over generates $500 in streaming revenue every month likely in part because children request it from Alexa or other devices. Farley earned over $23,000 in 2013 from his song catalog. Farley also writes custom songs, generating $2,000 or more in revenue per month. The Reply All podcast has featured Farley multiple times and used his custom songs. Much of Farley's output is piano-and-vocals compositions. Albums can run to 100 songs in length. Some of his albums, even from a band such as The Toilet Bowl Cleaners, contain more serious output; that band's 11th album is titled Mature Love Songs, none of which are about fecal matter. Farley's serious and non- lucrative albums are called \\"no jokes\\" albums.Decloux, Justin (11 June 2018). The Best Music of Matt Farley (in Five Albums), Film Trap In 2016, Farley performed \\"Used to Be a Pizza Hut\\", a song topic derived from internet traffic about how re-purposed locations of the American chain restaurant still retain their distinctive roof style, on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. ==Music label and films== Farley's output is released under the label Motern Media, and he is rarely identified directly by name. Farley often includes his personal phone number in his lyrics, which yields calls and texts from fans surprised to find the number is real. Farley has made several low-budget comedy-horror films, primarily starring his family and friends, with titles such as Freaky Farley (2007), Don't Let the Riverbeast Get You (2012), Slingshot Cops (2016).

G. Pine, ed., Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry, (London: Burke's Peerage Ltd, 1952), p. 1,939 He was educated at Gresham's School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he earned a degree in economics and a blue for field hockey. After Second World War service in the Royal Engineers, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, in 1946 Layton was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire.Burke's Peerage, vol. 2 (2003), p. 2,267 He was an executive of the National Coal Board from 1946 to 1963, taking a break from that to serve on the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, in 1952–1953.The Times House of Commons 1964 (Times Office, 1964), p. 109 After leaving the National Coal Board, Layton spent a year with the Acton Society Trust, in his own words \\"preparing a study of the shortcomings of published information on wages and conditions of work\\", which was published in 1965.David Layton, Wages — fog or facts? (1965), p. 5 At the 1964 general election, he stood as the Liberal parliamentary candidate for Battersea South, coming third, as expected, to the Labour and Conservative candidates. He did not stand again, but nevertheless kept up close links with the Liberal Party. In 1966 Layton founded Incomes Data Services, an independent research organization offering information and advice for those determining pay and employment policies in the United Kingdom. When the British government began to insist that all collective agreements should be legally binding, Layton advised parties to write the words \\"Tina Lea\\" on all collective agreements, an acronym standing for This is Not a Legally Enforceable Agreement.Alastair Hatchett, David Layton obituary in The Guardian dated 29 September 2009 During a miners' strike in February 1974, Layton pointed out that figures being used to compare miners' pay with other workers' pay were flawed, as the National Coal Board was including holiday pay in earnings for miners, but not in the figures for the pay of others. The front page of the London Evening Standard called Layton \\"the man who did his sums\\", and the revelation had a large impact on the dispute. In 1979 Layton met Max Nicholson, a founder of the World Wildlife Fund, and went on to establish Environmental Data Services and The ENDS Report, an early attempt to engage British business with environmental protection. This was largely funded by Layton and consumed much of his energy, and within ten years had become a successful business led by Marek Mayer. In its obituary, The Guardian said of Layton \\"He was full of fun, often rather mischievous and perfectly at ease challenging nonsense.\\" He was also an enthusiastic sportsman and was still walking the Lake District hills in his early nineties. ==Private life== Layton married firstly in April 1939 (Joan) Elizabeth Gray, a Girton College, Cambridge, graduate and daughter of the Rev. Robert Miller Gray,Girton College Register: 1869-1946 (Girton College, 1948), p. 476 with whom he had three children, Jonathan (now 4th Baron Layton), Mark and Hilary. They separated in 1966.
