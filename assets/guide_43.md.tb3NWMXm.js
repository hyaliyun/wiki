He was captain of the 64-gun Ajax in Suffren's squadron in the Indian Ocean during the War of American Independence, and fought at the Battle of Sadras on 17 February 1782. == Biography == Bouvet-Pr√©court was a French officer. He served in the French East India Company, making 12 journeys in 18 years and 2 months. He was the father of Fran√ßois Joseph Bouvet de Pr√©court. He served in the French Royal Navy under Admiral d'Ach√© in 1758 and 1759, rising to Captain. On 16 February 1780, Bouvet departed Lorient at the command of the 64-gun Ajax, along with Prot√©e, √âl√©phant and Charmante, escorting a convoy bound for India. In late February, off Spain, the convoy met Rodney's fleet; Prot√©e sacrificed herself to hold the British back and was captured on 24, while Charmante returned to Lorient, arriving on 3 March, and the convoy escaped under the protection of Ajax. At the Battle of Sadras, on 17 February 1782, Suffren ordered Ajax and Flamand, under Cuverville, to attack the British line to leeward. They both maneuvered to this effect, but then Tromelin, on Annibal, countermanded the order by signaling Ajax and Flamand to return to their post in the line of battle. While Ajax obeyed the order, Flamand sailed on and Saint-F√©lix, of Brillant, requested permission to replace Ajax. After the battle, Suffren apologised to Bouvet for the confusion in his orders that had frustrated him from a prime role in the battle, promising to make up for it at the next occasion. However, Bouvet's age and failing health limited his ability to fight. In the following months, his health deteriorated further. In the run-up to the Battle of Negapatam on 6 July 1782, Bouvet requested authorisation to retreat to harbour to effect repairs because the rigging of Ajax had been damaged by a gale the night before. When Suffren refused, Ajax remained with her squadron but without taking part in the action. Suffren was furious. Later in July, Suffren appointed Lieutenant de Beaumont le Ma√Ætre to replace Bouvet. Suffren described Bouvet as \\"very ill\\" and \\"senile\\". Bouvet went to found passage from Cuddalore to Trincomalee, where he hoped to find a ship to Isle de France (Mauritius), but he died in Trincomalee from scurvy. == Sources and references == Notes References Bibliography * * * Category:French Navy officers Category:1715 births Category:1782 deaths ","title":"Ren√© Joseph Bouvet de Pr√©court"},{"id":"63773649","text":"The tower of Hanoi puzzle A Hanoi graph The Tower of Hanoi ‚Äì Myths and Maths is a book in recreational mathematics, on the tower of Hanoi, baguenaudier, and related puzzles. It was written by Andreas M. Hinz, Sandi Klav≈æar, Uro≈° Milutinoviƒá, and Ciril Petr, and published in 2013 by Birkh√§user, with an expanded second edition in 2018. The Basic Library List Committee of the Mathematical Association of America has suggested its inclusion in undergraduate mathematics libraries. ==Topics== Although this book is in recreational mathematics, it takes its subject seriously, and brings in material from automata theory, computational complexity, the design and analysis of algorithms, graph theory, and group theory, topology, fractal geometry, chemical graph theory, and even psychology (where related puzzles have applications in psychological testing). The 1st edition of the book had 10 chapters, and the 2nd edition has 11. In both cases they begin with chapter zero, on the background and history of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, covering its real-world invention by √âdouard Lucas and in the mythical backstory he invented for it. Chapter one considers the Baguenaudier puzzle (or, as it is often called, the Chinese rings), related to the tower of Hanoi both in the structure of its state space and in the fact that it takes an exponential number of moves to solve, and likely the inspiration for Lucas. Chapter two introduces the main topic of the book, the tower of Hanoi, in its classical form in which one must move disks one-by-one between three towers, always keeping the disks on each tower sorted by size. It provides several different algorithms for solving the classical puzzle (in which the disks begin and end all on a single tower) in as few moves as possible, and for collecting all disks on a single tower when they begin in other configurations, again as quickly as possible. It introduces the Hanoi graphs describing the state space of the puzzle, and relates numbers of puzzle steps to distances within this graph. After a chapter on \\"irregular\\" puzzles in which the initial placement of disks on their towers is not sorted, chapter four discusses the \\"Sierpi≈Ñski graphs\\" derived from the Sierpi≈Ñski triangle; these are closely related to the three-tower Hanoi graphs but diverge from them for higher numbers of towers of Hanoi or higher-dimensional Sierpinski fractals. The next four chapters concern additional variants of the tower of Hanoi, in which more than three towers are used, the disks are only allowed to move between some of the towers or in restricted directions between the towers, or the rules for which disks can be placed on which are modified or relaxed. A particularly important case is the Reve's puzzle, in which the rules are unchanged except that there are four towers instead of three. An old conjecture concerning the minimum possible number of moves between two states with all disks on a single tower was finally proven in 2014, after the publication of the first edition of the book, and the second edition includes this material. Some of the definitions and proofs are extended into the book's many exercises. A new chapter in the second edition provides hints and partial solutions, and the final chapter collects open problems and (in the second edition) provides updates to previously-listed problems. Many color illustrations and photographs are included throughout the book. ==Audience== The book can be read both by mathematicians working on topics related to the tower of Hanoi puzzle, and by a general audience interested in recreational mathematics. Reviewer L√°szl√≥ Kozma describes the book as essential reading for the first type of audience and (despite occasional heavy notation and encyclopedic detail) accessible and interesting to the second type, even for readers with only a high school level background in mathematics. On the other hand, reviewer Cory Palmer cautions that \\"this book is not for a casual reader\\", adding that a good understanding of combinatorics is necessary to read it, and reviewer Charles Ashbacher suggests that it has enough depth of content to be the topic of an advanced undergraduate elective course. Although generally positive, reviewer S. V. Nagaraj complains about a \\"significant number of errors\\" in the book. Reviewer Andrew Percy calls it \\"an enjoyable adventure\\", \\"humorous, and very thorough\\". Reviewer Martin Klazar calls the book \\"wonderful\\", recommending it to anyone interested in recreational mathematics or mathematics more generally. ==References== ==External links== *Home page Category:Mechanical puzzles Category:Mathematics books Category:2013 non-fiction books Category:2018 non- fiction books ","title":"The Tower of Hanoi ‚Äì Myths and Maths"},{"id":"63773669","text":"Li Xifu (; 1909 ‚Äì 29 May 1976) was a Chinese military officer who served as general in the People's Liberation Army.

It was printed in London and dropped from hydrogen-filled, free-floating paper balloons on the Western Front over France and Belgium. The newspaper was the product of a division of the British Military Intelligence Service, known as MI7b. The first issue appeared on April 6, 1917. A propaganda magazine of the same name was also used by the British side against Germany during the Second World War. Preparation for a balloon launch with attached propaganda material The aim of the newspaper was to provide the residents of the occupied territories with accurate information about the course of the war from an Allied perspective. In addition, texts were printed from documents that had been suppressed by the German side because they would have left a negative impression, such as reports of German defeats and losses. This was also intended to indoctrinate German front line soldiers. The average number of copies of the newspaper delivered each week was 5000 pieces. The newspapers were first grouped in bundles of 100 copies each and then fixed at small spacings to a kind of fuse attached to the balloon. Before releasing the balloons, the fuse was lit and then slowly burned down. Little by little, the individual fastenings of the bundles came loose and more and more newspapers were released. Within about 30 minutes approximately 2000 copies could be distributed over the country in this way. Prior to this, two trucks brought the balloons with the propaganda material to a favourable location, which had been chosen after consultation with a meteorologist. If the wind blew in the direction of Belgium or France, the magazine Le Courrier de l'Air was tied to the balloon. If it blew in the direction of Germany, propaganda sheets for the enemy troops were attached. The content of the newspaper essentially covered four main topics. The first one commented on current events before they were forgotten. Secondly, it dealt with issues relating to Germany, the enemy of the war, such as criticism from German newspapers. Thirdly, bizarre and comical stories about the Germans were disseminated, in particular describing their weaknesses and allegedly immoral actions. German institutions and war regulations were also the subject of mockery. Finally, there were editorials on current issues, taken from important newspapers or from the editorial staff itself. All articles were first prepared in English and then translated into French. The newspaper Le Courrier de l'Air, like other British propaganda material, is considered a very successful measure to strengthen the morale of the population in the occupied territories or to attack that of German soldiers. German newspapers, especially during the last two months of the war, constantly reported on the \\"poisoned arrows from the air\\", as the propaganda sheets were called. On November 2, 1918, an excerpt from a letter in the \\"K√∂lner Amtsblatt\\" was published in all London newspapers. In it a high German official complained about the enemy propaganda: \\"What caused the greatest damage was the paperwork of our enemies, who flooded us daily with several hundred thousand leaflets, exceptionally well presented and edited.\\" During the last months of the war, the German side attempted to prevent the newspaper from spreading through rigorous punitive measures. For example, possession of the newspaper or the distribution of news from it was punishable by a fine of 10,000 marks in addition to a year's imprisonment. The last official edition of the newspaper appeared on November 7, 1918 and bore the number 78. A complete set of all editions (No. 1 - No. 78) can be seen today in the British Museum in London. == Sources == * https://www.psywar.org/content/courrier Edward Heron-Allenby: A report on the WWI leaflet-newspaper Le Courrier de l'Air * http://www.psywarrior.com/WWIAllies.html Herbert A.

Fiete builds theoretical models and analyses neural data and to uncover how neural circuits perform computations and how the brain represents and manipulates information involved in memory and reasoning. == Early Life and Education == Fiete was born in Mumbai, India. She pursued her undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan, majoring in mathematics and physics. Fiete then moved to Boston to pursue her masters and graduate studies at Harvard University in the Department of Physics. Fiete was mentored in computational neuroscience by Sebastian Seung at MIT and in physics by Daniel Fisher at Harvard. In her graduate degree, Fiete explored the principles of learning and coding in biological neural networks. Fiete completed her graduate studies in 2003, and moved across the country to hold an appointment as a postdoctoral fellow at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara from 2004 until 2006. During this time, Fiete was also a visiting member of the Center for Theoretical Biophysics at the University of California, San Diego. From 2006 to 2008, Fiete served as a Broad Fellow in Brain Circuitry at Caltech under the mentorship of Christof Koch. === Graduate Work - Coding in Biological Neural Circuits === During her graduate studies, Fiete and her colleagues used linear networks of learning to show that sparse temporal neural codes minimize synaptic interference and facilitate learning in songbirds. Fiete then began to explore the computational principles underlying synaptic plasticity. She proposed a synaptic reinforcement rule to perform goal-directed learning in recurrent networks of rate-based and spiking neurons. The rule performs stochastic gradient ascent on the reward. Specifically, if the reward signal quantifies network performance then the plasticity rule is able to drive goal- directed learning in the network. Fiete applied her model to neurophysiological data of songbirds and found that the trial-and-error based learning rule was fast enough to explain learning in songbirds. === Grid Cells === When Fiete started her postdoctoral research, she began to study the coding principles of cells in the brain that encode location. In 2006, Fiete and her colleagues described a framework to understand the computations of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, and how they encode the positions of rats. They showed that the representation is analogous to a residue number system, which allows a small number of cells to represent and update a rat's position over large distances or multiple environments. This hypothesis is very different from others of how coding is performed in the brain, and this ‚Äúarithmetic-friendly‚Äù numeral system highlights the ingenuity of neural codes. == Career and Research == In 2008, Fiete joined the faculty at the University of Texas at Austin. While at UT Austin, Fiete made a significant impact on the community as both a researcher and an educator, receiving the 2013 CNS Excellence Award for Teaching from the College of Natural Sciences University of Texas, Austin. After serving on the faculty for 10 years and founding the Center for Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience there, in 2018 Fiete accepted an offer from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and became an Associate Professor with tenure within the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. In early 2019, Fiete joined the McGovern Institute at MIT as an Associate Investigator. In May 2020, Fiete was promoted to Full Professor in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT. Fiete's research program is centered around understanding why the brain contains particular coding properties and how the connectivity and dynamics of neural circuits and synaptic plasticity underlie such coding principals. Her lab uses numerical and theoretical modelling as well as raw neural data with which to test their models of brain computations. === Grid Cell Computations === Fiete and her colleagues at UT Austin were interested in exploring the neural computations underlying grid cells in the entorhinal cortex. Grid cells are known to encode spatial location in mammals as they wander through the world. Fiete and her colleagues found that grid cell computations can emerge from a pattern formation process, and can be modelled by continuous attractor networks. With inputs signifying the velocity and heading direction of the animal, continuous attractor models can generate triangular grid responses that encode updated estimates of location in two-dimensional spaces. They further show, with a proof of concept, that continuous attractor dynamics underlie the integration of velocity in grid cells. In 2013, Fiete and her colleagues used in vivo neural recordings as the basis for their computational investigation of the mechanisms underlying grid cell activity. Their model, relying on low- dimensional continuous attractor dynamics, reliably characterized grid cell responses in short duration, familiar enclosures. Over time and in changing conditions, individual grid cell responses change however, the grid parameter ratios and relative phases between simultaneously recorded cells stay essentially constant, showing that population level responses are invariant. Their findings argue against the cell-environment hypothesis as they find that the stability of cell-cell responses is more robust than cell-environment responses. The following year, Fiete described a model to explain grid cell development, from the moment of eye opening to fully developed grid cell computations. In the beginning, their model depicts initially unstructured networks of neurons spiking to velocity and location inputs. They propose, through computational modelling, that grid neurons develop an organized recurrent architecture based on the similarity of their inputs, acting through inhibitory neurons, and this lays the foundation for a mature grid cell network that can compute velocity and location in a coordinated and integrated fashion. Fiete was then interested in developing a robust system with which to determine neural circuit mechanisms underlying brain function that do not merely rely on observing neural activity. Using the grid cell system, which Fiete had extensively probed and serves as a good system for testing computational models, Fiete showed that the \\"distribution of relative phase shifts\\" model has the potential to reveal highly detailed cortical circuit mechanisms from sparse neural recordings. Through the use of perturbative experiments, they find that their method is able to discriminate between feedforward and recurrent neural networks to uncover which model most accurately described neural computations. In 2019, once Fiete had arrived at MIT, she published a paper using topological modeling to transform the neural activity of large populations of neurons into a data cloud representing the shape of a ring. This ring-like spatial representation of neural activity has been shown in flies to underlie head direction, and now, by Fiete, has been shown to represent head direction in mice - like an internal compass. The ring-like shape that the neural activity creates is known as a manifold in computational analyses, a shape represented in multiple dimensions to depict multidimensional data. Its shape and dimensionality represent the data in a more interpretable way. The approach that Fiete describes, using a manifold to depict neural activity, enables blind (unsupervised) discovery and decoding of specific variables using only neural activity as an input. == Awards and Honors == * 2018 CIFAR Senior Fellow * 2016 Howard Hughes Faculty Scholar * 2013 CNS Excellence Award for Teaching - College of Natural Sciences University of Texas at Austin * 2011-2013 McKnight Scholar * 2013 Office of Naval Research Young Investigator * 2010 Searle Scholar * 2009 Alfred P.

Kwok rejected suggestions of political motivation raised during mitigation, such as the labelling of \\"a political demonstration\\" or the defendants‚Äô alignment with localist ideas due to their frustration following the collapse of the 2014 Occupy protests. \\"Without doubt, the court will not join this political debate,\\" Kwok repeatedly stressed. He also stressed the \\"collective responsibility\\" as each individual's mere presence \\"provided comfort, support and encouragement\\" to others at the scene. In an April 2020 hearing, Kwok expressed sympathy for tour guide Tony Hung for stabbing three people, in which one of them was critically wounded, in front of a pro- democracy Lennon Wall in a pedestrian tunnel in Tseung Kwan O during the anti- extradition protests in August 2019. Kwok said the defendant was himself \\"an involuntary sacrifice and a bloodstained victim hanging by his last breath\\" as the protesters had \\"ruthlessly trampled on his right to work, live and survive\\". Kwok also slammed protesters acting \\"like an army\\", beating people up and blocking roads, and was reminiscent of that seen during the Cultural Revolution who were no different from terrorists. Kwok praised Hung for \\"showing noble qualities\\" when he wrote to the court expressing his regrets. Kwok sentenced Hung 45 months in prison for the three counts of wounding with intent, an offence punishable by imprisonment for seven years. Prominent lawyers and pro-democracy activists raised concerns over Kwok's political remarks, questioning the light sentence was biased. Joshua Wong said he would consider filing a complaint with the judiciary. Shortly after Kwok's remarks, judiciary made a last-minute switch before the proceedings on a protest- related case, replacing Kwok with Ko King-sau as the presiding judge, and would no longer handle all relating cases. On 25 May, Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma issued a statement, saying that a judge expressing unnecessary political views may impair public confidence in the judiciary. Ma has decided that Kwok should not hear any cases involving a similar political context for the time being. ==References== Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of Hong Kong Category:Hong Kong judges Category:Barristers of Hong Kong ","title":"Kwok Wai-kin"},{"id":"63773963","text":"D'Elb√©e Protecting the Republican Prisoners After the Vicomte Edmond Marie F√©lix de Boislecomte (28 April 1849, Arras - 1923, Arras) was a French painter of genre and historical scenes. == Biography == He was awarded a law degree in Paris in 1871.\\"Edmond Boislecomte (1849-1923)\\", Ressources de la Biblioth√®que nationale de France Online Later, he studied at the Acad√©mie Julian, in the studios of Jean-Paul Laurens and Catalogue de la 27e exposition de la Soci√©t√© des Amis des Arts de la Somme, √† Amiens en 1885, p.11 He was married to Marguerite de Marbot, the granddaughter of General Marbot\\"Il a conquis un general\\" Online @ Paris Normandie.

They convinced him to do so by telling him exaggerated stories of Robinson's personal conduct and his behaviour during council business. Faber began to regret being involved in the mayoral contest as it began to affect his health and planned to withdraw from the race, but de Malmanche and the other C&R; councillors insisted he continue.

While her husband is fascinated by dinner parties discussing African anthropology and minor academic points, Caro is growing tired of her dull village and her pale marriage, as well as their unpleasant 4-year-old daughter. A dying missionary, Reverend Stillingfleet, ends up in a nearby nursing home, and Caro's husband Alan realises that Stillingfleet possesses an unpublished manuscript on their shared field of anthropology. Concerned that the manuscript will be lost - or worse bequeathed to a rival - Alan convinces Caro to steal the manuscript, allowing him to write a groundbreaking paper. Caro begins to regret the theft, as well as developing suspicions that Alan is having an affair with his attractive editor. She seeks out the guidance of her friends Kitty, a self-absorbed English woman who has spent much of her adult life in the Caribbean, Kitty's effete, gossipy son Coco, and her sister Dolly, a spinster who cares for a large family of hedgehogs in her back garden. Ultimately, Caro is able to reconcile her marriage with Alan when he comes to regret his affair. The manuscript, which has caused so much chaos, is destroyed in a library fire accidentally started by protesting students. ==Publication history== Pym commenced writing the novel in 1970 and completed the first draft in 1971. Pym's last novel had been published in 1961, and she had been rejected by publishers since. At the time, Pym had no expectations for her \\"academic novel\\", writing \\"[p]erhaps my immediate circle of friends will like to read it\\". Pym wanted the novel to be \\"a sort of Margaret Drabble effort\\" however she was ultimately dissatisfied with the novel. She put it aside and never returned to revise the work. Pym left two drafts of An Academic Question, one in the first-person narrative and one in third person. After Pym's death, her literary executor Hazel Holt revised the work from a combination of the two drafts for publication.Holt, Hazel, introduction to An Academic Question, E. P. Dutton, 1986, The novel was published posthumously in 1986, by Macmillan in England and E. P. Dutton in the United States. The novel was released as an audiobook in the 1980s by Chivers Press, read by Angela Pleasence. The novel was published in Germany in 1991 as Die Frau des Professors (The Professor's Wife), in France in 1992 as Une Question Purement Acad√©mique, and in Italy in 2019 as Una questione accademica. ==Reception== The novel received mixed reviews, with most acknowledging its status as a draft. Kirkus Reviews called it \\"minor but still intriguing... on occasion, deliriously funny\\".Kirkus Reviews, 15 August 1986, accessed 26 April 2020 The New York Times called the novel \\"one of Pym's paler efforts\\" but noted that Pym remained \\"one of the most engaging novelists of this century\\".Rubin, Merle, A Cooler, Tougher Woman, New York Times, 7 September 1986, accessed 26 April 2020 ==Connections to other works== Pym's novels routinely feature characters from her previous works. The characters of Sister Dew from An Unsuitable Attachment and Digby Fox from Less than Angels reappear. Most notably, this novel features the memorial service for Esther Clovis, a character who had appeared in three previous Pym novels starting with Excellent Women. The memorial service is seen from the point of view of Caro Grimstone, who did not know Miss Clovis and thus is attempting to piece together the woman's personality from the details of her service. The memorial service will be seen a second time, from a different perspective, in Pym's final novel A Few Green Leaves. ==References== Category:1986 British novels Category:Novels by Barbara Pym Category:Novels published posthumously ","title":"An Academic Question"},{"id":"63774176","text":"Mayeux is a French surname.

Between December 1984 and January 1985, he murdered three women in Oakland for the purpose of robbery, as well as raping a 12-year-old girl. After his arrest, he confessed to his crimes and was later given three life sentences. ==Early life and crimes== Wimberly was born as Anthony Rene Lee on October 26, 1962, to Ray Lee, an employee for the Pacific Gas and Electric Company from Antioch, and Gwendolyn Williams, who was jobless and on welfare. A year after his birth, his mother married to A.D. Wimberly from Oakland, but the couple divorced when Anthony was little. His mother then moved away so she could work at nursing homes in Tacoma, Washington and Minnesota, returning to Oakland when he was nine years old. In 1976, at age 14, Wimberly was arrested for assault and taken to a group home in Oroville, where he would spend the next nine months. After release, he was arrested for robbery and sent off to the CYA's closed facility in Stockton, where he spent another 11 months. Anthony was paroled in 1978, but was returned only six months later for burglary, and again paroled on January 23, 1980. He then attended the Castlemont High School in East Oakland, but passed only two of his classes. On November 4, the now-adult Wimberly broke into an East Oakland home and tied up a 12-year-old boy while he was ransacking the premises. He found a shotgun, but was spooked off when the boy's mother returned home. He was captured soon after, but bailed out after his arrest. Wimberly then registered at an adult day school in the city, but never attended a class. When questioned by his parole officers, he claimed to have worked for a few months installing air fitters for a company in San Francisco, but those claims couldn't be confirmed. On June 12, 1981, he broke into a garage and stole a brand new Lincoln Continental, with which he was caught five days later while burglarizing a home. He plead guilty to robbery and burglary, and was sentenced to a 3-year imprisonment term at the Solano State Prison in Vacaville, where he was sent to on September 2. He was paroled on May 28, 1983, but was thrown into the San Quentin State Prison in September for grand theft auto and violating the conditions of his parole. On September 3, 1984, he was released on parole yet again and moved in to live with his mother in the Acorn Projects. ==Murders== Not long after his final release, Wimberly embarked on a crime spree in Oakland, beginning with the November 8th rape and shooting of a 12-year-old girl in the west side. More than a month later, on December 23, he broke into the home of 24-year-old secretary Anne Arevalo, raping and then shooting her multiple times. Wimberly then stuffed her corpse in a closet, before ransacking the house and then fleeing, leaving Arevalo's twin baby daughters crying, but unharmed, in the adjacent room. On January 24 the following year, Wimberly entered a beauty parlor in West Oakland, demanding money from the two employees present: Vicky J. Russo, from Concord, and Marilyn A. Moore, both 35. When they told him that there was none, Anthony shot both women multiple times, killing Moore and heavily injuring Russo. He then stole the keys to Vicky's van and fled the area. The shooting was quickly reported to police by alarmed residents, with the authorities later finding Russo barely alive in a pool of blood before rushing her to a hospital. About 45 minutes after the shooting, the van was spotted along Adeline Street in West Oakland. The driver pulled into a parking lot and fled on foot, with the officers and a helicopter with a spotlight hard on his heels. Despite the circumstances, Wimberly managed to hide himself in the Acorn Projects. On January 31, he broke into the Oakland Hills home of 62-year-old Doris Wong Lee, killing her while trying to burgle the house. ==Arrest, trial and imprisonment== Six days after killing Lee, Wimberly was arrested and charged with the three murders and the rape of the 12-year-old, as well as 16 other felonies, after police found evidence linking him to the three killings. The drastic shift in his violence after his parole was compared with that of another dangerous murderer, Raymond George, who had been released only a few after Wimberly, but had quieted down. Wimberly later confessed to killing Arevalo and Moore and the raping of the 12-year-old girl, but denied killing Lee, claiming that two other men had committed the murder and he had found her dead when he broke into the home. Regardless of his claims, he was later found guilty of all charges and given three life imprisonment terms. ==External links== * Wimberly's appeal ==References== Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American criminals Category:Male serial killers Category:American serial killers Category:American people convicted of murder Category:American people convicted of rape Category:American people convicted of child sexual abuse Category:American people convicted of assault Category:American people convicted of burglary Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by California Category:Prisoners and detainees of California Category:Criminals from California Category:People from Antioch ","title":"Anthony Wimberly"},{"id":"63774212","text":"Mayet is a surname.

It depicts the god Bacchus and the discovery of honey, as described in the ancient Roman poem Fasti by Ovid. It is in the collection of the Worcester Art Museum in Worcester, Massachusetts. ==Background== The Discovery of Honey by Bacchus was commissioned together with a companion painting, The Misfortunes of Silenus, by Giovanni Vespucci in Florence. Both works represent an emerging, private demand for paintings with secular subjects. Like Piero di Cosimo's other mythological paintings, they were made for an audience well versed in the works of Ovid and Virgil, inviting the viewers to demonstrate their erudition. ==Subject and composition== A close-up of Silenus The subject is from Book III of Ovid's Fasti, which had been published in Venice in 1497. At the centre is a group of satyrs and bacchantes who make noises to get a swarm of bees to settle in the trunk of a hollow tree. From left and right, more companions of Bacchus join the event, including Silenus, who rides in from the right on an ass, visibly drunk and supported by satyrs and bacchantes. In the foreground to the right are Bacchus, leaning on a thyrsus, and Ariadne, who points at the wreath on the god's head. To the upper left is a town and to the upper right are a steep hill and a forest. ==Analysis== The art historian Erwin Panofsky interpreted the painting as a reflection of the \\"Epicurean evolutionism\\" present in the Latin writings of Lucretius and Vitruvius, which had been reintroduced to Renaissance audiences through Genealogia Deorum Gentilium by Boccaccio. The juxtaposition of the \\"pastoral civilisation\\" to the left and the \\"unmitigated wildness\\" to the right, according to Panofsky, symbolises the emergence of civilisation, in which the discovery of honey was considered an important step, commemorated through the eating and offering of honey cakes (liba) at Liberalia. The art historian Dennis Geronimus has written that Panofsky's evolutionist interpretation should be taken with reservations, as its moral roots lie in religion, and the juxtaposition it is based on is \\"largely divorced from the painting itself\\". ==Preservation and provenance== Fogg Museum, Harvard University) The Discovery of Honey by Bacchus is significantly better preserved than The Misfortunes of Silenus, with clearer colours and fewer over-painted sections. Since 1937, it is in the collection of the Worcester Art Museum in Worcester, Massachusetts. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== : : ==External links== * Category:1490s paintings Category:Paintings by Piero di Cosimo Category:Paintings of Bacchus Category:Paintings in Massachusetts Category:Paintings based on works by Ovid Category:Works based on Fasti (poem) Category:Bees in popular culture Category:Insects in art Category:Donkeys in art ","title":"The Discovery of Honey by Bacchus"},{"id":"63774361","text":"Rodowicz is a Polish surname.

Priests from the Major Archdiocese gathered together in the Archbishops house and asked for the details of the land deals of the Major Archeparchy. The Synod of bishops of the Syro-Malabar Church assembled in January 2018 could not effectively deal with the situation. The priests of the diocese were very strong about the deposition of Mar Alencherry from the office of the Major Archbishop. On 22 June 2018, Roman Curia intervened and appointed Bishop Mar Jacob Manathodath as Apostolic Administrator sede plena of the Major Archeparchy of Ernakulam-Angamaly to study the case with an independent agency and submit the report. During this period the priests came up with certain documents indicating that Mar Alencherry has secret bank accounts.

Hayes Hall was first built in 1874 to house the Insane Department of the Erie County Almshouse. In 1893, the building was converted into a county hospital that contained 400 beds. The land that the hall is on would be acquired by the University of Buffalo in 1909. By 1927, the University was renovating the building to convert it into a building suitable to hold classes. On February 22, 1928 the building would be dedicated by the University. At the dedication, University at Buffalo chancellor Samuel Capen stated he hoped the building would become a central image to the university saying \\"from its nature and its central position this building is destined to be the focus of the life of the University for many years, perhaps for many generations. It will be preeminently the visual symbol of the University both to the members of the institution and to the community at large.\\" The building underwent $45 million in renovations between 2011 and 2016.

It is found in flooded forest communities of Cambodia and southern Vietnam. There is a report of the trees growing infrequently in seasonally flooded forest along the Se Buy River alongside Na Kae village, Kham Khuean Kaeo District, Yasothon Province, northeast Thailand. These trees, with a dbh of 10cm, grow mainly at 0 to 3m above the water low level, being flooded from 42 to 83 days a year. Within the floodplain of the lake Tonle Sap, western Cambodia, T. cambodiana occurs rarely, in isolated pockets of forest within the Secondary scrubland {short tree-shrubland association) community, where sprawling shrubs and lianas form a closed canopy some 3-5m tall. In this area firewood collection was intense in the twentieth century. T. cambodiana and Diospyros cambodiana were extensively exploited for charcoal making in the beginning of the 20th century, and so became rare in the inundated floodplain. People also reported that availability of this tree decreased in the two years around 2007-2009, though it is still harvested. The branches of the tree, when flooded at Tonle Sap, were one of the favoured spots for the hairy-nosed otter, Lutra sumatrana, to place its spraints. T√¢' u√´, ta-uah is its common name in Khmer. The wood of T. cambodiana is used in the construction of fishing dams, to make columns for buildings and to make charcoal.

She attended the Esayan Elementary and High School. She took Armenian language lessons for five years from linguist Hagop Kurken, whose attention she had attracted during her final grade in the high school. She then served as assistant teacher at the orphanage of the Yedikule Armenian Hospital for four years. ==Career== Her first article was published in Manz√ªme-i Efk√¢r, an Armeno-Turkish periodical. Because of this article, she received job offers from periodicals like P√ºrag, Hanrakidag, P√ºzantion and Panaser. She was not even twenty years of age when she was awarded second place in a poetry competition organized by the newspaper Masis. In 1905, Mark started to edit the Constantinople-based women‚Äôs Armenian magazine Dzaghig (\\"Flower\\"). At that time, writing workforce in the media is carried out by mostly by men due to the scarcity of women writers. Male writers in the periodical Dzaghig use feminine pen names. Aware of the feminist movements in France, she wanted the magazine to be published only by women and for women. In the meantime, she married to Vahan Toshigyan, editorial director of the periodical Manz√ªme-i Efk√¢r, and quit her job at the orphanage. The periodical continued to be published two years more, but folded when Mark followed her husband to Smyrna. There, she wrote on women's issues at the local magazines Ar≈üaluys (\\"Dawn\\") and Arevelk (\\"Orient\\"). In 1909, the couple returned to Constantinople. Mark became the head of the Literary Commission of the recently-founded \\"Nationalist Armenian Women's Union\\". She got ready to open up Armenian schools in the province and to provide education of girls. As a result of these efforts, the number of Armenian schools in Anatolia increases to 32. In 1919, she started to publish the bi-weekly feminist magazine Hay Gin (, \\"Armenian Woman\\"). This time, the difference in her attitude is that not only women but both genders should be involved in the publishing of the periodical. She left her idea of separating men and women. She never gave up independence saying \\"if the Armenian Woman magazine will live under a flag, this can only be a womanhood flag.\\" In 1923, Muhittin √úst√ºndaƒü, a deputy of Istanbul, said in a seminar of the \\"Turkish Women's Union\\" that \\"there is no gender equality because women are not enlisted\\". While nobody responded to that, Mark sharply criticized it in the daily Hilal-ƒ± Ahmer (\\"Red Crescent\\") with the words \\"mothers lost their lives during childbirth, and women also serve as a nurse on the battlefields\\". Her periodical continued to appear 13 years until 1932, when it was closed down by the Turkish government. It is noted that the paper was forced to close down because it was accused of supporting the \\"enemies of the Turks\\" for its support of the Allies during the post-World War I years. ==Feminism== Mark opposed \\"women becoming male in the name of emancipation\\". She said that \\"women must work and achieve their economic freedom\\", adding \\"in doing this, there is no need to be prepared to be rude, to destroy\\". According to her \\"love is in the mind\\". She pointed out that \\"the education system is prepared from a male perspective\\", and stated that \\"involvement of women in the curriculum preparation stage is imperative\\". Mark said that \\"men and women are different and equal\\", adding \\"women must claim their differences for themselves and for humanity\\". ==Death== Hayganu≈ü Mark died at the age of 81 at Yedikule Armenian Hospital in 1966. At the deathbed, she said to a friend \\"Write! Always write for the homeland, nation and humanity and be happy with them!\\". She is buried at the ≈ûi≈üli Armenian Cemetery in Istanbul.

Starting in 2012, she transformed her tea plantation in Darjeeling to accommodate and facilitate the safe passage of elephants during their migration between Nepal and Assam. The Wildlife Trust of India recognised the plantation as the Green Corridor Champion of North Bengal; the University of Montana, US, certified it Elephant Friendly. She then initiated additional projects for elephant conservation, including a re-wilding project to create a 100-acre forest, and a pilot crop insurance project for neighbouring farms. In 2019, she was awarded the Nari Shakti Puraskar, India's highest civilian award for women. ==Life== Jabbar was a journalist in Kolkata until she inherited the family's large tea plantation in 2011. It is a 1200-acre plantation in the Darjeeling District of West Bengal. She was the fifth generation of her family to own the land since 1884, and surprisingly she is the third consecutive woman. She took over the role when her mother, Dolly, wanted to retire. Dolly Jabbar had taken on the job from Sonia's grandmother Sayeeda Badrunisa. The work in the tea industry is mostly done by women but that is not where the power lies. Tea workers can pick all day to find their wages, destined to buy essentials, is spent on drink or drugs by their husbands. And at the national level the tea workers unions ignore the needs of women. Jabbar has been trying to fix this working with an NGO to encourage discussion amongst her workers. The occasion that brought her to notice took place in 2012 was when her workers advised her that elephants were about to invade 35 acres of the newly planted part of her tea plantation. She was told that the best idea would be to scare them away with flaming torches and fireworks, but Jabbar decided to do nothing. She spent a sleepless night worried that she had sacrificed her workers planting and her investment to rampaging elephants, but she loved wildlife. In the morning she was pleased to find that the damage was minimal and she realised that with planning this could all be tolerated. In time she created 400m wide passageways through her plantation so that elephants could complete their traditional migration. The elephants way has been blocked by a 17 km long fence that prevents their usual route from Assam and the Mahananda basin to Nepal. Her plantation's policy allows the herds to still achieve this. In addition her plantation avoids building other barriers and they make sure drainage ditches cannot trap young elephants. Her procedures also make sure that chemicals are safely stored and the plantations mono-culture was modified to include other plants that were of interest to elephants. She was given the Nari Shakti Puraskar award in 2019. The \\"2018\\" award was made in the Presidential Palace by the President of India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was present. She was running a club for locals who were interested in the work and she had put aside 100 acres to be a native tree forest for the use of elephants and other wildlife. In 2018 her work led to Nuxalbari's recognition as the first ever large elephant friendly plantation. The award was made by the Wildlife Friendly Enterprise Network and University of Montana. The Wildlife Trust of India noted her land as a Green Corridor Champion of North Bengal. She was noted by Vogue India amongst twelve women who were creating change during the climate crisis in 2020. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Recipients of the Nari Shakti Puraskar Category:People from Darjeeling district Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Sonia Jabbar"},{"id":"63774721","text":"Roger Baulu (28 February 1910 ‚Äì 17 September 1997) was a Canadian radio and television host.

The band have achieved press coverage in the music magazines Vive Le Rock and Black Velvet, as well as website Louder Than War. ==History== Courson met guitarist Honey-Jones at a Soho nightclub in 2009, after relocating from Paris to pursue her musical career. They named their band as ‚Äúa reflection of the mental health epidemic currently spreading like wildfire through the very core of western society‚Äù, The group played their live debut in Brighton at the end of 2010, supporting Goldblade and Viv Albertine. They have since released four studio albums and toured extensively across Europe, the United Kingdom and United States, gaining a loyal following for their highly energized and theatrical performances. The band have supported the likes of The Rezillos, Sham 69, UK Subs, The Professionals, GBH, Vice Squad and Theatre of Hate, and regularly play at festivals such as Rebellion and Camden Rocks. Enthusiastic supporters of the underground punk scene, Courson and Honey-Jones also promote the 'Punk and Roll Rendezvous' club night in Camden, which has become internationally renowned and spawned a yearly festival. ==Musical style== Lauded for their 'blistering, trashy, punky glam rock sound', the band has been described as 'a homage to Psychedelic Rock/Punk Rock and Grunge of days gone by but ...with a fresh, modern twist.' Black Velvet Magazine praised their 'addictive songs with bounce and energy' and Artrocker wrote 'the band excel at peripherally gothic action rock'. Nina's 'sultry melodic' vocals have drawn favourable comparisons to Chrissie Hynde, Siouxsie Sioux and Patti Smith whist Louder Than War commented that Honey-Jones‚Äô guitars provide an energetic binding agent that helps meld together goth, glam, grunge, punk and psychedelic sensibilities.' Vive Le Rock described 'Delirious Dream' as 'gorgeous yet nightmarish', and Devolution Magazine noted that To be able to take a sound that is recognisable from the 60‚Äôs ...and DeLorean it into something fit to please and thrill people well into the 2020‚Äôs and beyond is astonishing in itself.

Her father was a landowner, who grew cork and olives, and her mother was a German heiress from Hamburg - they met at the University of Coimbra. Her parents were never legally married, and she was largely raised by her Portuguese grandmother. Her maternal grandmother was Erna Schr√∂eder. From the age of ten, she attended a Lisbon boarding school run by nuns, and in 1951, earned a degree in philosophy and history from the University of Lisbon. ==Personal life== She studied psychology for three months at New York's Columbia University, and then worked as a counsellor for juvenile delinquents in Lisbon, before switching to studying art at the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, where she met Pedro Bessone Basto, a \\"boulevardier\\" from a wealthy family. They married in New York, and divorced in under a year. In 1961, the Lisbon-based Gulbenkian Foundation awarded her a fellowship to research children's programs in New York museums, and once there was helped by Kay Lepercq, whose husband Paul Lepercq was an investment banker, and his clients included the Schlumberger family.

She regularly organised parties, ranging from formal black-tie balls to a \\"hot-pants party\\". Schlumberger particularly liked the work of Mark Rothko, Robert Rauschenberg, and Roy Lichtenstein. Her portrait was painted by Salvador Dal√≠, but in 1987, she said, \\"I don't really like it. I was expecting a fantasy...but he did a classic\\". Dali also designed for her an elaborate pearl-and-emerald necklace which she often wore. Andy Warhol also painted her portrait. She was a patron to the fashion designer John Galliano, and lent him her empty 17th-century Paris hotel particulier (which she had left for a new Right Bank apartment), for his autumn 1994 show, designed with the help of Andr√© Leon Talley, Amanda Harlech, and Steven Robinson. ==Death== She died in Paris on 15 August 2007. Her funeral at Saint-Pierre-du-Gros-Caillou church in the 7th arrondissement was attended by six people, due to the city being \\"empty\\" in August: her daughter Victoire, Henri, Count of Paris, Andr√© Dunstetter, Nicholas Dadeshkeliani, the graphic artist Philippe Morillon, and Maria, her personal maid. ==References== Category:1929 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Schlumberger people Category:American art collectors Category:Women collectors Category:University of Lisbon alumni Category:People from Porto ","title":"S√£o Schlumberger"},{"id":"63774947","text":"Azov-Don Commercial Bank Building, 1913 Azov-Don Bank was one of the largest -stock commercial banks in the Russian Empire.

He joined the Disconto-Gesellschaft as a trainee on 15 July 1884 and built much of his career and reputation within this bank in Southeast Asia during the final part of the nineteenth century. Between 1902 and 1929, when the bank merged with the larger Deutsche Bank, he was a partner in the Disconto- Gesellschaft. Between 1930 and his death in 1944 he was chairman of the supervisory board at the enlarged Deutsche Bank. His long career was not without controversy. After he died the Villa Urbig, the large family home on the western edge of Berlin which he had commissioned in 1915 and which had been designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, brought Urbig enhanced posthumous publicity in the English-speaking world of a kind he cannot have anticipated. It became the setting for some of the most carefully staged and widely viewed press photographs of the post-war period. During the first part of 1945 surviving family members were forcibly ushered out by Soviet troops: three months later British Prime Minister Churchill moved in with a large retinue of staff. The plan was for Churchill to use the residence for the duration of the Potsdam Conference, but in the event, following a United Kingdom national election in July 1945, Churchill moved out and Prime Minister Attlee moved in for the conference's later stages. == Life == === Provenance and early years === Franz Urbig was born in Luckenwalde, a small town south of Berlin along the main railway line towards Halle and Leipzig: Urbig himself would later describe Luckenwalde as a \\"typical manufacturing town of its time\\". His father worked in the cloth trade, in the end becoming a factory foreman in a textiles company. Franz Urbig grew up in surprisingly modest circumstances and was forced to drop out of school following the early death of his father. He worked between 1878 and 1884 as a clerk at the district court house in Luckenwalde. It was here that he came to the attention of Ferdinand von Hansemann (1861-1900), a young lawyer who would later come to wider prominence for his shrill anti-Polish nationalism. The lawyer came from an exceptionally well connected family: the most relevant of those connections for Urbig's future career was his father, the entrepreneur-banker Adolph von Hansemann (1826-1903) who had been chief executive officer (\\"Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer\\"), since the death of his father in 1864, of the Disconto-Gesellschaft, at that time an aggressively expansionist bank with extensive interests abroad, notably in Southeast Asia. Based on his son's recommendations, Adolph von Hansemann accepted Urbig's application for a traineeship, which commenced on 15 July 1884. === Disconto-Gesellschaft (bank) === After joining the bank Urbig mastered the theory and practice of banking with what several sources refer to as \\"iron energy\\". Most of the parts of the world in which the bank saw the greatest opportunities for expansion were component territories of the British or French empires. He used his spare time to master English and French. In 1889, still aged only 25, Urbig was entrusted with the role of \\"Registratur des Chefkabinetts\\", which in effect meant he was employed as secretary to the board of directors. === Shanghai years=== In 1894 he was sent to Shanghai which was where the recently established Deutsch-Asiatische Bank (DAB / Âæ∑ËèØÈäÄ) had its main office. The bank had been set up and funded in 1889 by a consortium of thirteen major and private German banks, of which the Disconto- Gesellschaft was one. It became one of the leading foreign banks in China. Appointed \\"Prokurist\\", Urbig enjoyed authority to make commitments on behalf of the bank. In 1895 he took on the leadership of the DAB's subsidiary in Tientsin. He also set up its subsidiary in Kolkata, which opened the same year. The move was not without its political sensitivities since Kolkata was still the focus of Britain's fantastically lucrative opium trade and an important commercial centre in British India. Although investee companies welcomed the newly increased availability of investment capital from Germany, the political authorities were more conflicted over some of the issues arising. Urbig travelled extensively during his time in Southeast Asia . He was in Kolkata in 1897 where he oversaw the rebuilding of the bank branch following that year's earthquake. Back in Shanghai, in 1896 Urbig had been appointed to membership of the bank's board of directors. In 1896 and again in 1898 it was Urbig who led the negotiations in respect of two very large DAB bank loans to the Chinese government. Although China had never been incorporated into the British empire, there was by this time intensifying jostling between the British, French and German governments for the inclusion of China in their respective spheres of imperial influence: providing German capital to a government that till now had accepted western capital investment almost exclusively from the British raised political sensitivities which made Urbig's negotiations particularly difficult. Recalled to Shanghai, following a brief visit home to Germany, in 1898 he was mandated to work on setting up the bank's Hong Kong operation. In 1900 he was moved to London where he was briefly involved in setting up the local branch of Disconto-Gesellschaft, of which he became deputy chairman. On 23 November 1902, having returned to Berlin, he became a \\"Geschr√§ftsinhaber\\",meaning that he was admitted to co- ownership and board membership of the Disconto-Gesellschaft. Aged 38 he was, by traditional standards, young for such a promotion. === \\"Geschr√§ftsinhaber\\" (partner) === His successes in Southeast Asia led naturally to the focus of his attention after 1902 being largely on the Disconto-Gesellschaft's international business. He took a lead in building up the funding of international trade. In 1902 the annual value of foreign trade financed by the bank broke through the 100 Million mark barrier: by 1913, under Urbig's watch, it had reached 246.3 million marks. He was particularly involved in extending the bank's financial and commercial interests in China, and took a leading role in the bank's funding of the construction of the Shantung Railway (as it was identified in western sources of the time). This strategy also involved sustaining close connections, both personally and institutionally, with the Shanghai-based DAB, of which he was a member of the supervisory board, appointed supervisory board chairman in 1910. By 1903 Urbig had already been employed for nearly twenty years at the bank, and the death that year of the bank's dynamic chief executive, Adolph von Hansemann necessarily increased further Urbig's own prestige and influence within the bank. Alongside interests in Southeast Asia, during the first part of the twentieth century the bank was becoming increasingly prominent in Germany's recently acquired African colonies. Here Urbig oversaw major financing projects including those involving the Otavi Mines in South West Africa and the development/exploitation activities of the German East Africa Company, all backed by an underlying vision for the development and expansion of global trade. === War (and a flawed peace?) === The onset of war destroyed a large part of Franz Urbig's life's work. The globalisation of world trade which up till 1914 had underpinned more than three decades of rapidly growing prosperity - especially for western Europe and the United States - was thrown into reverse for more than a generation. In 1919 he accepted the politicians' invitation to attend the Paris Peace Conference in his capacity as an internationally acknowledged German expert on finance and trade. At the conference he made the case that no country - not even the United States of America - would be capable of sustaining the financial burdens which the victors proposed to impose on the new German republic. However, in the spirit of mutual hatred engendered by four years of bitter fighting and the accompanying war-time propaganda to which populations had been subjected on the home front, it became clear that the reparations demanded by the French leadership would not be significantly scaled back by the hoped for pressure from the British and Americans, notwithstanding the concerns eloquently expressed by at least one respected member of the British delegation. Urbig resigned his mandate as a member of the German delegation, with the parting advice that the conditions proposed (and subsequently imposed) by the war's military victors could never provide the basis for a lasting peace. He was again a member of the German delegation at the Spa Conference of 1920, but the Supreme War Council delegates were, as before, not minded to attend to the concerns of the German government representatives. === Currency crisis === During the culmination in 1923 of the Hyperinflation crisis Urbig served as chairman of the Currency Committee of the Central Association of German Banks and Bank Businesses. At the same time he was a board member at the \\"Rentenbank\\", the Berlin-based national bank set up that year to deal with the currency crisis. He was centrally involved in the introduction, in November 1923, of the German Rentenmark, a new currency which would indeed prove more stable than the old. He had been invited to accept the position of \\"National Currency Commissioner\\", but his response that his appointment should involve both repudiation of the burdensome reparations imposed at Versailles and the selective unwinding of the \\"excessively progressive\\" social reforms introduced since 1919 evidently led those responsible to conclude that Urbig, despite his financial expertise and experience, would not, after all, be an appropriate currency commissioner. The job instead went to Hjalmar Schacht, formerly of the Dresdner Bank. while the implementation of the Dawes Plan, at around the same time as the currency reforms took effect, went a long way to address the reparations issue. In 1924 Franz Urbig was one of seven German nationals appointed to the newly formed General Council of the Reichsbank (German central bank) (The other seven members were non-Germans, nominated by representatives of the creditor nations.) The creation of this General Council was part of a broader reconfiguration of the Reichsbank constitution which had been agreed under pressure from creditors as a pre-condition for the Dawes Plan in the so-called \\"London agreement\\" (which also contained a number of more overtly political provisions), signed off on 29 August 1924. === Bank merger === As part of the 1929 merger of the Disconto-Gesellschaft with the larger (but conspicuously less well capitalised) Deutsche Bank] Franz Urbig, who was reaching what many would have seen as a conventional retirement age, became a member of the oversight board of the merged entity. The next year he was elected to chair it. Nevertheless, he now stepped back from his day-to-day executive responsibilities. === National Socialism === In January 1933 the Hitler government exploited the national parliamentary deadlock to take power. The new government lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Antisemitism, hitherto a shrill slogan of populist opposition street politicians, now became a core underpinning of government strategy. On 18 January 1934 Urbig expressed his concern that the directors of Deutsche Bank must absolutely, and in the interests of Deutsche Bank, avoid any suggestion following some future a change in the political wind, that the bank board had done anything that might contribute to the idea that non-Aryan board members should resign. Nevertheless, more recent sources state that both Oscar Wassermann and Theodor Frank were \\"driven\\" to resign from the Deutsche Bank board in 1933. Georg Solmssen, a Jew by birth who had subsequently been baptised a Christian, managed to hang on as a board member till 1934 and then switched to the supervisory board, from which he was forced to resign only in 1936. There is no sign that Franz Urbig was a particular supporter of the National Socialists (nor of any other political party),Die Verfolgung und Ermordung der europ√§ischen Juden durch das nationalsozialistische Deutschland 1933‚Äì1945. Band 1: Wolf Gruner: Deutsches Reich 1933‚Äì1937. Oldenbourg, M√ºnchen 2008, , pp. 214‚Äì223; but there is also no sign that he saw it as part of his role to stand out against the tide of government antisemitism. According to at least one source, as early as 1933 the supervisory board of the bank included at least one member who had been planted there by the government. Franz Urbig died at his family home, just outside Potsdam, in September 1944. == Personal == Franz Urbig married Dorothea Augusta Anne Seebeck (10 September 1881 - 22 July 1968) at Bremen on 25 May 1907. The marriage was followed the births of the couple's two daughters. Marie Louise Gericke and Elisabeth Urbig. Dr. Andreas Gericke is their grandson. Their younger daughter, Elisabeth, died unmarried. == Villa Urbig == In 1915 Franz Urbig commissioned the building of a family villa on the shores of the Griebnitzsee (lake) at Babelsberg, just outside Potsdam. The architect, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe was little known at the time, though he would later - after radically changing his approach - achieve notability as a pioneer of modernist architecture, becoming in 1930 the last director of the Bauhaus School in (since relocating from Weimar in 1925) Dessau. The Villa Urbig was constructed between 1915 and 1917. It was here that the Urbigs' children grew up. The Villa Urbig was used as a backdrop for the 1935 UFA comedy film \\"Frischer Wind aus Kanada\\", directed by Paul H√∂rbiger.Kreimeier, Klaus (1999). The Ufa Story: A History of Germany's Greatest Film Company, 1918‚Äì1945. University of California Press. . Between 16 July and 25 July 1945 the Villa Ubrig was briefly home to Winston Churchill, who was attending the Potsdam conference nearby. He was accompanied by his 21 year old daughter (who stayed on for an extra week after her father returned to England) and a substantial retinue of support staff. The British took the precaution of bringing with them a large quantity of kitchen equipment, as wellas their own cutlery, glasses plates and dishes. Shortly after arriving Churchill complained that his bed had broken and must be repaired at once. Under the conditions of the time the usual solution would have been to repair it using parts extracted from a dining table, but since a large banquet was scheduled for a few days later, no suitable table could be spared. Churchill's bed was nevertheless repaired using improvised parts. The British Delegation Arrangements Administrator had one or two additional and very precisely communicated requirements, as a result of which a temporary \\"military hairdresser\\" was hastily installed in a neighbouring property, while arrangements were made for the British to use the swimming pool in the garden of the nearby \\"Villa Quandt\\". After a plague of mosquitoes descended on the villa, all the buildings were thoroughly sprayed and mosquito nets procured. Large formal balls were organised for the evenings of 18 and 21 July. Mr. Churchill departed on 28 July and his place, both at the Villa Urbig and at the conference table was taken by his former deputy Clement Attlee who had insisted on accompanying Churchill to the conference, but had up till this point been relegated to more modest accommodation in the town. (In England the party led by Mr. Attlee had already won the 1945 General Election even before Churchill's party set sail for the Potsdam conference, but it took several weeks before all the votes could be counted and the results confirmed and declared.Rowe, Chris (2004), Britain 1929‚Äì1998, Heinemann, ) After the war the Villa Urbig found itself in Berlin's Soviet occupation zone (relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). It was used for many years as a guest house for the \\"Walter Ulbricht\\" [East] German Academy for political and legal studies (\\"Deutsche Akademie f√ºr Staats- und Rechtswissenschaft \\"Walter Ulbricht\\" \\"). It was also used for more directly educational purposes, including the training of East German diplomats. Following 1990 the Villa Urbig reverted to private ownership. In 2005 it was acquired by Theodor Semmelhaack, a successful businessman and property developer who comprehensively restored it. Semmelhaack attracted criticism in English newspapers in 2006 when he refused to allow a plaque to be placed on his \\"private residence\\" celebrating its Churchill connections. Under pressure he nevertheless agreed that Mary Soames, who by this point was Winston Churchill's only surviving child, was very welcome to visit and look around: \\"It's empty at the moment. But I can get someone from my office to let her in\\". By 2009 the villa had become home to an icon of German capitalism almost as iconic as Franz Urbig himself. Having for some time lived in the villa as a tenant, that year the software entrepreneur Hasso Plattner purchased it. ==References== Category:1864 births Category:1944 deaths Category:People from Luckenwalde Category:Deutsche Bank people Category:German bankers ","title":"Franz Urbig"},{"id":"63775014","text":"Road signs in Russia ensure that transport vehicles move safely and orderly, as well as to inform the participants of traffic built-in graphic icons.

\\"vagrant king\\") was an official in Denmark and Norway during the 16th to 19th centuries who was appointed to supervise the beggars within a town or city quarter. Only beggars with begging permits were allowed to beg and it was the Stodderkonge's responsibility to ensure that those without a permit were chased out of town or placed to work in the prison.Stodderkongen at kbhsmuseum.podbean.com.Salmonsens Konversationsleksikon, 2nd edn., Vol. XXII, p. 373 These 'beggar kings' were sometimes unpopular, as beggars were considered to be scroungers. In addition, there were examples of beggar kings who, together with the strongest of the beggars in one area, formed a band that kept other beggars out. The beggars in the band paid the beggar king their income in return for not being expelled. The duties of the beggar king were later transferred to the police department itself, and the special function of the beggar king lapsed in most places from the late 18th century onwards. In recent times, the word has taken on a new meaning, in that among the Danish vagabonds each year, a beggar king is chosen in connection with the Egeskov Market. One of the duties of the beggar king is to enact justice among the vagabonds and settle disputes. == References == == External links == * Stodderkonge entry in the Ordbog Over Det Dansk Sprog [Dictionary of the Danish language].

It was launched on Tuesday 28 June 1881. James R DeWolf was a descendant of James DeWolf, a slave trader and privateer. == Name and other ships == Rotomahana was a name used by at least two other ships of the era. Rotomahana and its Pink and White Terraces had become better known after the Duke of Edinburgh visited in 1870. Rotomahana was the name of the first iron ship built in Auckland in 1876 and beached in 1924 and another, launched at Denny shipyard for Union Steamship in 1879 and scrapped in 1926. ==Service== Rotomahana was recorded as arriving at Dundee on 19 April 1883. On 19 May it sailed from Dundee under the command of John W Mance. Its crew agreement bound participants to a trip to Cardiff, Wales, and on to Wilmington, California \\"and/or any ports in places not exceeding 75 degrees north and 65 degrees south latitudes, trading to and fro, within these limits as required, for a period not exceeding three years and back to a final port of discharge in the United Kingdom or on the continent of Europe between the Elbe and Brest, with power to call at any place for orders\\". The crew were aged between 19 and 43 with birthplaces ranging from the UK to Sweden, Italy, Holland, the West Indies, and Sicily. Wages ranged from ¬£5 5s a month for George Unwin of Liverpool, the sailmaker, to ¬£3 5s for the 20 able-bodied seamen. Unwin's wage of ¬£17 02 5d was paid on discharge. Fifteen of the ABs deserted the ship in San Francisco. The agreement also listed the food the crew could expect, which included 1lb of bread a day 1¬Ωlb of beef and 1¬ºlb of pork on alternate days, ¬Ωlb of flour and ‚Öìlb of peas on alternate days. The men would also receive a daily ration of ‚Öõoz of tea, ¬Ωoz of coffee, 2oz of sugar and 3 quarts of water, as well as the statutory lime and lemon juice and sugar. \\"Equivalent substitutes as may be found necessary.\\" Rotomahana arrived back in Liverpool on 16 May 1884. One death was recorded but no name given. ==Final voyage== Rotomahana set sail from Liverpool, bound for San Francisco, US in the summer of 1884 with a cargo of coal.Huddersfield Chronicle, 12 November 1884 Two months into the trip, the coal was found to be ablaze. It was said that the ship's compasses were so affected by heat that they were \\"perfectly untrustworthy\\". The result was that Rotomahana ran ashore at Elephant Keys, in the northwest of East Falkland, on 20 August 1884. The Rotomahana crew reached Port Stanley on 10 September 1884 and the ship's fate was recorded in \\"Maritime Losses\\" in The Times on 26 September 1884 There was at least one fatality. Sailmaker George Unwin of Liverpool subsequently died in Montevideo, Uruguay, on 14 November. ==Legacy== In November 1884 a Board of Trade inquiry was held into the loss of both Rotomahana and Earl of Beaconsfield, a slightly larger vessel that had carried coal and general cargo. The Earl of Beaconsfield fire was blamed on spontaneous combustion. The inquiry ruled that the ordinary precautions for the safety of carrying coal cargoes were insufficient. It noted that the fire on Earl of Beaconsfield remained hidden until it was too late to fight in properly and said it was \\"very significant\\" that many of the ships that went missing were carrying coal. The board called for all coal-carrying ships to be fitted with a system of tubes to be inserted at different points in the cargo to assess temperature. == References == Category:Barques Category:Four-masted ships Category:Tall ships of the United Kingdom Category:1881 ships Category:Ships built in Glasgow Category:Maritime incidents in 1884 Category:Individual sailing vessels ","title":"Rotomahana (ship)"},{"id":"63775294","text":"Emma Jayne Mounkley (born 1981) is a former British Paralympic swimmer who competed in international level events. ==References== Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Stockport Category:English female swimmers Category:Paralympic swimmers of Great Britain Category:Swimmers at the 2000 Summer Paralympics Category:Medalists at the 2000 Summer Paralympics Category:Paralympic medalists in swimming Category:Paralympic silver medalists for Great Britain Category:Paralympic bronze medalists for Great Britain ","title":"Emma Mounkley"},{"id":"63775311","text":"The 1982‚Äì83 √örvalsdeild karla was the 32nd season of the √örvalsdeild karla, the top tier men's basketball league on Iceland.

Born in Strawberry Hills in Sydney, she moved with her family to Wagga Wagga where she taught singing lessons before moving to Sydney for further training under Albert Fisher. After a successful debut at the Promenade Concerts, held at what is now Surry Hills, she toured China and India for several years as part of the Willard Opera Company. Upon her return she joined Harry Rickards' Sydney-based vaudeville circuit and, after the company toured in Western Australia, established herself for a number of years in Perth as a singing teacher and performer. Baker moved back to Sydney in 1907 where she reestablished herself as a singing teacher and an influential part of Sydney's musical society. She gave numerous concerts and was an active fundraiser for a number of charities, later becoming a life governor of the Rachel Forster Hospital for Women and Children. She remained teaching till only a few weeks before her death at the age of 82. ==Early life and career== Baker was born on 11 August 1866 in Strawberry Hills to George Frederick Baker, auctioneer, and Sarah Wilkinson Baker, . She moved to Wagga Wagga when her father purchased the Pastoral Hotel, and whilst living there she started music classes to fund singing lessons in Sydney. Early in her career she raised ¬£50 for Wagga hospital and ¬£24/15/6 to the Lord Mayor of Sydney for survivors of the shipwreck of the Ly- ee-moon off the Green Cape Lighthouse. Baker moved to Sydney in 1886 to be a pupil of Albert Fisher. During the same year, she participated in a number of Promenade concerts, held at the Exhibition Building which was situated in Prince Alfred Park. She received favourable reviews, with The Evening News praising her debut performance, writing that: She performed in another two concerts and on her second concert The Sydney Morning Herald also praised her, writing that: Bondi Aquarium 1891 After Baker became pregnant to law clerk Charles Hall, they married on 23 April 1887 at the Congregational Church in Surrey Hills. It later came to light that Hall appeared to have married her rather reluctantly as Baker's brother threatened to \\"break his head\\" if he did not. The couple then had two children: Beatrice (nick-named \\"Trixie\\") in 1887 and Vera in 1889. Being a mother did not stop Baker from performing as in 1887 she sung in three concerts at Bondi Aquarium (at Tamarama). She later performed in M. Henri Kowalski's \\"Grand Concert\\" at Centennial Town Hall on October 25, 1890 as the lead soloist, singing Gioachino Rossini's \\"La Carita\\", and finished 1891 in the Christmas pantomime playing Zorillda in Sinbad the Sailor. Between 1891 and 1893 she toured India and China with the Willard Opera Company, playing lead for four years in a number of Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and created something of a stir in the part of Hollee Beebee in The Nautch Girl. Many years later she recounted how she gave a concert to the Maharaja of Mysore (though later she stated that it was to the Maharaja of Cooch Behar), recalling in particular that during the concert only six people were in the direct audience, and that though she could not see the women of the court she could hear them. She also claimed that after the concert she was granted the privilege of riding on the Maharajah's elephant. Upon her return from overseas, she performed in a hospital benefit at the School of Arts in North Sydney, and afterwards joined Harry Rickards' vaudeville circuit at Tivoli's theatre starting in August 1894. During the time she performed for Tivoli's she applied for divorce from Charles Hall, on the grounds of desertion starting in 1891. During the court case, her lawyer revealed that Charles had been convicted of embezzlement, and it was alleged by Hall's lawyers that Baker had been having an affair with her colleague Harry Fitzmaurice, which she vehemently denied. The judge found that there was no evidence of desertion but also found that he could not find any evidence that Baker had been unfaithful to her husband, so dismissed the case. As this was a time before no fault-divorce in Australia (which was only enacted in 1975), if neither spouse could prove fault in the marriage by the other spouse, then divorce would not be granted by the courts. Consequently, Ada and Charles never formally divorced. ==Move to Western Australia== Advertisement announcing Ada Baker's intentions to stay in Perth to teach singing. During July and August of 1898 Rickards' Tivoli company played in Western Australia. When the company returned to Sydney, Baker left them and stayed in Perth. In Perth, she established herself as a singing teacher, whilst performing with the Fremantle Orchestral Society, the Perth Musical Union, and the Lyric Club. Baker's time in Perth was not without drama, as in December 1898 she sued the proprietors of The Continental Gardens over lost wages. The case centered around Baker's assertion that when she signed her contract with the Gardens she claimed she told them she could not travel, however the company put on performances at the goldfields in the Kalgoolie and Coolgardie regions where Baker was prominently billed. When Baker learned of this, she had evidently produced a medical certificate that claimed she was too sick to travel. She vehemently denied she knew what opposing counsel meant by her not going due to \\"a Coolgardie or Kalgoorlie reason\\", however the defendants counter-claimed that Baker fully knew of the travel arrangements and that when she did not attend they were financially and reputationally disadvantaged by her non- appearance. Furthermore they produced a witness who claimed that Baker told them that it would inconvenience her singing business if she was to go to the fields. The court was unimpressed by Baker's claims of illness and, as the only reason she produced a medical certificate was to avoid attending the fields, decided to find against Baker. Despite this, when Baker finally left Western Australia in 1907 she had established a solid reputation, with The Bunbury Herald describing her as \\"perhaps the best mezzo soprano vocalist in the State\\". For many years afterwards her achievements and performances in Sydney were reported in the West Australian press. Her husband, Charlie Hall, was still living in Western Australia, but despite the fact that Baker only came to Perth with the Tivolli company, the Truth reported that \\"there seemed no regret for 'the man she had left behind her.'\\" ==Return to Sydney== Baker returned to Sydney in the late part of 1907, and her first performance was for the Highland Society. She quickly started a new juvenile choir at Nicolson and Co., a piano importer then situated in George St, Sydney. She had soon enrolled over 60 students, with her first concert being held in aid of the Perth Children's Hospital, where she raised over ¬£43. By March 1908 she also commenced teaching singing to young students in Marrickville, with her first concert being held on Friday, 19 June 1908 at St James Hall, in Phillip Street, Sydney. It was around this time that she began to be known as Madame Ada Baker, the earliest reference in the press to this new title being in The Sunday Times during August 1908. Baker arranged music for and led the St Cecilia Ladies' Choir in Pymble, where she raised ¬£1000 for the local branch of the British Red Cross Society during World War I. The Sydney Morning Herald said of the choir that \\"Madame Ada Baker's Pymble Cecilia Ladles' Choir can fairly claim to be the original 'All-Girl' Patriotic Entertainers.\\" The choir performed a variety of concerts, including the play The Princess of Poppyland, by C. King Proctor, and the cantata The Hours, by Shapcott Wensley. Over the years, Baker was a prolific fundraiser. She raised money for the Sydney Hospital, assisted with fundraising for the Protestant Orphan's Fair, the Callan Park Hospital for the Insane, the Sydney Mission to Seamen, the Sydney Night Refuge for destitute men, the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, and a number of other charities. Baker showed a particular enthusiasm towards raising funds for the Rachel Forster Hospital for Women and Children, for which she was made a life governor in 1927, and from 1925 to 1932 raised ¬£500 for a permanent cot. In 1932 she raised a further ¬£140 for the hospital. Baker also arranged and performed in numerous concerts, recitals and eisteddfods, including a performance of Stephen Vost Janssen's concert The Rajah's Ruby (in 1921) and operetta The Lucky Dream (in 1930), Arthur A. Penn's light comic opera In Old Havana (in 1928) and The China Shop (in 1937), Franz von Supp√©'s opera Boccaccio (in 1933), Paul Lac√¥me's op√©ra comique Ma Mie Rosette (in 1935), and Robert Planquette's op√©ra comique Les Cloches de Corneville (in 1939). Starting in mid 1925, Baker arranged radio programmes and had her juvenile students broadcast over the radio, normally on 2FC. ==Later life== Baker continued working throughout her life and remained deeply involved in teaching children how to sing. In March 1933 she was elected to the executive of the Australian Music Teachers' Alliance and on 25 November was elected vice-president. She was reelected to this position in 1934 and 1935. She gave two lectures for the Music Teachers' Alliance: the first in July 1934 was on \\"The Training of Children's Voices\\" and the second, given in August 1938, was on English music of the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries. By 1939 she had become an active member of the Nothing Under Seventy club, whose members were exclusively seventy years of age and above, regularly giving performances and remaining involved in charity work with the other members. She continued to raise funds for charity. In 1945, after one of her grandchildren died in the RAF, she setup the \\"Grandmothers' Victory Bond League\\" to aid funding for Australia's fight in the Second World War. This, she said, would \\"give grandmothers a chance to do what they can to help fill the Third Victory Loan\\". Baker worked till she was 82, but retired after she was injured in a motor vehicle accident. Upon her retirement, over 60 students and former pupils arranged a testimonial concert for her to be held at Sydney Town Hall. The concert was held on Thursday 14 July 1949, but she was too sick to attend. She died at her Pymble home on 24 July 1949. Services were held at St. Swithen's Church in Pymble, and she was interred at Northern Suburbs Crematorium. Ada Baker Street in Forde, Australian Capital Territory is named in her honour. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1866 births Category:1949 deaths Category:Australian sopranos ","title":"Ada Winifred Weekes Baker"},{"id":"63775323","text":"The General Dynamics Griffin is a series of armoured fighting vehicles under development by General Dynamics Land Systems for the United States Army.

Although several novels were published posthumously, A Few Green Leaves was the final novel she worked on. ==Synopsis== Anthropologist Emma Howick arrives in a small English village in the late 1970s, wanting to write a piece on how village life has changed (or not changed). Emma spends her days trying to examine the residents, treating them as subjects for her paper, including the vicar and his sister, the feuding local doctors and their wives, a food critic, and the resident spinsters and bohemians. Emma ponders whether she could adjust permanently to village life, and notes the changes that time has wrought on local customs. Among them are the decline of the manor house, which was once the site of regular gatherings for locals, but is now off limits, and the life of the vicar, Tom. Whereas previous generations of vicars were cared for by the community, with dinner invites most nights, Tom struggles to get support from the residents, and is largely unable to cook or perform basic functions for himself. As in early Pym novels, the Anglican church plays a key role, even though by now the local church attracts few attendees. Emma is a steadfastly single woman, to the disapproval of her mother and others, who seem to see her career goals as incomplete without marriage. Emma faces two potential love matches. First, her former lover Graham Pettifer - also an academic - rents a cottage near the village to complete a text he is working on, and Emma feels herself pulled back into his life. She finds herself unappealing next to her love rival, the glamorous Claudia. Second, the vicar Tom's sister moves away, leaving him to his own devices, and he begins to view Emma as a romantic partner. Ultimately, Emma chooses to remain in the village, write a novel, and pursue a relationship with Tom. Although much has declined in village life, Emma decides to step back from her objective scientific view of the community and join them. ==Publication history== Pym had worked and lived in London since 1946, but in 1971 she moved with her sister Hilary to a cottage in the Oxfordshire countryside, and lived there permanently after her retirement in 1974 from her professional career as an editor and assistant on an academic journal. Since moving to Finstock, Pym had wanted to write another novel set in a village, like her early novels had been. She was especially interested in the way that village life had changed since she began writing her first novel in 1936. As was her custom, Pym kept detailed notebooks on her observances of daily life, and had been making notes that would form the book at least as early as 1976. Pym wryly commented that the new novel may be a letdown after her more pointed social commentaries, \\"a dull village novel with no bi- or homosexuality;Pym 1984, p.319 Pym had written sympathetic homosexual characters as early as 1958's A Glass of Blessings, long before it was fashionable or socially acceptable to do so. Pym considered several working titles for the novel including Two Green Apricots, The Nectarine and the Cuckoo, Green Desert, Green Paradise and Dog's Mercury Green Leaves: The Journal of the Barbara Pym Society, November 2005, p.13 Pym noted in a letter on 25 October 1978 that she was struggling to write the novel however by 14 February 1979 she had finished the first draft.Pym 1984, pages 321-323 Around that time, Pym was diagnosed with a malignant tumour, a return of the breast cancer she had successfully battled in 1971. She was told that she likely did not have long to live, which compelled Pym to attempt to complete the final copy of the novel.Holt 1990, p.271 By August, she was still attempting to refine the novel but was beginning to feel the effects of chemotherapy and her degraded physical condition. Pym finished A Few Green Leaves in October 1979.Pym 1984, p. 333 She was not entirely happy with the quality of the final version, but no longer had the strength to keep writing. In Pym's initial draft of the novel, Emma's decision to stay in the village and pursue the love affair was present, but it was more tentative; she made the decision more concrete in the final draft Pym died on 11 January 1980. The novel was published the same year by Macmillan in Great Britain and E.P. Dutton in the United States. Pym's literary executor Hazel Holt helped finalise revisions after Pym's death.Holt, p.279 The novel was released as an audiobook in the 1980s by Chivers Press narrated by Jan Francis. The novel was published in Italy in 1994 as Qualche foglia verde and in France in 1987 as Un brin de verdure. ==Critical response== Reviews of A Few Green Leaves were more mixed than its immediate predecessors, Quartet in Autumn and The Sweet Dove Died, which had been successful. The New York Times regarded the novel as equal to anything Pym had previously written Auchincloss, Eve, Surprises of Comedy and Sadness, The New York Times, 1 Feb 1981, accessed 26 April 2020 and Penelope Fitzgerald - reviewing for the London Review of Books - found it to be the work of a \\"brilliant comic writer\\".Fitzgerald, Penelope, A Secret Richness, London Review of Books, 20 November 1980, accessed 26 April 2020 However Kirkus Reviews felt that the book was \\"minor Pym--really just a neutral-toned catchall of her acute angles on loneliness and the ravages of time-marching- on\\", but would appeal to her devoted fans.Kirkus Reviews, 1 September 1980, accessed 26 April 2020 Pym's longtime friend, literary critic Robert Liddell, referred to the book and its sombre-but-hopeful tone as \\"Barbara's farewell to her readers\\".Holt 1990, p.268 Critics have examined the way in which Pym shows how \\"[m]odernity has crept into this more contemporary version of provincial life\\", including the changes in gender norms represented by the married couples in the book, the impact of modern technology, and the way in which the vicar's central role in village life in previous generations has largely been supplanted by doctors and self-sufficiency.Rossen 1987, pages 157-158 Janice Rossen sees the novel as a final statement by Pym on life. \\"[It] is a novel about older, single people who live self-consciously and carefully, on occasion bravely. And so, it seems, did Pym\\".Rossen 1987, p.178\\" Nicholas Shrimpton, writing in New Statesman, also saw the novel as a reflection on Pym's own relationship with the world.Shrimpton, Bucolic Bones, in New Statesman, 15 August 1980, p.17 ==Connections to other works== Pym's novels regularly feature reappearances of characters from previous novels. Here, the character of Wilf Bason from A Glass of Blessings is mentioned, and Tom reads the obituary of Fabian Driver, one of the main characters in Jane and Prudence. Most notably, Emma attends the memorial service of anthropological research assistant Esther Clovis. Esther appeared in three Pym novels, starting with Excellent Women, and her memorial service is also seen - from a different point of view - in the novel An Academic Question. Numerous characters from Excellent Women and Less than Angels appear briefly at the memorial. Pym considered having the characters of Letty and Marjorie, from her novel Quartet in Autumn, come to live in the village in A Few Green Leaves.Pym 1984, p.308 ==References== Category:1978 British novels Category:Novels by Barbara Pym Category:E.

Eddy Goldfarb (born Adolph Goldfarb 1921, Chicago, Illinois) is an American toy inventor, best known for inventing Yakity Yak Teeth, Battling Tops, Vac-u- form, KerPlunk, and Stompers. ==Early life== Eddy Goldfarb was born in 1921 in Chicago, Illinois the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland and Romania. His birth name was Adolph and he was one of 3 children: Bernard was five years older and Bunny (Bernice) was two years younger. Even as a young child, Adolph was interested in how things work. He recalls that when he was around five years old, his father Louis brought home a radio and when it didn't play, he gave it to Adolph to take apart to see how it worked. He remembers that it was one of the best toys he ever had. Louis worked as a tailor in a garment factory and sold goods on a pushcart on Maxwell Street to make extra money. Louis died in 1933 at the young age of 44 and Adolph's life changed dramatically. He was 12 years old, and along with his brother and mother Rose, they worked to support the family. He worked delivering newspapers and groceries. But one of his best jobs was working as a soda jerk for Schuster's Drug Store. And it was there that his friends stopped calling him Adolph (in reaction to Adolf Hitler‚Äôs rise to power) and started calling him Eddy. And he became known as Eddy from that point forward. Eddy excelled in math and science in high school, and was interested in studying physics, but he knew college would have to wait until he could afford the tuition. A big turning point in Eddy's life was World War II. When Pearl Harbor was bombed, Eddy enlisted in the Navy and enrolled in a special program to learn about radar. The Navy sent him to the University of Houston where he studied electrical engineering and then to a secret lab at Naval Station Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay to specialize in radar. As a radar technician, Eddy volunteered for submarine duty and was assigned to the submarine the USS Batfish. It was still under construction and he was on the first crew to take it out to sea. He was allowed to bring only one sea bag aboard, and he filled it with clothing, books and a spool of magnetic wire which he used to build tiny motors. While at sea, Eddy invented a specialized radar antenna. He also had a sketchbook filled with drawings of his inventions. and he decided that if he wanted to be an independent inventor, he needed to specialize in one industry, and he chose toys. After the war, Eddy returned to Chicago where he met Anita, who he proposed to the day after he met her at a dance, and they were married nine months later. Anita agreed to support Eddy for two years while he pursued his dream to become an independent inventor. ==Career as an inventor== His first item he sold was the wild idea of the Yakity Yak Teeth, a simple gag item, which became a cultural icon. He hooked up with promoter Marvin Glass and they brought the Yakity Yak teeth to novelty king Irving Fishlove. And Eddy kept inventing, working day and night, coming up with new ideas, and making the models himself. In 1949, Eddy had 3 toys at the Toy Association's Toy Fair in New York, the toy industry's annual showcase‚ÄîYakity Yak Teeth (Fishlove), Busy Biddy Chicken (Topic Toys) and Merry-Go-Sip (Topic Toys). All three toys were really big hits and Eddy's career was launched. Eddy always wanted to live in California and in 1952, Eddy, Anita and their 2-year-old daughter Lyn moved to Los Angeles. Marvin was angry at him for moving and refused to send Eddy any of the royalties owed to him. While California represented a new start, Eddy and Anita had a tough time financially. They moved into a modest home in the San Fernando Valley and Eddy set up a model shop in their one car garage. Marvin was angry at him for moving and refused to send Eddy any of the royalties owed to him. Times were so difficult that when their daughter Fran was born in 1953, Eddy didn't have enough money to pay the hospital bill. He tells the story of how he went to the home of Lew Glaser of Revell Toys that night with a new toy idea and walked out with a check. By the time, their son Martin was born in 1957, Eddy's business had grown. He soon outgrew his shop in the garage, and at the height of his success, Eddy owned 3 buildings and employed 39 people - model makers, industrial designers, engineers, sculptors and support staff. Eddy designed a wide range of toys, games, novelties and hobby kits for boys and girls of all ages. He invented more than 800 toys and holds close to 300 patents. Some of his most successful toys were: Yakity Yak Teeth, Battling Tops, Vac-u-form, Arcade Basketball, KerPlunk, Hydro Strike, Giant Bubble Gun, Baby Beans, Stompers, Shark Attack, Numbers Up, Quiz Wiz, Poppin Hoppies, Beware the Spider!, Chutes Away, Marblehead, and Snakes Alive!. He sold toys to most of the toy companies in the U.S. and then branched out to Europe and Asia. He had a particularly close working relationship with two of his designers, his associate Del Everitt on Stompers and Rene Soriano on KerPlunk. In 1998, Eddy formed a new partnership with his son Martin (the inventor of Shark Attack). And to this day, Eddy & Martin Goldfarb and Associates are continuing to invent toys and games. In 2003, Eddy was inducted in the Toy Industry Hall of Fame, and in 2010, received the TAGIE (Toy and Game Innovation) Lifetime Achievement Award from the Chicago Toy and Game Group. He was the first American to receive the I.D.I.O.T. (International Designer and Inventor of Toys) at the UK Toy Inventors‚Äô Dinner at the London Toy Fair. In addition to Eddy's career inventing toys, he worked with Hank Saperstein to design and manufacture toy premiums for Kelloggs Cereal, and they worked with Elvis Presley to create an Elvis plastic figurine (which was never released). As part of their collaboration, Anita answered Elvis's fan mail. Eddy also designed spy devices and gadgets for the TV show The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.. In 1985, Eddy was one of first toy inventors to venture into video games (EPYX Barbie and Hot Wheels) but chose not to continue, focusing instead on his passion-designing toys. ==2010-2020== Today, 98 year old Eddy Goldfarb lives in a retirement community, where he has transformed his garage into a machine shop. He works every day designing new toys and creating helpful devices for seniors He is a collector of porcelain lithophanes (19th century translucent pictures) and now creates his own lithophane photographs on his 3D printer. He is a prolific writer of short stories, with more than one hundred and fifty 100 word stories, which capture the stories of his life as well as the fiction of his imagination. He exercises and walks a mile or two every day. ==Personal life== Eddy married Anita June Stern in 1947 and they were married for 65 years until her death in 2013. He is now in the 6th year of a new relationship with Greta Honigsfeld who also lives in the retirement community. Eddy has 3 children: Lyn Goldfarb b. 1950; Fran Goldfarb b. 1953 and married to Jim Devine; and Martin Goldfarb, b. 1957. He has two grandchildren, Rene, b. 1990, son of Lyn Goldfarb and Anatoli Ilyashov (deceased); and Guthrie b. 1990, son of Fran Goldfarb and Jim Devine.

The first report released on 14 June 2018 was the first ever issued by the United Nations on human rights in Kashmir. The second update report was released on 8 July 2019. The first report covered June 2016 to April 2018 while the second report covered the period May 2018 to April 2019. In both cases the reactions of Pakistan and India were diametrically opposite. == First report == The \\"Report on the Situation of Human Rights in Kashmir: Developments in the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir from June 2016 to April 2018, and General Human Rights Concerns in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan\\" was released on 14 June 2018. The first report was released under Zeid Ra‚Äôad Al Hussein. The report was compiled through information already available in the public domain as the United Nations team was not given access to the region by either India or Pakistan. Pakistan largely backed the report, especially the setting up of an international inquiry. In official communication Pakistan denied any equivalence with what was happening on both sides of the LoC. The Indian media also denied any similarity between what was happening on either side. India officially rejected the report calling it a violation of its \\"sovereignty and territorial integrity\\" as well as being a \\"selective compilation of largely unverified information\\" that was published with bias and prejudice. India's official spokesperson also claimed that entities such as \\"Azad Jammu and Kashmir\\" and \\"Gilgit-Baltistan\\" did not exist. The report noted the activities engaged in by the militants on both sides of the border; how pro-India advocates have been killed by militants on the Pakistan side, and how militants on the Indian side engage in violence and scare tactics. == Second report == The \\"Update of the Situation of Human Rights in Indian-Administered Kashmir and Pakistan-Administered Kashmir from May 2018 to April 2019\\" was released on 8 July 2019. The second report was released under UN human rights head Michelle Bachelet. The report questioned India's crowd control measures in the region, investigations into alleged extrajudicial killings and legal immunity for security forces. Similarities were drawn between the situation in IaK and PaK. The report mentioned that people in Gilgit-Baltistan were \\"deprived of a number of fundamental human rights\\", \\"members of nationalist and pro-independence political parties\\" as well as journalists faced political threats and harassment. The report did note that journalists are able to collect information more freely on the Indian side. Following the publication India called the report \\"a continuation of the earlier false and motivated narrative\\", and declined communication with any United Nations special rapporteurs on the reports. China reacted to the two reports by saying that India and Pakistan should take no unilateral decision with relation to Kashmir; and that the human rights of Kashmiris should be respected. ==References== Category:Kashmir conflict Category:Human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir == Further reading == ","title":"OHCHR reports on Kashmir"},{"id":"63775769","text":"The Clockwork Prologue https://gandalfsfist.com/the-clockwork-prologue is the seventh studio album by the English progressive rock band Gandalf's Fist.

The Prologue is really a tale within a tale, that fits somewhere, though where is a complete mystery to me. [...] In adding to the Cogtopolis storyline, it builds a little flesh on the original story, and what was an epic listen evolves into a saga.

Her handling of the COVID-19 pandemic brought her widespread visibility. ==Background== Russell grew up in Bathurst. Both anglophones, her parents nevertheless had a connection with the French language: her father was an anglophone from Quebec who learned French as an adult, and her mother has Acadian roots. They enrolled young Jennifer in a French-language school from kindergarten to grade 8. Her interest for medicine developed early, as her brother Jamie had type 1 diabetes and became paraplegic at the age of 17, a consequence of a car accident. Her love for music was also strong however, and she enrolled in a Bachelor of Arts at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. She studied Science at University of New Brunswick, Medicine at Memorial University of Newfoundland and was a resident in family medicine at Dalhousie University. She joined the Canadian Forces while studying medicine, through the Canadian Forces Medical Officer Training Program. For half of her ten years in the Canadian Forces, she served as Base Surgeon at Ottawa's National Defense Medical Clinic. She got involved in preventive medicine and immunization. Her years in the Forces also led her to Canadian Forces Base Gagetown and she was briefly deployed to Dubai in support to Canada's mission to Afghanistan in 2006. Upon leaving the military, she worked briefly for Veterans Affairs Canada, then in family medicine and mental health in Fredericton, including six years at the Victoria Health Centre's methadone clinic. She joined New Brunswick's public health department in August 2014 as Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health. She was appointed Chief Medical Officer of Health in November 2015. ==COVID-19 pandemic== Russell became a familiar public figure to New Brunswickers during the COVID-19 pandemic, as she took part in daily televised briefings, explaining the extent of the epidemic and the measures put forward by the government to fight it. In addition to informations about the pandemic, Russell frequently suggests to viewers ways to improve their well-being and mental health while in confinement. She asked people to set aside dearly-held traditions such as Easter family gatherings and maintain discipline to limit the spread of the virus, even though new Brunswick is doing better than adjacent jurisdictions. She led or participated in various initiatives to inform New Brunswickers, including a video in which she explains the concept of social distancing to children. Russell makes good use of her proficiency in French, responding to questions in that language to convey information to the province's Acadian population. ==Music== Russell is a singer, composer and lyrics writer in swing and gospel music. She holds a Bachelor in Arts (music) from Dalhousie University, with an emphasis on the piano and saxophone. She sang and played with various bands throughout her studies: concert bands, a saxophone quartet, a Celtic band, a Jazz band with other medical students and the Nova Scotia Wind Ensemble. Talking about her lifelong artistic pursuits, she said in 2017: \\"Music is like breathing, I need music in my life\\". In 2008, Russell was nominated for a Covenant Music Award (best Folk song of the year, jointly with Danny Crain), awarded by the Gospel Music Association Canada. Her swing album, Double Kiss, came out in 2014. Her second swing album, ‚ÄòTriple Step‚Äô was released in 2019 and was a fundraiser for Liberty Lane in Fredericton, NB. ==Personal life== Russell is divorced and has two children, Zachary and Olivia. Her parents still reside in the Bathurst area. ==References== ==External links== *April 8, 2020, coronavirus news conference. *\\"Loose lips sink ships\\": A live swing performance in Fredericton in 2014.

On 29 May 1869 The Catholic Herald and Monthly Summary took over The Irish Harp newspaper. The editor and manager was Benjamin Hoare, succeeded by C. J. Fox BA. Printer and publisher was James O'Dwyer Hennessy (died 13 June 1897) The Catholic Newspaper and Printing Company (Limited) was liquidated in October 1870 due to the depression. Fox was notable for his trenchant criticism of Bishop Sheil's excommunication of Mary MacKillop. Fox was one of many who consistently misspelled the bishop's name as \\"Shiel\\". and ousted from the South Australian Catholic Association, of which he was president. and founding member. The paper was rebranded The Harp and Southern Cross on 5 December 1873 or earlier and published in Adelaide weekly until the 24 December 1875.

He also played one season for Young Fellows Z√ºrich. He played mainly as Striker, but also as midfielder. Suter played his youth football by Basel and joined their first team in their 1939‚Äì40 season under first team co-managers Walter Dietrich and Max Galler. After appearing in three test matches, he played his domestic league debut for the club in the home game at the Landhof on 3 December 1939. He scored his first goal in the same game as Basel won 5‚Äì0 against Solothurn. During the season Suter played five games in the group stage and four in the championship play-offs. He scored five goals, including one in the play-off final against Fribourg as Basel won 2‚Äì1 to become 1 Liga champions. Although Basel won the championship that season, the was no relegation and no promotion due to the second World War. Again in the 1940‚Äì41 season Basel won their 1 Liga group, but in the promotion play-offs Basel were defeated by Cantonal Neuchatel and drew the game with Z√ºrich. Their two play-off opponents were thus promoted and Basel remained for another season in the 1 Liga. August Ibach was the teams top league goal scorer that season with 15 goals. Suter scored nine times and Fritz Schmidlin scored eight times. In the Swiss Cup match on 12 January 1941 Suter scored his first hat-trick for his team as they drew 3‚Äì3 with Nordstern Basel. In the season 1941‚Äì42 Basel were winners of the 1 Liga group East and therefore played a play-off for promotion of the 1 Liga group West, FC Bern. After a goalless first leg away from home, Basel won the return leg 3‚Äì1 and achieved promotion. Suter scored one of the Basel goals in this return leg. Rodolfo Kappenberger was the teams top league goal scorer with 15 goals, player-manager Eugen Rupf scored 14 goals and Suter was third best scorer with 12 goals. In this same season Suter with Basel also qualified for the Swiss Cup final. This ended goalless after extra time and thus a replay was required. The replay was on 25 May in the Wankdorf Stadion. Basel led by half time 2‚Äì0, Schmidlin had scored both goals, but two goals from Grubenmann a third from Neukom gave the Grasshoppers a 3‚Äì2 victory. Basel narrowly missed the sensation. Following their promotion Basel played two mediocre seasons, but staying clear of relegation. Suter played regularly. However, in the season 1944‚Äì45 Suter and his team were again relegated, from the newly arranged Nationalliga A to the Nationalliga B. Suter played only four league games this season. But the team achieved immediate promotion as 1945‚Äì46 Nationalliga B champions a year later. Under trainer Max Barras the team dominated the Nationalliga B that season, in 26 games they won 19, drew five and lost only twice. With 43 points they won the championship four points ahead of Urania Gen√®ve Sport, who were also promoted, and eight points ahead of third placed St. Gallen. There were fourteen teams contesting in the 1946‚Äì47 Nationalliga A, the bottom two teams in the table to be relagted. Basel finished their season in fourth position in the table, with twelve victories from 26 games, scoring in total 60 goals. Traugott Oberer was the teams top goal scorer. Ren√© Bader and Hermann Suter were joint second best, each with 10 goals. FC Biel-Bienne won the championship. Basel advanced to the Swiss Cup-Final, which was played in the Stadion Neufeld in Bern on 7 April 1947. Basel won the final 3‚Äì0 against Lausanne Sport and thus their second cup title. In the Final Paul St√∂cklin scored two goals and Bader the other. The team's new manager Anton Schall led Basel to win the Cup, but he died shortly afterwards at the age of 40 years during a workout on the football field. Following this unhappy event, team captain Ernst Hufschmid later took over as player-manager. Between the years 1939‚Äì1949 and then again between 1956‚Äì1959 Hermann Suter played a total of 301 games for Basel scoring a total of 129 goals. 194 of these games were in the Nationalliga A or 1. Liga, 35 in the Swiss Cup and 72 were friendly games. He scored 79 goal in the domestic league, 25 in the Swiss Cup and the other 25 were scored during the test games. ==References== ==Sources== * Rotblau: Jahrbuch Saison 2017/2018.

Released after Pym's death, the volume was edited by Pym's sister Hilary and her literary executor Hazel Holt. ==Synopsis== The volume contains excerpts from Pym's letters, diaries, and notebooks from 1932 to 1979. The sections contain commentary by Holt and Hilary Pym to provide context on Pym's life, relationships, and career as a novelist. Pym was a dedicated journalist, who detailed her daily life as well as observations about people around her which she might use for a future novel. Pym kept a formal diary separate to her writing observations from 1931 to 1948, after which time she recorded both personal and literary ideas in the same series of notebooks Most years of Pym's adult life are represented, although the diaries are limited for the period 1950‚Äì1962. During this era, as well as publishing six novels, Pym was working full-time at the International African Institute in London and thus had less time to devote to keeping her notebooks. In 1990, Hazel Holt published A Lot To Ask: A Life of Barbara Pym, her biography of Pym. The two books are designed to complement each other; thus, Holt focuses much of her time on the years 1950‚Äì1962, filling out the gaps in the text of A Very Private Eye. Heavily featured are letters between Pym and the poet Philip Larkin. The two authors shared a two-decade correspondence from 1961 until Pym's death, although they did not meet in person until 1975. The volume was published by Macmillan in England, and E.P. Dutton in the United States. ==Context and reception== Barbara Pym's career had stalled after 1961. Having published six novels, she was no longer able to attract a publisher, and did not publish again until 1977, when she was rediscovered after being profiled in the Times Literary Supplement.https://barbara-pym.org/about-barbara-pym- and-her-writings/finding-a-voice/ Pym, Barbara, Finding a Voice, radio talk given 4 April 1978 on BBC Radio 3, archived at The Barbara Pym Society website, accessed 26 April 2020] Upon her rediscovery, Pym published three further novels and was nominated for the 1977 Booker Prize for Quartet in Autumn.

Their design is based on the type T478.1; the main difference is the new, more powerful V12 diesel engine. ==History== In the 1960s, the number of powerful diesel locomotives for mainline service in the former Czechoslovakia was still insufficient. The T478.1 class performed well, but they were less powerful than the heaviest passenger steam locomotives. The new type of locomotive was to be equipped with a V12 diesel engine of a newly developed class with 230 mm bore. The new engine was able to run at higher RPM and thus develop more power at the output of the traction generator at high locomotive speeds than the older designs. The engines were expected to be produced in I6, I8, V12 and V16 configuration with as much as 2 817 kW power output. Only the I6 and V12 configuration entered mass production. I8 was made only as a prototype, V16 was never produced. In Ostrava,1986 The first two prototypes of the T478.3 class, T478.3001 and 3002, were finished in the middle of 1968 and were immediately put into heavy testing. The first prototype had a prototype diesel with 220 mm bore, which was soon replaced with a new one with standard 230 mm bore, set to 1470 kW output power. The gear ratio of the traction motors was modified and the maximum speed increased to 120 km/h. These modifications have shown excessive wear to the components and were removed after the end of the trials. The prototypes could be dustinguished by the use of plain metal on the locomotive body. Corrugated metal was used on series production locomotives. The pre- production series of ten locomotives was manufactured in 1970 and regular series were supplied since the end of 1971. The last locomotive was delivered in 1978. ==Operation== The new locomotives were immediately put into the most demanding operations, previously served by the most powerful steam locomotives. Soon, serious problems arose, mostly electric equipment flashovers and diesel engine failures. The situation was so bad that some of the already withdrawn steam locomotives had to be put back into service. For this reason, regular passenger steam services continued until 1978. After some modifications, the T478.3 became reliable, although they required more thorough maintenance than the older T478.1. in 1988, the numbering system changed and the locomotives were assigned Class 753. The steam-heating era At the beginning of the 1990s, the ƒåSD decided to switch from steam train heating to the much more convenient electric heating. The only diesel locomotives capable of the electric heating were the 754 class. It was decided to rebuild some of the steam-heating diesels to electric heating. Since 1991, 163 machines of the Class 753 had been equipped with an electric heating alternator instead of the steam generator and renumbered to Class 750. The locomotives kept their operating numbers. The steam heating has not been used since the end of the 1990s and the remaining locomotives of the original class continued to be used in freight transport. 753.301 As the electrification of the rail network proceeded, the need for powerful diesel locomotives decreased and the rail operator preferred the less powerful, but more rugged and fuel- efficient 751 class. Since the 1990s, the 753 class has been gradually withdrawn both in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and either reconstructed, stored for future use or scrapped. Since 2011, only a single locomotive of the original class, 753.301, remained in regular operations of the national freight operator ƒåD Cargo. As of April 2020, it is still operational and used in freight service in northeastern Bohemia. A few other non-reconstructed locomotives, including the first prototype, are preserved as museum units. ==Reconstructions== ===Class 750=== Since 1991, 163 locomotives of the original class have been equipped with 3000 V electric train heating generator to satisfy the growing need for head-end power for new passenger cars. The locomotives received numerous other modifications to enhance their reliability and performance. Many of them have had their bogies modified to a new type of main frame suspension. As the network electrification continued, the demand for the locomotives soon decreased. Some of the locomotives have been withdrawn after a few years of service. Czech Railways have withdrawn the last locomotive from the passenger service in 2014. As of April 2020, some units of this class are still in use in freight transport by ƒåD Cargo and some private operators. The Slovak national operator ≈Ωelezniƒçn√° spoloƒçnos≈• Slovensko uses a few of them in passenger service. ===Class 755 (≈ΩSR)=== 755 ≈ΩSR An outstanding reconstruction has been performed on a single locomotive in the middle of the 1990s in Slovakia. The locomotive received an entirely new composite body, a Pielstick 12 PA 4 - 185 engine set to 1470 kW, a traction alternator and rectifier and a new control system. The whole project has been plagued by corruption reaching the top government officials. The locomotive has never been put into a fully operational order and after few trials, the whole project has been cancelled. The locomotive has been kept in storage until today. ===Class 752 (Czech Rep.), D 752 (Italy)=== Private 752 in the Czech Rep. In 1996, one locomotive of the original 753 class has been fitted with a K 6 S 310 DR engine recovered from a withdrawn 770/771 locomotive and assigned Class 752. The aim was to replace the troublesome K 12 V 230 DR engine with a less powerful, but more reliable design. After 2000, 9 more locomotives have been supplied to private freight operators in Italy. Four more have been delivered to a Czech private freight company. The reconstruction has not been very successful and no more locomotives have been modified in this way. ===Class 755, 753.7 (Czech Rep.), 756 (ZSSK), D 753 (Italy)=== Class D 753 in Italy Since 2001 until 2011, 106 locomotives of both the original 753 and 750 classes have been extensively rebuilt using a new Caterpillar 3512 B DI-TA engine and a new electronic control system. The first 31 pieces have been sold to private freight operators in Italy. More orders were placed by Czech freight operators, both private and state-owned. Ten locomotives have been reconstructed in the same way in Slovakia. ===Class 750.7 (ƒåD), 757 (ZSSK)=== Since 2010, reconstructions similar to the 753.7 class, but equipped with an electric train heating generator, have been done in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. 19 locomotives have been delivered to Czech Railways and 25 to ≈Ωelezniƒçn√° spoloƒçnos≈• Slovensko ===Class 753.6 (Czech Rep.)=== SD Since 2012, a reconstruction similar to the Class 753.7, but with an entirely new locomotive body, has been carried out on 18 locomotives for numerous freight operators in the Czech Republic. == References == Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of Slovakia Category:ƒåKD diesel-electric locomotives Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of Czechoslovakia Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Czechoslovakia Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of the Czech Republic Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1968 Category:Bo‚Ä≤Bo‚Ä≤ locomotives Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the Czech Republic Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Slovakia ","title":"ƒåSD Class T478.3"},{"id":"63776079","text":"The Lands of Blacklaw formed a small property of five merks worth, in the Lordship of Stewarton at the eastern extremity of Strathannick, between the hamlet of Kingsford in East Ayrshire and the East Renfrewshire boundary, Scotland. It was first recorded in 1484 in the Acta Auditorum. Black Law is a prominent whinstone crag lying above Blacklaw Hill Farm. ==History== ===The Estate and farms=== Datestone on the Old Blacklaw Bridge. Timothy Pont described the property in the early 17th century as \\"A pretty extensive range of land, now divided into several farms bearing the names of \\"Blacklaw\\", one of which is distinguished as Blacklaw-hill. It is situated in the north-east extremity of the parish of Stewarton, on the confines of Renfrewshire.\\" A prominent feature is described as \\"On the farm called Blacklaw-hill is a mount, or small hill, of a conical shape, covered with a beautiful verdure, at the base of which are to be found some fine old trees, indicating the site of a Mansion in former times.\\" In 1820 the lands of Whitelaw and Blacklaw amounted to 700 acres and the proprietors \\"live also together in townships\\". The valued rent of the three properties at Blacklaw were William Gray at ¬£62; John Brown at ¬£62 and Thomas Wallace at ¬£52. Black Law has had a number of whinstone quarries for local use, such as the steadings, drystone dykes and the Old Blacklaw Bridge. A track led up from Blacklaw Hill Farm to the site. Laird's house Roughwood near Beith. A prominent feature is described by Timothy Pont in the early 17th century \\"On the farm called Blacklaw-hill is a mount, or small hill, of a conical shape, covered with a beautiful verdure, at the base of which are to be found some fine old trees, indicating the site of a Mansion in former times.\\" The small conical hill remains in situ, much as described here. Given the early seventeenth century date of Pont's survey any previous mansion house would date from the time where buildings would have some form of defensive fortification as in a typical Scottish tower castle. The site was once surrounded by a drystone dyke, possibly recycling stone from an old building, to exclude grazing animals and a few old beech trees remain. The conical hill is not listed as a site of archaeological interest and appears never to have been surveyed or excavated, so no information exists as to whether it is entirely natural and if it was used as a motte, a defensive site of some sort or as a Moot Hill, Court Hill or Gallows Hill. The Lands of Blacklaw were part of the Lordship of Stewarton in 1484 and in 1685 the lands are referred to as a 'Lairdship', defined as \\"A barony or lordship; from an early date, the estate or territory under the jurisdiction of a laird or small baron or freeholder.\\"Dictionary of Scots A Laird's dwelling would have been one of the Blacklaw dwellings. The lands passed into the hands of the Cunninghames of Corshill until they were granted to John Brown in Gabrochhill in 1687. ===Old Blacklaw Bridge=== The Old Blacklaw Bridge across the Annick Water The Annick Water lies to the south of the lands of Blacklaw with a bridge (NS465494) carrying a datestone on the upstream side with the initials 'I.Brown' and the dates 1770 and 1881 implying construction and later renovation although the style, execution and weathering of the carving on soft sandstone suggests that the dates, etc. are contemporary with each other and therefore the actual carving is no older than 1818. The 'I' stands for Iohannes which is now written as 'John' and the surname indicated the Brown family, originally of Gabrochhill where they had resided for many generations. The date '1770' has an odd first numeral shaped almost as a 'J'. The bridge is constructed of whinstone, wide enough for horse drawn vehicles and has mostly lost it's low side walls. The datestone is not located as a keystone on the arch of the bridge and therefore could have been inserted at any time, in addition, as stated, it is made of red sandstone. The head waters of the Annick Water are comparatively shallow and even in winter a ford might have sufficed. Blacklaw farm tenants are shown to have had fields here as indicated by the field boundarys marked on Roy's map of 1747 and a track leads up on to Glenouther MoorRenfrewshire XVIII.6, Revised: 1895, Published: 1897 where the common grazings were located and peats may have been dug. The same map shows a sheep ree on a field boundary, used as a permanent stone sheep-pen where sheep could be confined during poor weather, for shearing, etc. ===The Blacklaw Lairds, tenants, etc.=== Robert Aitken's 1829 map of Blacklaw and the surrounding farms. In 1484 the tak of the three merks worth lands of Cockilbie and the five merks worth lands of Blacklaw were in dispute and a special writ by the king awarded the tak to \\"Dauid Lindissa and his spous the wif of umquhile Jenkin Stewart\\". David Lindsay's dispute was with John Ross of Montgreenan. The 10 merk land of Blacklaw and Blacklawhill passed into the hands of the Cunninghames of Corshill and on 23 September 1687 Sir Alexander Cuninghame and his mother, Lady Corshill, Dame Mary Stewart, granted a charter of the 2.5 merk land of Blacklawhill to John Brown in Gabrochill (sic). Dobie comments that all the eldest sons were called John, not commonplace outside of the aristocracy. This John married Elizabeth Brown and had five offspring, John, the eldest. inheriting and marrying Jean Allison of Milton, East Kilbride and having four offspring. Their eldest son John inherited and married Janet Cuthbertson of Carswell, Neilston. They had seven offspring and the eldest, John, inherited in 1750, marrying Grizel Mitchel of Langreen, Loudoun parish. In 1778 their only son John inherited, marrying Elizabeth Deans of Peacockbank and having six children, followed by a second marriage to Margaret Gray of Irvine and the couple having three children. John, the eldest, inherited in 1846 and married Mary Kerr of Stewarton. The couple had offspring, John, William, Andrew, James and four daughters. The Annick Water looking downstream from the bridge. In 1747 Jean, only daughter of John Brown of Blacklawhill married William Mackie of Fulwood and Easter-house of Corshill. John Brown of Gabrochhill's only daughter, Mary, married Mathew Arnot Stewart, representing the Stewarts of Newton and the Arnots of Lochridge. He died in 1796 and his son Mathew (sic) succeeded him. The court book of the Barony of Corshill and Cocklbee in 1666 lists the occupiers of the Lands of Blacklaw as William Fultoune (thair); Alexander Fultoune; Alexander Thomsoune; Robert Faullis; Robert Walker; James Faullis and Robert Waker. In May 1685 the tenants of the lairdship beneath the Black Law were pursued by the Barony Court for \\"cutting of young root grown trees within the parkes of Corshill\\" In December 1701 John Brown and Robert Faullis of Blacklaw were requested by the Barony Court judge to assess how many swine could be grazed on the common pasturage of Hareshaw and Corshouse. They were to assess also which of the two farmers involved suffered most by the overgrazing by the other. In May 1707 Sir Alexander Cunninghame of Corshill claimed against Janet Thomsone, John Brown and Andrew Faullis of Blacklaw at the Barony court for continuing to eat and destroy \\"the wast grassis of the maillen of Blacklaw\\". They were instructed to cease eating \\"the said wast grass with bestial, goodes, and gear\\" immediately and informed that the \\"bestial, goodes, and gear\\" would be \\"poyndit\\", that is confiscated and possibly sold if found breaking this sentence of the court. Despite being warned and informed the defenders did not attend the court held in Stewarton. The Ayrshire Ordnance Survey name book of 1855 to 1857 records Midtown of Blacklaw as a\\" farmhouse with outbuildings garden etc. the property of Dr. Brown Stewarton; Townhead of Blacklaw as a \\"farmhouse with outbuildings garden - the property of Allen Brown Esqr. Brom\\"; Lowtown of Blacklaw as a \\"farmhouse with extensive outbuildings etc. The property of Mr. Thomas Wallace - Stewarton\\" and Blacklawhall aka Blacklawhill as a \\"neat farmhouse with very extensive outbuildings, the property of the Occupier Mr. J. Brown.\\"Ayr Ordnance Survey Name Book. 1855-1857. ==The Moor of Machirnock (Glenouther)== The old sheep ree, field boundary and Glenouther Moor. This was a very large and valuable area of common grazing immediately to the south of Blacklaw, then known as Machirnock or Maucharnock,Moll, Herman, d. 1732. The Shire of Renfrew with Cuningham [i.e. Cunningham]. The North Part of Air [i.e. Ayr] / by H. Moll. now known as Glenouther Moor. The Cunningham and Mure families were often in dispute over their rights regarding grazing, etc. and a royal letter of 1534 states that the Cunninghams had not been invested in the moor and it was decided that the souming was split between Polkelly and Rowallan. The souming was the number or proportion of cattle which each tenant was entitled to keep on the common grazing.Researcher's Guide Retrieved : 2011-06-10 In 1594 William Mure of Rowallan complained of the excess of Polkelly's grazing cattle and geese on the moor, despite having obtained a caution of lawburrows on May 20, 1593. Lawburrows was a letter in the monarch's name under the signet seal to the effect that a particular person had shown cause to dread harm from another, and that therefore this other complained of was commanded to find \\"sufficient caution and surety\\" that the complainer would be free from any violence on his part.Researcher;s Guide Retrieved : 2011-06-10 The Barony Court records show that some local farms had access to the common grazing and that may have included the Blacklaw farms. The Robertland Estate was put up for sale in 1913, consisting of , with as woodland and as moss, 26 farms were present and shooting rights were held for Glenouther Moor. The moor is now mainly afforested with pine trees. ==Cartographic evidence== Roy's map of 1747 shows a well laid out grouping of three dwellings below Blacklaw Hill and Blacklaw Townhead above to the north-east. Corshouse and Hareshaw farms lay on the Glenouther Moor side of the Annick Water.Roy Lowlands 1752-55 In 1856 Blacklawhill, Lowtown of Blacklaw and Midtown of Blacklaw are shown with Townhead of Blacklaw to the north-east.

It is part of the red-light district, which is bounded by Reuterstra√üe, Goethestra√üe, Reitwallstra√üe and Am Marstall and is crossed by Scholvinstra√üe. The street is known for prostitution and strip clubs. ==History== The name of the street derives from the riding facilities it contained and the proximity to the city wall. On an 1834 map it is shown as the \\"riding by Hanover's walls of fortification\\" and ran from Steintor towards the Leine (A tributary of the river Aller). There was a riding school, a riding arena and stables, which belonged to the court stables of the Leineschloss. Around the middle of the 19th century, the street was renamed Schillerstra√üe (later renamed Am Marstall), and the name Reitwallstra√üe given to the side street that currently bears the name. No. 15 Reitwallstra√üe was the location of the printing and publishing house called Berenbergsche Buchdruckerei, which published, amongst others, the 1846 court and state handbook for the Kingdom of Hanover. ==Modern times== The street now extends between Goethestra√üe and Am Marstall. The situation in Reitwallstra√üe is rated by the police as \\"delicate\\". 300 crimes occurred in this area alone between early 2009 and 2010. Reitwallstrasse is considered a retreat for drug dealers and thugs. The road was declared a \\"dangerous place\\" for the purposes of the Lower Saxony law on public order and safety. The entertainment area of the red light district with brothels, strip clubs, clubs, bars and tattoo shops was under the control of the Hells Angels for many years. The \\"King\\" of the area was Frank Hanebuth up until 2011. Hanebuth was the leader of the Bones outlaw motorcycle club, which in 1999 amalgamated with the Hells Angels. In 2010, the Hells Angels met with rivals, the Bandidos, in the restaurant Little Italy and under lawyer G√∂tz von Fromberg agreed a \\"peace treaty\\". The Hanover Hells Angels were dissolved in 2012 and the following year the Black Jackets attempted to control the district. The Reitwallstra√üe has declined as a red- light district in recent years. A plan for a new 167 room hotel on the street was proposed in 2019 and also im 2019 the laufhaus Sexworld was closed and converted into 20 apartments. ==See also== * Prostitution in Germany ==References== Category:Hanover Category:Streets in Germany Category:Red-light districts in Germany ","title":"Reitwallstra√üe"},{"id":"63776091","text":"Ilan Mor Ilan Mor is the Ambassador of Israel to Croatia.

His father used to take him out into the forest from a very young age, where he learned to mimic birds. The natural and cultural heritage of his home region became the focus of his life and work: He spent his life documenting the wildlife, landscapes and historical buildings in H√§lsingland. At the age of 15, Hilding Mickelsson bought his first camera, a box camera that cost 9,75 SEK. At the end of the 1940s, he decided to focus on photography, after doing different jobs in his youth; among others, he worked as a consultant for the Rural Economy and Agricultural Society (Hush√•llningss√§llskapet). In 1947, he won the Swedish National Photography Contest (Riksfotot√§vling) in the category A. Around the same time, he and his close friend Martin Holm had the idea to work on a photography book about H√§lsingland, which they published with the title I H√§lsingland in 1954. Hilding Mickelsson also contributed the photographs to Albert Viksten's book Mitt paradis, which was published five years later. An essential part of his work was travelling across Sweden to present his photographs of H√§lsingland, its landscape and historical buildings. He started with presentations after publishing his first book in 1954, and did so for decades: He showed his diapositives, explained the motives and their history and even imitated the depicted birds. H√§lsingland's nature played a special role in Hilding Mickelsson's work. Industrialization and urbanization changed rural Sweden in the second half of the 20th century; with the development of intensive agriculture, farms grew bigger and artificial fertilizers began to have an increasing impact on the environment. In the 1950s and 60s, when climate activism was not common at all, Hilding Mickelsson began raising concerns about environmental issues publicly, for example in local newspapers about local factories polluting the water. However, his engagement also created tensions in his local community, as many people's jobs depended on the local industry. Hence, he also lost commissions in local newspapers. His engagement to preserve did not only include the Swedish nature, but also the cultural heritage of the H√§lsingland region. In his work, he documented the traditions and intangible culture of his region. He also played a special role in taking photographs of the H√§lsingeg√•rdar, farmhouses of special historical value with rich decorations typical for H√§lsingland. Many of them were torn down because of the industrialization of agriculture, new machinery like tractors, and a general increase of prosperity. By documenting their interiors and farmyards, Hilding Mickelsson raised awareness for the value of local cultural heritage. He explored villages systematically by bike, talked to locals, and thoroughly documented the typical paintings on the farmhouses' wooden walls. In many cases, his photographs are the only evidence left ‚Äì in some cases, he documented the farmhouses just before they were torn down. In his lectures across Sweden, he highlighted the need to preserve the built environment of H√§lsingland. The awareness he raised for the specific value of the Farmhouses of H√§lsingland has contributed to their nomination as a World Heritage Site. Another motive central to his work is the wildlife and landscape in H√§lsingland. Patience was crucial for his work: He could sit up to 15 hours in trees to capture birds at the right moment. Asked about his approach, he said: \\"It takes 90 percent patience and 10 percent camera skills\\". In his photographs of landscapes, houses and wildlife, he balanced esthetics and documentation ‚Äì he sometimes also arranged motives and edited his images manually, on the kitchen table. In 1960, his image \\"The great grey owl attacks\\" (Lappugglan anfaller) was featured in Life magazine. He underlined on several occasions that his work and engagement for H√§lsingland would not have been possible without the support of his wife, Ad√©le Mickelsson. She managed the life of the family, including the two sons, even in times when money was scarce or Hilding Mickelsson travelled for months for his lectures. In an interview about his environmental engagement, he said: \\"I did not get any pay, I don't know ‚Äì it is really Ad√©le who kept me alive.\\" Their son Olle described their relationship this way: \\"Without her, my father could have never been the person he was.\\" In 1999, the year she died, he was quoted in a newspaper article: \\"Without Ad√©le, it wouldn't have been possible, she supported me and found solutions when money was tight.\\" In 1991, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in philosophy at Uppsala University. == Legacy == Hilding Mickelsson's images have been printed in international photography magazines. In Europe alone, his photographs have been published in more than 20 countries. The H√§lsinglands Museum preserves his artistic heritage for the future. Since 2003, the museum has been digitizing a collection of about 150,000 of his photographs. More than 72.000 of his images are already available online. In 2004, an association was founded to remember Hilding Mickelsson and his work, the Hilding Mickelsson Society (Hilding Mickelsson S√§llskapet). They also organize the annual Hilding Day (Hildingdagen). == Gallery == File:Hilding Mickelsson box camera.jpgHilding Mickelsson's first camera File:Hilding Mickelsson Rolleiflex.jpgTogether with his friend Martin Holm, Hilding Mickelsson bought this Rolleiflex in 1947 File:Hilding Mickelsson Hasselblad.jpgHilding Mickelsson's Hasselblad camera that he used for more than 40 years File:Hilding Mickelsson honorary doctorate.jpgThe diploma of his honorary doctorate in philosophy at the Uppsala University from 1991 == Bibliography == * Holm, Martin & Hilding Mickelsson (1954): I H√§lsingland.

The book was published in the United States by E.P. Dutton in 1988, and in the United Kingdom by Prospect Books in 1995. ==Contents== Pym published her novels between 1950 and 1980, with many of them exploring the lives of spinsters, Anglican priests, and anthropologists. Especially in her early novels, which take place shortly after World War II when rationing was still in effect, Pym's characters are often noted for their simple meals. Food is often used in Pym's novels as a marker of class or social position, and many of Pym's characters face culinary disasters in her novels.LitHub, accessed 26 April 2020 In Some Tame Gazelle, the protagonist spinster sisters fret over whether to serve cauliflower cheese to the new vicar. When they serve some to a paid domestic, she is disgusted to find that there is a caterpillar on the cauliflower, leading to an awkward situation. In An Unsuitable Attachment, parts of which take place in Rome, English characters struggle to adjust to the food and the cuisine. Concerns about serving, eating, and affording food recur throughout Pym's oeuvre. Wyatt and H. Pym take their inspiration from all 12 of Pym's completed novels. The recipes are accompanied by quotes from the novels. A few of the recipes included were Pym's own. Many of the recipes are staples of English cuisine, and many were seen as old-fashioned by the time of the book's publication. ==Context and critical reception== The 1980s was a peak period for interest in Pym's work, especially in the US.Christopher Fowler, \\"Invisible Ink: No. 68\\", The Independent, 13 March 2011, accessed 30 September 2011 After being ignored by publishers for 16 years, Pym had been rediscovered in 1977. All of her books were republished, and new volumes accepted by publishers, before her death from breast cancer in 1980. As a result of the strong interest, her literary executors made available several previously unpublished novels, an autobiography, and a biography. The cookbook was well-received. Publishers Weekly called it \\"respectfully yet whimsically presented\\" and noted the importance of cooking and other \\"small things in life\\" to Pym's literary style.Publishers Weekly, 3 November 1988, accessed 26 April 2020 The Paris Review notes that, while Pym herself was acknowledged as a good cook, the food featured in her novels is often (deliberately) unsatisfactory, and that renders the idea of a cookbook taken from her works rather unusual to twenty- first century tastes.Stein, Sadie, Salmon Mousse, or Absolute Power, Paris Review, 17 August 2015, accessed 27 April 2020 ==References== Category:Cookbooks Category:British cookbooks Category:1988 non-fiction books ","title":"√Ä La Pym"},{"id":"63776434","text":"Ram√≥n Mej√≠a (born 31 August 1943) is a Mexican equestrian.

Japan is a country of origin, destination, and transit for sexually trafficked persons. Japanese citizens, primarily women and girls, have been sex trafficked within Japan and to a lesser degree abroad. Foreign victims are sex trafficked into the country. Children, minors, and persons from families in poverty are particularly vulnerable to sex trafficking. Sex trafficked victims are deceived, threatened, and forced into prostitution. Their passports and bank documents are often confiscated. Debt bondage is often employed. They suffer from physical and psychological trauma. A number contract sexually transmitted diseases from rape and live in generally poor condition. Some rescued victims face ostracization, depression, and or commit suicide. Online sextortion and the creation of coerced rape pornography are issues. Male and female traffickers in Japan come from a wide range of backgrounds and every social class. Traffickers are often members of or facilitated by crime syndicates, including the yakuza or b≈çryokudan. Sex trafficking is linked to Japan's entertainment and tourism industries, and women and girls are also trafficked to businesses catering to military servicmen and contractors in United States Forces Japan. Traffickers have used the internet websites, email, and apps to lure victims. Japanese nationals have engaged in cybersex trafficking. The scale of sex trafficking in Japan is difficult to know because of the underground nature of sex trafficking crimes, the fact that only a small minority of cases are reported to the authorities, and other factors. The Japanese government has been criticized for its lacking anti-sex trafficking efforts and laws. Some Japanese officials have been accused of being apathetic to the issue. ==Children== Girls, including runaways, are lured, coerced, or forced into prostution in Japan. The creation and sale of child pornography in Japan is a pervasive problem. Some Japanese students have become child prostitutes in ‚Äòhigh school dating‚Äù businesses in Tokyo and other cities.

In 2008, women began disappearing from the Marseille area without any trace left. Despite the investigating authorities' efforts, no bodies were found until statements from a key witness helped relaunch the investigation, which eventually lead them to Salameh. While examining his past, investigators were overwhelmed by his checkered criminal record. In 2014, he was sentenced to life imprisonment with 22 years preventive detention for kidnapping, sequestration and rape leading to death. == Biography == Patrick Salameh was born on April 21, 1957 in Fr√©jus, Var Department. He was born into a large family of Lebanese-Syrian origin, with nine other siblings. When he was a child, the whole family to Marseille. As an adult, Patrick married and later fathered two children. In the 1980s, he ran a restaurant located in the heart of Marseille's sensitive areas. === Earlier crimes === The entirety of Salameh's life is punctuated with delinquent acts. Between September 1988 and February 1989, along with a group of friends, he carried out numerous burglaries in Var. They broke into homes, attacked the residents and stole their valuables, earning the nickname \\"The Wild Horde\\" by the press and the media. Finally, the gang was arrested and imprisoned at the Baumettes Prison. Salameh was accused by his accomplices of being the only violent member, but Patrick denied those claims. On May 10, 1996, he was put on trial before the assizes in Draguignan, accompanied by his three accomplices. At the end of the trial, the jurors deliberated for four hours about the sentences. The prosecutor requested a 20-year sentence for Patrick Salameh, and he was later convicted for armed robbery, sequestration, torture and indecent assault. He was later released after 16 years behind bars. During his years in prison, Salameh wrote and painted, revealing real talent in the latter. His painted canvases were exhibited in several galleries, and often portrayed tortured characters. Upon his release in 2005, he resumed living a normal life, forming a family, exhibiting his works while also working as a site manager. == Case summary == ===Victims=== In 2008, in the span of a little more than a month, three prostitutes mysteriously disappeared in Marseille. They were the following: * Iryna Sytnyk (42) - Ukrainian. Disappeared on the evening of October 5th. * Cristina Bahulea (23) - Romanian. Vanished without a trace two weeks after Sytnyk, on October 22nd. * Zineb Chebout (28) - Algerian. Left her house to visit a fair on the evening of November 7th, but never returned. ===The key witness=== The investigators suspected early on that a serial killer was rampant in Marseille, as he kidnapped and killed victims fitting the same profile - foreign prostitutes. However, they had no clues, and no potential suspects. However, a revelation soon disrupted the course of investigation. A Moroccan prostitute, Soumia El Kandadi, named a man whom she suspected could be responsible for the killings - Patrick Salameh, who on the night of October 5-6, abducted and raped her in his home. When he finished with her, El Kandadi noticed that a lifeless body lied in her attacker's bathtub, with Patrick informing her that \\"this is the fate [he reserves] for women who don't obey [him].\\" Soumia's statements put investigators on the trail for Salameh. Soon after, another clue reinforced their suspicions. The telephone of one of the prostitutes continued to transmit a signal after her disappearance. The police located the signal's source in Marseille: it was a child, which claimed to have been given a SIM card by a certain Patrick Salameh. Patrick Salameh took his victims' SIM cards and later gave them away, a technique which made the police believe that the missing were still alive, since their telephone numbers continued to emit a localizable signal. ===The search=== The investigators, in an attempt to locate the bodies, searched Salameh's residency in Saint-Mitre, in Marseille's northern districts. They were aided by Soumia, whom guided them to the place where she had seen the corpse of a woman, leading them to Patrick's studio apartment adjacent to his main home. Although investigators couldn't find any bodies, they found DNA from all three missing women, as well as some of their personal possessions such as jewelry and underwear. Prostitutes often frequented the apartment, but no traces of blood were discovered. During the pre-trial hearings, Salameh denied killing the prostitutes and remained silent. The bodies were never recovered. ===Link to previous case=== The investigators, whom wondered if there were other possible victims, expanded their search for any women fitting their criteria. Eventually, they linked Salameh to the disappearance of 20-year-old Fatima Saiah, a student who had vanished a few months earlier from the main murder series. Unlike the victims that followed, she was not a prostitute. Fatima had published an offer online as a babysitter, and was later contacted by a divorced man on Saturday afternoon, May 7th. The two men at 3 PM, at the Malpass√© Metro. The man refused to tell his name, but specified that his wife would pick Saiah up in a gray Volkswagen at the metro's exit, which was not far from Salameh's studio apartment. Initially, Fatima's boyfriend accompanied her to the scene, but later left shortly before she met with the man, agreeing to message each other in a few hours. Two hours later, he received a strange text message saying \\"I met an old friend, I will be back this weekend.\\" Finding this suspicious, they boyfriend started worrying and tried to contact Saiah, but failed, as her phone had been turned off. The next day, both Fatima's family and boyfriend went to the police station to report her disappearance. The investigators later traced the phone call Fatima had received for the babysitting offer. It had been made from a telephone booth at Gare de Marseille-Saint-Charles, but that was the only lead they had in the case. A homeless person who was questioned during the investigation later recalled that on that day, he recognized the man using the phone booth as Patrick Salameh. ===Arrest=== On the evening of November 15, 2008, Patrick Salameh was arrested. Immediately after he was jailed, the disappearances in Marseille seized. Salameh's criminal past played no favors on his part. He had recently been released from prison, after serving a 16-year sentence for theft, carrying of illegal weapons, kidnapping and torture. === The trial === Salameh's first trial took place in March 2014, before the assizes in Aix-en-Provence. He was found guilty of kidnapping, forcible confinement and rape causing death in the cases of Sytnyk, Bahulea and Chebout, as well as kidnapping and raping El Kandadi, the main witness in the trial. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. In October 2015, his second trial was held before the assizes in Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne. He was again found guilty of kidnapping and murdering Fatima Saiah, whose body was also never found. He received another life imprisonment term, as well as 22 years of preventive detention. == See also == * List of serial killers by country == References == === Citations === === Bibliography === * Patrick Salameh, The Marseille Disappearances - The Three Prostitutes, Auto-Edition, Marseille, 2015 (1230000499958). * Patrick Salameh, The Marseille Disappearances - The Fatima Case, Auto-Edition, Marseille, 2015 (1230000643757). * St√©phane Bourgoin, Killers - The murderers who marked history, Points, Paris, 2012 (275782810X). * V√©ronique Chalmet, In the minds of killers.

Get angry! #Resign_ParkGeun-hye candlelight vigil (Korean: Î™®Ïù¥Ïûê! Î∂ÑÎÖ∏ÌïòÏûê! #ÎÇ¥Î†§ÏôÄÎùº_Î∞ïÍ∑ºÌòú ÏãúÎØº Ï¥õÎ∂à) is the first candlelight vigil held on October 29, 2016 to demand resignation of President Park Geun-hye. This was a vigil that opened the prelude to a total of 20 candlelight vigils, with 30,000 citizens estimated by organizers(12,000 by police) calling for the resignation of President Park. On October 24, 2016, JTBC reported that they had obtained a tablet PC that seemed to belong to Choi Soon-sil and that it contained the circumstances in which she exchanged presidential speeches that correspond to state secrets. The aftermath of Park Geun-hye‚ÄìChoi Soon-sil Gate began in earnest the next day when the president Park Geun-hye admitted to her private relationship with Choi Soon-sil through a public apology. The huge shock of the civil society over the state-run manipulation of state affairs began to be expressed soon by the university declaration of the state of affairs and rallies, and on October 29, the first weekend since JTBC's report, a massive candlelight vigil was held in downtown Seoul. The first rally began with a pre-candlelight rally at Cheonggye Plaza in Jongno-gu, Seoul, with people from all walks of life making critical remarks and declaring the situation. The plan was to leave Cheonggye Plaza and march in procession to Insa-dong. However, during the march, in Jongno 1-ga, citizens broke through the police cordon and headed for Gwanghwamun Plaza to try to go straight to Cheong Wa Dae. Blocked by police barriers in the square, citizens continued their final confrontation with the police, and the official rally ended at 10 p.m. with organizers announcing the end of the rally. Unlike previous rallies, such as a Minjungchonggwolgi, the demonstration was relatively peaceful. Citizens urged some protesters to refrain from clashes to prevent the protests from turning into violence. In order not to provoke the protesters, the police also did broadcast with polite tone and did not send any tools to suppress citizens like the sprinkler truck. The next day, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency issued an unusual press release expressing gratitude to citizens for their rational cooperation. Meanwhile, the struggle headquarters announced that candlelight vigils will be held every day at Cheonggye Plaza starting with the rally, and announced next week's rally and a large-scale rally on November 12. == Background == Since the suspicion of establishing the Mi-r Foundation was first raised by TV Chosun in August 2016, „ÄäThe Hankyoreh„Äã reported on September 20, 2016 that Choi Soon-sil was involved in the process of establishing the Mir Foundation and the K-SPORTS Foundation, sparking media suspicion surrounding Choi Soon- sil. From late September to early October, social scandals such as the 2016 Ewha Women's University scandal, the death of farmer Baek Nam-ki and the request for an autopsy warrant continued, and opposition parties criticized it through regular parliamentary audits. From mid-October, although 'Park Geun- hye‚ÄìChoi Soon-sil gate' emerged as a key topic as the media such as JTBC, TV Chosun, The Hankyoreh reported the suspicions of corruption in the foundation, Chung Yoo-ra's admission scandal, and the blacklist of cultural and artistic circles in earnest, Park Geun-hye's government flatly denied the basic facts about Park Geun-hye‚ÄìChoi Soon-sil gate, including suspicions of establishing a foundation or revising speeches. However, on October 24, 2016, JTBC Newsroom reported that it had obtained a tablet PC containing circumstantial evidence that Choi Soon-sil had received 44 presidential speeches equivalent to state secrets in advance. JTBC's first report, despite only a small fraction of what was on the tablet PC, was \\"sound enough\\" to shock Korean society as it turned out to be true that Choi Soon-sil, a civilian, shared presidential documents. Eventually, at 4 p.m. on Oct. 25, president Park Geun-hye admitted during a public apology at the Cheongwadae's Chunchugwan that \\"Choi Soon-sil helped in times of trouble in the past\\" and that \\"some speeches and others were helped by Choi Soon-sil.\\" However, the president's attitude to explain the situation so far only as \\"personal connection\\" did not appear to recognize her heavy responsibility as the head of state affairs, rather fueling suspicions about Park Geun-hye‚ÄìChoi Soon-sil gate. At around 4:35 p.m., right after the public apology, keywords such as \\"impeachment,\\" \\"Park Geun-hye impeachment\\" or \\"resignation\\" were among the top search words on Naver and Daum. Public opinion also deteriorated sharply, and the Realmeter's survey showing president Park Geun-hye's approval rating plunging from 22.7 percent on the 25th to 17.5 percent on the 26th. == Development == === Preparation === The Minjungchonggwolgi(a general rally of the public) struggle headquarters, which will host the first candlelight vigil, was preparing for the sixth protest on Nov. 12, and the official Facebook account of the struggle headquarters had not planned a separate large-scale rally other than the public rally until 26 days ago. However, as the Park Geun-hye‚ÄìChoi Soon-sil gate intensified, it was announced that the \\"Citizens' Candlelight Contest\\" will be held at Cheonggye Plaza at 7 p.m. on October 29 for the first time following the announcement of a small rally on May 26. It is interpreted that the struggle headquarters did not systematically host the rally with plans from the beginning, but that the Minjungchonggwolgi struggle headquarters came to \\"take on\\" the hosting of the 1st to 3rd candlelight vigils while already preparing for Minjungchonggwolgi. The official name of the rally was 'Î™®Ïù¥Ïûê! Î∂ÑÎÖ∏ÌïòÏûê! ÎÇ¥Î†§ÏôÄÎùº Î∞ïÍ∑ºÌòú(Get together! Get angry! Resign Park Geun-hye).' The slogan was used until the third candlelight vigil on November 12. === Progression ===  Protest in the provinces before and after the rally  October 29 4:00 p.m., Jeonju in Jeonbuk, bus drivers belonging to the Jeonbuk Bus Worker's Union held a honking protest while driving to show that they agreed to the resignation of Park Geun-hye. A total of 300 buses from Jeonju participated in the protest for about three minutes, and they attached pickets related to the demonstration to guide Jeonju citizens. The honking protest was also a symbol of the pro-democracy movement during the 1987 June Struggle. In the Yeongnam region, the \\"Ulsan Organizing Committee of Minjungchonggwolgi\\", which was formed by the Ulsan headquarters of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and affiliated labor unions, began a general rally for Ulsan citizens at the plaza of Taehwagang Station in Nam-gu, Ulsan. An estimated 1,000 people (approximately 800 police officers) participated in the rally. The participants held a rally in the square for about an hour. After leaving Taehwagang Station, they marched through the Ulsan branch of Hyundai Department Store.  Small protest in Seoul before the rally  In Seoul, some 20 members of a youth organization \\"21st Century Youth Community Hope\\" held a \\"Youth Declaration 1st Action\\" at the BukInsa Madang in Anguk-dong, Jongno-gu at 2 p.m., issuing a declaration signed by 149 high school students and performing a performance to recreate the president Park Geun-hye's public apology. The university's declaration of the situation, which had continued until the previous day, continued on the day of the rally. Later in the day, the student council of 10 general graduate schools of Korea University, Dongkuk University, Sogang University, Seoul National University, Yonsei University, Ewha Womans University, Chung-Ang University, KAIST, Hanyang University, and Hongik University held a press conference at Hanyang University to called for the resignation of Park Guen-hye government and strict investigation of the Choi Soon-sil scandal.  Candlelight vigil  At 6 p.m., a candlelight vigil hosted by the struggle headquarters began at Cheonggye Plaza in Jongno-gu, with thousands of citizens gathering. The rally involved people who came alone, family members, lovers and friends, and even senior citizens who supported the president. The candlelight vigils were largely composed of condemnation from all walks of life. In opening address, Jeong hyeon-chan, the president of the Catholic Farmers Association, said \\"Whenever the country was in trouble, we defeated the dictator not by politicians, but by the power of all the people gathered here. President Park Guen-hye should no longer drive the people into a crucible of pain and step down immediately.\\" Then a college student who was taken into custody after shouting for resignation in front of the National Assembly building appeared on the podium and said, \\"Despite a series of declarations of state of affairs, the president does not seem to know what went wrong. We must impeach the president.\\"  Protest March  Initially, the struggle headquarters said in a pre-announcement that after the pre-candlelight rally, they will march through Gwanggyo from Cheonggye Plaza to Jonggak-Jongno 2-ga, Insadong-BukInsa Madang, and that the march was also pre-reported like the rally. In response, the police also sent 4,800 police troops from 60 companies to prepare for any eventualities. At 7:10 p.m., when the candlelight vigil was over, organizers and citizens began to march on the streets. An estimated 4,000 citizens shouted slogans calling for the president to step down as they marched out of Cheonggye Plaza to Jongno 2-ga. In the process, the police controlled two lanes of the road. When they entered Jonggak, the leading participants broke away from the route scheduled for a right turn in front of the Jonggak head office of Young Poong Books and began to go straight toward Jogyesa. The police stopped the demonstrators from marching in the area of Gongpyeong-dong towards Jonggak Station, and the confrontation between citizens and the police began. In response, some citizens tried to turn left and move toward Gwanghwamun, shouting \\"Let's go to Blue House,\\" and in the process, when the first police line was breached, citizens went out to the Jongno lane. With the police in a hurry to control traffic, protesters broke through the second cordon installed in front of the Kyobo Book Centre and entered Gwanghwamun Plaza around 7:55 p.m.. As police quickly re-installed the third cordon near King Sejong's statue, citizens continued their final confrontation here. Police have also set up bus barricade on both sides of the three-way intersection in front of Gwanghwamun in preparation for the citizens heading individually to Blue House. == Reaction and aftermath == === Reactions from all walks of life === On Oct. 30, the day after the rally, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency issued a press release, saying, \\"The number of participants, including ordinary citizens, increased as they moved out of the notified course and to Gwanghwamun Square during the march, and there were physical fights between some protesters and police in the process of blocking it, but the police responded patiently to the end for the safety of the citizens.\\" And referring to the broadcast by Hong Wan-sun, a police chief of Jongno-gu, they said, \\"We thank the citizens for following the police's instructions and cooperating rationally.\\" Meanwhile, Blue House seemed to be paying keen attention to public opinion as it postponed a luncheon for civilian members of the Unification Preparation Committee, which was scheduled to be held by President Park on the eve of the rally. And on the day of the rally, it seemed to keep a close eye on the rally in suspense as the prosecution's seize and search attempt was underway. The next day, Blue House announced its personnel reform plan and accepted the resignations of the Park Guen-hye government's key figures, Woo Byung-woo and Ahn Jong-beom, and secretaries Jeong Ho-seong, Ahn Bong-geun and Lee Jae-man of the so-called \\"doorknob trio.\\" Analysts said that the reason of putting reorganization of Blue House forward, which was originally expected to be early and late this week, was to come up with quick measures to deal with the political situation, in which public sentiment is rapidly deteriorating to the point where it called for \\"resignation\\" and \\"impeachment\\". === Analysis === The press focused on the fact that the rally was not led by certain force, but was voluntarily participated by ordinary citizens, and that it proceeded peacefully unlike previous protests where steel pipes and water cannons appeared. The Kyunghyang Shinmun used the rally participant's expression, \\"I'm so stressed and angry that my heart is about to burst,\\" as the title of the article, and JTBC also reported the responses of the protesters, \\"I came out because I couldn't believe it when I saw the news report.\\" The Hankook Ilbo described the protest as a \\"voluntary citizens' rally across all generations,\\" noting that conservatives in their 50s and 60s, who have been allies of the president Park, voluntarily participated in the protest, while the Dong-A Ilbo also noted that conservative citizens who had no experience in past rallies and demonstrations \\"participated for the first time in their lives\\". === Media editorials and foreign media coverage === On Monday, October 31, newspapers denounced the president's decision, citing weekend rallies in editorials. The JoongAng Ilbo evaluated the rally as \\"a rally that was rather scary because it was rational,\\" and saw that the rally \\"was not violent, but the form and content of the protest alone conveyed enough anger and despondency of ordinary citizens.\\" Foreign media outlets covering the Choi Soon-sil scandal also paid attention to the first candlelight vigil calling for the president to step down. The AP said, \\"Citizens holding candles participated in the rally with hand signs reading 'Who is the real president' and 'step down Park Guen-hye.' It is the largest anti-government rally in Seoul in recent months. The president Park's lame duck can accelerate.\\" == References == Category:2016 in South Korea Category:2016 protests Category:2016 South Korean political scandal Category:Park Geun-hye Government Category:Protests in South Korea ","title":"Get together!

Founded in 1929, the SBA is an affiliate of the Singapore National Olympic Council. It is also a member of the Badminton World Federation (BWF) and Badminton Asia (formerly known as the Badminton Asian Confederation). Currently, SBA has a total of 29 member clubs. ==History== ===Formation=== After its introduction by the British and the Amateur Sporting Association in the 1920s, badminton gained widespread popularity throughout Malaya and Singapore.Tan, T. C., et al. (2002). Upholding the legacy Singapore badminton. Singapore: Asiapac, p. 7 It was against this backdrop that the SBA was established several years later in 1929, with Tan Boo Teck as its first president. Upon its formation, the SBA allowed badminton parties, which were essentially teams consisting of badminton enthusiasts, to affiliate themselves with them and take part in their annual open championships. Following the Japanese Occupation, the SBA had to deal with the loss of some of its best players to the war, the lack of proper facilities and the rising cost of maintaining the club. Nevertheless, Malaya, which Singapore was then a part of, prepared to send its first team to the 1949 Thomas Cup. The team eventually emerged victorious, beating Denmark 8‚Äì1 in the finals held in England. Singapore Badminton Hall The lack of proper facilities meant that the SBA's players started practicing in open-air courts. SBA meetings were also mainly held at the Clerical Union Hall. The Thomas Cup win, however, kicked off a fundraiser to build a badminton hall. Despite the donations, the SBA struggled with the cost of the construction and had to relinquish ownership of the badminton hall to the Singapore Sports Council (now known as Sport Singapore). Eventually, the Singapore Badminton Hall, which also doubled as the SBA's headquarters, was opened in 1952. In January 2008, the SBA's lease at the Singapore Badminton Hall expired. The SBA then relocated to the Singapore Sports School.Wang, J. (2007, September 25). SBA to get new home at Sports School. The Straits Times, p. 36. Retrieved from NewspaperSG. The SBA is currently located at the Singapore Sports Hub, after the latter's construction was completion in 2014. ===SBA Badminton Academy=== In 2017, the SBA launched the Singapore Badminton Academy in partnership with ActiveSG. The academy, headed by former Olympian Jiang Yanmei, offers a series of badminton programmes across Singapore for aspiring shuttlers aged six to 17. Many former national shuttlers are part of the academy's coaching team. ==Tournaments== The SBA is involved in a number of tournaments throughout the year. ===Singapore Open=== The Singapore Open (previously known as the Konica Cup) is a BWF-sanctioned tournament organised by the SBA. It has been categorised as a BWF World Tour Super 500 event since the BWF announced its new events structure in 2018. The tournament, which offered a total prize money of USD 355,000 in its 2019 edition, attracts some of the world's best shuttlers. ===SBA Sanctioned Tournaments=== The following tournaments, all of which are tier 2 events, are currently sanctioned by the SBA: * PAPA GO Age Group 2020 * Alpha Age Group Series 2020 * 15th Chinese Swimming Club Age Group Badminton (Invitational) Tournament 2020 * Alpha Age Group Series 2020 ==Notable Shuttlers== Many shuttlers have represented Singapore on the world stage, both prior and after the nation gained independence. ===Pre-independence=== * Alice Pennefather * Ismail Marjan * Ong Poh Lim * Tan Chong Tee * Wong Peng Soon ===Post-independence=== * Wong Shoon Keat ===Olympians=== Female Olympians * Gu Juan * Jiang Yanmei * Li Li * Li Yujia * Liang Xiaoyu * Shinta Mulia Sari * Yao Lei * Xing Aiying * Zarinah Abdullah Male Olympians * Derek Wong * Hendri Saputra * Ronald Susilo ==See also== * Singapore national badminton team * Singapore Open ==References== Category:National members of the Badminton World Federation Category:Sport in Singapore ","title":"Singapore Badminton Association"},{"id":"63776685","text":"Ganzhenlin () is a light rail station of the Green Mountain line of the Danhai Light Rail, which is operated by New Taipei Metro.

(DES ; Desiderius Erasmus Foundation) is a German political party foundation. It is politically associated with but independent of the right-wing party Alternative for Germany (AfD). The foundation's headquarters are located in Berlin. Its current chairwoman is the former Christian-democratic Member of Parliament, Erika Steinbach. == Establishment and mission == The DES was registered in November 2017 in L√ºbeck. It was converted into a federal foundation from a foundation in the regional state of Schleswig-Holstein that had been established two years earlier. It is named after the great European Renaissance humanistic Christian thinker and writer Erasmus of Rotterdam. This provoked ironic comments as the AfD has been extremely critical of the European Union and the Euro currency since its foundation in 2013 by the economist Bernd Lucke. \\"The name stands for a pro-European but Eurosceptic position of the party\\", a party spokesperson explained in 2015. The first chairman of the DES was Konrad Adam, a well-known former journalist. In 2018, there was an intense competition and power struggle among several foundations to become the officially recognized foundation of the AfD. Party chairman Alexander Gauland preferred to have a foundation named after Gustav Stresemann, a national liberal politician who served as Foreign Minister and briefly Chancellor. Other party grandees like Alice Weidel, the party whip in the Bundestag, supported DES. In April 2018, the national board of the party decided to accept the association of the Erasmus Foundation. The party convention in June 2018 held a vote and a two thirds majority agreed to adopt the DES as officially associated foundation. The DES describes their mission as providing civic-democratic political educational programs and the promotion of science and scholarly education. In accordance with AfD political orientation, the DES has a right-wing orientation. It has held several conferences and political seminars. In June 2019 they held a large public conference in Berlin on the \\"growing threats to freedom of speech\\". Among the speakers where the party chairman J√∂rg Meuthen, Member of the European Parliament, the media scientist Norbert Bolz and the former GDR dissident and later CDU MP Vera Lengsfeld. The speeches are documented in the first issue of the foundations journal Faktum. == Leadership and board == Since March 2018, former MP Erika Steinbach is president of the DES. She had left Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party (CDU) in 2017 in protest over the chancellor's open door migration policy. The foundation has a board of advisors (Kuratorium) chaired by Max Otte, a professor of economics and investment fund manager who is still a member of the CDU. On the board, there are four MPs of AfD and several academics with different backgrounds, such as economists (like Otte or Joachim Starbatty) and legal scholars (like Karl Albrecht Schachtschneider and Alfred-Maurice de Zayas, a US citizen), historians (Karlheinz Wei√ümann and Lothar H√∂belt and others), theologians (like the Dominican father and professor of Christian social ethics Wolfgang Ockenfels) and also several natural scientists, but also some artists and writers or the German-Lebanese film maker Imad Karim who is known for his views critical of Islam. Furthermore, there is also one former member of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Wolfgang Fuhl, sitting on the advisory board. A couple of board members where formerly affiliated with the CDU, one is a former SPD MP Angelika Barbe, others had connections with small right wing parties. == Financing == DES finances their operations with private donations and membership fees. In their party program, the AfD criticizes that the other parties represented in the Bundestag have given their affiliated foundations now more than 600 million Euro funding from the federal budget per year. This, they claim, is a breach of the Federal Constitutional Courts cap's on state financing for parties.Grundsatzprogramm der AfD, pp. 21‚Äì22. The newcomer party wants to limit state financing of parties and their foundations. Party chairman Alexander Gauland claimed it was his \\"political end goal\\" to abolish the system of state financed political foundations. So far, the DES has not received public funds, since it is sitting in the German parliament, the Bundestag, only since 2017, one term. It is expected that the DES will get a share of the other party's foundations public financing if the AfD gets elected into the Bundestag a second time. In 2017 the German weekly newspaper ‚Äô‚ÄôDie Zeit‚Äô‚Äô estimated that the foundation could ultimately get as much as 80 million Euro from the public funds. Funding is likely to be substantially lower. After a first funding request of 1,4 million Euro was rejected by the Ministry of the Interior, the foundation has started legal action. == References == Category:Alternative for Germany Category:Political organisations based in Germany Category:Foundations based in Germany ","title":"Desiderius-Erasmus-Stiftung"},{"id":"63776725","text":"Alfred Buxton may refer to: * Alfred Fowell Buxton (1854‚Äì1952), British banker and local politician * Alfred William Buxton (1872‚Äì1950), New Zealand landscape gardener and nurseryman ","title":"Alfred Buxton"},{"id":"63776728","text":"Maraner Pare was a crime thriller Bengali drama film directed by Satish Dasgupta.

It was established in 2011, and has drawn attention from the Indian media for being among the first organised projects to venture into retirement or assisted living, a space that has often been stigmatised by conservative sections of the Indian society. ==History== Antara Senior Living was conceptualised in 2010 by Tara Singh Vachani, daughter of Max Group founder Analjit Singh, after noting the lack of quality, organised assisted living projects in India. Vachani decided to leverage the parent group's businesses to set up a retirement community model that could offer hospitality, healthcare, wellness and real estate. The first community opened in April 2017 in Dehradun, Uttarakhand. Antara was the subject of a 2018 case study taught at the Indian School of Business, which explored how it deals with cultural stigma associated with Indian retirement communities and considers the possibilities of changing mindsets in society at large. In 2019, Rajit Mehta, former CEO of Max Healthcare, was appointed the managing director and CEO of Antara. ==Properties and services== As of 2020, Antara runs 2 communities in the country: in Dehradun and Noida, Uttar Pradesh. The Dehradun property was designed by the New York-based architecture firm, Perkins Eastman, and constructed by the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, headquartered in Mumbai. Antara operates campus-style communities that offer independent living, personalised assisted living, and nursing and home health services in partnership with its parent company's business, Max Healthcare. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Organizations established in 2011 Category:Companies based in Delhi Category:Retirement communities Category:Housing for the elderly Category:Elderly care Category:Old age in India Category:Max Group ","title":"Antara Senior Living"},{"id":"63776896","text":"338x338pxIn 1917, the British empire launched a successful punitive expedition against the Mahsud. == Background == Following a punitive expedition in 1900-02, the Mahsud had signed a peace agreement with the British authorities, bringing conflict to an end for the time being. However, in November 1913, the Mahsud mulla died, and his son, Fazl-Din, disregarded the peace agreement and renewed raids, with encouragement from pro-Turkish and anti-British elements in the Afghan government. Hostilities between the British and the Mahsud began with the \\"Tank outrage\\" of April 1914. In this incident, the Mahsud killed Major Dodd, the Political Agent for South Waziristan, in addition to 2 officers and 3 sepoys. Pro-Turkish and Anti-British elements in Kabul would encourage hostilities. From April 1914 to March 1915, the Mahsuds committed 81 raids classed as serious, which do not include numerous cases of cattle lifting, burglary, wire cutting and small offences. In 1916, Viceroy Frederic Thesiger was informed that: In March 1917, the Mahsud began raiding into the British Raj. Mahsud attacks throughout the first half of 1917 on pickets, garrisons and convoys belonging to the British prompted a punitive expedition in June. Having been incurred heavy losses in that year by the Mahsud, the British intended to restore their prestige. == Conflict == British forces commanded by Major-General Benyon advanced into Mahsud tribal territory on the 6th. British forces engaged the Mahsud on the 7th, 12th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 23rd, and 24 June. On the 25th, hostilities ceased as the Mahsud began asking for peace. Part of the terms were that the Mahsuds had to hand rifles they had stolen - some of these came into the hands of British troops while they were still there. British troops began withdrawing on 12 July. The final peace agreement came on 10 August 1917 with a Mahsud jirga. Many details of the conflict are provided in a private letter dating 20 August 1917 by Harry Edward Parker (5 Oct 1895 ‚Äì 25 Dec 1969). Parker fought as a British soldier in this campaign. == Aftermath == The news of the peace agreement came as a great relief to the India Office. \\"The North-west frontier of India is now hopefully free of trouble.\\" == References == Category:1917 in Asia Category:Conflicts in 1917 Category:Wars involving British India Category:Wars involving the United Kingdom Category:20th-century military history of the United Kingdom ","title":"Operations against the Mahsuds (1917)"},{"id":"63776917","text":"View towards Margidunum Margidunum was a Roman settlement on the Fosse Way at Castle Hill near present-day Bingham, in Nottinghamshire, England. The site is a protected Scheduled Monument. == Description == Margidunum in Latin means 'marly fort' (marl is a lime-rich clay soil). However, archaeologist Felix Oswald expected that the Romans would have adopted an existing place name and he determined its Celtic meaning to be \\"the fort of the king's plain\\", the raised ground being a suitable position for the hill-fort of the king of the Coritani tribe. The Antonine Itinerary, a 2nd-century Roman register of places and roads, (Iter Britanniarum VI and VIII) locates Margidunum as MARGIDVNO midway between Ratae (Leicester) and Lindum (Lincoln) on the Fosse Way. Finds of military equipment established that it was initially a military post in about 55‚Äì60 AD, although no parts of a fort structure have been found. Forts were sited at close intervals along the Fosse Way to protect the Roman territory from the hostile Brigantes and Iceni tribes. A civilian settlement then developed in about 70‚Äì80 AD on either side of the Fosse Way, indicated by several simple rectangular buildings along about a 1 km stretch of the road. Two Roman villas have been found within 3 km of the settlement, as well as Roman farms in the surrounding area. A rhomboid-shaped earthwork defence was built in the late 2nd century around the camp, enclosing about 7 or 8 acres. A stone wall nearly 3m wide was later built in front of the earth rampart, with two ditches beyond it. The fort was protected to the south and east by marshland. The site remained occupied until about 500 AD. == Investigations == In 1722 William Stukeley visited the site and documented, in his 1724 book Itinerarium Curiosum, his observations of Roman foundations of walls, floors of houses and regularly-spaced oak posts. In 1896 'Castle Hill Close' field on the 'Foss Road' was reported as the supposed site of the important Roman station of Margidunum, with Roman pottery and coins found there. Excavations were conducted by Nottingham University in the 1920s by Felix Oswald, and again in the 1960s by Malcolm Todd. Oswald found prehistoric artefacts including a Bronze Age flint arrowhead, polished stone axes and bronze socketed celts. The 20th-century excavations discovered the stone walls and stone slab floors or beaten clay floors of over 20 Roman buildings at the site. Foundations of three large adjacent buildings show that they were the most elaborate at the site. Numerous fragments of window glass, roof tiles and evidence of underfloor heating (floors raised on pillars and box flue tiles) indicate that one of these buildings was a bathhouse. It would have had stone walls, whereas the other buildings were timber-framed with wattle and daub walls. The largest building had no internal divisions, so it was likely to be a public building. Fragments of decorated wall plaster, mosaic floor tiles, pottery, a grid iron, charred timbers, several wells, water tanks and coins were also discovered. The oldest Claudian well was lined with oak planks encased in clay, whereas the later wells were stone-lined. The wells drew water from the underground source of the nearby Newton Springs. Oswald identified the route of two other roads crossing the camp. He deduced that one of these was probably used to transport lead from the Lutudarum lead-mines in Derbyshire, because a large lead ingot inscribed C.IVL.PROTI.BRIT.LVT.EX.ARG. was found in 1848 at Hexgrave Park near Mansfield. The site of Margidunum now lies mostly across three fields but it is partially covered by a roundabout built in 2010 between the A6027/A46 and B692 Fosse Way. == Nearby sites == The Roman fort of Ad Pontem (at East Stoke near Newark) was 10 miles further north along the Fosse Way. It was also a small 1st-century fort with a similar rhomboid-shaped earthwork enclosure. A settlement developed on the site and Roman occupation continued into the 4th century. Two Iron Age huts were also found there. Roman camps have also been discovered at nearby Calverton and Farnsfield, and they too are Scheduled Monuments. == References == Category:Roman towns and cities in England Category:Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Nottinghamshire Category:Archaeological sites in Nottinghamshire ","title":"Margidunum"},{"id":"63776918","text":"Wakanim SAS is a French entertainment company which runs the video-on-demand streaming service of the same name that specialises in the online streaming and simulcasting of Japanese anime series.

Native to China, it is commonly grown in gardens as an ornamental shrub. It has escaped from cultivation and is naturalized in the Americas. ==Description== Clerodendrum bungei is a deciduous shrub that grows up to 2 m in height. Its leaves are cordate (heart- shaped), 10‚Äì20 cm long and not quite as wide, and have coarsely toothed edges. The flowers, which appear in late summer, are coloured rose, crimson, or pink, and arranged in a conspicuous rounded terminal inflorescence known as corymb, which is up to 10 cm in diameter. As in other Clerodendrum species, the calyx is five-lobed. At the centre of each flower there is a slender tube 3‚Äì4 cm long which terminates in five spreading white lobes. While the flowers are flagrant, crushed leaves have an unpleasant odour. ==Taxonomy== Clerodendrum bungei was discovered in 1831 by Russian botanist Alexander von Bunge in Beijing during his long scientific expedition in East Asia. Two years later, he described it as C. foetidum on the account of the pungent smell of its leaves. Since that name had already been occupied by another species, German botanist Ernst Gottlieb von Steudel renamed it C. bungei in 1840. The genus name is composed of Greek words meaning \\"chance\\" and \\"tree\\" while the specific epithet honours Alexander von Bunge. ==Distribution and habitat== Clerodendrum bungei is native to Taiwan, Vietnam, and all the mainland provinces and autonomous regions of China except Jilin and Liaoning. It grows along roadsides and in mixed forests on mountain slopes below 2500 m. ==Cultivation== Clerodendrum bungei was first introduced into Europe 1850 by Scottish plant collector Robert Fortune. At Kew Gardens in England it was treated as a greenhouse plant until another nursery proved its winter hardiness. As in nature, cultivated plants grow to the height of 2 m. In the British Isles it is frequently killed to the ground by frost only to send up \\"vigorous, erect, woody shoots\\" next summer. In colder areas, such as the U.S. state of Missouri, it is grown in containers and overwintered in sunny rooms or conservatories. Its flowers attract butterflies. Clerodendrum bungei is noted for its suckering habit and rapid growth which allow it to form spreading colonies. It is valued for its flowers but its aggressive spread makes it suited best for somewhat isolated areas. C. bungei has escaped from gardens in North America and naturalized from Texas to Georgia and Florida. ==References== bungei Category:Garden plants of Asia Category:Flora of China Category:Flora of Taiwan Category:Flora of Vietnam Category:Plants described in 1831 ","title":"Clerodendrum bungei"},{"id":"63776947","text":"Jakub Weso≈Çowski, also known as Kuba Weso≈Çowski, (born 7 May 1985, Warsaw) is a Polish film, television and theatre actor as well as journalist. ==Life and career== He was born on 7 May 1985 in Warsaw.

In 1827 Hartung was posted as ensign in the No. 1 Infantry Regiment. He was promoted to lieutenant on March 15, 1831, lieutenant on August 16, 1834 and captain on March 1, 1844. During the First Italian War of Independence he fought at Santa Lucia, and was promoted to major in Regiment No. 17 and decorated with the Military Cross of Merit with the war decoration. Thereafter, Hartung fought in the first corps at the Battle of Custozza and during the Five Days of Milan. He took part in the submission of Bologna and of Ancona. In all of these events, he excelled so much that he was awarded the Order of the Iron Crown (3rd class) and promoted to lieutenant colonel. In 1850 he served as adjudant to then Adjutant General to Fielmarshal Radetzky, after which he was named Colonel and Commander of Infantry Regiment No. 23. On September 25, 1854, Hartung was promoted major general and appointed command of a brigade in the 2nd Army Corps. In 1859 he and his brigade took part in the war against France and Piedmont. As part of the 3rd Army Corps they fought at Magenta and Solferino. On August 15, 1862 he was appointed commander of the coastal region and in Istria. On 13 August 1863 he was promoted to Feldmarshall-Leutnant and a year later he became Inhaber of Infantry Regiment No. 47. During the Austro- Prussian War Hartung served in the South Army under Archduke Albert against Italy. Hartung commanded the IX Corps and contributed significantly to the Austrian victory at Custozza on 24 June 1866. Hartung had the right wing of his corps act against the enemy immediately after the Italian occupation of Sommacampagna and Berettara and his repeated attacks against the enemy troops deployed on Monte Croce prevented the whole army from being seriously endangered. The enemy was unable to penetrate the heights of Casa del Sole. After the bloody attacks by his brigades Weckbecker and B√∂ck and the stubborn resistance on the part of the Thun Regiment on the Monte Belvedere and the Monte Arabico, which made the attack of the VII Corps much easier.

Austria's war with Prussia and Italy in 1866 (New York 2007), p.82-123 On October 4, 1866 Hartung was appointed interim commanding general for Upper and Lower Austria, Salzburg, Moravia and Silesia, and on 20 March 1868 as commanding general in Vienna. After he had advanced to become a Felzeugmeister on 22 April 1868, he was awarded the Order of the Iron Crown 1st Class on 19 February 1869 and retired on 1 March 1869 at his own request. Hartung was also a military theorist and had directed the revision of the service regulations and participated in the revision of the exercise regulations that had been started after the war in 1859. His work in this area continued in the following decades of the reorganization of the imperial-royal army. After his retirement, he was appointed a lifelong member of the House of Lords and was repeatedly sent to the delegations of the Austrian Reichsrat. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Geoffrey Wawro, The Austro-Prussian War.

They are committed to protecting the Pacific islands and their culture, land and marine habitats from climate change. They oppose the fossil fuel industry. Their core message is: \\"We are not drowning. We are fighting.\\"https://350pacific.org/pacific- climate-warriors/. They take part in the United Nations climate negotiations. Through educational projects in 15 countries in the region, the Pacific Climate Warriors try to explain to young people the consequences of climate change and the impact on the islands. In doing so, they want to motivate more people to work for the protection of the islands. == Canoe blockade 2014 == One of their more notable actions was a campaign in Australia from 8 to 25 October 2014, the key element was a civil disobedience action on 17 October 2014 in Newcastle, where the world's largest coal port is located. There, the group paddled out in traditional canoes and kayaks with the help of hundreds of Australian locals to prevent coal ships from entering and leaving the port. According to the group, only four of the twelve ships that were due to pass through the port on that day were able to do so, while the others were all successfully blocked by the group. The canoes used during the blockade were built in the Pacific islands using traditional methods and were brought to Australia by cargo ship specifically for the operation. In the campaign, they demanded that companies that work with fossil fuels and countries with high greenhouse gas emissions take responsibility for their climate-damaging actions. By reporting on the effects of climate change on the Pacific islands in media reports, they wanted to raise awareness of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. During the campaign, 30 members of the group from 12 different Pacific countries (including Fiji, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu) travelled to Australia. == References == Category:International climate change organizations Category:Pacific Ocean ","title":"Pacific Climate Warriors"},{"id":"63777035","text":"Ernst B√ºcken (2 June 1884 ‚Äì 28 July 1949) was a German musicologist and University teacher. == Life == Born in Aachen, B√ºcken, son of a director of a textile factory,Fred K.

She is a principal dancer at the Royal Danish Ballet. ==Early life== Dorger's first dance training was Scottish highland dance. She was the U.S. Champion at age 10. Soon, she shifted her focus on ballet. In 2004, at age 14, Dorger started training at the School of American Ballet on full scholarship. She was trained by former New York City Ballet principal dancer Nikolaj Hubbe. ==Career== In 2008, at age 18, Dorger joined the Royal Danish Ballet in Copenhagen as a member of the corps de ballet, at the invitation of Hubbe, now the artistic director of the company. Dorger, who was trained with the Balanchine technique, had to adjust to the company's Bournonville method when she first joined, though she did have opportunities to dance Balanchine's works. While she was in the corp, she danced soloist roles such as Princess Florine in The Sleeping Beauty, Gamzatti in La Bayadere and Dew Drop in The Nutcracker. In 2013, Dorger was named soloist. In 2016, she was promoted to the rank of principal dancer after dancing Balanchine's Theme and Variations. She has danced principal roles such as Odette/Odile in Swan Lake, the title role in Giselle and Teresina in Napoli, Balanchine repertoire such as Ballo della Regina and contemporary works such as Alice in Alice‚Äôs Adventures in Wonderland.

It displays a revolving exhibit of four Nebuta floats from the most recent Aomori Nebuta Matsuri summer festival, alongside media related to the festival. The museum opened in January 2011. ==History== The concept for Nebuta Museum Wa Rasse was part of the \\"Basic Plan for the Rejuvenation of the Aomori Station area\\" in 2004. The plan was devised to keep tourism and businesses present in central Aomori after the 2010 opening of the T≈çhoku Shinkansen and Shin-Aomori Station that would supplant the T≈çhoku Main Line and Aomori Station, leading to a potential shift in commuter traffic away from the city's central district. The plan called for a public cultural facility near Aomori Station that focused on the Aomori Nebuta Matsuri summer festival that takes place annually on the waterfront of Aomori Bay. The name was decided on in 2009. The building's exterior of red, ribbon-like, vertical steel beams was designed to evoke the visual sensation of light passing through Aomori's old-growth beech forests, as found in Shirakami-Sanchi, while controlling the amount of natural lighting that penetrated to the museum's interior. The museum was opened to the public on 5 January 2011. Another privately owned Aomori Nebuta museum in the foothills of the Hakk≈çda Mountains near National Route 103, called Nebuta no Sato, closed two years after the opening of Nebuta Museum Wa Rasse due to competition from the latter's more central location. ==Exhibits== A Nebuta float during one of the museum's \\"Haneto\\" experiences The museum contains two floors of displays. Visitors start the tour of the museum on the second floor. The first exhibition area contains photographs and videos of the history of the Aomori Nebuta Matsuri festival. Guests can also participate in interactive activities in this first exhibition area. The second floor leads to a balcony that overlooks the museum's main exhibition area where large Nebuta floats are kept. Each year, four new Nebuta floats are selected for display in this exhibition area. Older floats are rotated out of the exhibit after the new ones are installed. The exhibition room is darkened so the floats can be lit to mimic their appearance during the festival. The museum also provides a 30-minute-long \\"Haneto\\" experience three times daily, where guests can experience various aspects of the Aomori Nebuta Matsuri festival in the large exhibition area among the four Nebuta floats. The experience emulates the festival which was designated an Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property in 1980, and as one of the 100 Soundscapes of Japan by the Ministry of the Environment in 1996. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Art museums and galleries in Aomori Prefecture Category:Museums in Aomori Prefecture Category:Aomori (city) Category:Art museums established in 2011 Category:2011 establishments in Japan ","title":"Nebuta Museum Wa Rasse"},{"id":"63777095","text":"Map of Massachusetts House of Representatives' 1st Middlesex district, 2013.

The film was labeled ‚ÄòSwitzerland‚Äôs first disaster movie' as depicting a major water dam-break with the subsequent flooding of the metropole of Zurich. == Background == The 1937 installed dam created Switzerland largest artificial lake, the Sihlsee. A failure of the dam could lead, according to studies, to an 8-metre (26 ft) high flood wave through the lower Sihl Valley reaching the Altstadt of the city of Z√ºrich, the biggest city in Switzerland, within 2 hours. This threat has led the City of Z√ºrich to develop, publish and test evacuation plans for the affected areas of the city, and especially the area around Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof railway station. == Production == 15-year high school-student Roger Steinmann was inspired by Z√ºrich's frequent test-alarms in case of a dam-break. With already several years of filming experience in 1977, he realized the 'would-be'-situation of a catastrophe due to an earthquake. Some music was borrowed from Doctor Zhiwago, and some sound from Earthquake. Steinmann casted one lead-role with his class-mate, the future mathematic-professor Peter B√ºrgisser. == Accolades == At the second Swiss Youth Filmfestival (Schweizerischen Jugendfilmtagen) 1977, the film won the first prize. For its editing, it won the 'Silver Scissors' by the Union International of Film Amateurs in 1978.

No members of this gens are mentioned in ancient writers, but a number are known from inscriptions. ==Origin== The nomen Balonius belongs to a class of gentilicia formed using the suffix ', originally applied to cognomina ending in ', but later used as a regular gentile-forming suffix, without regard to the orthography of the root. These nomina tended to be of plebeian origin, and were frequently Oscan. Chase suggests that Balonius might be derived from the cognomen Bala, perhaps from Latin balare, \\"to bleat\\".Chase, pp. 118, 119. The spelling Bellonius, found in a few inscriptions, suggests a possible derivation from Bellona, the goddess of war, although the two forms could also have developed independently. ==Praenomina== The main praenomina of the Balonii were Aulus, Gaius, and Marcus, all of which were common throughout Roman history. Other names used by this gens included Gnaeus and Lucius, which were also common, and Numerius, which was relatively uncommon, and much more distinctive. ==Members== * Balonia, mistress of the slave Philemon, along with Balonius, probably her brother, according to an inscription from Casilinum in Campania, dating to 98 BC.. * Balonius, master of the slave Philemon, along with Balonia, probably his sister, according to an inscription from Casilinum, dating to 98 BC. * Aulus Balonius A. l.

It is the original portion of Covington, on the east of north-south U.S. 190; Business 190 also known as LA 21 runs through it, is E. Boston St.Google maps The unusual layout of the town dates from 1813, and is deemed a contributing site in the listing. It was laid out in square blocks, each with a small central square; the squares became known as \\"oxlots\\" due to tethering of oxen and other livestock in them. The listing included 170 contributing buildings and 77 intrusions (non-contributing), mostly one-story and spread relatively evenly throughout. Of the structures, six were from before 1880, 163 structures from 1881-1930, and 77 structures from 1931 on. It also included a contributing object. A local landmark in the district is the Southern Hotel, a two-story commercial brick building with shopfronts on the ground level, built in 1911. In 1982, it was undergoing restoration. It consisted of 305, 307, 313, 315, and 317 New Hampshire, and 426, 428, 430, 434 Boston. It has \\"two corner projecting pavilions, matching balconies on the wings, fixed awnings with overhead transoms, arched windows with arched lintels, and elaborate brackets.\\" \\"Collins employed an unusual urban planning scheme in laying out the district. Each block, measuring 360 f¬Æ6*1 square f was created with a small central square which connected to the street system by alleyways. These areas of 120 feet square were to be held in common.* They became known as oxlots, undoubtedly because farmers and merchants, would tether oxen and livestock within the sites. Today the oxlots constitute more than nine acres of open space within the urban area. The ox lots continue to play a major role in Covington's historical landscape as a unique urban design. The 20 blocks within the current district boundaries were all planned with ox lots. Of these, only 2 blocks contain large intrusions. The surviving 18 ox lots have varying degrees of encroachment, with nine largely unintruded upon (Photos 2, 3, & 4) , and one completely pristine. Therefore, this unusual resource remains over 60% intact. The mere survival of these urban spaces is remarkable, as they could have been easily eliminated or obliterated. Careful evaluation of the existing encroachments reveals that the ox lots are still essentially open, and have retained their confined, semi-naturalistic character. These spaces are a major component q^Covington's cultural and historical assets, which must be recognized in the unifying pattern of architecture and the landscape. \\" \\"extant buildings are post-1880 due to two major fires which destroyed much of the district. Subsequent redevelopment booms in the lumber and \\"ozone\\" resort industries precipitated architectural growth in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. A. Commercial Business District The existing structures in the District of St. John integrate residential and commercial usage. The major concentration of business activity developed in the vicinity of the Southern Hotel and the New Orleans-Great Northern Railroad, extending eastward.

This included the following areas: *Eastern Montana *North Dakota *Eastern South Dakota *Western Minnesota *Alberta *Saskatchewan *Manitoba Centered on the Keewatin Region, Canada, (ca 102 W, 63 N) the ice sheet covered up to 2.5 million square kilometres at the Last Glacial Maximum. At its greatest reach, (14*146=2044 N-S by 12*146=1752 E-W) The northern edge abutted the Greenland ice sheet in Baffin Bay. Running south, along the shore of Baffin Island the edges floated in the Davis Straits. Curling across the southern tip of Baffin Island, entering Hudson Bay, it merged with the Labradorean Ice Sheet, and formed the center of an ice sheet spanning North America from the North Atlantic to the North Pacific oceans. The seam between the two ice sheets passed over the northern tip of the Ugava Peninsula passing south across Hudson Bay and on to the Ontario shore near Fort Stevens. This seam continued southward across Lake Superior, east of the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan. It went southward into Wisconsin along the Lake Michigan shoreline and crossed into western Illinois. Reaching down the Mississippi River valley to its junction with the Missouri River, it reaches its most southern point. At this point, the ice sheet no longer abuts the Labradoran ice sheet. The leading edge of the ice sheet follows roughly the Missouri River Valley through Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and into the Dakotas, reach westward across the Montana, where after (10*146=1,460 mi) it reaches the Rocky Mountains just south of the U.S. and Canadian border and the Cordilleran ice sheet . The Cordilleran ice sheet forms the western boundary of the Keewatin ice sheet, where they abut along the front of the Canadian Rockies, ending in the Arctic Ocean near the mouth of the MacKenzie River. This northern ice front, floats just off the coast of the Queen Elizabeth Islands, where it completes its border in Baffin Bay and the seam with the Greenland ice sheet.John P.

After his training with the Daily Graphic he was employed by Ausco Press Limited to submit what he called \\"professional information leading to the establishment of Newspapers\\". In 1952 Heymann together with one Lawrence Fumadoh edited and published a newspaper that was registered at the Post Office called The People.

With her business partner Suzanne Goin she operates Lucques, A.O.C., Tavern, and The Larder. She won a James Beard Award for Outstanding Restaurateur in 2018. == Early life and education == Styne was raised in Los Angeles. She worked as a waitress while in college. She is a master sommelier. == Career == Styne started working in foodservice in 1989 at the age of 22 when she cofounded Basically Baked Inc., which distributed specialty food items to retail outlets. She developed a baked tortilla chip which was one of the first of its kind. She sold the company in 1992, after which she started a catering company, Food Concepts. From 1994 thru 1997 she worked as a manager at Jones Hollywood for Sean MacPherson, during which period the restaurant was 80% destroyed by a fire. The rebuilding process was \\"a crash course in building a restaurant\\" for Styne, who managed the process in six weeks. In 1997 she met Goin, who was then working at Campanile. According to Styne, LA's dining scene at the time was \\"either super casual or super fussy,\\" and both women envisioned something in between. Styne and Goin opened Lucques on Melrose Avenue in 1998. It offered one of LA's early market-driven menus. On 11 March 2020 they announced the restaurant would close on 6 May. Styne and Goin opened A.O.C. in 2002. Food & Wine called A.O.C. \\"a pioneering restaurant that was at the forefront of small-plates dining in LA\\" and said the restaurant \\"changed the way LA dined.\\" Johnathan Gold said of it, \\"If we've lived through a battle for L.A.'s restaurant soul, Goin and Styne have won.\\" She and Goin opened Tavern in 2009 and in 2014, The Larder. In 2015 they took over food service at the Hollywood Bowl. In 2019 Syne predicted Albari√±o could become \\"the new Chablis or the new Burgundy.\\" She was a guest judge on Top Chef: All-Stars L.A.

Similarly to mammalian olfactory receptors, in insects each olfactory sensory neuron expresses one type of OR, allowing the specific detection of a volatile chemical. Differently to mammalian ORs, insect ORs form a heteromer with a fixed monomer, Orco, and a variable OR monomer, which confers the odour specificity. Insect ORs are transmembrane proteins with seven transmembrane helices similarly to G protein coupled receptors, but they have the reverse topology with an intracellular N-terminal and an extracellular C-terminal instead. The number of ORs in different species of insects is extremely variable ranging from as few as 8 in the damselfly, to 60 in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, even to more than 500 in some ant species, reflecting the variability in odorant perception requirements associated to different lifestyles and social interactions. Insect ORs are investigated as targets for pest control given the possibility of altering the behaviour of insects by activating particular ORs with natural or optimized chemicals . == References == Category:Olfactory receptors Category:Sensory receptors Category:Olfactory system Category:Insect physiology ","title":"Insect olfactory receptor"},{"id":"63778529","text":"Jeremiah Lanphier c. 1860 Jeremiah Calvin Lanphier The name is often spelled \\"Lamphier\\", presumably because Samuel I. Prime, the first historian of the 1857‚Äì58 revival, spelled that way. (September 3, 1809 ‚Äì December 26, 1898) was an American lay missionary in New York City, popularly regarded as having been instrumental in instigating the American religious revival of 1857‚Äì58. ==Early life and conversion== Jeremiah Lanphier was born in Coxsackie, New York, the son of Samuel F. Lanphier, a farmer and currier, and Jane Ross Lanphier, whose parents had emigrated from Holland. At sixteen, Lanphier apprenticed as a tailor in Albany and later also studied music there under one George Andrews. In 1833, Lanphier and Andrews became partners as cloth merchants in Lower Manhattan. They entered a highly competitive market for ready-made clothing, and after extending credit in an attempt to attract customers, they went bankrupt in the spring of 1842. While Lanphier worked as a cloth merchant, he also joined the choir at Broadway Tabernacle (a church organized by Lewis Tappan for revivalist Charles Grandison Finney), where Lanphier became an evangelical Christian. He then joined the choir at Market Street Church, pastored by noted Presbyterian clergyman Theodore L. Cuyler, and later the choir at the Pearl Street Presbyterian Church, where he made many friends and took an active interest in the work of the church. ==Entering ministry == During the 1850s, prosperous churches with wealthy congregants moved uptown to more fashionable neighborhoods. Pearl Street Church closed in 1853, and Lanphier joined Duane Street Presbyterian Church, pastored by theologian and advocate of religious revival James Waddel Alexander. Duane Street Church had itself moved northward twice, although Lanphier continued to live in lower Manhattan where the number of unchurched residents increased. When a member of the consistory of the nearby North Dutch Church (with an entrance on Fulton Street) offered Lanphier a position as lay missionary, Lamphier closed his business and began his work for the church on July 1, 1857. Although Lanphier had no theological training, he was a remarkably good candidate for such a ministry. He never married, and he had no children. A contemporary described him as \\"tall, well made, with a remarkably pleasant, benevolent face; affectionate in his disposition and manner, possessed of indomitable energy and perseverance, having good musical attainments; gifted in prayer and exhortation to a remarkable degree; modest in his demeanor, ardent in his piety, sound in his judgment; having good common sense, a thorough knowledge of human nature, and those traits of character that make him a welcome guest in any house\\". ==Fulton Street Prayer Meeting== Although Lanphier distributed tracts, visited local businesses, invited children to Sunday school, and encouraged hotels to refer guests to the church on Sunday, he found that his time spent in prayer brought him the most peace and resolve, and he determined to start a weekly noon prayer meeting for businessmen that would take advantage of the hour when businesses were closed for lunch. The handbill he had printed read: \\"[Wednesday] prayer meeting from 12 to 1 o‚Äôclock. Stop 5, 10 or 20 minutes, or the whole time, as your time admits.\\" On September 23, 1857, he set up a signboard in front of the church. No one came to the appointed room, and Lanphier prayed by himself for thirty minutes. At 12:30 another man joined him, four more by the end of the hour.Prime, 7‚Äì8; The next week there were twenty men, forty the following week. In October the prayer meetings became daily, and in January 1858, a second room had to be used simultaneously, by February, a third. By then as many as twenty noon prayer meetings were being held elsewhere in the city. In mid-March Burton's Theatre, capable of holding 3,000, was crowded for the prayer meetings. By the end of March every downtown New York church and public hall was filled to capacity, and ten thousand men were gathering daily for prayer.Murray, 342‚Äì43; ==Revival of 1857‚Äì59== The telegraph and newspapers spread the news of this religious excitement in New York, and the Panic of 1857 undoubtedly added a sense of uncertainty and urgency to gatherings of businessmen. Similar prayer meetings were organized across the country. J. Edwin Orr, a student of the revival, estimated that perhaps as many a million people were converted in 1858 and 1859, more than 3% of a contemporary United States population of less than thirty million. Not long before his death, the thoughts of the late 19th- century evangelist Dwight L. Moody turned to this religious revival of his youth. \\"I would like before I go hence\\", he said, \\"to see the whole Church of God quickened as it was in '57.\\" Although it has been common in the 21st century to attribute the beginning of the revival to Lanphier's prayer meeting, his former pastor James Alexander believed that when Lanphier and \\"a few liked-minded servants of God\\" first met, \\"Revival was already begun. God had already poured out the Spirit of grace and of supplications. We doubt not there was a simultaneous effusion on other groups and in other places.\\" And as Iain Murray has suggested, the extent to which the revival was a \\"layman's revival\\" has also probably been exaggerated.Murray, 360. ==Later career and death== Meanwhile, throughout the revival and for years afterward, Lanphier continued to hold his daily prayer meeting in lower Manhattan. As the New York Times wrote after his retirement in 1893, \\"success did not elate him, nor was he discouraged by indifference\\". There were few simple rules for the prayer meeting that Lanphier politely but firmly enforced: that those praying out loud were to be limited to five minutes and that no controversial topics were to be discussed. Women did attend the meetings and could make requests but were not permitted to pray out loud. In the early days, hundreds of prayer requests came in to the Fulton Street meeting from all parts of the country sparking a fear that \\"a kind of superstitious feeling might be encouraged in those who send these communications\\". But it was decided not to refuse any request and to pray for them all in humility. When Lanphier finally retired because of age and his declining vision, it was estimated that he had presided at more than 11,000 prayer meetings, at which more than a half million people had attended over 36 years, and that 56,000 prayers had been offered and 225,000 written requests for prayer had been submitted, besides those made verbally.; Lanphier died on December 26, 1898, and is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn. To honor the 150th anniversary of the Prayer Meeting Revival, sculptor Lincoln Fox was commissioned to create a statue of Lanphier. The sculpture, first placed outside the headquarters of the American Bible Society and near the location where the prayer meetings had been held, depicts Lanphier seated on an (anachronistic) park bench, Bible in hand, inviting passersby to pray with him. After the ABS left New York City, the statue was moved to the lobby of The King's College. ==References== Category:1809 births Category:1898 deaths Category:American evangelicals Category:American evangelists Category:Christian revivalists Category:People from Coxsackie, New York Category:People from New York City Category:Tailors ","title":"Jeremiah Lanphier"},{"id":"63778532","text":"The Building at 999 Michigan, 200 Lee is a historic apartment building at the southeast corner of Michigan Avenue and Lee Street in Evanston, Illinois.

(Dfa) This gives the city cold, snowy winters and hot, humid summers and plentiful rainfall all year round. Meteorological records have been kept at Central Park since 1821, although the station was relocated to a different part of the park on January 1, 1920. There are also other weather stations in the area including one at LaGuardia Airport, beginning in 1940, and at JFK Airport, beginning in 1948. However, due to Central Park's long records and central location, it is often considered the main station for the city. Hence, all records unless otherwise stated will be for this station. The highest temperature ever observed in New York City is on July 9, 1936 and the lowest is on February 9, 1934. The lowest daily maximum is on 30 December 1917 at Central Park. The highest daily minimum at Central Park is on 4 dates, including: July 7, 1908, August 14, 1908, July 15, 1995 and July 22, 2011 However, LaGuardia reported on July 7, 1966. The city can be prone to extremes. Snowfall is a rare occurrence in the city, on average occurring on only 12 days per year, and it is infrequently heavy, but can be on occasion. Thunderstorms are also an occasional, on average occurring on 11 days per year. The city can also be prone to strong winds, being a coastal location it is exposed to the Atlantic. This can be especially pronounced during the autumn and winter months, with a gust of being reported on December 2, 1974.https://www.weather.gov/media/okx/Climate/CentralPark/extremes.pdf == Classifications == Union Square in autumn As a result of the city sitting in transitional zones, its climate can be characterised by more than one classification. In the Holdridge life zones system, having a mean annual biotemperature above and mean annual precipitation above , New York City features a warm temperate moist forest climate. ==Temperature== The city's regime of temperature features large seasonal swings, with 4 distinct seasons. However, due to its proximity to the Atlantic ocean, these swings are less significant than areas further inland. The Atlantic serves as a moderator of the temperature meaning the city is milder than areas inland during the winter and cooler during the summer. Although, being on the east coast, this effect is less pronounced. All extremes are for the Central Park station. ===Averages=== In an average year, the temperature will usually be between and with temperatures exceeding these values being uncommon. Temperatures above and below are very rare, with the last occurrences being July 18, 2012 and February 14, 2016, respectively. ===Highest daily temperatures=== { class=\\" mw-collapsible sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !Period !Record temperature !Date -   data-sort-value=\\"Jan 6, 2007\\" Jan 6, 2007 Jan 26, 1950 -   Feb 21, 2018 -   data-sort-value=\\"Mar 31, 1998\\" Mar 31, 1998 Mar 29, 1945 -   data-sort-value=\\"Apr 17, 2002\\" Apr 17, 2002 Apr 18, 1976 -   May 19, 1962 -   data-sort-value=\\"Jun 27, 1966\\" Jun 27, 1966 Jun 29, 1934 -    Jul 9, 1936 -    Aug 7, 1918 -    Sep 2, 1953 -    Oct 5, 1941 -    Nov 1, 1950 -    Dec 7, 1998 } ===Lowest daily temperatures=== { class=\\" mw-collapsible sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !Period !Record temperature !Date -    Jan 24, 1882 -   Feb 9, 1934 -   Mar 5, 1872 -   Apr 1, 1923 -   May 6, 1891 -    Jun 1, 1945 -    Jul 1, 1943 -   data- sort-value=\\"Aug 29, 1986\\" Aug 29, 1986 Aug 29, 1982 Aug 31, 1976 Aug 29-30, 1965 Aug 27-28, 1885 -    Sep 30, 1912 -    Oct 27, 1936 -    Nov 30, 1875 -    Dec 30, 1917 } ===Daily record warm minima=== { class=\\" mw-collapsible sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !Period !Record temperature !Date -   Jan 4, 1950 -   Feb 24, 2017 -   Mar 31, 1998 -   Apr 18, 2002 -   May 31, 1987 -   Jun 26, 1952 -   data-sort-value=\\"Jul 22, 2011\\"Jul 22, 2011 Jul 15, 1995 Jul 7, 1908 -   Aug 14, 1908 -   data-sort-value=\\"Sep 2, 1898\\"Sep 2, 1898 Sep 7, 1881 -   data-sort-value=\\"Oct 5, 1898\\"Oct 5, 1898 Oct 4, 1898 -    Nov 2, 1971 -    Dec 24, 2015 } ===Daily record cold maxima=== { class=\\" mw-collapsible sortable\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - !Period !Record temperature !Date -   Jan 24, 1882 -   Feb 5, 1918 -   Mar 5, 1872 -   data-sort-value=\\"Apr 7, 1982\\"Apr 7, 1982 Apr 5, 1881 -   data-sort-value=\\"May 5, 1891\\"May 5, 1891 May 3, 1873 -   data-sort-value=\\"Jun 2, 1946\\"Jun 2, 1946 Jun 4, 1945 Jun 2, 1907 -   Jul 6, 1956 -   data-sort-value=\\"Aug 21, 2007\\"Aug 21, 2007 Aug 31, 1911 -   Sep 19, 1875 -   Oct 30, 1925 -    Nov 30, 1875 -    Dec 30, 1917 } === Highest averages === { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !Period !Record mean !Year - Year  2012 -  Spring (March‚ÄìMay)  2010 -  Summer (June‚ÄìAugust)  2010 -  Autumn (September‚ÄìNovember)  1931, 2015 -  Winter (December‚ÄìFebruary)  2001‚Äì2002 -  January   1932 -  February  2018 -  March  1945 -  April  2012 -  May  1991 -  June   1943 -  July   1999 -  August   1980 -  September   2015 -  October   2017 -  November   2015 -  December   2015 } === Lowest averages === { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - !Period !Record mean !Year - Year   1888 -  Spring (March‚ÄìMay)   1888 -  Summer (June‚ÄìAugust)   1903 -  Autumn (September‚ÄìNovember)   1871 -  Winter (December‚ÄìFebruary)  1917‚Äì1918 -  January   1918 -  February  1934 -  March  1888 -  April  1874 -  May  1917 -  June   1903 -  July   1888 -  August   1927 -  September   1871 -  October   1888 -  November   1873 -  December   1876 } ==Precipitation== Snow at Central Park during the winter in 2011.

Moyer Ohio Judicial Center is a state courthouse, office building, and library in Columbus, Ohio, in the city's downtown Civic Center. The building is the headquarters of the Supreme Court of Ohio, the state's highest court, as well as the Ohio Court of Claims and Ohio Judicial Conference. The judicial center is named after the court's former chief justice Thomas J. Moyer. The building was designed by Harry Hake in the Art Deco style. It was built from 1930 to 1933, known as the Ohio Departments Building, as it first housed Ohio state departments. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Beginning in 2001, an extensive renovation restored the building, and set it up to be used for the Supreme Court of Ohio. The building reopened in 2004, marking the first time the court was established in a building solely for the judiciary, and the first time the building was open to the public. ==History== The Supreme Court of Ohio was founded in the state constitution, approved in 1802. It was located in the Ohio Statehouse beginning in 1857 and moved into the Statehouse Annex in 1901. In the next few decades, Ohio's government added more employees within the statehouse buildings, with multiple departments outgrowing their spaces there. The idea to house these departments was first proposed in 1913. Discussion of whether to build shifted to where to build and how to finance the construction. In 1929, the city of Columbus donated to the state for the offices, spurring further development of the project. Cincinnati-based architect Harry Hake was hired to design the building. He wrote 292 pages of specifications, a design estimated at $5 million, with $1.5 million of that used to purchase additional property, financed by a statewide property tax. Construction was tumultuous, with Hake having been hired just three months before the start of the Great Depression. The building's construction began in 1930, often delayed by labor disputes. During construction, on April 14, 1932, a gas explosion significantly damaged the building, killing 11 people and injuring 50. Multiple windows were destroyed, along with staircases up to the fifth floor, and the bronze doors on the building's west side were blown off their hinges. Repairs were made promptly, adding a cost of $750,000, bringing the cost to over $6.5 million. The building was completed in 1933. The building was named the Ohio Departments Building, as it housed the Industrial Commission of Ohio, State Library of Ohio, and the departments of Aeronautics, Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Health, Highways, Public Welfare, Public Works, Industrial Relations and Taxation. During Ohio Statehouse renovations in the early 1990s, the building was also home to the Ohio House of Representatives. In 1997, the Ohio government set aside funds to move the Supreme Court of Ohio to the Ohio Departments Building; the court had been located in the Rhodes State Office Tower since 1974. In 1998, the Ohio General Assembly approved renovations to the building which would convert it into the judicial center. Columbus-based architecture firm Schooley Caldwell was hired to make the renovations. Beginning in 2001, the building's detailwork was restored, while its utilities were modernized. The Grand Concourse and original hearing rooms were restored, and the State Library was converted to the Supreme Court Law Library. Completed in 2004, the building reopened on February 17, and the Supreme Court of Ohio became its largest tenant. It marked the first time the court was established in a building solely for the judiciary, and the first time the building was open to the public. Its reopening ceremony was attended by then-U.S. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Thomas J. Moyer, and about 170 other judges. ==Operations== The building is home to the Supreme Court of Ohio, the state's highest court, as well as the Ohio Court of Claims and Ohio Judicial Conference. ==Attributes and design== It is located on South Front St., on the east bank of the Scioto River. The building was carefully planned on the center of the riverfront, with reflecting pools, lawns terraces, trees, and shrubs situated around it. The Scioto Mile Promenade, completed in 2015, lies directly across from it. The building was designed by Cincinnati-based architect Harry Hake. It has 14 stories, white marble exterior facades, and Art Deco designs detailed with metals, tiles, colored marble, mosaics, and murals. The streamline shape of the building depicts its function through its large exterior mass. Its office space is expressed by its large, unadorned middle shaft, while its public lobbies and hearing rooms are expressed through the projecting stories on its west side. The State Library of Ohio was represented through the large windows at the top of the building, with its stack area in the stepped-back building crown. The building's Civic Center Drive entrance has three sets of heavy bronze doors, sculpted by Alvin Meyer. The doors have bronze cast panels depicting elements of early American history, including Ohio's mounds. The doors are overlaid with large bronze grills silhouetting Native American tribal symbols. The state and federal seals are carved between each door, with their respective flag flying above each. The judicial center features about 170 works of art between its interior, exterior, and grounds. The works, primarily by Ohio artists, were together valued at $935,000 around 2008. The collection includes Gavel, a massive gavel sculpture created in 2008 and installed in the south reflecting pool on the building's grounds. The sculpture is the largest and most expensive at the judicial center. ===Interior=== The judicial center's first floor holds the Grand Concourse, its courtroom, hearing room, and a meeting room. Its ground floor includes the Civic Center Lobby and Visitor Education Center. The eleventh floor holds the Law Library, including a reading room and art galleries. The courtroom was formerly the building's largest hearing room, while the Law Library was converted from its former use as the State Library of Ohio. The building's Visitor Education Center includes exhibits about the history, role and responsibility of the Ohio court system. ==Gallery== File:Ohio State Office Building 01.jpgWest entranceway File:Ohio State Office Building 18.jpgEast entrance File:Ohio State Office Building 11.jpgSouth facade File:Ohio State Office Building 24.jpgAt night File:Ohio State Office Building 06.jpgGavel sculpture File:Ohio State Office Building 09.jpgMosaic ceilings File:Ohio State Office Building 07.jpgEast doors File:Ohio State Office Building 19.jpgOne of numerous industry murals ==See also== * National Register of Historic Places listings in Columbus, Ohio ==References== ==External links== * Category:Art Deco architecture in Ohio Category:Buildings in downtown Columbus, Ohio Category:Government buildings completed in 1933 Category:Government buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Columbus, Ohio Category:Office buildings completed in 1933 Category:Courthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Government buildings in Columbus, Ohio ","title":"Ohio Judicial Center"},{"id":"63778708","text":"Stiwart Alejando Acu√±a L√≥pez (born 6 February 1999) is a Colombian footballer who plays as a right winger for Categor√≠a Primera B side Barranquilla. ==Club career== ===Barranquilla=== Started playing football at the age of 5 in a little school in El Bosque.

It was written by Sir Charles Oman. Clarendon Press published the first volume in 1902 and volume seven in 1930. ==About the seven volumes== This seven-volume history is described as appealing, scholarly, thorough, and definitive. The author does acknowledge politics and diplomacy throughout, but the main narrative focus seems to be on military events. Additionally, human beings on the field are the focus rather than military units \\"with numerical designations.\\" The books present equal analysis to all the powers involved in the seven year conflict. Many of the important actors and decision makers in the armies of Spain, Portugal, the first French empire, and Britain are included. Oman's writing style is late Victorian, cleverly humorous, and genial in places, demonstrating a facility for story-telling. Meanwhile, he ensures the pertinent facts of the many covered events are presented. Regarding scholarship, Oman went \\"through everything available\\" and then dug for more, discovering diaries, memoirs, military dispatches, general orders, \\"parliamentary papers\\", filed newspapers, pertinent national archives, and so on. He personally reconnoitered relevant geographical areas enabling him to give first hand descriptions of the topography. Also, Oman's \\"studies of personalities and their thought processes, [has revealed] the depth of his research.\\" Oman is widely perceived as unbiased with his coverage. In fact, one of his main objectives for writing this history was to counter Sir William Napier's seemingly flawed recounting of events in Napier's own six volume work entitled, \\"History of the War in the Peninsula and in the South of France.\\" Oman perceived Napier's account as heavily biased, exaggerating Spanish defeats and minimizing Spanish successes, while also diminishing entrenched Spanish resistance which frustrated the Duke of Wellington. Interestingly, Napier had high regard for Napoleon while at the same time being critical of the Spanish. Oman also said a tremendous amount of source material had become available since publication of Napier's work, as another reason for creating this historical account. Producing this seven volume history spanned 30 years and it demonstrates Oman's unflagging \\"industry, perseverance, and volume of reading.\\" He personally reconnoitered the \\"very scene[s] of action [of] nearly all Wellington's battlefields.\\" Appendices, lists of casualties, and clearly illustrated maps complete this endeavor. ==Chronology== This history was published between 1902 and 1930 in seven volumes: *Volume 1 was published in 1902. It covers the years 1807‚Äì1809. It is entitled \\" Treaty of Fontainebleau to Corunna. \\" 673 pages. * Volume 2 was published in 1903. Coverage includes January to September 1809 and is entitled \\" Corunna to end of Talavera campaign. \\" 670 pages. * Volume 3 was published in 1908. It covers September 1809 to December 1810 and is entitled \\" Ocana, Cadiz, Bussaco, Torres Vedras. \\" 575 pages. * Volume 4 was published in 1911. It covers December 1810 to December 1811 and is entitled \\" Masss√©na's retreat, Fuentes de Onoro, Albuera, Tarragon \\" 672 pages. * Volume 5 was published in 1914. It covers October 1811 to August 1812, and is entitled \\"Valencia, Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Salamanca, Madrid.\\" 642 pages. * Volume 6 was published in 1922. Coverage encompasses the beginning of September 1812 to the beginning of August 1813. It is entitled \\"Siege of Burgos, retreat from Burgos, Vittoria, Pyrenees.\\" 790 pages. *Volume 7 was published in 1930. Coverage includes August 1813 to the middle of April 1814. It is entitled \\"St Sebastian, invasion of France, Nivelle... Greenhill Books of London and Stackpole Books of Pennsylvania republished all seven volumes between 1995 and 1997. ==Wellington's army== Within the first nine years of researching and writing this history, Oman had also gathered other notes and materials that only tangentially correlated to \\"A History of Peninsular War.\\" He wouldn't be able to use the material for this seven volume history. So, he used the material to write a different book entitled \\"Wellington's Army 1809‚Äî1814.\\" It was originally published in 1913. The book includes the \\"organization, day by day life, and psychology\\" of Wellington's Army during the Peninsular War. Internet Archive.

From 21 March to 1 May 2019, they opened along with Misery Signals and Left Behind on Darkest Hour and Unearth's European co-headline tour. Between 1 and 6 December, the band opened for Knocked Loose on their UK headline tour along with Renounced and Justice for the Damned. In late 2019, the band established their own record label MLVLTD Music as a means to continue releasing music with as much control as possible. On 18 January 2020, they played Invasion Festival in Sydney. On 28 February 2020, the released the song Keep Your Distance, featuring Bryan Garris of Knocked Loose, as a single. On 26 March, they released a music video for their single Remain Unbeaten. Both songs were included on their EP released April 24 titled The Other Side. In reference to the released of an EP, Taylor stated that \\"We wanted to make a short body of work to put out whilst we continue writing for our next full-length album, whilst also trying to push ourselves out of our comfort zone as much as possible\\". ==Musical style== The band have been categorised as hardcore punk, metalcore, beatdown hardcore and sludge metal. Vocalist Alex Taylor described the band's sound upon forming as having \\"a weird, melodeath, kinda At the Gates vibe\\" Rock Sound described them as \\"the perfect crossover between hardcore and metal\\", while Noizze described their music as a merger between hardcore punk, heavy metal and thrash metal, as well as \\"a sludge-ridden, toxic hybrid of post- hardcore, thrash, metalcore and Texas blues\\". They often make use of dual vocals between Taylor and Hall. Rob Barbour from Metal Hammer described their music as \\"evok[ing] the very best whisky-swiggin‚Äô, weed-smoking bands that ever swaggered out of states like Texas and New Orleans. Although their King Kong-size riffs are backed by brutal rhythms from the no-frills hardcore playbook, there's no mistaking their origin. Of course they're from the Deep South... of Yorkshire.\\" Writer Stephen Hill described their sound as \\"like Dimebag Darrell has joined Hatebreed to work on a sludge album\\". The Sound Board Review described how \\"Malevolence unquestionably shine, laying down riffs that switch between pounding metallic hardcore and filthy sludge-metal with consummate ease and equal proficiency\\". Distorted Sound Magazine described it as a \\"confident combination of the shredding riffs of metal and the belligerent slam of hardcore meant that they were able to straddle both genres with confidence\\". They have cited influences including Terror, Madball, Down, Pantera, Crowbar, and Despised Icon. In an article for The Quietus, Dan Franklin described their music as \\"rooted in the beefed-up chuggery of the turn-of-the-millennium New Wave of American Heavy Metal ‚Äì Chimaira‚Äôs The Impossibility Of Reason, Hatebreed‚Äôs Satisfaction Is the Death of Desire and Perseverance, with a dollop of Crowbar‚Äôs Sonic Excess in Its Purest Form\\". ==Members== File:Taste of Anarchy Fest 2016 - Malevolence (18).JPGAlex Taylor File:20150425 Oberhausen Impericon Festival Malevolence 0011.jpgJosh Baines File:Taste of Anarchy Fest 2016 - Malevolence (10).JPGKonan Hall File:Taste of Anarchy Fest 2016 - Malevolence (33).JPGWilkie Robinson File:Taste of Anarchy Fest 2016 - Malevolence (27).JPGCharlie Thorpe *Alex Taylor ‚Äì lead vocals *Josh Baines ‚Äì guitar *Konan Hall ‚Äì guitar, vocals *Wilkie Robinson ‚Äì bass *Charlie Thorpe ‚Äì drums ==Discography== ;Studio albums *Reign of Suffering (2013) *Self Supremacy (2017) ;EPs *The Other Side (2020) ;Demos *Demo (2011) ==References== Category:2010 establishments in England Category:British metalcore musical groups Category:Musical groups from Sheffield Category:Musical groups established in 2010 Category:Musical quintets Category:British hardcore punk groups Category:Sludge metal musical groups ","title":"Malevolence (band)"},{"id":"63778822","text":"Alice Reilly (1702/3 ‚Äì 1778) was an Irish printer and publisher. ==Biography== Alice Reilly was born Alice Abbot in 1702 or 1703. She married the printer and publisher Richard Reilly on 10 October 1733, and after his death in July 1741, took over his business. She paid quarterage fees to the printers guild, the Guild of St Luke the Evangelist, but could not be a full member as she was a woman. From 1741 to 1762 she was a tenant at the Guild in Stationers Hall, Skinner Row, a building that was demolished as part of the Wide Streets Commission in June 1762. She then operated from Temple Bar from 1763 to 1767. Having created a large successful business, it was housed on guild premises and she took on apprentices recognised by the guild including her nephew John Abbott Husband. In 1776 she is listed as having six apprentices and seven journeymen. She published the Dublin News-Letter, which had been renamed The Oracle under her husband. She co-published this with Edward Exshaw from 1741 to 1744. With Exshaw, Reilly was appointed by the Dublin Society as their official printers on 24 March 1743, on terms that Reilly's husband had agreed. The Dublin News-Letter was effectively the Society's publication, and contained their notices and transactions, which guaranteed Reilly a regular income, with 500 issues printed twice weekly. She also published a range of books, produced for Exshaw and others, as well as book catalogues in 1775 and 1760. Reilly started publishing The Dublin Courant in April 1744, selling it to Oliver Nelson in September 1745. Reilly was one of many Dublin printers and stationers who wrote in protest against unlicensed individuals participating in their trade in 1766, but this did not remedy the situation. Reilly died in Dublin on 19 April 1778, having retired around 1767. ==References== Category:1700s births Category:1778 deaths Category:18th-century publishers (people) Category:Irish publishers (people) Category:18th-century Irish businesspeople ","title":"Alice Reilly"},{"id":"63778824","text":"The flag of Albuquerque, New Mexico is the official municipal flag of Albuquerque, New Mexico. The design is a red field with yellow elements (a Zia sun symbol with the number \\"1706\\" in the middle, the word \\"Albuquerque\\" in italics just below the sun symbol, and a flying thunderbird in the canton). Multiple pushes have been made to redesign the flag, even getting some city council members to suggest an open contest and public vote. No change has been made despite these efforts. ==Design and symbolism== The sun symbolizes the history of the Zia people who settled in the area, and the 4 rays symbolize the importance of the number four in the spiritual beliefs of the Zia society, with the four cardinal directions, the four seasons, the four times of day (sunrise, noon, sunset, night), and the four periods of life (childhood, youth, adulthood, old age). The Zia also believe that a person has four duties: to develop a strong body, a clear mind, a pure spirit, and a devotion to the welfare of people. The Zia symbol also has an obvious connection to the Flag of New Mexico, with both flags using it as a prominent element (in the case of New Mexico, the only element). The mythological thunderbird in the top left is perhaps a representation of the city's progress through the years. The \\"1706\\" honors the Spanish founders of the city. ==History== The history behind the flag is somewhat uncertain. Supposedly, the Zonta Club of Albuquerque solicited the design, which was said to be made by optometrist Dr. Richard T. Vann. Prior to the selection of the design, on January 13, 1969, the Albuquerque Council of Camp Fire Girls presented a 5:8-proportion flag it had made to Clyde Scharrer, the city's aviation director. More than a month later, the flag was presented to the city commission. On January 26, 1970, the Zonta Club presented four more flags to the city commission. The flag placed 25th out of 150 American city flag designs in a 2004 North American Vexillological Association survey. ==Usage== The flag is not used that much. It sits behind city councilors during meetings, and it flies outside the Albuquerque Convention Center and the Anderson-Abruzzo Albuquerque International Balloon Museum. ==References== Category:Flags of cities in the United States Category:Albuquerque, New Mexico Category:1969 establishments in New Mexico Category:Flags introduced in 1969 Category:Flag controversies in the United States Category:Flags displaying animals ","title":"Flag of Albuquerque"},{"id":"63778826","text":"William Heysham Overend (5 October 185118 March 1898) was a notable British marine artist and book illustrator who died prematurely in 1898. ==Early life== St Cuthbert's Church, Darlington William Heysham Overend was born on 5 October 1851 in Coatham, County Durham. Many sources state that his birthplace was Coatham, North Yorkshire near Middlesbrough. However, it seems more likely that his birthplace was Coatham Mundeville near Darlington, as: *His birth was registered in Darlington, Durham. *He was baptised in St Cuthbert's Church, Darlington, less than 6.5 km from Coatham Mundeville. *He and his parents gave Darlington as his birthplace on census returns. *Mayhew's statement that he was born miles inland (Coatham in Yorkshire is on the coast). His parents were James Overend (18212 November 1875), a flax spinner, born in Bentham, Yorkshire, and Martha n√©e Hodgson (18241886), born in Hawkshead, Lancashire and the daughter of Braithwaite Hodgson, a wealthy landowner. The family lived in Priestgate, Darlington in the 1850s, but the 1861 census found them living at No, 2, Buccleuch Terrace, Hackney. By now, his father was a railway contractor. Overend was educated at both Charterhouse School,where he only spent one year, and Bruce Castle School, where he remained until 1867. He was already showing early promise as Athol states that a sketch drawn by him at age 14, of a boarding party, would not have disgraced a student of the Royal Academy. After leaving Bruce Castle School in the summer of 1857, Overend spend the next three years in the studio of Davis Cooper, son of Abraham Cooper . Here he went through the traditional course of art training, but continued to teach himself after leaving the studio. By 1871, he was a lodger, with the profession of artist (painter), together with Edward Overend, an unemployed Naval Engineer, in a small lodging house at 14 Clapton Terrace in Hackney, London. ==Work== Trafalgar by William Haysham Overend. This painting was displayed posthumously in the Royal Academy in 1898. Overend found it difficult at first to earn his living as a painter. His first successful submission to the Royal Academy was in 1872, and by 1880 he had exhibited twice with both the Royal Academy and the Society of British Artists. He continued to exhibit throughout his life, including at the Royal Academy, The Society of British Artists, the Royal Society of Painters in Oils, Liverpool, Glasgow, 1891 Naval Exhibition, and the 1883 World Columbian Exhibition. Beginning as a painter, Overend moved into illustration. His connection with the Illustrated London News began in 1875 when he illustrated the Sir George Nares Artic expedition. For the next decade at least he was second only to Richard Caton Woodville as an illustrator for the paper. Overend also illustrated articles in The English Illustrated Magazine from 1891, Good Words from 1894, The Rambler from 1897, The Pall Mall Magazine, and the juvenile periodicals The Boy's Own Paper, and Chums from 1892, Overend also drew for The Illustrated Naval and Military Magazine, The Graphic, The Magazine of Art, and The Leisure Hour, London Society, St. Nicholas, and The Penny Illustrated Paper. Overend's work was characterised by thoroughness. He maintained a stock of uniforms and weapons to serve as models for his drawings. During the 1891 Naval Exhibition at Chelsesa (2 May 1891October 1891) he loaned the following to the exhibition from his collection: *9 assorted Naval officers swords and Midshipmen's dirks *A 1:48 scale model of a Frigate *9 assorted Naval and Marine coats and hats *Various paintings including a coloured sheet of 12 figures in Navy costumes for 1854 Overend was not just an artist, but an engraver. He records his occupation as steel engraver in the 1891 census. Newbolt notes that Overend probably carved the woodcuts for some of his illustrations, including for the six illustrations for G. A. Henty's A Chapter of Adventures. Overend was elected a member of the Royal Institute of Painters in Oils on 27 January 1886. He was elected to the Council of the Navy Records Society in 1897. These two elections illustrate that his work was recognised not only by his artistic peers, but also by naval historians. ===Ship illustrations=== One of the strangest things about Overend is that he was a landsman, bred and born. He was b miles from the coast, and had no relatives in either the merchant or naval service, yet his knowledge of past and present ships of war was matched by few sailors. The following illustrations were drawn by Overend for the Illustrated Naval and Military Magazine in 1884 for articles on the development of naval warfare.

The painting is enormous, being 3.048m (10 feet) wide by 1.969m (6 feet 5¬Ω inches) high. It was painted in oils on canvas. Overend was commissioned by the Fine Art Society, an art gallery with showrooms in London and Glasgow, to produce a painting of a naval battle of the American Civil War. Kirkpatrick states that Overend was commissioned to paint Admiral Porter's conquest of New Orleans, and that the Farragut painting was additional. Kirkpatrick further states that the Farragut painting was painted while Overend was in the United States. However, Mayhew, who was a colleague of Overend's, makes no reference to the New Orleans painting, but states that from the first the commission was for what became the Farragut painting, he also states that the work was painted in Overend's Ormond Street studio in London. Overend attacked the commission with his usual thoroughness. He left Liverpool for New York, arriving on the RMS Scythia on 4 October 1882. Knowing virtually no-one in the United State, but supplied with letters of introduction from the US Minister in London to the navy department at Washington, he went vigorously to work to collect his material. He visited the ship to sketch it. He collected naval uniforms, plans, arms, sketches, photographs, and studies. He interviewed survivors and enlisted the aid of Farragut's son, a Naval Captain, in his researches. Overend painted the officers and men from photographs taken after their arrival in New Orleans. Overend returned to London with all the reference material he had collected to paint the picture. While in the United States Overend visited the 1883 Columbian Exhibition in Chicago where he exhibited a painting, Victory!: the Prize Crew taking possession, and some drawings. The title of the work, and even the work itself, were both drawn from a vivid account of the battle of Mobile harbour by J. C. Kinney which was published in the June 1881 edition of Scribner's Magazine under the title An August Morning with Farragut. The incident described in the painting can briefly be described as follows. On the morning of 4 August 1864 Admiral Farragut's fleet, consisting of 14 ships and four monitors forced their way past the forts protecting Mobile Bay. The Admiral was about his flagship, the Hartford, a wooden hulled combined steam- and-sail ship. On 5 August 1864, the steam-powered ironclad Confederate ram CSS Tennessee, the flagship of the small Confederate fleet of four ships, attempted to ram the Hartford. It struck the Hartford a glancing blow on the port bow and then the ships ground past each other, the moment captured in the painting. In the painting, the observer seems to be at the port taffrail amidships on the Hartford, looking backwards towards the wheel and quarter- deck. The Tenessessee is grinding along the port side of the Hartford moving deeper into the scenne. Farragut is shown standing on the quarter-rail holding onto the rigging, where tradition holds that the lashed himself on in case he were hit. Overend returned from America and painted the work in his painting in 1883 in his Ormonde Street Studio. The Pall Mall Gazette of 1 November 1883 announced that the Fine Art Society would shortly be selling prints of the painting. The painting was on display in the premises of James S Earle and Sons, in Philadelphia in September 1884. In 1885 G. A. R. Dorchester were selling prints of the painting for 25 cents each. The painting was valued at $4,000 when it was displayed in at an art dealer's in Buffalo, New York in May 1885. It was also displayed in other towns throughout the US including Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and finally in Hartford, Connecticutin January 1886. Hartford was the town for which Farragut's flagship was named. By February the local newspaper, the Hartford Courant, had already begun a campaign to purchase the picture for Hartford,The justification for the purchase was that: *The flagship was named for Hartford. *The Hartford Poet Harry Howard Brownell was featured in the painting *P. C. Kinney who had written the account of the battle was from Hartford and was featured in the painting. with the intent to donate the painting the free picture gallery in the Wadsworth Atheneum. The newspaper estimated the painting was worth $10,000 but could be obtained for about one third of this price. Three subscribers had already contributed $100 each to the fund. The subscription was successful as the painting was hung in the Wadsworth Athenaeum in c. May 1886. ===Book illustration=== Kirkpatrick lists over 100 books illustrated by Overend for over four dozen authors. The authors he illustrated for included: *E. M. Alford (18411905), an English poet and writer of historical fiction *Sir Reginald Bacon (18631947), a Royal Navy Admiral who wrote mostly about naval issues *F. C.

The death certificate gave a number of causes of death including Locomotor ataxia which is often a symptom of tertiary syphilis. Other causes included Catarrh of the Bowels (diarrhoea), and Albuminuria, an indicator of kidney disease. His doctor stated that he had been suffering for ten years. The columnist on the Penny Illustrated Paper noted that Overend had never been strong since he injured his leg, and that he had complained of Catarrh of the Bowels the last time he had dropped a drawing off at the Illustrated London News. He was buried on Wednesday, 23 March 1898 in Tottenham Cemetery. His estate was valued at over ¬£3,000, a very respectable sum for the period. ==Assessment== Despite his early death \\"he did a prodigious amount of work in his comparatively short life\\".

His knowledge of the detail of the old ships was unequalled, and his accuracy in matters naval, both archaeological and of the present day, was proverbial. Modest, unassuming, and amiable, no man was more cordially liked by his professional brethren, while the high appreciation in which he was held by those who cherish naval art and literature was shown by his election to the council of the Navy Records Society.\\" The headmaster of Charterhouse, twenty years after Overend left the school, wrote to him to request material for the Greyfriars magazine, produced by former pupils, and referred to him as \\"the most distinguished draughtsman the school had ever turned out.\\" The Arts Club said of him: \\"A painter and black-and-white artist of great ability; held in affection by every member of the club.\\" This was not a graveside eulogy, but a description of him more than 20 years after his death. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * *Books illustrated by Overend in Jisc Library Hub Discover *An August Morning with Farragut: The Battle of Mobile Bay, August 5, 1864 at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art *Overend's biography at Aberystwyth University. *A painting by Overend at the [Royal Museums Greenwich.

It is located northwest of the city centre, about 200 metres southwest of the University of Duisburg-Essen (built in 1972) and 300 metres northwest of the Limbecker Platz shopping centre (built in 2008/2009). ==History== The street has been associated with prostitution since around 1900, at that time under the name Heilig-Geist-Stra√üe. The street was renamed Stahlstra√üe (Steel Street) in honour of the Essen steel company Krupp It is regarded as one of the oldest red-light districts in Germany. After the introduction of the Gesetz zur Bek√§mpfung der Geschlechtskrankheiten (Venereal Disease Control Act) in 1927, Essen police took control of the entrance to Stahlstra√üe and took down the names of men entering the street. This practice was stopped only after the intervention of Minister of the Interior, Albert Grzesinski. In 1965, the magazine Der Spiegel reported Stahlstra√üe had 17 brothels with a total workforce of over 200 prostitutes on occasions. The prostitutes including included those from Italy, the Netherlands and France. ==Modern times== In 2013, the 17 brothels in Stahlstra√üe were reported to employ about 100 to 120 women.

Kichka was the only member of his family to have survived the deportation of Belgian Jews to camps in Central and Eastern Europe. He began speaking on the importance of the memory of those who perished at the hands of the Nazis in the 1980s and spoke widely on his experiences to school audience. In 2005, published his autobiography, Une adolescence perdue dans la nuit des camps, prefaced by Serge Klarsfeld. He is the father of cartoonist Michel Kichka. ==Biography== ===Childhood and the Holocaust=== Henri Kichka was born in Brussels, Belgium on 14 April 1926 into a Jewish family which had emigrated from Poland. His father, Josek Kichka (Kiszka), had been born in Skierniewice, Russian Empire {today's Poland} in 1898, and fled the country in 1918 as a result of rising Polish anti-Semitism, moving to Belgium. His mother, Chana Gruszka, had been born in Ka≈Çuszyn in 1899 and arrived in Belgium in 1924. The couple renounced their Polish nationality in Belgium and became stateless. Henri was the eldest of the couple's three children. In 1935, the family moved to the Brussels municipality of Saint-Gilles where the family became moderately involved with the local synagogue. In school, Henri learned French, Yiddish, and German. He was forbidden from learning Polish. Belgium was invaded in May 1940 and placed under military occupation. The family fled the invasion as part of the exode and ended up in French Third Republic, arriving in Toulouse. They settled temporarily in Revel and were ultimately forced into a refugee camp in Agde by the Vichy authorities. They moved to several different camps and were then released to Paris. On 1 August 1942, Kichka's sister, Bertha, received her summons to Mechelen transit camp ostensibly for compulsory labor service in Eastern Europe. The family accompanied her to the train station, and it would be the last time they saw her. Bertha Kichka was murdered upon arrival at Auschwitz concentration camp in August 1942. The rest of the family was deported in the Ninth Convoy of 12 September 1942. Kichka and his father were assigned to work on a railroad, and his mother, aunt, and sister were killed at Auschwitz on 14 September 1942. Henri and Josek were moved from camp to camp in Germany working as forced labourers and participated in a death march to Gross-Rosen and Buchenwald concentration camps in the final weeks of the war. Henri was liberated on 30 April 1945 but Josek had died at Buchenwald a few days earlier after having a foot amputated. Kichka was sent to the airport in Weimar, where he stayed for 17 days, and was then transported back to Belgium by a truck. He weighed . He stayed at a reception center in Uccle, Brussels and was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He stayed at Brugmann Hospital in Alsemberg for 16 months. He joined an orphanage on 30 August 1946. He was the only child there who had survived the concentration camps, with the rest of them having been Hidden Children. He then rented an apartment with his friend, Beno Linzer and began as a leather worker. In 1947, he joined the Union sportive des jeunes Juifs. On 9 April 1949, Kichka married Lucia ≈öwierczy≈Ñski. He obtained Belgian nationality in 1952, and his life returned to normal. He would later write that his adolescence was \\"lost\\" in the concentration camps. He had four children with Lucia: Khana, Michel, Ir√®ne, and Charly. They had nine grandchildren and numerous great-grandchildren. Lucia died on 22 September 2001. ===Holocaust education=== Kichka did not discuss what he had endured until the 1980s. The suicide of his son Charly changed his attitude and he became a prominent figure in Holocaust education in Belgium. He spoke widely on the subject in school and took part in school visits to Auschwitz and \\"educating the young about the Holocaust became his raison d‚Äô√™tre\\". He published a memoir in 2005. Henri Kichka died on 25 April 2020 at the age of 94 in Brussels as a result of COVID-19. ==Publications== *Une adolescence perdue dans la nuit des camps.

It was part of M0 motorway until 2013 when it was renamed. Many people still mistakenly call it M0. The bypass of road 51 around Dunaharaszti (a 2x1 road) is also included in M51. ==History== The first section of the M0 motorway was constructed in 1988 as a bypass of main road 51 in Dunaharaszti. It was planned that the next section of the M0 would have continued through a tunnel under populated areas in Budapest's Eighteenth District, but due to its high cost, this plan was abandoned. As a result, due to the existence of Ferenc Liszt International Airport and populated areas, the eastern section of the M0 had to be placed much further south than originally planned. Because of this change in planning, it was no longer possible to connect the old section to the rest of M0 because of its location, so a new section, immediately adjacent to the existing M0, had to be built between main road 51 and the M5 motorway, a 6.3 km long section inaugurated on August 13, 2013. As a result of this, the section between main road 51 and the M5 motorway has been split from M0 and has become the M51 motorway, which, like its original function, passes between the M5 motorway, main road 51, and the M0 ring road. == See also == * Roads in Hungary * Transport in Hungary ==References== == External links == *National Toll Payment Services Plc.

He studied economics in Freiburg and Cologne. After his graduation, he became assistant to Alfred M√ºller-Armack and worked from 1965 to 1969 at his Institute for Economic Policy in the University of Cologne. M√ºller-Armack, who had invented the term 'social market economy‚Äô had previously worked under Economics Minister Ludwig Erhard and then served as a state secretary for European Affairs. In 1967, Starbatty was awarded a Ph.D. From 1969 to 1972, he worked for the CDU/CSU faction in the Bundestag, the German parliament. After completing his Habilitation, he became a professor at the University of Bochum in 1976. Later he taught at the University of Tubingen, where he held the chair for economics from 1983 to 2006. Starbatty taught several times as a guest professor at the University of Washington (1991, 1995, and 2002) in Seattle and at the Doshisha University in Kyoto, Japan. He received an honorary doctorate from the Viadrina University of Frankfurt (Oder). He is the author of several books on economics, the history of economics and lately also on political affairs, the last one together with Hans-Olaf Henkel, former head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), with a harsh critique of Chancellor Angela Merkel. He also published numerous newspaper comments in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Handelsblatt and lately in Junge Freiheit. == Political activism == Starbatty has always advocated the \\"ordoliberal\\" economic model of the Freiburg School with a free market economy and a state that guarantees free and fair competition. For two decades he was a member of the CDU. In the 1990s, he was one of the leading opponents among the economics professor against the establishment of the Euro currency. He feared that the Euro would not be as strong and stable as the Deutsche Mark, that it might result in higher inflation and that Germany might ultimately be compelled to pay for the national debt of other countries within the currency zone. In 2010, when the Euro crisis erupted, he thought his fears had come true. Starbatty has launched together with other professors several legal challenges against the currency union and later the monetary policy of the European Central Bank at the German Constitutional Court with ultimately all failed. In 2013, he was among the founders of the Eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany (AfD). He was elected to the European Parliament in 2014 where he served on the Committee for External Affairs and the Committee for International Trade. He left the AfD in 2015, citing concerns that the party moving further to the political right would make \\"making different politics\\", which he had intended to do, an impossibility. Following his departure, he joined the Liberal Conservative Reformers, a small party founded by former AfD leader Bernd Lucke, but left in September 2018. Starbatty continues to be a member of the advisory board of the Desiderius-Erasmus-Stiftung, a foundation close to the AfD. == References == Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:German economists Category:Alternative for Germany politicians Category:Politicians from D√ºsseldorf Category:Christian Democratic Union of Germany politicians Category:Members of the European Parliament for Germany Category:University of T√ºbingen faculty ","title":"Joachim Starbatty"},{"id":"63779369","text":"Margarita Sofocleous (; born 16 December 1986) is a Cypriot footballer who plays as a defender.

One theory is that the dance was derived from the galopa folk dance, which consists of dancers performing with jugs on top of their heads, with dancers replacing jugs with glass bottles. ==Performance== Bottle dances performances feature female dancers wearing nineteenth century rural costumes that includes an ankle-length skirt. Performances are typically accompanied by music from the Paraguayan polka genre. Bottle dance performances tend to be largely improvised with basic moves consisting of dancers with outstretched arms holding the ruffles of their skirts while maintaining the impression that there aren't any bottles. The dance can be perform by individuals, pairs, or groups with each dancer balancing one or two bottles but more advanced dancers are able balance ten or more bottles on their heads. The bottles used by dancers are usually decorated with a tricolored ribbon resembling the Paraguayan flag or with flowers. Also, when a dancer performs with multiple stacked bottles, she uses bottles designed to attach to each other but do not attach her head. ==In popular culture== The twentieth season of the American reality show The Amazing Race featured a task in which contestants had to perform the bottle dance while in Asunci√≥n. During the second season of Got Talent Espa√±a, one contestant, Bel√©n Torres, auditioned with a bottle dance performance that concluded with her dancing with a stack of five bottles.

According to Darrel Paproth, he \\"dominated evangelicalism in Melbourne between the wars.\\" ==Education and initial ministry== Nash was born in Brixton and educated at Oundle School, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and Ridley Hall. At Corpus Christ he became an evangelical Anglican and was particularly influenced by Brooke Foss Westcott.Paproth, Failure is Not Final, p. 18. Nash taught at the Loretto School before being ordained a priest in 1893. According to the Australian Dictionary of Biography, \\"two years later Nash's promising career was curtailed because it was alleged that while engaged to his vicar's daughter he had made advances to her younger sister.\\" He subsequently emigrated to Australia and worked in Tasmania for two years before resuming his ministry in Sydney. He was relicensed by Bishop Saumarez Smith and spent two years there before moving to Victoria in 1900. ==Controversy in Victoria== Nash was vicar of St. Columb's Anglican Church, Hawthorn, from 1900 to 1906. He was popular and successful, and appeared on his way to becoming a bishop: he was made canon of St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne in 1903, and in 1906 was on the short list to become the second Bishop of Bendigo.Paproth, Failure is Not Final, p. 216. He accepted the incumbency at Christ Church, Geelong in 1906, but the following year disaster struck: Nash was forced by Archbishop Lowther Clarke to resign due to another indiscretion with a female parishioner, this time at Hawthorn. Wei-Han Kuan notes, however, that \\"Nash's evangelical supporters were vocal, active, and sustained in support of him.\\" Paproth suggests the sour relationship between Nash and Clarke reflected the division in the diocese between evangelicals and non-evangelicals.Paproth, Failure is Not Final, p. 68. In 1908, Nash was relicensed by Bishop Arthur Pain of Gippsland and became rector of St Paul's, Sale, and archdeacon of Gippsland. In 1909 John Norton wrote a newspaper article attacking Clarke for his role in the affair, but the publicity from a subsequent libel case forced Nash to resign from the Anglican Church in 1912. (He was relicensed by Clarke's successor, Harrington Lees, in 1926.) ==Melbourne Bible Institute== Nash ran his own school (called Ashwick School) from 1913 to 1915, and pastored Prahran Independent Church (which belonged to the Congregational Union of Australia) from 1915 to 1920. He then started the Melbourne Bible Institute and remained principal there until his retirement in 1942. Nash also taught at the City Men's Bible Class, where he \\"gathered and energized an incredibly influential group of evangelical Melbourne businessmen.\\"Kuan, Foundations of Anglican Evangelicalism in Victoria, p. 191. This group included his close friend Lee Neil, who was \\"the prime mover behind the founding of MBI as a necessary institution for the training of overseas missionaries and as an appropriate avenue for the deployment of the exiled Nash's gifts.\\"Kuan, Foundations of Anglican Evangelicalism in Victoria, p. 219. ==Personal life== Nash married Louise Pearse in 1899 and had three sons and three daughters. ==Works== * Christ Interpreted (1940) * The Fourfold Interpretation of Jesus Christ (1946) ==References== Category:1866 births Category:1958 deaths Category:People from Brixton Category:English emigrants to colonial Australia Category:Seminary presidents Category:University and college founders Category:Anglican archdeacons in Australia Category:Evangelical Anglican clergy Category:People educated at Oundle School Category:Alumni of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge Category:Alumni of Ridley Hall, Cambridge ","title":"C.

The legislation established the concept of General Improvement Areas which could be declared in regions of derelict or run-down housing to allow for regeneration as opposed to demolition and slum clearance. The act raised the maximum amount available from improvement grants, from ¬£500 () to ¬£1200 () for each property conversion of three or more storys, or 20% less for any other types of improvement, although the amount was flexible at the discretion of local authorities. A previous condition that restricted owners from selling homes improved with grant funding was removed under the act, with no evidence suggesting that this had created any problems when reported in May 1970. Other previous restrictions, such as a proportion of a grant needing to be repaid if a house was sold for owner-occupation within three years was also removed in the act. The act made it difficult for local authorities to delay undertaking renewal actions and placed a duty upon them to review the conditions of housing in their districts, with grants available for aesthetic improvements such as to encourage tree planting. In reaction to the act, councils in cities including London, Glasgow and Leeds started to prepare proposals for regenerating run- down housing. Of particular note was Liverpool City Council's response to the act, which invited the housing charity Shelter to rehabilitate run-down housing in the Granby ward of Toxteth. At this time, just 17% of houses in the area where owner-occupied and many where privately owned and rented, often with multiple occupation. Under part III of the act, landlords were able to obtain a qualification certificate from the local authority for the purposes of obtaining a \\"fair rent\\" on properties improved sufficiently enough that they were fit for habitation and in good repair for their age. The act superseded the Housing Subsidies Act 1967, which provided housing associations a contribution towards the cost of acquiring homes to be improved. ==Operation== Pamphlets advising people how to modernise their home were distributed in the months following the act becoming legal, totaling 300,000 copies by November 1969. During the first three months of the act's operation, the value of grants paid for improvement and conversion to owners, associations and landlords was ¬£3.4M (), although this figure included grants approved under previous legislation. From September 1969 to February 1970, there was a 5,515 increase in grants approved in England and Wales compared to the same period 12 months prior, with an increase of 5,866 grants to private owners, although there were also 351 fewer grants to authorities. By March 1970, 28 authorities had declared general improvement areas that involved 31 different schemes, which had increased to 40 authorities declaring 49 improvement areas by May 1970. Around a year later in February 1971, 115 improvement areas had been declared in England and Wales by 87 local authorities. ==References== Citations Sources * ==External links== * UK Legislation - Housing Act 1969 * Housing Act 1969 - Chapter 33 Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1969 Category:Housing legislation in the United Kingdom ","title":"Housing Act 1969"},{"id":"63779521","text":"Blodwen DaviesSometimes spelt Blodin√©n (May 18, 1897 ‚Äì September 10, 1966) was a Canadian journalist, historian and travel writer. ==Biography== Davies was born in Montreal,Some biographies suggest Longueuil Quebec in 1897.

He played as midfielder. Vonthron first played for FC Concordia Basel. He joined Basel's first team during their 1940‚Äì41 season as they played in the 1. Liga und player-manager Eugen Rupf. He played his domestic league debut for his new club in the home game at the Landhof on 15 September 1940 as Basel won 3‚Äì1 against FC Birsfelden. He scored his first goal for his club on 4 May 1941 in the away game against exactly the same opponents in the last game of that season. Basel won the game 3‚Äì1 and this victory assured the team the qualification to the promotion play-offs. But in these play-offs Basel were defeated by Cantonal Neuchatel and drew the game with Z√ºrich. Their two play-off opponents were thus promoted and Basel remained for another season in the 1 Liga. The following year Basel started the 1941‚Äì42 league season well. Basel finished their season as winners of group East. The promotion play-offs were then against group West winners FC Bern. The 1st leg was the away tie, this ended with a goalless draw. Basel won the 2nd leg at home at the Landhof 3‚Äì1 to achieve Promotion. Vonthron played in nearly all of the league games and in all ten cup matches. Again FC Birsfelden turned out to be one of Vonthron's favourate opponents. In both the league match on 9 November as well as in the cup game on 7 December Vonthron was able to score a valuable goal. In the cup Basel advanced to the final, which ended goalless after extra time and a replay was required. This was held on 25 May 1942, in the Wankdorf Stadion, against the new Nationalliga champions Grasshoppers. Basel led by half time through two goals by Fritz Schmidlin, but two goals from Grubenmann a third from Neukom gave the Grasshoppers a 3‚Äì2 victory. Between the years 1940 and 1948 Vonthron played a total of 206 games for Basel scoring a total of 19 goals. 147 of these games were in the 1. Liga and Nationalliga, 35 in the Swiss Cup and 24 were friendly games. He scored 12 goals in the domestic league, five in the cup and the other two were scored during the test games. As was customary at that time, the players were amateurs and pursued a civil profession. Vonthron was a heating oil and coal merchant. ==References== ==Sources== * Rotblau: Jahrbuch Saison 2017/2018.

Her research investigates viral diseases and the use of RNA aptamers to study viral proteins. She has worked on the development of a novel poliovirus vaccine that makes use of virus-like particles. == Education == Stonehouse studied biology at the University of East Anglia, and graduated in 1983. She moved to the University of Leeds for her graduate studies, where she worked towards a doctorate in medicine, which she completed in 1992. == Research and career == After her PhD, Stonehouse was awarded a Medical Research Council (MRC) clinical fellowship, where she was the first to describe the crystal structure of an RNA aptamer‚Äìprotein complex. Her research investigates the factors that can inhibit replication, with a focus on viral polymerases. She has developed several virus-like particles that may be able to act as vaccinations for emerging diseases. These virus- like particles (capsids) cannot cause disease themselves, but can be used to elicit an immune response. Amongst these studies, Stonehouse used this technology to work toward a safer polio vaccine. Her research was supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and made use of the virus-like particle strategy to trick the body into developing immunity against poliovirus. Stonehouse used an empty protein shell, designed to look and behave like poliovirus, which could trigger the immune system. A synthetic vaccine can be safer than a traditional vaccine as there is no risk of accidentally releasing the virus, and does not require a biocontainment laboratory. As part of the lifecycle of poliovirus it produces empty unstable particles. On their own, these unstable particles would undergo an antigenic conversion to a non-native state. To precisely mimic the shell of the poliovirus, Stonehouse and co- workers studied the structure at the Diamond Light Source. Using a combination of electron microscopy and crystal structures, the team identified ways to stabilise this virus-like particle shell. She engineered the virus-like particles using yeast as a recombinant system. She has explored the viral genomes of various other viruses, including picornaviruses, noroviruses and coronaviruses. Noroviruses are a common cause of gastroenteritis, but there are no vaccines or specific antivirals. Stonehouse has investigated murine norovirus, the form of norovirus that affects mice, using cryogenic electron microscopy. Picornaviridae are a big family of positive-sense RNA viruses, and they contain several human and animal pathogens. In her investigations of foot-and-mouth disease, a sometimes fatal viral infection which is caused by a picornavirus, Stonehouse identified a small protein which is important in the viral replication. This small protein, 3B, is responsible for the efficient replication of foot-and-mouth disease, and demonstrates a significant level of genetic economy. In 2012 Stonehouse was award a research grant from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) to develop new generation vaccines to protect cattle, sheep, goats and pigs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Stonehouse provided regular commentary to the public on the status of coronavirus research. From the date of the first UK death coronavirus, Stonehouse emphasised that it was essential that the country improved its diagnostic capacity. She warned the public not to get too optimistic about a COVID-19 vaccine, as they can take \\"decades\\" to get to market. Stonehouse called for the Government of the United Kingdom to make it easier for universities and industrial labs to support testing efforts. She believes that an over-reliance on specific reagents made it difficult for testing centres to run at capacity. She has explained that the National Health Service procurement process makes it difficult to upscale any diagnostic efforts. === Selected publications === Her publications include: *Crystal structure of an RNA bacteriophage coat protein‚Äìoperator complex *The three- dimensional structures of two complexes between recombinant MS2 capsids and RNA operator fragments reveal sequence-specific protein-RNA interactions *A Simple, RNA-Mediated Allosteric Switch Controls the Pathway to Formation of a T=3 Viral Capsid ==Awards and honours== Stonehouse was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Biology (FRSB) in 2014. == References == Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Alumni of the University of East Anglia Category:Alumni of the University of Leeds Category:British virologists Category:British women biologists Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Biology Category:Women virologists ","title":"Nicola Stonehouse"},{"id":"63779710","text":"John C. Giraudo (October 2, 1923 ‚Äì June 17, 1996) was a highly decorated United States Air Force major general. He is one of just a few Americans to be shot down and captured as a prisoner of war on two occasions, first during World War II and again during the Korean War. == Early life and World War II == John Giraudo was born on October 2, 1923, in Santa Barbara, California. He was attending college in Santa Barbara when Pearl Harbor was attacked in December 1941. Giruado subsequently dropped out of college and enlisted into the United States Army Air Forces on March 25, 1942 and entered the Aviation Cadet Training Program. On March 10, 1943, Giraudo was commissioned as a second lieutenant and awarded his flying wings. Giraudo was assigned to the 720th Bombardment Squadron at Alamogordo Army Air Field, New Mexico, where he flew B-17 Flying Fortresses and B-24 Liberators. By late 1943, Giraudo was a squadron leader flying missions with the Fifteenth Air Force in the Mediterranean Theater. On February 25, 1944, Captain Giraudo was flying a B-24 on a bombing mission over Regensburg in Bavaria, Germany. Giraudo's aircraft was shot down and he was captured by German troops and taken to Stalag Luft I in Barth. He would spend more than one year as a prisoner of war, until the camp was liberated by Russian troops on April 30, 1945. == Post-World War II == After World War II, Giraudo became the assistant director of flying at Mather Air Force Base, California. While there, he helped establish the first triple-rated (pilot-navigator-bombardier) training course in the United States Air Force. Giraudo graduated from the Air Tactical School in 1947 and Instructor Pilot School in 1948 before he was attached to Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. He helped develop the first jet all-weather instrument flying program in the Lockheed T-33. Giraudo then flew F-80 Shooting Stars, F-89 Scorpions, and F-94 Starfires as part of the first all-weather jet interceptor program in the Air Force. In 1950, Giraudo from Aircraft Gunnery School at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. He was then attached to the staff of the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, while the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formed. == Korean War == In 1952, Major Giraudo volunteered to serve in Korea. Arriving at Suwon Air Base in November 1952, Giraudo was made the commanding officer of the 25th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing. Giraudo shot down two MiG-15s, and probably downed 1.5 more while flying an F-86 Sabre. While strafing enemy trucks during his 99th combat mission on June 16, 1953, Lieutenant Colonel Giraudo's aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire. Giraudo tried to nurse the F-86 to the sea, but he was forced to eject just one mile from the water. Giraudo landed near enemy troops and was successfully evading them when the life raft in his survival equipment unexpectedly inflated. He was shot through the shoulder and was captured by enemy troops for the second time. Giraudo's wingman, Marine Major John Glenn, circled over the area for a period of time while North Korean soldiers hid Giraudo from sight. Giraudo was taken to a prisoner of war camp, although neither his family nor the Air Force knew he had been taken prisoner and was alive. He was held until October 1953, when he was repatriated during Operation Big Switch. == Later career and life == After the war, Giraudo assumed command of the Aircraft Gunnery School, holding that position until May 1956 when he was assigned as the senior military advisor to the Hawaii Air National Guard. In 1959, he graduated from the Armed Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia. He was then assigned to The Pentagon until 1963. After graduating from the National War College in 1964, Giraudo was assigned to Wheelus Air Base, Libya. From 1965 to 1967, he was assigned to Spangdahlem Air Base in West Germany, eventually becoming the commanding officer of the 49th Tactical-Fighter Wing. In August 1967, Giraudo was assigned to Takhli Air Base in Thailand as the commander of the 355th Tactical-Fighter Wing. During the next 12 months, Giraudo flew 100 combat missions during the Vietnam War, including 77 over North Vietnam. Giraudo was promoted to major general in 1970, and took command of the Seventeenth Air Force in Germany from 1973 to 1975. He retired at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, on November 1, 1977. John C.

It is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium, which forms spores which can remain viable for at least thirty-five years. ==Morphology== P. larvae is a rod-shaped bacterium with slightly rounded ends, approximately 2.5‚Äì5 Œºm long and 0.5 Œºm wide. The spore of P. larvae is oval, approximately 0.6 Œºm wide and 1.3 Œºm long. ==Classification== In 1906, G.F. White first described the bacteria which caused American foulbrood, and named it Bacillus larvae. In 1950, a bacteria isolated from bee larvae and associated with the rare disease \\"powdery scale\\" was named Bacillus pulvifaciens by Katznelson. In 1993, both B. larvae and B. pulvifaciens were transferred to a new genus, Paenibacillus. The two species were combined into a single species: Paenibacillus larvae in 1996, remaining differentiated as two subspecies: P. larvae ssp. larvae (formerly Bacillus larvae) and P. larvae ssp. pulvifaciens (formerly Bacillus pulvifaciens). In 2006, the subspecies were eliminated based on spore morphology, biochemical profile and DNA testing, and when it was also demonstrated that experimental infection of honeybee larvae with the pulvifaciens subspecies caused American foulbrood signs without causing \\"powdery scale\\". There are four strains of P. larvae, named after their enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) sequences. Strains I and II correspond to the former species of Bacillus larvae, and strains III and IV correspond to the former species of B. pulvifaciens. ==Epidemiology== P. larvae is found worldwide. Strain ERIC I is found worldwide, whereas ERIC II is found only in Europe. Strains ERIC III and IV are found in bacteriology archives and are considered practically unimportant. ==American foulbrood== P. larvae causes American foulbrood in honeybees. The most virulent strain of P. larvae is ERIC II, which can cause the death of all larvae in a hive within 7 days of infecting the colony. ==References== Category:Paenibacillaceae ","title":"Paenibacillus larvae"},{"id":"63779853","text":"Sir William Francis Marwood, (1863‚Äì1935) was an English civil servant who served as Permanent secretary to the Board of Trade. == Life == Marwood was born in 1863 the son of George Marwood of Busby Hall in the North Riding of Yorkshire.

He first competed in the East Japan Amateur Shooto Freshman tournament, where he lost the finals. Following that loss he entered and won the 4th Tohoku Amateur Shooto Open Tournament. His last amateur appearance was at the 12th All Japan Amateur Shooto Featherweight Championship Tournament. Ougikubo defeated all four of his opponents to win the tournament.

In the semifinals he submitted Kana Hyatt in the first round.

He won the fight in the last seconds of the fifth round by a guillotine choke. ===The Ultimate Fighter=== Considered a standout fighter in the Asian MMA scene, with an impressive fight style and being undefeated in three years, Ougikubo was invited to the 24th season of The Ultimate Fighter, called The Ultimate Fighter: Tournament of Champions. His first fight was against the EFC flyweight champion Nkazimulo Zulu. Ougikubo entered the fight as a favorite, being the no.5 seed, while Zulu was the no.12 seed.

Ougikubo would then face the no.1 seed Alexandre Pantoja. He would force wrestling exchanges with Pantoja, working from his opponents guard, grinding away a unanimous decision win. In his final fight of the show, Ougikubo fought against Tim Elliott. He fell short for the first time, and lost the finals by a unanimous decision. ===Return to Shooto=== Returning to Shooto he fought against the Ultimate Fighting Championship veteran Danny Martinez. Ougikubo won a unanimous decision. He would then defend the Shooto World Bantamweight (123 lb) Championship against Tadaaki Yamamoto. He won the fight with a rear naked choke to defend his Shooto title. ===Rizin Fighting Federation=== Ougikubo signed with Rizin and made his debut at Rizin 11, when he was scheduled to rematch Kyoji Horiguchi. Horiguchi once again won, this time through a unanimous decision. Ougikubo fought the former Shooto and ONE Championship champion Yoshitaka Naito in a Shooto exhibition bout. The fight ended in a no contest after just three minutes. Making his second bantamweight title defense, Ougikubo faced Kiyotaka Shimizu. While the fight saw little action in the first three rounds, Ougikubo managed to cut his opponent with a head kick. In the fourth round a head clash ended the fight prematurely and went to the judge's scorecards. Hiromasa won a unanimous decision to secure his second title defense. Returning to Rizin, he fought against the former DEEP champion Yuki Motoya. Ougikubo won a split decision. During Rizin 20, he fought against Shintaro Ishiwatari. He won another split decision.

The character was created by writer Norman Danberg and artist Will Harr, although another creative team, writer Joe Blair and artist Ed Smalle, produced most of his adventures. Rang-a-Tang is a circus-trained German shepherd who solves crimes at a movie studio in Hollywood, California, with the help of detective Hy Speed and former child actor Richy the Amazing Boy. The unusually intelligent dog, described as having an \\"almost-human brain\\", can understand human speech, including the person's tone of voice and moral character. He was inspired by the famous canine silent film star Rin Tin Tin, a real-life German Shepherd considered intelligent and talented. When Rang-a-Tang reaches Hollywood in issue #5, his stories feature thinly-disguised caricatures of 1940s film stars, including Nawson Swelles, Tana Lurner, Stark Brable and Harly Shaplyn. Rang-a-Tang was the first cover star of Blue Ribbon Comics and therefore the first in Archie Comics' long history, premiering in issue #1 (Nov 1939) and running through the end of the title, issue #22 (March 1942). Starting with issue #4, Blue Ribbon offered membership in the Rang-a-Tang Club for ten cents, as well as the Rang-a-Tang Honor Legion for young readers who performed an exceptional deed in the service of animalkind. ==History== \\"Rang-a-Tang the Wonder Dog\\" was introduced in Blue Ribbon Comics #1 (Nov 1939) in a story by Norman Danberg and Will Harr, who worked for comic book packager Harry \\"A\\" Chesler's studio. \\"Running away from a cruel dog trainer with a small time carnival,\\" the opening narration explains, \\"Rang-a-Tang shifts for himself.\\" Wandering the streets, Rang happens upon two hit men who have been paid to kill a detective. The dog, \\"trained to understand the human voice,\\" immediately recognizes that the pair are bad people, and he saves the intended victim by jumping on the gunmen. Grateful, detective Hy Speed instantly recognizes the dog's sterling qualities and takes him along on his stakeout outside the hideout of gangster Blackie Blade, who's kidnapped a young woman. Rang-a-Tang doesn't speak, but his mental state is described by the narrator; when Hy hatches a complex plan to save the girl, the narrator explains, \\"Rang understood very well. He knew the girl must be out of the building before Blackie and his men could be attacked.\\" When the case is solved, Hy tells Rang that he's now an official member of the police force. Disappointed with the first few issues of Blue Ribbon Comics, which also introduced superhero Bob Phantom, the publishers took a six-month break between issues #3 and 4, during which they hired various staff members away from the Chesler studio to form their own in-house bullpen. When issue #4 was published in June 1940, Rang-a- Tang had a new focus, thanks to Joe Blair and Ed Smalle, making an abrupt move away from the original urban crime adventure premise. In the book, Rang-a- Tang's heroics have earned him a \\"nation-wide reputation as the Wonder Dog\\", and he's invited with his master to come to Hollywood and become a film star for Mammoth Pictures. Issue #4 also introduced the Rang-a-Tang Club, which was promoted with a two-page ad in every issue. Membership in the club cost ten cents, and members received a membership card and a Rang-a-Tang pinback button, as well as the advice and counsel of the club's veterinarian, who corresponded by letter with members who had questions about dog care. Members could also qualify for the Rang-a-Tang Honor Legion by writing a letter \\"relating an exceptional deed you performed involving kindness or courage toward any animal, be it dog, cat, horse, bird or wild life.\\" Honorees were listed on the club page with excerpts of their letters, and received an engraved Rang-a-Tang Honor Legion diploma signed by Joe Blair, Ed Smalle and the club's veterinarian. In issue #5 (July 1940), Rang-a-Tang and Hy Speed arrive at the Mammoth Pictures studio, which is troubled because of mysterious accidents on the set of \\"boy wonder\\" Nawson Swelles' latest epic. The dog saves one starlet from a runaway horse and another from an uncaged lion, and finally deduces that Swelles himself is responsible for sabotaging the film. He indicates this to his partner by putting on a beret, glasses and pipe in imitation of Swelles, and the pair chase the villainous director up some scaffolding and make him fall to his death. Grateful, Mr. Wyngold offers the dog a film contract. Issue #6 (Sept 1940) introduced the series' third regular cast member ‚Äî Richy Waters, a former child star known as Richy the Amazing Boy. Richy assists Rang and Hy with apprehending a gang of Bundonians threatening director Harly Shaplyn, and the trio become inseparable from then on. Unfortunately for Rang-a-Tang, the coming vogue in comic books was superheroes, and by issue #9, he was pushed off the cover in favor of MLJ's new caped sensations, Mr. Justice and Captain Flag. Rang's adventures continued to appear as the second feature for the rest of the comic's run. In the last six months of the strip, the trio start to drift away from Hollywood to seek adventure elsewhere, including a circus, a racecourse and Washington, D.C., tracking down kidnappers, murderers and fraudulent spiritualists. In his final adventure in issue #22, Rang-a-Tang gets lost in the North Woods and has to kill and eat a bear. ==References== Category:Golden Age adventure heroes Category:Archie Comics superheroes Category:Comics characters introduced in 1939 Category:Fictional dogs ","title":"Rang-a-Tang the Wonder Dog"},{"id":"63780127","text":"The 1974 Iowa State Senate elections took place as part of the biennial 1974 United States elections.

Its five volumes were published beginning in 1958. ==Overview== In the Preface to Volume I, Maj. Gen. E.W. Snedeker, the Marine Corps Assistant Chief of Staff, wrote, \\"By publishing this operational history in a durable form, it is hoped to make the Marine Corps record permanently available for the study of military personnel, the edification of the general public, and the contemplation of serious scholars of military history.\\"Vol. I, p. v Much of the content of the series was derived from 15 historical monographs describing individual campaigns which were prepared soon after the end of World War II. Some of the monographs were expanded by their original authors for inclusion in the current works, while other authors expanded the rest and wrote original material. Japanese sources which had not been available earlier were consulted. In addition to the main text, each volume includes photographs, appendices, and maps. The appendices contain a chronology, orders of battle, statistics, and guides to military map symbols and abbreviations. Small maps are included within the text and larger ones fold out from inside the back cover. ==Synopses== *Volume I: Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal (1958) by Lt. Col. Frank O. Hough, USMCR; Maj. Verle E. Ludwig, USMC; and Henry I. Shaw, Jr. \\"This book covers Marine Corps participation through the first precarious years of World War II, when disaster piled on disaster and there seemed no way to check Japanese aggression.\\" It begins with an overview of the Corps' development of its amphibious warfare doctrine and landing craft, the Corps' expansion beginning in 1940, and the replacement of British forces in Iceland in July 1941. Further sections describe Marine Corps actions during the Pearl Harbor attack, the defense of Wake Island, the loss of the Philippines, the battle of Midway, and the struggle for Guadalcanal. *Volume II: Isolation of Rabaul (1963) by Henry I. Shaw, Jr. and Maj. Douglas T. Kane, USMC This volume describes the series of campaigns during which the Allied forces moved north and west along the Solomon Islands chain from Guadalcanal to Bougainville Island and leapt west to New Britain island in the Bismarck Archipelago. An earlier intention to recapture Rabaul was replaced by a plan to reduce that Japanese base solely by air action, and the last section of this volume describes the Marines' contribution to that isolation. *Volume III: Central Pacific Drive (1966) by Henry I. Shaw, Jr., Bernard C. Nalty, and Edwin T. Turnbladh This volume opens with a review of early plans for a war against Japan and how they evolved into the strategy eventually followed in the \\"island hopping\\" central Pacific Ocean campaigns. It continues with the battles to secure Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands; the islands of Roi-Namur, Kwajalein, Engebi, and Eniwetok in the Marshalls; and Saipan, Tinian, and Guam in the Mariana Islands. *Volume IV: Western Pacific Operations (1971) by George W. Garand and Truman R. Strobridge Volume IV opens with the development of the Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, which began in the 1920s, and describes the gradual inclusion of aviation in the Corps' structure. It continues with sections describing the bitter fight for Peleliu, the Marines' contribution to the primarily Army campaign to recapture the Philippines, and the iconic battle for Iwo Jima. A separate section describes Marine aviation during the campaigns for the Marianas, Carolines, and Iwo Jima. *Volume V: Victory and Occupation (1968) by Benis M. Frank and Henry I. Shaw, Jr. Half of this volume is devoted to the final campaign of World War II, the invasion and capture of Okinawa. Most of the balance describes plans for the invasion of Japan, the occupation of Japan after its surrender, and the little-known, and futile, efforts to mediate between the Kuomintang and Mao Zedong's Communist forces. It concludes with a retrospective on amphibious warfare and a summary chapter called \\"A Final Accounting\\". ==Publication history== Volumes I, II, III, and V were published by the Historical Branch, G-3 Division, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps.

He was a member of the town council of Vienna, Virginia for 21 years, and a member of the Virginia House of Delegates for 1 year. He was the first African American member of the Virginia General Assembly elected in Northern Virginia since Reconstruction. ==Education and military career== Lovelace graduated from Lincoln University in 1958 with a bachelor's degree in physics. He then served in the US Army's Signal Corps until his retirement in 1979 at the rank of Lieutenant colonel. Additionally, Lovelace received a master's degree from George Washington University. ==Political career== Lovelace was first elected to the Vienna, Virginia town council in 1982, serving until 1996. In November 1996, incumbent state delegate Richard L. Fisher resigned mid-term, triggering a December special election. Lovelace was the Democratic nominee for the remainder of the term, facing Republican Mike Polychrones, a former legislative aide to Fisher. Lovelace prevailed by a 51% to 45% margin. In the 1997 general election, Lovelace was defeated by Republican candidate Jeannemarie Devolites by a 51% to 47% margin. Lovelace ran for the seat again in the 1999 election and was defeated again. From 2003 to 2010 Lovelace again served on the Vienna town council. Lovelace was also an at large board member of the Fairfax County Park Authority from 2004 onwards. In 2006 Lovelace unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Vienna mayor M. Jane Seeman.

Orth author, United States Government Printing Office (1967), page 860. It is the third-highest peak in the Hayes Range, a subset of the Alaska Range. This remote peak is situated east-southeast of Mount Hayes, and southeast of Fairbanks. Mount Moffit, the nearest higher neighbor, is set to the northeast, and McGinnis Peak is positioned to the east. This rarely climbed mountain has three large sweeping faces, the East, West, and South. This mountain is named for William Shand Jr. (1918‚Äì1946), a mountaineer who made the first ascents of nearby Mount Moffit in August 1942, and Mount Hayes on August 1, 1941. Following Shand's untimely death in a tragic car crash, Bradford Washburn, also of the Hayes first ascent party, proposed this name in 1949 to be applied to what is now called Mount Moffit. The present application of the name was suggested in 1961 by the U.S. Geological Survey to resolve the conflict of two names applied to the same geographic feature. The name and summit location was officially adopted in 1962 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. ==Climate== Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Shand is located in a subarctic climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. This climate supports the Trident and Black Rapids Glaciers surrounding this peak. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months May through June offer the most favorable weather for climbing or viewing. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Tanana River drainage basin. ==See also== *List of mountain peaks of Alaska *Geology of Alaska ==References== ==Gallery== File:Shand, Moffit, McGinnis.jpgMt.

Sharpe, 470 U.S. 675 (1985), was an important decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court explained how long police are permitted to stop vehicles as part of an investigatory stop before violating the Fourth Amendment. A seven-member majority of the Court determined the twenty minute stop in this case was legal, so the government won. However, the Court declined to adopt a bright line rule, deciding instead that \\"common sense and ordinary human experience must govern over rigid criteria.\\" . The Court announced that the rule for determining whether a detention is too long will depend on whether the police \\"diligently pursued\\" an investigation to quickly confirm or dispel their suspicions. The Court clarified that judges should avoid \\"unrealistic second-guessing\\" of police and should take into account \\"swiftly developing situation[s].\\" Sharpe has been frequently cited, and is the framework used to challenge unduly prolonged police stops in thousands of criminal cases. == Background == Agent Cooke was a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent, patrolling a coastal road near Sunset Beach, North Carolina on the morning of June 9, 1978. At 6:30 AM, he spotted a Pontiac Bonneville and a pickup truck with a camper attached driving in tandem on the highway. Sharpe was driving the Pontiac, and a man named Savage was driving the pickup truck. Agent Cooke noticed that the truck was riding low in the rear, and the camper did not bounce or sway when the truck maneuvered over bumps and around curves. So, Agent Cooke suspected the camper was heavily loaded. Agent Cooke also noticed a quilted material covered the rear and side windows of the camper. With suspicions aroused, Agent Cooke followed the two vehicles for twenty miles. Agent Cooke chose to make an investigative stop and radioed the State Highway Patrol for assistance. Together, the two officers attempted to stop both vehicles. Both vehicles turned onto a campground road, exceeding the speed limit by twenty to twenty-five miles. Agent Cooke pulled over Sharpe in his Pontiac, but as he did so, Savage - while driving the pickup truck - nearly collided with the state highway patrol officer and continued down the highway with the camper in tow. The highway patrol officer continued pursuing Savage in the pickup truck while Agent Cooke approached Sharpe in the Pontiac. === Actions During the Stop === Agent Cooke asked Sharpe for identification then radioed the highway patrolman to determine if he had successfully stopped the pickup truck. However, the patrolman was not in the patrol car, so it took several minutes to confirm. Agent Cooke radioed the local police for assistance, and two officers from the Myrtle Beach Police Department arrived about 10 minutes later. Agent Cooke asked the Myrtle Beach PD to maintain the situation, then left to join the highway patrol officer who had successfully stopped the pickup truck one-half mile down the road. Agent Cooke arrived at the pickup truck about 15 minutes after it had been stopped. Agent Cooke twice asked for permission to search the camper, but Savage declined. Agent Cooke, however confirmed that the camper was overloaded with weight and smelled marijuana when he put his nose against the rear window. Based on this, Agent Cooke opened the trailer and observed large bales of marijuana in the camper. At this point, Agent Cooke arrested Savage. From the time Agent Cooke initially stopped the vehicles until the arrest of Savage, twenty minutes had passed. === Aftermath === Agent Cooke returned to the Pontiac and arrested Sharpe 30-40 minutes after the initial stop. That evening, other DEA agents took the truck to a federal building in South Carolina. Several days later, Agent Cooke supervised the unloading of 2,629 pounds of marijuana. Sharpe and Savage were charged with possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute it in violation of 21 U.S.C. Section 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. Section 2. === Legal Issue === The key issue the Supreme Court had to decide was whether the stop was unduly prolonged before the police had probable cause to arrest Savage. Specifically, the Supreme Court had to decide whether the twenty minutes that passed from the time Savage was pulled over until the moment Agent Cooke smelled the marijuana was an unjustified amount of time for the police to stop someone without probable cause of a crime. == Decision == On March 20, 1985 the Supreme Court issued a 7-2 decision in favor of the United States that reversed the judgement of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and reinstated the convictions of Savage and Sharpe. Chief Justice Burger delivered the opinion of the Court. === Opinion of the Court ===  Precedent and Legal Context  The Court noted at the onset that it need not decide whether Agent Cooke had reasonable articulable suspicion to initiate the traffic stop. The Court of Appeals had assumed that portion of the analysis, and the Court noted that assumption was \\"abundantly supported by the record.\\" Next, the Court set aside the 30 - 40 minute detention of Sharpe as irrelevant to the legal analysis. That was because the Defendants were trying to suppress the discovery of the marijuana, but the marijuana was discovered as part of Savage's detention not Sharpe's detention. Therefore, it was only the 20 minute detention of Savage that was legally relevant to the Court. The Court primarily discussed four cases as precedent for its decision: Terry v. Ohio,. Dunaway v. New York,. Florida v. Royer, . and United States v. Place.. Terry v. Ohio was the foundational case that established the doctrine of \\"Terry Stops.\\" Terry was relevant here because the case requires that any police investigatory stop be \\"reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\\" It's from this requirement in Terry, that a stop can be unreasonably delayed by exceeding the scope that justified the stop in the first place. The Court distinguished Dunaway and Royer because those were cases where the police, without probable cause for arrest, took suspects to police stations or to small rooms for questioning. The Court decided this vehicle stop was legally distinct. In Place, however, a 90 minute seizure of a suspects luggage was deemed unreasonably long in the absence of probable cause. But, the Supreme Court focused on language in the Place decision that stated the analysis was partly about \\"whether the police diligently pursue their investigation.\\"  Rule and Analysis  The Supreme Court stated it would not draw a \\"bright line\\" rule but instead would rely on \\"common sense and ordinary human experience\\" instead over \\"rigid criteria.\\" Specifically, the Court stated that: > \\"In assessing whether a detention is too long in duration to be justified as > an investigative stop, we consider it appropriate to examine whether the > police diligently pursued a means of investigation that was likely to > confirm or dispel their suspicions quickly, during which time it was > necessary to detain the defendant.\\" The Supreme Court stated that courts conducting this analysis \\"should take care to consider whether the police are acting in a swiftly developing situation\\" and courts \\"should not indulge in unrealistic second-guessing.\\" They added this caution out of a concern for creative judges engaging in post hoc evaluation of police conduct who could always imagine some alternative means by which the police could have conducted the investigation in hindsight. But, the Supreme Court clarified that the question is not simply whether some alternative investigation decision was available, but instead \\"whether the police acted unreasonably in failing to recognize or to pursue it. The Supreme Court rejected the argument that a 20-minute stop is automatically unreasonable when the police were diligent and when a suspect's actions contribute to the added delay. Quoting Place, the Court noted that police officers are permitted to \\"graduate [their] response to the demands of particular situation[s].\\"  Applied to the Case  Given the circumstances facing him, the Supreme Court determined Agent Cooke pursued his investigation in a \\"diligent and reasonable manner.\\" During most of the 20-minute detention of Savage, Agent Cooke was trying to contact the highway patrol officer and trying to enlist help of local police to guard Sharpe while Agent Cooke left to pursue Savage and the pickup truck. Once Agent Cooke reached Savage, the Court concluded he proceeded expeditiously because, within a few minutes, he examined Savage's driver's license, examined the truck bill of sale, requested permission to search the truck, stepped on the rear bumper (confirming his suspicion the truck was overloaded), then smelled the marijuana. The Court noted that the Defendants were not able to provide any evidence the officers were dilatory or unnecessary delayed the investigation. And, the Court noted that the delay in the case was attributable \\"almost entirely to the evasive actions of Savage\\" when he sought to elude police, resulting in the one-half mile gap between the two vehicles. === Justice Blackmun Concurrence === Justice Blackmun wrote separately, stating he would have remanded the case back to the Court of Appeals to dismiss the Defendants' argument because the Defendants failed to surrender to state authorities. Thus, as fugitives from justice, the appeal should have been dismissed. He cited Molinaro v. New Jersey,. as support for this reasoning. Yet, because the Court did not follow that path and instead chose to decide the case on the merits, Justice Blackmun joined the majority opinion. === Justice Marshall Concurrence === Justice Marshall joined only the result of the case. He joined because the evasive actions of Savage turned \\"what otherwise would have been a permissibly brief Terry stop into the prolonged encounter now at issue.\\" Justice Marshall, however, wrote separately to emphasize the importance of Terry's brevity requirement to the constitutionality of Terry stops. Justice Marshall went on to describe the history of Terry v. Ohio, emphasizing that the underlying rationale of Terry only applied to stops that were \\"substantially less intrusive than arrests.\\" Justice Marshall worried about \\"those who rank zealous law enforcement above all other values\\" abusing the Terry doctrine and using it to justify intrusive behavior. Justice Marshall proposed a test for Terry stops where the \\"critical threshold issue is the intrusiveness of the seizure\\" regardless of how efficient it may be for law enforcement based on the circumstances. Justice Marshall wrote it was important to divorce the \\"brevity requirement\\" from law enforcement needs, concerned that law enforcement needs could always justify increasing long stops. Justice Marshall wrote about the difficulty of judging the brevity requirement \\"by a stopwatch\\", but was uncomfortable with the Court's open- ended approach, believing that 20 minutes was too long. Justice Marshall also did not agree with the Court's decision to decide there was sufficient reasonable articulable suspicion. Justice Marshall thought the majority was \\"so anxious to address an unpresented issue that it blithely hurdle[d] over the jurisdictional and jurisprudential principles that out to stand in its way\\". Justice Marshall did not explicitly state whether he thought there was reasonable articulable suspicion, but he disagreed with the Court's decision to assume it without the issue being properly presented and briefed. === Justice Brennan Dissent === Justice Brennan noted that he had written separately in three of the Court's previous cases involving Terry stops and was much more skeptical on the scope and duration allowed by the Court in its recent cases. He also criticized the Court for choosing this case to expand the Terry doctrine, because he believed, if the majority's description of Savage's evasive maneuvers was accurate, Savage's evasive maneuvers were enough for probable cause the moment he nearly collided with the patrol car. But, at the same time, Justice Brennan criticized the Court's factual finding that Savage actually attempted to elude the police. On his reading of the facts, Justice Brennan noted that other innocent explanations could account for Savage's vehicle maneuvers and ultimately concluded that Savage had not actually attempted to evade. Justice Brennan also was more willing to question the diligence of the police on the scene. Justice Brennan pointed out that the government provided no explanation why the highway patrolman could not have investigated Savage without needing to wait for Agent Cooke. Justice Brennan also thought that the \\"poor coordination\\" between the DEA, local police, and state police should not excuse delays in the investigation. Justice Brennan did not think it should be part of the Constitution's \\"reasonableness\\" analysis for an officer to lengthen a detention while waiting for the arrival of an officer with more training and experience, believing that the exception could excuse too much misbehavior. === Justice Stevens Dissent === Justice Stevens, like Justice Blackmun, thought that the Defendants status as \\"fugitives\\" who attempted to escape law enforcement should be the central analysis of the case. Justice Stevens thought the procedural question about escaped persons was the more important legal issue that needed to be resolved, especially because escapes by persons engaged in smuggling narcotics was not uncommon. Justice Stevens thought the Defendants' attempt to escape should have mooted the appeal, therefore making it unnecessary for the Supreme Court to even decide the constitutional question. == Effect and Legacy == United States v. Sharpe has been cited by thousands of cases, and is part of the legal analysis in almost any investigative stop. However, the Terry doctrine broadly has continued to expand after the Sharpe decision, drawing some criticism. A Terry stop is the legal justification for police tactics like \\"stop and frisk\\", the application of which has been controversial to some. Sharpe specifically focused on the length of Terry stops, whereas much of the controversy focuses on other parts of the Terry framework, like use of force and legality of certain \\"frisk\\" tactics. David Moran has criticized the legal framework of traffic violation stops, the broader analysis that Sharpe contributes to. He suggests the entire analogy of routine traffic violations to Terry stops is unnecessarily confusing and the Court should instead adopt a new category of \\"non-custodial arrests.\\" This, Moran argues, will lessen the centrality of the ambiguous time during which police only have authority to detain for a petty offense but nonetheless keep suspects detained. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1985 in United States case law Category:United States Fourth Amendment case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Burger Court Category:Brunswick County, North Carolina Category:Drug Enforcement Administration litigation ","title":"United States v.

During the First World War he served as a captain in the machine gun corps and as an assistant secretary to the Supreme War Council.'High Court of Justice', The Times (14 July 1926), p. 5. His 1921 book, At the Supreme War Council, detailed his experiences as an interpreter at the Supreme War Council. His 1924 work, The Shirt, was a collection of essays and stories. On 11 June 1925 his Portraits and Criticisms was published.‚ÄòThe Gladstone Case‚Äô, The Times (4 February 1927), p. 14. This was a collection of character sketches which included H. H. Asquith, Margot Asquith and Lord Robert Cecil. In the essay on Cecil, Wright said of William Ewart Gladstone: \\"Gladstone...founded the great tradition since observed by many of his followers and successors with such pious fidelity, in public to speak the language of the highest and strictest principle, and in private to pursue and possess every sort of woman\\".Peter Wright, Portraits and Criticisms (London: Eveleigh Nash & Grayson, 1925), p. 152.John Gardiner, The Victorians: An Age in Retrospect (London: Hambledon Continuum, 2007), p. 193.M.

Gladstone's two surviving sons, Herbert and Henry Gladstone, wrote to Wright on 22 July 1925: \\"Your garbage about Mr. Gladstone in Portraits and Criticisms has come to our knowledge. You are a liar. Because you slander a dead man, you are a coward. Because you think that the public will accept invention from such as you, you are a fool\\". In a letter to Herbert Gladstone, the publishers (Eveleigh Nash and Grayson) claimed that the offending passage was inserted by Wright in the proof stage of printing.‚ÄòMr. Gladstone's Character‚Äô, The Times (28 July 1925), p. 16. The Gladstones sent a copy of their letter to Wright to The Nation and Wright replied with a letter to the Daily Mail. On 27 July Herbert Gladstone complained to the Bath Club that Wright (\\"a liar, a coward, and a foul fellow\\") had written letters on the controversy to The Nation on Club notepaper, which led to Wright's expulsion (Wright had replied to an earlier criticism of the book in a letter to The Nation). Wright subsequently sued the Club for damages and Herbert Gladstone for libel for his 27 July letter.Gardiner, pp. 193‚Äì94. After the trial, which lasted from 27 January to 3 February 1927, Wright was awarded ¬£125 in damages from the Club for wrongful expulsion but he lost the libel case.Gardiner, p. 194. The jury explained that \\"the gist of the defendant's letter of July 27 was true\\" and added that they were \\"of the unanimous opinion that the evidence which has been placed before us has completely vindicated the high moral character of the late Mr. W.

While at Ohio State University, Vaughn saw a job notice on a bulletin board with details about a position opening at one of Anheuser-Busch's breweries.

Shock Top is a Belgian-Style wheat ale, which was originally created in 2006 as a seasonal brew under the name Spring Heat Spiced Wheat. She developed both Shock Top and Straw-Ber-Rita with Rebecca Bennett. Her work releasing new beer brands was time intensive, a process she said took anywhere from six to 18 months from idea to finished product.

The nearby communities of Sheepshead Bay, Manhattan Beach, and Brighton Beach were settled after World War II by a large Jewish population, many of whom were immigrants and survivors of the Holocaust. The Memorial Park is the only public Holocaust memorial park in New York City. It is a New York City-owned park maintained by the Parks Department. The Brooklyn-based non-profit organization ‚ÄúThe Holocaust Memorial Committee‚Äù has control over the park's markers. ==History== The Park was first designated as a Holocaust Memorial Park in 1985 by then- Mayor Edward I. Koch. It originally consisted of a grove of established London plane trees and a seating area. After a planning process led by local non- profit organization, The Holocaust Memorial Committee, Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden allocated $933,000 toward the construction of a permanent memorial designed and built by the City. Construction of this memorial began in 1994 and it was dedicated on June 22, 1997, by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani Howard Golden, Abraham Foxman, National Director of the Anti- Defamation League and a Holocaust survivor, and other officials. ==Design features== The memorial designed by landscape architect George Vellonakis consists of a 14 1/2-foot tower sculpture of granite and exposed steel with a bronze ‚ÄúEternal Flame‚Äù on top. The word ‚ÄúRemember‚Äù encircles the top of the tower. The tower stands on three circular pedestals of granite, bearing the names of the countries where people were persecuted during the Holocaust. A twenty-one-foot granite slab extending is inscribed with a brief history of the Holocaust. At the end of the slab is inscribed: The tower is bordered on both sides with two crushed gravel surface gardens of 234 granite markers, inscribed with names, places, and historical events related to the Holocaust. These are intended to evoke tombstones with broken edges to represent the shattered lives of Holocaust survivors. Each is different in form and size, to recall the diversity of those persecuted by the Nazis. Members of the public can have the names of friends or family members lost during the Holocaust inscribed on one of the adjacent historical markers for $360 donation to the Holocaust Memorial Committee. Donors are asked to provide the victim's name and a brief history of his or her Holocaust experience. The committee then meets to verify the authenticity of the proposed inscription. Thousands of names have already been inscribed on the granite markers. Among the granite markers are markers for places like Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen, Belzec, Buchenwald, Babi Yar, Mauthausen, Dachau concentration camp, Treblinka, Sobibor, Theresienstadt, Majdanek and more. For events and facts like the Wannsee Conference, the Death marches, the Nuremberg Laws, the Evian Conference, Kristallnacht, the Warsaw Uprising and more.

McGrady is a Gamilaraay woman, who started taking photos of her family and surroundings as a teenager with a camera her mother bought her. Her fascination with photo journalism was sparked by black and white photographs of black sports men and women in magazines like Time Magazine and Life Magazine, the National Geographic, Esquire and Readers Digest. McGrady has been photographing political and social events of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and families of the Redfern, Surry Hills and Waterloo communities for 30 years from her perspective as a Gamilaraay woman. McGrady comes from the north-west of NSW and Southern Queensland. McGrady is a survivor who has lived in two worlds, black and white.

Among the famous people McGrady has photographed are prominent activist for Australia's First Nations People, Gary Foley, a human rights activist, and historian at the University of Victoria.

Her works include iconic images of Adam Goodes with Louis Jetta and Lance (Buddy) Franklin and the indigenous round football trophy, world champion Aboriginal boxer Anthony \\"Choc\\" Mundine, the Koori Knockout Carnival (one of the biggest Indigenous gatherings in Australia) and the Sista Girls of the Sydney Mardi Gras.

In 1894 this was expanded to the Otago School of Art and Design which Hutton was the principal of until he died in 1910. He was known for his wash drawings and water colours.

Other members of the Hutton family who taught at the school included David Edward Hutton and Lorne de H. Hutton (died in action in 1918). Hutton's artistic style was regarded as being more related to the style of Italian painter G. P. Nerli, who visited the school, than that of her father. Misses L. & A.

She was first elected to the South Taranaki District Council in the 2007 local elections, representing the PƒÅtea ward, having also unsuccessfully contested the mayoralty. However, new mayor Ross Dunlop named her as his deputy mayor. She held that role until 2010, when she did not seek re-election and was replaced by Alex Ballantyne. == MƒÅori Party == Ngarewa- Packer was elected co-leader of the MƒÅori Party in April 2020, along with John Tamihere. Both ran uncontested. She had previously been selected to be the MƒÅori Party's candidate for the Te Tai HauƒÅuru electorate for the 2020 election in October 2019, and was the first electoral candidate announced by the party for that election. Ngarewa-Packer and Tamihere are the first party leaders elected since the MƒÅori Party lost its parliament seats in the 2017 election, after which its previous leaders stepped down. Ngarewa-Packer has the party's number one list position for the 2020 election. Ngarewa-Packer was generally considered to be the MƒÅori Party's best chance at returning to Parliament; with polls showing the party below the 5 percent threshold, it would need to win at least one electorate seat to enter. However, a poll released in late September 2020 showed that Labour's candidate for Te Tai HauƒÅuru, Adrian Rurawhe, as having greater support than Ngarewa-Packer, though there was a large number of undecided voters in the poll. In response to the poll, Ngarewa-Packer said she was buoyed by the number of undecided voters and called the electorate ‚Äúwinnable‚Äù. At the 2020 election, she was unable to unseat Rurawhe as MP for Te Tai HauƒÅuru, coming close but falling short of Rurawhe's 9,431 votes by a margin of 1,121https://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electorate-details-69.html. Although she did not win Te Tai HauƒÅuru, her fellow Maori party candidate Rawiri Waititi successfully unseated Labour MP Tamati Coffey in the Waiariki Maori electorate, allowing the party to enter parliament. Although as of preliminary results Waititi remains the Maori party's only MP, if the party is able to raise their party vote by approximately 0.2 percent once special votes are counted, she will enter parliament as a List MP due to her placement on the Maori Party list, giving the party a caucus of two MPs. Since John Tamihere did not enter parliament, Waititi replaced him, joining Ngarewa-Packer as co- leader of the party. == NgƒÅti Ruanui and local activism == Ngarewa-Packer is chief executive of the NgƒÅti Ruanui iwi. She is also kaiarataki of Te R≈´nanga o NgƒÅti Ruanui, which runs healthcare centres in HƒÅwera and PƒÅtea. Ngarewa- Packer has been advocating for MƒÅori health and the environment at a grassroots level for many years. She has campaigned against iron sands mining off the Taranaki coast. In April 2020, the Court of Appeal found that the Environmental Protection Authority's decision in 2017 to grant a marine discharge consent to a mining company was not consistent with the law to protect the environment from harmful substances. However, the company behind the plan is seeking leave from the Supreme Court to appeal. On the appeal, Ngarewa-Packer said \\"We‚Äôre annoyed that we may have to go to court for a fourth time as right now our efforts are focused on protecting our community from Covid-19. But we are undeterred in our resolve and we will oppose TTR‚Äôs application for yet another appeal.\\" In 2004, she rallied more than 250 Taranaki people to join with the foreshore and seabed hikoi on its way to Wellington. In 2011, she joined a 10-member independent panel set up by the Government to identify ways to raise the rate of return on Maori-owned assets, and grow Maori contribution to New Zealand's economy. Regarding the Covid-19 response, The Spinoff described Ngarewa-Packer as \\"a key voice in the Covid-19 iwi response, not only in analysing and mitigating risks in her own rohe, but in keeping applied pressure on local and central government to include MƒÅori in their risk assessment.\\" == Personal == Ngarewa-Packer is of NgƒÅti Ruahine, NgƒÅruahine, and NgƒÅ Rauru iwi. She is a descendant of Tutange Waionui of Ngati Ruanui, who fought alongside Titokowaru during the New Zealand Land Wars and claimed credit for killing Austrian mercenary Gustavus von Tempsky. Ngarewa- Packer was a nominee for the Taranaki Daily News person of the year in 2018. == References == Category:Living people Category:MƒÅori Party politicians Category:Deputy mayors of places in New Zealand Category:Leaders of political parties in New Zealand Category:New Zealand activists Category:New Zealand women activists Category:NgƒÅti Ruanui Category:New Zealand MƒÅori women Category:21st-century New Zealand politicians Category:21st-century New Zealand women politicians Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Candidates in the 2020 New Zealand general election ","title":"Debbie Ngarewa-Packer"},{"id":"63781694","text":"Jeff Witscher (born August 13, 1983) is an American electronic musician. ==Biography== Witscher has recorded and performed under many aliases, of which the best-known is Rene Hell.

Charles Jacque, L'h√©sitation (1841), showing a dog in a position indicating hesitation. Hesitation or hesitating is the psychological process of pausing in the course of making a decision or taking an action, typically due to uncertainty as to the best course of action. Hesitation is described in both positive and negative terms, with some perceiving it as an indication of thoughtfulness, while others characterize it as a sign of indecisiveness or lack of the will to act. In literature, a period of hesitation on the part of a key character has sometimes been depicted as having substantial consequences. ==Psychology== Psychologically, hesitation can be described as \\"the period of inactivity during which the struggle amongst the nascent activities of different mechanisms is proceeding, during which the nascent activities of the mechanisms is alternating\\".Charles Arthur Mercier, Psychology: Normal and Morbid (1901), p. 365. Although hesitation is a form of pause, not all pauses are instances of hesitation. A pause may serve some other purpose, and it has been noted that \\"the term pause sometimes implies a more or less 'regular' feature of production, whereas hesitation implies an irregularity, an intrusion or disruption in production\\".Philip Emmert, William Dean Brooks, Methods of research in communication (1970), p. 253. Hesitation has been described as \\"one of the most difficult habits for the student to overcome\\".W. R. Smith, \\"Pointers for the Student\\", The Journal of Commercial Education, Vol. 15 (1900), p. 198. Hesitation can be observed in animals. For example, in the third week of training a dog to come when signaled by its owner: In humans, hesitation can be attributed to many causes. It has been argued, for example, that it generally \\"the result of a lack of knowledge of the principles\\". One common form of hesitation is speech hesitation, wherein a person has difficulty beginning to speak, arising from factors including uncertainty about what to say, and concerns over speaking competence.John O. Greene, \\"Speech Preparation Processes and Verbal Fluency\\", Human Communication Research, Vol. 11, Issue 1 (September 1984), p. 61‚Äì84, https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1984.tb00038.x. Stanton Marlan writes more positively of the phenomenon that \\"I imagine hesitation as being a fecund opening, a gateway to the unconscious and to the nothingness of which Derrida speaks. It is a nothingness that enriches both the dialectical process of analysis and our theoretical speculation\\".Stanton Marlan, \\"Hesitation and Slowness: Gateway To Psyche's Depth\\", Lyn Cowan, ed., Barcelona 2004 - Edges of Experience: Memory and Emergence (2006), p. 371. He describes hesitation in this context as \\"also a deepening of interiority and psychological space\\". According to psychologist, James Hillman, \\"[t]his increased interiority means that each new ... inspiration, each hot idea ... will first be drawn through the labyrinthine ways of the soul, which wind it and slow it and nourish it from many sides\\". ==Philosophy and morality== Hesitation can be interpreted positively or negatively. It may be seen by some as evidence of thoughtfulness and due consideration of alternatives before acting, and by others as vacillation or self-doubt. It may be presumed that a properly informed and prepared person should \\"do the right thing without hesitation\\".Peri Roberts, Introduction to Political Thought (2012), p. 290. An absence of hesitation is interpreted as signifying certainty.Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, Moral Skepticism (2007), p. 108. \\"Hesitation, however, may discourage inspiration; quick decisions may sometimes be preferable. Individuals who value personal or political consistency may not hesitate when they believe they know the correct or appropriate action to be taken; for them hesitation then means rejecting their own significant values or intentions\\".Leonard William Doob, Pursuing Perfection: People, Groups, and Society (1999), p. 149. Prussian general Carl von Clausewitz described hesitation as a being countered by determination, writing that \\"the role of determination is to limit the agonies of doubt and the perils of hesitation when the motives for action are inadequate\\".Carl von Clausewitz, On War (1832), chapter 3. Hesitation, however, is expected before entering into a wrongful course of conduct. \\"If anyone is among friends or people he knows, and wants their respect, he hesitates before doing anything shameful\\".George Lloyd Bird, Frederic Eaton Merwin, The Press and Society: A Book of Readings (1942), p. 292. ==In literature== As a literary device, hesitation before engaging in certain actions reveals qualities of the character being described. In William Shakespeare's plays, Hamlet and Macbeth, for example, each protagonist hesitates while contemplating killing another character, Macbeth before killing King Duncan to assume the throne, and Hamlet before killing his uncle Claudius to avenge the murder of his father; \\"Macbeth's hesitation at killing Duncan is akin to Hamlet's over the kneeling Claudius\\".Herbert R. Coursen, The Compensatory Psyche: A Jungian Approach to Shakespeare (1986), p. 78. Sigmund Freud, in examining Hamlet asserts that \\"[t]he play is based on Hamlet's hesitation in accomplishing the task of revenge assigned to him; the text does not give the cause or the motive of this\\". The conflict is \\"deeply hidden\\". The common proverbial phrase \\"he who hesitates is lost\\" suggests that the time taken while hesitating to act towards obtaining something can lead to the loss of the opportunity to obtain that thing. The phrase is a rewording of a phrase by playwright Joseph Addison, who wrote in his 1712 play, Cato, a Tragedy: ==See also== * Analysis paralysis * Buridan's ass ==References== ==External links== Category:Psychology ","title":"Hesitation"},{"id":"63781768","text":"Jerry Bishop (October 19, 1935 ‚Äì April 21, 2020) was an American announcer, radio host and radio personality.

Soedjono originated from Surakarta and after an early career in his father's trading business he joined the fledgling Indonesian National Armed Forces in 1945, at the start of the Indonesian National Revolution, as a financial officer in Kodam IV/Diponegoro. He built up a relationship with Suharto during his time under him, and as Suharto took power as President in 1966, he was appointed as a personal assistant (Aspri). In this capacity, Soedjono was a major player in the economic relations between Indonesia and Japan. His actions in this role generated significant controversy, which culminated in 1974 when he was a target of demonstrators during the Malari incident. After the incident, he toned down his relations with Japan publicly, though he maintained his Japanese connections until his death in 1986. ==Early life== Soedjono was born in Surakarta on 7 September 1918 as the son of Raden Hoemardani, a local entrepreneur in Surakarta. He studied in Surakarta for some time and then went to a trading school in Semarang, before returning to Surakarta to work on his father's business in 1937, and he also became the treasurer of a nationalist youth organisation Indonesia Muda (Young Indonesia). ==Career== After the Japanese took power in Indonesia, Soedjono joined the Japanese reserve police force (Keibodan) and became a deputy commander. During the Indonesian National Revolution, he started off in 1945 as a second lieutenant in the 4th Division (today Kodam IV/Diponegoro), and became a treasurer for a regiment within it. He was later promoted to first lieutenant in 1947 and was assigned as the division's financial officer. After the war, his rank was elevated to captain in 1950, major in 1957, and lieutenant colonel in 1961. During this period, Soeharto was the commander of the Diponegoro division, and Soedjono was his financial officer. Soedjono also undertook a 10-month course in the United States Army Financial Management School at Fort Benjamin Harrison, completing it in 1964. In mid-1966, several months following Suharto's takeover of the presidency (through the Supersemar), Soedjono was appointed as one of six military officers in Suharto's personal staff, and as one of three junior officers (under the coordination of Alamsyah Ratu Perwiranegara). At the time, he held the rank of colonel. By September that year, he was dispatched with Adam Malik's delegation to the Netherlands, the US, and Japan, and the delegation announced Indonesia's reapplication to the United Nations while it was in New York. In a 1969 interview, Soedjono remarked that Suharto's only order for the delegation for the United Nations was to \\"enter\\". When the delegation then went to Japan, Soedjono met with influential Japanese figures lobbying for relations with Indonesia, and established himself as the intermediary between Suharto's government and the lobby. The following year, industrialist Yutaka Kubota had visited him to lobby for the resumption of the development of an aluminum plant at Asahan. Due to extensive powers they held, the personal staff was nicknamed as the \\"shadow government\\" around 1968. Suharto disbanded his personal staff due to suspicions of business interests in 1968, but the three army officers (including Soedjono) were immediately reappointed as \\"personal assistants\\" (Aspri), and effectively nothing changed for them. With his new title, Soedjono continued engaging with Japanese investors (becoming a subject of student demonstrations in 1972 due to his involvement in the matter), lobbying for loans and investments almost exclusively outside formal diplomatic methods. He defended multiple times during interviews his role in allowing significant foreign capital control over firms operating in Indonesia, though he did help establish significant ties between some local entrepreneurs and Japanese investors. Additionally, a recommendation from Soedjono was considered essential for local entrepreneurs seeking to establish ties with Japanese companies. Soedjono was promoted to major general rank in 1969. In 1971, Soedjono, alongside Ali Murtopo, backed the founding of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. He was further appointed as an armed forces representative to the People's Consultative Assembly in 1971. ===Malari incident=== Soedjono and Ali Murtopo was known in the early 1970s to be in opposing factions within the military leadership against Sumitro. Soedjono's well-known position as the conduit for Japanese investors became target of student protesters, who on 15 January 1974 rioted in what is today known as the Malari incident. Effigies of Soedjono and Japanese PM Kakuei Tanaka (who was visiting) were burned by the protesters; eventually, Aspri was disbanded, and Soedjono was reassigned as an inspector general of national development in July 1974. After the incident, Soedjono's publicly visible relationship with Japanese investors diminished, though he maintained ties with his Japanese network throughout the 1970s and 1980s. ===Spiritual advisor=== There was a popular belief that Suharto had relied on Soedjono for spiritual advice (Alamsyah had once referred to Soedjono, in criticism, as a \\"dukun\\"). Suharto himself denied this in his autobiography, claiming that Soedjono had more often approached him for spiritual affairs. ==Death== Soedjono died on 12 March 1986 in Tokyo, Japan, due to internal bleeding. Before his body was transported back to Indonesia, he was visited by multiple of his Japanese colleagues (many from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), and his burial procession was accompanied by the Japanese Ambassador to Indonesia at the time. He was buried outside Surakarta. ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * * Category:1918 births Category:1986 deaths Category:People from Surakarta Category:Indonesian generals Category:Indonesia‚ÄìJapan relations Category:Members of the People's Consultative Assembly ","title":"Soedjono Hoemardani"},{"id":"63781993","text":"Phyllis Avery (November 14, 1922-May 19, 2011) was an American actress. == Early life == Phyllis Avery was born to screenwriter Stephen Morehouse Avery and his wife Evelyn Martine Avery.Prolific TV Actress Phyllis Avery Dies at 88 Nachruf in: The Hollywood Reporter vom 23.

It is deciduous meaning it sheds its leaves seasonally, and monoecious, meaning it contains both male and female reproductive flower parts. It is a tree that can reach 40 meters in height with a trunk that can reach 3 meters in width. The tree forms a large bushy crown and has a straight and cylindrical bole (trunk). Its bark is coarse and usually reddish-brown. The tree development fits the Mangenot architectural model. ==Ecology== The okoubaka tree is a hemiparasite meaning it is parasitic under natural conditions but is photosynthetic to some degree. It is known to parasitize tiama (Entandrophragma angolense from the mahogany family), African teak (Pericopsis elata from the legume family), Pterygota macrocarpa (from the mallow family), and baku (Tieghemella heckelii from Sapotaceae) with P. macrocarpa and African teak being reported as most affected. Seed mass is large and so seed dispersal has been hypothesized to depend on large forest animals such as elephants. ==Folk medicine== The tree is thought to be useful for various folk medicinal purposes in all of its native ranges (mostly the seeds and bark). In Nigeria, the stem bark is used for the production of Maloff-HB, an anti-malarial drug. There is no scientific evidence that it has any medicinal properties. ==References== ==External links== # Plants for a Future: Okoubaka aubrevillei # Useful Tropical Plants: Okoubaka aubrevillei Category:Flora of Africa Category:Medicinal plants Category:Santalaceae Category:Parasitic plants ","title":"Okoubaka aubrevillei"},{"id":"63782051","text":"The Schynberg Rundfahrt was a one-day road cycling race held annually in Switzerland between 1982 and 2003.

ALAESM is present in all tissue cells and highly up-regulated in the brain, spinal cord, adrenal gland and kidney. This gene can be expressed up to 2.5 times the average gene in its highly expressed tissues. Although the function of C1orf122 is unknown, it is predicted to be used for mitochondria localization. == Gene == C1orf122 is located on chromosome 1 at 1p34.3. The gene is 1,665 nucleotides long, covering 37,808,405 to 37,809,454. It contains three exons with boundaries between amino acids 12 and 13, and amino acids 79 and 80. == mRNA == C1orf122 has two isoforms. Variant one contains 1,329 nucleotides with three exons. Variant two contains 1,226 nucleotides with three exons. Variant two lacks an in-frame portion of the 5' coding region, resulting in a shorter N-terminus. == Protein == ALAESM has a molecular weight of 1100 kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.29. It is a cytosolic protein without a transmembrane domain. This conceptual translation shows various points of interest in the C1orf122 gene. === Predicted post-translational modifications === There are few predicted kinase phosphorylation sites in this protein. Position 7 is predicted to be phosphorylated by CK1, VRK, and VRK2. Position 10 is predicted to be phosphorylated by CRK1, VRK, PKC, PLK, and AGC. Position 82 has a possible phosphorylation by TKL and MLK. Position 94 is predicted to be phosphorylated by PKC, AGC, MAPK, NEK, CMGC and IKK. ALAESM does have a few predicted reactive sites. It is predicted to be palmitoylated at position 10, allowing the covalent attachment of fatty acids. It is predicted to undergo glycation at positions 21 and 101 which attaches a sugar molecule to the amino acid. It is predicted to have a nuclear export signal strand from position 55-64 which signals the protein to leave the nucleus. It likely can be glycosylated at position 82 and 94 which attaches a carbohydrate to the amino acid. It is predicted to be phosphorylated by unsp at position 10, 82, and 94 in the nucleus. == Structure == The secondary structure of ALAESM is predicted to be structured as 55% random coil, 35% alpha helix and 9% extended strand. There are two alpha helices between positions 11-18 and 36-68. There are three 2 amino acid sections after position 80 and one 4 amino acid section at position 20 of extended strand. The rest of the protein is random coil. There is no transmembrane domain within ALAESM == Expression == ALAESM is expressed throughout all tissue cells in the body. It is also expressed up to 2.5 times higher than its average level in the brain, spinal cord, adrenal gland and kidneys. The protein is expressed in the cytoplasm and since it is predicted to have a nuclear export signal, it is kept in the cytoplasm even in telophase when the nuclear envelope disassembles. == Homology == This graph shows the date of divergence, sequence length, and sequence identity for the orthologs of the human gene C1orf122. Human C1orf122 does not have any paralogs, however it has multiple orthologs amongst placental mammals. These species range from cats, horses, rabbits, alpacas, and elephants. The sequence across these species are highly conserved. == References == Category:Genes on human chromosome 1 Category:Uncharacterized proteins Category:Biology ","title":"C1orf122"},{"id":"63782277","text":"John Kael Weston (born 1972) is an American diplomat, author, and politician. He is a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in Utah's 2nd congressional district in the 2020 election. A member of the Democratic Party, Weston is running against incumbent Chris Stewart. Weston spent over a decade serving in the United States Department of State, including seven years as an advisor for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, from 2003 to 2010., and earned the State Department's Award for Heroism. He previously led the United States' effort in the United Nations Security Council to freeze assets linked to al- Qaeda. He is an instructor at Westminster College and the Marine Corps University. He also serves on Salt Lake County's Open Space Advisory Board. ==Family, early life, and education== Weston's grandfather served in World War II and his father served in the Vietnam War. His mother was a teacher for 25 years at Westmore Elementary School in Orem, Utah. His parents grew up in Milford, Utah, and had descended from Danish immigrants. Weston has an identical twin brother, Kyle. Weston grew up in Northern Utah, and graduated from the University of Utah in 1996, with a major in political science and a minor in history. He later received a master‚Äôs from the University of Cambridge, spent a year as a Fulbright Scholar in Amsterdam, and studied toward a PhD at the London School of Economics. == Career == ===State Department service=== Weston takes a question during a pre-election press conference held in Fallujah, Iraq, on December 14, 2005, during his time as a State Department employee. Weston's seven years in Iraq and Afghanistan was more than any other State Department officer. During his time, he was a political adviser to combat units on the battlefield. He spent two and a half years on the ground before, during and after the Battle of Fallujah. His supervisor, political counselor Robert Ford, said Weston \\"had the toughest, most dangerous assignment of any State Department officer worldwide.‚Äù Weston has reported he was \\"almost killed numerous times in both wars, including surviving a suicide car bomb attack in Khost, Afghanistan, Taliban machine gun rounds hitting a mud wall a few feet away, insurgent RPGs overhead, not to mention more than a few additional loud bullets whizzing nearby. Despite these close calls, I did not carry a weapon... just a lot of notebooks.\\" Weston earned the Award for Heroism from the State Department for his time in Fallujah. Weston has written a memoir, The Mirror Test: America at War in Iraq and Afghanistan, detailing his time in the State Department serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was chosen as a New York Times Editors‚Äô Choice book, and a Military Times Best Book of the Year. ===2020 congressional election=== Weston announced his campaign with an editorial in the Salt Lake Tribune on December 15, 2019. Prior to Weston's entering the race, UtahPolicy.com had reported the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee considered Chris Stewart potentially vulnerable to a strong opponent, due to Donald Trump's unpopularity in the 2nd district, and Stewart's record of vigorously defending him. A poll taken in January 2020 among likely voters showed Stewart with 38% of the vote, and a Democratic challenger with 36% of the vote. (The remainder were undecided or voting for someone else.) On April 25, 2020, Weston defeated two challengers at the Utah state Democratic convention (which was held virtually due to coronavirus) to clinch the nomination. By receiving 83% of the vote of the party delegates, Weston avoided a primary campaign. Weston has been endorsed by Ted Wilson, the former mayor of Salt Lake City, and Shireen Ghorbani, a Salt Lake County council member and former candidate for Utah's 2nd congressional district. ==Political positions== Weston supports the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), calling it ‚Äúa public policy focused on the public good.‚Äù Weston also supports efforts to preserve, improve, and extend the law to reduce the number of uninsured Americans. Weston has publicly expressed concern about ‚Äúserious and lasting damage‚Äú to the American ‚Äúbrand‚Äù by Trump‚Äôs allegedly anti-immigration rhetoric, and by actions taken by his administration that ‚Äúappear intended to punish entire classes of people from Latin America,‚Äù such as family separations at the southern US border with Mexico. Weston considers the Afghanistan War to have been \\"a necessary war\\", but says the Iraq War was not. Weston broke with President Obama over the decision to approve a 30,000-troop surge in Afghanistan in late 2009. Weston instead believed the president should have determined how many troops to commit to Afghanistan for a decade, and then have pledged that level of support over that timeframe. In May 2019, Weston co-authored an editorial opposing President Trump‚Äôs proposed pardoning of accused or convicted war criminals. Later that year, Trump pardoned Eddie Gallagher and granted clemency to two other soldiers accused or convicted of war crimes.https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/472201-trump-says-he-stood-up-to- the-deep-state-by-intervening-in-war-crime- caseshttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/27/eddie-gallagher-trump- navy-seal-iraq In January 2020, after the killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani by air strike, Weston published an editorial in the Salt Lake Tribune stating his opposition to the attack. Weston argued the strike made the United States less safe by provoking Iran. Weston has criticized the Trump administration‚Äôs response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization. Weston's campaign website lists his priorities as health care, living wages, gun violence, public lands, climate policy, money in politics, veterans' issues, and human rights. ==References== ==External links== * Campaign website * The Mirror Test * * Category:1972 births Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Living people Category:Twin people Category:Utah Democrats ","title":"Kael Weston"},{"id":"63782278","text":"Carlos Gonz√°lez-Artigas D√≠az (1947 - 4 April 2020) was an Ecuadorian businessman. == Biography == Gonz√°lez-Artigas was born in Quito, Ecuador and from a young age, as soon as he left school, he began his professional life in commercial and agro-industrial activities related to cotton planting and processing in the Manab√≠ Province, where he remained in Bah√≠a de Car√°quez for several years.

Radford-Hill went on to receive her ABD in American Studies at U of P, and her PH.D in Humanities at Columbia Commonwealth University in Wyoming. == Book- Further to Fly == Further to Fly: Black Women and the Politics of Empowerment was published in 2000 and focuses on the importance of black feminism in the fight for equality. Radford-Hill highlights how black feminists have lost their activist roots in the thirty years prior to 2000. She explains how the fight for equality for African-Americans heavily relies on the support from the female and feminist community within. Radford-Hill argues that once black women regain their power as activists, that the economic, and social prejudice against blacks will wither. She sources this decline in activism to three things: the migration of blacks to white neighborhoods, The Moynihan Report, and the misogynistic ways of the black nationalist movement. She blames postmodern feminism for depleting the role of black women in activism because according to her research, black women were not empowered by this movement. Rather, she explains how black women were shown that the new wave of feminism was only meant for white women . Radford-Hill then goes on to explain how this gap in activism can be closed . To increase activism, she encourages black feminists to refer back to the roots of traditional feminist thought when the movement was more inclusive and empowering towards black women . She also suggests that black women need to appeal to the current social issues, engage with their community, and become more economically motivated in their activism in order to promote their activism. She explains how activists must be authentic in their work by committing to implementation of social change and research . Radford-Hill advocates for the collaboration between all feminists but overall focuses on how black women can strengthen their activism through communicating with each-other. ==References== Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:American women non-fiction writers Category:Writers from Chicago Category:African-American women academics Category:Black feminism Category:DePaul University alumni Category:University of Pennsylvania alumni Category:American feminist writers ","title":"Sheila Radford-Hill"},{"id":"63782357","text":"Ioan Carlaon»õ (19 October 1885 ‚Äì 6 February 1952) was a Romanian major general, who led an anti-communist resistance movement in Oltenia after World War II.

In ancient times, each kingdom was enclosed with a wall that contained various gates. During battles, the gates were closed as a war strategy. Each gate has a name and a gatekeeper (Sarkin Kofa, lit. \\"King of the Gate\\"). In the past, especially at night, the gatekeeper was in charge of a single gate at all time. All of the gates are assigned to a single person today. == Architectural concept == In Hausa Kingdoms, gates were built from mud, dried grass, timber, metals, stones, and other traditional building materials suitable for the building. The gates are designed based on Hausa culture and depict Hausa traditional architecture using burn bricks and traditional colors of the Hausa region. On average, the gates reach a height of about five meters, with a length of about ten meters. They are illustrated with patterns, marks, symbols, and Hausa designs, such as a tambarin arewa, a logo frequently used in Hausa buildings which serves as an emblem or flag to Hausa people. When the structure of the gate is completed, the entire gate is painted in a traditional style while some gates are left brownish with the natural color of mud, like the Gate of Marusa in Katsina. Hausa traditional dressing == Overview == In ancient times, every gate was allocated to one person. It is his duty at all times to protect and maintain it by providing administrative records of every movement of people passing through the gate along with foreign record affairs for self-defense. Every gate has a key for closing and opening it; the keys are allocated to Sarkin Kofa. Usually, there is a fixed time for closing and opening of every gate, but today the gates are open without the need for keys. Traditionally, during wartime, orders only came from either the emir of the kingdom or his war counselor, the Sarkin yaki'. Out of wartime, orders and control of the gate are left to the Sarkin Kofa. It is an order that entry into the city may only be done through those gates. When the gates are closed at night, they do not reopen until dawn. The post of Sarkin Kofa is inherited generationally in the Hausa Kingdom, from a Sarkin Kofa to his children. The gates also serve as a tourist attraction nowadays in Hausalands. == Gates == ===Bauchi Emirate=== alt=In Bauchi Emirate there are nine gates. * Gate of Inkil: Called the gate of Eid. It was constructed for the people of Inkil town to allow them to enter the city and perform Eid prayers. * Gate of Dumi: This gate was named after a student of Malam Yakubu called Abdul Dumi, who became the Wambai of Bauchi and an adviser to the emir in the palace. *Gate of Jahun *Gate of Nasarawo: This gate was named after a prominent malam called Malam Nasarawo, who lived outside the gate. The emir at that time went through the gate to visit Nasarawo for prayers. *Gate of Hunti: This gate was built in memory of a Wuntawan warlord (descended from a tribe of Fula people) called Muhmmadu Kusu. As time passed, the word Wuntuwa turned into Hunti. *Gate of Ran: Ran is a place were the people of Bauchi once made peace. They followed the gate to meet in Ran; after peace was made, the gate earned the name of the place. *Gate of Tirwun: Turwun is a town where Sarki Yakubu hailed from, so he erected this gate to honor his town and his people. *Gate of Wambai: When the city of Bauchi was expanded, the emir of that time built another house for his chief adviser known as \\"Wambai\\". The house was built in the expanded area together with a gate for coming in and out of the palace to ease his movement. The gate was named after him. *Gate of Wuse: The history of this gate remains unknown. === Kano Emirate === The kingdom Kano has 15 gates. Some of its wall has eroded due to poor maintenance. * Gate of Kansakali: Built between 1095 and 1135, the Gate of Kansakali was the first city gate to be constructed. * Gate of Nasarawa *Gate of Gidan Rumfa: This is the main entrance of Kano palace, built by the emir. * Sabuwar Kofa Gate: Constructed after Kano fell to the British in 1903. * Gate of Dan Agundi * Gate of Naisa * Gate of Gadankaya * Gate of Dukawiya * Gate of Kabuga * Gate of Waika * Gate of Ruwa * Gate of Dawanau * Gate of Wambai * Gate of Mazuga * Gate of Mata File:Kofar Nasarawa - Kano City Gate.jpgGate of Nasarawa File:Kofar Ruwa - Kano City Gate.jpgGate of Ruwa File:Main gate of the kano emir's palace.pngGate of Rumfa or Fada File:Kofar Mata - Kano City Gate.jpgGate of Mata File:Kofar Dawanau - Kano City Gate.jpgGate of Dawanau File:Kofar Sabuwar.jpgGate of Sabuwa File:Kofar Gadan Kaya - Kano City Gate.jpgGate of Gadan Kaya File:Kofar Na'isa Gate.jpgGate of Nai'sa File:Kofar Wambai - Kano City Gate.jpgGate of Wambai File:Kofar Famfo - Kano City Gate.jpgGate of Famfo File:Kofar Mata Dye Pit since 1498.jpgGate of Mata 1498 File:Kofar Dan Agundi - partially collapsed.jpgGate of Dan Agundi ===Katsina Emirate=== alt=The palace was surrounded by a rampart wall called \\"Ganuwar Gidan Sarki\\", which is now gone. The main gate that leads to the palace is called \\"Kofar Soro\\", meaning Gate of Soro, while the gate at the backyard of the palace is called Gate of Bai, which is now gone. In the city of Katsina, there are almost 7 gates at every corner of the kingdom. The gates were constructed to enable movement in and out, there are some gates that are no longer in existence, these gates are; The Gate of Turmi, Gate of Keke, Gate of Angulu, Gate of Gazobi and Gate of Waziri. * Gate of Agulu: This gate has two openings. the word \\"Agulu\\" is a name given to the slave of the emir. He is in charge of the Gate and the person in charge of executing people under the death penalty. *Gate of Keke: This gate was made after the arrival of the colonial Europeans of the British Empire. It is behind the palace of the emir of Katsina. The Europeans used to enter this gate when coming to the palace from their quarters on bicycles; the gate was named after the bicycles, or \\"Keke\\" in Hausa. * Gate of Kwaura: The gate was named after a prominent warrior of Rimi who was given the ruling title of \\"Kwauran Katsina\\", which was transferred to the gate. * Gate of Kwaya: This Gate derives its name from an emir of Habe called Sarkin Kwaya who ruled a small town called Kwaya, which is south of Katsina. The duty of this ruler is to provide grain to the emir of Katsina like guinea corn, millet, and maize for the emir's estate. It was said that it is through this gate Wali Jodoma was expelled from Katsina by the emir, so he went passed through the gate, turned around and cursed it, saying \\"Nothing good will be done on this Gate unless 500 years have passed\\". People built houses near every gate in Katsina except the Gate of Kwaya. The gate is now one of the major gates into Katsina from various cities. Shararar Fayif and Sabuwar Unguwa are close to this gate. * Gate of Durbi: This gate, according to the first source, derived its name from the emirate of Durbi of Kusheyi. The gate derived the name when the Durbawa began ruling the emirate of Katsina. When they migrated to Katsina from their town, the emirate of Durbi changed its name to Durbi-Katsina. The ruler of the emirate of Durbi was called the \\"Hakimin Katsina\\". Durbi has been in Mani since Durbi Saddiku's rule from around 1810-1835. There were also other Durbi emirs, such as Durbi Fandiku who ruled from 1836-1860, Durbi Gidado (1860-1883), and Durbi Dikko (1891-1906). The Durbawa entered through the gate when they arrived at Katsina. The gate was then called the Gate of Durbi, meaning the Gate of emirs from Durbi. This gate is closed to towns like Filin Samji and Rimin Badawa. *The Gate of Guga: This gate has three original names: it was called the Gate of Yammawa because it is located east of Katsina; the Gate of Tsaro, which means \\"gate of security\\" because soldiers were posted at the gate to prevent sudden attacks; it was mainly known as the Gate of Guga, the word \\"Guga\\" coming from a wife of Sarkin Gobir known as Bawa Jan Gwarzo. She ran away from her husband to Katsina through this gate, to warn the king of Katsina known as Muhammadu Jan Hazo (ruled from 1740-1751) for her husband's preparations to attack Katsina. After defeating the Gobir kingdom, the emir renamed this Gate to honor her loyalty. * Gate of Sauri: This is a gate in the northwest sector of Katsina, which is close to Unguwar Rafukka, Nasarawa, Makera, and Yammawa. The gate of Sauri has two sources about its origin: according to the first source, Kofar Sauri derives its name from Sarkin Samari, who stays close to the gate. At first, the name \\"Samari\\" was given to the gate before it mutated into \\"Samri\\", then \\"Sauri\\". According to the second source, its name came from the regime of Sarki Ummarun Dallaje (1807-1835) when a warlord called Danbaskore lead a counterattack against the city of Katsina. when he discovered all the gates were closed, the emir of the Sauri town \\"Sarkin Sauri\\" (now Kaita), who was an ally to the Katsina, intercepted Danboskore and defeated him. When he emerged victorious, he erected a gate in the wall of Katsina, which was named the Gate of Sauri in remembrance of the legend of Sarkin Sauri. * Gate of Marusa: This gate is considered to be one of the oldest gates in the history of Katsina. It was said to have been built in the 15th century. It was built together with the wall of Katsina, and derives its name from a ruler of Habe called Marusa Usman who ruled Dutsi. He was said to be a warrior who entered and exited Katsina through this gate from Dutsi. Another source says it was from a man who specialized in catching slaves. * Gate of Yan daka: It was said to be built around 15th century. The gate Yan Daka derives its name from a ruler in Dustin Ma, who was given the post ruling of \\"Yan…óakan Katsina\\" in the Katsina emirate. His house was close to the gate. ===Zazzau Emirate === alt= The city of Zaria has six gates that were originally erected after the wall of the city was constructed. The gates included the following except the gates of Jatau and the gate of Galadima. The current Sarkin Kofa of Zazzau is Alhaji Mansur Dambo Mai-Sa‚Äôa. * Gate of Gayan: This gate was created for the people of Gadar Gayan, to have easy access when entering the city. The word Gayan is derived from a river named Gayan and a town named after the river called Gadar Gayan. * Gate of Kuyan Bana: This gate was the second to be erected. It derives its name from a warlord of Queen Amina known as Mayaki Kuyan Bana. He is well- known for his legendary victories in many battles. He established the small town then called Kuyan Bana, south of Kwatarkwashi. He built his home in Kuyan Bana and the Queen made him the guardian of the gate. * Gate of Kona: This gate was the third gate to be constructed. The gate derives its name from two Islamic clerics that came to the city of Zaria known as konawa. When they arrived they spent their time outside the city of Zaria without coming to the town, when the gates were erected in their direction, people began calling the gate with the gate of Konawa, when they spent years near the gate. * Gate of Kibo: The gate was originally named Kofar Tukur Tukur. The people of Gobir, Zamfara, Yawuri, and Kabi used to enter the city of Zaria from this gate. The gate derived its name from a stone located in a town of Tukur Tukur. Tukur Tukur is an old town outside Zaria; during the reign of Sarkin Zazzau Sambo, a battle took place close to Tukur Tukur alongside the gate. The gate changed its name to the arrow, \\"Kibo\\", afterward. * Gate of Doka: The Gate of Doka was the fifth to be constructed in Zaria. It was originally called the gate of Kano. It is said that it derived its name from a tree that was close to the gate known as \\"Bishiyan Doka\\", while another source states the gate derived its name from the gatekeeper known as \\"Doka\\". * Gate of Bai: The place where the gate is erected is at the back of the house of the emir of Zazzau. The word \\"bai\\" means behind in Hausa, which means the Gate behind the emir's house. The people of Bauchi usually enter the city through this gate. * Gate of Jatau: This gate was named Jatau after a prominent king of Habe known as Isiyaku Jatau, who ruled Zazzau from 1782 to 1802. * Gate of Galadima: This gate derives its name from Galadiman Zazzau known as Daudu, who was known by the beggars. The gate was close to his house. Some sources say it was Galadima Dokaje. *Gate of Fada: Fada means palace. This gate is the main gate entrance to the palace of Sarkin Zazzau. * == Maintenance == The gates were formerly the responsibility of traditional rulers known as emirs, who assigned maintenance duties to the Sarkin Kofa. In 1959, the Federal Government of Nigeria declared the gates to be national monuments, and the responsibility transferred to the federal government. Some gates are falling into disrepair due to lack of maintenance. == See also == * Hausa people * Hausa language * Hausa cuisine * Ancient Kano City Walls == References == == Further reading == * Moody, H.L.B.

Often referred to as 'kiwi dip', 'onion dip' or 'original kiwi dip', it consists of a packet of powdered onion soup stirred into a can of reduced cream, which is then left to refrigerate and thicken. Served alongside potato chips, crackers, or chopped vegetables, the dip is a popular dish at parties, barbeques, and other social occasions. A small amount of vinegar or lemon juice can be added to the dip for flavour. Kiwi onion dip's creation has been credited to Rosemary Dempsey, a home economist for Nestl√© New Zealand in the 1950s or 60s. == In popular culture == The dip has assumed an iconic status in New Zealand cuisine. In February 2019 Nestl√© released a campaign bannered \\"Kiwi as\\", aligning the dip with canonical moments in New Zealand popular culture. Lauraine Jacobs, a food writer, has said Kiwi onion dip is an ‚Äúall-time classic‚Äù. ‚ÄúMy mother made it. My son and his wife make it, and think themselves clever. So now it is the darling of yet another generation.\\" The dip is often missed by New Zealanders living abroad who may not have access to reduced cream, a dairy product only widely available in their home country. In 2019 it was reported cans of reduced cream are commonly found in the suitcases of New Zealanders as they travel overseas. In April 2019, Countdown supermarket announced the introduction of 'NZ Onion Dip Icecream', a two litre tub of ice cream flavoured with caramelised onions and reduced cream.

It begins in the town of Lexington in Greene County, and flows south, through the town of Shandaken in Ulster County then converges with the Esopus Creek. The creek was named after Major John Bradstreet, an officer in the English Army during the French and Indian War, who is known for attacking Fort Frontenac. ==Watershed== Broadstreet Hollow Creek is the second largest tributary to Esopus Creek in the project area, with a watershed of 9.2 square miles and a total length of 5.5 miles. The headwaters are located on the southern slopes of West Kill Mountain. The stream flows to the southwest for 3.9 miles before turning south and traveling the remainder of its distance to the Esopus Creek. It enters Esopus Creek approximately 1,500 feet downstream of the Shandaken Tunnel outlet. The watershed is mountainous with steep slopes and a forest cover of 99.5 percent. The valley bottom is narrow with little floodplain area. Broadstreet Hollow Creek runs parallel to Broadstreet Hollow Road along the lower half of its course passing under nine bridges. As a result of the narrow geological setting and transportation infrastructure, the course of the stream is highly constrained. Many residences are located close to the stream. This proximity coupled with little floodplain area suggests that these structures are at risk of flooding during high discharges. ==Geology== The geological setting of Broadstreet Hollow Creek is similar to Bushnellsville Creek. The surficial geology consists of glacial and alluvial deposits. The exposed sediments are primarily glacial till and alluvium although lacustrine clay has been observed in the banks and the bed. The bedrock consists of red beds including shales and mudstones as well as grey sandstones and grey shales. However, there is no evidence of bedrock in the valley bottom due to thick deposits of glacial sediment. ==Hydrology== On January 19, 1996, the Catskill Mountains experienced a heavy mid-winter rain and unseasonably warm temperatures causing rapid snowmelt, extreme runoff, and extensive flooding. During the flood, a small section of Broadstreet Hollow Creek experienced thirty feet of erosion, which caused damage to one home and threatened several others. In response the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) provided assistance under the Emergency Watershed Protection Program (EWP). The emergency project rebuilt the streambank, and provided stabilization to an additional 475 feet of streambank. During the project, the contractor experienced difficulties with clay deposits that had become exposed, causing turbidity. The emergency project resulted in the loss of streambed erosion protection, due to the course streambed material being used to restore the eroded streambank. Removal of the streambed exposed deep deposits of glacial and lacustrine clay. Then between early 1996 and late 1999, the creek experienced severe degradation, leading to bank erosion and large amounts of clays being deposited in the stream channel. In the fall of 1999, Tropical Storm Floyd further degraded the stream channel. Rapid incision of the channel, creating a constant upwelling of highly turbid groundwater. The turbid condition continued through low and high flows, with the stream remaining turbid from the project site to the Esopus Creek. ==References== Category:Rivers of New York (state) Category:Tributaries of the Hudson River Category:Catskill/Delaware watersheds Category:Rivers of Ulster County, New York Category:Rivers of Greene County, New York ","title":"Broadstreet Hollow Creek"},{"id":"63782799","text":"\\"Talk of the devil\\" is an idiom synonymous to \\"Speak of the devil\\".

Not long After returning, in 1889, he married Am√©lie Perretti, and they immediately set off for a three-month stay in Biskra. He would go there every winter for the next few years, until 1893, when the local people became suspicious of his activities. After that, until 1908, he wintered in Venice.

Levin's work was largely responsible for the resurgence of sharksploitation films. ==Background== Levin was born and raised in New York City. His father Michael was an award-winning journalist, while his mother Glenis was an immigrant from Liverpool, England. Levin graduated from Hunter College High School, and received his BFA in Film from NYU. ==Early career== Levin moved to Los Angeles at the age of 23. In the late 1980s he worked as a still photographer on three movies for the legendary film producer Roger Corman. Levin's feature-film directorial debut was the 2008 horror comedy Mutant Vampire Zombies from the 'Hood! starring C. Thomas Howell. Levin subsequently wrote and directed multiple films for production company The Asylum, including the 2012 science-fiction action film American Warships and the 2013 sci-fi film AE: Apocalypse Earth. ==Sharknado== In 2013, Levin wrote the made-for-television disaster film Sharknado, about a tornado of shark-infested seawater. The film's debut on SyFy attracted nearly 1.37 million viewers and generated nearly 5,000 tweets a minute at its peak. In 2014 Levin penned a sequel, Sharknado 2: The Second One, which pulled in 3.9 million viewers. Levin subsequently wrote two more sequels, 2015's Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! and 2016's Sharknado: The 4th Awakens. Sharknado became a pop culture phenomenon, ultimately spawning five sequels, a video game, a book, a one-shot comic book, a documentary, and a mockumentary.

Bellow Island lies a little over a mile off the coast of Leelanau Peninsula in Northport Bay. The island is preserved as a sanctuary for herring gulls. A deteriorating cottage on south side is the only structure on the island. ==History== A cottage was built in 1910 by Edward Taylor Ustick Sr., after he purchased the island. It was designed by prominent Traverse City architect Jens C. Petersen. The cottage and island ownership passed through his family until 1948 when the house was destroyed by vandals. Tourism by Northport visitors to the island was common in the early 50s, but died off soon after. During the mid-60s, the first discoveries of the pesticide DDT's impact on thinning bird shells occurred on the island. It has been owned and operated by the Leelanau Conservancy since it was donated to them in 1995. The island is now sealed off from the public and no humans are allowed to disturb the nesting birds. ==Ecology== The island is an important site for herring gull research, as it is one of the largest nesting herring gull colonies in Northern Michigan. Other major species that nest there include Double-crested cormorants and Ring-billed gulls. The first discoveries of the pesticide DDT's impact on thinning bird shells occurred on the island through research funded by the University of Michigan in the mid-60s. ==Climate== { -  } ==References== Category:Lake islands of Michigan Category:Uninhabited islands of Michigan ","title":"Bellow Island"},{"id":"63783214","text":"Lari is the surname of: * Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari (born 1954), Iranian Shia cleric and reformist politician * Adil Lari, Austrian architect * Ahmed Lari (born 1955), Kuwaiti politician * Dario Lari (born 1979), Italian rower * Egidio Lari (1882‚Äì1965), Italian Catholic prelate * Farinaz Lari (born 1987), Iranian kickboxer * Ghazala Lari, Indian politician * Leonida Lari (1949‚Äì2011), Romanian poet, journalist and politician * Mujtaba Musavi Lari (1925‚Äì2013), Iranian Islamic scholar * Ovidio Lari (1919‚Äì2007), Italian Catholic ordinary and bishop * Yasmeen Lari (born c. 1941), Pakistan's first female architect * Zahra Lari, Emirati figure skater ","title":"Lari (surname)"},{"id":"63783229","text":"Lari is a given name which may refer to: * Lari Ketner (1977‚Äì2014), American basketball player * Lari Lehtonen (born 1987), Finnish cross-country skier * Lari Pittman (born 1952), Colombian-American artist and professor * Lari White (1965‚Äì2018), American country music singer ==See also== * Larry, another given name ","title":"Lari (given name)"},{"id":"63783252","text":"This article documents the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in the province of Heilongjiang, China.

She is the first person to hold that office. She rose to prominence in 2016 as the attorney of activist and social leader Milagro Sala. ==Early life and career== G√≥mez Alcorta was born in San Isidro, in the suburbs of the Greater Buenos Aires, in 1982. She studied law at the University of Buenos Aires, graduating in 1997 with honors; she is the first university graduate in her family. She is a member of the Centro de Estudios Legales y Sociales (CELS), and worked in the Justice Ministry and the Council of Magistracy, where she became involved in judicial matters pertaining to victims of state-sponsored terrorism during the last military dictatorship (1976‚Äì1983). Additionally, she has been a faculty of the University of Buenos Aires School of Law, her alma mater. She rose to prominence in 2016 as the defending attorney of activist and social leader Milagro Sala, who stands accused of embezzlement. According to G√≥mez Alcorta, Sala was \\"sentenced for being a woman\\", and the charges against her constitute a \\"witch-hunt never seen before in the democratic era\\"; she maintains Sala is a political prisoner. G√≥mez Alcorta is a member of Mala Junta, a \\"feminist, popular, mixed and dissident\\" collective organized within the Patria Grande Front. She is a vocal supporter of the legalization of abortion in Argentina. ==Ministry of Women, Genders and Diversity== Ahead of the 2019 general election, then- presidential candidate Alberto Fern√°ndez announced his intention of creating of a new government ministry dedicated to overseeing public policies pertaining to women's issues, especially the issue of gender-based violence against women. G√≥mez Alcorta was touted by Fern√°ndez and vice-presidential candidate Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner to head the new ministry ahead of the Frente de Todos ticket's victory in the 2019 election. Under G√≥mez Alcorta's vision, the new ministry was subdivided into two secretariats, one dedicated to designing and implementing policies to mitigate gender-based violence against women, and another tasked with implementing policies related to equality and gender and sexual diversity. G√≥mez Alcorta has stated that the ministry's ultimate goal is \\"to mainstream and federalize gender policies across the Government's administration\\". In July 2020, G√≥mez Alcorta presented a $ 18,000 million-national plan against gender-based violence projected for the 2020-2022 period, aimed at reducing extreme violence, ensuring economic autonomy for victims of gender-based violence and seizing cultural and structural aspects. The plan establishes 15 points of action, including the establishment of integral territorial centers, a revamp of the 144 gender violence emergency line, and economic help for women and LGBT+ people at risk. ==References== ==External links== *Official website of the Ministry of Women, Genders and Diversity (in Spanish) Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine lawyers Category:Argentine feminists Category:Argentine human rights activists Category:21st-century women politicians Category:Government ministers of Argentina Category:Women government ministers of Argentina Category:Women's ministers Category:People from San Isidro, Buenos Aires Category:University of Buenos Aires alumni ","title":"Elizabeth G√≥mez Alcorta"},{"id":"63783271","text":"Dr. Wallace Harris Long, Jr. is an American choral conductor, educator, and vocalist.

In 1962 she completed the first PhD thesis in musicology to have been written in Ireland. She specialises in Irish music of the Classical period, and in female Irish composers. ==Career== Beausang was born in Cork and studied with Aloys Fleischmann at University College Cork, graduating as BMus (1956) and MA (1958) before she completed the first Irish PhD thesis in musicology on \\"Anglo-Irish Music, 1780‚Äì1830\\" (1962).Elaine Kelly: \\"Beausang, Ita\\", in: The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland, ed. by Harry White and Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), p. 70‚Äì71. With some adaptations, this was the basis of her book Anglo-Irish Music, 1780‚Äì1830 (Cork University Press, 1966; published under her maiden name Ita Margaret Hogan). From 1954 to 1960, she taught at the Cork School of Music. After her marriage and move to Dublin in 1960, she worked as a research assistant on the Royal Irish Academy's A New History of Ireland (Oxford University Press), again working with Fleischmann, during 1973‚Äì1974. In 1986, she was appointed lecturer in musicianship at the then College of Music (now the TU Dublin Conservatory of Music and Drama) and served as acting director, 1995‚Äì1996. She retired in 2001 and has since played an active role in fostering music education in Ireland, serving on the advisory group for a feasibility study, undertaken by the organisation Music Network, on \\"A National System of Local Music Education Services\\" (2001‚Äì2003). She was also a member of the executive committee of the Feis Ceoil (2003‚Äì2009). In 2010, Beausang was awarded Honorary Membership of the Society for Musicology in Ireland. She was also awarded Honorary Life Membership of the Society for Music Education in Ireland in 2014. ==Research interests== Under her maiden surname Hogan, Ita Beausang has published work on musical culture in late 18th and 19th-century Ireland, culminating in her volume Anglo-Irish Music, 1780‚Äì1830. For a long time, this study remained the only substantial text about Irish composers of a mainly Protestant background, including Charles Thomas Carter, Philip Cogan, Thomas Simpson Cooke, John Field, Michael Kelly, John Andrew Stevenson and others. The book \\"is recognised as a seminal text on the subject\\".Kelly (2013), p. 71. Barra √ì Seaghdha wrote in 2016 that \\"the book allows later readers and scholars to pick and choose the material that suits their own purposes, or to weave it into patterns of their own, regardless of the author's views\\".In \\"Silent Symphony\\", Dublin Review of Books; retrieved 25 April 2020). Due to her expertise in the area, she became an Advisory Editor for the Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland (published 2013). According to Kelly, \\"Beausang's academic career has been indelibly shaped by the thinking of her mentor Aloys Fleischmann; she has notably followed his example in viewing teaching and research as two sides of the same coin\\".Kelly (2013), p. 71. Consequently, much of her postdoctoral research has been inspired by pedagogical issues, from music education to piano pedagogy and music therapy. Beausang has repeatedly argued for a national system of music education and strongly supported initiatives of agencies such as the Forum for Music in Ireland, Music Education National Debate (MEND) and Music Education Action Group (MEAG).Kelly (2013), p. 70. She also played a significant role in the establishment of the first full-time third-level performance course in Ireland, the TU Dublin Conservatory's Graduate Diploma in Music (BMus Perf.) when it was validated as a degree by Trinity College Dublin in 1990.Kelly (2013), p. 70. In more recent years, Beausang has turned to female careers in 19th and early 20th-century Irish music, beginning with a period of research on Ina Boyle, which was finally published in book-form in 2018. ==Publications== ===Monographs=== * Anglo-Irish Music, 1780‚Äì1830 (Cork: Cork University Press, 1966). * (with S√©amas de Barra) Ina Boyle (1889‚Äì1967).

Gap junctions play an important regulatory role in various physiological processes including signal propagation in cardiac muscles and tissue homeostasis of the liver. Modulation is required, since gap junctions must respond to their environment, whether through an increased expression or permeability. Impaired or altered modulation can have significant health implications and are associated with the pathogenesis of the liver, heart and intestines. Modulation is achieved by endogenous chemicals, growth factors, hormones and proteins that affect gap junction expression, structure, degradation and permeability. Natural forms of modulation include voltage gating and chemical modulation. Voltage-gating is a relatively fast modulation categorized into Vj gating and slow voltage gating, which are further influenced by calcium ions (Ca2+), pH and calmodulin. Chemical modulation entails the addition or removal of a functional group or protein from the connexin subunits of gap junctions; this can alter gap junction expression and structure. == Voltage gating == The molecular structure of gap junctions makes them sensitive and responsive to intercellular currents. This sensitivity allows the channel to alter its size and structure according to electrical signals. The two types of voltage gating, Vj gating and slow voltage gating, are similar in their mechanisms, but react to different electrical magnitudes. The electrical signals that modulate gap junctions release Ca2+ which induces a positive feedback with voltage gating. This calcium modulation is also influenced by pH and calmodulin. === Mechanisms ===  Vj gating  Vj gating governs the size of the gap junction, and is able to reduce the channel size by up to 40% from its fully open state. The sensitivity towards voltage is largely attributed to the gap junction‚Äôs cytoplasmic NH2-terminal which is responsive to small voltages (2-3mV). Voltage gating modulation is associated with the charge of connexin; positively charged connexin close with hyperpolarization and negatively charged connexins close with depolarization. Other than connexin charge, Vj gating is also regulated by different concentrations of Ca2+, H+ and calmodulin.  Slow voltage gating  Slow voltage gating is hypothesized to be similar to Vj gating in terms of mechanism, but unlike Vj gating, fully closes the channel to a non-conducting state. This modulation is slower than the prior gating method, as it occurs in response to Vj gating. The temporal voltage regulation is also subject to higher voltage (10-30mV), various natural factors‚Äìsuch as lipophiles and low pH‚Äìand the docking of two hemichannels. The exact mechanisms of both Vj gating and slow voltage gating remain unknown, but it is predicted that change in charge causes the cytoplasmic NH2-terminal domain to move toward the cytoplasm to decrease the pore size. === Factors ===  Calcium  Calcium exists in organisms in the form of the ion, Ca2+, and is an effective modulator of gap junctions, having a close relationship with voltage gating. An increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration by above 500nM causes the permeability of plasma membranes to decreases rapidly. This modulation via calcium is known to be protective, as it prevents dead cells from inducing apoptosis in neighboring cells. Yet, high Ca2+ concentration is rarely seen, as this gating method is self-inhibiting. Ca2+ concentrations are a crucial determiner behind voltage gating as the influx and movement of Ca2+ is required for depolarization.  pH  Gap junction permeability is further influenced by their environment‚Äôs pH. The pH sensitivity depends on the type of connexin composing the gap junction, but the channels generally close at a pH of 6.4-6.2. Under weak acidic conditions, the gap junction‚Äôs channels are observed to remain closed despite voltage changes, while under strong acidic conditions, the channels do open with voltage, but close immediately. Reports further indicate a synergistic relationship between hydrogen ions and the intracellular concentration of calcium in reducing gap junction permeability. Studies on cardiac cells noted that acidosis, decreased pH, by itself had a limited effect in reducing dye diffusion between cells; the reduction was elevated significantly with an increase in intracellular calcium concentration.  Calmodulin  Calmodulin (CaM) is a protein composed of 148 amino acids that plays both an intermediary and direct role in moderating gap junctions. Calmodulin acts as a regulator on membrane channels including both small and intermediate Ca2+-activated potassium ion channels, L-type Ca2+ channels, P/Q-type Ca2+ channels and sodium ion channels. All of these membrane channels can further influence cation concentrations, determining the electrochemical gradient of the cellular membrane, and affecting voltage gating. Calmodulin also acts directly on gap junctions through its two Ca2+ binding sites. With the binding of Ca2+, calmodulin goes through a conformational change that eventually blocks the gap junction‚Äôs channel, preventing the passage of cytoplasmic material. Likewise, while the inhibition of calmodulin expression increases the probability of gap junction closure, CaM-antagonist and CaM- blockers promote the opening of gap junctions. == Chemical modification == Chemical modification takes place on connexin proteins after their translation and typically involves changes in phosphorylation and ubiquitination, although nitrosylation, deamidation and hydroxylation have also been noted to be modifying processes. The implications of chemical modification vary widely depending on the functional group or protein that was added and the connexin proteins involved. Typically the changes occur in the development and lifecycle of the connexin protein or in the gating and structure of gap junctions themselves. === Mechanisms ===  Phosphorylation  Phosphorylation, the addition of a phosphate group, plays an important role in regulating both gap junctions and the subunits that form them. The gap junction protein connexin generally possesses a number of phosphorylation sites (connexin Cx43 has 21). The binding of phosphate to these sites can bring about various effects that influence aspects of the protein‚Äôs lifecycle. For example, phosphorylation of Cx43‚Äôs phosphorylation sites promote its trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. The subsequent oligomerization of this protein into hemichannels and the hemichannels into gap junctions is also induced by phosphorylation. Likewise, degradation can be initiated by phosphorylation as well as changes in gating, which determines the permeability of gap junctions. Phosphorylation of gap junctions and their subunits is typically achieved through protein kinases, enzymes that add phosphates to the amino acids of proteins. Serine/threonine kinases, which phosphorylate the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues, form the bulk of the Connexin phosphorylation kinases. These include protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase G (PKG), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), MAP kinase (MAPK) and casein kinase (CK). Kinase Src is the lone Tyrosine kinase that has been observed to phosphorylate connexins. Protein kinases vary in their targeted connections, specific sites of phosphorylation and phosphorylation effect. For example, PKA phosphorylation impacts both hemichannel and connexin activity. Here, neuronal hemichannel activity is suppressed by reducing permeability while connexins are affected by an increased trafficking and assembly into gap junctions. PKA activity is largely associated with an increased cAMP concentration. On the other hand, PKB phosphorylation can prevent the binding of the zonula occludens-1 protein, resulting in an increased gap junction size and hemichannel permeability. Its activity is usually in response to physiological changes such as wounding or hypoxia.  Ubiquitination  Ubiquitin is a small, long lived, globular protein that covalently bonds to lysine residues of target proteins in a process known as ubiquitination. Much like phosphorylation, it acts as a post-translational regulator for many proteins including connexin. Ubiquitination has been observed to be most involved in the final stages of the connexin protein‚Äôs lifecycle, regulating both Gap junction endocytosis and Connexin degradation. However, details of specific pathways and involved proteins are still being studied. The distinct effects of ubiquitination tend to vary widely, depending on the tissues and subcellular location where it occurs and the type of ubiquitin involved. For example, newly synthesized Cx43 in the endoplasmic reticulum can undergo polyubiquitination, resulting in recognition by proteasomes that carry out endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation (ERAD). Ubiquitination of Cx43 that is at the plasma membrane and organized into gap junctions will result in internalization, or endocytosis, followed by degradation of Cx43 by lysosomes.  Nitrosylation  Nitrosylation, the addition of a Nitric oxide (NO) group, has been demonstrated to have a substantial role in causing post translational modifications of both gap junction proteins and hemichannels. Nitrosylation can either be induced on the connexin proteins or proteins that further regulate connexin such as kinases. The type of nitrosylation that occurs is S-nitrosylation, the addition of a nitric oxide group to a cysteine thiol of a protein. Experiments regarding S-nitrosylation and the lifecycle of gap junctions suggest it has a role in regulating hemichannel trafficking and gap junction formation; addition of NO rapidly increased the level of Cx40 and Cx43 connexin at the plasma membrane as well as the formation of gap junctions in endothelial cells. The mechanism behind this phenomena is still unknown but the pro oxidant conditions induced by NO is thought to modulate the properties of the Golgi apparatus which is responsible for modifying and sorting proteins. == Related diseases == 244x244px === Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy === Electrical coupling among cardiac cells is crucial for a healthy heart, allowing the cardiac muscle fibers to contract normally. This coupling is done by gap junctions. Gap junctions permit the passive diffusion of materials‚Äìsuch as ions‚Äìacross the cytoplasm of one cell to another; this junction enables proper propagation of electrical impulses along cardiac cells. The genetic cardiac disease, Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (ACM), is marked by the reduced expression/number of the heart‚Äôs gap junctions, which can further lead to impaired function and ventricular arrhythmia. This disease results from an altered expression of proteins, including Neural Cadherin (CDH2) and Plakophilin-2 (PKP2), which naturally promote gap junction expression. Decreased CDH2 is found to reduce the expression of connexin 43 (Cx43), a major protein that promotes gap junction synthesis, further leading to a reduced conduction velocity of electrical impulses. Decrease in PKP2 also limits Cx43 expression, but only with a concurrent decrease in the reduction of N-Cadherin. === Liver diseases === As gap junctions have a major role in regulating the homeostasis of the liver, an abnormal expression of gap junctions can be a major contributor towards liver failure. Taking cirrhosis and acute liver failure (ACLF) for examples, an increased expression of hepatic connexin 43 is associated with severe inflammation. Conditions are worsened as the increased expression of Cx43 rapidly propagates death signals to neighboring cells, causing them to undergo apoptosis. === Gastrointestinal diseases === Just as with the heart, gap junctions play a significant role in mediating electrical signals within the intestines. Electrical signals are necessary for the synchronization of smooth muscles, buffering substrate concentrations, and mediating inflammation. As such, dysfunction of gap junctions leads to numerous symptoms such as gastrointestinal infections and inflammatory bowel disease. The pathogenesis of gap junctions varies between diseases. For inflammatory bowel disease, a decrease in gap junction expression disrupts junctional complexes among intestinal cells, leading to symptoms such as diarrhea and internal cramps. Less is known about the mechanism behind the pathogenesis of gap junctions in gastrointestinal infections, but the correlation is clear: infections are marked with increased Cx43 levels and their abnormal localization. == See Also == *Gap junction *Junctional complex == References == Category:Cell communication ","title":"Gap junction modulation"},{"id":"63783761","text":"The Inn at Lincoln Park is a hotel at 601 W.

Riemer was the oldest child in the family of a Berlin industrialist. A visit to the natural history museum in Berlin as a nine-year old with his grandfather fascinated him and he began to collect specimens. His interests overshadowed his studies and he did not do well in school. He took over the factory of his father and produced leather gloves, the largest such industry in Germany in the 1940s. On business trips he also collected items from other dealers and through collectors. He received more than 1000 ethnological artefacts from Africa through the zoologist Eugen Hintz. His collections included fossils, minerals, feathers, skulls, insects, shells and his private museum grew large. During World War II, air raids made him move his collections to his home in Sieversdorf and he rented barns of farmers and others to hide his collections but at least a third of it was destroyed. During the third Reich, Riemer was interested in caves and speleology. As a friend of Dr Benno Wolf, he was approached by the Gestapo to prevent the latter from destroying his life-long work with building a database on caves. Wolf was born in a Jewish family but had converted to Protestant Christianity but was nevertheless removed from his official positions and arrested. His death in a concentration camp was only determined after the war. Reimer took over Wolf's collections and manuscripts and bequeathed these materials to the Nuremberg Natural History Society in April 1947. Riemer also came in possession of the bird collections of Oscar Neumann, whom he helped escape to Cuba. Riemer was in contact with the Nazi leadership but he claimed not to be further involved however archival documents note that in 1841 Heinrich Himmler had appointed him as \\"Landesgruppenleiter Reich-Mitte\\", head of the association for cave specialists as well as head of propaganda. He was also a member of Hermann G√∂ring's society for the conservation of the European bison. Riemer signed several of his letters with \\"Heil Hitler\\".Kowa, G√ºnter (7-June-2019) Focus Online. Other researchers have found contradictory evidence where Riemer was classified as \\"politically unreliable\\" by the Nazis.Nils Seethaler hat zur Person Julius Riemer geforscht. Wittenberger Sonntag Magazin (10 June 2019). Riemer was a member of several learned societies. In 1947, following a suggestion from Otto Kleinschmidt two years earlier, he set up a museum of nature and ethnology at Wittenberg Castle. The museum was opened in 1949. It closed in 2011 and was reopened on the initiative of the Julius Riemer Circle of Friends (Freundeskreis Julius- Riemer-Sammlung) in 2018. Riemer married three times; his divorced his first wife Luzie in the 1930s while his second wife Hedwig died in 1945.

The business was formed in 1846 as a drapery, before going onto be owned by House of Fraser and eventually being rebranded as Rackhams as per House of Fraser's grouping of business in the 1970s. ==History== in 1813, Henry Morgan a draper based in Syston, on the outskirts of Leicester, recruited a young apprentice called William Squire from Heckington in Lincolnshire. By 1846 Morgan and Squire went into partnership and Morgan Squire & Co was created. The main store was located at the corner of Hotel Street and Millstone Lane, and sold a mixture of clothing and furniture with an upperclass feel like city rivals Adderlys and Joseph Johnson. The business remained in the Squire family, with Williams son Samuel taking over. His son Alfred Morgan Squire eventually took over the business before retiring early and selling it in 1928 to Standard Industrial Trust, an industrial conglomerate who had also purchased Cavendish House, Cheltenham's oldest department store in the same year. In 1961, a controlling interest in both Cavendish House Co Ltd and Morgan Squire Ltd was acquired by Swears & Wells Ltd (1926), a London-based company specialising in the development and sale of retail space, however a year later Bournemouth based retail chain J J Allen took control adding it to their other three department stores. In 1970 J J Allen were themselves purchased by House of Fraser, and in 1971 J J Allen's store group was split, with Dingles gaining the West Country department stores, while Morgan Squire was transferred to the Harrods grouping, and rebranded under the grouping name brand name of Rackhams. ==Family History== Samuel Squire, son of founder William, built his family home at 1 Salisbury Road in Leicester where he had 17 children with his wife, Anne Marie Starkey Gimson, daughter of renown industrial designer Ernest Gimson and part of the family that ran Gimson & Son, a Leicester-based engineering firm. 1 Salisbury Road has been part of the University of Leicester since 1948 when the building was purchased after the death of Anne Marie Squire, one of Samuels children. Samuel's brother Charles was a prominent lawyer and a member of the Leicester establishment, becoming a city councillor in 1908 and becoming the chairman of the Leicester Libraries and Museum committee, where he helped develop the UK's first Museum school service and saved historical buildings and made them into new museums.

Conan III had not honoured his promises of support, and Bernard asked the monks to return to Clairvaux, but first he met Conan III, who admitted his fault and gave the monks everything he had denied them. They then decided to stay. The abbey became rich, thanks to the salt trade,A. R. Bridbury, England and the Salt Trade in the Later Middle Ages (Clarendon Press, 1955), p. 71 commercial traffic on the River Loire, and many gifts of land and other property. In 1177, Robert II, bishop of Nantes, approved the addition of a convent for nuns. In 1180, Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Nantes, a son of Henry II of England, Duke of Normandy, and of Eleanor of Aquitaine, assigned to the abbey in perpetuity twenty livres to be paid by the mills of the surrounding parish. The vaulted cellars of the Abbey survive Chartres Cathedral With effect from 1474, commendatory abbots were appointed by the duke or king, replacing the regular abbots elected locally. During the War in the Vend√©e (March ‚Äì December 1793), following the French Revolution, Buzay Abbey was destroyed by fire. What now remains of the buildings is a tower which had been rebuilt in the 18th century, and some vaulted cellars. Other survivals are the bells, which were transferred to Chartres cathedral, an Italian marble altar, which was moved to the church of Saint-Louis in Paimb≈ìuf, a pulpit, now in the church of St Peter in Bouguenais, and some other objects, including the oldest crucifix in the Pays de Retz, dating from the fourteenth century, in the chapel of St Anne of Tharon at Saint-Michel- Chef-Chef. ==Daughter houses== Villeneuve Abbey, in an engraving of 1695 From Buzay, three new Cistercian abbeys were instituted as daughter houses. On 1 July 1172, Buzay sent a few monks to the small √éle du Pilier, north of Noirmoutier. However, the small windswept island posed so many problems for the new community that in 1205 the monks fell back on the island of Noirmoutier and founded the abbey of Our Lady the White.

The team headed by David Bache created an advanced coup√© with the V8 mounted in the middle, but offset to the right. The reason for this was that the gearbox was in front of the engine and this placement allowed the transaxle to be run on the side of the engine and thus making the car lower.

He received a cand.mag. in history from the University of Copenhagen in 1975. His book Lactantius the Historian was published in 1980. From 1989 to 1998, Christensen was a member of the Danish Historical Society. Christensen received his PhD in history from the University of Copenhagen in June 2002. His disputation was supervised by Ian N. Wood and Niels Lund. His thesis, Cassiodorus, Jordanes and the History of the Goths, concerned the reliability of Getica by Jordanes and the latters alleged chief source, the now lost Origo Gothica by Cassiodorus. In his thesis, Christensen claims that the Origo Gothica and Getica are entirely fabricated accounts without any foundation in Gothic oral tradition, being instead based upon a dubious synthesis of Greco-Roman sources. Christensen claims that the Greco-Romans knew nothing about the Goths until the 3rd century AD, and that archaeological evidence on Gothic origins is useless. On this account, Christensen recommended that the history of the migration period be rewritten. An English translation of Christensen's thesis was published in 2002 by Museum Tusculanum Press. Christensen's thesis has generated much interest among scholars. It was praised by Walter Goffart as a useful work. Anthropologist Peter S. Wells considered it a significant contribution to the study of ancient peoples of northern Europe. Ian N. Wood considered it an interesting work, although he thought Christensen went to far in denying Gothic elements in the texts. Sigbj√∏rn S√∏nnesyn considered Christensen's theories suspiciously similar to circular reasoning. Michael Whitby dismissed Christensen's work as extreme and a mere footnote to what has already been written on the subject. Dick Harrison considered Christensen's book interesting, although he criticized its rejection of archaeological evidence and refusal to respond to the views of dissenting scholars. ==Selected works== * Kristenforf√∏lgelserne i Rom indtil √•r 250, 1977 * Lactantius the Historian.

However, his name (Beaduheard means 'battle- hard') and position suggests that his family were of relatively high rank, from a martial background, and that he was over the age of 31, which is regarded as middle aged for the time. He was reeve during the reign of Beorhtric of Wessex, king of Wessex from 786 to 802. ==Death== The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for AD 789 reports: ::787 [789] Here Beorhtric took King Offa's daughter Eadburh. And in his days came first 3 ships from Hordaland: and then the reeve rode there and wanted to compel them to go to the king's town because he did not know who they were; and then they killed him. These were the first ships of the Danish men which sought out the land of the English race. √Üthelweard's version of the Chronicle, known as the Chronicon √Üthelweardi, a Latin translation of a lost version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, goes into more detail. He tells us that the three ships landed at Portland and that when Beaduheard heard of the their arrival he \\"leapt on his horse\\" and \\"sped to the harbour with a few men\\". He also claims that Beaduheard spoke to the arrivals in an \\"authoritative tone\\" and this is why they killed him. √Üthelweard was writing nearly 200 years after the event, sometime after 975 and probably before 983.Miller, Sean, \\"√Üthelweard\\" in The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England, ed. Michael Lapidge, 2001 His account is the first to name Beaduheard, however as his work was a Latin translation of a (now lost) Anglo-Saxon original, there is nothing to suggest that the name is incorrect. ==Aftermath== Four years later, in 793, a major Viking raid took place on the monastery of Lindisfarne in the kingdom of Northumberland. This has commonly been regarded as the start of the Viking raids on Britain. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Anglo-Saxon England Category:Anglo-Saxons killed in battle Category:Viking Age in the British Isles Category:Wessex Category:Year of birth missing Category:787 deaths Category:8th-century English people Category:8th century in England ","title":"Beaduheard"},{"id":"63784720","text":"Cannabis in Haiti is illegal with severe punishments for the production, sale, and possession of marijuana for medicinal or recreational purposes.

She promoted the work of the Chicago Imagists and outsider artists. ==Early life and family== Phyllis Kind was born Phyllis Barbara Cobin in The Bronx, New York City on 1 April 1933 to Harold Cobin, a dentist, and Dorothy (Weintraub) Cobin. She was their only child. The family lived in Brooklyn as well as The Bronx. She and her mother also lived for about three years in St. Petersburg, Florida while her father performed military service. She attended the Bronx High School of Science and the University of Pennsylvania, where she studied chemistry. Her studies included chemistry at the graduate level. She married Joshua Kind, whom she met at university, in 1956. The couple moved to New York City; Phyllis taught elementary school while Joshua pursued a PhD in Renaissance art at Columbia University. Phyllis also studied composition at the Mannes School of Music. They moved to Chicago in 1959; Joshua Kind taught at Northwestern University and, from 1962, the University of Chicago. Phyllis Kind received a master's degree in English literature from the University of Chicago. They had four children, Jonathan, Gabriel, Deborah, and Rachel. The couple divorced in the 1970s. ==Career== Encouraged by her husband, Phyllis Kind opened a gallery in Chicago in 1967. Called Pro Grafica Arte, the gallery dealt in master prints and drawings. In 1975, she opened a gallery on Spring Street in New York's SoHo district. The gallery moved to a larger, ground floor space on Greene Street in 1983. In 1998, Kind closed her Phyllis Kind Gallery in Chicago, located at 313 West Superior Street, in part as a result of the death of artist Roger Brown. For 25 years, Ron Jagger served as director of Phyllis Kind Gallery in New York. ==Artists represented== Phyllis Kind became interested in the contemporary art scene of Chicago, following the work of The Hairy Who and the Chicago Imagists. She gave some of the artists in the movement their first solo shows: Jim Nutt and Gladys Nilsson in 1970 and Roger Brown in 1971. Among others shown in her Chicago gallery were Barbara Rossi, Richard Hull, Robert Lostutter, Ed Paschke, Paul Sierra, Christina Ramberg, Karl Wirsum, and Joseph Yoakum. She also introduced the work of outsider artists. She was the first American gallerist to show contemporary and outsider work together. In 1972, Phyllis Kind presented her first group show of outsider art, \\"The Artless Artist: Contemporary 'Naive Works.\\" Over the years, Kind showed Chicago custodian Henry Darger, Mexican artist Mart√≠n Ram√≠rez (discovered by Nutt), and Europeans Adolf W√∂lfli, Augustin Lesage, Carlo Zinelli. She promoted and marketed the work of Georgian Howard Finster. She was an advisor to Sanford L. Smith & Associates' annual Outsider Art Fair since its inception in 1992, and traditionally occupied the first booth on the show floor. In New York, she mounted the first solo show for the miniaturist Mark Greenwold in 1979. Phyllis Kind sought out artists of originality who exhibited what she called \\"the art of necessity,\\" \\"making art not because they might want to but instead because they have to.\\" Among those were Alison Saar, Robert Colescott, William Copley, and Gillian Jagger. ==Later life and death== In 2009, Phyllis Kind closed her last gallery, a space in New York's Chelsea district that she had occupied since 2006. She died in San Francisco on 28 September 2018 of respiratory failure. The 2019 Outsider Art Fair featured a space curated by Edward M. G√≥mez as a memorial to Phyllis Kind. == References == ==External links== * Phyllis Kind Gallery * Video of Kind telling the story of opening her first gallery in Chicago * Transcript of interview with Rachel Sherman * Remembrance by Jerry Saltz * Gallery of images of Kind, artists, art Category:1933 births Category:2018 deaths Category:People from the Bronx Category:People from Manhattan Category:American art dealers Category:Women art dealers Category:The Bronx High School of Science alumni Category:University of Pennsylvania alumni ","title":"Phyllis Kind"},{"id":"63785232","text":"Hermann von Siebenthal (27 December 1934 - 31 March 2014) was a Swiss equestrian.

She founded Plate & Pitchfork, an on-farm pop-up dinner business, and helped lead the effort to lobby for governmental relief for small food-industry businesses during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. == Early life and education == Polmar grew up in a small town in Northeastern Ohio. Her family taught her it was \\"really important that we knew a carrot was a root. It was always a science experiment that seeds germinated‚Äîhow to plant the seed. And, how the fruit was born and what pollination was.\\" Polmar has a degree in communications from St. Louis University. She had no training in hospitality. == Career == After college Polmar sold advertising for the Willamette Week but was laid off and started working as a temp and then in event planning. After a personal tragedy she \\"quit her job, bought a jeep, and drove all over the Northwest\\" before returning to Portland and working for a while in tech before being laid off after 9/11. Days after the layoff she was working at a winery sorting grapes when she learned that a group of Portland chefs were planning a fundraiser for children orphaned by the terrorist attacks and needed an organizer. She managed the event, Flux, which was a success, and through the experience made contacts in the local food and wine industry. She planned further events, and in the process learned from Emily Berreth, who was working with her, about al fresco community suppers that Berreth had attended on agricultural estates in Italy. Polmar realized that Portland's mild climate would work for similar events. She approached several farmers, who told her they'd love to have on-farm dinners but were too busy farming to plan the events. She was also concerned about a general disconnect between Americans and their food which she thought such events could help to remedy. She envisioned using the events as fundraisers benefiting food insecurity non-profits. Polmar started hosting the dinners with Berreth in 2003, holding three small events and charging diners $75. They founded Plate & Pitchfork to produce the events. By 2008 the dinners were $90 to $150, depending on whether the events were fundraisers. In 2010 Berreth stepped away from the project. By 2012 Polmar was holding 17 dinners, each dinner was serving 120 diners, and she had added hands-on cooking class events and rafting trips with chef-prepared local foods. By 2014 there were up to 18 each summer, priced at $125 to $135, and some were selling out within minutes of tickets being released. By 2018 Plate & Pitchfork was charging diners $120 to $150 and donating $15,000 - $22,000 per year to nonprofits addressing food- insecurity. Each dinner is held outdoors in a local farmer's field and features a menu planned and prepared by two local chefs using product from that farm and wines from a local winery. Menus aren't set until shortly before the event so that the farmers know what will be ready for harvest. The events begin with appetizers and a tour of the farm by the farmer and consist of a four or five-course meal with wine pairings. Meals are served family style at long tables with linens, china, and glassware. Reuters in 2008 named the dinners to their list of World's 10 Best Secret Dining Clubs. During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic Polmar led local and national efforts to lobby local, state, and federal governments for relief for small food-related businesses in the Northwest and the US. She was a founding member and leadership team member of the Independent Restaurant Coalition. In March 2020 she had \\"pressed pause\\" on planning the Plate & Pitchfork dinners.

The printing studio was ran by a feminist collective and produced material that aimed to combat sexist images of women and contribute towards the visual culture of the Women's Liberation Movement. The workshop was founded by Pru Stevenson, Julia Franco and Suzy Mackie. Over 16 years, more than 40 women joined the workshop. They produced a range of printed material, primarily posters, as well as calendars and t-shirts. The workshop closed in 1990 due to financial reasons. Partly this was due to changes in the printing industry. Screen printing had become expensive, so the printed material did not cover running costs anymore. == Themes == The themes touched on in the See Red posters were intimately connected with feminist issues, but they ranged widely. They included topics such as reproductive rights, women's refuges, women's liberation, racism, socialist feminism, violence against women, black women's rights, support for jailed women and lesbian rights. == Funding == The workshop was initially funded by the sale of printed material and community donations. These were barely enough to cover the bills, and the workshop often found itself in the position of appealing for funds from the women's movement and individual supporters. Between 1982 and 1986 See Red was funded by the Labour controlled Southwark Council and the newly formed Women's Committee of the Greater London Council. The funding enabled the women to be paid a wage and improve their printing equipment. == Equipment == The initial equipment was simple. Early posters were screen printed using paper stencils or blocking out. These methods were preferred since they needed the minimum of equipment, which ensured that the shop could be set up almost anywhere. By 1978, the workshop had a darkroom and started including photographs in its designs. == Locations == The workshop moved locations several times. It was founded at 18 Camden Road, London, in the shop premises occupied by the Camden Tenants Association. In 1975, it moved to South London Women's Centre, which was located in a squat on Radnor Terrace off South Lambeth Road, Vauxhall. Between 1977 and 1984, the workshop rented premises in Iliffe Yard, a derelict mews off the Walworth Road in South London. The feminist offset-litho printers Women in Print had a workshop opposite and the two groups shared a darkroom. The final move, along with Women in Print was in 1984, to Southwark Council owned premises behind a petrol station in nearby Camberwell Road. The workshop was attacked on various occasions by the National Front, a fascist and white supremacist political group. == References == Category:Feminism Category:Graphic design Category:Printers Category:Women printers Category:Self-organization ","title":"See Red Women's Workshop"},{"id":"63785448","text":"Lorenzo Burghardt is a 1918 German silent film directed by William Wauer and starring Albert Bassermann, Elsa Bassermann and K√§the Haack.Grange p.10 ==Cast== * Albert Bassermann * Elsa Bassermann * Emilie Croll * K√§the Haack * Paul Rehkopf ==References== ==Bibliography== * Grange, William.

His parents ran a general store. His mother, sister of the renowned musicologist Alfred Heu√ü, encouraged his artistic inclinations and he received his first piano and music lessons. At an early age the son of a merchant showed his musical interest by composing small choral pieces. After a long struggle for his father's permission, he studied composition (with Sigfrid Karg-Elert) and musicology (with Hermann Abert and Arnold Schering) at the State University of Music and Performing Arts Stuttgart from 1919 to 1921 and then in Leipzig from 1921 to 1923. After completing his studies, he embarked on a momentous trip to Italy in 1924, visiting Sicily, Rome, Naples and Florence, during which he was greatly impressed by Italian architecture and painting. In the Uffizi he could see original compositions by Carlo Gesualdo. They inspired him to \\"Four Italian Madrigals\\", which were performed in 1925 at the Donaueschinger Musiktage and made him suddenly famous. From 1924 he was editor and correspondent of the \\"Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik\\", whose publisher was his uncle Alfred Heu√ü. In 1929 he became editor at the Leipzig music publishing house Edition Peters where he was appointed chief editor for the first time in the history of the publishing house in 1956. In addition to publications, he supervised the \\"Peters-Nachrichten\\", co-founded the \\"Deutsches Jahrbuch f√ºr Musikwissenschaft\\" and after 1945 expanded the profile of the publishing house to include contributions from contemporary music.

The pathogen can cause a diarrheic disease in cattle (Bos taurus) referred to as either eimeriosis or coccidiosis. The infection predominantly cause disease in younger animals. == Description== Eimeria bovis is a host specific parasite that is shed by infected cattle. The parasite enters the cattle via contaminated food, water or surfaces contaminated infective (sporulated) oocysts (fecal-oral-route). In the gut environment of the animal the oocysts hatch and releases 8 zoites. The zoites undergo two asexual cycles (schizogony). The first cycle produces many small schizonts inside the cells of the lamina propria, while the second generation of schizonts multiply in the cells of the epithelium. The second generation of schizonts undergo a sexual cycle (gametogony). The multiplication growth of new oocysts cause the destruction of mucosal cells which coincide with diarrhea in the animal. The time from ingestion of the parasite to the first signs of disease (prepatent period) is 16‚Äì21 days. The disease usually last 5‚Äì15 days (patent period). Oocysts can be observed in a microscope measuring 23‚Äì43 ¬µm x 17‚Äì23 ¬µm, ovoid shape, having a double-layered wall with a micropyle in the narrower end. ==Diagnosis== The infection status of an animal is evaluated by examining the oocysts using different flotation methods, usually by counting the oocysts under a light microscope and identifying the species of the Eimeria based on morphology. When evaluating if the animal is having eimeriosis, due to infection with E. bovis or other pathogenic Eimeria species such as Eimeria zuernii or Eimeria alabamensis, four things are taken into account: age of the animal, presence of a pathogenic Eimeria species, infection intensity (oocysts per gram faeces), and presence of symptoms (diarrhea, blood in the faeces, loss of appetite, fever, weight loss). ==Epidemiology== After new oocysts have been shed in the faeces of an infected animal factors in the environment affect how fast the oocysts sporulate and become infective. Outdoor environment, buildings and management (handling and density of animals, hygiene) can affect these conditions. When conditions favor sporulation of the oocysts the may become infective before the faeces are removed. Pathogenic Eimeria species, including E. bovis, can cause two types of epidemiological situations in a herd that also can manifest as a diasease outbreak: Winter coccidiosis/eimeriosis ‚Äì animals becoming more susceptibile to infections due to cold and crowding of the animals facilitate the spread (housing of cattle at the end of a pasture season). Summer coccidiosis/eimeriosis ‚Äì susceptible animals ingesting overwintering oocysts on pastures on turn-out and increased sporulation of new oocysts due to increasing temperatures. Eimeria bovis overwinter well in both soil and in faeces in temperate regions, and oocysts shed in the fall have a better chance of surviving until the next grazing season. Areas with shade on the pasture improve the survival chances of the oocyst. Predominantly calves are at risk. Outbreaks can result in high mortalities among young animals. Disease most commonly result in weight loss that can delay growth of the animal and affect the success as a production animal. ==Immunology== Following the initial infection with an Eimeria species the animal usually is protected by immunity to that species, and is less likely to develop disease. The level of immunity depend on the amount of oocysts that infected the animal. ==Response to environmental factors== The majority of the parasites life is in the environment, and both survival of the parasite as well as developing into an infective oocysts depends on these factors. The time from when the parasite has left the animal in the faeces inside an oocyst and has developed in to a parasite that can infect new animals, is called the sporulation time. Temperatures above 15 degrees Celsius and humidity above 80% are favorable conditions that lowers the time for the oocyst to become infective, which can lead to regular outbreaks of coccidiosis. == References == Category:Conoidasida Category:Veterinary protozoology ","title":"Eimeria bovis"},{"id":"63785828","text":"The Zaarden Brothers (German: Die Br√ºder von Zaarden) is a 1918 German silent drama film directed by William Wauer and starring Albert Bassermann, Elsa Bassermann and Marija Leiko.Bock & Bergfelder p.28 ==Cast== * Albert Bassermann * Elsa Bassermann * Marija Leiko ==References== ==Bibliography== * Bock, Hans-Michael & Bergfelder, Tim.

Orosz is one of only two babies known to have been born in the Auschwitz complex and survive to liberation. She has taken it upon herself to be the voice of those children who did not survive the concentration camps. Her testimony has led to the 21st century convictions of several former Nazis. == Early life == === Birth parents === Orosz-Richt's parents, Dr. Avraham (Tibor) Bein (born June 2, 1912) and Vera (Veronika) Otvos (born April 2, 1920, Budapest), were Hungarian Jews. They married in March 1943, in Sarospatak, in northwest Hungary, where Avraham lived and Vera was working as a nanny. During the Nazi cleansing of Hungary in 1944, they were sent by cattle car on the day after Passover to the nearby S√°toralja√∫jhely ghetto, and on May 22, on another cattle car to Auschwitz- Birkenau, where they arrived on May 25. === Concentration camp === Both went through the selection process upon entering Auschwitz, and were deemed fit for the work camps. Otvos-Bein was pregnant with Angela at the time, which should have been an immediate death sentence during selection. Naively, her mother thought that her pregnancy would elicit sympathy, and told Josef Mengele about her pregnancy. He laughed, calling her a \\"stupid goose,\\" and apparently did not believe her, sending her to the work camp instead of the gas chamber. She had prisoner number A6075 tattooed on her wrist. Orosz-Richt's father, Tibor, died of exhaustion a few months later at age 32, but her mother survived. She went through various work programs. Road construction proved too much for her in her pregnancy, and she told a prisoner in charge (the Blockaelteste) that she was pregnant, and was sent to work in the kitchen instead. There, late in her pregnancy, Mengele took her into the medical experimentation unit. He injected various poisons into her cervix. These left Otvos-Bein sterile, but did not kill the fetus. A Jewish camp doctor tried to convince the mother-to- be to abort the child, but Vera's mother appeared in a dream telling her that, \\"Hashem (G-d) is with you,\\" and she decided to keep the child. When Otvos-Bein went into labor, she confided in another Blockaelteste, whose position and medical knowledge, gained from her own father's medical practice, allowed her to assist efficaciously in the delivery. Due to the malnutrition and medical experimentation suffered by Otvos-Bein, the baby was severely underweight, about 2.5 lbs (a little over one kilogram), and too weak to audibly cry. This probably saved their lives. Vera Otvos-Bein returned to work two to three hours later, hiding her baby under rubbish, and nursing her for about a month until the camp was liberated by Allied forces. Otvos-Bein also breastfed another baby born at the camp two days before liberation, Gy√∂rgy Faludi. They were the only two camp births known to survive, according to Auschwitz museum records. === Post-war === Shortly after liberation, Orosz-Richt's mother met Sandor Polgar, another survivor, a widower with a surviving son, Ted Bolgar. The Polgar/Bolgar family was originally from Sarospatak, the hometown of Angela's biological father. Polgar helped Vera Orosz obtain a birth certificate for Angela, and the two were married. He died in 1957; Angela Orosz claims he died from the stress of anti-semitism that was still openly exhibited in Hungary after the war. They spent several months in the DP Camp at Sluzk. The four of them returned to Budapest in November 1945, where Otvos- Bein's mother had survived the war, hidden in a printing camp. Angela only attained a typical newborn weight of about 6.5 pounds (three kilograms) by her first year. Her mother was the only person who was convinced that she would live. Even her grandmother, who called her Varushka, thought she would die. Her legs were too weak to support her until age seven, and she remained fragile and very short her entire life. When she started school, she complained to her mother that she wanted her recorded place of birth changed, because writing Auschwitz was too hard to spell (only later would she think about it as too hard an association). Her mother refused, telling her that it was her legacy, and she would grow to explain to people what that meant. It was a mission that she would ultimately fulfill late in her life. == Adult life == === Parenthood and emigration === Orosz-Richt became a schoolteacher. She married Joseph Orosz in 1965, and had a daughter, Katy. Her young family fled communist Hungary in December 1973, on the pretext of visiting her mother Vera, who had moved to Montreal in 1966 to help her stepson, Ted Bolgar. Orosz arrived in Toronto on December 11, and continued raising her family and teaching in Canada. She bore a son in Montreal in 1982, the last of her two children. She moved to Montreal to be close to her daughter. , she continues to live there, in an assisted living complex. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she complained about the isolation, as she is a \\"social butterfly.\\" Some details of the history are known to her through a recording daughter Katy made during a high school project, of a telephone interview with her grandmother, Vera. Katy went on to earn a doctorate in cancer research form McGill University. She took up the profession due to Vera's death from cancer on January 28, 1992. Her daughter claims that she pushed herself to live one extra day to avoid dying on the date of the Auschwitz liberation. Orosz' son lives in New Jersey, but her daughter === Activism === Orosz did not start talking publicly about the Holocaust until age 60. She first visited her birthplace in 2015, when she was 70. She noted her discomfort with traveling to Auschwitz in comfortable business class, with an entourage, compared to her parents' trip to Auschwitz on a prisoner train. The same year, she testified against Oskar Groening, accountant of Auschwitz. In court, she stated that she could not remain silent, as she survived while other voices were stilled. He received a four-year prison sentence. She testified a year later against a camp guard, Reinhold Hanning. He received a five year sentence. She returned to Auschwitz again for the 75th liberation anniversary. == References == == External links == *Canadian Television News (CTVN) has an extensive set of interviews with Orosz.

The flowers of this unusual plant are pollinated by non-flying mammals: rodents and elephant shrews. In the Afrikaans language it is known as gesigtoehouprotea or skaamroos. ==Taxonomy== The German horticulturalist, botanical collector and explorer Johann Franz Dr√®ge collected the first scientific specimen of this species in December 1830 at a place called 'Ezelsbank' (possibly a farm), in the area of the town of Clanwilliam, at on a rocky eastern flank of a krantz in the Cederberg range, through where he travelled during one of his expeditions throughout South Africa. Protea recondita was apparently first named and identified as a new species by , but the name was an invalid nomen nudum because it was not published with a formal species description, but only existed as a name on the lables of herbarium specimens. Dr√®ge himself may have been the first to actually publish the name in his 1843 work Zwei pflanzengeographische Documente, which detailed where and when he collected what during his botanical journeys, but it was Carl Meissner who in 1856 finally validated the name with a description in the Prodromus, a book series of botanic taxonomy begun by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle. ===Type=== Dr√®ge made a number of different exsiccata specimen sheets from his Ezelsbank collection, and these he traded or sold across Europe. In Britain, for example, a sheet found its way into respectively both the herbaria of George Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker at Kew. ===Etymology=== The local Afrikaans vernacular name skaamroos translates as 'shy' or 'bashful' 'rose', and likely refers to the inflorescences, which are hidden by the leaves which fold over and around it. The name gesigtoehouprotea translates as 'face-withholding protea'. ==Description== === Habitus === Protea recondita is a sprawling shrub up to across and in height. The branches are glaucous and glabrous. Protea recondita habitus in the autumn, in situ on the slopes of the Sneeuberg in the Cederberg Wilderness Area in April === Leaves === It has large, thick, glaucous and glabrous leaves. These leaves are in length and broad at the widest parts, although they are only 4.2mm wide at the base (where they connect to the petiole). The shape of the leaves is obovate and cuneate, and the ends of the leaves are rounded (obtuse). The leaves are distinctly veined. === Flowers === The small flowers (called florets) are clustered together in a special structure containing a few hundred blooms. Unlike most rodent-pollinated proteas, in P. recondita this inflorescence, or more specifically a pseudanthia (also called a 'flower head'), is apical, budding from the tops of the stems as opposed to from their sides. The flower head is furthermore sessile, which means it has no stalk (a 'peduncle'), but arises directly from the leafy branch. The head is globose in shape, in length, and about in diameter. The glabrous involucral bracts are arranged in a series of seven to eight rows. The outer bracts are ovate and somewhat acuminate in shape, and have an almost round apex ('subobtuse'). The inner bracts are oblong in shape and slightly convex, and equal in length to the actual flowers. It is monoecious, both sexes occur in each flower. The petals and sepals of the florets are fused into a tube-like, 25.5mm long perianth-sheath which is glabrous, except for a few reddish hairs near the lip. This sheath is dilated, having three keels and five veins on the lower part. The sheath has a lip which is 6.5mm long. The lip is glabrous or sometimes sparingly setulose (with bristly hairs). All of the stamens are fertile. The filament is 0.28mm long, broad and thin. The anthers are linear-elliptic and 4.2mm long. The apical glands are 0.28mm in length, ovate in shape and with a somewhat rounded tip (subobtuse). The ovary is 8.5mm long, oblanceolate in outline, and covered in long, reddish-brown hairs. The upper part of the ovary is swollen. The style is pallid in colour, compressed, glabrous, over in length, 2.1mm wide but tapers from the base, and becomes falcate after arising from a short, almost straight base. The grooved stigma is 3.2 to 4.2mm long, linear, with an obtuse (blunt) end, and almost imperceptibly joins together and becomes the style. The blooms are produced at the ends of the erect branches in the winter, mostly in May to July, sometimes extending to September. As the inflorescence begins to bud, the surrounding leaves on the stem below it grow to curve over and around the flower head, enfolding it like those of a cabbage, so as to completely hide it from view. The flowers, or more specifically the nectar, exude an odd, not unpleasant, yeasty odour, with a sweetish scent superimposed. === Fruit === Although an inflorescence contains many hundreds of florets, most proteas commonly have an infructescence with only a very low seed set, around 10%, or usually less than two dozen seeds. In this species, however, the seed set was found to be respectively 29% and 18% from two populations (Sneeubergnek, Murray Farm) of which ten and eleven heads were sampled. These two populations had respectively 258 florets per flower head (with a range of 118 to 379), and 393 (338 to 436), on average. ===Similar species=== According to Meissner in 1856 it is most similar to Protea grandiceps, especially in leaf-form, but with a smaller flower head. P. foliosa, which occurs further to the east, also has terminal flower heads which are somewhat wrapped by the surrounding and subtending leaves and bracts, but in this species the heads are bourne low to the ground. ==Distribution== The species is endemic to the Western Cape province of South Africa. The range of this species stretches from the Piketberg and Cederberg in the north, southwards to the Groot Winterhoek, and apparently even further south to the Koue Bokkeveld Mountains. The species is known to occur at much more than ten localities. Although it occurs in a total area of 4,008 km¬≤, the territory where it actually grows, the area of occupancy, only stretches across 272 km¬≤ within this. The Piketberg is an inselberg; a single, tiny population is found atop it, which as of 2004 only consists of only two individual plants. ==Ecology== The leaves of Protea recondita curve over the flower heads of the plant as they mature, completely covering it -the photographer is holding them away in this photograph. This is thought to be an evolutionary adaption to hide the flowers from birds and insects; the preferred pollinators, rodents, do not use sight to find the flowers, but smell. Most proteas experience only little incidence of insect seed predation. ===Habitat=== This species is mostly found growing on rocky slopes near mountain summits, at between 1,000 and 2,000 metres, or 800 and 1,800 in altitude. The only habitat where it grows is otherwise montane fynbos on sandstone-derived soils. The plants are rare and scattered in the rocky habitats most especially found in the north of its range, but in the Groot Winterhoek mountains in the south of its range it is found in open habitat in which it may form isolated, but locally dominant, dense clumps. It was first collected together at Ezelsbank with the fynbos shrubs Elytropappus spinellosus, Oedera sedifolia, Passerina rigida (unlikely), Phylica capitata, Pteronia fasciculata, Rafnia ovata and Stoebe aethiopica; the herbs Agathelpis brevifolia, Agathosma sp., Hydrocotyle sp., Pelargonium patulum, Pharnaceum serpyllifolium, Pseudoselago guttata and an Othonna-like plant; a succulent Crassula sp.; the bulb Ornithogalum thyrsoides; the restios Restio laniger and Thamnochortus sp.; the grass Pentameris malouinensis; and the ferns Anemia caffrorum and Lomaria pumila. At the same locality, Murray Farm, P. recondita grows together with P. effusa, P. laurifolia and P. pendula. At the Sneeubergnek locality it grows together with P. cryophila and P. punctata. ===Pollination=== Although a 1998 source stated that the flowers are pollinated by birds, other sources claim it is pollinated by rodents. In 1977 the botanists Delbert Wiens and John Patrick Rourke first proposed this pollination method in certain Protea species. In a 1980 magazine article Rourke explained his theory that the peculiarly hidden flower heads had evolved this trait in response to using rodents as pollination vectors, thus constituting a special class of pollination syndrome. Because the rodents are primarily nocturnal creatures that find their food using their sense of smell rather than their sense of sight, the flower heads are not required to be showy. Furthermore, by hiding the flower heads in such a manner, the plants' chosen rodent pollinators are protected from predation by owls. The data on this species is somewhat murky, but it appears that this is a species which primarily opens its florets at night, likely also to accommodate the pollinators. The peculiar yeasty odour of the nectar becomes stronger at night, is thought to furthermore be a specially evolved attribute which attracts rodent pollinators. The nectar of most such proteas is copious and extremely sweet, which attracts the rodents, but it also low in protein and not very nutritious, and functions more like 'junk-food' or candy. The scent is so seductive for small mammals that even gerbils (Gerbilliscus afra), which are not known as nectar-feeders, caught from areas where such proteas do not grow, are readily attracted to the rodent-pollinated protea flower heads as opposed to those of bird-pollinated proteas when experimentally exposed to both. Rodents in captivity which were fed a diet of only nectar died after five days. The amount of nectar produced by a particular population is only sufficient to sustain the local rodents for several days a year. Despite all the adaptations the plant has made, the pollinators are not dependant on the plants, nor do they appear to be specifically evolved to take advantage of the plants, instead Wiens et al. suggest that the evolution which has occurred is unilateral on the part of the plant. Of the dozen or more species of rodent- pollinated proteas, P. recondita is the only species with non-geoflorous flower heads -instead bearing them above it in the air at the end of the erect branches, to have evolved such a system of enfolding leaves, which make the flower head 'cryptic'. This indicates it evolved non-flying mammal pollination independently from the other proteas growing in the area which have also adopted this method of transporting pollen. In 1983 Wiens, Rourke and colleagues had the results of their research on the subject published. The small mammal species Aethomys namaquensis, Myomyscus verreauxii, Rhabdomys pumilio and Elephantulus edwardii were caught in almost equal amounts in traps in P. recondita shrubs, and all four species have been experimentally confirmed to feed on and pollinate Protea florets in the laboratory. E. edwardii, which is in fact not a rodent but an elephant shrew, only licked the tops of the flower heads, but is thought to thus likely pollinate the florets anyway. E. edwardii and the diurnal mouse Rhabdomys pumilio were captured with large amounts of pollen in faecal samples taken directly from the colon, which likely was due to ingestion during the grooming of their snouts. Faecal pellets, also containing pollen, of these creatures was the only defecation found in the flower heads of this Protea, which due to the terminal placements and protected nature of the heads can only come from frequent and relatively long visits of animals crawling inside the flower. Aethomys and Rhabdomys have been caught and seen higher up in the branches of rodent-pollinated proteas, and thus may be better at pollinating specifically this protea. Rodent pollinators may sometimes nibble on the bracts and styles of flower heads, destroying a percentage of the structure on a number of inflorescences, R. pumilio appears to be most likely responsible for this. ===Wildfires=== The adult plants are killed by the wildfires which periodically move through its habitat, but the seeds can survive such an event. After the flowers are pollinated, the mature fruit is retained in the infructescence: fire-resistant seed heads which are persistently retained for a few years on the plant. When they are eventually released after fires, the seeds are dispersed by the wind. ==Gallery== File:Protea recondita botaneek iNat11084482.jpg Protea recondita File:Protea recondita Chris Vynbos iNat34060958.jpg Protea recondita File:Protea recondita Chris Vynbos iNat34060958b.jpg Protea recondita File:Protea recondita mr fab inat37367850a.jpg Protea recondita File:Protea recondita mr fab inat37367850b.jpg Protea recondita File:Protea recondita vynbos iNat16257464a.jpg Protea recondita File:Protea recondita vynbos iNat16257464b.jpg Protea recondita File:Protea recondita linkie iNat18555525c.jpg Protea recondita File:Protea recondita linkie iNat18555525d.jpg Protea recondita ==Conservation== Protea recondita is a locally common species in the southern third of its range, but the numbers of the total population are thought to be decreasing, because certain northern subpopulations are declining. According to the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) in 2019, it is especially threatened by habitat fragmentation from natural reasons, as well as possibly too frequent wildfires, overgrazing by livestock and invasive plants, although none of these threats are considered severe. Although they considered the species to be too common to classify the conservation status as 'vulnerable', SANBI concluded that the above threats were implicit enough to warrant an assessment of 'near threatened' for the Red List of South African Plants. It was first assessed by SANBI for this list in 2009, also as 'near threatened'. In 2005 Bomhard et al. predicted, based on their reading of models projecting the effects of climate change, that many species of Proteaceae would be extinct by 2020, but that P. recondita would have been one of the few species which would expand its distribution. Needless to say, as of 2020, the predictions of Bomhard et al. have proved somewhat inaccurate. In the past, a very small part of its historic range (4%) was sacrificed to the development of fruit orchards, but agriculture is no longer considered a threat for the survival of the species, because most of the remaining range is within protected areas. Visitors to the Sneeuberg mountain in the Cederberg Wilderness Area can see the species protected in situ. Although in the south the species grows in dense clumps, the natural habitat fragmentation is especially prevalent in the northern 50% or so of its range, a region spanning a distance of some 70 km. This is due to erosion, which will slowly cause this species' habitat to shrink over the next few dozen million years. The ten subpopulations from the Cederberg range and the population on the Piketberg are small, isolated, and furthermore declining for unknown reasons. Five of these subpopulations consist of only a single plant, the Piketberg population consists of two plants, the other five number 3 to 140 individuals. ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== * recondita Category:Flora of the Cape Provinces ","title":"Protea recondita"},{"id":"63786110","text":"J√≥zsef Horv√°th (born 9 June 1947) is a Hungarian equestrian.

Gillian Hughes (Edinburgh, 2003), xi‚Äíxix. Matters reached a head in 1830 when Hogg's financial situation became precarious with the expiration of his tenancy of the Mount Benger farm. Blackwood continuing unresponsive, Hogg apparently concluded an agreement in late 1831 with the London publisher James Cochrane, for a sequence of twelve volumes appearing every other month in imitation of Walter Scott's immensely successful magnum opus Waverley Novels. Unfortunately Cochrane failed a few days after the publication of the first volume in April 1832 and Hogg was unable to find a replacement.Ibid., xix‚Äíxxix. ==Editions== Altrive Tales: Collected among the Peasantry of Scotland, and from Foreign Adventurers.

The measures were announced in April 2020 to help stop the spread of coronavirus during the current pandemic. ==Background== House leaders rehearse hybrid procedures, 20 April There were worries that the spread of Covid-19 would be accelerated by the number of people working in the Parliamentary Estate, including 650 Members of Parliament, around 800 peers and over 3000 members of staff. In addition, some of these members and staff have underlying health conditions, and many (especially peers) are over 70 years of age, putting them at higher risk according to the Government's advice. This posed a challenge, as - by law - votes, debates and meetings in parliament must take place in person. Coronavirus had already interrupted the work of Parliament, after some MPs and staff caught the virus and were forced to self isolate. Because of this, the Houses of Parliament were closed to visitors on 17 March. Some Select Committees had started to hold meetings behind closed doors, and limits on questions and the number of members allowed in the House of Commons chamber began to be introduced. After lockdown measures were announced by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on 23 March, the House of Commons passed through emergency legislation designed to combat Covid-19, including measures such as the power to close non-essential businesses, restrict public events, and detain anyone judged to pose a risk of spreading the virus. The bill passed through the Commons on 23 March, before being sent to the House of Lords on 24 March and gaining royal assent on 25 March. After the emergency measures bill was passed, the Leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg presented a motion stating that parliament would break early for Easter recess on 25 March, and not reopen until 21 April. ==Preparation== Many possibilities of what could be changed after recess were discussed. Options included: * Postponing non-essential business * Taking more votes orally, without the need to call a division * Letting MPs ask questions via a proxy * Reducing the number of MPs legally required to be present in order for votes to take place. There was even speculation that parliament would be shut down for longer than the agreed Easter recess. Some Members of Parliament, including the Liberal Democrats' acting leader Ed Davey, were unhappy that they did not have a mechanism to scrutinise the Government's response to the pandemic during recess. One hundred opposition MPs later wrote a letter to the Clerk of the House of Commons John Benger to seek support in establishing a virtual parliament. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, had suggested extending divisions to 40 minutes to allow MPs to vote in smaller groups, and the parties had already agreed to limit the number of divisions that were called on legislation. The chair of the House of Commons Procedure Committee, Karen Bradley, wrote a letter to Hoyle stating that delaying or reducing divisions was unsustainable, and that the members of her committee were worried that MPs would be less able to express their opinions. During the recess, the House of Commons digital services team had been working to implement technology to enable sittings to take place virtually, and on 16 April the House of Commons Commission announced that parliament would move to 'hybrid proceedings', with provision for up to 50 MPs in the House of Commons chamber and a further 120 contributing remotely via Zoom, a video-conferencing facility. ==Implementation== Procedure Committee Report for the remote participation Parliament resumed on 21 April, with a limited number of MPs attending in person to pass the legislation to implement the new system. The Commons chamber was fitted with TV screens to enable sitting members to view those attending virtually, and party whips discouraged MPs from attending in person. The hybrid set-up only includes statements, urgent questions and Prime Minister's Questions, but the House of Commons Commission said that the system would be extended to debates should the system \\"be judged satisfactory and sustainable\\". In May 2020, this was extended to include remote voting. Lindsay Hoyle has said that the measures would only be temporary, despite some pressure to reform parliament's procedures. He also stated that members should dress appropriately and be aware of their surroundings when participating online. On Wednesday 22 April 2020, the House of Commons sat virtually for the first time in its 700-year history. Leader of the Opposition Keir Starmer made his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, against Dominic Raab, who was deputising for the Prime Minister. MPs who were in the chamber had to conform to strict social distancing measures, including sitting at least 2 metres apart. Other MPs were able to phone in from home, despite some technical issues. The former Scottish Secretary David Mundell was \\"unable to connect\\", and Conservative backbencher Peter Bone was muted when he lost connection. Some security concerns were raised about the use of Zoom, but the House of Commons Commission said that they had been advised by the National Cyber Security Centre that Zoom would be appropriate ‚Äúif the installation and the use of the service is carefully managed‚Äù. MPs later voted to implement remote voting technology, despite issues relating to verification and security. Speaker Lindsay Hoyle stressed that the measures would be temporary, but the SNP's Tommy Sheppard suggested that it should be used as part of a move to fully-virtual sittings. MPs trialled the technology by participating in mock votes, including questions such as \\"That this house prefers Spring to Autumn\\". After the proposals were endorsed by the Procedure Committee, the first virtual vote took place on 11 May 2020, to pass a motion to renew the hybrid proceeding measures. This was followed the next day by a vote on an amendment to the Agriculture Bill, where a number of MPs voted against the bill by mistake, including the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak. This led Labour's Shadow Environment Secretary Luke Pollard to ask the Government's deputy chief whip Stuart Andrew \\"How many members of the Cabinet voted the wrong way?\\", to which Andrew replied: \\"Just the one. He's a very busy man\\". == Suspension and return to physical proceedings == On 12 May, Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg announced that Parliament would move back to meeting in person \\"as quickly as possible\\" after the Whitsun recess on 2 June. He stated that MPs should \\"set an example\\" and return to working in Westminster, as the Government had recently announced that certain groups of people may restart work from 13 May. This was met with widespread anger from opposition parties, with a Labour spokesperson stating that it contravened the Government's own public health advice, as the message was still to work from home if possible. In addition, it was pointed out that MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would be contravening rules set out by their respective devolved governments, which require the public to stay at home; and even if the law changed, it would be very difficult to get to London due to the geographical distance and lack of transport services. Despite this, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said that he would travel down from his Dumfries and Galloway constituency to take departmental questions, stating that his position as a key worker allowed him to do so, and that the Palace of Westminster was being made \\"Covid-safe\\". The Government later defended its decision, stating that the measures were only ever intended to be temporary; and the current arrangements did not allow for sufficient scrutiny, nor did they allow for the government to progress its legislative programme. The next day, Speaker Lindsay Hoyle put the Government's hopes of reintroducing a physical parliament into doubt, when he told MPs that he would suspend sittings if social distancing were not adhered to. He also said that voting would take longer if it had to take place in person, in some cases up to an hour. This was welcomed by some opposition MPs, who pointed out that the government was only intending to reopen parliament in order for backbench MPs to support Johnson at Prime Minister's Questions, as he was seen by many to be struggling without a supportive crowd. === Return to Westminster === Despite Hoyle's warning, the Government pressed ahead with its plans to reinstate fully-physical proceedings. On 2 June 2020, MPs returned to the Commons to vote on the suspension of Hybrid Proceedings. Due to Public Health England's advice that the division lobbies normally used for voting were unsafe, MPs had to form a kilometre-long queue (dubbed the 'Mogg Conga' by Labour whip Nick Brown) around the Parliamentary Estate to maintain social distancing, before casting their vote in the Commons Chamber. The first vote, on an amendment tabled by Procedure Committee chair Karen Bradley took 44 minutes to complete (around three times longer than normal), and ended in victory for the government. Despite widespread opposition from MPs, the Government won the vote. Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended the strategy, stating that the public were doing the same when they went shopping. Critics of this plan, including the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said that it would risk disenfranchising MPs who were shielding from Coronavirus due to health or old age, as they could not travel to London to attend in person. The next day Johnson confirmed that MPs unable to attend for 'medical reasons' could elect a proxy to vote on their behalf, but would not be allowed to vote virtually. Concerns were also raised about the safety of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic MPs, who are twice as likely to die from Covid-19 than white people. MPs representating constituencies in the Scottish Highlands and Northern Ireland also complained of the travel times of up to 18 hours required to reach London due to flight restrictions. The Public and Commercial Services Union, who represent many parliamentary staff, later stated that they were considering balloting members for industrial action, due to numerous complaints about unsafe working conditions. Calls were renewed for the Virtual Proceedings to be re-instated when Business Secretary Alok Sharma fell ill with suspected Covid-19 after giving a statement to the Commons on 3 June 2020. Sharma had earlier that day been in close contact with Johnson, as well as Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Shadow Business Secretary Ed Miliband, the latter having passed a glass of water to Sharma during the statement. He later tested negative for the virus. ==Use in other legislatures== ===Within the United Kingdom=== The National Assembly for Wales was the first legislature to introduce virtual sessions, with the first meeting taking place on 1 April, including statements from ministers and questioning from senior opposition figures. The following week a representative sample of 28 AMs, around half of the total number of members, were able to take part and (for the first time) vote, thanks to the implementation of an electronic voting system. Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething faced criticism and calls to resign after he swore at colleague Jenny Rathbone while taking part in a virtual meeting. The Scottish Parliament conducted First Minister's Questions online, with questions being asked by the leaders of the four opposition parties. After this was deemed successful by Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh, the sessions were expanded to include the quizzing of other ministers, with questions being asked by a selection of 19 MSPs, to provide a party balance similar to the full parliament. The reforms have been popular with several rural representatives, with Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP Gail Ross saying that she might reconsider her decision to leave the house at the next election if the virtual proceedings were continued. The Lords Chamber with hybrid measures in place The House of Lords has also made a move to semi-virtual proceedings, starting with oral questions and statements. Peers are using Microsoft Teams to participate (as opposed to Zoom, which is used by the Commons), although the first two sessions were held in private. There was also discussion about whether peers would receive their normal expenses for working from home, one option being that they are paid half-rate, which is what they currently receive for work away from parliament. Parliamentary select committees are using video-conferencing as well, with most members phoning-in from home. ===In foreign legislatures=== Many parliaments across the world have closed to outsiders and asked non-essential staff to work from home where possible, including in France and the Netherlands, while others are using thermal imaging to detect the virus on entry to parliamentary buildings. Committees of members are being suspended or moved online, although some (such as the United States Congress) currently lack the technology for electronic voting. Some parliaments closed completely for a time, such as in Canada, while others have reduced the number of representatives present (examples include Ireland, Germany and New Zealand). Meanwhile, Hungary has been taking extreme measures, allowing Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n to rule the country without consulting MPs. ==See also== * COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom *2020 in United Kingdom politics and government * Coronavirus Act 2020 * House of Commons of the United Kingdom ==References== ==External links== * Coronavirus: Changes to practice and procedure in the UK and other parliaments, full report, at the House of Commons Library * Compilation of Parliamentary responses to Coronavirus at the Inter-Parliamentary Union Category:House of Commons of the United Kingdom Category:COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom Category:2020 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Virtual House of Commons"},{"id":"63786324","text":"The Shift6m is a modular smartphone produced by the Shift GmbH from Falkenberg, Hessen, Germany.

It was the home of the writer Roald Dahl and his family for several decades. The house is situated on Whitefield Lane, an old drovers' road on the outskirts of the village. It is currently privately owned but occasionally a tour is held in conjunction with the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre. ==The house== Dahl and his first wife, Patricia Neal, bought the house at auction for ¬£4,500 () in March 1954 after hearing of the house from Dahl's mother, Sofie Magdalene Dahl. Half of the purchase price came from Dahl's mother, the other half from Neal herself. The couple visited the house for the first time six weeks later. The property was owned by the Stewart-Liberty family and had previously been home to tenant farmers and a young solicitor and his family. The house was set in 6 acres of grounds with three bedrooms, with an apple and pear tree orchard with two water wells. The house is symmetrical, white and surrounded by gardens, with a brick wall along the perimeter of the property to the road. The design of the house has been likened to an \\"18th-century doll's house\\". The house required extensive renovations and remodelling, and the installation of electricity. The couple moved into the house in July 1954. Dahl renamed the house Little Whitefield to make it distinct from his sister's house, also named Whitefield. The house was finally renamed Gypsy House in 1960 after a family of gypsies who would camp in fields on top of the lane. An annex was built in May 1961 on the east side of the house, intended as a guest wing. Dahl would restore antiques in the new annex. The house was greatly extended over the decades as Dahl's family grew. A two-storey addition added to the house on the west side is the site of the present kitchen, dining room and spare room, but was originally built as a snooker room. The snooker room was resited in a new annex built in the garden with additional bedrooms. A local builder, Wally Saunders, helped Dahl with much of the work of remodelling the house. Saunders provided the inspiration for Dahl's BFG character. Elizabeth Day, writing in The Guardian, described the house as \\"an oversized cottage with low ceilings and yellow- and rose-painted rooms\\". Dahl's widow, Felicity Dahl, said in a 2008 interview with The Guardian that \\"people have strong reactions\\" to the house; the film director Tim Burton cried on the lawn of Gypsy House after coming there to research for his film adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. ==Garden== An acre of formal gardens separated by bordered rooms including a vegetable garden, a maze, and an orchard, surround the house. Dahl remodelled the garden in the early 1960s and planted 200 roses. Dahl also grew vegetables in the garden and laid a path to his writing hut. Dahl was passionate about growing onions and orchids, and a garden bench at the house has a carved back resembling a string of onions. Dahl would cheat at onion growing competitions with locals, ordering special seeds from growers. Dahl did not plant the garden himself due to his back pain that lingered from injuries sustained in the Second World War. The main horticultural development of the garden occurred after Dahl's marriage to Felicity Crosland in 1983. Several animals lived in the garden in the 1950s and 60s including a tortoise, hens, and a rabbit. A teahouse in the garden was converted into an aviary for parakeets and the hundreds of budgerigars who roamed the countryside during the day would roost there at night. It was inspired by one that Dahl had seen at Moyns Park, an Elizabethan country house in Essex, the home of his friend Ivar Bryce. The bird house was filled with large green bottles in 2008. The gardens feature several curiosities; stones at the entrance to the maze are inscribed with lines from Dahl's books, and a piece of jade sent to Dahl by an Australian child is set into the garden path along with old pennies. The front lawn of the house has two manhole covers, one decorated with the design of the Queen of Hearts and the other of Ace of Spades in reference to Dahl's love of the card game blackjack. In 1960 Dahl bought a gypsy caravan from his sister, Alfhild and her husband Leslie. It had been bought by Dahl's sister for Bert Edmonds, a gypsy neighbour. The caravan still sits in the garden. ===Writing hut=== Dahl wrote in a writing hut in the garden of Gipsy House. The creation of the hut was inspired by Dahl's visit to the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas's writing hut near his Boathouse in the Carmarthenshire town of Laugharne. Dahl visited Thomas's house in the 1950s. The hut was rebuilt by local builder Wally Saunders to the same proportions as Thomas's hut. Dahl told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs programme in 1979 that he wrote in \\"A little hut, curtains drawn so I don't see the squirrels up in the apple trees in the orchard. The light on, right away from the house, no vacuum cleaners, nothing...When I am in this place it is my little nest. My womb\\". In 2008 Elizabeth Day, visiting the house for The Guardian, described it as having been unchanged since Dahl's death in 1991, looking like a \\"dilapidated shed, its paint peeling and faded, its tiny windows dusty with disuse\\" and that \\"Everything is in place, exactly as it should be, except the person who made it so\\". Most of the space in the hut is taken up with Dahl's green \\"wing-back armchair\\" in which he sat when writing, he would also rest his legs on an old suitcase and cover them with a sleeping bag to keep warm. The chair had formerly belonged to Dahl's mother, and he had a hole cut in the chair to relieve the pain from an abscess on his back. A table in the shed held a variety of objects including a ball of crushed silver foil KitKat chocolate wrappers, a brass ornament of a Spitfire plane and his hip bone kept after his hip replacement. A mug was filled with pencils. Heat came from an electric heater \\"perilously rigged up to the ceiling with string\\". The curtains were almost always drawn in the hut and the only light came from an anglepoise lamp. Dahl would discard rejected pages into a rubbish bin by his side. Books and a filing cabinet were at his other side. Dahl wrote with Dixon Ticonderoga pencils on yellow A4 pads, resting on a piece of wood on a cardboard tube. A public appeal was made in 2011 to save the hut which was in \\"imminent danger of falling apart due to decay\\". The cost of moving the hut to the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre in Great Missenden High Street was estimated at ¬£500,000 by Dahl's granddaughter, Sophie Dahl who said that the hut was like an \\"ancient tomb\\" and that \\"there was something still quite sacred about it\\". The appeal was met with criticism due to the perceived wealth of the Dahl family. The mythology surrounding Dahl's hut and his authorial public status was critiqued by the academic Laura Vi√±as Valle in her 2016 book De- constructing Dahl. Valle compared the preserving of Dahl's hut to \\"what seemed to be a process of embalming, reminiscent of Ancient Egypt\\" and critiqued the legend of the lone genius and myth making perpetrated by the image of Dahl alone in his hut. Valle argued that such myth making negated the important role that his literary editors had in shaping his work for publication. The writing hut was reproduced in Wes Anderson's 2009 film adaptation of Dahl's 1970 novel Fantastic Mr Fox. ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:Great Missenden Category:Houses in Buckinghamshire Category:Roald Dahl ","title":"Gipsy House"},{"id":"63786354","text":"Fragment of an inscription detailing the cursus honorum of Marcus Iallius Bassus. The gens Iallia was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens are not mentioned in ancient writers, but they rose to prominence during the middle part of the second century, with two of them achieving the consulship under Antoninus Pius. ==Praenomina== All of the Iallii known from inscriptions lived in imperial times, and few are mentioned with praenomina. The main praenomen of this gens seems to have been Marcus, although there is also an instance of Quintus. Both of these were among the most common names throughout Roman history. ==Branches and cognomina== The only regular cognomen of the Iallia gens was Bassus, which belonged to the senatorial family. This was a common surname, originally referring to someone who might be described as \\"stout\\" or \\"sturdy\\", and was one of a large class of cognomina derived from a person's physical features.Chase, pp. 109, 110.

During his career he made expeditions across South America and collected nearly 20,000 specimens of birds and described several new species. He also wrote a major book on the birds of Mexico and began a five volume treatise on the Neotropical birds. Blake was born in Abbeville County, South Carolina and grew up near Greenwood, South Carolina where he roamed the forests and became interested in nature as a child. A relative taught him how to skin and prepare bird specimens. He joined Presbyterian College where his penchant for collecting animals, especially reptiles, gave him the nickname of \\"Snaky\\" Blake although in later life he was known to his friends as \\"Bob\\". After graduating in 1928 he roller-skated from Greenwood to the University of Pittsburgh where he worked at a petrol pump at night to support himself. He also proved himself a good boxer and nearly worked as a boxing trainer in the YMCA. Even as a student he joined a National Geographic Expedition under Ernest Holt along the Rio Negro on the border of Brazil and Venezuela. He was hired by Leon Mandel in 1931 to collect specimens for the Field Museum. After completing his MS in 1933 he was again invited to join an expedition to Guatemala, followed again by another in Belize. He joined the Field Museum staff in 1935 and continued to work almost until his death. He joined the US Army Counter Intelligence Corps towards the end of World War II and was posted in northern Africa. He received a Purple Heart for his service. In 1953 he published the Birds of Mexico. He also helped in revising Peters' Checklist of the Birds of the World. In 1977 he published the first volume of the Manual of Neotropical Birds but the remaining four volumes were completed by others after his death. Blake was an old-school faunistics-oriented ornithologist and he was one of the authors of a note in the Auk that berated new ecological approaches. He married Margaret Bird and they had two daughters. He died at Evanston, Illinois.Chicago Tribune. Obituary: Emmet R. Blake, Museum Bird Curator.

May wrote the novel in 2005, but it was rejected by publishershttps://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/04/us/peter-may-lockdown- coronavirus-book-trnd/index.html as being unrealistic. During the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdowns in 2020, the book was finally published. == Plot summary == Five months into an influenza pandemic that kills eighty per cent of those affected, London is in lockdown. The city is under military control, a strict curfew is in force and there is extensive public surveillance. Among those who have died from the virus are the prime minister and members of his family. Detective Inspector Jack MacNeil is ordered to investigate the discovery of fresh human bones found at a building site in Lambeth. A thumbprint on a London Underground ticket found at the scene takes him along a chain of clues, eventually leading to an empty house in Wandsworth. At every step of the way, he is surreptitiously followed by a sociopathic killer who calls himself Pinkie (after the antihero of Graham Greene's novel, Brighton Rock). Pinkie has been hired by a shadowy \\"Mr Smith\\" to keep watch on the police investigation and to ensure the bones don't lead them anywhere. Pinkie kills two witnesses to prevent them giving information to MacNeil. Meanwhile, Dr. Amy Wu, a forensic scientist who is in a relationship with MacNeil, determines that the remains are probably those of a girl of about ten years of age, of East Asian origin and with a harelip. She takes the bones back to her flat in order to do a facial reconstruction from the skull. At the house in Wandsworth, a neighbour tells MacNeil that the house was recently occupied by a couple named Smith who had a ten-year old adopted daughter, a Chinese girl with a harelip. Pinkie surreptitiously enters Amy's flat while she is taking a shower. Sensing the presence of the intruder, she phones MacNeil and leaves a panic-stricken voicemail message. While preparing to break into the house in Wandsworth, MacNeil encounters Dr. Sara Castelli, an investigator with the Health Protection Agency who believes that the Chinese girl was the source of the pandemic. After MacNeil retrieves Amy's voicemail message, he and Castelli hurry to her flat, but they find it empty. An instant messaging chat window that is open on Amy's computer indicates that she has been discussing the case with her mentor, Dr Samantha Looker. At Looker's flat, they discover that the mentor has been murdered (by Pinkie) and her chats with Amy have been hijacked by a third party, who turns out to be Mr Smith. Using the chat window to communicate, Smith threatens to kill Amy unless MacNeil hands over whatever evidence the police have against him. They meet at the London Eye, where Pinkie is holding Amy at gun-point in a pod at the top of the wheel. Smith is revealed to be Dr Roger Blume, an executive of an international pharmaceutical company. Blume tells MacNeil that his company had created the virus artificially in order to make money from selling a vaccine. The Chinese girl had been intentionally infected and the virus allowed to spread. She had been killed to suppress the evidence. In a fit of anger, Castelli tries to shoot Blume, but he escapes by climbing up the outside of the wheel towards the pod where Pinkie is holding Amy. MacNeil follows. In a final struggle, Blume gets the better of MacNeil and is about to hurl him to his death when, in a moment of remorse, Pinkie shoots Blume and helps MacNeil to safety, falling to his own death as he does so. == Background == May wrote Lockdown over six weeks in 2005, but it was rejected by publishers in the UK who thought that the portrayal of London under siege by a 'flu epidemic was unrealistichttps://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/04/us/peter-may- lockdown-coronavirus-book-trnd/index.html.

Perennially overcrowded, it has been accused of widespread human rights abusesSummary of stakeholders' submissions-the Philippines, Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, p. 12, 27 February 2017 and has been compared to a gulag by The Manila Times. As an administrative detention center, there is no constitutional right to bail from BI‚ÄìBicutan, and some detainees have spent upwards of ten years there, neither convicted of a crime nor deported from the country. == Foundation == The Philippine government only became interested in regulating the length of stay of all aliens during the American colonial period. In 1932, an immigration detention center was built on Engineer Island, now known as Baseco. In March 1955, more than 100 Chinese detainees staged a hunger strike there. The Engineer Island Detention Center closed on 14 June 1975, and the 22 detainees were detained instead at Fort Bonifacio. The site of the current BI‚ÄìBicutan was built during the regime of Ferdinand Marcos as a political prison; Camp Bagong Diwa housed many units of political prisoners under Marcos. After the collapse of the Marcos regime, incoming President Corazon Aquino began to free the political prisoners held at the camp. BI‚ÄìBicutan has fulfilled its current role since at least May 1999, when the Bureau of Immigration detained Ma Jing, a Chinese national, there, and the Supreme Court of the Philippines upheld the detention center's role as legal.Commissioner Rodriguez v. Judge Bonifacio, A.M. No. RTJ-99-1510, 2000-11-06, Supreme Court of the Philippines, First Division By 2002, it already had a population of 140 detainees. Located inside Camp Bagong Diwa, in Lower Bicutan, Taguig, the facility has since its founding been known internally variously as the Warden Facility and Protection Unit (WFPU) and the BI Warden Facility (BIWF). In its press releases and public statements, the Bureau variously refers to the facility as being a \\"jail\\", \\"warden facility\\" or \\"detention center\\", sometimes using multiple descriptions in the same statement. == Functions == The function of BI‚ÄìBicutan within the Philippine immigration system is to detain foreign aliens, who are awaiting deportation for one of four main reasons: * A country with which the Philippines has an extradition treaty requests extradition of an alien to face criminal charges in that country. (In April 2020, this represented only 10% of all foreign detainees.) * The Bureau of Immigration itself declares an alien \\"undesirable\\", and moves to arrest and deport the alien. The alien need not have broken any law; the executive branch, via the Bureau, has full power to determine undesirability via a quasi-judicial proceeding; this power is vested in both the President of the Philippines and the Commissioner of the Bureau of Immigration.Go Tek v. Deportation Board, G.R. No. L-23846, 1977-09-090, Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division * The Bureau of Immigration accuses an alien of breaking immigration law, for example by overstaying their visa or working without a permit, before its own Board of Commissioners, and moves to deport the alien on that basis. *The alien has a pending criminal case, or \\"derogatory record\\". The Bureau of Immigration is copied on arrest warrants of foreigners, and may detain an alien as undesirable pending the outcome of their criminal case, even if the alien manages to bail themselves out of a Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP)-managed jail. The Bureau does neither renew nor implement visas of aliens with \\"derogatory records\\",Need for derogatory record check immediately prior to visa implementation, release of passport with implemented visa and release of ACR I-Card, Republic of the Philippines‚ÄîBureau of Immigration, 2014-01-13, via Facebook so if their visa expires while they wait on a verdict, they can be detained for overstaying their visa, despite being ordered to do so as part of their conditions of bail by a Regional Trial Court (RTC). Even if found innocent at RTC, the Bureau may, legally, and at its discretion, deport the alien for the overstay; however, as of 2016 it, in at least one case, instead charges a fine if innocence is determined at RTC. == Conditions == BI‚ÄìBicutan is notorious for its squalid conditions. Designed only to hold a maximum of 140 detainees, the facility in May 2020 held over 400 detainees, an overcrowding rate of ‚â•285%. On a fact-finding mission conducted by Human Rights Without Frontiers (HRWF) in September 2016 and accepted as a submission by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights at a time when BI‚ÄìBicutan held 147 detainees, the conditions were described as \\"appalling\\", the provided food as \\"meager rations\\" which detainees supplement with their own money; a complete lack of medical care was also noted. A report by Howard Johnson, a BBC correspondent, on Victoria Derbyshire, noted the center's overcrowding, rat infestation, and \\"lack of basic facilities\\". In interviews conducted by Johnson, former and current detainees alleged being denied food, being locked in small cages, and suffering illness due to pests, and showed evidence of such allegations that they captured with smuggled cell phones. In May 2019, British ambassador to the Philippines Daniel Pruce personally visited BI‚ÄìBicutan. He, and the European Union ambassador to the Philippines, at that time raised the issue with Filipino authorities of the \\"overcrowded\\", deprived conditions Britons and other foreign detainees were being held in. Male and female detainees are segregated by sex, but at least as of 2007, male guards oversee both. == Bail == Immigration bail may only be granted by the Commissioner of the Bureau of Immigration, as of 2020, Jaime Morente; RTC judges may not grant immigration bail, and while aliens have similar rights to Filipino citizens in acquiring bail from police custody and BJMP-managed jails, the Constitution of the Philippines does not guarantee a right to immigration bail. Such bail, if ever granted, is usually granted on the advice of the Bureau's legal department, but this is not required, and the Commissioner frequently rejects bail applications even with the backing of the Bureau's lower offices. , immigration bail was extremely difficult to acquire, even in minor cases such as visa overstays where the aliens in question were appealing the visa overstay allegations. During the 2020 Luzon enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, such bail became only marginally easier to acquire, as the overcrowded conditions provide a ready host for the virus. By 14 May, months into the ECQ, only two pregnant women had been granted immigration bail. == Corruption allegations == In an analogous situation to the New Bilibid Prison, numerous high-profile allegations of corruption have been made, and wardens relieved of their duty for corruption. Ramon Tulfo, a journalist at The Manila Times, in April 2019 used his column to allow a former detainee to write a piece; in it he alleged that BI‚ÄìBicutan officials frequently demand bribes from detainees to affect their release. Similar accusations were made by foreign detainees to the South China Morning Post, including by one Greek man who alleged that bribes of US$100,000 were demanded from him. After a raid in April 2019, BI‚ÄìBicutan's then-warden Ni√±o Oliver Dato was relieved of his duty for allowing some detainees to operate illegal online gambling websites from inside the facility; the Bureau of Immigration's Commissioner noted in a press release that he was relieved as \\"things had gotten worse\\" after a 22 January raid.BI To Overhaul Detention Center (2019-04-01), Press Release, Bureau of Immigration Some foreign detainees who are being detained pending extradition are alleged to engage in \\"pay-to-stay\\" schemes wherein they attempt to pay off Bureau of Immigration officials to slow down their deportation; notable is the case of Wang Bo, who was alleged to have paid bribes of to avoid being deported and had to answer for such in a hearing before the House of Representatives of the Philippines. Korean detainees who allegedly operate criminal internet businesses inside BI‚ÄìBicutan have been alleged to do so as well. === Escapes === In 2005, three foreign detainees accused of drug trafficking escaped BI‚ÄìBicutan, which led to an investigation of guards and immigration officials. In 2007, the United States Department of State reported that multiple detainees had gained release by paying cash bribes to guards. In January 2009, BI‚ÄìBicutan's then-warden Arsenio Samson and nine others were terminated for aiding in the escape of Korean fugitive Byung Kyu Choi, wanted in Seoul for allegedly embezzling . On 9 December 2014, American detainee Douglas Brent Jackson, awaiting deportation to the United States, sawed off the grill of a window and escaped BI‚ÄìDavao, where he was temporarily being held instead of at BI‚ÄìBicutan as he had a pending estafa case. He was recaptured on 18 December and held in BI‚ÄìBicutan.BI Recaptures Escaped Ward (2014-12-18), Press Release, Bureau of Immigration‚ÄîRepublic of the Philippines. In October 2015, then-Commissioner Siegfried Mison said that some ten Bureau employees had accepted bribes of from Korean fugitive Seongdae Cho, wanted for extortion in Korea, to help him escape BI‚ÄìBicutan. In the case of the escape of Cho, the National Bureau of Investigation in January 2016 recommended the filing of charges against seventeen Bureau employees after Cho escaped Bureau custody again. In March 2017, nine guards were relieved of duty for failing to prevent the escapes of fugitives Jung Jaeyul and Park Wang Yeol, wanted for murder in Korea. On 31 January 2020, Song Yangrae was granted temporary leave from BI‚ÄìBicutan to be escorted by four guards to Taguig Pateros District Hospital for a medical evaluation; he escaped custody and fled to Floridablanca, and his escorts were accused of \\"obvious connivance\\" by Commissioner Morente. == Satellite facilities == Due to the extreme overcrowding at BI‚ÄìBicutan, the Bureau of Immigration occasionally requests that other agencies of the Philippine government hold any overflow of aliens that would normally be detained at BI‚ÄìBicutan. There is also a satellite facility, the Bureau of Immigration Davao Detention Center (BI‚ÄìDavao). == See also == * Philippine Refugee Processing Center == References == Category:Immigration detention centers and prisons Category:Prisons in the Philippines Category:Immigration to the Philippines ","title":"Bureau of Immigration Bicutan Detention Center"},{"id":"63786687","text":"The Seychelles mabuya (Trachylepis sechellensis) is a species of skink found in the Seychelles. ==References== Category:Trachylepis Category:Reptiles described in 1839 Category:Taxa named by Andr√© Marie Constant Dum√©ril Category:Taxa named by Gabriel Bibron ","title":"Trachylepis sechellensis"},{"id":"63786719","text":"Maria Sakhinova (; born 3 February 2000) is an Armenian footballer who plays as a defender for FC Alashkert and the Armenia women's national team. ==International career== Sakhinova capped for Armenia at senior level in a 0‚Äì1 friendly loss to Lithuania on 4 March 2020. ==References== Category:2000 births Category:Living people Category:Women's association football defenders Category:Armenian women's footballers Category:Armenia women's international footballers Category:FC Alashkert players ","title":"Maria Sakhinova"},{"id":"63786748","text":"The Federal Union of State Trade Unions (, UFSE) is a trade union federation bringing together unions representing workers in the French Civil Service. ==History== The federation was founded in 1909 as the National Federation of Professional Associations of the State, the Departments and the Communes, then in 1919 it became the General Federation of Civil Servants' Federations.

The siege was conducted by the Roman proconsul Marcus Aurelius Cotta (by land) and the legate Gaius Valerius Triarius (by sea). They were besieging the adherents of Mithridates of Pontus who held the city for the Pontic king. Heraclea was located on the strategically important northern land route into the kingdom of Pontus and had been taken and garrisoned by Mithridates on his retreat from the Siege of Cyzicus. The 4,000 men strong Mithridatic garrisoned was commanded by Connacorex, one of the kings generals, and they held out for almost two years. After taking Heraclea the Romans extensively plundered the city.Fratatuono, Lucullus, p. 159; Matyszak, Mithridates, pp. 117‚Äì118; Broughton, Magistrates, p. 110, 116 & 122; Memnon, Heraclea, 32. ==Background== After his defeat at the hands of Lucius Cornelius Sulla during the First Mithridatic War (89-85 BC) Mithridates had rebuilt his power and armies.Matyszak, Mithridates, p. 99. In 74 BC, Nicomedes IV the king of Bithynia died, the Romans claimed he had left them his kingdom in his will and took control of Bithynia.Matyszak, Mithridates, p. 100. Bithynia served as a buffer state between Rome and Pontus; feeling threatened Mithridates marched his armies westwards and invade Roman territory.Matyszak, Mithridates, p. 101. The Senate responded by sending the consuls Lucius Licinius Lucullus and Marcus Aurelius Cotta to deal with the Pontic threat.Anthon, Charles & Smith, William, A New Classical Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology and Geography, 1860, p. 226. The plan was for Cotta to tie down Mithridates's fleet, while Lucullus attacked by land. Cotta stationed his fleet at Chalcedon, while Lucullus planned to march through Phrygia with the intention of invading Pontus. Lucullus had not advanced far when news came through that Mithridates had made a rapid march westward, attacked and defeated Cotta at the Battle of Chalcedon, and was now besieging him.Holmes, T. Rice, The Roman Republic and the Founder of the Empire, Vol. I, 1923, p. 180; Appian Mithridatica, 71; Plutarch. Lucullus, 8. Leaving Cotta under siege in Chalcedon, Mithidates moved on and started taking cities in Bithynia. Lucullus marched north and caught the Mithridatic army off guard besieging Cyzicus, he conducted a very effective counter-siege, blockading the Mithridatic army on the Cyzicus peninsula and let famine and disease do his work for him.Matyszak, Mithridates, pp. 111‚Äì112; Fratantuono, Lucullus, pp. 57‚Äì61; Appian, Mithridatica, 74; Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, 9‚Äì12. ==Prelude== Mithridates escaped the counter-siege by sea during a storm filled night. On his way back to Pontus he took the city of Heraclea Pontica by subterfuge. He garrisoned 4,000 of his men under general Connacorex in the city to ensure its loyalty.Fratatuono, Lucullus, p. 159; Memnon, Heraclea, 32. ==Siege== After hearing about the situation at Heraclea, Lucullus changed his plans and decided to march into Pontus via the southern routeMatyszak, Mithridates, p. 117. through Galatia and leave Heraclea to Cotta while Lucullus's legate Triarius would confront Mithridates's naval forces. Cotta marched on Heraclea and began to lay siege to the city, despite his efforts he met with limited success. Eventually, Triarius arrived with naval support to aid Cotta in his operations. Menchares, one of the sons of Mithridates and his governor of the Bosporian Kingdom, supplied Heraclea and its defenders from his dominions north of the Black Sea. Unfortunately for Mithridates, Menchares decided to abandon his father's cause and started negotiations with Lucullus. In exchange for the status of 'Friend and Ally' he halted his supply shipments.Matyszak, Mithridates, p. 116 and p. 118; Fratantuono, Lucullus, pp. 75‚Äì76. Connacorex, Mithridates's commander, eventually decided to betray his king and hand the city over to the Romans. Connacorex did not trust Cotta so he started negotiations with Triarius whom he considered more trustworthy. The plan was apparently common knowledge in Heraclea ‚ÄìConnacorex had deceived the Heracleans by telling them he had received word that Mithridates and Tigranes (his ally) were on their way and would soon drive the Romans out. Connacorex then escaped escaped by sea, Triarius letting him through his naval blockade, and the Romans sailed into the harbour. Triarius's troops started to loot the city, those Heracleans who escaped the atrocities made their way to Cotta's camp and apprised him of the situation. There was nearly a civil war as Cotta's men felt cheated out of their glory and plunder. The Roman land army entered the city as well and joined in on the plundering. Cotta even ransacked the content of sacred precincts and temples, including a statue of Heracles. ==Aftermath== After the sack of Heraclea, Cotta dismissed his allies, sent his own troops to reinforce Lucullus in Pontus, and returned to Rome. Some of his ships sunk under the weight of the stolen treasures. Triarius went in pursuit of Connacorex, who had captured Tius and Amastris; he was eventually allowed to flee, with the Romans taking the cities without a fight.Fratatuono, Lucullus, pp. 159‚Äì160. ==Sources== The following titles were used in the composition of this article. ===Bibliography=== * Anthon, Charles & Smith, William, A New Classical Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology and Geography, 1860. * Thomas Rice Holmes, The Roman Republic and the Founder of the Empire, Vol. I, 1923 * Thomas Robert Shannon Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, II, 1952. * Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great: Rome's Indomitable Enemy, 2008. * Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus: The Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror, 2017. ===Ancient Sources=== * Appian, Mithridatic Wars. * Memnon of Heraclea, History of Heraclea. * Plutarch, Parallel Lives: Life of Lucullus. ==Notes and References== Category:Sieges involving the Roman Republic Category:Battles involving Pontus Category:Mithridatic Wars Category:70s BC conflicts ","title":"Siege of Heraclea"},{"id":"63786839","text":"Ani Karapetyan (; born 30 May 2001) is an Armenian footballer who plays as a defender for FC Alashkert and the Armenia women's national team. ==International career== Karapetyan capped for Armenia at senior level in a 0‚Äì1 friendly loss to Lithuania on 4 March 2020. ==References== Category:2001 births Category:Living people Category:Women's association football defenders Category:Armenian women's footballers Category:Armenia women's international footballers Category:FC Alashkert players ","title":"Ani Karapetyan"},{"id":"63786844","text":"The Bexley Civic Offices is a municipal facility in Watling Street, Bexleyheath, London. It is the headquarters of the Bexley London Borough Council. ==History== The new Bexley Urban District Council established offices in an early 19th century building on the south side of the Broadway in Bexleyheath known as Oak House in 1903. After Bexley secured municipal borough status in 1932, Oak House remained the headquarters of the new Municipal Borough of Bexley until it was merged with the Municipal Borough of Erith to form the London Borough of Bexley with its new headquarters at Erith Town Hall in 1965. The new council only used Erith Town Hall briefly as it chose to demolish Oak House in 1979 to make way for purpose-built Civic Offices which opened on the same site on the south side of the Broadway in 1980. The facility at Watling Street, which was designed in the style of a pagoda and built as the head office of the Woolwich Building Society at a cost of ¬£10.5 million, was officially opened by Princess Anne in 1989. Following Barclays' acquisition of the building society in 2000 and a subsequent period of integration, the Watling Street building became vacant in 2005. Meanwhile, Bexley London Borough Council was seeking new facilities to replace its aging Civic Offices on the south side of the Broadway. The Watling Street building was refurbished by Mace at a cost of ¬£21.4 million to a design by Bennetts Associates.

Most road tennis courts are located on the roads, where locals play the game. ==Equipment== The game is played using two wooden rackets and one tennis ball with the fur removed. An eight-inch-high plank wood net is used on the court or road, which requires 21x10 feet of space to play. == Rules == The first player to 21 points is declared the winner. There are no volleys in the game and the server alternates after five points have been scored. Similar to table tennis, each serve must bounce once in the server's court.

He was listed by the society as Surgeon to the Royal Military Asylum at Chelsea, Serjeant Surgeon to the King, Surgeon to His Royal Highness the Duke of York; and Assistant Surgeon to the Lock Hospital at Golden Square, Soho. It was as the Surgeon at the Royal Military Asylum (first appointed in 1804) that Macgregor achieved some of his most effective contributions to medical science. The institution was home to up to a thousand children and communicable disease was commonplace and caused death and disability. Macgregor was able through the study of diseases occurring amongst the children at the asylum to take action that effectively prevented transmission in some of the diseases, he was a great proponent of hygienic countermeasures. Macgregor wrote in 1811 that 'Egyptian Ophthalmia' (Trachoma) in the army had: ‚Äòat diÔ¨Äerent periods materially interfered with its discipline and eÔ¨Éciency. It has crippled many of our best regiments to such a degree as for a time to render them unÔ¨Åt for service‚Äô. The problem was exacerbated by lack of understanding of the nature of Trachoma, its causes and what could be done to combat the ailment.

It is a Sonoma County historic landmark and a member of Historic Hotels of America. ==Prior use== The hotel is located in Boyes Springs, an area of naturally occurring underground hot mineral waters that was considered sacred by Native Americans. The area was first developed commercially by Dr. T.M. Leavenworth in 1840. It was later acquired by Captain H. E. Boyes, whose drilling in 1895 found 112-degree water at a depth of 70 feet, and who developed the Boyes Hot Springs Hotel within a few years. That hotel was destroyed with much of Boyes Springs in a September 1923 wildfire. ==Development== The Sonoma Mission Inn was built on the 360-acre Bigelow Ranch. The initial contract for construction of a Spanish Mission-style hotel was signed in November 1926. On opening in August 1927, the property was known as the Boyes Hot Springs Hotel. The hotel was developed by Fred Partridge and Rudolph Lichtenberg at a reported cost of approximately $600,000. Joseph L. Stewart was the architect, and R. W. Littlefield was the contractor. The hotel's name was changed in February 1928 to the Sonoma Mission Inn. The 238-acre Sonoma Mission Inn Golf Course and Country Club was added in July 1928, built at a cost of more than $250,000. A large bathing pavilion with two auxiliary tanks, each holding 150,000 gallons of water, opened in April 1930. ==Subsequent history== In 1930, Sonoma Properties Company, owner of the hotel, filed for bankruptcy, reporting liabilities of $710,500 and assets of $656,982. During World War II, the hotel was leased by the Navy to serve as a \\"rest center\\" for sailors and marines returning from combat duty in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater. In March 1943, 90 veterans of the Guadalcanal campaign were stationed at the hotel, transitioning from one of the most brutal battles in American history to \\"a make-believe world of downy beds, luxurious bath tubs, a private golf course, cherry pies, free movies, soda pop, swimming pool and dances with girls in fluffy organdy.\\" The hotel returned to civilian use in October 1945 was purchased that same year by San Francisco hoteliers, E. B. Degolia and George T. Thompson. After a temporary closure for extensive renovation and remodeling, the inn reopened in February 1948. George Thompson became the sole owner at that time. In 1980, the hotel underwent a $4-million renovation after being purchased for $2.5 million by Ed Safdie. The improvements continued in October 1981 with the opening of The Spa at the Sonoma Mission Inn. By 1984, Safdie's total investment in the property reportedly totaled $10 million. Safdie sold the inn to Rahn Properties in 1985 for a reported $16.5 million. Rahn closed the inn for remodeling. It was reopened in 1986 with Rahn reporting that it had spent $35 million purchasing, expanding, and remodeling the property. The property was subsequently acquired by Crescent Real Estate Equities, a Dallas-based REIT. In 2002, Crescent sold a 20% interest in the inn to Fairmont Hotels & Resorts. Fairmont took over management of the property and rebranded it as The Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn & Spa. ==References== ==External links== * *Official website Category:Hotels in California Category:Sonoma, California Category:1927 establishments in California Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1927 ","title":"Sonoma Mission Inn"},{"id":"63787413","text":"William McLernon (born 1 August 1934) is an Irish equestrian.

The website Adventure Games praised the hand-drawn visuals, story, and soundtrack, but criticised the puzzles.

It was released on September 18, 2020 in lieu of 2K's normal yearly WWE game, which was cancelled due to both the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the negative reception surrounding 2K's previous WWE title, WWE 2K20 (2019). Much like Saber's NBA Playgrounds, Battlegrounds is more of a fast-paced, arcade-style fighting game than the more realistic main entries to the WWE 2K series. Its fighting style has been compared to WWE All Stars (2011). The game released to mixed reviews, with critics praising the art style and co-operative gameplay modes, but criticizing the use of microtransactions and lack of gameplay features. ==Development== WWE 2K Battlegrounds was developed in the aftermath of the poor reception of 2019's WWE 2K20, which was criticized for its graphics, gameplay and various glitches. Months after the maligned release of WWE 2K20, rumors emerged that 2K's next WWE title would be entirely different from the rest of the yearly WWE 2K series. On April 27, 2020, 2K officially announced WWE 2K Battlegrounds as a spin-off to the series, while also announcing that video game industry veteran Patrick Gilmore would be the new game's executive producer. The trailer featured John Cena, The Rock, Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair and Stone Cold Steve Austin. On May 4, 2020, an ESRB Rating confirmed that 2K Battlegrounds would be released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch (the first WWE game to be released on Switch since 2K18) and would be the first WWE game to release on Stadia, but 2K have yet to confirm this. On August 16, IGN revealed the game's entire roster, with superstars like Hulk Hogan, Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts, and \\"The Fiend\\" Bray Wyatt appearing in the base game, and additional superstars including Doink the Clown, The Boogeyman, Earthquake, and Typhoon announced to arrive as free, unlockable content in the months following the game's release. Later, it was announced that the characters could also be unlocked via microtransactions, like many other unlockables in the game. ==Reception== The Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of WWE 2K Battlegrounds received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" according to review aggregator website Metacritic. Mark Delaney of GamesRadar+ criticized the game's reliance on microtransactions, and stated that WWE video games had reached \\"its rock bottom\\". Destructoid opined that it was \\"a game nobody will remember a year from now.\\" Writing for Nintendo Life, Chris Scullion denounced the game for being a grind and having limited replayability outside of the campaign mode, but did offer some praise to the co-op mode. In a slightly more positive review for Hardcore Gamer, Cory Wells appreciated the game's lower retail price point and ability to played as a party game, but agreed that micro-transactions and the lack of playable characters on offer tainted the experience. For IGN, Mitchell Saltzman commented that although the game was better than its predecessor, it was \\"nonetheless another in a growing series of misses for WWE video games.\\" == References == == External links == * Official website Category:2020 video games Category:2K Sports games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:WWE video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Stadia games Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Video game spin-offs Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Take-Two Interactive games Category:Professional wrestling games ","title":"WWE 2K Battlegrounds"},{"id":"63787572","text":"Marc Sebastian Faiella (born November 1, 1990) is an American model and stylist.

The identity has been researched academically, particularly within the arts, as well as social sciences, and has been reported on and discussed in the media of Scotland. ==Background== Black Scottish identity has been researched and reported on within a range of contexts and intersecting dimensions. The identity is usually connected with black African and African Caribbean heritage or cultural association in Scotland, and academic research in social sciences has focused on perceptions of competing identities: > To some, it‚Äôs obvious that the two are not mutually exclusive. To others, > Black Scottish identity is a contradiction in terms: either you‚Äôre of this > place, Scottish and therefore white, or Other, Black. In scholarly publications with a focus on literary works, the writings of Maud Sulter, and Jackie Kay in particular, have produced study into the subject in Scotland. Kay's work and commentary is preeminent in the portrayal of black Scottishness and identity. Academics, such as professor Alan Rice, have analyzed how the writer's 1998 novel Trumpet harnessed African-American music and traditions in order to explore black Scottish identity. ==History== In 2013, Scottish playwright David Greig, who was brought up Nigeria, wrote that increased awareness of black Scottish identity was a positive result of the policy and cultural debates ahead of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. A 2017 study into Scottish Somalis living in Glasgow detailed how monolithic black identity in Scotland had created cultural identification issues. University of Edinburgh research-fellow Emma Hill's analysis detailed the potential conflicts created by the identity and its tendency to exclude the group's religious faith as Muslims. Queen Margaret University's Dr Rebecca Finkel, Dr Briony Sharp and Dr Majella Sweeney explored the identity and its ethnocultural expression in Scottish society in their 2018 Routledge research- series. ==Academic research== The works of Jackie Kay have been widely examined in the emergence of a black Scottish identity in the nation. Carole Seymour-Jones's 2009 Disappearing Men, which analyzes Kay's black character (Joss Moody) in Trumpet, argues that black Scottish identity is a form of inclusive declaration which defies oversimplified categorisation. University of Zadar assistant professor, Vesna Ukiƒá Ko≈°ta, has written of black Scottish identity, examining another Kay work (The Adoption Papers) and its intersection with parent-child relations. Dr Minna Liinp√§√§'s 2018 Nationalism from Above and Below, published by the University of Glasgow, examined nationalism and racialised society in Scotland. The thesis, which studied the experiences of black Scots, analyzed perceptions of contradiction between blackness and Scottishness. In Gerry Hassan's 2019 Scotland the Brave? Twenty Years of Change and Devolution, University of Edinburgh professor Dr Nasar Meer explores the political challenges for ethnic minorities, and specifically black Scottish people, in expressing their Scottish national identity. ==References== Category:African diaspora in Scotland Category:Black British history Category:Black British culture ","title":"Black Scottish identity"},{"id":"63787581","text":"Major-General Ashley Ernest George Truluck CB CBE (born 7 December 1947) is a British soldier and administrator, currently High Sheriff of Wiltshire. ==Career== Truluck was born in Pembrokeshire in 1947,‚ÄúTruluck Ashley E / Kitchen Pembroke 8c 563a‚Äù in General Index to Births in England and Wales, 1947 the son of Major George William Truluck, Royal Artillery, and his wife Elizabeth Kitchener.‚ÄùTruluck, Maj.

All remodelers fall under the umbrella of RNA/DNA helicase superfamily 2. In yeast, CHD complexes are primarily responsible for nucleosome assembly and organization. These complexes play an additional role in multicellular eukaryotes, assisting in chromatin access and nucleosome editing. == Functions of CHD subfamily proteins == Similar to the imitation switch (ISWI) subfamily of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, CHD complexes regulate the assembly and organization of mature nucleosomes along the DNA. Histones are removed during DNA replication; following behind the replisome, histones start to assemble as immature pre- nucleosomes on nascent DNA. With the help of CHD complexes, histone octamers can mature into native nucleosomes. Following nucleosome formation, CHD complexes organize nucleosomes by regularly spacing them apart along the DNA. Additionally, CHDs in higher-order organisms can slide/eject nucleosomes or histone dimers to allosterically regulate DNA accessibility. Specific CHD complexes, such as the nucleosome remodeling deacetylase (NuRD) complex in C. elegans, can expose binding sites for transcriptional repressors along the chromatin by interacting with highly-modular histone tails; deacetylation of the histone residue H3K9ac is an example of how the NuRD complex can downregulate gene expression and affect DNA topology. The final mechanism of this subfamily of ATP-dependent remodelers is nucleosome editing. Drosophila dCHD1 can edit nucleosomes by swapping out histone H3 for the variant H3.3. Binding of dCHD1 near the nucleosome causes tension in the DNA. To relieve this tension, an upstream H3 dimer is displaced from the nucleosome, allowing for its replacement by histone variant H3.3. The addition of H3.3 into the nucleosomes is an epigenetic way to keep the chromatin in an accessible, transcription-ready, state. Incorporation of alternative histones and post- translational modifications (PTMs) play an integral role in regulating the cell's histone code. == Structure of CHD subfamily proteins == Figure 01: Functional domains of the CHD subfamily of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers The unique N-terminal domain of the CDH subfamily contains two chromodomains. The two lobe domains act in tandem as the translocase domain (Tr) and are connected by a peptide linker (Fig. 01). NegC* (similar to NegC in ISWI) acts as an inhibitor to lobe movement and translocation until proper binding of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) occurs. NegC* acts by blocking ATP hydrolysis at the lobes. The DBD also acts as a nucleotide ruler, evenly spacing nucleosomes from one another. Post-DNA binding, the DBD causes tension on the DNA strand resulting in a conformational change that blocks regular NegC* inhibition. This allows for the activation of the TR domain, resulting in DNA translocation. == Shared mechanism of DNA-translocation between ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes == The Tr mechanism of DNA translocation is conserved by all ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers; two RecA-like lobes are mechanistically responsible for translocating the DNA. After binding two helical turns away from a nucleosome, the complex causes the shifting of the aforementioned nucleosome upstream one-two base pairs. In this ATP-driven mechanism, energy from hydrolysis causes the lobes to 'crawl' along the DNA towards the nucleosome dyad until the nucleosomes are correctly assembled, accessed or edited. ==See also== Proteins in the family: *CHD1 *CHD2 *CHD3 *CHD5 *CHD7 ==References== Category:DNA-binding proteins Category:Epigenetics Category:RNA ","title":"Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) subfamily"},{"id":"63787603","text":"Neil Frederick Clay Martin (born 19 October 1969) is an English former first- class cricketer.

He was the second son of John Wilkinson, factor at Blackwell Hall in London for Potterton, West Riding of Yorkshire, and his wife Anne Denison. His mother's brother, Robert Denison (died 1782) of Ossington, Nottinghamshire, a woollen merchant in Leeds, bequeathed to him his business interests and his estates in County Durham, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire on condition that he adopted the surname Denison; which he did on 16 April 1785. Robert's fortune was said to have amounted to ¬£700,000; Accessed from British History Online of the order of ¬£84 million in 2020 money. This new wealth made John a figure of considerable influence in Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. In 1788, he was reported as having little interest in politics. In 1791, he got round a clause in his uncle's will, gave up business, and settled at Ossington as a country gentleman. In 1796, he entered Parliament as MP for Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire under the patronage of Viscount Bolingbroke. He almost always voted with the government. In 1802, he was elected MP for Colchester, Essex; a seat where \\"a long purse\\" was needed to win the support of the voters. He stood down at the 1806 election, because he had opposed the government on one issue and had lost its support. He asserted that he could have retained his seat, but that \\"it is rather too much to expect one to sacrifice thousands for the honour of a seat on the green benches [in the House of Commons]\\". In the 1807 election, he was elected MP for Minehead, Somerset, under the patronage of the Luttrell family. He was inconspicuous in that Parliament. He retired from politics in 1812, and died in 1820. He married twice. (1) 5 March 1787, to Maria Charlotte (died 1794), daughter of Isaac Webb Horlock of Ashwick, Somerset; with whom he had two sons and one daughter. (2) December 1796, to Charlotte, daughter of Samuel Estwick the elder; with whom he had nine sons and three daughters. His third son with Charlotte was William Denison (1804-1871), colonial administrator. He was the father-in-law of Charles Manners-Sutton and the father of Viscount Ossington, who both became Speaker of the House of Commons. ==References== Category:1750s births Category:Year of birth missing Category:Place of birth missing Category:1820 deaths Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1796‚Äì1800 Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1801‚Äì1802 Category:UK MPs 1802‚Äì1806 Category:UK MPs 1807‚Äì1812 ","title":"John Denison (MP)"},{"id":"63787919","text":"Dino Costantini (born 18 October 1940) is an Italian equestrian.

Officially, the song was made as a tribute to Chinese and Filipino front-liners working amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines as well as to commemorate Chinese‚ÄìPhilippine relations. The song received a significant negative feedback from Filipinos for being perceived as a propaganda supporting the territorial claims of the People's Republic of China over the South China Sea. By July 2020, its music video posted in YouTube has received over 220,000 dislikes. == Lyrics == Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian wrote the lyrics for \\"Iisang Dagat\\". == Recording == \\"Iisang Dagat\\" was performed by Filipina Camarines Sur Vice Governor Imelda Papin, Filipino-Chinese singer Jhonvid Bangayan, Chinese diplomat Xia Wenxin and Chinese actor Yu Bin (who had a role in the 2019 Chinese television series, The Untamed). For at least Papin's part, she was approached by the Chinese embassy to perform \\"Iisang Dagat\\". The song had Chinese and Filipino lyrics. == Music video == The music video for \\"Iisang Dagat\\" was jointly produced by the Chinese Embassy in the Philippines with Chinatown TV, and Guizhou Xinpai Media Company. The video was uploaded on YouTube in Chinatown TV's channel, as well as on Facebook. Universal Records Philippines was credited for being involved in the music video. However the record label categorically stated they were not involved contrary to the credits on the music video. Universal Records however did mention that they were invited by Chinatown TV to help promote the song but the record label declined the offer. Statements supportive of China from various government officials including Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr., Health Secretary Francisco Duque were also featured in the video. It also featured Chinese medical workers coming in to help with the anti-COVID-19 efforts in the Philippines. == Reception == As of July 2020, the music video of \\"Iisang Dagat\\" in YouTube has received more than 4,000 likes and at least 220,000 dislikes. Criticism of the video includes perception that the song as a propaganda supportive of the Chinese government's stance in the South China Sea disputes. Imelda Papin in response to backlash insists she is not a \\"traitor\\", says that she was not aware that the song is a \\"propaganda\\" and narrated on how she was approached by the Chinese embassy to perform a song on \\"unity\\" which serves as a tribute to cooperation of Chinese and Filipino front-liners against the COVID-19 pandemic. Former Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio, who played a key role in the 2016 South China Sea arbitration decided by the Permanent Court of Arbitration, connected the title of the song to the position of the Chinese government on the South China Sea disputes. Carpio says that song title is an allusion to the South China Sea and has an implied message that China owns the South China Sea. He said that the video is part of a larger effort of China to influence public opinion to make up for its failures at the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Carpio attributed the disproportionate number of dislikes of \\"Iisang Dagat\\"'s YouTube music video as evidence that the move \\"boomeranged\\" on China making Filipinos \\"more angry at China\\". Jay Batongbacal, Director of the UP Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea says that the video is an attempt to placate Filipino public opinion following recent diplomatic protests filed over China's continued activity to assert its territorial claims in the South China Sea taking advantage of countries' preoccupation in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. \\"Save Our Seas\\", a 2019 song by Vietnamese rapper Tu P, Filipino rapper Marx Sickmind, and Malaysian singer Mei Lee which is about the South China Sea dispute as well as \\"Isang Bangka\\", a Philippine Navy institutional song by The Band gained traction following the release of \\"Iisang Dagat\\". == References == Category:South China Sea Category:China‚ÄìPhilippines relations Category:COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines Category:2020 songs Category:Songs about the COVID-19 pandemic ","title":"Iisang Dagat"},{"id":"63787973","text":"Tamkang University () is a light rail station of the Green Mountain line of the Danhai Light Rail, which is operated by New Taipei Metro.

It was the first \\"Apex\\" broadcasting station, i.e. the first to transmit programming intended for the general public over what was then known as \\"ultra-high short- wave\\" frequencies. W8XH primarily simulcast programming originating from a co- owned AM radio station, WBEN, but it also aired some original programs. It ceased broadcasting in July 1939, after the newspaper began to focus on operation of an experimental facsimile broadcasting station, W8XA, which in turn shut down shortly prior to World War II and was succeeded after the war by the FM broadcasting station known in the 21st Century as WTSS. ==History== The Buffalo Evening News first became involved with radio broadcasting in 1930, when it took over local radio station WMAK, which it renamed WBEN.\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 30, 1930, page 15. WBEN's staff soon began an ambitious series of research and development. In mid-1932 WBEN was issued licenses for two low-power transmitters, W8XD on 60.0 MHz, and W8XH on 51.4 MHz,\\"General and special experimental stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 30, 1932, page 7. The \\"8\\" in the call signs indicated that the stations were located in the 8th radio district, while the \\"X\\" reflected their operation as experimental stations. which were 10-watt portable units,\\"One of WBEN's Two New Short-Wave Transmitters\\", Buffalo Evening News, July 23, 1932, page 7. capable of being \\"strapped across the shoulders of one of WBEN's engineers\\".\\"Portable Transmitter to Aid WBEN in Covering Centennial\\", Buffalo Evening News, July 1, 1932, page 16. At this time W8XD and W8XH were both used for remote pickups to relay programming for broadcasting by WBEN. In the early 1930s, technical advances made it possible to transmit at much higher frequencies than before, and a number of organizations independently began applying for experimental licenses in order to investigate the potential of was then known as \\"ultra- high short-wave\\" transmissions. These signals tended to be limited to line-of- sight coverage, so there was a premium on placing antennas at high elevations, which led to the stations as a group becoming informally known as \\"Apex\\" stations. W8XH's experimental license was upgraded from its previous status as a relay transmitter, and it became first Apex station to be used for broadcasting entertainment to the general public. Regular broadcasts under this new configuration were begun on March 18, 1934, initially at 51.4 MHz (5.8 meters),\\"WBEN Short-Wave Station To Begin Broadcasts Sunday\\", Buffalo Evening News, March 17, 1934, page 4. and by April it was announced that the station was broadcasting five hours a day.\\"Features Planned For Ultra Waves\\" by Earnest H. Roy, Buffalo Evening News, April 13, 1934, page 34. The next month W8XH was reassigned to 41.0 MHz (7.3 meters), which it would use for the remainder of its broadcasts.\\"W8XH to Change Wave Length Soon\\", Buffalo Evening News, May 19, 1934, page 5. A review of W8XH's early operations, written by a WBEN technician, summarized its activities as: Because W8XH was operating under an experimental license, original programming had to be commercial-free. However, programs simulcast from WBEN were allowed to include the original commercials. W8XH underwent a major upgrade in January 1936,\\"Short Wave Listener: Mechanism of New W8XH Explained\\" by Earnest H.

Kingsley, Broadcast News, April 1936, pages 22, 31 (reprinted from Electronics) that fed into a crossed-dipole antenna, known as a \\"turnstile antenna\\", that had been developed by RCA's Dr. G. H. Brown. The antenna was mounted on a 70-foot (21 m) pole atop the Hotel Statler, 350 feet (105 m) above ground.\\"'Turnstile' Antenna Array at W8XH\\", Short Wave Craft, July 1936, page 138.

There apparently was no formal announcement when W8XH ultimately ended operations.

A vernacular name for the plant in the Afrikaans language is heuningkoeksuikerbos. ==Taxonomy== Protea sulphurea was first described by Edwin Percy Phillips in 1910. A type series (#3208) was originally collected by the German explorer Rudolf Marloth in 1903; there are at least three specimen sheets labelled as Marloth3208 housed at the Kew Herbarium. Another, possibly older, specimen was also collected by one Pearson (perhaps Thomas Pearson Stokoe), who was possibly the first European to collect this species. Phillips gives neither a type for the taxon, nor an etymology for the specific epithet. Otto Stapf designated the Pearson collection as the holotype in 1912, but in 1972 John Patrick Rourke overturned this for some reason, and selected one of the three sheets of Marloth's collections at Kew as the lectotype. ==Description== This species grows into a low, squat, woody, densely-branched shrub up to 0.5 1.8 or 2 m tall. The branches are glabrous. The leaves are glaucous (or yellowish when dry or during droughts), indistinctly veined, minutely rugulose (having a finely wrinkled surface and texture), long, and 6 to 13 mm broad. Their shape is either narrowly obovate-cuneate or oblanceolate. Protea sulphurea flower heads are pendulous; they hang upside down. The brightly-coloured involucral bracts are visible in this photograph. The flowers are produced from April to August, densely packed together within large inflorescences. These inflorescences, or more specifically pseudanthia (also called 'flower heads'), are almost sessile (having a very short and indistinct peduncle), and hang downwards towards the ground. They have a long receptacles which are conical in shape. The flower head is surrounded by petal-like structures called 'involucral bracts', these are glabrous and arranged in a series of nine or ten rows. The outer bracts have somewhat pointy ends, ovate in shape and minutely ciliate (having a fringe of hairs like an eyelash at their margins). The inner bracts are oblong or spathulate-oblong in shape, and are longer than the actual flowers. It is monoecious, both sexes occur in each flower. The petals and sepals of the flowers are fused into a tube-like, long perianth-sheath. This sheath is dilated, has three keels and six to seven veins on the lower portion, has an 8.5 mm lip, and generally glabrous except for a few setose (bristly, stiff) hairs from the base to near the upper parts of the outer surface. The lip is slightly recurved, has a few scattered setose hairs on it, and has three teeth at its end. The two outer of these teeth are longer than the middle one, at 1.4 mm long versus 1 mm. All of the stamens are fertile. Their filaments are 0.53 mm long and channelled. The anthers are linear and 4.8 mm long. The apical glands are 0.35 mm in length, ovate in shape and end in an acute point. There are oblong and obtuse (blunt) hypogynous scales which are 1.4 mm in length. The ovary is covered in long, spreading, yellow-brown hairs. The style is 2.65 mm long, falcate, compressed, glabrous and tapers towards both ends. The stigma is 5.3 mm long, with an obtuse end, grooved, and almost imperceptibly becomes the style. ===Similar species=== It is similar to Protea effusa, primarily differing in having conically-shaped receptacles within the inflorescence, and also to P. pendula, from which it differs by having wider leaves with indistinct venation. ==Distribution== The plant is endemic to the Western Cape province of South Africa. It is found distributed from the Hex River Mountains, through the Witteberg Mountains, to the Swartberg mountains and the Waboomsberg, which is one of the Koue Bokkeveld Mountains. It occurs near the town of Matjiesfontein. ==Gallery== File:Protea sulphurea linkie iNat11243666a.jpgProtea sulphurea bush File:Protea sulphurea linkie iNat11243666b.jpgProtea sulphurea flower head File:Protea sulphurea linkie iNat11243659.jpgProtea sulphurea flower head File:Protea sulphurea outramps- tanniedi iNat20173472b.jpgProtea sulphurea bush File:Protea sulphurea outramps-tanniedi iNat20173472d.jpgProtea sulphurea flower head File:Protea sulphurea nicky iNat20174151a.jpgProtea sulphurea bush File:Protea sulphurea nicky iNat20174151b.jpgProtea sulphurea flower head File:Protea sulphurea nicky iNat20174151c.jpgProtea sulphurea bush File:Protea sulphurea nicky iNat20174151d.jpgProtea sulphurea flower head ==Ecology== Mature plants are killed in the periodic wildfires which sweep its habitat, but the seeds can survive such occasions. It flowers in the Autumn and Winter, from April to August. The flowers are pollinated by birds. The fruits may be retained for a few years. Seeds are stored in seed heads on the plant and dispersed by means of the wind. ===Habitat=== It is found in arid areas, in a habitat which is most commonly fynbos, although near the town of Matjiesfontein it also grows in renosterveld in a shale-derived soil, as well as in the shale fynbos in that area. It is usually found growing in sandstone-derived soils, although a few populations, all found around Matjiesfontein, also grow here in a quartzite-derived substrate and the aforementioned shale. It is found at between 1,000 and 1,550 metres in altitude. ==Conservation== This species is not threatened. The state of the population numbers is considered stable. In 2009 the South African National Biodiversity Institute first assessed this species to have the conservation status of 'least concern', an opinion that was reiterated by the institute in 2019. ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== * sulphurea Category:Flora of the Cape Provinces ","title":"Protea sulphurea"},{"id":"63788282","text":"Dorcas Omanyo Oluwade is the Vice Chancellor of Salem University, Lokoja. == References == Category:Nigerian academics Category:Vice-Chancellors of Nigerian universities Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Dorcas Oluwade"},{"id":"63788295","text":"right Radboud van Beekum (20 October 1950 13 April 2020) was a Dutch furniture designer and furthermore an architectural researcher and writer. == Biography == Born in Rijswijk, Van Beekum studied architectural design at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam.

With most species of ant that live in association with trees, the ants prune the foliage of adjoining trees to prevent other ecologically dominant arboreal ants from invading their territory. That is not the case with T. tessmanni, because the very nature of a liana means it is constant contact with other vegetation. Instead, the ant has developed certain traits that enable it to maintain dominance and V. thyrsiflora can be considered a specialized myrmecophyte, because all mature specimens are found to be colonised by the ant. Shoots of V. thyrsiflora consists of a series of nodes, and the ants create entrance holes at the node junctions, and link the nodes internally by chewing holes between them to form their domatia (specialised chambers adapted for habitation by ants). The nodes initially contain pith but this dries up in older shoots. Other insects are associated with plants and may try to colonise the nodes of V. thyrsiflora, but T. tessmanni is the only ant to create entrance holes (although this is also done by the beetle Ischnolanguria concolor). T. tessmanni is a very aggressive ant and seems capable of establishing its dominance over the liana, which may be or so long. The supercolony may occupy the whole liana as it grows and have multiple queens. The ants patrol the liana and drive away herbivorous insects, but they do not feed on honeydew or nectar, nor do they leave their host liana to obtain food elsewhere, but they seem to extract all their nourishment from the interior of the nodes which they rasp to create wound callus. The ant larvae have their heads orientated ventrally, fleshy appendages on the thoracic and first abdominal segments, and hooked hairs on their dorsal surfaces, by which they are hung from the roof of the domatia. These appendages seem to act as a sort of gland known as an \\"exudia\\", with the larvae being fed by mouth and producing a fatty exudate from the gland which is licked off by the workers. ==References== Category:Pseudomyrmecinae Category:Hymenoptera of Africa Category:Insects described in 1910 ","title":"Tetraponera tessmanni"},{"id":"63788377","text":"Rudy Hayes (January 12, 1935 ‚Äì February 15, 2020) was an American football linebacker.

An army veteran and taxi driver, he murdered a police officer in January 1980 with the intention of using the officer's gun to rob a bank. He carried out the robbery on April 14, 1982 and was captured and executed within six weeks. However, before his capture, the police had wrongly arrested another man and produced a false confession using torture; the suspect committed suicide whilst in police custody. Lee gained a reputation as \\"Taiwan‚Äôs Robin Hood\\" due to his anger at the ‚Äúnouveau riche‚Äù class and a golden statue was erected in his honor in New Taipei City, whilst legal reforms were introduced to prevent false confessions and police torture. ==Early life and education== Lee was born in 1927 in Changle County, Shandong and moved to Qingdao, before joining the Chinese army at the age of 13. He was a guerilla soldier in the Second Sino-Japanese War. He ended up in Taiwan following the Nationalist retreat at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. He retired due to illness in 1959 and became a mechanic and taxi driver. He had a good reputation with friends and neighbors, and was popular with children. ==Career== ===Murder=== In January 1980, Lee murdered a special police officer, Li Shengyuan, shooting him at close range with a homemade pistol at the Holy See embassy in Taipei. He committed the murder specifically to take possession of a good quality police revolver, with the intention of using it to rob a bank. He then spent the next two years planning which bank to rob. ===Bank robbery=== On April 14, 1982, Lee entered the Land Bank of Taiwan's Guting branch in Taipei disguised in a wig, baseball cap, and surgical mask. Showing a .38 revolver, he demanded NT$10 million from bank employees. He told them that: \\"This money belongs to the country, but your life belongs to you\\". He shot and injured the assistant branch manager and left with around NT$5.3 million. ===Arrest=== The police arrested another man, Wang Ying-hsien (ÁéãËøéÂÖà), and prised a false confession out of him. Wang soon died in an apparent suicide attempt after jumping into a river whilst pretending to guide the police to the location of the stolen money and weapon. The police had suspected Wang as he had a strong resemblance to Lee; both men were taxi drivers, and some physical evidence was found near Wang's home. Wang had been reported to the police by his daughter's boyfriend, who wanted to claim the NT$2 million reward money. The police arrested Lee just hours after Wang's death. A friend of Lee had reported him to the police after he found Lee stashing the stolen money in his apartment. The police recovered NT$4 million at the friend's house; Lee had already spent between NT$50,000 and NT$140,000 of the takings on home appliances, jewelry, and prostitutes. Lee admitted to the crimes, allegedly under torture, saying he had committed the robbery to \\"provide for myself in old age. It costs money to womanize, it costs money to gamble, it costs money to buy things!\\" However, Lee also told United Daily News reporters that he robbed the bank as a societal protest against the \\"nouveau riche\\" and that the money that he hid away was a gift so that his friend's daughter could afford a college education. Lee had also previously been denied a bank loan. With Taiwan under martial law, Lee had a swift trial and was executed on May 26, five days after his sentencing. ==Legacy== A sign telling customers to remove masks and helmets. Lee achieved a reputation as \\"Taiwan's Robin Hood\\" due to his claim that the robbery was partly a political statement against the country's financial elite, and the murder of the police officer was justified by his supporters who claimed the officer was an informant for the Japanese government. A golden statue of Lee was erected as a menshen (threshold guardian) at Wutianchan Shrine (ÁÑ°Â§©Á¶™ÂØ∫) in New Taipei City‚Äôs Xindian District; this shrine is often referred to as the \\"Lee Shih-ke shrine\\". Lee's statue was originally paired with one of Liao Tianding, another historical robber and murderer who is now revered as a folk hero in Taiwan. The robbery has been portrayed in several films and television series. After the robbery, customers entering Taiwanese banks were required to remove any surgical masks or motorcycle helmets that they were wearing. Nevertheless, Lee's crime inspired similar bank robberies in Taiwan, including one in Kaohsiung shortly after his arrest. One police officer, Chen Yihuang, was sentenced to prison in relation to the torture and subsequent death of Wang. Reforms were also made to help prevent false confessions and police torture, giving suspects a right to a lawyer during questioning; this became known as the \\"Wang Yingxian Article\\". ==References== Category:1927 births Category:1982 deaths Category:1982 in Taiwan Category:People from Weifang Category:Military personnel of the Republic of China in the Second Sino- Japanese War Category:Chinese Civil War refugees Category:Taiwanese people from Shandong Category:Taiwanese criminals Category:Taiwanese people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by Taiwan Category:Executed Taiwanese people Category:People executed by Taiwan by firearm Category:People executed for murdering police officers Category:Civilians who were court- martialed Category:Bank robbers Category:Taxicab drivers ","title":"Lee Shih-ke"},{"id":"63788450","text":"Exodus () is a 2020 Iranian drama film written and directed by Ebrahim Hatamikia. Exodus narrates the story of Rahmat Bakhshi, a war veteran and his fellow hard-working Cotton farmers that lose all their crops after their farms are inadvertently inundated with salt water from a local dam. So they drive their Tractors to the Presidential Administration in protest. Exodus screened for the first time at the Fajr International Film Festival and has created the most recent controversy. Its public premiere has started from 12 April 2020. == Production == Ebrahim Hatamikia after making of The Report of a Party (2011), had had an idea to product a film about people's protest against the rulers but didn't reach to an appropriate story until January 2019. At the late 2018, he heard about a real protestical event which occurred on a small town. Hatamikia liked the story, so began screenwriting of Exodus at early 2019. Shoting of Exodus begun from a village of Gachsaran County and ended at Qom. == Music == Music of Exodus composed by Karen Homayounfar. Homayounfar formerly had collaborated with Hatamikia in The Green Ring (2007‚Äì2008), The Report of a Party (2011), Bodyguard (2016) and Damascus Time (2018). == Release == Exodus scheduled to premier from March 2020 but the decision eliminated due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and released online. Exodus is the first feature film in Iran which had begun its public premiere on video on demand distribution system. Furthermore, it has named the first film in the Islamic Republic of Iran, that screened at a Drive-in theater. == Reception == === Critical response === Hatamikia's technical ambitions after Che (2014), Bodyguard (2016) and Damascus Time (2018) continues here. Tehran Times newspaper names Exodus as a Road movie which reminding the audience of the Classical Western movies. It also describes Wide shots of the Cotton and Corn farms and close-ups of the main character with his very believable and well-done makeup are \\"eye-catching\\". Faramarz Gharibian portrays Rahmat gracefully, making the audience believe the character's miserable life, which fuels his deep anger, is only visible in his eyes. Everything seems fine, but the problem starts when Hatamikia tries to turn the film into a tribune to express his political views. It seems the film is accusing the current government. Kayhan newspaper noted the movie has a \\"reasonable, calm and firm\\" protest which against of Joker's \\"revolt theory\\". Parviz Jahed, a notable Iranian Critic, wrote Exodus has signs of Road movies such as The Straight Story (David Lynch, 1999) and The Sugarland Express (Steven Spielberg, 1974), Western movies such as Unforgiven (Clint Eastwood, 1992) and Peasant movies such as Viva Zapata! (Elia Kazan, 1952) and The Grapes of Wrath (John Ford, 1940) but it doesn't belong to a particular genre and comes to mind that is similar to former Soviet Union's Patriotic and Socialist realism movies. === Controversy === Iranian Moderates accused Hatamikia to please the country's hard-liners, pointing out that the film was financed by Owj Arts and Media Organization, which is tied to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. During a press conference, Hatamikia denied that he has ever made films on request, or ever will. The film was lambasted by Reformists immediately, who described it as a propaganda film commissioned by the radicals to undermine Hassan Rouhani. The government-run Iran newspaper described the film as \\"superficial\\" and \\"laughable\\". Reformist Entekhab news site said Hatamikia's talents as a filmmaker were diminishing and the only way he could get funding was by directly hitting the President. == Awards == { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Award ! scope=\\"col\\"  Date of ceremony ! scope=\\"col\\"  Section ! scope=\\"col\\"  Category ! scope=\\"col\\"  Recipient(s) ! scope=\\"col\\"  Result ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  - ! rowspan=\\"5\\" scope=\\"row\\"  Fajr Film Festival  rowspan=\\"5\\"  February 11, 2020  rowspan=\\"5\\"  Simorgh Competition   Faramarz Gharibian   style=\\"text- align:center;\\" rowspan=\\"5\\"  -  Best Sound ( and )  Amir Nobakht, Arash Ghasemi  -  Best Costume Design  Maral Jeyrani  -   Mehrdad Mirkiani  -   Mohammad Baradaran  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Hafez Awards  August 15, 2020  Cinema  Best Actor  Faramarz Gharibian   style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  } == References == == Further reading == * == External links == * * * Category:2020 films Category:Films about farmers Category:Films directed by Ebrahim Hatamikia Category:Iranian films Category:Iranian drama films ","title":"Exodus (2020 film)"},{"id":"63788457","text":"Abigail Forsyth (born 1971) is a former lawyer and business entrepreneur.

Military bands in the United Kingdom are the musical units that serve for protocol and ceremonial duties as part of the British Armed Forces. They have been the basis and inspiration for many military bands in the former British Empire and the larger Commonwealth of Nations as well as musical organizations in other countries. Military musical units with British influence include United States military bands, the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force Music Corps and the Military Band of Athens. British military bands are controlled by the military music departments of the three services that compose the armed forces. These include the Royal Marines Band Service (Royal Navy), the Corps of Army Music (British Army), and the Royal Air Force Music Services (Royal Air Force). British style brass bands and carnival bands were then and are currently inspired by the British Armed Forces and its brass bands, especially of the Army's regular and reserve formations, as they follow a similar format as it relates to brass and percussion (plus optional woodwind) instruments. ==History== ===Early development, medieval era and 17th century=== British military music was unsophisticated until the Crusades (from the late 11th century). Trumpeters and drummers in the field sufficed as a medium for communication, as did pipers, and later fifers, whose further remit was to frighten the enemy. Casualty clearance and first aid became their dual roll. The oldest military band in the British military is the Royal Artillery Band, which traces its origins back to 1557 at the Battle of St. Quentin. King Charles II of England studied French Army music during the reign of King Louis XIV of France. Upon regaining the throne, he began implementing French musical traditions. 1678 saw the introduction of six hautbois instruments in the Band of the Horse Grenadier Guards. Most British regiments of the line adopted this new instrumentation by 1690.A HISTORY OF U.S. ARMY BANDS ===18th and 19th centuries=== The Duke of Gloucester's Band in 1811. During the 17th and 18th centuries, soldiers marched to the beat of the drum from the day they were recruited in their localities. Drummers, many of them teenagers by the time they were recruited, were also responsible for punishing soldiers who were sentenced to be flogged with whips. The average age of the 304 drummers at Waterloo was 25, with about 10% being boys under 16. The Artillery Band, which were mere \\"drumme and phifes\\" for close to 200 years until 1762, was made 'official' that year. Regimental bands in the Foot Guards were first formed between 1783 and 1785. The 1st Foot Guards Band was known as the Duke of York's Band and the 3rd Foot Guards band was known as the Duke of Gloucester's Band. In 1854, during the Crimean War, a parade in Scutari (nowadays Turkey), to celebrate the Queen Victoria's birthday was held, during which twenty British Army bands performed the national anthem. As a result of the bands playing God Save the Queen in different instrumentations and key signatures, the Royal Military School of Music was established that year as the primary training school for all musicians of the army's bands. In the corps of drums of the line infantry units, while fifes and drums had been played for centuries, beginning in the 1850s bugles began to be adopted in such formations. Until 1837, Army bands sported the Turkish crescent as part of the band percussion section, a tradition introduced from the Ottoman Empire and its military bands in the 18th century. While the Army's band tradition blossomed, this was also the case for the Royal Navy and thru it, the Royal Marines, whose bands were present in almost every naval engagement since the first bands were established in 1664-65 under Army control, these would later be transferred to the RN in 1755. By the 18th century, Royal Marines bands were established in Deal, Chatham, Plymouth and Portsmouth, each providing musical support to RM units, as well as to all naval servicemen, stationed in these areas. In 1805, with the establishment of yet another division in Woolwich came the raising of yet another band. It would only be in the late 19th century that the tradition of bands and bugles would arrive in the rifle regiments of the Army, as well as in the Gurkha units (which would later also adopt the Scottish tradition of pipes and drums). The bugle sections replaced the regular corps of drums of these units due to the use of the bugle instead of the drum as a signalling instrument for the rifle regiments due to their skirmishing role. It would only be in the 1960s when the tradition of bugle sections would be adopted by the light infantry regiments within the UK. ===20th century=== By the early 20th Century, regimental infantry and cavalry bands in the British Army, were well-balanced, highly versatile groups of musicians. Their battlefield role dwindled with the advancement of technology and modern warfare. At the time, bugle and trumpet calls were still used to signal on the battlefield, with all other aspects remaining unused except for ceremonial events. During both the First and Second World Wars bandsmen would act as stretcher bearers, dispatch riders, and serve in other non-combatant roles, while the field musicians remained in the heavy weapons or combat support role. With the reduction in size of the army, the need for battalion and event to an extent, regimental bands became obsolete and were seen as a strain in the national economy rather than a cultural symbol. The same case happened to bands of the Royal Navy (including Royal Marines) and the Royal Air Force, even as both services began to follow the lead of the army with the formation of their schools of music in 1902 and 1918, respectively. During the Second World War, aware of the growing need of women in service in the armed forces each service branch would create all-women's military bands. None of such bands exist today, but since 1991, when the RAF Music Services began including regular women musicians, all the branches of the British Armed Forces have bands made up of experienced musicians of both genders. In 1947, the Royal Artillery Mounted, Portsmouth and Salisbury Plain bands, along with the bands of six of the larger Corps, were granted the status of staff bands, most of which were based at permanent locations. In 1984, four staff bands were disbanded and the remaining bands were reduced considerably. This hit regimental and battalion bands particularly hard, reducing their size to just 21 bandsmen. Most of the infantry regiments which then had three battalions instead opted for two bands with 35 bandsmen each. ===Impact of Options for Change and present day=== A series of army reviews were given in 1994, resulting in the reduction of the number of army military bands from 69 to 22 bands and with that, the number of personnel decreased from 2,000 to 1,100.https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/1974-07-22/debates/ec16247c-f2a4-4ba3-b355-74f8667c53d7/Bands At the time of the changes, bands in regiments/corps usually had four bands (attached to battalions). Unit bands were being merged and branch bands began to be created. Similarly, the Royal Marines went through a reorganization of its band. This officially brought an end to the long history of regular regimental bands. The Government of the United Kingdom justified this action by saying that it will see money in the budget. The year prior music critic Richard Morrison of The Times noted: \\"One of the oddest statistics about British cultural life is that the Defense Ministry spends more to maintain military bands than the government spends on all the professional orchestras and opera companies in the country.\\" ==Classifications== ===State bands in London=== A \\"state band\\" refers to a military band based in London, the national capital, and has particular public duties in serving the British royal family and representing the British Armed Forces. Bands of the Household Division and the Household Cavalry The Bands of the Household Division lead the procession of the Royal Family's return from Trooping the Colour in 2018. The Bands of the Household Division are the amalgamated five military bands of the Foot Guards regiments in London. It performs during public duties events in the capital, particularly those that involve the British royal family. It consists of the following regimental bands: * Band of the Coldstream Guards * Band of the Grenadier Guards * Band of the Irish Guards * Band of the Scots Guards * Band of the Welsh Guards The massed bands numbers around 250 musicians who are report directly to CAMUS rather than their home regiments. They commonly perform during the Changing of the Guard ceremony at Buckingham Palace, as well as larger ceremonies such as the annual Trooping the Colour. Similarly, both the Household Cavalry regiments have a unified mounted band, the Mounted Band of the Household Cavalry (since 2014) and also their own regimental quick and slow marches. The Mounted Band of the Household Cavalry and the Massed Bands of the Household Division perform at Trooping the Colour, an annual ceremony held every June on Horse Guards Parade to mark the official Queen's Birthday celebrations. The Massed Bands and the Mounted Band play a central role in this ceremony. The term \\"Massed Bands\\" denotes the formation of more than one separate band performing together, whether belonging to one or more regiments, or indeed countries. Unlike the regiments they all support, all bands are manned by both men and women musicans of the CAMUS. Other state bands The Royal Artillery Band (being the oldest band in the British Army), was the last regular army band to be accorded \\"state band\\" status. It lost this status when it, along with the Royal Artillery, vacated Woolwich Barracks in 2007. The band held the status of a state band twice before, during the reigns of King George II, King George III, and Queen Victoria. It was often in demand for important state and public duties, and was the favourite band of major figures such as King George IV, Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, Queen Victoria, and Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The number of regular army state bands, was further reduced on 1 September 2014, when the Band of the Life Guards and the Band of The Blues and Royals were merged. At around the same time the Bands of the Honourable Artillery Company and the Royal Yeomanry in the Army Reserve were both granted State Band status. ===Regional bands=== In 2019, the regular Army reorganized bands to a new co-location practice in which 11 of the smaller bands in three major garrisons and Sandhurst has increased the flexibility of the Corps of Music to perform at a larger number of events. These bands are organised as follows: *British Army Bands Catterick **Band of the Royal Armoured Corps **Band of The King's Division **Band of the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers *British Army Bands Colchester **Band of the Parachute Regiment **Band of the Army Air Corps **Band of the Queen's Division *British Army Bands Sandhurst **Band of the Royal Logistic Corps **Band of the Royal Corps of Signals *British Army Bands Tidworth **Royal Artillery Band **Band of the Corps of Royal Engineers **Band of the Adjutant General's Corps The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment's Corp of Drums at the Lord Mayor's Show in 2010 The British Army also has 20 Reserve Military Bands located across the United Kingdom and across the world:FAM 2020 *England: ** Band of the Honourable Artillery Company ** The Inns of Court and City Yeomanry (Band of the Royal Yeomanry) ** Lancashire Artillery Volunteers Band ** The Nottinghamshire Band of the Royal Engineers ** The (Northern) Band of the Royal Corps of Signals ** Band of the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's Lancashire and Border) ** Band of the Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th & 33rd/76th Foot) ** Band of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers ** Band of the Royal Anglian Regiment ** The Band of the Mercian Regiment ** The Salamanca Band of The Rifles ** The Waterloo Band of The Rifles ** Band of 150 Regiment, Royal Logistic Corps ** Band of the Army Medical Services *Scotland: ** Lowland Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland ** Highland Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland *Wales: ** Band of the Royal Welsh - The only Brass Band in the Army Reserve ** Band of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires) *Northern Ireland: ** Band of The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling) 83rd and 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment) *Overseas: ** Volunteer Band of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment ** Band and Corps of Drums of the Royal Bermuda Regiment These bands range in personnel number from 64 to 15 and include the traditional marching, mounted and concert bands, as well as rock bands and a show bands. The Royal Marines Band Service is organized into six regional bands: *Band of HM Royal Marines, Portsmouth (HMS Nelson) *Band of HM Royal Marines, Plymouth (HMS Raleigh) *Band of HM Royal Marines, Scotland (HMS Caledonia, Rosyth) *Band of HM Royal Marines, HMS Collingwood (formerly the Band of Britannia Royal Naval College) *Band of HM Royal Marines, Commando Training Centre Royal Marines *Band of the Royal Marines School of Music, Portsmouth The Central Band of the Royal Air Force and the Band of the Royal Air Force Regiment are the unit bands representing the Royal Air Force in the national capital. They are both based at RAF Northolt. The RAF Cranwell-based Band of the Royal Air Force College is the sole regional band of the Royal Air Force, and it shares its barracks with the sole reserve band of this branch, the Band of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. ===Civil- military bands=== There are various volunteer reservist bands affiliated with the British military, mirroring and styling themselves after regular forces bands. For example, The Royal British Legion maintains its own marching/concert bands. The various uniformed military cadet organizations have their own bands that use the same aforementioned formations. All Army Cadet Force and Royal Air Force Air Cadets share their bands and use the general formation used in both services (the exception being that several RAF Air Cadet bands such as the National Marching Band have drums corps at the front of their formations similarly to the naval service). The Sea Cadet Corps (United Kingdom), Royal Marines Volunteer Cadet Corps and the Combined Cadet Force bands utilize the standard musical practices of the RM. Brentwood Imperial Youth Band The Duke of York's Royal Military School Ceremonial Band is the largest outside the Ministry of Defence and is larger than the Bands of the Foot Guards. ===Colonial bands=== The first recorded instance of a local colonial military band was in 1653 in the New Hampshire militia. Notable British colonial unit bands include but are not limited to: *Band of the King's African Rifles *Band of the Royal Hong Kong Regiment *Bombay Sappers Band *Band of the Royal Grenadiers *Band of the New South Wales Corps *Band of the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot ===Pipe bands=== The Scottish Highlands was where the modern Great Highland Bagpipe was developed. It can be traced directly to the MacCrimmon family in the Isle of Skye, who were hereditary Pipers to the MacLeods between 1600 and 1825. Scottish Regiments and played a major role in the development of Pipe Bands. Between 1740 and 1840, Highland Chiefs who raised Regiments had personal Pipers to accompany with them. It was only in 1854 that pipers were recognised officially by the War Office as distinct roles. Army pipe bands were developed around the mid-1800s, when regimental pipers and rummers performed during long route marches. The head piper became known as the Pipe Major, modelled after the drum major. As the British Empire expanded, so its Scottish troops travelled the world taking with them their national music. In the mid to late 1800s the Scottish form soon would be adopted by the British Army in Ireland for soldiers coming from units of Irish descent, and they are still in use today. Bagpipes are generally considered to be a motivational tool for British troops, particularly those of Scottish and Irish descent. Today the pipes and drums of British Army and Royal Air Force formations contain bagpipes and a percussion section of bass drums, Scottish form tenor drums (save for the Brigade of Gurkhas, whose pipe bands do not have these) and highland snare/side drums. These bands are led by a Drum Major with the Pipe Major being the seniormost bagpiper in the unit. All bagpipers carry the pipe banners of their units with their instruments. All the members of these formations wear Scottish/Irish/Gurkha full dress uniforms, with the flat cap for the Brigade of Gurkhas, tartan kilts in unit colours and black feather bonnets for those of Scottish formations, and the caubeen and brown kilts for both the Irish Guards and the Royal Irish Regiment. The drummers of both the Scots and Irish Guards wear their bearskins in full dress. ===Band and Bugles=== The Band of the Brigade of Gurkhas during the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo in 2010. The use of the silver bugle was pioneered by The Rifles (and its predecessor regiments) as a way of communicating on the battlefield. Their use date back to practices developed during the Napoleonic Wars and even as far back as the American Revolutionary War. Buglers are trained to play the bugle and a fast march of 140 paces per minute. They sound a bugle call followed by a quick drum beat to signal a quick march, which is a break of tradition for regular bands that use a regular drum beat. These types of bands never performs slow marches except during occasions that require it (i.e. Trooping of the Colour, Presentation of Colours, Changing of the Queen's Guard). Today, the Band and Bugles of The Rifles is the only one of its kind and with that specific naming custom in the British Army. The Band of the Brigade of Gurkhas also has similar customs to the former bands and bugles of the Light Division. Just like in the former bands of the rifle and Gurkha infantry regiments these bands are led by a Bugle Major, assisted by the Director of Music or Bandmaster. The Band of the Rifles maintains the traditional bugle platoon stationed at the head of the band made up of buglers from each of the battalions, a tradition formerly in force in the bands of the rifle regiments. Since 2007, the Band of the Brigade of Gurkhas has a small bugle section mirroring that of the Rifles, a tradition formerly of the military bands of each of the Gurkha rifle battalions and regiments. In addition, the reserve Band of the Royal Irish Regiment (under the Army Reserve) is modelled after that of The Rifles, as the regiment, while maintaining the traditions of the former namesake unit disbanded in 1922 following the Irish War of Independence, honours the traditions of both the light infantry Royal Irish Rangers and the line infantry Ulster Defence Regiment, themselves successors to the long line of line and light infantry regiments of Irish service in the regular and reserve ranks of the Army. ===Corps of Drums=== Corps of drums are a common occurrence in the armed forces, particularly the army and the navy. Operationally, corps of drums are deployed as a specialist platoon that serve as assault pioneers or force protection. Having previously carried a shortsword bearing the Royal Cypher as a weapon, many also carry an SA80 bayonet as an alternative. Each infantry battalion except for the Royal Regiment of Scotland, Royal Irish Regiment and the two remaining Rifle Regiments (Rifles and Royal Gurkha Rifles), as well as the Royal Marines maintain corps of drums. They were previously a part of formations of the Royal Air Force. The main instrument used is a snare drum, the latest version (97s-pattern) of which include a metal rod-tension and plastic heads. Another instrument used is the five key flute, typically pitched in B-flat. Common tunes such as The British Grenadiers and Hazelmere are traditionally played by military corps of drums. A range of percussion instruments such as a bass drum, tenor drums and cymbals (plus the optional glockenspiel) are also used addition to the previously mentioned instruments. All musicians save for the bass drummers, tenor drummers and cymbalists carry bugles with their instruments, which they also play not just bugle calls but also a number of marches. Notable corps of drums are maintained in units such as the Honourable Artillery Company and the Royal Logistic Corps. In the RLC, the corps of drums of that formation is more of a drumline that is famed for a \\"black light\\" display, which is a modern touch that makes it very distinct from its predecessors and counterparts. Royal Marines Corps of Drums Buglers in the Royal Marines are also trained side drummers and are situated at the front of the band. They also have experience in Herald Fanfare Trumpets. They trace themselves to the raising of the RM in 1664 with six drummers attached to each of the foundation companies that made up the first regiment of marines in the UK. Today, there are 60 buglers of the RM who carry out duties ranging from repatriation services to mass displays. All are qualified members of the Royal Marines Band Service and are alumni of the prestigious Royal Marines School of Music. Until 1949, all RM units sported separate corps of drums, today, they form a vital part of all the six bands of the RMBS. Drummers in the 18th century were distinguished in their regimental \\"reversed colours\\" uniforms. For example, an infantry regiment that wore a red coat with yellow facings as its uniform would gave drummers who would wear yellow coats with red facings. Today corps of drums are allowed to parade in Army Combat Uniforms as well as full dress uniforms such as modern day versions of the aforementioned uniforms. All corps of drums in the Army and the RM are led by a Drum Major, who is drawn from the ranks of the veteran drummers of the formation. In RM corps of drums, a Bugle Major serves as the senior drummer-bugler and second in command. ===Mounted bands=== For many years, beginning when timpani and fanfare trumpets were adopted by the cavalry of the old English military, a tradition that would be adopted in Scotland after the 1707 merger of the twin armies, the British Army sported a long and faithful tradition of mounted bands in the whole of the United Kingdom, first brass only and soon brass and woodwind mixed with the traditional timpani on drum horses and the fanfare trumpets. Up until the 1930s, each British Army cavalry regiment, as well as the Royal Horse Artillery, sported a mounted band with a mounted timpanist on the drum horse, with bands being occasionally massed up on parades. Until that decade, the timpani in the bands of the light cavalry units carried the battle honours of their respective formations, which would be the case until 1952, when guidons were reinstated. Almost all the bands became dismounted in the 1930s, with only the bands of the Household Cavalry's now current two regiments maintaining the long tradition. By then, the British Army's cavalry mounted band tradition had already spread to a number of Commonwealth countries. Today, the sole 64-strong Mounted Band of the Household Cavalry, created in 2014 with the merger of the by now two surviving bands and thus is the largest of all the bands in the regular Army proper, maintains the long heritage and traditions of the mounted band in the United Kingdom, with the band sporting two drumhorses and mounted fanfare trumpeters in mounted formation. The band is led by a Director of Music, previously the case in the mounted staff bands (with bandmasters leading the regimental bands). In addition, the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, the oldest regiment of the Royal Armoured Corps, maintains a drum horse and is very much unique in having a mounted timpanist who wears a distinctive white bearskin on the full dress, granted to that regiment by the late Tsar Nicholas II, the Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Scots Greys (whose lineage is honoured by the current unit), who perished during the Russian Civil War in 1918. He wears, with the rest of said regiment, a black band on the peaked cap in remembrance of their honorary colonel worn with the service dress, but does not have that on the bearskin cap. The Queen's Royal Hussars also have a drum horse, but that regiment maintains the honour of being the only one with engraved battle honours on its timpani carried on parades, a tradition used by its predecessor units. ==Traditions== ===By service=== Navy All the Royal Marine Bands (and former Royal Navy bands) have a Corps of Drums (composed of snare drums, bass and tenor drums and cymbals) in the lead of their bands, following the practice in the former line infantry regimental bands of the British Army. This tradition can be traced to 1902, when Lt. George Miller, then Senior Bandmaster of the Royal Marine Light Infantry, began adopting the practice in time for the Coronation Review that year in Aldershot, following the traditions of the line infantry bands of the Army. The tradition of such a formation has been later adopted by the bands of several Commonwealth armed forces. All are led by a Drum Major with the conductor/director of music stationed at the rear rank behind the band. The formation of bands in the RM are currently followed by the Royal Navy Volunteer Bands, all manned by volunteer musicians, either civilians, retired personnel or active musicians of the Armed Forces. All wear Royal Navy uniforms while some personnel wear the uniforms of their branch. In April 2019, it was announced that the tiger skin pelts that are traditionally worn by Royal Marine drummers were to be replaced by synthetic fur. The tradition of wearing tiger skin for the bass and tenor drummers while on parade dates back to the 18th century, introduced by a number of African bandsmen who served in the bands of the RM during those times.https://www.forces.net/news/tiger-skins-worn-royal-marine-bands-are-be- replaced Army The repertoire of army bands are distinct to the regiment/corps they belong. Army bands typically have first priority in the changing of the Queen's Guard at Buckingham Palace, with the Household Division (Foot Guards and the Band of the Household Cavalry) taking centerstage in most occasions. All personnel wear the full or service dress uniforms, the former with the colours of their respective formations, save for the Household Cavalry, whose band uses in important occasions the 1665 State Dress. Until 1994, all Army active and reserve regimental bands of the line infantry (sans the Light Division) followed a similar band setup to that of the Royal Marines Band Service, and in many occasions the corps of drums of these regiments fronted up the band. When marching, the band's director of music is usually situated within the band's ranks while the drum major marches at the head of the formation. In line infantry regimental bands, the drum major fronted the combined formation at the front of the Corps of Drums/Pipes and Drums while the conductor or director of music was at the front of the trombone or tuba file rank of the band proper. Several bands however followed the Foot Guards tradition, stationing the snare drums at the front with the remainder of the corps in the rear ranks. Those of the Foot Guards bands have their drum major fronting the front rank of musicians, the director of music in the middle, and the corps of drums (and in the case of the Scots and Irish Guards, pipes and drums) at the rear ranks. In the light infantry, the bugle major led the band and bugles with the conductor or bandmaster marching besides him. Air Force RAF bandsmen wear a modified uniform which; from 2012, is worn with the peaked cap rather than the busby; which has been historically worn by the band. It is now referred to as Number 9 Service Dress. The tradition of the busby dates back from 1918, when the RAF was created, since the Royal Flying Corps, one of the two air forces that formed the branch, was manned at its foundation by personnel from both the cavalry regiments and the Royal Engineers, however it was adopted by the service bands in the 1970s. In 2017, the RAF broke tradition by appointing Sergeant Hilary Rosenthal to the position of Deputy Drum Major for the Band of the RAF Regiment. ===Drum Major=== Most military bands are issued a set of regalia, which typically include a baldric worn by the Drum-Major charged with the distinctive unit insignia of the unit to which the band is assigned and, frequently, other symbols as well such as miniature campaign streamers; a chrome mace carried by the Drum-Major and engraved with the unit's name; and a special mural unique to the unit used to wrap the band's drums. Drum majors often augment their uniforms with bearskin helmets, peaked caps, busby hats or pith helmets as headdress and white leather gauntlets. The Drum Majors of all RM bands wear the pith helmet as part of their full dress uniform. For those of the Foot Guards, their drum majors wear the 1665 State Dress as their full dress on royal occasions due to their role as personnel drummers to the Queen, who is the Colonel-in-Chief of all five regiments. This pattern is the very uniform commissioned by King Charles II for the drummers, trumpeters and timpanists of the Household Division then, and is in gold with the royal cypher of the reigning monarch and Colonel in Chief of the Household Division, with the cypher on the baldric. All five band drum majors, as well as the drum majors of the corps of drums and pipes and drums, wear round jockey caps in the full state dress and bearskins in the service state dress with the hackles of their units. These drum majors thus do not salute during state ceremonies, but during state arrival ceremonies and international sports competitions and events held in the London area they salute during the playing of the national anthems. The ceremonial leader of a band and bugles is known as a Bugle Major, who unlike other military drum majors, utilizes a shorter mace that is carried at the side of the torso. The Bugle Major wears, as part of the full dress uniform, a shako as headdress with the hackle of his unit (the flat cap for the bugle major of the Band of the Brigade of Gurkhas). A similar uniform is worn by the drum major of the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, but he wears the caubeen instead. === Drum beat rolls to commence playing === The beating of the drumline to commence the playing of marches has been a uniquely British tradition since the Middle Ages and became a formal part in the mid-19th century, done by all the bands and field formations under the Armed Forces. Two triple pace drum rolls are the standard in all the bands save the Household Division (dismounted Band of the Household Cavalry and the Foot Guards) which use a unique five beat pace drum roll, the custom used by the Band of the Royal Armoured Corps while parading with the heavy cavalry (and formerly in use within the bands of these regiments). A unique seven-pace drum roll is used by all RAF bands. === Timpanists/Kettledrummers and fanfare trumpeters of the Band of the Household Cavalry and formerly of all mounted bands === The tradition of timpanists or kettledrummers and occasionally fanfare trumpeters leading their unit mounted bands on parade is a tradition that traces its origins to the timpanists and natural (later chromatic) fanfare trumpeters of the English armies of the medieval era and into the era of the Renaissance, wherein these musicians sounding trumpet calls and long rolls on the timpani while mounted provided the background for the charging ranks of English and later Scottish cavalrymen on the battlefield. During the Restoration, the Household Cavalry under King Charles II sported these instruments on parade, training, and actual battles, as well as on ceremonial and public duties and other royal events. This was a practice that would be later adopted by the then Dragoon and Horse regiments by the time a unified British Army came into being in 1707. By the late 18th century, these kettledrummers and trumpeters were now joined by a number of musicians, at least in the then twin regiments of Life Guards and the Royal Horse Guards, forming the basis of their mounted bands, which would be a trend later in the 19th, when all the line cavalry regiments of the Army (Dragoon Guards, Dragoons, Hussars and Lancers), all had mounted bands of brass and woodwind instrumentalists, a percussion section when dismounted and the timpanist and trumpeters when mounted, all under bandmasters and later Directors of Music (in the Household Cavalry). In these bands, the drum horse timpanist carrying and playing his instrument, which carries the battle honours of his unit at the head of his bandsmen, is the equivalent to the drum major of the infantry and other dismounted bands, corps of drums and pipes and drums. When massed on parades, these bandsmen were fronted by the leading timpanists and the trumpeters, under the baton of a senior conductor. The practice ended practically in the late 1930s as these bands became dismounted to adapt to the mechanization of the Army's cavalry regiments, however, the practice has been retained to this very day in the Band of the Household Cavalry, which maintains the two timpanists at the head of the band when in mounted formation. This also had been the case for the yeomanry regiments of what is now today the Army Reserve, many of them Yeomanry Cavalry, which were also dismounted in the same time as their regular counterparts. In the same way, the mounted fanfare trumpeters sounding trumpet calls for cavalry units on battle and parade were commonplace in the 18th and 19th centuries and into the early decades of the 20th, when they become practically dismounted as the fanfare sections of their bands, a tradition maintained today in both the Band of the Household Cavalry and the Band of the Royal Armoured Corps. The appointment of a Trumpet Major, maintained solely today in the Household Cavalry and was formerly present in all the cavalry regiments (save for the Royal Tank Regiment), is bestowed to a senior ranked NCO whose job is, then as in now, to lead the fanfare trumpeters of his unit, historically in battle and today in ceremonies and parades, give musical instruction to his fellow trumpeters and to impact discipline to them, the band and to the whole of the unit. In 1831, the then 1st Life Guards was granted a set of Russian-produced chromatic fanfare trumpets, which made their debut in Trooping the Colour that year. Then as in today these trumpeters carry in the tabards of their instruments the arms and insignia of their formations, while those of the Household Cavalry carry the royal coat of arms. From 1884 to 1984, the Royal Artillery Mounted Band was the sole band representing the mounted gunners of the Royal Horse Artillery, wearing the mounted variant of the full dress uniforms worn by the Royal Artillery. This band itself was the successor to both the 1797 Royal Horse Artillery Band and the 1857 Royal Artillery Brass Band, which actually began as the corps of drums of the whole of the RA until 1856, when its bandmaster and fife major, James Henry Lawson, transitioned into a bugle major and converted it as the first ever bugle band in the United Kingdom, with drummers and buglers when dismounted and timpani and buglers in mounted formation. Said band, with the addition of brass instruments in the 1860s, became a pioneer mounted brass ensemble within the army proper, and its personnel would form part of the basis of the RAMB in 1884. Until the late 1930s, the RAMB, in mounted formation, played in like manner as in the Army's guards and line cavalry bands. Currently, the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery, aside from a bugler, maintains a natural chromatic fanfare trumpet section active in ceremonial events and the Musical Ride demonstration, a tradition formerly part of the RAMB in the years when it played in mounted formation. Then as in today both the timpanist and the fanfare trumpeters, in full dress uniform, wear the colours of their respective units. In the Household Division, the Band of the Household Cavalry wear the mounted variants of the 1665 State Dress in all royal events. Only the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards timpanist in full dress wears a bearskin while playing his instrument in mounted formation. ===Regimental/service marches=== All military units have officially sanctioned unit marches. Service units with official marches include the Royal Air Force Regiment (\\"Holyrood\\"), the Royal Corps of Signals (\\"Begone Dull Care\\"), and the Royal Marine Commandos (\\"Sarie Marais\\"). There are 2 specific marches maintained in army regiments: one in quick time and one in slow time. The difference is found in that the former is performed during regular marchpast while the latter is performed during particularly ceremonial marches. In rifle regiments and mounted units, there is also such a march as a double past, performed when in double time and/or are riding at an increasing speed. One of the more notable double pasts is The Keel Row. The RN and the RAF are the only services to have service-wide marches, with the army being represented by a pan-regiment march indicative to the branch (e.g. On the Green, Soldiers of the Queen). ==Influence== ===In military bands around the world=== United States The Drum Major of the Marine Band leading it during a ceremony while wearing a bearskin. American military bands are one of the chief users of British military music tradition. The name of the United States Marine Band uses terminology that stems from the British use of designating various military units as either the \\"King's Own\\" or \\"Queen's Own\\". Premier ensembles like the Marine Band as well as the United States Army Band and the United States Air Force Band have drum majors who wear bearskins similar to the Foot Guards and are issued a set of regalia; the latter typically being a service wide tradition unlike the former. It maintains several military pipe bands. Until the 1930s, individual unit drum and bugle corps, as well as corps of drums (all termed as field music in the United States) were in active service in the US Armed Forces, with the tradition being adopted by civil ensembles. Canada All Canadian military bands follow the same precedent set by the British, as well as number of pipe bands (and formerly corps of drums and drum and bugle corps, the latter with additional influences later on from the United States). At the same time, due to its shared history with France (particularly in Quebec), a French aspect to Canadian military bands can also be found. With the 1968 unification of the Canadian Armed Forces, many military bands were reorganized to fit the American format, with the creation of base bands, which follow the traditions of the United States, the UK and France in respect to military music. African military bands African military bands grew out of the Decolonisation of Africa in the 1960s. British influence in these Bands can be found in East and West Africa. Military bands under Ugandan President Idi Amin grew under with his particular approval. During his rule, he ordered the creation of a military band in every major military barracks across the country. The country that follows British band patterns the most are those of the South African National Defence Force, which utilizes the voluntary regimental system alongside the active duty structure. The South African Army Corps of Bandsmen is the South African equivalent of the Corps of Army Music. African military bands more or less coem in the form of brass and reed bands, with few pipe bands being the exceptions. Outside South Africa, whose military has had pipe bands that were strongly associated with the Apartheid regime, countries such as Nigeria and Egypt have made British-style military pipe bands. In the former country, both the Guards Brigade and the Nigerian Air Force own dedicated pipe bands, with the NAF creating its first pipe band as recently as April 2019. The Kenya Army Band and other Kenyan military bands wear a distinctive white and black monkey bearskin based on the pattern set by the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards.https://reuters.screenocean.com/record/910653 Asian military bands The Madras Sappers Military Band during the Delhi Republic Day parade of 2012. Countries such as India, Pakistan and Malaysia have followed the British precedent very closely. Indian military bands, which are organized in British-style regimental and unit formations, are the largest of their kind in the world, with the Indian Armed Forces today having more than 50 military brass bands and 400 pipe bands. Other regions, particularly the Middle East, also have engaged in the use of the British format. Like India, Arab nations such as Jordan, Qatar, and Kuwait have modified the use of pipe bands to fit traditional Arab culture. In India, pipe bands were introduced to ethnically Sikh, Rajput, Gorkha, and Pathan regiments in the late 19th century, as well as in a number of regiments of other races. Pipe bands are also maintained in Asian countries like neighboring Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The drum major for the Central Military Band of the People's Liberation Army of China has also been modified in recent years to utilize British drum major standards and attributes. Caribbean military bands The Band of the West India Regiments, seen here in Jamaica in 1907. Many Caribbean military bands from countries belonging to the Commonwealth of Nations are modelled after their British counterparts. Many of these bands descend from the West India Regiments. The Jamaica Military Band and the Barbados Defence Force Band are two examples of bands with this type of lineage. The latter is commonly known as the Zouave Band due to the history both the bands and their colonial predecessors in implementing Zouave uniforms by orders of Queen Victoria. The Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force Steel Orchestra has modified its British tradition with its sole use of steelpans. ===In civilian marching bands in Britain and abroad=== Traditional British military bands are the basis for many civilian marching bands in the UK and abroad. * Since the late 1960s, the Bethlehem, Pennsylvania-based Liberty High School Grenadier Band uses a musical formation patterned after the Foot Guards bands of the Household Division (but adapted to suit high school marching bands in the United States), with a pipe band modeled after the Pipes and Drums of the Scots Guards, and its bandsmen wearing uniforms similar to those of the Coldstream Guards (including bearskins). Raised in 1926, this band has been present in a number of local, national and international engagements. * The Neuss-based Quirinus Band and Bugle Corps, formed in 2011, is affiliated to the Band and Bugles of The Rifles and its marching pace mirrors that used by the band. Under its current Bandmaster, Peter Hosking, a veteran former musician of the bands of the Royal Green Jackets and affiliated as well to the Royal Green Jackets Association, it wears the uniforms used by the RGJ, which served in West Germany during the Cold War, and its predecessor units, with the red plume over the dark green shako. Being the first German military marching band of its kind, it also honors the German first generation riflemen of the final decades of the 18th and the first decades of the 19th century who served with their English, Scottish and Irish servicemen in the ranks of both the King's Royal Rifle Corps and the Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own). * The London Military Band is a civilian military-styled band composed of professional musicians dressed in uniforms based on those worn by the Bands of the Household Division (especially of the Foot Guards) in the Victorian era. Their uniform reflects that of the Band of the Grenadier Guards in the final decades of the 19th century, with the single gold buttons and gold trim. * The British Imperial Military Band is a concert/marching band composed of ex- military Musicians from all three branches. * The Central Band of the Royal British Legion is a concert band associated with the Royal British Legion. ==See also== *Italian Carabinieri Bands - under the Carabinieri *Italian Bersaglieri Bands - under the Bersaglieri *Russian military bands *Musical Unit of the Spanish Royal Guard *French Republican Guard Band *Police band (music) ==References== Category:British marching bands Category:British ceremonial units ","title":"British military bands"},{"id":"63788895","text":"A Secret Love is an 2020 American documentary film, directed by Chris Bolan.

It was released in early access on Steam on April 12, 2019 and was fully released on April 15, 2020. Mobile ports are expected to be released in 2021 with crossplay capabilities between platforms. == Gameplay == Kards is a turned-based collectible card game. It is played between two players, each with a deck of 40 cards themed around strategies of powers during World War II: Nazi Germany, Great Britain, Soviet Union, the United States, Imperial Japan, France, and Fascist Italy. For example, a German deck relies on Blitzkrieg to overwhelm the opponent with tanks. The objective is to destroy the enemy's headquarters represented by a card on the board. The playing field, called \\"battlefield\\" in-game, is divided into three fronts, the player's support line, front line, and the enemy's support line. The support and front line can hold up to four and five cards respectively, but units must be deployed in the player's support line when played. In order to play cards, players expend a resource called Kredit that refreshes every turn, after which the maximum Kredit increases by one, up to 12. Kredits can also be used to move military units to the front line or to attack enemy units. Once a unit has been moved to the front line, they cannot retreat back unless forced to by certain cards. The front line can only be controlled by one player at a time, as such, whoever controls it has a strategic advantage on the battlefield. === Game modes === Players can compete against a computer AI or against human opponents online based on a tiered- ranking system. Players' rank will reset after each one-month long season. Alternatively, players can play in a draft against other human players where they have to build a deck from scratch by picking one card out of three randomly chosen ones at a time, after which they will use it until they win or lose a certain number of matches, earning rewards based on their performance. There is also five single-player campaigns that players can progress through, each themed around major military campaigns from the war. == Development and release == 1939 Games was founded in 2015 by former CEO √çvar Kristj√°nsson and Project Lead Gudmundur Kristj√°nsson of CCP Games, best known for developing Eve Online, with Kards being their first project. At first, Kards started out as a cardboard prototype and went into full production after receiving a $70,000 grant, making its first public appearance in March 2019. Over the course of its development, Kards received over $5 million in endowments from venture funds, including the Chinese investing company Tencent, to support future updates and a mobile version of the game. Card artwork was sourced and licensed from World War II enlistment posters, propaganda art, and toy box art from the 1970s and 1980s, including box art of Airfix scale model kits famously painted by Roy Cross. The game released on April 15, 2020 on PC with continued post-launch support in the form of expansions, timed-limited events, and hotfixes. Prior to its official release, the game received over 250,000 downloads on Steam with a record peak of over 2,700 concurrent players. == Reception == Kards received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" for PC according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

She was the second child of Maurice and Ada Freeman (n√©e Price). Her father was a Russian immigrant who had a number of businesses on Kevin Street, and her mother volunteered with the local Jewish school at the Adelaide Road Synagogue, training young Jewish children in their religion. Like many other Jewish children, Feldman attended the Protestant Wesley College, as Protestant schools were more accommodating of the needs of observant Jews. Feldman was appointed the first day-girl prefect at age 14, when she complained that day girls were unsupervised at lunchtime. She was awarded a bursary to Trinity College Dublin based on her Leaving Certificate results, but instead she entered the civil service upon leaving school in 1934. She first worked Department of Finance, and after the declaration of the Emergency, in the Department of Defence. It was noted that her arrival and departure from Dublin Castle on her bicycle often drew a crowd of people supposedly unaccustomed to seeing a Jewish person. She married Jacob 'Jack' Feldman (died 1985) on 31 March 1941. He was a commercial traveller and later a shop owner. Owing to the marriage bar, Feldman had to resign from her civil service job. The couple had two sons and one daughter, Maurice, Alec, and Estelle. ==Stratford College== When the Feldman's children were old enough for secondary school, both of them were unhappy at the limited choices available to Jewish children, especially as there was a lack of space in Protestant schools. They also feared that a secular education would leave their children without a full appreciation of their heritage as orthodox observant Jews. In 1952, Feldman was among the five people at a meeting in Chief Rabbi Immanuel Jakobvits's house, a meeting that would lead eventually to the foundation of the first Jewish secondary school in Ireland, Stratford College, Rathgar. In September 1952 the school opened on Terenure Road East with a small group of children from the Jewish national school in Bloomfield Avenue. Feldman served on the board of governors as honorary secretary for 17 years, managing all aspects of the school's running as well as lobbying civil servants and politicians for support. As the school grew, Feldman oversaw the purchase of a larger building, 1 Zion Road, in 1954, agreeing to pay ¬£4,250 before a financial arrangement was in place. Panicked by the situation, she consulted with the manager of the Northern Bank, who concurred with her decision and loaned the additional money to equip the school on sureties of Jack Feldman and another four Jewish businessmen. Alongside Jewish children, those of other faiths also attended the school. Feldman found support for a large number of scholarships for Jewish children whose parents could not afford tuition. The scholarships also covered the cost of the uniforms and books. The school established an award in honour of Feldman, awarded to students for literary merit. She collaborated with Dr Dermot Ryan to have Hebrew added to the subjects recognised at the Leaving Certificate. From about 1970, Feldman lectured on Jewish doctrines and beliefs to Christian audiences at the Adelaide Road Synagogue, with Jewish community leaders and British rabbis also attending at times. She was nominated to become a founding member of the Irish Council of Christians and Jews by the Chief Rabbi David Rosen. She also gave talks to Dublin schoolchildren on inter-faith understanding. She volunteered at the headquarters of the Irish Girl Guides for many years, serving as controller of the guide shop, overseeing its development into a large and efficient business. For a time she was district commissioner, and continued to be active in guiding after her official retirement, being one of the oldest women involved in the Girl Guides anywhere in the world. Feldman suffered from lifelong chronic illness, but was an active golfer and was life lady president of the Jewish golf club at Edmondstown. Feldman died on 19 October 2006 at her home in Neville Avenue, Rathgar. ==References== Category:1916 births Category:2006 deaths Category:People from Dublin (city) Category:Irish Jews Category:Irish people of Russian-Jewish descent ","title":"Elaine Feldman"},{"id":"63789211","text":"Lake Rotopokaka is a dune lake in the Far North District of New Zealand.

The trailhead is located on Lighthouse Point, at the Louisbourg Lighthouse, within the Fortress of Louisbourg National Historic Site. The Louisbourg Lighthouse is the site of Canada‚Äôs first lighthouse which was built here in 1734. ==Trail history== People have been traversing this coastline for decades so a narrow but well-worn foot path was present along this shore connecting Lighthouse Point to the community of Big Lorraine. A local non-profit society, the Coastal Connections Trail Association, began work on improving the trail around 2008. With the first section completed they held an opening ceremony in June 2010. The volunteer association continues to maintain the trail. ==Trail outline== ===Loop Trail=== The first part of the trail is suitable for visitors of all skill levels. It begins at the parking area at Lighthouse Point and follows the ocean coast to the east as a hard-packed gravel partial loop trail. Along this part of the trail are a number of interpretive panels explaining the area's historical significance and natural features including its geography, flora and fauna. There are benches to rest along the trail, as well as lookoffs in strategic places. Sections of the trail, where it passes over a fen and other wet ground are constructed as an elevated wooden boardwalk. The trail is accessible to power wheelchairs and children in strollers and wide enough for two to walk abreast. Pets are permitted on the trail but must be leashed and managed by their owners. There are a number of small side paths branching off along this part of the trail, such as the one that gives access to the top of Lighthouse Cliff for an expansive view. The trail follows the coast past Lighthouse Cove, Crows Roost, Morningstar Cove and continues to Western Gun Landing Cove Head where it loops back around toward the start. ===Coastal Trail=== Beyond the loop is a more challenging trail that continues east along Gun Landing Cove beach where British besiegers of Fortress Louisbourg landed artillery. Along the edge of the shore here are the remains of French entrenchments from 1758. This rugged section of the trail is narrower and has natural surfaces; it is wet in places, sturdy footwear is recommended. Parts of this section of the trail also have smaller sections of boardwalk or bridges to pass over some of the wet areas. The trail then continues into the woods past Eastern Gun Landing Cove Head to Brook Landing Cove (also known as Wolf's Cove) where General James Wolfe's forces set up camp along the Freshwater Brook running down to the cove, as a base for the attack on the fortress's Island Battery. From here the trail rounds Big Cove, then progresses further east past Hammer Head Cove and Hammer Head, and Moneyhunters Cove, to a lookoff at Lorraine Head. Past the lookoff a very rugged informal trail continues a further east to the coastal village of Big Lorraine. This section is recommended for avid hikers. Morningstar Cove.

During a mutiny on the ship, Acting Lieutenant Fletcher Christian seized command of the ship from Bligh on 28 April 1789. Churchill was an active member of the mutiny, being a member of Fletcher Christian's loyalists that arrested Bligh in his cabin. == Early life and navy career == Churchill was born in Manchester in 1759. Little else is recorded of his early life. Between August and the October of 1787, Bounty‚Äôs crew was being assigned for the voyage to Tahiti. On 7 September 1787, Churchill signed on as the ships corporal, a task including the assistance of maintaining the order amongst the crew. == Desertion during Bounty expedition == On 5 January 1789 while at Tahiti and three months before departure, three crew members, Charles Churchill, along with the gunner‚Äôs mate John Millward and seaman William Muspratt deserted ship, taking the ships cutter, muskets and ammunition. Muspratt had recently been flogged for neglect of duty. Bligh records the incident in the ships log: \\"at the relief of the watch at four o'clock this morning the small cutter was missing. I was immediately informed of it and mustered the ship's company, when it appeared that three men were absent: Charles Churchill, the ship's corporal and two of the seamen, William Muspratt and John Millward, the latter of whom had been sentinel from twelve to two in the morning. They had taken with them eight stands of arms and ammunition; but what their plan was, or which way they had gone, no one on board seemed to have the least knowledge.\\" Among belongings Churchill left on the Bounty included a list of names that Bligh construed as more accomplices in a planned desertion. Bligh later asserted that the names included those of midshipman Peter Heywood and Fletcher Christian. Churchill, Millward and Muspratt were eventually found after three weeks of hiding and, on their return to the ship, were flogged in two sessions with Churchill receiving a dozen lashes but the others, two dozen each. Churchill and his fellow deserters composed a letter hoping to appease Bligh on return to England and avoid possible fatal consequences on the result of a court martial. \\"Sir. We should think ourselves wholly inexcusable if we omitted taking this earliest opportunity of returning our thanks for your goodness in delivering us from a trial by court martial, the fatal consequences of which are obvious; and although we cannot possibly lay any claim to so great a favour, yet we humbly beg you will be pleased to remit any farther punishment; and we trust our future conduct will fully demonstrate our deep sense of your clemency, and our steadfast resolution to behave better hereafter. We are, Your most obedient, most humble servants,\\" C. Churchill. Wm. Muspratt, John Millward. (Bligh refers to this letter in his reply to Edward Christians defence of his brother Fletcher) == During the mutiny and Bligh's description == Churchill was one of Fletcher Christians loyalists that entered Bligh's cabin under arms and forced him on deck on the morning of the mutiny, 28th April 1789. Bligh describes Churchill in his notebook while cast in Bounty's launch: [CHARLES CHURCHILL] Ship‚Äôs Corporal, 30 years, 5 feet 10 inches high. Fair complexion, short light-brown hair. Bald headed, strong made. The forefinger on his left hand crooked, and the hands shows the mark of severe scald. Tattooed in several parts of the body. == On Tahiti and fate == When Christian sailed the Bounty to Tahiti for the final time before heading to Pitcairn, Churchill along with 15 other crew members, voted to stay. He had an ally, Vehiatua who was a minor chief of Taiarapu, a part of south east Tahiti, brother in law of the of the Tahitian King Otoo. Churchill actively participated in the ongoing conflicts between the island districts and with his experience as a Royal Marine and with weapons acquired from the Bounty, he contributed in changing the relatively non-lethal nature of the conflicts between chiefdoms into bloody slaughter. The rest of Bounty‚Äôs crew on Tahiti began to organise their lives. Some attempted to build a schooner hoping to sail to the Dutch East Indies to surrender, others settled into Tahitian life and customs. Churchill and fellow crony Matthew Thompson, on the other hand, chose to lead drunken and generally dissolute lives, which ended in the violent deaths of both. Churchill was murdered by Thompson in a quarrel over a stolen musket. Thompson was then in turn killed by Churchill's native friend, a man named Patiri. == Appearances in film == Churchill has been portrayed in film by the following actors: Pat Flaherty in Mutiny on the Bounty (1935) Liam Neeson in The Bounty (1984) == References == == External links == Pitcairn island study center Project Gutenberg Fateful Voyage Category:Crew of HMS Bounty Category:HMS Bounty mutineers Category:Mutiny on the Bounty ","title":"Charles Churchill (mutineer)"},{"id":"63789525","text":" The SS Frankfurt was a German steamship originally operated by Norddeutscher Lloyd. First launched on 17 December 1899, Frankfurt took frequent passages between Germany and the United States from 1900 to 1918. Many of its passengers were migrants. In 1919, Frankfurt was acquired by the White Star Line after it was surrendered to the United Kingdom in World War I. In 1922, Frankfurt was then sold to the Oriental Navigation Company in Hong Kong, where it was renamed Sarvistan, before its eventually being scrapped in Japan in 1931. In 1912, it was one of the first ships to respond to the distress signals from . ==History== The Frankfurt was built by Joh. C. Tecklenborg in Geestemunde (present-day Bremerhaven, Germany), and the second of its namesake to be launched for Norddeutscher Lloyd on 17 December 1899. Most of the ship's activity prior to the First World War was transporting mainly German and Austrian migrants to the United States. On 31 March 1900, its maiden voyage started from Bremen to Baltimore. On 25 December 1901, Frankfurt took the first trip to Galveston, Texas, after which it took frequent trips from Bremen to either Baltimore, Galveston, or both. In 1908, it sailed to South America. Then, starting in 1910, it started the first of many voyages from Bremen to Philadelphia to Galveston. In 1914, it took voyages from Bremen, to Boston, and then to New Orleans. At the conclusion of the First World War, Frankfurt was surrendered to the United Kingdom and was acquired by the White Star Line in 1919. In 1922, the ship was sold to the Oriental Navigation Company in British Hong Kong and renamed Sarvistan. In 1931, it was scrapped in Japan. ==Sinking of the RMS Titanic== At 12:18 AM on 15 April 1912, while eastbound from Galveston to Bremerhaven, Frankfurt was the first vessel to respond to distress signals from the . Under the orders of Captain Edward John Smith, Titanic's wireless operator, Jack Phillips, tried to reach out to Frankfurt to acknowledge his position. However, Frankfurt's operator, W. Zippel, had not heard the first distress call and was instead making routine calls for the night. Sixteen minutes after Phillips sent Titanic's second position report to Frankfurt, they responded, saying, \\"What's up, old man?\\" Phillips, frustrated that the Frankfurt had seemed not to have known the situation the whole time after receiving Titanic's first distress call, says back to them, \\"You fool! You stand by and keep out!\\" George Behe of the Titanic Historical Society pointed out that Zippel, at the time of Phillips' outrage, was well aware of the seriousness of Titanic's situation. At 1:35 AM, Titanic's wireless transmitter lost power, hence debilitating her communication with Frankfurt and many other ships responding to her distress calls. As Frankfurt was no longer receiving calls from Titanic, Zippel tried to regain contact with her with the message that had unintentionally angered Phillips. Regardless, once the Titanic's situation was realized, according to √úberall (a German magazine), the Frankfurt's captain, Hattorff, steered toward the Titanic's position at full speed. He ordered the ship's galley to bake bread and the crew to provide blankets for the passengers they would rescue. At 1:28 AM, they confirmed that they are coming. Captain Hattorff estimated that by the given coordinates, he could make it to the site by 2:00 AM or earlier. Even though Hattorff did not know the actual scope of the situation, he assumed it to be the worst with the limited details he had. It was later revealed, however, that Phillips miscalculated Titanic's coordinates, and, at 1:47 AM, the Frankfurt expressed confusion. Ultimately, Frankfurt had not been able to come to Titanic's assistance despite being only 20 miles away and the closest ship to respond to the British liner. The Frankfurt was the first to notify the , the closest ship to the Titanic, that it had sank overnight. ==Annotations== ==References== Category:1899 ships Category:Steamships of Germany Category:RMS Titanic Category:Maritime incidents in 1912 Category:Steamships of the United Kingdom Category:Ships of the White Star Line ","title":"SS Frankfurt"},{"id":"63789526","text":"Snehlata Nath (born 27 December 1965) is an Indian activist known for her work with the Nilgiris.

The street is located north of the city's main railway station Dortmund Hauptbahnhof in the Stadtbezirk Innenstadt-Nord district. There have been brothels on Linienstra√üe since the beginning of the 20th century. Under the \\"Sperrbezirk\\" regulations, prostitution in central Dortmund is only permitted in Linienstra√üe. The street is about 200 meters long and has a privacy screen across the entrance. A sign at the north entrance to the street, referring to a defunct law from 1957, states access is only for adults. In the Linienstra√üe there is window prostitution, with services and prices usually being negotiated at the window before the client enters. ==History== According to the city archives, there was street prostitution on Marschallstra√üe in 1898. By 1904, the street name had changed to Linienstra√üe and there were brothels on the street. The Dortmund Midnight Mission (Dortmunder Mitternachtsmission) was founded in 1918 to administer to the needs of the prostitutes. Irish poet and author Samuel Beckett's poem Dortmunder, published in 1935 in Echo's Bones and Other Precipitates, tells of Beckett drinking in Dortmund and ending up in Linienstra√üe. ==Modern times== In 2010, one of the brothels was sold at auction for 1.1 million euros, another brothel was offered for sale in 2018. A large anti-sex trafficking poster was erected on the end wall on the house on the corner of Linienstra√üe and Steinstra√üe in 2017. The poster was erected in collaboration with the Midnight Mission and financed by the 16 houses and 200 women of Linienstra√üe. Artist Bettina Br√∂kelschen spent two years painting Linienstra√üe and the women working there. Her works were the subject of an exhibition, People in Linienstra√üe, in 2019. Prostitution in Linienstra√üe was temporarily suspended in mid-March 2020 as part of the preventative measures introduced during the coronavirus pandemic. ==Dortmund model== At the instigation of the Midnight Mission a series of \\"round table\\" discussions about prostitution in the city took place, starting in 2002. Initially the attendees were the Midnight Mission, Dortmund Police and involved council departments, soon Linienstra√üe's brothel operators became involved to agree common goals. From these discussions the \\"Dortmund model\\" was evolved. The aims were to combat forced prostitution, human trafficking and underage prostitution. The model is to a degree self-regulating; the brothel operators and existing prostitutes ensure that new women working in Linienstra√üe are over 18, have necessary documentation and are not under the control of a pimp. The model was approved by the City Council and forms part of the city's strategy on prostitution. Other cities in North Rhine-Westphalia have looked at the model and some have adopted its basic principles. In a 2007, the German Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth's Report by the Federal Government on the Impact of the Act Regulating the Legal Situation of Prostitutes (Prostitution Act) noted the positive feedback that Dortmund Police had given the \\"Dortmund model\\". ==See also== * Prostitution in Germany ==References== Category:Dortmund Category:Streets in Germany Category:Red-light districts in Germany ","title":"Linienstra√üe (Dortmund)"},{"id":"63789591","text":"Cathedral of Our Lady of Assumption (), is an Eastern Catholic (Syriac) church in Aleppo, Syria, located in the Christian quarter of al-Jdayde.

The phenomenon is generally caused by disappointment due to differences between what a person expects their voice to sound like to other people and what they actually hear in recordings. These differences arise both in audio quality, including factors such as audio frequency, and in extra-linguistic cues about their personality. ==Causes== The auditory perception of a person's own voice is different when the person hears their own voice live and through recordings. Upon hearing a recording of their own voice, a person may experience disappointment due to cognitive dissonance between their perception and expectation for the sound of their voice. The differences arise from differences in audio frequency and quality as well as extra-linguistic cues about personality. ===Audio differences=== The perception of hearing in humans is performed by the auditory system receiving mechanical sound waves in the eardrum. When the source of sound is another person, the sound waves are only received through the air (an external stimulus). However, when the source of sound is the observer's own vocal cords, sound waves also travel through the person's body to their ears (an internal stimulus). Laryngologist Martin Birchall described hearing one's own voice while talking as \\"hearing it through a cave complex inside our own heads\\" due to the sound traveling through sinuses and various parts of the cranial cavity. As a result, a combination of internal and external stimuli has a different sound quality and different frequencies than external stimuli alone. However, audio quality differences are not the sole factors in voice confrontation, as participants of a 2013 study gave significantly higher ratings to their voice when they did not recognise it as their own. ===Extra-linguistic cues=== In 1966, Philip Holzman and Clyde Rousey concluded from their studies that voice confrontation also arises from differences in \\"extra-linguistic cues\\" that reveal aspects of personality which are only perceivable through recordings, such as anxiety levels, indecision, sadness, and anger. People are accustomed to the sound of their voice from the combination of internal and external stimuli, so people \\"build our self-image and vocal self image around what we hear, rather than the reality\\" according to Birchall. In a 1967 study, only 38% of people were able to identify recordings of their own voice within 5 seconds. The disappointment from extra-linguistic cues can be especially problematic for people with body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria since they may perceive their voice as sounding like someone of the opposite gender. ==In specific populations== In 1967, Holzman, Andrew Berger, and Rousey published a follow- up study on voice confrontation in bilingual people who had learned a second language after age 16. The study showed that the bilingual subjects experienced greater discomfort when hearing their own recorded voices in their first language. Another study in 1970 found that people with speech disorders experienced greater voice confrontation than those without such issues. The results of the same study also found that females show a \\"significantly greater semantic differential reaction to hearing their own voices\\". ==See also== *Self-confrontation method ==References* * * Category:Human voice Category:Perception Category:Sound recording ","title":"Voice confrontation"},{"id":"63789669","text":"Charles Latham's 1904 photograph of the Garden Court at Goddards, a house in Surrey designed by Lutyens with gardens by Gertrude Jekyll Charles Latham (15 May 1847 ‚Äì 27 October 1912) was staff photographer of the magazine Country Life in the early years of the 20th century. He is noted for his photographs of country houses and gardens, mostly in Britain and Italy. ==Life and work== Charles Latham was born on 15 May 1847 in Manchester, the son of an engraver. Nothing is known about his early life, how he learnt his craft as a photographer, or the start of his career. By 1874 he was based in London. The earliest known photograph by Latham was of the Three Nuns Inn on Aldgate High Street, taken for the antiquarian Philip Norman. Norman was documenting London buildings that were about to be demolished, using both his own drawings and paintings, and photographs. Latham worked for publishers such as Ernst Wasmuth and Batsford, specializing in architecture and outdoor topics. For Wasmuth he provided phographs for an overview of British and Irish architecture published in 1890. His first work for Batsford was with the architect John Alfred Gotch on his book Architecture of the Renaissance in England. He then worked on George Birch's book on London churches of the 17th and 18th centuries, which has been described as \\"the handsomest piece of preservation propaganda ever printed\\". It contains 64 of Latham's photographs. He provided the photographs for two other Batsford books: Belcher and Macartney's two volume set of Renaissance English architectureVolume 1; Volume 2 and H. Inigo Triggs's book on formal gardens in England and Scotland. Latham became staff photographer of the magazine Country Life shortly after it was founded in 1897 by Edward Hudson. The format of the magazine was made possible by technical advances in printing that allowed high quality photographic images and text to be printed on the same page. The magazine featured golf and racing news, advertisements for country homes, and articles about aspects of country life including houses and gardens. Many of the photographs accompanying these articles were by Latham, and the topics included both old established houses such as Coleshill, in Berkshire (a seventeenth century house, now lost), as well as newly built ones, such as Goddards in Surrey, designed by Edwin Lutyens, with gardens by Gertrude Jekyll. Latham did not only work in Britain. In 1903 he travelled to Italy to photograph gardens there, taking with him a large format camera and many glass-plate negatives. Three books were published by Country Life between 1900 and 1905 featuring his work: Gardens Old and New, Volume 1; Volume 2; Volume 3. In English Homes, and The Gardens of Italy. Volume 1; Volume 2. A recent publication reproduces many of Latham's Italian images. Latham's reputation was firmly established by the time he started working for Country Life. Gotch said of him, \\"The art of fitly illustrating architecture has not been widely acquired and we hold ourselves fortunate in having secured the services of Latham.\\" A review of In English Homes in The New York Times described him as\\"perhaps the best-known photographic interpreter of English architecture\\". His style was of necessity often formal, as he worked within constraints defined by his authors and publishers. But as Kristina Taylor has noted, he often included people and props into his compositions, particularly in the Country Life work where he had more freedom. For his interiors he often removed much of the furniture and ornaments from a room, ensuring clarity and emphasizing the original architecture. There are few personal reminiscences of Latham.

At the LANL, Del Valle leads the Fusion Team, where she combines internet data with satellite imagery to forecast disease outbreaks. During the COVID-19 pandemic Del Valle created a computational model that could predict the spread of coronavirus around the United States. == Education == Del Valle attended the New Jersey Institute of Technology, where she studied applied mathematics. Here she was awarded the Excellence in Mathematics Award in 1996. She earned her bachelor's degree in 2001. For her graduate studies she moved to the University of Iowa, where she developed mathematical models to describe outbreaks of smallpox. She showed that the spread of smallpox is particularly sensitive to how rapidly people self-isolate. She developed a differential equation that could describe the spread, which revealed that the epidemic size depended on how quickly the population developed immunity. After completing her doctorate in 2005, Del Valle joined the LANL as a postdoctoral researcher. Her early worked involved modelling the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Toronto, and accurately predicted the peak and number of people who would be infected. == Research and career == Del Valle was appointed a permanent staff member at LANL after completing her postdoctoral research. Her research involves the development of mathematical and computational models to mitigate the spread of viruses. She has shown that it is possible to use social media to predict epidemics, which includes searching social media platforms for terms such as vaccine or mask as well as capturing public sentiment. These findings are used by Del Valle in predictive agent-based models. Alongside the computational models, Del Valle has developed algorithms that can quantify their uncertainty. She was appointed lead of the pandemic project at the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center. In 2012 Del Valle studied the economic benefits of wearing face masks during the 2009 swine flu pandemic. She predicted that an unmitigated pandemic could cause over $800 billion of damage to the United States economy. Her estimate made use of earnings, costs associated with staying in hospital and loses in income due to illness. Del Valle demonstrated that if face masks were used by half of the population, economic losses of up to $573 billion could be avoided. Del Valle studied the ways that Wikipedia can be used to monitor for disease outbreaks. Making use of the Western African Ebola virus epidemic as a model, Del Valle showed that Wikipedia had the potential to be an effective, community driven monitoring system to identify emerging diseases as well as storing and sharing data. She used natural language processing to capture critical information and case counts from Wikipedia articles. Del Valle believes that the history sections of Wikipedia pages do not only serve to gauge public interest, but also provide chronological information on disease incidence. Del Valle has combined internet data from Wikipedia and social media with satellite imagery and climate information to improve disease forecasting. For mosquito-borne diseases, satellite data can provide information on vegetation and surface water. In 2019, Del Valle and co-workers won a Centers for Disease Control competition to improve flu forecasting software. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Del Valle worked on a computational model to describe the spread of coronavirus disease around the United States. As there is no historical data for SARS-CoV-2, the computational models developed by Del Valle were very different to those she had previously used understand the spread of influenza. Her models were used to inform states on social distancing guidelines and quarantine restrictions. Her models, which were released in late April 2020, made use of data from the Johns Hopkins University platform developed by Lauren Gardner. Del Valle has recommended that the public wear face masks. By locking down early, New Mexico, the state that is home to the LANL, avoided a steep SARS-CoV-2 death toll. Del Valle has called for a global centre to be established that can monitor information about the spread of coronavirus disease. == Selected works and publications == ===Selected works=== * * * ===Selected publications=== * * == References == ==External links== * Sara Y.

It was created by seven stakeholder companies as part of a global partnership. The security scheme was created by Arm Holdings, Brightsight, CAICT, Prove & Run, Riscure, TrustCB and UL. Arm Holdings first brought forward the Platform Security Architecture (PSA) specifications in 2017 to outline common standards for IoT security, with PSA Certified assurance scheme launching two years later in 2019. ==History== In 2017, Arm Holdings created Platform Security Architecture (PSA), a standard for IoT security. The standard builds trust between Internet of Things services and devices. It was built to include an array of specifications such as threat models, security analyses, hardware and firmware architecture specifications, and an open-source firmware reference implementation. It aimed to become an industry-wide security component, with built-in security functions for both software and device manufacturers. PSA has since evolved to become PSA Certified, a four-stage framework which can be used by IoT designers for security practices. The framework included different levels of trust, with each level contains a different level of assessment, with progressively increasing security assurances. In 2018, the first IoT threat models and PSA documents were published. The certification of PSA Certified launched at Embedded World in 2019, where Level 1 Certification was presented to chip vendors. A draft of Level 2 protection was presented at the same time. Six of the seven founding stakeholders created the PSA Certified specifications, which are now make up the PSA Joint Stakeholders Agreement. The stakeholders are Arm Holdings, Brightsight, CAICT, Prove & Run, Riscure and UL. TrustCB became the seventh PSA Certified JSA member, acting as an independent Certification Body for the scheme. Out of the six other founding members, four are security test laboratories, which includes Brightsight, CAICT, Riscure and UL. The first PSA Certified Level 2 certificates were issued to chip vendors in February 2020. ==Certification== The PSA Joint Stakeholders Agreement outlines how members can create a worldwide standard for IoT security that enables the electronic industry to have an easy to understand security scheme. The security certification scheme documents enable a security-by-design approach to a diverse set of IoT products. The scheme starts with a security assessment of the chip and its Root of Trust (RoT) and then builds outwards to the system software and device application code. PSA Certified specifications are implementation and architecture agnostic so can be applied to any chip, software or device. PSA Certified aims to removes industry fragmentation for IoT product manufacturers and developers in a number of ways. The world's leading IoT chip vendors are delivering system-on- chips built with a PSA Root of Trust (PSA-RoT) providing a new widely available security component with built-in security functions that software platforms and original device manufacturers (OEMs) can make use of. A high- level set of APIs are provided to the PSA-RoT abstracting the complex trusted hardware and firmware used by different chip vendors. Free API Test Suites are available to provide this software API compliance to achieve PSA Functional API Certification. ===Level 1=== The first level of certification for PSA Certified is Level 1, aimed at chip vendors, software platforms and device manufacturers. The certification consists of questions, document review and an interview by one of the certification labs. The completed answers are accompanied with explanatory notes, checked by the certification lab. According to the PSA Certified website, language and mappings align with other important IoT requirements, such as standards and laws. These include NISTIR 8259, ETSI 303 645 and SB-327. ===Level 2=== The mid-level security involves testing by a security lab, focusing on source code review and the PSA-root of trust (PSA-RoT), over the course of a month to attain the level 2 certification. This process focuses on carefully defined attack methods and utilizes a set evaluation methodology. It also ensures hardware must support PSA-RoT functions and is therefore aimed at chip vendors. According to Forbes, they believed Level 2 was likely to become the most common level for consumer IoT applications. ===Level 3=== As part of the third stage of PSA Certified, threat models and security analyses documents are provided for a set of IoT devices. These English Language Protection Profiles differ from the threat models, and derive security requirements that are generalised by the PSA Certified 10 Security Goals. ==Industry adoption== Since the launch of the standard, it has been adopted by a number of chip manufacturers. They have included Cypress Semiconductor, Winbond, Unisoc, STMicroelectronics, Microchip Technology, NXP Semiconductor, Renesas Electronics, Nordic Semiconductor, Nuvoton, and Silicon Labs. Software platform adoption has included RT-Thread, Zephyr OS. and Express Logic. ==References== Category:Internet of things companies Category:Internet security ","title":"PSA Certified"},{"id":"63789770","text":"Kalki is a 2017 Tamil-language short film starring Kishore and Yasmin Ponnappa in the lead roles.

He was a member of the , who are native to the present-day North Morowali Regency in Sulawesi. His parents, Hendrik Tumimomor Kamesi and Maligene Damantora Lande, were teachers. Tumimomor was a descendant of Mokole Ede Kamesi, known by the royal title Datu Ri Tana VIII (King Mori), who ruled the small in central Sulawesi from 1907 until 1928. Tumimomor attended elementary school in village and high school in Poso. He then completed a degree in civil engineering from (UKIP) in Makassar. He also obtained his master's degree in civil engineering from Paulus Christian University as well. ===Career=== Tumimomor owned several businesses, including hotels in Kendari, plantations in Mamuju Regency, and a construction company. He also became a lecturer at his alma mater, Paulus Christian University of Indonesia (UKIP). In February 2016, Aptripel Tumimomor was elected Regent of North Morowali in the regional election, while his running mate, Asrar Abdul Samad, a former Deputy Speaker of the North Morowali People's Representative Council from 2004 to 2009, was elected Vice Regent of North Morowali. Tumimomor and Samad won the election with 1,949 votes, or 25.13%, and defeated four other candidates. Regent Tumimomor and Vice Regent Samad were sworn into office on February 17, 2016, by Central Sulawesi Governor Longki Djanggola. In March 2020, Tumimomor supported a proposal by the Mori tribe to have King Mori Mokole Marunduh named a National Hero of Indonesia. Before his illness, Aptripel Tumimomor planned to seek re-election for a second term as North Morowali regent in 2020. Tumimomor became ill in late March 2020. He was initially treated at Kolonadale General Hospital in North Morowali before being transferred to Makassar on April 1, 2020, as his health continued to deteriorate. The next day, Aptripel Tumimomor died at Dr. Wahidin Sudirohusodo General Hospital in Makassar on April 2, 2020, at the age of 53. A rapid test for coronavirus conducted in Kolonadale initially came back as negative. However, a second nasopharyngeal swab test given in the Makassar hospital later confirmed that Tumimomor was positive for COVID-19, but those results were not confirmed until April 4, two days after his death. He was survived by his wife, HO Liliana, and their three children - Andhyka Haryanto, Arlyn Stevani, and Arfan Irvanoff. Aptripel Tumimomor was buried at a cemetery for civil servants in Gowa Regency, South Sulawesi.

A veteran of World War I, Filatov rose to brigade command during the Russian Civil War and was decorated for his actions. He held division command in the 1920s and 1930s between military education and served as a corps commander and deputy commander of an army and a front in the late 1930s. Shortly before the beginning of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, he became commander of the 13th Army in Belarus, which suffered heavy losses in the opening weeks of the war. He was mortally wounded in an air raid on 8 July and died a week later. == Early life, World War I, and Russian Civil War == Born on 18 August 1893 in Rzhev to Russian parents considered bourgeois, Filatov served in the Imperial Russian Army from 1914. He fought in World War I on the Western Front as a ryadovoy, then was promoted to junior unter- ofitser. After graduating from the Dusheti School of Ensigns as a praporshchik, Filatov served as an assistant course commander, junior officer, and company commander. He ended his service in the Imperial Army as a podporuchik. After joining the Red Army in 1918 during the Russian Civil War, Filatov fought against Polish troops on the Western Front and against anti- Soviet forces in Belarus as a platoon commander, an officer for drill parts of a rifle regiment, as assistant commander of the 145th Rifle Regiment of the 17th Rifle Division. He became commander of the 147th Rifle Regiment of the division and from July 1920 commanded the division's 51st Rifle Brigade, distinguishing himself in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. In recognition of his performance, Filatov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner twice, in 1920 and 1921. == Interwar period == In 1922, Filatov graduated from Higher Academic Courses at the Red Army Military Academy. He served as commander of the 50th Rifle Regiment, assistant commander, acting commander, and again as assistant commander of the 17th Rifle Division during this period. After taking command of the 26th Rifle Division in November 1925, Filatov became chief of the Vladivostok Infantry School in February 1927, then studied at the special faculty of the Frunze Military Academy. He graduated from Higher Commanders' Improvement Courses at the academy in 1928 and from the academy itself in 1936. Filatov became a member of the Communist Party in 1930. Made a kombrig when the Red Army introduced personal military ranks in 1935, he commanded the 27th Rifle Division of the Belorussian Military District between 1936 and 1937. Advancing to command of the 15th Rifle Corps of the Kiev Military District in June 1937, he was promoted to komdiv on 17 February 1938 and to komkor on 14 June 1938. Transferred to the Far East during June 1938 to serve as deputy commander of the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army (OKDVA), Filatov continued in that position for the 1st Separate Red Banner Army when the OKDVA was split in September of that year. He received the Order of the Red Star during the year for successful management of combat training, and became a lieutenant general when the Red Army introduced general officer ranks on 4 June 1940. After another reorganization, he became deputy commander of the forces of the new Far Eastern Front in June 1940. A few weeks before the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, on 26 May 1941, Filatov was appointed commander of the new 13th Army of the Western Special Military District in Belarus, then a headquarters without assigned troops. == World War II == After Operation Barbarossa began on 22 June, the army was assigned troops. Filatov led the army in the Battle of Bia≈Çystok‚ÄìMinsk as it suffered heavy losses attempting to halt the German advance. After the encirclement of Minsk, Filatov led the army east to defend the line of Borisov, Smolevichi, and the Ptich. He was severely wounded in a German air raid on 8 July in the area of Mogilev. Evacuated to Moscow, he died of his wounds on 14 July and was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery. He was posthumously awarded the Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class, together with other generals killed in 1941 in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the end of the war in 1965. == Awards and honors == Filatov received the following awards and decorations: * Order of the Red Banner (1920, 1921) * Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class (1965) * Order of the Red Star (1938) * Jubilee Medal \\"XX Years of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army\\" (1938) == References == === Citations === === Bibliography === * * * Category:1893 births Category:1941 deaths Category:People from Rzhev Category:People from Tver Governorate Category:Soviet lieutenant generals Category:Russian military personnel of World War I Category:Soviet military personnel of the Russian Civil War Category:People of the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War Category:Soviet military personnel killed in World War II Category:Recipients of the Order of the Red Banner Category:Recipients of the Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class Category:Frunze Military Academy alumni Category:Burials at Novodevichy Cemetery Category:Communist Party of the Soviet Union members ","title":"Pyotr Filatov"},{"id":"63789963","text":"Waang is an Australian species of sandalwood tree.

Born Khema√Øs Ben Ali Ben Khema√Øs Tarnane. Tarnane is one of the founders and teachers of the Rachidia. == Biography == Khema√Øs Ben Ali Ben Khema√Øs Tarnane, later known as Tarnane or Khema√Øs Tarnane, was born in Juli 1 1894 in Bizerte. Khema√Øs comes from a family of Andalusian origin who immigrated to Tunisia towards the end of the 17th century. His father Ali and his uncle Mohammed, both singers, soon passed on their musical culture to him. His uncle Ahmed takes him with him to the zaouia of Sidi Abdelkader to attend the religious songs of the troops of the brotherhood. These same troops also sing the Tunisian Ma'luf. He contributed within The Rachidia to the collection, development and dissemination of Ma'luf. His numerous compositions in different forms constitute a reference in terms of creation, through the originality of his style combining tradition and modernity. His works have greatly contributed to enriching the Tunisian musical repertoire to which he has printed a distinctive stamp, the traces of which are often cited by ethnomusicologists. He continued his education in a school directed by the writer Abderrahman Guiga who objected to his disciple indulging in any form of musical expression or song. He sees this field as being conducive to the neglect of studies and good customs. In 1903, Tarnane entered the Franco-Arab school and became interested in a kind of flute that was called \\"ghal\\" at the time. After leaving school, he returned to his father's weaver's workshop, where he learned to weave, and frequented cafes that broadcast discs of great Egyptian singers all day long. By listening to them, he learned a considerable number of classical songs and soon formed an orchestra composed of Tunisian Jewish musicians where he played the oud. He quickly acquired a solid reputation so that in 1915 he decided to go to Tunis to try his luck in the musical field: he gave a concert every night in a caf√© in the medina. In 1917, he settled in Tunis and learned Malouf, mouachah√¢t and near-oriental adouars as well as Turkish pesherevs from the greatest masters of the time such as Cheikh Ahmed Touil and Cheikh Ahmed Ferjani. He then formed a new orchestra with Ahmed Karoui. In this period, Tunisian music was enriched with the arrival in Tunis of a group of Jewish artists from Tripoli, including Cheikh El Afrit, who fled Italian colonialism . Tarnane recorded during this period muwashshahs, old songs as well as pieces on piano. He also met Baron Rodolphe d'Erlanger and frequented the musician Ahmed El Wafi . He also composes for many performers like Choube√Øla Rached. In November 1934 La Rachidia was formed, of which Tarnane was one of the founders and teachers. Among his famous students are Salah El Mahdi. In the 1940s, Saliha entered The Rachidia and Tarnane composed the majority of her songs. In the 1940s, Saliha entered The Rachidia and Tarnane composed the majority of her songs. Tarnane died on October 31, 1964 at the age of 70. == Discography == * Adhahab yazdadou hosnan * Taxim raml el maya * Ya zahratan * Mayyaztou bayna jamalouha * Taxim sika * Na'ourat al anghaam wattoub * Ya dha alladhi dhanna * Ya moukhjilan tal'atou al aqm * Istikhbar oud hessine saba * In Kana lennassi 'aidon == References == Category:1894 births Category:1964 deaths Category:Tunisian male singers Category:People from Bizerte Governorate ","title":"Khema√Øs Tarnane"},{"id":"63790018","text":"Poster for the film Hangyakuji (, The Conspirator) is a 1961 Japanese historical-fiction film directed by Daisuke Ito.

The group's activity was prominent in the 90s and the early 00s, with the club being involved in some of the most violent incidents in British hooligan history, in what was described as \\"some of the worst football related fighting ever witnessed in the United Kingdom,\\" and sometimes topping the football arrests table. ==Origins== While early hooligan firms of Sunderland fans appeared as far back as the 70s and the 80s, like the Vauxies (named after the Vaux Breweries), who were active in the late 70s and early 80s, the most famous hooligan firm is the Seaburn Casuals, named after the Seaburn area near Roker Park stadium. ==History and Rivalries== The Seaburn Casuals, in 1984, took over the Everton FC pub called The Blue House for several hours. They also had a strong rivalry with a Nottingham Forest FC firm due to its links with a Newcastle United firm. A few days before a game, in 1994, police snatched a pile of weapons, drugs worth thousands of pounds, and were preparing for a showdown with Nottingham hooligans. Before the 1998 FIFA World Cup, 26 Seaburn Casuals hooligans were arrested in a police raid after a military-issue smoke bomb was let out at a local pub after a fight with bouncers. By the end of the operation, over 60 were facing charges. Some of the Seaburn Casuals hooligans picked up in the raid were also involved with neo-Nazi groups like Combat 18. The operation failed when judge ruled CCTV footage from the pub inadmissible. Sunderland AFC used to be noted for football hooliganism. At the end of the 1999‚Äì2000 season, Sunderland topped the hooliganism table in the Premier League, with 223 fans arrested that season. ===Altercations with the Newcastle Gremlins=== In March 2002, the Seaburn Casuals fought with hooligans from the Newcastle Gremlins in a pre- arranged clash near the North Shields Ferry terminal, in what was described as \\"some of the worst football related fighting ever witnessed in the United Kingdom\\". The leaders of the Gremlins and Casuals were both jailed for four years for conspiracy, with 28 others jailed for various terms, based on evidence gained after police examined the messages sent by mobile phone between the gang members on the day. On 2 April 2003, about 95 fans were arrested when around 200 fans of Sunderland and Newcastle clashed in Sunderland city centre before an England UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying match against Turkey in the city. The fans then attacked the police, pelting them with missiles including bottles, cans and wheel trims. Some sources attributed these clashes to a resurgence in the conflict between the Gremlins and Seaburn Casuals.

Many of the winners (e.g., A-Trak, Craze, i.e. Merge, Rafik, and C2C) were prominent members of the turntablist community and were champions in other competitions. == Advancement Category Winners== * 1996 - Total Eclipse - First ITF battle * 1997 - Vinroc * 1998 - Vinroc * 1999 - A-Trak * 2000 - A-Trak * 2001 - Woody - First European ITF Champion * 2002 - Kodh * 2003 - Tiger Style * 2004 - Rafik * 2005 - Pro Zeiko == Scratch Category Winners== * 1997 - Babu * 1998 - Craze * 1999 - Prime Cuts * 2000 - Prime Cuts * 2001 - Spryte One * 2002 - i.e. Merge * 2003 - Flip * 2004 - Rafik * 2005 - Rafik == Beat Juggling Category Winners== * 1997 - Babu * 1998 - Develop * 1999 - Lil Jaz * 2000 - Infamous * 2001 - Jr. Flo * 2002 - Troubl * 2003 - Kid Fresh * 2004 - Rasgunyado * 2005 - Pro Zeiko == Team Category Winners== * 1997 - Beat Junkies * 1998 - Beat Junkies * 1999 - Allies * 2000 - Scratch Action Hiro * 2001 - Nocturnal Sound Crew * 2002 - Nocturnal Sound Crew * 2003 - Lordz of Fitness * 2004 - Lordz of Fitness * 2005 - C2C ==References== Category:Turntablism ","title":"International Turntablist Federation"},{"id":"63790350","text":"Eva Smolkov√°-Keulemansov√° is a survivor of Auschwitz, Neuengamme, and Bergen- Belsen concentration camps. After her liberation, she became a renowned Czech scientist and professor of analytical science at Charles University in Prague. == Early life == Smolkov√°-Keulemansov√° was born on April 27, 1927, in Prague, the Czech Republic (then Czechoslovakia) to a Jewish family. She had a normal childhood in Czechoslovakia as an only child to her parents Alice and Oskar. She finished primary school and had started grammar school but was taken out of school by her father after anti-Jewish laws had started to apply to grammar schools. She was employed at various Jewish workshops after leaving school. == The Holocaust == On March 6, 1943, Eva and her parents were transported to the Theresienstadt Ghetto in Terez√≠n, where her father was separated from her and her mother. In Terez√≠n, she worked in agriculture, so she was able to go into the ghetto and managed to make contact with her father. In December 1943, she and her mother were transferred to Auschwitz concentration camp, where she stayed until June 1944. After six months of horrible conditions at Auschwitz, Eva and her mother were unexpectedly recognized as able to work and were relocated to the Dessauer Ufer camp of the Neuengamme concentration camp in Hamburg, where she experienced better conditions. Her final transport was without her mother to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in April 1945, which was liberated the same month. == After Liberation == Smolkov√°-Keulemansov√° suffered from dysentery, jaundice, typhus and tuberculosis after liberation. She could not give an address to anyone she knew in Prague, so the International Red Cross did not allow her to return to her country of origin. To receive medical treatment, she was selected to go to Sweden for a six-month recovery stay with 6,000 other prisoners. === Return to Prague === In November 1945, Smolkov√°-Keulemansov√°'s dream to return to Prague and continue her studies became a reality. She completed grammar school and realized that her biggest struggle in her supplementary exams was chemistry, so she began to study chemistry at Charles University in Prague, leading to her lifelong devotion and love for the subject. She graduated from the Faculty of Natural Sciences at Charles University in 1952. == \\"The First Lady of Chromatography\\" == After graduating, Smolkov√°-Keulemansov√° joined the Faculty of Sciences at Charles University and focused on analytical chemistry. In the early 1950s, she built a team focused on modern analytical separation methods such as gas chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography and electromigration. At this same time, she attended an analytical conference in Prague, leading to her finding a volumetric chromatographic device. Her team began to prepare its own device with volumetric detection, and constructed a more universal glass thermal conductivity detector, allowing them to analyze a larger variety of gas. Little did she know that this was a new idea and, soon after, this detector became part of a commercially available instrument. Because of her innovation and dedication to the field, people started telling her that she was \\"the first lady of chromatography\\". == Recognition == Smolkov√°- Keulemansov√° became one of the leading experts in the field of chromatography. She was the first professor of chemistry in the Czech Republic and one of the first in Europe. Not only did she continue her studies in chemistry, but she also focused on polarography, a PhD focused on gas chromatography and a DrSc concentrated on inclusion compounds in chromatography. In the early 1970s, inclusion complex formations in selective analytical separations became a major focus of Smolkov√°-Keulemansov√°'s, her first choice being cyclodextrins, but moving on with urea and thiourea for the separation of isomers. Her research on cyclodextrins started soon after her methods focused on gas chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography and electromigration. Her research became more widespread and she was asked to add many monographs on cyclodextrins, one of them being for a compendium on supramolecular chemistry edited by Jean-Marie Lehn. She has written and co-written 140 original papers and numerous reviews and has contributed to many books, including her work in Journal of High-Resolution Chromatography, \\"A Few Milestones on the Journey of Chromatography\\", and an article in the journal Chromatographia, \\"Study of retention of isomeric aromatic hydrocarbons on GTCB and cyclodextrins\\". \\\\- == References == Category:1927 births Category:Living people ","title":"Eva Smolkov√°-Keulemansov√°"},{"id":"63790358","text":" M/V Northern Sea Wolf is a roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ferry operated by BC Ferries in British Columbia, Canada. Her normal sailing schedule is five days a week during the peak summer season on the Inside Passage route connecting Bella Coola and Port Hardy. The route normally takes about ten hours to complete. Her schedule calls for one trip per day during daylight hours to maximize passenger enjoyment of the scenery. == Construction == The ship was built at the Ambelaki Shipyard at Ambelaki, Salamis, Greece by the Panagiotakis Brothers company. She was launched in 2000. Her hull is built of welded steel plates. She is long, with a beam of . She has a large vehicle loading ramp that comprises most of her transom. She cruises at 15 knots, driven by two propellers. Propulsion power is provided by two 2,399 KW Cummins diesel engines. ==European service== Aqua Spirit at Naxos, Greece in 2013, showing vehicle loading ramp The ship was christened Agios Andreas II. She began her life as a ferry on the Piraeus to Aegina route in Greece. In 2004 she was chartered to the Kefalonia Line and sailed between islands in the Ionian Sea. In July 2005 she was sold to Atlas V Shipping and renamed Andreas II. Under this new ownership, she sailed between Kythira Island and Neapoli Voion in Greece. In October 2007 she was acquired by a Swedish company, Orvelin Group, and renamed Mr. Shoppy One. During this period she shuttled across the Skagerrak, between Str√∂mstad, Sweden and T√∏nsberg, Norway, and on Mondays between Str√∂mstad and Skagen, Denmark. The motivation of her Norwegian passengers was to buy liquor and other goods in Sweden, where taxes were lower, and then sail home. Norwegian customs authorities resisted the loss of tax revenue and fined Overlin Group SEK9 million. Overlin's countersuit failed and the ship was laid-up in Gothenburg in 2009. On April 28, 2011 the ship was sold to Orveline Hellenic Shipping Company of Piraeus. The company executed a five-year bareboat charter agreement with NEL Lines which renamed the ship Aqua Spirit. She departed Gothenburg on June 14, 2014 for her new assignment. She returned to Greece and served as a ferry in the Cyclades in the Aegean Sea. She was idled when NEL Lines went bankrupt in 2015. In February 2016 she was chartered to Seajets and continued her service among the Cyclades. == British Columbia Service == BC Ferries provided direct Bella Coola - Port Hardy service using Queen of Chilliwack until 2013 when it was cancelled by the provincial government due to steep financial losses on the route. The minister of transportation at the time reported that British Columbia taxpayers paid a $2,500 subsidy for each vehicle on the ferry. Tourism operators were hurt by the cancellation and put pressure on the government to restore service. During the 2017 provincial election campaign, Premier Christy Clark promised to restore the service in 2018. The premier's short timeframe ruled out building a new ship. After a global search, BC Ferries identified Aqua Spirit, then 17 years old, as its best choice. On August 30, 2017, she was acquired for CAD$12.6 million. BC Ferries renamed the ship Northern Sea Wolf after a process of community engagement. The name honors a First Nations legend that the sea wolf is a manifestation of the orca. After dry-docking in Malta, the ship sailed to Esquimalt, British Columbia via the Panama Canal. The voyage took 35 days with fuel stops in the Canary Islands, Antigua, Panama, and Manzanillo. On arrival in British Columbia, in January 2018, Northern Sea Wolf was sent to Esquimault Drydock Company for a major refit. The main propulsion engines and gearboxes were overhauled. New electrical generators were installed and electrical switchboards upgraded. Navigation and safety systems were upgraded. A full galley was added. Passenger accommodations and crew spaces were reconfigured and refurbished. When work began, however, a number of deficiencies that had been missed by both the classification societies and BC Ferries' own surveyors became apparent. These included problems with the fire safety systems, corrosion, propeller shafts, and HVAC systems. BC Ferries was unable to meet the premier's goal of having the ship in service during the 2018 season. It was a year late. Similarly, while the budget for the acquisition and refit of the ship was $55.7 million, the final cost was $75 million, 30% over budget. The Canadian federal government contributed $15.1 million to the project. Northern Sea Wolf made her maiden commercial voyage on her Bella Coola - Port Hardy route on June 3, 2019.. During the course of the 2019 season, the ship made 130 trips. She carried more than 5,750 passengers and 2,265 vehicles. In 2019 adult fares started at $199.25, and standard cars were carried for $403. On November 22, 2019, Northern Sea Wolf hit a log while underway. The log strike damaged both propellers, necessitating dry-docking the vessel for repairs. She was replaced by the smaller ferry Nimpkish. In April 2020, BC Ferries announced that Northern Sea Wolf would not run during the 2020 season due to decreased travel during the Covid-19 pandemic. The off-season schedule would continue to be run by the Nimpkish. ==Amenities== Northern Sea Wolf features these passenger amenities: *Coastal Cafe *Outdoor observation deck *First Nations art.

Gardiner was on the southern terminus of a branch line from Livingston and is at the northern border of Yellowstone National Park. Passengers would be shuttled to/from the park via stagecoach. The station was designed by Robert Reamer in the rustic style. Passenger service eventually diminished from Gardiner, and the station was torn down in 1954. ==Site description== The station was designed by architect Robert Reamer in 1903, who also designed the Old Faithful Inn at Yellowstone. These structures were both designed in the rustic style, and this style was set as a precedent for other national park buildings. The walls were made out of logs, with the foundation set with stone. The red and black Northern Pacific yin-yang symbol was used throughout the building, including on the stations' floor and doors. The exterior of the station featured a curving platform, with the rail track on one side and space for carriages on one side. A pond was also created between the station and the Roosevelt Arch. ==History== The Yellowstone Park branch line was first completed in 1883 by the Northern Pacific Railway. The line ended at Cinnabar station, north of Gardiner. The line was marketed as the first railroad line to a national park. The line was not completed to Gardiner due to a disagreement between the railroad and the owner of a land claim in Gardiner. The line was extended to Gardiner in June 1902. Cinnabar was abandoned and became a ghost town after operations shifted to Gardiner. The initial track to Gardiner was not built with turning capabilities and trains had to backtrack to Cinnabar to reverse. President Theodore Roosevelt visited the town via the railroad in 1903, but the track and depot were not fully operational yet. The nearby Roosevelt Arch had its cornerstone placed by Roosevelt on April 24, 1903. A new turning track along with a permanent depot opened later in 1903. Throughout the majority of the station's life, one train in each direction was operated to/from Livingston, north. During the peak summer months, through Pullman sleeping car service was available from Chicago and Seattle via the North Coast Limited. A peak of \\"more than 17,000\\" annual passengers used the branch line in 1925. With the introduction of the automobile and bus, rail service to Gardiner declined significantly. In 1915, the Northern Pacific (plus other railroads at other gates) brought in 44,477 people compared to 7,418 by car. This greatly decreased to 26,845 rail passengers out of 194,771 total visitors in 1930. The last scheduled passenger service ran in 1948. Special charter trains operated until 1955, and the last service to Gardiner was a pack of girl scouts. The depot was demolished in 1954, and replaced by a joint building serving the city's water department, public library, and sheriff's department. Gardiner High School was also built on the former railroad land. A new library designed in the style of the old station was considered has been proposed under the 2015 \\"Gardiner Gateway Project\\", although the current status of the project is unknown. The track between Livingston and Gardiner was abandoned by Northern Pacific successor Burlington Northern in 1981. ==References== Category:Former Northern Pacific Railway stations Category:Yellowstone National Park Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1903 Category:Railway stations closed in 1954 Category:Robert Reamer buildings Category:Rustic architecture in Montana Category:Transportation in Park County, Montana Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Montana Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1954 ","title":"Gardiner station"},{"id":"63790561","text":"Veronika Gotseva (; born 29 May 1993) is a Bulgarian footballer who plays as a forward for the Bulgaria women's national team. ==International career== Gotseva capped most recently for Bulgaria at senior level in a 0‚Äì6 friendly loss to Croatia on 14 June 2019. ==References== Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Women's association football forwards Category:Bulgarian women's footballers Category:Bulgaria women's international footballers Category:Bulgarian expatriate footballers Category:Bulgarian expatriate sportspeople in North Macedonia Category:Expatriate footballers in North Macedonia ","title":"Veronika Gotseva"},{"id":"63790565","text":"Valley Medical Center may refer to the following hospitals: * Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose, California * Valley Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas, Nevada * Willamette Valley Medical Center in McMinnville, Oregon ** Valley Medical Center Heliport ==See also== * Valley Hospital (disambiguation) * Medical centers named after valleys: ** Arkansas Valley Regional Medical Center ** Cagayan Valley Medical Center ** Chino Valley Medical Center ** Lehigh Valley Hospital ** Lompoc Valley Medical Center ** Ohio Valley Medical Center ** Pascack Valley Medical Center ** Queen of the Valley Medical Center ** San Luis Valley Regional Medical Center ** Star Valley Medical Center ** UCHealth Yampa Valley Medical Center ** Utah Valley Hospital ","title":"Valley Medical Center"},{"id":"63790592","text":"Denzel Radford (born May 28, 1994) is a professional Canadian football defensive back for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL).

The family spoke Greek at home. ==Crosses for Losses== The first cross that Zanis (by this time, a resident of Aurora, Illinois) built was for his own father-in-law, a murder victim. Shortly after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, Zanis constructed 15 crosses (thirteen for the victim and two for the shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold) and delivered them to a park near the site of the shooting. The two crosses for Harris and Klebold were soon cut down by the father of one of the shooting victims. Since that time, Zanis built and delivered over 26,000 crosses, some with Stars of David and some crescents to sites of mass shootings and natural disasters across the United States. He later founded an organization to raise funds for this effort, called \\"Crosses for Losses\\". During that time, he kept handwritten notebooks of the names of the victims for whom he built memorials for. ==Personal life== In late 2019, Zanis was diagnosed with bladder cancer.

The piece was commissioned as part of city's Art in Public Places program and was designed by Jeff Barber of Cannon Falls, Minnesota. The sculpture, which depicts an oddly proportioned cottontail rabbit, was permanently installed on Minnehaha Parkway in 2002. Cottontail on the Trail has been well-received by residents of the surrounding area, who often decorate it seasonally or in response to current events. ==History== In the late 1990s, the city of Minneapolis sought public input for several neighborhood \\"gateway art projects\\" to be installed throughout the city through its Art in Public Places program. City councilmember Scott Benson, who was at the time the Hale, Page and Diamond Lake Community Association's president, recalled that members of the community sought art \\"that would represent the beauty of the neighborhood [and] capture our appreciation for nature.\\" Benson also stated that people desired art that was whimsical. Proposals from artists were solicited. An artwork depicting Native Americans and an outdoor living room were among those not selected. Cannon Falls-based sculptor Jeff Barber won the selection process with his proposal for Cottontail on the Trail, for which the city paid $50,000, a combination of public money and donations. Barber worked intermittently on the sculpture for two years before it was installed via crane in September 2002. The piece was dedicated on November 23 of that year. ==Design== Cottontail on the Trail is a bronze sculpture depicting an oddly proportioned cottontail rabbit. It measures long and high and weighs . It is displayed surrounded by red mulch along Minnehaha Parkway near its intersection with Portland Avenue South. The piece is atypical of Barber's style, which typically tends to be more abstract than Cottontail on the Trail. Barber said that \\"The general rule of thumb when it comes to the taste of the American public is that they want to recognize what they're looking at\\" and took inspiration for the piece from the whimsy sought by community members in the input process. ==Reception== Writer Andy Sturdevant described Cottontail on the Trail as \\"probably the best-known piece of art\\" along Minnehaha Creek between Lake Harriet and Minnehaha Falls. Local paper City Pages listed the sculpture as the best landmark in the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul metropolitan area in 2019, writing that the piece \\"isn't glitzy or challenging‚Äîit's just a big-ass bunny that reliably brings smiles to passersby.\\" A 2014 survey by Minneapolis's Community Planning and Economic Development department found that 53% of the 58 respondents felt that the sculpture was connected to the community in which it was situated and over 80% said the piece contributed to the surrounding area. Of those surveyed, 40% identified it as a contributing factor in their decision to pass by that particular location on that day. Many respondents considered Cottontail on the Trail to be iconic and said the work served as a gathering space for the community. The sculpture has garnered the nickname of the \\"Minnehaha Bunny\\" from residents. Children often climb on the sculpture and people who live nearby have frequently costumed and decorated it based on seasonal occasions or topical events such as leaving eggs by the sculpture during Easter or cladding the mouth of the sculpture with a large cloth face mask during the COVID-19 pandemic. ==See also== * Rabbits and hares in art ==References== Category:2002 establishments in Minnesota Category:2002 sculptures Category:Buildings and structures in Minneapolis Category:Outdoor sculptures in Minnesota Category:Bronze sculptures in Minnesota Category:Culture of Minneapolis Category:Public art in Minnesota Category:Rabbits and hares in art ","title":"Cottontail on the Trail"},{"id":"63791086","text":"The 2005 Queen's Birthday Honours in New Zealand, celebrating the official birthday of Queen Elizabeth II, were appointments made by the Queen in her right as Queen of New Zealand, on the advice of the New Zealand government, to various orders and honours to reward and highlight good works by New Zealanders.

He belongs to Bouloussou family of Yanam and his father being a prominent politician during French colonial rule in Yanam in the early 20th century. He was named after his paternal grandfather Zagannadha Sastroulou. His maternal uncle was Kala Venkata Rao, a freedom fighter, and former minister of Madras state and Andhra Pradesh. B. J. Sastry is influenced by Indian nationalism due to his uncle and Bengali Renaissance due his stay at Bengal for many decades. So, he didn't retake his French nationality when such an option was given after 1962 Independence of French India. He was a polyglot and could speak around 8 languages (Telugu, French, English, Tamil, Hindi, Bengali, Urdu, and Sanskrit). ==Education== Owing to political disturbances in French Yanam in early 20th century, he had his primary and secondary education at nearby Amalapuram town in Konaseema region with the support of his uncle Kala Venkata Rao. Later, he pursued his Bachelors in Electrical Engineering (B.E.E.) at The National Council of Education, Bengal, now known as Jadavpur University. During that time he obtained accommodation at Nalam choultry (‡∞®‡∞æ‡∞≥‡∞Ç ‡∞µ‡∞æ‡∞∞‡∞ø ‡∞∏‡∞§‡±ç‡∞∞‡∞Ç) on recommendation of his father Soubramanion Sastroulou. That choultry established by Nalam Krishna Rao at Calcutta. ==Marriage== He married Annapurna (n√©e Mangipudi), daughter of a Mangipudi Zamindar at Peddapuram during circa 1942 at Muramalla within the Veereswaraswamy temple. It was a 5-day marriage (‡∞Ö‡∞Ø‡∞ø‡∞¶‡±Å ‡∞∞‡±ã‡∞ú‡±Å‡∞≤ ‡∞™‡±Ü‡∞≥‡±ç‡∞≥‡∞ø ayidu rojula pe·πá·∏çli ) as per Hindu tradition. However, the couple had no children. ==Career== It so happened that he lost his degree. So, instead for asking for a duplicate degree, he had obtained an equivalent degree, i.e. Associate member (AMIE) on 29 December 1950 at Institution of Engineers (India). He was among one the earliest life members of the Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA) (at least since 1952).http://www.sciencecongress.nic.in/pdf/life_members/LM_2019_2020.zip ISCA is a premier scientific organisation of India with headquarters at Kolkata, West Bengal.

Along with Charles Anderson of Birmingham he was one of the premier African American yodelers. Beulah Henderson of New Orleans was also a yodeler.Jazz Archivist, Tulane University Volume 9 Number 2 December 1994 page 11 pdf file He drew praise for his yodeling and comedy in a 1921 revue with Irvin Miller.

Starting with the Sclaveni and Antae migrations into the Balkans, the succession of medieval Serbian states went through several periods of warfare with the Eastern Roman Empire. ==Early Contact between Constantinople and the Slavs== Some of the earliest belligerent contacts between Byzantium and the Slavs was during the Avar-Byzantine wars during the late 6th century, during which much of the Avar army was made up of Pannonian Slavs. During this period of invasion, often thought to be spanning from 574-588, the regions of Thracia and Moesia were devastated by up to a hundred thousand Sclaveni. ===Slavic invasions of the Balkans=== Serbian Principality in 850 The settlement of the Southern Slavs in the Eastern Roman Empire began in the mid-5th century with Slavic tribes along the Danube in Bavaria and Pannonia crossing over and settling in modern-day Bosnia and Croatia, slowly settling in Moesia, Scythia Minor, and Epirus, with some tribes moving as far south as the Peloponnese. During the 620s, an unnamed Serbian prince led a horde of White Serbs across the Danube to settle the western Balkans during the reign of Heraclius. These and many other Slavic tribes that settled in Sirmium, Moesia Superior, and nearby regions soon emerged as a unified Serbian cultural and political identity, emerging as the Principality of Serbia under the descendants of the unnamed Serbian prince. ===Principality of Serbia=== During most of the existence of this early medieval Serbian state, organized much like a confederation of tribes, headed by a Vlastimiroviƒá prince, the Serbs spent very little time in opposition to the Byzantine state. Much of the focus in the 8th and early 9th centuries was against Arab fleets, which often came into the Adriatic. The small amount of aggression between Serbs and Byzantines came from the limited Narentine piracy of Venetian trade vessels, which was responded to with several Venetian crackdowns in Pagania. Following the death of ƒåaslav Vlastimiroviƒá, the principality split into Duklja under the Vojislavljeviƒá dynasty and several smaller principalities, while the rest was annexed by the Byzantine Empire, which began to recover lost territory and by 1025 reached its highest territorial peak since the Arab conquests of Egypt and the Levant. ==Grand Principality of Serbia== The Grand Principality of Serbia regained its independence under Vukan Vojislavljeviƒá in the early 1090s, taking advantage of Alexios Komnenos' preoccupation in the struggle against the invading Seljuks. This power was quickly consolidated after the Serbs defeated a Byzantine army sent to pacify them in 1092 and obtained recognition from Alexios in two separate treaties between 1093 and 1095. Violations of this treaty were common, and the Serbian-Byzantine borders would often shift, especially around the cities of Ni≈° and Skopje. Vukan went on to found the Vukanoviƒá cadet branch of the Vojislavljeviƒá dynasty, which would rule over Ra≈°ka, Zeta, Ni≈°, and other regions until Stefan Nemanja defeated his brother Tihomir, who had been supported by a Byzantine army, and took the throne for himself, founding the Nemanjiƒá branch. ===Stefan Nemanja=== While the Vojislavljeviƒái were better about keeping their pacts with the Byzantines, both them and their successors, the Nemanjiƒái, were rather keen on taking territory from the declining state, whose last powerful Basileus, Manuel Komnenos, died in 1180. Following his demise, almost all remaining Byzantine holdings on the Adriatic Sea save Ragusa were conquered by Nemanja. A few years later, as the Catholic armies of the Third Crusade were keeping the Ayyubids occupied, Isaac Angelos turned his attention towards reconquering lost territories in the Balkans, primarily Bulgaria, but after that campaign failed he attacked Serbia instead, drawing an early victory on the Morava river and driving Nemanja into the mountains. However, domestic issues began to rise up in Constantinople, and that on top of Isaac's admiration for Nemanja, led the Basileus to abandon his campaign to reconquer Serbia. ===Du≈°an=== Byzantine & Serbian Empires in 1355 In 1331 young Stefan Uro≈° IV Du≈°an rose to the Serbian throne and over the course of twenty years conquered Epirus, Albania, the lands around Thessalonica, and much of Thessaly from the dwindling Byzantine Empire, founding the Serbian Empire. Du≈°an had taken advantage of Constantinople's situation, which was very preoccupied battling constant Turkish raids, civil unrest, and dynastic revolts. This conquest of Greece didn't last long as his successor, Stefan Uro≈° V, was a considerably weaker leader, and Du≈°an's empire had entirely collapsed into small provinces by the 1370s, and were conquered by the early 15th century. The fall of the Serbian Empire marked the end of the Byzantine-Serbian wars, as Byzantium itself had become so small that it no longer shared a border with any Serbian polities. Byzantium shared the same fate as the Serbian provinces, being conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1453. ==References== Serbia Byzantine Category:Medieval history of the Balkans ","title":"Byzantine‚ÄìSerbian wars"},{"id":"63791436","text":"Dennis Ruprecht is a New Hampshire politician serving in the New Hampshire House of Representatives.

He was known for his role in negotiating the Panama Canal treaties in 1977. ==Biography== Escobar was trained as a criminal lawyer, and was a member of the communist party in Panama. Due to his political views he was initially jailed by the right-wing government of Omar Torrijos when it took power after a coup in 1968. However, he later became an advisor to Torrijos's government. In the aftermath of the Leyla Express and Johnny Express incidents in 1971, in which two freighters bearing Panamanian flags were seized by the Cuban government on suspicion of transporting arms and mercenaries to Cuba, Escobar led the Panamanian delegation to Cuba to negotiate the release of the captain of one of the freighters. Escobar was appointed Panama's chief negotiator when the United States and Panama negotiated the 1977 Panama Canal treaties. In this position, he helped Panama regain partial control over the Panama Canal, which had been in United States control since 1903. He was described as a capable diplomat. In 1979 he became one of the founders of the Democratic Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Democr√°tico, PRD), the political arm of the Panamanian military, and served as its president. When Manuel Noriega became the de facto leader of Panama in 1983 Escobar kept his position as a political advisor. In 1988 the United States demanded that Noriega be removed from his position; Escobar again represented Panama in the negotiations that followed. Arguing against the United States' position, Escobar stated \\"We don't accept that the United States can dictate when we can or cannot be in our country, be it Noriega or any other Panamanian.\\" The negotiations were unsuccessful, and after the United States invasion of Panama in 1989 removed Noriega from power, Escobar was jailed. When the PRD came back to power after elections in 1994, Escobar was made an advisor to the foreign affairs minister. Escobar served for a period as the rector of the University of Panama. He wrote the book, Torrijos: ¬°Colonia americana no!, about the government of Torrijos. He died in 1995 in a hospital in Panama City. A local news service reported throat cancer as the cause of death. ==References== Category:1927 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Panamanian diplomats Category:Panamanian lawyers Category:Democratic Revolutionary Party politicians Category:People's Party of Panama politicians Category:Deaths from cancer in Panama Category:Deaths from throat cancer Category:20th-century lawyers ","title":"R√≥mulo Escobar Bethancourt"},{"id":"63791498","text":"The following is a list of retired soccer players who have made at least 300 domestic league appearances in Australian league soccer.

A Jewish congregation existed by the 1780s. This community operated a synagogue that was located in Philipsburg, between Front Street and Back Street. After Hurricane San Mateo hit Sint Maarten on September 21, 1819, the synagogue was destroyed and the island's Jewish community dwindled (although the process probably started around 1800). Remnants of the synagogue can still be found behind what is now the Guavaberry Emperium on Front Street. Wheher a Jewish cemetery existed in Philipsburg is debated. In the early 1850s, only 3 Jews lived in Sint Maarten. This was only 0.1% of the total population (the majority of the population, 56.8%, were slaves). Eventually, all Jews left the island. Jews resettled on the island beginning in 1964. With the steady growth of the Jewish population and tourism on the island, initially, rabbis would visit for the holidays or for special occasions. Since 2009 there is a permanent rabbi on the island. The temporary synagogue was replaced by a new synagogue off Billy Folly Road in Simpson Bay. A daily minyan operates in the building, interrupted by the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Sint Maarten. The number of Jews who permanently live on Sint Maarten has been estimated to number 200. The community provides services to Jews who live on Sint Maarten as well as Jews who visit it, the Collectivity of Saint Martin, and Anguilla. The Chabad branch also provides services to students and staff at the American University of the Caribbean on Sint Maarten.

The Bouloussou family of Yanam is one of the prominent native families in Yanam, Puducherry, since, French Indian era. Many members of that family have been successful in politics and engineering. Some others include that of Kamichetty, Mazety, Madimchetty, Nallam, Bezawada, Manyam etc.The Telugus of Yanam and Masulipatnam: From French rule to Integration with India (2007), by J B Prashant More.Frenchi Palanalo Yanam (2013), by Bolloju Baba. ==Origin== The people of surname Bouloussou/Bulusu (‡∞¨‡±Å‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞∏‡±Å) belong to Telugu Brahmins of smarta tradition with Gautama sagotraBrahmanula Indlaperlu Gotralu Pravaralu (2016), Mohan Publications, Rajahmundry-1. and adhere to ƒÄpastamba Dharmas≈´tra from the Taittƒ´riya ≈õƒÅkhƒÅ of Krishna Yajurveda. The difference in orthography of the name is due to French and English translations, where it is written as Bouloussou in the former and Bulusu in the latter. As per narration in Narayaneeyam (Telugu) written by Sri Kalluri Venkata Subrahmanya Deekshitulu,Narayaneeyam, Sri Kalluri Venkata Subrahmanya Deekshitulu, Published by B.V.S.S.Mani, 95, Broadway, Madras, 1977 the original folk bearing this surname used to reside within the Kakatiya domain and the surname came from a common Telugu dish pulusu (‡∞™‡±Å‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞∏‡±Å), which implies a spicy tamarind sauce in Telugu states. This surname over a period of time changed to Bulusu and the Islamic invasions forced the folk to move towards velanadu region. The any smarta vaidiki brahmin who resided in that region started to be referred traditionally as Velanati vaidika (‡∞µ‡±Ü‡∞≤‡∞®‡∞æ‡∞ü‡∞ø ‡∞µ‡±à‡∞¶‡∞ø‡∞ï) or recently in modern times as Vaidika velanatlu (‡∞µ‡±à‡∞¶‡∞ø‡∞ï ‡∞µ‡±Ü‡∞≤‡∞®‡∞æ‡∞ü‡±ç‡∞≤‡±Å). The paternal ancestors of this Bouloussou family hail from nearby Ainapuram village situated the other side of Gautami Godavari river in the Konaseema region of Andhra Pradesh. Hence, they refer themselves as Ainapuram Bulusu to distinguish themselves from other Bulusu families. When and how this family moved to nearby French colony of Yanaon remains unknown. ==Prominent persons== Bouloussou Soubramaniom Sastroulou was politician, judge advocate at Yanam during early twentieth century. He was Diwan of Manyam Zamindarp.202, The aristocracy of southern India (1903), A.

His popularity later paved way for his plunge into Yanam politics.Journal Officiel des √©tablissements fran√ßais dans l'Inde, 1928. Later his elder son Bulusu Jaganadha Sastry was a prominent engineer from Yanam before Independence. B. J.

As the technique evolved, periodontally accelerated osteogenic orthodontics (PAOO), to correct the deficient alveolar bone (dehiscences and fenestrations) that are often associated with gingival recessions, simultaneous bone augmentation with particulate bone graft (allgraft/xenograft) and collagen membrane were also added to the original corticotomies. Various flap design modifications have been suggested,including the full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap reflection or the VISTA approach.

He was born in East Baltimore. He documented the civil rights movement in the U.S., including Martin Luther King Jr.'s Poor People's Campaign and Resurrection City in Washington, D.C. Days after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, Houston left his job to become a full-time documentary photographer. Hoping to capture social movements and to contribute social commentary through his photographs, he showed his work to publishers and agencies in New York. After meeting the photographer Gordon Parks, he was hired by the Black Star photography agency. Beginning in May 1968, he worked as a photojournalist for Life magazine, where he was assigned to photograph the Poor People's Campaign in Washington, D.C. During the Campaign, Resurrection City was constructed as a tented community that held nearly 3,000 residents on the National Mall.

The term can also be used to describe the songs, dances, totems, knowledge of country, and Dreamtime stories that are part of awelye. The practice of awelye is still actively performed throughout Central Australia for both social and healing purposes. Equivalent male ceremonies include pujjarli (also yilpinji). == Significance == The practice of awelye is a collective form of matrilineal kinship and sharing of knowledge of the land, customs, and Dreamtime stories. Teachings are expressed in different modalities such as song, rhythm, melody, gestures and dance, gathering, graphic imagery, totem objects, and spatial orientation. Within awelye, there are many differentiated roles and relationships which form a complex whole. Awelye is important to kin bonding, education of country, and the passing on of tradition, which is done through gradual participation of the young. Furthermore, as Linda Barwick has observed, awelye has an increasingly important role in \\"the political and social recognition of performance in gaining and continuing to assert rights to land in contemporary Australian society\\". == Continuation == Awelye is still actively practised by Anmatyerre and Alyawarr peoples. Although, rapid post-colonial social and demographic changes such as the degeneration of clan family structures into smaller nuclear family units, has made it difficult for the intergenerational transmission (colloquially referred to as \\"holding onto\\") of awelye practices. Many younger generations are separated from community estates for educational, health, and employment opportunities in larger towns and cities. Additionally, the introduction of television and radio has succeeded most ceremonial traditions as the dominant form of entertainment. == Interpretation == Australian public intellectual Germain Greer has observed, \\"though Aborigines have no tradition of making portable paintings; they are all painters. Part of 'awelye', is painting the body with ceremonial designs.\\"Of Beauty and Consolation, season 1, episode 25, \\"Germain Greer,\\" created by Wim Kayzer, accessed April 27, 2020, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uPaeEmnvHA. === References === Category:Indigenous Australian culture ","title":"Awelye"},{"id":"63792504","text":"Gerald Wilson was a Canadian writer, best known for his screenplays.

It was the first ship of the Stoomvaart Maatschappij Nederland (SMN) that completed a round trip to the Dutch East Indies. == Context == === Steamships for the Suez Canal === SS Prins van Oranje was the second ship of the Willem III class, which were the first ships built for the Stoomvaart Maatschappij Nederland (SMN). The SMN was founded in May 1870 for the express purpose of establishing a steam shipping line to Java via the Suez Canal, which opened in 1869. This would require steamships of a 'new' class, the Willem III class. == Characteristics == === Dimensions === SS Prins van Oranje was reported to measure 320 * 39 * 30 feet. The cargo size of the ship was 2,789 tons GT. Tideman has general data about Prins van Oranje that is probably more exact: 97.53 m from bow to stern. Beam 11.96 m external. Depth of hold 9.775 m. Draught 6.7 m. . === Machinery === The compound steam engines were also delivered by the shipyard. They were of the improved Wolf system of nominal 400 hp, effective 1,600 ihp. The reporter A. Huet gave a simple explanation of the compound engine: Four boilers created steam with an over-pressure of 2 atm and pushed it into a small cylinder. In this cylinder the steam expanded to create movement. The steam then went to a reservoir and emerged in a bigger cylinder, where it again expanded to create movement. The steam then went to the surface condenser to become water. The explanation continued by stating that compound engines had been made before in the Netherlands for river tugboats by Fijenoord. John Elder was credited with making it suitable for use at sea, and improving and simplifying the concept so that it really delivered the advantages that calculations promised. The crucial aspect of the compound engine for use at sea was that using high pressure steam required the boilers to be fed with pure water. In order to achieve this, the cooling in the condenser was achieved by running the steam through metal tubes, which were kept cold by water that streamed outside of these pipes. By not mixing the steam with the cooling water, the result was that the steam became distilled water, that was fed back to the boilers. The result was a closed circuit between boilers and machine. Our reporter noted that even this surface condenser was not new, but had been invented 20‚Äì30 years earlier, and had fallen in disuse since. On the Glasgow to Nieuwediep route SS Prins van Oranje has used about 20 tons a day at a speed of 10 Knots an hour. === Accommodation === There was accommodation for 90 passengers first class, and 36 passengers second class. For both Willem III and Prins van Oranje the two major changes from the design as presented to the government were: engines of 400 nominal hp instead of 325 hp and capacity for 90 passengers first class, instead of 50 passengers first class. In 1875 the accommodation was radically changed, cf below. === Complement === The crew of Prins van Oranje consisted of 69 persons, but this was probably not counting civilian staff. == Service == === Construction and transfer === Prins van Oranje was built for Stoomvaart Maatschappij Nederland (SMN) by John Elder & Co. of Govan on the River Clyde. She was launched on Thursday 4 May 1871. On 29 June she left the shipyard in Glasgow to take in coal and make a trial run on the Clyde. On the trial run she was reported to have made 12 knots. It is traditionally the moment before ownership is transferred. On 8 July she finally left Glasgow for Nieuwediep. The voyage from Glasgow to Nieuwediep was made in 76 hours. In the evening of 11 July 1871 Prins van Oranje arrived in Texel, i.e. before Nieuwediep under Captain M.C. Braat. === First Voyage to the East Indies === HNLMS Schorpioen escorted Prins van Oranje out The first voyage of Prins van Oranje to the Dutch East Indies consisted of a speedy voyage to Batavia, and a very bad return trip. Prins van Oranje had entered the harbor of Nieuwediep on 12 July. Her departure was determined on 25 July. Now the usual loading of packages from the warehouses of the SMN took place, and all kinds of small vessels arrived to transload their cargo. Problems with loading or otherwise cause that departure was soon delayed to 29 July. Still somewhat later it became 'end of July'. On 27 July Prins Hendrik arrived in Nieuwediep to inspect the ship. At 5 o'clock in the morning of 30 July 1871 Prins van Oranje left from before Nieuwediep under Captain M.C. Braat. Prins Hendrik accompanied her for a while on HNLMS Schorpioen. On board were at least some of the passengers which had survived the disaster of Willem III. Among them Captain Pieter van der Velden Erdbrink, lieutenant 2nd class M.J.C. Lucardie and Miss Cornelia van Geuns. The cargo was very diverse, there were many industrial goods, but also wine, butter and cheese. In the afternoon of Sunday 13 August 1871 Prins van Oranje arrived in Port Said. After passing the Suez Canal she left Suez for Batavia on 18 August. On 9 September at 8 o'clock in the morning she passed Anyer on Sunda Strait, and at two o'clock in the afternoon she anchored before Batavia. The trip had taken 41 days and 9 hours. The steam vessel Tjiliwong was sent from Batavia to collect passengers. Captain Braat received a congratulatory telegram from Prins Hendrik. On 15 September the Governor- General visited Prins van Oranje. On 17 September the steam vessels Tjitarum and Tjiliwong would transport more than 600 visitors to the ship. On 21 September Prins van Oranje left Batavia for Semarang. At 10 o'clock in the morning of 22 September Prins van Oranje arrived in Semarang. A number of people visited her by using the steam vessel Moria, and there was a reception with champagne. A local newspaper made a report about Prins van Oranje. It noted that the ship was a modern vessel capable of efficiently transporting cargo between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies. With regard to passenger transport however, it thought that it could not compare to the ships of the Messageries Maritimes. Even its less opulent Meikong and Ava were far more comfortable and better ventilated. Even so, there were more aspects in which the French ships were better. On Sunday 1 October Prins van Oranje was open for the general public in Semarang, and on 2 October she left for Batavia. On 4 October 1871 Prins van Oranje arrived back in Batavia. For the return voyage she left Batavia on 15 October. She had primarily been loaded in Semarang. While there 3,000 piculs sugar and 14,500 piculs coffee had been loaded for the Netherlands Trading Society. For other traders from Semarang she carried: 4,200 piculs coffee, 4,570 kg of indigo, 5.5 piculs nutmeg, 1.75 piculs cinnamon, 0.75 piculs mace, 12 piculs gutta-percha. In Batavia 1,923 piculs of tin, 73,269 pounds of tea, 785 kg indigo, 870 pounds vanilla, 23 piculs of coffee and some other goods were added. There were 29 passengers and 79 soldiers on board. On 9 November Prins van Oranje arrived in Suez. During the passing of the Suez Canal the troubles began. On the 13th she was in Port Said with one or more broken propeller blades. One expected that this would cause her to remain in Port Said for a few days. On Friday 17 November she indeed left Port Said. On 2 December she arrived in Gibraltar with engine problems, others said screw blade problems. Some of the cargo of Prins van Oranje was transferred to the English Brig Thomas and John, so the necessary repairs could be made. By 8 December 1871 a telegram had been received which noted that the repair to the movement of the 'steam slide' would be done, and that some cargo from the stern of the ship had been moved to lighters, so the two propeller blades, which had been damaged in the Suez Canal, could be replaced. The photograph above might depict this event. The passengers continued to the Netherlands on another ship. On 23 December Prins van Oranje left Gibraltar, and on 30 December 1871 she finally arrived back in Texel. Prins van Oranje had completed the first direct round trip to the East Indies for the SMN. However, the trouble with the engine and propeller on the home bound voyage, meant that there was little reason for rejoicing. The net result of the first voyage was a loss of 9,104 guilders. It was one of the reasons that an extraordinary meeting of shareholders was convened on 25 March 1872. The bleak picture resulted from some matters of integrity, the burning of Willem III, the loss made on the first trip of Prins van Oranje, the bad start of the second trip of that ship, and the propeller blade problems of Prins Hendrik. It all caused quite a row in the meeting and outside of it. === Second voyage === The second voyage of Prins van Oranje to the Dutch East Indies was even worse than the first. The propeller blades broke on the trip towards Batavia, and even twice on the home-bound voyage. On 4 February 1872 Prins van Oranje left on her second trip. On 18 February she arrived in Port Said. On 21 February she left Suez. Prins van Oranje then somehow again broke her propeller blades. Captain Braat noted that the accident took place on 3 degrees north, 63 degrees east. In quick succession he lost three of the four propeller blades, and then changed course on 4 March. On 12 March Prins van Oranje was in Galle, Sri Lanka to get new propeller blades. By 19 March the propeller had been repaired, and some cargo was re-loaded into the ship. In the early morning of 24 March Prins van Oranje left Galle for Batavia. Onrust Dock of 3,000 tons would lift Prins van Oranje out of the water On 1 April 1872 Prins van Oranje arrived in Batavia. In Batavia she unloaded a very diverse cargo; clothes, books, utensils, liquor etc. Cargo destined for Semarang was transloaded to SS Koning Willem III. Prins van Oranje then entered Onrust Dock of 3,000 tons to fix her propeller blades, including the one that had still been attached after Galle. Engineer D. Boeke of the naval base at Onrust Island later gave some observations. He noted that the connection of the propeller blades to the axis was found to be solid and well- designed. The blades had broken off at about one-third of their length from the axis, so the defect was in the form, the size, or the materials used. At the moment of the inspection Boeke and others still thought that the Suez Canal played an essential role in the problem, because other companies had also gotten into trouble there. Prins van Oranje continued to Surabaya on 16 April. She arrived there on 18 April. On the way back from Surabaya halted a few hours to pick passengers in Semarang. On 30 April she was back in Batavia. On 8 May Prins van Oranje left Batavia again with about 300 people on board. In the night of 17‚Äì18 May one of the propeller blades broke off near 6.59 N 68.52 E. Prins van Oranje continued at a careful pace, some passengers noting increased vibrations. On 22 May she had reached 1.57 N 57.10 E, when at 2 o'clock in the afternoon another srew blade was lost. Because this was opposite the first one that was lost, the vibrations actually diminished. In the night of 24‚Äì25 May the third blade was lost with a sound that woke most of the passengers. By then Prins van Oranje was at 5.40 N 54.13 E, about 740 km from Cape Guardafui in Somalia. The chance of discovery by passing ships was by then much better. In order to re-assure the passengers they were reminded that on the way to Galle the last blade had lasted for 8 days. Now a southwestern wind came up which greatly aided the screw. On 26 May Cape Guardafui came in sight, and soon the ship was in the Gulf of Aden. In the morning of 28 May Prins van Oranje was 200 kilometers from Aden. In the evening of 28 May all passengers were assembled on deck after dinner. Suddenly the last propeller blade then broke with an enormous noise. When the lase propeller blade broke off the rocks of Aden were about 90‚Äì110 km away, and already in view. The ship came to a halt almost immediately, and the passengers could then contemplate what would have there faith if it had happened 10 days earlier. Because there was no wind the use of the sails was not an option. One of the boats was launched to get help in Aden. By luck already on the next morning, SS Riga from Leith came into view. Prins van Oranje hoisted a signal flag, and Riga changed course. After some negotiations Riga took Prins van Oranje into tow to Aden, where both arrived at two o'clock in the afternoon of 29 May. Two passengers then left Aden on the Ava of the Messageries Maritimes, and noted that ship and service were better and cost less. After a telegram from Aden, four propeller blades were immediately dispatched from Port Said. After repairs she left Aden in the evening of 13 June for Suez. At 3 AM in the morning of 15 June she arrived in Suez. Others say this was on 21 June. As the distance between Aden and Suez is about 3,000 km, a ship that has a speed of 19 km/h would take 157 hours, or 6.5 days, so 21 June is correct. In the Suez Canal Prins van Oranje again broke three propeller blades. On 27 June she was unloading in Port Said, so the propeller could be repaired. On 14 July new propeller blades had again been attached. By then there had been so much delay that sister ship SS Conrad, which had left for the East Indies after Prins van Oranje had overtaken her. SS Conrad left Port Said on 9 July, before Prins van Oranje, and took some of her passengers. On 20 July at six in the morning Prins van Oranje left Port Said for Nieuwediep. On 29 July she passed Gibraltar. On 1 August she arrived in Vigo, another sign of trouble. She left Vigo on 4 August. In the evening of 7 August she was near Dungeness, Kent. On 8 August she arrived in Nieuwediep. Engineer Boeke, who had seen the repairs at Onrust, made some further notes after the incident on the way to Aden. It was clear that Prins van Oranje had now lost a number of propeller blades which had never been in the Suez Canal. It was also remarkable that the SMN seemed to be the only shipping line which had so much trouble with breaking propeller blades, even while she used the same material that other companies used. He suspected that the cause of the breaking blades was in the very long stretches that the SMN ships steamed without pause. A critic noted that the propeller blades were of the Hirsch form. With that form, cast iron was not a recommended metal. Instead wrought iron or cast steel should have been used, or another type of blade should have been used. He continued with fierce reproaches on the technical management of the SMN, which should have taken measures way earlier, instead of blaming the trouble on accidentally hitting the ground or unknown wrecks. === Later voyages === The third voyage of Prins van Oranje started when she left Texel on 5 October 1872 under Captain E.W. Fabritius. On 18 October she arrived in Port Said. On 22 October she left Suez for Batavia. On 12 November 1872 she arrived in Batavia on the fastest voyages till then, 37 days and 20 hours. On 22 November she continued to Surabaya, from whence she left again on 1 December. After a stop in Samarang she arrived back in Batavia on 10 December. On 18 December Prins van Oranje left Batavia again for Nieuwediep. In the morning of 9 January 1873 she arrived in Suez. On 14 January she left Port Said. On 2 February 1873 Prins van Oranje arrived in Texel at 9 in the morning. There was trouble with floating ice, but at 12 o'clock she was on the quay in Nieuwediep. On 6 March 1873 Prins van Oranje left Texel again for her fourth voyage. On 20 March she reached Port Said. In the canal she was hindered by ships that were stuck, and it was 27 March before she left Suez for Batavia. On 17 April she anchored before Batavia. A special part of her cargo consisted of a machine gun, 1,000 barrels of gunpowder, 250,000 beaumont rifle cartridges, and a detachment of 125 troops. After visiting Surabaya Prins van Oranje captain Fabricius returned to Batavia, and left from there on 22 May. On 16 June she arrived in Suez, and on 18 June she was in Port Said, planning to leave from there on the 19th. On 5 July Prins van Oranje arrived back in Nieuwdiep. It was clear that the propeller blade problems had been fixed. On her fifth trip Prins van Oranje got an even bigger role in the Aceh War. She was to leave after a short turn around time on 5 August, and to transport 300 troops. She would also transport another shipment of Beaumont rifles and ammunition. On 5 August 1873 she left Nieuwediep. On 19 August she arrived in Port Said, and on the 23rd she left Suez for Batavia. On 15 September Prins van Oranje captain Fabritius arrived in Batavia with the troops. === Reconstruction by John Elder === Perhaps the SMN took notice of the criticism about the accommodation on board Prins van Oranje. In 1875 she was changed at John Elder's shipyard. The change consisted of changing almost the whole first class accommodation behind the boilers to cargo space, but with retention of the portholes, so this area could also be used to transport soldiers. The cabins before the boilers were made into second class accommodation. A new first class accommodation was built upon the deck. It consisted of a spacious saloon, and cabins for 57 first class passengers. This number of first class passengers was significantly less than the 90 carried previously, but ventilation might have been the prime reason to move them one deck up. The old 2nd class accommodation had been joined to the troop quarters, making it possible to transport 550 soldiers. On 7 August 1875 Prins van Oranje left Nieuwediep with: a full cargo, 50 first class passengers, 35 second class passengers, and 275 soldiers. At that moment all 6 SMN ships were in service, and their capacity to move troops was noted as 2,700 soldiers with the required officers and non commanding officers. === Accident in Indian Ocean === On New Year's Day 1900 Prins van Oranje broke her propeller shaft while steaming west of Sumatra at The current was at first S.W. then S.. later S.S.E. and E.N.E. Therefore Prins van Oranje drifted as far south as 0¬∞13' S and as far west as 90¬∞ E. On 4 January 2 officer H. Smitt proposed to send a well equipped boat to Padang to get help. Captain Potjer reasoned that there was no reason to do so, because the ship did not make water and had provisions that would last for months (she was a freighter at the time). Nevertheless, starboard boat I was provisioned with much food, high quality fresh water, double sails etc. etc. In the afternoon of 4 January it left with H. Smitt, second engineer T. Zuidema, 3rd officer H. Harms, 3rd engineer J. Ages, midshipman C.G.H. Keipin, and sailors C. Kort and A.W. Reekers. In the afternoon the boat was lowered and started to Padang. The idea was to sail / row E.N.E. to a position on the line Pulau Bodjo (one of the Batu Islands) - Point de Galle (Sri Lanka) in order to meet ships. On 9 January 1900 Prins van Oranje saw a steamer while at 0¬∞ S 90¬∞9\\" E. She fired signal shots and hoisted signal flags, but was not noticed. On 14 January 6:45 AM the crew sighted Prinses Sophie of the SMN. In turn the crew of Prinses Sophie noted Prins van Oranje on 0¬∞5\\" N 91¬∞35\\" E, 132 Geographical miles from Padang. Captain Soomer of Prinses Sophie had been in Padang on 12 January when the SMN sent a telegram ordering him to search for Prins van Oranje. He made a plan to sail in the direction, and then to follow the streams that could have caught Prins van Oranje. A big basket was hoisted in the foremast for a lookout, who would get 100 guilders if he saw the ship. Sailor A. Andersen was as lucky to first see Prins van Oranje on 14 January. Prinses Sophie now took Prins van Oranje in tow, and with a speed of 9 knots they went to look for the boat. Rewards were again promised, now by both captains, and by the passengers of Prinses Sophie who promised champagne if the boat was found. In the night of 15‚Äì16 January a big white light was seen. Soon after a red light showed, and at 3 in the night the boat was alongside Prins van Oranje. By 4 in the night the boat had been hoisted back on Prins van Oranje. In the morning of 17 January at 7 o'clock both ships were in the Emma harbor in Padang. Captain Potjer noted that the boat had done very well. The sustained heavy rain had been very uncomfortable, but the boat had profited from the accompanying winds. The contrary current and lack of wind were the only reason that the boat had not yet reached its destination. A few days later SS Madura towed Prins van Oranje to Batavia. == Italian Service == === Sold to an Italian company === On 2 July 1900 Prins van Oranje was auctioned, but did not get sold. A few days later ship broker W. de Lorme van Rossem sold her to a Genovese company for 7,750 GBP (93,000 guilders). The Italian company would rename her Maria On 26 July Maria left IJmuiden for Cardiff. ==References== * ==Notes== ==External links== *Prins van Oranje at Scottish Built ships *Prins van Oranje at Stichting Maritiem-Historische Databank Category:Steamships Category:Passenger ships of the Netherlands Category:Ships built on the River Clyde ","title":"SS Prins van Oranje"},{"id":"63793194","text":"John B. Hibbs Jr. is an American physician-scientist and educator. He is Distinguished Professor Emeritus in the Department of Medicine at the University of Utah. He is known for the discovery of the direct synthesis of L-citrulline and nitrogen oxides from L-arginine by murine activated macrophages, published in January 1987. This reaction was inhibited strongly by the non-toxic NG-monomethyl-L-arginine molecule. These observations provided the biochemical tools needed to establish the new and unexpected Ô¨Åeld of nitric oxide biochemistry and made possible its rapid initial progress in cardiovascular and neural physiology. In 1988, he directly measured the gas nitric oxide, simultaneously with Michael Marletta, showing that it is the proximal nitrogen oxide produced during the biological oxidation of a terminal guanidino nitrogen atom of L-arginine. == Early life and education == Hibbs was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania in 1936 where his father was a scholarly practicing physician. Hibbs attended Dartmouth College (1954-1958) and the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (1958-1962). His internship was at the University of Oregon Hospitals (1962-1963). He then served as a medical officer in the U.S. Army. Following military service he returned to the University of Oregon as a resident in Internal Medicine (1966-1968). His training in clinical infectious diseases and in research examining host resistance to intracellular pathogens was at Stanford University Medical Center under the mentorship of Jack Remington (1969-1971). == Career == Hibbs joined the University of Utah School of Medicine faculty as an Assistant Professor in 1971. He rose through the academic ranks to become a Distinguished Professor in 1999. He served as Chief of the Infectious Diseases Division of the University affiliated Veterans AÔ¨Äairs Medical Center from 1971 to 1989 and Chief of Infectious Diseases Division of the University of Utah Health Sciences Center from 1989 to 2011. == Research == In 1964, as a medical officer in the U.S. Army, Hibbs participated in the Bolivian hemorrhagic fever outbreak investigation directed by Karl Johnson. This experience stimulated his interest in infectious diseases and in research. As a result, after completing training in Internal Medicine at the University of Oregon, he began Infectious Diseases Fellowship training at Stanford University in 1969. The research portion of the training was in the laboratory of Jack Remington. There he showed that mice with chronic infection with intracellular protozoan parasites, which act as a persistent stimulus for cytokine production and macrophage activation, had increased resistance to malignant cell growth. In vitro activated macrophages from these mice expressed nonspeciÔ¨Åc cytotoxicity for malignant cells. Prior to these experiments, macrophage mediated cytotoxicity for malignant cells was thought to be due only to immunologically speciÔ¨Åc mechanisms. After completing Infectious Diseases training in 1971, Hibbs joined the Infectious Diseases Division faculty at the University of Utah. There he began a search for a biochemical explanation for nonspeciÔ¨Åc cytotoxicity mediated by activated macrophages. These experiments led to the discovery of the synthesis of L-citrulline and nitrogen oxides, including nitric oxide per se, from L-arginine, by mouse activated macrophages. He then, with colleagues, described a pattern of metabolic inhibition caused by nitric oxide in mammalian target cells and the involvement of nitric oxide in mouse activated macrophage antimicrobial activity.Hibbs JB Jr., Taintor RR., Vavrin Z, Granger DI., Drapier J-C, Amber IJ, Lancaster JR Jr., Synthesis of nitric oxide from a Terminal Guanidino Nitrogen Atom of L-argInine; a Molecular Mechanism Regulating Cellular Proliferation that targets Intracellular Iron.

Electricity supply for the South East Queensland region of Australia was affected between 6 February and 7 March 1985 by labour union strikes initiated by the ETU of SEQEB. On February 11, 1985 the Queensland government led by Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen ‚Äúsacked‚Äù over 1000 linesmen and other workers for refusing to return to work after they had been ordered to do so. A State of Emergency was enacted by the government on February 7 and operated until March 7. For a fortnight some 17,000 homes in South East Queensland were without power on a rotating scheme. Many industries were forced to shut down costing the economy an estimated $1 billion. The dispute enabled the Premier to introduce a number of legislative measures to curtail future union activity. == Background to the dispute == Between 1979 and 1984, the South East Queensland Electricity Generating Board (SEQEB) had been negotiating with the Electrical Trades Union (ETU) over working conditions for Electrical Trades Union employees and the use of casual contractors. SEQEB wanted to be able to employ cheaper casual staff to fix faults and connect power. The ETU was opposed to the privatisation of their industry. The ETU believed the move toward employing casual and contract staff would reduce job security for their employees, increase the length of the working week and would affect wage conditions. Negotiations continued into early February 1985 when discussions stalled on February 6. This resulted in over 1000 electrical workers going on strike indefinitely in support of the union. == Strike action == The Premier of Queensland declared a State of Emergency on February 7 under the State Transport Act 1938 and when the ETU rejected the orders of the Industrial Commission to return to negotiations, the striking workers were \\"sacked\\" on February 11. Operators of the respective power stations across Queensland cut supply in support of the striking workers. Included in this group were staff who were members of the Municipal Officers Association, who were also threatened with fines for showing support for the ETU workers. Working class support for the strike was strong with many other unions going out in protest with them . Domestic households and small business' within South East Queensland were forced to use candles, kerosene lamps and torches for lighting and power as ‚Äúload shedding‚Äô was employed to satisfy nightly demand for electricity for 14 days. After negotiation, ETU officials agreed to turn the lights back on and ordered a return to work on March 6, 1985 but many of the sacked workers and their families rejected the ETU decision due to the demands within the offer, which rolled back their conditions of employment as well as other requirements. The Premier ordered the Commissioner of Police, Terry Lewis to maintain a police presence outside of SEQEB depots to prevent workers, who wished to return to work from being harassed for being ‚Äòscabs‚Äô. The ETU was fined and the government pushed for it to be de-registered. The Premier refused to negotiate possible solutions in the Queensland Industrial Commission. The Bjelke Petersen government introduced new bills into parliament, including the Electricity Bill (Continuity of Supply), to forbid strikes and picketing by electricity workers. The bills included provision for the confiscation of workers property including their homes if they went out on strike, as well as significant fines. Union officials were banned from places of employment. Wages and conditions could be set by the Queensland Electricity Commissioner and any worker who protested could be fined or dismissed. Emergency union funds rapidly ran out. Many of the workers returned to work under new agreements or in new positions. By April 1985 more than 200 people had been arrested while protesting at rallies, including Senator George Georges. A trade blockage in April by workers from other unions was ordered to cease by the Australian government. The dispute dragged on until October 1985. == Representation in popular culture == The play, The hope of the world by Errol O'Neill was produced by the Queensland Theatre Company in 1996. Its unspoken background is the SEQEB dispute. Brisbane punk band La Fetts adapted their song \\"We hate relatives\\" to become \\"SEQEB Scabs\\" in 1985. It played in constant rotation on underground radio in Brisbane and featured in their set at the \\"Festival of Electric Lights\\" rally in King George Square, Brisbane. The documentary film, Friends and enemies (1987) by Tom Zubrycki, features interviews conducted with people representing union and government points of view to the SEQEB dispute over an 8-month period. == Legacy == The Queensland government de-registered the Electrical Trades Union for 6 months in the State Industrial Commission, the first deregistration of a union in 40 years. By October 1985, the government approved new measures to widen the use of \\"contract and casual labor\\". The ACTU failed in their negotiations on behalf of the ETU. The strike had lasting impacts on both the Queensland union movement as well as nationally. The actions of the Bjelke-Petersen government in this dispute ultimately helped to mobilise the labour movement within Queensland and led to the Fitzgerald Inquiry into police corruption and Bjelke-Petersen's resignation in 1987. == References == == External links == Category:1985 labor disputes and strikes Category:Labour disputes in Australia Category:1985 in Australia ","title":"SEQEB strike of Queensland, 1985"},{"id":"63793231","text":"Pratham (also Prathama, Prathamesh) (Sanskrit: ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§•‡§Æ) is a Hindu/Sanskrit Indian male given name meaning ‚Ä≤first‚Ä≤.

The unrest eventually led to the declaration of a nationwide State of Emergency on what was then a British colony. This was well before the subsequent 1966 riots and 1968 riots associated with the 1967 elections which preceded the country's independence of 12 March 1968. The riot was initiated by the murder of Police Constable Beesoo in his vehicle by a Creole gang. This was followed by the murder of a civilian named Mr. Robert Brousse in Trois Boutiques. The Creole gang then proceeded to the coastal historic village of Mahebourg. They assaulted the Hindu and Muslim spectators who were watching a Hindustani movie at Cin√©ma Od√©on. Mahebourg police recorded nearly 100 complaints of assaults on Indo-Mauritians. ==Events prior to the 1965 Riots== British forces had mostly withdrawn their troops from the island of Mauritius by 1960. The King's African Rifles (KAR) regiment had been present there until 1960 for more than 150 years. At the time of the 1965 riots the local police force was in a state of transition as the Special Mobile Force had been created in 1960 as a successor of the departed KAR regiment. Earlier in 1965 there had been a political assassination in the suburb of Belle-Rose in the town of Quatre Bornes. Indeed Rampersad Surath who was a Labour Party supporter was beaten to death by violent thugs from rival party PMSD during a street rally. Coupled with the May 1965 riots there was a sense of fear and local forces were unprepared to deal with such violence. As a result a State of Emergency was declared by the Governor in May 1965 which lasted for the rest of that year. ==Intervention by British troops from Yemen== Operation Fishplate was initiated by Great Britain and this involved the mobilisation of Coldstream Guards from Aden, Yemen to the island of Mauritius. The Coldstream Guards eventually left Mauritius in July 1965. Prior to these 1965 riots there had been a mostly uninterrupted period of peace in Mauritius since the Uba riots of 1937. ==Consequences of 1965 riots== Following the arrest of several suspects there were lengthy trials which ended with the jailing of at least a dozen of the aggressors. Furthermore there were improvements in the size and training of anti-riot intervention police. ==References== Category:1965 in Mauritius Category:Murder in Mauritius Category:1965 riots Category:History of Mauritius Category:Ethnic riots Category:Riots and civil disorder in Mauritius Category:May 1965 events ","title":"1965 Mauritius race riots"},{"id":"63793356","text":"(also known as \\"Crazy Nights\\") is the fourth single by Japanese heavy metal band Loudness, from their 1985 album Thunder in the East.

On entering service in 2019, she was the largest electric ferry in the world. She operates the 22 NM route between the islands of √Ür√∏ and Als in Southern Denmark. ==History== Ellen was developed under E-Ferry, an EU-backed project costing EUR 21.3 million. Although this is around 40% more expensive than a conventional vessel, operating costs are 75% lower. She was the world's largest all- electric ferry in 2019, superseding the , which operates between Denmark and Sweden. It is expected that she will save the release of 2,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. The ferry was built by S√∏by V√¶rft A/S, with sections fabricated in Szczecin, Poland. In September 2016, 22 sections were welded together and the hull was towed to S√∏by on √Ür√∏ for outfitting. ==Layout== Ellen can carry 30 vehicles and 200 passengers. She was designed to minimise weight. Her passenger areas are on the same level as the open car deck. She does not have ramps, instead using those on shore. The hull is steel but the bridge is made of aluminum. Deck furniture is made from recycled paper rather than wood, giving the ferry a total weight of 650 tonnes. Ellens batteries were developed by Leclanch√© of Switzerland and are reported to be Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide . They are split between two battery rooms below deck and have a capacity of 4.3 MWh, larger than any other electric vessel. She is one of the first such vessels to have no emergency generator. A charging arm on the shore ramp moves with the tide and allows battery recharging while loading. ==Service== Ellen was built to operate the 22 nautical miles between the islands of √Ür√∏ and Als in Southern Denmark.

He is a Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Riverside. He is a Latin Americanist widely known for his research and writings on political repression, civil-military relations, defense and security. Pion-Berlin's work is focused in the area of Latin American politics, civil military relations, security and defense, political violence and human rights. In the area of International Relations, his work has dealt with the topics of regional security and international influences on Latin America. He has written over 100 articles, reviews, and books, including Soldiers, Politicians, and Civilians: Reforming Civil-Military Relations in Latin America (2017), which earned two best book awards in 2019, and Military Missions in Democratic Latin America (2016). Pion-Berlin is the recipient of the 2019 Alfred Stepan Lifetime Achievement Award in Defense, Public Security and Democracy by the Latin American Studies Association, for his contributions to the study of civil military relations. In recognition for his pedagogical work, he received the University of California, Riverside Dissertation Mentoring Award in 2016. He is a Fulbright Scholar and has received grants from the National Science Foundation, The American Philosophical Society, and the Ford Foundation. == Education == Pion-Berlin received a B.A. from Colgate University in 1974 followed by an M.A. from University of Denver in 1981. He then received his Ph.D. at the Graduate School of International Studies, University of Denver in 1984. == Career == In 1985, Pion-Berlin joined The Ohio State University as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science. In 1991, he left The Ohio State University and joined the University of California at Riverside as an Associate Professor, becoming Full Professor in 1997. He is an Associate Editor of Armed Forces & Society. == Research and writing == === Political repression === At the beginning of his career, Pion- Berlin's research dealt with the question: why do governments resort to the most severe forms of intimidation and punishment of political opponents when other forms of political control may suffice? Departing from convention that state violence is usually a proportional, tit for tat response to societal violence, he focused on the doctrines and perceptions that guided the military's disproportionate and excessive attacks on its opponents. Threat perceptions, he discovered, were not grounded in objective appraisals of the opposition but rather in skewed preconceptions that derived from security doctrines popular among military regimes during the Cold War era. === Civil- military relations === Following that, Pion-Berlin's research turned to the theme of civil-military relations. As a Fulbright scholar, he conducted numerous and extensive field trips to Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, including interviews with leading political and military figures. Based on his findings, he developed new analytical approaches to the study of how governments and their militaries interact. He found that, in order to know whether politicians or soldiers will prevail when they conflict over policy, one needs to know the characteristics of the agencies that have policy jurisdiction, and whether they create more formidable obstacles for one side than the other. Thus, a key and original finding of his book Through Corridors of Power: Institutions and Civil-Military Relations in Argentina, was that as the design of state institutions differed, so too did the civil-military balance of power. During this period, an important, related topic of research included the nature of military autonomy. His work on this subject has influenced other scholars in coming to realize that military power is neither uniform nor absolute: the armed forces exert greater control over internal, organizational issues and less control over ostensibly political issues, each with different impacts on civilian control. His edited volume, Civil-Military Relations in Latin America: New Analytical Perspectives brought together work by leading scholars of the armed forces. The book bridged the divide that often separated Latin Americanists from others in the discipline by having contributors adapt some theoretical approaches within the political science literature to the issue of civilian control over the armed forces. Pion-Berlin's thematic emphasis then turned to an assortment of civil-military topics: defense organization, informal civil-military interactions, military responses to civilian uprisings, deficits in civilian attention to defense topics, and military missions. These resulted in numerous articles and chapters. His book, Military Missions in Democratic Latin America, culminated a long-term research project on whether the armed forces could be usefully deployed in domestic, non- traditional missions, both lethal and non-lethal. He found that when tasked with missions that draw on pre-existing organizational strengths, Latin American militaries can sometimes be utilized in appropriate and humane ways. As conservative institutions resistant to change, they are at a disadvantage when forced to reinvent themselves. This was the first book written in any language that analyzed Latin American military missions cross-nationally. Later in his career, Pion-Berlin refocused attention on the three-sided nature of civil-military relations: soldiers, politicians, and civilians within society. In the book Soldiers, Politicians and Civilians: Reforming Civil- Military Relations in Democratic Latin America, he and his co-author, Rafael Mart√≠nez, devised a novel framework and measurement tools to assess what progress if any had been made in improving civil-military relations in four Latin American countries. Pion-Berlin's most recent research has focused on two themes. The first is the role of the defense ministry in asserting greater civilian control and military effectiveness. Pion-Berlin and his associates have been exploring the reasons why some well-developed democracies have failed to adequately build up their defense ministries. The second research theme has to do with the deployment of the armed forces in Latin America for internal public security missions, and how governments and the military try to balance concerns with civilian control and human rights. == Awards and honors == *1984-1985 -Western Political Science Association Award for Best Doctoral Dissertation in Region *1985 - Gabriel A.

Hoebel studying the regulation of alcohol intake by dietary fat and fat-stimulated neuropeptides. In 2006, Barson obtained her Master of Arts in Psychology and Neuroscience, and then in 2009, Barson obtained her PhD in Psychology and Neuroscience. Following her graduate training, Barson moved to New York City to complete her postdoctoral research training at The Rockefeller University in Behavioral Neurobiology in 2009. Barson worked under the mentorship of Sarah Fryer Leibowitz continuing to study the role of opioids and orexin in ethanol consumption and feeding. Barson completed her postdoctoral studies in 2014. === Alcohol Consumption and Dietary Fat Intake === During graduate school, Barson explored the relationship between alcohol consumption and fat metabolism to understand how the mechanisms that control reward or food intake may also regulate alcohol consumption. There exists a positive behavioral feedback loop with fat consumption such that fat intake leads to increased consummatory behavior due to orexin and opioid release in the brain. In her work, Barson probed the mechanisms of this positive feedback loop at play during alcohol consumption. She found that ethanol could substitute for fat in this positive feedback loop that decreasing circulating lipid levels leads to decreased ethanol intake. Barson explored this fascinating interconnectivity between fat and ethanol metabolism and their impacts on behavior. Barson found that ethanol increases the same fat- stimulated neuropeptides, orexin and opioids, in the brain and the more ethanol they voluntarily consume, the higher the expression level of these neuropeptides. Further she found that decreases in ethanol consumption, decrease expression of orexin. Probing the effects of opioids on consummatory behavior, Barson injected opioids into brain regions involved in feeding and reward and found increases in alcohol consumption and increases in dopaminergic release in the nucleus accumbens, typically involved in reward behavior. Barson's work highlighted novel mechanisms driving alcohol intake which create future opportunities for development of targeted strategies to prevent alcohol abuse. In Barson's first author paper published in the journal Alcohol, Barson shows a strategy to intervene the vicious cycle between fat and alcohol, where consumption of the two synergistically act to drive brain processes that drive further consumption. Since both fat and alcohol appear to increase blood triglyceride levels, Barson administered a triglyceride lowering drug called Gemfibrozil which caused a significant reduction in orexigenic peptide and reduced ethanol intake. === Neural Basis of Feeding and Reward === During her postdoctoral studies at Rockefeller, Barson continued to follow up on her graduate work, exploring mechanistically the regulation of neuropeptides in the regulation of addiction and food consumption. Since previous studies showed that, just like the opioid enkephalin, galanin and orexin are also stimulated by dietary fats. Following up on this knowledge, Barson and her team explored which areas of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) are specifically stimulated by high fat diets as well as exploring whether the ligands or receptors for galanin and orexin are over- expressed in these areas. Interestingly, Barson found strong overlap in galanin expressing cells and enkephalin expressing cells in the medial PVN of rats fed a high fat diet but not rats fed normal chow. Further, they found the same pattern in co-expression of orexin receptor 2 and enkephalin after high fat diet in a region immediately posterior to the medial PVN. These findings show how non-opioid peptides might be interacting with opioid signalling in high fat diets to mediate increased consummatory behavior. In addition to her work exploring the neurochemical mechanisms of consummatory behavior, Barson also explored how individual variability can account for differences in consummatory behavior. Since alcoholism, and other addictive disorders, show significant variability in both propensity towards addiction and effects of treatments, it is essential to probe the underlying biology of these differences in order to better treat addiction in the fashion of personalized medicine. They first identified subgroups of ethanol naive rats based on two measures known to predispose individuals to high ethanol consumption; high novelty-induced activity and high-fat-induced triglycerides. Barson and her colleagues then trained them to drink ethanol and observed that high activity rats had both increased alcohol intake as well as increased levels of galanin and enkephalin in the PVN as well as increased orexin in the perifornical lateral hypothalamus (PFLH). In the high triglyceride rats, they greater expression in the PVN but reduced orexin in the PFLH showing that while the two predicted high ethanol consumption groups exhibited high alcohol consumption, the endogenous peptide and drug responses markedly differed. == Career and research == Barson worked for one year as a research associate in the lab of Leibowitz, but by 2015 Barson was recruited to Drexel University College of Medicine to become an assistant professor and start her own lab in the Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy. Barson was simultaneously promoted to Adjunct Faculty at The Rockefeller University in 2015, a position she held until 2017 while starting her lab at Drexel. At Drexel, Barson's research program is centered around studying the neural basis of addiction, with a focus on neuropeptidergic actions within the limbic system and their specific role in alcohol disorder and binge eating disorder. In addition to conducting research and teaching, Barson is an editor for Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience, Frontiers in Neuroscience, and previously Frontiers in Psychology. She is also a guest editor for Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience and Brain Research. === Paraventricular Nucleus of the Thalamus and Consummatory Behavior === The Paraventricular Nucleus of the Thalamus (PVT) is a markedly understudied brain region found to be implicated in hedonic feeding behavior. Barson became interested in exploring the role of this region in drug and ethanol consumption due to the orexin projections it receives from the hypothalamus and its high level of orexin receptor expression. When rats consumed alcohol, Barson found increases in anterior PVT neuron activity, as indicated by immediate early gene c-Fos immunolabeling. These same cells also showed increased expression of oxytocin receptor 2 and when orexin receptor 2 was inhibited in the anterior PVT they saw decreased ethanol consumption, and this was not seen with inhibition of orexin receptor 1. These results highlighted a highly specific anatomical and molecular substrate for ethanol intake; orexin receptor 2 signalling in the anterior PVT. Since the PVT appeared to play a role in alcohol consumption behavior, Barson was interested in exploring the role of this area in emotional processing. They found that overall the anterior PVT was implicated in locomotion, but it appeared to have an enhanced role in novelty-induced activity and anxiety-like behavior, implicating its role in the emotional response to stressful stimuli. Barson and her colleagues then started exploring the relationship between behavioral predictors of high ethanol consumption and neurotensin (NT) levels in the PVT. They found that rats exhibiting high levels of rearing, were high ethanol consumers, and had lower levels of NT in the posterior PVT compared to rats with moderate levels of rearing. Further, they showed that NTS appeared to be low in prone rats, and alcohol consumption did not change NTS levels compared to non-prone rats implicating NTS in mediating high alcohol drinking behavior. To causally probe this hypothesis, they injected NTS into the posterior PVT and found decreases in ethanol drinking as well as decreases in rearing. Their findings directly support the idea that low levels of NTS in the posterior PVT support excessive alcohol consumption. Recently, the Barson lab implicated pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and its protein isoform, PACAP-27, in regulation of alcohol consumption in the PVT. Alcohol drinking led to an increase in PACAP expression, specifically in the posterior portion of the PVT. Barson's findings have highlighted another way in which the PVT may function in the pathogenesis of alcohol consummtive behaviors. === Science Communication and Advocacy === In addition to her laboratory investigation, Barson is dedicated to science communication and advocacy. Her work has been brought to public attention via LiveScience and the Inquirer, where she describes how her findings lead to an increased understanding of the connection between alcohol consumption and binge eating as well as alcohol consumption and the reliability of memory. Further, Barson participates in local science communication initiatives such as the Taste of Science, where she speaks about her work to the public, educating them on why we might choose unhealthy options to snack on after binge drinking as opposed to healthy options. Barson is also actively involved in advocating for gender equity in academia. As a member of the Society for Neuroscience and as a mother in science, Barson was invited to speak at the ‚ÄúFixing the Leaky Pipeline for Women in Science‚Äù annual meeting discussing the issues facing new mothers in academia. == Awards and honors == * 2019 Mentoring Award, Faculty Department of Neurobiology & Anatomy * 2019 Early Career Women Faculty Leadership Development Seminar (EWIS) AAMC * 2018 Commonwealth Universal Research Enhancement (CURE) formula grant program * 2012 NIH Pathway to Independence (PI) Award (K99/R00) NIAAA * 2012 Research Society on Alcoholism Junior Investigator Award NIAAA * 2006/7 Psychology Department Award for Excellence in Teaching ‚Äì Princeton University == Select publications == * Pandey S, Badve PS, Curtis GR, Leibowitz SF & Barson JR (2019).

Midway through the first round, Hearns had opened up a cut above Barkley's left eye, and by the end of the second Barkley had a cut above both his right eye and lower lip. In round three, Barkley got off to a quick start, but Hearns took control and hammered Barkley with body shots throughout the round. However, in the final minute of the round, Hearns threw a left jab and then briefly dropped his hands as he attempted to move to his left when Barkley caught him flush with a powerful right hand and then landed another as Hearns fell to the canvas.

He made his debut in March 2017 and reached the top makuuchi division in November 2019. He wrestles for Arashio stable, where he is a stable mate of his older brothers Wakatakamoto and Wakamotoharu. His highest rank has been maegashira 8. ==Family background== The three Onami brothers are the grandchildren of former komusubi Wakabayama. They were given their shikona or sumo names by Arashio stable's head coach ≈åyutaka, after the three sons of M≈çri Motonari in the well-known Japanese parable \\"Lesson of the three arrows\\" ‚Äì Takamoto, Motoharu, and Takakage. The eldest brother, Wakatakamoto, has a highest rank of makushita 7 and has been in sumo the longest, debuting in November 2009. Wakatakakage and are the 19th pair of brothers in sumo to both reach sekitori level. Wakamotoharu is the second eldest and entered in November 2011, but did not make his j≈´ry≈ç debut until after Wakatakakage, in March 2019. On the May 2020 banzuke he reached his highest rank to date, maegashira 8. Wakatakakage, the youngest brother, has had by far the quickest rise up the rankings of the three. ==Career== He made his professional debut in March 2017, and because of his success in amateur sumo began as a sandanme tsukedashi entrant. He won the sandanme division championship in May 2017 with a perfect 7‚Äì0 record and also won the makushita division championship in January 2018 by the same score. He made his j≈´ry≈ç debut in May 2018, the second to do from Arashio stable after Sokokurai in 2010 and the first from Fukushima Prefecture since Sotairyu in 2009. He rose slowly up the j≈´ry≈ç division, winning promotion to the top makuuchi division after a 9‚Äì6 record at j≈´ry≈ç 3 in September 2019. Despite a poor 2‚Äì6 start to that tournament he won his final seven matches (including wins over top division veterans such as Toyonoshima and Kaisei) to secure his promotion. He was the third sandanme tsukedashi entrant to reach the top division after Yutakayama and Asanoyama. Wakatakakage won his first four bouts in his top division debut in November 2019, but dislocated a joint in his right foot after landing awkwardly during his fourth day win over Terutsuyoshi and had to withdraw from the rest of the tournament. Back in j≈´ry≈ç he put together two consecutive winning records of 9‚Äì6 and 10‚Äì5 upon his return from injury to earn promotion back the top division for the (subsequently cancelled) May 2020 tournament at his highest rank to date of maegashira 14. In July 2020 he completed his first full tournament in makuuchi, posting a respectable 10 wins. In September he was on the leaderboard for much of the tournament, although he picked up his fourth loss to Mitakeumi on Day 14 and finished in a share of third place on 11‚Äì4. ==Fighting style== According to his Japan Sumo Association profile Wakatakakage prefers a migi-yotsu (right hand inside, left hand outside) grip on his opponent's mawashi. His most common winning kimarite are oshi-dashi (push out), yori-kiri (force out) and okuri-dashi (push out from behind). He is below the average weight for a sekitori at and makes use of his speed and agility. ==Career record== ==See also== *List of active sumo wrestlers *Glossary of sumo terms ==References== ==External links== * Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Fukushima Prefecture ","title":"Wakatakakage Atsushi"},{"id":"63793493","text":"Tegocassis is a genus of beetles that belongs to the family of leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae).https://www.biolib.cz/en/taxontree/id802992/ == Appearance== A medium-sized, broadly oval, glossy, yellow-brown (at least in dead specimens) Cassidinae. Seen from the side, the body is conical. The antennae are filamentous and medium length. The body is actually quite normally proportioned, with the pronotum and the wings being slightly extended to the sides so that they completely cover the upper side, both the head and legs are hidden under this shield. When grown, the body shape becomes broadly oval. The pronotum is rounded, the wings slightly protruding. The edges of the pronotum and the cover wings form an almost continuous curve. The top is very finely punctured. == Life cycle == Both the larvae and the adult (imago) beetles live by eating leaves on nearby plants. The adult (imago) sits close to the plant and the large flat neck shield and cover wings make the beetle very difficult to detect and it is difficult for predators to reach the vulnerable underside. The larvae tend to hide under a roof of old feces and plant remains that are attached to the forward bent hindquarters. == Coverage == The species is very common in Cameroon, Tanzania and Madagascar. == Systematic classification == The systematic position of the group of shield beetles is unclear, and it has traditionally been regarded as a subfamily of leaf beetles, as in this overview. However, some place it as a tribe in the subgroup Hispinae, which has traditionally been regarded as a sister group to the shields, or conversely, Hispinae is placed as a subgroup (then called Hispini) of the shields.https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search;_value=838026#null * Order beetles (Coleoptera) ** suborder Polyphaga *** superfamily Chrysomeloidea Latreille, 1802 (=Phytophaga) **** family leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae Latreille, 1802) ***** sub-family Cassidinae, Stephens, 1831 ****** tribe Cassidini Gyllenhal, 1813 ‚Äì only group represented in Europe ******* genus Tegocassis Spaeth, 1924 ******** Tegocassis corpulenta (Weise, 1904)http://www.cassidae.uni.wroc.pl/katalog%20internetowy//tegocassis.htm == References == == Literature == * Borowiec, L. 1999.

Petcho was a scion of Azaria Piccio from Venice. == Biography == Jewish Agency envoy in Cordoba, Argentina, after a flight from Buenos Aires, 1966 Petcho was born in Izmir, Turkey, to Eliyahu Petcho and Zimbol (Aviva) of Coriel's house. He graduated from St. Joseph's French high school in Turkey where Jews, Muslims, and Christians studied, following Atat√ºrk's reforms. According to Haim Shikiar, a friend of Petcho from Turkey who worked as a clerk at the Israel Discount Bank, Petcho excelled in Mathematics, skipped a grade, and did not let Gentiles harass Jews at the school. In 1934, he visited the Land of Israel for the first time and returned to Izmir. In 1935, when he found out that the British had restricted the issuance of certificates (visas), he purchased a tourist visa, left his family and went alone to Palestine. After immigrating, he destroyed his passport, became \\"illegal\\" and then moved to Jerusalem. For a living, he worked in the Jewish Agency for Israel and also as a cover for his activities in the resistance movement of the Irgun. His work colleague, Haim Ezer, also from Izmir, introduced him to the Irgun. In the Irgun, he served under the command of a graduate of the Rabbi Center Yeshiva and later the Irgun commander, David Raziel. In the , he was a commander in the opening trio of the youth headquarters, along with Rabbi Moshe Segal, who \\"blew the shofar\\" at the Western Wall and was the spiritual shepherd, , the statesman, when Petcho's role was the military organization. Petcho liked order and discipline, was responsible for the arrangements and ceremonies, excelled in diligence, organization, creativity, war tricks, classifying active squads, and adhering to tasks. His subordinates did not know the real names of their squad members nor the corresponding squads. Petcho steadfastly refused to be photographed. As a result, every time the British intelligence published photos of wanted persons on the billboards with their names under the pictures, in the case of Petcho a blank square appeared. On July 16, 1939, during his underground activity, he was arrested in broad daylight on King George Street in Jerusalem, but he managed to smuggle a note on his arrest into one of the stores which assisted the organization without the detectives and police officers noticing. Following the arrest by the detective, he was required to cooperate and to provide the names of his members in the Irgun but he refused to cooperate. As a result, he was tortured severely which did not exist even during the Turkish rule but he did not reveal information. Segal, who was also detained, heard from Petcho about the torture, and recorded his comments on the kosher napkin which he got from his wife. The napkin was forwarded to Aryeh Altman, who sent a report to Ze'ev Jabotinsky. Jabotinsky communicated this to the British parliament's deputy Josiah Wedgwood, who submitted an urgent query in the parliament, a few days before the outbreak of the World War II. At the same time, a complaint was filed with the Geneva Mandate Committee, and the British Mandate was reprimanded. When the torture of other members was revealed, the British Mandate got a disgrace mark. On August 24, 1939, Petcho was taken out of the dungeon in Jerusalem and was put in detention at Latrun Prison with Raziel, Meridor and Avraham Stern. After the Irgun's attack on Jaffa, in which Petcho participated, he made his way to Jerusalem on Burma Road and joined the Irgun fighters in Jerusalem who were fighting for the liberation of the Old City. In 1949, he was recruited into the IDF, and due to his gundar rank, he joined an officers' course. During the Suez Crisis he was drafted to the military reserve force, and was released from the IDF afterward. In August 1959 Petcho was appointed to the Composition Committee for the list of candidates of the Herut Movement for the Tel Aviv- Yafo Municipality. In January‚ÄìFebruary 1964, Petcho received a certificate of being a prisoner of Zion for his imprisonment for six months in Jerusalem and Tzrifin, with the signatures of Menachem Begin, Eitan Livni, chairman of the Irgun Alliance in Israel, and Yehuda Borochov, a member of Medals and Awards Committee. From the Deputy Minister of Defense, Mordechai Tzipori, he received the campaign medal of the Irgun. Petcho knew Hebrew, Ladino, French and English. Duvdevani, as the director of the Jewish Agency Immigration Department, appointed him as an immigration emissary in Argentina from June 1965 until August 1967. During his mission, Petcho also made diplomatic connections with Uruguay where his cousin Jak Petcho, president of the Spanish Jewish community, lived in Montevideo. Petcho's neighbor who lived in the building at Avenida Medrano in Buenos Aires was a Syrian Jew, Dr. Solomon Halac. Dr. Halac was a senior orthopedic physician through whom Petcho held conferences and home classes for Jewish physicians. Petcho encouraged them to immigrate to Israel where there was a great demand for doctors, especially orthopedic doctors, due to war injuries. In 1951, he married Joya (Judith) of Poppens house in Turkey. He left four descendants. == References == Category:1916 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Irgun members Category:Jews in Mandatory Palestine Category:Turkish Jews Category:Turkish emigrants to Mandatory Palestine Category:People from ƒ∞zmir Category:Herut politicians ","title":"Mordechai Petcho"},{"id":"63793664","text":"Antanimora Prison, also known as Central Prison of Antanimora, officially Maison Centrale Antanimora - Antanarivo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACfKHjUmg_o 3 min 55 s is a prison in Antanimora, Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar.

As an immunomodulatory, it modulates the immune system of the body and hence significantly reduces mortality rate in patients with gram negative sepsis. Sepsivac is a drug developed by CSIR and Cadila Pharmaceuticals under New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative (NMITLI) programme. __TOC__ == Mechanism == In patients with sepsis, in response to an infection, a lot of pro-inflammatory and anti- inflammatory cytokines are generated in the body. However, some of the cytokines also cause inflammation in the organs of the body, which might be harmful. Immunomodulator drugs such as Sepsivac regulate this host immune response. Sepsivac is found to be safe in patients with no systematic side- effects. It can be used in combination with other treatments to manage a patient in critical care setting. == Sepsivac and COVID-19 == Scientists at CSIR found similarities between the clinical characteristics of patients suffering from gram-negative sepsis and COVID-19. In association with Cadila Pharmaceuticals, the researchers are now working on initiating a randomised, blinded, controlled clinical trial to evaluate Sepsivac's efficacy to reduce mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

She served as a secretary at the Today newspaper and then became a presenter for a short while on a children's television show related to fashion on TV-am. Jordan's next job was to book guests for The Word, a Channel 4 show. Since she did an excellent job in that role, shows hosted by Clive Anderson and Ruby Wax also gave her jobs to do. Jordan also worked for Network 7 and Moviewatch. When Jordan was 27, the Late Show with David Letterman visited London for filming and requested to be put into touch with those who had the strongest networks. Jordan was mentioned, and the show asked her to relocate to the United States.

When Jordan told the Late Show with David Letterman executives of her plans to start her own company, the show offered to be CTB's first customer, which Jordan accepted. Central Talent Booking's office initially was Jordan's Little Italy, Manhattan, apartment at the intersection of Mulberry Street and Canal Street. By 2005, CTB grew to 20 bookers working full-time‚Äî16 women and four men‚Äîand had expanded to offices in Los Angeles, New York and London.

Robert Burns was introduced to the club by William Smellie, while setting the Edinburgh edition of Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (Edinburgh Edition) in his shop in the same close. The songs in the collection were intended to be performed in a \\"convivial\\" atmosphere. Discussion as to the provenance and compilation of the original text is ongoing. The original printer is unknown, but is agreed that it was first intended for the use of the Crochallan Fencibles. It has been suggested that the printer may have been Alexander Smellie, the son of Burns's friend and founder Crochallan Fencible William Smellie (1740-95), or another fencible, Peter Hill. It was published three years after the death of Burns, in 1799, and was not attributed to him. The original manuscript is no longer extant. Two copies of the original are supposed to be extant. One is often named the 'Rosebery copy', and the other is in the G. Ross Roy Collection of Burnsiana & Scottish Literature at the University of South Carolina. The former was, by 1959, in the collection of Harry Primrose, 6th Earl of Rosebery. It is damaged and has no printing date on the title page, although examination of the paper's Watermark has indicated a printing date of 1799. A microform copy is available in the National Library of Scotland. The latter is the only one with a complete title page, containing the following epigraph. > Say, Puritan, ca it be wrong, To dress plain truth in witty song? What > honest Nature says, we should do; What every lady does, - or would do. == Editions == The text has gone through a number of editions, which vary in their content. The edition printed after the initial publication was printed in Dublin, around 1804. It was entitled The merry muses : a choice collection of favourite songs. The \\"Giblet Pye\\" collection, printed in 1806, contained songs and poems from The Merry Muses as well as other ballads. in 1823, The Songs and Ballads of Robert Burns, including Ten never before published, with a Preliminary Discourse and Illustrative Prefaces was printed in London, containing ten songs from The Merry Muses. The '1827' is said to have been published in 1872 for John Hotten in London, with the numerals of the publication date reversed, which may have been done deliberately to confuse censors. In 1911 an edition was printed by the Burns Federation. The title page reads: The Merry Muses of Caledonia; A Collection of Favourite Scots Songs Ancient and Modern; Selected for Use of the Crochallan Fencibles. It also includes an essay, entitled A Vindication of Robert Burns in connection with the above publication and the spurious editions which succeeded it.. This edition had a moral tone, and intended to challenge the collection's notoriety, and its identification as pornography. It also attempted to identify the authorship of some of the poems. A further edition of the poems was published in 1959, the title page reading: edited by James Barke and Sydney Goodsir Smith, with a Prefatory Note and some authentic Burns Texts contributed by John DeLancey Ferguson. Like the 1911 edition, this one contextualised the poems. The Merry Muses was intended to be accompanied by music, and this 1959 edition was intended to include music. Unfortunately, it was left incomplete owing to the death of Barke. A 1965 edition: The Merry Muses of Caledonia. Collected and in part written by Robert Burns was edited by G Legman. In 2009, Luath Press published an edition with an additional essay by Valentina Bold and illustrations by satirist Bob Dewar. == Performance == * Ewan MacColl Songs from Robert Burns's Merry Muses of Caledonia.

From 1997 to 2001 she studied at the Zurich University of the Arts and at the Berlin University of the Arts. Since 2015, she has been a Professor at the Berlin University of the Arts. == Work == Streuli became known for her large-format, colorful and ornamental paintings which were often described as colour manifestos, inspired by the most diverse cultural sources, which the artist combines to form a dense cosmos. Her paintings are composed of several layers, whereby the artist makes use of the most diverse painting techniques. Streuli rarely works with the brush; rather, she sprinkles, pours or sprays paint onto her canvases and combines a variety of printing techniques. She uses rakes, stencils, scratches or other objects. Often she chooses a garish, almost excessive colourfulness. Her works are usually characterized by room-filling stagings in which the painting radiates beyond the edges of canvases and extends over the walls, floor and ceiling. Streuli's works have been exhibited worldwide, including the Venice Biennale in 2007. and the Biennale of Sydney in 2014 Her work has been shown in solo exhibitions in art museums including Aargauer Kunsthaus, Kunsthaus Langenthal, Kunstmuseum Luzern, Kunstmuseum Bonn, the Haus am Waldsee in Berlin and in the Berlinischen Galerie.

Early supporters included the suffragettes Etheldred Browning and Geraldine Lennox of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), Lady Rhondda, and Ray Strachey. They incorporated Women's Pioneer Housing as a public utility company on 4 October 1920 ‚Äòto cater for the housing requirements of professional and other women of moderate means who require individual homes at moderate rents‚Äô. Other supporters included Lily Carre, Helen Archdale, Sydney Bushell, Dorothy Peel, Agnes Miall, Annabel Dott, and Mabel Bruce. They raised money to purchase its first property, 167 Holland Park Avenue, in 1921. By 1936 they had 36 properties, primarily in west London and one in Brighton, run on a co-operative basis. Women's Pioneer Housing employed women including the architect Gertrude Leverkus and the first woman chartered accountants, Ethel Watts and Miriam Homesham. Etheldred Browning ran the organisation until her retirement in 1938. ==Housing provision== Women's Pioneer Housing is still active as a social housing provider for women, with offices at Wood Lane, White City, west London. The Chief Executive since is Denise Fowler, formerly the Government's Housing Ombudsman. It is registered as a Co-operative & Community Benefit Society with the Financial Conduct Authority and as a Registered Social Landlord with the Homes and Communities Agency. It continues to house single women, nominated by local authorities. There are plans for a new housing development at the organisation's base in Wood Lane. As of 2019, it was exploring a possible merger with Housing for Women. ==References== Category:Housing associations Category:1920 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Organizations established in 1920 Category:Feminist organisations in the United Kingdom Category:First-wave feminism Category:Women's organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Social history of the United Kingdom Category:Suffragettes ","title":"Women's Pioneer Housing"},{"id":"63794174","text":"Sergey Mukhin (born 28 October 1950) is a Soviet equestrian.

It is a prodrug of the synthetic nucleoside derivative N4-hydroxycytidine, and exerts its antiviral action through introduction of copying errors during viral RNA replication. Activity has also been demonstrated against coronaviruses including SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2. The drug was developed at Emory University by the university's drug innovation company, DRIVE. It was then acquired by Miami-based company Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, who later partnered with Merck & Co. to develop the drug further. It was renamed by Merck in July 2020. == Safety Controversy == In April 2020, a whistleblower complaint by former Head of US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) Rick Bright suggested he had been removed from his position over raising concerns over providing funding for the further development of MK-4482 due to similar drugs having mutagenic properties (producing birth defects). A previous company, Pharmasset, that had investigated the drug's active ingredient had abandoned it. These claims were denied by George Painter, CEO of Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory (DRIVE), noting that toxicity studies on MK-4482 had been carried out and data provided to regulators in the US and UK, who permitted safety studies in humans to move forward in the spring of 2020. Also at this time, DRIVE and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics stated they planned future safety studies in animals. == COVID-19 == After being found to be active against SARS-CoV-2 in March 2020, MK-4482 was tested in a preliminary human study for \\"Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics\\" in healthy volunteers in the UK and US. In June 2020, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics announced it was moving to Phase II trials to test the efficacy of the drug as a treatment for COVID-19.. Two trials of small numbers of hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients in the US and the UK were underway in July.

He was raised in Sint-Denijs-Westrem, a village near Ghent that was governed by his father, the liberal mayor of the township between 1970 and 1976. Growing up in a bourgeois family, the artist spoke both French and Dutch at home. Revolting against his family background, he changed his name to Vandenberg in 1982. At a young age he started to draw on a daily basis. When visiting the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent as a teenager, the paintings by 16th to 20th century masters made a lasting impression. Between 1970 and 1972, Vandenberg studied literature and art history at the Ghent University, before enrolling full-time at the Royal Academy of Art of Ghent in 1972. A year before graduating in 1976, Vandenberg married V√©ronique D‚ÄôHeygere, who became his favourite model for painterly depictions of the female nude. Their daughter H√©l√®ne was born in 1977, their son Guillaume followed one year later. Several months thereafter, Vandenberg moved in with Mieja D‚ÄôHondt. During a trip to New York in 1978, he discovered the paintings of Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Marc Rothko. The following years he visited Rembrandt‚Äôs The Night Watch in the Rijksmuseum and the works of Francisco Goya and El Greco in the Prado. ===1981‚Äì1990: Neo-expressionism and the turn to the political=== The renewal of interest in painting at the beginning of the 1980s, which coincided with the emergence of the Neue Wilde in Germany and the Transavanguardia in Italy, brought Vandenberg‚Äôs work into the spotlight. In Picturaal I at the International Cultural Centre (ICC) in Antwerp (1981), a group exhibition of work by emerging Belgian painters, he showed a series of figurative Kruisigingen (Crucifixions). For these works he was awarded the Prix Emile Langui for painting at the Prix Jeune Peinture Belge that same year, leading to a one-year residency in the Cit√© Internationale des Arts in Paris. In 1982, Vandenberg radically re-evaluated his work. Inspired by the dramatic passion of the Old Masters and the sense of space in the work of the Abstract Expressionists, he made his so-called Splinter Paintings. For these canvases, he deconstructed the human figure in his crucifixions into black and white shapes that he arranged in rhythmical grids. His works of the subsequent years are activated by a fierce stroke of the brush and swing between expressionist figuration and abstraction. The cycle De Geboorte (Birth), painted following the birth of Mo, his son with Mieja, was exhibited in the Richard Foncke Gallery in Ghent in 1983. It marked the start of a collaboration that would last for two decades. A 1986 solo show in New York at the Denise Cad√© Gallery led to the acquisition of a painting by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. In 1988 Vandenberg traveled to Southwest America. He had exhibitions in France, The United States, and The Netherlands, and his paintings were highly sought after by collectors. Despite his growing success, he felt oppressed by the art market and the opportunistic stance of certain critics. He began to use motifs derived from graffiti art, as well as images distilled from comic books. In 1989, he introduced references to world politics into his work, such as swastikas, portraits of political or religious leaders, and men carrying dollar bills. Collectors failed to grasp the sudden turnabout in his oeuvre, a feeling shared by several critics, who fiercely rejected the works. ===1991‚Äì2000: Building an individual iconography === In the early 1990s, Vandenberg travelled around Europe. He visited the cathedrals of Chartres and V√©zelay and went back to Toledo to see the works of El Greco in 1994. The influence of Christian iconography became increasingly visible in his work from this period, with the Book of Job and the Book of Revelation as important sources for the series of drawings he focused on in the mid- nineties. Concurrent with his experiments in poetry, writing was granted an autonomous role within his creative practice. In 1995, Het zevende zegel (The Seventh Seal), one of his first large-scale ensembles, was shown in JOB XIII, 12, an exhibition curated by Jan Hoet for the Museum of Contemporary Art (S.M.A.K.) in Ghent. It marked the reconciliation between the artist and the curator, after the latter had publicly disavowed his work in 1989. Also in 1995, two radical gestures intersect his oeuvre: Vandenberg overpainted older works with layers of black paint, known as his Grandes noires (Large Blacks), and employed his own blood for a series of drawings. Furthermore, his many lectures of that period herald the start of a series of essays in which he reflects on his art and artistry. This lecture was later published as This lecture was later published as In the mid-nineties, Vandenberg often resided in Marseille and travelled to Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, and Cuba. The religious and cultural practices of these countries were processed in numerous sketchbooks, taking up an important place in his oeuvre. Inspired by the crucial interventions of 1995, he also started to work on larger ensembles. Le Cannibal en Larmes (The Cannibal in Tears), a series of blood drawings, was succeeded by L'esprit est voyageur, l‚Äô√¢me est vagabonde (The Spirit Is a Traveller, The Soul Is a Vagabond). In the latter ensemble, which was first shown at Albert Baronian in 1997, he combined word paintings with panels populated by fairy-tale characters and Old Testament figures. In 1999, Vandenberg had first retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Antwerp (M HKA). ===2000‚Äì2009: Geometry, words and figuration=== After his M HKA show Vandenberg frequently resided in Paris, where he drew and wrote, and devoured films in the local cinemas. In 2000, he returned to The Royal Academy of Ghent to take up a one-year teaching position. Suffering from depression and substance abuse, he was confined to hospital in 2001. The same year he completed a series of portraits that he had originally started in 1999. These include depictions of Ulrike Meinhof, a leader of the Red Army Faction, the writer and dramatist Antonin Artaud, and a number of self-portraits. At the same time, he painted the cycles L‚ÄôEnnemi Int√©rieur (The Enemy Inside), In Memoriam Ulrike Meinhof and √âtude pour Artaud (Study for Artaud), which depict the subjects of these paintings being violently attacked. Throughout the years following, increasingly recurring symbols such as the cross and the swastika were combined in geometric compositions. An example is the series of etchings entitled Exil De Peintre (The Painter‚Äôs Exile), which he published as a book and presented in an exhibition of the same name at the Caermersklooster in Ghent in 2003. When leaving Ghent for Brussels in 2005, Vandenberg bought a studio in Molenbeek. Another monochromic phase was preluded when he started to overpaint works in grey, orange and yellow. Letters and words reappeared on these monochrome canvases, like the enigmatic K.A. or the sentence L‚Äôimportant c‚Äôest le kamikaze (The Importance Is the Kamikaze), which was also the title of his 2006 exhibition at the Mus√©e Arthur Rimbaud in Charleville-M√©zi√®res in France. Continuing to work on alternating geometric, figurative and monochrome cycles, these image schemes began to blur together: letters turned into geometrical grids, abstract compositions were intruded by figures, and monochromes served as backgrounds for words. His Molenbeek Drawings from 2007 are key examples of this tendency. In one of the drawings, which Vandenberg mockingly entitled Le Carousel, cuboid forms with legs circle a central figure under the inscription Dieu me l'a dit (God Told Me). This motif served as a starting point for a cycle of large-scale paintings and also appears in the Sint-Jans Suite (Saint John Suite), a series of etchings that he based on his drawings. The artist had his last overseas exhibition at the Envoy Gallery in New York in 2008. In the exhibition Visite, his oeuvre was presented in a dialogue with the permanent collection of the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent. Vandenberg committed suicide in 2009. ==Selected exhibitions== *Campo Santo, Sint-Amandsberg, Philippe Vandenberg: De Kruisigingen 1982‚Äì1993, November 6‚ÄìDecember 5, 1993 *Vlaams Cultureel Centrum De Brakke Grond, Amsterdam, In de verborgenheid van het icoon: Philippe Vandenberg‚ÄìTon Slits, March 10-April 9, 1995 *Museum Dhondt‚ÄìDhaenens, Deurle, Philippe Vandenberg‚ÄîMarkus Oehlen, April 9‚ÄìMay 14, 1995 *MSK‚ÄîMuseum van Hedendaagse Kunst Gent, Ghent, Diptychon I: Philippe Vandenberg (Job XIII, 12), April 4‚ÄìJune 5, 1995 *M HKA‚ÄîMuseum van Hedendaagse Kunst, Antwerp, Philippe Vandenberg: ≈íuvre 1995‚Äì1999, December 11, 1999‚ÄìFebruary 6, 2000 *Museum Dr. Guislain, Ghent, Philippe Vandenberg: Pelgrims Keel, June 21‚ÄìSeptember 14, 2003 *Caermersklooster‚ÄîProvinciaal Centrum voor Kunst en Cultuur, Ghent, Philippe Vandenberg: Exil de peintre, December 12, 2003‚Äì January 25, 2004 *Mus√©e Arthur Rimbaud, Charleville- M√©zi√®res, Philippe Vandenberg ‚ÄúL‚Äôimportant c‚Äôest le kamikaze‚Äù: Oeuvre 2000‚Äì2006, July 1‚ÄìSeptember 10, 2006 *Angel Orensanz Foundation, Center for the Arts, New York, Le Point Zero: Philippe Vandenberg, March 27‚ÄìApril 4, 2008 *MSK‚ÄîMuseum voor Schone Kunsten, Gent/Ghent, Artist in Residence‚ÄîPhilippe Vandenberg: ‚ÄúVisite‚Äù, April 12‚ÄìAugust 17, 2008 *De Pont‚ÄîMuseum van Hedendaagse Kunst, Tilburg, Philippe Vandenberg & Berlinde De Bruyckere: Innocence Is Precisely, Never to Avoid the Worst, June 30‚Äì November 25, 2012 *La Maison Rouge‚ÄîFondation Antoine de Galbert, Paris, Philippe Vandenberg & Berlinde De Bruyckere: Il me faut tout oublier, February 13‚ÄìMay 11, 2014 *The Drawing Room, London, Philippe Vandenberg: Crossing the Circle, September 21‚Äì November 13, 2016 *Hamburger Kunsthalle, Hamburg, Philippe Vandenberg.

In this series, mainly B-movies, which are characterized by particularly bad workmanship or unintentionally funny ideas, are introduced, commented and presented by Oliver Kalkofe and Peter R√ºtten. These films themselves are called Schlefaze. In 2013, Kalkofe and fellow comedian Peter R√ºtten created and began hosting the still-running show SchleFaZ (Die schlechtesten Filme aller Zeiten) (\\"The worst movies of all time\\") on Tele 5, which is loosely based on the MST3K format. In it, Kalkofe and R√ºtten present trash films, introduce them with various background information, after every commercial break comment on the plot so far, and in the end summarize upon it, all within a retro-styled studio decorated in reference to the current film they're commenting on. The show has become an instant surprise hit for Tele 5, being the channel's leading show in ratings (with Kalkofe's other show Kalkofes Mattscheibe Rekalked being second), and during broadcasts of the show on Friday nights, the hashtag #schlefaz regularly enters the German Twitter top ten charts, which has prompted German TV Guides and even Tele 5 themselves to adopt the Twitter hashtag as a semi-official name for the show, also used by show hosts Kalkofe and R√ºtten themselves. R√ºtten and Kalkofe made an ironic cameo appearance in the 2015 trash movie Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!. == Start == Oliver Kalkofe, together with Tele-5 station manager Kai Blasberg, developed the concept for the series in 2012. Since the Tele M√ºnchen Gruppe owns a large number of B-movies, e.g. of the production company The Asylum, which had already been broadcast on Tele 5, the idea of presenting them as trash television - in deliberate dissociation from the concepts of other broadcasters - matured. Thus, the title of the programme stands in contrast to the Kabel One slogan \\"The best films of all time\\". The films are presented by the presenters during the broadcast and are provided with biting comments which are then cut in between. == Concept == During the programme, films are presented which, according to the presenters, are considered particularly bad and therefore deserve special attention. One film is presented per programme and is examined in more detail. At the beginning of each episode the viewer is prepared for the film by the presenters. Information about the actors, the director and other facts about the film are presented in a humorous way. In addition, a special cocktail is created or presented for each film, whose composition or name has a reference to the film. In connection with this, a drinking game is usually introduced. For example, the audience of the film Sharknado should drink a cocktail every time a flying shark is seen. During the film, pop-ups are used to provide background information on the respective scene or to remind viewers of the drinking game. After the commercial breaks, the presenters ironically discuss particularly prominent scenes of the film. At the end of the film, what has been seen is summarized and a conclusion is given. As the seasons progress, it has become established that Kalkofe is the incorrigible enthusiast who always gives the films an artistic touch, while R√ºtten plays the constantly pessimistic and disinterested viewer who almost without exception finds the film bad. Yet, the curse \\"Fickende H√∂lle! (\\"Fucking Hell!\\") has established itself as R√ºtten's catchphrase. In 13 German cinemas (as of February 2014) the SchleFaZ series will be shown on the big screen simultaneously with the TV broadcast. The summer episodes of the 3rd season were simultaneously broadcast on Joiz Germany. First films of the series were released on DVD in June 2015. == Airing data == Most of the Drinking Game are word plays and/or rhyme in German and therefore make little or no sense in English.

In the Afrikaans language it is known as ruie-suikerbos. ==Taxonomy== This species appears to be one of the latest to be described as new to science, this by the South African botanist John Patrick Rourke in 1975, however, the species had been known since the early 19th century. Rourke had collected this species in 1974 in the Van Stadensberg Forest Reserve between the villages of Loerie and Otterford, to the west of the city of Port Elizabeth (collector #1410), but it was first discovered by the British plant collector William Burchell in 1813 in the Swartwatersberge (berge = 'mountains') near the village of Riebeek East, and collected by him again the following year on the Van Stadensberg (berg = 'mountain'). The German botanical explorer Johann Franz Dr√®ge collected the species a number of times in the early 1830s. In his 1843 work Zwei pflanzengeographische Documente Dr√®ge used two names to classify these specimens, Protea tenax (this incorrectly, Meissner calls it \\"var. Œ≤\\") and P. magnoliifolia, but this work is only an annotated travel itinerary, and does not include formal species descriptions for any of the new taxa mentioned. Another German botanical explorer, Karl Zeyher, also collected this species around the same time. His specimens were named P. caulescens by Ernst Meyer, apparently on the exsiccata specimen sheets only, and Meyer also did not publish a formal description, resulting in another 'naked' name. These names are thus what is known as nomina nuda. In the botanical book series, the Prodromus, the Swiss taxonomist Carl Meissner subsequently classified Zeyher and Dr√®ge's specimens as belonging to his taxon P. tenax var. latifolia in 1856, synonymising the nomina nuda with the new variety. Meissner ascribes the name in Dr√®ge's 1843 work to , to whom the name is attributed in the index at the back of the book. P. tenax is a prostrate species which occurs in the mountain ranges much further to the west. In 1912 in the Flora Capensis Otto Stapf and Edwin Percy Phillips confused matters further. They maintain the synonymy of Meissner, but strangely classify all of Dr√®ge's specimens as P. tenax var. tenax, and oddly enough classify specimens from other collectors who went to the exact same locations as var. latifolia. They changed the spelling of P. magnoliifolia to magnoliaefolia. ===Types=== Dr√®ge collected his specimens at four locations: what he called P. tenax at moderate elevations on the northern flanks of the Zuurberge and in grassland at low elevations between the villages of Omsamculo and Omtendo (now possibly in the area of Makhanda), and what he called P. magnoliifolia on the eastern flank of the Van Stadensberg (as Vanstaadesberg\\") at reasonably low elevations, and the nearby Galgebosch, a forest at low altitudes. In the preparatory work for the Flora Capensis, Stapf designated a specimen of Dr√®ge stored at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, collected either on the Van Stadensberg itself or in the Galgebosch, and originally identified as P. magnoliifolia, as the holotype of P. tenax var. latifolia. At the same time, his partner in writing Phillips determined the P. magnoliifolia specimen of the same series at Kew to be the nominate P. tenax of Robert Brown. This identification was reiterated by the South African botanist Hedley Brian Rycroft in 1960, although he originally wrote the added \\"var. latifolia\\" to that, before crossing that part out. An isotype of Rourke's 1974 collection is kept at the herbarium at Kew. ===Higher classification=== In 1995 Tony Rebelo classified P. foliosa in his section Crinitae (what he calls the \\"eastern ground sugarbushes\\"). ==Description== === Habitus === It is a rounded shrub reaching up to tall, although the plants growing around Makhanda only become shorter than in height at maximum, and plants are usually . The shrub consists of multiple stems arising from an underground bole or persistent rootstock. These stems are thick (60‚Äì80mm in diameter), glabrous and rarely branch. Being able to survive wildfires, it is a long-lived species. The stems are erect, but the weight of the inflorescences bend them closer to the ground. === Leaves === The mature leaves are glabrescent, and lanceolate to broadly elliptic in shape. === Flowers === The inflorescences are specialised structures called pseudanthia, also known simply as flower heads, containing hundred of reduced flowers, called florets. The flower heads are surrounded by 'involucral bracts'; these bracts are coloured a greenish-cream, and at their apexes are fringed with white or beige-coloured beards of hair. It is monoecious, both sexes occur in each flower. The blooms are produced in the autumn, mostly in May to June, extending from March to September. In this species the leaves below the inflorescence curiously wrap over it, insomuch as to obscure it from sight. It is possible that this is an evolutionary adaptation to accommodate the small mammals it uses to pollinate the florets -the stems being erect, such animals are more susceptible to predation by owls or other aerial predators, unless thus hidden by a covering of broad and stiff leaves. ===Similar species=== Protea foliosa is distinguished from the three other species classified in section Crinitae, P. intonsa, P. montana and P. vogtsiae, by being the one to grow in the form of a shrub with erect branches with terminal, clustered flower heads. Additionally, this is the only species in this group which has its flower heads obscured from sight by its surrounding leaves. P. recondita, which occurs on high mountain slopes further to the west, also has terminal flower heads which are wrapped by the surrounding and subtending leaves and bracts, but in this species the single heads are bourne much higher in the air on erect branches, not near to the ground. P. foliosa has long been confused with P. tenax the first to do so was one of the first, in the early 1830s, collectors of this plant, Dr√®ge, who published about this species partially under that name in 1843. Later authors maintained this confusion, Meissner correctly identified that the differently labelled collections were the same taxon, but he classified it as a new variety, latifolia, of P. tenax. Beginning with Phillips around 1910, and later Stapf (1912) and Rycroft (1960), both the nominate P. tenax and var. latifolia were believed to be sympatric, with both taxa being identified from different specimens made in the same locations. This situation persisted until 1975, when Rourke published his article The Protea tenax tangle. The two species are now known to be neither allopatric nor closely related. ==Distribution== The species is endemic to the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. It is distributed from the Elandsberg to Port Elizabeth, and Riebeek East to Makhanda (formerly Grahamstown) or the Bushman's River Poort. It is spatially distributed as either scattered individuals to being locally abundant in occurrence. It occurs over a range of 9750 km¬≤ (extent of occurrence). ==Ecology== Protea foliosa can re-sprout from an underground bole after periodic wildfires move through its habitat. The seeds are stored in the old, dried, woody, fire-resistant infructescences (seed-heads) on the plant, and are released after two years, after fires, to be dispersed by the wind. Although one source states that the florets of this species are pollinated by birds and insects, it has been theorised since 1977 that this action was achieved by rodents. A 2015 paper provided evidence that the main diurnal pollinator was the species Rhabdomys pumilio. ===Habitat=== P. foliosa is almost exclusively found in fynbos habitat, in the far east of the extent of fynbos, but around Makhanda it grows in grassland thicket. It is found in soils derived of sandstone, quartzite, or sometimes sedimentary conglomerates. It often grows at moist sites, where it may become locally abundant, at altitudes from 150 to 600 (or 610) metres. ==Conservation== It is locally common in its range where the habitat is suitable, and is not in danger of extinction. The population number is thought to be stable as of 2019. The species was first assessed by the South African National Biodiversity Institute for the Red List of South African Plants as 'least concern' in 2009. This assessment was reiterated in 2019. The species is conserved in the protected areas of Longmoor Forest Area and the Van Stadensberg Forest Reserve. ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== * foliosa Category:Flora of the Cape Provinces ","title":"Protea foliosa"},{"id":"63795816","text":"Map of Massachusetts House of Representatives' 4th Middlesex district, 2013.

In Afrikaans it is known as klossie-suikerbos. ==Taxonomy== Protea intonsa has only been known to exist for half a century or so, it was first described as new to science by the South African botanist John Patrick Rourke in 1971. He had first collected the species in 1967 in the Oudtshoorn Local Municipality on the rocky southeastern slopes of the Mannetjiesberg at elevation (collector #860). An isotype of Rourke's original collection is housed at the herbarium at Kew. P. intonsa was classified in Protea section Crinitae by Tony Rebelo in 1995, what he calls the \\"eastern ground sugarbushes\\", along with P. foliosa, P. montana and P. vogtsiae. ==Description== This plant is a small, densely branched shrub up to tall. It is acaulescent, the shrubs having the appearance of low tufts in diameter. The stems (rhizomes) grow underground, and have a characteristically scaled bark. It is a long-lived species. The leaves are linear, narrow and slightly glaucous. The inflorescences are specialised structures called pseudanthia, also known simply as flower heads, containing hundred of reduced flowers, called florets. These inflorescences are surrounded by petal-like appendages known as 'involucral bracts'. These bracts are pale green or greenish white base colour, this being flushed with carmine. The margins of the bracts are a dull carmine, except for the apex, which is covered in a 7mm long, white- coloured beard of hairs. It is a monoecious species, both sexes occur in each flower. The blooms are produced in late spring, between September and November. ===Similar species=== Protea intonsa is similar to P. vogtsiae in section Crinitae, both being dwarf shrubs with subterranean stems, and has similar leaves to P. montana, which is a larger mat-forming plant with much- branched stems growing prostrate on the ground. ==Distribution== Protea intonsa is endemic to the southwestern part of the Cape Region of South Africa, where it is found in the south of the area where the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces meet. It occurs in the eastern Swartberg, Kammanassie and Baviaanskloof mountains. It is found on the Mannetjiesberg, the highest mountain in the Kammanassie Mountains, where it occurs frequently, in patches. The species is often spatially distributed as isolated populations of scattered plants. ==Ecology== ===Habitat=== It grows on dry, exposed mountain slopes at altitudes between 1,000 and 1,600 metres. It has only been found to occur in a fynbos habitat sometimes on high mountains, or in grassy fynbos. It is usually found on a substrate derived from sandstone, but near Kango in the Swartberge it occurs on conglomerates. ===Wildfires=== According to one source, the wildfires which periodically move through the land in which the shrub grows destroy the adult plants, but the seeds can survive such an event, whereas a newer source states the plants survive fires by being able to re- sprout from underground stems. The florets are pollinated by rodents. The seeds are retained in the old, dry, fire-resistant infructescence on the plant for two years, when they are finally released after fires the seeds are dispersed by the wind. ==Conservation== Although the range is restricted to a relatively small area, it is not threatened. The South African National Biodiversity Institute assessed the conservation status of the species for the Red List of South African Plants as 'least concern' in 2019, this assessment had first been given by the same organisation in 2009. It is threatened by anything serious and is not in danger of extinction. A population is protected within the Kammanassie Nature Reserve. ==See also== * ==References== intonsa Category:Flora of the Cape Provinces ","title":"Protea intonsa"},{"id":"63796250","text":"Jo Rutten (20 May 1934 - 21 March 2007) was a Dutch equestrian.

In 1812, when he was ten years old, he had to move, by order of the French authorities, to the military college of La Fl√®che in France, despite the family's attempts to exempt him from this duty. When he was almost thirty years old, he was eventually able to return to his hometown and he took charge of the family with the help of his mother. Ettore never married and had no children, making him the last male direct descendant of the family. Vincenzo Ciccotti, Camillo Borgia (1773-1817).

In addition, in 1847 he was given command of the City Guard Battalion with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. But in 1849 he supported the Roman Republic and was even placed on the head of the Marittima Province, south of Rome. Luca Maggiore, L'ordine pubblico nello Stato pontificio. Velletri dal 1814 al 1870, Tivoli, Tored edizioni, 2016 In 1867, after the invasion of the Papal State and the arrival in Velletri by Giovanni Nicotera and his volunteer army, Ettore was appointed as member of the municipal administration for his role in the 1849 uprising. However, after Garibaldi's defeat in Mentana, he had to flee the city and follow Nicotera during his retreat. In 1870, following the annexation of the Papal State to Italy, Ettore was rewarded for his patriotic actions over the years and was therefore appointed president of the (Provisory) Provincial Council of Rome. After the dissolution of this governmental body a few months later and due to his old age, he left active politics and became president of the nursery school of Velletri, which he helped to finance through various initiatives.

Once inside the Tropicana, Gottlieb waited in line for approximately 5 minutes to play the casino's Fun House Million Dollar Wheel Promotion, which offers a variety of prizes including a $1 million payout. The Tropicana offers \\"Diamond Club\\" members one free spin on the wheel every day; Gottlieb used her membership card for the free spin. Gottlieb contends that the wheel landed on the $1 million prize, but the wheel operator intervened reactivated the wheel, which subsequently landed on a lesser prize of two show tickets. The Tropicana casino claims that the wheel never landed on $1 million, and the attendant never reactivated the wheel. ==Decision== ===Summary Judgement=== The Court affirmed that participation in a contest is considered entering a contract. Since Gottlieb had to drive to the casino, wait in line to spin the wheel and present her \\"Diamond Club\\" card to the casino attendant provided consideration to form a contract with the Tropicana Casino. Further, participation in the game provided entertainment for those at the casino, which benefited the Tropicana. Precedent for the ruling was also found in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases including Lucky Calendar Co. v. Cohen and Cobaugh v. Klick-Lewis, Inc. ===Jury Trial=== Since there was no factual evidence, Judge Bartle moved to a jury trial. Two eyewitnesses testified on behalf of Gottlieb claiming they had seen the wheel hit the $1 million jackpot. After a three day trial, an eight-person jury came back ruling in favor of Gottlieb. ==References== Category:United States contract case law Category:2000 in United States case law ","title":"Gottlieb v.

She supports the Green New Deal throughout the book and in the final essay she discusses the 2020 U.S. election stating: \\"The stakes of the election are almost unbearably high.

On 14 September 1969, before even having appeared for the reserves, he made his first team ‚Äì and La Liga ‚Äì debut, coming on as a second- half substitute for Jos√© Argoitia in a 2‚Äì0 home win against RCD Mallorca. Ortuondo scored his first goal in the main category of Spanish football on 5 October 1969, netting his team's second in a 2‚Äì3 away loss against FC Barcelona. He would move back to the B-side in the second level for the remainder of the season, which ended in relegation. After starting the 1970‚Äì71 campaign with seven goals in only ten appearances for the B's, Ortuondo was promoted to the main squad in November 1970. Despite being a part of the main squad, he never established as a starter, and left the club in 1973 for CD Logro√±√©s in Tercera Divisi√≥n. In 1974, Ortuondo moved to Segunda Divisi√≥n side Real Oviedo, appearing rarely in the club's promotion campaign. He appeared regularly afterwards, as the club suffered two relegations and achieved one promotion in 1979; in that season, he scored a career-best 12 goals. In 1980, Ortuondo moved abroad and joined Atl√©tico Espa√±ol FC in Mexico. In 1982, after the club's dissolution, he returned to his home country and subsequently represented CF Lorca Deportiva and C√≥rdoba CF in Segunda Divisi√≥n B, retiring with the latter in 1984 at the age of 33. ==Coaching career== Immediately after retiring Ortuondo took up coaching, taking over last club C√≥rdoba which was recently relegated to the fourth division. After achieving promotion with the side, he left in 1986 and was subsequently in charge of CP Almer√≠a and Linares CF also in the third level. Ortuondo was named manager of Atl√©tico Madrid's reserves ahead of the 1989‚Äì90 season, in the second division. He was dismissed when the club's relegation was confirmed, and spent a year without a club before taking over CF Extremadura in the third tier. Promoted to the second division in 1994, Ortuondo left Extremadura for CD Badajoz, but was dismissed in May of the following year. He subsequently returned to the Azulgranas, achieving promotion to the top tier but being immediately relegated afterwards. On 3 July 1998, Ortuondo was appointed in charge of Rayo Vallecano in the second division. He was relieved from his duties the following 9 March, being replaced by M√°ximo Hern√°ndez, but was reinstated as manager six days later. Ortuondo left Rayo as the club appointed Juande Ramos in charge, remaining unemployed until 11 January 1999, when he was named manager of UD Salamanca in the top tier. In July, he returned to Extremadura for a third spell, with the club in division two. Ortuondo was relieved from his duties on 7 April 2002, and returned to C√≥rdoba in June. Dismissed the following 20 January, he was appointed in charge of Algeciras CF on 28 November, but was sacked from the latter club in March 2004. In June 2005, Ortuondo started his fourth period at Extremadura, now in division three. He resigned in January 2007 due to the club's severe financial crisis. In March of the following year, he took the reins of CF Palencia, severely threatened with relegation, but could not avoid the drop. ==References* Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Spanish footballers Category:Basque footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi√≥n players Category:Segunda Divisi√≥n B players Category:Tercera Divisi√≥n players Category:Athletic Bilbao footballers Category:Bilbao Athletic footballers Category:CD Logro√±√©s footballers Category:Real Oviedo players Category:C√≥rdoba CF players Category:Spanish football managers Category:La Liga managers Category:Segunda Divisi√≥n managers Category:Segunda Divisi√≥n B managers Category:C√≥rdoba CF managers Category:CP Almer√≠a managers Category:Atl√©tico Madrid B managers Category:Rayo Vallecano managers Category:CF Extremadura managers Category:Algeciras CF managers ","title":"Josu Ortuondo"},{"id":"63796878","text":"Mala Divytsia (, ) is an urban-type settlement in Pryluky Raion, Chernihiv Oblast, Ukraine.

He was the most prolific producer of Satsuma ware. That term was originally coined for artistic painted porcelain from the Satsuma Province. Eventually it expanded to include low-quality porcelain that was mass-produced for export, whereas Meizan was one of the artists who continued the tradition of high artistic quality while also successfully exporting. He is regarded as the \\"prince\\" of this medium and today his works are sought after by collectors. == Biography == Bowl painted and gilded, c. 1910 Yabu Meizan was born on January 20, 1853 in Nagahori, Osaka. In 1880 he opened his workshop in Osaka, employing and training artists. Wares were brought from the kiln of Chin Jukan in Satsuma Province to Osaka to be decorated. The American art museum founder Charles Parsons recounts a visit to Meizan's workshop in his book Notes of a Trip around the World in 1894 and 1895. > \\"He is very celebrated. He had 17 men and boys at work, all decorating. He > makes the designs and watches them carefully in executing the work. Some are > very wonderful workers. All is order, neatness and silence, no words > spoken.\\" Meizan actively marketed his work internationally as well as domestically, taking an active role in organising the presentation of Japanese wares at world's fairs. This led to acclaim as well as sales. His success inspired another workshop to use his name and imitate his style, without matching his subtlety or detail. His career declined during World War I as the war and economic turmoil made it difficult to run an export business. Japanese art was also falling out of favour with American and European buyers, who gradually turned to China. == Style == Meizan's works are characterised by minute decoration applied using copper plate designs. These engraved copper plates were used to print the designs on paper, which would then be cut to provide stencils for painting on vases or plates. His decorations used Chinese and Buddhist subjects until the 1890s, when he adopted more Japanese symbolism, such as fishermen or fighting samurai. He would draw from or copy popular prints by artists including Hiroshige. Over the course of his career, the designs included more and more detail. A single work might depict thousands or flowers or butterflies, or hundreds of people in a procession. Towards the end of his career he took a different approach, covering whole vases in a single motif. This new artistic direction, which may have been inspired by critics' opinions, was a commercial failure at the time; buyers much preferred the crowded style. == Exhibitions == From 1885 to 1916, Meizan displayed his art works at a number of national exhibitions and world's fairs, winning multiple medals. These included the Fourth Kyoto Exhibition of 1885 (where he won a bronze medal), the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1899 and again in 1900, the Louisiana Purchase Exhibition of 1904 and the London Japan‚ÄìBritish Exhibition of 1910. For the Louisiana Purchase Exhibition, Meizan was appointed as secretary of the Japan Exhibits Association, organising the arrangement and decoration of the hall. His final international exhibition was the 1915 Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition in San Francisco. Outside of Japan a large collection of his art works form part of the Khalili Collection of Japanese Art. The Walters Art Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art also hold pieces. Works by Meizan were included in exhibitions drawn from the Khalili Collections at the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff, in 1994 and 1995, in the Wilmington Arts Centre, Delaware, in 1999, Portland Art Museum in 2002, and in the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, in 2006. == Gallery == File:MET 136074.jpgBowl, late 19th century File:Khalili Collection of Japanese Meiji Art S148.jpgVase, circa 1890 File:Yabu Meizan - Bowl with a Multitude of Women - Walters 492280 - Profile.jpgBowl with a multitude of women, circa 1904 File:Khalili Collection of Japanese Meiji Art S128.jpgBowl, circa 1910 == References == === Sources === * * == Further reading == * Category:Japanese ceramists Category:Japanese porcelain Category:1853 births Category:1934 deaths Category:People from Osaka ","title":"Yabu Meizan"},{"id":"63797384","text":"Map of Massachusetts House of Representatives' 10th Worcester district, 2013.

Its nucleus was the 4th Battalion Massachusetts Volunteer Militia, known as the \\"New England Guards.\\" An old state militia unit dating back to the Revolution, the 4th Battalion was called upon to serve garrison duty at Fort Independence shortly after the beginning of the Civil War. After President Abraham Lincoln's August 1862 call for 300,000 men to serve for nine months the 4th Battalion was given permission to recruit to a full regiment and to muster into federal service. The regiment trained at Camp Meigs in Readville, Massachusetts just outside of Boston. They departed Massachusetts on October 24, assigned to Maj. Gen. John G. Foster's Department of North Carolina, later designated as the XVIII Corps. The regiment was stationed in New Bern, North Carolina. They saw their first combat during the Battle of Rawl's Mills, North Carolina in November 1862. In December, the regiment took part in the Goldsboro Expedition. The objective of this maneuver was to disrupt the Confederate supply line along the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad by destroying the Goldsboro Bridge. During this expedition, was lightly engaged in the Battles of Kinston and Goldsboro Bridge. In March and April 1863, they participated in the Siege of Washington, North Carolina. In late April, the regiment moved to New Bern where, for the next two months, they participated in patrols and reconnaissance expeditions. The regiment returned to Boston on June 10 and was mustered out on June 18. On July 14, the unit was called upon to enforce law and order in New York City following the tumultuous New York Draft Riots. After a week of service there, they returned home. During their service in North Carolina, the regiment lost 12 men killed in action or mortally wounded and 29 by disease. == See also == * Massachusetts in the Civil War * List of Massachusetts Civil War units ==Notes== ==References== * * * Category:Massachusetts Civil War regiments Category:Military units and formations established in 1862 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1863 ","title":"44th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment"},{"id":"63797401","text":"Matanat Jafarova (; born 19 January 1986) is an Azerbaijani former footballer who played as a defender.

Built in 1906, it is a Grade II listed building. ==History== The building was commissioned to replace an old 19th-century town hall in the Market Square. The site selected for the new building was bounded by three existing residential streets. The foundation stone for the new building was laid by a former charter mayor, Thomas Dewey, on 25 July 1906. The new building was designed by R. Frank Atkinson in the Baroque style and built by F. G. Minter of Putney.Foundation stone on Tweedy Road It was officially opened by the mayor, Alderman Reginald James, on 25 September 1907. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with 15 bays facing onto Tweedy Road; the central section of three bays featured a semi-circular porch supported by four Ionic order columns and surmounted by an urn on the ground floor; there were three windows with a pediment above on the first floor; a wooden cupola with a copper dome was erected at roof level. The principal rooms were the council chamber and the mayor's parlour, both located on the first floor. An extension designed by Charles Cowles-Voysey in the Neo-Georgian style was completed in 1939. The design involved a frontage of 17 bays facing onto Widmore Road; the central section featured a doorway with stone surround on the ground floor; there was a window with stone surround on the first floor. The principal room was a new council chamber located on a mezzanine level at the rear of the building. The building was established as the headquarters of the Municipal Borough of Bromley and continued to function as the local of seat of government when the enlarged London Borough of Bromley was formed in 1965. David Bowie's wedding to Mary Angela Barnett took place in the town hall in March 1970. An underground nuclear fall-out shelter was built under the extension during the 1980s. As part of a larger regeneration scheme to create a new Civic Centre, the council moved their offices to the old palace in 1982. The town hall was then used as the home of the Bromley College Business School until 2007. The building, which subsequently became vacant, was added to the Heritage at Risk Register in 2009. In 2020 works began to convert the town hall into apartments and new offices and to establish a boutique hotel on the site. ==References== Category:Government buildings completed in 1907 Category:City and town halls in London Category:Grade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Bromley Category:1907 establishments in England ","title":"Bromley Town Hall"},{"id":"63797484","text":"A L'entrada Del Temps Clar is a Catalan ballad that is believed to have been written in the 12th century.

The main mosque in North West London, it is located on Ealing Road and serves the UK‚Äôs fifth largest Muslim community, which is predominantly Pakistani and Bangladeshi. Along with the adjacent Muslim Welfare Association, it has a capacity of up to 2200 people. ==Building details== The three-storey semi- detached building was originally a Protestant church designed by Thomas Colcutt and Stanley Hemp but was then purchased in 1993 for ¬£380,000 by the mosque committee. Work began in 1993 and finished in 1996 with the committee spending ¬£100,000 on refurbishing the whole building and the construction of a new ablution area for the men. The mosque has a large hall, a gallery, offices and a funeral room. Construction began on the first expansion project called the Muslim Welfare Association in 2003. Adjacent to the mosque, it is a two- storey building which had been burnt down due to an electrical fault. The cost of the project was ¬£500,000. The renovation work finished in 2005 including a brand new first floor. The centre has two halls, classrooms, ladies area, kitchen unit, meeting room and a main office. ==History== ===1985: The original Wembley Central Mosque=== The MWA Committee was set up in 1985 to organise congregational prayers as there was no mosque in North West London despite the high number of Muslims. The committee purchased a three-storey semi-detached house on Harrowdene Road. It could hold a capacity of up to 400 worshippers but soon the Muslim community was growing. A new and bigger mosque with facilities for all Muslims was necessary. ===1993: The new Wembley Central Mosque=== The St Andrew's Presbyterian Church in the centre of Wembley had been vacant for fifteen years. It was bought by the charity funds of the Muslim community, and the money made from the sale of the smaller mosque, established in 1985 on Harrowdene Road. It took three years to complete all the work that was essential. After the work had been completed, the mosque was ready for use. Soon the mosque held the five daily congregational prayers, Jumu'ah prayers, Ramadan prayers (Taraweeh & Tahajjud) and Eid prayers. The new Wembley Central Mosque held a capacity of 700 worshippers. The mosque was also now allowed to broadcast the live Adhan (call to prayer) using loudspeakers only for Jumu'ah (Friday prayer). ===1996: Single-storey extension=== As the building was listed, the committee found it hard to get permission from the local council for building plans but after a long time of trying and hard work, they finally got permission for a single storey extension linked to the back of the mosque to create a brand new ablution area, offices and funeral services. ===2003: First expansion project (Muslim Welfare Association)=== The Muslim population was increasing rapidly each year. Adjacent to the mosque was an old unused building. The committee and the community decided to rebuild it and put it to good use. At first, there was a slight financial problem but the community pitched in together and the mosque instantly raised ¬£500,000 to rebuild the building and name it the Muslim Welfare Association. Work began straightaway in 2003 and the new centre opened in 2005 with over 4,000 people attending the opening Friday prayers. The Muslim Welfare Association is the other side of Wembley Central Mosque. The committee hoped that the Muslim Welfare Association will help the community by providing better facilities for women, WCM Evening Madrasah, Sunday School and on a busy day, the Muslim Welfare Association can be used for prayer space and can accommodate up to 500 worshippers. ===2009: Second expansion project=== On Fridays, The mosque and centre gets filled up promptly even though there are two Jumu'ah Prayers. Worshippers have to pray on the streets. The Wembley Central Mosque & Muslim Welfare Association decided to launch their second expansion project costing over ¬£1 million. The expansion project aimed to increase the prayer capacity from 2200 to 3500 by building a new prayer hall linked to the existing main hall. After the construction work is complete, there will be more services and facilities including a fully equipped library with ICT facilities. Also, there will be improved facilities for Islamic funeral services. Meetings were held between the mosque committee, contractors, builders (Capital Constructions) and also the council for permission. After getting permission for a three phase expansion project, Wembley Central Mosque started collecting funds. ===2011=== On 10 January 2011, Phase 1 of the expansion project began. On 16 March 2011, Qur'an reciter Abu Bakr Shatri visited the mosque. He first recited Surah Ar-Rahman and then he presented the mosque with an award which was accepted by the Head Imam, Abdul Sattar. Abu Bakr Shatri then made a Dua for the whole Muslim Ummah with the congregation joining in with him. On 9 July 2011, Egyptian reciter Muhammad Jibreel visited the mosque on his UK tour sponsored by ‚ÄòIslamic Relief‚Äô.

In the beginning of French revolution Jagot worked as a justice of the peace in Nantua. On 1 September 1791, he was elected as a deputy of Ain in the National Legislative Assembly where he served for one year. Then on 5 September 1792, Jagot was elected to National Convention. In September 1792, he was sent to Savoy to organize the Mont-Blanc department there, therefore Jagot was not present during the trial of Louis XVI and did not vote.

The same day they wrote the second letter, clarifying the first collective letter. In the second letter, the representatives declared their clear preference for the death sentence for Louis XVI. After France occupied Monaco in 1793, Jagot was one of those who governed Monaco. Along with Henri Baptist Gr√©goire, Jagot organized the new department of the Alpes-Maritimes after the annexation of the County of Nice by French Republic. Jagot and Gr√©goire urged local people of Alpes-Maritimes department to attend patriotic festivities on the occasion of annexation in order to strengthen the communal spirit and public opinion of new citizens of the Republic. Jagot became a member of the division committee and the general safety committee where he developed a police activity in consultation with Amar and Vadier. He is widely cited by those he employed to create lists of alleged prison conspirators.

He and his twin brother Hahgwehdaetgah, the god of evil, were children of Atahensic (or in some versions her daughter, the Earth Mother), whom Hahgwehdaetgah killed in childbirth. Hahgwehdiyu created the world from his own body and that of his mother's. His outstretched palm became the sky, his mother's head the sun, and her breasts became the moon and stars. He made her body the earth, into which he planted a seed, which grew into the maize plant. == Creation of The Earth == : This version of the creation story is taken from (Converse 1908). The Earth was a thought in the mind of the ruler of a great island floating above the clouds. This ruler was called by various names, among them Ha-wen-ni-yu, meaning He who governs or The Ruler. The island is a place of calm where all needs are provided and there is no pain or death. On this island grew a great appleParker says \\"The central tree in the heaven world was the apple.\\" The apple tree was introduced by European settlers. Elsewhere he suggests that the crab apple (\\"wild-apple\\") is meant. tree where the inhabitants held council. The Ruler said \\"let us make a new place where another people can grow. Under our council tree is a great sea of clouds which calls out for light.\\" He ordered the council tree to be uprooted and he looked down into the depths. He had Ata-en-sic,Parker says: \\"Ata‚Äô-en‚Äôsic ... is the Huron name for the first mother, and not that of the (confederated) Iroquois, The Senecas usually give this character no name other than Ea-gen‚Äô-tci, literally old woman or ancient bodied. This name is not a personal one, however. Mrs Converse has therefore substituted the Huronian personal name for the Iroquoian common name.\\" Sky Woman, look down. He heard the voice of the sea calling; he told Ata-en-sic, who was pregnant, to bring it life. He wrapped her in light and dropped her down through the hole. Once brought to at the surface, the oeh-dah grew and became an island. Ata-en-sic heard two voices under her heart and knew her time had come. One voice was calm and quiet, but the other was loud and angry. These were the Do-yo-da-no, The Twins. The good twin, Hah-gweh-di-yu or Teharonhiakwako, was born in the normal way. The evil twin, H√§-qweh-da-ƒõt-g«éh or Sawiskera, forced his way out from under his mother's arm, killing her.Other versions of the story say that Ata-en-sic gave birth to a daughter. This daughter was impregnated by the wind, gave birth to the twins, and died, leaving her sons in the care of Ata-en-sic After the death of Sky Woman the island was shrouded in gloom. Hah-gweh-di-yu shaped the sky and created the sun from his mother's face saying \\"you shall rule here where your face will shine forever.\\" H√§-qweh-da-ƒõt-g«éh, however, set the great darkness in the west to drive down the sun. Hah-gweh-di-yu then took the Moon and Stars from his mother's breast, and placed them, his sisters, to guard the night sky. He gave his mother's body to the earth, the Great Mother from whom all life came. Hah- gweh-di-yu, corresponding to the Huron spirit Ioskeha, created the first people. He healed disease, defeated demons, and gave many of the Iroquois magical and ceremonial rituals. Another of his gifts was tobacco, which has been used as a central part of the Iroquois religion.

Upon arriving in Montana, Cushman contacted county agricultural agents, home demonstration agents, and poultry raisers in their farm homes and ‚Äúenough problems were unearthed to keep one busy for a lifetime\\".Burlingame, Merrill G. and Edward J. Bell Jr. The Montana Cooperative Extension Service: A History 1893-1974 pp 229-236. Harriette discovered that poultry production in Montana suffered from poor production, management, and marketing. As the poultry specialist, Cushman traveled the state instructing growers on how to improve the quantity and quality of their flocks and eggs. Cushman also created the cooperative marketing pools that helped drive poultry production in Montana and massively improved marketing efforts, particularly for eggs, in the state. These wholesale cooperatives of the 1920s were the first of their kind in the nation and helped Montana Montana poultry growers negotiate premium prices. Cushman‚Äôs efforts to improve poultry production protected the industry in Montana during the Great Depression and kept it profitable despite the economic downturn.Danforth, Betsy. ‚ÄúHarriette Cushman.‚Äù Extraordinary Ordinary Women of MSU.

Cushman also introduced poultry production into 4-H clubs in Montana. Finally, Cushman promoted and spread flock production on Indian reservations. Through raising poultry, she aimed to decrease the poverty and lack of economic opportunity that she saw in these areas. Much of Cushman‚Äôs contribution to the poultry industry focused on education.Ambrose, Linda McGuire, and Joan M. Jensen. Women in Agriculture: Professionalizing Rural Life in North America and Europe, 1880-1965. University of Iowa Press, 2017. She wanted to instruct Montana farmers and the general public on how to better raise poultry as well as the positive qualities of Montana eggs themselves. To wit, Cushman organized egg shows in 1923, 1924, 1925, and 1926 to promote raising high- quality eggs and market them to the public. She also devised methods of consumer education during the 1930s, including grading demonstrations, 4-H demonstrations, cooking schools, and leaflets and pamphlets. Cushman also assisted farmers across the state with poultry techniques and new technological knowledge. ==Personal life== While Cushman enjoyed her job as a poultry specialist, she was also passionate about writing. She wrote hundreds of poems over the course of her lifetime that covered subjects from chickens to Christmas. Cushman also focused on the success of Indian students at Montana State College. Her work with the Blackfeet Nation and other Indian tribes in Montana meant that she was invested in education and assistance for Indian students. In 1969, Cushman sent out invitations to her future funeral and asked her friends to donate to the Indian Center instead of spending money on mourning. She also willed her estate to Montana State University to provide funds to the Indian Center and a scholarship fund for outstanding American Indian students. ==Awards and recognition== Cushman received many awards, both during her life and posthumously. In 1954, she was named a fellow of the Montana Institute for the Arts. In 1959, she was inducted into 4-H honorary society Mu Beta Beta. In 1969, Cushman received the Epsilon Sigma Phi ‚ÄúRuby Award‚Äù for distinguished service from the Cooperative Extension Service. In 1963, Montana State College awarded Cushman an honorary doctorate of Doctor of Agriculture. In 1973, she received the Blue and Gold award for ‚Äúher lifetime service to Montana.\\" ==Later years== Following her retirement in 1955, Cushman worked to promote Native education and fought for environmental awareness and protection. She lobbied against strip mining for coal in eastern Montana in 1973, just five years before she died in 1978. She also composed poetry and supported the arts in Montana. She donated her papers to Montana State University, which are now held by Special Collections and Archival Informatics at the Montana State University Library. ==Publications== * Halcrow, Harold G., and Harriette Eliza Cushman.

At a young age, Grue fell in love with books and poetry, particularly The Golden Treasury by Louis Untermeyer, which featured female poets. Inspired by the poetry, Grue decided to become a poet herself. She received a Bachelor of Arts in English from the University of New Orleans in 1963 and a Master of Fine Arts from Warren Wilson College in 1982. ==Career== In the early 1960s, Grue began reading her poetry at The Quorum Club, the first non-segregated coffee house in the South. During her time at the club, she met Eluard Burt, who she collaborated with over many years, including on the CD of jazz poetry titled Live! on Frenchmen Street. Ms. Grue founded the New Orleans Poetry Forum in 1972, where she was director until 1990. For many years she promoted poetry readings at her home, establishing there the Backyard Poetry Theater. Since 1982, she also has edited the international independent literary journal, The New Laurel Review which is still published today. Grue was a visiting writer at Tulane University from 1993 to 1998. Following Hurricane Katrina, she began teaching fiction and poetry at the Alvar Branch of the New Orleans Public Library. Grue is co-owner of BJ's Lounge in the Bywater neighborhood of New Orleans with her son, Teal Grue.

He played college football at Michigan State. ==Early life and high school== Williams grew up in Lawndale and East Garfield Park, two of the most crime-ridden neighborhoods in Chicago. In sixth grade, he joined the Garfield Gators youth football team. Williams became a national all-star in eighth grade. Williams attended DePaul College Prep, formerly known as Gordon Tech, where he played basketball and football. He was named captain of the basketball team as a sophomore, coached by Tom Kleinschmidt. As a senior on the football team, he was named first team all-state after recording 74 tackles, eight sacks, nine pass breakups and three forced fumbles. Williams was a four-star recruit ranked the No. 19 tackle in the nation according to 247Sports.com, and he signed with Michigan State in December 2014 after considering offers from Oregon, Arizona, Missouri, and Penn State, among others. Williams chose the Spartans after hearing fond memories from trusted adults who attended the university. ==College career== At Michigan State, Williams redshirted his freshman season. He started two games at nose tackle as a redshirt freshman. As a sophomore in 2017, Williams was named honorable mention All-Big Ten and earned Michigan State's Iron Man award for strength and conditioning. He finished with 31 tackles, six tackles for loss and 2.5 sacks. As a junior, he was a first team All-Big Ten honoree after tallying 53 tackles, 10.5 tackles for loss and two sacks. Despite being considered a potential NFL draft early entrant, Williams told coach Mark Dantonio he was returning for his senior season to improve as a pass rusher and earn his degree. Coming into his senior season, Williams was on the watchlist for the Outland Trophy. He earned second team All-Big Ten honors as a senior in 2019. Williams recorded 48 tackles including 7.5 for loss, 5.0 sacks and one forced fumble. He participated in the East-West Shrine Bowl following the season. Williams made 42 consecutive starts at defensive tackle, which he considers one of his favorite achievements. He finished his career with 160 tackles, 29 for loss, and 11.5 sacks in his career. ==Professional career== After going undrafted in the 2020 NFL Draft, Williams signed an undrafted free agent deal with the Philadelphia Eagles. He was waived on September 5, 2020, and re- signed to the team's practice squad the next day. ==Personal life== Williams's mother Latasha Williams gave birth to him at the age of 14. He was also raised by Mackenzie Hyde, his third grade teacher whom he considers a godmother. On January 13, 2016, his cousin Antonio Pollards was murdered in a drive-by shooting on the way to school. Williams's brother Corey Hill was killed in a similar drive-by shooting on June 7, 2017. Neither murder has been solved. ==References== ==External links== *Michigan State Spartans bio Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Players of American football from Illinois Category:American football defensive tackles Category:Michigan State Spartans football players Category:Sportspeople from Chicago Category:Philadelphia Eagles players ","title":"Raequan Williams"},{"id":"63797951","text":"Barry Thomas Roycroft, AM (born 25 May 1944) is an Australian equestrian competitor, administrator, and coach.

In Afrikaans it is known as swartbergsuikerbos. ==Taxonomy== Protea montana was first scientifically collected at elevation by the German plant collector and horticulturalist Johann Franz Dr√®ge in August 1829,The date 1840 is written on the herbarium specimen sheet at Kew, but this is doubtlessly not the collection date, as Dr√®ge had long returned to Europe by that time. Note Kew has indexed the same sheet three times. when he was exploring the eastern flanks of the Groot Swartberg Mountains with Karl Zeyher in the area of the farm of Vrolykheid. When he returned to Europe from Africa, he detailed his botanical adventures in his 1843 work Zwei pflanzengeographische Documente, which detailed where he collected what each month in a brief diary-like format. This work is the first in which the name P. montana was published. In an index appended to the back of the book, Dr√®ge attributes the name to Ernst Heinrich Friedrich Meyer, but aside from this, nothing else is published about it, thus the name was officially an invalid nomen nudum. This situation was rectified by the Swiss taxonomist Carl Meissner in 1856, when he validated the name with a formal species description in the Prodromus book series of botanical taxonomy begun by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle. ===Type=== Dr√®ge made a number of different dried and flattened exsiccata specimen sheets from his Vrolykheid collection, and these he traded or sold across Europe. One sheet found its way into the herbarium of George Bentham, and when he decided to get rid of his collection in 1854 he donated it to the Kew Botanical Gardens, where, in the herbarium there, it still remains housed today. It was designated an isotype by the South African botanist Edwin Percy Phillips, but half a century later, in 1960 the South African botanist Hedley Brian Rycroft realised that the sheet was composed of parts from different individual plants: one part was in fact P. amplexicaulis.Note Kew has indexed the same sheet differently three times. ===Classification=== P. montana was classified in Protea section Crinitae by Tony Rebelo in 1995, what he calls the \\"eastern ground sugarbushes\\", along with P. foliosa, P. intonsa and P. vogtsiae. ==Description== === Habitus === habitus This plant is a low, prostrate shrub forming sprawling mats up to wide. The main stem is subterranean. The stems branching from that branch themselves numerous times, but only grow above-ground to leaf and flower- bearing parts which are long. === Leaves === leaves It has linear to oblanceolate leaves, indistinctly veined and ending in a sharp mucronate point, which grow up to in length, and 1.6 to 3.7mm in width. The base of the leaves attenuates gradually to the broadest point. The leaves are adpressly hairy, soon becoming glabrous. === Flowers === flower head The inflorescences are specialised structures called pseudanthia, also known simply as flower heads, containing hundred of reduced flowers, called florets. These flower heads are sessile in this species, lacking a peduncle and growing directly from the stem. The flower heads are long and in diameter, and are completely covered in leaves. The inflorescences are surrounded by six to seven series of petal-like appendages known as 'involucral bracts'. The outer bracts are ovate and covered in silky-pubescent hairs, and grow until they become long and leaf-like. The inner bracts are oblong to spathulate-oblong, are fringed with ciliate hairs along their margins, have the same type of silky-pubescent indumentum on their outside surfaces and are the same length as the actual flowers. The plant is monoecious, both sexes occur in each flower. The petals and sepals of the florets are fused into a tube-like, 23.3mm long perianth- sheath which is membranous, dilated and glabrous at the very base, but otherwise largely covered in reddish pubescence. The sheath is furthermore dilated, having three keels and five veins on the lower part. The sheath has a lip (pollen-presenter) which is 10.6mm long. The lip has three prongs, and is glabrous on the lower portion except for the ciliate margin, but increasingly covered in pubescence near the apex, and ending in a dense woolly tuft. The two prongs at the sides are 4.2mm long, linear in shape and woolly, whereas the middle prong is 2.1mm long, linear and woolly. All of the stamens are fertile. The filament is 1mm long and swollen. The anthers are linear and 5.3mm long. The apical glands are 0.5mm long, ovate in shape, and end in a somewhat sharp apex. The ovary is 4.2mm long, oblong-elliptic, and covered with long, reddish-brown hairs. The style is 23.3mm long, falcate and glabrous, narrowing from the base upwards and flattened at the upper parts. The finely channeled stigma is 5.3 long, ends in a blunt point, and almost imperceptibly joins together and becomes the style. ===Similar species=== P. montana is the only mat-forming species in the section Crinitae, but the leaves are similar to those of P. intonsa, which also occurs in the same mountain ranges; this is a much smaller, tuft-forming species with almost completely subterranean stems. In his original 1856 species description, working from incomplete herbarium sheets, Meissner states he finds the species to be dubious, and questions if it was not some variety of P. scolymocephala. Dr√®ge himself appears to have confused P. montana with P. amplexicaulis, as one flower head of that species is mixed with the P. montana material on the specimen housed at Kew, and in 1897 Phillips also (briefly) misidentified a Kew specimen of P. scabriuscula as P. montana. ==Distribution== Protea montana is endemic to the Western Cape province of South Africa. It is found in the Swartberg and Kammanassie Mountains. The extent of occurrence (the total area of the region in which it might be found) is 1447 km2, but the amount of area it actually occupies, the area of occupancy, is only 112 km2. Only occurring near mountain summits, the different population fragments are scattered throughout the range, especially being fragmented in the Kammanassie Mountains. The spatial distribution is as solitary plants found sporadically in the landscape. ==Ecology== The mature plants are killed by the periodic wildfires which pass over their range, but the seeds can survive such an event. The blooms are produced from February to June. The florets are pollinated by rodents. The seeds are stored in the old, dry, fire-resistant infructescence, and are released from them after two years, after fires have passed through the land. The seeds are dispersed by means of the wind. In 1829 Dr√®ge originally collected it growing in rocky locations, together with the other plant species Restio laniger, Seriphium plumosum, Leucadendron dregei, and a Sorocephalus, Erica, Hoplophyllum and Calopsis of some kind. ===Habitat=== It is found on mountain tops and their steep upper slopes, between 1,600 and 2,000 metres in altitude. It occurs in montane fynbos habitat in sandstone-derived substrates, on south-facing slopes. ==Gallery== File:Protea montana nicky iNat37819467a.jpgdeveloping inflorescence File:Protea montana rebeccaryan iNat 39755290b.jpgflower heads File:Protea montana rebeccaryan iNat 39755299b.jpgflower heads ==Conservation== It is rare. Threats to its continued survival are the planting of trees (afforestation), invasive plants and a wildfire management regime which is too frequent to allow the plants time to mature and set seed. In 2005 Bomhard et al. predicted, based on their reading of models projecting the effects of climate change, that 30% of the population of the time would be extirpated by 2020, which would then qualify the species for upgrading its conservation status from 'not threatened' to 'vulnerable' according to the IUCN conservation status standards. Bomhard et al. argued that the projected possibility of future population reduction should go to counting as actual population reduction in the present, and that species which their computer model had so designated (223 of 227) should be upgraded as much rarer. In 2009 the South African National Biodiversity Institute complied with this, and formally assessed the conservation status of the species for the Red List of South African Plants as 'vulnerable'.
