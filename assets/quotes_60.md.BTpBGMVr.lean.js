Most admired for his accomplishment in calligraphy, he is also a popular cultural figure for his uninhibited lifestyle and iconoclastic thinking. He criticized the orthodox Neo-Confucianism of Zhu Xi and admired the philosophy of mind advocated by Wang Yangming. He wrote a large number of essays that criticize traditional values, and was an influence on the iconoclastic philosopher Li Zhi. Biography Zhu's calligraphy: Banquet Poem of Ji Kang Zhu was born in 1461 in Changzhou County, modern Suzhou, Jiangsu Province. His courtesy name was Xizhe (), and art name Zhishan (). Born with a supernumerary thumb on one hand, Zhu gave himself the sobriquet \\"Zhizhi Scholar\\" (ÊûùÊåáÁîü; zhizhi refers to preaxial polydactyly in Chinese).According to Dictionary of Ming Biography, 1368‚Äì1644, Zhu had an extra thumb on his left hand, but in Qian Qianyi's account, it was on his right hand, see Qian's Liechao Shiji Xiaozhuan He was said to have been able to write calligraphy with large characters at the tender age of four and compose poetry by the age of eight. He became a certified student at 16, and succeeded in the provincial examination of 1492, but never passed metropolitan examinations. Zhu was appointed as the county magistrate of Xingning, Guangdong, in 1514. He served as the principal editor of the Gazetteer of Xingning County (in the reign of Zhengde), during his five-year term. In 1521, he was promoted to Controller-General of Yingtian Prefecture (modern Nanjing). He resigned in less than a year on a plea of illness. He dedicated the rest of his life to writing and died in 1527. Together with Tang Yin, Wen Zhengming and Xu Zhenqing, Zhu was one of the \\"Four Talents of Wu (Suzhou)\\" (), his calligraphy is the most noted in the quartet. He excelled at small standard script (xiaokai), but was of wild-cursive (kuangcao) fame. His friends attributed his affinity for this highly expressive calligraphy to his impetuous personality. Zhu was also known as an unorthodox thinker against Neo-Confucianism. In his later life, he described himself as a \\"wild man\\". He finished various collections of miscellaneous notes. Some scholars believe that his work of judgements on historical personalities influenced Li Zhi's Cang Shu. In popular culture Zhu's wild-cursive calligraphy: first part of Tao Yuan Tu, original poem by Han Yu Zhu's nonconformist thinking and lifestyle have made him a subject of popular legends.

During a protest against mining operations, officers of the Gambia Police Force used live ammunition, firing on protesters. Two were killed instantly, with a third dying two days later. A number of other protestors and police officers were injured during the confrontation.  Background  In 2018 in the town of Faraba Banta, 50km south of Banjul, a contract was awarded to the Julakey Company to conduct sand mining operations in the area. Accusations were leveled that the contract had been awarded without consulting the local village council and stakeholders in the project. The week prior to the shooting, the National Assembly's Committee on the Environment had ordered the Julakey Company to cease operations pending the outcome of an investigation into their operations. However, due to complications in communications, by the day of the incident the company had yet to receive an official letter from the committee asking them to do so.  Incident  On 18 June 2018, a number of angry local residents took to the streets of Faraba Banta to protest the mining company. Parts of the protest turned violent, and five trucks that were loading sand in the mining area were set on fire by Faraba youths. Youths were also seen targeting compounds belonging to Bo Jarju, Ba Jambang Sanyang, Bakary Saidy, and Nuha Kujabi, among others, who had all been involved in the mining operations. Their house materials were removed and set on fire. A detachment of the Gambia Police Force's Police Intervention Unit (PIU) was dispatched to deal with the protest. The protesters clashed, and a number of PIU officers sustained injuries. These were later named as Modou Dem, Alie Camara, and Momodou Jallow. Camara was identified as the PIU officer who fired live ammunition at the protesters. Bakary Kujabi and Ismalie Bah were killed instantly. Amadou Nyang-Jawo, a student at The Gambia College, was hospitalised at the Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital in Banjul. Masanneh Njie, Salaman Darboe, Jalaman Darboe, Pa Jammeh, Sainey Sonko, Sheriffo Touray, Dawda Daffeh, Buba Sanyang, and Francis Jambang were all injured in the clash and taken to Brikama Major Hospital. Nyang-Jawo died in hospital on 20 June, having previously been in a critical state.  Responses   Activists and human rights organisations  Mustapha Camara, a youth leader from Faraba and eyewitness to the incident, tearfully condemned the killing of unarmed youths by the PIU. He called on the government to launch an immediate investigation. Two international human rights organisations, the Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa (IHRDA), and Article 19, called on the government to investigate the shooting via an independent investigation.  Police  Following the incident, Landing Kinteh, the Inspector General of Police, denied giving police officers the authority to use live ammunition during the incident. He released a statement saying that his office \\"will investigate the circumstances that led to this unfortunate incident.\\" On 21 June, Kinteh resigned from his role as Inspector General, under pressure to allow through an independent investigation. His deputy, Alahagie Mamour Jobe, took over the role in an acting capacity.  Government  The day after the incident, the office of President Adama Barrow released a statement saying that he was \\"deeply saddened\\" by the reports. He had ordered a thorough investigation into the matter as soon as possible. He called for \\"calm and restraint\\" and also issued a directive for all mining activities to be suspended until further notice. In the week following the incident, Barrow appointed a presidential commission of enquiry, appointed a coroner, and visited victims in the Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital. On 22 June, Barrow visited the town of Faraba. He led the Friday prayer before speaking, saying \\"It is not only Faraba Banta that is in mourning, but the entire country is in shock and mourning.\\"  Investigation  Five police officers involved in the shooting, including two superintendents, were taken into custody by the police. On 21 June, it was announced that Barrow had appointed a commission of enquiry into the incident, to be chaired by human rights lawyer Emmanuel Joof. The commission would have five other members, consisting of a representative from the Ministry of Justice, the Gambia Bar Association, the Gambia Armed Forces, the State Intelligence Services, and The Association of Non-Governmental Organisations (TANGO). On 6 July, the members of the commission were sworn-in by President Barrow, and were as follows: * Emmanuel Joof, chairman, human rights lawyer * Neneh M. C.

P. and written by Vini Vishwa Lal. The film stars Tovino Thomas, Samyuktha Menon, Sudheesh, Surabhi Lakshmi, Rajesh Sharma, Suraj Venjarammoodu, Saiju Kurup, and Shammi Thilakan. Principal photography began in November 2017 and ended around January 2018. Kailas Menon composed the music and Appu Bhattathiri was the editor. The film was released on 7 September 2018.  Plot  Damodaran, a resident of the fiction village of Pullinad, is unable to transport his pregnant wife to the hospital due to heavy rain and the rebellion following the murder of Rajiv Gandhi. His wife's brother, referred to as Ammavan by the protagonist and his friends, arranges for a midwife. Damodaran is initially against it but later agrees. Unfortunately, the child is stillborn, and this devastates Damodaran. He places the lifeless child on a table and goes to see his wife whose condition has worsened. Ammavan, a chain smoker, blows smoke at the seemingly dead child, which causes it to begin breathing. The child is named Bineesh. As a child, Bineesh buys cigarettes for his uncle using his allowance. When he becomes a teenager, he is prompted by his friend Safar to smoke a cigarette and eventually becomes addicted. Due to a foolish statement made by Safar, Bineesh is caught in the school for smoking and is asked to bring his parents. He decides to bring his uncle instead. That night, while he is going to meet his uncle, he sees a packet of cigarettes and chooses to smoke one. He heads outside and smokes peacefully. However, he is mistaken for a thief by two police constables and is taken to the police station; consequently, people learn about his secret. As time passes, he becomes more and more addicted and receives the title of Theevandi (chain-smoker, colloquially). His elder sister eventually is married to Vijith, a BSCL (Bharatiya Socialist Congress League) party member while Bineesh falls in love with his childhood friend Devi. Devi is the daughter of Madhu, an active BSCL member. He is against the relationship of his daughter with Bineesh but later relents on the condition that Bineesh reduces his smoking. Devi belongs to a different caste that is accustomed to a different thaali, a holy thread tied around the bride's neck that signifies marriage. Bineesh purchases it, and Devi asks him to show it to her father. After forgetting several times, he decides to bring the thaali in a cigarette packet, which he is sure he will not forget. Devi's heart is broken on seeing the thaali inside the cigarette packet, and this leads to their breakup. Meanwhile, Ammavan and Safar are shown to frequently visit Edison Thuruthu (Edison's Island) which is hinted at being a haven for drunkards and hippies. Bineesh is frustrated and decides to smoke sixteen packets of cigarettes at a time, setting a new world record. The MLA's Nepali driver, Sanju, gives the money for the cigarettes, confusing everyone. One day, while driving the car with the MLA, it is revealed that the driver is a victim of the Blue Whale Challenge and is about to commit suicide as his fiftieth and final task. The car crashes into the building where Bineesh is smoking the cigarettes, Bineesh is shown smoking. The MLA falls into a coma while the driver manages to escape. Later that night a tiff happens over the nomination of a BCSL candidate for the by-election. Since the MLA is in a coma, they feel that there is no chance of recovery. The majority chooses Madhu while Bineesh demands to nominate his brother-in-law Vijith. Bineesh, who hates Madhu, does not want him to be the candidate. Madhu is an equally clever person and challenges Bineesh to abstain from smoking until a particular day when the party will organize a widespread protest in the village by forming a human chain. Madhu promises Bineesh that if he succeeds in this, he will renounce his claim to the nomination and let Vijith be the sole nominee. Bineesh accepts the challenge. Madhu hires a network of spies to follow Bineesh. A few of them are asked to stay in his house and try to make him smoke. Bineesh is able to refrain from smoking for the first few days, but soon his body begins to react. One night he sneaks out of the house to smoke a cigarette. Libash, Madhu's spy, notices this and climbs a nearby tree to capture a video of Bineesh smoking. Luckily for Bineesh, there happens to be a giant snake on that tree which startles Libash, and he falls down before Bineesh lights his cigarette. Libash is taken to the hospital, and Madhu's spies accompany him. Vijith finds the cigarettes and decides to take Bineesh to Edison thuruthu. Madhu discovers this and informs his party members. When Vijith returns to the banks after dropping Bineesh in the island, he puts on an act in front of the party members and takes a spy of Madhu to Edison thuruthu. Meanwhile, Bineesh finds that he has been cheated since Edison thuruthu is actually devoid of drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes. It is inhabited by two hippie-like musicians, Rasputin and Bob Marley. They moved to the island because they were unable to put up with politics in Pullinad. Bineesh is unable to leave the island since he cannot swim. Safar hires a group of goons to guard the island and wards off Madhu's men who try to smuggle cigarettes to the island on the pretext of meeting Bineesh. After several such failed attempts by Madhu's men, he approaches Libash for an idea. The person who is nursing Libash arranges a group of young men who are practitioners of Kalaripayattu. On the last day, the day of human chain formation, Libash goes with the group and thrashes the goons guarding the banks and reaches the island on a boat. Upon arrival, Libash prompts Bineesh to smoke an imported cigarette. By now, Bineesh has learnt to love the world without cigarettes. He refuses the cigarette and thereby wins the challenge. Vijith is happy, but at the last minute the MLA's returns in a wheelchair to inaugurate the event, thereby shattering the dreams of Vijith. Vijith slips into smoking, thereby becoming a new companion for Ammavan. Bineesh and Devi reunite and decide to start a new life.

Its unit were co-owned at the time of its closing by American Electric Power (AEP) and AES Ohio Generation. All plant operations were handled by AEP. Conesville began operations in 1957 and ceased generation in April 2020. History Construction of Unit 1 began in 1955 and was commissioned by Columbus & Southern Ohio Electric (a forerunner of AEP). Unit 1 began commercial generation in 1957 while Unit 2 began operations two years later in 1959. Both units cost $36 million to construct and generated 125 MW each. Unit 3 began operations in 1962 with a generation capacity of 165 MW. Unit 4 began operations in 1973 with a generation capacity of 780 MW. At the time of its conception, the unit would be jointly owned by Cincinnati Gas and Electric (CG&E;) (a forerunner of Duke Energy), Columbus & Southern Ohio Electric, and DP&L.; Units 5 and 6 began operations in 1976 and 1978 respectively. Over the years, Units 5 and 6 have increased electrical generation from 375 MW to 405 MW. In 2014, Duke Energy sold its stake in Conesville to Dynegy. Three years later in 2017, Dynegy sold its stake in Conesville in a swap with AEP for a stake of William H. Zimmer Power Station. At the time of its closure in 2020, DP&L; held a minority ownership of Unit 4 with AEP. Environmental mitigation With the installation of Unit 4, electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) were installed to prevent fly ash from going into the atmosphere. ESPs were later installed to Units 1-3 in the mid-1970s. Unit 4 also had cooling towers constructed which resulted in zero discharge into the Muskingum River. In 2009, Unit 4 would receive the installation of flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) equipment along with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system to meet the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) and Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR). The $450 million project for Unit 4, saw the construction of an smokestack for the FGD equipment. After it was installed, inspectors found corrosion. AEP settled with Black & Veatch, the contractor who installed the FGD equipment, to address the corrosion. When Units 5 and 6 went into operation, $52 million in scrubber technology were installed to reduce sulfur dioxide () emissions, but it operated inefficiently. The scrubber was eventually upgraded in 2008. In the summer of 2001, Unit 6 was the test site for Thermal Energy International's THERMALONOx. The THERMALONOx was intended to show that nitrogen oxide () emissions would be reduced by 70%. Unfortunately, the demonstration was halted in September 2001 after the \\"system did not appreciably reduce nitrogen oxide () emission levels.\\" Operations When the first unit went into operation, it was projected that Conesville would use between 300,000 to 400,000 short tons of coal each year. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the plant received 1,716,286 short tons of coal in 2017. All of the coal was shipped from mines within Ohio. Conesville used to employ 600 workers. In 2018, only 165 were employed at the plant. Retirement Units 1 and 2 were retired in 2005 after Unit 1's tubing to its boiler failed. Inspections on Unit 2 revealed severe corrosion in a pattern that was similar to Unit 1. The reported cost of $35 million to repair both units was not worth the benefit of returning to service. Unit 3 was retired in December 2012 in order to comply with the Environmental Protect Agency (EPA) rules regarding mercury, lead, and other toxic emissions. AEP announced in October 2018 they will shut down Conesville by May 2020. Units 5 and 6 retired on May 31, 2019 while Unit 4 remained in operation until April 2020. The decision to close the plant was due to operational costs, not clearing PJM Interconnection's capacity auction, and AEP unable to find a buyer. Incidents In February 1982, two protestors from Greenpeace climbed up one of Conesville Power Plant's smokestacks to protest against acid rain. The protestors spent three days on top of the smokestack. They were charged with criminal trespass. The judge fined both protestors $250 and were sentenced to three days in jail. In July 2004, a tank exploded burning two workers. They would later die from their injuries. AEP determined the cause was due to a sudden release of molten slag that overpressured the tank.

The outbreak resulted in an official total of 643 deaths, out of a population of 15,000. However, the official figures are considerably lower, as only Fever Hospital deaths were recorded. Background The outbreak was part of a second worldwide pandemic caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae and lasted from 1829 to 1851. The approach of the cholera epidemic was well documented at the time, but how it was spread was a mystery. In the first pandemic, the disease was first noted in India, Moscow, Russia in 1830, Finland and Poland in 1831, and Great Britain in 1831. It struck first at the ports, and Sligo was the second busiest port on the west coast at the time after Limerick. Overall, the outbreak killed at least 50,000 people in Ireland. Cholera killed those infected within hours, usually less than three, and almost certainly less than twelve. Victims skin often showed a bluish tinge, and diarrhoea led to rapid severe dehydration and death. Outbreak The only surviving medical report is by a Dr. Irwin, then attached to the Fever Hospital The first case of Cholera Asiatica (as it was known then) was noted at Rathcarrick, three miles from the town by a Dr. Coyne on Sunday 29 July. More cases then appeared at Culleenamore, suspected to have been spread by bathers. Dr. Coyne later died of the disease himself. The Board of Health had the houses of the poor whitewashed and cleaned inside and out. Tar barrels were left burning in the streets in an effort to fumigate the air. Attempts to set up extra medical facilities in the town were resisted by the townspeople, as nobody wanted the infected to be anywhere near them. People armed with clubs and sticks resisted doctors and hospitals being among them. In many cases, doctors themselves were blamed for the outbreak. The outbreak began in Sligo town on 11 August 1832, with the first official figures for Sligo town being released by Dublin Castle on 18 August. These recorded 63 new cases, 22 deaths and no recoveries. From then until the end of the month the death toll averaged fifty a day. The Fever Hospital was used for the sick, but most of the orderlies fled through fear of the plague or the mob. Mr. Fausset, the Provost of the town, described the grounds of the Fever Hospital covered in corpses and no-one to bury them. He said he felt as if the \\"end of the world had come\\". Carpenters were unable to keep up with the demand for coffins and so mass graves were dug instead. and local legend suggests that people were buried alive, so great was the haste to dispose of the corpses. An unofficial quarantine cordon was set up around the town through which no one was allowed to pass, but they were driven back to the town. Efforts to understand the source of the infection included the flying of kites to see if it had an atmospheric origin. Wells were tested. At the height of the outbreak the population was reported by the Evening Post to have dropped from 15,000 to 2,000, most having fled to the countryside. Aftermath The official number of cases was recorded as 1,230, with 643 deaths, although the real toll is suspected to have been considerably higher as many did not report being ill and there was a widespread reluctance to go to a hospital. It was thought that the actual death toll was more than 1,500 people. The population of the town dropped from 15,000 to 12,000. Charlotte Blake Thornley's account Charlotte Blake Thornley, the mother of Bram Stoker was a witness to the cholera outbreak as the family were living on Gaol Street in the town at the time. They survived by fleeing to Ballyshannon having to break the cordon to do so. She wrote a vivid account of the beginning and aftermath of the outbreak. It is believed that her descriptions of the events at the time were influential on themes and atmosphere of her sons most famous book, Dracula.

The film stars Mark Wahlberg, Winston Duke, Alan Arkin, Iliza Shlesinger, Bokeem Woodbine, Donald Cerrone, Marc Maron, and Post Malone and marks the fifth collaboration between Wahlberg and Berg after Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon, Patriots Day, and Mile 22. The film was announced in 2018 as an adaptation of the 2013 novel Robert B. Parker's Wonderland by author Ace Atkins, and was released on March 6, 2020, by Netflix. Plot Boston police detective Spenser arrives with his partner, Driscoll, to the home of Captain John Boylan. While questioning Boylan about concerns he had regarding the murder investigation of a woman named Gloria Wiesnewski, Spenser catches sight of Mrs. Boylan's bloody face and reacts violently, beating Boylan senseless. Spenser is brought up on multiple charges as a result of this incident, to which he pled guilty, and was sentenced to prison for his actions. During his time incarcerated in MCI Cedar Junction, Spenser studies to become a truck driver and, after five years he is released from prison. Shortly before his release, Spenser is assaulted in the prison library by three fellow inmates in an attempt to warn him to leave Boston and never return. Spenser is met outside the prison by his friend Henry Cimoli, who came to pick him up, though his ex, Cissy, puts in a surprise appearance, and he flees the scene with Henry to avoid her. The duo drive to Cimoli's residence in South Boston where Spenser is reunited with his former partner, Driscoll, and Spenser's dog Pearl. Spenser takes up residence in Henry's home with his roommate, Hawk, while he prepares for his new career and a planned move to Arizona. At night, Boylan is driving while talking to his daughter over the phone, when he gets a second call summoning him to a mysterious meeting at a bus yard. Boylan continues his conversation with his daughter, helping her with her homework, and upon his arrival at the yard an SUV intentionally collides with his car. Boylan is then dragged from the vehicle by hooded men armed with machetes and murdered, with his daughter a helpless witness via the car's handsfree mobile phone capability. The next morning, Detective Terrence Graham is discovered dead with a gunshot wound to the head in his SUV (the same SUV used to ram Boylan's car) by his wife, Letitia, upon her arrival home from work. Spenser and Henry learn about Boylan's death on television shortly before Driscoll and his partner arrive at the residence to question him about his possible involvement in the murder given their history and the coincidental timing on the evening of Spenser's release. Henry provides Spenser with an alibi and cites Hawk as another witness who can verify Spenser's presence during the time of the murder. Driscoll's partner expresses his dismay at Driscoll's easy acceptance of Spenser's alibi and challenges Spenser, telling him that the District attorney would easily dismiss the alibi if evidence came up to implicate him. Spenser goes to his truck driving class and then meets up with Henry and Hawk at the gym where he agrees to aid Henry with Hawk's training. Cissy, who has been trying to track Spenser down constantly since his release, shows up and confronts him, only to break up with him. Upon their return home, a news report implicating Detective Graham in Captain Boylan's murder and the emotional response of his wife Letitia inspires Spenser to investigate the murder due to his past acquaintance with Terrence and his belief that Terrence was unlikely to commit suicide. Spenser meets up with Letitia and questions her about the night of the murder, before heading to a local police bar where she said Graham had been the night of the murder and meeting with Scotty Traylor, Terrence's partner. Traylor confirmed Letitia's story and Spenser's suspicion that Terrence had suspected Boylan of being dirty. After getting into a brawl with Sergeant Macklin and three other officers and being thrown out of the bar, Spenser gains access to the CCTV footage from the convenience store across the street where he observed Terrence getting into a yellow Corvette while a pair of unknown individuals got into his SUV and followed the Corvette. The next day, Spenser visits the crime scene at the bus yard where he discovers a toothpick on the ground similar to the ones Driscoll often chews on, he then heads to Driscoll's gym where he asks him about the murder case without mentioning the toothpick, and Driscoll attempts to dissuade him from digging into the case, asserting that it was an open-and-shut case, and denying having even been to the crime scene rousing Spenser's suspicion. After lunch with Hawk, and a bathroom encounter with Cissy, Spenser conducts an abortive foot chase of a Corvette similar to the one they saw on the CCTV footage, only to be attacked by a dog. Luckily, Hawk was able to catch the license plate number of the car which a contact of Spenser's at the RMV traces the ownership back to Charles Bentwood, a name Spenser recognizes from the Wiesnewski case and who has links to the Trinitarios. Spenser, Henry, and Hawk begin surveillance of Bentwood and observe him making a hand off to Macklin where they discover that an FBI team led by Agent Louisa Burton is also surveilling the hand off. A conversation with Hawk leads Spenser to return to MCI Cedar Junction to question Squeeb, one of the men who attacked him just prior to his release, where he's given a clue that led him to Wonderland Greyhound Park, the site of a future casino development where he's escorted off of the property. Driscoll and Macklin have a conversation at Boylan's funeral about the state of affairs, and decide that killing Spenser is necessary, and a group of thugs armed with machetes attempt to kill him at a local restaurant, only to be rescued by Hawk. Knowing that Henry's house is no longer safe, Spenser calls Cissy to secure a place for Henry, Hawk, and himself to stay for a few days. In the interim, Letitia‚Äôs apartment has been tossed. She calls Spenser for help, and when he shows up she provides him with a recording that Terrence had mailed to her on the day he was killed. The recording, of a meeting between Terrence and Boylan, confirms that Boylan was a dirty cop, that the Trinitarios were doing business with Bentwood, who worked for Macklin, who worked for Driscoll. Spenser confronts Driscoll outside of his house and offers him the chance to turn himself in, which he declines, before bringing the tape to Agent Burton who deems it insufficient evidence to act upon. Spenser tracks down Bentwood at the nail salon he frequents and violently interrogates him resulting in Bentwood's confession that there‚Äôs a shipment of drugs coming from New Hampshire to Wonderland that very day in a refrigerator repair van. Spenser and Hawk find the van and force it off the road by throwing a sledgehammer off of an overpass, then take down two of the three gang members inside with the third escaping on foot. They uncover the shipment packed inside of gas cylinders in the back, and bring the van back to Cissy's when Spenser's reporter contact declares the drugs themselves to be insufficient evidence. Shortly after their arrival, Cissy reveals that Henry had gone home and Spenser gets a video call from Henry's phone from Driscoll. Driscoll demands a meeting with Spenser, threatening to kill Henry if he doesn't comply, telling Spenser to meet him at Wonderland in an hour with the drug shipment over Henry's protests. Spenser, Hawk, and Cissy resolve to go together and Cissy drives Henry's car into Wonderland where Driscoll and the Trinitarios are gathered on the track in and around several large SUVs. Cissy escorts him to safety by the infield wall before Spenser and Hawk arrive in a Peterbilt truck and plow through the gang members' vehicles. Driscoll flees into the race track's old clubhouse and Spenser pursues him, culminating in a brawl between the two of them that results in Spenser performing a citizen's arrest making use of Driscoll's own cuffs to subdue him. They pile all of the drugs and other evidence on the infield and leave Driscoll, Bentwood, and Macklin restrained nearby and streaming the arrival of the police and FBI via a cell phone they left behind on a tripod. In the aftermath, Terrence Graham is posthumously cleared of all charges and an apology issued to his family, Spenser and Hawk are declared heroes, the casino project funded by the activities of the Trinitarios and the dirty cops is shut down, Boylan and Driscoll are charged in Weisnewski's murder, and Driscoll is convicted and sent to prison. As the movie closes, Spenser sees a news report at a restaurant reporting on a church fire of two years prior for which a Boston fire chief is under arrest, though he protests his innocence and begs for help. Spenser recognizes him as a man he went to high school with, Henry desperately demands that someone change the channel while Cissy attempts to forbid him from getting involved as Spenser says nothing, with the implication that he's turning things over in his mind.

Parker's Wonderland, a novel based on Robert B. Parker's character Spenser which was written by Ace Atkins as a continuation of the original series authorized by Parker's estate. The movie was announced to be released directly to streaming on Netflix. The film was produced by Neal H. Moritz, Stephen Levinson, Mark Wahlberg, and Peter Berg through their respective production companies Original Film, Leverage Entertainment, Closest to the Hole Productions and Film 44. During the autumn of 2018, Winston Duke, Post Malone, Alan Arkin, Iliza Shlesinger, Bokeem Woodbine, James DuMont, Marc Maron Michael Gaston, and Colleen Camp joined the cast of the film. The script was a collaborative effort penned by Sean O'Keefe and Brian Helgeland and filming began late in 2018 in Boston. The residence of character Cimoli was filmed in the Jones Hill neighborhood of Boston, on the street where actor Wahlberg lived during his teenage years, while Raynham Park, another former greyhound racing track, stood in for the demolished Wonderland Greyhound Park. Music The film score was composed by Steve Jablonsky, who has worked with director Peter Berg on previous films. The soundtrack was released by BMG. Release The film was released by Netflix on March 6, 2020. At their Q1 meeting in April 2020, Netflix reported 85 million households watched the film over its first six weeks of release. Reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 38% based on 77 reviews, with an average rating of 4.70/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"While the buddy cops at the center of Spenser Confidential are plenty affable, the comedy never arrives as this half-hearted vehicle goes purely through the motions.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Elisabeth Vincentelli of the New York Times criticized the film's deviation from its source material, observing that there was \\"almost no resemblance to the Ace Atkins novel Robert B. Parker‚Äôs Wonderland ... aside from the Boston location, the main characters‚Äô names and something or other about an abandoned dog- racing track.\\" Daniel Woburn of the online entertainment news website Screen Rant elaborated further on this disparity, noting many differences in characterization from the series as a whole and calling out the plot, in particular, as deviating heavily from the original novel with the biggest common thread between them being the finale at the race track.

It is his second book in the Jack Ryan Jr. series, which is part of the overall Tom Clancy universe. In the novel, Ryan has to avert a sinister plot by Serb extremists to provoke war between NATO and the Russians in the Balkans. It debuted at number three on the New York Times bestseller list. Plot summary In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Al Qaeda in the Balkans leader Tarik Brkiƒá, who is of Chechen descent, is tasked by his mysterious benefactor Red Wing to orchestrate false flag attacks on Croats, Bosniaks and Serbs in order to disrupt the Unity Referendum, an upcoming national gathering which aims to promote equality among the three rival ethnic groups. At the same time and without Red Wing's knowledge, Brkiƒá also plans to provoke the Russians, who happen to be staging a military exercise nearby, into military action in the Balkans by arranging a terrorist attack, which would then incite the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to intervene, resulting in a new world war. He obtains eighty thermobaric warheads as well as the accompanying missile guidance system, stolen from a Russian armory in Syria and smuggled into the country, for this purpose. Meanwhile, Jack Ryan Jr. goes on an accounting job as a financial analyst for Hendley Associates in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on behalf of a Slovenian company which is looking to register to NASDAQ. Before the trip, he agrees to do a favor for his mother, Dr. Cathy Ryan, in which he will track down Aida Curiƒá, her mother‚Äôs former patient, in the nearby city of Sarajevo in Bosnia. Aida, a Bosnian Muslim who escaped from her country during the Bosnian War, had her eyes cured by his mother twenty- five years ago. After finishing his accounting job a week later, Ryan explores the city, especially the Triglav National Park, where he narrowly survives a murder attempt by a tourist known as Elena Iliescu. Unbeknownst to him, Iliescu is an assassin sent by a secret crime network called the Iron Syndicate, whose leader, Vladimir Vasilev, wanted Ryan, as well as ex-senator Weston Rhodes, eliminated as revenge for the death of his colleague Tervel Zvezdev (depicted at length in Point of Contact). Rhodes was later killed in his prison cell. Ryan informs his boss Gerry Hendley about the incident, who later learns about Iliescu‚Äôs connection to the Iron Syndicate from further investigation by Hendley Associates/The Campus head of IT Gavin Biery. He then sends The Campus to Europe in order to try to interrogate Iliescu; however, they find out that Elena was dead from a heart attack, silenced by the Iron Syndicate. After being questioned by the Slovenian police about the incident, Ryan proceeds to Sarajevo to track down Aida. Initially failing in his efforts, he prepares for his flight back to the U.S. when Aida herself shows up in his rented apartment. Instantly smitten by her beauty, Ryan postpones his flight for a few more days and spends time with her, exploring most of Bosnia through a popular tour service that she owns; he even volunteers in a refugee agency that she also holds. They get into a fling for a few days. On the last night of his stay in Bosnia, Ryan and Aida encounter what Aida says are corrupt Serbian police officers (in fact they are Russian undercover agents searching for the stolen warheads). They manage to incapacitate them, which leads Ryan to believe something is amiss. The next day, Ryan survives another murder attempt from an Iron Syndicate assassin in his rented apartment. He finally relents to Hendley‚Äôs persistent pleas and is about to fly home to the U.S. when he witnesses a plane being shot down by a surface- to-air missile, killing everyone aboard. Worried about Aida, he goes to her home, where he was abducted by the woman herself. Aida explains that she is part of her uncle Brkiƒá's conspiracy plot and that she had ordered the attack on the civilian jet in order to kill Ryan, who had become a loose end. She then reveals the impending missile strike, which is on a Serbian Orthodox Church event in Sarajevo's Olympic soccer stadium, as she leaves Ryan under her cousin, who is also involved in the scheme, to prepare for the attack. Eventually, Ryan immobilizes him and escapes. Ryan then tells his boss of the diabolical plot; his father, U.S. President Jack Ryan, his intelligence advisers, the military commanders based in Europe, and the Russian President are also informed. He tracks down Aida all the way to a dark tunnel, where he shoots her dead. He then proceeds to a nearby warehouse, where the forty thermobaric missiles are readied for launch. After informing Hendley of his location and engaging in a fistfight with Brkiƒá's men, Ryan narrowly escapes just before the building is destroyed by a Tomahawk missile ordered by his father. The rest of the rockets are then retrieved by Russian and Bosnian intelligence operatives inside the stadium. It was revealed that Red Wing is the Turkish ambassador to Bosnia. Ryan extracts a confession out of him, which was then uploaded to social media, humiliating him; he is later assassinated in an RPG attack. In the meantime, although Brkiƒá escaped to Stockholm, Sweden, he was later killed in a mugging. Meanwhile, Vasilev was killed by The Campus in Paris, France, where he is recuperating from prostate cancer. Moreover, it was also revealed that the real Aida Curiƒá was killed during the war in Bosnia after her eye surgery, and that the rest of her family was murdered by Bosnian mafia local head and Interpol fugitive Samir Kvr≈æiƒá, who wanted to change identities; the Aida that Ryan knew was actually Sabina, his daughter. The Curiƒá family's tour service was kept, but this time it was also used as a conduit to smuggle drugs, guns, and fugitives into the Balkans; when Samir died, his daughter took his place as the owner.

Faalhttp://eyeafrica.tv/essa-m-faal- appointed-trrc-lead-counsel/, and the chairperson of the 11-strong commission is Lamin J. Sise.  History   Establishment  The process for founding the TRRC was led by the Attorney General, Ba Tambadou. At a press conference on 20 July 2017, Tambadou announced that a draft bill for the establishment of the TRRC had been shared with international experts for review. He also announced that a team, led by himself, would begin a public engagement tour on the bill in August, which lasted from 14 to 24 August. Tambadou then proceeded to table the bill before the National Assembly. On 13 December 2017, the Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRC) Act was passed, and it received presidential assent on 13 January 2018. Barrow appointed academic Baba Galleh Jallow as Executive Secretary of the TRRC with effect from 1 February 2018. Also in February, a call was made for nominations to the TRRC. The job description specified that individuals should be of \\"high moral character and integrity,\\" \\"no criminal record or involvement in past human rights violations,\\" no political party activity, and residency in either the Greater Banjul Area or in the diaspora. In August 2018, Jallow appointed Alagie Barrow as the director of research and investigation for the commission. It was announced that the commission would begin proceedings on 15 October 2018. On 5 October, Abdoulie Janneh, who had previously been announced as the chairperson of the commissioners, stepped down from the role due to scheduling conflicts. Lamin J. Sise, a close confidante of the late UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, was announced to replace him.  Launch  The commission was launched at Dunes Resort Hotel, Kotu Beach, Kololi, on 15 October. It was launched by President Adama Barrow and attended by senior figures including Mariam Jack-Denton, the Speaker of the National Assembly, Hassan Bubacar Jallow, the Chief Justice, and members of the diplomatic corps, the National Assembly, civil society, and international organisations. Barrow noted that the TRRC would be independent, and was the sixth truth commission launched in Africa in its history. Other speakers included Ba Tambadou, the Attorney General, Sherif Kijera of The Gambia Centre for Victims of Human Rights Violations, Fatou Bensouda, the current chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Mohamed Ibn Chambas, the UN Secretary-General's special representative for West Africa, and Miguel de Serpa Soares, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs. Baba Galleh Jallow delivered the vote of thanks.  Staff and commissioners   Staff  A number of job posting were advertised, starting in June 2018, at the commission.

It is a haematophagous (blood-sucking) leech, found in freshwater habitats in Europe. Description The cuticle of T. tessulatum is transparent, olive green or brownish in colour, with larger individuals often exhibiting six longitudinal rows of small yellow spots. This leech is active and frequently changes shape, being up to long when extended. The posterior sucker is broad and conspicuous but the anterior sucker is small, and invisible when the animal is viewed from above. Distribution This leech is found in freshwater habitats in Europe. It is common in the coastal flat parts of Holland which are visited by the waterfowl that act as its hosts. It is uncommon in Britain, where it has a discontinuous range, probably being distributed by movements of its bird hosts. It has also been recorded in North America from a number of locations. Ecology When parasitizing ducks and other waterfowl, T. tessulatum invades their mouths and respiratory passages. At other times, it is free-living in freshwater habitats. The adult broods its egg capsules on its under surface, where there may be as many as two hundred eggs. When the young are ready to emerge, the adult uses its sensilla organs to detect vibrations in the water and will move towards any disturbance that might be caused by a potential host. Suitable hosts are those with body temperatures of between . Although generally nocturnal and negatively phototactic (avoiding light), when the brooding adult is ready to release its young, it may swim in open water in the middle of the day. If it finds a suitable host, it attaches itself with its sucker to the nasal passages, the respiratory tract or inside the mouth. This leech is unique in that the adult attaches to the host but does not itself feed on it; instead, the young that it was brooding transfer to the host to take their first blood meal.

On 10 March Tory chancellor Norman Lamont announced a reduction in betting tax and asked the bookmakers for a voluntary arrangement whereby a fund could be directed to the greyhound racing industry. He had given a clear signal that he expected bookmakers to pay the industry and the British Greyhound Racing Fund was born. This fund relied on the voluntary payments of bookmakers and the big three firms Ladbrokes, William Hill and Corals paid and encouraged smaller bookmakers to participate. The positive was the fact that bookmakers had agreed but the negative was the fact that the payment equated to 0.25%. The proposed payment resulted in the Greyhound Board refusing to agree with a fund that was controlled by the bookmakers. However they would eventually give in and accepted the ¬£1.2 million, which mainly went back into prize money. The National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) released the annual returns, with totalisator turnover at ¬£91,766,414 and attendances recorded at 3,864,288 from 6154 meetings. The 17.5% track tote deduction was ended with tracks now able to choose their own percentage which inevitably resulted in increases; the Greyhound Racing Association and Corals angered patrons by charging 25%, followed by Ladbrokes at 19.7%. Murlens Abbey trained by John Copplestone was voted Greyhound of the Year after winning the Arc, the Edinburgh Cup and the East Anglian Derby. Farloe Melody was voted Irish Greyhound of the Year after winning the 1992 English Greyhound Derby, Easter Cup and Dundalk International. John McGee won the Greyhound Trainer of the Year for the fifth successive year. Tracks Corals sold Powderhall to Eddie Ramsay. Independent track Berwick opened but Aldershot in Tongham closed in November. The debt ridden Brent Walker the owners of William Hill and Hackney Wick Stadium were selling assets in order to avoid administration. News Racing expanded with betting shops allowed to open in the evenings and on Sundays, the first ever Sunday fixture was held at Sunderland featuring the Mailcom Northern Puppy Derby heats. GRA parent company Wembley plc. announced losses of ¬£8m despite a ¬£13m profit in its UK operation. Canterbury play host to a new TV channel called Sportscast and also scrapped eight dog races on evening cards after tote turnover on them drops lower than six dog races. British Breeding shows a significant decrease from 43% to 26% of registered greyhounds and continues to go down. Competitions The best hurdler since Sherrys Prince emerged, a white and brindle dog called Kildare Slippy. The Paddy Hancox trained greyhound had reached the 1991 Grand National final, at Hall Green. He won the 1992 Grand National final by 9¬æ lengths recording 28.52, a new track record. When the time was announced it stunned the crowd because the track record for 474 metres on the flat at Hall Green was 28.56. Kildare Slippy had just jumped five hurdles and completed the circuit four spots (1 spot = 0.01 sec) faster than the existing flat record making it one of the greatest individual runs in history. In addition to the run he broke the track record at Catford setting new figures of 23.73 which was faster than the Scurry Gold Cup final. A 28.09 track record at Powderhall was just nine spots slower than the time set by Murlens Abbey (the eventual greyhound of the year) in the Edinburgh Cup final. He won the Scottish Grand National before he attempted to win the Irish Grand National. Despite a new track record at Shelbourne Park in an incredible 29.18, he missed the break in the final and failed to achieve the triple crown. A Linda Mullins trained hurdler called Deerpark Jim won 31 races form 45 starts and was denied greater success because Kildare Slippy was around the same time. An event called the Reading Masters was inaugurated with the provincial track of Reading offering a first prize of ¬£15,000. Terry Kibble's Dempsey Duke was the first winner. The Scottish Greyhound Derby ended in a win for Glideaway Sam but only because the Irish Derby champion Ardfert Mick, trained by Matt O'Donnell suffered a serious injury when easily set for victory, he passed the line trailing in last and badly lame. Natalie and Nick Savva enjoyed a great year with a 1-2 in the John Humphreys Gold Collar final with Westmead and Westmead Spirit, followed by the Laurent Perrier Grand Prix success of Westmead Darkie. A Laurels 1-2 with Balligari and Right Move was next ending with a St Leger final appearance for Westmead Darkie. Pineapple Lemon defeated Murlens Abbey in the Select Stakes at Wembley providing some reward for a very good year by the Michael Compton trained brindle. Pineapple Lemon had reached a number of finals and broken track records at Sheffield.

On November 30, 2018, Goulbourne released his debut studio album, Stokeley, which includes the songs \\"Faucet Failure\\" and \\"Nuketown\\" featuring Juice Wrld. The album peaked at number 6 on the Billboard 200 chart. Following the success of Stokeley, Goulbourne released only one single in 2019, \\"Carbonated Water\\". In July 2020, he released the single \\"Burn the Hoods\\" alongside a music video on Lyrical Lemonade. Simultaneously, he announced that his second album would release later that year. Musical style Goulbourne has said that his musical production has been most influenced by Busta Rhymes, Missy Elliot, Chief Keef, and Timbaland. Goulbourne has also stated he does not have any main musical influences; \\"I listen to every genre: rap, rock, classical, heavy metal...I listen to Adele sometimes too\\". Personal life As of June 2018, Golbourne lives in Atlanta, Georgia. He had a heart condition which required surgery in March 2018.  Friendships  = XXXTentacion = Goulbourne was close friends with XXXTentacion before they both started rapping. They met in a juvenile center in 2013. Goulbourne said in an interview with Adam22 that he was surprised by X's criminal charges. Whilst in jail, X had taught Goulbourne about different rapping cadences. After the duo were released, they met up with the intention of committing home invasions but instead began releasing music together. The rappers founded the collective Members Only. In 2017, Goulbourne and XXXTentacion embarked on The Revenge Tour with Craig Xen. The tour was postponed following the shooting of XXXTentacion's cousin. By late 2017, the two had parted ways and begun working on their own projects. Around this time, it was insinuated that the two were feuding. At the Rolling Loud Miami festival in 2018, Goulbourne and XXXTentacion were reunited, reaffirming their friendship and brotherhood. On June 18, 2018, XXXTentacion was fatally shot; Goulbourne learned of his friend's death while on Instagram Live and tearfully informed his fans of the rapper's death. = Juice Wrld = In early 2018, Goulbourne befriended rising rapper Juice Wrld. The two went on to collaborate on the track \\"Nuketown\\", which became Goulbourne's highest charting song on the Billboard Hot 100. It was announced that the two were working on a mixtape titled Evil Twins, but the project never released. In 2019, following the release of Juice Wrld's sophomore album, the two embarked on the Death Race for Love Tour together along with Cole Bennett of Lyrical Lemonade. On December 8, 2019, Juice Wrld died from an opioid-induced seizure. Goulbourne reacted emotionally to the news of the rapper's death. Goulbourne was present at Juice Wrld's funeral later that month.  Aftermath  The death of his two best friends in a span of eighteen months had a profound impact on Goulbourne. Following XXXTentacion's death, Goulbourne honored him multiple times during his own concerts; Goulbourne met XXXTentacion's son, Gekyume Onfroy, for the first time in person at a show. Following Juice Wrld's death, Goulbourne vowed to honor both of his fallen friends by being more vocal about his own struggle with mental health, something that both artists were well known for. Controversies =Concert incidents= During a concert at The Fonda Theatre, Los Angeles, on April 11, 2017, Goulbourne was pushed off stage and then assaulted by an associate of rapper Rob Stone. The attack was said to be instigated by an ongoing feud between the two rappers, starting when Goulbourne refused to leave the stage during Stone's opening act. Rob Stone was kicked off the remainder of Desiigner's Outlet Tour. During a concert on August 10, 2018, in Austin, Texas, Goulbourne asked the crowd for a moment of silence for his murdered friend XXXTentacion. An audience member responded, \\"Fuck X, that woman-beating piece of shit!\\" Goulbourne threatened the audience member and told the rest of the audience to \\"fuck his ass up\\", leading to a melee fight. While the crowd was beating the man, Goulbourne played one of XXXTentacion's most popular songs, \\"Look at Me\\" before the venue's security dispersed the disturbance and escorted the man outside of the venue. =Legal issues= In 2014, Goulbourne was sent to a juvenile detention center for possession of marijuana. Goulbourne was arrested for driving with a suspended license, driving without a license, and robbery in August 2016. He was later released on bail.

Since 2017 she has been a member of the national parliament (\\"Bundestag\\"), directly elected as a member for the Darmstadt electoral district (\\"Wahlkreis 186\\").  Early life and education  Astrid Luise Mannes was born into a Protestant family in Hilden, a mid-sized industrial town a short distance to the east of D√ºsseldorf. She grew up in the town, where she attended the Helmholtz-Gymnasium (secondary school), successfully passing her school final exams (Abitur) in 1986. Her degree, for which she studied between 1986 and 1990, embraced history, political sciences and public law. She received her degree in 1991.  Early career  During 1991/92 Mannes worked as a personal assistant to Herbert Czaja who at that time was president (described in at least one source as \\"the controversial president\\") of the Federation of Expellees (\\"Bund der Vertriebenen\\"), an organisation originally formed in 1957 to represent the interests of ethnic German victims of the ethnic cleansing east of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line during 1944-1950. Between 1992 and 2000 she was employed as a research assistant in the then recently relocated Bundestag. During this time she worked both for the CDU/CSU parliamentary group as a whole and for several individual Bundestag members. Between 2000 and 2007 Mannes held a succession of relatively short-term appointments, while keeping in touch with the world of politics. From 2001 till 2003 she was a press spokeswoman for the German Didacta Association (\\"Deutschen Didacta Verband\\"), a lobbying organisation representing businesses involved in education and training. She also found time to work on her doctorate, which she received from the University of Dortmund in 2005. Her dissertation was a biography of Constantin Fehrenbach, a long-forgotten (by many) German chancellor during the early days of German democracy. Political career During 1986/87 Mannes served as chair of the Association of Christian Democratic Students faction in the Bonn Student Parliament. She joined the CDU (party) itself in 1990. Within the party she was involved in various committees. Between 2006 and 2008 she served as district chair of the (CDU) Women's Union in Darmstadt-Dieburg, having by this time moved the centre of her operation upriver to the region south of Frankfurt. In 2007 Mannes put herself forward as a candidate in the mayoral election for M√ºhltal, a small town in the hills to the south of Darmstadt. On 1 July 2007, two days after the much postponed opening of the Lohberg road tunnel, she was elected, taking office on 28 November 2007. She was a popular mayor. On 9 June 2013, she received the votes of 54.9% of participating voters in the subsequent mayoral election. On 27 March 2011 the local party moved her up from place 39 to place 10 on the CDU candidate list for the district council election which, given the strength of party support in the area, meant that she became a member of the district council. She became a member of the CDU Party Executive for South Hesse (Darmstadt region). In the 2017 General Election Mannes stood successfully for election to the national parliament (\\"Bundestag\\"). This time, instead of being elected through inclusion on a regional party list, she was elected directly as the winning candidate for the Darmstadt electoral district (\\"Wahlkreis 186\\"). Her margin of victory was a narrow one: Darmstadt had previously been represented by Brigitte Zypries (SPD) since 2005. In parliament, she serves on the Committee on Education, Research and Technology Assessment. Personal life Mannes is unmarried.

Trinchera Norte invented the chant in the early 1990s to cheer Universitario; it has since been slightly modified by supporters of other football clubs, such as Orlando City SC, D.C. United and Club Universidad de Chile, as well as by the fans of the national teams from Chile, Ecuador, and Peru. The chant's melody is similar to the Portuguese- language cheer Eu Sou Brasileiro (I Am Brazilian), invented in 1949 by the Brazilian teacher Nelson Biasoli. History Universitario's barra brava Peruvian club Universitario's organized football supporters, Trinchera Norte, created the Vamos chant in the early 1990s, originally naming the cheer as Esta Tarde. The chant has also been adapted by supporters of Peru's national team as ¬°Vamos peruanos! (Let's go Peruvians!). During the qualification process for the Russia 2018 World Cup, Peruvians notably sung the chant alongside Argentines disgruntled by the performance of Argentina's national team at the La Bombonera stadium.http://rpp.pe/futbol/seleccion- peruana/video-vamos-peruanos-el-cantico-que-resono-en-la-bombonera- noticia-1080990 Vamos chilenos Don Francisco helped popularize Vamos in 1996 After listening to Universitario's fans singing the chant, the Chilean group Los de Abajo (The Ones From Below), the barra brava of Club Universidad de Chile, adapted the chant to cheer their football club. \\"John Connor,\\" the pseudonym of a leader of Los de Abajo, stated to a reporter of the Santiago newspaper La Tercera that: \\"At the 'U' we began singing [the chant] in 1993, as it seemed to us to be a good tune. And thanks to us, not the Peruvians, it was popularized, because even then Los de Abajo were the biggest barra in the Pacific.\\" Vamos' popularity increased in Chile after Los de Abajo adapted the chant's lyrics to cheer Chile's national team in the qualification process for the France 1998 World Cup, renaming the chant as ¬°Vamos chilenos! (Let's go Chileans!). During the 1996 Chilean telethon for children with developmental disabilities, held at that country's National Stadium, the Vamos chant reached even higher levels of popularity after host Don Francisco, aided by sports journalist Jorge Hevia, slightly changed the lyrics to encourage the fundraiser's completion‚Äîever since then, Vamos is considered the unofficial anthem of Chile's Telet√≥n. In 2010, Keyvan Heydari, journalist for the American nonprofit National Public Radio, listed ¬°Vamos chilenos! as representative of Chile's supporters and one of the \\"battle hymns\\" of the South Africa 2010 World Cup.https://www.npr.org/sections/showmeyourcleats/2010/07/06/128335191/world- cup-chants-cheer-them-on-in-their-language Also in 2010, Chilean musician Rodrigo Medel registered a version of the chant with the Sociedad Chilena del Derecho de Autor (Chilean Copyright Society), but its inscription as a folk song prevents him from receiving royalties.

It was the first station in Western Australia constructed by the Commonwealth of Australia. The station VIP Perth / Fremantle / Applecross had commenced previously, but that station had been constructed by the Australasian Wireless Company under contract to the Commonwealth. The station provided a vital link between VIP and VIZ Roebourne during the daytime (then to VIO Broome and VIW Wyndham and stations further north) and particularly when land telegraph systems failed. Operationally the station's duties remained relatively constant for several decades, being essentially a communications link between the huge numbers of ships that worked on the Western Australian coastline as well as the mail liners that connected Australia to Europe. Organisational changes Organisational control was constantly changing: * initially a possibly unwanted part of the Postmaster-General's_Department, but with officers professionally classed * following the commencement of WW1, informally within the scope of the Defence Department * late in WW1, a reluctant transferee to the Department of the Navy as the Royal Australian Naval Radio Service (RANRS) * after the conclusion of WW1 transferred back to the Postmaster-General's Department * in 1922 bought under the control of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd as it increased its grasp of Australian wireless * in 1928 the hard assets of the coastal radio network formally sold to AWA * Upon commencement of WW2, again the coastal radio network control vested in the Defence Department * in 1946 briefly under the control of the PMG * in 1948 transferred to the newly created Overseas Telecommunications (OTC) Precursors In the early 1900s, Geraldton was essentially a port town and saw many vessels both docking at the port and passing nearby on their way to northern Australia and to Europe. But the coastline was not yet well charted and was littered with many small rocky islands and reefs, all of which presented significant danger to the shipping trade. The proprietors of the Geraldton Guardian were well versed in the problem, its pages regularly reporting lost or damaged ships. Equally, with great forethought, they saw the solution to the problem. Following the sad loss of the SS Windsor, in February 1908 they proposed both additional lighthouses and provision of wireless telegraphy stations along the coastline. Still in July 1909, at the time of the arrival at Fremantle of the first wireless-equipped merchant ship (RMS Mantua), the Geraldton Guardian was advocating for a wireless station for Geraldton. In July 1912 the Commonwealth Meteorologist visited Geraldton investigating a number of weather phenomenon unique to the Northwest coast of Western Australia and noted the benefits arising from a wireless station at Geraldton and foreshadowed the establishment of a continent-circling network of wireless stations. The following month, August 1912, John Graeme Balsille, the Commonwealth Wireless Expert formally announced that the Government was proceeding with the establishment of a network of coastal wireless stations and that Geraldton would be one of the initial locations. The Geraldton Guardian waxed lyrical in its announcement later in the month of August 1912 of the proposed establishment of the Geraldton station. In September 1912, Balsillie was comprehensively interviewed by a journalist from \\"The West Australian\\" and was advised that, following the completion of the capital city stations, priority was now being given to establishment of the WA coastal stations, indeed that the Geraldton station might be commenced as early as three weeks hence. A few days later, the Sunday Times also interviewed Balsillie who reiterated the short timetable proposed for the Geraldton station. The interview demonstrated Balsillie's straightforward and matter-of-fact manner which is precisely how he proceeded with the establishment of the stations. Construction As foreshadowed by Balsillie, initial work soon commenced and the project supervisor W. M. Sweeney arrived in Geraldton at the end of September 1912 and quickly identified the Residency site on Francis street as being the most suitable. Evidently local council was so keen to see the station established that no opposition was raised to the use of the prime site, and materials were already being delivered on site in the first week of December 1912. Construction of the station was proceeding apace towards the end of December 1912 with a team of eight carpenters constructing the 180 foot mast, 21 inches square consisting of Oregon planks steel bolted together. A further interview with Sweeney was published in the Geraldton Express a few days later which provided further detail of the overall construction and layout of the station. It noted that Sweeney was being assisted on site in wireless matters by Mr. Cox and that the mechanical aspects of the construction were being oversighted by Mr. R. D. Munson of the Public Works Department. Early in January 1913, the Geraldton Express noted that work by the Public Works Department was proceeding satisfactorily and estimated that the buildings would be complete in about three weeks' time. Mid January 1913, the new Peak Hill-Nullagine telegraph line was announced as being in service, which led to consideration of the unreliability of the old line & potential risks remaining with the new line. But it was noted that the coastal radio chain being established provided a key alterative route in case of emergencies. When the coastal chain of wireless stations was first announced, the necessary total number of stations was thought to be about 30, being almost every major port in the nation. But as commissioning proceeded, it became clear that the reliable range for the lower power stations was greater than expected. Carnarvon, about 450km North of Geraldton had been nominated as a likely site, but on 11 January 1913 it was announced that Carnarvon would not be established since Geraldton would be able to service Carnarvon's requirements (in conjunction with the land telegraph system). In February 1913, a few months after the fact, the Commonwealth Gazette announced the purchase of Bullivant's Patent Flexible Steel Wire and Bullivant's Galvanized Wire Rigging Rope for VIN as necessary for antenna and mast rigging. In March 1913, further rigging wire was announced as having been purchased for Station VIN. By mid-January 1913, the jury mast essential to raising the transmitting mast had arrived at Geraldton on the Minderoo and that task was set to commence in a matter of days. The main mast was raised to the perpendicular on 18 January 1913. The activity in the heart of the town was a visual spectacle that was not equalled for many years and a number of townsfolk turned out to observe (as reported by the Geraldton Guardian). The report of the activity by the Guardian Express emphasised the nautical flavour added by the eight man sailor gang doing the hard lifting with a liberal spread of maritime dialect as the work progressed: \\"Brace up the top guy\\"; Ay! Ay! Sir!; \\"Ho! Ho! Boy!\\"; \\"Make fast\\"; and finally the mast was \\"Four square to all the winds that blow.\\" The demands on Sweeney's time and resources did not abate but rather increased as the Government relented to local representations and prioritised the Wyndham station for completion also. Sweeney had to juggle available staff and problems with availability of the necessary oregon timbers began to emerge. By mid-February 1913 the mast and buildings were complete. While the transmitting apparatus was not operational, the receivers were installed and reception was obtained from the Perth coastal station and two ships in Fremantle port. In March 1913, the PMG's Department called for tenders for the supply of 2,500 gallons of petroleum for station VIN. This would be a continuing requirement for many years until Geraldton had its own electricity supply and the station could be serviced. The transmitter and all equipment for the station was provided by a 15-h.p. \\"Gardner\\" Oil Engine, direct coupled to a \\"Westinghouse\\" D.C. Generator. The unit was purchased from Noyes Bros. (Melbourne) Propty. Ltd., 499-501 Bourke-street, Melbourne for an amount of ¬£285, as announced in the Commonwealth Gazette of 14 June 1913. There was some competition between the various crews erecting the masts and stations. The record set by the Geraldton crew for mast erection did not last long, being announced on 30 March 1913 as broken by the Esperance team with a time of 5¬Ω hours, though the latter mast was only 160 ft. high, compared to 180 ft. for the Geraldton mast. There had been little progress when two months later in mid-April 1913 it was advised that the promised transmitter still had not been despatched from the Shaw Wireless Works and was still \\"undergoing testing\\" in Sydney. With little more to do pending the arrival of the transmitting apparatus, Sweeney returned to Perth on 4 April 1913. Finally in early May 1913 the transmitter and ancillaries arrived on the Aeon and completion commenced in earnest. On 10 May 1913 it was reported that the transmitter had tested successfully on site and official commencement was imminent. On 12 May 1913, a brief report in the Geraldton Express stated simply that \\"Wireless.‚Äî The wireless station is now ready for public work.\\" The following day the rate of progress in the coastal radio network was well illustrated. When announcing the commencement of the Geraldton station it was also stated that VIR Rockhampton would commence in three days' time, while VIC Cooktown and VIE Esperance would commence the following week. Initial operation Two days after commencement of the station, it was operating commercially, with an underwhelming volume of traffic. Local A. H. du Boulay had the honour of lodging the first commercial radiogram and was rewarded two hours later with a reply from the RMS Malwa. An increase in business volume was foreshadowed following enactment of the Navigation Act. It was noted that VIN appeared to be able to receive ships south of VIP somewhat better than VIP itself. The Commonwealth Gazette of 19 July 1913 advertised vacancies for Officers-in-charge for 12 coastal stations outside the major metropolitan centres. The positions were in the Professional Division following advice by Balsillie and generally reflected superior pay and conditions compared to other telegraphists in the Department. Following the exciting times of station construction and initial operation, ordinary life soon set in and in October 1913 a local resident was complaining about the fire risk of long grass in the station paddock. Towards the end of January, Mr. Lamb, officer in charge of the Geraldton Wireless Station was reported returning from his holiday. In May 1914, Mr. Lamb concluded his period as officer-in-charge of the Geraldton station and was transferred to VIP Perth. He was replaced by Mr. Mortimer. World War I On 3 August 1914 the Minister for Defence notified the imposition of censorship on all radiotelegraphic traffic within the Commonwealth. Following the commencement of World War One in August 1914, the local authorities were quick to point out that the wireless station was both a key target and quite defenceless. A few days later the Geraldton Mayor advised that the WA Premier had communicated to him that the matter of protection of the wireless station had been referred to the military authorities. On 18 August 1914 Lieut. Gibbings received instructions to mount a guard at the wireless station consisting of one officer and 20 men. Unfortunately the military reserve utilised for guard duty were mostly youthful and not fully convinced of the seriousness of their task. Within a week of commencement their shenanigans drew comment in the Geraldton Express. Within a few weeks the station guard had cause to draw bayonets and an intruder was apprehended at the station. Under questioning at the local court it became clear that the culprit was having a psychotic break and he was remanded for medical assessment. Generators supplied power to the station, but these were typically used primarily to charge a bank of batteries for actual equipment operation. Maintaining battery charge was an ongoing issue and significant supplies of sulphuric acid were required to achieve this. A single tender in September 1914 called for 2,490 lbs of sulphuric acid across 10 stations. By November 1914 it became clear that the number of persons at the station was causing a sanitary problem and the matter was brought to the attention of council. Lieut. Everett, the commanding officer of the station guard, sought to keep his men engaged and participation in local sports events were regularly reported. In February 1915, Commander of the guard (Lieut. E. S. Everett) departed for the Osborne School of Instruction and was replaced by Second Lieut. Hutton. On 27 January 1915 Arthur McDonald of the wireless station staff married local girl Rose Ethell at St. John's Church, Geraldton. In March 1915, Mark Mortimer was appointed as Officer-in-Charge at the Geraldton wireless station. Again in April 1915, the tom-foolery of the young guards was cause for comment in the Geraldton Express. The staff of the wireless station recognized their community responsibilities and in April 1915 donated ¬£2 9s. to the Moore Benefit. The brief return to Geraldton in April 1915 of local boy Lieut. Gibbings on leave from the war was cause for joy and direct news of the war in several arenas in the town. Application of the War Precautions Act resulted in minimal news of the wireless stations themselves, but Broome's \\"Nor' West Echo\\" took a broad interpretation and reported on how a merchant ship was able to evade the Emden thanks to news of its movements broadcast by the Broome station. With the sinking of the Emden, the German threat to the Northwest coast was greatly diminished and early in May 1915 it was announced that the wireless guard to the Geraldton wireless station would be demobilised. Two of the wireless station staff, Pell and Hooker, volunteered for war service in June 1915 and were expected to depart the station shortly. A few weeks later it was reported that A. E. Pell would be departing on 9 July for training at the Blackboy Hill camp and thence to the Wireless Troop in Melbourne. Hooker was to follow as soon as a relieving officer was available. A. E. Pell was replaced early in July 1915 by Mr. Broomhill. In September 1915 both A. E. Pell and B. Hooker, having joined the service were still at the signallers camp at Broadmeadows, Victoria training new recruits in the art of wireless telegraphy. The Commonwealth Gazette of 31 August 1916 noted that Clement George Benger Meredith was now the Wireless station Officer-in-Charge. Royal Australian Naval Radio Service The transfer of officers and staff from the Wireless Branch of the Postmaster- General's Department to the Department of Navy was not supported by the personnel. Issues were a loss of professional status, modest loss of pay, loss of general terms and conditions of service and being subject to military discipline. In June 1916 a large deputation of staff met with the Minister for the Navy to air their grievances. In September 1916 A. E. Pell recounted his war experiences by letter to a local friend, noting that after 6 months in Melbourne as a wireless instructor he had been sent to Persia and was presently in a Bombay hospital recovering from fever. A sad and brief report in March 1917 was to effect that Corporal W. Pass, formerly of the wireless station guard had made the ultimate sacrifice in France. The Commonwealth Gazette of 6 September 1917 announced the abolition of the position of Officer-in-Charge, Geraldton wireless station, Postmaster-General's Department (together with all other positions associated with the coastal radio network), associated with the transfer of control to the Royal Australian Naval Radio Service. After much debate and prevarication, the Royal Australian Naval Radio Service was finally created in March 1917 as part of an overall restructure of the Navy, following on from the review by the Naval Board. As a result all pertinent staff of the PMG were transferred to Department of the Navy's RANRS. In August 1917 the impact of the war on the Western Australia coast was diminishing and domestic matters assumed greater attention. Odd noises emanating from the vicinity of the wireless station were variously attributed to secret activities therein. Further enquiry revealed that the offending noise from the wireless station was simply a nearby failing windmill. Another former member of the wireless station guard, Private George Compton, gave the ultimate sacrifice in July 1918. Post World War I Mr H. Selfe, was reported as being on the Wireless Station Staff. The Royal Australian Navy Radio Service was formally disbanded on 28 October 1920. The appointments of all the officers were terminated. PMG control resumes The Commonwealth Gazette of 21 April 1921 announced a partial restructure of the Radiotelegraph Branch including the abolition of the position of Radio Station Master, Geraldton. AWA control Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) was never reticent in claiming records and exceptional performance, and a December 1922 report advised of a record daytime reception by the Geraldton station of the SS Katoomba at sea of over 1100 miles. In June 1923 the Geraldton station was the first to receive messages concerning the loss and subsequent search for the Trevassa. In fact, those first reports from the Geraldton station about the loss of the Trevassa were initially doubted in Perth. But the arrival of the SS Moreton Bay at Fremantle, the ultimate source of the initial reports, quickly dispelled those doubts. Mr. Reginald Charles Goodland was on the staff of the station in 1924 and 1925, then returned to the Perth station. He passed in an accident near VIP and this news was received with sadness by his many friends Geraldton. By the 1920s Australia's capacity for weather forecasting and reporting had greatly improved. The northwest coast of Western Australia regularly saw intense cyclone activity during the summer months of the southern hemisphere and the coastal radio network played a vital role in distributing weather information to coastal shipping. In the April 1926 cyclone, the Geraldton station served both to broadcast weather information from the Weather Bureau to coastal shipping and to collect weather reports from shipping in the region to assist the Bureau in their forecasting and reporting. A secondary role for the coastal radio network was as an emergency alternative telegraphic route when the land telegraph system sustained damage. This occurred in July 1926 when land telegraph lines along coastal Western Australia were severely damaged by storms and the Geraldton wireless station became a vital link in the telegraphic network. The Geraldton station operated with power from its own diesel generator for more than 13 years. Finally the local electricity supply had expanded to the point where it could support the station and it was connected to the town grid in November 1926. Sale of Station to AWA On 2 November 1928 the prospect of agreement by the Commonwealth government to the sale of the coastal radio network to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd. was cause for the firm to postpone its annual general meeting by one month. The Commonwealth Gazette of 8 November 1928 formally detailed the sale of the coastal radio network to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) and listed 17 Australian and 9 Pacific stations. The following week it was formally announced that all of the Australian and Pacific Island stations of the coastal radio network including the cornerstone Applecross station had been sold to AWA for an amount of ¬£39,574. It was confirmed that this was in accordance with the original 1922 agreement between the Commonwealth and AWA. A further statement again detailed the specific list of stations with 17 services in Australia (including the Geraldton station) and a further 9 in the Pacific Islands. The stated reason for the sale was that the stations are no longer required by the Federal Government for any public purpose, but that where necessary, army reservations set out in the Crown grants were withheld. George Franklin Cook had spent some years at the Geraldton wireless station circa 1927, but returned to Fremantle circa 1928. In February 1929 he was gathering firewood with his brother and fell from a tree, sustaining serious injuries. He died at the Fremantle hospital some weeks later. The Abrolhos Islands off the coast of Geraldton displayed both extreme natural beauty and horrific risk to coastal navigation. To explore the possibilities for tourism, Geraldton council despatched a party to visit the islands for ten days in June 1929. Harold Cox was the senior wireless officer at the Geraldton wireless station and accompanied the group, providing wireless communication facilities. AWA dominated the market in Australia for wireless fitout on ships in the late 1920s, and in June 1929 at the time of the maiden voyage of the \\"Westralia,\\" provided a comprehensive summary of its work undertaken which included coastal radio equipment, lifeboat equipment and broadcast band repeaters. Daylight communication with the Geraldton station was established at distance ranging from 800 to 1000 miles. Station modernised By late 1930 the work of the wireless station had expanded to the point where building additions were required and these were approved by council in September 1930. The original 180 ft. timber mast which had served the station faithfully for more than 17 years was by the end of 1930 no longer economically maintainable. It was finally lowered on 6 November 1930. Operation at the station was maintained using a temporary mast for several days until a replacement steel mast was installed the following week. The new mast was of tubular steel and a telescopic design. Despite the improvements in technology over the years, the process of raising the mast using a jury mast and winch was closely similar to the task undertaken in 1913. The work was undertaken by supervising project engineer Sydney Trim and mechanic S. Broomehall. The Marconi School of Wireless was a significant part of the AWA wireless combine and played a major role in training interested individuals for future roles in the Navy and military, as well as wireless operators for shipping and coastal stations, also broadcasting. In more remote areas such as Geraldton, the local coastal station participated in the recruitment and tuition of its students. In February 1931, the wireless station was added to the Council's rate book, no doubt as a result of the change of ownership of the property. In March 1931 there was a change in senior staffing at the wireless station. Mr. H. E. Cox, the officer in charge for some years departed for Sydney. His duties were assumed by Mr. E. H. Smellie who had been at Geraldton for about one year, while Mr. H. B. Wolfe was to assume Smellie's former duties in short order. Sydney Trim, the AWA engineer charged with renovating and upgrading the coastal radio network, returned to Sydney in July 1931 after a two year journey circumnavigating Australia visiting most of the coastal stations. Trim had oversighted the replacement of the VIN mast in November 1930 during that tour. Other projects included VIO Broome (replacement mast, replacement 5kW main transmitter & new emergency transmitter), Cockatoo Island (new wireless telephony system), VIN Geraldton (replacement mast, replacement 2kW main transmitter and new emergency transmitter), VIE Esperance (replacement mast and replacement 2kW main transmitter), VID Darwin (replacement mast, replacement 5kW main transmitter and new emergency transmitter), VIA Adelaide (replacement masts, complete station refurbishment) and VIP Fremantle / Perth (new police communications system). Wolfe's recent arrival was confirmed in July 1931, noting he had previously been at VID Darwin for 3¬Ω years and was much appreciating the change in climate. AWA had rather recently expanded its sphere of operations beyond solely manufacture and retail of broadcast transmitters into ownership and control of individual broadcast stations. 4TO Townsville was to be the newest addition to the group, commencing in October 1931. Harold Cox, recently senior wireless officer at the Geraldton station had been successful in being appointed chief engineer at 4TO. Newman Pusey had been on staff at the wireless station for several years, but in July 1933 received notice of his transfer to VII the Thursday Island station. He was to marry in August 1933 and depart for the north shortly afterwards. It was announced in October 1933 that E. H. Smellie, after some 3¬Ω years at the Geraldton station, had been transferred to VIO Broome and would depart the station in the following month. The coastal radio stations provided generally excellent alternative communication lines during outages of the land telegraph system. But Murphy's law could come to bear and during an outage near Coolgardie in April 1935, when Geraldton wireless was called to assist, it was found that that station itself was unavailable due to a battery recharge being underway. The Geraldton wireless station was fully integrated into the post office telegraphy network which in September 1935 included some 160 stations and 800 substations linked by over 13,000 miles of landlines. The ability to communicate directly with VIP Perth, 24 hours a day, provided invaluable redundancy with the landline network and this capacity was only matched by one other coastal radio station being VIE Esperance. The location of the wireless transmitter within the body of the town was certain to cause blanketing interference to local broadcast receivers due to high levels of radiofrequency signals. But the people of the town seemed to accept the interference as a necessary consequence of this vital service. The residents were less tolerant however of the electrical interference resulting from unsupressed electrical motors in the town and the matter was raised at a Council meeting in March 1936. In July 1938 it was announced that VIO Broome and VIN Geraldton had been fitted with higher power main transmitters. Stated reason was to improve communication between Broome and Perth at times of land telegraph outages, however better communication in the event of war would also have been a factor. World War II Even prior to the declaration of World War 2 in September 1939, the Geraldton militia mounted a guard at the wireless station, emphasising its strategic importance. Security at VIN Geraldton was further enhanced in January 1940 by the passing of the National Security Act which imposed severe penalties for, inter alia, photographing or sketching wireless installations. In August 1940 Mr. R. C. Anderson, wireless officer at VIN Geraldton for the previous four years, received advice of promotion to officer-in-charge of VIO Broome and was to leave Geraldton the following month. December 1940 saw the arrival of C. Lemmon at VIN, having transferred from VIO Broome and he quickly became involved in community activities in Geraldton. The years 1941 through 1944 saw a dearth of information in contemporary publications due to the application of the National Security Act, but increased in mid-1945 as Japanese forces were finally pushed back. Prime Minister Chifley was particularly proud of the part Western Australia played in its defence and again developments in coastal radio were singled out for praise. It was noted that the Geraldton station maintained communications with coastal shipping as well as broader monitoring duties. OTC In February 1947 the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia) assumed control of all external telecommunications services previously operated by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd. This included the entire Australian coastal radio network. From June 1948, the Geraldton station was the key station in a radiocommunications network with 4 smaller stations located at different islands in the Abrolhos Islands. The network was to assist exchange of messages of both a commercial and personal nature with the mainland. The Mangrove Island station of the Abrolhos Island network proved invaluable when the Starling ran aground in Whales Bay in October 1950. Enabling communication with the mainland and rendering of emergency assistance upon his return to Geraldton.

Progress is manually saved after completing each race in either of the three slots available via the cartridge's EEPROM and they are allowed to resume their last race saved at the main menu by pressing C on the controller. The internal memory in the game cartridge also saves high-scores and other settings made by the player. In the single-player mode, players have to compete in a racing season across multiple regions and countries around the world such as England, Finland, Italy, Arizona, France, Sweden, Kenya and Corsica by facing three types of events at the beginning such as special stage, rally cross and skill test in order qualify for the next race and earn funds to keep competing. Special stage events pits the player racing against time while facing multiple obstacles, each one consisting of three-laps, while rally cross events are races against a CPU-controlled opponent and they also consists of three-laps as well. Skill test involves the player testing their driving abilities to start and stop, backing up and other skills in specially designed courses with obstacles against time, which can be penalized if any traffic cone is dropped. Endurance, a fourth type of event is introduced later in the game and involves the player in five-lap races before the time runs out. Failing to qualify for the next race results in the player paying a re-entry fee to try again and the game is over once they run out of money. In some tracks, there are items available to pick-up such as money, stopwatches that freezes time for five seconds and nitrous that gives the player a boost in speed. On night tracks, players have to turn their headlights by pressing 2 on the controller's keypad. Returning from Power Drive is the damage system, where if any component of the car takes too much damage will lead a change in the vehicle's in-game behavior, increasing the difficulty to race on the track and after finishing the race, players can choose or not to repair a specific part of their vehicle. There is also a practice mode where players can test their driving skills on any of the four selectable tracks, each with their own pre- set obstacles and a multiplayer mode where two players race in a head-to-head match on any of the single-player tracks but items are not available.  Development and release  Unlike its predecessor, Power Drive Rally was developed exclusively for the Atari Jaguar by a small team at Rage Software's Liverpool division. Power Drive Rally was first showcased to the public in an early playable state at SCES '94 under the name Rage Rally. In a 1995 preview article by Computer and Video Games magazine, it was revealed that Power Drive Rally was in development since February 1994 and at the same time as with Power Drive for both the Super NES and Mega Drive. It was later showcased in a near-finished state during WCES '95 and Spring ECTS '95. French magazine Consoles + reported that the game would support two-player simultaneous multiplayer via the JagLink peripheral, but it is unknown if the final release still features support for the accessory. It made its last trade show appearance at E3 1995. It is also the only game in the Jaguar's library that features an alternative packaging design for other regions. In an interview with Philip Nixon, sole designer and artist of Power Drive Rally, he and the game's programmer Peter Johnson contacted the Liverpool offices of Rage Software and were offered to convert the SNES version of Power Drive to the Jaguar. Philip was responsible for all the art and tracks in the game, while he reused and upgraded the original art files, in addition to the increased resolution to scale down the sprites for improved gameplay view. While in a March 1995 interview with online magazine Atari Explorer Online, Peter stated that all of the game's programming relies upon the system's Blitter processor and that it runs at 50 frames per second, in addition of having a lesser number of tracks compared to the original game, among other features. It was created by a small team of four people in total.  Reception   Pre- release  When previewed in their March 1995 issue, Dave Halverson of GameFan remarked that the game needed fixes in the controls and voice samples but gave positive remarks to the graphics and attention to detail, stating that \\"This is gonna' be a good one!\\".  Post-release  Next Generation reviewed the Jaguar version of the game, and stated that \\"if you're feeling nostalgic for the good old-fashioned overhead racer, this is a good one to check out.\\"  References   External links  * Power Drive Rally at AtariAge * Power Drive Rally at GameFAQs * Power Drive Rally at MobyGames Category:1995 video games Category:Atari Jaguar games Category:Atari Jaguar- only games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Racing video games Category:Rage Software games Category:Time Warner Interactive games Category:Top-down racing video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games set in Arizona Category:Video games set in Corsica Category:Video games set in England Category:Video games set in Finland Category:Video games set in France Category:Video games set in Italy Category:Video games set in Kenya Category:Video games set in Sweden ","title":"Power Drive Rally"},{"id":"57772515","text":"Salafy magazine is an Indonesian Islamist publication whose target audience is students.

From 1926 to 1931 she lived in Newlyn, Cornwall and studied with the artists Ernest Procter and Harold Harvey at their art school for some time. For a period Waters worked as an apprentice to Proctor and learnt several techniques from him. Waters first exhibited at the Royal Academy in London in 1928 and showed there annually throughout her working life. She also exhibited with the New English Art Club, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters and the Society of Women Artists. Waters was an elected member of the National Society of Painters, Sculptors and Gravers. In 1933, she had her first solo exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in London. In 1934 Waters was commissioned to create a mural for the Knightsbridge Grille in London. Waters lived in London but continued to visit Cornwall on a regular basis and eventually moved to Lelant in the county. Waters was a frequent visitor to both France and Italy and became interested in fresco techniques early in her artistic career. She developed a distinct style of working in oils which created the appearance of tempera works. Meeting Ben Nicholson in Cornwall led Waters to experiment with abstraction, but the majority of her works are realistic and representational.

College Capers is a 1931 animated short film produced by The Van Beuren Corporation and released by the film distributor Path√©. The film, directed by John Foster and Harry Bailey, features the doings of a plethora of animals at college. The name of the cartoon means that the events in the cartoon represent mischief, as the informal meaning of Caper is \\"an ridiculous activity\\". Released on 15 March 1931, the cartoon is part of the early sound series entitled Aesop's Sound Fables. However, despite being in the series. The film is not based on an actual Aesop fable. However, like the other cartoons Van Beuren produced, the film has fallen into the public domain. This is because of their age, the studio's collapse, and their inclusion on budget DVDs. Plot The film's closing shot: The hippo being strung from a goalpost. The film begins with the animals travelling to college, whilst all singing a song. Once they are all in the classroom, the professor announces, in a nonsense accent, the roll-call. The animals, through a song, explain that they are all present. He is not amused, and angrily asks the students to sit down. After that, a student is caught sleeping by another pupil, who plays a song on his guitar to wake him up. Then, several students duplicate the song on other instruments, whilst others dance to it. This continues until the sports coach comically sucks them up in a giant vacuum cleaner to transport them to the viewer podium to watch a sports game. At the beginning of the game, the band plays a song (with audio recycled from Circus Capers). After the playing, the game begins, which is a group of mice versus a hippo. At the start of the game, the first set of mice get comically flattened by the ball, due to the hippo comically treating the ball like a rolling pin. However, some of the mice manage to get on to his back to prevent him from scoring. This does not help, as the hippo scores anyway by comically flinging himself over the bar. After the game, the medics comically pick up the injured mice with a spatula, due to them being flattened. In the second game, the mice bring out substitutes for the injured. When the second game starts, a group of mice form a pyramid and ram into the hippo. This makes one of the players go over him. When the hippo realises and tries to grab him. The mouse comically goes under the court to escape the hippo and run to the goalpost while the other mice pin the hippo down. The mouse scores the point, and wins the game. This makes the audience enter the court en masse to attack the hippo. The film ends with the entire college walking down the street and celebrating, with the hippo strung up from the goal.  Characters  In the film, the characters are all animals‚Äîpigs, dogs, mice, etc.‚Äîthat attend the college. There is also the hippo, who loses the game of American football. Milton and Rita Mouse do not appear in this cartoon due to a lawsuit agreement with Disney that Van Beuren would no longer use the characters.  Reception  College Capers received positive reviews from the cinema magazines at that time. Film Daily said the film was \\"unusually good\\" and said the film had \\"laughable gags\\". Whilst the Motion Picture Herald said the film was \\"just fair\\".

The restaurant has been awarded one star in the Michelin Guide since 2016. History Am Anthonian priory was established at the site in 1470. It was confiscated by the crown during the reformation and the buildings were demolished in The area remained undeveloped and was mostly used as farmland. A military installation was established at the site in the beginning of the 18th century. A building for the officers was located approximately where the hotel stands today while barracks and stables for around 100-150 dragoons and their horses were located at the site of present-day Pr√¶st√∏ Private School. The army left the site towards the end of the century. In the middle of the 19th century, Klosterhaven was increasingly used as a recreational area was planted with 1,500 plants from the royal nurseries in H√∏rsholm and Petersg√•rd. It was also proposed to created a pavilion which could both be used as an entertainment venue and an assembly building. In 1868, instigated by the Craftsmen's Guld (H√•ndv√¶rkerforeningen), the town began to sell 5 rigsdaler shares in support of the project. The new building was inaugurated on 2 May 1870. A bust of Frederick VII had been installed in the park back in 1868 and it was therefore decided to name the building Frederiksminde (Frederik's Memorial). Already from its opening the new venue struggled economically and was after five years sold in auction to the Craftsmen's Guild. The park was later refurbished by the town and the building was expanded in 1901. The main hall was lengthened in 1926 and could from then on seat 200 people as well as another 60 people on the balcony. The building was later converted into a hotel and changed hands several times. In 2003 it was acquired by Hans Michael Jepsen, a Hong Kong-based businessman with a history of purchasing and refurbishing historic buildings in provincial Denmark. He leased it to Silje Brenna. Hotel Frederiksminde reopened after a comprehensive make-over in 2007. Restaurant Jonas Mikkelsen was engaged as head chef in 2010.

Background Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, Prussia had adopted low tariffs (including for grain) and these became the basis of the Zollverein tariff of 1834.Tracy, p. 87. In 1853 the duties on grain were abolished and in 1862 the commercial treaty with France (along with similar treaties with other states) substantially reduced the duties for manufactured goods.Tracy, p. 87. The Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871 established most favoured nation status between Germany and France.Tracy, p. 87. In 1873 free trade won its last victory in Germany with the abolition of the duty on iron.Gerschenkron, p. 42. Tariffs were now for raising revenue and not for protective purposes, with the German Empire therefore almost a completely free-trading state.Ashley, p. 40. In 1850 two-thirds of Germany was employed in agriculture and this proportion declined slowly until 1870.Ashley, p. 29. During the 1850s and 1860s Germany was a net exporter of grain and its farmers opposed tariffs for industry as this might have led to reprisals by Britain against German grain.Tracy, p. 87. However, industrialists favoured tariffs against British goods to safeguard their infant industries and they therefore came to believe that winning over the farmers to protectionism was crucial.Tracy, p. 87. After the Franco- Prussian War of 1871, France had to pay an indemnity to Germany. A considerable portion of the indemnity was paid in bills of exchange and in gold. This gave impetus to industry but it also led to over-production: the number of joint-stock companies in Prussia in 1870 was 410, with total capital of three milliard marks; by the end of 1874 there were 2,267 companies with capital amounting to seven and one-third milliards.Ashley, p. 42. The Panic of 1873, however, led to a depression, with low prices in Germany temporarily shielding it from foreign competition. Although prices began to rise with the subsequent economic recovery, this recovery was hampered by British manufacturers dumping their goods on the German market.Ashley, p. 42. German manufacturers renewed their demand for protection, with the textile and iron industries the most strongly in favour.Ashley, p. 42. 1878 election. The protectionist Centrist and conservative parties are coloured grey and blue respectively. In the late 1870s world grain prices started to fall due to the opening up of the American prairies to cultivation following the settlement of the Midwest after the Civil War. The increase in railways also helped cheapen grain (which also aided Russian farmers).Ashley, pp. 42-43.Gerschenkron, p. 37.Taylor, p. 156. German grain started to lose ground and Germany became a net importer of wheat and rye.Tracy, p. 88. Agricultural labourers were migrating to the towns to find work in industry and landowners began to favour protection.Ashley, p. 43. The Prussian landowner Guido Henckel von Donnersmarck complained to Heinrich von Tiedemann about the sixfold increase in American grain, flour and meat exports \\"in truly unbelivable numbers, for German agriculture, there must be a grain, flour and meat tariff as an unconditional necessity if we are not to expose it to the same fluctuations as industry\\".Steinberg, p. 331. In 1876 both the Association of Tax and Economic Reformers (consisting mostly of large landowners) and the Central Association of German Industrialists were founded and in 1878 they combined to pressure the government into protecting both agriculture and industry.Tracy, p. 88. This coalition of interests into a solidarity bloc was called the marriage of iron and rye or the alliance of steel and rye.Carr, p. 134. The autumn of 1878 witnessed a high-point in their protectionist campaign and in the Reichstag 204 deputies (including 87 Centrists, 36 Conservatives and 27 Liberals) formed a cross-party association in favour of protection.Steinberg, pp. 375-376.Carr, pp. 133-134.Gerschenkron, p. 44. In October 1878 the Centre Party announced its support for protection.Taylor, p. 156. On 24 February 1879 the organisation of the largest 250 landowners--the Congress of German Landowners--also adopted protectionism.Steinberg, p. 379. However, the Socialist Congress held in Gotha in 1876 declared that \\"the Socialists of Germany are indifferent to the controversy raging in the proprietary classes as to Protection and Free Trade; the problem is a practical one, and must be so considered in each particular case\\".Ashley, p. 47. Otto von Bismarck On 31 March 1878 Bismarck met Wilhelm von Kardorff, an industrialist and a landowner, informing him of his conversion to \\"moderate protective and finance tariffs\\".Steinberg, p. 366. On 12 November he announced that the Bundesrat should appoint a Tariff Commission to draft tariff legislation.Steinberg, p. 377. On 15 December Bismarck sent the committee a letter in which he stated that the financial object of the tariff was the reduction of direct taxation and the increase in indirect taxation.Ashley, pp. 44-45. He estimated that if the tariff rates were 5 per cent. ad valorem the revenue they would yield would be about 70 million marks, roughly the same amount sent to the imperial exchequer by the federal states in 1878-79.Ashley, p. 45. He further argued: > I leave undecided the question whether complete mutual freedom of > international commerce, such as is contemplated by the theory of Free Trade, > would not serve the interests of Germany. But as long as most of the > countries with which our trade is carried on surround themselves with > customs barriers, which there is still a growing tendency to multiply, it > does not seem to me justifiable, or to the economic interest of the nation, > that we should allow ourselves to be restricted in the satisfaction of our > financial wants by the apprehension that German products will thereby be > slightly preferred to foreign ones.Ashley, p. 45. Bismarck stated that a general tariff protecting native industry was superior to tariffs for particular industries because: > ...its effects would be more equally spread over all the productive circles > of the land than is the case with a system of protective duties for isolated > branches of industry. The minority of the population, which does not produce > at all, but exclusively consumes, will apparently be injured by a customs > system favouring the entire national production. Yet if by means of such a > system the aggregate sum of the values produced in the country increase, and > thus the national wealth be on the whole enhanced, the non-producing parts > of the population...will eventually be benefited.Ashley, pp. 45-46. In the Reichstag Bismarck announced that from henceforth the government's income would come from indirect rather than from direct taxation. Also, since \\"other states surround themselves with customs barriers it seems to me justified...that German products have a small advantage over foreign ones\\".Steinberg, p. 377. The adoption of protectionism by Bismarck signalled a shift towards a greater reliance on the Conservatives for support rather than on the National Liberals.Carr, p. 134. The tariff was supported by the two Conservative Parties and the Centre Party and opposed by the Progressives and the Socialists, with the Liberals divided.Eyck, p. 253. On 31 March Bismarck held a meeting with the Centrist deputy Ludwig Windthorst, where Bismarck agreed to relax the Kulturkampf against the Catholic Church in exchange for Centrist support for protection.Steinberg, p. 380. The committee that drafted the tariff legislation was chaired by Georg Freiherr von und zu Franckenstein.Steinberg, p. 382. He gave his name to a clause in the legislation that limited to 130 million marks as the maximum amount the central government could receive from customs revenue and the tobacco duty. The remaining amount would go to the federal states.Steinberg, p. 382. On 9 July 1879 the Reichstag voted for the Franckenstein clause by 211 votes to 122 against.Steinberg, p. 382. On 12 July the tariff bill was voted for by a majority of 100.Steinberg, p. 383. Rates The tariff imposed moderate import duties on grain and raised the duties on livestock products.Tracy, p. 88. Wheat, rye and oats were subject to a duty of 1 mark per 100kg; on barley and maize 50 pfennigs; on flour 2 marks; on meat 12 marks; on oxen 20 marks; sheep 1 mark; pigs 25 marks.Ashley, p. 47. Raw materials for industry such as cotton, flax, hemp, wool and coal were admitted duty free.Ashley, p. 47. The duty on pig iron was 1 mark; on semi-manufactured goods made from iron and steel it ranged from 2 to 2.5 marks; for other iron and steel goods the duty ranged from 7.5 to 15 marks. On machinery it was 3 to 8 marks; for yarns and textiles the rates were 15 to 30 per cent. ad valorem.Ashley, p. 47. Effects The tariff protected the great landowners east of the Elbe--the Ostelbier or Junkers--from competition from cheap American grain.Eyck, pp. 258-259. Without protection many of these landowners would have declined; the tariff preserved the economic existence and the political ascendancy of the Junker class.Eyck, p. 259.Gerschenkron, pp. 45-47.Steinberg, p. 331.Taylor, p. 183. Many working men considered the tariff a tax on their food and along with the Anti-Socialist Laws that banned the Social Democratic Party, the tariff helped alienate the working class from the state. The historian Erich Eyck argued that if Germany's political culture at the beginning of the 20th century differed from that in Western Europe, agricultural protection was largely responsible.Eyck, p. 259.

Salvatore lives and works in Rio de Janeiro and in Sant‚ÄôElia Fiumerapido, Italy. Salvatore‚Äôs artworks are situations created with heterogeneous elements, processes and people that work together in experimental form. His work is seen as a critique of both centralized and decentralized powers and its abuses, social control and consumerism in its broadest declination, especially cultural. Salvatore is known for his body of work 'Some Other Race', a unique series of conceptual artworks created with human blood that opens new perspectives on the way the nature of the work of art can be thought. Through parodies of scientific methods of classifications and categorizations, Salvatore looks at the common elements that precede rigid definitions of people's identities, the indiscernible nature of the fluid from where any difference comes from, as the artist declares in his interview with Brazilian journalist Jo Soares in 2010. Lucio Salvatore, Metaelmenti, MAM Rio de Janeiro (2018)  Biography  Salvatore was born in Cassino where he attended the Liceo Classico ‚ÄòG. Carducci‚Äô. He graduated in economics from Bocconi University in Milan (March 1998). During this time, he also attended philosophy courses at the University of Milan. He studied photography in New York City where he lived from 2002 to 2010 and fine arts at Escola de Artes Visuais Parque Lage in Rio de Janeiro, where Salvatore developed his roots as an artist.

Plain feteer is usually soaked in honey and spread with jam or cheese or served with olives. Because of its versatility, feteer is often referred to as an Egyptian pizza. Feteer meshaltet has become an important symbol of hospitality in Egypt. As such, it was served to American president Barack Obama during his visit to Egypt in June 2009. Egyptian families traditionally give it as gifts to visitors and friends. It is also commonly prepared for holidays, weddings, and other celebrations. Women baking feteer meshaltet History Feteer meshaltet dates back to ancient Egypt, where it was known as \\"feteer maltoot\\". It was left at temples as an offering to the gods. A recipe for feteer meshaltet was found in the tomb of Eighteenth Dynasty Vizier Rekhmire. The ancient recipe closely resembles its modern counterpart, with the only exception being the addition of honey during the baking process, while modern feteer is normally soaked in honey after the baking process.

The film, which stars Melissa Gilbert and Patty Duke, is based on a book by Jerry Hulse and was shot on location in British Columbia.  Plot  Julie Lawson (Melissa Gilbert) is a professional researcher living with her daughter Megan (Ashleigh Aston Moore) in Seattle and has recently separated from her husband Sam (Eric McCormack) because he had an affair with his secretary. One day she blacks out while driving and crashes her car. In the hospital, the doctor (Mel Ryane) says she suffered an inflammation of the arteries to the brain, and a fatal blockage will soon happen unless she undergoes surgery immediately. Then the nurse warns her that if strokes run in the family, it would be too risky too operate. Julie contacts her father (William Shatner) to request this information, and he admits that she was adopted and he has no way to know if strokes run in her family. Shocked, Julie learns that her parents were not able to conceive or eligible to adopt, so she adopted Julie from the black market through a lawyer. Determined to find her roots, Julie tracks down this lawyer. He has since died, but his son Bill Curtis (John Shaw) still runs his practice and provides Julie with some important documents that show that shortly after payments by Julie's adoptive parents, Curtis' father paid funds to a woman called Frances Thompson living in Cloverton, British Columbia. Assuming that this woman is her mother, she heads to Cloverton, where she learns that Frances was a 75-year-old former schoolteacher who recently died with her husband in a car accident. She further learns that their daughter Beth (Patty Duke) runs her own beauty parlor in the area. Realizing that Beth is her mother, she contacts her and quickly reveals her true identity. Beth initially denies the possibility of being her mother, but later reveals that she was raped after a school dance and gave birth to a baby while studying in Seattle. The possible rapists are the guys at the dance, including Matthew Saunders (Dax Belanger) who got addicted to drugs and later disappeared; Jake Gibson (Chris William Martin), who married her best friend Sue (Michelle Beaudoin) and later died; and Tim Webster (Michael Gabriel) and Del Smith (Peter Stebbings), both of whom are still traceable. Julie first traces down Del (Gordon Clapp), telling him that she is a journalist writing an article on their homecoming then and now. Del makes an indecent proposal while driving her, which scares her. She next contacts Tim (Chuck Shamata), whose name is quickly cleared as he reveals that he is infertile. After she leaves Tim's place, Del approaches her on the street, suspecting that she is in town for ulterior motives. As he harasses her, he mentions that his father died from a stroke. Julie is convinced that Del is the perpetrator and panics, considering that she cannot have surgery if he indeed turns out to be her biological father. Meanwhile, Beth relives the rape in her memories and recalls the lack of support that her mother (Christina Jastrzembska) gave her. She remembers that she collected a button from the rapist which she kept secretly. She finds the button and notice that it belongs to a green jacket. Through a photo made at the homecoming dance, they learn that the rapist is Jake. Sue (Martha Gibson) is shocked to learn that her husband raped Beth and tells Julie that strokes did not run in his family. Afterwards, Julie returns to Seattle and successfully undergoes surgery. She reconnects with her adoptive father and gives Sam a second chance.

A veteran of several conflicts, he distinguished himself during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War at the beginning of 20th century and later during the World War I as Chief, Training Section (G-5) of the American Expeditionary Force. Following the War, he remained in the Army and completed his service in 1935 as Major general and commanding general, Panama Canal Department. Early career Harold B. Fiske was born on November 6, 1871, in Salem, Oregon as the son of Eugene Rufus Fiske, M.D. and Charlotte Scott Grubbe. He graduated from the Bishop Scott Academy in Portland, Oregon in May 1891 and taught for two years, before received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in June 1893. During his time at the Academy, he was active in the football team and served as Class Vice-President. Fiske graduated on June 21, 1893 with Bachelor of Science degree and was commissioned second lieutenant in the Infantry Branch. He was assigned to the 18th Infantry Regiment at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. In June 1898, his regiment sailed to the Philippines and Fiske took part in the combats against Spaniards during Battle of Manila. Following the outbreak of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War in February 1899, Fiske participated in the Defense of Manila against Filipino Insurgents and other combat operations until his return to the United States in August 1901. For his service in the Philippines, Fiske was decorated with Silver Star. Fiske spent few months with a stateside service with 28th Infantry Regiment and reached the rank of Captain. He sailed back to the Philippines in May 1902 and participated in the fighting insurgents until December 1903, when he was ordered back to the United States. When the government of Cuban President Tom√°s Estrada Palma collapsed, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt ordered U.S. military forces into Cuba. Their mission was to prevent fighting between the Cubans, to protect U.S. economic interests there, and to hold free elections in order to establish a new and legitimate government. Fiske was stationed on Cuba and participated in the occupation duty until February 1909, when United States withdrew its troops following the election of Jos√© Miguel G√≥mez. Upon his return to the United States, Fiske attended the Army School of the Line at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas and Army Staff College and graduated with honors from both institutions. He then served consecutively as an instructor at both schools until November 1914, when he participated in the Veracruz Expedition during the ongoing Mexican Revolution. Fiske returned to his capacity as an instructor at Army Staff College in Washington, D.C. and remained in that assignment until the April 1917. During his tenure at Army Staff College, Fiske became an advocate of the improvements in the Infantry tactics and proposed for example the expanding of Infantry company from 150 to 250 men, the extensive use of grenades or adopting the German machine gun ratio. His proposal were based on the experiences of the European armies or unit fighting on the Eastern Front, where the war was more mobile. Fiske also saw temporary duty on the staff of General John J. Pershing on the Mexican Border in mid-1916 and reached the rank of Major. World War I Shortly following the United States' entry into World War I, Fiske was attached to the 2nd Infantry Brigade under Brigadier general Robert L. Bullard in June 1917 and embarked for France as Brigade's Adjutant. He was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel soon afterwards and transferred to the Training Section (G-5) of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) under General John J. Pershing. There he served as Deputy to Section Chief, Colonel Paul B. Malone and faced many difficult situations during the training of the AEF troops. Fiske replaced Malone in February 1918 and held that command for the duration of the War. He often criticized the War Department and unit commanders for the inability to fulfill the requirements of the AEF training system. Fiske insisted that all officers must attended the AEF staff and specialist schools upon arrival to France regardless of when the parent unit was scheduled to enter combat. As a consequence, some units arrival in France, were stripped of their officers and non-commissioned officers, and, because of the demands of combat, were sent into the line under the command of strangers. On the other hand, General Pershing recognized Fiske as skilled staff officer and administrator and promoted him to the temporary rank of Brigadier general on June 26, 1918. Fiske voluntarily served with the 1st Infantry Division during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and Second Battle of the Marne and with 79th and the 2nd Infantry Divisions during Meuse-Argonne Offensive. His first-hand observations of troop performance in combat helped improve the AEF training system. For his service in France, Fiske was decorated with Army Distinguished Service Medal based on the recommendation of General Pershing and also received several foreign decorations of Allied nations: Legion of Honour, rank Commander, French Croix de Guerre with Palm by the Government of France, the Order of Leopold from Belgium, and the Order of the Crown of Italy. Postwar career Fiske returned to the United States in August 1919 and reverted to his peacetime rank of Major along with hundreds of other officers. He was appointed an instructor at the Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia and few months later was promoted again to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Upon the appointment of General Pershing as Chief of Staff of the United States Army in July 1921, Fiske was transferred to the War Department General Staff and appointed a Chief of the Training Section. He was promoted again to the rank of Brigadier general in 1922 and remained in that capacity until December 1924, when he was transferred to Fort Sam Houston, Texas for command of 4th Infantry Brigade as the part of 2nd Infantry Division. In June 1927, he assumed command of 3rd Infantry Brigade, also part of 2nd Division and held that command until November that year, when he was attached to the staff of Fourth Corps Area with headquarters at Fort McPherson, Georgia. Fiske remained in that capacity until April 1930, when he assumed command of 87th Infantry Division, the Organized Reserve of Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. Fiske was ordered to the Panama Canal Zone in April 1931 and succeeded his West Point Classmate, Charles DuVal Roberts, as Commanding general, Panama Canal Division. In this capacity, he was responsible for the defense of the Atlantic Sector. He was promoted to Major general in August 1933 and assumed command of Panama Canal Department. Fiske was responsible for the complete defense of Panama Canal Zone and got into conflict with Nelson Rounsevell, a controversial editor of the Panama American Newspaper and advisor to Panamian President Arnulfo Arias. Rounsevell claimed that harsh command style of Colonel James V. Heidt, Commander of Fort Clayton, forced four men to suicide. Fiske as Heidt's direct superior officer subsequently pressed charges of criminal libel and Rounsevell was arrested and then released on 2,500 $ Bond. Rounsevell was acquitted and given suspended sentence in order to denied the martyrdom he may have sought. It is not known, whether this case had impact on Fiske, however he retired from active duty on November 30, 1935, completing 38 years of commissioned service. Retirement Following his retirement from the Army, Fiske settled in San Diego, California and was active in several retired officers associations. He died on May 1, 1960 and was buried with full military honors at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery. His wife, Lucy Beatrice Keyes (1874-1954) is buried beside him. They had two daughters: Virginia, a wife of Major general Thomas S. Timberman and Berenice.

Exceptionally comprehensive documentation regarding this event has been preserved in the Cape archives: the relevant Resolutions of the Political CouncilCape Archives, Cape Town (hereafter KA), C27-C98 Resolusies van die Politieke Raad 1709-1735 (TANAP) and correspondence between the Cape Governor and the Council of XVII in the Netherlands;KA, C1467 Uitgaande Brieven 1724-1725KA, C150 Uitgaande Brieven 1710-1713KA, C407-C423 Inkomende Brieven 1722-1727 the Ship's Journal of the skipper;KA, CJ646 Process Stukken Van Soest wegens vergaan van de Schoonenberg op Agoxa 1722 met Schips Journaal travel journals of the missions to the wreck;KA, C2438, C2448 Attestati√´n 1722-1726 affidavits by the ship's officers and men;KA, CJ647 Papieren concerneerende in de Zaak van den Heer Fiscaal Eijsser contra Albertus van Soest C.S. the charge-sheet (Eijsch en Conclusie) of the fiscal;KA, CJ327 Eijsch en Conclusie 19 Maart 1723 the documentation of the judicial enquiry by the Council of Justice, with several rounds of arguments and counter arguments, and the final verdict.KA, CJ8 Notule van die Raad van Justisie 15 Januarie 1722 - 14 Desember 1724 This allows the events, as they unfolded 300 years ago, to be reconstructed in detail. Nevertheless, it was a fable, deviating radically from the truth, which caused the Schoonenberg disaster to become well known. The Fable The earliest known version, written by Oliver Jenkins, appeared in the Cape Times of 23 December 1939 under the title: ‚ÄòThe Vanished Treasure of Vergelegen‚Äô.Jenkins, Oliver: ‚ÄòThe vanished Treasure of Vergelegen‚Äô in the Cape Times, Cape Town, 23 December 1939 According to this, the skipper and three farmers had conspired to deliberately run the ship aground. The treasure from the vessel was taken to the farm Vergelegen in the Hottentots Holland, where one of the farmers and four slaves buried it in the octagonal garden behind the homestead. Three of the slaves were later found murdered, and the other absconded. The farmer also died mysteriously when the conspirators went to dig up the treasure, so that nobody knew where it had been hidden. The Governor rounded up the remaining conspirators and submitted them to trial. The skipper was broken on the wheel, strangled and hanged, and the two remaining farmers were sent in chains to Batavia. Jenkins gave no sources for his story, but the use of the names of historic persons may be an indication of the creative use of snippets from the archives. Murder in the vineyards of Vergelegen, and a hidden treasure, had been part of an old oral tradition in the Hottentots Holland.Report under the heading ‚ÄòHottentots Holland‚Äô in The Cape Argus, Cape Town, 22 October 1859 The story by Jenkins was repeated with minor changes by the well-known authors Eric Rosenthal (1951)Rosenthal, Eric: ‚ÄòThe Treasure of Vergelegen‚Äô in The Hinges Creaked, true stories of South African treasure lost and found. Cape Town, Howard Timmins, 1951 and Lawrence Green (1958).Green, Lawrence: ‚ÄòEvery Beachcomber‚Äôs Dream‚Äô, in South African Beachcomber. √áape Town, Howard Timmins, 1958 Neither mentions any specific sources, but each alleges that his story is based on old documents. As a result, this clever fiction has subsequently been accepted generally as a credible legend. The true Schoonenberg story Between 2011 and 2017 all documentation pertaining to the Schoonenberg in the Cape archives had been investigated systematically. From this emerged the real story of the ship and its crew.Malan, Jan G.: ‚ÄòDie VOC-skip Schoonenberg: Waarheid en verdigsel.

Deel 2: Strandroof na stranding van 1722?‚Äô In Suid-Afrikaanse Tydskrif vir Kultuurgeskiedenis, Jaargang 27 (Deel 2), November 2013.Malan, Jan G.: Die Stranding van die VOC- skip Schoonenberg: Waarheid en Verdigsel. Kaapstad, Africana Uitgewers, 2017 The 800-ton Schoonenberg was built for the Amsterdam Chamber of the VOC as a typical 40 m three master for trade with the East. She was launched in 1717 and left on her first visit to the East in 1719, only returning to the Netherlands in 1721. Albertus van Soest was the skipper for the second voyage which departed from Texel on 15 December 1721. It was also his second journey to the East as skipper. Stop-overs at the Cape usually lasted from three to six weeks, and Van Soest became friends with Jacob van der Heijde who supplied meat to passing ships. On 21 July 1722 the Schoonenberg arrived at Batavia. The disastrous journey In the company of another East-Indiaman, the Anna Maria, the Schoonenberg sailed from Batavia on 25 September 1722. Her 700-ton cargo consisted of sugar, tea, coffee, pepper and sapan wood to the value of 294 411 guilder. There were 110 men aboard, and the ship carried 28 cannon. The two vessels lost contact shortly before the Schoonenberg saw the coast of Africa just to the north of Algoa Bay on the morning of 16 November. During the following days she sailed south-west and then due west. At midday on 19 November her latitude was measured as 34 degrees 54 minutes south, that is about 8 km further south than Cape Agulhas, the most southern promontory of the continent. The skipper ordered a due westerly course to be maintained. According to the officers, at sunset land was visible northwest of west, about 60 km off. Due west it was too hazy to see anything. It was a standing order of the Company that depth soundings had to be taken when land was being approached. The officers asked the skipper whether this should not be done. His reply, later confirmed by the men who stood at the helm, was that they knew where they were - on the sand (that is on the Agulhas Bank) - and that a depth sounding would unnecessarily retard their journey. It would be duly done the next morning. Before a stiff east-northeasterly breeze the ship journeyed on with all sails set. Second mate Pieter Corver was on duty during the ‚Äòdog watch‚Äô, that is from 24h00 till 04h00 the next morning. His brief was to alert the skipper and to steer away from the coast, should land be detected. Around 03h30 the lookout, Pieter Jansz, called out that there was land ahead. Corver acknowledged the call, but took no action. When the lookout called again, Corver went to alert the skipper, who had heard the second call and was already on his way to the deck. He immediately shouted for the rudder and sails to be adjusted so that they could move away from the land. The water depth was 12,5 m, but was decreasing rapidly. When the vessel responded sluggishly the daily anchor (bower anchor) was cast out, but the cable snapped when a brake was applied to slow down the ship. The dredge anchor, tied to the foremast, was then cast out. This caused the bow to veer to the north, but when its cable had run out, it also snapped. The depth was now only 7,5 m. The ship drifted sideways towards the reef, and the waves pushed it firmly on to the rocks with its bow facing the land, some 800 m off. Water started rushing in, and after an hour or two the pumps could no longer cope. Many of the sailors were drunk as the liquor store had been looted. Some of the men went ashore on the ship's boat. The others made rafts, and so all reached land safely. The skipper and some of his officers stayed on board throughout the day and following night, while the violence of the waves caused the hull to crack in the middle, with the masts still standing. On the morning of 21 November the boat came to fetch the officers; the skipper was only taken off towards evening. On the beach a hostile reception awaited him. According to him the officers had led the men to believe that he was responsible for the disaster which befell them. During the night he was manhandled and robbed in his tent by a bunch of ruffians. The provisions they had brought from the ship were skimpy: 150 I of water, two barrels of barley and three live pigs. The next morning the skipper was informed by the officers that they had decided to walk to the Cape. About 84 men followed them, while some 20 stayed with the skipper. These men were completely unruly and went to the wreck at will to plunder and to fetch more liquor. Van Soest and his bookkeeper, Paulus Augier, had to carry pistols to protect them from the mutineers. It was only on 26 December that all of them left for the Cape with the second fact-finding mission. According to all evidence there was never any hint of the deliberate stranding of the ship. Negligence yes, especially with the choice of a route dangerously close to the treacherous coast, and with the failure to take depth soundings. But the reason for the large departure from their planned course remains a mystery. Possible navigational errors cannot explain the full deviation of 12 km to the north. The well-known reverse eddies to the north, of the Agulhas current as it hits the Agulhas Bank, might well have played a role. On the Bank such side currents often reach more than 4 km per hour. Especially at night, the seamen could not have known that they were drifting off to the north, while steering west. Action by the Governor and Political Council On the afternoon of 24 November the Anna Maria sailed into Table Bay with the news that the Schoonenberg was stranded on the rocks near Cape Agulhas. Governor Mauritz de Chavonnes immediately sent someone to investigate. When he learnt that men from the ship were on their way to the Cape, he sent a delegation led by the deputy governor, Jan de la Fontaine, to Hottentots Holland to meet them at Vergelegen, the farm of Jacob van der Heijde. According to the officers, the ship and her cargo could not be salvaged and the men on the beach had little water and food. On the request of the officials, Jacob (Jacques) Malan, the farmer of the neighboring Morgenster, together with Gerrit Romond set out for the wreck. They left on 30 November with Malan's wagon loaded with emergency provisions. Two days later, two senior officials, Cornelis Valk and Johannes Pleunes, also left for Struis Bay on a fact-finding mission. Both wagons reached the stranded men on 6 December. Meanwhile, the 84 men and their officers were cared for and entertained by Philip Morkel on his farm Onverwacht in the Hottentots-Holland. After their return to the Netherlands they expressed their gratitude by sending a tribute in the form of an epic poem called ‚ÄòLiefdekrans‚Äô to the Morkels. Finally, on 25 December, the second fact-finding mission confirmed in writing on the deck of the Schoonenberg that nothing could be salvaged. Van Soest and Augier were later sent by the Political Council to burn the wreck so that it would not mislead passing ships. This was accomplished on 26 January 1723. In the course of 1723 some of the Schoonenberg sailors were placed on passing ships which had lost seamen. Those remaining, together with the officers, were repatriated to the Netherlands early in 1724. Judicial Enquiry and Verdict Fiscal Cornelis van Beaumont took affidavits from all those involved and in March 1723 formulated his charge-sheet. The skipper and his officers were charged with negligence for not taking depth soundings. The lawsuit before the Council of Justice, with a number of rounds of arguments and counter-arguments, continued till 11 September when judgment was passed. All four were found guilty. Van Soest and Corver were dismissed with loss of salary and rank, and were declared unfit to serve the Company again in any capacity. Their possessions and any salary owed to them were confiscated. First mate Willem Verbeek was dismissed with loss of salary and rank, and third mate Dirk Pest was reprimanded by the Council but retained his rank. Following the loss of his rank, Van Soest did not want to travel as an ordinary passenger on a VOC ship. Assisted by his friend Jacob van der Heijde he secretly boarded an English vessel, the Berrington, and sailed for Europe at the end of 1723. Suspicion of looting from the wreck The Council of XVII in the Netherlands were dissatisfied with the long-drawn-out legal process, and even more so with the lenient sentence of Van Soest, whom they suspected of having beached the ship deliberately. After his return to his fatherland as a free man they resolved to charge him for the robbery of goods which he was supposed to bring from the East for people in Holland, and which he now alleged had been lost in the disaster. The investigation of fiscal Adriaan van Kervel in 1726 on order of the Council of XVII did find evidence that a sealed package containing a hoard had been sent by Van Soest to Van der Heijde, and that locked cases and rolls of eastern materials had been offloaded at Vergelegen. But Van der Heijde and his family denied having seen this. No material evidence could be found and there was no indication that anything had later been transported from Vergelegen. Replying to Van Kervel's report, the Council of XVII wrote that they would give the matter more thought. No documents were found indicating that anybody had ever been charged for looting. Discovery of the wreck On 25 November 1985 Charlie Shapiro and Mike Keulemans found indications of a wreck while conducting a magnetometer survey on Northumberland reef at Struis Bay. A systematic survey of the site in 1990 by a party led by Jimmy Herbert allowed the position of 4 anchors (including a bent dredge anchor) and 21 cannon to be mapped, and also brought to light Eastern porcelain, pepper, Dutch 'ijsel' bricks, molten lead and various household articles. This evidence, together with historic records regarding the orientation of the wreck and its subsequent burning, convinced the researchers that the discovered wreck was that of the Schoonenberg.Herbert, E.J.: Resting in Her Light: Schonenberg 1722 & Meermin 1666.

It houses a museum dedicated to pastel. It has been partly classified as a historical monument since 14 December 1979.  History  Built on a height of 330 meters overlooking the valley of the Agout and hillsides of Lauragais, the site may have been occupied by a Gallic oppidum, converted into Roman castrum, and then reworked by the Visigoths. The first written record of the ch√¢teau dates from 7 August 1224, when the chatelain put himself under the protection of the Count of Toulouse, Raymond VII. In 1279, a notarial act attributed his property to the Brenguier family of Puylaurens. During the Hundred Years War, a gang of bandits used it as a base for their raiding raids in the surrounding area, and, in 1502, it belonged to the Corneilhan family. During the wars of religion, its occupants became Protestants, and were welcoming of Henry of Navarre, soon to be Henry IV, in 1585. Written traces are rarer, but it is likely that it was sold as a national good during the Revolution. It was partially burned as some traces testify, then was consolidated, allowing him to maintain a state of conservation.

It is a member of the young open cluster NGC 2264, located about from the Sun in the constellation of Monoceros. Discovery The unique brightness variations of KH 15D were discovered at Wesleyan University's Van Vleck Observatory in 1995 by Dr. William Herbst and his then-master's student Kristin Kearns. The star was found to alternate, on a 48.37-day period between a brighter \\"on\\" state and a fainter \\"off\\" state that was less than 4% of the bright state (or up to 96% dimmed). As the years went by, the star spent more and more time \\"off\\", such that by 2010 it was always in the faint state, although still periodically variable. In 2012 it unexpectedly began to \\"wink\\" on and off again and has now entered a phase where its \\"on\\" state is almost twice as bright as it was in the mid-1990s (see light curve). Hypotheses A consensus model of this puzzling behavior has emerged, which attributes the winking to the rising and setting of one star relative to the edge of a circumbinary ring that occults part of the orbit. Precession of the ring has caused the gradual evolution of the winking behavior as shown in the diagrams below. Radial velocity measurements confirmed the system as a spectroscopic binary composed of two weak-lined T Tauri stars. The orbit of the binary system is nearly edge-on to our line of sight and the circumbinary disk is tilted with respect to that orbit, resulting in nodal precession. At the time of the 1996 observation only one star (designated star A) was visible while the occulting ring fully blocked the light from star B. The winking observed was caused by star A rising and setting from behind the ring. By 2010, the ring covered both stars and the system was permanently in the \\"off\\" state, being seen only by scattered light off the ring. By 2018, star B was fully uncovered and star A fully occulted. Star B has turned out to be somewhat brighter, hotter and more massive than star A, but the labels have not been changed since this might cause confusion in the literature. The importance of KH 15D derives from the unique opportunity it provides to study the terrestrial planet formation zone of a protoplanetary disk. From its rate of precession it is known that the occulting ring is located about 3 AU from the stars, which would put it at the asteroid belt in the Solar System. The age of KH 15D is around 3 Myr and its total mass is around 1.5 solar masses, so the system may provide some guidance on when and how planetesimals ‚Äì the precursors of planets such as the Earth ‚Äì form. The regular occultations also provide opportunities to study the magnetospheres and photospheres of T Tauri stars in unprecedented detail.  The Disk   Composition  Though the composition of the disk is not known for sure, there has been evidence of methane and water ice features with grain sizes of 1-50 Œºm.  Bipolar outflows  It has also been observed that there are bipolar outflow jets inclined by 84% coming from the disk itself. Both hydrogen and carbon dioxide outflows have been observed extending from the north and south sides of the disk. These observations have led to an upper mass limit of 3.2266e27 kg for the disk.

He served in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War and World War I, and he received the Distinguished Service Medal among several other awards. Biography Fleming was born on December 6, 1872, in Midway, Kentucky. His family was of Scottish descent, had arrived in the Americas in the mid-1700s, and fought for the United States during the American Revolutionary War. Fleming graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1895 and was commissioned into the Fifth Artillery. Fleming went to the Philippines in 1898 with the Sixth Artillery. He received two Silver Stars there and was wounded. After serving on recruiting duty in Lexington, Kentucky, he went to California after his promotion to captain in 1901. Fleming attended the School of Submarine Defense at Fort Totten in 1905, and be subsequently assumed command of the 15th Field Artillery Battery. Fleming served as the commandant of the Artillery School from September 26, 1917, to May 11, 1918. After his promotion to brigadier general on April 12, 1918, Fleming assumed command of the 158th Field Artillery Brigade at Camp Sherman, Ohio, which he took to France later that year because of World War I. He participated in combat during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, and he received the Distinguished Service Medal for his efforts there, as well as two oak leaf clusters and the Legion of Honour. Fleming temporarily commanded the 32nd Infantry Division's Artillery in October 1918. In command of his own brigade again, Fleming supported the 17th French Army at the Battle of Verdun, and after rejoining the 32nd Infantry, they took part in the occupation of Germany until July 1919. After returning to the U.S., Fleming reverted to his permanent rank of colonel. He graduated from the United States Army War College during this time, and starting on August 25, 1920, he briefly was part of the General Staff Corps in Washington, D.C. Because of physical disability, Fleming retired from the army on June 17, 1921, as a colonel, though Congress restored his brigadier general rank in 1930.

The meeting concluded with requests for Albanian officials in the areas with Albanian population and the removal of Re≈üid Mehmed Pasha, a local official with considerable power in parts of Epirus, from his official posts in Delvina, Vlora and Janina. In 1831 Poda led a peasant revolt in the region of Kolonj√´ and Leskovik, coordinating with other Albanian leaders such as the Bushati family. In 1835 Poda was executed by Ottoman authorities due to his activities for more rights for Albanians.

She appeared at the Drury Lane Theatre and was the mistress of Peter the Great when he visited England. Life Cross was born in Surrey and it has been suggested that this was 1681 or 1682 based on later information she volunteered. She was brought up in the theatre by her mother and her grandparents may have been Leonard and Ann Cross. She was baptised in Dorking. In 1694 whilst still a child she was a member of the Drury Lane/Dorset Garden theatre company in London. At that time it was the only theatre company but a group left which included Thomas Betterton. She sang songs by Henry Purcell whilst he was still alive as well as appearing in his unfinished opera The Indian Queen after his death. She sang in The Mock Marriage, The Rival Sisters and a version of The Tempest by John Dryden. She sang in various other productions and in 1696 she appeared as herself in a satire and later the year she was in The Relapse by John Vanbrugh. In 1697 and 1698 Peter the Great embarked on his Grand Embassy. He visited London and Cross became his mistress. She was paid ¬£500 as \\"a present\\" although she expected more. The Czar replied that he thought her overpaid. Later that same year she went to France with a \\"certain baronet\\". In 1705 Thomas Clayton opened Arsinoe which was said to be the first English Opera designed \\"in the Italian style\\". Cross who had only recently returned to Drury Lane was amongst its principal players. The following month she was in Florimel and The Tender Husband in April. In 1706 she married Peter Weir but he was soon killed in Flanders. Cross created new roles such as Miranda in Susanna Centlivre's successful comedy play The Busy Body in 1709 which ran for 13 nights. The following year the Drury Lane Theatre became, after much disagreement, subject to new management by Robert Wilks, Colley Cibber and Thomas Doggett and they refused to honour a five-year contract she had signed the year before with the previous management. The management had to change their minds when 73 of her admirers signed a petition in her support. She was accused of orchestrating the scheme but she denied any complicity. Cross had a benefit in 1732 where she returned to the stage for one night. She died at her home in Leicester Fields in London on 4 April 1737 leaving shares in the Lincoln's Inn Fields theatre and several mourning rings. There was a painting of her by Sir Godfrey Kneller as St Catherine in the 1690s and a matching print by John Smith.

Cedar Springs was a camp for early travelers on the Mormon Road, after they had made the arduous passage from Johnson's Springs across the marshy and wooded Coal Creek.

It is also known as Mount St Joseph's Convent of Mercy. It was designed by E. J. Woods and built from 1891. The property is owned by Broken Hill Church of Christ Inc. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Six sisters of the Sisters of Mercy had come to Broken Hill from Singleton in 1890 after the Bishop of Wilcannia, John Dunne, asked the sisters there to send a community to Broken Hill \\"for the welfare of the children\\". The sisters initially resided in a \\"very modest cottage\\" at the side of the present building, later removed. The foundation stone for St Joseph's Convent was laid by Bishop Dunne in February 1891. Adelaide architect E. J. Woods designed the building, and local contractor Mr. Kelly was responsible for construction of the initial west wing. The first stage of the current building officially opened on 19 July 1891, although it was originally viewed as the \\"new wing\\" in conjunction with the original cottage, with further development planned as the growth of the town warranted it. The building would subsequently be completed in three separate contracts, the last 1907-08, with the original cottage demolished to make way for newer buildings in the 1950s to house the music rooms and Nun's Infirmary. The total cost of construction amounted to \\"just on ¬£16,000\\". The first floor was destroyed by fire in 1979. Following the fire, the Sisters of Mercy decided to sell the property and relocate the remaining nuns to the former Franciscan Friary in Murton Street, North Broken Hill. It was purchased by a group of local property developers after the fire, who had plans to convert the complex into a private hospital. The heritage listing precluded external modification of the appearance of the listed buildings, so the plans fell through. The property was offered for sale again and in 1982, the Broken Hill Church of Christ purchased and subsequently refurbished the complex. The church used the former school rooms as a chapel for religious services and adapted the Convent as unit accommodation. On 9 May 2019, the Broken Hill Church of Christ sold the property at auction to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilcannia-Forbes, who took possession on 11 July 2019.

John and Elizabeth ran the Elizabeth Hotel in the late 1890s. She also wrote of her experiences with Native Americans and observations of warfare among the Cheyenne, Arapaho, and the Utes. Early years John M. Tallman was born April 25, 1837 or 1838 in Wyoming County, New York to Polly Maxon Tallman (born 1820) and Lymon Tallman (born 1810). His parents married in 1837. They moved to Michigan around 1840. He came to Colorado when he was 22 years of age, and according to Colorado Business Directory, he was the only resident in Pine Grove in 1859. He owned property at 15th and California Streets in Denver. Elizabeth Jane Pennock was born July 14, 1841 in Livingston County, New York. Her parents were Oliver P. Pennock (born about 1801 in Vermont) and Caroline Rowell Pennock (born in New York), who died in 1854. Her father enlisted in 1861 in the 104th New York Volunteer Infantry during the American Civil War. He died in 1863. Her parents gave birth to nine children, a number of whom came to Colorado. Her sister Mary came to Colorado in 1860 and married Horatio M. Foster. Ellen came to Colorado, married Edward Peck, and lived in Colorado Springs. Charles came to Colorado in 1865, after serving in the American Civil War. George died in Fort Collins in 1886. Her brother John R. Pennock stayed in New York, brother William died in the Battle of Gettysburg, and two other children died young. She was orphaned by 1864 when she moved west to live with her sister and brother-in-law, Mary and H.M. Foster. She married John in 1865 in Russellville (now Elizabeth) and they had two children, Mary Ellen and Charles Strafford. Contact with Native Americans Hungate and Sand Creek massacres In 1864, John was one of the first to reach the site of the Hungate massacre. A member of the 1st Regiment of Colorado Volunteers, he served under Colonel John Chivington during the Sand Creek massacre. His brother Jonathan was attacked by a band of Native Americans while riding a mule in 1870. Unable to get away from the men on horseback, he was killed and scalped. He is buried in Parker Cemetery. She also said that the Cheyenne and Arapaho were much quieter after Sand Creek massacre. Interaction at the ranch The Cheyenne, Kiowa, and Ute camped along Cherry Creek during the winter and passed by the Tallman's cabin in the spring when they went hunting on the Eastern Plains. Elizabeth wrote stories about her early years of marriage when she was visited by Native Americans‚Äîlike Ute Chiefs Coloros, Ouray, and Washington who traveled along Sulphur Gulch. Utes came to her cabin demanding biscuits. Chief Washington once tried to trade for her red-headed son. Elizabeth said of the encounter, \\"First he held up two fingers, then three until he indicated he would swap twenty ponies for my [two-year-old] son. He was disgusted when I refused him.\\" He liked her and once asked her to a scalp dance, which Merriam- Webster defines as \\"an American Indian victory dance often by women around a pole with enemy scalps or with scalp-surmounted sticks in hand.\\" She also wrote about warfare among the Cheyenne, Arapaho, and the Utes. Careers John raised a herd of Hereford cattle and operated a sawmill on Running Creek near the present-day town of Elizabeth with H.M. Foster. They made wooden shingles for the first shingled house in Denver. Mary and Elizabeth often drove the wagon to Denver for supplies. In 1878, the family moved to Castle Rock after John was elected to the position of Douglas County Clerk. He then operated a grocery store in Franktown with Ed Krakaw. He also grew alfalfa hay on five fields alongside Cherry Creek with a partner, F. H. Allison. John help plan for construction of a new County Court House about 1888 and into 1889. John and Elizabeth purchased the Elizabeth Hotel in Elizabeth in the late 1890s. It was run-down when they bought it, and the Denver Hotel Bulletin stated that they ran the business well. In 1936, Elizabeth was interviewed by James R. Harvey for the article \\"Pioneer Experiences in Colorado\\", which was printed in The Colorado Magazine. She wrote an article \\"Early History of Parker and Vicinity\\" that appeared in a 1946 issue of the same magazine. Tallman‚ÄìNewlin Cabin John Tallman is considered the likely builder of the two-room cabin and the large barn on their 160-acre ranch. Both were built in 1866. The barn was constructed without nails, using mortise and tenon construction. The ranch was located east of Pine Grove (near Mainstreet and Dwyer in present-day Parker). The ranch was sold to William G. Newlin in 1878. In 1900, the hewn log cabin was covered with wood siding. The Newlins had a family cemetery, which is next to the house. The cabin was moved to Callaway Road and Canterberry (sic) Trail in 1977 to prevent it from being demolished. It was restored by the Parker Area Historical Society, who has owned it since 1996. It is the only remaining log cabin in Parker and an example of Colorado pioneer life. Elizabeth Tallman mentioned the cabin in an article published by The Colorado Magazine in 1936. Later years and death They lived briefly in Kansas City and then moved in 1918 to Colorado Springs. They celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary on December 1, 1925.

Background Patients receiving radiotherapy have to be alone inside a lead-lined room, since only they can be exposed to the radiation, and also have to stay still during the treatment, with the necessary immobility being achieved through the use of a radiotherapy mask that covers the face and shoulders and is fastened to the treatment bed. Adult patients often find this claustrophobic and it can be particularly distressing for young children. Consequently, many young patients have required sedation with a general anaesthetic in order to meet the requirements of their radiotherapy. Implementation The use of magic string, simply a multi-coloured ball of twine, was learned about in 2007 by Lobke Marsden, a play specialist at the Bexley Wing oncology unit of St James's University Hospital in Leeds, as a low-cost solution to the problem of children's difficulties with radiotherapy. One end of the string is held by the patient and the other end by the parent. In 2017, Marsden told Ellen Wallwork of The Huffington Post, > \\"String is perfect for children that really need that connection with their > parents. They often give it a little tug, and the parents tug it back from > the other room to let the child know they are right there with them\\", adding > that, \\"It has proven to be the cheapest and one of the best pieces of > 'equipment' we own\\". Writing in The Guardian in June 2018, Rachel Clarke said, \\"Cheap as chips and priceless, magic string was created not for profit or personal gain ‚Äì but simply because someone cared\\".

Ivy Tech Community College, 853 F.3d 339 (7th Cir. 2017), was a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in which the Court held that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The ruling made the Seventh Circuit the first federal appeals court to find that sexual orientation is a protected class under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Educator Kimberly Hively sued Ivy Tech Community College for employment discrimination in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, alleging that Ivy Tech had unlawfully discriminated on the basis of her sexual orientation. The District Court dismissed the lawsuit, holding that Title VII does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. A three- judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the lawsuit, but the Seventh Circuit judges voted to rehear the case en banc, before all 11 judges of the Court of Appeals. Writing for the 8‚Äì3 majority, Chief Judge Diane Wood held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. Wood wrote that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation constitutes discrimination on the basis of sex, because if an employer discriminates on the basis of sex, a man in a relationship with a woman would not be discriminated against, but a woman in a relationship with a woman would be. Additionally, relying on the Supreme Court's decision in Loving v. Virginia, Wood wrote that discrimination on the basis of a person's partner's sex is tantamount to discrimination on the basis of sex. After the Seventh Circuit's ruling, the Supreme Court in 2020 came to the same conclusion in Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, holding that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Background  District Court Kimberly Hively, an openly lesbian educator, taught at Ivy Tech Community College as a part-time adjunct professor starting in 2000. In 2009, Hively asserted she was reprimanded for a kiss goodbye with her girlfriend in the parking lot of the school. After receiving a graduate degree in 2011, Hively applied for multiple full-time positions at Ivy Tech. Despite other educators who were hired after Hively having been given full-time positions, Hively was not. Further, her part-time contract was not renewed in 2014. Facing difficulty finding lawyers to take her case in Indiana, she filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against Ivy Tech without a lawyer (pro se) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The District Court dismissed the case in March 2015 on the basis that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation does not violate Title VII.  Seventh Circuit panel  After securing legal representation by Lambda Legal, an LGBT civil rights legal group, Hively appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. A panel of three 7th Circuit judges affirmed the dismissal of the case in July 2016. In its ruling, the panel noted that it had so ruled only because it was bound by prior precedent from 2000, and urged the full Seventh Circuit to reconsider them.The cases establishing the precedent included Hamner v. St. Vincent Hosp. & Health Care Ctr., Inc., 224 F.3d 701, 704 (7th Cir. 2000), and Spearman v. Ford Motor Co., 231 F.3d 1080, 1085 (7th Cir. 2000).  En banc proceedings  Following the panel ruling, Hively petitioned the Seventh Circuit to rehear the case en banc (before all 11 judges of the Court). In October 2016, the full Court voted to rehear the case and vacate the older ruling. The en banc Court heard arguments in the case in November 2016. Majority opinion Chief Judge Diane Wood delivered the opinion of the 8‚Äì3 majority. Chief Judge Diane Wood delivered the opinion of the Court in April 2017. By an 8‚Äì3 vote, the Seventh Circuit reversed the district court's dismissal and held that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Writing for the Court, Wood held that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation constitutes sex discrimination for two reasons. First, Wood analyzed Hively's claims by asking if she would have faced discrimination if she was male ‚Äì that is, whether a man in a relationship with a woman would have been discriminated against, assuming that Ivy Tech discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation. Wood concluded that because a man in Hively's position would not have faced discrimination, any discrimination Hively faced would constitute \\"paradigmatic sex discrimination.\\" In addition, relying on the Supreme Court's holding that discrimination for failure to conform to gender stereotypes constitutes sex discrimination, Wood wrote that homosexuality constitutes the \\"ultimate case of failure to conform to the female stereotype\\" and is thus protected by Title VII. Second, Wood held that discrimination basis of an employee's intimate partner constitutes \\"associational discrimination.\\" In Loving v. Virginia, the Supreme Court ruled that discrimination on the basis of a person's partner's race amounts to discrimination on the basis of race. Relying on the same reasoning, Wood held that discrimination on the basis of a person's partner's sex amounts to discrimination on the basis of sex. Accordingly, the Court reversed the dismissal of the lawsuit and remanded the case back to the District Court for further action. The Court did not find that Ivy Tech had discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation ‚Äì rather, the Court determined that the case should not have been dismissed. Concurrences Judge Flaum wrote a concurrence, which was joined by Judge Ripple. Flaum wrote that the text of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 justifies the majority's opinion. Flaum specifically noted that sex need only be a \\"motivating factor\\" in order for an action to constitute unlawful sex discrimination, and sex is naturally an element of an employer who discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation. Judge Posner also wrote a concurrence, in which he agreed that sex discrimination should be prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. However, taking a different approach than other judges in the majority, Posner wrote that judges should modify the interpretation of statutes based on their experiences. Noting the long time between the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the case before him, Posner wrote that interpreting sexual orientation to be protected by Title VII is necessary to \\"satisfy modern needs and understandings.\\" Dissent Judge Sykes wrote a dissent, in which Judges Bauer and Kanne joined. Sykes found fault with the majority's approach to statutory interpretation, writing that in 1964, when the Civil Rights Act was enacted, \\"sex\\" did not include sexual orientation. Sykes wrote that Congress has specifically prohibited discrimination on the basis of \\"sexual orientation\\" in addition to \\"sex\\", suggesting that Congress views the terms as covering distinct meanings. Sykes wrote that bias on the basis of sexual orientation is entirely distinct from bias on the basis of sex, and argued that any attempt to prohibit sexual orientation discrimination should come from Congress, not the judiciary. Aftermath Following the Seventh Circuit's ruling, Ivy Tech released a statement saying it \\"respects and appreciates\\" the Court's ruling and would not seek Supreme Court review of the ruling. Ivy Tech denied that it had engaged in any discrimination, and indicated that it would defend Hively's claims in the District Court. The parties reached a settlement in 2018. Legal developments The Court's decision in Hively made the Seventh Circuit the highest federal court to find sexual orientation discrimination unlawful. The New York Times called the ruling a \\"significant victory for gay rights\\" and noted that five of the eight judges in the majority were appointed by Republican presidents. The ruling resulted in a circuit split, which made it more likely that the Supreme Court would grant a petition for a writ of certiorari (i.e., to agree to review a case presenting a similar issue), although the defendant in Hively did not file a petition for certiorari. In Evans v. Georgia Regional Hospital, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, faced with an identical issue, came to the opposite ruling, holding in 2017 that Title VII's prohibition on employment discrimination \\"because of ... sex\\" does not apply to discrimination based on sexual orientation. The Supreme Court denied a cert petition in that case. In Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, the Supreme Court in 2020 held that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.

Background Ainslie completed her Bachelors of Science in Chemical engineering from Michigan State University in 1999. After working as an environmental engineer at Malcolm Pirnie, she began graduate school at Penn State as a fellow in the Huck Institutes of the Life Science. In 2003, she completed her Masters of Science in Chemical engineering under John Tarbell, focusing on shear stress modulation of vascular smooth muscle cell contraction. Two years later in 2005, she completed her PhD in Chemical engineering under Micheal Pishko, focusing on protein adhesion and cell responses to nanomaterials. After a brief post doc at the microcantilever start-up Protiveris, she worked with Lloyd Whitman at the United States Naval Research Laboratory. In 2006, she began a post doc at University of San Francisco in the Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences under the direction of Tejal Desai. The focus of Ainslie's research at UCSF was on microfabricated oral drug delivery carriers and immune responses to planar nanomaterials. Ainslie began her career as a tenure track Assistant Professor at Ohio State University in the School of Pharmacy in the Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Chemistry. In 2014, Ainslie moved to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy Division of Pharmacoengineering and Molecular Pharmaceutics as an Associate Professor. Career Ainslie has several areas of focus for her lab: * Advancement of acetalated dextran: Establishment of an ethanol producing version of acetalated dextran, in comparison to the methanol producing version first reported by Jean Fr√©chet. Exploiting the unique degradation rates of acetalated dextran, the Ainslie Lab was the first to show that fine tuning of antigen and adjuvant release can be used to optimize microparticulate vaccines. * Antigen specific immune tolerance: One of the first to apply microparticles for autoimmune therapeutic vaccines, using acetalated dextran to suppress disease related inflammation * Host-directed therapeutics: First identifying OSU-03012 antiparasitic activity against Leishmania donovani. To improve the delivery of this compound, since it has a narrow therapeutic window, the Ainslie lab encapsulated it in acetalated dextran microparticles and also applied the formulation for Salmonella enterica and Francisella tularensis infection. * Electrospray for vaccines: Reported the first use of electrospray for formation of protein based microparticle vaccines made of acetalated dextran. The application of electrospray was then expanded to encapsulate the hydrophillic STING agonist cGAMP. * Electrospun acetalated dextran nanofibers: Used for interstitial delivery of chemotherapeutics for glioblastoma.

She was a professor at Wellesley College and wrote several books, including Fundamentals of Spanish Grammar.  Early years and education  Bushee was born on December 4, 1867 in Worcester, Massachusetts. She grew up in Morrisville, Vermont. Bushee graduated from the Peoples Academy in 1886. In 1891, she graduated from Mount Holyoke College. She was the class valedictorian. Career After graduation, Bushee taught in schools in the United States. In 1893, she traveled to Europe to be a missionary where she was slated to work in San Sebastian. In San Sebastian, she worked as a librarian, math teacher and Spanish literature teacher at the International Institute for Girls in Spain (IIGS). In 1904, she organized the IIGS. When her father died in 1907, Bushee returned to the United States. Bushee graduated with a master's degree in Spanish from Boston University in 1909. She became a Spanish teacher at Wellesley College in 1911. Bushee published Fundamentals of Spanish Grammar in 1917 which was praised by Hispania as \\"nothing quite like it in modern language grammars published in this country.\\" The grammar book used a deductive method of language instruction. In 1931, she became the Helen J. Sanborn Chair of Spanish literature at Wellesley. Other accomplishments include recovering a \\"lost\\" volume of the book, The Sucesos of Mateo Alem√°n, which helped fill in missing history about Mateo Alem√°n's life in Mexico. Hispanic Review called Bushee an early pioneer in Hispanic studies in the United States. She published Three Centuries of Tirso de Molina in 1939 about theater of writer, Tirso de Molina. She later published a study about de Molina called La prudencia en la mujer in 1948. In 1936, Bushee retired to live with her family in Rhode Island. Bushee died on April 28, 1956 in Woonsocket in the hospital after an illness.

After nearly 15 years working for MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Heart worked for Bolt, Beranek and Newman from 1966 to 1994, during which he led a team that designed the first routing computer for the ARPANET, the predecessor to the Internet. Background Heart was born to a Jewish family in The Bronx, New York, and grew up in Yonkers. His father was an engineer at the Otis Elevator Company; his mother was an insurance agent. Entering as an electrical engineering major, Heart enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1947, entering a five-year master's degree program which he alternated semesters between work and school. During one summer, he worked as a power transformer tester at a General Electric factory. In 1951, he enrolled in MIT's new computer programming course taught by Gordon Welchman. Taking the course led Heart to complete his undergraduate coursework early. During his graduate studies, Heart was a research assistant on Whirlwind I, a computer that controlled an aircraft- tracking radar defense system; Whirlwind would be transferred to the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the on-campus military contractor. Heart received both bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering in 1952. Career At Lincoln Lab, Heart remained as a staff member after completing his master's degree. Eventually, Heart became a team lead for projects in building real- time computing systems where measuring devices gathered data by phone lines connected to computers. Katie Hafner and Matthew Lyon wrote about Heart's management style in their 1996 book Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet: In 1966, Heart left Lincoln Lab after being recruited by research and development company Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN). In August 1968, BBN won a request for proposal from ARPA to build the first Interface Message Processor (IMP), a computer that transmitted data and interconnected a network known today as a router. Jerry Elkind assigned Heart to be project manager. With Severo Ornstein as hardware lead and Will Crowther the software lead, Heart's team of ten engineers used a rugged Honeywell DDP-516 minicomputer to engineer the IMP, whose special function was to switch data among the computers on the ARPANET. The team also invented remote diagnostics for computers by equipping IMPs with remote control capabilities. By September 6, 1968, Heart's team finalized the nearly 200-page, $100,000 IMP proposal, which was BBN's most expensive project to date. The first IMP was installed at the University of California, Los Angeles on September 1, Labor Day of 1969, and the second was installed at the Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park, California, a month later on October 1. Heart, wrote Hafner and Lyon, had become \\"a highly regarded and valuable project manager\\" at BBN, because his teams had members \\"committed to a common mission rather than a personal agenda\\" and \\"who took personal responsibility for what they did.\\" Influenced by working at Lincoln Lab for Jay Forrester, the inventor of core memory, Heart prioritized reliability over cost, performance, or other factors, being \\"a most defensive driver when it came to engineering.\\" He also preferred that his programming teams code working products rather than simulations or software tools. By 1971, Heart's IMP team had grown to 30 and transitioned to a lighter Honeywell 316 for the IMP. In 1972, Heart appeared in the ARPANET documentary Computer Networks: The Heralds of Resource Sharing. In 1989, the federal government decommissioned ARPANET. Most of the IMPs were disassembled; a few remain in museums and computer labs. However, many of Heart's core principles, such as reliability and error detection and correction, still exist within the Internet. Heart's final position at BBN was as president of the systems and technology division; he would retire from BBN by the summer of 1994. In 2014, Heart was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame. Personal life While working at Lincoln Laboratory, Heart met Jane Sundgaard, one of the company's first women programmers. They married in 1959 and had three children, and the family lived in Lincoln, Massachusetts, during Heart's career at BBN. Jane Heart died in 2014. On June 24, 2018, Frank Heart died of melanoma at age 89 in a retirement community in Lexington, Massachusetts.

The winner is the most-approved candidate. It is a cardinal system, a variation of score and approval voting, and is also known as dis&approval; voting, balanced approval voting (BAV), approval with abstention option (AWAO), true weight voting (TWV1), or evaluative voting (EV) (though the latter can also be used for variants with more than 3 values.) It has also been called net approval voting (though this term has a different definition in the context of approval-based committee selection).  Procedure  310x310px Ballots contain a list of candidates, with 3 options next to each: \\"approve\\"/\\"disapprove\\"/\\"abstain\\", \\"for\\"/\\"against\\"/\\"neutral\\", or similar. The ballot warns that blanks for a candidate are scored as \\"indifferent\\" votes. Voters express their opinion of each candidate, and the votes are summed, with support = +1 and opposition = ‚àí1. The candidate with the largest score is the winner. It's also possible to use ballots with 2 options, \\"approve\\"/\\"disapprove\\" and treat blanks as abstentions. Unlike approval voting, in which non-approval could mean either disapproval or indifference, CAV allows explicit expression of disapproval, which is hoped to increase turnout, and reduce spoiled/blank ballots and insincere votes for unviable candidates. Some jurisdictions allow a \\"none of the above\\" option to express disapproval of all candidates, but ballots that allow disapproval of specific candidates are otherwise rare.  History  CAV has been independently invented many times. It was originally proposed by Dan Felsenthal in 1989. Claude Hillinger introduced the same concept in 2004 under the name \\"Evaluative Voting\\". Alcantud and Laruelle gave it the name \\"Dis&approval; voting\\" in 2016.  Properties  As this is mathematically equivalent to 3-level score voting, it shares the same properties. For instance, it is always safe for a voter to approve their honest favorite (the favorite betrayal criterion). While a (-1, 0, +1) scale is mathematically identical to a (0, 1, 2) scale, there are psychological differences between the two, and the introduction of negative ratings (combined with the change in scoring blanks as middle grades rather than lowest grades) changes the scores that candidates receive in each system. Studies of French voters in 2012 found that, while the highest-rated candidate was the same under either system, and the grades of \\"exclusive\\" (polarizing) candidates were relatively unchanged, there were slight increases in the scores of \\"inclusive\\" (broadly-liked) candidates, and large increases in the scores of lesser-known candidates. Unlike other score voting scales, CAV is compatible with existing voting machines that can handle voting for/against ballot initiatives.

West Lake has a combined area of , of which is covered by water. It has been designated as a National AAAAA-level Scenic Spot. History During the Eastern Han dynasty (25-220), West Lake is a field of wilderness. In the Eastern Jin dynasty (317-420), a Buddhist temple named \\"Longxing Temple\\" () was built near the lake. Emperor Xuanzong (712-756) changed Longxing Temple to \\"Kaiyuan Temple\\" () in the Tang dynasty (618-907). During the reign of Emperor Zhongzong (684), Sizhou Tower was completed in West Mountain. In the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127), General Zhang Zhaoyuan () honored the lake as \\"Langguan Lake\\" (). In 1066, Magistrate Chen Cheng () enlarged the lake and added several bridges, towers and pavilions, during that time, the lake more commonly known as \\"Feng Lake\\" (; Feng means a bumper harvest.) In 1094, Su Shi was exiled to Huizhou, where he lived for three years. Su Shi wrote a lot of poetry about West Lake. In his poem Presenting Tanxiu (), he compared Feng Lake to West Lake in Hangzhou, which became the earliest record of the name of West Lake. In 1096, the locals erected causeway named \\"Su Causeway\\" () and the Xixin Bridge () in memory of Su Shi. That same year, Wang Zhaoyun, the most beloved concubine of Su Shi, was buried in the side of West Lake. Su Shi established a pavilion named \\"Liuru Pavilion\\" () to commemorate her. In 1244, in the 4th year of Chunyou period of the Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279), locals founded the Juxian Hall () within the West Lake, which was renamed \\"Fenghu Academy\\" () later. It is the highest school during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Now the Fenghu Academy was rebuilt in 1801 by Magistrate Yi Bingshou (). From the 1950s to the 1980s, the area of the West Lake has been reduced by 46% because of real estate development. In 2007, the Huizhou Municipal Government has allocated 150 million yuan for the reconstruction project.

Their sound and style combine elements of punk, rockabilly, gothic rock, metal and rock and roll. Since their formation, Stellar Corpses have continued to tour both in the US as well as internationally. Previously, Dusty played upright bass in Santa Cruz Rockabilly band, but had also been writing songs for a Harder, Darker side Project. In 2005, Stellar Corpses, which means \\"Dead Stars\\" played their first show on Halloween of that year. In addition to touring to promote their studio releases, Stellar Corpses have shared the stage many acts including Nekromantix, Tiger Army, The Misfits, Agent Orange, Michale Graves, Hollywood Undead, 45 Grave, Swingin' Utters and The Damned. Since their inception they have released records through Hairball 8 Records, FiendForce Records, Chapter 11 Records and Batcave Records. Their music has also been featured in the television series Road Trip Masters. Singer Dusty Grave also plays upright bass for the band BAT! signed to Cleopatra Records and plays lead guitar for Rezurex. Respect the Dead EP Stellar Corpses' first EP, Respect The Dead, was independently released in 2007 on their own label, Santa Carla Records, named after \\"The Lost Boys\\" (1987) filmed in their hometown, Santa Cruz. The EP was recorded at The Compound Recording Studios in Santa Cruz by Joe Clements (Singer of Fury 66). Stellar Corpses is said to have made an immediate impact in their genre with songs such as ‚ÄúCemetery Man‚Äù and ‚ÄúLeave A Stellar Corpse.‚Äù Welcome to the Nightmare Following a five-week European tour with Rezurex, Stellar Corpses released their first full-length album in 2009 entitled, \\"Welcome to the Nightmare\\" named after an underground psychobilly zine from Santa Cruz. The album was released in 2009 on Santa Carla Records in the US and FiendForce Records in Germany. The album has been called a \\"deadly delight\\" and is said to feature more of the band's influences, without losing any of the power and fury of their debut EP as well as \\"a competent, driven, and ultimately rather enjoyable take on the narrowly defined genre\\". Vampire Kiss On Halloween 2011, Stellar Corpses released the single \\"Vampire Kiss\\" which debuted at No. 9 on the alternative radio charts Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and F.M.B.Q. and hosted a music video premiere at The Viper Room in Hollywood. The music video for \\"Vampire Kiss\\", directed by Justin Janowitz stars Alycia Paulsen and features cameos by Hunter Burgan of the band AFI and producer Joe McGrath as vampires. The video was filmed on location at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and at Bethel Encino Church in the city of Encino.

The title track is an homage to the \\"dead stars\\" of Hollywood including Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, Bela Lugosi and Maila Nurmi, also known as Vampira. The songs \\"Vampire Kiss\\", \\"Evil Dead\\" and \\"Dead Stars Drive-In\\" feature backing vocals from Hunter Burgan (AFI bassist). \\"Be Still My Heart\\" features sound design by Jade Puget (AFI guitarist). ‚ÄúTwisted Fantasy‚Äù features guest vocals by Michale Graves (former Misfits singer).

It is home to the 482nd Fighter Wing (482 FW) of the Air Force Reserve Command's Tenth Air Force (10 AF), as well as the headquarters of Special Operations Command South. Homestead Air Force Base was destroyed by Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and subsequently rebuilt.  History  World War II leftThe installation was named Homestead Army Air Field on 16 September 1942 as a base for the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, and construction began the next day. Homestead opened as an Air Transport Command (ATC) ferry airfield in November; ATC pilots were trained at the base from February 1943 in the C-46, C-54 and C-87 aircraft. The base was heavily damaged by a hurricane in September 1945, resulting in its inactivation on 14 December 1945. When the U.S. Air Force was established as a separate service on 18 September 1947, the old Homestead AAF lay in ruins.https://www.homestead.afrc.af.mil/Portals/134/Documents/History%20of%20Homestead%20Air%20Reserve%20Base%20%204%20Apr%202018.pdf?ver=2018-07-26-132208-790 Cold War Reactivated for the Cold War as a Strategic Air Command (SAC) installation, an advance arrived at the old base in the summer of 1954 and initiated clean-up and reconstruction efforts. Renamed as Homestead Air Force Base on 1 February 1955. The 379th Bomb Wing was activated at Homestead on 1 November 1955. It replaced the 4276th Air Base Squadron at Homestead in November 1955 and spent the next few months becoming organized and manned. It received B-47 Stratojet and KC-97 Stratotankers in April 1956 and began training for strategic bombardment and air refueling operations. The wing moved to Wurtsmith Air Force Base, Michigan without equipment in January 1961 in preparation for transition to the B-52 Stratofortress and KC-135 Stratotanker. The 19th Bomb Wing moved to Homestead in April 1956 and also flew the B-47 and KC-97. On 1 July 1961, it was redesignated as the 19th Bomb Wing (Heavy) and began converting to B-52s and KC-135s. The wing \\"moved without personnel or equipment to Robins AFB, Georgia\\", on 25 July 1968 and \\"absorbed resources of the 465th Bombardment Wing.\\" In 1962, the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing, a unit of the Tactical Air Command (TAC), relocated to Homestead from George Air Force Base, California with its F-100 Super Sabre jet fighters and established itself as a TAC tenant unit at Homestead, the base remaining under SAC control. With the impending departure of the 19th Bomb Wing, control of Homestead passed from SAC to TAC on 1 July 1968. However, with the 31 TFW deployed to Southeast Asia, the 4531st Tactical Fighter Wing was established as a provisional unit for host wing duties at Homestead pending the return of the 31 TFW in 1970.  Hurricane Andrew  Homestead AFB after Hurricane Andrew severely damaged the base on 27 August 1992. As Hurricane Andrew approached South Florida in late August 1992, the base evacuated their F-16 fighter aircraft to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio and their Air Force Reserve HC-130 and HH-60 rescue aircraft to Patrick Air Force Base near Cocoa Beach, Florida. Base personnel and their families were under evacuation orders prior to the arrival of the Category 5 storm. The planes and essential personnel stayed in Ohio until April 1993, at which point they were transferred to MacDill Air Force Base near Tampa, Florida. The stay at MacDill was short lived as the wing returned to Homestead in March 1994. During this time the base was on the Base Realignment and Closure Commission's initial base closings list, potentially dooming the base to closure. However, in the end the base was converted from an active duty base to its present-day reserve base status with the 482d Fighter Wing and its F-16 aircraft as the host wing, while concurrently maintaining a 24/7/365 alert detachment of F-15 Eagle fighter aircraft from the Florida Air National Guard's 125th Fighter Wing.

History Frederiksborgvej seen on a drawing by Janus Laurentius Ridter with Bispebjerg Windbill just visible to the right Frederiksborgvej was part of the road that Christian IV established in circa 1620 betweenVopenhagen and Frederiksborg Castle. The road ran across Bispebjerg Hill. The land belonged to the farms in the village of Emdrup. It belonged to the parish of Br√∏nsh√∏j. In 1870 the City of Copenhagen began to by up land in the area and the civil parish of Br√∏nsh√∏k-Husum was merged into Copenhagen in 1901. The area along the road was gradually built over with a combination of housing and industry. Glud og Marstrand occupied a large site bounded by Grederiksborgvej, Rentemestervej, Rebslagervej and Drejervej. Notable buildings and residents Grundtvig's Church seen from Frederiksborgvej The most notable landmark along the street is Grundtvig's Church.

The property is owned by the Broken Hill Historical Society. It now houses the Synagogue of the Outback Museum. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Broken Hill Synagogue is one of only three purpose-built synagogues in rural New South Wales. A Jewish community began to develop in Broken Hill in the 1880s. The Jewish cemetery was consecrated on 17 May 1891, with the founders of the Broken Hill Hebrew Congregation arriving after 1891. The synagogue was established \\"almost exclusively\\" by Jews of Lithuanian and Ukrainian backgrounds, such that Jewish life in Broken Hill \\"reflected the orthodox practice of nineteenth century Russian Jewry\\". A meeting in 1900 decided to establish a formal congregation and build a synagogue at Broken Hill. Initial attempts to raise building funds were unsuccessful, but found success later that decade, and a site was purchased in July 1907. From 1900 until the completion of the synagogue, Jewish services were held in the Masonic Hall. The foundation stone for the synagogue was placed on 30 November 1910, and the synagogue was consecrated on 26 February 1911. The synagogue's Torah scrolls were presents from the Adelaide congregation. The debt from the building's construction had been paid off by October 1914. By 1961, the number of identifiable Jews in Broken Hill had decreased to fifteen. The synagogue closed in 1962, with the Sefer Torah scrolls transferred to the Yeshiva in the Melbourne suburb of St Kilda. The building had fallen into disrepair and was described as \\"derelict\\" at the time of its closure. Following the synagogue's closure, the building served as a private residence. It was purchased by the Broken Hill Historical Society in 1990, who restored the property. It now serves as the Synagogue of the Outback Museum and houses the Broken Hill Historical Society. A replica Sefer Torah was installed in the museum in 2017. The building suffered $140,000 in hailstorm damage in 2017. Despite advocacy by the state opposition, it was overlooked by the state government for heritage funding to cover the repairs in the 2017 budget.

Common powdery food products include milk powder, tea powder, cocoa powder, coffee powder, soybean flour, wheat flour, and chili powder. Powders are particulate discrete solid particles of size ranging from nanometres to millimetres that generally flow freely when shaken or tilted. The bulk powder properties are the combined effect of particle properties by the conversion of food products in solid state into powdery form for ease of use, processing and keeping quality. Various terms are used to indicate the particulate solids in bulk, such as powder, granules, flour and dust, though all these materials can be treated under powder category. These common terminologies are based on the size or the source of the materials. The particle size, distribution, shape and surface characteristics and the density of the powders are highly variable and depend on both the characteristics of the raw materials and processing conditions during their formations. These parameters contribute to the functional properties of powders, including flowability, packaging density, ease of handling, dust forming, mixing, compressibility and surface activity.  Characteristics   Microstructure  Figure shows image of crystalline (above) and amorphous (below) state of powder. Food powder may be amorphous or crystalline in their molecular level structure. Depending on the process applied, the powders can be produced in either of these forms. Powders in crystalline state possess defined molecular alignment in the long-range order, while amorphous state is disordered, more open and porous. Common powders found in crystalline states are salts, sugars and organic acids. Meanwhile, many food products such as dairy powders, fruit and vegetable powders, honey powders and hydrolysed protein powders are normally in amorphous state. The properties of food powders including their functionality and their stability are highly dependent on these structures. Many of the desired and important properties of the food materials can be achieved by altering these structures.  Powder surface composition and total surface area Powder is a particulated food with a large interfacial area. Food is a composite mixture of mainly protein, carbohydrate, fat and minerals. These components can absorb water molecules in their active hydration sites. The amount and rate of water adsorption depends on the bulk and particles‚Äô surface composition, total particle surface area (particle size), internal porosity and molecular structure. As the particulated foods (powders) have a larger surface area and broken chemical structure at the interface compared with the bulk food, water hydration rate and absolute hydration capacity is larger than in the bulk material of same species. Powder also has a composite surface with various sized capillaries and geometrical patterns which results in slow penetration of water. Powders with a high amount of low molecular weight carbohydrates or protein are hygroscopic (uptake moisture quickly), thus dissolve with ease. Crystalline powders are slow to dissolve because the dissolution needs to progress from outside to inside as the water molecules cannot penetrate quickly due to the tight molecular structure of crystals.  Formation  In many processing situations, the powder forms are essential, such as in mixing and dissolution. Powder particles are created from bulk solid materials by dehydration and grinding.  Dehydration  Tomato in food dehydrator Drying (dehydrating) is one of the oldest and easiest methods of food preservation. Dehydration is the process of removing water or moisture from a food product by heating at right temperature as well as containing air movement and dry air to absorb and carry the released moisture away. Reducing the moisture content of food prevents the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria, yeast and molds and slows down enzymatic reactions that take place within food. The combination of these events helps to prevent spoilage in dried food. The foods can be dried using several methods either in the sun or oven or even food dehydrator. However, sun dried method requires warm days of 29.4 ¬∞C or higher, low humidity and insect control while oven-baked is less efficient as it may destroy the nutrients of the food. It is recommended to use electric hot air food dehydrator which is simple and easy to design, construct and maintain. In fact, it is very affordable and has been reported to retain most of the nutritional properties of food if dry using appropriate drying conditions.  Grinding  Grinding is the process of breaking solid food items into smaller particles including powders by using food processors.

It was released worldwide on October 22, 2019 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. It is the twenty-first game in the WWE game series and the seventh under the WWE 2K banner. The sequel to WWE 2K19, 2K20 is the first game in the series to not be developed by Yuke's, which developed every entry in the series since its inception in 2000. They were replaced by Visual Concepts, who had previously worked with Yuke's as co- developers. WWE 2K20 received negative reviews, with critics noting a regression in quality compared to its predecessor. The game has since gained notoriety in both the wrestling and gaming community for its bugs at launch and technical issues. The game's successor, WWE 2K Battlegrounds, was released in September 2020. Gameplay Game modes WWE 2K20's 2K Showcase mode revolves around the Four Horsewomen of WWE (Bayley, Becky Lynch, Charlotte Flair and Sasha Banks). The 2K Towers mode, first introduced in WWE 2K19, made its return to the series. WWE 2K20 features a female MyCareer story alongside its male story, the first for 2K. (Previous THQ games had female career/stories) The WWE Towers Mode Returned, with one of the towers centered around Roman Reigns, with matches with unique commentary from Extreme Rules in 2013 to Stomping Grounds in 2019. Development WWE 2K20 is the first game in the series to be solely developed by Visual Concepts; previous entries were co-developed by Yuke's. Eminem was reported to be curating the soundtrack of the game early in development, but talks with the rapper fell through after the news was leaked before it was made official. The game was formally announced on August 5, 2019, with a trailer announcing Becky Lynch and Roman Reigns as cover stars. This marks the first game in the WWE 2K series to feature a female cover star (most recently, THQ's WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 featured Torrie Wilson on the NTSC cover of the game), and the first game since WWE All Stars to have more than one cover star.  Release  The collectors' edition, the \\"SmackDown 20th Anniversary Edition\\", featured the return of Chyna as a playable character, who has not been featured in a WWE video game since WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role in 2000. The game also featured the return of WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan, who last appeared in WWE 2K15.  Downloadable content  Four DLC expansions were released for the game under the banner \\"WWE 2K Originals\\", which include Showcase episodes, arenas, and character skins and accessories based on fantasy settings. All DLC expansions (except for \\"Bump in the Night\\") were made available as part of a season pass, while the season pass was bundled with the Deluxe and SmackDown 20th Anniversary Edition SKUs of the game. The first, \\"Bump in the Night\\" (which was also included as a pre-order bonus), is a horror-themed expansion centered upon Bray Wyatt's \\"The Fiend\\" persona, the second expansion \\"Wasteland Wanderers\\" is a dystopian-themed expansion centered upon Seth Rollins, the third is based on WWE's digital series Southpaw Regional Wrestling (a parody of local wrestling promotions in the 1980s), and the fourth, \\"Empire of Tomorrow\\", carries a futuristic theme and a focus on female characters. Reception Following the departure of Yuke's, WWE 2K20 received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" on all platforms according to review aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers criticized the physics, graphics, targeting, change in controls and the numerous glitches. Brian Mazique of Forbes stated that \\"while a few of the legacy strengths such as the creation suite are still strong, the most important part, the gameplay is in a bad place.\\" For IGN Brian Fowler said the game was a \\"mess\\", and that the game's quality had degraded since its predecessor, and many of the character models looked like they had \\"crawled out of a PS2-era wrestling game.\\" GamesRadar+s Ben Wilson gave the verdict that \\"WWE 2K20 plays like a work-in-progress demo that‚Äôs yet to be stress-tested - but there‚Äôs a decent game somewhere under the hot mess.\\" Writing for GameSpot, Richard Wakeling criticized the MyCareer mode, the new control layout and the numerous technical issues, and declared as the worst of the WWE 2K series, and the moment the series \\"hit rock bottom.\\" The game received notable backlash on social media platforms, where the hashtag #FixWWE2K20 began trending. At the start of 2020, the game was rendered almost unplayable due to a \\"Y2k20\\" bug. WWE 2K20 was named among the worst games of 2019 by IGN, Metacritic, Mint and PlayStation Universe. Series future In April 2020, former WWE video games writer Justin Leeper reported that the successor to WWE 2K20, WWE 2K21 had been cancelled. The decision was made due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the video game industry and the poor sales and reception for 2K20. Leeper would go on to state that 2K would publish a different WWE game in 2020, while WWE 2K22 will be released in 2021 for current gen consoles and \\"probably\\" PCs. On April 27, 2020, 2K announced the spin-off title WWE 2K Battlegrounds which was released in September 2020 to a mixed reception.

Life and work  Kallas attended middle school in Tallinn from 1954 to 1962. He left the school without a degree. From 1962 to 1965, he was a soldier in the Red Army in Palanga. He then began his literary and journalistic career. In 1958, Kallas debuted as a writer in short prose in Estonian newspapers. After a few short prose texts and writing youth literature, his debut novel, Nii palju p√§ikest, was released in 1964. In 1965 and 1966, Kallas was a literary editor on Estonian television, before he was employed by the editorial office of Looming from 1968 to 1970. Subsequently, he wrote for Estonian newspapers. Among other things, he was an editor for Vaba Maa, S√µnumileht and Postimees.Eesti Elulood. In 1969, Kallas was arrested by the KGB, who accused him of anti-Soviet propaganda. He spent several months in prison. There he wrote his surrealist novel Heliseb-k√µliseb..., released in 1972. In 1972 he joined the Estonian Writers Association. In the 1980s, he was a member of the board of writers association. Kallas' novel Niguliste (\\"St. Nicholas' Church\\") was written between 1967 and 1972. It appeared only after the end of Soviet rule in Estonia in 1990 in a revised and expanded two-volume edition: \\"The novel is the typical description of a 'lost generation', their dreams and ideals loses and perishes itself, and as such was a post-1968 document. Its failure to appear in the early 1970s, however, was more attributable to the laziness of the author than censorship, for internal criticism was by no means devastating or insurmountable. Kallas just turned to other things, which is why the novel was left lying.\\"Cornelius Hasselblatt: Geschichte der estnischen Literatur. Kallas also wrote some radio dramas as well as screenplays for television films and series, such as the successful television series √ïnne 13. In addition, he translated prose from Russian (Vasily Aksyonov, Alexander Grin) and from English (Stephen King). From 1979 to 1990, Kallas belonged to the Communist Party of Estonia. During the period of transition between the end of the Soviet Union and the regaining of Estonian independence, he co-chaired the parliamentary group of the democratic opposition movement Popular Front of Estonia, voting for the Estonian restoration of Independence. Subsequently, Kallas was active in various political parties. Since 1998, he has been an independent.

Carey was a landmark case in the New York County Supreme Court that established the duty of New York State to provide shelter for homeless men. It was brought in 1979 as a class action suit, the first such suit by advocates for the homeless in the United States, and settled with the negotiation in 1981 of a consent decree governing the provision of homeless shelters by New York City. Background During the 1970s, the number of homeless people in New York City expanded noticeably. Section I of Article XVII of the New York State Constitution, passed as an amendment in 1938 at the urging of New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia, reads: > The aid, care and support of the needy are public concerns and shall be > provided by the state and by such of its subdivisions, and in such manner > and by such means, as the legislature may from time to time determine.Ian > Frazier, \\"Hidden City\\", The New Yorker, October 28, 2013; reprinted in Hogs > Wild: Selected Reporting Pieces, New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2016, > . Robert Hayes, a 26-year-old graduate of New York University Law School working for Sullivan & Cromwell, had discussed the plight of the homeless with two friends studying at Columbia University, Ellen Baxter and Kim Hopper, who had interviewed many homeless persons. He decided to bring a class action suit on the basis of the constitutional provision, acting pro bono. Lawsuit Hayes brought suit in October 1979 in New York County Supreme Court (the trial court for Manhattan) against the state in the person of the then governor, Hugh L. Carey, on behalf of three homeless men who said the city had sometimes offered them no emergency accommodations and other times offered them only beds in the \\"Big Room\\", a substandard overflow area in a former municipal shelter. The lead plaintiff was Robert Callahan, a 53-year-old former short-order cookMary Ellen Hombs, American Homelessness: A Reference Handbook, Contemporary World Issues, 2nd ed. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 1994, , p. 28. and Bowery alcoholic (who was found dead soon after the case was decided). It was Hayes' first experience trying a case; he argued from the intent of the supporters and drafters of the amendment as represented in documents from the time, and specifically on the word \\"shall\\", and presented arguments that the city's Men's Shelter provided insufficient beds and that what shelter was available was unsafe and unhealthy.Donna Wilson Kirchheimer, \\"Sheltering the Homeless in New York City: Expansion in an Era of Government Contraction \\", Political Science Quarterly 104.4 (Winter 1989-1990) 607-23, p. 620. When arguments ended in late October, Hayes requested an expedited ruling in view of approaching winter. Justice Andrew Tyler ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on December 5, 1979,Callahan v. Carey, No. 42582/79, New York Superior Court, New York County; ESCR.net. holding that under the state constitution \\"the Bowery derelicts are entitled to Board and lodging\\" and that the city had not made adequate provision for housing \\"all of the destitute and homeless alcoholics, addicts, mentally impaired derelicts, flotsam and jetsam, and others during the winter months\\".Maria Foscarinis, \\"The Evolution of Homelessness: Trends and Future Directions\\", in Robert Hartmann McNamara, ed., Homelessness in America, Volume 3: Solutions to Homelessness, Westport, Connecticut / London: Prager, 2008, , pp. 113‚Äì32, pp. 115‚Äì16. A temporary injunction directed the city to provide emergency beds. The suit had asked for 750, which the city requested be replaced by a flexible provision; the number it had to provide rapidly rose to 1,000 per night. Disputes and court orders arising from Callahan concerned many aspects of the administration of New York City facilities for the homeless. A consent decree negotiated under the court's auspices and finalized on August 26, 1981 recorded the state's obligation to provide \\"food, shelter, supervision and security\\"Sara H. Strauss and Andrew E. Tomback, \\"Homelessness: Halting the Race to the Bottom\\", Yale Law & Policy Review 3.2 (Spring 1985) 551‚Äì70, p. 554, note 14. to all homeless men applying, and set standards for shelters and emergency hotel accommodations for which the homeless were issued vouchers, including capacity limits, staff to resident ratios, and specifications regarding beds, bathroom facilities, and additional services, such as mail, telephone, laundry, and secure storage, and also required the city to report regularly on the state of the shelters to the plaintiffs' attorneys. The consent decree preempted a definitive court ruling on the constitutional right to shelter. In a 2003 appellate court ruling, it was held not to be violated by the withholding of shelter for 30 days to conform with changed welfare rules. Long-term effects The case led in New York State to Eldredge v. Koch, decided in December 1982, in which the right to accommodation established in Callahan was extended to homeless women, and McCain v. Koch, decided in May 1986, which extended it to homeless families; further litigation determined that people with AIDS must also be housed. It also led to Hayes, Baxter, and Hopper founding the Coalition for the Homeless in 1981. Advocates for the homeless in other states and the District of Columbia followed suit in seeking to establish a right to housing through the courts. It has been argued that the choice of the courts as the avenue for seeking assistance for the homeless and the failure to involve the poor and minorities led to a system that diverted resources, reduced goodwill, and may have further reduced the supply of permanent housing available to poor families.J. Phillip Thompson, \\"The Failure of Liberal Homeless Policy in the Koch and Dinkins Administration\\", Political Science Quarterly 111.4 (Winter 1996-1997) 639‚Äì60.

The Liman traditionalist Ricardo Palma, in one of his tradiciones peruanas, affirms that during the Viceroy Gabriel de Avil√©s's government the factory of the Barracks of Santa Catalina was started for an artillery barracks, under the direction of the then colonel, and later Viceroy, Don Joaqu√≠n de la Pezuela.Read the Tradici√≥n of Ricardo Palma: Nadie se muere hasta que Dios quiere ‚Äì Cr√≥nica de la √©poca del trig√©simo s√©ptimo Virrey del Per√∫. Final statement this island is full of trash litter and don't go to it  Location  The Cuartel de Santa Catalina is located at the jir√≥n Inambari, corner with block 12 of the jir√≥n Andahuaylas (Calle Costado del Cuartel), in the Plazuela de Santa Catalina in the Barrios Altos of Lima.  Description  Exterior The fa√ßade shows a corner tower, made of adobe and arranged in a slope. The large wooden entrance to the barracks is of neoclassical style, with neoclassical pilasters of Corinthian and Ionic capitals and reduced arch in a circle segment. Also present are a square wooden tower ‚Äì now without clock ‚Äì gutters (old cannons embedded in front of the door), flanking towers, merlons, stylized and with arrowslits, and a merlon wall with a modillion. On the Barracks of Santa Catalina the notable Liman scholar, architect H√©ctor Velarde, points out: C√©sar MIRO, from El Comercio newspaper of Lima, in relation to the facade of Fort of Santa Catalina, makes the following description: Interior  Regarding the interior of the Fort of Santa Catalina, C√©sar MIRO, of the El Comercio newspaper of Lima, makes the following description: When crossing the large wooden entrance door to the barracks, a cobblestone entryway with pebble leads us to the main courtyard, or that of arms, with setts, which has been partially restored. In the center of the courtyard still remains the old flagpole of the barracks and an old cannon of artillery at its side; to the right you can see a two-story block with a colonial balcony that is in a semi- rutted state; Inside the barracks you can see the facilities that served in other times of administrative offices which have already been restored to be used as classrooms and offices; You can also see the cell and the offices with large colonial-revival-style windows that face the fa√ßade. The most used construction materials in the factory of the barrack, and that can be seen, are the adobe and the stone, the quincha being used in the case of the second floor of the block. It is also noted the use of wood as a building material through the large square tower and the colonial balcony of the officers block. On the other hand, some elements such as the floors are also made of tongue- and-groove wood, in addition to the stairs that connect to the upper floors. All the exterior windows of the building are protected with simple design metalwork as was customary in the neoclassical period.  History   Viceroyalty  Portrait of the Viceroy of Peru Jos√© Fernando de Abascal y Souza, Marquis of la Concordia, who, during his term in office, ordered the construction of the Barracks of artillery of Santa Catalina de Lima In 1698, Monastery of la Concepci√≥n gave in emphyteusis for 150 years the land of the so-called orchard of \\"Cuero\\" or \\"Perdida\\" to Juan del √Åguila Angulo who indicated the emphyteusis in favor to Francisco de Z√∫√±iga Sotomayor. Upon the death of the beneficiary, the \\"empiteusis\\" is sold and transferred to Pedro Tramarr√≠a, who points out how his wife, Do√±a Nicolasa de la Presa, would benefit. The heirs of this signed a perpetual lease deed with Colonel Don Joaqu√≠n de la Pezuela, Internal Sub-Inspector and General Commander of the new Department of Spanish Artillery, representing the government. In this way, the already existing project to build a barracks, intended for the artillery corps (heavy war material, cannons, mortars, howitzers, etc.) and that would also have specialized personnel in maestranza (cavalry) and gunpowder manufacturing, became a reality on Friday August 22 of 1806, the date on which the work was begun as shown on a plaque that was on the main fa√ßade and that currently does not exist, by provision of the then Viceroy Jos√© Fernando de Abascal y Sousa, Marquis of la Concordia, who exercised command in the period 1806-1816, recording this fact in his \\"Memoria de Gobierno\\" and under the direction of the Sub-Inspector of Spanish Artillery Joaqu√≠n de la Pezuela, ten years later Viceroy of Peru. The reason for the creation of this barracks, which initially, according to the aforementioned plaque, carried the name \\"Cuartel de artiller√≠a de Santa Catalina de Lima\\", was to reinforce the security of the capital to face the attacks of the English who sought to seize the Spanish colonies for the wealth they possessed. Another important reason was to give a new organization to the viceregal artillery corps. In this way, and with all these advances, the barracks allowed a better organization of the artillery and the increase of its strength. Over the years, the barracks are not only occupied by the artillery of the Royalist Army but also by the infantry and cavalry of the Royalist Army but always alternately. It is at this time that the Fort of Santa Catalina became the best Spanish bastion of South America. From there, arms and troops were sent to the other governorships and the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata to debase any revolutionary uprising against the Spanish crown.  Emancipation  During the period of Emancipation, this barracks was used by both royalists and patriots who took advantage of their workshops and venues to shelter.  Republic  Upon the establishment of the Republic, the supply of war material was made, as in the Viceroyalty, through the General Commandcy of Artillery, which centralized the stores of the Park, the Maestranza and the Powder Factory. The first two units continued to operate in the Barracks of Santa Catalina until the end-19th century. In the Fort of Santa Catalina was deposited, being there for several years, the coat or \\"leva\\" that the Marshal of Peru Agust√≠n Gamarra was wearing at the Battle of Ingavi on November 18 of 1841. In 1845 the construction of the Escuela de Aplicaci√≥n de Artiller√≠a (Artillery Application School) began, which was located within the barracks facilities but with defined areas. This would become the antecedent of the Military College that years later would replace it. Fort of Santa Catalina. Photo of the first half of the 1870s. During the coup d'√©tat against the President Jos√© Balta y Montero occurred at 2 o'clock atafternoon of July 22 of 1872, the Army Colonel Tom√°s Guti√©rrez, took the decision to move, on July 26 of 1872, to the Barracks of Santa Catalina with the Government Palace's troops and of the Infantry Battalion ‚ÄúZepita‚Äù N¬∫ 3 of his brother the Army Colonel Marceliano Guti√©rrez. In front to the Barracks of Santa Catalina several barricades were erected. The water and gas pipelines connected to the Barracks of Santa Catalina were cut. At about 9 o'clock at night, while firing rifles and cannons, Tom√°s Guti√©rrez and his brother the Army Colonel Marcelino Guti√©rrez left with their troops. The besiegers of Barracks of Santa Catalina retreated and momentarily disconcerted. During the War of the Pacific, the Artillery Barracks of Santa Catalina had John White Canyons which were a copy of the Vavasseur model 71 of 55 mm, with some variants. In January 1881, the Chilean army that entered Lima, on the 17th of that month, entered the Barracks of Santa Catalina looting all the war material that it possessed and carrying weapons of inestimable historical value.

In the 1890s the Fort of Santa Catalina was seat of the Brigade of Artillery of Campaign of Mountain of the Peruvian Army. In those years, every July 28, the date of the national anniversary of Peru, a salve of artillery was practiced in the Fort of Santa Catalina when the sun just appeared on the horizon, announcing the advent of the day when the Protector Supreme Generalissimo Don Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, proclaimed the independence of Peru, that same day the Honor Guard of the Government Palace, main door, and Fuerte Santa Catalina covered it the School of Classes.

At the early-20th- century the Park and the Maestranza, that were in the facilities of the Barracks of Santa Catalina, move to the Barracks Barbones. Other historical events of which this barracks was witness have been mainly popular riots, political assassinations, coup d'√©tat and rebellions of the army troop occurred throughout the history of the republic. The February 4 of 1914 occurred the coup d'√©tat against the President Guillermo Billinghurst. The Infantry Battalion ‚ÄúCaquet√°‚Äù N¬∫ 9, which at that time was stationed in the Barracks of Santa Catalina, was one of the Combat Units of the Garrison of Lima under the command of Colonel EP √ìscar Raimundo Benavides Larrea, resigning chief of the General Staff of the Peruvian Army, who joined the military uprising. During this coup d'√©tat, the Minister of War and Navy General of the Brigade EP Enrique Varela Vidaurre was assassinated, at the Barracks of Santa Catalina, who on the night of February 3 of 1914 went to spend the night there. In that same year (1914) the President of the Republic Colonel EP √ìscar R. Benavides ordered the decomposition of the Mountain Artillery Regiment No. 3, which at the time also had its headquarters in the Barracks Santa Catalina of Lima, highlighting an Artillery Group (one of the two fractions), to the city of Arequipa which was established in a plots of Tingo donated by Mr. Gonzalo Vivanco in a recently created camp, with ashlar and adobe material. Little remembered is the case of the lifting of the classes and soldiers of the Infantry Regiment No. 5, stationed at that time, in the Barracks of Santa Catalina, on March 23 of 1931 and that was commanded by Sergeant 2¬∫ EP V√≠ctor Faustino Huapaya Chac√≥n, a carpenter and son of a seller of vegetables from Chorrillos. At that time, the Barracks of Santa Catalina was the equivalent of the current 18th Armored Brigade of the Peruvian Army. The mutineers seized their bosses in the dining room and then took to the streets with tanks and firing machine guns and rifles, after leaving a garrison for the defense of the Barracks. They toured the city without a specific plan. They tried to take the Ministry of Government and Police, being repelled by the Republican Guard, and the Government Palace, failing completely. They took the towers of some churches and rang the bells causing alarm in the population. Faced with the repressive attitude of the rest of the Army, the insurgents were forced to return to the Barracks of Santa Catalina, where they were besieged by government troops made up of contingents from the Artillery Regiment No. 2 of the Chorrillos Military School and of Republican Guard Regiment. To parley, the Minister of Government and Police Francisco Tamayo, War Minister Commander EP Gustavo Jim√©nez and a group of officers entered the Barracks of Santa Catalina and were received by Sergeant Huapaya, who wore an official officer's belt and an officer's sword on his belt. and the incumbent classes who presented the parliamentarians with a list of demands that, among other things, demanded: the execution of the former president Augusto B. Legu√≠a, overthrown in 1930 by the Commander EP Luis Miguel S√°nchez Cerro and that he was prisoner and sick; the separation of all the high chiefs of the Army and the construction of hygienic barracks. Commander Jim√©nez rejected the list of claims presented by the rebels and removed the sword to Huapaya. The fight resumed and as she continued two planes threw grenades in the courtyard of the Barracks of Santa Catalina. At that, the rebels surrendered. Between dead and injured there were more than 40 casualties. A War Council sentenced Sergeant Huapaya to twenty years in prison; but the Governing Board of David Samanez Ocampo granted him a short time later and Huapaya joined the Sanchecerrists. By Supreme Resolution No. 2 - CM of January 19 of 1946 the Barracks is declared a National Historic- Artistic Monument, in charge of its administration National Institute of Culture (INC). Years later this resolution was confirmed by Supreme Resolution No. 2900 given December 28 of 1972. The Barracks of Santa Catalina was declared intangible by the Metropolitan Deliberative Board of Historic, Artistic and Archaeological Sites of Lima through Report N¬∞ 6, corresponding to the years 1962 and 1963. Here, certain architectural elements such as the original perimeter walls are called intangibles, which can still be seen surrounding the areas of State College No. 1035 \\"General de Divisi√≥n EP Jos√© del Carmen Mar√≠n Arista\\", and a tower, which can be seen in the front of the barracks and on the corner of Jir√≥n Andahuaylas with Inambari. However, in 1963, the building is demolished in its intermediate part to facilitate the construction of the extension of the Nicol√°s de Pi√©rola Avenue. Subsequently, the southern sector was granted, as property, to the Ministry of War as well as the northwest sector owned by the Ministry of Education. Until the end-1970s the barracks served as headquarters of the Military police of the Peruvian Army (as historical testimony can still be seen, in one of the walls of the barracks, the Code of Honor of the Military police, a Coat of arms of Peru and an Emblem, of this Military Corps, composed of two pistols arranged in the form of the Cross of Burgundy). In 1976, in the Fortof Santa Catalina, when the military building was Barracks of the Battalion of Military police, was imprisoned, for having been sentenced by the Military Justice, the Artillery Captain (R) EP Vladimiro Montesinos former intelligence advisor of the former president Alberto Fujimori. Montesinos was accused of the crime of treason. One of its parts (the southern sector) was demolished during the second government of the Architect Fernando Bela√∫nde Terry (1980 - 1985) so that the Ordinary Penitentiary Establishment of Closed Regime for Primary Prisoners \\"San Jorge\\" was built during the efforts of the Ministers of Justice Dr. Felipe Osterling (1980-1981) and Dr. Enrique El√≠as Laroza (1981-1982). Part of the building, shortly thereafter, was also cut to build General de Divisi√≥n EP Jos√© del Carmen Mar√≠n Arista\\", which was created by Supreme Resolution N ¬∞ 134-83-ED of March 23 of 1983, Although the Chapel of B√°rbara was not touched,The Chapel of Santa B√°rbara is of neoclassical style and its imafronte shows four paired Ionic columns, the pediment is semicircular and has as pinnacles three grenades inflamed with votive fire and that symbolize the artillery weapon (in some armies the inflamed grenade is emblem of the Grenadiers, of some Corps of Troops of Assault Infantry and Dragons). The pediment shows as its main motif an artistic and integrated allegory of the three classic weapons of the Line Army (the infantry, the cavalry and the artillery) and also allegorical images to the arms of engineering, such as a compass and a feudal castle tower. Under the pediment and above the wooden door the imafronte of the chapel bears the inscription God and the Fatherland. Employer of explosions, this was affected as far as its environment is concerned because it is no longer in front of a courtyard of weapons but a few meters from the perimeter wall that surrounds what is left of the old colonial building.  Current situation  The building is currently owned by the National Institute of Culture and constitutes approximately only one fifth of the original building, including the frontis, survives, they are in a good condition, also is the chapel of Santa B√°rbara. Following works of archeology, the building was restored by the School of Restoration denominated Escuela Taller de Lima, which is subsidized by the Spanish Association of International Cooperation (AECI). This school is in charge of the integral restoration of the aforementioned monument.

Biography He was born in 1905 as the son of a butcher. Originally Pi√´t aspired to become a musician and learned to play violin and saxophone. He even performed in The Blue Ramblers, headed by Pi Scheffer. Near the end of the 1920s he applied for a job at publishing company De Spaarnestad, where he drew patterns for sewing. In 1932 he was asked to draw comics for the children's magazines issued by De Spaarnestad. At the time Martin Branner's Perry Winkle was very popular under its Dutch translation of Sjors and even inspired his own eponymous magazine. When the original American comic strip gradually started to put more focus on Perry's sister, Winnie Winkle, business deals were made with King Features syndicate to create a local version of Branner's character, Sjors, to let the popular series continue with its focus on Sjors. In 1938 Pi√´t became the creator of Sjors van de Rebellenclub (Sjors of the Rebel's Club), as the series was popularly titled. Gradually Sjors would become more its own thing, with storylines set in the Netherlands and a new cast of characters which replaced the original creations of Branner. After World War II the series was retitled Sjors en Sjimmie (Sjors and Sjimmie) when Sjors met his black friend Sjimmie, who'd become his sidekick. Pi√´t would draw Sjors and Sjimmie until he retired in 1969, after which Jan Kruis continued and modernized the series. In 1974 Pi√´t made a celebrity comic strip based on the popular children's TV series Tita Tovenaar. He died in 1997 at the age of 91, from an intracranial hemorrhage.

The mountain is part of the Okanagan Range in the Cascade Range. Cutthroat Peak is about two miles west of Washington Pass and one mile east of Rainy Pass. It's a prominent landmark along the North Cascades Highway. There is also a Cutthroat Lake, Cutthroat Creek, and Cutthroat Pass on its north and east aspects. Molar Tooth is a granite pillar half a mile north on the ridge extending to Cutthroat Pass. Climate Cutthroat Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, p. 15 Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

His pictures taken while mountain climbing garnered awards at more than twenty international exhibitions during the 1930s; in Budapest, Barcelona, Amsterdam, New York and Chicago among others. Huttig‚Äôs successful career was interrupted by the Second World War, in which he participated as a photographer at the front. After returning post-war to Chodov, which had been annexed by Nazi Germany as part of the Sudetenland, and from which all Germans were being expelled, he found his shop confiscated. He managed to secure work with an American military crew and left with them for Germany at the end of 1945. With him he took only two cameras and a few of his pre-war images and negatives, leaving everything else in his house in Tyr≈°ova Street. In Germany he worked as a photographer for the US Army magazine Stars and Stripes. In 1947 he settled at Hauptstra√üe 25, Starnberg on the Starnberger See (lake) in Upper Bavaria 25 km from Munich, at the foothills of the Alps, and there opened a photographic studio. Recognition In 1955 Huttig‚Äôs photograph of a priest officiating at a funeral in the snow, surrounded by mourners under umbrellas, was featured in MoMA‚Äôs world-touring The Family of Man exhibition, curated by Edward Steichen, which was seen by nine million visitors.James, S.

Sandwich Publications, Hanover, NH In 1959 he photographed Pvt Elvis Presley during his stint with the US Army's Armored Division in Germany. Elvis used a three-day pass to visit Munich and Huttig was contracted to make publicity shots of him with 18-year-old German actress Vera Tschechowa, which were important for keeping alive Elvis‚Äô reputation with his fans during his army service years. During his life, Huttig won awards at forty-eight international exhibitions around the world.International Federation of Photographic Art Camera.

The Shire River valley is a graben, part of the African Rift Valley system. The mountain's climate is cooler and wetter than the adjacent plateau and lowlands. Moist oceanic air masses moving in from the southeast rise up the mountain slopes and cool, and the moisture in the air condenses and falls as rain, or forms low clouds and morning mists. The windward south and east slopes receive more moisture than the north and west slopes, which are in the rain shadow of the mountain.

A Democrat, he had previously served on the Board of Wichita Public Schools from 2001 to 2017, and in the Kansas Senate representing the 25th district in west Wichita from 2017 to 2019. Early life and career Rogers was born on September 11, 1958 in Fremont, Nebraska. Raised by Republican parents, he grew up on a large hog farm in rural Nebraska. His grandfather was a county commissioner, and his father served on the school board.Rogers, Lynn, interviewed by Victor Hogstrom: \\"One on One with Victor Hogstrom: Lynn Rogers,\\" aired July 2, 2020, KPTS-TV, retrieved from KPTS.org website July 3, 2020. After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Business Administration, from University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln, in 1980, he began working as a Marketing Specialist for Citibank Savings. After working for Citibank in Chicago, he moved, with his wife, to Wichita, Kansas, in 1985, to accept a marketing position with the Federal Land Bank of Wichita (which, in 1987‚Äì88, became the Farm Credit Bank of WichitaSmith, Barbara S. and Patricia J. Rettig, \\"Guide to the Federal Land Bank of Wichita Collection,\\"2002/2013, Colorado State University Water Resources Archive, and the Colorado Water Institute, retrieved July 3, 2020). In 1993, Rogers became a vice president with CoBank Farm Credit Leasing, where he would remain until his election to the Kansas Senate in 2016. Political career School district politics In the 1990s, as a parent of a public school student, Rogers was active in a Wichita-area Parent-teacher organization (PTO), and aided fundraising for the Wichita Public Schools, including the district's bond drive in 2000. Rogers' first elected office was as a member of the Wichita School Board, where he served from 2001 to 2018. During his tenure on the school board, Rogers -- \\"never [a] die-hard ideologue\\" -- switched from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party, citing frustration with Republicans in attempts to get support for the public schools, and citing a less-rigid ideological \\"litmus test\\" for Democratic politicians to qualify for support from their party. Kansas Senate In 2016, he was elected to the Kansas Senate's traditionally Republican 25th district, replacing outgoing Republican Senator Michael O'Donnell, who vacated the seat to run for Sedgwick County Commissioner. In his time as a Senator, Rogers worked to \\"reverse the Brownback-Colyer tax experiment and invest more in our schools.\\" Rogers focused primarily on education, agricultural and banking issues.. In the Kansas Senate, senator Laura Kelly sat at the desk next to his, and became his mentor -- particularly in her areas of expertise (notably health and budget issues) -- while working with Rogers to overturn the Brownback tax \\"experiment.\\" Lieutenant Governor On May 24, 2018, Senator Kelly announced that she had selected Rogers as her running mate in the 2018 Kansas gubernatorial election. On November 6, 2018 -- despite Kansas, a deeply Republican state, having voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in the Presidential election of 2016 \\\\-- Kelly and Rogers defeated the Republican gubernatorial ticket of Kris Kobach and Wink Hartman, as well as the independent ticket of Greg Orman and John Doll. Rogers became the first Lieutenant Governor from Wichita -- the state's largest city -- since fellow Democrat Tom Docking served in the 1980s. As Kansas' Lieutenant Governor, Rogers' role has few constitutional duties. In addition to representing Kansas in official visits to other states, Rogers has spent much of his time, as Lieutenant Governor, traveling extensively throughout the state, engaging in political outreach, visiting over half of the states' 105 counties, with the goal of eventually visiting all of them.  Personal  Rogers is married to Kris Rogers. They have grown children, including a son who (along with the son's wife) serves as an attorney in the Oklahoma Supreme Court. They have a daughter who (along with the daughter's husband) teaches in the Kansas City area, and a son \\"involved in [Wichita's] arts community.\\"  References   External links  * Government website - - Category:1958 births Category:20th-century American businesspeople Category:21st-century American businesspeople Category:21st-century American politicians Category:American bankers Category:American marketing people Category:Businesspeople from Kansas Category:Kansas Democrats Category:Kansas state senators Category:Lieutenant Governors of Kansas Category:Living people Category:People from Fremont, Nebraska Category:Politicians from Wichita, Kansas Category:School board members in Kansas Category:University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln alumni ","title":"Lynn Rogers (politician)"},{"id":"57775021","text":"Britannica Malayalam Encyclopedia (also known as Malayalam Britannica and Malayalam Encyclopedia) is a reference work in the Malayalam language.

From 2008 to 2012, he held a high-ranking position in Serbia's Ministry for Kosovo and Metohija. Early life and career Steviƒá was born in Pri≈°tina, Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija, then part of the People's Republic of Serbia in the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia.

The Socialist Party and its Montenegrin allies won the election, and Steviƒá served on the government side in the sitting of the assembly that followed.

Steviƒá continued to serve as a municipal official in Pri≈°tina in the immediate aftermath the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, although he acknowledged that the local government was an \\"empty shell\\" in the absence of a functioning police force.

Steviƒá did not receive an assembly mandate but was instead appointed as deputy minister and president of the co-ordination centre at the Ministry for Kosovo and Metohija in July 2008. In December of the same year, he ceased to be deputy minister and was reassigned as a state secretary in the ministry.ZVONIMIR STEVIƒÜ, Otvoreni Parlament, accessed 26 June 2018. Shortly after his initial appointment, he presided over a commemoration ceremony for the victims of the 1999 Staro Gracko massacre; he was quoted as saying that the murders were \\"one of the most cruel crimes in a series of crimes committed against Serbs in Kosovo since the deployment of the UN mission and [Kosovo Force].\\"\\"Anniversary of killing of Kosovo Serb farmers marked,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 24 July 2008 (Source: Radio B92 text website, Belgrade, in English 1813 gmt 23 Jul 08).

Sereno, Maria Lourdes Sereno, above, was ousted from her position. She is no longer considered the 24th Chief Justice of the Philippines, as the Court ruled that her appointment was never legal. The quo warranto petition against Maria Lourdes Sereno, filed before the Supreme Court of the Philippines, led to the landmark case of Republic v. SerenoSometimes also titled Republic of the Philippines v. Maria Lourdes Sereno. (G. R. No. 237428), which removed Maria Lourdes Sereno from her post as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines, finding that she never lawfully held the office due to a lack of integrity for failing to file certain required financial documents. The Court handed down its ruling on May 11, 2018. The case began with a filing before the House of Representatives of an impeachment demand, the accusations in which Solicitor General Jose Calida used as the factual basis for his quo warranto petition. Sereno had faced criticism from the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte for expressing her criticism of his Philippine Drug War, and many saw the petition as politically motivated. As mentioned, Sereno had also faced an impeachment trial prior to the granting of the petition, but after its granting, such trial became moot and was never scheduled. Among Philippine lawyers, the decision was widely seen as unconstitutional. The decision was received favorably by the Duterte administration as well as its political allies, while critics of the petition viewed Sereno's removal from office as an attack on due process and on the judicial independence of the Supreme Court. Quo warranto, originally meant for challenging electoral fraud, has gone on to increased prominence in the Philippines, and was also used against ABS-CBN and ABS-CBN Convergence.  Background  Concurrent impeachment process During Maria Lourdes Sereno's de facto tenure as Chief Justice during the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, Sereno faced possible impeachment. An impeachment process against Sereno began on August 30, 2017 when 25 lawmakers ensored a petition against her filed by Larry Gadon, former lawyer to President Macapagal-Arroyo. On August 30, 2017, at least 25 members of the House of Representatives supported the impeachment of the Chief Justice. The main argument for her impeachment was that Sereno allegedly failed to declare her statement of assets, liabilities and net worth (SALN) in full during her 17-year teaching period at the University of the Philippines College of Law (UPCL). She was also accused of tax misdeclarations and unauthorized expenses. The University of the Philippines (UP) and the Office of the Ombudsman could only produce Sereno's SALNs from the years 1998, 2002, and 2006. On March 8, the House of Representatives Committee on Justice found probable cause to impeach Sereno due to \\"allegations that Sereno committed culpable violation of the Constitution, betrayal of public trust, corruption, and other high crimes\\" by a vote of 38‚Äì2, after which it was to go to a plenary vote. On April 11, then-Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez announced that the earliest the impeachment would be was May 14, due both to procedure and the Lent break. He noted, though, that a verdict adverse to Sereno on the quo warranto petition would render the impeachment proceedings moot. Quo warranto petitions A quo warranto petition was, before President Duterte, a very seldom used Philippine extraordinary writ. Its name derives from the Latin question quo warranto, meaning something like, \\"by what authority?\\"Sometimes rendered as \\"by whose authority?\\", although quo literally means \\"where\\" or \\"why\\". In its early days, during American colonialization, quo warranto was mostly used to challenge a democratic election, that is, to make the claim that the person who is holding an office is a usurper, and that someone else deserves the office, e.g., due to electoral fraud or ineligibility. Indeed, this is the only way the term is used in law professor Ernesto C. Salao'sAs of January 2018, associate dean of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines College of Law. widely cited 858-page book The 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines (2001 ). In the Philippines, though, the process has evolved, in a way that many, including former Solicitor General Florin Hilbay, find unconstitutional. It has come to be understood that it can be used in extraordinary cases to unseat judicial appointees, and impeachable officials, not only to challenge elections. Some, such as Jesuit priest Ranhilio Aquino,As of 2011, dean of the San Beda University College of Law. See argue this due to the fact that the President and Vice President were explicitly enumerated as vulnerable to quo warranto by the Supreme Court sitting as the Presidential Election Tribunal, and, unlike many other constitutions, Article 11 of the 1987 Constitution does not exclusively grant the power of impeachment to Congress. Quo warranto petitions, when successful, do not \\"remove\\" someone from office‚Äîthey declare the very appointment itself null and void ab initio, meaning that the office was never legally held as it has been declared to have been assumed under false pretenses.  Timeline   Filing  After an impeachment process against Sereno began, a quo warranto petition seeking to void Sereno's appointment as Chief Justice was filed on March 5, 2018 by Solicitor General Jose Calida with the reason of her alleged lack of integrity. The traditional one year limitation on quo warranto actions, part of the Rules of Court, was immediately raised by Sereno and those in the media. Calida simply invoked the legal principle of nullum tempus occurrit regi‚Äîtime runs against no king.The Philippines has not had a monarch since Spanish rule, but as in England, this ancient legal principle is understood there to refer to actions taken by the government in the name of the Republic for the public good. Calida justified the filing by saying that her \\"peers\\"In the Philippines, the chief justice is primus inter pares, officially equal to the other justices. know both her, and the Constitution, best, so are better placed to decide than Congress would be. Calida, who also said that former Chief Justice Renato Corona was \\"unjustly\\" impeached, told Sereno that he was being \\"kind\\" to her by saving her from the \\"indignity\\" of an impeachment trial. Sereno challenged the petition, insisting that the only legal way to remove her from her post was via impeachment. One hundred forty Filipino law professors, including the deans of major schools like the and the Lyceum of the Philippines University College of Law, called for the impeachment trial to be the deciding factor and not the quo warranto petition. (Free version.) The petition claims that despite having been employed at the University of the Philippines College of Law (UPCL) from November 1986 to June 1, 2006, Sereno's records at the Human Resource Development Office only includes the years 1985, 1990, 1991, 1993‚Äì1997, and 2002, while her records at the Office of the Ombudsman only include those from the years 1999‚Äì2009. Sereno takes leave Following the impeachment process filed against her, Sereno took an indefinite leave on March 1, 2018, but said she would not resign. Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio served as Acting Chief Justice, a post which he also previously served in during the transition between Corona's impeachment and the appointment of Sereno. She ended her leave on May 9, 2018. Sereno's spokesperson and lawyer Jojo Lacanilao denied in an ANC interview that Sereno was forced to go on leave. Oriental Mindoro Representative Rey Umali, however, urged Sereno to resign. Duterte, annoyed at the portrayal of the petition and questions about his possible involvement in it, declared himself Sereno's \\"enemy\\" on April 9. Duterte also criticized the slow speed of the impeachment process in Congress, citing it as the reason for his administration's quo warranto petition.Duterte: Now this time, I'm asking the congressmen and the Speaker: Do it now. Wag ninyong dramahin. [Cut it out with the drama.] Or else, I will do it for you. Ngayon makialam talaga ako. [Now I'm getting involved.] I am asking Congress, what's taking you too long? [...] I will not hesitate to do what is to the best interest of my country. If it calls for your [Sereno's] forced removal, I will do it. To those who criticized his involvement in Sereno's case, he said, \\"fuck you.\\"Duterte: Me? I‚Äôll go to jail with her [Sereno]. Samahan ko sila, diyan ako sa gitna, de Lima dito pati siya. Kung wala na talagang iba e di‚Ä¶ [I'll go with them, me in the middle with de Lima and her. If that's the only way, well...] Putang ina eh sinabi nang 'di ako nakikialam eh. [Fuck you if you say I shouldn't interfere.] Sabihin mo sa kanya [Tell her], let the world know. Talagang [Really,] I will, makialam ako. [I will interfere.] Ako nagpapasensya lang ako, babae. [My patience with you has run out, woman.]  Oral argument  Oral argument took place in the case on April 10, 2018. As it was held in April, it took place in Baguio, as the Court traditionally meets there every April. The trial went on for almost six hours, and did not end until past 7 pm. Jose Calida personally represented the Office of the Solicitor General, while in a highly unusual move, Sereno represented herself, appearing pro se. Ruling Deciding on the quo warranto petition en banc, the Supreme Court justices voted to oust Sereno from the court on May 11, 2018, by a vote of 8‚Äì6, making Sereno the first constitutional officer in the Philippines to be removed from office without an impeachment trial. =Majority opinion= The majority opinion was written by Justice Noel Tijam. The Court invoked the doctrine of the \\"transcendental\\" importance of judicial review, ruling that the quo warranto petition was a valid exercise of the Court's power, there was an actual controversy, and the Republic had standing. The Court ruled that quo warranto cases and impeachment proceedings can proceed independently and simultaneously due to the fact that they are based on different causes of action; quo warranto questions the eligibility and valid exercise of a position; whereas, impeachment is removal for committing crimes specified by the Constitution. Furthermore, it ruled that if it wished, Congress may have continued to impeachment without prejudice from the Court on the principle of the separation of powers. Tijam wrote that \\"to [require Congress to] momentarily abandon their legislative duties to focus on impeachment proceedings [against] a public official, who at the outset, may clearly be unqualified [would be a] waste of time.\\" The Court ruled that impeachment is not the exclusive legal remedy by which the legitimacy of exercise of power may be challenged. The Court ruled that so severe was Sereno's failure to declare her assets that she has no integrity. As integrity is an enumerated requirement of Article VIII of the Constitution, she was therefore, by the Court's logic, never eligible once it was destroyed at the time of her not filing her . =Dissenting opinions= Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio voted against the removal of Sereno from office through the quo warranto petition, but nevertheless wrote in his dissenting opinion that her \\"repeated non-filing of s\\" constitutes \\"a culpable violation of the Constitution and betrayal of public trust, which are grounds for impeachment under the Constitution\\". Associate Justice Marvic Leonen, in his dissenting opinion, called the petition \\"a legal abomination\\" that should have been dismissed. He expressed disfavor in removing an impeachable official through a quo warranto petition, writing: \\"We render this Court subservient to an aggressive Solicitor General. We render those who present dissenting opinions unnecessarily vulnerable to powerful interests.\\" In his dissent, Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin Caguioa, wrote that the majority had allowed the executive to take a \\"[less traveled] prohibited road\\". In Caguioa's view, the inability of the Court to resolve matters within its own walls is a disservice to the institution and its individual members. He colorfully opined that the Court had committed a suicide as gruesome as any seppuku, but with none of the honor typically associated with it in Japanese culture.  Motion for reconsideration  Sereno was given the right to file a motion for reconsideration against the Supreme Court's decision to remove her as Chief Justice, which she did, on May 31, 2018. The Supreme Court denied \\"with finality\\" Sereno's motion for reconsideration for \\"lack of merit\\" on June 19, 2018 in an 8‚Äì6 decision, with no justices changing their vote.  Administrative case  In its original ruling, the Court demanded Sereno submit a brief defending herself against alleged violations of the ethical code Philippine attorneys agree to, which is set by the Supreme Court. On July 17, 2018, the Court ruled that she had breached the sub judice ruleFor the text of the rule, see: when she spoke to the media and gave speeches about cases which were not yet decided, including her own case, while still sitting as Chief Justice, which it reprimanded her for, in lieu of disbarment or suspension from the Integrated Bar of the Philippines.  Reactions  In the Philippines  The petitioner, Solicitor General Jose Calida, stated: \\"The Supreme Court decision ousting Maria Lourdes Sereno augurs well for the country, as it preserves the stability and integrity of the Judiciary. This decision is the epitome of its exercise of judicial independence.\\" Senator Antonio Trillanes said that the Supreme Court majority had committed a \\"heinous crime against our justice system\\" which had \\"killed the Constitution\\". Senators Sonny Angara, Bam Aquino, and Francis Pangilinan joined him in condemning the ruling.  Abroad  The New York-based Human Rights Watch called the decision \\"unprecedented and nefarious,\\" adding that \\"Sereno‚Äôs ouster also kicks open the door for wanton removals of members of other constitutional bodies, such as the Commission on Human Rights. [...] Ultimately, the rejection of constitutional checks and balances concentrates power in the hands of Duterte and his allies, posing the greatest danger to democracy in the Philippines since the Marcos dictatorship.\\"  Aftermath  Effect on the Court With the removal of Maria Lourdes Sereno from her post as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines, she altogether leaves the Court. When she was appointed Chief Justice, she vacated her position as Associate Justice, and therefore, cannot assume her former position again. Sereno, who was during her tenure called the 24th Chief Justice, is now referred to as a former Chief Justice de facto, but not de jure. This is because a quo warranto petition cannot remove someone from office: if a quo warranto petition succeeds, the target's very appointment is declared null and void ab initio, meaning, legally, she was never Chief Justice at all, as her appointment has been declared illegitimate. Opposition lawmakers of the Congress filed an impeachment complaint on August 23, 2018 against 7 Associate Justices who voted for the quo warranto petition for removing the Chief Justice based on the grounds of culpable violation of the Constitution and betrayal of public trust.Lawmakers to file impeachment complaints against 7 SC justices Justice Antonio Carpio, the most senior Associate Justice at the time, assumed the post of Chief Justice in an acting capacity starting May 14, 2018, following Sereno's removal from office. On August 25, Teresita de Castro, who only had two months left to serve in office, was appointed by president Rodrigo Duterte as the new Chief Justice after being included on a list of candidates by the Judicial and Bar Council a day prior. Her role as one of the five sitting justices who sought to nullify the appointment of Sereno as Chief Justice was also seen as a reason for the appointment. The appointment was criticized as, due to her age, she was obligated to retire on October 10, 2018‚Äîas she did, after only 44 days as the 24th Chief Justice. Justice Lucas Bersamin took her place on November 28.  Effect on the law  As a landmark case, Republic v. Sereno established a new avenue for decisive, rapid action by the Supreme Court before lower courts had weighed in, expanding the Supreme Court's mandate and making it in more cases simultaneously a court of first instance and a court of last resort. When ABS- CBN's franchise expired, rather than allowing the National Telecommunications Commission to grant them a temporary franchise, Calida once again filed a quo warranto petition, asking the Court, in effect, \\"by what authority does ABS- CBN operate?\\" As a result of Republic v. Sereno, therefore, the ancient legal concept of quo warranto has taken on novel meaning in Philippine courts.

He finished Year 12 at Divine Word University, Madang, and graduated with a diploma in business and a degree in accounting, also from Divine Word University, in 1999. Career Kramer started his career in private enterprise, based in his hometown of Madang. After a range of entrepreneurial activity, including founder and manager of the Club 69 nightclubs in Madang and Lae (where Lands Minister John Rosso and Health Minister Jelta Wong were regulars), Organising Committee Member of the Miss PNG franchise of the Miss Pacific Islands beauty pageant (with Dadi Toka Jr) and roles in his uncle's civil engineering and construction company Kramer Ausenco, he contested the seat of Madang Open in the 2007 Papua New Guinea election, at the age of 31. Kramer polled seventh, with 2,644 votes, but continued to run and won the seat in the 2017 Papua New Guinea elections as a member of Pangu Party (Pangu Pati), then led by Sam Basil, with a majority of 21,248 votes. Prime Minister Peter O'Neill formed government, with members of Pangu Pati and some other political parties forming opposition. In September 2017 Basil and some other Pangu Pati members moved to join the O'Neill Government, causing a split as Kramer and four other Pangu Pati members (including former Prime Minister Sir Mekere Morauta) chose to remain in opposition. Kramer formally announced his resignation from Pangu Pati in March 2018, signalling that he intended to launch a new party called the Allegiance Party. Kramer held the position of Shadow Minister for Public Enterprises and State Investments and Public Service in the opposition led by Patrick Pruaitch. Kramer was appointed Minister for Police in the Marape-Steven Government on 17 June 2019. In May 2018 Kramer formally registered the Allegiance Party. Kramer is the only Member of Parliament for the Allegiance Party.  Anti-Corruption Tsar  Kramer is best known for leading a movement in Papua New Guinea against the country's endemic corruption. Tagged PNG's \\"Anti-Corruption Tsar\\" by international media, he was elected on a platform of transparency and good governance. Entering Parliament in opposition, he was quick to put transparency and governance on the national agenda. In June 2018 Kramer launched an offensive against Papua New Guinea's daily newspapers, The National and Post-Courier, calling for a boycott to protest corruption and their support for the O'Neill Government. It prompted a rebuke from the Media Council of Papua New Guinea. In October 2018, Kramer was part of an opposition-led national strike over the purchase of a fleet of Maserati and Bentley cars by the PNG Government for use as PNG hosted the final events of APEC Papua New Guinea 2018. The incident, which became known as Maseratigate, received international attention and ongoing coverage, particularly after it was revealed a number of vehicles procured for APEC had subsequently gone missing. Despite continued international pressure, and a commitment by the Marape-Steven government to release a report into APEC spending after accusations of fraud were made, no public accounting of the cars or APEC finances has been released. In February 2019, Kramer released an analysis of costs related to the destruction of PNG Parliament Haus property by security personnel shortly after APEC activities ended. Immediate estimates of the costs were up to PGK15 million. Kramer's analysis of costs once details were released suggested inflated contracts were being given to businesses with Government connections. As the COVID-19 crisis struck the world in early 2020, Kramer led the PNG Government's communications efforts, articulating government policies and guiding public acceptance of measures in a country less affected by the pandemic. When rumours surfaced that money had been misappropriated, Kramer was quick to criticise media coverage. However, when he announced a self-led audit of COVID accounts, he attracted strong criticism. In early June, he announced via his Facebook page that he was unable to complete the task. After an independent audit firm was asked to provide services pro-bono, Kramer released a preliminary update on the use of funds, saying a full report would be released at a later date. While the report was completed, its release was delayed pending approval by Prime Minister Marape.  Kramer vs O'Neill  From the time he was elected, Kramer mounted a sustained campaign to undermine the leadership of then Prime Minister Peter O'Neill citing corruption and insider dealing. This and increasing dissatisfaction with O'Neill's dealings from within his own party saw opponents coalesce around allegations of corruption in a leaked Ombudsman's report investigating the purchase of Oil Search shares by the State in 2014. The leak prompted a split in O'Neill's People's National Congress Party, led by former Finance Minister James Marape. Kramer worked closely with the opposition (predominantly National Alliance members), Marape and Pangu Pati to trigger O'Neill's resignation on 26 May 2019. On 27 May 2019, a vote of Parliament saw Marape elected 8th Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea. Kramer was subsequently appointed Minister for Police. Kramer quickly called for renewed investigations into O'Neill government activities, including the purchase of Maseratis for APEC and the controversial state purchase of Oil Search shares. These investigations involve colleagues including Minister for Urbanisation Justin Tkatchenko, who was responsible for the Maserati procurement as Minister for APEC, and Prime Minister Marape, who was implicated in the Ombudsman's Report into the purchase of Oil Search shares as Minister for Finance when the procurement took place. In July 2019, after commitments by the Marape-Steven government to open a Commission of Inquiry into the findings of the Ombudsman Commission report into the UBS Loan, the Australian Financial Review provided further information about concerning transactions. However, the Commission of Inquiry progressed slowly and costs increased dramatically when foreign lawyers became involved; as a consequence, the Committee failed to progress matters in 2019. In October 2019 police issued a warrant for the arrest of O'Neill citing \\"official corruption.\\" However, O'Neill refused to cooperate, claiming the charges were \\"false and fabricated in a clumsy way\\" by Kramer, whom he also accused of politicising the police force and \\"blatant interference in police operations.\\" After a period in Australia, and after calling for Kramer's removal, O'Neill returned to Papua New Guinea but did not appear for the final sitting of Parliament. Despite this and other calls for Marape to remove Kramer from office, he successfully held his position in the last Ministerial reshuffle for 2019. After an extended period in Australia, O'Neill returned to Papua New Guinea on 24 May 2020 and was immediately arrested by police in relation to the purchase of two generators from Israeli interests. He was released on bail and allowed to complete the mandatory 14 day quarantine period at home. He subsequently returned to PNG Parliament during its June sitting and challenged the Marape-Steven Government over a range of issues from debt escalation to the management of the COVID-19 crisis. However, this renewed vigour did not stop Members of Parliament from continuing to leave his People's National Congress party.  Minister for Police  Prior to his appointment as Police Minister, Kramer claimed that members of the police force were actively planning an arrest and/or assassination attempt against him. He was quoted as saying \\"I have no question of doubt I will eventually get killed for what I do. It goes without saying when you get in the way of those stealing billions in public funds, they will do whatever it takes to get rid of you.\\" As Minister for Police, Kramer has pursued reform of the police force, which has been troubled by allegations of corruption and abuse. He removed long-term acting Police Commissioner Gari Baki in July 2019, saying he was past compulsory retirement age and needed to be stood down. Despite Baki's attempts at reinstatement, the dismissal was successful. He appointed David Manning as acting Commissioner; Manning was confirmed in the position by a decision of the National Executive Council in December 2019. It was much speculated that Manning received the position because he was \\"tambu\\" (an in-law, or relative by marriage) of Kramer; however, Kramer has clarified that this allegation is false. Concerned about ongoing mismanagement of police finances, in June 2020 Kramer called the Fraud Squad to task about high rental costs. After investigation, Kramer determined that a company owned by a foreign national was charging high and escalating rents on a building leased by the Fraud Squad. He asked Commissioner for Taxation Sam Koim to investigate the company involved. In August 2020 the Royal PNG Constabulary and Australian Federal Police jointly undertook one of the largest drug busts in both country's histories, with over 500 kg of cocaine seized from a Cessna light aircraft that crashed shortly after takeoff on a secluded runway in Papa Lealea, Central Province. Five Australians were immediately arrested; the pilot was initially detained on illegal entry charges pending further drug-related charges. Kramer acknowledged the role played by PNG police in the operation, saying the multi-agency operation had been going on for two years. In September 2020 Kramer launched a broadside on Facebook against his own police department, which was subsequently reported in the international media. In the post, Kramer accused the Royal PNG Constabulary of widespread corruption, claiming that \\"Senior officers based in Police Headquarters in Port Moresby were stealing from their own retired officers‚Äô pension funds. They were implicated in organised crime, drug syndicates, smuggling firearms, stealing fuel, insurance scams, and even misusing police allowances. They misused tens of millions of kina allocated for police housing, resources, and welfare. We also uncovered many cases of senior officers facilitating the theft of Police land.\\" He also said that corruption in PNG was \\"so deep-rooted and so entrenched in every aspect of politics and business that it is almost beyond comprehension, and appears never-ending.\\" The statements triggered responses from former Police Commissioner Gary Baki and former Assistant Commissioner Sylvester Kalaut. Baki challenged police to arrest him; Kalaut threatened to sue Kramer over his allegations concerning the theft of pension funds, charges for which Kalaut and another former RPNGC employee, Bob Kerry, were before the court. On October 9, Marape and Kramer launched the first police Station of Excellence in Waigani, Port Moresby. The program, a collaboration with the Australian Government, upgrades key police stations installing modern equipment such as biometric staff movement logging, dashcams and GPS monitoring systems. Kramer used the opening to reinforce performance expectations, saying \\"the days of misusing [police] vehicles are gone\\" and \\"you cannot hide what you are doing, it will be recorded and accessed by CCTV operators and the police station commander.\\" Member for Madang As Member for Madang, Kramer has led efforts to restore law and order to Madang which has seen increased violence, including sorcery related killings and beheadings, since 2013. In early 2020 Kramer directed an increased police presence into Madang to address this and introduce improved community policing. A particularly violent spate of attacks have taken place in Transgogol LLG. In late 2020 Kramer negotiated a surrender and reconciliation ceremony after a week of awareness training during which 200 men in Transgogol surrendered firearms, drugs and stills for making homebrew. Kramer has been followed by rumours that he holds an Australian citizenship, and is therefore ineligible to stand for Parliament under Papua New Guinea law. Kramer has repeatedly refuted these claims, including by posting on Facebook a letter from Australia's Department of Home Affairs confirming that he was not, nor had he ever been, an Australian citizen. Despite this, Governor of Madang Peter Yama filed a court application in October 2020, again contesting Kramer's citizenship and asking that the court make a ruling on the validity of his election in 2017. Kramer subsequently released his birth certificate to the media, saying that this should put his citizenship beyond doubt. Facebook Page Kramer publishes a Facebook page called \\"The Kramer Report\\". The investigations into corruption published there have been instrumental in both Kramer's election in 2017 and in a number of subsequent court cases.

History The ferry was built in 1981 by Lindst√∏lds Skips and Baatbyggeri A/S in Ris√∏r, for A/S Moltzau Tankrederi from Oslo. She was deployed by the shipping company Sundsbusserne A/S between Helsingborg and Helsing√∂r under the name M/S Sundbuss Pernille on 19 June 1981. It was under the Norwegian flag until 2001 when it switched to the Swedish flag with the home port of Helsingborg.Rederiet hoppas p√• vinnande koncept . In 2003, Sundbuss Pernille collided in close fog with the Mercandia IV ferry from HH-Ferries shipping company when it was entering Helsing√∂r's port. Pernille suffered minor damage to her command bridge while three people were injured. In December 2006, the ferries were taken over by Eitzen Holding while the shipping company was rebranded as Ace Link. The new shipping company mad a significant effort to bolster the route, purchasing two new and larger vessels named M/S Siluna Ace and M/S Simara Ace, which were originally intended to replace the M/S Sundbuss Pernille. However, it was decided by Ace Link to keep the M/S Sundbuss Pernille in service as a spare ferry and rename it the M/S Siletta Ace, reflecting the naming scheme of the two newer vessels.

Due to lower than expected demand along the route, ACE Link eventually decided to run the smaller Siletta Ace in an effort to cut operating costs. This effort proved fruitless, and on 4 January 2010, Ace Link declared bankruptcy, due primarily to the significant debt the company accumulated following the purchase of the two larger vessels.

It is one of a group of historic sites labelled the Ben Hall Sites for their association with bushranger Ben Hall, along with Ben Hall's Death Site, the Bushranger Hotel, Cliefden, the Grave of Ben Hall and Wandi. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 8 October 2010.  History  left The robbery of the gold escort at Escort Rock was one of the better known robberies by Frank Gardiner's gang, which included Ben Hall at this time. The Eugowra Gold Escort carried gold and money from the goldfields to Sydney every week. On 15 June 1862 the covered mail coach drawn by four horses was carrying 14,000 pounds worth of gold and money. Guarding this shipment were four police and a driver. Gardiner's gang stopped two drays and ordered the drivers to position the drays across the road to block the passage of the Gold Escort. The coach arrived in the late afternoon at the blockade and Gardiner ordered his gang to open fire. The guard fled leaving the coach to the bushrangers. Gardiner, Hall and the other members of the gang Dan Charters, John Gilbert, Henry Manns, John O'Meally, John Bow and Alex Fordyce retired to a camp on Mount Wheogo. The gang broke up but were later tracked down by police who recovered the gold. Ben Hall and Dan Charters were arrested while mustering on Hall's property on 27 July 1862. Hall was freed on 23 August 1862 with a bail of 500 pounds and two sureties of 250 pounds each.  Description  Escort Rock with the old coach road in the foreground Escort Rock is located approximately four kilometres north east of Eugowra on the Escort Way. The site is located 200 metres to the east of the Escort Way on the site of the old road. A large boulder has been marked \\"Escort Rock\\" and is set to the side of what was once the coach road from Eugowra to Orange. The original coach road wound around the base of the boulder strewn hillside and then after a sharp bend curved back towards the existing road. The evidence of the original road is the only physical evidence to show where the robbery took place. As at 3 July 2009, it was in good condition, and the original coach road was visible. The integrity of the rock, coach road, and surrounding area is high, mainly due to the new road being built 200m away from the original road. There is a picnic area next to the highway that has been constructed for tourists to stop and see the site. There is also a plaque which commemorates a re-enactment which took place on the centenary of the hold up by the Gardiner gang.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Escort Rock contributes to the State significance of the Ben Hall Sites as the site of the first crime Hall can be positively linked to. The activities of Hall and his gang had significant impact on the movement of people, money and gold through regional New South Wales between 1862 and 1865. The Escort Rock robbery was the first of many road side hold-ups and it was the increasing frequency of such hold-ups which lead to the widespread expansion of police forces into rural areas and increased security for mail coaches and gold escorts. Escort Rock is associated with the bushranger Frank Gardiner, who lead the robbery on 15 June 1862. Halls association with Gardiner played an important role in Hall becoming a notorious bushranger. Escort Rock contributes to the State significance of the Ben Hall Sites as a site recognised by the public to be associated with Ben Hall. Hall is one of the best known bushrangers who operated in New South Wales and forms a significant element to the construction of Australian identity. The Escort Rock site is well marked and is a popular tourist destination. Escort Rock is of State significance as being representative of the type of places used by bushrangers to hold up coaches and travellers. Escort Rock is an example of the type of place Ben Hall and his gang used for road side hold ups and which helped define these criminal activities as \\"bushranging\\" due to the men appearing out of the bush on horse back and then escaping into the bush with the proceeds of the robbery. Escort Rock is an identifiable location of a highway robbery. The majority of roadside robberies took place at locations without relocatable landmarks. Aesthetically Escort Rock is of local significance as an impressive landmark on the Old Coach Road from Eugowra to Orange. This road is no longer used for traffic, a new road being built 200m away.

It was designed by Allan Tom and built in 1936 by Jim Fullerton. It is also known as Amusu Cinema. The property is owned by Cabonne Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 26 November 1999.  History  Movies were first screened at Manildra around 1910. In 1914 they were shown in Fleeting's Hall, Derowie Street. Starting during the silent era, Allan Tom quickly adapted equipment for the \\"talkies\\". Known as a travelling picture show pioneer, Tom toured the central Western and goldfields areas of New South Wales from the early 1920s into the 1940s - to areas as far afield as Cobar, Bourke and Hillston. During the Great Depression he showed movies in a tent, providing desperately needed support and entertainment in remote areas. He moved into Reid's Hall in 1923, then onto the Memorial Hall in Kiewa Street after its construction in 1925. He built the Amusu in 1936 in Derowie Street with seating for 300 on one level. The name Amusu was derived from contact with an equipment supplier in early 1930s. Allan Tom collaborated with a local school teacher to draw up the plans. Tom's passion for sound meant he had to ensure the theatre would have good acoustics. For this reason he lined the theatre with Donaconna board, a material imported from USA. Tom employed a local Manildra resident to build the cinema Jim Fullerton. For two decades he also operated theatres in Millthorpe and Tullamore. Allan Tom battled through drought, flood, depression, advent of clubs, television and video, finally reducing his screenings to Saturday nights only. Not withstanding his advancing years, he continued to operate the Amusu until his death in 1995, aged 93. The Tom family continues operating the theatre, despite a temporary closure to undertake safety repairs. In addition, the Tom family has strong historic links to early squatter days and the first discovery of gold. Nationalism is commemorated in incorporation of \\"Australia\\" within the names of various members of the Tom family, including being Allan's middle name, and having links to the Australia Theatre in Orange. The theatre and adjacent garage were acquired by the Cabonne Shire Council in 2003. The theatre is now operated by a committee and conducts new release screenings every third Saturday night of the month and special screenings by arrangement.

Description  The Amusu Theatre has an Art Deco-style facade featuring a distinctive stepped parapet typical of that found within many small country towns. Within the two story high fibro facade is featured a small central sash window. Within the upper sash is the word \\"Amusu\\" in decorative lead light coloured glass. Behind the facade is an industrial hall constructed from corrugated iron for the walls and gable end roof. The upper portion of the building, facing the street, houses the first floor projection room, inclusive of its historic working equipment. The interior of the hall contains original fixtures and fittings, s - ticket office, geometric light shades, flip-up sprung leather seats (including twin \\"love\\" seats), embossed tin lined projection room, two Westrex projectors, plaster mouldings, on the stage linked \\"A\\" and \\"T\\" symbols of the theatre, and around the walls various exhibits, such as movie posters from 1930s to 1990s, old 33 inch sound records, original projectors and paraphernalia from the times of Allan Tom's \\"travelling picture show\\". The theatre evokes a unique atmosphere with its sloping timber floor, seating and s features. This atmosphere is enhanced by screenings of archival footage of cartoons and newsreels, s, in addition to commercial current releases on Saturday nights. The theatre has never received remodelling in the conventional sense, but was routinely upgraded over the years within its original style - that of an unadorned, rather plain country hall-type cinema with some art deco elements.Thorne et al 1997 Although Allan Tom was always keen on new innovation - cinemascope screen, better sound equipment, etc., the retired models were kept for display within the theatre. The structure of the theatre was reported as generally sound as at 27 August 2010, although leaks in the roofing iron had caused ceiling damage and the seating needed re-upholstery. Some rewiring and service upgrading had been undertaken for a fire safety audit in 1990. The equipment continues to be in working order. The building and its interior has remained largely uncharged since its construction.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries The Amusu Theatre is an important example of a small half-hall purpose-built cinema in a rural town with a very small population, which has been continuously operated under the one ownership since its construction in 1936.Thorne, Tod & Cork 1997 [The ownership has changed to the council since the building was heritage- listed.] The cinema is a tangible link with the earliest days of the movie industry and its impact upon communities, especially those in rural Australia, throughout the 20th century. The building contains a collection of movie memorabilia, fixtures and fitting which evokes an understanding of its social and cultural significance. The building and its contents, as a total package, is a rare educative and evocative resource Amusu Theatre was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 26 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Amusu is a living icon of the importance in the course and pattern of NSW's cultural history that was played, and continues to play by, film and cinemas. The Amusu has direct association with the life and work of Allan Tom, the travelling picture show man, whose contribution throughout the bulk of the 20th Century to NSW cultural life was recognised by the award of the OAM. Few other cinemas in NSW have operated continuously since construction, in this case 1936. Member of pioneer family with direct links to squatting, sheep runs and first discovery of gold at Ophir; association with the evolution of the movie and cinema industry in Australia from the silent era to 1990s; known as \\"The travelling picture show man\\". Possibly no other continuously operating picture theatre has such historical - albeit historic connotations with its association with a person of Alan Tom's background as a travelling picture show man [from 1923], and being recognised with an AM for his contribution to entertainment in Australia. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The theatre's small but slightly pretentious facade is an important and recognised part of the streetscape of its small community. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Amusu has strong and special association with central and western NSW for the role it and Tom played in rural communities' social and cultural life The Amusu has provided social and cinematic entertainment continuously to its community for over sixty years. When on the road, the Amusu Touring Talkies often provided the only entertainment other than the occasional bush dance. Very few, perhaps no other cinema in NSW has operated continuously by the same family since construction - in this case a period of 63 years. Few, if any cinemas in NSW, possess the memorabilia, records of purchases and film bookings for such a long period as the Amusu does. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Amusu has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of NSW's cultural history and the role of cinemas. . The Amusu's importance lies in its ability to demonstrate a high degree of creative or technical achievement in adaptation of then new technologies to harsher conditions within rural NSW. Few cinemas in NSW apart from the Amusu, have arc-lamp projectors dating from the 1930s and 1940s in operational condition (although a number have had them dormant for many years in closed projection boxes).Thorne, 1999 The building and its contents demonstrates how cinematography developed throughout the 20th century. The still operating equipment is a valuable resource, and retains the ability to play various mediums where such machinery is becoming increasingly harder to procure; collection of cinema objects, once common place, are becoming scarce. Wrapped up in the Amusu is a host of memories and events that made it the social hub of such country towns of the day. The place is very evocative and by just being within the building, people can easily image and experience what it was like to go to the movies in the 1930s. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Amusu possesses uncommon, rare and endangered aspects of NSW cultural history being a rare surviving purpose built, corrugated iron building with continuous use since being built and by the same family. Although once common place throughout Urban and Regional NSW, early 20th century theatre structures are becoming rare, whether grand 1000 seat or 300 seat capacities. This is especially so when coupled with one still being used for its original purpose. The continuous operation of the Amusu as a cinema, run by the same family, inclusive of its original fixtures and fittings, is rare. The combination of its building materials, its continuous use and by the same historic family with all the moveable heritage items largely intact, as a total package the Amusu is unique [Thorn 1999]. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Amusu's importance is contained within its ability to demonstrate the principal characteristics of cinemas as a class of NSW cultural places and the collection of memorabilia and records which traces its life over the last 63 years. 15 halls of entertainment (including Schools of Arts and open air theatres) are listed within Cabonne LGA. Of these 9 were purpose built but only the Amusu continues to operated in its original state and has a category 1 classification. Within the Central Tablelands and Central West Region of NSW 64 such structures are listed in Thorn et al. Of these four (4) are cited as having the highest category 1 rating, being the Amusu, The Palace in Parks (which has been adapted for another use), the Empire/Australia in Orange (which has since been converted into multiple smaller modern theatrettes in 1997) and Strand in Orange (which has been adapted to another use). In terms of fabric, the Victoria Theatre in Newcastle dates from the 1890s although its decor is of 1921.

Kuhns Plot summary The Great Recession of 2008 humbled many good men. Once featured on the front pages of New York's business and society papers, Jack Davis had spiraled downward in the aftermath of the crisis. How far will someone go to get their reputation back? Jack is about to find out. Exiled to the last remnant of his investment empire --a rusty silicon smelter in the Chinese jungle north of the Burmese border --his comeback seems farfetched. But it's either take his best shot or crawl away from the world in shame. His prospects appear grim when Jack discovers his employees are using the company's trucks to run jade from Burma over the border to China. His first instinct is to clean house --until he learns they're making more money running jade than he is smelting silicon. Set in a dangerous, once-obscure corner of the world that has recently vaulted to prominence, South of the Clouds tells the story of an American forced to choose, not between right and wrong --\\"there's no legal here\\" --but between the predictable and the unknown, between a stale life or one with Mei.

Born in Farafenni, Jallow completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Sierra Leone. He became a journalist, and was appointed as assistant editor of The Daily Observer in 1994, following the coup d'etat. He became editor-in-chief, and fought against the odds to maintain the paper's independence during the first years of the Yahya Jammeh regime. He resigned in 1999 when new owners threatened its independence, and he founded The Independent shortly after. As its editor, Jallow took very strong stances against the regime, especially regarding the April 2000 Gambian student massacre. He was a constant target of harassment from government forces, and was in such danger that he was forced into exile in the United States in September 2000. Jallow completed a master's degree at Rutgers University and a PhD at the University of California, Davis, in African history. He lectured at Creighton University, Nebraska, from 2011 to 2015, before becoming an assistant professor at La Salle University, Pennsylvania. He has published a number of academic books on African history, especially leadership, politics, social justice, and Catholics in Africa. He began working as a visiting professor at the University of The Gambia in 2017, and took a two-year leave of absence from La Salle following his appointment to the TRRC in 2018.  Early life  Jallow was born in Farafenni, and nearly dropped out of school growing up. He attended Armitage High School and Gambia High School and completed his undergraduate studies at Fourah Bay College, University of Sierra Leone.  Journalistic career  After graduating from Fourah Bay College, Jallow worked for the National Council for Arts and Culture as a research assistant, and then the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) as an assistant registrar. During his time at the WAEC, Jallow began writing a short story column for The Daily Observer, called 'Story of the Week'. One week after the 1994 coup d'etat, in which army officer Yahya Jammeh seized power from elected president Dawda Jawara, Jallow left his job at the WAEC and was appointed assistant editor of the Observer by Kenneth Best.  The Daily Observer  Jallow subsequently became editor-in-chief of the paper. He maintained a strong independent editorial policy at the paper, which led to him being arrested multiple times by the police and the National Intelligence Agency (NIA). Immigration officers were stationed at the entrance to the paper's building to check the papers of everyone who came in. During this time, it became clear the paper would not survive for very long, so Jallow developed the idea for a new independent paper, The Independent. Jallow resigned in 1999 shortly after the paper was bought by Amadou Samba, a close friend of Jammeh. Jallow was offered to stay on as editor-in-chief, but he was told that the paper's news editor, Demba Ali Jawo, was going to be sacked, and Jallow suspected this was related to critical comments he had made about Jammeh's regime in his weekly column. Jallow told that management that he would not edit a paper that fired journalists due to their opinions, and so when Jawo was fired, the next day Jallow submitted his resignation.  The Independent  After leaving the Observer, Jallow founded The Independent. Compared to other private newspapers such as The Point and Foroyaa, Jallow said \\"I think we were probably more reckless, if you like, in our brand of independent journalism.\\" The paper had the motto 'Truth is our Principle', and was known for its \\"hard-hitting\\" editorials. Within three weeks of being published, the paper was forced to close for 'failure to register'. After formally registering, the paper resumed publication, but the NIA and police continued their harassment. On one occasion, all of the paper's staff were taken into waiting vehicles and detained briefly at the NIA headquarters. The paper was petrol-bombed twice, and its new Heidelberg press was burnt to the ground by Jammeh sympathisers. The paper reported extensively on the April 2000 Gambian student massacre and published a number of strongly-worded editorials about the incident, and the paper continued its firm stance after the report of the commission of inquiry. Shortly after, the government claimed Jallow was not Gambian, and immigration officers interrogated him and his parents, who ID cards were permanently seized. Jallow heard from a government source that they were planning on deporting him to an unknown country. With concerns about his own safety, Jallow applied to the US Embassy for a visa and he left for the United States in September 2000.  Academic career  After regularising his immigration status in the United States, Jallow was accepted onto the master's program in Liberal Studies at the Camden campus of Rutgers University in New Jersey. He graduated from this in May 2005, and was accepted onto the doctoral program in African Studies at Howard University. A year later, he transferred to the same program at the University of California, Davis, from which he graduated in 2011. He taught African History at Creighton University in Nebraska for four years. In 2015, he became an assistant professor at La Salle University in Pennsylvania. In 2017, Jallow was appointed as a visiting professor at the University of The Gambia, teaching the master's degree program in African History. As an academic, his research interests have been the history of colonial and postcolonial Africa, censorship, press freedom, and state formation in Africa. He has also researched Catholics and social justice in Africa. He has published a number of books on leadership and politics. Jallow has published a number of academic books, and academic articles, including in the Vienna Journal of African Studies, the Journal of Asian and African Studies, Interventions, the Journal of Critical Southern Studies, and the Journal of Religion and Society. He also published a collection of essays about Gambian politics, called Defying Dictatorship, in 2017.  Truth and reconciliation commission  In February 2018, it was announced that Jallow had been appointed as executive secretary of the Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission. He was granted a two- year leave of absence from La Salle and was formally sworn-in at a ceremony at the State House on 1 March. Following the Faraba shooting, Jallow published an open letter to President Adama Barrow, imploring justice for the victims.

An area of disturbed weather developed within the vicinity of the Caroline Islands during the second week of July. A tropical depression developed southeast of Guam on July 12, and on the next day, intensified into a tropical storm. Tracking generally west- northwest, Warren deepened into a typhoon on July 14\\\\. The storm subsequently entered a period of rapid intensification, commencing with Warren reaching its highest intensity on July 16\\\\. The following evening, the typhoon brushed Luzon, resulting in a weakening trend, although Warren was still a typhoon when it made landfall near Shantou. Warren rapidly dissipated inland. Across the Philippines, 3,560 houses were damaged and an additional 21,329 were destroyed, displacing 19,224 families. Six people were killed and damage was estimated at US$11.4 million. In Hong Kong, severe flooding occurred, especially in low-lying areas, several trees were downed, and there were reports of five landslides. There, 12 people suffered injuries and one individual was injured. In Shantou, six people perished, 106 others suffered injuries, 4,500 homes were destroyed, and 38,000 homes received damage. Throughout Guangdong Province, 150,000 homes were damaged and 13,000 others were destroyed. Overall, 17 people lost their lives, 153 people were wounded, and damage was estimated at $270 million. Meteorological history Typhoon Warren developed from an area of disorganized convection in the eastern Caroline Islands that was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on July 11\\\\. An increase in organization and improved upper-level outflow promoted the JTWC to raise its development chances. A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued for the system, which was located around southeast of Guam, at 05:30 UTC on July 12. Shortly thereafter, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared the system a tropical depression At noon, satellite images showed a central dense overcast and satellite intensity estimates supported winds of . At 16:00 UTC on July 12, the JTWC classified the system as a tropical depression. Tracking westward, the depression passed within north of Guam. On the morning of July 13, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Warren by the JTWC, although post-storm analysis revealed that the depression actually became a tropical storm late on July 12. At 00:00 UTC on July 14, the JMA declared the system a tropical storm, with the JTWC upgrading Warren to a typhoon that evening. Tracking west-northwestward while also accelerating, Warren continued to gradually deepen, and on the morning of July 15, the JMA designated Warren a severe tropical storm. At the time of the upgrade, Warren was located around east of Manila. Twenty-four hours later, the JMA upped Warren into a typhoon. Around this time, the storm entered a rapid intensification phase that commenced with the JTWC estimating that Warren reached its peak intensity of , equal to a low-end Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, on July 16. Around the same time, the JMA estimated that Warren achieved its peak intensity of and a minimum barometric pressure of . While tracking across the Philippine Sea, many tropical cyclone forecast models showed Warren tracking northward near Taiwan and eventually recurving out to sea. However, forecasters at the JTWC continued to predict a westward motion because satellite imagery and mid-level synoptic analysis showed a subtropical ridge to its north. According to the JTWC, the typhoon weakened slightly on July 17, though data from the JMA suggested that Warren maintained its maximum intensity until Warren skirted Luzon that evening. Land interaction resulted in some weakening, with the JTWC and JMA lowering the intensity of the typhoon to and at 00:00 UTC on July 18. After entering the South China Sea, Warren made landfall near the city of Shantou on the morning of July 19. At the time, the JTWC estimated winds of while the JMA reported winds of . The storm rapidly weakened overland, and the storm dissipated on July 20 over the province of Guangdong. Preparations and impact The inner core of the typhoon brushed the northern Philippines, prompting flooding that resulted in the suspension of classes. Around 60 people fled their homes in Baguio. Somewhere in the northern portion of the country, a man was killed when his motorcycle skidded on a slippery road as he went to inspect storm damage. Nationwide, the storm damaged of rice and of corn. Approximately 1,600 families lost access to drinking water. A total of 3,560 homes were damaged and an additional 21,329 were destroyed, which resulted in 102,169 people or 19,224 families that either sought shelter or were homeless. Six people were killed in the country. The storm inflicted US$11.4 million in damage to the country, including $10.1 million from infrastructure.

Haller Jr. was born in Pulaski, Virginia, to a family of dentists and physicians originally from York, Pennsylvania. His father, J. Alex Haller Sr., raised him with the help of two aunts, after his mother, Julia Allison, died. Haller Jr. contracted scarlet fever as a child, which led him to study medicine. He played basketball and football at Pulaski High School, graduating in 1944. Haller considered attending the University of Virginia in his home state, but was accepted at Vanderbilt University, where he had applied at his high school principal's suggestion. There, Haller met his future wife, Emily Simms, and played for the Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball team until his senior year of college. Haller planned to enroll at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, but applied to the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, having heard from professors that Hopkins specialized in surgery, his field of choice. After completing his medical degree at Hopkins in 1951, Haller pursued further study in Europe on the advice of Arnold R. Rich. Haller was trained in pathology under Hans von Meyenburg at the University of Zurich. Haller was conscripted after his return from Switzerland. Rejected by the United States Navy, he instead joined the Coast Guard in 1953, where he served six months at the Coast Guard Surgical Unit in San Pedro, California. He later transferred to the National Heart Institute, where he served until 1955. After completing his residency at Hopkins, Haller began teaching at the University of Louisville in 1959, and later served as chief of cardiac surgery at the Louisville General Hospital. Haller returned to Johns Hopkins in 1963 as assistant professor of surgery, and led the newly established pediatric surgery division. He was appointed the first Robert Garrett Professor of Pediatric Surgery in 1967. Over the course of his career, Haller helped develop the Advanced Pediatric Life Support program, and the Maryland Emergency Medical Services system. He is the namesake and co-creator of the Haller index. Haller was a founding member and later president of the American Pediatric Surgical Association. He retired in 1992. Haller died at home in Glencoe, Maryland, on June 13, 2018, aged 91.

His departure was credited to what The Guardian described as his \\"uncompromising\\" support for Brexit. Deputy Leader Paul Davies was appointed as an Interim Leader, and announced that he would stand for the permanent leadership. In July, Suzy Davies announced she would stand, saying that she thought it was important for the Welsh Conservatives to have a contested election. She said she would be willing to work with Plaid Cymru to get rid of the Labour government in Wales. She supported reducing taxes, as well as giving some business rates proceeds to councils to use them for private sector-led local development strategies. Suzy Davies also argued for giving the private sector a \\"real stake in the communities in which they develop\\" and giving workers an \\"emotional stake\\" in their employers.

The railway bridge was designed by John Whitton and built in 1886. The bridge is also known as the Meadowbank Rail Bridge over Parramatta River, erroneously the John Whitton Bridge and the Meadowbank-Rhodes Railway Bridge. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The bridge was built in 1886. In 1980, a new parallel bridge, the John Whitton Bridge, was built to carry the train line and the historic bridge was taken out of use. After twenty years of disuse, it was converted to a pedestrian bridge and cycleway in the lead-up to the 2000 Summer Olympics. In 2016, the local mayor and state opposition expressed concern about the deteriorating state of the bridge and called upon the state government to fund repairs and confirm their future plans for the bridge.  Heritage listing  The Meadowbank-Rhodes bridge is one of twelve double lattice girder bridges that survive substantially intact in the NSW railway system. As such it is of exceptional heritage significance as evidence of a short lived but highly popular approach to bridge design in which the spanning girders were reinforced by a lattice of bars, adjusted to suit changing structural forces. This bridge is the largest double track lattice girder bridge to be prefabricated in England for export to Australia and has significant variations on the standardised design. The bridge is one of the most architecturally impressive nineteenth century Australian railway structures. A unity in design, lively detail, skilful use of materials and fine workmanship is displayed by the bridge and its abutments. The Meadowbank-Rhodes bridge is an exceptional piece of early Australian railway engineering.Sinclair Knight Merz, 1996 Meadowbank Rail Bridge over Parramatta River was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

The band was formed in 1964 by members of the already well-known group Trio 63 in Rostock. The original Beat Quartett members were Wolfgang Ziegler (bandleader, guitar, vocals and piano), Wolfgang Fennel (guitar), Eckhardt Woytowicz (tenor saxophone, alto saxophone, clarinet, flute, guitar) and Hans-Joachim Seering (drums); the group made their first television appearances with this line-up, including \\"Herzklopfen kostenlos\\" moderated by Heinz Quermann. The band made a brief performance in the children's film \\"Reise nach Sundevit\\" in 1965 and at the request of director Heiner Carow recorded the entire soundtrack in Babelsberg. The film score was composed by Wolfgang Ziegler in collaboration with Wolfgang Fennel. For cultural reasons the band had to change their name to Baltic Quartet in 1966. After that the group made only one more film appearance, in the little-known film \\"Trick 17b\\". Peter Zimmermann (bass) joined the band and Knud Benedict (guitar) replaced Wolfgang Flennel in 1967, so they renamed themselves the Baltic Quintet. In 1969 Benedict and Seering left the band to form Badister with former Baltic member Fennel, and Reinhard M√∂ller (keyboard). With the end of the beat era the Baltic Quintett moved closer to the musical genre of the Music Stromers, so becoming a soul band, but they were not able to compete with the popularity of the Music Stormers and split up in 1972. Ziegler formed another band, Wir. The songs \\"Sag nie vorbei\\", produced in 1969 by GDR radio (\\"Rundfunk der DDR\\"), and \\"Mit dir leben\\" were among their greatest successes. Both were recorded in 1971 by the GDR label Amiga. \\"Mit dir leben\\" can also be heard on the Amiga Sampler A Go- Go from 2000. From 1970 to 1972 the band had several opportunities to appeare on GDR television, among others in the youth program Basar.

It originally referred to small double-outrigger dugout canoes used in rivers and shallow coastal waters, but since the 18th century, it has expanded to include larger lashed-lug ships, with or without outriggers. Though the term used is the same throughout the Philippines, \\"bangka\\" can refer to a very diverse range of boats specific to different regions. Bangka was also spelled as banca, panca, or panga (m. banco, panco, pango) in Spanish. It is also known archaically as sakayan (also spelled sacayan). In the various animist anitism beliefs of precolonial Philippines, the building of bangka often involved religious rituals, from the choosing of the trees for timber to rituals before voyages. Newly built bangka were imbued with a guardian spirit (anito) through various rituals, usually involving blood sacrifices. Ancient and early colonial-era bangka were also usually decorated with a carved or painted face. Bangka had a central role in pre-Hispanic Filipino culture, functioning as personal transports, fishing ships, trading ships, and raiding warships. Motorized or paddle-driven bangka still remain the main form of watercraft in the Philippines. Etymology Bangka is derived from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *ba≈ãka î, with cognates including Kavalan bangka, Mori bangka, and Sumbawa bangka. It is a doublet of two other protoforms referring to boats: Proto-Austronesian *qaba≈ã and Proto- Central-Malayo-Polynesian *wa≈ãka. Ultimately from the Proto-Austronesian lexical root *ba≈ã for \\"boat\\". History Austronesians which began at about 3000 BCE Indigenous Philippine boats originated from the ancestral single- outrigger dugout canoes of the Austronesian peoples, which themselves evolved from catamarans. These boats were the first ocean-voyaging vessels in the world, which allowed the seaborne Austronesian Expansion around 3000 to 1500 BCE, from coastal southeastern China and Taiwan to Island Southeast Asia, Micronesia, Island Melanesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar. Replica of a balangay, a pre-colonial trading ship excavated from Butuan. These replicas do not include the outriggers. The oldest recovered boats in the Philippines are the 9 to 11 balangay found in Butuan dated to 320 CE, all specimens of whom were typical lashed-lug Austronesian boats. The technique remained common in Philippine (and Southeast Asian) boats right up to the 19th century, when modern boats started to be built with metal nails. Edge-joined planks continue to survive in some areas in the Philippines, though these are usually secured with metal rebars and rods, instead of the traditional lugs and lashings. Unfortunately most excavations and recoveries of pre-colonial shipwrecks (including those by the National Museum) in Southeast Asia focus more on the cargo rather than studying the ship structures themselves. Looting is also a problem, which contributes to the paucity of research on pre-colonial Filipino watercraft. Various types of bangka were used in maritime trade. While the polities in the Philippines remained small and largely in the periphery of Southeast Asian trade, they were nevertheless part of the Southeast Asian market. The earliest exchange of material culture was the late Neolithic trade in lingling-o double-headed jade or gold ornaments, manufactured in Luzon, which was traded with other Austronesian polities in southern Vietnam and Taiwan. This was followed by later trade in ceramics from mainland Southeast Asia and southern China in exchange for resins, aromatic woods, gold, pearls, sea cucumber (trepanging), tortoiseshell, civets, fabrics, beeswax, and bird's nest. The main trading contacts of Philippine polities included the Champa polities in Vietnam, China, and the Sultanate of Brunei. Bangka were also used in wars and the naval warfare and coastal raids (mangayaw) of thalassocracies, a notable example of such a warship is the karakoa of the Visayas. These were seasonal and played a large part in the noble and warrior classes gaining prestige and plunder. Warriors participating in the raids had their exploits recorded in elaborate full-body tattoos. Construction Plan, midships section, and lines of a vinta Like all ancestral Austronesian boats, the hull of the bangka at its simplest form had five parts. The bottom part consists of single piece of hollowed-out log. At the sides were two planks, and two horseshoe-shaped wood pieces formed the prow and stern. These were fitted tightly together edge-to-edge with lugs, dowels and lashings (made from rattan or fiber), without using any nails. They formed the shell of the boat, which was then reinforced by horizontal ribs. They had no central rudders but were instead steered using an oar on one side. These were built in the double-canoe configuration or had a single outrigger on the windward side. In Island Southeast Asia, these developed into double outriggers on each side that provided greater stability when tacking against the wind. Bangka were also typically traditionally caulked using a boiled mixture of balaw sap from apitong trees (Dipterocarpus spp.) and gata (coconut milk). Though most modern bangka in the Philippines have double-outriggers, single-outrigger dugout canoes survived until recent times in some parts of the Philippines. Examples include a specimen in the University of Southampton from Manila Bay collected in the 1940s, as well as boats from Lake Bulusan and Lake Buhi of the Bicol Region of southern Luzon from as recently as 2015. The single outrigger is used to provide lateral stability, while still allowing fishermen to work with fishing nets. These traditional boats have largely disappeared in modern times, partly due to the scarcity of suitable timber and partly due to the relative cheapness of fiberglass boats. The ancestral rig was the mastless triangular crab claw sail which had two booms that could be tilted to the wind. The sails were made from mats woven from pandan leaves. The triangular crab claw sails also later developed into square or rectangular tanja sails, which like crab claw sails, can be tilted against the wind. Fixed tripod or bipod masts also developed in Southeast Asia. Cultural significance Aside from being used in trade and war, bangka were of central significance to various cultures throughout the Philippines. Villages were known as barangay, derived from balangay, a common large boat type. Boat terminologies were used for ranks, place names, and even personal names, even in island interiors. Among the Sama-Bajau people of the southern Philippines, various types of bangka like the djenging and the lepa served as houseboats of nuclear families and often sail together in clan flotillas. Small bangka were also sometimes used to transport rice and farm goods on land, as they were more convenient on narrow pathways than sleds or wagons. Bangka feature prominently in Visayan mythology. A boat known as the balanday is used by the deity Magyan to ferry souls of the dead. In the epic Labaw Donggon of the Suludnon people, a boat known as biday na inagta (lit. \\"black boat\\") is featured prominently. In the Western Visayas, a divination ritual known as the kibang involves occupants sitting perfectly still in a bangka and asking questions while a diwata (nature spirit) answers by rocking the boat. Modern bangka Propeller and rudder of a motorized bangka (pump boat) Since the introduction of the motor engine in the 1970s, the formerly widespread Philippine sailing traditions have mostly been lost. Most modern bangka are motorized and are known as \\"pump boats\\" (or pambot) or lancha (lantsa). Smaller boats usually use gasoline or diesel engines, while larger boats can use recycled automobile engines. Bangka are also increasingly being made with fiber-reinforced plastic (fiberglass) instead of wood, which are more resistant to shipworms and rotting and are relatively cheaper.

He had talent as an artist, and devoted some time to the study of drawing and painting. In 1808 Watts was a member of the Society of Associated Artists in Watercolours.

Signed beside Lake Prespa from which it took its name, and ratified by the parliaments of both countries on 25 January 2019, it went into force on 12 February 2019 when the two countries notified the UN of the deal's completion, following the ratification of the NATO accession protocol for North Macedonia on 8 February. It replaces the interim accord of 1995 and sees the country's constitutional name, then Republic of Macedonia, changed to Republic of North Macedonia . Treaty name The Prespa agreement is the short name for the deal, named after the location it was signed, Lake Prespa. Its full name is Final Agreement for the settlement of the differences as described in the United Nations Security Council Resolutions 817 (1993) and 845 (1993), the termination of the Interim Accord of 1995, and the establishment of a Strategic Partnership between the Parties. * * Background Ever since the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, the use of the name \\"Macedonia\\" had been disputed between the southeastern European countries of Greece and the Republic of Macedonia (which is now North Macedonia). The dispute arose from the ambiguity in nomenclature between the former Yugoslav state, the adjacent Greek region of Macedonia, and the ancient kingdom of Macedon. Citing historical and irredentist concerns, Greece opposed the use of the name \\"Macedonia\\" by the Republic of Macedonia without a geographical qualifier like \\"Northern\\" or \\"Upper\\" for use \\"by all ... and for all purposes\\". As approximately 2 million ethnic Greeks identify themselves as Macedonians who typically view themselves as being unrelated to the ethnic Macedonians, Greece further objected to the use of the term \\"Macedonian\\" for the neighboring country's largest ethnic group and its language. The Republic of Macedonia was accused of appropriating symbols and figures that are historically considered part of Greek culture, such as the Vergina Sun and Alexander the Great, and of promoting the irredentist concept of a United Macedonia, which involves territorial claims on Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, and Serbia. Prior to the Prespa agreement, international organizations provisionally referenced the Republic of Macedonia as \\"the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\\" (sometimes abbreviated as \\"FYROM\\"). Agreement history The Interim Accord of 1995, which was superseded by the Prespa agreement in 2019 The Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras announced on 12 June 2018 that an agreement had been reached with his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev on the dispute, \\"which covers all the preconditions set by the Greek side\\". The agreement was signed at Lake Prespa, a body of water which forms a partial common border between the Republic of North Macedonia, Greece and Albania. The proposal would result in the Republic of Macedonia being renamed the Republic of North Macedonia (; ), with the new name being used for all purposes (erga omnes), that is, domestically, in all bilateral relations and in all regional and international organizations and institutions. The deal includes recognition of the Macedonian language in the United Nations, noting that it is within the group of South Slavic languages, and that the citizenship of the country will be called Macedonian/citizen of the Republic of North Macedonia. Also, there is an explicit clarification that the citizens of the country are not related to ancient Hellenic civilization that previously inhabited the northern regions of Greece. Specifically, Article 7 mentions that both countries acknowledge that their respective understanding of the terms \\"Macedonia\\" and \\"Macedonian\\" refers to a different historical context and cultural heritage. When reference is made to Greece, these terms denote the area and people of its northern region, as well as the Hellenic civilization, history and culture of that region. When reference is made to Republic of Macedonia, these terms denote its territory, language and people, with their own, distinctly different, history and culture. Additionally, the agreement stipulates the removal of the Vergina Sun from public use in the Republic of North Macedonia and the formation of a committee for the review of school textbooks and maps in both countries for the removal of irredentist content and to align them with UNESCO and Council of Europe standards. These changes were put to a referendum for citizens of the Republic of Macedonia in the autumn of 2018. Political reactions The international community reacted positively to the Prespa agreement, with the media dubbing it as \\"historic\\". The European Union welcomed it, with the European Council President Donald Tusk tweeting his \\"sincere congratulations\\" to Tsipras and Zaev. \\"I am keeping my fingers crossed. Thanks to you, the impossible is becoming possible,\\" he said. EU Foreign Affairs chief Federica Mogherini and commissioner Johannes Hahn also issued a joint statement congratulating the two Prime Ministers \\"in reaching this historic agreement between their countries, which contributes to the transformation of the entire region of Southeast Europe.\\" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed the agreement, stating that it will set the Republic of Macedonia on the path towards NATO membership. Additionally, the British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson welcomed the agreement as being \\"fantastic news\\". \\"The agreement once and for always confirms and strengthens the Macedonian ethnic and cultural identity, the Macedonian language, the Macedonian nationality. It guarantees the security of the country and provides a secure future for the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia\\", Zaev said. The domestic communities reacted more negatively to the agreement. In Macedonia, the President of the Republic, Gjorge Ivanov, declared that he won't sign the agreement, calling it \\"disastrous\\". Additionally, VMRO-DPMNE, a right-wing party, also opposed the agreement, and pledged to organize public protests against it. In Macedonia, protests went violent at Skopje, and Macedonian SDSM MP Hari Lokvenec, who attended the Prespa ceremony, had his parliamentary vehicle set on fire at Bitola by unidentified perpetrators. Following his departure as Greek Foreign Minister, Kotzias stated in October 2018 that reasons for the Prespa agreement was to bring stability to the Balkans and to stop Turkish influence within the region. In Greece, Golden Dawn (GD), a far-right party, and the Communist Party of Greece (CPG), a far-left party, opposed the agreement, with a Golden Dawn MP, Konstantinos Barbarousis, calling for military rule and firing squads to execute politicians responsible for the deal. As a result, Barbarousis was expelled from his party, and a warrant was issued for his arrest for high treason. He fled using his parliamentary vehicle, but eventually was found and arrested. Additionally, the conservative New Democracy party filed a motion of no-confidence against Tsipras in parliament because of the name deal, which was rejected two days later with a simple parliamentary majority; 153 against it, 127 for. Kyriakos Mitsotakis, leader of the New Democracy party, had argued in this connection that the Greek Foreign Minister (and hence the government of SYRIZA) had no authority to sign the agreement, based on international legal arguments that were responded to by legal scholars. Public reactions In Greece, the deeply unpopular agreement had an instant negative impact on Tsipras's chances of staying in power. According to separate polls conducted by Marc and Ekathimerini, between 65% and 68% of Greeks were against the Prespes deal and what was contained within it. There were large public demonstrations in 2018 and 2019 against the Prespes deal in Athens and Thessaloniki that lasted days. There were also vast student sit-ins which effected 210 schools in Central Macedonia alone. Despite the uproar, the protesters were accused of having links with far-right fascists. In response, famous composer and leftist Mikis Theodorakis, who was also against the Prespes deal, called the Syriza government 'left-wing fascists'. In North Macedonia, the majority of public perception was also against the deal but not to the same extent as the Greek public. According to polls conducted by Sitel TV, 45% of the public stated they felt negatively towards the deal while 44% said they felt positively towards it. Around half (50.5 percent) of those surveyed said they thought the government in Skopje did a good job during the negotiations with Greece against 40.7 percent who said it did not. Signature The Prespa agreement, which replaced the Interim Accord of 1995, was signed on 17 June 2018 in a high-level ceremony at the Greek border village of Psarades on Lake Prespa, by the two foreign ministers Nikola Dimitrov and Nikos Kotzias and in the presence of the respective Prime Ministers, Zoran Zaev and Alexis Tsipras. The meeting was attended by the UN's Special Representative Matthew Nimetz, the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo, the EU's High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, and the European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy Johannes Hahn, among others. After the ceremony, Tsipras, along with his Macedonian counterpart, crossed over the border to the Macedonian side of Lake Prespa for lunch at the village of Ote≈°evo, in a highly symbolic move that marked the first entry of a Greek Prime Minister into the Republic of Macedonia since it declared independence in 1991.  Ratification and implementation  On 13 June 2018, Zaev said that North Macedonia is changing the license plates of its vehicles from MK to NMK to reflect the country's new name. The Macedonian government announced that the statues of Alexander the Great, Philip II of Macedon and Olympias of Epirus, which were raised as part of the Skopje 2014 program, will be given new inscriptions with clarifications that they symbolize the Ancient Greek period and are \\"honouring Greek-Macedonian friendship\\". Ratification by the Macedonian Parliament On 20 June, the Prespa agreement was ratified by the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia with 69 MPs voting in favor of it. Opposition party VMRO-DPMNE boycotted the parliamentary session and declared the Prespa treaty as a \\"genocide of the legal state\\" and a \\"genocide of the entire nation\\". On 25 June, the Greek Foreign Ministry informed the EU and NATO that Greece is no longer objecting to Macedonia's Euro-Atlantic accession under the new name. The next day, however, the Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov refused to sign the agreement and threatened the Macedonian PM Zaev and the ruling coalition's MPs with imprisonment of at least 5 years for voting in favor of an agreement which, according to Ivanov, puts the Republic of Macedonia in a subordinate position to a foreign state. \\"I do not accept the constitutional change aimed at changing the constitutional name [of the country]. I do not accept ideas or proposals which would endanger Macedonia‚Äôs national identity, the individuality of the Macedonian nation, the Macedonian language and the Macedonian model of coexistence. In the presidential election, 534,910 citizens voted in favor of this electoral program. The agreement goes beyond the scope of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 817 (1993) and 845 (1993), since it refers to the \\"difference in the name of the State\\" and not to the \\"disputes\\" to which the agreement refers\\", Ivanov said, adding that \\"This agreement brings the Republic of Macedonia to subordination from another country, namely the Republic of Greece. According to Article 308 of the Penal Code, \\"a citizen who brings the Republic of Macedonia to a state of subservience or dependence on another state is punishable by imprisonment of at least five years\\". The legalization of this agreement creates legal consequences that are the basis for committing a crime.\\" The withdrawal of the Greek veto resulted in the European Union approving on 27 June the start of accession talks with the Republic of Macedonia, to begin the next year conditional on the implementation of the Prespa deal and the change of the nation's constitutional name to Republic of North Macedonia. On 5 July, the Prespa agreement was ratified again by the Macedonian parliament with 69 MPs voting in favor of it. On 11 July, NATO invited Macedonia to start accession talks in a bid to become the Euro-Atlantic alliance‚Äôs 30th member.  Macedonian referendum and ratification  Results of 2018 Macedonian referendum On 30 July, the parliament of Macedonia approved plans to hold a non-binding referendum on changing the country's name that took place on 30 September. 91% of voters voted in favour with a 37% turnout, but the referendum was not carried because of a constitutional requirement for a 50% turnout. Total turnout for the referendum was at 666,344 and of those some 260,000 were ethnic Albanian voters of Macedonia. The government intended to push forward with the name change. On 15 October 2018, the parliament of Macedonia began debating the name change. The proposal for the constitutional reform requires the vote of 80 MPs, i.e. two-thirds of the 120-seat parliament. On 16 October, US Assistant Secretary of State Wess Mitchell sent a letter to VMRO-DPMNE leader Hristijan Mickoski, in which he expresses the disappointment of the United States with the positions of the leadership, including him personally, and asks to \\"set aside partisan interests\\" and work to get the name change approved. Mickoski expressed his hope that the Republic of Macedonia will be very soon a part of the NATO and EU families, \\"but proud and dignified, not humiliated, disfigured and disgraced.\\" On 19 October the parliament voted to start the process of renaming the country \\"North Macedonia\\", after a total of 80 MPs voted in favour of the constitutional changes. On 30 October, the Skopje Public Prosecutor's Office opened a case against Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov for his refusal to fulfill his constitutional obligations in signing the Prespa agreement after it was ratified by the Macedonian Parliament. On 3 December 2018, Macedonia's Parliament approved a draft constitutional amendment, with 67 lawmakers voting in favour, 23 voting against and 4 abstaining. A simple majority was needed at this stage. After some political wrangling over constitutional issues related to the multi-ethnic makeup of the state, all Albanian political parties of Macedonia voted in favour of the name change along with the governing Social- Democrats and some members of the opposition. On 11 January 2019, the Macedonian Parliament completed the legal implementation of the Prespa Agreement by approving the constitutional changes for renaming the country to North Macedonia with a two-thirds parliamentary majority (81 MPs). International reactions to Macedonian ratification The international community, NATO and European Union leaders, including Greek PM Alexis Tsipras and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, as well as heads of neighboring states, congratulated the Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev. The British Prime Minister Theresa May described the vote as a \\"historic moment\\", while the Kosovar President Hashim Tha√ßi expressed his hope that the Prespa Agreement, which resolved the Macedonia Naming Dispute, can be used as a \\"model\\" for resolving Kosovo's dispute with Serbia as well. Albanian President Ilir Meta congratulated the name change and Albanian Foreign Minister Ditmir Bushati hailed the vote by tweeting that Albanian political parties were the \\"decisive factor\\". In exile from Hungary, the fugitive former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski has condemned the Prespa agreement, stating that the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev \\"scammed\\" and \\"tricked\\" the Macedonian people over the country's name change, and that the Greek politicians imposed an unfavourable deal upon North Macedonia that outlines exclusive claims over \\"antique history\\" by Greece. Post-Macedonian ratification developments On 13 January 2019, Greece Defence Minister Panos Kammenos and his Independent Greeks party quit Greece's ruling coalition over the Prespa agreement, potentially leaving the governing coalition without a workable majority in parliament. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras then held a confidence vote on 16 January and survived 151-148, with one lawmaker absent. Tsipras survived the vote with 145 of his Radical Left Syriza party and with 6 MPs who were either Independents or Independent Greeks (ANEL). In the days prior to the ratification of the Prespa agreement by the Greek Parliament, over 60,000 protesters (according to police; 600,000, according to organizers) from all over the country arrived in Athens to demand the rejection of the agreement; some of these protests had become violent, with the police required to use tear gas to disperse the groups. During the last week, public opinion poll showed that over 65% of the people were against the ratification of the Prespa agreement, whereas many popular Greek artists (S. Xarhakos, V. Papakonstantinou J. Kotsiras etc.) agreed that a referendum should have been held. On 19 January, Mikis Theodorakis' editorial was published in which he characterized the ratification of the agreement from Greek MPs as a \\"crime\\", demanding a referendum in Greece on the agreement as well. On 23 January, just a day prior to the ratification in the Hellenic Parliament, hundreds of scholars, professors, writers and artists from all over Greece signed petitions in support of the Prespa agreement. In a February 2019 survey, a public opinion poll done for Sitel TV channel in North Macedonia showed 44.6 percent of respondents were positive about the Prespa agreement, while 45.6 percent were negative toward the accord. A majority, 59.5 percent expressed that the agreement would positively impact relations between both countries and 57.7 percent felt that the two states would implement the accord. Half of respondents, 50.5 percent stated that the Macedonian government did well in negotiations with Greece and 40.7 percent disagreed that it did. Survey participants (49.2 percent) felt that the agreement would make travel into Greece easier. A June 2020 poll in North Macedonia, conducted by the National Democratic Institute, showed that the 58% of Macedonians support the Prespa agreement and that there is also strong public support for the country's Euro- Atlantic direction, with 74% positive opinions for NATO (of which North Macedonia has been a member since 27 March 2020) and 79% positive opinions for accession to the European Union.NDI Poll: Public opinion research in North Macedonia. June 2020, NDI, July 2, 2020. Ratification by the Greek Parliament On 25 January 2019, Greece's Parliament approved the Prespa agreement with 153 votes in favor and 146 votes against, with 1 abstention. Shortly after the ratification of the deal, Greece's Alternate Foreign Minister Georgios Katrougalos signed, in the Greek Parliament, the enacted law of the Prespa Agreement. The international community, including the Prime Ministers Theresa May of United Kingdom, Justin Trudeau of Canada, Boyko Borisov of Bulgaria and Edi Rama of Albania, Presidents Emmanuel Macron of France, Hashim Tha√ßi of Kosovo, Donald Tusk of the European Union, and Jean- Claude Juncker of the EU's Commission, USA's and Germany's foreign Ministers, Michael Pompeo and Heiko Maas respectively, Romania's EU minister George Ciamba whose country held EU presidency, as well as NATO's chief Jens Stoltenberg, welcomed positively the ratification of the deal. Furthermore, the Republic of Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, in his congratulatory message to his Greek counterpart Alexis Tsipras, whom he called \\"a friend\\", described the ratification as a \\"historic victory\\" which \\"ends a long-standing diplomatic conflict between Athens and Skopje\\". Russia, on the other hand, opposed the Prespa Agreement citing the low turnout in the non-binding 2018 referendum on changing the country's name. Hungary, which gave asylum to fugitive former Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, a staunch critic of the agreement, also lobbied against it. Post-Greek ratification developments On 6 February 2019, NATO's 29 members signed the accession protocol with North Macedonia.  Nobel Peace Prize nomination  On 28 January 2019, it was confirmed that Alexis Tsipras and Zoran Zaev were nominated by Nobel Laureate Wided Bouchamaoui for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize.

Early life Fliegerbauer was born in Westerndorf, Lower Bavaria and grew up on a farm with his two siblings. He originally attended Agricultural school before taking up an apprenticeship with the Bavarian State Police. Fliegerbauer was appointed as police officer of the Municipial Police Munich to the rank \\"Polizeiobermeister\\" (Policeuppermaster) on 19 November 1970. In 1964 he met his future wife who he then married in 1966 and two years later they had a son, Alfred. During the 1972 Munich Olympic Games, Fliegerbauer was assigned to a riot police unit. Death On 5 September Fliegerbauer's unit was ordered to F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base, where the West German Police had planned to rescue the nine Israeli hostages taken by eight Black September terrorists. Fliegerbauer took position inside the airport building at the base of the control tower directly opposite where the two Bell UH-1 Iroquois carrying the Israeli hostages and terrorists landed. Upon discovering that the Lufthansa plane had no crew and suspecting a trap, terrorist leader 'Issa' (Luttif Afif) and his deputy 'Tony' (Yusuf Nazzal) ran back towards the two helicopters, shouting as they did so to the terrorists at the helicopters. Three West German Police marksmen stationed on the roof of the control opened fire on the six terrorists at outside the two helicopters and at least one on Afif and Nazzal still moving back towards the helicopters. As they did so, Fliegerbauer, still positioned inside the airport building at the base of the control tower, also opened fire on the terrorist leader and his deputy with a submachine gun. According to Simon Reeve, author of One Day in September, Fliegerbauer had fired less than half the bullets in his magazine when a random shot from the one of the Black September terrorists came through the window and struck him in the side of the head. In a chapter entitled \\"Death at the Munich Olympics,\\" Kay Schiller, professor of cultural history at Durham University, writes that Fliegerbauer was celebrated as a \\"hero who had paid the ultimate price in his attempt to liberate innocent hostages,\\" and argues that this made it easier for the German public to \\"cope with the death of the Israelis,\\" despite the fact that it was clear that the response of German security had been incompetent. Memorials Fliegerbauer was buried on 8 September after a \\"well attended\\" civic funeral attended by the Mayor of Munich Georg Kronawitter and Prime Minister of Bavaria Alfons Goppel with wreaths laid on behalf of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt and West German President Gustav Heinemann. In a memorial service held at F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base in 2012, commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre, Fliegerbauer was remembered alongside the eleven members of the Israeli delegation slain by the terrorists. During 2016 Fliegerbauer was memorialized at the Olympic Village in Brazil. On the memorial to the massacre erected at Olympiapark (Munich), Fliegerbauer is described in a sentence that reads, \\"The police failed in this attempt, and the operation ended in disaster. All of the hostages and the German police officer Anton Fliegerbauer, as well as five of the terrorists, died.\\" References Category:1940 births Category:1972 deaths Category:Deaths by firearm in Germany Category:German terrorism victims Category:Male murder victims Category:Murdered German police officers Category:Terrorism deaths in Germany Category:Victims of the Munich massacre ","title":"Anton Fliegerbauer"},{"id":"57776452","text":"Maxime Courby (born November 23, 1990) is a French professional basketball player for JL Bourg of LNB Pro A.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. History Howell was first settled in 1833-34. The village was platted in 1835, and in 1836 became the county seat for Livingston County. The stretch along Grand River Avenue that is encompassed by this historic district has been the center of commercial activity since the 1830s. The buildings that are currently located in the district date from the 1870s. Disastrous fires in the district in 1887 and 1892 destroyed some of the earlier buildings, but replacement infill structures were quickly constructed. Description The Howell Downtown Historic District is located in the central business district of the city, and incorporates parts of nine city blocks as well as the courthouse square. The district encompasses about fourteen acres, and includes sixty building, of which forty-six contribute to the historic significance of the district. These buildings date from 1865 to the mid-twentieth century, and include Italianate, Gothic Revival, High Victorian, Richardsonian Romanesque, Neoclassical, Tudor Revival, Colonial Revival, and Art Deco architectural styles. The area is primarily commercial buildings of one and two stories in height, but also includes landmark public buildings such as the Livingston County Courthouse (separately listed on the National Register of Historic Places), the Carnegie Library, and the First Presbyterian Church. Significant buildings include: * First Presbyterian Church (323 West Grand River Avenue): The First Presbyterian Church, located at the west end of the district, was designed by Sidney Badgley in 1915 in a modified English Gothic style. It is constructed of gray coursed ashlar, and has a large square crenelated tower with pinnacles and an arched belfrey. Windows contain Gothic tracery. A contemporary wing adjoins the church. * Carnegie Library (314 West Grand River Avenue) The Carnegie Librar is located across the street from the Presbyterian Church, and is located on a large lot in a park-like setting. It is a Neoclassical building, constructed in 1903-06 of local fieldstone and granite shaded gray, deep rose and white. A round cupola is atop the roof. * McPherson Oil Company (223 West Grand River): The former McPherson Oil Company has a large exterior brick chimney and Tudor Revival elements. * Opera House (123 West Grand River Avenue): The former Opera House is a three-story red brick building constructed in 1881 and designed by architect Almon C. Varney. The first floor contains storefronts, while the upper two floors contained a theater. In 1938, a shiny black carrara glass storefront was installed. * McPherson Store (108-110 West Grand River): The former McPherson Store is a two-story High Victorian bichromatic brick building, decorated with distinctive polychrome tiles. It has a heavy cornice with small towers, and segmental arched, double sash windows with hood moldings containing a floral motif on the second floor. The building was constructed for blacksmith and merchant William P. McPherson, likely in the 1880s. * Jewett Block (101 East Grand River): Now the First National Bank, the former Jewett Block is a three- story Italianate brick building with arched windows and a heavy bracketed cornice. It was built in 1872-73 for drygoods merchants Jewett, Goodnow and Kickey. The First State Savings Bank occupied part of the building beginning in 1919, and in 1946 it was purchased by the First National Bank. * Livingston County Courthouse (200 East Grand River Avenue): The Livingston County Courthouse is a three-story Richardsonian Romanesque building, designed by architect Albert E. French in 1889. It is set back from the street on a parcel of land encompassing an entire block. It has a distinctive clock tower the can be seen from a great distance, seet atop a steeply pitched hip roof with gabled dormers. * Howell Theater (313-319 East Grand River Avenue): The Howell Theater is a two-story yellow brick building constructed in 1912 as the Temple Theater.

She was the daughter of the Antwerp senator Jean F√©lix Van den Bergh who ran the ‚ÄúLa Cloche‚Äù brewery with his brother Maximilien.Hotel Mayer-van den Bergh in erfgoed Vlaanderen Henriette married the Cologne businessman Emil Mayer in 1857, who had moved to Antwerp to open a franchise for his family's pharmacy and spice business. The Mayer-Van den Berghs purchased the 'Hof van Arenberg' on the corner of Lange Gasthuisstraat and Arenbergstraat in 1861 and renovated it to suit their taste. They had two sons, Fritz and Oscar. After the death of her husband Emil in 1879, Henriette withdrew from society but turned to the study of art. Her oldest son Fritz broke off his studies to move back in with her and Oscar took over the family business. In 1887 Fritz took her name, and in 1888 both sons were granted noble titles.Henri√´tte van den Bergh, Fritz‚Äôs mother on museum website Fritz became thereafter known in the art world as 'Chev. Mayer-van den Bergh'. Founding a museum During the years her husband was alive, Henriette was probably already active as a collector, as the archives of her museum have provenance notes by her son Fritz indicating \\"Maman\\" for works purchased by her. After her son returned to live with her, he first spent time on his own numismatic collection and then turned his attention to cataloguing the family's art. In 1892, mother and son sold a large part of their collection, presumably to enable Fritz to make serious acquisitions with an eye for founding a museum. During the next nine years he became a dealer in his own right, making sales and purchases to augment his growing collection. After his untimely death, Henriette fulfilled his dream, hiring the architect Joseph Hertogs to build an adjacent building in Gothic style, and hiring advisors to help her oversee her son's estate, while securing his papers regarding the core collection that was destined for the museum. She curated the museum herself until she died, leaving a legacy that has survived to the present day.

Its formation from its parent drugs is catalyzed by 5Œ±-reductase in tissues that express the enzyme in high amounts like the liver, skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland. 5Œ±-DHET has significant affinity for steroid hormone receptors and may contribute importantly to the activities of its parent drugs. Pharmacology Pharmacodynamics The affinity of 5Œ±-DHET for the androgen receptor (AR) is relatively high, in the range of 38 to 100% of that of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). A study found that, similarly to norethisterone and its 5Œ±-reduced metabolite 5Œ±-dihydronorethisterone, 5Œ±-DHET showed increased affinity for the AR but decreased androgenic potency relative to ethisterone (Ki = 16.1 nM for 5Œ±-DHET and 101.1 nM for ethisterone, a 6-fold difference in affinity). The decreased androgenic activity of 5Œ±-DHET in spite of increased affinity for the AR relative to ethisterone suggests that it has comparatively reduced efficacy as an agonist of the receptor, analogously to selective androgen receptor modulators (AR partial agonists) and antiandrogens (AR antagonists). 5Œ±-DHET has relatively low affinity for the progesterone receptor, only about 12% of that of the progestogen progesterone. This is significantly less than that of ethisterone, which has been found to bind to the receptor with an affinity of 35% of that of progesterone. Conversely, it has relatively high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor, about 120% of that of the corticosteroid dexamethasone. In regards to the estrogen receptors, 5Œ±-DHET has weak affinity for the ERŒ± of about 3.5% of that of estradiol, and does not bind to the ERŒ≤ (Ki > 10 ŒºM). In addition to steroid hormone receptors, 5Œ±-DHET has very high affinity for sex hormone-binding globulin (Kd = 0.18 nM), an androgen and estrogen binding and transport protein that has the effect of intermittently inactivating steroid hormones (but also prolonging their half-life in the body). Its affinity for this protein is among the highest of any known compound and has been found to be roughly equal to that of DHT and mesterolone (1Œ±-methyl-DHT). This property may contribute to the androgenic activity of 5Œ±-DHET's parent drug ethisterone by displacing endogenous androgens like testosterone and DHT from SHBG. Pharmacokinetics Metabolism studies of ethynylandrostanediol revealed that 5Œ±-DHET can be metabolized via C7Œ≤ and C16Œ± hydroxylation. Chemistry 5Œ±-DHET, also known as 5Œ±-dihydro-17Œ±-ethynyltestosterone (17Œ±-ethynyl-DHT) as well as 17Œ±-ethynyl-5Œ±-androstan-17Œ≤-ol-3-one or 5Œ±,17Œ±-pregn-20-yn-17Œ≤-ol-3-one, is a synthetic androstane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is specifically the combined derivative of 5Œ±-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and ethisterone (17Œ±-ethynyltestosterone). The steroid is also closely related to ethynylandrostanediol (17Œ±-ethynyl-5Œ±-androstane-3Œ±,17Œ≤-diol). Analogues Some closely related synthetic 5Œ±-reduced steroid metabolites include 5Œ±-dihydronandrolone, 5Œ±-dihydronormethandrone, 5Œ±-dihydronorethandrolone, 5Œ±-dihydronorethisterone, and 5Œ±-dihydrolevonorgestrel, as well as 19-norandrosterone and 19-noretiocholanolone. Derivatives The steroidal antiandrogen zanoterone (WIN-49596), which was investigated in the 1990s for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia but was never marketed, was derived from 5Œ±-DHET. In terms of chemical structure, it is 5Œ±-DHET with a pyrazole ring-containing moiety fused at the C2 and C3 positions. Synthesis A partial synthesis of 5Œ±-DHET from androstenedione has been published.Scaros, MG, Yonan, PK, Paul, K, Schulz, J; Park, FC (2001). \\"Novel preparation of 5Œ±-dihydroethisterone from androst-4-ene-3,17-dione\\".

It is part of larger inter- countries project Belgrade‚ÄìBar motorway. The motorway will connect Serbian capital of Belgrade with Montenegrin Capital of Podgorica and Bar, Montenegro's main seaport. Italy, Montenegro and Serbia are lobbying to list the route with Pan-European corridors, and it is frequently referred to as part of proposed Corridor XI, or 4B - an envisioned ferry/motorway corridor linking Bari, Bar, Belgrade and Bucharest. The road's construction began on May 11, 2015. Route description Motorway is to be built in three phases: * (Bar) ƒêurmani - Sozina tunnel - Virpazar - Bistrica - ≈†teke - ƒÜafa - Tolo≈°ko polje - (Podgorica) Smokovac - this is the southernmost section of the motorway, that will link the Montenegrin capital of Podgorica with the main Montenegrin seaport in Bar. Potential investors, such as EBRD and EIB, were suggesting that this section should be built first, as it will likely have the biggest traffic volume following completion. The planned length of this section is 51 km. * (Podgorica) Smokovac - Bioƒçe - Pelev Brijeg - Lijeva Rijeka - Veru≈°a - Mate≈°evo - this middle section of the motorway is considered a priority, because of its significance as a link between Podgorica and northern Montenegro. The current road link (E65 and E80), carved into the Moraƒça canyon, is a curvy mountainous road, considered dangerous during the winter, and is a bottleneck in Montenegrin road network. Thus, building this section first is a requirement in bidding documents presented by the Montenegrin Government. This section will have a length of 41 km, and is by far the most expensive section of the motorway, with a cost per kilometer of motorway estimated to be higher than 20 million EUR. As of 2015, this section is under construction. * Mate≈°evo - Andrijevica - Berane - Crnƒça - Boljare - Border with Serbia - this northernmost section of the motorway is likely to be completed only after progress is made on the Serbian section of the motorway south of Po≈æega. The planned length of this section is 73 km. History In October 2008 Ministry of Sustainable Development and Tourism made a proposal for Detailed Zoning Plan of Bar - Boljare Motorway. Before this, a small part of first section was already built. On July 13, 2005, Montenegro's national day, Sozina tunnel was opened. Together with associated road north of the tunnel, it will eventually become a part of the motorway, after second parallel road and tunnel is built. Middle section of the motorway was made a priority by the Government of Montenegro, and it was decided that this section will be built first. Tender was invited for building of this section. The bidding offers were reviewed in March 2009, and the top bid came from the Croatian consortium, led by the company of Konstruktor. This was followed by signing of contract document, and announcing of the beginning of construction works in June 2009. The official construction works opening ceremony happened on October 15, 2009, in the village of Gornje Mrke north of Podgorica, attended by the then Prime Ministers of Montenegro (Milo ƒêukanoviƒá), Serbia (Mirko Cvetkoviƒá) and Croatia (Jadranka Kosor). However, the Croatian consortium failed to provide necessary bank guarantees in a timely manner, so the contract was cancelled eight months later. The second best rated bidder, a consortium of the Greek company Aktor and the Israeli company Shikun & Binui was called in for negotiations by the Government. After negotiations, it was agreed that Aktor/HCH consortium builds two southern sections of the motorway for a price of 1.575 billion euro. The third and the northernmost section, from Mate≈°evo to Boljare (border with Serbia), as well as the small strip across the Lake Skadar, were to be the subject of further negotiations. However, the Greek-Israeli consortium also failed to provide bank guarantees, so the negotiations between the consortium and the Government of Montenegro were ended in December 2010. The Government of Montenegro began to explore financing options for motorway construction, including negotiations with Chinese investors. The possibility of China Road and Bridge Group and China Poly Group Corporation building the road, with the financial backing of Exim Bank of China was explored. In January 2011, the Montenegrin Minister of Transportation has sent an official letter of invitation to the Poly Group. In April 2013 discussions were still under way between the Montenegrin government and Chinese parties and an offer of US$1bn of financing by EXIM bank and the selection of a preferred construction consortium was announced in July 2013. In December 2014 negotiations with Chinese partners have successfully concluded. In May 2015 works on first section in Montenegro, Smokovac-Uvaƒç- Mate≈°evo have started, expected to finish within 48 months.  Current status  As of June 2018, the only built part of the motorway is the Sozina tunnel and the associated road immediately north of it. Currently, this part stands as single carriageway with two lanes, with a second carriageway planned to be built. The section between Smokovac near Podgorica and Mate≈°evo near Kola≈°in is under construction, and it will be Montenegro's first full motorway section. Initially, the construction was expected to be finished in May 2019. Later this was revised, and now it is expected to be opened in September 2020. The pillars of the Moraƒçica bridge, the tallest bridge on the motorway, were finished in October 2017. Right tube of Klopot Tunnel the is first tunnel that was excavated on motorway on 25 August 2017. In 2017, tunnels Jabuƒçki Kr≈° (1370 m and 1430 m), Mrke (829 m and 800 m) and Vilac (815 m and 950 m) were also excavated. In 2018, tunnels Mrki Kr≈° (700 m each tube), Mala Trava (1900 m and 1884 m), Suka (600 m each tube) and Ve≈æe≈°nik (2474 m and 2414 m) were excavated. Longest tunnel in middle section of motorway, Vjeternik Tunnel (3039 m and 2852 m) was excavated on 9 July 2018.

Migration Code, Law on Citizenship, Law on Immigration are the foundations of migration policy in Azerbaijan. An independent migration office - State Migration Service was established on March 19, 2007 to regulate fast-paced migrant and prepare comprehensive and efficient migration policies.  Background  After gaining independence in 1991, Azerbaijan faced with the significant wave of emigration of its citizens abroad because of the hardships the country was hit by, such as unstable political situation, economic slowdown and internal movement of refugees and IDPs due to Nagorno Karabakh conflict. As years passed, increasing role of the country as a transit country, economic development and implementation of large-scale projects in the fields of energy and transport enabled Azerbaijan to attract growing number of immigrants. Azerbaijan confronted with many-sided problems in the migration processes, therefore a number of actions have been carried out in this field to handle them. Adopting Stated Migration Policy Concept, approving State Migration Program for 2006-2008, establishing State Migration Service were among those actions. Moreover, a Task Force composed of representatives of public bodies was formed to work on the introduction of bio-metric identification. State Program on Bio-metric Identification in the Republic of Azerbaijan was compiled on their recommendations and approved by Ilham Aliyev on February 13, 2007. The Law on National Identity Card of the Republic of Azerbaijan was amended in December 2011 to provide identity cards carry electronic chips containing personal information. Azerbaijan joined he UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families and Palermo Protocols related to trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants. Decree on the development of migration management system dated 5 August 2008, Order on Integrated Migration Information System dated 6 February 2009, implementation of ‚ÄúSingle Window‚Äù system on State Migration Service‚Äôs activities starting from 4 March 2009, issuing law-enforcement body status to State Migration Service on 8 April 2009 are among the core activities to improve migration management system.  State Migration Concept  State Migration Management Policy Concept of the Republic of Azerbaijan was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on 13 July 2004 taking into account the necessity of defining state policy on migration issues for the preparation of the State Migration Program. The concept contains 4 sections: in addition to general provisions and migration related situation in Azerbaijan, these include goals, principles and objectives of migration policy, as well as the mechanism for implementation of Azerbaijan‚Äôs state migration policy. The main directions for Azerbaijan‚Äôs state migration policy are: ensuring control over migration processes in Azerbaijan and preventing illegal migration; stimulating Azerbaijani compatriots living abroad to resettle in Azerbaijan and facilitating the return of emigrants, as well as promoting the immigration of qualified specialists and other foreign workers needed on the Azerbaijani labour market; and simplifying entry and residence in Azerbaijan for foreign citizens doing business in Azerbaijan. The main mechanisms for implementing the concept are: improving the legislation of the Republic of Azerbaijan on migration; advancing the migration management system and coordinating the activities of migration management bodies; establishing unified state information system on migration issues; developing cooperation with international organizations and relevant government agencies of foreign countries to regulate migration processes.  State Migration Program  The State Migration Policy Concept of Azerbaijan was followed by the State Migration Program of the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2006-2008. The Program was approved by the President of Azerbaijan on 25 July 2006. This Program was set up to implement required actions in order to achieve the objectives mentioned in the Migration Policy Concept. The Program contains 3 sections - general information and characteristics of migration related processes of Azerbaijan, main directions of state migration policy of Azerbaijan and international cooperation in this area. In addition, measures to be implemented within the framework of the State Migration Program are also defined. According to the Program, the main purpose of state migration policy of Azerbaijan is to regulate migration flows while ensuring national security and interests of Azerbaijani Republic and prevent negative consequences of uncontrolled migration processes. The main objectives of migration policy of Azerbaijan are defined in the Program as efficient use of migration processes for the country‚Äôs development; implementation of state programs and measures related to migration in comply with the interests of society and people; prevention of illegal migration; establishing necessary condition to accelerate adaptation process of migrants to existing socioeconomic situation; protection of rights of migrants. Implementation of the state migration policy implies the activities of the relevant state bodies in the following main directions within the framework of this State Program: * improving the migration management mechanism; * establishing legal basis for identification of mutual rights and obligations of migrants and the state; * increasing the effectiveness of state regulation of migration, * announcing quotas for receiving immigrants, taking into account the needs of the domestic labor market; * taking relevant measures to eliminate negative cases in relevant state bodies dealing with migration issues; * implementation of complex measures to prevent illegal migration; * cooperation with foreign countries' migration services and international organizations for the solution of migration related problems.  Government agencies responsible for migration processes  However State Migration Service is fully responsible for migration processes, other state bodies - Ministry of National Security, Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA), Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), State Border Service, Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Population, State Committee on Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons ‚Äì also handles migration related issues in the framework of their activities. New department related to migration service - Chief Passport and Registration and Migration Department - inside the Ministry of Internal Affairs was established by the Presidential Decree on June 29, 2005, which came into force on May 16, 2006. It is a detached structural fraction within MIA and registers nationals of Azerbaijan or other states, and stateless persons, issues identity documents to foreign citizens, as well as national passports to Azerbaijani citizens, and conducts immigration matters within the MIA‚Äôs authorities.  State Migration Service  In order to fulfill state policy on migration, improve the management system of migration processes, and coordinate activities of different state bodies on migration processes, State Migration Service of the Republic of Azerbaijan was formed on March 19, 2007 according to the Decree issued by the President of Azerbaijan. State Migration Service deals with citizenship applications, Issuing permits for foreigners and stateless persons to live temporarily in Azerbaijan, prolonging temporary residence permit of foreigners and stateless persons, conferring immigrant or refugee status to foreigners.

The main partner of Azerbaijan for cooperation on migration issues is the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Azerbaijan received different kinds of assistance from IOM since 1996 and became the member of IOM in 2001. Azerbaijan also cooperates with the European Union and OSCE on migration activities. In the framework of European Neighborhood Policy, Action Plan was adopted between Azerbaijan and EU in November 2006. The Action Plan covers various matters like border management, asylum issues, migration management, prevention of illegal migration, readmission dialogue, reintegration of returned migrants, and simplification of visa procedures.  Legal framework  Legislation concerning migration includes the Constitution, international treaties Azerbaijan is a party to, national laws and other legal acts. The Constitution provides equal rights for foreigners to fulfill the same duties as Azerbaijani citizens, unless otherwise provided by law or international agreements that have been ratified by Azerbaijan. Legal acts adopted to manage migration processes in Azerbaijan include: * Law on entry, exit and passports (14 June 1994); * Law on the state border of the Republic of Azerbaijan; * Law on the identity card of citizens of the Republic of Azerbaijan (14 June 1994); * Law on the legal status of foreigners and stateless persons (March 13, 1996); * Law on registration based on residence and actual address (4 April 1996); * Law on the citizenship of the Republic of Azerbaijan (September 30, 1998); * Law on Immigration (22 December 1998); * Law on labor migration; * 1999 Law On the Legal Status of Refugees and Displaced Persons; * 2002 Law On State Policy Concerning Citizens Residing Abroad (amended in 2003).

The company is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM); its low visibility in the minds of end consumers can be attributed to the OEM nature of all its operations. Liebherr-Aerospace contributed ‚Ç¨1.3 billion ($1.5bn) to total Liebherr group sales of ‚Ç¨9 billion in 2016. This represented an increase of nearly 5% in turnover for the division. The division was reported to be employing around 5400 people all over the world. It has two primary production and assembly centres: Liebherr Aerospace Toulouse and Liebherr Aerospace Lindenberg. Some of the other sites include: Liebherr Aerospace Saline, Michigan, U.S.A, Liebherr Aerospace Singapore, Liebherr Aerospace Dubai, U.A.E, Liebherr Aerospace Laval, Canada, Liebherr Aerospace Maintenance centre, Shanghai, Liebherr Aerospace, Bangalore, India, Liebherr Aerospace Toulouse, Campsas site. The Lindenberg and Toulouse centres of Liebherr have been recognized by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) as a Design Organization Approval (DOA) certified company. This certification encompasses: landing gear systems, air management systems, and flight control actuation systems.  Production and other activities  Liebherr Aerospace supplies aircraft flight control and actuation systems, landing gear, air management systems(bleed air systems, wing anti ice, etc.), on-board electronics as well as gears and gearboxes for the aerospace industry. These systems are deployed in wide-bodied aircraft, single aisle and regional aircraft, business jets, combat aircraft, military transport aircraft, military training aircraft, civil helicopters and combat helicopters. Being in Toulouse, Liebherr Aerospace benefits from being in close proximity to the base of operations of one of their most important customers, Airbus. Apart from manufacturing activities Liebherr Aerospace also services and overhauls in-service components for their customers (Airlines etc.). It also provides training courses for mechanics, engineers and other relevant personnel who work with any Aircraft which carries Liebherr products.  USM ‚Äì Used Serviceable Materials  On 16 July 2018, it was reported that Liebherr Aerospace was expanding its services in a new direction by setting up a global network for USM parts to be managed from their Dubai offices. They plan to source own products and systems from retired aircraft, perform repairs if necessary and redistribute and sell through their network. The serviced parts will be released with appropriate airworthiness certifications and will come with a \\"Repaired by Liebherr\\" tag instead of a \\"New\\" tag. It is reported that their initial focus will be on Airbus fleets and families with a subsequent expansion. The target Customers are those with mature fleets, who will be requiring OEM quality parts at lower operation costs.  Research and development  The firm was reported to have invested in 2017 about ‚Ç¨70 million ($82m) in R&D;: more than 17% of revenue.  B777X Wingtips  One of the most recent developments is the design of folding wingtips which are being implemented on the Boeing 777X. Due to its much larger wingspan the 777X could not be classified in the same category as the B777. With the folding wingtips 777X will still be in the same wingspan category as the B777. For take-off, the wing tips will be unfolded back into the horizontal position, providing the benefit of an extended span to increase fuel efficiency. The folding wing tip system is the first of its kind in commercial aviation.  3D Printing and Fuel Cells  The firm uses 3D printing technology to manufacture some of their products. . The firm has also invested in developing tools and parts of their products using titanium because of the benefits it offers. The firm is working on developing fuel cells along with their partners General Motors. Liebherr is interested in the use of fuel cells to replace APU's (auxiliary power unit) on conventional aircraft, greatly reducing emissions. GM on the other hand is aiming to develop a primary source of energy for electric cars.  Hyperloop  Liebherr Aerospace partnered with TransPod for the research, development, and production of new cabin and vehicle thermal systems designed specifically for TransPod‚Äôs hyperloop system to ensure safety, efficiency, and passenger comfort. alt=  Presence at recent events  Liebherr-Aerospace is among the exhibitors at ILA Berlin Air Show . and was present in the latest edition of the Farnborough Air Show as well.  Incidents  On 18 July 2018, an explosion was reported at Liebherr Aerospace's, Toulouse site. According to news reports, a valve on a high pressure air circulation system on the shop floor failed due to undetermined reasons. According to one of the reports, the explosion of the high pressure air lines was heard kilometres away. The accident took place during work hours, around 2 PM. The pressure of the high pressure line has been reported to be around 25 Bars, which is 25 times the normal atmospheric pressure. News agencies report that 39 employees were treated on site by emergency services and the in-house medical teams. Around 12 employees who were in immediate vicinity were affected and had respiratory and hearing problems, Three of them were hospitalised at the Toulouse Purpan Hospital.200px  Customers  The direct customers for Liebherr Aerospace are the air frame manufacturers as listed below, but end customers like Airlines also deal directly with Liebherr Aerospace for maintenance and troubleshooting. * Airbus * Airbus Helicopters * Airbus Defense * Bombardier * ATR * Embraer * Boeing Air conditioning pack of Comac C919 by Liebherr Aerospace * COMAC * Dassault Aviation * Augusta Westland * Irkut Corporation * Antonov * Sukhoi  References  Category:Aerospace companies of France Category:Aerospace companies of Germany Category:Companies based in Toulouse ","title":"Liebherr Aerospace"},{"id":"57777493","text":"Ghost Guns is a 1944 American western film directed by Lambert Hillyer.Martin p.168 This is the thirteenth film in the \\"Marshal Nevada Jack McKenzie\\" series, and stars Johnny Mack Brown as Jack McKenzie and Raymond Hatton as his sidekick Sandy Hopkins, with Evelyn Finley, Riley Hill and Ernie Adams.

It is the site of Huizhou Taoist Association. It is hailed as one of \\"Three Largest Taoist Temples\\" alongside Sanyuan Palace and Chongxu Temple (). History Yuanmiao Temple was originally built in 633, under the Tang dynasty (618-907). It was renamed \\"Chaoyuan Temple\\" () and later \\"Kaiyuan Temple\\" () after enlarging in 748. The temple was restored in 1296 in the reign of Tem√ºr Khan in the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). The temple was destroyed and rebuilt many times in the following Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). In 1942, the Hall of Three Purities, Hall of Jade Emperor and wing hall were completely destroyed during the Japanese invasion of the Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1966, Mao Zedong launched the ten-year Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards had attacked the temple, almost all of the scriptures, historical documents, and other works of art were either removed, damaged or destroyed in the massive socialist movement. After the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the policy of religious freedom was implemented. The temple was renovated and refurbished in 1982. That same year, it was officially reopened to the public. Under the support of locals, the Hall of Jade Emperor and Hall of Three Purities were added to the temple in 1989. Yuanmiao Temple was designated as a municipal-level cultural preservation unit in 1990. Architecture Now the existing main buildings include the Hall of Jade Emperor, Hall of Three Purities, Hall of Guanyin, Hall of Lord Guan, Bell tower, Drum tower, and Hall of Bao Zheng.

(Original description) The shell is moderately large and narrow-elongate. The spire is many-whorled and longer than the aperture and the siphonal canal. The whorls are nodulosely costate, with a rather well marked subsutural concavity. The sinus in this region is well-defined, moderately broad and deep. The siphonal canal is rather short and straight. The apical angle is about twenty- five degrees. The embryonic whorls of the holotype are unfortunately missing. The spire consists of about eight convex whorls with the greatest convexity about the middle of each whorl. The posterior third of each whorl is rather deeply concave immediately under the suture, which gives the appearance to this part of the shell of rather a strong overlap of the whorls, anterior two- thirds convex, most marked at the ribs. The aperture is oval, somewhat contracted posteriorly, and gradually drawn out anteriorly into a short, slightly curved and open siphonal canal, which is about the same length as the aperture. The outer lip is thin and slightly crenulated at the outer edge with a very distinct, broad and deep sinus just below the rather prominent subsutural band and situated in the concave posterior third. The sinus is about half as deep again as broad, thence the outer lip projects prominently forward, then gently arched to join the anterior canal. The columella is simple, slightly bent and tapering. The posterior whorls are ornamented with slightly oblique ribs, developed in the anterior two-thirds of the whorls and extending right up, though gradually fading, to the anterior suture, thus leaving the posterior third practically free from costulate elevations. On the anterior whorls the ribs fade sooner towards the anterior suture, though strongly elevated and prominent medially, giving rise to the appearance rather of a medial band of nodules or tubercles than to fully developed ribs. The ribs or tubercles number about nine to a whorl. Spiral ornament consists of four or five strong spiral threads in the anterior two thirds of each whorl, while the body whorl shows about eight or nine, and one strong thread just adjacent to the posterior suture, making rather a prominent and characteristic subsutural band. On the posterior whorls the anterior group of threads are comparatively broad, with narrower grooves between, but anteriorly the grooves widen out till on the penultimate whorl the grooves or interspaces are broader than the threads, and become still more distinctly so on the body whorl. As the grooves widen out much finer spiral threads become visible in this space, the interspaces on the body whorl showing three of these finer intercalated threads. In the concave space between the subsutural band and the threads of the anterior portion of the whorl, which is occupied by the growth lines of the sinus, there are two or three fine spiral threads, with still finer threads, just visible under a lens, on either side of them. The ribs and spiral ornament are both traversed by fine and close lines of growth, which by their marked sinuation and forward curvature clearly indicate the nature and position of the shell.Pritchard, G.

During the 1860s he served, by some definitions, as the final Foreign minister of the Grand Duchy of Baden.  Life   Provenance, early years and 1848  Franz Freiherr von Roggenbach was born in Mannheim. He came from an ancient family of Catholic nobility. His father, Baron Heinrich von Roggenbach (1787‚Äì1870), was a career soldier. His mother, the Countess Melanie von Walderdorff (1795-1868), also came from a prominent ancient family. He concluded his school years at the Mannheim Lyceum (secondary school) in September 1843. At university, he became a member of the Heidelberg Burschenschaft (student fraternity) shortly after arriving, in 1843. He studied Jurisprudence under various distinguished teachers such as the historian Friedrich Christoph Schlosser, the historian-politicians Georg Gottfried Gervinus and Ludwig H√§usser, along with the jurist - and a particularly influential mentor - Robert von Mohl. In Autumn 1845 he moved away, for a year, to study in Berlin where his lecturers included Friedrich Julius Stahl. One of the friends he made during this time was the young law student Julius Jolly, a future political colleague. After passing his state law exams in February 1848 he moved to his parents' house at Freiburg, intending to deepen his education in history and education, and to \\"come to an understanding of his times and their needs\\" (\\"zum Verst√§ndnis seiner Zeit und ihrer Beduerfnisse zu gelangen\\") The revolutionary outburst in March of that year may have provided clues, and he moved to Frankfurt which had quickly become the focus of many of the important political developments of 1848. During 1848/49 he served briefly as a volunteer secretary in the Foreign Ministry of the short-lived Provisional Central Government (\\"Provisorische Zentralgewalt\\") established by the liberal-nationalist \\"revolutionaries\\" of the Frankfurt Parliament. Roggenbach resigned his post, however, after the King of Prussia refused the Frankfurt Parliament's \\"offer\\" of the \\"crown of Germany\\" in April 1849. During the middle part of 1849 Roggenbach stayed for several months in Berlin before returning west. From 1849 till 1851 he served the Grand Duchy as a young diplomat at its mission in Bonn, which by this time was becoming an important administrative centre in the Kingdom of Prussia's Rhine Province. In Bonn he came to know the influential writers Prof. Ernst Moritz Arndt and Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann. In April 1851 he resigned from his diplomatic post and undertook a lengthy \\"study tour\\" of France and England, during which he took the opportunity to network with diplomats, members of the nobility and of the political elites in those countries.  Power and politics  Roggenbach was a near-contemporary and close friend of Frederick I, who became Grand Duke of Baden in 1858 but had been regent since 1852 due to his elder brother's mental illness. Roggenbach and Frederick were closely aligned politically, both being believers in constitutional liberalism, as it was understood at the time. Politics in the Grand Duchy during the 1850s were increasingly preoccupied with the Baden Kulturkampf (loosely \\"...culture wars), a church-state power struggle. At issue were such matters as control over church assets and appointments. Church-state rivalry was inherent in the power structures across and beyond the Holy Roman empire, and English language sources tend to focus on the larger Prussian \\"Kulturkampf\\" of the 1870s. One reason that the issues became particularly heated in Baden two decades earlier seems to have been the attitude of the leading bishops in the Upper Rhine region, rejecting the state's insistence on a right of veto over church appointments and demanding that clergy should be educated in their own ecclesiastical places of learning rather than in the universities. From the wings, the governments in Berlin and Vienna looked on and quietly exerted their influence, with the Prussian government generally backing the more secularist position of the Baden government in Karlsruhe, and pressure from the conservative Austrians, reflecting a long-standing community of interests with the Roman Curia, more sympathetic to the idea of compromise with the churchmens' demands. In 1854 a so-called \\"Interim\\" (agreement) was concluded between the government of Baden and the church. A more comprehensive \\"Convention\\" was negotiated for ratification in 1859. Roggenbach had been sent to Berlin in February/March 1859 in order to report back to the Grand Duke, on the mood and attitudes of the government in Berlin, where the focus of attention was on the pan-European implications of Austria's war in Italy rather than on church-state rivalry in Baden. During the summer of 1859 Roggenbach removed himself to the Island of Mainau. His purpose was to draw up plans for a new kind of state structure. In Autumn 1859 he presented his remarkably wide-ranging and detailed \\"Bundesreformplan\\" to the Grand Duke, outlining the possible structure of a future united German state. Roggenbach was by now a trusted advisor to the Grand Duke, and it was with the uncompromising backing of Roggenbach that the Grand Duke refused to sign the \\"Convention\\", declaring it to be unconstitutional. In a memorandum dated 6 December 1859 Roggenbach had stated baldly \\"This convention is impossible\\" (\\"Diese Konvention ist unmoeglich\\"). Roggenbach was a practicing catholic believer, but in matters of church-state relations, as in his political world- view more generally, his liberal instincts would always prevail. In rejecting the convention, the Grand Duke was opposing a convention negotiated by his own government, but his attitude nevertheless enjoyed support from a majority in the second chamber of the national assembly (\\"parliament\\"), which was dominated by liberals who would have seen the church as a reactionary force. After losing the parliamentary vote on the convention in March 1860 the Stengel government was out of power. That led to the installation of a new government under Minister President Anton von Stabel, which enjoyed overwhelming support in the parliament. Without further drama, but in line with the Grand Duke's belief in constitutional monarchy, what now emerged is identified in sources as one of the first examples in the Holy Roman empire of a system of \\"parliamentary monarchy\\". Roggenbach was initially reluctant to become a member of the new Stabel government, but he did so, formally on 2 May 1961, his formal area of responsibility covering foreign affairs and relations with the Royal House. He was one of two or three leading figures in the government. With respect to the German Question he had a clear vision for the future of the Grand Duchy. With his friend Julius Jolly he advocated German unification according to a \\"Small Germany\\" model that would exclude Austria- Hungary, and which accordingly would operate under liberal Prussian leadership. Unsurprisingly, this was also the model favoured by the Grand Duke himself. In 1863, following the retirement of Gideon Weizel, the trade- commerce portfolio was added to Roggenbach's portfolio of ministerial responsibilities. In July 1861 the Prussian king undertook a visit to the health resort at Baden-Baden and Franz Roggenbach took the opportunity to present his \\"Bundesreformplan\\" to the Prussian king. The plan appears to have been reviewed and in broad terms endorsed by key members of the Prussian government. The reactions of Prussia's recently appointed ambassador to the Russian empire, Otto von Bismarck was necessarily a written reaction, and it was positive with regard to the idea of a German state extending to the Swiss frontier and excluding Austria, although for some of Roggenbach's more detailed thoughts on the structures of a future Germany state, Bismarck's endorsement was notably more nuanced. Nevertheless, the new Prussian king was at this point widely celebrated as a champion of liberal causes, and it was easy to infer that in most important respects the ideas of the government in Karlsruhe - Roggenbach's ideas - were aligned with those of the Prussian government. In 1862, however, the Prussian king appointed Otto von Bismarck as his chief minister. In a letter he wrote to Robert von Mohl in October 1862 Roggenbach described Bismarck as an unprincipled Junker (\\"...f√ºr einen grundsa√ülosen Junker\\"), a chancer (\\"...f√ºr einen waghalsigen Spieler\\") and a person without conscience (\\"...f√ºr einen gewissenlosen Mensch\\") interested only in maintaining his own power. It may have been an ungenerous assessment, but in it Roggenbach correctly acknowledged that with Bismarck in place, Prussia might still champion Prussian leadership for a united Germany, but she could no longer be regarded as a champion of liberal ideals. in the aftermath of the Schleswig-Holstein crisis Roggenbach resigned his ministerial offices suddenly in 1865. The resignation was attributed to \\"constitutional differences\\". When a new government was appointed in July 1866 Franz von Roggenbach was not a member of it.  Parliamentarian  Franz von Roggenbach made his home at Schloss Ehner-Fahrnau, a small country estate that he had inherited from his father on the edge of Schopfheim. Between 1861 and 1866 he held a seat in the second chamber of the national assembly (\\"Badische St√§ndeversammlung\\"), representing Schopfheim and the adjacent settlement of Kandern (\\"Wahlbezirk der √Ñmter Schopfheim und Kandern\\"), giving up his seat after the Austro-Prussian War. Between 1868 and 1870 he sat as a member of the Zollparlament, which represented the German states that were members of the newly reconstituted customs union (\\"Zollverein\\"). He sat as one the many members of the National Liberal group. The voting districts were larger than for the \\"Badische St√§ndeversammlung\\", but he represented, as before, an electoral district in the extreme southwest of the country, incorporating now the towns of L√∂rrach, M√ºllheim and Staufen. After the Franco-Prussian War and the Treaty of Frankfurt which set the seal on Bismarck's unification project, Roggenbach sat as a member of the new German parliament (Reichstag) between 1871 and 1873, representing (broadly as before) the L√∂rrach-M√ºllheim electoral district (Wahlkreis Baden 4 - L√∂rrach-M√ºllheim-Staufen-Breisach). He was at this point a member of the short-lived Imperial Liberal Party (\\"Liberale Reichspartei\\").  \\"Statesman without a state\\"  Franz von Roggenbach was a prolific letter writer, especially after he dropped out of front-line politics. He remained politicvally and personally close to Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden (1826-1907). He also maintained good relations with the Prussian Queen (later \\"Empress\\") Augusta, whom he supplied with length memoranda, \\"prepared with the expertise and authority of an experienced German diplomat and minister\\". For more than ten years he also provided his services as a political consultant to the empress's son, Crown Prince Frederick and his English-born wife. Roggenbach never made any serious effort to conceal his loathing for Bismarck, and the German chancellor viewed Roggenbach, understandably, as a constant focus for liberal intrigue among well-placed members of the political establishment and royal households. In addition, operated as a political consultant to Empress Augusta's friend, Admiral Albrecht von Stosch, a member of the Crown Prince's inner circle who was seen, for some time, as a credible political rival to Bismarck.  Stra√üburg University  Stra√üburg University had been destroyed by the \\"Terror\\" during the 1790s and then cautiously replaced by various low-profile teaching institutions appropriate to the times under the French First Republic before being relaunched by Napoleon in 1806 as a francophone university. After 1871, with Elsa√ü back under German control for the first time since 1790, demands arose for the re-establishment of a proper German university in Stra√üburg. On 24 May 1871 those demands crystallised in a resolution of the German Reichstag. It was evidently Chancellor Bismarck himself who identified this as a project that might usefully occupy Roggenbach's energies. Roggenbach was appointed to head up a commission charged with re-founding the German University at Stra√üburg, and he applied himself to the matter with characteristic energy. An early decision involved appointing Friedrich Heinrich Geffcken, widely seen as a political victim of the chancellor's vindictive character, to a professorship of constitutional studies and public law. The German University at Strasbourg was inaugurated on 1/2 May 1872 and Roggenbach's role as project \\"curator\\" was at an end. His ambitious plans were soon scaled back by the government following disputes about funding, but sources indicate that there was nevertheless much reason to celebrate his contribution to the project.  Personal  Franz von Roggenbach died as a result of Pneumonia on 24 May 1907. He continued to correspond with friends throughout the later decades of his life, and there is some sense of regret towards the end that he had not been able to influence events more strongly in support of the traditional liberalist positions that he favoured.

(Original description) The shell is of small to medium size, somewhat narrow elongate fusiform. The aperture and the siphonal canal have about the same length as the spire. The spire is acute, made up of a rather small embryonic portion, succeeded by numerous, gradually increasing, convex, and more or less strongly costated whorls. The apical angle is about twenty-five to thirty degrees. The protoconch is rather small, consisting of about smooth convex whorls. The spire consistis of seven or eight regularly convex whorls, with their greatest convexity about the middle of each whorl, and with a well-impressed suture.. The aperture is oval. The outer lip is rather thin and smooth internally, with a well-defined broad but comparatively shallow sinus just below the suture. From the sinus the lip projects slightly forward with a regular convex arch, then curving downwards to join the anterior canal. The sinuses about one to one-and-a-half millimetre broad, but usually only about half this measurement in depth. At the anterior end the aperture opens into a long, straight, slender and open siphonal canal, which is much longer than the aperture. The inner lip shows a thin enamel coating. The columella is simple and smooth, straight, slender, and gently tapering to the anterior end. The surface is ornamented with oblique ribs, which are most highly elevated about the middle of each whorl, and fade off more rapidly towards the posterior suture than the anterior. The ribs number usually nine to a whorl, an occasional example shows as many as eleven or twelve on the body whorl. The strength of development of the ribs is somewhat variable, especially on the anterior whorls, where they are occasionally only just visible. The ribs are traversed by comparatively coarse and fine spiral threads. Of these there are four to six coarser and more prominent than the rest, situated in the anterior two-thirds of each whorl, especially prominent where they cross the ribs, more numerous, amounting to about eight or nine, on the body whorl, with much broader interspaces between each of which has a medial finer thread with a pair of still tinier threads on either side of it. The posterior third is occupied by from about ten to fifteen very fine spiral threadlets, also the fine lines of growth of the sinus are in this space. Both ribs and spiral threads are traversed by the fine oblique forwardly directed lines of growth.Pritchard, G.

It received development approval from the government of South Australia in June 2018 and was expected to start construction early in 2019. The company developing it is based at the University of Adelaide's venture incubator, ThincLab. The project has the support of the Ngadjuri people and the Regional Council of Goyder. Stage 1 is proposed to include 200 MW of solar photovoltaic electricity generation and a 120 MW¬∑h lithium ion battery system and was proposed to start construction early in 2019, generating its first generation before the end of the same year. Stage 2 is proposed to provide another 200 MW of generation and a 150 MW¬∑h battery. Stage 1 will consist of one hundred single-axis tracker arrays each generating 2 MW and approximately for a total area of . The land is north of Goyder's Line and north of the Goyder Highway on crown land unsuitable for cropping due to the low rainfall. Downer Group was engaged in January 2019 for early contractor involvement, with construction expected to commence in July 2019 and stage 1 to take two years to build. The project had provision for three more stages, depending on market and network conditions. In July, the project's website said that construction would start in Q4 2019. By November 2019, this had slipped to Q1 2020. Alinta Energy has committed to buy 75% of the solar farm's output for 15 years. The grid-connected battery will be supplied by GE Renewable Energy.

It was one of the first modern howitzers equipped with a recoil system. History Development of the _mod√®le 1890_ began in 1886 at the Atelier-de-pr√©cision in Paris, following a request by the French Army for a mobile howitzer capable of high angle fire. Adopted in 1890, it was assigned to heavy field artillery regiments (artillerie lourde de campagne) and to artillery regiments (r√©giments d'artillerie √† pied) of the S√©r√© de Rivi√®res fortress system. The _mod√®le_ is mentioned in the documents of the so-called Dreyfus Affair, in which artillery captain Alfred Dreyfus was accused of disclosing (or wanting to disclose) the howitzer's technical data. Design The _mod√®le 1890_ was a transitional piece and was a combination of both old and new ideas. It was a breech loaded howitzer with a steel barrel and a de Bange obturator designed by Colonel Charles Ragon de Bange which used separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. The steel box trail carriage had two wooden spoked wheels with steel rims and was designed to be light enough to be horse-drawn in one piece. The carriage was split into two parts, a stationary lower part which supported the weapon and a sliding upper part which supported the gun barrel. The upper part was L shaped and the gun barrel was inserted into a cradle with a hydro-pneumatic recoil system below the barrel which connected to the lower portion of the carriage. The cradle and carriage had a hollow center section to allow for high angles of elevation, while the front of the cradle pivoted to allow limited traverse. When the gun fired the cradle recoiled backwards, while the lower part stayed anchored. This recoil system was also used by the more powerful Obusier de 155 mm C mod√®le 1890, which mounted the gun barrel of the Obusier de 155 mm C mod√®le 1881 on the same style of carriage. The recoil mechanism was not enough to absorb the barrels recoil forces and this made the piece unstable at firing. This style of carriage and recoil system did not find wider acceptance due to its insufficient performance. First world war Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Fortresses, armories, coastal fortifications, and museums were scoured for heavy artillery and sent to the front. Suitable field and rail carriages were built for these guns in an effort to give their forces the heavy field artillery needed to overcome trenches and hardened concrete fortifications. In August 1914 the heavy field artillery regiments (artillerie lourde de campagne) were equipped with 5 regiments of _mod√®le 1890_ 's, with 3 batteries per regiment, and 6 howitzers per battery for a total of 90 howitzers. Each regiment was provided with 400 rounds of ammunition and the available ammunition supply was 1,280,000 rounds. The _mod√®le 1890_ 's were used until they either wore out or were destroyed.

In 1662, Qing dynasty (1644-1911) Kangxi Emperor ascended the throne, due to the social taboo of \\"Xuan\\" (\\"Xuan\\" is the name of Kangxi Emperor), its name was changed into \\"Yuanmiao Temple\\" (). In 1407, in the early Ming dynasty (1368-1644), Taoist priest Fang Rudiao () and Bu Zhisheng () repaired the Hall of Jade Emperor. In 1564, Magistrate Yi Daotan () restored the Shanmen. In 1582, Hall of Three Purities, Hall of Dongyue, Hall of Wenchang and Hall of Zhenwu were gradually renovated and refurbished by Lin Zhao'en (). Yuanmiao Temple underwent three renovations in the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), respectively in the ruling of Jiaqing Emperor (1797), in the reign of Xianfeng Emperor (1851-1861) and in the Gaungxu era (1875-1908). During the Republic of China, the temple was used as barracks for the Nationalists. After the establishment of the Communist State, the temple was used as campus for Putian No. 4 High School and Putian Normal College. In October 1956, the Ministry of Culture appropriated a large sum of money for reconstructing the Hall of Three Purities. In 1961, the Fujian Provincial Government inscribed it as a provincial level cultural heritage. Repairs were carried out in 1975 and again in 1986. In 1996, it was listed among the fourth batch of \\"Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Fujian\\" by the State Council of China.

Although the direct translation of Liangyou is \\"Good Companion\\", the magazine bore the English name The Young Companion on the cover. Called an \\"iconic magazine\\" and \\"a visual shortcut for 'old Shanghai'\\", the magazine has proven useful in modern times to examine the glamorous side of colonial-era Shanghai. It may have been the most influential large-scale comprehensive pictorial in the 1920s, at least in Asia. It ceased publication in 1945. There were 174 issues in total, which includes the two special issues not given monthly issue numbers, the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Special Issue and the Eighth Anniversary issue. Since 1945, it has been repeatedly reestablished, but the impact has not been the same. The magazine ran a mixture of content, including photography, art, literature and sports. History In 1925 Wu Liande founded the Liangyou Book Company. A year later the Liangyou pictorial magazine was produced, also known as The Young Companion, which was one among \\"a variety of pictorials\\" that the Liangyou Book Company produced. Wu Liande acted as the magazine's first editor-in-chief, but was unable to fully administer the post because of his need to attend to the larger business. After the 4th issue, he entrusted the editing to Zhou Shoujuan. Zhou did not stay long and left to study at Qilu University. In March 1927 Liang Desuo took over editing of The Young Companion as its third editor-in-chief. Within two years, the monthly pictorial sales reached more than 30,000 copies, selling globally. Liang Desuo stayed for six years as the chief editor before leaving The Young Companion in July 1933 being replaced by Ma Guoliang. In March 1930, it was changed to photogravure printing, and the quality was greatly improved. In August of this year, the 50th edition was increased to 42 pages with 3 pages of multicolored pages. January to March 1938, he relocated to Hong Kong due to the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. The magazine was suspended in Hong Kong during bankruptcy of the parent Liangyou Book Company, after a run of 138 issues. The new company that owned the magazine was the Liangyou Fuxing Book Company, who restarted The Young Companion in February 1939 in Shanghai under editor-in- chief Zhang Yuanheng (ÂºµÊ≤ÖÊÅí). It ran until December 1941, when the 171st issue was published. The war interfered with further publishing. Even though the Japanese had taken over the parent company Liangyou Fuxing Book Company, and Chinese owners cooperating reopened the company in April 1942, The Young Companion's editor Zhang Yuanheng would not work with them. After the war in October 1945, he published the next and final (172nd) under the name Liangyou Picture Magazine. The Liangyou Fuxing Book Company was closed after the war \\"in 1946, due to the guilt of shareholders.\\" Hong Kong Revival In 1954 Wu Liande restarted his company in Hong Kong, and \\"re-released the overseas version of \\"Liangyou,\\" ceasing publication in 1968. In 1984, Wu Fude, son of Wu Liande restarted the Liangyou Book Company, including the \\"Liangyou\\" pictorial. However, the magazine did not become as influential as its previous incarnation in Shanghai. Gallery The modern girl's dilemma, being pretty versus being active  The magazine was known for its cover-girls, beautiful women who appeared to be active, \\"modern girls in motion.\\" The motion was really performed by the girls inside the magazine playing sports, while the cover-girls presented modern women, attractive to men in their non- traditional western clothes and implied activities. The women were modern girls, appearing to not be dressed up looking for men, but living their lives and doing what they enjoyed doing. The modern girls of Shanghai appeared in the city's artwork, including magazines such as The Young Companion and Ling Long, but also in the advertisements of the city and calendars. They were shown as actively living their lives, \\"driving motorcycles, swimming, horse riding, horse racing, rowing competitions, and participating in social assistance.\\" The term modern girl normally applies to Japanese women of the time, but \\"the image of modern Chinese women became incorporated into that of the 'Modern Girl' in Japan.\\" Guan Zilan, Liangyou-cover-girl for issue 45, who was a Chinese student and artist who went to Japan to study, was labeled modern girl in this fashion. Modern scholar Maura Elizabeth Cunningham points out that in spite of the idea of the independence of the modern girl circulating in the period, the magazine showed women how women's sports could be used to satisfy the male gaze and give examples of a \\"model of femininity for female viewers to reproduce.\\" She also pointed out that the magazine showed progress, with pictures inside the magazine not only showing beauty, but also women actively doing sports, something unimaginable a generation earlier.

The ceremony was held at the Imperial Theatre in Saint John, New Brunswick on 2 October 2009 and was hosted by Se√°n Cullen. Canadian Comedy Awards, also known as Beavers, were awarded in 22 categories. Some winners were picked by members of industry organizations, while others were chosen by the Canadian public through an online poll. The awards ceremony was held during the four-day Canadian Comedy Awards Festival which showcased performances by over 100 comic artists. A Best of the Fest special was broadcast by The Comedy Network. The film Young People Fucking led with eight nominations followed by This Hour Has 22 Minutes with five. Young People Fucking won three Beavers, followed by Ron Sparks, The Jon Dore Television Show and Less Than Kind with two wins each. Festival and ceremony The 10th Canadian Comedy Awards and Festival ran from 1 to 4 October 2009 in Saint John, New Brunswick. The festival included numerous shows and workshops. The awards ceremony was held on 2 October 2009 at the Imperial Theatre, hosted by Se√°n Cullen. The Last Laugh Gala was held the following night at the same venue; both events were taped by sponsor The Comedy Network for later broadcast. Related events On 5 August 2009, two months before the festival, the show Canadian Comedy Award Nominees vs. Cancer was held at The Rivoli in Toronto, Ontario. The show was a pay-what-you-can fundraiser for the Canadian Cancer Society. The Canadian Comedy Awards 10th Anniversary Special was taped at Toronto's Masonic Temple in the fall of 2009. Samantha Bee and Jason Jones hosted the show, though when they had first agreed to do so they thought it was for the awards ceremony. Instead, it was a showcase of Beaver- winning comedians from the past decade. It was broadcast by The Comedy Network in May 2010. When the festival came to New Brunswick, James Mullinger and Lloyd Ravn stayed to build a comedy scene in the province. Seven years later Mullinger staged the show Every Comedian in New Brunswick featuring 42 local comics.

Described within an Australian and New Zealand genus of the rush- or bamboo-like Restionaceae family, it is the only species of Empodisma to be found in Western Australia. A perennial herb, growing to a height between 0.2 and 1.2 metres, found near winter wet ground and permanent waterways. The inflorescence is brown, appearing between July to December or January to February. The preferred soil type is grey to black sand and peat. The habit of the species is to cluster together, the leaves becoming an entangled barrier that inspired the Greek derivation of the genus and its common name of wire rush.

Incidents The Trail Mountain Fire began when the Trail Mountain Prescribed Burn escaped across Cottonwood Canyon Road to East Mountain on June 6, 2018, burning . By June 10, high wind gusts of 55 miles per hour caused the fire to grow into Meetinghouse Canyon. The heavy winds caused all air support fighting the fire to be grounded.

The fire had expanded north into Deer Creek Canyon, Rilda Canyon and the plateaus above Mill Fork Canyon, which all feed into Huntington Canyon. The next day, Highway 31 was closed and areas of Huntington Canyon were closed and select campgrounds were evacuated. On June 14, the highway and Huntington Canyon reopened. However, the next day, June 15, Highway 31 was closed once again due to fire activity and heavy use of the highway by fire crews. By the end of the day, the fire had grown to and was ten percent contained. Officials re-opened Highway 31 through Huntington Canyon on June 16. The fire had minimal activity due to high humidity and cloud cover. The northern part of the fire remained uncontained while crews focused on scattering cut vegetation, stabilizing soils, installing water bars to manage water and sediment, and removing hazardous, fire-weakened trees along roads in contained areas. By June 22, Red Flag Warnings impacted the fire, pushing it into Crandall Canyon and keeping it active in Little Bear Canyon. The fire did not impact the Crandall Canyon Mine and memorial.

The Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs officially titled the summit as the #HELSINKI2018 Meeting and it was hosted by the President of Finland Sauli Niinist√∂. During a post-summit joint press conference with Putin, Trump did not accept Russian interference was part of the 2016 U.S. elections. Trump's omissions provoked an uproar across the political spectrum, including from some of his usual allies. One day later, Trump amended part of his remarks, contending that he had misspoken due to an incorrectly perceived \\"double- negative\\". Although the proceedings of the summit were orderly and diplomatic, both Trump and Putin were received poorly by both sides of the political spectrum in America, with some commentators saying that the summit became the event where Putin \\"cemented his status, and the status of his country, as public enemy #1 in America,\\" ushering in the lowest point of Russian-American relations since the early 1980s.https://www.axios.com/trump-white-house- officials-embarrassed-putin-russia-2a8fb858-4913-4f14-a86f-9384edfa796d.html History President Vladimir Putin and NSC Advisor John R.

The U.S. National Security Advisor John R. Bolton met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on June 27, 2018, to discuss the details of the summit and other bilateral issues. On June 28, the location of the summit was announced by the White House and the Kremlin to be Helsinki. Background Presidential Palace in Helsinki, the venue of the summit The summit was officially called the #HELSINKI2018 Meeting by the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was hosted by the President of Finland Sauli Niinist√∂. The summit took place in the Presidential Palace and marked the first official meeting between the leaders after previous unofficial talks between Trump and Putin at the G20 Hamburg and APEC Vietnam summits held in 2017. Topics Trump announced to be discussed at the summit included the situations in Syria and Ukraine. The United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met his Russian and Finnish counterparts Sergey Lavrov and Timo Soini. Niinist√∂ held bilateral meetings with both presidents on the day of the summit. That morning, Niinist√∂ and Finnish First Lady Jenni Haukio welcomed Trump and U.S. First Lady Melania Trump at their main official residence in M√§ntyniemi. During the presidents' meeting, the two women met for a joint breakfast. The #HELSINKI2018 meeting began at the Presidential Palace after midday (at approximately 1 pm) with Niinist√∂ officially welcoming Putin, followed by Trump. The bilateral discussions between the Americans and Russian presidents took place in the Presidential Palace's Gothic Hall; Trump and Putin met with only interpreters present.Ericson, Amanda; The Washington Post: \\"Trump can't beat Putin at his own game.\\" July 16, 2018 . Retrieved 16 July 2018. Their meeting was followed by a working lunch including additional officials in the Hall of Mirrors. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said they welcomed Trump's planned meeting with Vladimir Putin. On July 13, 2018, three days before the summit, Rod Rosenstein, the United States Deputy Attorney General, announced indictments of twelve Russian GRU officers for their efforts in the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak, through the establishment of false identities as DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, as well as charges of money laundering using bitcoin. The timing of these indictments led to closer scrutiny of the upcoming meeting and pressure for Trump to discuss election meddling with Putin.reuters.com (13 July 2018): Indictment of Russian officers puts pressure on Trump at Putin summit Bloomberg News reported the day after the summit that Trump permitted the indictments to be announced prior to the summit hoping it would strengthen his position in negotiations with Putin. Two days before the scheduled meeting, a group of top Senate Democrats urged Trump to not meet with Putin one-on-one. Signers of a letter advising him not to meet alone with Putin included Minority Leader Charles Schumer, Minority Whip Dick Durbin, and the top Democrats on the Senate Intelligence (Mark Warner), Foreign Relations (Bob Menendez), Judiciary (Dianne Feinstein), Armed Services (Jack Reed), Appropriations (Patrick Leahy), and Banking (Sherrod Brown) committees.https://www.warner.senate.gov (14 July 2018): Do not meet Putin alone thehill.com (14 July 2018): Senate Dems tell Trump: Don't meet with Putin one-on-one Controversial remarks During an interview on the eve of the summit with CBS News, Trump was asked who America's biggest foe is. He said Russia is \\"a foe in certain aspects\\" and called the European Union the biggest trade foe of the United States. Trump tweeted on the morning of the summit that the relationship between Russia and the U.S. has \\"never been worse\\". He blamed this on \\"foolishness and stupidity\\" on the part of the U.S., and referenced the ongoing Special Counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections, calling it a \\"witchhunt\\". The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs retweeted Trump's message, adding \\"We agree\\". Trump also indicated his inclination to accept Putin's denial of Russian interference, saying \\"President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be.\\"  Demonstrations  According to the Finnish Broadcasting Company Yle, more than 10 demonstrations were planned for the summit. On Sunday 15 July, about 2,500 protesters gathered for the \\"Helsinki Calling\\" pro-human rights demonstration at the Helsinki Senate Square. Simultaneously, the youth section of the nationalist Finns Party staged a pro- Trump rally. The \\"Welcome Trump\\" event gathered a crowd of 50 people including Finns Party youth and Soldiers of Odin members.

On the question of the Syrian civil war, Trump wanted Iranian troops to leave Syria, while Putin would not commit to their departure. Both agreed that Iranian troops should be kept away from the Israel-Syria border, with Trump noting that \\"Creating safety for Israel is something both Putin and I would like to see very much.\\" Trump said he is willing to help Syria with humanitarian aid, even if there is no wider peace settlement. That may contradict the earlier Trump administration position that it will not provide reconstruction assistance to any part of Syria that remains under the control of Bashar al-Assad, whom Russia backs. The Russian ambassador to the U.S. later said that Syria had been the major topic of discussion, along with \\"the removal of the concerns that the United States has regarding the well-known claims about alleged interference in the elections\\". Four days after the meeting, a Russian military spokesman said Russia has sent formal proposals for a joint U.S.-Russian effort to reconstruct Syria and facilitate the return home of Syrian refugees. In a Fox News interview the next day, Putin indicated that the two had agreed to disagree about Crimea. Putin said he wanted acceptance of the disputed 2014 referendum in which Crimeans voted to become part of Russia, and insisted that Ukraine must never become part of NATO. He said they had agreed to hold talks on extension of the START treaty, which expires in 2021, but he wants to see evidence that the U.S. has lived up to the terms of the treaty. He also wants to negotiate on the 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Treaty. The day after the meeting, a Russian military spokesman said that Russia is \\"ready for practical implementation of the agreements reached between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump in the sphere of international security achieved at the Helsinki summit.\\" His statement said the agreements include cooperation in Syria and discussions about extending the START Treaty. No agreements were announced at the summit, and White House and Pentagon spokesmen said they were not aware of any new agreements. A spokesman for the National Security Council said \\"As President Trump stated, the two sides agreed that their national security council staffs will follow up on the presidents' meetings, and these discussions are underway. There were no commitments to undertake any concrete action, beyond agreement that both sides should continue discussions.\\" The spokesman said they are also reviewing suggestions by Putin for a \\"cyber- group\\" and an anti-terrorism group. At a press conference four days after the summit, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats stated, \\"I‚Äôm not in a position to either understand fully or talk about what happened in Helsinki,\\" and ceded the podium to national security advisor John Bolton, who explained that the issue of election interference was discussed. Despite this, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer remarked, \\"It is utterly amazing, utterly amazing, that no one knows what was said.\\" Senator Jeanne Shaheen and Representative Bill Pascrell called for Trump's interpreter, Marina Gross, to testify before Congress, while House Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff called for her to testify to the Committee in closed session. Press conference The press conference (English version, from White House) The press conference (Russian version from Kremlin.ru) After the private meeting and the working lunch, Trump and Putin gave a joint press conference. When Trump was asked whether he would condemn Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, he demurred, saying that Putin had denied it. > JONATHAN LEMIRE, ASSOCIATED PRESS: President Trump, you first. Just now, > President Putin denied having anything to do with the election interference > in 2016. Every U.S. intelligence agency has concluded that Russia did. My > first question for you sir is, who do you believe? My second question is > would you now, with the whole world watching, tell President Putin, would > you denounce what happened in 2016 and would you want him to never do it > again? TRUMP: So let me just say that we have two thoughts. You have groups > that are wondering why the FBI never took the server. Why haven't they taken > the server?

With that being said, all I can do is ask the question. > My people came to me, Dan Coats, came to me and some others they said they > think it's Russia. I have President Putin.

He offered to have the people working on > the case come and work with their investigators, with respect to the 12 > people. I think that's an incredible offer. Ok? Thank you. During the press conference, Jeff Mason from Reuters asked whether Putin had wanted Donald Trump to win the 2016 presidential election and had he directed any of his officials to help him do that? Putin replied: \\"Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the US-Russia relationship back to normal.\\" This contradicted a tweet sent by Trump in which he claimed: \\"I'm very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election. Based on the fact that no President has been tougher on Russia than me, they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats. They definitely don't want Trump!\\" All reference to that exchange between Mr Mason and the Russian leader was omitted from the official White House transcript. Asked whether Russia possessed any compromising material on Trump, Putin laughed and talked about the number of businessmen who visit Russia, but did not give a direct answer. Trump commented that if any such material existed \\"it would have been out long ago\\". Followup  Reaction  The hours immediately following the summit drew bipartisan criticism in the United States. Criticism focused on Trump's perceived acceptance of Putin's denial of involvement in Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, which contradicted the findings of the United States Intelligence Community, and stood in pointed contrast to the indictment of twelve Russian GRU agents just three days earlier in the ongoing Special Counsel investigation: U.S. media reaction was almost universally negative, even from many commentators on Fox News who normally support the president. International news coverage of the summit was mostly negative in Europe, triumphant in Russia, and muted in China. Democrats universally condemned Trump's performance. House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called it a \\"sad day for America.\\" Senate Democrats led by Jeanne Shaheen called for American interpreter Marina Gross, who sat in on the private meeting with Putin, to be questioned before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Shaheen added, if the administration is to exert executive privilege, \\"we need to find another way to get the information.\\" Senator Chuck Schumer said \\"We need hearings as soon as possible\\", with testimony from members of Trump's national security team present during the Helsinki summit, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\\"Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Nicholas Fandos and Thomas Kaplan, New York Times, Republicans Rebuke Trump for Siding With Putin as Democrats Demand Action , July 16, 2018. NBC News reported that \\"key senators were preparing to grill\\" Pompeo \\"on Russia and North Korea\\" when he briefs them and that \\"tempers flared\\" during a July 18, 2018 Senate Foreign Relations committee hearing at which this was discussed. New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez, top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated \\"If the administration is unwilling to consult with this committee in a meaningful fashion on vital national security issues, then we must consider all appropriate responses.\\" Republican committee chairman Bob Corker stated, \\"On challenging what happened at NATO, what happened at Helsinki, I will take a backseat to no one in this body,\\" after previously stating that \\"the dam has broken.\\" Many Republicans in Congress strongly criticized Trump as well. Senator Bob Corker claimed Trump \\"made us look like a pushover\\", Senator Ben Sasse called Trump's remarks \\"bizarre and flat-out wrong\\", while Senator Tim Scott wondered if \\"day was a step backwards\\". Others including Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell reaffirmed support for the U.S. intelligence community without directly condemning Trump. Newt Gingrich, a longtime Trump supporter, said Trump's statements about the U.S. intelligence community were \\"the most serious mistake of his presidency and must be corrected ‚Äî immediately\\". Former Governor Mitt Romney and Senator John McCain, the Republican nominees for president in 2008 and 2012, both strongly criticized Trump. Romney said Trump's siding with Putin rather than U.S. intelligence agencies was \\"disgraceful and detrimental to our democratic principles\\", while McCain called the summit \\"one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.\\" Republican Senator Rand Paul was the lone voice in the Senate to support Trump in the matter, saying that Trump should be \\"lauded and not belittled\\" for being \\"willing to meet with adversaries to try to prevent us from having World War 3.\\" A few Republican members of the House of Representatives also made supportive comments. Shortly after the summit concluded, CNN reported that Trump's \\"stunned aides wonder what went wrong\\" and \\"openly admitted they don't know how to respond to questions,\\" quoting one official involved with the summit as saying \\"this was not the plan.\\" The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal later reported that there was extensive planning before the summit to confront Putin, with one official saying the plan was for Trump to \\"shove [the Mueller indictments of 12 Russians] in Putin's face and look strong doing it\\" during both the private meeting and public press conference, but that Trump \\"did the exact opposite.\\" The New York Times, Time magazine, and The New Yorker magazine mocked Trump and the summit.

Former national security advisor Susan Rice stated that the US-Russia summit was a bad mistake, citing many reasons, and that any future meeting would be premature.ABC News  ABC News This Week with George Stephanopoulos, broadcast Sunday July 22, 2018 9:00 - 10:00 AM EDT https://abcnews.go.com/thisweek Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Glenn Greenwald, one of the founding editors of The Intercept, said that \\"90 percent of the world‚Äôs nuclear weapons are in the hands of two countries‚Äîthe United States and Russia‚Äîand having them speak and get along is much better than having them isolate one another and increase the risk of not just intentional conflict, but misperception and miscommunication, as well.\\"  Trump viewed as being under Putin's influence  The Trump‚ÄìRussia dossier alleges that the Russians possess kompromat on Trump which can be used to blackmail him, and that the Kremlin promised him that the kompromat will not be used as long as he continues his cooperation with them. Trump's actions at the Helsinki summit in 2018 \\"led many to conclude that Steele's report was more accurate than not.... Trump sided with the Russians over the U.S. intelligence community's assessment that Moscow had waged an all-out attack on the 2016 election,... The joint news conference,.. cemented fears among some that Trump was in Putin's pocket and prompted bipartisan backlash.\\" At the joint news conference, when asked directly about the subject, Putin denied that he had any kompromat on Trump. Even though Trump was reportedly given a \\"gift from Putin\\" the weekend of the pageant, Putin argued \\"that he did not even know Trump was in Russia for the Miss Universe pageant in 2013 when, according to the Steele dossier, video of Trump was secretly recorded to blackmail him.\\" In reaction to Trump's actions at the summit, Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) spoke in the Senate: Several operatives, and lawyers in the U.S. intelligence community reacted strongly to Trump's performance at the summit. They described it as \\"subservien[ce] to Putin\\" and a \\"fervent defense of Russia's military and cyber aggression around the world, and its violation of international law in Ukraine\\" which they saw as \\"harmful to US interests\\". They also suggested that he was either a \\"Russian asset\\" or a \\"useful idiot\\" for Putin, and that he looked like \\"Putin's puppet\\". Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper wondered \\"if Russians have something on Trump\\", and former CIA director John O. Brennan, who has accused Trump of \\"treason\\", tweeted: \\"He is wholly in the pocket of Putin.\\" Former acting CIA director Michael Morell has called Trump \\"an unwitting agent of the Russian federation\\", and former CIA director Michael V. Hayden said Trump was a \\"useful fool\\" who is \\"manipulated by Moscow\\". Trump's followup Trump's statement on the 17th of July The next day, Trump, reading from a prepared statement, claimed that he had mistakenly used the word \\"would\\" when he had meant to say \\"wouldn't\\", acknowledging Russian attempts at meddling in the 2016 election but denying Trump-Russia collusion. Trump paused reading his prepared statement to interject that the interference \\"Could be other people also. A lot of people out there.\\" In the past, Trump had questioned many times if Russia was responsible, and on several previous occasions when he did say Russia was responsible, he also said that other countries might also have meddled. The American intelligence community has consistently concluded that Russia was responsible for the hacking, with three intelligence agencies having \\"high confidence\\" that Russian interference was ordered by Putin himself. Trump then suggested on Twitter that his critics would rather go to war with Russia than see him get along with Putin. During an interview three days after the summit, Trump told CBS News that he holds the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, personally responsible for Russia's attempts at meddling in the 2016 US presidential election.Reuters/CBS, The Guardian, Trump says he holds Putin responsible for US election meddling ‚Äì video , July 19, 2018. Trump asked his national security adviser, John R. Bolton, to invite Mr. Putin to Washington, to continue dialogue that began in Helsinki. In a tweet, Trump indicated he looked forward to a second meeting with Mr. Putin \\"so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed\\" in Helsinki.Mark Landler, 'New York Times,' Trump to Invite Putin to Washington, Blindsiding His Intelligence Chief , July 19, 2018. Russian public opinion Survey results published by Levada-Center indicate that, as of July 2018, Russians increasingly viewed the United States positively following the presidential summit. Possibility of Russia interrogating U.S. citizens During his joint press conference with Putin, Trump stated, \\"And what [Putin] did is an incredible offer; he offered to have the people working on the [Special Counsel investigation] come and work with their investigators with respect to the 12 [Russians who were under indictment in America]. I think that's an incredible offer.\\" Trump did not mention the quid pro quo for Putin's offer, which was to have Russians interrogate 11 U.S. citizens. Two days later, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed that Putin and Trump had discussed the possibility of Russian officials questioning Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia, as well as Putin critic Bill Browder and others, in exchange for allowing investigators of the Special Counsel investigation to question twelve Russians who are under indictment in America. Sanders stated in a press conference, \\"The president will work with his team and we'll let you know if there's an announcement on that front.\\"Nauert, Heather (July 18, 2018). \\"Department Press Briefing - July 18, 2018\\" .

The pillar is called the Nigali Sagar pillar, or also the Nighihawa pillar, or Nigliva pillar, or Araurakot Asoka Pillar. The site is located about 20 kilometers northwest of Lumbini and 7 kilometers northeast of Taulihawa, Nepal.Lumbini development trust report Another famous inscription discovered nearby in a similar context is the Lumbini pillar inscription. Discovery The pillar was initially discovered by a Nepalese officer on a hunting expedition.\\"In 1893 a Nepalese officer on a hunting expedition found an Asokan pillar near Nigliva, at Nigali Sagar.\\" The pillar and its inscriptions (there are several inscriptions on it, from Brahmi to Medieval) were researched in March 1895 by Alois Anton F√ºhrer. F√ºhrer published his discovery in the Progress Report of the Archaeological Survey Circle, North-West Province, for the year ending on June 30, 1895. The fact that the inscription was discovered by Alois Anton F√ºhrer, who is also known to have forged Brahmi inscriptions on ancient stone artefacts, casts a doubt on the authenticity of this inscription. The pillar was not erected in-situ, as no foundation has been discovered under it. It is thought that it was moved about 8 to 13 miles, from an uncertain location. Besides his description of the pillar, F√ºhrer made a detailed description of the remains of a monumental \\"Konagamana stupa\\" near the Nigali Sagar pillar, which was later discovered to be an imaginative construct. Furher wrote that \\"On all sides around this interesting monument are ruined monasteries, fallen columns, and broken sculptures\\", when actually nothing can be found around the pillar.\\"\\"On all sides around this interesting monument are ruined monasteries, fallen columns, and broken sculptures.\\" This elaborate description was not supported by a single drawing, plan, or photograph. Every word of it is false.\\" in In the following years, inspections of the site showed that there were no such archaeological remains, and that, in respect to Fuhrer's description \\"every word of it is false\\". It was finally understood in 1901 that F√ºhrer had copied almost word-for-word this description from a report by Alexander Cunningham about the stupas in Sanchi. Kanakamuni Buddha \\"Budha-sa KonƒÅkamana-sa\\" (ëÄ©ëÄºëÄ•ëÄ≤ ëÄìëÅÑëÄ¶ëÄ∏ëÄìëÄ´ëÄ¶ëÄ≤, \\"Of the Kanakamuni Buddha\\") inscription in the Brahmi Script, at Nigali Sagar, 250 BCE It is said that in this place the Kanakamuni Buddha, one of the Buddhas of the past, was born.Political Violence in Ancient India by Upinder Singh p.46 The Asoka inscription engraved on the pillar in Brahmi script and Pali language attests the fact that Emperor Asoka enlarged the Kanakamuni Buddha's stupa, worshiped it and erected a stone pillar for Kanakamuni Buddha on the occasion of the twentieth year of his coronation. Added to the doubts on the authenticity of the inscription, the very mention of a \\"divinized Buddha having been several time reborn\\" and preceded by other Buddhas such as the Kanakamuni Buddha, inscribed on a pillar in a historical period as early as the 3rd century BCE, is considered by some authors as quite doubtfull and problematic. Such complex religious constructions are generally considered as belonging to later stages of the development of Buddhism. The Nigali Sagar Edict The inscription, made when Emperor Asoka visited the site in 249 BCE and erected the pillar, reads: { class=\\" centre\\" + Nigali Sagar Edict - ! scope=\\"col\\" align=left Translation (English)!!Transliteration (original Brahmi script)!!Inscription (Prakrit in the Brahmi script) - align=center width=\\"30%\\"  align=left  align=center width=\\"10%\\" Rubbing of the inscription. } Because of this dedication by Ashoka, the Nigali Sagar pillar has the earliest known record ever of the word \\"Stupa\\" (here the Pali word Thube).Amaravati: The Art of an early Buddhist Monument in context. p.23 There is also a second inscription, \\"Om mani padme hum\\" and \\"Sri Ripu Malla Chiram Jayatu 1234\\" made by King Ripu Malla in the year 1234 (Saka Era, corresponding to 1312 CE). Accounts of the pillar The Chinese pilgrims Fa-Hien and Hiuen-Tsang describe the Kanakamuni Stupa and the Asoka Pillar in their travel accounts.

Main characters * Iggle Piggle (played by Nick Kellington) is a blue doll creature, somewhat resembling a doll with a bean-shaped head and a sideways red mohawk with average sized legs. He always carries his red blanket, and tends to fall flat on his back when surprised. He is the main character of the show. He arrives at the beginning and leaves the Night Garden at the end of each episode in a boat, for which the blanket doubles as a sail. Iggle Piggle has a bell in his left foot, a squeaker in his tummy, and a rattle in his left hand. His best friends in the garden are Upsy Daisy and Makka Pakka. He is the only character not to sleep in the Night Garden (with one exception when he fell asleep on Upsy Daisy's bed), because sometimes he needs to find his boat; he sleeps on his boat instead of in a bed. He is the only character to walk on the Stepping Stone Path. He was first featured in the episode \\"Makka Pakka Washes Faces\\". Sometimes Iggle Piggle has a red blanket in the boat. * Upsy Daisy (played by Rebecca Hyland) is similar to a rag doll, with a brown complexion, a chime in her tummy, and brightly coloured clothes. She likes skipping through the Garden and blowing kisses to the other characters or to the audience. She often hugs and kisses other characters, particularly Iggle Piggle. Her catchphrases are \\"Upsy Daisy,\\" and the more emphatic \\"Daisy Doo!\\", and she says \\"Pip pip onk onk!\\", her way of saying goodbye. and the cutest is \\"Mwah!\\", Her hair stands on end when excited or surprised, and her skirt inflates to a tutu when she dances or pulls the ripcord on her waist. She, along with Iggle Piggle were first featured in the episode \\"Makka Pakka Washes Faces\\" and she first pulls the ripcord on her waist in \\"Makka Pakka's trumpet makes a funny noise\\". * Makka Pakka (played by Justyn Towler) is a beige, small, round-bodied doll. He has three rounded protuberances on his head, ears and back to represent stones that he uses to make into piles. He lives in a cave and likes cleaning his collection of stones, and sometimes the other characters. Makka Pakka often stacks freshly cleaned stones into piles resembling his head and body. He sleeps in a brightly coloured sleeping bag, often cuddling a stone as a toy. He travels around the garden riding his trolley, the Og-Pog, which carries his sponge, soap, red/orange trumpet, and a spacer called \\"the uff-uff\\" which he uses to dry items after cleaning them. His house is approached by a stone-walled ditch, as his home is half buried in the ground. He says his own name and the phrase \\"Mikka makka moo\\" when he is happy, as well as the names of the Og-Pog and the Uff-Uff, and other phrases from his song such as \\"agga pang\\" (his soap and sponge), and \\"hum dum\\" (his trumpet) and possibly \\"Ing ang oo\\" (when he wants to blow his trumpet). Like Upsy Daisy and the Tombliboos, he also uses a phrase meaning \\"goodbye\\", represented in publications as \\"pip pip onk onk\\". He, along with Iggle Piggle and Upsy Daisy were first featured in the episode \\"Makka Pakka Washes Faces\\". As Makka Pakka is smaller than the other characters, he is filmed on another identical set (or garden), and where he appears with other characters, two scenes are shot in parallel and he is filmed far away, whilst the other costumed characters are filmed close up. Makka Pakka is said to be the reincarnation of Christ himself. Make sure to respect him at all costs. The character has also become a meme. * The Tombliboos ‚Äì Unn (Andy Wareham), Ooo (Holly Denoon/Isaac Blake), and Eee (Elisa Laghi) ‚Äì are three doll creatures who dressed in costumes with stripes and spots: red and green (Unn), brown and pink (Ooo), and yellow and pink (Eee). Their names reflect phonetically how a young child might count to three, and the Tombliboos always appear in this order by saying their names. They live among the branches of a bush, on a series of platforms connected by stairs and chutes, the platforms sometimes rock a little bit when the tombliboos jump on them as seen in \\"the tombliboos clean their teeth\\". The Tombliboos enjoy playing the drums and piano, although not with any particular musical prowess, and they also play with large blocks. Their trousers (which fall down unexpectedly) are often seen hanging on the washing line outside their home, and they usually take them down from the line and put them on before going on an adventure. They are sometimes seen brushing their teeth before bed. Tombliboos enjoy kissing each other whilst cuddling and reciting their names. They also have a song about staying together, which consists of them singing \\"Tombliboo, Tombliboo, Unn, Ooo, Eee!\\" over and over again. Tombliboo Eee is female and is shorter and smaller than Ooo and Unn. The Tombliboos, along with Iggle Piggle, Upsy Daisy and Makka Pakka were first featured in the episode \\"Makka Pakka Washes Faces\\". Minor characters * The Pontipines (red) and The Wottingers (blue) are two families of ten tiny creatures (a mother and a father, plus four boys and four girls) similar to wooden pegs. They live in a semi-detached house at the foot of a tree. The Pontipines appear in most episodes, while appearances by the Wottingers are rare. The Pontipines all dress in a very similar fashion to each other, as do the Wottingers. Each family sleeps in one room, their beds next to each other in rows. The Pontipines enter their home by flying down the chimney or going through the front door. They have no feet, but their footsteps can still be heard by the viewers. The Pontipines enter the Pinky Ponk through a different door from all the other characters, and stay on a separate deck. The Pontipines and the Wottingers appear to be animated using stop motion, but in reality they were Wooden Dutch Dolls wearing felt coats that were moved in real life by a puppeteer, with a strobe effect applied in post-production to give the illusion of stop motion animation. They chatter by making high- pitched \\"mi-mi-mi\\" sounds and \\"spitting\\" noises. The \\"spitting\\" noises are actually their breathing. Mr Pontipine's fake moustache flies off his face only once and settles on Mrs Pontipine's hat as seen in 'Mr Pontipine's Moustache Flies Away'. The adult Pontipines and the adult Wottingers wear large hats. Mrs Pontipine carries a pair of binoculars around her neck at all times, which she uses to look for her children when they get lost, or to find the flying fake moustache . The Wottingers are similar in design to the Pontipines, though not identical; they can be glimpsed in the general dance sequences, but are not seen going to bed. The Pontipines, along with Iggle Piggle, Upsy Daisy, Makka Pakka and the Tombliboos were first featured in the 1st episode \\"Makka Pakka Washes Faces\\" and the Wottingers first appeared in the episode \\"The Pontipine Children in the Tombliboo Trousers\\". * The Haahoos are five very large inflatable pillow creatures of various shapes and colours with eyes and smiling mouths. They move slowly around the garden making deep springy sounds (\\"boing, boing\\"). The Haahoos appear behind the gazebo during general dance sequences, and are also seen going to sleep, closing their eyes and deflating slightly. They come in the shape of a flower, an X, a star, a circle and a plum. They were first featured in the episode \\"The Tombliboos' Waving Game\\". * The Tittifers are a group of tropical birds with their own unique songs. There are four small blue tittifers (long-tailed finches), three larger pink ones (hoopoes), two big green ones (white-cheeked turacos) and one Channel-billed toucan. They usually sing between segments, and when they sing together, near the end, it is time to sleep. They, along with Iggle Piggle, Upsy Daisy, Makka Pakka, the Tombliboos and the Pontipines were first featured in the episode \\"Makka Pakka Washes Faces\\". * The Ninky Nonk is a Train with five differently sized and shaped carriages. Its size is non-euclidean: exterior shots of the moving Ninky Nonk show a toy-sized train, quite small compared to the main characters and scenery, while interiors and static exterior shots are done on sets or with life-sized models so that the main characters can easily fit inside. When it stops or starts, the seat-belted passengers jerk sharply in their seats, the characters are chroma keyed so they can get in, and the ride is often described as \\"bumpy\\" and \\"Bouncy\\", Bells and green lights warn everyone inside when the Ninky Nonk is ready to depart. The Ninky Nonk can drive up and down trees and upside-down along branches. Like the other characters, it goes to sleep. The engine is banana- shaped with a green flashing light on top, and is followed by a green spheroidal carriage used by the Tombliboos and Makka Pakka, a tiny house-like carriage used by the Pontipines and Wottingers, a blue tardis-like carriage with magenta lines used by Upsy Daisy and Igglepiggle (when he is travelling with Upsy Daisy), and a tall rounded single-seater carriage used by Iggle Piggle when he is travelling alone. All the carriages have lights on top that flash in sequence when the Ninky Nonk is stationary, it is controlled by a remote control, it's song goes \\"Igglepiggle, Iggle onk, were going to catch, the Ninky Nonk, Oh no, It's the Ninky Nonk, Catch the Ninky Nonk!\\". It was first featured in the episode \\"Everybody, All Aboard the Ninky Nonk\\". The Ninky Nonk can occasionally go round and round branches, and it can occasionally stop on branches, it first went up a tree in \\"Igglepiggle's Mucky Patch\\" and it first stopped on a branch in \\"Mr Pontipine's Moustache Flies Away\\". * The Pinky Ponk is a zeppelin, speckled with many slowly waving fins and several small propellers that can spin fast, plus a large propeller at the rear that always turns very gently. The characters often use it to travel around the forest, and during their journey are able to drink \\"Pinky Ponk juice\\" which is dispensed in \\"sippy cups\\". It comes in several colours. If drunk too much, you can feel ill, as demonstrated by Tombliboo Ooo in the episode Tombliboo Ooo Drinks Everyone else's Pinky Ponk Juice (2007). As well as whirrings and clankings, and a sporadic honking sound from the \\"Ponk light\\" at the front, the Pinky Ponk makes flatulent noises. Like the Ninky Nonk, the Pinky Ponk does not conform to euclidean geometry: exterior shots are chroma keyed model shots showing a model smaller than the main characters, while interior ones shots produced on a set into which they can fit. It has two doors, one for the costumed characters and the other for the tiny characters. One table has three seats (for the Tombliboos), another has two seats (for Iggle Piggle and Upsy Daisy), and the third has one seat (for Makka Pakka). The Pontipines take a table with no seats in a small room. It also has a habit of being struck by tree trunks, thus sounding the \\"Ponk Alert\\" (repeated honking and flashing of the \\"Ponk Light\\" and interior lights flashing and making noises). This is a warning for all the passengers to take their seats and brace. Sometimes, the Pinky Ponk rocks during the \\"Ponk Alert\\", causing the passengers and their tables and chairs to slide from one end to the other, it, along with the Ninky Nonk, is controlled by a remote control. Its song goes \\"Igglepiggle, iggle onk, we're going to catch, the Pinky Ponk! Hurry up, Pinky Ponk!\\". It, along with the Haahoos, was first featured in the episode \\"The Tombliboos' Waving Game\\". * The Ball is a colourful living ball that plays with the Night Garden characters. It was first featured in the episode \\"The Ball\\". * Upsy Daisy's Bed is Upsy Daisy's specially private wagon-like bed. She moves it around the Night Garden, with its ripcord; sometimes she has to catch the Bed, before it runs away; it, along with the Ninky Nonk and Pinky Ponk, is controlled by a remote control. It was first featured in the episode \\"Makka Pakka's Trumpet Makes a Funny Noise\\". * The Tiddle is a small geyser- like fountain. It appears in any place of the Night Garden when someone stomps his/her feet thrice. It disappears when someone stomps one of his/her feet once. It was featured in the episode \\"Igglepiggle's Tiddle\\". * The Trubliphones are a sort of telephone scattered randomly throughout the garden. The characters can use them to communicate with one another. They were first featured in the episode \\"Upsy Daisy's Big Loud Sing Song\\".

The Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, , relied on the ministry's secretary, Jules Ozenne, and the general director of customs, L√©on Am√©, to help formulate the government's tariff policy.Smith, p. 44. They wished to retain and extend the free trade policies of the Second French Empire by lowering the protectionist duties in France's general tariff to the level of the conventional tariff in France's commercial treaties.Smith, p. 44. This new general tariff would then be used to negotiate trade treaties that would lower the conventional tariff.Smith, p. 44. Meaux announced the government's intention to devise a new tariff in a circular of 7 April 1875. He also appealed for the advice on tariff levels from France's chambers of commerce.Smith, pp. 44-45. 54 chambers responded, with a majority favouring replacing the ad valorem duties with fixed duties and with all of them supporting making the existing conventional tariff the new general tariff.Smith, p. 45. In March 1876 Meaux ordered the Conseil sup√©rieur du commerce to draft a bill that would determine tariff levels.Smith, p. 45. In February 1877 the bill was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies: it abolished all protective duties and in the majority of duties it made the old minimum duties the maximum that could be levied.Smith, p. 47. However, the Seize Mai crisis led to the bill being withdrawn.Smith, p. 47. In March 1878 the Chamber appointed a commission (under the chairmanship of Jules Ferry) to report on a tariff bill. This deliberated until March 1879.Smith, p. 152, p. 154. Ferry called the commission \\"the most complete, the most practical, the best controlled, in a word, the most serious [inquiry] that has ever taken place\\".Smith, p. 154. Another request for input from the chambers of commerce again led to 54 responses between April and August 1878.Smith, p. 153. These revealed protectionism's growing popularity since 1875, with half favouring duties higher than those desired by the government.Smith, p. 153. In December 1879 the commission submitted its moderately protectionist tariff bill to the Chamber.Smith, p. 159. Augustin Pouyer-Quertier The debate was divided between free traders who argued for a low general tariff and a new conventional tariff, against the protectionists who favoured a prohibitive tariff if and when the commercial treaties expired.Smith, p. 160. In June 1878 the Free Trade Association was founded.Smith, p. 161. On 1 May 1879 the protectionists held a congress (chaired by Augustin Pouyer-Quertier) in the Grand Hotel in Paris, with over 100 delegates representing the chambers of commerce, senators, deputies and officers of the Association de l'industrie fran√ßaise.Smith, p. 164. Both sides campaigned to win over public opinion in the propaganda war fought across the country.Smith, p. 165, p. 169. Pouyer- Quertier wished to convert the French farmer to protection in the hope that they would support tariffs for industry in return for tariffs for agriculture.Smith, pp. 166-169. In the Chamber the debate on the bill started on 30 January 1880, with lobbyists from both sides congregating in Paris to influence the vote.Smith, pp. 170-171. An agreement between the industrial protectionists and the farmers' bloc to support protection broke down when the industrialists, mistrusting their agricultural allies, failed to vote for agricultural protection.Smith, p. 174. In the voting on the clauses of the bill in the Chamber, the free traders achieved their main goal in defeating the higher tariffs for industrial goods favoured by the commission.Smith, p. 176. In the Senate the protectionists again dominated the commission appointed to examine the bill, with the result that their bill resembled the protectionist one drafted by the Chamber's commission. The main difference, however, reflected a renewed attempt at industrial-agricultural co-operation: this time agriculture received higher rates of protection than before.Smith, p. 179. The Senate began debating the bill on 15 February 1881, with voting commencing on 19 February. Again, the industrial-agricultural alliance broke down. This time, however, it was the agriculturists who broke ranks: despite the industrialists voting for agricultural protection the agriculturists voted against the duty on textiles.Smith, pp. 179-180. In the end, industry failed to receive the protection it campaigned for: the general tariff for manufacturers was raised by 24 per cent. and fixed at a specific level rather than ad valorem.Smith, p. 181. Agriculture received less protection than industry but the agriculturists managed to raise livestock duties and they also ensured that agricultural duties could not be lowered in any future commercial treaty.Smith, p. 181. Overall, the law was a victory for free traders.Smith, p. 181.Ashley, p. 316. Rates The duty on wheat was 0.60 francs per 100kg; for flour 1.20 francs; butter 13 francs; cheese 8 francs; eggs 10 francs; beef and pork 3 francs; bullocks 15 francs; cows 8 francs; pigs 3 francs and wine 8 francs.Tracy, p. 66. Oats and barley were admitted duty free.Tracy, p. 66. Raw materials were either admitted duty free or subject to a small duty.Ashley, p. 316.

The types were constructed in parallel with very similar designs. All passenger carriages operating under the Victorian Railways were painted a deep red, with black underframes and white lettering. In the early preservation era, vehicles managed by the Puffing Billy Preservation Society had a yellow band painted across the side, indicating the change in responsibility, although this practice slowly fell out of favour in the Emerald Tourist Railway Board era with few (if any) carriages now carrying this indication.http://westonlangford.com/images/photo/100147/http://westonlangford.com/images/photo/130250/ Victorian Railways stock NBB and NBDBD (saloon pairs) When the Wangaratta to Whitfield line opened in March 1889, it was provided with two American-style second-class bogie saloon vehicles coded BB, and two bogie composite passenger car/brakevans coded BDBD. This could have led to confusion in official correspondence, so the codes painted on the carriages were amended with an N prefix in front of the carriage numbers before they entered service, i.e. N2BDBD.http://pjv101.net/cd/images/c439m.jpg The carriages were designed to operate in pairs. The saloon carriage featured open end platforms longitudinal benches, initially divided into two internal compartments with a dividing bulkhead and doorway. The shortest bench, seating two, was opposite the ladies' lavatory and was two windows long. The remainder of the carriage had inward-facing longitudinal bench seating for 22 passengers. The main saloon was subsequently divided by a partition and sliding door to provide a smoking compartment holding eight passengers at the opposite end to the ladies' compartment, whilst the central saloon seated 14 passengers.Speed Limit 20http://pjv101.net/cd/images/c437m.gifhttp://www.members.optusnet.com.au/~narrow.gauge/rsnbi.htm The composite carriage had a single saloon area fully enclosed and fitted with seating for seven passengers. The composite van's passenger area was unofficially reserved for gentlemen, with smoking permitted and access to the male lavatory area between the passenger and guard areas. Passengers could only access the gentlemen's saloon through the guard compartment, or via the end-of-carriage doorways included at both ends of the NBBD vans which were designed to link to the saloon car's end platforms when coupled. Passengers were also permitted to walk through the train via the guards compartment if under supervision. The NBDBD van area was designed with a workspace, capacity for up to four tons of goods or luggage, and a booking office compartment obviating the need for on-platform ticket sales staff. To avoid the need to reverse the two carriages at each end of every run, the NBB cars were permitted to trail behind the NBDBD vans on each train with the guard working from the van area, but walking to the rear of the NBB when required. An additional vehicle of each type was constructed in 1900 for the line to Gembrook, followed by two more of each in 1901. 4NBDBD and 4NBB functioned as spare vehicles, replacing those which had been transported to Newport Workshops for maintenance, while 5NBB and 5NBDBD were held in storage until the Beech Forest line opened in 1902. 1904 saw the sixth NBB enter service at Wangaratta, and in 1905, the sixth NBDBD at Moe for the then-under- construction line to Walhalla. In 1910 the codes were changed from NBDBD to NBC and NBB to NB respectively. At the same time, a seventh NBC carriage was constructed, entering service near the end of 1910 on the newly-opened Walhalla line. The pattern vehicles were built at Newport Workshops, while 2NBDBD/2NBB and 3NBDBD/3NBB were constructed by private work gangs. All other vehicles were then constructed at Newport Workshops directly by the railways.http://pjv101.net/cd/pages/c439d.htmhttp://pjv101.net/cd/pages/c437d.htm By 1914, both 3NB and 5NB were fitted with a vertical hand brake on one of the end platforms. This allowed their use as a trailing vehicle on a train if no guards van was available.https://victoriancollections.net.au/media/collectors/52969eff2162ef171c566b9e/items/58c88222d0cef02a282abb32/item- media/59b3332221ea680e10a9efda/original.pdf1914 Victorian Railways rolling stock diagrams book Automatic couplers were fitted in lieu of the original Chopper style progressively between 1926 and 1928. 4 and 5NBC were scrapped in 1938, 3 and 6 in 1951 and 7 in 1954. 1NBC had been sold in 1954 and transferred to a private property in Colac, from which it was recovered in 1995. 2NBC had been condemned in 1954 but, like much of the Puffing Billy rolling stock, it was restored for use on that line. 3NB was erroneously recorded as scrapped in 1928, but later recorded in the workshops in 1931, and was stored at Wangaratta following cessation of passenger services on the line from there to Whitfield. It was recommended for scrapping in December 1937, and this took place in March the following year, along with 4NB. 6NB was sold privately along with compartment car 8NB, and these were recovered by the Puffing Billy Preservation Society from Ocean Grove in the 2000s. 1, 2 and 5NB were retained in service until 1950, when the bodies were transferred to Pakenham for use as staff accommodation during the Gippsland line electrification project. They were officially recorded as scrapped at Newport Workshops in February 1951, but in 1959 all three bodies were purchased by the Puffing Billy Preservation Society and transported by road from Pakenham to Menzies Creek.Daryl Gregory Puffing Billy Railway currently has 2NBC, 1NB, 2NBD-ex-2NB (with guard's compartment fitted ) and 5NBD-ex-5NB (as composite guard/kitchen) available for service, along with 1NBC, 6NBC and 6NB awaiting restoration. NABAB, NBB and NDD (compartment style) After a few years of operation the design of passenger stock on the narrow gauge changed. Instead of coupled pairs of saloon carriages, miniature versions of normal broad-gauge rolling stock were constructed with compartment interiors. The first of these were 7NBB, 8NBB and 1NABAB entering service in 1906. These carriages had identical external dimensions. The second-class NBB carriages were split into five equal compartments each seating eight passengers across two bencheshttps://victoriancollections.net.au/media/collectors/52969eff2162ef171c566b9e/items/58758314d0cdda2da80747a4/item- media/5aff270321ea6a152c822e6c/VictorianCollections-medium.jpg for a total capacity of 40 second-class passengers, with the outermost compartment at one end for smoking passengers and at the other for ladies. The NABAB carriage featured three compartments either side of a pair of central lavatory compartments for female passengers. The outer compartment at each end of the NABAB sat eight smoking passengers, while the inner two compartments either side sat four each.http://pjv101.net/cd/images/c435m.gif for a total of 16 first and 16 second class passengers. All these vehicles were allocated to the Gembrook line. In 1907 9NBB and 2NABAB were built and followed their classmates to the Gembrook line. The full brakevan design was introduced in 1909 with 1NDD, built at Newport Workshops. It had the short wheelbase of the earlier NBDBD vans, but were otherwise designed similarly to the newer compartment style carriages including the extra height. The type was aimed primarily at goods trains, as traffic had grown to the point that mixed trains were no longer justified. As such, it did not feature any passenger capacity, end-of-carriage doorways or a booking office area. It was constructed along with 3NABAB, 4NABAB for use on the Walhalla Line. Under the 1910 recoding scheme, the NBBs of both types reclassed as NB, the NABAB to NAB, and 1NDD was recoded to 1NC. That year also saw 10NB constructed. In 1911 the Colac to Beech Forest line was extended to Crowes, and in 1912 cars 11-14NB and van 2NC was constructed to reflect both that and increased traffic elsewhere on the system. These were followed in 1914 vy cars 15-17NB and vans 3, 4 and 5NC, then 18‚Äì23NB in 1915 and 6NC in 1919.http://www.pjv101.net/cd/pages/c441d.htm Much like 5NBC, when 5NC was rostered to the Crowes line it had a stove fitted. 1917 saw 4NAB relettered as pure second class and recoded 24NB; the other three vehicles followed in 1923, with 1NAB through 3NAB becoming 25‚Äì27NB. Automatic couplers were fitted in lieu of the original Chopper style progressively between 1926 and 1928. The NB cars were withdrawn in four batches. 1938 saw the loss of 8, 15 and 16NB, followed by 9, 11, 13 and 17-22 inclusive in 1949. 7, 10 and 14 were withdrawn in 1951, and the last pair, 12 and 23, in 1955. 25NB, formerly 1NAB, was scrapped in 1940, followed by 27NB ex 3NAB in 1951. Both 24NB and 26NB were recorded as scrapped in 1954 with the bodies recycled, but the latter \\"returned to register\\" in 1957.http://pjv101.net/cd/pages/c435d.htm 1NC was scrapped in 1954, followed by 4NC in 1957. 6 was officially scrapped in 1955, but the body has since been recovered by Puffing Billy. 2, 3 and 5NC do not have recorded scrapping dates.http://pjv101.net/cd/pages/c441d.htm Of these, 2NC had been recommended for scrapping at Wangaratta in November 1953, but instead it was overhauled at Newport Workshops then transferred to Colac. The other two units, 3 and 5NC, remained in Victorian Railways service until transferred to the Emerald Tourist Railway Board. Puffing Billy Railway currently has former NABABs 2 and 4 in service as 26NAC and 24NB respectively, along with vans 2NC and 5NC. The Railway also has 3NC, 6NC, 8NB and 14NB awaiting restoration.http://www.members.optusnet.com.au/~narrow.gauge/rsnbii.htmhttp://www.members.optusnet.com.au/~narrow.gauge/rsnab.htm 3NC was notable as one of the original Puffing Billy Preservation Society vehicles. NQR open trucks in holiday traffic Following the first world war traffic on the Upper Ferntree Gully to Gembrook line increased drastically, and the Victorian Railways were ill-prepared to manage this. As a short-term solution some of the NQR open trucks were fitted with seats and removable frameworks supporting canvas roofs and curtains, and trucks NQR 114 and 140 were identified as having screw-type hand brakes fitted in addition to normal air brakes, permitting their use in lieu of brake vans‚Äîbut only in the city-bound direction, and only for holiday traffic.Victorian Railways, General Appendix to the Book of Rules and Regulations and to the Working Time Table, April 1919, p.350 Notably, this modification is not reflected in the Rolling Stock Register for either truck. Both were recorded as sold privately in 1954.http://pjv101.net/cd/pages/c445d.htm Five more NQRs, numbered 219‚Äì223, were built between 1990 and 1992 by the Puffing Billy Railway, initially for passenger use and fitted with modified removable shelter frames. NBH holiday stock As a longer-term answer to the increased traffic on the Gembrook Line, in 1918 six NQR trucks (31, 33, 36, 38, 39 and 46) were withdrawn from service, stripped to the underframe and rebuilt into the first of the NBH passenger carriages, numbered 1 through 6 respectively and used for excursion-class passenger holiday traffic between April and May 1919.http://www.pjv101.net/cd/pages/c440d.htmhttps://puffingbilly.com.au/wp- content/uploads/Conservation-Manangement-Plan.pdf p.56 When they re-entered service they featured two single side doors on each side, a longitudinal central bench arrangement, air brakes but no hand brakes, and only a single cross-bar along the sides. 41 days after entering service a lower bar was fitted to the sides, after the Railways accepted that passengers were going to sit on the window sills no matter what the official position was.https://www.facebook.com/PuffingBillyRailway/posts/10161613262280397?comment_id=10161625200395397&comment;_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D Following the broad-gauge tradition the \\"H\\" suffix indicated that the cars were only to be used for excursion traffic as required, because their accommodation was not of the same standard that regular passengers would have expected. Later in 1919, a further nine NBH vehicles were constructed, and these entered service as 7‚Äì15NBH on 8 December that year. These vehicles all shared the standard goods vehicle underframe design, including bogie spacing. They were rated to carry 32 passengers each. The carriages were exclusively used between Upper Ferntree Gully and Gembrook until 1958, when the remaining 8 NBHs (3‚Äì4, 6‚Äì7, 9‚Äì11 & 13)Daryl Gregory were transferred to Colac for Australian Railway Historical Society trips on the Beech Forest line until its closure 1962. The NBH carriages slowly fell into disuse from the 1930s and some were written off, with 1, 5 and 15 known to have been officially scrapped. However, in the early preservation era the Puffing Billy Preservation Society was forbidden by the Victorian Railways to introduce new vehicles to the fleet, so over time the condemned NBH carriages were \\"restored\\" and entered service. Puffing Billy Railway Under the Puffing Billy Preservation Society and later the Emerald Tourist Railway Board's management, the fleet of the Belgrave to Gembrook line has increased significantly from when the Victorian Railways was in control. NBH The remaining four first-series NBH vehicles, and the \\"restored\\" 1 and 5NBH, have had hand-brakes fitted. 8NBH has been restored to as near as possible to its original condition, with individual tongue and groove boards, canvas blinds, unpadded seating and full-length running boards.https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yYk7yTObmXg/WjCY0RBth4I/AAAAAAAACoI/MwJWLPXhg0opxdmGxTdNepaJp9GlPxNgACLcBGAs/s1600/Insteam%2BMeet%2BSept%2B2017-6951.JPG All the other original remaining vehicles have had thick padding added to the seats, and their canvas window blinds replaced with vinyl blinds with clear panels built in. All of the vehicles (besides 8NBH) have also had their tongue-and-groove timber ends and sides replaced with plywood sheets including simulated v-joints for additional strength and ease of construction. The capacity of each carriage has also been reduced from 32 to 28 adult passengers, addressing comfort levels. A few NBH vehicles also had fixed perspex panels fitted in lieu of the blinds to provide shelter and prevent people sitting on the handrails over a few winters, but this proved unpopular with the public and the experiment has not been repeated. In 1981 two new vehicles were built to the original NBH design, as the 250th and 251st vehicles to use the standard narrow-gauge underframe design. These entered service as 16NBH and 17NBH. 1997 to 1998 saw a further six units added to the fleet, with steel body frames in lieu of timber and with wider windowsills but otherwise to the same design. 18NBH entered traffic on 19/4/1997; 19NBH on 5/12/1997; 20NBH on 19/12/1997, with the others added in 1998. =NBHC conversions= As many of the original NBC and NC guards vans were scrapped by the Victorian Railways, Puffing Billy needed to organise additional vehicles with guard's accommodation. To accomplish this, three NBH vehicles were converted‚Äîoriginally intended to be temporary‚Äîfrom their original designs, with the short section between a door and the end of the vehicle fitted with a handbrake, windows and a partition to act as a guard's compartment. The three vehicles are now 11, 21 and 22NBHC. 21 and 22NBHC had double doors fitted in one end to provide for wheelchair access. Use of the NBHC cars in trains also removes the weight of a full-length guards van from each train, permitting additional passenger capacity within the length and weight limits and reduces turn-around time at each end of the line, obviating the need for the guard van to be shunted to the opposite end of the train but removing the visual aspect of a traditional-looking van in the rear. With the addition of the guard's compartment, a C was added to the end of the classification to identify its use as a brakevan, whereas traditional Victorian Railways coding would have the C before the H, making it NBCH. =Extended NBH= At the same time as 16NBH and 17NBH entered service, a new experimental design of extended NBH was constructed. Identified as 51NBH, this vehicle had double-doors at both ends and fold-up seats, providing capacity for up to three wheelchairs at each end. The vehicle length is the same as the compartment-style NAB/NB carriages. A second extended NBH, number 52, entered service in 1983. While the cars were successful, they increased the carriage weight by a seventh and decreased capacity from 28 to 24 passengers. In the 2010s, the Puffing Billy Railway began investigating options for increasing its passenger fleet to cater for increased tourist traffic, with an interest expressed in twelve additional carriages. This would be enough to form an extra block train, above the maximum four trains in service on the busiest days each year at present. Various designs were considered with lengths between the original design and a conceptual 11-metre carriage seating 42 passengers, but the decision was made to construct the new carriages to the same length as the previous extended NBH units 51 and 52. The new carriages will be constructed with steel frames similar to 18‚Äì23NBH. The new fleet will enter service as eight regular extended NBH cars 24‚Äì31 (instead of, say, 53‚Äì59), and four NBHC vehicles featuring an enclosed guard's compartment with three rear windows similar to those in the NC vans, and capacity for up to 24 passengers, or 12 plus six wheelchairs, numbered 1‚Äì4NBHC. The first new carriage frame was transferred from Belgrave to Emerald for panelling and fit-out on 11 December 2017. 26NAC Along with the NBH to NBHC conversions, carriage 26NB (formerly 2NAB) was restored as 26NAC, with the centre toilets removed and replaced with seating capacity, but one of the end compartments replaced with a guard's compartment. 2NC During 2NC's restoration it was fitted with extra seating capacity for staff members, or passengers only if absolutely necessary. NAL/NBL and NBD Four end- platform, \\"O\\" class carriages were built in the period 1901‚Äì1902 for the Tasmanian Mt. Lyell Mining & Railway Company's 3'6\\" gauge railway. When that line closed in 1965, O1 was acquired by Puffing Billy for testing and, when this proved successful, the remaining carriages were imported. The first unit was reclassed 1NBL and the others followed, with the \\"L\\" reflecting their Mt. Lyell origin and perhaps a reference to the deluxe carriages Pioneer and Enterprise, later classed BL. 1NBL was originally painted cream and red and used as its VIP carriage for special occasions, while the other vehicles were restored for regular use and painted all-over red. When the Railway embarked on its Luncheon Train and Night Train services, the NBL cars were fitted with upgraded seating and gates in the end-platform railings, reclassed as NAL to reflect their first-class use and repainted in red with ornate gold lining. The cars were named after stations on the Mt. Lyell line, 1 through 4 respectively as Mt. Lyell, Teepookana, Rinadeena, and Dubbil Barril. 1NB (saloon type) was restored in the early 2000s to reflect its configuration of about 1910. After it re-entered service in December 2005, its classmate 5NBD, which in 1974 had been modified with a guard's compartment installed as well as carpet and a 2+1 seating arrangement, was refitted as a temporary kitchen car for use on the Lunch and Dinner services in conjunction with the NAL carriages.https://victoriancollections.net.au/media/collectors/52969eff2162ef171c566b9e/items/58b64382d0ce1d20ac069218/item- media/58b64416d0ce1d20ac06b201/VictorianCollections-medium.jpg The 2+1 cross- bench seats were removed and replaced with food preparation equipment. Prior to the use of 5NBD as the kitchen car, the Luncheon train consist generally ran with 2NBC at the Belgrave end. Walhalla Goldfields Railway As the Walhalla Goldfields Railway was re-opened long after Puffing Billy was established, rolling stock available for restoration was difficult to acquire. To overcome this, the railway constructed a new batch of narrow gauge vehicles based on the Victorian Railways designs and coded similarly, but with a \\"w\\" suffix. The vehicles were constructed on underframes recycled from coal wagons previously operated by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, so they are longer and wider than the equivalent Puffing Billy vehicles. NBW Two NBW carriages exist, approximating a wider, stretched version of the NBB/NB saloon type carriages with end platforms. Each seats 36 passengers. NBCW A single guards van was built for the Walhalla Goldfields Railway, featuring a 16-seat saloon area and a guards van similar to the layout of the NBDBD/NBC vans. NQRW One wagon was fitted out with a framework for supporting a temporary roof, similar to the original sheltered NQR design. In 2016 the wagon was remodelled and fitted with end-of-train equipment, allowing it to be substituted for the NBCW when necessary.http://www.walhallarail.com.au/download/pdf/AGM_2016_report_LO.pdf Railmotors The Walhalla Goldfields Railway has also acquired two former X1-class trams. In the short term, X1 461 is planned to be converted to function as a diesel-powered railmotor with capacity for 28 passengers and one wheelchair, and eventually X1 463 may be converted into a trailing unit.http://www.walhallarail.com.au/download/pdf/Community_News_APR2016_Hi.pdf References * Narrow Gauge Rolling Stock * Narrow Gauge Stock * Puffing Billy Railway Rolling Stock Category:Rolling stock of Victoria (Australia) ","title":"Victorian Railways narrow gauge passenger carriages and guards vans"},{"id":"57778944","text":"Hudson Yards is a real estate development in the Chelsea and Hudson Yards neighborhoods of Manhattan, New York City. Upon completion, 13 of the 16 planned structures on the West Side of Midtown South would sit on a platform built over the West Side Yard, a storage yard for Long Island Rail Road trains. The first of its two phases, opened in 2019, comprises a public green space and eight structures that contain residences, a hotel, office buildings, a mall, and a cultural facility. The second phase, on which construction has not started , will include residential space, an office building, and a school. Related Companies and Oxford Properties are the primary developers and major equity partners in the project. Related and Oxford, along with several large investors, have funded Hudson Yards' construction from a number of capital sources, including from foreign investors through the EB-5 investment program. Mitsui Fudosan owns a 92.09 percent stake in 55 Hudson Yards, and a 90 percent stake in 50 Hudson Yards. The architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox designed the master plan for the site, and architects including Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, Thomas Heatherwick, Foster + Partners, Roche-Dinkeloo, and Diller Scofidio + Renfro contributed designs for individual structures. Major office tenants include or will include fashion company Tapestry, consulting firm BCG, the new New York bureau for CNN, and urban-planning organization Sidewalk Labs. The site of Hudson Yards was initially intended for other developments, most notably in the early 2000s as the site of the West Side Stadium, during the New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The plans for Hudson Yards were developed after the failure of the West Side Stadium. Construction began in 2012 with the groundbreaking for 10 Hudson Yards, and the first phase opened on March 15, 2019. Both phases are projected to be complete by 2024. Agreements between various entities including the local government, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), and the state of New York made the development possible. The special zoning for Hudson Yards (an area roughly bound by 30th Street in the south, 41st Street in the north, 11th Avenue in the west, and Eighth Avenue in the east) further incentivized the building of other large-scale projects. Hudson Yards is adjacent but unrelated to Manhattan West, 3 Hudson Boulevard, and The Spiral. Site and structures The eastern portion of the site, developed as Phase 1, is located between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues. It contains three office towers on Tenth Avenue, two of which contain a retail podium between them. Phase 1 also includes The Shed performing arts center, a public plaza, the climbable Vessel sculpture, and three residential skyscrapers on Eleventh Avenue. The western portion of the site, Phase 2, is located between Eleventh and Twelfth Avenues. It is scheduled to contain additional office and residential space. 10 Hudson Yards 10 Hudson Yards The 52-story, 10 Hudson Yards is located at Tenth Avenue and 30th Street, along the southeastern corner of Phase 1. It opened in 2016 and is anchored by Coach Inc. Ground was broken for the building on December 4, 2012. It was the first of the Hudson Yards buildings to begin construction, because it was not built over railroad tracks. However, 10 Hudson Yards does straddle the High Line spur to Tenth Avenue. 10 Hudson Yards opened on May 31, 2016, and was the first structure in the Hudson Yards development to be occupied by tenants. Tenants include L'Oreal, Sidewalk Labs, and Coach. Early on during construction, Coach purchased a stake in the building, which was sold back to Related toward the end of construction. Kohn Pederson Fox designed the building. 15 Hudson Yards 15 Hudson Yards, originally proposed as Tower D, is located on Tenth Avenue and 30th Street, near Phase 1's southwestern corner. The building is connected to a semi- permanent structure, a performance and arts space known as The Shed. 15 Hudson Yards started construction in December 2014, was topped out in February 2018, and opened in early 2019. When completed, 15 Hudson Yards included 285 residential units. Its original design, with a pronounced \\"corset\\" at the middle of the tower's height, attracted attention. The Shed The Shed The Shed is an arts center housed in the Bloomberg Building, a three-story structure adjacent to 15 Hudson Yards. The space is focused on providing cultural programming, and is maintained by an organization of the same name. Its most prominent feature is a retractable \\"shell\\" that wraps around its roof and its northern and southern facades. The Shed opened on April 5, 2019. 30 Hudson Yards The 73-story, 30 Hudson Yards is located at Tenth Avenue and 33rd Street. It is the city's fourth-tallest building. It was designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox with an observation deck that juts into the air. Construction began after caissons were sunk to support the platform over the tracks, the latter of which was raised above ground level, at the same elevation as the High Line. 30 Hudson Yards opened on March 15, 2019. 35 Hudson Yards 35 Hudson Yards is located at Eleventh Avenue and 33rd Street. Construction on the building's foundation was started in January 2015, and it topped out in June 2018. 35 Hudson Yards opened on March 15, 2019. The mixed-use building contains 137 condominiums, an Equinox brand hotel, medical offices, and retail space. David Childs, the chairman of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, contributed the designs. 50 Hudson Yards Work on the -tall 50 Hudson Yards, located at Tenth Avenue between 33rd and 34th Streets, began in May 2018, with construction expected to be complete in 2022. BlackRock signed on as an anchor tenant, and is to occupy in the building, but Facebook will occupy more space with . Foster + Partners designed the building, which will rank as the fourth largest office tower in New York City in terms of available leaseable area when completed, with available to lease. Along with 55 Hudson Yards, it is one of two structures in the first phase not located above the rail yard. Mitsui Fudosan owns a 90 percent stake in the building, while Bank of China, Deutsche Bank, and Wells Fargo contributed financing for the tower. 55 Hudson Yards The 55 Hudson Yards, located at Eleventh Avenue between 33rd and 34th Streets, was designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox and Roche-Dinkeloo. 55 Hudson Yards started construction on January 22, 2015, and topped out in August 2017. Mitsui Fudosan owns a 92.09 percent stake in the building. Like 50 Hudson Yards, 55 is not located over the rail yard, and was not included in the original master plan as created by KPF. Cooley, a law firm, signed a lease to occupy across five stories. Another law firm, Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, will occupy . To lower costs and allow flexibility during the build, construction emphasized the use of concrete over steel. Two architectural firms, Kohn Pederson Fox and Roche Dinkeloo, were involved in the design of the building, which is the first collaborative effort between the two firms.  The Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards  Interior of the mall, seen in March 2019 Phase 1 also included a seven-story mall with 100 shops and 20 restaurants, called the Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards. It has of space, including in retail, including department stores. In September 2014, Neiman Marcus signed to become the anchor tenant of the Hudson Yards Retail Space. The retail space, designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox and Elkus Manfredi Architects with a connection to the bases of 10 and 30 Hudson Yards, started construction in June 2015, with a order of steel, one of the largest such orders in the history of the United States. The mall opened on March 15, 2019. The Neiman Marcus store occupies the top 3 levels and of the mall, or . Chef and restaurateur Thomas Keller has opened a restaurant in the complex, in addition to selecting 11 other restaurants in the retail space. There is fine dining on the fifth through seventh floors as well as more casual fare on the second through fourth floors. The mall is anchored by Dior and Chanel on the topmost floors, with \\"a 'Fifth Avenue' mix of shops\\", such as H&M;, Zara, and Sephora below them. The Neiman Marcus store is set to close in late 2020, having been open only for 16 months.  Public plaza  Vessel There is a public square, with 28,000 plants and 225 trees, on the platform. The public square is a ventilation area for the West Side Yards, as well as a storm water runoff site. Storm water that runs off into the square is reused throughout the development. Because it is located on top of an active rail yard, the public square is located over a deep plenum above a cooling slab with 15 fans blowing air at and a rainwater storage tank. The entire platform is supported by 234 caissons. The plantings are rooted within \\"smart soil\\". The plaza opened along with the mall on March 15, 2019. Vessel, a permanent art installation designed by Thomas Heatherwick, is located at the center of the plaza. The installation, a 16-story freestanding structure of connected staircases, cost US$150 million. Heatherwick took inspiration from Indian step wells in the design. Stephen M. Ross has compared the structure to the Eiffel Tower, and it has also been informally dubbed The Shawarma. Vessel opened on March 15, 2019. Neighboring projects Hudson Residences under construction in March 2019 The Hudson Yards development is directly west of the second largest project in the area: Manhattan West, a mixed-use multi-building development also built above previously exposed rail yards. Two large-scale, single-building office developments border the eastern portion of Hudson Yards. The larger, known as The Spiral, is owned by Tishman Speyer. The smaller development is known as 3 Hudson Boulevard. Several existing or planned residential buildings border Phase 1. Two are owned by Related, One Hudson Yards and Abington House, and are unrelated to the Hudson Yards project. 601 West 29th Street and 606 West 30th Street are under construction south of the two Related developments, and despite the involvement of two separate real estate companies, are being developed together due to their proximity. Another Related development also on the West Side dubbed \\"Hudson Residences\\" was under construction at the same time as Hudson Yards. The company co-owns a site with Spitzer Enterprises with plans to develop both residential and office space. History Older site proposals Several developers and other entities proposed uses for the rail yard during the 20th century. In 1956, William Zeckendorf suggested the construction of the \\"Freedom Tower\\", which would have risen , making it the tallest building in the world at the time. Transportation to the new complex would have been via a \\"passenger conveyor belt\\" from further east in Midtown. Zeckendorf never purchased the rights, as he was unable to secure financing for the deal, given that large-scale speculative real estate projects were not an asset class that institutional investors and lenders took interest in at the time. The administration of mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. released a $670 million development plan in 1963, which was ultimately never realized. In the 1980s, both the Jets and the Yankees proposed new stadiums above the rails, though none of these projects succeeded. Another ultimately unsuccessful plan for a new stadium for the Yankees was proposed above the West Side Yard in 1993. A similar plan for a Yankee stadium above the West Side Yard was proposed in 1996, and was endorsed by mayor Rudy Giuliani. However, the plan also received opposition from many other public figures, and was also not built. By the early 2000s, plans for the rail yard long included a new Olympics stadium, to become the home of the Jets after the games ended. Proposers dubbed the structure the \\"New York Sports and Convention Center\\". In addition to the stadium, rezoning the adjacent area would have incentivized the construction of some 13,000 new residential units and of office space. This effort, led by Daniel Doctoroff, was unpopular with the public and politicians. In January 2005, the New York City Council approved the 60-block rezoning, including the eastern portion of the West Side Yard. Michael Bloomberg, then the city's mayor, subsequently separated the city's broader rezoning plans from the rail yard stadium. In conjunction with the city, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a mixed-use development to be built on platforms over the rail yard, which would remain in use throughout. The MTA received three bids to cap and lease the rail yard. Cablevision (the owner of the nearby Madison Square Garden), the New York Jets organization, and TransGas Energy all submitted proposals. The Jets won the development rights, but several lawsuits filed after the bidding process alleged they won without paying a fair price. In June 2005, New York State Assembly speaker Sheldon Silver voted against the stadium, definitively eliminating the possibility of support at the state level and the possibility of the stadium's construction. Although Bloomberg and others expressed doubts about interest in the area from real estate companies after the stadium fell through, development nevertheless continued. The former mayor later expressed that the loss of the stadium may have been a \\"blessing\\" for New York. The MTA received proceeds from the development's 2006 bond offering to pay for an extension of the New York City Subway's to 34th Street‚ÄìHudson Yards station. With funding assured, the MTA proceeded quickly to construct the extension. The first construction contracts were awarded in October 2007, and the subway extension opened on September 13, 2015. Bidding process Hudson Yards seen from the 102nd floor of the Empire State Building, November 2018 In late 2006, the city and the MTA backed out of a plan for the city to purchase the development site, and created a proposal to seek bids from private developers. This was followed by a formal request for proposals in 2008 with the intention of creating a large-scale mixed-use development above the rail yards. Five developers responded to the RFP: Extell Development Company, Tishman Speyer, Brookfield, Vornado Realty Trust with the Durst Organization, and the Related Companies. =Submissions= Brookfield's Skidmore, Owings and Merrill-designed master plan known as \\"Hudson Place\\" and \\"Hudson Green\\" proposed constructing 15 towers (four office and 11 residential/hotel) that would range in height from to . The buildings would include of office space and 4,000 residential units, including 400 devoted to affordable housing. \\"Hudson Place\\" encompassed the office component covering the eastern portion of the railyards while \\"Hudson Green\\" was residential-focused and planned for the western railyards. Individual towers would have been designed by SHoP Architects, SANAA, Thomas Phifer, Handel Architects, and Diller Scofidio + Renfro. The development would have also included two hotels, a cultural center, school, two parks (4.4 acres for Hudson Green and 3.4 acres for Hudson Place), and of space for the Children's Museum of Manhattan. Durst and Vornado hired FXCollaborative and C√©sar Pelli to design a development named \\"Hudson Center\\" which would have included 13 towers ranging from to tall. The development would be split between of office space and 6,500 residential units, 600 of which would have been affordable. The developers also would have included 12 acres of open space and a subterranean people mover system connecting the complex to Penn Station. Media company Cond√© Nast agreed to anchor the development by taking all of office space in the largest office tower and move from their headquarters at Durst's 4 Times Square in 2015. Extell, in a master plan designed by Steven Holl, proposed 11 towers with just two featuring office space and the rest devoted to 3,812 residential units. The company's proposal also featured 19.5 acres of outdoor space including an outdoor amphitheatre and a sculpture garden named after Sol LeWitt. The company also would have built a new ferry terminal on the Hudson River as well as a Long Island Rail Road stop at the site. Extell's proposal was fundamentally different than the others as they proposed constructing a suspension deck over the rail yards similar to a suspension bridge rather than the truss structure every other developer proposed. Extell claimed this method would be more cost-effective but the suspension structure also would not have been strong enough to support large buildings. Due to this, all of Extell's proposed towers were clustered at the edges of the site in order to sit on solid ground while the deck itself would hold only the proposal's open spaces and park. Other unique aspects included a central reservoir to collect stormwater, a geothermal cooling system, and cogeneration which together would reduce energy use by almost 50%. Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Ada Louise Huxtable praised the proposal, writing that it \\"could have the unity, character and potential beauty of a Rockefeller Center.\\" The New York Times added to the praise, writing that the \\"proposal is the only one worth serious consideration.\\" Related's initial proposal envisioned 13 towers split between 3 office building and 10 residential structures. The company divided the space between of office space and 4,962 residential units. The towers would have varied in height from to and been designed by a diverse array of architects including Arquitectonica, Robert A. M. Stern, and Kohn Pedersen Fox. Proposed amenities included a school, winter garden, and 15.1 acres of open space. Related also secured a commitment from Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation to move their headquarters into one of the new office towers at the development. However, News Corporation later pulled out of the deal which led Related to bid only on the residential-focused Western railyard rather than the entire site. Due to this, the MTA disqualified the Related bid. Tishman Speyer's bid, designed by Helmut Jahn, covered 11 towers centered on four large office towers surrounded by seven smaller residential buildings. Two of the office towers would have stood at while the other two would be taller at with the accompanying residential buildings varying between and tall. The company's bid was the most office- focused with plans featuring of commercial space and 3,000 residential units. The proposed buildings would total over of space with 13 acres of open space and also include 379 units of affordable housing. Investment bank Morgan Stanley would have occupied all of office space in both the taller office towers as the company's headquarters and also would have provided equity and debt financing for the project. =Selection= Tishman Speyer, a New York- based real estate conglomerate, won the bid in March 2008. Tishman Speyer won a $1 billion bid to lease and cap the West Side Yard, with payment due as annual rent over a 99-year period. It would also spend another $2 billion for development over the rail yards, including for the two platforms over the yards to support of public spaces, four office buildings, and ten high-rise residential towers. Tishman had secured the investment bank Morgan Stanley as both an anchor tenant and financial backer. Two months later, the deal broke down when Morgan Stanley pulled out due to the late-2000s financial crisis. Subsequently, the MTA chose the Related Companies and Goldman Sachs to develop Hudson Yards under the same conditions. Related's revised plan included 13 buildings encompassing 12 million square feet of space including 2,154 rental apartments, 20% of which would be affordable. Other components included 2,619 condominiums, 5.5 million square feet () of offices, a hotel, about of retail, a school and a cultural facility. In December 2009, the New York City Council approved Related Companies' revised plan for Hudson Yards, and the western portion of the West Side Yard was rezoned. Following the rail yards' successful rezoning, the MTA signed another 99-year lease to the air rights over the rail yard in May 2010. The air rights were signed over to a joint venture of Related Companies and Oxford Properties Group, which invested $400 million to build a platform above both the eastern and western portions of the yard on which to construct the buildings. In April 2013, the Related/Oxford joint venture obtained a $475 million construction loan from parties including Barry Sternlicht's Starwood Capital Group and luxury retailer Coach. The financing deal was unique in several aspects, including the fact that it included a construction mezzanine loan, that Coach was a lender on both the debt and equity sides, and that the MTA reused a \\"severable lease\\" structure (previously used by Battery Park City) that allowed for the loans. A portion of the project was also financed by the EB-5 investment program, which uses capital from immigrants, who become eligible for a green card. Construction Hudson Yards under construction in 2015 The groundbreaking for 10 Hudson Yards, which was not built on the platform, occurred on December 4, 2012. At that event, the start of construction was also announced for 30 Hudson Yards. No tenants had been secured for any building in the complex when construction started on 10 Hudson Yards. However, three tenants‚ÄîL'Oreal, Coach, and SAP‚Äîwere announced in 2013. In October 2013, New York's Industrial Development Agency granted Related a $328 million tax exemption for 20 and 30 Hudson Yards, in addition to the previously approved $106 million exemption for 10 Hudson Yards. Shortly after, Related announced construction would begin on the platform covering the eastern railyards in January 2014 and cost $721 million. Construction on the platform began in March 2014 after Related secured a $250 million loan from Deutsche Bank. The erection of the platform was necessary in order to start construction on 15, 30, and 35 Hudson Yards. The platform for the Eastern Rail Yard was completed in October 2015, and the western platform was completed by 2016. In anticipation of the completion of the structures at Hudson Yards, the section of the High Line elevated park adjacent to the development opened in September 2014. After several delays in the completion of the 34th Street subway station, the station opened the following September. * * * However, the first building in the complex, 10 Hudson Yards, did not open until May 31, 2016. Groundbreaking occurred for 15 Hudson Yards in December 2014, and work on 35 Hudson Yards and 55 Hudson Yards both started the following month. Construction on The Shed, adjacent to 15 Hudson Yards, began in mid-2015 after its pilings were completed. A 16-story, honeycomb-shaped structure with stairwells named Vessel, in the center of Hudson Yards' public plaza, was unveiled to the public in September 2016. The pieces of Vessel were fabricated off-site and were brought to Hudson Yards for assembly starting in April 2017. Work on the final building in the first phase, 50 Hudson Yards, began in May 2018. Further construction, August 2018 55 Hudson Yards topped out in August 2017, while 15, 30, and 35 Hudson Yards all topped out in 2018. All four structures were opened on March 14, 2019, as were the Shed, shopping center, and Vessel. In addition, neither the High Line nor the 34th Street station were completed at the time of their respective openings. A second entrance to the 34th Street station was opened in September 2018, while the High Line spur adjacent to 10 Hudson Yards opened in June 2019. Labor disputes Higher costs for materials and land after the 2008 recession have caused real estate companies to seek lower labor costs. In New York City non-union labor has made inroads, although workers tend to have less training and experience. Douglas Durst, a real estate magnate in New York, has said \\"Related is leading the charge\\" among New York-based companies in employing non-union labor. Beginning in late 2017, unions working at the site alleged Related \\"continue[d] to look for deeper and deeper concessions\\" in their negotiations, and begin organizing a campaign referred to as \\"#CountMeIn\\". Related's push to change the site to an open shop would mostly affect the second phase of construction, on the western yard. The labor dispute is ongoing , though there have been meetings between labor leader Gary LaBarbera and Related executive Bruce Beal Jr. Future development The western portion of West Side Yard, visible in the foreground, is the site for the proposed Phase 2 The western portion of the yard is bordered by 30th Street and 33rd Street in the north and south, and Eleventh and Twelfth avenues in the east and west. The western phase of the project is to contain up to seven residential towers, an office building at 33rd Street and Eleventh Avenue tentatively known as \\"West Tower\\", and a school serving Pre-K to eighth grade students. The third phase of the High Line will traverse Phase 2 of the project. Work on the platform to cover the second half of the tracks was originally scheduled to begin in 2018, and Phase 2 was to have been completed by 2024. However, construction was later rescheduled to begin in 2019. Around $500 million of financing for Phase 2 was approved in mid-2018. , there is no set completion date for Phase 2. According to Architectural Digest magazine, Santiago Calatrava, Robert A.M. Stern Architects, Thomas Heatherwick, and Frank Gehry are involved in the design of the second phase's residential towers. Related Companies had previously commissioned works from Stern, Heatherwick, and Gehry. Eliot Spitzer and Related Companies received $276 million in loans for their 526-unit housing development in Hudson Yards. They plan to focus on \\"upscale urban senior living communities\\"; about a quarter of the new development will go towards senior living. Rail yard platform 30th Street staging area for construction equipment and materials The new platform upon which the Hudson Yards development is being built is bordered by 10th and 12th Avenues and by 30th and 33rd Streets. In 2014, it was expected to cost more than $20 billion and was projected to eventually see 65,000 visitors a day. Construction on the platform began in March 2014. Construction was overseen by Related Companies' executive vice president, Timur Galen. The Hudson Yards project was constructed over the existing at-grade West Side Yard, allowing LIRR trains to continue to be stored during midday hours. To minimize construction impact on the LIRR's ability to store trains during midday and peak hours, caissons were drilled into bedrock throughout much of the site, over which the platform was to be built. However, only 38% of the ground level at West Side Yard was to be filled in with columns to support the development. Much of the platform itself was built by a huge Manitowoc 18000 crane. The eastern platform, supporting the towers, comprises 16 bridges. The platform for the Eastern Rail Yard was completed in October 2015, and the western part of the platform was completed the following year. In 2013, Amtrak announced it would build a \\"tunnel box\\" through the project areas to reserve the space for a future rail right-of-way such as the proposed Gateway Project. Construction began September 2013 and took two years. The underground concrete casing is long, wide, and approximately tall. Financing and ownership Projected to cost $25 billion upon its completion, Hudson Yards is one of the most expensive real estate developments ever built in the United States, and the largest private development in the country's history. Under the terms of their agreement with Oxford, Related retains a 60 percent stake in the complex. Related is unusual among developers in that it retains ownership of the rental buildings it constructs and has a robust portfolio of affordable rental properties that provide consistent income. Initial funding came exclusively from Related and partner Goldman Sachs. After Goldman exited this arrangement, Related and its new partner, Oxford, secured a number of capital sources. These include conventional lenders, such as Wells Fargo, foreign investors through the EB-5 program, and a debt raise on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. $600 million of the project's financing has come from EB-5, making it the project to receive the most funding from the program. Other lenders include The Children's Investment Fund Foundation, Deutsche Bank, and Allianz. As of September 2017, Related had raised about $18 billion in funds. Related has also received or otherwise benefited from $6 billion in investments and tax breaks from the city in conjunction with Hudson Yards' construction. While The New York Times described the $6 billion as comprising numerous \\"tax breaks\\", a columnist for Crain's New York Business disputed this statement, saying, \\"There are two significant tax breaks which the New School totals at a little more than $1.36 billion\\", and that the rest of the investment was in infrastructure such as parks and the 7 Subway Extension. The $6 billion sum includes: * $1.6 billion given by Empire State Development Corporation to Hudson Yards. The agency, which distributes funding through geographical districts, classified Hudson Yards as being in the same \\"economically troubled area\\" as the sparsely populated Central Park and low-income housing developments in Harlem, thereby qualifying the project for EB-5 funds. * Funds for infrastructure projects that will serve the new development, including: ** $2.4 billion spent on the 7 Subway Extension project. ** $1.2 billion for Hudson Park and Boulevard. An additional $1 billion was given to other developers who were building nearby projects. Tenants A number of companies have moved their headquarters or New York City office to Hudson Yards or rival developments. These include financial firms, law firms, and miscellaneous technology, fashion, and media companies. 10 Hudson Yards is occupied by Coach, the Boston Consulting Group, and Sidewalk Labs. 30 Hudson Yards would be occupied by Time Warner, DNB Bank, Wells Fargo Securities, and Facebook once it opens. 50 Hudson Yards would also be occupied by Facebook. 55 Hudson Yards would be occupied by at least three law firms (Boies, Schiller & Flexner; Cooley LLP; and Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy), as well as by Facebook, electronic trading platform MarketAxess and pharmaceutical company Intercept Pharmaceuticals. The city has enticed large tenants to Hudson Yards by making them eligible for discretionary tax credits once they add a certain number of jobs there. Joe Patrice, writing for Above the Law, noted that with the move of Cooley LLP to 55 Hudson Yards from the Grace Building there was an \\"official trend\\" of law firms moving to the new office buildings on the far West Side. This move westward follows a trend from earlier in the 21st century, when firms began moving from parts of Midtown such as the Plaza District to Times Square and other areas with new office towers. A number of financial firms have left offices in Midtown or the Financial District for the development. As a result of speculation that private equity company KKR might move to Hudson Yards, other finance-focused companies became more interested in the possibility of relocating there. KKR's long-time occupancy at the Solow Building in Midtown produced a similar effect, as Apollo Global Management, Och-Ziff Capital Management, and Silver Lake Partners had also taken space in the Midtown building. KKR ultimately decided to move to 30 Hudson Yards; Silver Lake announced it would leave the Solow Building for 55 Hudson Yards in 2017 after speculation it would do so. BlackRock, another major financial company, signed on as an anchor tenant at 50 Hudson Yards, where it is to occupy . Equinox Fitness also operates the world's largest Equinox-branded gym at 35 Hudson Yards. The building also contains an Equinox-branded hotel. Related owns a majority stake in the fitness brand, purchased in 2005. Design Architectural critiques Kohn Pedersen Fox designed the site's master plan, as well as four individual buildings: 10, 30, and 55 Hudson Yards and the shopping center. Firms and individual architects working on distinct buildings did not meet to produce a uniform aesthetic or review the plans for individual buildings together. Two architects involved in the project, Thomas Woltz and Bill Pedersen, have respectively compared the relationship between the buildings to \\"mastodons, pineapples, sheds, swizzlesticks and bubble mats\\" and \\"elephants dancing\\". Justin Davidson, writing for New York, referred to 10 Hudson Yards (then known as the \\"Coach Tower\\") as \\"taller, fatter, and greener\\" than historical New York City skyscrapers, despite more staid interiors with typical open floor plans and corresponding curtain wall. New York Times architecture critic Michael Kimmelman called Hudson Yards a \\"gated community\\" catering to the upper-class, writing: \\"A relic of dated 2000s thinking, nearly devoid of urban design, it declines to blend into the city grid.\\" The Guardian architecture and design critic, Oliver Wainwright, said that \\"the real shock is that it's quite so bad\\", and that the new buildings represented \\"ungainly lumps\\", with the logic of design \\"presenting a mostly blank frontage of service hatches and lift lobbies to the city\\". Resilience Hudson Yards sits within Manhattan's 100-year floodplain, and the rail lines have previously been flooded despite preventative measures. Given that the bulk of the new structures would rise from an already elevated platform, the development is above the floodplain, and most mechanical systems are similarly raised. In addition, new elevator pits would be made waterproof. Klaus Jacob, a professor at Columbia University, has stated approval of the project stems from the \\"shortsightedness of decision-making\\" by its developers and the city in the face of impending climate change. In his 2017 novel New York 2140, author Kim Stanley Robinson mentions the inundation of the neighborhood by rising waters. Technology implementation The rail yard development was designed to be technologically advanced, in that the owners would collect all sorts of data within the buildings using sensors and other data-collecting instruments. The innovations included: * Air quality monitoring * Heat mapping to track crowd size and energy usage * Opt-in mobile apps to help collect data about users' health and activities * Pedestrian and vehicular traffic monitoring * Sensors collecting data about noise levels and energy and water usage * Energy savings using a microgrid * Organic and solid waste collection and recycling using pneumatic tubes installed by Envac, which operate at , making garbage trucks unnecessary New York University's Center for Urban Science and Progress designed the infrastructure with the developers of Hudson Yards. Fiber loops connected to satellite dishes on rooftops, to transponders, and to two-way radios would create a network covering the of open space as well as of commercial space. The technology was designed to be adaptable: updates to infrastructure would be performed as new technological advances are made.

Randolph collaborated with William Walker to seize control of Nicaragua in 1855 and 1856. In 1855, Randolph garnered the support of agents of the Accessory Transit Company to give in-kind aid to the filibuster of William Walker. Walker collaborated with the Liberal faction of Nicaragua's split-government to overthrow the Conservative faction and gain control of the country. Randolph, an old friend Walker's, hatched a plan to gain the cooperation of Cornelius K. Garrison and Charles Morgan of the Accessory Transit Company to provide transportation for mercenaries and supplies to Walker in Nicaragua. In exchange, Walker agreed to invalidate the old transit charter for Accessory Transit Company and reassign those rights to Randolph. Walker agreed to re-appropriate property of the Accessory Transit Company to Garrison and Morgan, while Randolph would sell the transit charter to them.

He was one of the most important Historians and Hispanists of the 20th century. He was born in Sundsvall, February the 17th 1908, and died in Gotemburg, November the 10th 1959. He started his career interested in Swedish military History but quickly got interested in the History of the Spanish Empire. He is most recognized for his work regarding The Spanish Black Legend. Bio Arnoldsson got his PhD from Gotemburg University in 1937. His thesis, Svensk-fransk krigs- och fresdapolitik i Tyskland 1634-1636 (‚ÄúThe policy of war and peace Swedish-German in Germany 1634-1636‚Äù. Gotemburg, 1937), was based around the Thirty Years War. Initially, his main interest was Swedish History, but through his thesis work he got fascinated with the Spanish Empire. Arnolsson was particularly interested in written expressions of history, such as archives, poems, and propaganda. His interest in Hispanic culture was mainly focussed on culture and literature. He is one of the authors that explored the Spanish Black Legend. In 1937 he got a position as assistant professor on that same year. In 1946 he compaginated his job as professor in the Vasa Institute of Gotemburg, and his collaboration with the Ibero-American institute. He won a Rockefeller scholarship to study in the Argentinan, Mexican, and USA¬¥s National Archives. This work was followed by various studies in Spain and Portugal in 1954 and 1958. His work during that time got him special recognition in Europe. In 1958 he was invited to Spain as a special Speaker during the celebration of the IV centenary of the death of Charles V.

History The union was founded in 1921, when the Association of Wireless Telegraphists merged with the Cable and Telegraph Operators' Association, forming the Association of Wireless and Cable Telegraphists. The majority of early members worked for the Marconi Company, Siemens Brothers, or the Radio Communication Company. The union was successful, and by 1922 it had about 4,500 members, and was a member of the Seafarers' Joint Council. It undertook a strike in 1922, which achieved agreement on a standard pay scale, and another in 1925 in opposition to a pay cut. However, it devoted much of its time to negotiating with the Engineering Employers' Federation. In 1937, the union renamed itself as the Radio Officers' Union. It affiliated to the Trades Union Congress in 1936, the Officers' (Merchant Navy) Federation in 1940, and the National Maritime Board in 1941. In 1967, the union lengthened its name to the Radio and Electronic Officers' Union, in light of it also admitting technicians. By this time, it had members in the Merchant Navy, and also on fishing vessels, oil rigs and related onshore industries. The union merged with the Merchant Navy and Airline Officers' Association and the Mercantile Marine Service Association in 1985, forming the National Union of Marine, Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers.

The death occurred in a case of mistaken identity. Public outrage arose when graphic video of the murder began to circulate on the Internet. Fourteen suspects, all members of the Trinitario gang, were arrested in connection with Guzman-Feliz's death.  Murder  On June 20, 2018, at 10:30 p.m. (EDT), 15-year-old Lesandro \\"Junior\\" Guzman-Feliz left his apartment to meet up with a friend. While out, he noticed four vehicles and became alarmed. He began to run and was chased for several blocks by gang members occupying the vehicles. Eventually, Guzman-Feliz sought refuge in a bodega at Bathgate Avenue and East 183rd Street in Belmont, Bronx, near his residence. Store owners and others witnessed the attack; but initially prevented Junior from hiding behind the counter because the owner did not understand what was happening. After recognizing Junior and seeing the fear on his face, the store owner then allowed Junior to hide behind the counter. Junior was soon spotted by one of the gang members and was dragged outside where three others were waiting. The incident was captured on CCTV video inside the shop, as well as on cell phone video taken from an overhead angle by a resident of one of the building's upper floors. The cell phone video shows a dozen or more males arriving and departing at the scene. Bodega surveillance footage shows several men stabbing Guzman-Feliz with large knives and machetes. The video shows Guzman-Feliz re-entering the store; however, he appeared to be sent outside. The video shows him stumbling out of the bodega and running east on 183rd Street toward St. Barnabas Hospital, a few blocks away. Cell phone footage showed Guzman-Feliz collapse on a step at a security booth near the hospital entrance. The video shows witnesses who knew the victim screaming frantically, holding cloths to his wounds, and attempting to console him as he died. Guzman-Feliz' death occurred only minutes after the attack at the bodega. Two police officers were standing nearby, but allegedly did little to help. According to the boyfriend of Guzman-Feliz's sister, a Trinitario gang leader stated on Snapchat that the killing was a case of mistaken identity. Initial reports indicated that the incident was sparked by a sex video involving a gang member's niece and a curly-haired male teenager, who looked very similar to Guzman-Feliz. The gang apologized for the killing to the victim's family on social media. In addition, the gang leader kicked the killers out of the gang as a result of this mistaken identity killing. Police indicated, though, that the alleged killers, all members of the Trinitarios subset \\"Los Sures\\", mistakenly believed that Guzman-Feliz was a member of the rival gang \\"Sunset\\". A hashtag, #justiceforjunior, was created and went viral on social media outlets such as Twitter and Instagram. Public outrage ensued when the graphic video of Guzman-Feliz's killing began to circulate on the Internet. Police tip lines received a \\"torrent\\" of calls from witnesses and other people identifying the suspects. Officers' posts on Twitter and Instagram were shared and viewed over 100,000 times.  Motive  The killing of Guzman-Feliz was purportedly a case of mistaken identity. Initial reports indicated that the killing was related to a sex video online that involved a gang member's niece and a curly-haired male teenager, who some thought looked like Guzman-Feliz. The police reported that the alleged killers, all members of the Trinitarios subset \\"Los Sures\\", mistakenly believed that Guzman-Feliz was a member of the rival \\"Sunset\\" gang. Bronx County District Attorney Darcel Clark said that Guzman-Feliz had no ties to any gang activity.  Victim  Lesandro Guzman-Feliz (November 11, 2002 ‚Äì June 20, 2018), known as \\"Junior\\", was 15 years old at the time of his death. His family included: his father, Lisandro Guzman; his mother, Leandra Feliz; his older sister, Genesis Collado-Feliz; and his brother, Manuel Ortiz. He attended the Dr. Richard Izquierdo Health & Science Charter School, where he was a sophomore. He was of Dominican descent. Lesandro Guzman-Feliz memorial at the corner of Bathgate Avenue and 183rd Street. Guzman-Feliz aspired to become a detective and was a member of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) Explorers program, a group for youths interested in law enforcement careers. His funeral, at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in the Bronx, was attended by thousands. Pallbearers were attired in New York Yankees jerseys as a nod to Guzman-Feliz's favorite baseball team. He was interred in Saint Raymond's Cemetery in the Bronx. After his death, the NYPD established a scholarship in Guzman-Feliz's name. The corner of Bathgate Avenue and 183rd Street, where Guzman-Feliz was killed, was ceremonially renamed \\"Lesandro Junior Guzman-Feliz Way\\" in February 2019, on his mother's birthday.  Perpetrators and suspects  Memorial to Lesandro Guzman-Feliz across the street from the St. Barnabas Hospital entrance. Fourteen suspects were arrested in connection with Guzman-Feliz's death. All were members of the Dominican gang Trinitario and between the age of 18 and 29. * Kevin Alvarez, age 19 * Luis Cabrera-Santos, age 25 * Danel Fernandez, age 21 * Elvin Garcia, age 23 * Antonio Rodriguez Hernandez, age 24 * Jonaiki Martinez-Estrella, age 24 * Jose Muniz, age 21 * Danilo Payamps-Pacheco, age 21 * Gabriel Ramirez- Concepcion, age 26 * Manuel Rivera, age 18 * Diego Suero, age 29 * Jose Taverez, age 21 * Fredrick Then, age 20 * Ronald Ure√±a, age 29 Police alleged Suero to be the ringleader, who ordered the murder of Guzman-Feliz. Officers also claimed that Martinez-Estrella delivered the fatal blow to Guzman-Feliz. Four of the suspects (Fernandez, Muniz, Rivera, and Hernandez) were incarcerated at Rikers Island and received death threats, even from other members of the Trinitario gang, while awaiting trial. As such, they were segregated from other prisoners and received heightened security protection at the jail. Michael Sosa Reyes, a former suspect, was a cooperating witness.  Trial verdict  Nearly a full year after Guzman-Feliz was brutally slain outside of the Bronx bodega, five accused suspects were convicted of his murder. In a Bronx courtroom on June 14, 2019, a jury convicted Jonaiki Martinez Estrella, Manuel Rivera, Elvin Garcia, Jose Muniz, and Antonio Rodriguez Hernandez of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, gang assault, and conspiracy. By also convicting the defendants of first-degree murder, the jury acknowledged that Guzman-Feliz was tortured before his death.

Season Summary Dundee player Paul McGowan admitted in court to spitting on a bouncer after leaving a nightclub after the previous seasons awards. Dens manager Neil McCann admitted there was \\"No positives\\" to take from the defeat in their second League Cup group match to Dunfermline Athletic in which they lost 1‚Äì0. Dundee were knocked out of the Second Round of the League Cup by Ayr United with manager Neil McCann saying the \\"3-0 scoreline probably flattered us.\\" Neil McCann said it was a \\"sore one to take\\" after Dundee's loss against Hibernian, their sixth straight league loss leaving them pointless at the bottom of the league. On 16 October, McCann was sacked from his role, taking assistant manager Graham Gartland with him and leaving the club bottom of league with 7 defeats in 8 league matches. On 17 October, the club announced Jim McIntyre as their new manager. Jim would have a poor start to his stint as Dundee manager, where the team lost 4 games in a row, conceding 13 goals and scoring none in that space. Starting with a home draw against relegation rivals St Mirren, Dundee would go on an unbeaten streak, coming back from 2 goals down to draw at Easter Road and earning a decisive 4-0 victory over Hamilton Accies.

Dundee also crashed out of the Scottish Cup with a 3-0 defeat in a replay away to Queen of the South.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46955342 Dundee ended the pre- split fixtures by losing 7 matches, the joint worst run throughout the League season.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47756964 This losing run continued after the split, and the club were relegated on 4 May in a 1-0 loss to Hamilton Academical with ex-Dundee United player Tony Andreu scoring the winner in the 83rd minute after a penalty was conceded by Ryan McGowan. This loss marked their tenth in a row, the worst run of defeats in the Premiership in 15 years. On 12 May, Jim McIntyre and assistant manager Jimmy Boyle were sacked by the club. Ex-player and reserve team coach James McPake was named as interim manager for the final game against St Mirren. Darren O'Dea would also play his final professional game against St Mirren, but would be sent off just 22 minutes into the game, in what would finish as a 2‚Äì3 defeat.

The single was released via YouTube, streaming and digital download on June 27, 2018. The lyrics and music were written by Alice In Chains' co-lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist William DuVall, who also played the guitar solo in the song. Origin \\"So Far Under\\" is the first Alice in Chains song written entirely by William DuVall, and the first in the band's catalog written entirely by someone other than Jerry Cantrell or Layne Staley. DuVall said about the song in a press release: Release and reception The song was released on Alice in Chains' official YouTube channel on June 27, 2018, and it is also available for streaming and digital download via Spotify, iTunes, Amazon Music, Apple Music, Google Play and Deezer. Revolver magazine said that the song \\"finds the band leavening their signature grunge with dreary, hypnotic grooves reminiscent of Electric Wizard\\". For Loudwire, \\"the track, heard seems to be a perfect fit for the Alice catalog, with a familiar guitar and drum sound. \\"So far under / Too much pain to tell / Now I'm ripped asunder / So far under,\\" come the hypnotically-delivered lyrics of the chorus over evil sounding guitars.\\" The song peaked at No. 3 on Amazon's Best Sellers in Rock, and at No. 23 on Amazon's Top 100 Paid Songs. Music video The music video for \\"So Far Under\\" was released on Alice In Chains' YouTube channel on June 6, 2019. It was directed by Adam Mason and continues the storyline that started with the music video for Rainier Fog's first single, \\"The One You Know\\". The video for \\"So Far Under\\" is the eighth episode of the sci-fi series Black Antenna, which tells the story of father and daughter named Alpha and Beta, two aliens disguised as humans who drive across California in silence, speaking only telepathically. Along the way, the daughter seduces men and steals from them to help her father build an antenna so that he can send a message to their people at home. At the same time, they are being tracked down by evil forces and must avoid being killed. Written by Adam Mason and Paul Sloan, the video stars Paul Sloan as Alpha, Viktoriya Dov as Beta, Darri Ingolfsson as Nil and Lily Robinson as Malum. Live performances Alice in Chains performed the song live for the first time during their concert at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre in Vancouver, Canada on August 22, 2018.

She is known for her support of her spouse in the fight for an independent Ukraine during the Great Northern War and took responsibility for his affairs during his diplomatic missions in Europe. She joined him in exile and lived in Sweden in 1709‚Äì21, during which she corresponded with several rulers in Europe to support her husband's cause. She was the daughter of Pavlo Semenovych Hertsyk.  Biography  Hanna Hertsyk was born to a noble Kozak starshyna family with Jewish roots. She was the daughter of Pavlo Semenovych Hertsyk, a Poltavan colonel and General Osavul, and his wife Iryna Yablons\`ka. In 1698, she married Pylyp Orlyk, the chancellor (–ø–∏—Å–∞—Ä, lit. scribe) for the Poltava regiment. This marriage contributed to Orlyk's career: through marriage, Hanna brought him villages in the Starodub, Chernihiv and Poltava regions, which allowed him to become a wealthy magnate. She supported the political views of her husband about separation from the Tsardom of Muscovy. Following the turning of Mazepa against Peter I in 1708 and the defeat of the Swedes and Ukrainians at the Battle of Poltava in 1709, the Orlyks, along with Mazepa and the Zaporozian starshyna, were forced to emigrate. In exile her husband was elected Hetman after the death of Mazepa. Anna had already given birth to three sons by 1711, one of whom was the godson of the Swedish king Charles XII (Yakiv), and the other - Ivan Mazepa (Hryhor). During their exile, it was Hanna who assumed most of the responsibility for the children (their family by now numbered seven) while Pylyp traveled all over Europe in search of international support for the liberation of Ukraine and the unification of its two parts. Hanna was a bedrock for the Hetman in the Ottoman Empire, Sweden, and Germany. Hanna gave birth to her daughter Maria on the Swedish island of R√ºgen. Hanna stayed with her family in Kristianstad for a long time. On October 11, 1720, the Orlyks left Sweden. Hanna first traveled to Hannover, then to Wroc≈Çaw, where she and her children hid in a monastery from Muscovite spies. In 1721, her son Yakiv suddenly died. For a while she lived with her daughters, Varvara and Maria, in Stanislaviv.

The day commemorates 7 October 1949, when the German Democratic Republic was constituted on the territory of the Soviet Occupation Zone, almost half a year after the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany after the adoption of the Basic Law on 23 May 1949. It was immediately led by a government formed by the ruling communist party, known locally as the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) (formed in April 1946). This solidified the 1945 division of Germany and the two states' different political systems. The first major celebrations took place in 1959 on the GDR's 10th anniversary. It was replaced in 1990 by German Unity Day, which is today celebrated on 4 October, three days before the GDR's Republic Day.www.verfassungen.de ‚Äì East German law on introducing the holidays \\"Day of Liberation\\" and \\"Day of the Republic\\" (1950) (\\"Gesetz √ºber die Einf√ºhrung der Feiertage \\"Tag der Befreiung\\" und \\"Tag der Republik\\"\\").

The most prominent Republic Day celebrations have taken place in 1974, 1979https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/08/archives/east-germans-display-might-in- big-parade-west-protests-military.html and 1989, at the 25th, 30th and 40th anniversaries respectively. Since this military presence was in contrast to Berlin's Four Powers status, the military parades led regularly to protest notes of the Western Powers. The last military parade took place in 1989. Also a fleet review of the Volksmarine took place. The parade had been always led by the parade commander who had the rank of a Colonel General and the position of Chief of the Land Forces. From 1972, when that post was created, up to 1989, that was held by Col Gen Horst Stechbarth, who was the parade commander during those years. After his arrival and the report of the superintendent of the Friedrich Engels Military Academy, he took his post nearest the Massed Bands of the Military Music Service of the National People's Army and the Corps of Drums of the Central Band of the NPA. The 25th anniversary parade in 1974. This parade was held in the presence of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. At 10 am, after the arrival of state and political leaders, the bells ring and the bands sounded a fanfare, after which the parade commander had ordered the parade to present arms and eyes left as it rendered honors to the Minister of Defence, a position held by a General of the Army. As the bands were playing the Pr√§sentiermarsch der Nationalen Volksarmee the PC and the Minister of Defense salute as their automobiles approached each other and the bands paused, with the former reporting of the readiness of the troops for the parade. The music was then resumed at the signal of the Drum Major of the Massed Bands and the Band Conductors, and the PC and the Minister first inspected the mobile column, then the bands and lastly the ground column. After the inspection, the vehicle of the parade commander returned to his first position as the Minister's vehicle stopped in order that he would depart the said vehicle and then proceed to the reviewing stand to inform the General Secretary of the SED and President of the Council of State on the readiness of the parade to march past. Following the report, the national anthem Auferstanden aus Ruinen was played, after which the parade commander ordered the parade to prepare for the march past in quick time, first to the tune of Marsch der Elisabether as the bands position for the march past, and later, following the fifes and drums, to the tune of the Parademarsch ‚Ññ 1 der Nationalen Volksarmee as the bands march in position in front of the grandstand.

It was made official in 1981 after it was introduced in 1962 and was updated from the Prussian version, to adjust for the addition of \\"elements of the progressive military inheritance\\" which included Soviet compositions and a medley of German and international working-class songs and marches. It also included a torchlight procession, an opening fanfare, and the presentation of the NVA Colors.

It was a precipitating factor leading to the Sand Creek massacre of November 29, 1864. Background The Hungate family moved to the area, about 25 miles southeast of Denver, about March of 1864. The Hungates included Nathan, his wife Ellen, and daughters, Laura and Florence. They lived on the ranch of Issac Van Wormer, who employed Nathan as the ranch manager. The ranch was located just south of the County Line Road between Araphaoe-Elbert counties, east of Running Creek, and north of the town of Elizabeth. Prior to that, in 1861, the Treaty of Fort Wise was made with Native American tribes in Colorado Territory to restrict their access to their hunting grounds, relocate to a reservation, and grow crops in exchange for provisions. There were periods of crop failures, however, and the government did not honor its agreement to provide provisions. Tribes began stealing food and livestock. In April 1864, John Evans, the territorial governor, called for Colonel John Chivington, commander of the 1st Regiment of Colorado Volunteers to \\"kill Cheyenne wherever or whenever found,\\" without determining whether or not they were guilty. The cavalry killed innocent women, children, and men, which resulted in retaliatory raids against settlers in Colorado and Kansas. Attack On June 11, Nathan rode out with a hired hand, Mr. Miller, looking for stray heads of cattle. Several miles from the ranch, they saw smoke coming from the area of Hungate's cabin and suspected an attack by Native Americans. Miller said that he was riding for Denver and advised Hungate that his family was likely dead and if he went back to the cabin he would be killed, too. Hungate rode back to find that his cabin was on fire and his family had been killed and badly mutilated. He was captured and was similarly killed. The couple was in their twenties, Laura was 2 1/2 years of age, and Florence was a 6-month-old infant. Miller made it to Denver and gave news of the attack to Van Wormer, who rode to the ranch to find the Hungate family dead. Nathan Hungate's body was badly mutilated with 80 bullets, and was found a distance from the house. The bodies of Ellen and the two girls were found mutilated, bound together, and thrown into a shallow well. All of the family's stock had been taken and the buildings were burned down. Aftermath Recruiting poster for Chivington‚Äôs 100-day men On June 13, the Hungate family's bodies were taken by Van Wormer to Denver and put on public display, creating anger and inciting revenge for the attacks presumed to be by Native Americans. An inquest was held on June 14, which resulted in a decision that they were killed by unknown people, likely Native Americans. It was speculated that they may have been members of the Arapaho or Cheyenne tribes. Jim Beckwourth, an experienced frontiersman, postulated that the manner of death was not consistent with either the Cheyenne or Arapaho, according to an article in Daily Commonwealth dated June 15. Others later believed that the attack was made by members of the Arapaho tribe. Residents of Denver were frightened and wanted revenge. Citizens took it upon themselves to attack Native Americans, which resulted in retaliatory reactions predominately from Cheyenne and Arapaho people. A 100-day volunteer cavalry was authorized by the U.S. War Department on August 11 and Colonel John Chivington was put in command. On November 29, Chivington led an attack on a Cheyenne and Arapaho encampment called the Sand Creek massacre. Van Wormer gave up the ranch, and after it reverted to the government, it was purchased by Frank Girardot. After four burials, the family was finally buried at Fairmont Cemetery in Denver in June 1892. In 1939, the Pioneer Women of Colorado erected a monument in Elbert County to the Hungates and the Dietemann family, who was shot and scalped in 1868. The monument is located in front of the Elbert County Courthouse in Kiowa, Colorado.

He showed very good form as a two-year-old in 1894, winning the Bedford Stakes, July Stakes and Lavant Stakes as well a finishing second in the Dewhurst Stakes and fourth in the Middle Park Plate. In the following year he won the 2000 Guineas and finished a close third in the Epsom Derby but was never as good thereafter, failing to win again and being retired at the end of 1896. He later stood as a breeding stallion in Germany with limited success. Background Kirkconnel was a bay horse bred in the United Kingdom by Lady Stamford. As a yearling he was offered for sale and bought for 520 guineas by the Australian sportsman William C. Cooper. The colt was sent into training with George Blackwell in Newmarket, Suffolk. He was sired by Royal Hampton who won the National Breeders' Produce Stakes and City and Suburban Handicap as well as finishing third in the Epsom Derby. Kirkconnel's dam Sweet Sauce was a descendant of the Warwick Mare, relating her to several major winners including Gladiateur. Racing career 1894: two-year-old season John Blundell Maple, who bought Kirkconnel in 1894 Kirkconnel showed early promise when winning the Bedford Two-Year-Old Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in May, beating the subsequent 1000 Guineas winner Galeottia, and then running third behind the fillies Kissing Cup and Cheery in the New Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. In the July Stakes at Newmarket on 3 July Kirkconnel started odds-on favourite and was an easy winner, coming home two lengths clear of the filly Golden Blaze. On his next appearance Goodwood Racecourse on 1 August Kikconnel started 5/6 favourite for the Lavant Stakes and won by a length from Curzon. Following this performance he was described as a potential Epsom Derby winner. On 11 October at Newmarket Kirkconnel started 3/1 favourite for the Middle Park Plate but finished fourth behind Speedwell, Keelson and Raconteur. Two weeks later at the same track Kirconnel finished second to Raconteur in the seven furlong Dewhurst Plate. Kirkconnel ended the season with earnings of ¬£3,120. At the end of the year the colt returned to the sales ring and was bought for 5,000 guineas by John Blundell Maple. Maple moved the horse to the stable of his private trainer Percy Peck and also made a small change in spelling: the colt had previously been known as Kirkconell, but after his acquisition by Maple he was officially renamed Kirkconnel prompting a comment that he was now owned by \\"a man who knows how to spell\\". 1895: three-year- old season John Watts,who rode Kirkconnel to victory in the 2000 Guineas In early 1895 J. Day replaced Percy Peck as Maple's private trainer and took over the training of Kirkconnel. On 1 May, Kirkconnel, ridden by John Watts and equipped with blinkers, started at odds of 10/1 in an eight-runner field for the 87th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile. Raconteur started favourite while the best fancied of the other runners were Speedwell, Sir Visto and Laveno. Kirkconnel was restrained towards the rear of the field for most of the way before moving into fourth place behind Sir Visto, Raconteur and Laveno two furlongs from the finish. He produced a strong late run to take the lead well inside the final furlong and won by a length from Laveno, with two lengths back to Sir Visto in third. His winning time of 1:42.4 eualled the track record set by Isinglass in 1893. Although the colt won in \\"fine style\\", Watts was not very enthusiastic after the race, commenting \\"the best-trained horse won. One of the others might do better next time\\". The immediate aftermath of the race Kirkconnel was elevated to favouritism for the Derby Stakes and he was expected to confirm his position when he started 5/4 favourite for the ten-furlong Newmarket Stakes on 15 May. He failed to live up to expectations however and finished fourth of the seven runners behind his unfancied stablemate The Owl. In the Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse two weeks later Kirkconnel was ridden by Walter Bradford and started at odds of 100/8. He made steady progress to join the leaders two furlongs out and kept on well to finish third of the fifteen runners, beaten three quarters of a length and half a length by Sir Visto and Curzon. On 9 June he was sent to France to contest the Grand Prix de Paris over 3000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse but made no impact and finished unplaced behind the filly Andree. At the end of June he was narrowly beaten when attempting to concede 22 pounds to the four-year-old Pomade Royale in the Clarence and Avondale Stakes Handicap at Sandown Park. 1896: four-year-old season Kirkconnel remained in training as a four-year-old in 1896 but recorded no major victories. On 22 April at Epsom he finished unplaced under 122 pounds in the City and Suburban Handicap after being boxed against the rails for most of the race. In June he ran for the second time in the Clarence and Avondale Handicap over nine furlongs in which he finished unplaced under top weight and early in the following month he came home last of eleven behind St Frusquin in the Princess of Wales's Stakes. At Newmarket in October he ran unplaced behind Persimmon in the Jockey Club Stakes. Stud record At the end of his racing career Kirkconnel was bought as a potential breeding stallion by the German Government and exported. He began his stud career in Germany but had little success with the best of his offspring probably being the non-Thoroughbred colt Baron Kiki who finished third in the 1906 Deutsches Derby. Kirkconnel died in November 1916 at the Neu-Colln Stud in Germany. Pedigree *Kirkconnel was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Pocahontas, meaning that this mare appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

The concept that it denotes, which imagines the financier as a modern-day Viking, has been the subject of extensive scholarly research investigating its relationship with Icelandic nationalism and the causes of the 2008‚Äì2011 Icelandic financial crisis.  Literal meaning  √öt means 'out'; r√°s, in this context, means 'a rush, race, sprint, expansion'; and √∫tr√°s correspondingly means outward rush. This term √∫tr√°s was used in Icelandic to denote Icelanders' acquisitions of foreign assets during the early twenty-first century banking boom. This word has often been rendered into English in the Icelandic media using the calque outvasion. An √∫tr√°sarv√≠kingur is, then, an 'outvasion viking' or, more loosely, 'raiding viking'.Eirikur Bergmann, _Iceland and the International Financial Crisis: Boom, Bust and Recovery_ (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 6. It has also been rendered 'venture viking' (in a reference to venture capital).Katla Kjartansd√≥ttir, ‚ÄòThe new Viking wave: Cultural heritage and capitalism‚Äô, Iceland and images of the North, ed. Sumarli√∞i R. √çsleifsson (Qu√©bec, 2011), pp. 461‚Äì80 (p. 471).  Cultural meaning  The idea of the √∫tr√°sarv√≠kingar has been seen as an important example of medievalism and nationalism in Icelandic culture, adverting to the imagined golden age of the Settlement of Iceland, during which Iceland is popularly imagined to have been a free and just society.Eirikur Bergmann, Iceland and the International Financial Crisis: Boom, Bust and Recovery (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 6.Cf.

The most prominent commentator on these lines before the collapse of Iceland's banks was Krist√≠n Loftsd√≥ttir, who argued that by appealing to powerful nationalist sentiments in Icelandic culture, the image of the √∫tr√°sarv√≠kingur helped to shield risk-taking financiers from criticism.Krist√≠n Loftsd√≥ttir, ‚Äò√ötr√°s √çslendinga og hnattv√¶√∞ing hins √æj√≥√∞lega: Horft til Silv√≠u N√¶tur og Magna‚Äô, Riti√∞: T√≠marit Hugv√≠sindastofnunar 1 (2007), pp. 149‚Äì76.

History of the term  The term v√≠kingur traditionally simply meant 'pirate' in Icelandic, but in √∫tr√°sarv√≠kingur referred to vikings, a figment of modern constructions of the medieval past, imagined as ethnically Scandinavian, manly, and nobly savage. The term seems to have been coined quite late in the Icelandic banking boom: the earliest attestation in the online corpus of Icelandic newspapers and periodicals T√≠marit.is comes from June 1, 2005.Alaric Hall, ‚ÄòFornaldars√∂gur and Financial Crisis: Bjarni Bjarnason‚Äôs Mannor√∞‚Äô, in The Legendary Legacy: Transmission and Reception of the ‚ÄòFornaldars√∂gur Nor√∞urlanda‚Äô, ed. by Matthew Driscoll, Silvia Hufnagel, Philip Lavender and Beeke Stegmann, The Viking Collection, 24 (Odense: University Press of Southern Denmark, 2018), pp. 351-75 (p. 354 n. 10), citing ‚ÄòPeningask√°purinn ...‚Äô, Fr√©ttabla√∞i√∞ 5/146 (1 June 2005), p. 22. It seems to have been inspired by English-language news reporting figuring Icelandic financiers as Vikings, and it has been suggested that 'origins of the term lie primarily in language of violent masculinity developed on Wall Street around the beginning of the 1980s and soon adopted into everyday English ‚Äî usages such as \\"to make a killing\\", meaning \\"to make a lot of money\\".'Alaric Hall, ‚ÄòFornaldars√∂gur and Financial Crisis: Bjarni Bjarnason‚Äôs Mannor√∞‚Äô, in The Legendary Legacy: Transmission and Reception of the ‚ÄòFornaldars√∂gur Nor√∞urlanda‚Äô, ed. by Matthew Driscoll, Silvia Hufnagel, Philip Lavender and Beeke Stegmann, The Viking Collection, 24 (Odense: University Press of Southern Denmark, 2018), pp. 351-75 (p. 353).  Appearances in popular culture  A number of novelists wrote works satirising the medievalist pretensions of the √∫tr√°sarv√≠kingar, particularly by reimagining the √∫tr√°sarv√≠kingar not as vikings but as feudal knights. They include Bjarni Har√∞arson (Sigur√∞ar saga f√≥ts: √çslensk riddarasaga), B√∂√∞var Gu√∞mundsson (T√∂frah√∂llin), and Andri Sn√¶r Magnason (T√≠makistan). Meanwhile, Bjarni Bjarnason subverted Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Thor Bj√∂rg√≥lfsson's enthusiasm for identifying himself with the god √û√≥r by associating him instead with the more sinister god √ì√∞inn in Mannor√∞.Alaric Hall, ‚ÄòFornaldars√∂gur and Financial Crisis: Bjarni Bjarnason‚Äôs Mannor√∞‚Äô, in The Legendary Legacy: Transmission and Reception of the ‚ÄòFornaldars√∂gur Nor√∞urlanda‚Äô, ed. by Matthew Driscoll, Silvia Hufnagel, Philip Lavender and Beeke Stegmann, The Viking Collection, 24 (Odense: University Press of Southern Denmark, 2018), pp. 351-75 (pp. 355-66).

Education and career Born in Washington, Illinois, Tully attended the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, from which he received his B.S. in 1976 and his Ph.D. in 1981. At the University of Illinois, he studied under Jerry Hirsch, and helped to prepare Hirsch for his debates on race and intelligence with William Shockley. He then did postdoctoral research at Princeton University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before joining the faculty of Brandeis University as an assistant professor in 1987. He began working at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) in 1991 as an associate professor, where he was subsequently named Professor in 1995 and Head of the Division of Neurogenetics in 2006. In 1997, he and James Watson founded Helicon Therapeutics, Inc., with the aim of creating a pharmaceutical drug to enhance human memory. Tully served as its acting Chief Science Officer until it merged with Dart Neuroscience in 2012. In 2007, he resigned his position at CSHL to become Chief Science Officer at Dart Neuroscience. Research Tully is known for his research identifying genes that affect memory in the fruit fly species Drosophila melanogaster. In 1995, Tully and his CSHL colleague Jerry Yin made headlines when they genetically engineered a Drosophila fly that displayed the equivalent of a photographic memory. They did so by breeding flies with a mutated form of the CREB gene to produce many more activator proteins than it normally would, thereby allowing the flies to store more long-term memories. Through his company Helicon, Tully subsequently began working to develop a drug to raise levels of the CREB protein, in the hope that it would improve memory in humans. In 2004, Tully and his CSHL colleagues developed HT-0712, a drug that aims to improve memory in people with dementia. At the time, Tully suggested that it could also be used by healthy people to help them remember how to play a new musical instrument or speak a new language.

In the book, President Jack Ryan and The Campus must contain a massive intelligence breach that has been responsible for a series of terrorist attacks on American military and intelligence personnel. True Faith and Allegiance is Greaney's last book in the Jack Ryan series, which is part of the Tom Clancy universe. It debuted at number three on the New York Times bestseller list. Plot summary Romanian hacker Alexandru Dalca obtains an old copy of the e-QIP database, which contains personal information on millions of American military and intelligence personnel. The Chinese originally hire him to use the stolen information in order to locate U.S. spies in their country. However, Dalca uses this treasure trove of information to make a profit by building targeting packages on specific individuals. This attracts the attention of Saudi technocrat Sami bin Rashid, who wanted to provoke the United States into a quagmire in the Middle East fighting ISIS, which would then recoup the loss of profit in Saudi oil. After making contact with Dalca through the dark web, Bin Rashid meets with ISIS operative Abu Musa al Matari and formulates a plan to attack American military and intelligence personnel, using the targeting packages compiled by Dalca himself, in order to further his plan. Al Matari then recruits cleanskins and assigns them into cells to carry out the attacks. The video recordings of the assaults are then uploaded to the Islamic State's propaganda site, promoting the terror organization, garnering new followers, and inspiring a series of copycat attacks. The intelligence community quickly becomes concerned about the wave of attacks on American intelligence and military personnel, and scramble to find the source. President Jack Ryan is then pressured by the media and elements in his own government to deploy troops into the Middle East to battle the Islamic State, but persistently refuses to do so by gathering intelligence, knowing that Islamic State is provoking him. Meanwhile, the understaffed The Campus recruits two new members: previously director of transportation Adara Sherman and ex-Delta Force operator Bartosz ‚ÄúMidas‚Äù Jankowski. They also investigate the attacks, and later deduce that the e-QIP database may have been compromised. Jack Ryan Jr. looks into a particular, seemingly unrelated attack on Scott Hagen, who is the commander of the guided missile destroyer USS James Greer, from the brother of a Russian submarine crew killed by Hagen in a recent battle in the Baltic Sea (depicted in Commander in Chief). After looking into the assailant's social media, he finds out that Dalca provided information on Hagen prior to the attack. With this information on hand, The Campus heads to Romania. In the meantime, the Chinese get suspicious about Dalca not following their orders. The hacker assumes the same thing, and when the Chinese come looking for him in his place of work, he escapes, intending to leave Romania. The Campus, who are surveilling the Romanian nearby, joins in the chase and get involved in a shootout with the Chinese, killing them, but Dalca is nowhere to be found. The Campus later finds out about Dalca's plans to leave the country, and abduct him at an airport. He decides to cooperate in stopping al Matari; Ryan presents himself as a target, staying in an isolated cabin in a Maryland forest. Al Matari takes the bait and is easily captured, while the rest of his henchmen are killed in the ensuing firefight. The headquarters of the Islamic State's propaganda wing was later destroyed in an airstrike. The Americans betray Dalca to Chinese security agents, but his fate is left unknown. Meanwhile, Bin Rashid was killed by The Campus in a plane headed for Australia.

History  At the request of Qvarqvare III‚Äôs son Kaikhosro, the Ottoman Empire invaded Imereti. By orders of Ottoman Sultan beylerbey of Erzurum, Musa Pa≈üa also known as Kizil-Ahmedlu, was sent to Samtskhe with 22,000 men to conquer the surrounding area. Ottoman army equipped by European cannons besieged the Georgian-garrisoned fortress of Oltisi (now Oltu, Turkey). Bagrat called upon the neighboring Georgian potentates to come to aid. Only the prince of Guria Rostom Gurieli responded, while the prince of Mingrelia, Levan I Dadiani, refused to participate in the alliance, and later sided with the Ottomans, even traveling to Istanbul, where he received gifts and assurances of protection.Suny, Ronald Grigor (1994), The Making of the Georgian Nation: 2nd edition', p. 47. Indiana University Press, Outnumbered Bagrat surrendered to Ottomans, however he resumed fighting as soon as Ottoman main army was retreated to Erzurum. Georgians unexpectedly annihilated remaining Ottoman garrison and later pursued main army which was decisively defeated at the battle of Karagak, Musa Pa≈üa was himself killed in fighting. The Ottomans returned in force two years later, and moved into the principality of Samtskhe, where Bagrat and his ally Luarsab I of Kartli suffered a bitter defeat at the Battle of Sokhoista in 1545. As a result, Samtskhe wrested of Bagrat‚Äôs control, and came under the Ottoman hegemony.

RV Platessa was based at the port of Lowestoft and was originally ordered by the Admiralty as one of 81 Motor Fishing Vessels (MFVs) in the ‚Äò1501-Class‚Äô during World War II. Motor fishing vessels were small wooden craft, built in large numbers during the war for use as Ship's tenders. Constructed as MFV 1576 by East Anglian Constructors at Oulton Broad, she was ordered on 26 February 1944, but not completed by the end of the wartime. Trials began in April 1946, and she was taken into service (but not ownership) as an unfinished hull by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (United Kingdom) and converted to a fishing research vessel. She was adapted to carry a trawl on her starboard side. The Platessa's work was almost equally divided between co-operation with the RV Sir Lancelot in the East Anglian herring fishery survey, plaice population surveys, plaice marking, mesh experiments and comparative fishing tests. In 1967 the RV Platessa was handed back to the Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) after 20 years in service, she was replaced by the RV Corella. In 1968 the RV Platessa was sold to private owners (H.J. Lamprell Ltd) and after sinking in Hamilton Dock, Lowestoft in 1975 she was eventually hulked at Lake Lothing where her remains lay for many years. She was recorded as still extant in Lake Lothing on 19 August 2015, and from examination of Google Earth images it seems that she continues to exist as one of two wooden wrecks (the other being the MFV Yellowtail) in the central basin. Service as a fisheries research vessel The RV Platessa (LT205) was in service with Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom) from April 1946 until June 1967, during which time she participated in more than 473 separate research campaigns.Goodwin, N.B., Dare, P.J., Belson, S.J., Gunstone, K.L., Ellis, J.R., Rogers, S.I. (2001) A catalogue of DEFRA historical research vessel data. Sci. Ser. Tech Rep., Cefas Lowestoft, 112, 32pp. http://www.cefas.co.uk/publications/techrep/tech112.pdf She was primarily confined to the southern North Sea, but with occasional forays into the Irish Sea and English Channel, especially in the 1960s. The RV Platessa (LT205) was overwhelmingly dedicated to research on North Sea herring and North Sea Plaice. This work included the tagging of more than 12,000 plaice during the 1950s, 7000 during the 1960s.Burt, G., Goldsmith, D. and Armstrong, M. (2006) A summary of demersal fish tagging data maintained and published by Cefas. Sci. Ser. Tech Rep., Cefas Lowestoft, 135: 40pp. http://www.cefas.co.uk/Publications/techrep/tech135.pdf In addition, large numbers of tagged plaice were released off the Cumberland coast, using the RV Platessa during 1949 and 1950. In August 1951 echo-sounder traces were obtained over a wide area off Whitby by the RV 'Platessa', using a Marconi sounder. They were found to occur at a depth corresponding to that of a sharp thermocline, and small whiting about 3 in. in length, large Medusae, herring and sandeel larv√¶ were caught with a pelagic trawl at the depth of the trace. This work was reported in a ‚Äòletter‚Äô to the journal Nature in 1952. In 1950 the RV Platessa was involved in comparative herring surveys alongside the RV Clupea. The RV Clupea (a 75 ft motor drifter) had been taken into service in August 1948 and shared with the Scottish Home Department‚Äôs Aberdeen Laboratory, working half of the year from Aberdeen and the other half from Lowestoft. This arrangement lasted until 1952 when the RV Clupea was allocated full-time for the use of the Aberdeen scientists. During many of the earliest research cruises aboard RV Platessa (in the 1940s) scientists used a Secchi disk to assess light penetration (turbidity) in the southern North Sea. Recently, Cefas scientists re-discovered 469 historical Secchi depth measurements in survey logbooks, collected in 1931, 1937, 1946‚Äì50, and 1968. These historical measurements have revealed that the ‚Äòsechhi depth‚Äô was much deeper (and therefore water more transparent) in the past compared to today, and thus that the North Sea has become much more turbid.

None of the brothers had children. During their youth, John Calvin often visited the Chateau of Genlis and the brothers. (Chateau de Montmort) Military career Like his father, Fran√ßois Genlis had a military career, initially in service of King Henry II of France. 14 April 1543 he was appointed Captain of the Louvre. In 1560, King Fran√ßois II made Fran√ßois Genlis a knight of the order of Saint-Michel, along with Crevecoeur and d‚ÄôHumieres. In October 1557, the Spanish occupied Chauny. In a battle nearby, along with the French garrison of La F√®re, Fran√ßois Genlis commanded a cavalry company against the Spanish. After converting to Calvinism, Fran√ßois Genlis became Colonel-General for the Protestant ‚Äúparti des religionaires‚Äù, which his brother Jean, seigneur d'Yvoy, also joined. At the Battle of Saint-Denis (10 November 1567), Fran√ßois Genlis commanded the right wing of the Protestant army and led a cavalry charge.La po√©sie fran√ßaise et les guerres de religion, 1560-1574; √©tude historique et litt√©raire sur la po√©sie militante depuis la conjuration d'Amboise jusqu'a la mort de Charles IX by Charbonnier, F Publication date 1919 Also in 1567, he took the towns of Bray (with a ransom of 10,000 ecus), Chauny, Courcy, Vailly and Bruy√®res, then with the support of Bouchavesnes, the towns of Harccourt and Crecy. 27 September 1567, he sacked Soissons. In 1568, Fran√ßois Genlis raised a dozen cornetts of cavalry and 2,000 harquebusiers to join the Prince of Orange in the Battle of le Quesnoy. Fran√ßois Genlis died in 1569. Most texts repeat the line that he probably died in Strasbourg of ‚Äúla rage‚Äù which today would translate as of rabies, but it could mean in despair as he had gone badly into debt funding that last unsuccessful military campaign.

As part of the employee benefits program the company offered 40 paid hours of community service at a location of the employee's choosing. Houlahan dedicated her hours to working with girls and women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Houlahan became Chief Operating Officer of B-Lab, a non- profit start-up, when AND1 was sold.  Education career  Citing a need to experience the problems in the U.S. educational system first-hand, Houlahan entered the lifelong learning program at University of Pennsylvania where she re-took courses in the hard sciences. She enrolled in the Teach for America program and began working as an 11th-grade science teacher at Simon Gratz High School in Philadelphia. She withdrew from the Teach for America program after one year and joined Springboard Collaborative, a Philadelphia-based non-profit focusing on early childhood literacy in underserved populations nationwide. Houlahan served as both President and CFO/COO of Springboard Collaborative before leaving to focus on her political campaign. U.S. House of Representatives  Elections  = 2018 general election = Houlahan has said that one of the experiences that motivated her to run for Congress was her organization of a bus trip to the Women's March in Washington, D.C., on January 21, 2017. When asked why she chose to begin her political career by running for Congress and not a lower office, she said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time for that. The stakes are too high, and I think I‚Äôm qualified.\\" Houlahan expected to face two-term Republican incumbent Ryan Costello. However, Costello pulled out of the race after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania threw out Pennsylvania's congressional map as an unconstitutional partisan Republican gerrymander. While Costello was the only incumbent to retain his previous district number, it was made significantly more compact and bluer than its predecessor. It lost its heavily Republican western portion, around Lebanon. Instead, it now took in all of Chester County, along with the more Democratic portions of Berks County, including Reading. Had the district existed in 2016, Hillary Clinton would have won it with 52 percent of the vote to Donald Trump's 43 percent;Presidential results by congressional district for districts used in 2018, from Daily Kos Clinton carried the old 6th with 48 percent of the vote.Presidential results by congressional district for districts used in 2016, from Daily Kos Houlahan took the Democratic nomination unopposed and faced first-time candidate Greg McCauley in the general election.

Houlahan was one of seven Pennsylvania women running for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018, and one of four Democratic women to win, along with Mary Gay Scanlon, Madeleine Dean and Susan Wild. She also joined two other female veterans in the House freshman class, former naval officers Elaine Luria and Mikie Sherrill. Upon taking office in January 2019, Houlahan became the first Democrat to represent a Chester County-based district in 166 years. The county had historically been very Republican, but has trended much more Democratic in recent years. Houlahan ran on a platform that included healthcare, job creation, and campaign finance reform. Other campaign issues she identified included education, family issues, and veteran's issues. Houlahan had a strong record of campaign fundraising, with donations totaling almost $5 million so far. She was also endorsed by many organizations, including Emily's List, Human Rights Campaign, Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Project 100, Vote Vets, the Service Employees International Union-PA (SEIU PA) and several other local unions.

Plot  Lynn Matthews (Melissa Gilbert) is a Manhattan-based successful clothing designer who has recurring nightmares of a woman (Kat Green) falling down an elevator shaft. She decides to visit Dr. James Portman (Jay Robinson) and undergoes hypnotherapy, during which she learns that the woman falling is Lynn herself in her previous life, pushed down the shaft by a man in San Francisco in 1963. The nightmares cause her to start slacking at work, and her boss Denise (Babz Chula) forces her to take a six week vacation to recover. She decides to take the time off to travel to San Francisco and find out who the lady in her dreams is. She locates the building quickly and the same night learns in her dream that the woman is named Mary Ann. The next day, Lynn visits the archives and finds out that there was one woman named Mary Ann who passed away in 1963. The lady in question was 20 years old at the time, single, and committed suicide. Lynn is confused about her marital status and cause of death, because in her dreams she vividly remembers the girl wearing a wedding ring and being pushed by a man. She decides to visit the police, where Inspector Jeff Alberts (Scott Plank) insists on taking her case. He pulls up old files and notices that the case was handled by his colleague Daniel Corso (Christopher Stone). They decide to speak with him about the case, but Corso believes there is no reason to re-open it. Lynn then locates Mary Ann's marriage records, which show that she was married to Mark Gage (Ted Shackelford), a prominent real estate developer. She quickly informs Alberts about her discovery, but he grows suspicious of her insistence on finding out the truth, considering that she told them that she was merely doing research for her mother's homecoming class reunion. Corso alerts Gage on Lynn's snooping, and he is clearly concerned. By accident, Lynn bumps into Gage and realizes that she met him days earlier in New York, when her cab accidentally ran into him. He follows her and retrieves her files that she signed at his office, and then compares her handwriting to a letter written to him by Mary Ann. Struck by her similar looks to Mary Ann, he invites her over for dinner, then catches her going through his stuff in his house. He asks her about her true motives for contacting him, but Lynn quickly leaves. Throughout the process of gathering evidence, Lynn is repeatedly harassed by an unknown person. When someone slashes her tires, she thinks Gage is behind it and tells Alberts about her suspicions. He digs up further information about the case and discovers that Mary Ann was pregnant at the time of her death. When confronting Corso with their gathered information, he admits having withhold information because it would have crushed her religious parents, then allows them to re-open the case. Afterwards, he immediately contacts Gage, telling him they have to kill Lynn like they killed Mary Ann. Corso leads Lynn to the same elevator shaft he pushed Mary Ann into, and is about to lead her to the same fate when suddenly Gage appears and threatens to kill him. Gage reveals that he indeed was married to Mary Ann, which caused a scandal with his wealthy family. His family then hired Corso to pay Mary Ann enough money to leave Gage, but she refused and threatened to go to the police, at which point he killed her. Gage then kept quiet in order to protect his father. A shootout ensues, during which Gage is shot. Lynn fights Corso off and he eventually falls to his death in the elevator shaft.

The two artists have collaborated since meeting in 2010 at Bard College, where they both studied film. Bernstein and Rubin have presented film, music, and theater together at MOCA Los Angeles, Issue Project Room, Anthology Film Archives, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. Their directorial projects have included the film Boyland, featured in the 2015 Brooklyn Film Festival; and Bieber Bathos Elegy, a ‚Äúhybrid work of musical performance‚Äù staged at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 2016. The self- described ‚Äúambiguous twosome‚Äù has also performed together as a two-piece musical act called Tender Cousins. Bernstein and Rubin‚Äôs first joint exhibition, Folie √† Deux, opened at David Lewis Gallery Phoenix in June 2018.  Individual careers and early relationship  Felix Bernstein is the author of the poetry collection Burn Book, and a book of essays, Notes on Post- Conceptual Poetry. His poetry and cultural criticism has been published in Flash Art, Spike Art Quarterly, Poetry Magazine, Hyperallergic, and Texte Zur Kunst. Gabe Rubin has performed, directed, stage managed, and edited for various films, performances, and theatrical productions including the opera Victorine by Art & Language and The Red Krayola at the 2012 Whitney Biennial, and Transition Incomplete at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. In 2018 he was also featured in the transmasculine photo series American Boys by Soraya Zaman. Bernstein and Rubin met and related over the ‚Äúmiddlebrow aesthetic‚Äù of musical theatre while both attending Bard College in 2010. As described by Rubin: > ‚ÄúA friend showed me some of Felix‚Äôs videos on the website blip.tv in 2008, > and I thought they were fantastic and watched them all the time.

Also at the Whitney, Rubin performed in Jill Kroesen‚Äôs Collecting Injustices (2016) and Bernstein in Andrew Lampert‚Äôs Synonym for Untitled (2013). Both Bernstein and Rubin performed in the opera Victorine by Mayo Thompson and Art & Language at the 2012 Whitney Biennial. The artists have also performed together as Tender Cousins, a two-piece musical act.  Film and video  Among Bernstein and Rubin‚Äôs early collaborations are a series of YouTube videos including Felix and Gabe Sing Jellicle Cats for Four Hours (2014) and Pagan Women Yahoo Group with Gabe Rubin (2014). In 2013 Rubin starred in Unchained Melody, a film written and directed by Bernstein, featuring his parents Charles Bernstein and Susan Bee, the poet Cole Heinowitz, and singer Shelley Hirsch. Bernstein and Rubin made their co-directorial debut in 2015 with Boyland, a short experimental film adaptation of the poem \\"The Love that Dare Not Speak Its Name\\" by Oscar Wilde's lover Lord Alfred Douglas. The film was included in the 2015 Brooklyn Film Festival. In June 2018 Bernstein and Rubin staged their first joint exhibition, Folie √† Deux, at David Lewis Gallery. Its centerpiece was a 45-minute film, Madame de Void: A Melodrama, concerning the relationship between fashion designer Madame de Void (derivative of both Cruella de Vil and Marquis de Sade, played by Bernstein) and her dog Blot (played by Rubin). An accompanying audio-play titled Folie √† Deux: A Duodrama elaborates on the relational dialectic between these two characters. Bernstein and Rubin consider the show to be a work of ‚ÄúAnemic Aestheaterory,‚Äù referring to Marcel Duchamp‚Äôs film Anemic Cinema (1926) and the etymological relationship between ‚Äútheory‚Äù and ‚Äútheater.‚Äù  References  Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:American artist groups and collectives Category:Art duos ","title":"Felix Bernstein &amp; Gabe Rubin"},{"id":"57780242","text":"2-Methylbut-3-yn-2-ol is the organic compound with the formula HC2C(OH)Me2 (Me = CH3).

The Linda Mullins trained Heavenly Lady won the 1993 Greyhound of the Year after collecting 17 of the 21 votes available. The black bitch won 25 of her 49 races including the Golden Jacket, Cearns Memorial and TV Trophy. Ringa Hustle was voted Irish Greyhound of the Year after winning the 1993 English Greyhound Derby. John McGee won the Greyhound Trainer of the Year for the sixth successive year. The first ever British Greyhound Racing Fund budget of ¬£840,000 was distributed as follows - ¬£210,000 to drug testing, ¬£248,000 to chromatography, ¬£180,000 in track grants, ¬£100,000 in prize money, ¬£50,000 to a national inter track and ¬£42,000 to the Retired Greyhound Trust. News The Greyhound Racing Association (GRA) parent company Wembley plc. suffered financial difficulties having to service a ¬£13 million debt. The company's American greyhound operation saw profits fall from ¬£5.9 to ¬£3.3 million. The British tracks were faring better making a ¬£2.1 million profit but that made little difference to the overall debt problems. The debt ridden Brent Walker the owners of Hackney Wick Stadium were on the verge of selling William Hill to avoid administration. The inconsistency of chromatography is highlighted during the Oaks at Wimbledon Stadium, the pre-meeting test for a bitch called Ballinderry Gown indicates a problem and she is withdrawn from the first round, an immediate second is taken and is negative. The chromatography system has been widely criticised as being inaccurate and unreliable and although used at all licensed tracks the decision is made to phase out the system. The NGRC plans for a new more reliable system to be put into place with future samples taken by 'the flying squad' (members of unannounced staff from the NGRC taking random samples). The samples would then be tested at the Horseracing Forensic Laboratory (HFL). Mick Smith becomes Racing Manager at Wembley and Simon Harris switched to Wimbledon from Hall Green to be replaced by Gary Woodward. Dave Lawrence steps in at Bristol to replace the parting Woodward. Dave Baldwin replaces Dave Gunson at Sheffield. Trainer changes during the year saw Derby winning trainer Tony Meek leave Hall Green, David Mullins leave Sunderland for Catford and Pa Fitzgerald joined Reading as a trainer in his own right after helping Patsy Byrne for many years. Reading would also announce the arrival of champion trainer John McGee, his third track in four years. Reading continued to be in the news and this time it was because they increased their Reading Masters prize to a fabulous ¬£20,000. Ken Peckham died just seven years after the exploits of the brilliant Scurlogue Champ. Manx Treasure enjoying success at stud died of cancer aged just three and a half. Poor Sue retired with a race record of 77 open race wins from 157 races (a new record for open race wins). Competitions Kildare Slippy made his third consecutive Grand National final but age was getting the better of him as he was easily beaten by favourite Arfur Daley. Kind of Magic trained by Litzi Miller went one place better than the previous year in the Scurry Gold Cup final at Catford Stadium and this time lifted the trophy. Beaten finalist Ardcollum Hilda achieved a good win the following month when she won the Gold Collar at Catford Stadium over a longer distance at the same track. Redwood Girl trained by Ernies Gaskin Sr. won the Grand Prix at Walthamstow Stadium, the competition had attracted a good entry and in the final the brindle bitch defeated hot favourite Loch Bo Anchor competing in his second classic final and Heavenly Lady. She would also reach the Oaks final towards the end of the year finishing third behind Pearls Girl. Derby finalist Hypnotic Stag won the Blue Riband and Olympic.

It is located in the city's Cemetery Belt, bisected by the border between Brooklyn and Queens.

In 1882, Calvert Vaux was commissioned to design a small, red brick Metaher house or place of purification and pre-burial eulogies, near the entrance to the Shearith Israel section. It is the only religious building that Vaux, the co-designer of Central Park, is known to have designed. The burial ground contains many examples of architecture and funerary art.

This expedition was the final of three expeditions on the NOAAS Okeanos Explorer intended to increase the understanding of the deep-sea environment in the Gulf of Mexico. Gulf of Mexico 2018 was a 23-day telepresence-enabled expedition to collect critical information and acquire data on priority exploration areas identified by the ocean management and scientific communities. The goal of the expedition was to use remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dives in combination with seafloor mapping operations to increase the understanding of deep-sea ecosystems and collect scientific information to support future management decisions. The expedition lasted from 11 April 2018 to 3 May 2018. ROV Dives When this currently unidentified squid (possibly Discoteuthis sp.) was observed, it appeared to be curled in upon itself with its arms folded in what may be a defensive posture. What appears to be the beak is visible towards the lower part of the center of the animal and is slightly lighter in color than the body. 15 ROV dives were conducted ranging in depth from 305 to 3,010 meters to explore the diversity and distribution of deep-sea habitats and associated marine communities in the Gulf of Mexico basin. Operations were focused on characterizing deep-sea coral and sponge communities, bottomfish habitats, submarine canyons, shipwrecks, and chemosynthetic habitats such as brine pools, gas seeps, and mud volcanoes. Midwater exploration at depths ranging from 900 to 300 meters were also conducted during two dives to investigate the diversity and abundance of the largely unknown pelagic fauna. During these dives hundreds of different species of animals, including several potential new species, new behaviors, and numerous significant range extensions were observed. 67 Biological samples (22 primary and 45 associated and commensal taxa) were collected. 13 of the biological samples represented substantial range extensions, and several were new species to science. 12 rock samples were collected for geochemical composition analysis and age-dating.ROV Deep Discoverer observed a small (1.2 meter diameter) brine pool at 1,067 meters depth. During dives 6 and 7 two new chemosynthetic communities were documented including a brine pool and extinct brine waterfall at Hidalgo Basin and gas seeps at Walker Ridge 488. Two Muusoctopus sp. appear to wrestle for space inside the wreck seen on Dive 02 of the expedition. During the first dive the shipwreck of the tug boat New Hope was explored for the first time and a 3D model of the site was created. The following dive explored an unidentified wooden vessel, a 3D model of the site was created as well. A smaller objective of the dives was to document the extent of deep sea debris in the area. Trash was found 1,600 meters deep and over 275 kilometers off shore. Outreach The live video feeds of the expedition were shared publicly worldwide with the live video receiving more than 300,700 views via the NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research (OER) YouTube channel. 85 Scientist, managers, and students from 35 institutions in the United States, Japan, Russia, Norway, United Kingdom, and Canada participated as members of the science team through telepresence. The expedition also conducted 16 live telepresence interactions with various groups engaging more than 400 individuals including the Exploratorium, National Aquarium, Boston College, Hawaii Pacific University, London Natural History Museum, and many more.

History The building from 1732 Poul Fechtel had served as Royal Mint Master for Christian III from 1536 to 1565. In 1570, Fechtel created a charity with 3,000 eigsdaler in capital with the aim of providing accommodation for indigent citizens.

The colonial authorities in Portuguese Mozambique increased the brutality of their occupation during the war. \\"Revolting practices\\" criticised by the British, such as forced labour, were increasingly applied despite the abolition of slavery. Press gangs (cipais) used the most brutal coercion to mobilise whole populations, young, old and infirm people not being exempted and women being raped. By the end of 1916, many young men had fled to Southern Rhodesia and Transvaal to escape the Portuguese and to earn living wages. The condition of the populations left behind worsened to the point that when the cipais tried to raise another 5,000 carriers from the kingdom of Barue in March 1917, the population rebelled. Disgust at Portuguese depredations united many peoples but the rivals for the title of Makombe of the Wabarue fought independent campaigns, attracting support from the bandits in the Zambesi valley. At the end of April, the rebels routed a Portuguese force sent to suppress the rising and reached the provincial capital of Tete; by the end of May had overrun most of Zambezia Province. About 100,000 people crossed the border into British Nyasaland and the Rhodesian colonies to escape the violence but the disruption did little to alter British disdain for Portuguese methods and despite having received troops to help put down the Chilembwe rebellion, they refused to send troops, only allowing guns and ammunition over the border. In May the Portuguese began to suppress the rebels by butchering thousands of people, enslaving women and plundering territory. The rebels held out into November and the rivals for the title of Makombe fled to Southern Rhodesia. During June the Portuguese had to divide their forces and send thousands of Portuguese and local troops to attack the Makonde living on the Mvua plateau, who had also rebelled. Another rebellion broke out early in 1918.

It lies mostly within Cheringoma, Muanza, and Marromeu districts. Geography The Cheringoma Plateau lies near the coast, between the lower Zambezi and Pungwe rivers. The plateau is roughly oval in shape, trending northeast- southwest. The ridgeline follows the northern and western edge of the plateau. It reaches over 300 meters elevation along the ridgeline, with the highest point (379 meters) near the town of Inhaminga. The plateau falls gently towards the east and south, and steeply towards the west and north, known as the Cheringoma escarpment. The low, flat valley of the Urema Graben lies below the escarpment, bounding the plateau on the north and west. The Urema lowlands are part of the African Rift Valley system. The lowlands are home to seasonal lakes and wetlands. The northern portion of the graben is drained northeastwards by the Zangue River, a tributary of the Zambezi, while the southern portion is drained southwards by the Urema River, a tributary of the Pungwe. The Urema basin and the adjacent western portion of the plateau lie within Gorongosa National Park.Davies, G.B.P., C.T. Symes, and D.W. Pietersen. \\"Inhamtianga Forest ‚Äì the Largest Indigenous Forest in Mozambique and Aspects of its Avifauna\\". Honeyguide (2011) 57(2), pp. 92-101. The Zambezi Delta lies to the northeast, and the streams originating in the northeast corner of the plateau empty into the delta. The plateau slopes gently on the southeast and south towards the Indian Ocean. A number of rivers, including the Savane, Sangussi, Zambazo (or Sambazo), Chinizuia, Zuni, and Mupa, drain southeastwards off the plateau into the Indian Ocean. The port of Beira lies to the southwest, near the mouth of the Pungwe River. In the 1920s, the Trans- Zambezia Railway was built across the plateau, generally following the ridgeline between Beira and the Zambezi. The railway fell into disuse during the Mozambican Civil War, but was returned to use in 2010. The railway, now called the Sena line, runs from Beira to the coal mine at Moatize in Tete Province. Highway 120 runs parallel to the railway between Beira and Caia on the Zambezi. At Inhamitanga, a branch of the railway continues east to the river port of Marromeu on the Zambezi. Climate The climate of the plateau is tropical savanna (Aw) according to the K√∂ppen climate classification. Rainfall ranges from 1000 and 1200 mm annually, with most of the precipitation during the summer rainy season from December to March.\\"Perfil do Distrito de Cheringoma Prov√≠ncia de Sofala\\". Minist√©rio da Administra√ß√£o Estatal, Rep√∫blica de Mo√ßambique. 2014. Geology The plateau is mostly covered by sandy soils, derived from conglomerate sandstones of the Miocene and Pliocene epochs, known as the Mazamba Formation. Underneath sandstone are Eocene marine limestones, known as the Cheringoma Formation. The Cheringoma Formation's limestone contain numerous marine fossils, including coral, gastropods, bivalves, and nummulites. The Cheringoma formation is exposed along the Cheringoma Escarpment, and has eroded into gorges and extensive caverns. Ecology Most of the plateau is within the Southern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic ecoregion, which extends from the coast to the ridgeline. Plant communities include humid miombo woodland and moist evergreen forest in river valleys. The northeastern and eastern slopes of the plateau and the Urema Graben are in the generally hotter and drier Zambezian and mopane woodlands ecoregion, characterized by savanna of Acacia, Sclerocarya, Burkea, and Hyphaene, along with floodplain grasslands and patches of deciduous forest.\\"WWF Wildfinder\\".

Controlled hunting areas, called coutadas, cover the eastern end of the plateau in Cheringoma and Marromeu districts ‚Äì Coutadas 10, 11, and 12. The Chinizuia Forest lies in Muanza District on the eastern slope of the plateau, in the valley of the Chinizuia River. It is famous among birdwatchers for offering some of the best miombo and forest birdwatching in southern Africa. Miombo woodland species include the southern banded snake eagle (Circaetus fasciolatus), Ayres's hawk- eagle (Hieraaetus ayresii), racket-tailed roller (Coracias spatulatus), Black- and-white shrike-flycatcher (Bias musicus), chestnut-fronted helmetshrike (Prionops scopifrons), Retz's helmetshrike (Prionops retzii), White-crested helmetshrike (Prionops plumatus), yellow-bellied hyliota (Hyliota flavigaster), red-throated twinspot (Hypargos niveoguttatus), and lesser seedcracker (Pyrenestes minor). In the streamside forests are the east coast akalat (Sheppardia gunningi), white-chested alethe (Chamaetylas fuelleborni), barred long-tailed cuckoo (Cercococcyx montanus), African pitta (Pitta angolensis), eastern bronze-naped pigeon (Columba delegorguei), silvery- cheeked hornbill (Bycanistes brevis), African broadbill (Smithornis capensis), Narina trogon (Apaloderma narina), speckle-throated woodpecker (Campethera scriptoricauda), lowland tiny greenbul (Phyllastrephus debilis), black-headed apalis (Apalis melanocephala), plain-backed sunbird (Anthreptes reichenowi), and western violet-backed sunbird (Anthreptes longuemarei).

The Inhamitanga Forest, which lies between the plateau town of Inhamitanga and the Zambezi lowlands to the northeast, is Mozambique's largest intact tract of forest. It covers an area of 40,000 hectares. It is located on sandy soil on the northern edge of the plateau, and combines flora typical of the coastal evergreen forest (Celtis mildbraedii, Drypetes gerrardii, and Chrysophyllum viridifolium), deciduous sand forests (Millettia stuhlmannii and Xylia torreana), and Zambezian lowland savanna (Sterculia appendiculata). The forest has no permanent watercourses.Davies, G.B.P., C.T. Symes, and D.W. Pietersen. \\"Inhamtianga Forest ‚Äì the Largest Indigenous Forest in Mozambique and Aspects of its Avifauna\\".

It is mostly Miombo woodland, with Brachystegia spiciformis predominant, along with Millettia stuhlmannii, Pteleopsis myrtifolia, Xeroderris stuhlmannii, and occasionally Albizia adianthifolia. There are areas of moist evergreen woodland, with Erythrophleum suaveolens, Inhambanella henriquezii, and Synsepalum brevipes, and areas of dry deciduous woodland and grassland. The reserve and the surrounding area has been degraded by logging and wildfires, with little closed-canopy forest remaining, and mature canopy trees widely scattered.M√ºller, Thomas & Sitoe, Almeida & Mabunda, Rito.

Prior to that he was a successful apprentice jockey before increasing weight brought a premature end to a promising career.PW Watt, \\"History\\", St Peter's College (Retrieved 28 June 2018) An \\"Ellerslie boy\\", Colin Jillings became an apprentice jockey at the age of 12 (1943). He would catch the train to school St Peter's College, Auckland each day after earlier riding trackwork at the Ellerslie Racecourse. His biggest success as an apprentice was the 1946 Railway Stakes (a race he would later win 3 times as a trainer: Pipe Dream (1962); Sharivari (1971) and Diamond Lover (1987) aboard Royal Scot. He trained the first of 4 Auckland Cup winners in 1956 Yemen, followed by Stipulate (1963), Perhaps (1976) and Irish Chance (in partnership with Richard Yuill) in 1999. He also achieved the unique record of training a Derby winner in each of the last 5 decades of the 20th Century: his first Derby winner being Lawful (1958) followed by Stipulate (1960), Uncle Remus (1977), I'm Henry (1983) and The Phantom Chance (1992). Jillings biggest success came when he trained The Phantom Chance to win the 1993 W.S. Cox Plate. Although operating with a smaller team, than most other trainers, Jillings managed to keep producing top horses year after year.Glyn Tucker, \\"Thoroughbreds are my Life\\", AH & AW Reed, Wellington, 1978, p. 211. In addition to those already mentioned, other notable horses, amongst his many GP1 winners, included: Beauzami (NZ Cup); Gay Filou (Wtgn Cup); Athenia (NZ Oaks for his good friend T.J. (Tommy) Smith); Sugaratariat and Old Son (both won the Ellerslie Sires Produce Stakes for himself, and another good friend, Pukekohe market gardener, Pabu Daya); Tycoon Lil et al. Less well known was the fact that, in his earlier years from limited runners, he was also a noted trainer of jumpers, winning 1959 Grand National Hurdles with Armed (owned by himself); the 1971 Great Northern Hurdles/Steeples double, and 1972 Great Northern Steeplechase, with Brockton (for great friend, Wellington businessman, Doug Tse) and the 1987 Great Northern Steeples with DeductAble, in partnership with Richard Yuill (with both sharing the ownership). When he retired he had amassed a total of 1327 NZ winners, 703 of those with long time training partner Richard Yuill.Colin Jillings, New Zealand Racing Hall of Fame (Retrieved 28 June 2018) When asked to name the best horse he ever trained Jillings had no hesitation in labelling Stipulate, the champion stayer of his era in the early 1960s. The fact that he had no hesitation in labelling Stipulate speaks volumes for the regard Jillings had for the horse given that he also trained the super little horse of the early 1980's - McGinty. The son of One Pound Sterling was the winner of six Group One races and a total of 14 races, McGinty was trained by Colin Jillings for race commentator Keith Haub and co-owner Barney McCahill. He was the top-weighted horse on the NZ 1981-82 Two-Year-Old Free Handicap and was top colt on the 1982-83 NZ Three Year Old Free Handicap. His Group One wins came in the Air New Zealand Stakes (twice), Rawson Stakes, Canterbury Guineas, Caulfield Stakes and George Adams Handicap. He began stud duties in 1984 and his leading progeny included Auckland Cup/BMW Stakes winner Miltak, New Zealand Derby/Air New Zealand Stakes winner The Gentry, Adelaide Cup winner The Hind and Australian Guineas winner Jolly Old Mac. For all of his GP 1 success as a racehorse, and then as a stallion, his standout moment was when he beat the champion Australian 2YO Marscay in the Todman Slipper Trial. Not only did he beat Marscay, who went on to win the Golden Slipper and was subsequently crowned Australia's Champion 2YO, he beat him on 3 legs, having cracked his cannon bone at the top of the straight. Jillings was also a noted mentor of apprentices the best being his long time stable jockey Bob Vance who was rte rider of: * McGinty. * 3 of Jillings' New Zealand Derby winners - Uncle Remus, I'm Henry and The Phantom Chance. * The Phantom Chance in the Cox Plate. In addition to his 3 Derby winners for Jillings he also won the race on Isle of Man. Vance won the NZ Jockeys Premiership, as an apprentice (1977/78) and had a successful career riding internationally in Hong Kong and Macau. One of NZ's most successful female riders of the 2000s, Samantha Spratt, was also a graduate of the Jillings academy as were Mark Sweeney (2 Auckland Cup wins) and Daniel Southworth (New Zealand 1000 Guineas, Railway Stakes). Jillings was inducted into the New Zealand Racing Hall of Fame in 2008.

Levan I Dadiani collected the Abkhazians and Odishians to help Guria; he camped in the Rioni harbor.

The two largest fires, which were declared major incidents, burned over each and broke out on Saddleworth Moor in Greater Manchester and Winter Hill in Lancashire. Other large fires broke out in Glenshane Pass in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland (640 acres) and in the Vale of Rheidol in Ceredigion, Wales. The Saddleworth Moor fire has been described as the largest English wildfire in living memory. Most of the wildfires occurred during the first official heatwave in the United Kingdom since June 2017, with temperatures reaching above for several days, making the hottest June in the country since 1995, and the driest June for over ten years in large parts of the United Kingdom, exacerbating the crisis. A wildfire started on the Staffordshire Moorlands on 9 August and, despite rain, had spread to cover 219 acres by 11 August.https://twitter.com/AlsagerFS/status/1028668787904729088 Some hot spots were still burning as at 22 August.https://twitter.com/StaffsWildlife/status/1032170443174756352 In total, there were 79 fires over the course of the year, a new record. However, the record was beaten in 2019 with 96 fires as of April 23.https://www.newscientist.com/article/2200502-the-uk-has-already-had-more- wildfires-in-2019-than-any-year-on-record/  Background  June 2018 was the driest on record for some parts of the UK, as a result of a persistent strong Azores High that blocked Atlantic low-pressure weather systems from reaching the British Isles and bringing rainfall. For much of the time, a strong anticlockwise wind circulation around Britain and Ireland caused a strong warm anticyclone there. As a result, in the lead-up to the outbreak of wildfires across the country, many areas were unusually dry. Drought conditions were reported in parts of the country by the end of the month, with NI Water introducing a hosepipe ban in Northern Ireland from 6 pm on 29 June, the first hosepipe ban in the area since 1995. Towards the end of the month, prolonged high pressure moving in from southern Europe brought with it a prolonged period of high temperatures, marking the first official heat wave in the United Kingdom since June 2017. Temperatures of over were reported widely in all four nations of the United Kingdom for the first time since July 2013, with June 2018 becoming the warmest June month since 1995. On 26 June, a high of was recorded at Porthmadog in Gwynedd, Wales, making it the hottest day of the year so far for the United Kingdom. Porthmadog continued to break temperature records on subsequent days, reaching on 27 June and then on 28 June. By 6 July, the heatwave, which had lasted just over two weeks, was the longest in the United Kingdom since July 2013. The drought conditions were exacerbated by May 2018 being the warmest since 2008 and the driest since 2011. It was especially dry in parts of Northern England, where rainfall was the lowest.https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcet/data/download.htmlhttps://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadukp/data/monthly/HadEWP_monthly_qc.txt  Fires  Member of Parliament Jonathan Reynolds, Shadow Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said ministers would ‚Äúneed to look seriously at our capacity to deal with these kinds of fires in future, including military capacity we might have lost in recent years‚Äù.Andy Burnham calls for more support to tackle Lancashire wildfires, The Guardian  Saddleworth Moor  NASA satellite image of smoke rising from fires on Saddleworth Moor on 27 June 2018 Soldiers from the Royal Regiment of Scotland providing assistance to firefighters on Saddleworth Moor. Fire first broke out on Saddleworth Moor, between Sheffield and Manchester, on 24 June 2018, but that fire was extinguished later that same day. But the next day, pockets of the fire re-ignited, perhaps from burning of peat which had dried out deep; this began to burn out of control from 26 June, and a major incident was declared that day. By 27 June, the moorland fire had grown to cover over and remained uncontained. Rapidly changing wind speed and direction helped the fire to spread quickly across the dry moorland and complicated efforts to fight the fire, which split into several fronts moving in different directions. Dry peat is also making fighting the fire difficult, as the fire can continue to smoulder underground after being extinguished at the surface, re-igniting the surface later. After a major incident was declared on 26 June and with the fire rapidly approaching populated areas, around 150 people were evacuated from 50 homes close to the advancing fire, including 34 homes on Calico Crescent in Carrbrook, Stalybridge; it is thought to be the first time a wildfire has forced such an evacuation to take place in the United Kingdom. In the House of Commons on 26 June, Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs that the government was keeping the situation on Saddleworth Moor under \\"constant review\\" following the declaration of a major incident in response to the wildfires. Speaking at the scene of the fire on 27 June, Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said that a summertime fire on Saddleworth Moor \\"isn't unusual\\", but that the size and scale of this fire \\"is unlike anything we've seen before\\". Later that afternoon, assistant chief fire officer of the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service Dave Keelan formally requested military assistance in tackling the fire, including the provision of high-pressure water lines and transportation of firefighters towards front lines, plus Chinook helicopters to transport water pumps up the mountain. The fire was near to a densely populated area of northern England. Satellite imagery showed smoke drifting towards Sheffield and Leeds on 25 June, before the wind direction changed and the smoke cloud was redirected over Manchester and towards Liverpool on 26‚Äì27 June. As a result, air quality levels across Greater Manchester dropped due to smoke and ash drifting across the city from the fire, forming a widespread haze at ground level. Emergency services supplied dust masks to residents living closest to the fire, in Stalybridge and surrounding areas, on 27 June; four local schools ‚Äì three primary schools and a secondary school ‚Äì were closed, and residents were advised to keep their doors and windows closed. One GP at a Manchester surgery told BBC News that he had treated numerous people suffering from respiratory illnesses relating to the fire, including nosebleeds, coughs and eye problems. On 27 June, the burning caused particle pollution to reach as far away as Wigan, Warrington and St Helens - 37 miles away. This pollution reached an eight out of ten on the air quality index. As night fell on 27 June 29 fire engines and more than 100 firefighters were at the scene of the fire, including crews from Greater Manchester, Cheshire and Derbyshire; two helicopters were in use, and had so far dropped more than 65,000 gallons of water on the fire from above. The Salvation Army arrived at the scene, handing out 1000 bottles of water, 600 Mars bars and sandwiches made from 40 loaves of bread to firefighters. Other charities and individuals brought much food and drinking water to the fire sites. After three weeks, on 18 July, it was declared the fire was extinguished. In total of moorland were burned and the Manchester fire service declared it one of the busiest periods it has ever faced. Aside from the extensive firefighting effort also recent rainfall had led to the final declaration of the fire being extinguished. One wildlife expert said the effects of the fire could last for up to fifteen years. Winter Hill Smoke plumes rising above the Winter Hill TV transistor Aerial view showing the extent of damage on 2 July A large wildfire broke out on Winter Hill, north of Bolton in Lancashire, at around 3:20 pm on Thursday 28 June 2018; near the Winter Hill transmitting station. Initially, five fire engines from Greater Manchester and seven from the Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service were sent to tackle the blaze with specialist fire-fighting equipment. They were supported by firefighting teams from United Utilities and volunteers and vehicles from Bolton Mountain Rescue Team, and later other local volunteer teams including Lancaster Area Search and Rescue. By nightfall, that fire had reached more in size with a total of fifteen fire crews from Lancashire trying to stop the fire from spreading. The next day, fire services were also assisted by a United Utilities helicopter which was dropping tons of water from the nearby Rivington Reservoirs onto the fire. At the time huge plumes of smoke from the moors could be seen from as far away as Wigan, and was measured on pollution instruments as far away as Blackpool. People who were affected by the smoke were advised to keep windows closed and doors shut. The fire also caused a number of roads and footpaths in the area to be closed due to public safety, with firefighters later setting up a 'four- mile no-go zone' around the affected area. Elsewhere, on 29 June at 2 am other wildfires started near Horrocks Moor Farm, on Scout Road in Bolton. Separately, fifty firefighters were sent there - where the fire was reportedly long. On 30 June it was reported this fire had merged with the fire on Winter Hill, and as result the two official fire incidents became one and a major incident was declared. The proximity of the fire to the broadcasting equipment at Winter Hill transmitting station, which has the second greatest coverage of any UK transmitter at around 7 million people, led to fears that it may disrupt television and radio services. The transmitter's owners, Arqiva, issued a statement for radio stations in the area to be on standby and prepare for any interruptions in broadcast. By 2 July 2018, the fire covered over six square miles with up to one hundred firefighters and more than 20 fire engines tackling the blaze. The continuing response was also being supported by volunteers from Bolton Mountain Rescue Team, Bowland Pennine Mountain Rescue Team and Rossendale & Pendle Mountain Rescue Team. That day Andy Burnham visited the site of the fire and said that he would be speaking to the Home Secretary Sajid Javid about the incident and that he wanted to ensure \\"all necessary resources are available\\". The fire was brought under control on 16 July, in total it had spread over . The fire service through said there was \\"still significant work to do\\" as peat was still burning underground and recent rainfall even by 23 July the fire was not fully out. The fire service were digging into the ground to make sure the water reaches the burning peat. On 29 June 2018 a 22-year-old man was arrested for arson with intent to endanger life, on suspicion of starting the initial Winter Hill fire. On 1 July a police helicopter, which was patrolling the area, spotted several people setting grass fires alight in the Healey Nab area close to Winter Hill. Tony Crook, from the Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service, has stated that ‚ÄúPolice are now attending that scene, to try to apprehend those arsonists‚Äù.  Glenshane Pass  A large gorse fire broke out in the Glenshane Pass area of the Sperrins in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, in the early hours of 27 June 2018; the first call to emergency services came at 04:57 am. By the end of the day, five separate fires in the pass had rapidly grown to cover an area of over in total, with firefighters struggling to reach the fire due to extremely high temperatures; elsewhere in Northern Ireland, temperatures reached 29.6 ¬∞C on 27 June, marking the hottest June day in the province since 1995. After attempting unsuccessfully to reach the isolated fire on foot for more than an hour during the daytime, firefighters eventually had to be airlifted into the area by helicopter later in the day as temperatures dropped. Her Majesty's Coastguard and Forest Service Northern Ireland were deployed to assist crews from the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service with tackling the Glenshane Pass fire, with the Coastguard providing helicopters to transport firefighters to and from the scene and drop water on the fire from above. Multiple fire crews from Ballymena, Cookstown, Dungiven, Kilrea, Maghera and Magherafelt fire stations were sent to the scene of the fire, alongside a specialist Command Support Unit from Belfast. Roads through the Glenshane Pass remained open during the fire, although smoke hindered visibility, with the Northern Ireland Weather and Flood Advisory Service warning motorists to take care and prepare for possible short-notice travel disruption.  Vale of Rheidol  On 26 June 2018, two crews from the Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service responded to a large grass and, later, forest fire alongside the A4120 in the Vale of Rheidol close to Aberystwyth in Ceredigion. The road remained open during the fire. The first calls to emergency services regarding the fire were logged at around 11:30 am, with temperatures in the area reaching 30 ¬∞C on what was the hottest day of the year to date for that area. The wildfire caused the suspension of heritage rail services on the preserved Vale of Rheidol Railway, with 150 passengers stuck on a train close to Devil's Bridge railway station having to be rescued and returned to Aberystwyth by bus. Rail services remained suspended the following day as fire crews continued to fight the fire in a valley close to the railway line. Owing to the fire's inaccessibility by road, a specialised Permaquip road-railer was sent to tackle the conflagration from the railway line, although it is now largely being left to burn itself out. The cause of the wildfire has not yet been determined.  Mynydd Cilgwyn  On 2 July about 15 homes were evacuated as more than 40 firefighters fought a mile-long mountain fire in Gwynedd. The North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said the gorse blaze, at Mynydd Cilgwyn in Carmel, was one of several fires the service was attending. It also had crews at fires in Talsarnau, Rhiw, Llanycil and Bangor Mountain in Gwynedd and Newborough Forest, Anglesey. It said a village hall would be used as a rest centre for residents affected.  Somerset  A number of wildfires were reported in Somerset. In the early hours of 26 June, three crews from the Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service attended two unrelated garden fires in Peasedown St John; later that day, a grass fire was reported on nearby Keel's Hill, forcing the closure of the nearby Bath Road. Several bus routes were cancelled or diverted as a result. At around 10:35 am on 27 June, a grass fire broke out on an embankment alongside the A4174 Ring Road, Longwell Green which was closed for several hours as a result as crews from the Avon Fire and Rescue Service brought the fire under control.

The Quack monument or Marie-Adolffontein is a monument in Nijmegen, in the Dutch province of Gelderland. The Quack monument was originally founded in 1926 from a legacy of Arnoldus Burchard Adolphus Quack (Nijmegen, 6 April 1842 - Nijmegen, 11 November 1920). Quack was alderman of the municipality of Nijmegen from 1902 to 1919. The monument is named after him and his twin sister Maria (Marie) Christina (Nijmegen, April 6, 1842 - Nijmegen, March 15, 1905). Quack left his legacy to the municipality of Nijmegen under the condition that a fountain, the Marie Adolphron named after his sister, would be erected. Architect Willem Bijlard designed the monument that contains four fountains and four bells at the base and four lanterns at the top. The lower part is made of granito. The obelisk is made of red granite with carved art-deco ornaments. The lanterns and bells are made of bronze. The ornamental surfaces under the bells were made by stonemason Litjes. 75 m3 of granite and 30 m3 of concrete have been processed. It was demolished in 1958 because it had to give way to traffic. Several parts, such as the glass parts and the bells were destroyed by, among other things, the bombing of Nijmegen in 1944. The different parts were stored for years. In 1976 there was mention of the monument to be erected in the new Dukenburg district. Eventually the monument was rebuilt in 2000 in the same place where it stood until 1958. The monument is often compared to a phallus. On World AIDS Day 2004 a huge 'condom' was drawn over the monument.

Life  Zorn, who was the son of professor , attended primary school in Bad Soden from 1949 to 1953, then the Leibniz Realgymnasium in Frankfurt. After graduating in 1962, he studied at the Technical University of Karlsruhe, specializing in communications engineering and graduated with a degree in engineering in 1967. He then earned his doctorate, with his instructor being Karl Steinbuch, with the thesis Setting method for linear and non-linear classifiers (German: Einstellverfahren f√ºr lineare und nichtlineare Klassifikatoren) in the field of character recognition. In 1972, he moved to the newly founded Department of Computer Science of the University of Karlsruhe (TH), where he was responsible for the development, operation and further development of the Informatik- Rechnerabteilung (IRA) data center for 25 years. After his appointment as a professor in 1979, he chose the topics of methodological performance analysis and data communication as one of his main fields, which he has continued to pursue ever since.

He came into conflict with the German Research Network DFN and became the main critic of its funding policy, which was strictly OSI-oriented and against the TCP/IP-based Internet lasting until the 1990s. After moving to the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI) at the University of Potsdam in 2001, Zorn devoted himself to the problem of hierarchically consistent modeling of communication systems in teaching and research, resulting, in particular, in 2007 in a methodologically novel approach to the quantitative analysis of discrete dynamical systems.

It premiered on the 5th of February, 1757, and was first published in that same year. In it, the impoverished poet, Cape, attempts to impress Arabella's brother Cadwallader in order to get his consent to marry her.  Plot Summary   Act One  Robin reports to Governor Cape that his deception to make the Governor's son think his father dead has succeeded, and the young man took the news solemnly. The Governor is preparing to test whether his son is worthy of his inheritance. They prepare to go see Young Cape, who is toiling in a print shop and trying to get rid of the Printer's Devil. The Devil pays him and leaves, and a Poet enters, looking for work. Cape shuts him out, bemoaning the poverty of poets, and his friend Sprightly arrives. Sprightly has invited Mr. Cadwallader, the brother of Cape's love, Arabella, to come meet him later. Mr. Vamp, the bookseller for whom Cape works, arrives, and Cape pretends that Sprightly is a sermon-writer. Vamp requests some pamphlets of Sprightly's be published. Arabella, along with Mr. and Mrs. Cadwallader arrive, and Cape pretends to be absorbed in writing, to impress them. Cadwallader asks Sprightly to invite him to the next dinner he has with an important person. Arabella warns Cape that her brother will have a hard time overlooking his poverty and obscure birth, and advises him to charm his wife, as a more certain way of gaining his favours. Mr. and Mrs. Cadwallader consult Cape on which school they should send their son to, Mr. Cadwallader saying that school is a very useful place to make acquaintances that might be useful in later life. Cape sides with Mrs. Cadwallader, and the couple invites him to dinner later that day. They leave, and the Governor (in disguise) arrives with Robin, who tries to hire Cape to write a letter praising the Governor‚ÄîCape refuses, saying that he can't since he isn't acquainted with the gentleman well enough. Sprightly has devised a plan to get Cadwallader out of the way for the evening, and when he returns he invites Cadwallader to dine with him and Robin, who he pretends to be ‚ÄúPrince Potowowski of the Tartarians‚Äù, with the Governor as his Interpreter.  Act Two  Mrs. Cadwallader is beating Cape at cards, and he suggests a game of Questions. Things escalate when the first question is ‚Äúdo you love me?‚Äù, and Mrs. Cadwallader misinterprets his playing along with her as Cape genuinely flirting. Arabella interrupts, and Mrs. Cadwallader goes to hide and observe the two. Arabella is affronted to have discovered Cape seemingly courting her sister-in-law when he said he loved her, which he reassures her of, which causes Mrs. Cadwallader to reveal herself. Mr. Cadwallader, along with Sprightly and the supposed foreigners, arrive, and Mrs. Cadwallader denounces Cape's impropriety to her husband. At length, she tells him the story, and Cadwallader becomes furious with Cape for making love to Arabella. He scoffs at the notion that he would ever consent to mix the pedigreed blood of the Cadwalladers with the lowness of Cape's poet origins. Then, the Governor speaks up, claiming Cape as his son, rebuking Cadwallader, and saying how proud he is to find Cape worthy of his inheritance.

The county was located in the eastern part of Greater Romania, in the southwestern part of Bessarabia. Cahul County was bordered by the counties of Cetatea AlbƒÉ and Tighina to the east, LƒÉpu»ôna to the north, County, Tutova and Covurlui to the west, and Ismail to the south. Its territory underwent changes in the north, where one third of Plasa Cantemir was for some time part of FƒÉlciu County, and in the south, where the communes of Br√Ænza, Coliba»ôi, VƒÉleni, and VulcƒÉne»ôti were left in Cahul County, while the communes of Valea-Stejarului, Grecenii-BurlƒÉcenilor, and BulgƒÉrica were part of Ismail County. Plasa Drago≈ü-Voda, headquartered at Albota was renamed Plasa Mihai Viteazu. Its territory is currently part of the Republic of Moldova, corresponding roughly to the districts Cahul, Cantemir, Leova, Taraclia and the VulcƒÉne»ôti district (dolay) from Gagauzia. Administrative organization The county was administratively divided into five districts (plƒÉ·π£i):Portretul Rom√¢niei Interbelice - Jude»õul Cahul #Plasa Cantemir, headquartered at Leova #Plasa Ioan Voevod, headquartered at Cahul #Plasa »òtefan cel Mare, headquartered at Baimaclia #Plasa Traian, headquartered at Taraclia #Plasa Mihai Viteazul, headquartered at Albota History At the end of the Crimean War, by the Treaty of Paris (1856), Southern Bessarabia was returned by the Russian Empire to Moldavia. Southern Bessarabia was administratively organized into 3 counties: Cahul, Bolgrad and Ismail, and it was part of Moldavia and, after 1859, part of the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia (called Romania after 1866) until 1878, when by the Treaty of Berlin (1878) all three counties were ceded back to the Russian Empire in exchange for Northern Dobruja. With the Union of Bessarabia with Romania in 1918, Cahul County returned to Romania, being formally re-established in 1925. After the 1938 Administrative and Constitutional Reform, this county merged with the counties of BrƒÉila, Covurlui, FƒÉlciu, Ismail, Putna, R√¢mnicu SƒÉrat, Tecuci, Tulcea and Tutova to form »öinutul DunƒÉrii. The area of the county was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 and became part of the Moldavian SSR. The area returned to Romanian administration following the Axis Powers' invasion of the Soviet Union in July 1941. A military administration was established and the region's Jewish population was either executed on the spot or deported to Transnistria, where further numbers were killed. As the Soviet Union's offensive pushed the Axis powers back, the area again was under Soviet control. On September 12, 1944, Romania signed the Moscow Armistice with the Allies. The Armistice, as well as the subsequent peace treaty of 1947, confirmed the Soviet-Romanian border as it was on January 1, 1941.United States Department of State.

McClure grave at Chester Rural Cemetery in Chester, Pennsylvania John J. McClure (September 24, 1886 ‚Äì March 28, 1965) was an American politician from Pennsylvania who served as a Republican member of the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 9th district from 1929 to 1937. He was a major force in the Republican Party in Delaware County, Pennsylvania and a political boss who controlled one of the oldest and most corrupt political machines in U.S. history. In 1933, McClure was found guilty in federal court and sentenced to 18 months in prison for vice and rum-running but his conviction was overturned on appeal. Early life and education McClure was born in Chester, Pennsylvania and was educated in the public schools. In 1905, McClure graduated from the Swarthmore Preparatory School. McClure attended two years at Swarthmore College but left school in 1907 to take care of his deceased father, William McClure's, business interests. Business career McClure was president of McClure & Co., Pennsylvania Paving Co. and Chester Construction and Contracting Company and Chester Beverage Company. He was vice president and director of the Consumers Ice and Coal Company; treasurer and director of Allison Steel Products Co.; director of the Cambridge Trust Co. and the First National Bank of Chester. Political career McClure served as a member of the Pennsylvania Senate for the 9th district from 1929 to 1937. McClure was a major force in the Republican party in Chester, Pennsylvania and then in Delaware County. He built one of the strongest and most corrupt political machines in U.S. history. McClure led the Delaware County Republican Board of Supervisors, also known as the War Board, which controlled county politics for decades. McClure hand picked candidates for county, city council, mayoral and school board elections. The base of power for McClure and the Chester and Delaware County Republican political machine was liquor. McClure controlled local and county level officials dependent on Chester's liquor licensing and saloon trade. Rum Ring Trial On November 23, 1933, McClure and 69 associates in the \\"rum ring\\" trial were found guilty in federal court of vice and rum running. The prosecution charged that McClure received protection money and created weekly lists of speakeasies that would be permitted to operate and those that did not pay up and were to be closed. The prosecution contended that in 11 years of operation, the rum ring was able to charge between $25 and $200 a week for every illegal speakeasy in Delaware County to operate and raised $2,748,900 in collection fees. Ships were allowed to bring liquor shipments into Chester at a rate of $1.50 per sack. An ex-constable testified at trial that he personally handed McClure $30,000 from one shipment. Between the summer in 1929 and January 1931, one Philadelphia bootlegging gang paid McClure between $65,000 and $70,000 for liquor brought through the Chester port. In 1933, McClure was sentenced to 18 months in prison and assessed a $10,000 fine but he did not serve one day nor pay the fine because of the repeal of the 18th Amendment to the United States Constitution. McClure's trial occurred after repeal had been voted on. His appeal to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was upheld on this technicality and came within the decision of the United States Supreme Court that all liquor prosecutions pending on the date of repeal of prohibition were to be thrown out. After McClure's conviction, an effort was made to remove him from the Pennsylvania Senate but it failed. McClure lost his reelection bid for Pennsylvania Senate in 1936 to Weldon Brinton Heyburn due to public outcry over his protected status and ability to avoid imprisonment. Following the loss, McClure retired to Florida but was persuaded to move back to Pennsylvania by J. Howard Pew and Joseph N. Pew Jr., owners of the Sun Shipbuilding & Drydock Company in Chester, and accept the position as Delaware County's Republican Party leader. They offered McClure funding for future elections and control over hiring decisions for all positions at the Sun shipyard and Sun Oil refinery in nearby Marcus Hook. One had to have a letter of recommendation from McClure in order to be hired at the shipyard. Republican party membership was a prerequisite to employment at the Sun shipyard and president J. Howard Pew would call \\"mandatory meetings\\" for machine-sponsored political rallies. In 1941, McClure was indicted for conspiracy to gain a $250,000 profit from the sale of the Chester Water Works to a private buyer. McClure and four Chester City Council members were acquitted but ordered by the court to return the money to the city of Chester. In the 1960 presidential campaign, Richard Nixon was campaigning in Chester, Pennsylvania. McClure was in poor health but due to his prominence in Delaware County Republican politics, Nixon stopped his motorcade as it moved down Providence Avenue in front of McClure's house and went up to the porch to shake McClure's hand. Personal life McClure was married and divorced three times. One of those wives was Gertrude Holmes McClure and together they had four children. McClure was a member of the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity and a 32nd degree Mason. McClure was a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks and the Fraternal Order of Eagles. McClure is interred at the Chester Rural Cemetery in Chester, Pennsylvania.

It is the second spin-off of the Five Nights at Freddy's series, the first one being FNaF World. The game was released on June 27, 2018 for free on Steam and Game Jolt. It was originally going to be DLC for Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator, but was later decided to be its own separate game. Gameplay The game allows the player to choose from 50 characters from all six main Five Nights at Freddy's games and FNaF World, and set their difficulty levels for the night from a minimum of \\"0\\" to a maximum of \\"20\\". During the night, the player must keep track of several mechanics, such as doors, ventilation systems, and air duct systems to avoid being attacked by the animatronics. The player can earn \\"Faz-Coins\\" to buy power-ups and deflect animatronics, and a \\"Death Coin\\" to eliminate a certain animatronic from the current night. The player is also able to select the office setting, choose power-ups that may help them during the night, and select 16 challenges available to them. The objective is to survive from 12 AM to 6 AM, with each hour in-game lasting 45 seconds. In the final release, 59 characters from the franchise were included, with some appearing without the player's choice. Plot Although the game seems to be non-canon to the franchise, many elements in the game suggest that it might have a canon plot. After the player dies by certain characters, they speak certain lines that suggest that the player might actually be William Afton's soul trapped in a purgatory-like state after being burnt in the previous installment, tortured by various animatronics as consequences of his actions. Every speaking antagonist mentions an unknown entity, referred to as \\"the one you should not have killed\\", who is thought to stay with William Afton to torture him. The entity is widely regarded to be the spirit living inside Golden Freddy because, after obtaining the highest score possible, a cutscene of Golden Freddy, twitching and surrounded by darkness, is shown. A rare screen also shows an obscured face of a small, grinning child thought to be the \\"vengeful spirit\\". During the night, if Old Man Consequences is set to \\"1\\" and all other characters are inactive, then, after catching a fish, a scene from FNaF World will be shown, with Old Man Consequences talking to a bear sprite (possibly Golden Freddy), telling him to leave the \\"demon\\" (Afton) to his own demons and rest in peace. Development In February 2018, after the release of Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator, Cawthon announced in a Steam post that he would think about gaining help from larger publishers in making future games. In an edited version of the same post, he added that he would be developing an \\"ultimate custom night‚Äù add-on for Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator, which, as revealed on his website, would have more than 50 animatronics from the entire series attacking the player. After some time, he decided that it would be too big an update for the game, so he made it a separate game. As he was programming the characters in the game, he would update the \\"progress bar\\" on his website, along with a brief description of the characters on a Steam post.  Reception  Rock, Paper, Shotgun deemed the game \\"an intriguing mess\\", with PC Gamer calling it \\"a neat, customisable take on the classic survival horror formula\\".

Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626 (1985), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that states can require an advertiser to disclose certain information without violating the advertiser's First Amendment free speech protections as long as the disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the State's interest in preventing deception of consumers.. The decision effected identified that some commercial speech may have weaker First Amendment free speech protections than non-commercial speech and that states can compel such commercial speech to protect their interests; future cases have relied on the \\"Zauderer standard\\" to determine the constitutionality of state laws that compel commercial speech as long as the information to be disclosed is \\"purely factual and uncontroversial\\". Background Philip Q. Zauderer was an attorney practicing in Columbus, Ohio. To expand his business, in 1981, he had an advertisement printed in The Columbus Citizen-Journal offering to represent clients charged with drunk driving, with language stating that their legal fees would be refunded if they were convicted of drunk driving. On the second day the ad was run, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel for the Supreme Court of Ohio contacted Zauderer, stating that the ad appeared to suggest he would represent criminal defendants on a contingent-fee basis, which violated the state's Code of Professional Responsibility. Zauderer immediately withdrew the ad and stated he would not take any cases from people responding to the ad. Later, in 1982, Zauderer took another advertisement in several Ohio newspapers, this time offering his services on a contingent-fee basis for any women that may have been injured by the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device. His ad included an illustration of the Dalkon Shield, and descriptive language of the alleged injuries that women may have suffered from the device. While the ad successfully drew him clients, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel took further issue with this ad, and formally filed a complaint against Zauderer resulting from ads for violating several Ohio Disciplinary Rules. Among several complaints, the Office specifically called to the illustration and language that Zauderer used within the Dalkon ad as failing to be \\"dignified\\". Other violations asserted by the state including the misleading information on the drunk driving ad, how he offered his services in the Dalkon ad, and choice of language to represent his contingent-fee basis, including omission that clients may still be liable for costs, in and above attorney fees, even if they would lose the case. The Office specifically noted that they did not consider other information and advice in the Dalkon ad to be fraudulent or misleading. At his hearing at the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline for the Ohio Supreme Court, Zauderer stated that Ohio's Disciplinary Rules related to the content of advertisements violated his rights to advertise under the First Amendment, as previously decided by Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, , and In re R.M.J., . The Board rejected Zauderer's defense, and on his appeal, the Supreme Court of Ohio upheld the conclusions from the Board, specifically noting that Bates and In re R.M.J. were aimed towards preventing deceptive advertising. The Supreme Court of Ohio also stated that In re R.M.J. suggested that states could regulate non-deceptive advertising to serve a narrow state interest; in this case, requiring disclosure of contingent-fee arrangements was deemed necessary by the state to assure potential clients would not misled. Supreme Court Zauderer petitioned to the Supreme Court on several issued raised by the case, which accepted the case and heard oral arguments on January 7, 1985. The Court issued its decision on May 25, 1985. While the Court reversed some of the disciplinary actions against Zauderer by the Supreme Court of Ohio, it affirmed that court's decision that the state could regulate commercial speech. With Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. not participating in the case, the opinion of a generally-unanimous count was written by Justice Byron White, joined in full by Justices Blackmun and Stevens, and in part by Brennan and Marshall (both who joined a concurrence in part and dissent in part) and in part by Burger, Rehnquist and O'Connor (who also joined in a separate concurrence in part and dissent in part). The principal matter of Zauderer centered on the requirement of Ohio's Disciplinary Rules for disclosure of contingent-fee arrangements. White wrote: > The State has attempted only to prescribe what shall be orthodox in > commercial advertising, and its prescription has taken the form of a > requirement that appellant include in his advertising purely factual and > uncontroversial information about the terms under which his services will be > available. Because the extension of First Amendment protection to commercial > speech is justified principally by the value to consumers of the information > such speech provides, appellant's constitutionally protected interest in not > providing any particular factual information in his advertising is minimal. > . . . [B]ecause disclosure requirements trench much more narrowly on an > advertiser's interests than do flat prohibitions on speech, ‚Äúwarning[s] or > disclaimer[s] might be appropriately required . . . in order to dissipate > the possibility of consumer confusion or deception. Due to this reasoning, the Court upheld the disciplinary action against Zauderer for failing to disclose the contingent-fee terms from both ads, while following similar logic, found that the state had no protected interest against the use of factual illustrative material nor claims of representation, and overturned the Office's actions on these points. Impact Zauderer has led to the establishment of the \\"Zauderer standard\\" to determine when a state's interest in compelling parts of commercial speech is valid. This test employees the \\"purely factual and uncontroversial information\\" language from the Zauderer decision to judge if such disclosure requirements are constitutional compelled commercial speech. The standard is frequently used in cases involving the labeling of food or other products. The Zauderer standard has generally been held for when the government is seeking to prevent deception, but within the 21st century, a number of cases heard at the Circuit courts have considered the Zauderer standard applied to government language that is not strictly to prevent deception, creating a precedent. Such cases include: * American Meat Institute v. USDA, held in the D.C. Appeals Court, found that Zauderer applied to the government's demand for meat packagers to include the country of origin of their product on packaging, even when considering the result of Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission, . * National Electrical Manufacturers Association v. Sorrell, held in the Second Circuit, found that Zauderer applied to the addition of disclosure labels warning consumers that fluorescent light bulbs contained mercury and should be disposed as hazardous waste. * CTIA‚ÄîThe Wireless Association v. City of Berkeley, held in the Ninth Circuit, used Zauderer to justify the constitutionality of city laws requiring cell phone providers to warn users about potentially receiving higher-than-recommended levels of radiation if they keep their cell phone in their pockets. The Supreme Court case of National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra established that there is a limit to how much Zauderer can apply; the Court ruled that required signage to be posted at crisis pregnancy centers notifying potential patients of state-provided abortion services did not fall under the Zauderer standard as it was unjustified and imposed a burden on a specific targeted set of speakers. The Court subsequently ordered the CTIA case, which had been petitioned to the Supreme Court, to be reconsidered in light of the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates decision. The appeals court reconsidered and reaffirmed its previous conclusion, stating that Berkeley‚Äôs warning is ‚Äúliterally true,‚Äù promotes public health and does not require retailers to post messages that violate their beliefs.

The library is one of the largest college libraries at the University of Oxford and has achieved 100% student satisfaction in several annual surveys. Somerville College Library is situated north of the main quadrangle, facing the Chapel. It is open 24 hours a day, has Wi-Fi, several study rooms and computers, and the main student colour printer and scanner. The library is a Grade II-listed building. History The Edwardian building was built in 1903 and designed by Sir Basil Champneys. It was officially opened in 1904 by John Morley. Robert Bridges wrote Demeter specially for this opening, at which it was performed for the first time. Somerville College Library was the first library for women at the University of Oxford, and among the very first college libraries built at Oxford with the needs of the undergraduates rather than the fellows in mind. During the First World War, Somerville college became a hospital for convalescing officers and the library was a popular place for beds to be placed, overlooking the gardens. Siegfried Sassoon and Robert Graves were both to reminisce of their time at Somerville Hospital. Indira Gandhi had her room in the building, before the ground floor was added to the library in 1974. Collection The library has a collection of approximately 2,000 books from the philosopher and women's rights activist John Stuart Mill and his father James Mill, the so-called John Stuart Mill Library, which was donated in 1905. The books contain many notes by Mill himself, which are being catalogued and researched by the University of Alabama and Oxford.JS Mill scribbles reveal he was far from a chilly Victorian intellectual, The Guardian, April 30, 2018John Stuart Mill's marginalia tells us much about the great thinker's mind, The Conversation, April 30, 2018 Other notable donations or collections are from Amelia Edwards, Robert Bridges, John Ruskin, William Morris, Vernon Lee, Mary Lascelles and alumnae Vera Brittain, Margery Fry, Margaret Kennedy, Vivien Noakes and Muriel St. Clare Byrne. The library also owns letters from Ada Lovelace, notes from Mary Somerville and a letter from Charles Babbage addressed to Somerville. These are stored, however, in the Bodleian Library.Catalogue of the Mary Somerville Collection, (c.1700) -1972, University of Oxford, Bodleian Library, March 15, 2013 The library contains paintings by Mary Somerville, John Constable, Maud Sumner and Patrick George. The special collections include one of the first editions of Gustave Dor√©'s illustrated Divine Comedy by Dante, published by Hachette Livre, from 1861; a print of the Divine Comedy from 1578 with 15th century commentary; a print of the works of Geoffrey Chaucer from 1570; an English translation of Giambattista della Porta's Magia Naturalis from 1658; a copy of Shakespeare's Second Folio which was part of David Garrick's library; and a copy of the second edition of Isaac Newton's Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica from 1713. To allow for future growth the library was built to contain about 60,000 books, while it possessed only 6,000 at opening. At the time female students had no access to the other libraries at the university. Today, the library holds approximately 120,000 items, 95,000 of which are on open shelves.

It was first published in 1778, along with the censored version entitled The Capuchin, which was first performed in 1776. In the original, Jenny Minnikin and Dick Drugget elope to France, followed closely by the Minnikin parents, Jenny's suitor Codling, and her aunt Mrs. Clack. To escape the family, Jenny temporarily enters a nunnery. Later, they meet Lady Kitty Crocodile, who encourages Jenny to be bigamous. Lady Kitty's servant Miss Lydell marries her worthy lover Colonel Crosby.  Plot summary  The following is a summary of the plot of A Trip to Calais.  Act One  Dick Drugget and Jenny Minnikin are eloping in France (parody of Richard Brinsley Sheridan and Elizabeth Linley). They must find a priest to marry them, and ask Tromfort, the French innkeeper, where one might be found. We learn that Jenny's father is a London pin-maker, and that he intends to choose her husband, while Dick is his assistant. Jenny once ran off with her dancing-master. Tromfort recommends a doctor to marry them, but he is absent. A boat arrives from Dover, and Dick departs to see if it is Jenny's father. Tromfort flirts with Jenny. The family has arrived; to prevent the lovers‚Äô separation, Tromfort will place Jenny in a Catholic convent, while Dick will wait in Boulogne or Dunkirk. Jenny departs with La Jeunesse, Tromfort's wife. Jenny's father's preferred suitor, Kit Codling, arrives with Jenny's parents and Jenny's aunt Mrs Clack, a social- climbing mantua-maker. The family comments on French gentility. Two neighbours from London, Mr. Gingham and Luke Lapelle, enter, and they discuss their experiences in France. In order to be fashionable, Luke travels with his wife, but calls her his mistress.  Act Two  The Minnikins and Mrs. Clack are astounded by Jenny's sudden ambition to become a nun. Codling tries to speak with her, but is rebuffed by the nuns. Father O‚ÄôDonnovan, an Irish capuchin in the town, seems sympathetic initially, but refuses to remove Jenny from the convent until the Minnikins bribe him. O‚ÄôDonnovan tells stories to the gullible Minnikins of Englishmen who have evaded the law and have come to France. The most infamous is the Lady Kitty Crocodile, who has come to France after her husband's death. O‚ÄôDonnovan leaves. Jenny and the Abbess debate the former's taking the veil: Jenny wishes to return to the world, but the Abbess urges her to accept Christ as her spouse. Upon realizing that Jenny will bring no fortune to the convent, however, the Abbess quickly abandons her argument. Mr. and Mrs. Minnikin (and Codling, hidden) come to the Abbey's grate to speak with Jenny. The Abbess counsels Jenny to pretend that she is waiting for divine revelation before she can make a decision about whether to stay in the convent. The Abbess tells Jenny's parents that Jenny has chosen to marry St. Francis. Believing St. Francis is a real suitor, and furious at Jenny's treachery, Mr. and Mrs. Minnikin depart, calling the Abbess a bawd. The Minnikins depart to visit Lady Crocodile. Miss Lydell and Miss Hetty are in deep debate at Kitty Crocodile's. Lady Crocodile enters, and dismisses Hetty in a fit of rage. She accuses Miss Lydell, a maid in waiting, of flirting with many foreign acquaintances. Colonel Crosby enters, and finds Miss Lydell in tears. Hetty announces the Minnikin's and Mrs. Clack's arrival.  Act Three  Hetty and Colonel Crosby talk; Crosby is in love with Miss Lydell. Mrs. Clack, formerly Lady Crocodile's mantua-maker, arrives to find this august lady in deepest mourning. They discuss Sir John, Lady Crocodile's deceased husband, and she faints when Mrs. Clack suggests taking another husband. When Lady Crocodile has been revived, Mrs. Clack asks for her help in removing Jenny from the convent; Lady Crocodile claims her hands are tied because of her personal friendship with the Pope. After they exit the room, Colonel Crosby emerges from a hiding place, calling Lady Crocodile an ‚ÄúEphesian Matron‚Äù, and expressing his intentions to pursue Miss Lydell to her friend Hetty. Jenny arrives at her parents‚Äô apartment, surrounded by guards. Lady Crocodile arrives, but Minnikin's account of the story is consistently interrupted by Luke Lapelle. Lady Crocodile speaks to Jenny alone; the latter confesses that the convent is just part of the plot to avoid marriage to Codling. Lady Kitty recommends marrying both Dick Drugget and Kit Codling. Jenny is excited by the prospect. Colonel Crosby and Miss Lydell appear and announce their intentions to return to England. Hetty has the last word: Jenny and Lady Crocodile are well matched, and Miss Lydell need feel no regret on leaving Jenny entrapped by the ‚Äúgalling yoke of a capricious and whimsical tyrant!‚Äù  Differences between A Trip to Calais and The Capuchin  Several characters that don't exist in the original replace others in the later version, including Dr. Viper, a Protestant priest working for Lady Deborah Dripping, and a villainous co-conspirator to O'Donnovan, as well as Sir Harry Hemper, and Peter Packthread, who replace Mr. Gingham and Luke Lapelle from the original. As the title suggests, Father O'Donnovan also features more heavily in the later version, while Lady Kitty Crocodile is removed entirely.  Act Three  The third act of The Capuchin was a complete overhaul of the original third act of A Trip to Calais.

The lists won sixteen and twenty seats, respectively, and she was not included in her party's assembly delegation on either occasion.

Characterization The two smallest permutations that cannot be partitioned into an increasing and a decreasing sequence are 3412 and 2143. was the first to establish that a skew-merged permutation can also be equivalently defined as a permutation that avoids the two patterns 3412 and 2143. A permutation is skew-merged if and only if its associated permutation graph is a split graph, a graph that can be partitioned into a clique (corresponding to the descending subsequence) and an independent set (corresponding to the ascending subsequence). The two forbidden patterns for skew-merged permutations, 3412 and 2143, correspond to two of the three forbidden induced subgraphs for split graphs, a four-vertex cycle and a graph with two disjoint edges, respectively. The third forbidden induced subgraph, a five-vertex cycle, cannot exist in a permutation graph (see ). Enumeration For n=1,2,3,\\\\dots the number of skew-merged permutations of length n is :1, 2, 6, 22, 86, 340, 1340, 5254, 20518, 79932, 311028, 1209916, 4707964, 18330728, ... . was the first to show that the generating function of these numbers is :\\\\frac{1-3x}{(1-2x)\\\\sqrt{1-4x}}, from which it follows that the number of skew-merged permutations of length n is given by the formula :\\\\binom{2n}{n}\\\\sum_{m=0}^{n-1}2^{n-m-1}\\\\binom{2m}{m} and that these numbers obey the recurrence relation :P_n=\\\\frac{(9n-8)P_{n-1} - (26n-46)P_{n-2} + (24n-60)P_{n-3}}{n}.

Opening performance The play opened on Monday, the 20th of June, 1763 at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, where it ran until the 3rd of September, 1763. It was first published in 1764. The play's original cast featured low comic actor Thomas Weston, who had been with Foote's troupe since 1760, in the part of Jerry Sneak, while Foote himself played the Major. The affable and pathetic character of Sneak was very popular, so much so that Sid Sondergard wrote in 1989 that \\"his name passed into the vernacular in the same manner as the modern cartoon character, Caspar Milquetoast\\"  Plot summary   Act one  Lint, a doctor, arrives to see Sir Jacob; it is the day of the Garrat elections, and Lint is prepared to deal with the injuries to result from the carnival. They debate quack medicine. The argument escalates, and Sir Jacob turns Lint out of the house. Major Sturgeon arrives. The Major describes a battle, and discusses the merits of various companies with Sir Jacob. However, he had hoped to visit with Sir Jacob's two married daughters. The Major is to act as magistrate for the election of the new mayor; he and Sir Jacob expect many oaths from the townspeople today. Roger, a servant, enters, and announces that the people outside are suggesting a candidate for the position of mayor. Sturgeon leaves, to Sir Jacob's comment that ‚Äúthe fish is got out of his element.‚Äù He returns with Mrs. Sneak, one of Sir Jacob's daughters, and her husband, who promptly leaves again. Mrs. Sneak expresses her displeasure with Sneak, calling him ‚ÄúMeek! a Mushroom! a Milk- Fop!‚Äù Sir Jacob leaves, and Mrs. Sneak and the Major flirt. Sneak returns just as the Major begins to kiss Mrs. Sneak's hand. She leaves; Sneak and the Major discuss her merits. Bruin and his wife (Mrs. Sneak's sister) enter. The Major quickly leaves to ‚Äúattend to the lady [Mrs. Sneak] instantly‚Äù, with Sneak's encouragement. Mrs. Bruin is thoroughly dominated by her husband; she exits at his orders, and Sneak expresses his envy at Bruin's control, as Mrs. Sneak allows him only two shillings a week for his own pocket-money. Bruin agrees to help Sneak beat Mrs. Sneak, but she calls for him, causing Sneak loses his will; he comments ‚Äúwhat a sad life do I lead‚Äù.  Act two  The mob gathers under the window. Sir Jacob suggests that the common people in the mob have the potential to be great orators: ‚Äúyou will meet with materials to make a Sylla, a Cicero, a Solon, or a Caesar‚Äù. All exit. The mob enters, with Heel- Tap at their head. Heel-Tap presides over the election, as various candidates‚Äô proposals are read aloud. Sneak goes after the Major and Mrs. Sneak, who have disappeared again. One candidate, Matthew Mug, presents his arguments for how to improve the town, but Heel-Tap refuses a bribe and denounces him. Sir Jacob's family returns; he chastises Bruin for his harsh treatment of his wife. Sneak rushes in, having discovered that the Major and Mrs. Sneak are in the locked summer-house. Heel-Tap enters, and announces that Sneak has been elected mayor. Mrs. Sneak enters, and Sneak stands up to her, announcing that he will begin to live his life as he chooses: ‚Äúif some folks go into gardens with Majors, mayhap other people will go into garrets with maids.‚Äù She abuses Sneak, but he and Bruin have the upper hand. The Major enters. Bruin makes Mrs. Sneak cry and fights with the Major; Sneak capitulates to his wife's sobs. Mrs Sneak demands that another person be elected mayor. Sir Jacob suggests that Heel-Tap act as the ‚ÄúLocum tenens‚Äù (deputy).  Influence from Restoration Comedy  Mary Megie Belden asserted in 1929 that The Mayor of Garratt had much more in common with comedies of the Restoration era, than with contemporary 18th-century plays, observing that \\"Sneak and Bruin with their respective wives have been easily recognized as descendants of Bisket and Fribble with their respective wives in Epsom Wells [written by Thomas Shadwell], and the scene where Sneak peeps through the key-hole of the summer- house in Act 2 was doubtless suggested by a scene in the same play.\\" References Category:1763 plays Category:Plays by Samuel Foote Category:British plays ","title":"The Mayor of Garret"},{"id":"57781192","text":"Dr. Thelma Gunawardena (1934-2015) was the first female Director of the National Museum of Colombo.

It organised competitions between the member societies and established a \\"Union Parliament\\" to debate issues of the day. In 1932 a similar organization named Literary Societies' Union of South Australia was founded. History A popular form of social and intellectual entertainment for young gentlemen in late nineteenth and early twentieth century Adelaide was the literary society, which at its peak numbered around fifty, some, perhaps most, attached to churches. Facilities and entertainments enjoyed by members apart from companionship of like-minded individuals, and perhaps a little networking, may have included: *Maintenance of a library. At a time when the cost of a book could equal a workman's weekly wages, a valuable resource. *Appearance of guest speakers *Readings by members of original or favourite poetry or prose pieces *Impromptu speeches on literary subjects *Debates Tournaments Early in 1883 several of these \\"self-improvement\\" bodies resolved to have a tournament to test their various literary skills on stage before an audience. Preliminary contests for the \\"impromptu speaking\\" and \\"elocution\\" sections were held some weeks prior to reduce the number of contestants to a workable half-dozen. Original poetry and essay (on the subject \\"Federation of the Australian Colonies\\") were judged weeks beforehand. It was a condition of entry that debating partisan politics and sectarian religion was forbidden on penalty of disqualification. Thanks to some excellent organisation and the willing participation of some very distinguished public figures, the competition, held 16 August 1883 at the Adelaide Town Hall, where fifteen societies were represented, was deemed a success, though the standard of judging was questioned, and a useful profit realised and shared between the Children's Hospital and the Home for Incurables. Associations represented in the competition were: Adelaide Young Men's Society, North Adelaide Young Men's Society, Pirie Street Young Men's Society, Trinity Young Men's Society, St. John's Young Men's Society, Port Adelaide Young Men's Society, Norwood Social and Literary Club, St. Andrew's Young Men's Society, Caledonian Literary Society, St. Bartholomew's Young Men's Society, Hindmarsh Young Men's Society, Archer Street Young Men's Society, Unitarian Young Men's Society, Glenelg Literary Association, and the Hindmarsh Literary Association. Prominent among the instigators were W. H. Selway and T. H. Smeaton Claims by W. D. Ponder that the concept was his were refuted by George Hussey. The Union was founded in September 1883 as a conference of 16 literary societies. The Union's first official tournament (or competition as they were thenceforth titled) was held in the Adelaide Town Hall on 12 September 1884 and followed a similar format. Participating societies were the Kent Town Mutual Improvement Association, Adelaide Young Men's Society, Norwood Literary Society, St. Andrew's Young Men's Society, Pirie-street Literary Association, Glenelg Literary Association, Unitarian Young Men's Society, Y.M.C.A. Literary Society. Judges included Sir Henry Ayers, the Hon. R. A. Tarlton and Dr. E. C. Stirling. The poetry section was won and read by a female, Though ostensibly all-male, several of the Union's member societies admitted women as associate members. Growth and decay The Union comprised 18 member societies in December 1883, 34 in 1887, 35 in 1894, but only 23 in 1897. Membership recovered somewhat by 1899, thanks largely to the efforts of secretary Best, and by 1904 there were 44, but by 1910 interest had collapsed and in 1915 consisted of only seven associated societies. By 1913 the newspapers were devoting much of their space to the likelihood of war, and from 1914 literary attainments were a long way from the minds of most young men, and the societies would have been greatly depleted by those sent overseas. In 1920 there were only five member societies. The Union still existed in 1926, but little information is readily available. In 1932 a similar society was formed, titled the Literary Societies' Union of South Australia. A 1937 newspaper article, after charting the rise and fall of the original Union, identifies the new Union with the original: \\"The continued growth of the Literary Societies' Union of South Australia, as it is now called, is proof of the societies' worth.\\" Yearbook Yearbooks were published in 1884, 1885, \\". . . interesting to [those] whose interests its compilation is designed to serve. 1886, compiled by George F.

Further yearbooks were published in 1898 and possibly the next year or two, but newspapers' interest had waned and were not mentioned. The yearbook, which had started as a simple record of the Union's activities, membership and finances, had increased in size and scope year by year until it boasted around 150 pages and included full texts of contest-winning articles and members' contributions. Then doubts arose as to the usefulness of such a publication, appearing so many months after the annual tournament. Plans were made to replace the yearbook with a monthly magazine, but that may have never eventuated.

Participants in Union Parliament were all members of associated literary societies, the number of delegates from each society being proportional to its membership. Sittings were held fortnightly, originally in the Oddfellows' Hall in Franklin Street on alternate Thursdays and latterly on alternate Tuesdays at the YMCA hall, and attracted members of the public to witness the proceedings (the \\"Visitors' Gallery\\"). Certain positions in Union Parliament were elected annually by members of the Literary Societies' Union: *Premier, who then had two weeks to appoint his Ministry *Leader of the Opposition *Speaker, a critical position, requiring an intimate knowledge of parliamentary Standing Orders as well as the wit and personality needed to maintain order, as Union Parliament could become as unruly as that on North Terrace. This position was held by only three men in the history of Union Parliament. *Functionaries necessary to the operation of the Parliament (secretary, treasurer, clerk etc.) The role of Governor (analogous to the State Governor, and whose only duties were ceremonial) was attached to whoever was the current president of the Literary Societies' Union. The first year The first sitting was held on 8 May 1884, and the Cabinet consisted of: *J. G. Jenkins, Chief Secretary and Premier *T. W. Fleming, Attorney- General *J. Ashton, Treasurer *H. D. Gell, Commissioner of Crown Lands *F. Johnson, Commissioner of Public Works *W. J. Sowden, Minister of Education *T. H. Smeaton, Leader of the Opposition non-party officers were: *W. C. Calder, Speaker *G. F. Hussey, Clerk (also Secretary and Treasurer) *F. Hussey, Assistant Clerk *J. T. Fitch, T. H. Smeaton, and R. M. Steele, committee Subjects debated in the first sitting of Union Parliament were: Federation, free and compulsory education, the Bible in schools, stamps and progressive taxation, in many cases anticipating debates in State Parliament. Ashton delivered his first Budget Speech on 10 July 1884. This Ministry lasted only a few months; it was brought down over a Bill for revision of the tariff. The new Ministry consisted of: *Edward Kay (died 1934), Chief Secretary and Premier *Thomas Gepp (died 1916), Attorney-General *James Sadler (died 1935), Treasurer *John Tassie (died 1934), Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration *Thomas H. Smeaton, Commissioner of Public Works *William Storrie jun., Sixth Minister Speakers In over 40 years Union Parliament had just three Speakers: *W. C. Calder 1884‚Äì1894 *G. F. Hussey 1894‚Äì1924 *P. V. Colebatch 1925‚Äì At first Union Parliament was regarded by the general public as a little presumptuous, and the object of some humour, but by virtue of the seriousness with which the members treated their hobby, this attitude receded. Members undoubtedly benefited by the experience and lessons learned, as witnessed by the number of public figures who remembered their time with the Union Parliament fondly.

It was built from in 1875. The property is owned by the New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Originally an early West Darling property named \\"Menindel\\", it was first held by the explorer John McKinlay in the 1850s. By 1860 it was taken up by Peter McGregor and it had become known as \\"Kinchega\\". Burke and Wills visited it in 1860 and Kinchega's manager, William Wright, accompanied them as third in command and was blamed almost entirely for the tragedy that befell the expedition after he failed to meet the party on its return to Cooper's Creek. In 1870 the station was sold by George Urquhart to Herbert Bristow Hughes. Hughes had two river steamers built in England to service the station named the \\"Jandra\\" and the \\"Nile\\". Steam engines were installed in 1875, by which year \\"Kinchega\\" was running 75,000 sheep and its boundary extended beyond the southern end of the Barrier Ranges. It is during this period that the present shed came into being. Kinchega Station remained in the Hughes family for almost a century. In 1883 when Kinchega was at its peak the property was running 160,000 sheep and employed 73 men. In 1967 Kinchega Woolshed became part of Kinchega National Park, by that time it is estimated that six million sheep had passed through the shed.Sheedy 1983 The woolshed was restored in 1993.  Description  Kinchega Woolshed is a very large linear building constructed of timber frame with corrugated iron cladding. It consists of 26 stands and is built upon a low sandy hill close to the Darling River. The main structure is constructed of trimmed river gum trunks, sawn roof frames and flooring raised well clear of the ground and a wide pitched roof, skillions and walls sheeted with corrugated iron. A notable feature of the building is the pavilion of sweating pens at the southern end; its light stud-frame construction contrasts with the heavier timber of the original section of the shed. Nearby are a cluster of small corrugated iron clad buildings containing the shearer's quarters, cookhouse and stores buildings. Kinchega Woolshed witnessed the evolution in shearing technology that was seen throughout the wool industry during the nineteenth-twentieth centuries. Blades were replaced by mechanical handpieces and the steam traction engine that first powered the machinery stands outside the building. A boiler also is located here. Team was in turn replaced by kerosene and then diesel powered shearing gear. Finally the handpieces were powered by electrical equipment. In addition to the traction engine, the shearing machinery is also present, as is the wool press, wool cranes, a cart and buggy and other equipment. It was reported to be in good physical condition with medium archaeological potential as at 17 September 1997.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Dating from 1875, Kinchega Woolshed is associated with the early pastoral history of the far west of New South Wales.

The property is owned by Roads and Maritime Services, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. The bridge is also called the Carrathool Bridge over Murrumbidgee River and provides a key connection between the Sturt Highway and the Murrumbidgee Road. The bridge was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000. In October 2019 the bridge was replaced by the two-lane concrete Merrylees Bridge.  History  Allan trusses Timber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction. Timber truss bridges were preferred by the Public Works Department from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at Newcastle in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England. Allan trusses were the first truly scientifically engineered timber truss bridges, and incorporate American design ideas for the first time. This is a reflection of the changing mindset of the NSW people, who were slowly accepting that American ideas could be as good as or better than European ones. The high quality and low cost of the Allan truss design entrenched the dominance of timber truss bridges for NSW roads for the next 30 years. Percy Allan, the designer of Allan truss and other bridges, was a senior engineer of the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in late 19th century NSW. Timber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \\"timber bridge state\\". Carrathool Bridge Road entering the bridge The bridge spanning the Murrumbidgee River between Carrathool and the Sturt Highway was completed in 1924. It is an Allan-type timber truss road bridge, and has a bascule-type lift span supported on cylindrical iron piers, designed to allow river-craft to pass. Only three bascule lift span bridges remain in NSW, and the Carrathool bridge is the only one of these in a timber truss road bridge. The Carrathool bridge was constructed in response to public pressure for a bridge to replace the river vehicular punt Funding for work was drawn partly from the local community, and partly from the Department of Public Works. The requirement that local residents pay for half the cost of the bridge \\"was deplored by the then Mayor of Hay, who was a vocal advocate for the rights and the development of the Riverina region\\".‚ÄòCarrathool Bridge over Murrumbidgee River‚Äô, NSW Roads and Traffic Authority website.  Description  Carrathool Bridge is an Allan-type timber truss single-lane road bridge with a steel lift span. It has two timber truss spans, each of . There are three timber approach spans at each end giving the bridge an overall length of . The lift span is of the Bascule type and is supported on cylindrical twin iron piers. The timber truss spans are supported on timber trestles. The bridge provides a carriage way with a minimum width of . A timber post and rail guard rail extends the full length of the bridge. Up until its closure in 2019, the bridge was in intact condition. , the NSW Roads and Maritime Services announced that the heritage-listed Carrathool Bridge would be removed from the New South Wales conservation list of bridges. Its immediate conservation future is unclear.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Completed in 1922, the Carrathool bridge is an Allan-type timber truss road bridge, and has a rare Bascule type lift span to allow river craft to pass. In 1998 it was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss. Allan trusses were third in the five-stage design evolution of NSW timber truss bridges, and were a major improvement over the McDonald trusses which preceded them. Allan trusses were 20% cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50% more load, and were easier to maintain. The Bascule lift span is a rare feature, and has associational links with the historic river trade, and has much to reveal about late 19th century civil engineering and manufacturing technology. In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Carrathool bridge is a representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance. Carrathool Bridge over Murrumbidgee River was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Through the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Bascule lift span is a distinctive visual feature, embodying the spirit of late 19th-century aesthetics. Further, its function can be clearly seen, and shows unambiguously the innovation which went into its design. The bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has substantial aesthetic significance. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Timber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \\"timber truss bridge state\\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The bridge is highly technically significant because it is an example of an Allan truss, and is representative of some major technical developments that were made in timber truss design by the Public Works Department. The Bascule lift span is a rare feature, and has associational links with the historic river trade, and has much to reveal about late 19th century civil engineering and manufacturing technology. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from over 400 built. 3 bascule lift span bridges survive in NSW, and the Carrathool bridge is the only one in a timber truss road bridge. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The bridge is representative of Allan truss bridges.

Defendants included one Soviet collaborator, as well as German military, police, and SS personnel responsible for implementing the occupational policies during the German‚ÄìSoviet War of 1941‚Äì45. The trial was the first time that German personnel had been tried for war crimes by the Allies during and after World War II. Background Units of the German Wehrmacht first occupied Kharkov on 23‚Äì24 October 1941. German forces, including the Einsatzgruppen (mobile death squads), killed tens of thousands of Jews, as well as Communists, Soviet prisoners of war, and other \\"undesirables\\". Shooting, hanging, and gas vans were used. Fifteen thousand Jews were murdered on 15 December 1941 in a mass shooting in Drobytsky Yar. The city was temporarily retaken by the Red Army in February 1943 and then by the Wehrmacht in April 1943. Already in the spring of 1943 Soviet authorities discovered mass graves of the victims, mostly Jews. By the time that Kharkov was liberated for good in August 1943, virtually no Jews survived in the city. Proceedings Konstantin Simonov served as a war correspondent during the trial. The tribunal heard the case against four defendants, one Soviet collaborator and three Germans, members of the Wehrmacht, police, and SS forces, respectively. They were charged both under the Soviet and international law, the Moscow Declarations. The defendants were accused in participating in the murders of Soviet citizens, while the collaborator was charged with treason. Prosecutors, defence counsel, and judges were military. A six-person forensic team provided expert testimony and a report concluding that the manner of killings was consistent with shootings and the use of gas. The defendants admitted to the crimes and described them in detail, including the use of the gas vans, mass shootings, and murder of women and children, encouraged and rewarded by their superiors. Defence counsel's strategy amounted to arguing that the accused were following orders. The prosecution acknowledged that the defendants were indeed acting on superior orders, but rejected this as a valid defence, using the decision of the Leipzig War Crimes Trials as a precedent. The trial concluded on 18 December 1943 with guilty verdicts. The convicted were executed the next day. The proceedings were published in English for an international audience.

It is close to the Central Railway Station and the Lange Hezelstraat. Where the park touches the Parkweg are the remains of the medieval walls with the Kruittoren (powder tower) (built around 1425). History After Nijmegen lost the status of fortified town in the Vestingwet (Constitution) (1874), the demolition of the fortifications started in 1876 and plans were made for the Explanation or expansion of the city. In 1880, the Utrecht garden architect Hendrik Copijn presented his plan for a city park to the west of the old town, where the entire city wall would be demolished. This plan did not make it. The garden and landscape architect Li√©vin Rosseels from Leuven came in 1881 with a new design that was approved. He laid the Kronenburgerpark in 1881‚Äì82 just outside the old city walls, between the Parkweg and the new Kronenburgersingel. He was advised in this by builder Pierre Cuypers, who restored the Powder Tower from 1878 to 1883 and put a major stamp on the decision to keep the city wall and to take it into the park. In the park there is a limestone statue of the Lion, which was donated in 1886 by the Nijmegen embellishment association. The design came from the hand of Henri Leeuw sr. And his son Henri Leeuw jr. The park, sung in a song by Frank Boeijen under the title \\"Kronenburg Park\\" (1985), was known as a hangout for prostitutes and drug addicts. After a radical reorganization, the park was given the appearance in 2005 of a quiet, modern city park.Uitterhoeve, Wilfried; Gerard Lemmens, Nijmegen binnen en buiten de singels, Uitgeverij SUN, Amsterdam, 2007, p. 15. . Situation Down in the park there is a pond, consisting of two parts separated by a bridge. At the top of the park there is a small playground for young children and a petting zoo. Fallow deer, land goats, peacocks and chickens are the permanent residents here. In addition there are also animals, especially in the summer. In 2012, for example, two donkeys could be admired, and in 2013 a small herd of ouessens. National monument The Kronenburgerpark is a national monument and bears number 522957.

Together with the German-Swiss patron Mariann Steegmann, Rieger founded the Mariann-Steegmann-Foundation, which is dedicated to the advancement of women in music and art. In 2012, she was appointed Honorary Senator of the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater Hamburg. Early years and education Eva Rieger was born in London in 1953 to German pastor Julius Rieger and librarian Johanna Kr√ºger Rieger, and later moved to Berlin. Eva studied music education, musicology, and English studies at the Technical University of Berlin, and earned her doctorate in 1976 with a thesis on music education in East Germany. Career From 1978 to 1991, Rieger was an Academic Councilor at the University of G√∂ttingen and the University of Hildesheim. Beginning in 1991, she was a Professor of Historical Musicology at the University of Bremen, with a focus on the social history of music. Rieger also was a member of the Advisory Board for Feministische Studien from 1988 to 1992. Rieger has given lectures in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Europe. In 1996, she co-founded the \\"Women and Gender Research\\" department at the German Society for Music Research. Rieger was an active participant and jury member at the \\"Feminist Theory and Music\\" conference in the United States on several occasions. In 2000, Rieger co-founded the Mariann Steegmann Foundation in collaboration with Mariann Steegmann. This foundation operates the \\"Mariann Steegmann Art & Gender Institute\\" at the University of Bremen as well as the \\"Research Center for Music and Gender\\" at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik, Theater und Medien Hannover. In 2009 Rieger was Corresponding Member of the American Musicological Society. Research Rieger's research focuses on gender issues in musical culture. She wrote a musicological study on the discrimination of women in German musical culture and used her work to advocate for the equality of women at all levels of musical culture.

There are issues around killing and counting unarmed civilians (non-combatants) as enemy combatants, as well as inflating the number of actual enemy who were killed in action (KIA). For search and destroy operations, as the objective was not to hold territory or secure populations, victory was assessed by having a higher enemy body count. Overview Since the goal of the United States in the Vietnam War was not to conquer North Vietnam but rather to ensure the survival of the South Vietnamese government, measuring progress was difficult. All the contested territory was theoretically \\"held\\" already. Instead, the US Army used body counts to show that the US was winning the war. The Army's theory was that eventually, the Viet Cong (VC) and People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) would lose after the attrition warfare. According to historian Christian Appy, \\"search and destroy was the principal tactic; and the enemy body count was the primary measure of progress\\" in General Westmoreland‚Äôs war of attrition. \\"Search and destroy\\" was coined as a phrase in 1965 to describe missions aimed at flushing the VC out of hiding, while the body count was the measuring stick for the success of any operation. Since the early stages of the war did not seek to hold territory, assessments of whether an operation was considered a victory or not was entirely based on having a higher enemy killed ratio for US commanders. Competitions were held between units for the highest number of VC/PAVN killed in action, or KIAs. Army and marine officers knew that promotions were largely based on confirmed kills. The pressure to produce confirmed kills resulted in massive fraud. One study revealed that 61% of American commanders considered that body counts were grossly exaggerated.  Killing and counting of unarmed civilians  It was estimated that around 220,000 civilians killed by US/ARVN operations were miscounted as \\"enemy KIA\\" as when free-fire zones were declared it was erroneously assumed all individuals were enemy combatants. For official US military operations reports, there are no distinctions between enemy KIA and civilian KIA since it was assumed by US forces that all individuals killed in an area declared a free-fire zone, regardless of whether they were combatants or civilians, were considered enemy KIA. Since body counts was a direct measure of operational success, this often caused US battle reports to list civilians killed as enemy KIA. The inclusion of civilians killed led to the enormous discrepancy between weapons seized and \\"enemy KIA\\" during Operation Speedy Express, with nearly 10,000 enemy KIA with just 748 weapons found. Most of the those counted as \\"enemy killed\\" were unarmed civilians. The My Lai Massacre and Son Thang massacre both reported women and children killed as \\"enemy combatants\\". Former Marine Officer and later war-time corresponding Philip Caputo in the book A Rumor of War noted: Christian Appy in Working Class War documents widespread atrocities committed by US forces, especially towards the latter \\"withdrawal\\" period. Accidental or deliberate killings through napalming, artillery and others were reported to have frequently either been re-attributed to the PAVN/VC or claimed as \\"VC\\" casualties by US forces. Other reported incidents include ambushing or attacking unarmed groups of men such as fishermen or farmers, which were reported as \\"Viet Cong\\", as well as any civilians wearing black pajamas and civilians running away from helicopters, including women and children who were again reported as \\"enemy combatants\\" KIA. One notable example of this was the purported killing of hundreds of unarmed civilians by Tiger Force following grievous losses from a PAVN ambush, in which the unit proceeded to kill countless women, children and crippled individuals during Operation Wheeler/Wallowa. Journalist Jonathan Schell, who reported on Operation Cedar Falls, observed the general inability of US forces to discern VC from unarmed civilians, based on tacit ignorance of the culture and the murder of civilians on whim or suspicion, for example in which a man riding a bicycle past a patrol near his town was shot and subsequently declared a VC, and the shooting of a woman carrying medical supplies, who was then declared an enemy combatant serving as a medic post-mortem. According to war photographer Tony Swindell, it was standard operating procedures to fire upon civilians fleeing and attribute them as Viet Cong insurgents and he has documented images depicting this. This is in reference to the 11th Infantry Brigade with which he served as a war photographer.  Body count inflation  In the summer of 1970, H. Norman Schwarzkopf writes, \\"the Army War College issued a scathing report\\" that, among other things, \\"criticised the Army's obsession with meaningless statistics and was especially damning on the subject of body counts in Vietnam. A young captain had told the investigators a sickening story: he'd been under so much pressure from headquarters to boost his numbers that he'd nearly gotten into a fistfight with a South Vietnamese officer over whose unit would take credit for various enemy body parts. Many officers admitted they had simply inflated their reports to placate headquarters.\\" The junior officers queried in the 1970 \\"Study on Military Professionalism\\" (seemingly the study that Schwarzkopf refers to) had particularly violent reactions to instructions on the body count. \\"They told of being given quotas and being told to go out and recount until they had sufficient numbers. 'Nobody out there believes the body count,' was the reportedly common response.\\" In Lewis Sorley's book A Better War, published in 1999 after studies of voluminous previously-secret papers of Creighton Abrams, he writes \\"Body count may have been the most corrupt ‚Äì and corrupting ‚Äì measure of progress in the whole mess. Certainly the consensus of senior Army leaders, the generals who commanded in Vietnam, strongly indicates that it was. A survey found that sixty-one percent of officers believed that the body count was often inflated. Typical comments by the respondents were that it was 'a fake ‚Äì totally worthless', that 'the immensity of the false reporting is a blot on the honor of the Army', and that they were grossly exaggerated by many units primarily because of the incredible interest shown by people like McNamara and Westmoreland.\\" Secretary of Defense Charles Hagel states that U.S. commanders on the ground inflated body counts since this was how their success was judged. \\"You used that body count, commanding officers did, as the metric and measurement of how successful you were\\", hence providing a positive incentive for deliberate fabrication. During the Battle of Dak To and the Battle of the Slopes, one company commander alleges after losing 78 men while finding 10 enemy bodies, the \\"enemy body count\\" figures were deliberately re- written as 475 by General William Westmoreland and released as official operational reports. Shelby Stanton stated that accurate assessments of PAVN and VC losses were largely impossible due to lack of corresponding statistics, the fact that allied ground units were often unable to confirm artillery and aerial kills, and gamesmanship practiced by units under pressure to \\"produce results\\". American losses were subject to statistical manipulation as well. For instance, dying soldiers put aboard medical evacuation helicopters were often counted as only wounded in unit after-action tables. Author Mark Woodruff has stated that the Vietnamese government's official estimate (released in April 1995) of 1.1 million PAVN/VC fighters KIA indicates that US body counts had actually underestimated communist losses.  Estimates of total casualties  The official US Department of Defense figure was 950,765 communist forces killed in Vietnam from 1965 to 1974. Defense Department officials believed that these body count figures need to be deflated by 30%. The Ministry of Defense for Vietnam reported 849,000 military dead and missing during the war for the period between 1955 and 1975, of which a third were non-combat deaths. The Vietnamese government does not officially view the First Indochina War as separate from the later phase, and in total estimates 1.1 million casualties from the period of 1945‚Äì1975. More than 300,000‚Äì330,000 PAVN/VC soldiers remain officially missing in action, with some estimates putting the number as high as 500,000. Lewis Sorley in A Better War cites Douglas Pike with a figure of 900,000 PAVN/VC dead by 1973 and states that during a 1974 visit by Admiral Elmo Zumwalt to North Vietnam, PAVN General V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p advised Zumwalt that the North had 330,000 missing. Jim Webb claims that the Vietnamese lost over 1.1 m soldiers. Geoffrey Ward and Ken Burns in the book The Vietnam War state over a million casualties were reported as well.

It was designed by Laird & Buchan and built in 1918 by Frederick Coulson. The property is owned by the New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Willandra Homestead was the residence of the former Willandra Station. Willandra Station had been settled in the 1880s by the partnership of Whittingham and Haynes, and had once consisted of 736,000 acres. Willandra Station was the location of conflict during the 1890s shearing strikes, with Willandra shearers reportedly arming themselves to support the new shearers' union in 1890. Shearing at the station is referenced in the colonial folk song \\"Flash Jack from Gundagai\\". It was subsequently owned by the London Bank of Australia before being sold to pastoral families the Fields and Vickerys in 1912. Under their management, it became one of the largest stud merino stations in Australia, running more than 90,000 sheep. The current homestead was built in 1918. It uses some of the earliest asbestos fibrous cement sheeting manufactured in Australia. The original shearing shed, which had 83 stands, burned down in the twentieth century and was replaced by a much smaller 12 stand shed. The property was sold to the New Zealand Land Company in the 1950s and again to Dalgety & Company in 1960. The Willandra National Park was created in May 1972 covering 13,000 acres of land, but did not initially include the homestead area. In 1974, the lease on the leasehold portion of the former station expired and was not renewed, and Dalgety decided to sell the freehold portion. Boral, whose managing director had been associated with the station, bought a 6,000 acre section including the homestead and shearing precincts for $100,000, donated it to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, and donated $30,000 towards the cost of establishing the park. Following the handover to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the fate of the homestead was initially unclear, and in 1977 it was described as \\"unoccupied and in bad repair\\" with no decision made about its future. It underwent stabilisation works in the 1970s and 1980s, before the homestead and shearing precincts were fully restored between 1996 and 2001. The homestead complex now serves as tourist accommodation, available in the homestead itself, cottage and men's quarters. Description The homestead buildings survive in what is now the Willandra National Park. The 26-room weatherboard main homestead, dating from 1918, is laid out in a U-shape around a central courtyard, surrounded by verandahs. The homestead complex also includes a number of surviving outbuildings, including jackaroos quarters (1918), ram shed (1933) and cottages (1940s). The shearing precinct includes the shearers' quarters, cook house and overseers' cottage, all dating from 1936, and the rebuilt shearing shed, dating from 1960. The main house is now used as upmarket accommodation, with less expensive accommodation also available on site. The overseers' cottage, sections of the jackaroo's quarters, workshop, stables and garage are used for staff and management purposes.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries The homestead is of state significance as a rare, intact and confident example of domestic rural architecture influenced by international trends in modern architectural design and aesthetics. The residence was designed by Laird and Buchan a well known and successful Victorian architectural firm. It is a modernist interpretation of a rural homestead form completely built with the most modern materials and restrained use of architectural decorations in vogue at the time. The building demonstrates the aspirations of the Willandra Pastoral Co., and their optimism for the future of the property buoyed by the end of World War One. The homestead is the centre piece of the homestead precinct situated in a formally landscaped context, complete with associational outbuildings, utilitarian and pleasure gardens and recreational facilities.

It currently houses various entities of importance to the university institution as a whole, such as: the Museum of Art, the Museum of Archeology and Anthropology, the University Theater of San Marcos (TUSM), the Espa√±a de las Artes Library and the directions of Ballet, Folklore, Music, Film and Television, Band and Orchestra, and Tourism. The set of the \\"Casona de la Universidad de San Marcos\\" -which includes the famous \\"University Park\\" on its outside-, of undeniable historical and cultural importance for the city, it is part of the area and of the list of buildings of the historic center of Lima that were recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, in 1988. Plan of La Casona de San Marcos La Casona de San Marcos is one of the most important buildings of Lima, both from the historical and architectural point of view. Located in the old building of the Noviciado de San Antonio Abad and of the Real Convictorio de San Carlos, and popularly known under the name of Casona de San Marcos, it is the oldest of the seats currently occupied by the University and one of the most important non-religious historical buildings in the city of Lima. Founded as a Jesuit novitiate, it became the university's headquarters between 1875 and 1966, when most of its administrative offices were moved to the campus of the University City. The Casona de San Marcos is the main reference of the cultural and artistic activity of the university, and one of the best preserved constructions of the colonial era in Lima. Panoramic view of the Cultural Center of the University of San Marcos. To the left is the University Park, the Torre Alemana, and monuments to university illustrious graduates; to the right the large colonial set of La Casona de San Marcos and the Pante√≥n de los Pr√≥ceres.  History of the building  La Casona de San Marcos and its chapel in 1925. Jurisprudence and Law alumni of 1896 at a courtyard of La Casona The history of the Casona begins the year 1605, when Antonio Correa Ure√±a gives the Jesuits an important donation for the construction of their novitiate, built to educate and train the new members of the Society of Jesus. At this time, the dimensions of the novitiate that was called that of San Antonio Abad, was five or even six times larger than the current size of La Casona. After being partially destructed by the earthquake of 1746 the Jesuits rebuilt it again, with a new design, completing the current building. In 1767 three years after the expulsion of the Jesuit order, Viceroy of Peru Manuel d'Amat i de Junyent founded the Real Convictorio de San Carlos, a type of university, in the former ecclesiastical building, in honor to the Bourbon King Charles III of Spain. This college reached great apogee from the end-18th century until 19th century. After the proclamation of the independence, in 1821, the college continues its work with an almost complete autonomy with respect to the University of San Marcos, until in 1867 it decrees the inclusion of the college of San Carlos and of the Independencia (San Fernando) into it. Since the transfer of the university, La Casona remained a place of great historical value and importance not only for the university but for the city of Lima. Since the Casona suffered a damage caused by the earthquake of 1966, the university was transferred to the new University City, its current main headquarters. So the set of La Casona were enabled to lodge the institutions of cultural extension of the university. In 1989, the National University of San Marcos, the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation and the National Institute of Culture signed a cooperation agreement Peru-Spain to restore the architectural set and to be dedicated to culture, research and artistic creations. The works were carried out with the economic and technical support of the Spanish Cooperation. At present, the Casona houses the San Marcos Cultural Center, which offers cultural extension courses, exhibitions and is home to several university museums and research centers. Inside La Casona highlights the Hall of Degrees (old Chapel of Loreto), where the official ceremonies of the doctorates \\"honoris cause\\" that the university grants are realized; the General Hall and the courts of Law, that of Letters, that of Sciences, that of the Jasmines and that of Boys. Also currently houses the Museum of Art of the University of San Marcos. Description Halls =Chapel of Nuestra Se√±ora de Loreto= The 18th-century paintings in the ceiling of the chapel The Chapel of Nuestra Se√±ora de Loreto, also called Hall of Degrees of Literature, is located between the courtyards of Literature and Jasmines. This is one of the most beautiful environments that has the old Casona de San Marcos. Its vault has thirteen beautiful paintings from the mid-18th century, inspired by saints and doctors of the Church like St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas and others. =General Hall= In front of the Courtyard of the Jasmines is the Sal√≥n General (General Hall), formed by courtroom, stands and wooden galleries, dating from the late-18th century.

On 21 August 1989, Deane Wade Fuller-Sandys, a 21-year-old Auckland tyre-fitter, left home to go fishing. He never returned. His body was never found and authorities initially believed he probably drowned after being swept out to sea at West Auckland's Whatipu Beach, where his car was discovered shortly afterwards. Five days later, on 26 August 1989, Leah Romany Stephens, a 20-year old Auckland sex worker, also disappeared. Her skeletal remains were discovered in a forest near the Muriwai Golf Course three years later, in June 1992. Police enquiries at the time did not lead to an arrest in her case either. It was not until police received a tip-off years later that the two deaths were related that Fuller-Sandys' disappearance was upgraded to a murder inquiry. After a two-year investigation, another sex worker, Gail Maney, was convicted of commissioning Stephen Stone, a gang member, to kill Fuller-Sandys over what was portrayed as a drug-related dispute. The murders allegedly took place in Larnoch Road in the suburb of Henderson where Maney used to live. Stone was also convicted of the rape and murder of Leah Stephens, a witness to the killing of Fuller-Sandys. Two other men were also convicted of being accessories to the murder of Fuller-Sandys by disposing of his body. The case is unusual in New Zealand legal history because of the decade-long gap between the crime and the conviction, the securing of a conviction despite a lack of forensic evidence, and the legal immunity granted to key witnesses. The case is also contentious as Maney continues to state she is innocent and that she never even met Fuller-Sandys, and because two key witnesses who testified at the trial have since recanted their original trial testimony.Gone Fishing: Second witness admits 'lying' in Gail Maney's trial, Stuff 1 July 2019 Police investigation In early 1997, Auckland police began to receive information that the disappearances of Deane Fuller-Sandys and Leah Stephens were connected ‚Äì through their association with Gail Denise Maney. Maney (born 1967) was a sex worker and said to be in a relationship with Stephen Ralph Stone (born 1969), who had gang affiliations. She lived in a rental at 22 Larnoch Road, Henderson. Fuller-Sandys sometimes attended parties there and allegedly sold drugs to Gail Maney. In August 1989, when Maney and the other occupants were out, the place was burgled. Leather goods, money, and drugs were stolen. Based on a description of the burglar provided by a neighbour, police allege Maney believed it was Fuller-Sandys. Police concluded that in August 1989, Gail Maney had ordered the killing of Deane Fuller-Sandys because she believed he had stolen drugs from her. Police were told that Fuller-Sandys was enticed to come to Larnoch Rd on 21 August 1989 on his way to go fishing. When he arrived, he was attacked by Stone who then shot him in front of at least eight witnesses, among whom was Leah Stephens. Stone passed the gun to each of the four male witnesses, including Maney's younger brother Colin Neil Maney (born 1971) and a mutual acquaintance, Mark William Henriksen (born 1967), and directed them to fire bullets into the body to make them complicit in the murder. The men allegedly disposed of Fuller- Sandys' body in Woodhill Forest (although subsequent police searches failed to discover his remains), and left his vehicle at Whatipu Beach to make it appear he had drowned there. Five days later, Stone, believing that Leah Stephens was likely to inform police of the murder of Fuller-Sandys, raped and then murdered her with a knife at 22 Larnoch Road. During the course of the investigation, the lead detective on the case, Mark Franklin, was discovered by other police officers sharing a joint in downtown Auckland. The incident could have ended Franklin's career, but he spoke to his supervisor about it before the other officers reported him and he was let off with a warning.Cop used dope for stress, Stuff 22 September 2013 The investigation continued for two years, after which Maney and Stone were arrested and charged with murdering Fuller-Sandys at Maney's home in Larnoch Road. Stone was also charged with the rape and murder of Stephens. Colin Maney and Mark Henriksen were charged with being accessories to the murder of Fuller-Sandys. All four denied the charges. Trial The trial was held in March 1999 at Auckland's High Court. The Crown was unable to produce a body or any forensic evidence such as DNA, blood-matches or weapons. Their case was based entirely on the testimony from witnesses who were interviewed eight or more years after Fuller-Sandys and Stephens disappeared.Gone Fishing: Top lawyers to represent Gail Maney, RNZ, 12 August 2018 Two males who were alleged to be present (and participated in shooting Fuller-Sandys), and who admitted they had also disposed of Stephens' body at Muriwai, were granted name suppression and immunity from prosecution in exchange for their trial testimony. During the trial, lead investigator Mark Franklin was strongly challenged by defence lawyers over whether he had bullied witnesses, or pressured them to change their stories to match a predetermined police narrative. He denied these allegations. However, private investigator Tim McKinnel subsequently said: \\"There are concerns around some of the witnesses and their credibility and reliability. There are a number of wavering versions of events before a final version of events is settled on and we've seen that in cases before ‚Ä¶ Those sorts of things are concerning and I have questions around the way those statements and that evidence was collected over a period of time.\\"  Verdicts  After two days' deliberation, the jury found Stone and Gail Maney guilty of the murder of Fuller-Sandys. Stone was also found guilty of the rape and murder of Stephens. Both were sentenced to life imprisonment. Stone also received a 10-year concurrent sentence for raping Stephens. Colin Maney and Mark Henriksen were convicted of being accessories to the murder of Fuller- Sandys by helping to dispose of his body. Henriksen was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, while Colin Maney (the youngest of the accused) received a two-year suspended sentence. Subsequent events  Appeals  Gail Maney and Mark Henriksen appealed their convictions and were granted a retrial on the grounds that the original trial judge had not adequately summed up the case for their defence to the jury. However, both were again found guilty at their retrial in June 2000. In 2005, Gail Maney filed another appeal after one of the key female witnesses recanted her original trial testimony implicating Maney, but this appeal was also rejected.  Parole  Maney was paroled in 2010, but was twice recalled to prison for breaches of her parole conditions. She served a total of 15 years in prison and remains on parole for the rest of her life. Three top lawyers, criminal barrister Julie-Anne Kincade, Nicholas Chisnall, and Aieyah Shendi, have agreed to represent her as she continues fighting to clear her name for a murder she says she did not commit. Private investigator Tim McKinnel has also agreed to assist.Gone Fishing: Top lawyers to represent Gail Maney, Stuff, 12 August 2018 Although Stephen Stone admitted to the killing of Fuller-Sandys during a restorative justice meeting with Fuller-Sandys' family in 2010, he subsequently recanted this confession and reverted to his claims of innocence. Stone was declined parole in December 2017, and will not be eligible for parole again until November 2019.  Media interest  In 2018, Radio New Zealand and Stuff released a podcast documentary about the case, Gone Fishing. Subjects interviewed included Gail Maney, some of the key witnesses, and the former detective who led the police investigation, Mark Franklin. Franklin's reputation had been damaged after he was jailed for twelve months in the Cook Islands for selling cannabis to an undercover police officer there in 2010.  Concerns about the case   Lack of forensic evidence  Fuller-Sandys' body has never been found. Despite a two-year investigation (eight years after Fuller-Sandys' disappearance), the Crown was unable to produce any forensic evidence such as DNA, blood-matches or weapons.Private investigator to look at the case of Gail Maney, Stuff 27 June 2018 Lead investigator, detective senior sergeant Mark Franklin (who was subsequently convicted for drug dealing),Former NZ policeman jailed, Cook Island News, 29 August 2013 said \\"This was a case where there's no forensics; we didn't have scenes, we didn't have bodies, and [for] the evidence we relied totally on criminal associates who were involved in the crimes. That was probably one of the most challenging things.\\" According to Tim McKinnel, who had worked to overturn the wrongful conviction of Teina Pora: \\"There is not a scrap of physical evidence to support the contention that Fuller-Sandys was murdered...\\"  Participants granted immunity  One of the men who were present when Fuller-Sandys was killed (and has permanent name suppression) admitted to being among the eight people in the garage in Larnoch Road where Fuller-Sandys is said to have been shot. He and another witness supposedly helped bury Fuller-Sandys' body in dense bush somewhere in West Auckland. This man was also present when Leah Stephens was raped and murdered. When the case was brought to light again in the late 90s, he gave evidence against Maney and Stone in return for immunity from prosecution. He was also given $30,000 and a new identity under the witness protection scheme.Gone Fishing: Witness says he used a hypnotist to try to find victim's body, 26 June 2018 Doubts about the reliability of his evidence were raised after he appeared to have no knowledge of the crimes despite repeated questioning by police during the investigation. However, at one point during the investigation, he spent half an hour alone with Franklin, one of the lead detectives on the case. Immediately afterwards, he revised his statement to say he remembered both crimes ‚Äì which helped the police tie the two cases together. Speaking to Stuff for the podcast Gone FishingGone Fishing 27 years later, he said: \\"I had no knowledge of the events\\" claiming he only remembered what happened after he went to a hypnotist.  Two 'witnesses' retract  Two people who testified that they were present when Fuller-Sandys was killed have subsequently retracted their statements. In February 2005 at a Court of Appeal hearing, Tania Wilson said she gave false evidence at Maney's two trials which implicated Maney in the killing of Fuller-Sandys. She said the police put her under pressure to testify against Maney. The court did not accept Wilson's recantation and dismissed Maney's appeal. In July 2019, a second woman who gave evidence in the trial that convicted Gail Maney said she lied to police that she was present after being \\"threatened and harassed\\" by police. She said the police never interviewed her until 1997, eight years after Fuller-Sandys went missing, and that police pressured her by coming to her house in \\"marked and unmarked cars, sometimes in large numbers. They would search my house, (and) told me that they were going to make my life a misery if I didn't start playing ball, which meant admitting to my so-called role in his murder.\\" She said she gave a false statement after police threatened to take away her young child but added: \\"My view was that he wasn't murdered and he was washed off the rocks fishing.\\" The second woman's story has been corroborated by Andrew Thompson, a former Henderson Police officer, who picked up the witness after she was interviewed by detectives investigating the death of Deane Fuller-Sandys and drove her to the airport. Thompson said she told him during the drive that she and the other woman had lied to detectives about being present when the alleged murder took place. Tim McKinnel who has been looking into the case told The New Zealand Herald he believed Thompson's account because it was consistent with other information he has.Ex-police officer backs up fresh claims by witness they lied in Gail Maney's trial, NZ Herald 7 July 2019  Detective convicted of drug dealing  Detective senior sergeant Mark Franklin smoked cannabis during his time as a police officer, including while working on this particular case. He took early retirement on psychological grounds and was subsequently sent to prison in the Cook Islands for drug dealing. His lawyer told the court that Franklin had been a long-time user of cannabis, and smoked it to deal with job-related stress.

An adaptation of the fantasy-BL web novel of the same name by Priest, the series was released on the video platform Youku between June 13 and July 25, 2018. The series follows Zhao Yunlan (Bai) and Shen Wei (Zhu), a detective and a professor who investigate supernatural phenomena. Though the novel depicts their relationship as romantic in nature, the web series depicts the relationship as a platonic friendship with homoerotic subtext in response to Chinese laws prohibiting depictions of same-sex relationships on television. The series was widely popular on the web, and received a total of 1.8 billion views by August 2018. That same month, Guardian was pulled from Youku amid a crackdown on \\"harmful and vulgar\\" internet content, but was later re-uploaded. Synopsis Guardian is set on the Earth-like planet of Haixing, populated by a native human population and two alien races ‚Äî the Yashou, who are able to shapeshift into plants and animals, and the Dixing, superpowered beings who live deep underground. The three races have enjoyed a peaceful co-existence since the arrival of the Yashou and Dixing over ten thousand years ago, broken only by an ancient war declared by the Dixing after a meteor strike depleted their resources. During that war, the Haixing and Yashou were led by the hero Kunlun, who became a close comrade to the Black Robe Envoy, the leader of a faction within the Dixing that sought peace. The war was won by the Haixing with the use of four holy tools crafted from the meteor. At the end of the war, Kunlun vanished, and the Black Robe Envoy became the overseer of peace between the races while awaiting Kunlun's return. In the present, conflict has begun to erupt again between the Dixing and the surface-dwelling races. The hotheaded Zhao Yunlan leads the Special Investigation Department (SID), a group that works with the Black Robe Envoy to uphold peace and investigate cases related to the Dixing people. While investigating an incident at the local university, Zhao is assisted by Shen Wei, a biological engineering professor. The two men are drawn closer together as a mysterious enemy threatens to re-ignite war. Cast *Bai Yu as Zhao Yunlan / Kunlun :The director and leader of the Special Investigation Department (SID).

It was discovered on 24 August 1987, by American astronomer Stephen Singer-Brewster at the Palomar Observatory in California. The likely spherical X-type asteroid has a rotation period of 3.1 hours. The suspected presence of a kilometer-sized minor-planet moon was announced in November 2000.  Orbit and classification  ' is a Mars-crossing asteroid, a member of the dynamically unstable group, located between the main belt and near- Earth populations, and crossing the orbit of Mars at 1.666 AU. It orbits the Sun inside the innermost region of the asteroid belt at a distance 1.5‚Äì2.9 AU once every 3 years and 3 months (1,199 days; semi-major axis of 2.21 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.31 and an inclination of 27¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery published by the Digitized Sky Survey and taken at Palomar in May 1954, more than 33 years prior to its official discovery observation. It will pass from the main-belt asteroid 7 Iris on 3 September 2173.  Numbering and naming  This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 26 July 2000 (). As of 2018, it has not been named.  Physical characteristics  In the SDSS-based taxonomy and according to the survey conducted by Pan-STARRS, ' is an X-type asteroid. It has also been classified as a common, stony S-type asteroid.  Rotation period  In September 2010, a first rotational lightcurve of ' was obtained from photometric observations by Brian Skiff. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 3.068 hours and a brightness variation of 0.07 magnitude (). Within less than two weeks, follow-up observations by a large international collaboration of astronomers determined a refined period of hours with a low amplitude of 0.07 magnitude, indicating that the body has a spherical shape (). An alternative observation that gave a tentative period 9.709 hours received a poor quality rating ().  Strong binary candidate  The photometric observations during September and October 2010 revealed that ' is a candidate for a synchronous binary asteroid with a minor-planet moon orbiting it every hours at an estimated average distance of . The findings were announced on 6 November 2009. The lightcurve indicated mutual occultation events, however, a conclusive solution for the orbit period was not obtained. The Johnston's archive estimates a diameter of 1.23 kilometer for the satellite, or 31% the size of its primary. The international collaboration included Richard Durkee at the Shed of Science Observatory , Petr Pravec, Kamil Hornoch and Peter Ku≈°nir√°k at Ond≈ôejov Observatory, Donald Pray at Carbuncle Hill Observatory , David Higgins at Canberra , Jozef Vil√°gi and ≈†tefan Gajdo≈° at Modra Observatory, Judit Gy√∂rgyey Ries at McDonald Observatory and Julian Oey at Leura Observatory , as well as astronomers at the Kharkiv Kharkov , Simeiz and Skalnate Pleso observatories.  Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, ' measures 2.95 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.268, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a stony asteroid of 0.20 and derives a diameter of 3.04 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 14.99.

The aim of this association was to organize various activities for Iranian independence from the sovereignty of foreign countries. The members of the association were active in the meetings and demonstrations of the constitutional movement. They also wrote protest letters to the Russian Government about their imperialist actions.Eliz Sanasarian pages. 62-63  History  During the Constitutional Revolution, many secret and semi- congressional associations in Iran were established. Many women's associations were also secretly formed in the constitutional movement. (Later, in the years following the governmental assembly and in World War II, associations were set up that focused on women's rights).ÿ¢ŸÅÿßÿ±€åÿå ⁄òÿßŸÜÿ™. Mokhadarat Vatan Association and similar organizations held massive meetings on the role of women in the 1911 National Movement to banish British Empire and Russia from Iran. They opposed the 1907 treaty, which imposed Iran under the influence of Britain and Russia, incite imports of imported goods, and went to cafes to reduce sugar imports. They even tried to stop them from using foreign sugar, and asked the cafes to shut down in order to reduce consumption. The members of the Mokhadarat Vatan Association considered exploitation of foreign countries as the main cause of the underlying position of women in Iran at that time. Their main goal was not to only emphasize on women's rights, but also dominate Iran's independence from other countries. For example, in one of the meetings between women's associations and the Russian delegation, the panel was trying to persuade women that they should not try to protect the independence of Iran since they did not the Persian Constitution of 1906 of women's rights in Iran. But, the response of the women's groups was that they themselves were dissatisfied with their own circumstances, but the main culprit was the political complexity of the presence of foreign powers. This attitude was later seen in women's political activists of the 1979 Revolution.Eliz Sanasarianÿå Pages. 39-41  Members  At the first meeting, the board of directors of this association was elected: Agha Bigam Najmabadi, daughter of Agha Sheikh Hadi Najmabadi as the chairman, Agha Shahzadeh Amin as the treasurer, and Sediqeh Dowlatabadi as the secretary.Eliz Sanasarianÿå Page. 43 Other prominent members that we can refer to were: Mirza Suleiman Khan Mikdah‚Äôs wife, Dr. Mehdikhan Mikdah‚Äôs mother, spouse of Malik Al-Mutkelimen (Senator Dr. Malikzadeh's mother), Nehzat Jahangir, Efat Al-Muluk Khaje Noori, Nazam Al-Muluk Khaje Noori, Mr. Sayed Kazem Rashti‚Äôs wife, Zinat Aldoleh, Gulshan Al-Muluk Ghahramani, Iran Khanoom (Etela Al-Malek's wife, daughter of MashhƒÅr Al-Saltanah Ghadimi), Mirza Kazem Khoshnevis's wife, Sedigh Al- Saltanah‚Äôs wife, Sardar Afgham‚Äôs daughter, Sepahsalar Tonekaboni‚Äôs daughter, Mofakham Al-Mamalek‚Äôs wife, Mirza Hassan Roshdieh‚Äôs wife (Alavieh khanoom), Notagh Al-Nesvan (Sheikh Al Mamalek Orang‚Äôs sister), Dorat Al Ma'ali (Founder of Dorat School), Homa Mahmoudi, Mahrokh Goharshenas (Sister of the Industrial Director), and Amirsahi Mahsoltan (Women's rights activists).ÿ®ÿßŸÖÿØÿßÿØÿå Pages. 13-22  See also  *Iranian Constitutional Revolution *Women's Freedom Association *Women in Constitutional Revolution *Jam'iyat-e Nesvan-e Vatankhah *Women‚Äôs World (magazine) *Isfahan National Holy Association Notes References * Eliz Sanasarian.

Despite being the second-largest country in Africa, with an approximate area of , and being endowed with rich natural resources, the DRC is the second-poorest country in the world. The average annual income is only $785 US dollars. In 2016, the United Nations (UN) Human Development Index (HDI) ranked the DRC as the 176th least-developed country out of 188 countries with an HDI of 0.435. More than 80% of Congolese people live on less than $1.25 a day, defined as the threshold for extreme poverty. Causes Instability Instability from years of war and political upheaval is one of the most significant causes of poverty in the DRC, while poverty and youth unemployment has ignited conflicts. The DRC is home to raw mineral ores worth an estimated US$24 trillion, which has been the driving force for one of the worlds most devastating conflicts since World War II. The war over raw materials in the Congo kills an estimated 10,000 civilians a month. The precious metals mined in the Congo are used in the manufacturing of smartphones, lightbulbs, computers, and jewelry. The corruption in the mining industry has become a lucrative trade for militia groups who, before 2010, generated yearly revenues estimated around $185 million indirectly from foreign investors. Although the passage of the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act in the US substantially reduced the market for illegal minerals, and the majority of mines are now under civilian control, militia groups continue to fund themselves from gold mining. Foreign companies investing in the armed groups that control mineral resources has resulted in the loss of over $1 billion in tax revenue. In addition, the Congolese government's awarding of mining assets to foreign countries at one-sixth their value have cost the Congolese people about $1.35 billion. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) was very poor before the most recent outbreak of civil war in the 1990s. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the data is sparse, but nevertheless it has concluded that \\"[a]rmed conflicts have caused a deterioration in living standards in most of the provinces\\". Households in war-torn areas spend less money per person for daily expenses than those in peaceful areas, a sign that the war has negatively affected their economic conditions. Disease Disease is another central cause of poverty in the DRC. Major diseases such as cholera, hepatitis A, malaria, polio, measles and typhoid fever continue to run rampant. 1.2% of the Congolese are affected by HIV/AIDS. In the DRC, malaria is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality. The DRC has the second-highest number of reported cases of malaria worldwide. Children are especially susceptible to malaria, and the disease is responsible for the deaths of 19 percent of children under the age of five. Tuberculosis is another leading cause of death. Infectious diseases have reduced the life expectancy of the Congolese to only 48 years, while one in seven children dies before the age of five. Hunger According to the Food Security Portal, nearly 70 percent of the DRC population have little to no access to an adequate food supply contributing to the malnourishment of one out of every four children. Malnutrition in children is especially high in war-torn provinces that rely on the mining industry. The principal contributing factor to food shortages is population displacement. Due to the ongoing violence the United Nations estimates that approximately 2.3 million persons are displaced in the DRC. The conflicts in mining provinces have disrupted harvesting activities resulting in three million people being at risk of starvation. Water Water shortages also play an integral role in severe food shortages. The lack of infrastructure in rural areas, as well as the collapse of infrastructure due to fighting, have left the majority of the Congolese without access to clean water sources. The DRC holds over half of the water reserves in Africa, and yet, in 2011, three-quarters of the population had no access to safe drinking water.

He was one of the most important architects of the Catholic Modernist movement in the United Kingdom. Personal life Goalen was born in 1918 and attended Douai School. He studied at the University of Liverpool's School of Architecture, and produced a final year thesis project on a modern pilgrimage church. Goalen has one son, John MARTIN Goalen (born 1946), who is also an architect. Church architecture Goalen explained how he began building churches. While working as Senior Architect for Harlow New Town Development Corporation, he was recommended for the task of building a new Catholic Church to the parish priest Francis Burgess by the architect-planner Frederick Gibberd. Both the Catholic Church and the town's planners wanted to create a landmark building, and Gibberd believed that Goalen's previous experience in the town would help him create a building that fitted with the overall aims of the redevelopment . This led to his first church commission ‚Äì Our Lady of Fatima, Harlow, which led to Goalen being able to set up in private practice and build and reorder more churches. Goalen is seen as an influential Modernist and four of his churches are now listed: * Our Lady of Fatima, Harlow (Grade II listed, 1958) * Church of Good Shepherd, Nottingham (Grade II* listed, 1962) * The Church of St Gregory the Great, South Ruislip (Grade II listed, 1965) * St Thomas More, Maresfield Gardens (Grade II listed, 1968) Our Lady of Fatima Our Lady of Fatima, Catholic Church, 1960 Our Lady of Fatima, Harlow, is a Grade II listed Roman Catholic Church designed by Gerard Goalen in 1953-4. The brief was for a church that could hold 500 parishioners, set as close as possible to a free-standing altar. The sanctuary was to be generously sized. Goalen was recommended for the job by his boss at Harlow New Town Development, Frederick Gibberd. Building started in 1958 and was completed in 1960. The church is built in reinforced concrete and Surrey stock bricks. The roof is clad in copper, with concrete and asphalt for the aisles. The 84-foot central spire is made of plywood sheathed in copper. Goalen also designed the tabernacle and high altar candlesticks and cross. A model of the church was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1956 and the church was extremely influential. Proctor and Gillick argued that the liturgical movement was a significant influence in this church and that was also closely related to the egalitarian social aims of post-war modern urban planning in Harlow. The church cost ¬£60,000 to build, and the Catholic Review noted it owed much \\"to the generosity of Fr. Burgess's parents\\". It was one of the first post-war churches to break away from the traditional longitudinal plan, being T-shaped, with the sanctuary at the central crossing. The church's reinforced concrete frame allows for large areas of dalle de verre by Dom Charles Norris, an early use of this medium. The church was extremely influential, with Andrew Derrick crediting it with influencing Frederick Gibberd's winning entry for Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral. The building was not without its critics. The architect Robert Maguire, writing in the Ecclesiology Today (Issue 27, January 2002) commented: \\"Gerard Goalen's 'T'-shaped church of Our Lady of Fatima at Harlow, resplendent with its Buckfast Abbey glass. My only serious criticism of this ‚Äì and it is serious ‚Äì is that God's Holy People are divided, like All Gaul, into three parts.\\" It closed in 2001‚Äì2005 in order for ¬£500,000 of repairs to be made to the glass in its walls. In December 2017 it was reported in the local press that the church had to be closed while repairs were made to the spire. It had previously had to close for work to be carried out on its concrete infrastructure. Church of Good Shepherd, Nottingham Church of The Good Shepherd, Nottingham, 1964 The Church of the Good Shepherd, Nottingham is a Roman Catholic church located on Thackerays Lane in Woodthorpe, a suburban area of Arnold, Nottingham. It is a Grade II* listed building. The church was opened on 23 July 1964 and celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2014. Goalen designed it in a modern style and won an award from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1966.A history of everyday things in England. Vol. 5 p. 29. Marjorie Quennell, Charles Henry Bourne Quennell, S. E. Ellacott. 1965 The dalle de verre stained glass is by Patrick Reyntiens, who Goalen had previously worked with at Our Lady of Fatima, Harlow. In 2012, the church was awarded ¬£119,000 by English Heritage to resolve issues with concrete fatigue and reinforcement decay, which was eroding the fabric of the building. St Gregory the Great The Grade II listed Roman Catholic Church of St Gregory the Great, South Ruislip, London was designed by Goalen in 1965. A model of the scheme was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1965. The church is little altered since it was first built and retains its principal fixtures, fittings and finishes. It features a forward sanctuary contained within an elongated oval plan. The church is built using a concrete frame construction, and is faced with brown brick. The roof is not visible. There is some high-quality stained and dalle de verre glass. The porch is spanned by a sculptural panel in bronze. Paraphrasing Goalen's talk to parishioners on the completion of the church, Robert Proctor, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Architecture & Civil Engineering Centre for Advanced Studies in Architecture (CASA), University of Bath states: \\"He [Goalen] explained that two principles of modern architecture had informed his work: the design of spaces according to function and the ‚Äòhonest employment of modern methods of building\\". The building contains work by Patrick Reyntiens, Steven Sykes, Dom Charles Norris and Willi Soukop. Proctor notes: \\"Martin Goalen told me that his father found [the parish priest] Dayer the perfect client and that he regarded this church as his best church and I would not disagree\\". St Gabriel, Islington St Gabriel's, Islington, 1966 St Gabriel, Islington was designed in 1966 by Gerard Goalen to seat 500‚Äì600. It is built from dark grey brick, with a concrete and aluminium roof. The walls were designed to be windowless to shut out road traffic noise. Goalen also built the adjoining two-storey presbytery and a two-storey community centre. Around 1981, Gerard Goalen & Partner converted the baptistery into a meeting room (now the sacristy). The church was later reordered by Carmel Cauchi, who altered the sanctuary steps, plastered the walls (which were originally exposed brick), enclosed the deep coffers of the ceiling, and provided new sanctuary furnishings. At some point the original configuration of the crying chapel, and the organ and choir which used to flank the sanctuary was altered. St Mary the Immaculate, Grantham St Mary the Immaculate, Grantham A Roman Catholic church in Grantham, Lincolnshire that was built in 1832 by E.K Wilson and substantially rebuilt by Goalen in 1964-5. Goalen removed the north wall and extended in that direction. The old sanctuary became the baptistery and the entrance was moved to its present position. A ‚Äòcrying‚Äô corridor was introduced on the south side of the church. St Ann's Nottingham, Our Lady and St Edward In 1966 Goalen completed the sanctuary, which was built as part of the contract for the new friary buildings. The single storey friary buildings are of pale brick with a shallow pitched felt-covered roofs, arranged around a central cloister that contains a small rectangular pond. St Joseph, Retford St Joseph's Retford, Nottinghamshire was designed by E Bower Norris in modern Romanesque design, incorporating Art Deco elements. It opened in 1959 and in 1968 was re- ordered by Goalen to comply with the recommendations of Vatican II. During the re-order, Goalen commissioned a large Christus Resurrexit for the sanctuary wall by Steven Sykes, with whom he had collaborated previously. St Thomas More, Maresfield Gardens Roman Catholic Church of St Thomas More, London, 1968 The Roman Catholic Church of St Thomas More is in Maresfield Gardens, Swiss Cottage, London. The building was designed in 1968 to replace an existing 1938 building which had been the studio of society portrait painter Philip de L√°szl√≥ (1869‚Äì1937). The current building is built in dark brown brick with exposed concrete-framed clerestory and roof structure. It also uses Portland stone, Tinos marble, Travertine fixtures and fittings. The building was designed to maximise accommodation on a restricted site and to comply with the liturgical developments of the Second Vatican Council. The building has seating for 700 people, whilst ensuring that no-one is more than 40 feet from the altar. The consultant engineers were Ove Arup and Partners, and the contractors were John Murphy and Sons. (information from the Solemn Opening and Blessing booklet, 1969) St Thomas More continues to develop ideas from Goalen's earlier buildings such as the church of Our Lady of Fatima, Harlow, Essex (1958, listed Grade II), the Church of the Good Shepherd, Woodthorpe, Nottinghamshire (1962, listed Grade II*), and the Church of St Gregory the Great, South Ruislip (1965, listed Grade II). Goalen's design survives relatively intact, with only minor changes in layout. It contains abstract stained glass by Whitefriars Studios and a statue of St Anthony by renowned ecclesiastical sculptor David John. Inside view of St Thomas More St James, Harlow 1969 Our Lady and St Christopher, Cranford A 1970 design by Goalen that combines worship and social spaces within a single light grey brick building. The buildings lie within the Cranford Village Conservation Area. Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church The Church of Our Lady and the English Martyrs is an English Roman Catholic parish church located at the junction of Hills Road and Lensfield Road in south east Cambridge. It is a large Gothic Revival church built between 1885 and 1890. The church is a Grade II* listed building. To bring the sanctuary in line with the liturgical directives resulting from the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965), its design and re-ordering was undertaken by Goalen. On 7 April 1973, Charles Grant, the Bishop of Northampton, consecrated the present central altar. The original high altar has subsequently been used mainly for reservation of the Blessed Sacrament. Holy Trinity with St Augustin, Leytonstone A regeneration programme in the borough meant the demolition of the two Anglican churches in Leytonstone, the sale of the sites being used to fund the construction of a new church, the Holy Trinity with St Augustin (1973). The new church was designed to fit in with the regenerated Cathall Estate and is known locally as ‚Äòthe cube‚Äô. St Francis of Assisi, Stratford In around 1978 the sacristy of St Francis of Assisi, Stratford was adapted under the direction of Gerald Goalen & Partner. The altar was made moveable to allow the room to be used for meetings; a bronze and resin crucifix by David John was suspended over its normal position. Other furnishings in the chapel, including stained glass clerestory windows, were designed by the architects. Other buildings University Chaplaincy Centre, Cambridge 1976 Parish hall, adjoining St Joseph and the English Martyrs, Bishop's Stortford In 1965 Goalen designed a new parish hall for land to the rear of St Joseph and the English Martyrs, Bishop's Stortford. This was extended by the addition of a clubroom in 1972. Publications * A Golden Decade, Gerard Goalen, 12 September 1969.

Overview The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) has $4 billion in funds available for construction planned to begin in 2022. The plan included in the Measure M transportation funding measure is to build improvements in two stages. In June 2017, Metro issued a Request for Proposals to study alternatives for this new LA Metro Rail route. Metro has narrowed the options to two alternatives and are currently preparing to publish the Draft EIS/EIR for public comment. The draft EIS/EIR is planned to be released in 2020. The project's timeline is expected to be accelerated under the Twenty-eight by '28 initiative. Proposed routings and modes The West Santa Ana Branch Transit Corridor project is proposed as a light rail transit line that would connect downtown Los Angeles to Artesia. Along the route, it would also serve the communities of Vernon, Huntington Park, Bell, Cudahy, South Gate, Downey, Paramount, Bellflower, and Cerritos in the southeast area of the county. The southern portion route, east and south of Slauson, leaves the A Line corridor via the former Pacific Electric Whittier line, continues south on a former BNSF rail line (Florence/Salt Lake to Paramount/Rosecrans), and then transitions to the old Santa Ana right of way (south of Paramount/Rosecrans). These corridors are owned by Ports of Los Angeles/Long Beach and Metro, requiring minimal property acquisition. The northern alignment through Downtown Los Angeles is being studied as possible underground light rail transit route. Six options were proposed. , two options were being considered (both of which would connect to the southern alignment by paralleling the A Line between Washington and Slauson stations, and part of an existing freight rail line along Randolph Street): *Alameda Street (Alternative E): A subway under Alameda, passing through the Arts District and connecting to the L Line at Little Tokyo before continuing on to Los Angeles Union Station. *Downtown Transit Core (Alternative G): Would deviate westward from the Alameda route in the Arts District and continue downtown via a subway, terminating at either 7th Street/Metro Center or Pershing Square. {  - !

In 2019, Metro announced that as part of its design analysis, it would study opening the line in two stages, with the initial opening $1 Billion dollar segment running from Pioneer Station in Artesia north to Slauson Station on the Blue Line, with the remainder of the $3 billion route into downtown built as phase two. Metro staff were \\"optimistic\\" that it would be feasible to build the line to Slauson by 2028 with existing Measure M funds. Metro was also studying public-private partnerships that could accelerate the construction schedule of the entire line. The service is not planned to interline with the A Line to 7th Street/Metro Center due to operational constraints. Under the proposed plans, design for the initial segment would be complete by 2021 and construction would begin in 2022.https://thesource.metro.net/2019/09/18/metro-staff- studies-building-initial-operating-segments-on-west-santa-ana-branch-project/ Extension into Orange County Metro is evaluating an optional station in Cerritos at Bloomfield Avenue (just north of the Los Angeles-Orange county line) to facilitate a possible future extension into Orange County; it would eventually connect to the under construction OC Streetcar, which also uses part of the Pacific Electric WSAB right-of-way.

It was a very significant decade in the history of Bangladesh, because this is the decade in which Bangladesh emerged as a sovereign state. The decade began with a devastating cyclone that ravaged the southern part of the country. The next year the country went into Liberation war and achieved independence from Pakistan. The government of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman administered the newly formed country between 1972‚Äì1975, but their rule soon came to an end through a series of coups and counter coups in the later part of the decade. Economically the country struggled because of the war (1971) and famine (1974) throughout the decade and was highly dependent on foreign aids. Culturally, in this decade Bangladesh started to establish its own identity as an independent nation. Politics and National Life Tension between the two factions of Pakistan The 1970s started with Bangladesh as part of erstwhile Pakistan amid intense political tension between the two factions of the country - East (later Bangladesh) and the West (later Pakistan). The East Pakistanis observed that the West Pakistani establishment would swiftly depose any East Pakistanis elected Prime Minister of Pakistan, such as Khawaja Nazimuddin, Mohammad Ali Bogra, or Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy. Their suspicions were further aggravated by the military dictatorships of Ayub Khan (27 October 1958 ‚Äì 25 March 1969) and Yahya Khan (25 March 1969 ‚Äì 20 December 1971), both West Pakistanis. The situation reached a climax in 1970, when the Bangladesh Awami League, the largest East Pakistani political party, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, won a landslide victory in the national elections. The party won 167 of the 169 seats allotted to East Pakistan, and thus a majority of the 313 seats in the National Assembly. This gave the Awami League the constitutional right to form a government. However, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (a former Foreign Minister), the leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party, refused to allow Rahman to become the Prime Minister of Pakistan. Instead, he proposed the idea of having two Prime Ministers, one for each wing. The proposal elicited outrage in the east wing, already chafing under the other constitutional innovation, the \\"One Unit scheme\\". Bhutto also refused to accept Rahman's Six Points. On 3 March 1971, the two leaders of the two wings along with the President General Yahya Khan met in Dacca to decide the fate of the country. After their discussions yielded no satisfactory results, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman called for a nationwide strike. Bhutto feared a civil war, therefore, he sent his trusted companion, Mubashir Hassan. A message was conveyed, and Rahman decided to meet Bhutto. Upon his arrival, Rahman met with Bhutto and both agreed to form a coalition government with Rahman as Premier and Bhutto as President. However, the military was unaware of these developments, and Bhutto increased his pressure on Rahman to reach a decision. The talks proved unsuccessful, however, and on 1 March 1971, Pakistani President Yahya Khan indefinitely postponed the pending National Assembly session, precipitating massive civil disobedience in East Pakistan. On 2 March 1971, a group of students, led by A S M Abdur Rob, a student leader, raised the new (proposed) flag of Bangladesh under the direction of the Swadhin Bangla Nucleus. They demanded that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declare the independence of Bangladesh immediately but Mujibur Rahman refused to agree to this demand. Rather, he decided that he would declare his next steps at a public meeting to be held on 7 March. On 3 March, student leader, Shahjahan Siraj, read the 'Sadhinotar Ishtehar' (Declaration of independence) at Paltan Maidan in front of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib at a public gathering under the direction of the Swadhin Bangla Nucleus. On 7 March, there was a public gathering in Suhrawardy Udyan to hear updates on the ongoing movement from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib, the leader of the movement that time. Although he avoided directly referring to independence, as the talks were still underway, he warned his listeners to prepare for any imminent war. The speech is considered a key moment in the war of liberation, and is remembered for the phrase, :::\\"Ebarer Shongram Amader Muktir Shongram, Ebarer Shongram Shadhinotar Shongram....\\" :::\\"Our struggle this time is a struggle for our freedom, our struggle this time is a struggle for our independence....\\" Bhola cyclone The 1970 Bhola cyclone made landfall on the East Pakistan coastline during the evening of 12 November, around the same time as a local high tide, killing an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 people. Though the exact death toll is not known, it is considered the deadliest tropical cyclone on record. A week after the landfall, President Khan conceded that his government had made \\"slips\\" and \\"mistakes\\" in its handling of the relief efforts due to a lack of understanding of the magnitude of the disaster. A statement released by eleven political leaders in East Pakistan ten days after the cyclone hit charged the government with \\"gross neglect, callous and utter indifference\\". They also accused the president of playing down the magnitude of the problem in news coverage. On 19 November, students held a march in Dacca protesting the slowness of the government's response. Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani addressed a rally of 50,000 people on 24 November, where he accused the president of inefficiency and demanded his resignation. As the conflict between East and West Pakistan developed in March, the Dacca offices of the two government organisations directly involved in relief efforts were closed for at least two weeks, first by a general strike and then by a ban on government work in East Pakistan by the Awami League. With this increase in tension, foreign personnel were evacuated over fears of violence. Relief work continued in the field, but long-term planning was curtailed. This conflict widened into the Bangladesh Liberation War in December and concluded with the creation of Bangladesh. This was one of the first times that a natural event helped trigger a civil war. Formal Declaration of Independence Illustration showing military units and troop movements during the war. In the early hours of 26 March 1971, a military crackdown by the Pakistan army began. The Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was arrested and the political leaders dispersed, mostly fleeing to neighbouring India where they organised a provisional government. Before being arrested by the Pakistani Army, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman passed a hand written note which contained the Bangladeshi Declaration of Independence. This note was widely circulated and transmitted by the then East Pakistan Rifles' wireless transmitter. The world press reports from late March 1971 also make sure that Bangladesh's declaration of independence by Bangabandhu was widely reported throughout the world. Bengali Army officer Major Ziaur Rahman captured the Kalurghat Radio Station in Chittagong and read the declaration of independence of Bangladesh during the evening hours on 27 March. > This is Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra. I, Major Ziaur Rahman, at the direction > of Bangobondhu Mujibur Rahman, hereby declare that the Independent People's > Republic of Bangladesh has been established. At his direction, I have taken > command as the temporary Head of the Republic. In the name of Sheikh Mujibur > Rahman, I call upon all Bengalees to rise against the attack by the West > Pakistani Army. We shall fight to the last to free our motherland. Victory > is, by the Grace of Allah, ours. Joy Bangla. The Provisional Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh was formed on 10 April in Meherpur (later renamed as Mujibnagar, a town adjacent to the Indian border). Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was announced to be the Head of the State. Tajuddin Ahmed became the Prime Minister, Syed Nazrul Islam became the acting President and Khondaker Mostaq Ahmed the Foreign Minister. There the war plan was sketched out with Bangladesh armed forces established and named \\"Muktifoujo\\". Later these forces were named \\"Muktibahini\\" (freedom fighters). M. A. G. Osmani was appointed as the Chief of the Armed Forces. For military purposes, Bangladesh was divided into 11 sectors under 11 sector commanders. In addition to these sectors, later in the war, three special forces were formed: Z Force, S Force and K Force. These three forces' names were derived from the initial letters of the commander's name. The training and most of the arms and ammunitions were arranged by the Meherpur government which was supported by India. As fighting grew between the Pakistan Army and the Bengali Mukti Bahini, an estimated ten million Bengalis, mainly Hindus, sought refuge in the Indian states of Assam, Tripura and West Bengal. The crisis in East Pakistan produced new strains in Pakistan's troubled relations with India. The two nations had fought a war in 1965, mainly in the west, but the pressure of millions of refugees escaping into India in autumn 1971, as well as Pakistani aggression, reignited Indian hostilities with Pakistan. Indian sympathies lay with East Pakistan, and on 3 December 1971, India intervened on the side of the Bangladeshis which led to a short, but violent, two-week war known as the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Pakistani capitulation and aftermath On 16 December 1971, Lt. Gen A. A. K. Niazi, CO of Pakistan Army forces located in East Pakistan signed the Instrument of Surrender and the nation of Bangla Desh (\\"Country of Bengal\\") was finally established the following day. At the time of surrender only a few countries had provided diplomatic recognition to the new nation. Over 90,000 Pakistani troops surrendered to the Indian forces making it the largest surrender since World War II. The new country changed its name to Bangladesh on 11 January 1972 and became a parliamentary democracy under a constitution. Shortly thereafter on 19 March Bangladesh signed a friendship treaty with India. Bangladesh sought admission in the UN with most voting in its favour, but China vetoed this as Pakistan was its key ally.Section 9. Situation in the Indian Subcontinent, 2. Bangladesh's international position ‚Äì Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan To ensure a smooth transition, in 1972 the Simla Agreement was signed between India and Pakistan. The treaty ensured that Pakistan recognised the independence of Bangladesh in exchange for the return of the Pakistani PoWs. India treated all the PoWs in strict accordance with the Geneva Convention, rule 1925. It released more than 93,000 Pakistani PoWs in five months. Furthermore, as a gesture of goodwill, nearly 200 soldiers who were sought for war crimes by Bengalis were also pardoned by India. The accord also gave back more than of land that Indian troops had seized in West Pakistan during the war, though India retained a few strategic areas; most notably Kargil (which would in turn again be the focal point for a war between the two nations in 1999). Sheikh Mujibur Rahman administration Upon his release on 10 January 1972, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman briefly assumed the provisional presidency and later took office as the prime minister, heading all organs of government and decision- making. The politicians elected in 1970 formed the provisional parliament of the new state. The Mukti Bahini and other militias amalgamated to form a new Bangladeshi army to which Indian forces transferred control on 17 March. The government faced serious challenges, which including the rehabilitation of millions of people displaced in 1971, organising the supply of food, health aids and other necessities. The effects of the 1970 cyclone had not worn off, and the state's economy had immensely deteriorated by the conflict. Mujib helped Bangladesh enter into the United Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement. He travelled to the United States, the United Kingdom and other European nations to obtain humanitarian and developmental assistance for the nation. He signed a treaty of friendship with India, which pledged extensive economic and humanitarian assistance and began training Bangladesh's security forces and government personnel. Mujib forged a close friendship with Indira Gandhi, strongly praising India's decision to intercede, and professed admiration and friendship for India. Major efforts were launched to rehabilitate an estimated 10 million refugees. The economy began recovering and a famine was prevented. A constitution was proclaimed in 1973 and elections were held, which resulted in Mujib and his party gaining power with an absolute majority. He further outlined state programmes to expand primary education, sanitation, food, healthcare, water and electric supply across the country. A five-year plan released in 1973 focused state investments into agriculture, rural infrastructure and cottage industries. In 1974, Bangladesh experienced the deadliest famine ever, which killed around 1.5 million Bangladeshi people from hunger. The Bangladesh famine of 1974 is a major source of discontent against Mujib's government. Bangladeshi people feel ashamed, insulted and demoralised as a nation for this famine that was not due to a food crisis. =Left wing insurgency= At the height of Sheikh Mujib's power, left wing insurgents, organised by Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal's armed wing Gonobahini fought against the government of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, to establish a Marxist government. The government responded by forming the Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini which began a campaign of brutal human rights abuses against the general populace, including the force became involved in numerous charges of human rights abuse including political killings, shooting by death squads, and rape. Members of Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini were granted immunity from prosecution and other legal proceedings. =Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League (BAKSAL)= According to Abdur Razzaq, the 1974 famine profoundly affected Mujib's views on governance, while political unrest gave rise to increasing violence. During the famine, 70,000 people were reported as dead (Note: Reports vary). In response, he began increasing his powers. On 25 January 1975 Mujib declared a state of emergency and his political supporters approved a constitutional amendment banning all opposition political parties. Mujib assumed the presidency and was given extraordinary powers. His political supporters amalgamated to form the only legalised political party, the Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League, commonly known by its initials‚ÄîBAKSAL. The party identified itself with the rural masses, farmers and labourers and took control of government machinery. It also launched major socialist programmes. Using government forces and a militia of supporters called the Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini, Mujib clamped down on any opposition to him. The militia known as RakhiBahini and police were accused of torturing suspects and political killings. While retaining support from many segments of the population, Mujib evoked anger amongst veterans of the liberation war for what was seen as a betrayal of the causes of democracy and civil rights. =Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and aftermath= On 15 August 1975, a group of junior army officers invaded the presidential residence with tanks and killed Mujib, his family and personal staff. Only his daughters Sheikh Hasina Wajed and Sheikh Rehana, who were visiting West Germany, escaped. They were banned from returning to Bangladesh. The coup was planned by disgruntled Awami League colleagues and military officers, which included Mujib's colleague and former confidant√© Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad, who became his immediate successor. There was intense speculation in the media accusing the US Central Intelligence Agency of having instigated the plot. Lawrence Lifschultz has alleged that the CIA was involved in the coup and assassination, basing his assumption on the then US ambassador in Dhaka Eugene Booster. Mujib's death plunged the nation into many years of political turmoil. The coup leaders were soon overthrown and a series of counter-coups and political assassinations paralysed the country. Order was largely restored after a coup in 1977 gave control to the army chief Ziaur Rahman. Declaring himself President in 1978, Ziaur Rahman signed the Indemnity Ordinance, giving immunity from prosecution to the men who plottedZiaur Rahman informed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman earlier about coup threat Mujib's assassination and overthrow. Ziaur Rahman administration, 1975‚Äì81 Successive military coups resulted in the emergence of Army Chief of Staff General Ziaur Rahman (\\"Zia\\") as strongman. He pledged the army's support to the civilian government headed by President Chief Justice Sayem. Acting at Zia's behest, Sayem dissolved Parliament, promising fresh elections in 1977, and instituted martial law. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Acting behind the scenes of the Martial Law Administration (MLA), Zia sought to invigorate government policy and administration. While continuing the ban on political parties, he sought to revitalise the demoralised bureaucracy, to begin new economic development programs, and to emphasise family planning. In November 1976, Zia became Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA) and assumed the presidency upon Sayem's retirement five months later, promising national elections in 1978. As President, Zia announced a 19-point program of economic reform and began dismantling the MLA. Keeping his promise to hold elections, Zia won a five- year term in June 1978 elections, with 76% of the vote. In November 1978, his government removed the remaining restrictions on political party activities in time for parliamentary elections in February 1979. These elections, which were contested by more than 30 parties, marked the culmination of Zia's transformation of Bangladesh's Government from the MLA to a democratically elected, constitutional one. The AL and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), founded by Zia, emerged as the two major parties. Administrative Division thumbIn the 1970s, Bangladesh used to be administratively divided into 4 divisions, namely Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi which were further subdivided into a total of 17 districts (See List of districts of Bangladesh). After the independence, President's Order 7 issued in 1972 dissolved all the existing local government bodies and the names of the Union Council and District Council were changed to Union Panchayet and Zila Board, respectively. The Constitution of 1972 included specific provisions relating to the basic structure and functions of local bodies. Article 9 provided for the formation of local bodies at every administrative units to be composed of elected representatives of the areas concerned. In 1976, the Local Government Ordinance (LGO) issued by the government of General Ziaur Rahman made provisions for the formation of three types of rural local government, Union Parishad, Thana Parishad and Zila Parishad. In 1978, Jamalpur was upgraded to a District. Demographics Based on World Development Indicators published by the World Bank the population of Bangladesh grew from 63 million at the beginning of the decade to 79 million by the end. This signifies an annual population growth rate of 2.3%. Population density increased from 487 to 609 per sq. km. The urban population was 7.6% of the total at the beginning, which ended up at 13.7%. Dhaka, the largest city, with a population of 1.4 million, accounted for 27.8% of the total urban population by 1979. United Nations World Population Prospects show that the population growth rate was in increasing trend (from 2.5% per annum to 2.8%), despite reduction in fertility rate (births per woman) from 6.9 to 6.5. Life expectancy at birth increased from 47.5 years to 52.9 years with Child (0-5) mortality reducing from 224 per 1,000 births to 203. Age dependency ratio (% of working-age population) changed from 91.0% to 92.6% by the end of the decade. Climate Compared to prior decade the October and November became warmer by about 0.5 degree Celsius and February and May became cooler by similar magnitude. Thus overall temperature profile became more moderate. Average rainfall decreased for June by about 59mm and increased for September by about 69mm. Average annual rainfall increased by about 74mm. Economy National Income and Balance of Payment Bangladesh GDP was USD 26.4 billion in 1970, which grew to USD 28.4 billion in 1979 (in 2010 constant dollar) signifying a 0.7% annual growth. Agricultural Sector contributed to 54.6% of GDP in the beginning of the decade, which decreased to 52.5% by the end. During the same period contribution from the industrial sector increased from 8.7% to 15.7% and that of the service sector decreased from 36.7% to 31.9%. Per capita GDP decreased from USD 406 to USD 358 (in 2010 constant dollar). According to World Development Indicators published by the World Bank, on 2010 constant dollar basis, Bangladesh used to export USD 0.9 billion (8.3% of GDP) worth of goods and services as of 1970, which grew at annual average rate of 3.3% to USD 1.2 billion (6.1% of GDP) in 1979. In contrast, by 1979 imports stood at USD 3.4 billion (15.8% of GDP). Over the decade, Foreign Direct Investment and Personal Remittances Receipt averaged 0.02% and 0.74% of GDP; while, total Reserve averaged at 13.4% of external debt and 2.4 month's coverage of import. Gross National Income (at 2010 constant dollar) grew from USD 22.3 billion in 1973 to USD 28.4 billion in 1979. At the beginning of this period External Debt stock (of which concessional debt was 71.8%) comprised of 6.1% of Gross National Income (GNI) and External Debt Service burden was 0.1% of GNI. By the end of the decade, External Debt stock (of which concessional debt now was 80.3%) stood at 19.1% of GNI and External Debt Service burden was 1.3% of the same. During the same period Military expenditure increased from 0.6% to 0.9% of GNI. Agriculture During this decade, crop production grew at an annual average rate of 0.9% driven by cereal production increase from 16.9 million metric tons to 19.7 million (implying annual growth of 1.5%) - enabled by improvement in cereal yield from 1666.2 kg per hectare to 1870.9 kg. At the same time, livestock production grew at annual 2.7% and fisheries production decreased at annual 0.6%. Altogether these contributed to overall food production increase by annualized rate of 1.2%. The catastrophic famine of 1974 led to the death of tens of thousands of people due to starvation caused by inadequate food production and the withholding of food shipments by the US government. Industrial and Service Sectors Net value addition from industrial sector, which stood at USD 3.8 billion in 1970 (in 2010 constant USD), grew at average annual rate of 1.1% to USD 4.2 billion by 1979 (in the same constant USD basis). Manufacturing sector contributed 62.1% of industrial value added in the beginning of this period and it gradually changed to 66.1% by the end. By 1979 manufacturers export accounted for 64.5% of total merchandise export while import supporting the manufacturing segment accounted for 55.2% of total merchandise import. In that year, textile and garments accounted for 37.0% of the value addition of the manufacturing sector. In 1973-74 there were 1,427 industrial establishments in the country employing 0.31 million staffs. By 1979-80 the number of establishment grew to 3,006 and employment in the sector grew to 0.42 million. On the other hand, net value addition from the service sector amounting USD 14.2 billion in 1970, also grew at average annual rate of 1.3% and stood at USD 16.1 billion by 1979 (in 2010 constant USD). Some of the major business houses / enterprises that started journey in this decade include the Beximco, City Group, T K Group of Industries and BRAC in 1972, Jamuna Group and Milk Vita in 1974, Concord Group and Otobi in 1975, Meghna Group of Industries in 1976, Nasir Group in 1977, BRAC's business venture Aarong in 1978 and Rangs Group in 1979. In the public sector BTCL was established in 1971 followed by Petrobangla, Bangladesh Shipping Corporation and Biman Bangladesh Airlines in 1972, Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation in 1976 and Bangladesh Machine Tools Factory in 1979. Infrastructure Transportation & Communication Dhaka roads had much fewer traffic in the 1970s. When Bangladesh achieved independence in 1971, it inherited 3,860 km of pucca roads, 2858.73 km of railway tracks and 466 railway stations, but most roads and connecting bridges were in shambles due to the ravage of the war. After the independence war-ravaged roads, culverts and bridges were reconstructed fast and some new bridges on the national highways were built. All the district headquarters were connected with the national highway network. The construction of double line track between Dhaka- Tangi and Chittagong-Mirsharai started in 1960s. These lines were opened in phases during the 1960s and 1970s. At the time of independence, Bangladesh had 5 inland river ports at Dhaka, Narayanganj, Chandpur, Barisal and Khulna. In 1975 a new port was added at Patuakhali. Air Transport also started to develop. As of 1973, there were 13,500 registered carrier departures worldwide which grew to 14,800 by 1979. During the same period number of passenger carried increased from 0.49 million to 0.62 million per annum. A UNDP funded Bangladesh Transportation Sector Study executed by World Bank in 1988 estimated that by 1975 the ground transport system of Bangladesh was already supporting 17 billion km of passenger commute and 2.6 billion km of freight transport. Road network accounted for 54% of the passengers and 35% of the freight whereas 30% of the passengers and 28% of the freight were transported using the rail network. The rest were using inland water transport.World Bank. 1991. Bangladesh - Transport sector review (English). Washington, DC: World Bank. In the beginning of the decade there were 45,000 fixed telephone line subscription in the country - which increased to 89,000 by the end signifying 0.07 lines per 100 people. Energy In 1973 per capital electric power consumption was 15.2 kWh, which increased to 21.0 kWh by 1979. During the same period per capita energy usage increased from 92.5 kg of oil equivalent to 99.4 kg and fossil fuel energy consumption increased from 24.2% to 29.4% of total. In 1973 the electricity produced in the country was coming from hydroelectric sources: 23.6%, natural gas sources: 34.7% and oil sources: 41.7%. By 1979 the same distribution changed to - hydroelectric sources: 24.4%, natural gas sources: 45.6% and oil sources: 29.9%. Financial Services At the time of independence the country inherited a very limited financial set-up consisting of 1130 branches of 12 commercial banks, the Dhaka Stock Exchange, several insurance companies established between 1958 and 1971, and the Samabaya (co-operative) Bank Ltd. Bangladesh Bank, the central bank of the country, was established in Dhaka as a body corporate vide the Bangladesh Bank Order, 1972 (P.O No. 127 of 1972). Bangladesh Bank started operating with all capital and liabilities of the Dhaka branch of State Bank of Pakistan. The 12 banks which were inherited were soon nationalised and merged into six banks, naming them -Sonali, Agrani, Janata, Rupali, Pubali and Uttara. Later IFIC Bank was established as a private bank in 1976. The number of insurance companies that had business in East Pakistan was 75, of which 10 were locally incorporated ones. Following the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, both life and general insurance business in the country was nationalised under the Bangladesh Insurance (Nationalisation) Order 1972 except foreign insurance companies. Five corporations were established to absorb, own and control the businesses of the 75 existing insurance companies and these new corporations were Bangladesh Jatiya Bima Corporation, Karnafuli Bima Corporation, Tista Bima Corporation, Surma Jiban Bima Corporation and Rupsa Jiban Bima Corporation. These four corporations were in business from 1 January 1973 to 14 May 1973. Later they were gradually merged into two entities named Jiban Bima Corporation (for life insurance) and Sadharan Bima Corporation (for general insurance). The activity of Dhaka Stock Exchange remained suspended until 1976, when it renewed operations with nine listed companies having paid up capital of Tk 137.52 million.

He referred to himself at one time as the \\"Stone-age Dick Clark\\".Billboard, Seashore Show Proves Teen TV Dances Alive & Kicking, Gil Faggen, July 13, 1963 Early years He was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey and graduated from Atlantic City High School. He started his career from 1943 to 1946 at WFPG, in Atlantic City. Hurst then did a radio show on WPEN-AM 950, out of Philadelphia, called The 950 Club with Joe Grady from 1946 (until 1955) before he teamed up with Joe Grady to do The Grady and Hurst Show on Philadelphia TV, which was broadcast in the tri-state area. The Grady and Hurst Show, which started in 1952, was the first to show teens dancing (from 11 a.m. to noon every Saturday) in a studio. The groundbreaking format influenced programs like American Bandstand and others. The 950 Club on radio, which preceded The Grady and Hurst Show, was the first teenage show to have a studio audience (by invitation only) dance to the music on the air. Philadelphia TV Hurst was on Philadelphia television from 1952 to 1978. During that time from 1952 to 1955, Hurst produced and performed on three television shows, all airing on WPTZ-TV. They were the aforementioned The Grady and Hurst Show, The Arthur Murray Party, a formal adult dance program, and The Plymouth Showroom, a variety program featuring popular recording artists. All three programs were rated number one in their respective time slots. In 1955, The Grady and Hurst Show moved to WPFH-TV in Wilmington, Delaware, where it enjoyed continued success. In 1958, the station moved to Philadelphia and became WVUE. Radio In 1958, Hurst joined WRCV radio and TV, now known as KYW. He produced and performed on The Grady and Hurst Show morning radio program, as well as working on a TV show called Summertime on the Pier. In 1965, Ed launched yet another show, Ed Hurst at the Aquarama, a local variety series. Hurst returned to WPEN in 1981 and stayed until 2005. His show was called the Steel Pier Radio Show for most of his time at WPEN. Although Hurst then retired, he eventually returned to radio on WIBG-AM 1020, which was followed by WPG, WOND and back to WPG, where he worked until 2016. Honors The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia inducted Hurst into their Hall of Fame in 1996 and had named him Person of the Year in 1990, along with his broadcasting partner, Joe Grady. Grady and Hurst were also inducted into the Philadelphia Music Alliance \\"Walk of Fame\\" in 1993. Personal life Hurst married his onetime producer, Cissie, and had two children: a daughter, Merle, and a son, Brian.

movement of Argentina, which is defined by Peronist, national, popular, and revolutionary ideology. Its name was adopted as a tribute to First Lady Eva Per√≥n. It was created in 2004 and was part of the Front for Victory. Its general secretary is Emilio P√©rsico. Other major figures of the movement are former minister Jorge Taiana, National Deputies Leonardo Grosso (former chairman of the Movement's in the lower house), Silvia Horne, Remo Carlotto, Lucila De Ponti, and Araceli Ferreyra, former senators Juan Manuel Abal Medina Jr. and Teresita Luna, the journalist Fernando \\"Chino\\" Navarro, and Evita-CTEP liaison Esteban Castro. In 2016 the Evita Movement separated from the parliamentary bloc of the Front for Victory, forming one of its own called Peronism for Victory. History The Evita Movement emerged in 2004, as a result of the union of diverse groups from the Quebracho Revolutionary Patriotic Movement and the Anibal Ver√≥n Current of Unemployed Workers, with roots mainly in the suburbs of Buenos Aires. In its first year, the Evita Movement organized itself as a piquetero unemployed movement (MTD), but later redefined its purpose to reorganize itself as a popular revolutionary wing of Kirchnerism, acting with ample autonomy both inside and outside the Justicialist Party (PJ). In 2007 Emilio P√©rsico was named secretary of Territorial Organizations of the PJ. One of the unusual characteristics of the Evita Movement is that its electoral secretary has lacked interest in holding political office. The Evita Movement, like other movements of the unemployed, grants a central role to the organization of its members to work cooperatively, mainly in the construction of popular housing, financed by the state. The popular power policy of the Evita Movement was explained in these terms by one of its members: It participated in the 2017 legislative election, joining the Citizen's Unity electoral front.

His family continued to live in ≈†ilovo following the establishment the following year of the Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija as part of the People's Republic of Serbia in the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia.

Stojanoviƒá once again received the lead position on the Radical Party's list for Vranje for the concurrent Yugoslavian parliamentary elections and was re-elected when the party won one seat out of nine in the now expanded division.\\"–ö–ê–ù–î–ò–î–ê–¢–ò –°–†–ü–°–ö–ê –†–ê–î–ò–ö–ê–õ–ù–ê –°–¢–†–ê–ù–ö–ê –ó–ê –ò–ó–ë–û–† –°–ê–í–ï–ó–ù–ò–• –ü–û–°–õ–ê–ù–ò–Ü–ö–ê –£ –í–ï–ã–ï –ì–†–ê–Ç–ê–ù–ê –°–ê–í–ï–ó–ù–ï –°–ö–£–ü–®–¢–ò–ù–ï, Velika Srbija [Radical Party publication], September 2000, p. 14.–ò–ó–ë–û–†–ò 2000: –í–ï–ã–ï –†–ï–ü–£–ë–õ–ò–ö–ê –ò –í–ï–ã–ï –ì–†–ê–Ç–ê–ù–ê –°–ê–í–ï–ó–ù–ï –°–ö–£–ü–®–¢–ò–ù–ï, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Department of Statistics (2000), p. 62.

(From 2000 to 2011, Serbian parliamentary mandates were awarded to sponsoring parties or coalitions rather than to individual candidates, and it was common practice for mandates to be awarded out of numerical order. Stojanoviƒá could have been awarded a mandate notwithstanding his low position on the list, but he was not and instead continued to serve in the federal assembly.)Serbia's Law on the Election of Representatives (2000) stipulated that parliamentary mandates would be awarded to electoral lists (Article 80) that crossed the electoral threshold (Article 81), that mandates would be given to candidates appearing on the relevant lists (Article 83), and that the submitters of the lists were responsible for selecting their parliamentary delegations within ten days of the final results being published (Article 84).

Stojiljkoviƒá died two days later. His note, which was read to the media by Radical deputy Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá, indicated that his action was a protest against what he described as the \\"puppet regime\\" of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia, which he accused of capitulating to international powers.VLAJKO STOJILJKOVIC PUCAO SEBI U GLAVU, B92, 11 April 2002, accessed 27 June 2018. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was re-constituted as the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in early 2003, and a new Assembly of Serbia and Montenegro was established with members appointed by the parliaments of its two constituent republics. Each political group in the National Assembly of Serbia was permitted to appoint a delegation to the federal assembly commensurate with its numbers. Stojanoviƒá was not initially appointed to the new assembly,PETO VANREDNO ZASEDANJE, 25.02.2003, Otvoreni Parlament, 25 February 2003, accessed 27 June 2018. but he received a mandate in February 2004, after the 2003 Serbian parliamentary election changed the standings in the Serbian assembly and necessitated a new round of appointments.–û –î –õ –£ –ö –£ - –û –ò–ó–ë–û–†–£ –ü–û–°–õ–ê–ù–ò–ö–ê –°–ö–£–ü–®–¢–ò–ù–ï –°–†–ë–ò–à–ï –ò –¶–†–ù–ï –ì–û–†–ï, –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∞ —Å–∫—É–ø—à—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ –†–µ–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–µ –°—Ä–±–∏—ò–µ, accessed 28 April 2017.

The party experienced a serious split later in the year, with many of its members joining the more moderate Serbian Progressive Party under the leadership of Tomislav Nikoliƒá and Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá. Stojanoviƒá remained with the Radicals. Serbia's electoral system was reformed in 2011, such that parliamentary mandates were awarded in numerical order to candidates on successful lists.

Max Beer's editorship Parvus invited Max Beer to become editor-in-chief in 1919, a position he held until February 1921. Beer attempted to change its content, dropping support for the Majority Social Democratic Party of Germany. The magazine included reviews of National Socialist pamphlets, which Beer excused on the grounds that the Party was not \\"prominently\\" antisemitic during that period. Beer experienced increasing tension with Parvus which came to a head after he published an article by Maxim Gorky and an article he had written himself about the ethics of Bolshevism.

Tsien, he participated to the development of the intracellular trappable fluorescent Ca2+ indicators. His research group developed the first genetically encoded probes with selective subcellular localization. This new approach lead to a series of discoveries on the mechanisms of calcium metabolism and in particular it revolutionized the understanding of mitochondrial role in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. He is also interested in the signaling pathway controlled by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). His group generated the first genetically encoded fluorescent cAMP probe, contributed to establishing the concept of cAMP microdomains and described the existence of an autonomous cAMP homeostatic mechanism within the matrix of mitochondria.

The Orange Mound Spring is arguably most notable for its prominence above the ground, compared to the rest of the Mammoth Hot Springs, which are mostly flat and leveled terraces.  Flow, age and color  Orange Mound Spring, Yellowstone The Orange Mound Spring is thermally cooler (~170ÀöF) than most springs in Yellowstone and at the Mammoth Hot Springs themselves, allowing the orange-tinted cyanobacteria to thrive and color the spring a darker shade of orange than the rest of the Mammoth Terraces. Depending on the nutrients that the bacteria receive, the color may change throughout the year. The Spring is said to be very old due to the shape and size of the mound as well as how little water flows out of the spring itself. It has created other nearby cone- shaped springs from itself due to the travertine deposits wearing away. Often in the Mammoth Hot Springs, flow will turn on and off, so on some days it may have no flow at all, and others it may have a lot.

Stoiber went to Germany and completed a mining degree program. When he returned he began working as a mining engineer in Leadville, Colorado. In the mid-1880s, he went into business with his brother Gustavus, establishing a mill and mine in San Jan County near Silverton. By 1887, the brothers decided to part ways, with Edward keeping the Silver Lake mine. The following year he married Lena Allen Webster who would become joint owner of the business and an operational manager. Edward focused on mining engineering, which was crucial to find economical ways to mine and process low-grade ore. He investigated mining practices and ore processing until he was able to become a profitable enterprise that also brought prosperity to the San Juan mining district. Lena was a hard-driving, yet also caring manager, ensuring that the mining operations were effective. That included wearing men's clothes and performing work as needed. They were involved in community, philanthropic, and industry efforts, including dual-membership in the American Institute of Mining Engineers. Early life Stoiber was born September 18, 1855 in New York, New York. His parents were Helena Rouse and Felix Stoiber, who were members of the German Evangelical Mission Church in New York City. He was a graduate of the School of Mines at Freiberg. Career Background When prospectors first came to Colorado in search of gold or silver, they were more likely to find relatively high concentrations of metal as compared to rock. As the metal-rich mines were tapped out, lower-grade ore remained. That meant that the milling process had higher ratios of rock to metal and the extraction process would be more expensive. After a decade or two of heaving mining, there needed to be new more cost-effective processes to mine and process lower-grade ore to make a profit. Early years He began work as a mining engineer, joining the American Institute of Mining Engineers in 1877. He worked in Leadville for three years. On January 30, 1879, he married Gertrude Comstock in Clear Creek County, Colorado. He was single and living with his brother in San Juan County by 1885. In the mid-1880s Edward and his brother Gustavus obtained 200 claims at the head of Arrastra Gulch and established the Silver Lake Mine and operated a custom ore sampler. Edward became interested in a lode near Silver Lake and began buying claims. He established a mine at the lake, which was above the timberline at 12,250 feet in elevation. He began building one of the most modern mining facilities in the West, including a mill complex at Silver Lake. It was the first concentrating mill at that high altitude. The brothers had a disagreement in 1887 and dissolved their partnership with Edward retaining the mine. He investigated processes and devices for the treatment of ores and became one of the earliest operators to make a profit processing low-grade mixed sulphide ores. Partnership with Lena Lena Allen Stoiber, by 1913 Lena Allen Webster came to Silverton in 1884 as a married woman and her husband, F. C. Webster, disappeared or died mysteriously a few months later. Edward married Lena in Chicago on March 29, 1888. When the business was in its infancy, Lena started taking in boarders. She then became involved in the business by working in the mine and installing machinery. She wore men's clothing while she worked. They were joint owners. While Edward ran the engineering portion of the business, his wife Lena managed the miners. She gained the nickname of \\"Captain Jack\\" for her colorful language and tough demeanor. Lena became an associate member of the American Institute of Mining Engineers in 1894 and remained a member until her death in 1935. Business growth He had a 8,640 Bleichert tramway built in 1895 by the Trenton Iron Company to move the ore down the mountain to Arrastra Gulch. The tramway was capable of moving five tons of material per hour. The concentrates were then transported to a branch of the Silverton Railroad. He continued to expand his mining business, involving a partnership with J.H. Robin. He added another mill and a faster tramway, able to move 30 tons of material per hour. His business success led to prosperity within the San Juan mining district. Waldheim Waldheim, the Stoiber mansion in Silverton, about 1900. On the right is the hydropower plant that served the mansion, mine, and mill. Edward and Lena built a mansion called Waldheim, meaning forest home, in Silverton in 1897. Used as a home and office, the mansion had a conservatory, theater, and a ballroom. They built a hydropower plant to provide electricity to their mine, mill, and mansion. In 1901, he sold the Silver Lakes Mines to the American Smelting and Refining Company for $2.35 million (). Personal life Edward was well-respected by his employees, who he treated with kindness and consideration. He sought to improve the welfare of the mining industry across Colorado. Among his large gifts to educational institutions, he donated an elaborate set of instruments to the Colorado School of Mines and established a scientific section at the University Club library. Lena hosted dances and other entertainment for the workers, delivered presents to children at Christmas, and was a stalwart partner to her husband, doing whatever needed to be done to make the business run effectively. She also treated the workers well. Lena helped to establish Mesa Verde as a national park. She also founded a woman's group to do practical and historical literary work. Conversely, she could had a difficult temperament. For instance, Lena developed a tendency to build high walls between her neighbors and herself, both in her first house in Silverton with Edward and later at the mansion in Denver. After her Silverton neighbors added a second story to reclaim their view, she installed billboards above the fence to block it again. Later years and death After he sold his business, the Stoibers lived in Denver and traveled throughout Europe and the Far East. They lived in Paris, France beginning in 1904, but were planning on returning to Denver to build a mansion based on his sketches. Edward contracted typhoid fever on April 3, 1906 and died in Paris on April 21. Lena had a mausoleum built for him at Fairmount Cemetery. It was made of Vermont granite at a cost of about $30,000. The interior was made of Parian marble. After Edward died, Lena worked with architects using his sketches to have the Stoiber Mansion built in Denver in 1907. With In 1909, Lena married Hugh Rood, a capitalist from the Pacific Coast. He died on the RMS Titanic, after which Lena Stoiber-Hood went to Europe. On May 20, 1918, she married Commander Mark St. Clair Ellis of the United States Navy. She then went by the name of Lena Allen Stoiber-Ellis. She separated from Ellis following lawsuits that were brought by another woman. They were divorced March 15, 1932. Lena died on March 27, 1935 at her villa on Lake Como in Stresa, Italy.

For Bangladesh this decade was characterized by economic hardship, natural disasters and military dictatorship. Hussain Muhammad Ershad ruled Bangladesh almost throughout the decade. Infrastructure development was slow but there was notable progress in local government administration, population control and NGO led microfinance activities which boosted the rural economy. The urge of freedom of speech and return to democracy influenced the cultural activities in the decade. Politics and National life Assassination of Ziaur Rahman The decade began with President Ziaur Rahman at the helm. Zia faced twenty one attempted coups against his government, including one by the air force. His one time ally Colonel Abu Taher was tried for treason and executed. Similar fates were met by many of his perceived rivals in the armed forces. However, the final coup attempt resulted in his assassination in 1981. Zia was killed by troops loyal to Major General Abul Manzoor who stormed his official residence in Chittagong on 30 May 1981. The mutiny was later suppressed by army chief Lieutenant General Hussain Muhammad Ershad. Sattar administration Zia was succeeded by Vice-President Abdus Sattar. President Sattar received a popular mandate during the 1981 presidential election, despite allegations of vote rigging by his rival Kamal Hossain. Sattar's presidency was marked by infighting within the ruling BNP, which forced cabinet reshuffles and the resignation of Vice-President Mirza Nurul Huda. A national security council was formed amid anti-Bengali Muslim violence in Northeast India and Burma. Sattar also suffered from health problems due to old age. The 1982 Bangladesh coup d'√©tat deposed President Sattar and his civilian government. The Bangladesh military cited food shortages, corruption and economic mismanagement as reasons behind the coup. Ershad administration Presidential Oath Ceremony after 1986 election, with the Chief Justice and Military Secretary (1984‚Äì1989) Brigadier ABM Elias Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Hussain Muhammad Ershad assumed power in a bloodless coup on 24 March 1982, citing the \\"grave political, economic, and societal crisis\\" that the nation was in. This move was not unanticipated, as Ershad had previously expressed distaste with the ageing Sattar (who was past his 75th birthday) and his handling of national affairs, in addition to his refusal to allow the army more participation in politics. Like his predecessors, Ershad suspended the constitution and‚Äîciting pervasive corruption, ineffectual government, and economic mismanagement‚Äîdeclared martial law. Among his first actions were to privatise the largely state-owned economy (up to 70% of industry was in public ownership) and encourage private investment in heavy industries along with light manufacturing, raw materials, and newspapers. Foreign companies were invited to invest in Bangladeshi industry as well, and stiff protectionist measures were put in place to safeguard manufacturing. All political parties and trade unions were banned for the time being, with the death penalty to be administered for corruption and political agitation. Ershad's takeover was generally viewed as a positive development, as Bangladesh was in a state of serious economic difficulty. Two weeks before the coup in March, Prime Minister Shah Azizur Rahman announced that the country was facing significant food shortages. The government also faced a severe budget deficit to the tune of 4 billion takas, and the IMF declared that it would not provide any more loans until Bangladesh paid down some of its existing debts. The following year, Ershad assumed the presidency, retaining his positions as army chief and CMLA. During most of 1984, Ershad sought the opposition parties' participation in local elections under martial law. The opposition's refusal to participate, however, forced Ershad to abandon these plans. Ershad sought public support for his regime in a national referendum on his leadership in March 1985. He won overwhelmingly, although turnout was small. Two months later, Ershad held elections for local council chairmen. Pro-government candidates won a majority of the posts, setting in motion the President's ambitious decentralisation program. Political life was further liberalised in early 1986, and additional political rights, including the right to hold large public rallies, were restored. At the same time, the Jatiya (National) Party, designed as Ershad's political vehicle for the transition from martial law, was established. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Despite a boycott by the BNP, led by President Zia's widow, Begum Khaleda Zia, parliamentary elections were held on schedule in May 1986. The Jatiya Party won a modest majority of the 300 elected seats in the National Assembly. The participation of the Awami League‚Äîled by the late President Mujib's daughter, Sheikh Hasina Wajed‚Äîlent the elections some credibility, despite widespread charges of voting irregularities. Ershad resigned as Army Chief of Staff and retired from military service in preparation for the presidential elections, scheduled for October. Protesting that martial law was still in effect, both the BNP and the AL refused to put up opposing candidates. Ershad easily outdistanced the remaining candidates, taking 84% of the vote. Although Ershad's government claimed a turnout of more than 50%, opposition leaders, and much of the foreign press, estimated a far lower percentage and alleged voting irregularities. Ershad continued his stated commitment to lift martial law. In November 1986, his government mustered the necessary two-thirds majority in the National Assembly to amend the constitution and confirm the previous actions of the martial law regime. The President then lifted martial law, and the opposition parties took their elected seats in the National Assembly. Protest for democracy in Dhaka in 1987 In July 1987, however, after the government hastily pushed through a controversial legislative bill to include military representation on local administrative councils, the opposition walked out of Parliament. Passage of the bill helped spark an opposition movement that quickly gathered momentum, uniting Bangladesh's opposition parties for the first time. The government began to arrest scores of opposition activists under the country's Special Powers Act of 1974. Despite these arrests, opposition parties continued to organise protest marches and nationwide strikes. After declaring a state of emergency, Ershad dissolved Parliament and scheduled fresh elections for March 1988. All major opposition parties refused government overtures to participate in these polls, maintaining that the government was incapable of holding free and fair elections. Despite the opposition boycott, the government proceeded. The ruling Jatiya Party won 251 of the 300 seats. The Parliament, while still regarded by the opposition as an illegitimate body, held its sessions as scheduled, and passed numerous bills, including, in June 1988, a controversial constitutional amendment making Islam Bangladesh's state religion and provision for setting up High Court benches in major cities outside of Dhaka. While Islam remains the state religion, the provision for decentralising the High Court division has been struck down by the Supreme Court. By 1989, the domestic political situation in the country seemed to have quieted. The local council elections were generally considered by international observers to have been less violent and more free and fair than previous elections. However, opposition to Ershad's rule began to regain momentum, escalating by the end of 1990 in frequent general strikes, increased campus protests, public rallies, and a general disintegration of law and order. Administrative Division thumb In 1980, Bangladesh was administratively divided into 4 divisions, namely Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi which were further subdivided into a total of 18 districts (See List of districts of Bangladesh). On 23 December 1982 the Local Government (Thana Parishad and Thana Administration Reorganisation) Ordinance was promulgated to introduce major changes with respect to the system of local government at the thana level. Under the reorganised set-up, thana was designated as the focal point of administration. In 1983, the Local Government Ordinance of 1982 was amended to re-designate and upgrade the existing thanas as upazilas (sub-districts). Furthermore, during 1983‚Äì84, 46 new districts were created by upgrading them from thanas or upazilas. By the end of the decade the number of districts stood at 64. Demographics Based on World Development Indicators published by the World Bank the population of Bangladesh grew from 79 million at the beginning of the decade to 104 million by the end. This signifies an annual population growth rate of 2.7%. Population density increased from 609 to 796 per km2. The urban population was 14.9% of the total at the beginning, which ended up at 19.3%. Dhaka, the largest city, with a population of 3.3 million accounted for 27.0% of the total urban population by 1989. United Nations World Population Prospects show that the population growth rate was in decreasing trend (from 2.8% per annum to 2.6%), primarily due to reduction in fertility rate (births per woman) from 6.4 to 4.7. Life expectance at birth increased from 53.5 years to 57.8 years with Child (0-5) mortality reducing from 199 per 1,000 births to 150. Age dependency ratio (% of working-age population) changed from 91.9% to 84.7% by the end of the decade. Climate Temperature and Precipitation Compared to prior decade the average annual temperature increased by about 0.3 degree Celsius with most notable increases for the months of December and June. Average rainfall increased for April, May and July leading to overall average annual rainfall increase by about 131mm. Natural disasters With severe flooding followed by tropical cyclone, 1988 was the year with the worst natural disasters in the decade, and probably one of the worst in the history of independent Bangladesh. The country experienced heavy rain and flooding in August‚ÄìSeptember 1988. Nearly 25 million people were rendered homeless and official death toll exceeded 500. About 30,000 km of roads were partially destroyed and rice crop on 3.5 million hectares was destroyed or damaged. The situation started to improve in late September, but people rendered homeless due to the flood continued to struggle. Striking in November 1988, a cyclone exacerbated the catastrophic damage from what was then considered the worst floods in Bangladesh's history. The brunt of the tropical cyclone's damage was inflicted upon coastal areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal. A total of 6,240 people were killed as a result of the storm, with 5,708 in Bangladesh. Many of the deaths were a result of the destruction of homes or electrocution after strong winds toppled power poles across the region. Along the coast of Bangladesh, strong storm surge caused heavy infrastructure damage and contributed in wiping out an estimated 70% of all harvestable Bangladeshi crops, with an estimated 200,000 tonnes (220,000 tons) of crops being lost. Economy National Income and Balance of Payment Bangladesh GDP was US$28.6 billion in 1980, which grew to US$40.2 billion in 1989 (in 2010 constant dollar) signifying a 3.4% annual growth. Agricultural Sector contributed to 31.6% of GDP in the beginning of the decade, which increased to 32.9% by the end. During the same period contribution from the industrial sector decreased from 20.6% to 20.3% and that of the service sector decreased from 47.8% to 46.8%. Per capita GDP marginally increased from US$351 to US$388 (in 2010 constant dollar). According to World Development Indicators published by the World Bank, on 2010 constant dollar basis, Bangladesh used to export US$1.2 billion (5.5% of GDP) worth of goods and services as of 1980, which marginally declined to US$1.1 billion (5.5% of GDP) in 1989. During the same time import of goods and services decreased from US$4.6 billion (17.9% of GDP) to US$2.8 billion (12.8% of GDP). Over the decade, Foreign Direct Investment and Personal Remittances Receipt averaged 0.01% and 2.64% of GDP; while, total Reserve averaged at 6.6% of external debt and 2.0 month's coverage of import. Gross National Income (at 2010 constant dollar) grew from US$22.3 billion to US$28.4 billion over the decade. At the beginning of this period External Debt stock (of which concessional debt was 71.8%) was 6.1% of Gross National Income (GNI) and External Debt Service burden was 0.1% of GNI. By the end of the decade, External Debt stock (of which concessional debt now was 80.3%) stood at 19.1% of GNI and External Debt Service burden was 1.3% of the same. During the same period Military expenditure increased from 0.6% to 0.9% of GNI. Agriculture Aggregate value addition from agricultural sector was US$7.7 billion in 1980 (in 2010 constant USD), which grew at average annual rate of 1.4% to US$8.9 billion by 1989 (in the same constant USD). During this decade, crop production grew at an annual average rate of 2.0% driven by cereal production increase from 21.7 million metric tons to 27.9 million (implying annual growth of 2.5%) - enabled by improvement in cereal yield from 2006 kg per hectare to 2500 kg. At the same time livestock production grew at annual rate of 2.9% and fisheries production increased at 2.6% per annum. Altogether these contributed to overall food production increase by annualized rate of 2.2%. Industrial and Service Sectors Net value addition from industrial sector, which stood at US$4.0 billion in 1980 (in 2010 constant USD), grew at average annual rate of 5.2% to US$6.6 billion by 1989 (in the same constant USD basis). Manufacturing sector contributed 70.7% of industrial value added in the beginning of this period and it gradually changed to 64.6% by the end. By 1989 Manufacturers export accounted for 74.0% of total merchandise export while import supporting the manufacturing segment accounted for 56.7% of total merchandise import. In that year, textile and garments accounted for 37.7% of the value addition of the manufacturing sector. There were 1,347 recorded industrial design applications by Bangladeshi residents in this decade. In 1979-80 there were 3,006 industrial establishments in the country employing 0.42 million staffs. By 1989-90 the number of establishments grew to 24,283 and employment in the sector grew to 1.08 million. On the other hand, net value addition from the service sector amounting US$15.8 billion in 1980, also grew at average annual rate of 3.8% and stood at US$22.9 billion by 1989 (in 2010 constant USD). Major Businesses / enterprises that started journey in this decade in Bangladesh include Beximco Pharma in 1980, PRAN-RFL Group in 1981, BTI and Ha- meem Group in 1984, Orion Group, Paradise Group, S. Alam Group and Summit Group in 1985, Bashundhara Group in 1987 and Sheltech, Citycell and Meghna Group in 1989. Infrastructure Transportation and Communication Inland container depot (ICD) at Kamalapur Railway Station was introduced in 1987. When Bangladesh achieved independence in 1971, it inherited 3,860 km of paved roads which increased to about 6,600 km by end of 1980s.World Bank. 1991. Bangladesh - Transport sector review (English). Washington, DC: World Bank. On the contrary, by the end of the decade Bangladesh Railway was still operating a route of 2,800 km \\\\- roughly the same as that in the earlier decade. A UNDP funded Bangladesh Transportation Sector Study executed by World Bank in 1988 estimated that by 1985 the ground transport system of Bangladesh was already supporting 35 billion km of passenger commute and 4.8 billion km of freight transport. Road network accounted for 64% of the passengers and 48% of the freight whereas 20% of the passengers and 17% of the freight were transported using the rail network - indicating a significant shift from rail to road network compared to earlier decade. Still the railway sector was not uneventful in this decade. The Kamalapur railway station started providing container services with the establishment of the first inland container depot (ICD) of the country on 11 April 1987. Furthermore, to improve operational efficiency and safety, an optical fibre digital telecommunication network was installed over 1,800 km connecting about 300 railway stations during 1985‚Äì90. The inland water transport sector also saw some development during this decade with the opening of major river ports at Nagarbari (1983), Aricha (1983), Daulatdia (1983), Baghabari (1983) and Narsingdi (1989). However, ferry delays, siltation of the river system and shortage of capacity remained major bottlenecks of this sector. Air Transport sector also did not grow much in this decade. As of 1979, there were 14,800 registered carrier departures worldwide which ended up to 14,600 by 1989. During the same period number of passenger carried increased from 0.62 million to about 1.00 million per annum. In the beginning of the decade there were 95,000 fixed telephone line subscription in the country - which increased to 192,000 by the end signifying 0.19 lines per 100 people. Energy In 1980 per capital electric power consumption was 18.7 kWh, which increased to 49.2 kWh by 1989. During the same period per capital energy usage increased from 103.1 kg of oil equivalent to 116.8 kg and fossil fuel energy consumption increased from 32.1% to 45.1% of total. In 1980 the electricity produced in the country was coming from: hydroelectric sources: 24.8%, natural gas sources: 48.6% and oil sources: 26.6%. By 1989 there was a significant move towards natural gas based electricity production and as a result, the distribution changed to hydroelectric sources: 12.9%, natural gas sources: 78.9% and oil sources: 8.2%. Financial Services While in the 1970s the Financial Sector of Bangladesh was dominated by Public Sector banks (see here), in 1980s the Government started to pursue Privatization agenda. Uttara Bank and Pubali Bank were privatized in 1983. Other Private banks which started operation in this decade include Islami Bank Bangladesh, United Commercial Bank, The City Bank and National Bank in 1983, Arab Bangladesh Bank in 1985 and Al Baraka Bank (later named Oriental bank and subsequently ICB Islamic Bank) in 1987. The government's encouragement during the late 1970s and early 1980s of agricultural development and private industry brought changes in lending strategies. The number of rural bank branches doubled between 1977 and 1985, to more than 3,330. Denationalisation and private industrial growth led the Bangladesh Bank and the World Bank to focus their lending on the emerging private manufacturing sector. Scheduled bank advances to private agriculture, as a percentage of sectoral GDP, rose from 2 percent in FY 1979 to 11 percent in FY 1987, while advances to private manufacturing rose from 13 percent to 53 percent. The transformation of finance priorities brought with it problems in administration. No sound project-appraisal system was in place to identify viable borrowers and projects. Lending institutions were often instructed by the political authorities. In addition, the incentive system for the banks stressed disbursements rather than recoveries, and the accounting and debt collection systems were inadequate to deal with the problems of loan recovery. The rate of recovery on agricultural loans was only 27 percent in FY 1986, and the rate on industrial loans was even worse. As a result of this poor showing, major donors applied pressure to induce the Government and banks to take firmer action to strengthen internal bank management and credit discipline. As a consequence, recovery rates began to improve in 1987. The National Commission on Money, Credit, and Banking recommended broad structural changes in Bangladesh's system of financial intermediation early in 1987, many of which were built into a three-year compensatory financing facility signed by Bangladesh with the IMF in February 1987. One major exception to the management problems of Bangladeshi banks was the Grameen Bank, which begun as a government project in 1976 and established in 1983 as an independent bank. In the late 1980s, the bank continued to provide financial resources to the poor on reasonable terms and to generate productive self-employment without external assistance. About 70 percent of the borrowers were women, who were otherwise not much represented in institutional finance. The average loan by the Grameen Bank in the mid-1980s was around Tk2,000 (US$25), and the maximum was just Tk18,000 (for construction of a tin-roof house). Repayment terms were 4 percent for rural housing and 8.5 percent for normal lending operations. The wave of Privatization touched the insurance sector and capital market as well. Until 1985, Jiban Bima Corporation was the only institution to handle life insurance business in Bangladesh. Through the Insurance (Amendment) Ordinance 1984 and Insurance Corporations (Amendment) Ordinance 1984, the government allowed the private sector to establish insurance companies. In the mid-1980s, two private investment companies namely, National Credit Ltd. and Bangladesh Commerce and Investment Ltd., were permitted to participate in the capital market, although their activities remained limited.

History The temple was first established between 668 and 670, under the Tang dynasty (618-907). It was converted from the private residence donated by painter and official Yan Liben. The temple had reached unprecedented heyday in the Song dynasty (960-1279), during that time, it was about 30 mu in size with over 100 rooms and halls, and included 160 monks. After Song dynasty, the temple declined and was incredibly disappeared during the late Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Puning Temple was restored in 1822, in the reign of Daoguang Emperor in the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). In 1924, Puning Temple became collapsed for neglect. Then Abbot Fasen () rebuilt it. In 1933, in order to built the Zhejiang‚ÄìJiangxi railway, the government demolished the Middle Hall. In 1942, Puning Temple turned to ashes by a devastating fire during the Japanese invasion of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Architecture Now the existing main buildings include Shanmen, Heavenly Kings Hall, Mahavira Hall, Buddhist Texts Library and the Tomb of Yan Liben.

An associate of Luis Posada Carriles, he was convicted of attempting to kidnap a Cuban consul in Mexico in 1976, for which he served 27 months in prison. He was also convicted of attempting to assassinate Cuban President Fidel Castro in Panama in 2000, and was jailed until 2004 when he was pardoned by outgoing Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso. __NOTOC__ Biography Jim√©nez was born on October 6, 1935 in the Cuban city of Camag√ºey. He worked as a day laborer in Miami for some time, and had a wife and two daughters in 1983. Jim√©nez was a naturalized US citizen. A physically imposing man who weighed 300 pounds, Jim√©nez was nicknamed \\"El Gordo\\", or \\"Fat\\". According to reporter Ann Louise Bardach, Jim√©nez worked for Alberto Hern√°ndez, who would later head the Cuban American National Foundation, in the 1990s, and later worked for the foundation himself. In July 1976, Jim√©nez and an associate named Orestes Ruiz were arrested in Mexico, and accused of attempting to kidnap Cuban consul Daniel Ferrer. Ferrer's bodyguard, Artagnan Diaz, was killed in the attempt. A third accused, Gustavo Castillo, avoided arrest and returned to the US. A Mexican court convicted them of involvement in the kidnapping, and convicted Ruiz of shooting the bodyguard. According to the Miami Herald, both Jim√©nez and Castillo had been described by a US Justice Department memorandum as having \\"extensive backgrounds in terrorist activities\\", mostly outside the US. A report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into terrorist activities targeting the Cuban government of Fidel Castro prominently mentioned both Castillo and Jim√©nez. After their arrest, a US Federal prosecutor stated that the two had been linked to anti- Castro bombings in Latin America; the men denied the allegations. In March 1977, Jim√©nez managed to escape from prison, and returned to Miami. Jim√©nez and Castillo were both arrested in Miami by US authorities in January 1978, and deported to Mexico to serve their sentences in 1981. The Cuban-American community in Miami lobbied heavily for his release, but the US Supreme Court did not block his extradition. Jim√©nez's initial 9-year sentence was reduced to reflect time that he worked while in prison, and the three years he spent imprisoned in the United States awaiting extradition, and he was freed in May 1983. In 1981, Jim√©nez and Castillo were indicted by a grand jury for a bombing attack against Cuban-American radio presenter Emilio Mili√°n in 1976; Jim√©nez had been identified as a leading suspect by investigators in the case. A witness said he saw Jim√©nez working on Milian's car shortly before the bombing. Soon after Jim√©nez's release from prison, however, the indictment was dropped, with the prosecuting attorney stating that there was insufficient evidence. No one was prosecuted for the bombing. Jim√©nez worked for a while as a courier carrying money and messages to Luis Posada Carriles, a Cuban exile associated with a number of terrorist attacks against the Cuban government. An acquaintance of Jim√©nez stated that the money came from Cuban exiles in Miami. On November 17, 2000, 200 pounds of explosives were discovered in Panama City in the possession of Posada Cariles. Posada and three others, including Jim√©nez and Guillermo Novo, were arrested for plotting to assassinate Castro, who was then visiting Panama for the first time since 1959. While Jim√©nez and the others were incarcerated in Panama, Cuban-American US congressmen Lincoln and Mario D√≠az-Balart wrote to Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso asking for their release. Convicted in 2004, the four men were pardoned by Moscoso shortly before she left office later the same year. Jim√©nez died on October 29, 2014, of natural causes: he was 79 years old.

Individual artists as well as art groups expressed their opposition to the Marcos regime through various forms of visual art, such as paintings, murals, posters, editorial cartoons, and comics. Many forms of protest art carried themes of social realism, which art historian Alice Guillermo defines as art that aims to expose the true conditions of society. Popular forms of protest art also served as materials used in protest rallies. Many works of art represent struggles of the working class, such as workers and the urban poor, women's struggle, tribal Filipinos, the clergy and religious, and the antifascist, anti-colonial, and anti- imperialist struggles.  Prominent Artists and Art Organizations  Protest art against the Marcos dictatorship began during his first presidential term in 1965-1969. At the time it was closely associated with journalism and its daily reporting of social and political issues. Its earliest forms came as editorial cartoons in magazines and newspapers such as Philippines Free Press and Asia-Philippines Leader. One of top political cartoonists of the time was Danilo Dalena, who satirized public figures and criticized issues such as militarism, collusion with the U.S. government officials, and military abuses. Another prominent figure was Jaime de Guzman, who painted themes of nationalism on canvas and murals. One of his murals were painted in the Kabataang Makabayan headquarters, and carrying themes of Philippine anti- colonial revolutions which, for him, resonated with social struggles at the time. Benedicto Cabrera, or BenCab, also contributed significant work during this time. According to Alice Guillermo, his art presented elements of class- consciousness and nationalist themes, sympathizing with the social conditions of the masses. The years 1970 to 1972 saw the formation of art organizations dedicated to criticizing the Marcos regime. Artists and architects from various colleges banded together to form the organization Nagkakaisang Progresibong Artista at Arkitekto (NPAA) or 'United Progressive Artists and Architects‚Äô, in 1971. NPAA's art was informed by the doctrines of Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin and Mao Tse-Tung. The nature of their art was that it was \\"art for the masses\\". Members of NPAA immersed in depressed areas to interact with the people and to conduct workshops. Others went to the countryside to see the lives of the peasants and engage them in political education, at times linked with armed struggle. In 1976, the art collective Kaisahan (Solidarity) was formed, emerging from Leftist efforts to mobilize the youth in the struggle against the 'exploitative forces of US imperialism and its local agents'. Kaisahan circulated a manifesto similar to the ideals of NPAA, which focuses on the formation and understanding of a national identity, opposing the Philippines' relationship with the West and its consequent westernization.  Themes of Social-Realist Art  19th Century Colonial History and Revolution. Artists drew parallels between the revolution against the Spanish colonizers in the nineteenth century, and the struggle against the Marcos dictatorship. Both portrayed similarities in the history against oppressive powers and themes of national identity. Some examples include Benedicto Cabrera's Filipino Prisoners of War, A Public Execution, The Last March, and Brown Man's Burden. Orlando Castillo also painted images from the 19th century Philippine history, such as Sulat Kay Ina 1896. Renato Habulan painted a series of Sisa paintings, based on Jose Rizal's character who was a mother driven to madness after losing her two sons in colonial repression. Some of these include Sa Lupi ng Katahimikan ni Sisa (In the Fold of Sisa's Silence). Edgar Talusan Fernandez also represented themes from colonial history in his Gomburza, which depicts the three martyred priests. Anti-Imperialist Struggle. According to Alice Guillermo, imperialism was often associated with images of the American Uncle Sam with his top hat, striped coat and pants, often as a puppeteer manipulating Philippine government officials. Many artists also represented the collusion of the American government with the Marcos dictatorship, often using U.S. presidents as icons. Orlando Castillo's Justice Under Martial Law presents Ferdinand Marcos partially covered by the American flag, while he also wears a Barong Tagalog. Uncle Sam's figure was found in many murals, posters, leaflets and effigies burn during protest rallies and demonstrations. Danilo Dalena employed the Uncle Sam theme in his editorial cartoon for the Asia-Philippines Leader. Kaisahan artist Pablo Baens Santos also employed anti-imperialist themes in his Panginoong Maylupa and Komprador, both showing U.S. collusion with local elites. Neil Doloricon's Lakas Paggawa is a collage of colored ads and logos of multinational products, beside figures of factory workers. In his painting Reagan, the American president oversees demolition and hamletting. Workers and the Urban Poor. According to art historian Alice Guillermo, a large number of social realist paintings had themes of workers and labor power, and their relations within a colonial and feudal system. The exodus of Filipino migrant workers due to unemployment and underemployment during the Marcos administration also reflected in themes of protest art. In 1985, the Committee for the Advancement of Filipino People's Art (CAPFA) helped an exhibit entitled \\"A Tribute to Workers: Philippine International Art Exhibition 1\\", held in Broadway in New York City. It was primarily organized by sculptor Rey Contreras, painter Papo de Asis and Bob Ortaliz of the Kilusang Mayo Uno. Major themes about workers and their conditions are about alienation, images of workers, class contradiction, strikes, workers and machines, poverty, political oppression, and the plights of migrant workers. Antipas Delotavo's series Mga Kaluluwang Di-Masinagan (Souls in Darkness) portrays dialectic between man as a worker alienated from his humanity. Delotavo also painted Piping Tagulaylay (Mute Lament) and Bulong na Umaalingawngaw (Echoing Whisper), which are also concerned with the theme of the urban poor. Pablo Baen Santos's Komprador and Welga are both about labor strikes, which occurred frequently during the 1980s. Labor strikes was also the subject matter of other paintings, such as Neil Doloricon's Huling Balita (Last News), Wanted: Dead or Alive, Itaas ang Sahod (Increase Wages), and Hinagpis (Grief). Struggle against Feudalism and the Exploitation of Farm Workers. Art that represented peasants and farm workers during the Marcos administration were often social realist in nature, protesting the feudal and exploitative conditions in the countryside. Aside from portraits of peasants, many artists aimed to invoke a greater sense of class consciousness. Benedicto Cabrera's Ang Tao (The Man) was part of his series of paintings and prints inspired by old Philippine photographs. It depicts the Filipino peasant, one whose economic oppression has not changed through history. Renato Habulan also depicted peasants and farm workers in his Lakas Series in 1981. Pablo Baen Santos has also painted numerous paintings of peasants, such as Panginoong Maylupa (Landlord). It portrays a landlord in collusion with an American and other foreign powers, reflecting labor and agricultural issues of the time, where the Philippines exported raw materials and agricultural products, but imports costly finished products in return. The plight of the Sugar Plantation Workers was also a theme of social realist paintings. They often depicted the contrast between the two social classes, as seen in the sakada, or farm worker and the landlord. Renato Habulan's show Dulo't Dulo (Polarities) was a series of paintings that showed the contrast between the landlord and peasant, and the comprador capitalist and farm worker. Antipas Delotavo's show Mga Bayaning Di-Kilala (Unknown Heroes) had content from his exposure trip to Hacienda Luisita. His paintings portrayed sugar workers, cargadores of cane stalks, train operators, machinists and their families. Indigenous Filipinos. Under the Marcos administration, PANAMIN, or Presidential Assistance on National Minorities, was in charge of protecting the rights of the national minorities. However, in many cases, the commission supported the affairs of business corporations in detriment of the lives of the minorities. In Abra in Northern Luzon, the logging corporation called Cellophil Resources displaced thousands of Tinggians from their ancestral lands. In Mindanao, Del Monte Corporation's Philippine subsidiary displaced 14,000 indigenous Bukidnons with the help of the military and PANAMIN. Artists stood in solidarity with the indigenous peoples by spreading awareness of their issues. Renato Habulan created a Cordillera series, referring to the people's resistance against the Chico Dam project. His Ala-ala kay Makli-ing (Memory of Macli-ing) is a homage to Macli- ing Dulag, the leader of the Kalinga people who led the resistance against the Chico River Dam project. Santiago Bose created a mixed media work entitled Bury My Heart in Chico Dam, sympathetic to the struggle of the Cordilleran peoples. Rey Paz Contreras created a sculpture series entitled Sacred Land, created from aged wood from discarded railroad ties, animal bones and skulls, old tools and weapons and tribal textiles.

From late 1935 it was known as the Th√©√¢tre de l'√âtoile. Located at 35 Avenue de Wagram in the 17th arrondissement, the theatre saw the premieres of numerous French operettas as well as Antonin Artaud's play Les Cenci. It had no connection to another theatre also known as the Th√©√¢tre de l'√âtoile which was located on the Champs-√âlys√©es and operated from 1923 to 1926. History The theatre was built on the initiative of Paul Fournier and the Lutetia-Empire company which already owned a number of cinemas in Paris as well as two large music halls, the on Avenue Wagram and the Bobino on Rue de la Ga√Æt√©. The architect of the new theatre was Paul Farge who had also designed the renovation of the Empire. The theatre's interior had a pink and silver colour scheme and had a seating capacity of 1500. A smoking foyer and an American bar were located on the first floor. Th√©√¢tre de l'√âtoile logo in 1945 On 14 March 1928 the Folies-Wagram was inaugurated with a gala revue featuring Marie Dubas, Henri Garat, and the comedian Cariel. Later that year, the theatre staged the French premiere of Oscar Straus's operetta Teresina. It would be the first of many operettas to premiere there. Prior to World War II, the Folies-Wagram staged primarily operettas and revues. The rare exception was the world premiere on 6 May 1935 of Antonin Artaud's play Les Cenci, a violent tale of incest, murder and betrayal. After its summer closure in 1935, the theatre reopened in the autumn as the Th√©√¢tre de l'√âtoile and continued its repertoire of operettas and revues. In the post-World War II years the √âtoile also saw many shows by individual singers. Edith Piaf appeared in 1945, accompanied on the piano by her prot√©g√© for the first time. Yves Montand had earlier appeared in a show with Piaf and in 1951 returned in a one-man show, accompanied by jazz guitarist Henri Crolla and the Bob Castella Orchestra. That same year Charles Trenet made his French come-back with a show at the √âtoile after spending several years in the United States. Marlene Dietrich's show opened in 1959 with an audience that included Jean Cocteau and Maurice Chevalier. Increasing financial difficulties led to the theatre's permanent closure at the beginning of 1964. It was later demolished and replaced by an office and commercial building. Operetta premieres Operettas premiered at the Th√©√¢tre des Folies-Wagram include: *Teresina by Oscar Straus, 25 May 1928 (premiere of French version) *L'Orloff by Bruno Granichstaedten, 8 December 1928 (French premiere) *Tip-Toes by George Gershwin, 26 April 1929 (French premiere) *Rosy by Raoul Moretti, 24 February 1930 (world premiere) *Zou! by Josef Szulc, 2 May 1930 (world premiere) *Brummell by Reynaldo Hahn, 17 January 1931 (world premiere) References External links *Advertisement for the gala opening of the Th√©√¢tre des Folies-Wagram in Le Petit journal (14 March 1928) p. 4 (on Gallica) *Sound clips from the live recording of Yves Montand at the Th√©√¢tre de l'√âtoile in 1951 (on Gallica) Category:Former theatres in Paris Category:1928 establishments in France Category:Buildings and structures in the 17th arrondissement of Paris Category:Theatres completed in 1928 Category:1964 disestablishments in France ","title":"Th√©√¢tre des Folies-Wagram"},{"id":"57783347","text":"The Brazilian Marine Pipes, Drum and Bugle Corps (Banda Marcial dos Fuzilieiros Navais) is the only field music (corps of drums, drum and bugle corps and pipe band) formation in service in the Brazilian Marine Corps and within the wider Brazilian Navy, and one of a few active formations today in service in the Brazilian Armed Forces. Formed in 1822 on the basis of the field music formations of the present day Portuguese Marine Corps stationed in Brazil (when it was part of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves and then as part of the Royal Brigade of the Navy (Brigada Real da Marinha) stationed in the colony), it is also the oldest in South America.  Brief history and present day role The BMPDC, as a component of the Marine Corps and the Navy, has been the primary field music formation of the corps since independence, and plays alongside the Central Band of the Brazilian Marine Corps in all ceremonies of national importance. Its first appearance in Independence Day parades in the former capital city of Rio de Janeiro in modern times was in 1922, and has been in all parades held in the current capital, Brasilia, since 1960. It has been based in the Fortaleza de S√£o Jos√© Marine Barracks, Ilha das Cobras, Rio de Janeiro, and honors the field drummers and buglers who fought in every major Marine Corps combat operation since 1808. In the Independence Day parade of 7 September 1946, the then Drum, Fife and Bugle Corps had just been reorganized in the manner of the United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps, in response to and in honor of the Brazilian participation in the Second World War as a 123-strong field music formation, during that parade it was then made up of the Corps Bandmaster, the deputy bandmaster, the drum major, 8 bass drums, 8 single tenor drums, 8 cymbals, 8 snare drums, 16 field snare drums, 16 fifes, 24 1st bugles, 24 2nd bugles and 16 tenor bugles. In 1951, it became the Pipes, Drum and Bugle Corps when 16 Great Highland bagpipes, a gift to the Corps by bagpipers of the British Armed Forces, arrived in Brazil and was given to the Corps by the crew of the USS St. Louis (CL-49), which under the name Almirante Tamandar√©, was commissioned as the flagship of the Navy. Another relic of the past lies in its Turkish crescent, a symbol and instrument of European origin used in the old bands of the Army and Navy in the 19th century. The following year, the BMPDC was deployed to the United Kingdom to celebrate the Coronation of Elizabeth II and the bagpipers played for the first time, after receiving bagpipe training in the Army School of Bagpipe Music and Highland Drumming based in Edinburgh by British Army instructors. The Corps had also performed on behalf of the Navy in France, Paraguay and Portugal, in the 2005 Bastille Day military parade and in the 2011 Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo. In 1956, the drum corps appeared on film for the first time when it performed in the movie Fuzileiro do Amor. Recent national performances include the 2007 Pan- American Games, 2011 Military World Games and the 2016 Summer Olympics. Today, aside from activities for the Marine Corps and the entire Brazilian Navy, the BMPDC tours the whole of Brazil, performing in many cities and in the annual Marine Corps Evening Parade yearly in Rio de Janeiro. Led today by the Corps Bandmaster Cmdr Ennes Fernando da Silva and the Deputy Bandmaster WO Ces√°rio Jos√© Barbosa Neto, the now 150-strong field music formation draws on its more than 200 years of service and continues to be a part of Brazil's military heritage., In recent years, the bugles which served the band for more than half a century are now replaced by trumpets, cornets, mellophones and baritone bugles, and there has been a multiple tenor drum and two glockenspiels as well in the drumline, which now has shoulder mounted snare drums instead of the old slinged side drums, in addition the second more senior NCO of the formation serves as the Corps Drum Major, following the format of the British Army and the Royal Marines, after many years of absence. It shares the duties of being the flagship premier ensemble of the Navy with the Central Band of the Marine Corps.  Musical repertoire  As a military marching band, the Pipes, Drum and Bugle Corps exclusively plays traditional marches adapted for the brass, fife and the bagpipe, in addition to contemporary works and Brazilian pop and folk tunes. Among many other marches, its primary repertoire includes the following: * Cisne Branco * Commander Narciso March * Living in Beulah Land * Tiro de Guerra * Suricate I * March no.10 See also  * Brazilian Navy * Brazilian Marine Corps References  External links  * * Category:Military bands Category:Brazilian Navy Category:Drum and bugle corps Category:Musical groups established in the 1820s Category:1822 establishments in Brazil Category:Pipe bands ","title":"Brazilian Marine Pipes, Drum and Bugle Corps"},{"id":"57783351","text":"R√©my Roy (born 1958) is a homophobic French serial killer nicknamed \\"The Minitel Killer\\".

He very actively helped his wife in his bookstore, full-time without being paid. In 1988, Fran√ßoise hired a friend. He found himself without activity and decided to open a promotional video creation company based in his home. But his company never reached the breakeven point. Unwanted, he sunk into depression, spending his time in bed, nibbling and gaining up to 120 kg. He began to use the Minitel, devoted more and more time, several hours each day.  The facts and the investigation  On October 11, 1990 in the afternoon, in an undergrowth at Draveil on the banks of the Seine, R√©my Roy had an appointment with Paul Bernard, a 46-year-old insurance agent. He lived in Issy-les-Moulineaux, with his retired mother, a widow of 25 years. His family called him \\"Saint Paul\\". He used the intensely pink homosexual minitel under the pseudonyms \\"hpoilu75\\", \\"hpoilu75asoumettre\\" or \\"hpoilu75aexhiber\\", and thus has many contacts. He had masochistic tendencies. Roy gagged him with a scarf, tied his hands to his back and the testicles with string and fractured his skull with a big stone. On October 12, 1990, around 10 am, a fisherman found Paul Bernard naked, lying on his stomach, his head covered with trousers. His car was found in the parking lot of the marina about a kilometer away. Paul Bernard died of asphyxiation, probably strangled, as he has traces of links around the neck. On the night of 19 to 20 October 1990, R√©my Roy went to Champigny-sur-Marne in the pavilion of Gilbert Duquesnoy, an astrologer \\"mage Nathaniel\\", 48-years-old. Gilbert Duquesnoy used the pink homosexual minitel intensively under the pseudonyms \\"Daisy\\" or \\"Coralie\\".\\"The man who hated men denies killing. Claude Roy, 33, has been appearing since Friday in the Assize Court of Val-de-Marne ¬ª Article by Brigitte Vital-Durand published on June 26, 1996 in Lib√©ration He also had masochistic tendencies. He had a consultancy in Paris on the 9th. They talked while drinking a glass of port wine. Roy covered his head with a leather hood, attacheed his ankles and hands to his back, and smashed the right side of his skull with at least seven very violent hammer blows. Roy left with the hammer, the glass in which he drank, the diary and the address books of Gilbert. Gilbert's dachshund followed him for a moment on the street. Roy threw the hammer into the river Marne. At the Nogent-sur-Marne Station, he went the RER where he threw Gilbert's diary and address books. On October 22, 1990, Alain, Gilbert's husband, worried about having no news, asked his neighbors to check on him in the pavilion. They found him lying naked on his stomach on his bed in the room on the first floor. His house was in great disorder. Next to the bed, there was an open briefcase containing objects for sexual use. On November 17, 1990, around 11 AM, R√©my Roy went to Paris in the 16th to Hugues Moreau, head of a wall covering company for 41 years. Roy smashed his skull several times with a big metal faucet. He stole checkbooks, bank cards and a fax machine. Hugues was discovered around 13 hours later by his wife in the back shop, lying naked on his belly, hands tied to his back, with chains around his waist. Beside him there was a bag containing a whole range of sadomasochistic objects. A few days later, at the Fnac in Paris, R√©my Roy bought an underwater camcorder, which he paid for with one of the stolen checks. On October 8, 1991, R√©my Roy went to Villeneuve-Saint-Georges to Bruno Giraudon, a 32-year-old public servant. He used the pink homosexual minitel under the pseudonym \\"other thing\\" to find complicity, tenderness and if, possible love. They drank and discussed various subjects. Roy said he is a photographer in newspapers specialized in the world of sailing. Then he told Bruno that he practised sadomasochistic practices. He took out of his bag the material he had brought. He offered Bruno to try it, but he refused. Roy hit him on the head with a stone lamp foot, and he fainted. Roy stole a bag containing a checkbook and all his identity papers, he leaft Bruno for dead and put the accessories on the ground. Bruno's friends discovered him, lying naked on his stomach, bathed in his blood. He was taken into a coma at the hospital and was only able to make statements to the police after three days of care. A month later, at a video hardware store, Roy bought a flatbed editor and a video recorder. He told the seller that he had a camcorder to make underwater shots, and he wanted a compatible flatbed editor to go with it. He paid with one of the stolen checks from Bruno Giraudon. The price being 14 900 french francs, the seller asked for an ID. Roy presented Bruno Giraudon's driver's license, on which he had placed his photo. The seller photocopied it. A few hours later, he made another purchase in another video store, which he also paid with a stolen check from Bruno. The store was equipped with CCTV cameras. The investigators thus obtained images of R√©my Roy. They presented them to the editors of a dozen newspapers specialized in the world of sailing. Alain Coroller, editor- in-chief of Neptune Yachting, identified R√©my Roy.  Arrest  In November 1991, R√©my Roy was arrested at his home in Villejuif. In his parka, investigators found Bruno Giraudon's checkbook and his driver's license with Roy's photo. His criminal record was blank. He was incarcerated in Fresnes prison. During interrogations in police custody, he stated that: * he is not homosexual and he hated them. * it was to break his loneliness and boredom, and that he used the pink messengers on minitel just to talk. Sadomasochistic homosexuals then approached him, harassing him on these messengers, which was unbearable for him. * Paul Bernard made contact with him on the pink minitel. He agreed to meet him, just to chat. He made an appointment with Paul Bernard at the Draveil marina, where he often went for bike rides. On the spot, they talked a little, then the discussion drifted towards sex and Paul Bernard tells him that he is an exhibitionist and offered to meet again. A week later, while riding a bicycle, he accidentally met Bernard in the parking lot of the marina. They talked a little, then Bernard invited Roy to follow him in the undergrowth, where he offered show something off. Roy warned him that he agrees to look at him, but not to touch him. Bernard undressed, asked Roy to gag him, knot a string around his testicles and asked him to tie his hand to a tree. Bernard then rubbed against him and took his hand for him to masturbate. Angry, Roy hit him. Bernard then fell and bumped his head on a stone. It is certain that Bernard was still alive when he escaped. * he met Gilbert Duquesnoy at a show of clairvoyance while he was looking for his promotional film production company. The mage Nathaniel, with whom he had long discussed, asked him to make a quote for a video advertisement and meet him a few weeks later at his home in Champigny-sur-Marne. At the beginning of the evening at Gilbert Duquesnoy's, after having talked about the film's business and direction, the conversation abruptly changed, advancing towards Roy by putting his hand on his leg and starting a videotape of a homosexual pornographic film. Roy wanted to leave. Gilbert restrained him and said that he wanted to give him a copy of his book, inviting Roy to follow him to his room on the first floor. There, Gilbert took out of a bag a blonde wig and a dress with fringes, to disguise himself as a prostitute and asking Roy to slap him, to which he refused. Gilbert then went into the bathroom and came out quickly naked, wearing only a leather hood. Disgusted, Roy knocked down Gilbert by hitting and kicking him, making him fall on the bed. He grabbed the first object that came to hand: a hammer, and struck Gilbert on the head. He attached his ankles to him with wide scotch tape, from which he brought a roll, but changed his mind and tied it to him with a rope found in a crate. Having calmed down, he took Gilbert's pulse, making sure he is not dead, and fled. * he met Hugues Moreau at the decoration salon as part of his work. He went to Hugues' house to present him with a quote for a video film. Hugues greeted him wearing a Burberry raincoat. As soon as he entered, Hugues opened his raincoat, under which he wore only chains around his genitals. Outraged and furious, Roy pushed him into the back room and hit him. Hugues fell to the ground unconscious, while Roy continued to hit him on the head. Hugues was still alive when he left. * he contacted through the minitel a masochistic woman and went to her home with his equipment. It was Bruno Giraudon, naked, who welcomed him. Angry at having been deceived, Roy beat him violently. Bruno banged his head on a coffee table as he fell. Roy then fled, persuaded that Bruno is still alive. * he did not assault or kill anyone else. The investigators did not find another victim in their files. Jean Martel, expert psychiatrist and Caroline Legendre, expert psychologist, noted that Roy said he suffered a lot of his father's absences, who traveled a lot. His mother often whipped him with a leather thong. At school his classmates belittled him. He was tied by the arm to a branch and undressed. When he was 13 years old, while in a cinema, a man sitting next to him forced him to masturbate and ejaculated him. When he was 17 years old in terminal school, he had a band of friends to do some services (repairing audio devices, electronics) for a little money. His friends found that his services cost them too much money, demanding that he repaid them, which he could not. They offered him as an alternative, to show off naked in a gym for an elderly man. He refused and ran away. They all then collectively raped him in an apartment. That's why he hated homosexuals. The police investigated these facts and established that they never occurred. Investigators understood that it's not his memories he described, but his fantasies. For psychiatrists, these stories revealed his sadomasochistic tendencies, which he repressed when he was active. They freed themselves when he found himself idle and depressed in front of the Minitel. Not supporting this image that it sends back of itself, he killed. Roy was charged with murdering Paul Bernard and Gilbert Duquesnoy, the assassination attempt on Bruno Giraudon and for murdering Hugues Moreau. The premeditation on Hugues Moreau was not retained because R√©my Roy came to his house without equipment and used the one that Hugues Moreau had at his place.

Chinatown, My Chinatown is a 1929 animated short film which was presented by Max Fleischer and directed by Dave Fleischer. The film, which was originally released by Paramount, features a sing-along version of the song \\"Chinatown, My Chinatown\\", a song that was originally published in 1910. The film also features Chinese caricatures, whose doings are stereotypical Chinese, such as eating Chinese food and ironing a shirt, as it was common for laundromats to be run by Chinese immigrants at that time. Copyright on August 2, 1929 and released on the 29nd, the film is part of \\"follow the bouncing ball\\" series entitled Screen Songs. These films would instruct the audience to sing that said-song. Plot A Chinese caricature jumping on the lyrics and acting as the bouncing ball. The film opens, with stereotypical Chinese music, to two Chinese caricatures. One of them is eating Chinese food with chopsticks, the other one is ironing a shirt next to him. Then, the ironer, whilst trying to test the heat of the iron, drops the shirt into the eater's bowl. The eater then comically eats the shirt. Once the ironer notices the shirt's disappearance and investigates the eater about it, he spits out a button. This angers the ironer, who pings it at the eater's face. This also angers the eater, who hits his chopsticks at the ironer's head. This starts a fight between the two of them, with both of them comically using their pointy hats as swords. This ends with the eater's hat being damaged. However this does not stop him for stabbing the ironer in the buttocks. This makes the ironer cry out a Chinese letter, which morphs into the bouncing ball, used in the Screen Songs to help the audience keep up with the song. An unnamed man invites the audience, through broken English and a Chinese accent, to sing-along and follow the bouncing ball. However he comically warns the audience that if they do not sing, then they will not wash their clothes. The song sung is \\"Chinatown, My Chinatown\\", which is played with Chinese instruments, such as a gong which is struck several times during the song. There are also animated footage where other caricatures perform actions according to the lyrics which are played during the song. The last section of the song features a Chinese man in place of the bouncing ball, by jumping on the lyrics. The lyrics comically lead him to his clothes-line, and the film ends with him drawing his clothes-line to his house. Characters In the film, there are numerous Chinese caricatures. The main two, which is featured in the first half of the film, speak nonsense words, which is meant to parody Mandarin, and they also fight near the end of the first half. The other caricatures, who are featured in the second half of the film, or the sing-along section, perform actions according to the lyrics, and also attempt to attack the person who is acting as the bouncing ball near the end of the film. Reception Chinatown, My Chinatown was well received by The Film Daily. Reviewed as Chinatown, the magazine said the film was a \\"corking piece of entertainment\\" and also said the film was \\"Great fun\\".

He joined Oldham Athletic after leaving the Academy at Stoke City in 2015, and had a youth loan with Chorley early the following year. He signed with Walsall in July 2016, and spent the 2016‚Äì17 season on loan at Chester. He joined Gateshead in July 2017, before returning to the English Football League with Port Vale in July 2018. He moved on to Macclesfield Town in July 2019 and dropped back into the National League to join Wrexham in August 2020. Playing career Early career Vassell grew up in Stoke-on-Trent and played Ladsandads football for Hanley Town, before joining the Academy at Stoke City at the age of nine. Originally a forward, he later became a defender and was given a two-year scholarship contract in 2013. He had a trial at Oldham Athletic in October 2015 and was given a one-year contract with the option of a second. Upon joining the \\"Latics\\", manager David Dunn said that \\"he is really athletic, only 18 and definitely one for the future\\". On 26 February 2016, he joined National League North side Chorley on a one-month youth loan. He left Boundary Park after being released by new manager John Sheridan in May 2016. On 8 July 2016, he signed a one-year contract with Walsall, with the option for a second. He had worked with youth-team coach Dean Holden at previous club Oldham. Upon signing him at Walsall, manager Jon Whitney said that \\"he‚Äôs quite old school. He just wanted to defend first and foremost, and then work on the technical side. He‚Äôs one for the future\\". Four days later he joined National League side Chester on loan until January 2017, alongside \\"Saddlers\\" teammate Liam Roberts. He made his first-team debut on 6 August, during a 3‚Äì0 defeat to Gateshead at the Gateshead International Stadium. On 16 August, he scored his first goal in senior football during a 3‚Äì2 defeat at Barrow. He missed two months of action after suffering an injury at Macclesfield Town in October. He helped the \\"Blues\\" to keep 10 clean sheets during his first 16 league appearances of the 2016‚Äì17 season and manager Jon McCarthy was keen to extend the loan deal further, which he managed to do after short time back at Walsall in January. He played a total of 32 games as the \\"Seals\\" posted a 19th-place finish in the National League, but was told by Whitney that he would not be retained upon his return to the Bescot Stadium in May 2017. He signed a one-year deal with Gateshead in July 2017 after impressing on a trial basis. On 23 September, he was sent off ten minutes into a 2‚Äì2 draw at Maidstone United following a foul on winger Zavon Hines. The \\"Heed\\" unsuccessfully appealed the decision, and manager Neil Aspin said that the decision to reject the appeal was \\"extremely disappointing\\" as \\"I‚Äôve been in football 36 years and that is one of the worst red cards I‚Äôve ever seen\\". Vassell went on to make 41 appearances for the \\"Tynesiders\\", scoring three goals, as the club posted a 17th-place finish under the stewardship of Steve Watson. Port Vale On 28 June 2018, Vassell won a move to the English Football League when he signed a one-year professional contract with EFL League Two side Port Vale, who were managed by his former Gateshead manager Neil Aspin. He made his debut in the EFL Cup on 14 August, in a 4‚Äì0 defeat to Lincoln City at Vale Park, though he entered the game as an 85th-minute substitute for Cristian Monta√±o with the \\"Valiants\\" already four goals down. He had to wait until the opening EFL Trophy group stage game of the campaign on 9 October for his next appearance, though he featured from the start in the 1‚Äì0 victory over EFL League One opponents Burton Albion and Aspin said after the game that his performance gave him cause to consider him for league fixtures. He enjoyed a run of games at left wing-back in the absence of Monta√±o, and was praised for his performances by captain Tom Pope. However new Vale manager John Askey confirmed that he would not be offering Vassell a new contract on 16 May. Macclesfield Town On 18 July 2019, Vassell joined League Two club Macclesfield Town on a one-year deal. On 1 February 2020, it was announced that he was one of three players to have left Macclesfield during the January 2020 transfer window, following a meeting with the English Football League. He followed former Macclesfield manager Sol Campbell to sign a contract with Southend United, but the deal was unable to be completed after Southend were hit with a transfer embargo. Wrexham On 27th August 2020, Vassell signed for National League club Wrexham on a one-year deal. Style of play A defender, Vassell plays primarily as a centre-back, but can also play as a full-back.

He was endowed with a Herculean strength, and he dreamt of becoming a para-commando. \\"I love the army and I wanted to become para-commando, for travel, sport and combat\\", but because of a fibula fracture, he could not become a paratrooper and he was highly disappointed. In 1982, he did became a conscript.  Crimes   Rape series  Between 1983 and 1984, Poirson committed seven rapes and assaults (sometimes under the threat of a weapon, some of his victims being strangled) in the Strasbourg region. He committed his last rape in a forest, the victim raising the license plate of the car which belonged to Poirson's lover. In January 1985, he was arrested and incarcerated. In December 1985, he was tried and sentenced to 15 years in prison. While serving his sentence in the prisons of Ensisheim and Fleury-M√©rogis, he maintained a correspondence with Chantal Vaslet, his future companion. She was a maternal assistant, 14 years older than him and with 6 girls. He was released in July 1994 after 9 years and 6 months of detention.\\"Criminal life imprisonment for the serial killer of Villeneuve-en-Chevrie -The terrifying course of the serial killer-\\" Article published on February 9, 2005 in ' Poirson then became a stonemason in the Paris region.  Kidnapping and murder series  On August 30, 1995, Poirson was drinking a glass on the terrace of a bar. He was enjoying this moment of rest, but the barking of a nearby dog prevented him from doing so, making him angry. He walked through the fields and went to the animal cemetery of Douains to avenge himself for being so bothered. He broke the window of the tool shed, grabbed one and used it to ransack the animals' graves. Jeanine Villain, 67, and her 44-year-old daughter Monique, who lived in Saint-Vincent-des-Bois, came to the grave of their dog \\"Babette\\", hearring the sounds and surprising her. Monique threatened to call the gendarmes and stood up to him. Not supporting this, he stunned Jeanine and attacked Monique, putting them in their car, a BX, and taking them to a field in Neuilly. He suggested to Monique that he could release them if they kept quiet, but she refused. He stifled Monique by putting her head in a plastic bag and broke Jeanine's neck by hitting her with a piece of wood. He went to look for a can of gasoline at La Villeneuve-en-Chevrie at the Moli√®res farm where he worked and returned to burn the bodies of the two women. Then he left with the car to walk in Paris and returned to Mantes-la-Jolie, where he abandoned and burned the car under a railway bridge, where it was later found. He walked home. The bodies of the two women were found on September 2, 1995 by passers-by. The investigators directed their suspicions on Michel Villain, 47 years old, son and half- brother of the two victims, with whom he has been scrambled for ten years. Misrepresented by his own 24-year-old son, Michel Villain was indicted and would spend three years in custody before being released after the confession of Louis Poiron.The trial of an almost ordinary man - A judicial past already charged, Fid√®s419009 \\"Three years stolen from an innocent man\\" Article by Jean-Pierre Thibaudat published on October 19, 2002 in Lib√©ration In June 1996, Louis Poirson kidnapped three 15-year-old hitch-hikers in Chaufour-l√®s- Bonni√®res and sequestrated them on the farm in La Villeneuve-en-Chevrie, but they escaped. He was arrested, tried in January 1997 and sentenced to three years in prison. He was released in July 1998. On 28 July 1998, in Douains, Poirson violated Adeline, a 20-year-old woman. Lucie Pham-Ngoc-Bich, 73 years old, resides at the retirement home A.R.E.P.A on Fr√©d√©ric Chopin street, at Val Fourr√© in Mantes-la-Jolie, she was \\"disconcerting of naivety\\" and under tutelage. On April 28, 1999, she went out for a walk in the street, as she did every day. Poirson, driving his wife's car, passed by her and offered to take her away, and she got on board. Soon after, she asked him to stop because she wanted to urinate. As soon as he could, he stopped the car on a rest area, got out of the car and brought out Lucie. He then found that she had relieved herself on her passenger seat. Furious, he pushed her violently, she fell and was stunned. He put her back in the car and took her to La Villeneuve-en- Chevrie on the farm where he worked. They quarrelled again and he strangled her, then carried the body behind the farm to the edge of the field in Chaufour-l√®s-Bonni√®res and buried it.retrait E9e de_Mantes_victime_du_tueur_en_s_E9rie.html \\"A retired Mantes victim of the serial killer\\" Article published on February 1, 2001 in ' On September 5, 1999, Charlotte Berson, 79, a widow, went for a walk in the countryside near her home in Pacy-sur-Eure, as she did every day. Poirson, driving his wife's car, passed by her, stopping, and blocking her passage. He offered to take her by car. She categorically refuses and knocked on the hood of the car to clear the passage. He feared that she had damaged the car by striking on it, became furious and pushed Charlotte violently, who fell on a stone and was knocked unconscious. He pus her in the car and took her to La Villeneuve-en-Chevrie where he strangled her. He put her back in the car and hid the naked body in a thicket at Chaussy. He poured hydrochloric acid on her face and hands in the hope of preventing any fingerprints being extracted. Charlotte's family reported her disappearance. On October 3, 1999, two hunters discovered the corpse. She was still wearing her watch on her wrist. She was identified by the serial number on the pin in the left wrist. The family recognized her watch. Investigators believed she was sequestered about two weeks before her body was abandoned, as the acid delayed the appearance of the burying beetles. The study of the bolus during the autopsy concluded that Charlotte was killed the day of her disappearance, and contradicted the observations of the entomological analysis. The morning of May 3, 2000, Cl√©mence, 38, took the train from Paris to return home to Vernon. She caught the wrong train and was forced to go down to Mantes-la-Jolie. She was upset because she had an appointment at the school where her son was attending. She went to a bus stop, to take a bus to Vernon. Poirson, driving his car, passed by and offered to take her there. But before that, he had to go to his place of work to drop the boxes that are in the trunk of the car. Arriving at the farm in La Villeneuve- en-Chevrie, he got out of the car, opened the trunk, then opened the passenger door and threatened Cl√©mence with a knife. He forced her to get out of the car, screaming. He tied her hands behind her back and dragged her into one of the farm buildings under construction. During the fight, Cl√©mence's watch fell at the foot of the stairs. He showed her to a small room on the first floor where there was only one old mattress on the floor. He gagged her, tied her tightly and left her here. He went down to work in his studio. His boss arrived, and was surprised to find the woman's watch. She went down and found Cl√©mence. She confronted Poirson and asked him what was going on. He answers that he knows that there is a woman attached to the first floor, that he is the one who took her away and that he will take her home. Panicked, he detached Cl√©mence and told him to take her home by car. The boss called him while Poirson was driving. She told him that she had warned the gendarmerie by phone. She ordered him to go after having deposited Cl√©mence at home. Arriving in Vernon, he apologized to Cl√©mence, then he returned to Bonnieres-sur-Seine to surrender to the gendarmerie. He was indicted for kidnapping and forcible confinement. He was arrested and incarcerated in Bois d'Arcy. During interrogations in custody, Poirson was very calm, and very respectful of the investigators. He recognized the facts only if the investigators submitted irrefutable evidence against him. They understood that he wanted at all costs to prevent his partner from being involved. They told him that since he had used Chantal's car several times, they could also put her in custody, so he confessed immediately. He claimed to have killed Charlotte Berson because she looked like his mother. With regard to the animal cemetery, he declared: \\"such a tralala for a dead dog\\" and that \\"the stone is expensive\\". During the search of his home the investigators discovered jewelry of women who were not his companion. He declared to have found them. Charlotte Berson's family did not recognize the jewelry. Fran√ßoise Maricourt, social counselor, recognized Lucie Pham-Ngoc-Bich's bracelet. The journalist Mich√®le Fines, reporting on a gendarmerie investigation, filmed Poirson's custody and interviewed him afterwards.. A picture of a naked woman in a wood, terrorized was found in the business of Poirson. The investigators, convinced that this is another victim, questioned him about it. He declared that he has never seen this woman and that it is a picture that he had simply found.

He was one of six Frenchmen to win the Guitar Foundation of America International competition.  Biography  Born in √âchirolles (Auvergne-Rh√¥ne- Alpes), Jouve started playing guitar at the age of 7. A student at the National School of Music in Chamb√©ry, he attended Daniel Herbelot's classes from 1987 to 1992. At the age of 10, he interpreted a concerto by Vivaldi as soloist with the Chamb√©ry Orchestra. Until 1994, he was a student at the Conservatory of Grenoble where he won the Gold Medal at 13, as well as the Prix de perfectionnement. The young Jouve then followed the private lessons of √âric Franceries, whom he considers to be one of his strongest influences. He later went to the √âcole normale de musique de Paris to perfect his skill with Alberto Ponce, with whom he continued his guitar training at the Conservatoire de Paris until 2000. Roland Dyens then became his teacher. Jouve obtained the Diploma of Higher Formation, specialty guitar of the Conservatoire in 2001. He decided to follow the class of the concertist L√°szl√≥ Hadady, solo oboist of the Ensemble Intercontemporain, and obtained his Diploma of Higher Education specialty in chamber music the following year. He was one of the rare guitarists to be received in perfection cycle, he continued his work with L√°szl√≥ Hadady until 2004. Since 2003, his career has had an international outreach: from the 40-date tour, when he won the famous Guitar Foundation of America international competition, on stages abroad, Jouve registers as a new French guitar ambassador. He performs on the greatest musical stages in the world: the Tchaikowsky Hall in Moscow, the Iserlohn Guitar Festival in Germany, the National Theatre and Concert Hall of Taipei in Taiwan, the Busan Cultural Center in South Korea, the Sha Tin Town Hall of Hong Kong, the music festival of Radio France in Montpellier, the guitar festival of Saltillo in Mexico, the concert hall of the Luis √Ångel Arango Library in Bogota (Colombia), and other venues in Germany, India, Korea, China, Vietnam, Japan, Great Britain, Spain, United States. A musician open to all styles, described as eager for musical encounters, he plays with accuracy, in a classical, contemporary repertoire, in chamber music as well as in solo music. Jouve has collaborated with numerous musicians including: * in chamber music with G√©rard Abiton, Pierre Fouchenneret, Elsa Grether, Nicolas Jouve (his brother), Christophe Morin, Roland Dyens, √âric Franceries, Mathias Duplessy, S√©bastien Droy and Prabhu Edouard.Prabhu Edouard (France Culture) * as soloist for concerto with the Taipei Symphony Orchestra and the State Academic Symphony Orchestra of the Russian Federation in Moscow. He also performed with the Orchestre de l'Op√©ra national de Paris, the Orchestre de l'Op√©ra national de Lyon, the Sinfonietta ensemble and the Orchestre national d'√éle-de-France. Very committed, he collaborates closely with Mathias Duplessy for the composition of certain pieces for solo guitar. Notably during his last album Cavalcade, which received good media reviews. His interpretation of Britten's Nocturnal is a reference, as is his interpretation of the work for solo guitar by Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo. Since his first solo album in 2004, he has recorded five albums, two of which are dedicated to the solo guitar work of composer Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo. The Traveling Sonata album, in duet with the flautist Viviana Guzm√°n brought him a nomination to the Grammy Awards.

Millet committed suicide after being chased down by the police for his third crime on November 19, 2007.  Biography  The only child of an abusive household - he is mostly neglected by his mother, and beaten by his alcoholic father.Didier Fabre, The bloody trajectory of Albert Millet, the other Pierrot the madman , Presses du Midi, October 2011 He drops out of school at the age of 14.\\"Albert Millet, murderer until his last day\\" Article by Timoth√©e Boutry published November 21, 2007 in Le Parisien It is assumed that he knew very well the area surrounding Hy√®res, and was familiar with the ruined castle overlooking the city, and the close by maquis, as he would try to hide there after committing his murders. While serving in Tataouine, Tunisia, he became a marksman and developed an interest for firearms. Prior to the murders he commits several other crimes: * in 1947, he commits theft twice and is sentenced to one month in prison for both cases; * in 1948, he commits two more thefts and is sentenced again; * in 1950, yet again he becomes involved in theft, but also violence against a gendarme and the possession of a firearm. On June 5, 1951, he tries to shoot an Algerian man and is arrested by the police in the maquis where he was hiding with a rifle.  First murder   Timeline  1954 ‚Äî Millet meets 15-year-old Paulette Dogliotti in a ballroom in Hy√®res and falls in love with her. Paulette is a servant, and is being brought up by her aunt, √âlisa Maggiorana. Paulette would carry out litter in a metal bin every night to put it on the sidewalk for collection, so Millet started meeting with the girl by waiting for her in front of her employer's house. √âlisa (Paulette's aunt) did not approve of their nightly meetings, because of Millet's reputation, in particular his passion for firearms and his convictions. She also considered Paulette to be too young for the relationship. √âlisa forbids them from meeting again, and Paulette complies with her aunt's decision. March 1954 ‚Äî √âlisa is drinking in a bar in Hy√®res with her fianc√©, when Millet enters the bar, and approaches her to start a conversation. The conversation escalates, and √âlisa slaps Millet in front of a crowd of patrons, her fianc√© throws Millet out of the bar and while being thrown out Millet issues death threats against √âlisa and Paulette. March 28, 1954 ‚Äî Paulette takes out the trash as usual, Millet, who was waiting for her, approaches her, pulls out a gun and shoots at her. She miraculously comes out of the incident unscathed by using the metal bin she was carrying as a shield. Millet runs away and hides in the maquis, √âlisa files a complaint against him. April 3, 1954 ‚Äî at around 17:00, √âlisa Maggiorana is sitting at the bus stop in front of the Aux Dames de France store. Millet crosses the street, walks up to her and shoots her in the head. She dies instantly. He runs away and hides in the maquis again, gaining his nickname \\"The Boar of the Moors\\" (a maquis is a common habitat for boars in the region). The police recognises him the next day at the station where he shot √âlisa. He is shot three times in the head, survives and falls into a coma.  Trial, conviction and incarceration  The trial of Albert Millet began at the cour d'assises in the VAR department, in Draguignan on September 30, 1955. The defense of Millet was provided by Master Aym√© Perrimond. Millet recognized the facts, but denied premeditation. He claimed to have shot intentionally at the bin to scare Paulette and argued that, as a former army marksman, if his target was Paulette, he would not have missed. Regarding √âlisa, he claimed that he approached her to ask her to come with him to the police station to withdraw her complaint, but got scared when she started screaming as soon as she saw him and shot her. Millet was sentenced to death. He was incarcerated at the Baumettes Prison in Marseille. He appealed, the Court of Cassation canceled his sentence of death due to a vice de forme . In 1956, another trial was held at the cour d'assises of the Alpes-Maritimes department, in Nice. Albert Millet's sentence was changed to penal labor for life. He was then incarcerated in the Fresnes prison, then the Ch√¢teau-Thierry Prison, and finally the Clairvaux Prison, all prisons known for their harsh conditions. During his detention he behaved like a model prisoner. On July 12, 1968, his sentence was commuted again, this time to 20 years of imprisonment. While incarcerated he maintained a correspondence with the wife of one of his friends, Fernande \\"Nande\\" Valentin. She was a caregiver at San Salvadour Hospital. She visited him in the prison parlor several times. They began a relationship after Fernande divoced her husband.  Freedom and second murder   Timeline  July 10, 1973 ‚Äî Albert Millet receives parole. August 1973 ‚Äî He marries Fernande, and moves to 5th de la Croix Street in Hy√®res. He calls Fernande \\"a saint\\". He only touches guns when he goes hunting. The newly-weds seem happy together. Fernande takes good care of their household. Millet does not have a job, but does undeclared gardening work. Every month, respecting his obligations he goes to the police station to sign his residence permit. In the evening, after her work at the hospital, Fernande takes on housekeeping jobs to keep their couple afloat. Over the years, Millet becomes possessive, suspicious, spies on Fernande and suspects her of having an affair, while she complains about his sexual needs, saying that they are excessive, preventing her from getting proper sleep. June 12, 1979 ‚Äî Fernande tells Millet that she wants him to sleep on the couch. An argument breaks out between the couple, it escalates until Fernande finally tells her husband that she does not want to take care of a man who does nothing anymore and announces that she wants a divorce. As she does not want him to find himself destitute after the separation, she signs him a check for 20,000 francs. Millet feels humiliated. June 13, 1979 ‚Äî at approximately 05:00 Millet stabs Fernande with a dagger several times, he hits her heart twice. He then barricades himself inside the house and gets drunk. A little after 9:00, he starts firing a gun through the window of his room. The house is quickly surrounded by police. He throws objects out the window, and confesses to his crime to the police, shouting \\"I killed a saint\\", and saying that he wants to commit suicide. After about four hours of negotiations with friends and a priest, Millet finally surrendered to the police. In custody, Millet declared that after killing his wife, he decided to commit suicide in the maquis , so he took his doberman on a walk, but changed his mind on the way and hit the dog, who ran away. He also asked to speak to the Commissioner, whose office was on the second floor, and tried to commit suicide by jumping from the landing into the police station's stairwell. The police caught him in flight on the first floor. As part of the investigation, the police requested Fernande's locker at the hospital to be opened, and found drafts of a letter addressed a lover, suggesting that Millet might have been suspecting his wife of cheating on him. The corpse of a Doberman was discovered by a shepherd in a well with a stone around its neck. The shepherd hid his discovery for a few days, recognising the dog, for fear of Millet.  Trial, conviction and incarceration  On May 11, 1981, Albert Millet's trial began at the cour d'assises of Var in Draguignan. Fernande's family claimed that it was not logical for the bitch to run away - she would have taken refuge at home, and she would have defended her mistress if she had seen Millet hurt her. They were convinced that the defendant killed the dog before, and therefore that he had premeditated the murder of Fernande and that the crime was therefore an assassination. Millet, who plead guilty to the crime of passion, was sentenced to life imprisonment, the jury having not retained the premeditation. He again was a model inmate. His sentence was finally commuted to 22 years of imprisonment. He did not benefit from any psychological support. He worked during his detention, and was saving about 300 000 francs at the time. He also enjoyed exit permits, during which he stayed in a room of a small hotel in Nice. In June 2001, during his fourth leave, he met a woman named Gis√®le on the terrace of a caf√©. He confessed to her all his criminal career. She told him that she only has a disability pension as income, that she spent it at the casino and that she was in debt. She invited him to spend the night, at 3rd avenue du Patrimoine, in the small two-room apartment that she owned.  Release  In December 2001, Albert Millet was released on parole. He then left to live in Gis√®le's apartment. According to her, he had great sexual needs, which she appreciated at first. He also did the housework. He gave her many gifts (jewelry, clothes, etc.), and large sums of money. Millet's probation officer worried about the speed with which his savings were disappearing and feared he was being scammed. Millet replied that he was fully aware of this and that he was quite willing. Millet contacted Master Thierry Perrimond, the son of his first lawyer, Aym√© Perrimond, who died during his detention. Millet entrusted his personal fortune (louis d'or, watches, jewels, etc.) to his lawyer, who placed it in the vault of a bank in Toulon. After a small fright due to the opening of a bad locker, Master Thierry Perrimond restored his property. Gis√®le quickly found Millet to be possessive and she felt watched by him. She told in a letter that he must leave home, and that their relationship will end on February 15, 2002. Millet tried to coax her by saying that he had hidden a treasure in the maquis near Hy√®res, including between other twelve gold bars. He offered to give her most of it, in exchange for staying with him. She asked to see this treasure before giving an answer. On February 12, 2002, they went by train to Hy√®res. Millet had bought an ice axe. A taxi dropped them at the Fenouillet road, in a deserted place that Millet said is the one where he hid his treasure. He began to scratch the ground behind the rocks with his ice axe. Gis√®le realized that he can easily kill her discreetly here and panicked, returning to the road and stopping the first car. The driver took Albert and Gis√®le to the station from where they left for Nice, where she abandoned Millet. On February 13, 2002, Millet recontacted Gis√®le and offered her 10,000 francs to return to live with him. She accepted, but on February 17, 2002, she told him to leave permanently. He still spent the night at home. In the early morning of February 18, 2002, Gis√®le was in bed when Millet hit her with a kitchen knife. They fought and she was cut under the chin. Millet tried to rescue her, but she told him to leave, which he did. She called an ambulance which took her to the Saint Roch hospital. Her injury was not serious. Millet soon went to the hospital to check on Gis√®le, then surrendered himself to his probation officer. He said he never intended to kill Gis√®le.  Trial, conviction and incarceration  The trial of Albert Millet for the attempted murder on Gisele took place in the tribunal correctionnel. The defense of Millet was provided by Master Mireille Damiano, Master Sandrine Setton being the lawyer of Gis√®le. Millet was sentenced to seven years in prison, but appealed his conviction. At the trial on appeal, his conviction was confirmed.  Release, last murder and suicide  In August 2007, Albert Millet was released.¬´Hy√®res: Albert Millet commits suicide after one last murderous madness¬ª Article published on November 20, 2007 in Nice-Matin He had 30,000 euros in savings. He moved to room 4 of the Hotel du Soleil in Hy√®res. He met his neighbor Chantal, who lives at 1st Neuve Street. He saw her from the window of her hotel room. Chantal was depressed and had financial worries. He eventually moved to her home and paid a portion of the rent. He gives her presents and invited her to eat at a restaurant. But Millet was upset, because Chantal had a friend who came almost every day to their apartment, Christian Fernandez, 41-years-old. She offered him an aperitif and the meal while it is Millet who financed. They argued about it. Millet went back to his room at the hotel and decided that Chantal must repay some of his money, several thousand euros. On November 18, 2007, Millet spent the night at Chantal's house and insisted that they be alone. Chantal refused and invited Christian. Millet went to bed but got up to complain about the noise, which was reclined several times in a row. On November 19, 2007, at 3:00 am, Millet got up and went down to the first floor. Christian invited him to have a drink with them. Millet, insulted, left the house saying that he would come back armed. Christian, however, did not take his threat seriously. A little later, Millet knocked on the door of the house and calmly asked to enter. Chantal opened the door, and Millet bursted in, shooting her in the thigh. Christian intervened, but was shoot three times and died on the spot. Millet fled and hid in the bush. But the \\"Boar of the Moors\\" had aged and could no longer evade the gendarmes. At around 4:45 pm, in the climb of Noailles, Millet saw the policemen and committed suicide by shooting himself in the head.

After the introduction of Chan Buddhism from China to Japan in the Song dynasty (960-1279), the architectural style of Song dynasty have a profound influence on Japan traditional cultural and folk customs. The oldest things in the temple is the Main Hall, which was built in the early Song dynasty (960-1279). History Song dynasty Hualin Temple was first built with the name of \\"Yueshan Jixiang Chan Temple\\" () in 964 by the then provincial governor of Fuzhou Bao Xiurang (), under the kingdom of Wuyue in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms (907-960). During the reign of Emperor Gaozong (1127-1162), he inscribed the name on a plaque to the name. In the Song and Ming dynasties, the temple is renowned for its quiet and beautiful environment, which attracted many literati to come and compose poems to eulogize the temple, including Li Gang, Zhang Jun, Wang Yingshan, and Xie Zhaozhi. Ming dynasty In 1444, in the ruling of Emperor Yingzong in the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), the emperor inscribed and honored the name \\"Hualin Temple\\" (), which is still in use now. Qing dynasty In 1644, the year of the founding of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), Hualin Temple was renovated by monks. In 1668, in the ruling of Kangxi Emperor (1662-1722), it was refurbished again. The temple became dilapidated due to neglect in the Yongzheng era (1723-1735). It was enlarged in the Jiaqing (1796-1820) and Daoguang periods (1821-1850). Lin Zexu, a notable official in the Qing court, wrote an article about the reconstruction project. People's Republic of China After the establishment of the Communist State in 1953, Hualin Temple was designated as a provincial level cultural heritage by the Fujian Provincial Government. In 1966, Mao Zedong launched the ten-year Cultural Revolution, the Shanmen, Hall of Four Heavenly Kings, corridors and walls were demolished by the Red Guards with only the Main Hall remaining. On 23 February 1982, the Main Hall of Hualin Temple was listed among the second batch of \\"Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Fujian\\" by the State Council of China. Hualin Temple was officially reopened to the public in the Chinese New Year of 1990. Architecture Main Hall The Main Hall in the temple has single-eave gable and hip roof covered with black tiles, which represented water then and could extinguish fire. It still preserves the architectural style of the early Song dynasty. The Main Hall is high, three rooms wide, four rooms deep and covers an area of . It is rectangular in shape with eight purlins and four pillars. It is the earliest wooden architecture in Jiangnan.

Some of the mines were cleared following the successful British operation to retake the islands but following a series of accidents demining operations ceased. In the intervening years the mine fields were fenced off and, with human access limited, became havens for Falklands flora and the native penguin population. The British government ratified the Ottawa Treaty in 1998 that required the removal of all mines within its territory. Demining operations restarted in 2009, though owing to the climate and local conditions much of the work must be done by hand and completion is not expected until 2020.  Background  Argentinian FMK-3 anti-tank mine (bottom right) Argentinian forces invaded the Falkland Islands, a British overseas territory located in the South Atlantic, in April 1982. British forces retook the islands by 14 June in the Falklands War. One of the first actions taken by the Argentinians was to lay mine fields to assist in the defence of the islands. Despite rumours that land mines were scattered randomly by helicopter the majority of the mine field seem to have been laid in a professional manner and the locations of mines recorded. Approximately 30,000 land mines ‚Äì of which there were at least 20,000 anti-personnel mines and 5,000 anti-tank devices ‚Äì were laid in 146 separate mine fields. These are largely around the settlements of Stanley, Port Howard, Fox Bay and Goose Green. The Italian-made SB-33 mine was widely used but mines of Argentinian (FMK-1 and FMK-3 mines), Spanish (C-3-B and PB4 mines), American (M1 mines) and Israeli (No. 4 and No. 6 mines) manufacture were also laid, including hard-to-detect plastic models. As many as nine different types of land mine were laid. One of the most heavily mined areas was Surf Beach, located just to the north of the capital Stanley, where 1,000 mines were laid just to the rear of the beach. Much of Stanley Common, a public access area, was also mined and subsequently remained out of use for many years. In addition one abandoned building, located near the Murrell Peninsula minefield, is suspected of being booby-trapped and is fenced off. Initial demining efforts were made in the weeks following the British victory by British and Argentinian engineers. The mine fields around Goose Green, site of a major engagement in the war, were cleared by the end of 1982. Accidents resulted in six deaths or serious injuries amongst the demining teams and, with many of the mine fields located in non-essential areas, the demining operation was halted as the small benefit gained was not considered to be worth the risk. Magellanic and gentoo penguins on the Falklands Many of the mines laid are well preserved and remain active and dangerous. Around 80% of mines are in sandy or peat areas and so are easily hidden or moved making removal difficult. The mine fields are signed and fenced to warn visitors and no civilian has ever been wounded by a land mine. As human access has been prevented to these areas they have become de facto nature reserves, popular with Magellanic and gentoo penguins who are not heavy enough to trigger the mines. Native flora is also doing well in the mine fields. The Falklands has a small number of mines compared to other affected areas such as Kuwait, which is of similar size but has 5 million mines. The UK has stated that the socio-economic impact of the land mines on the Falklands is negligible.  Demining  Minefield, fence and signage at Port William The United Kingdom ratified the Ottawa Treaty that prohibits manufacture and use of land mines on 31 July 1998. The treaty required that the UK clear all land mines from its territories by 1 March 2009. The deadline was subsequently amended by agreement to 1 March 2019 and then to 1 June 2021; this was at the request of the British government owing to the high cost and slow outputs of clearance work. Many of the Falkland Islanders opposed the demining operation. They stated that as the mine fields were clearly marked and there was little demand for the land it would be more cost effective and better for the environment for the mines to remain. There are fears that opening up mine fields to tourists and farmers will lead to habitat destruction. However the British government, bound by the terms of the treaty, commenced demining operations in 2009. The demining operation is funded by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office.  Methodology At the start of the 2009 demining operation there were approximately 20,000 land mines remaining on the islands. Owing to the climate, ground conditions and detectability most of the clearance is carried out by specialist civilian deminers manually prodding the ground. The SB-33 mine in particular is described as \\"almost impossible to detect by any means\\". In some instances remote controlled mine flails are used to verify that areas are clear of mines, as at Goose Green where manual verification proved difficult. Windy weather prevents the use of mine- detecting rats as has been trialled successfully in Mozambique and Tanzania. Recovered mines are made safe or else disposed of by controlled explosion or burning in small batches. The manual clearing processes commenced in 2009 with two companies, Dynasafe-Bactec and CKS (later known as Fenix Insight), carrying out the work. Later only Dynasafe-Bactec have been carrying out clearing works. More than 100 demining team members, largely Zimbabwean, have been involved in the operation, each working for six-hour days in which they can clear around 5 linear metres of a mine field. They work from Argentinian mine-laying records and maps created by the British Army's Royal Engineers after the war. The Argentinian records are generally good but in some instances are not entirely reliable, being made at a time of great activity on the Falklands and having been translated from Spanish. Records for mine fields on West Falkland are patchier and many require additional intensive surveys to determine the extent and density of mines. Once a mine field has been cleared and proven the warning signs are removed and in most cases the fences are pulled down; the land is restored, as near as possible, to its previous condition. One area that has proved difficult to clear is Yorke Bay where sand dunes have progressed across the mine field, shifting mines or burying them deeply. This area may require large scale excavation and sifting with armoured machinery. As there will be extensive habitat disruption it is planned to carry out this work during winter when the penguins are at sea. Inspired by the work in the Falklands, Imperial College London has developed a machine to assist demining operations in peat soil environments. The O-Revealer uses a set of electrical heating coils to burn off the top layer of peat by smouldering. The machine works on plastic and metal mines, though in dry and windy conditions it could potentially detonate SB-33 mines. The machine has not yet been trialled on the Falklands, but could see use in similar environments in Vietnam, Burma, Laos, Uganda, Zimbabwe and the former Yugoslavia.  Progress  Mine field road sign near Stanley, East Falkland Early operations were largely focused on the mine fields closest to Stanley, many of which were on public-access recreation land. By 2016 the teams had cleared 30 mine fields, removing 4,000 anti-personnel and 1,000 anti-tank mines and releasing 7 million square metres of previously inaccessible land. During this year all mine fields adjacent to main roads, at risk from errant vehicles, had been cleared. During the 2016/17 season, seven teams cleared 3,000 anti-personnel and 150 anti-tank mines from 47 mine fields. By this time 70% of all known land mines had been removed. In the same year the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence committed a further ¬£20 million of funding for future clearance works, the works had cost ¬£16 million up to that point. One of the demining operatives was injured by an explosion on 27 February 2017 after hitting the side of a mine with a tool. He avoided serious injury, only requiring stitches to his hand and a finger. In February 2018 Goose Green became the first settlement on the islands to be fully cleared of mines. As of 2018 some 35 areas remain to be cleared. These comprised 27 known mine fields (997,930 square metres total) and 8 areas suspected to be mined but where an additional technical survey was required (163,460 square metres). The expected completion date for demining operations was March 2020, though this was later extended to December 2020.

He was sentenced on April 16, 2015 to the highest sentence of the French Penal Code for a series of four murders that occurred from November 2011 to April 2012 within a radius of five kilometers in the north-east of the department of the Essonne.  Biography   Before the murders  Until 2005 Yoni Palmier lived with his parents in a seven- storey bar in Ris-Orangis. Before this he had already been sentenced six times, the most serious of which was eight months in prison for aggravated violence against his mother, whom he had stabbed, and for carrying a prohibited weapon.  Murders  On November 27, 2011, Nathalie Davids, a 35 year old laboratory employee, was found by a neighbor injured in her parking lot at 4th Pasteur Street in Juvisy-sur-Orge She died a few hours later at the hospital. Nathalie Davids had seven bullet wounds, including one in her head. A week later, her former companion, Michel Courtois, was arrested. He recognized the facts before retracting. He was indicted and placed in custody at the Fleury-M√©rogis prison. On February 22, 2012, Jean-Yves Bonnerue, a technical executive aged 52 and the person who had discovered Nathalie's body, was shot in the back of the head while he was cleaning the trunk of his car in the same car park. The two victims knew each other, they were neighbors and belonged to the same union council of co-ownership. It was he who would gave indications to the policemen so that they could trace of the former companion of Nathalie. On March 17, 2012, in Ris-Orangis, Marcel Brunetto, an 81-year- old bank retiree, was shot in the neck in the lobby of his apartment block located at 48th Pierre-Brossolette Street. On April 5, 2012, in Grigny, Nadjia Lahsene, 48 years old, was killed when she entered the lobby of her building at 1st Ravin Street. The killer shot her three times in the head. This woman, of Algerian origin, lived alone with her 18-year-old son since the death of her husband. She worked at Orly Airport.  Investigation  Each time, the murder weapon was a 7.65 mm semi-automatic pistol, which, the authorities, supported the thesis of an isolated killer. The weapon used to murder the 47-year-old mother in Grigny, is the same as that with which were killed the other three people in the same area of Essonne in November, February and March. A hundred investigators were mobilized to try and unravel the mystery of the series of four crimes committed in less than five months in the department. The judicial police launched, when on Friday, April 6, 2012 in the evening, a witness called. She wanted to find the trace, in \\"the west of Paris\\", of a blue and white Suzuki motorcycle type GSX-R 750, a model of the year 2001 or 2002. The machine had a white rear wheel well, a back cover and the seat was also covered in white. Two lights were embedded in the wheel arch and the muffler was black. This bike would have served the serial killer to escape. On April 16, 2012, Yoni Palmier was arrested. On his indications, the weapon was found in a box in Draveil.\\"Murder in Essonne: the mysteries of the alleged serial killer\\", 18 April 2012, Le Parisien On April 27, 2012, Yoni Palmier was initially indicted for three murders, mainly because of the following elements: * Yoni Palmier's DNA was the only one present on the weapon used. * Palmier rented a box in the parking lot of the building where Nathalie Davids was killed on the 27th and Jean-Yves Bonnerue on the 22nd in Juvisy-sur-Orge. * Yoni Palmier lived until 2005 on Pierre-Brossolette Street in Ris-Orangis, close to the scene of the murder of Marcel Brunetto, * The Grigny building in which Nadjia Lahc√®ne was shot is less than 800 metres from a box rented by Palmier in Viry-Ch√¢tillon, where a Suzuki GSX-R motorcycle, a scooter, a helmet and a jacket were found. This two-wheeled and these clothes corresponding to those of the killer of Essonne, according to several witnesses.Patricia Tourancheau, Essonne: \\"the crimes of opportunity\\" of an alleged death-sower, 20 April 2012, Lib√©rationPatricia Tourancheau, The alleged killer of Essonne nut, 16 April 2012, Lib√©rationJulien Balboni, Essonne: \\"He was unable to ride a bike!

His only ex-mistress, Valerie, talked about violent sexual acts that made her bleed. She left him because she suspected he was homosexual. Palmier then went on to have a short homosexual relationship with a neighbor. During the trial, Palmier expressed himself in a very confused way. He recognized himself as the culprit of the first murder, that of Nathalie Davids. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a 22-year lock-in period, the maximum penalty provided by the Penal Code. The court also issued a security detention, a rare provision that came into effect in 2008, allowing the release of a convicted person to be re-evaluated each year after his sentence has been served. It is, in theory, the heaviest sentence to be pronounced under the Penal Code. = Court of Appeal = The trial on appeal began on March 14, 2017.

Career In 1656 Ralph Cudworth recommended him to secretary John Thurloe as resident chaplain at Lisbon, and he held the post for several years.THURLOE, Papers v. 522; Cal.

Although allied with the federal Nationalist Party, it had different origins in state politics. It sought to combine the state's Liberal Party with the Country Party but the latter soon withdrew. In 1923 the party sought a further unification with the Country Party but only attracted a few recruits. Then in 1925 it merged with the Country Party, initially as the Country Progressive Party with a few members left out and then they were absorbed into the renamed Country and Progressive National Party. History As early as January 1916 the various groups opposed to the state Labor government began exploring forming an umbrella extra-parliamentary organisation to co-ordinate activities. On 29 March that year the formation of the National Political Council was announced. At the end of May the Queensland Farmers' Union, sponsors of the Country Party, agreed to affiliate. In Queensland the Australian Labor Party split of 1916 had only a minor impact with Premier T. J. Ryan working hard to successfully keep the party together in the state with only limited losses. Instead the focus remained entirely on the multiple opposition groups. By the end of the year there were growing demands for the formation of a dedicated party on the same lines. Calls grew following the 1917 federal election and on 16 June 1917 a joint conference of delegates from the state Liberal Association and the federal National Federation called for unity as the \\"National Party\\". On 6 July the first meeting of the National Party was held. The sitting Liberal leader, James Tolmie, became the leader of the new party. At the National Political Council's annual meeting in August a resolution was passed calling for all its affiliates to work together as a National party. In the run-up to the 1918 state election the Country Party joined under the National Party banner. Before the election Tolmie stood down due to illness and was succeeded by Edward Macartney. The election was a disappointment, with the National Party winning four fewer seats than its predecessors combined. In the state parliament the party held together for the time being, but there was much disruption amongst the extra-parliamentary forces, starting when the Queensland Farmers' Union withdrew from the National Political Council. Macartney also left the National Political Council and formed the more hardline Australian Democratic Union, which soon overcame its rival and the following the year the two merged as the National Democratic Council. A separate party, the Northern Country Party, also emerged as a regional division with the Nationalists. Suffering ill health, Macartney stood down in 1920 to be succeeded by William Vowles. After six months, Vowles led the majority of National MLAs into a reformed Country Party. Walter Barnes, the deputy leader, became the new leader. The National Party, Country Party, Northern Country Party and National Labor Party all co-operated in the 1920 state election but were unable to dislodge Labor. In June 1921 Charles Taylor succeeded Barnes as leader. Another attempt at unity was made and in January 1923 a convention was held which changed the name to the Queensland United Party, but only four sitting Country MLAs and two of the Northern Country MLAs joined. The leadership was offered to various figures including First World War officer and federal Senator Major General Sir William Glasgow and William Green, the leader of the Northern Country Party, but ultimately Taylor was retained. Further efforts were made in April 1924 when the United and Country parliamentary parties agreed to form a joint Opposition, headed by Arthur Edward Moore. Taylor resigned as leader at the end of the year, to be succeeded by Reginald King. In May 1925 the bulk of the party merged with the Country Party to form the Country Progressive Party; but four United MLAs (Taylor, Walter Barnes, George Barnes and William Kelso) were excluded from the merger due to their standing opposition to arrangements for joint fundraising for the parties. They opted to carry on as a rump United Party. However the successful co-operation of the federal Nationalist-Country Coalition in the 1925 federal election renewed interest in a merger and the following month the rump merged in, having secured a party name change to Country and Progressive National Party. The party also contested Brisbane City Council, with William Jolly becoming the first Lord Mayor of Brisbane at the elections when the city was expanded in 1925. Following the state merger, the Brisbane City party continued to contest elections as the Nationalist Civic Party. Jolly was briefly followed by Archibald Watson but following the latter's defeat in the 1931 election the party subsequently merged into the Citizens' Municipal Organisation. Leaders {  - ! Leader !

Hecox House, also known as the House of the Seven Gables, is a single-family home located at 3720 West Grand River Avenue near Howell, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. It is a rare example of Second Empire architecture in the region. History Very little is known of Frank J. Hecox and his wife Ada save that they were farmers. In 1886, the couple bought the 76-acre farm that this house is located on. It is likely that the farm at the time had a house located at the site of the present house. In 1887, Hecox constructed this new house. It is also unknown how long the Hecoxes live on the farm, although it is likely they remained until the latter part of the 1890s. Certainly by 1900 the farm was being rented, and in 1907 Ada Hecox, then living in San Jose, California, sold the farm. The farm remained a rental property until 1922, when it was purchased by Fred A. and Cora A. Smith. Fred and Cora Smith died in the 1950s, and the farm was passed to their family, eventually being sold in the early 1970s. The house was once again turned into a rental property, and was used by the Camelot Exploration Company, an oil company, as offices. In 1982 it was purchased and restored by a private owner. Description The Frank J. Hecox House is a two-story brick Second Empire house on a raised basement. It has a metal-clad mansard roof with seven gables, one in the front and three on each side.

The championship was won for the fifth time by Paraguayan driver Gustavo Saba. Saba only won the Rally de San Juan but with three second places that was enough for Saba to defeat Argentine driver Marcos Ligato by less than six points despite winning three rallies.

Prelude  Ikarus was a bus manufacturer based in Budapest and Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, Hungary, established in 1895. Ikarus later became a prominent factory in Hungary and was able to dominate most of the Eastern Bloc countries' markets. In 2003, due to numerous financial struggles and a change in ownership, the company was shut down. Ikarus was outlived by one of its subsidiaries called Ikarus EAG, but it was also shut down in 2007 by the then parent company Irisbus. The last chairman of the main company Ikarus, was called G√°bor Sz√©les. Under his leadership, Ikarus was sold to Irisbus. Sz√©les, a successful businessman and close partner of the Hungarian government increased his wealth while the company slid towards bankruptcy. In 1998, Sz√©les bought some of the shares from the Hungarian state and in return promised to provide work for the companies' employment for the next ten years or otherwise he'll have to pay back hundreds of millions of forints to the state. Since 2003, Sz√©les has constantly tried reviving the Hungarian bus manufacturing, without any major success.  Hungarian Bus Kft.  After only two months since the shut down of Ikarus in 2003, Sz√©les established a new company called Hungarian Bus Kft. and promised to start producing new vehicles. Yet the production did not start until 2007. In this company 50% share belonged to Sz√©les' other company called M≈±szertechnika Holding Rt. The latter managed to buy back the factory in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r and the rights to produce buses from Irisbus, but not the brand. The \\"new\\" vehicle was heavily based on the Ikarus C56 model, which was basically an Ikarus 256 and therefore 30 years old construction with modern design. The model was called IK HB 122L, in which \\"IK\\" refers to \\"Ikarus\\". It was Sz√©les' way to bypass the agreement with Irisbus. After all, Hungarian Bus only managed to build five units and in 2007 it already ceased to exist. Sz√©les has been widely critisied for only creating the company to avoid paying back an enormous amount of money to the state as compensation for his unfulfilled promise.  Magyar Aut√≥buszgy√°rt√≥ Kft.   Auto Rad Controlle Kft.  The Auto Rad Controlle Kft. or ARC, was originally established in 1989 and was serving as one of the many suppliers of Ikarus. Later on, they started to repair autobuses and in 2005 they developed and produced their first vehicle the ARC 187, an 18,75 metres long 5-doored, articulated bus. The company soon released two other models, the ARC 127 and 134, as well.  Sz√©les and his proposal  The first unit of the Sz√©les-ARC agreement, an Ikarus V187. In 2010, Sz√©les, who by this time managed to license the Ikarus brand from Irisbus, proposed a deal to ARC, which consisted of the following: the M≈±szertechnika Holding Rt. and Auto Rad Controlle creates a new company called Magyar Aut√≥buszgy√°rt√≥ Kft. (eng.: Hungarian Autobus Manufacturer Ltd.). The former gives the Ikarus name for the vehicles and provides orders from Hungarian and Russian customers, while the latter builds the units. The \\"new\\" modells were produced without any modification, but the changing of ARC logo to Ikarus. However, they did receive new modell names on the following patern: ARC 187 became Ikarus V187, where V stands for V√°rosi (eng.: City). Still in 2010 a trolleybus prototype, called ARC-SZKT Tr187, was created from an earlier agreement disclosed by ARC. This vehicle was co-constructed by the Szegedi K√∂zleked√©si T√°rsas√°g and was essentially the articulated trolleybus version of the Ikarus V187. Later a total number of 13 vehicles were delivered to the SZKT. These units were the first facelifted units of the Ikarus-ARC cooperation. The modell also received a new name: Ikarus-≈†koda Tr187.2, as the electrical systems were provided by the Czech manufacturer. The new design, which was later adopted by the autobuses as well, was created by J√°nos T√≥th, a former designer of the NABI. One of BKV's Ikarus V127 V2s, with the facelifted design. In 2013, a series of 18 units of the Ikarus V127 V2 modell was ordered by BKV Zrt. in PKD construction, meaning that ARC-Ikarus only produced the major parts of these vehicles, while the operating company had to finish them. Later 50 more units were ordered by BKV in 2014.  Departure from Sz√©les  In 2014, Auto Rad Controlle decided to break the agreement with G√°bor Sz√©les, because he failed to provide them with the promised orders and the company came close to closing down.  MABI-Bus Kft.   Lanta Consulting Kft.  The Lanta is a small company, which's main area of expertise and works are restoring older Ikarus modells. This manufacturer managed to buy back the rights to build the modells of Ikarus EAG and to use the brand from Irisbus.  Evopro Holding Zrt.  A Modulo C68e in Budapest. Evopro is in the hands of Csaba M√©sz√°ros and was producing a variety of products, including small, Electric buses with composit, modular build, under the model name Modulo Medio Electric 20 of these vehicles were sold, after renaming the modell to Modulo C68e, to the BKV in 2014, but they proved to be severely unreliable by 2016. After 75% of them were constantly incapable of leaving the garage and 100% were useless during winter time, BKV even decided to dispose one of them in 2018.  MABI-Bus Kft.  In 2015, the Evopro Holding bought the earlier closed down Hungarian plant of NABI and then with Auto Rad Controlle and Lanta Consulting established a new company called MABI-Bus Kft. At this point, the new company could have produced: * E-series Ikarus buses, since Lanta had the rights of Ikarus EAG. * NABI Sirius buses, because Evopro had the rights for these. * the Ikarus V187/V127 models without the Ikarus brand, because Sz√©les only provided the brand name, while the vehicles were developed by ARC. A working prototype of the Modulo M168d model However MABI decided not to use the Ikarus brand on its vehicles, yet later the company was renamed to Ikarus Egyedi Kft. Ever since there is a constant litigation between M√©sz√°ros' Ikarus Egyedi and Sz√©les' M≈±szertechnika Holding which still licenses the original parent company's Ikarus name. In 2016, more than 50% of the company's shares were bought by the Austrian VIECAP Gmbh. In 2018, after failing to produce 180 units of the Modulo M168d modell (the successors of Ikarus V187), the company got dangerously close to bankruptcy. The limited number of vehicles that were delivered to BKV on the other hand, were all suffering from serious design flaws and differed from the construction that was ordered. These proved to be incapable to serve in traffic. On the 9th of July, Csaba M√©sz√°ros, chairman of the Ikarus Egyedi Kft. asked for bankruptcy protection from the government, as the company became insolvent and production was ceased.  Ikarus Global Zrt.  In 2017, Sz√©les started to promote his new company, called Ikarus Global Zrt., which was to produce new, LNG heavily based on Ikarus V127 model. Even though the rights to produce those vehicles remain with Auto Rad Controlle. However, no such or any vehicle was produced by the company as of June 2018.

About  Lara Porzak works predominantly with black & white film and is acclaimed for using labour-intensive, non-digital photographic methods, often utilizing vintage cameras and lenses from the late 1800s to create her photographs. According to The Los Angeles Times, \\"Her photojournalistic style combines with the romantic influences of European photographers from the 1930s and ‚Äò40s to give her work a timeless quality with a strong sense of narrative.\\" Porzak is \\"a real-deal fine art photographer\\" who has produced over 20 fine art photography shows and her work is part of the Getty museum's California Artist's Collection. The quality of her handmade photographs, using the gelatin silver process and tintypes has attracted many collectors throughout the world, as C Magazine so eloquently writes \\"If a picture is worth a thousand words, no doubt a Lara Porzak image is worth a great deal more.\\" Her photographs have also appeared on many television shows & movies. Porzak started her own photography business in the late 1990s as a fine art wedding photographer with a photojournalistic style, and her talent for disappearing into her subjects soon elevated her to the top of her field; travelling the globe, capturing weddings with her artistic aesthetic. Porzak has photographed the weddings of (to only name a few, in alphabetical order): Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore, Kevin Costner, Ellen DeGeneres, Mariska Hargitay, Heidi Klum, Adam Sandler, Brooke Shields, Channing Tatum and Reese Witherspoon. When asked about her wedding photography in a magazine interview Porzak is quoted as saying, ‚Äúmy interest in photography isn‚Äôt just so people can remember what happened, but so they can remember how they felt.‚Äù Lured by the perfect light in which to make tintypes, she now lives in sunny Venice Beach, California. Porzak is often quoted as saying 'the soul is not digital' and says with conviction \\"there is no separation between my work and my life.\\" Her favorite color is whiskey.  Education  Lara Porzak attended Martha‚Äôs Vineyard Regional High School and received her degree from Dartmouth College. A self-proclaimed photography workshop junkie, Porzak has studied with Mary Ellen Mark, Graciela Iturbide and Christopher James amongst others.

He served as the first Indian director of the Zoological Survey of India, succeeding R.B.S. Sewell. He was also a scholar of Persian and took an interest in the history of zoology. Prashad was born at Kirtarpur to Rai Sahib Devi Das, who was an administrative officer in the government in Punjab. His paternal grandfather Rai Sahib Gopal Das had been a commissioner. Prashad studied in Lahore and graduated from the Government College in Lahore in 1913 followed by a MSc in 1914. He worked on a Ph.D. under J. Stephenson, a specialist on annelids and professor of Zoology and was the first person to receive a non-honorary D.Sc. degree from Punjab University in 1918. His research was on the calciferous glands of earthworms. In 1927 he also received a D.Sc. from the University of Edinburgh. He was appointed to the department of fisheries in Calcutta in 1918 during which time he collaborated with T. Southwell on research on the Indian shad Hilsa ilisha and its parasites. Prashad became the third permanent director of the ZSI and the first Indian to hold the position following the retirement of Lieutenant-Colonel Sewell in 1934. In 1942, while Prashad was director, Calcutta was threatened by a Japanese air attack and the specimen collections were shifted to Varanasi but some of the fish and insect specimens were damaged due to floods during September 1943. Prashad worked on a wide range of taxa including substantial work on the termite fauna of India. Prashad became an advisor to the government of India in 1947 and was succeeded by Sundar Lal Hora as director of the Zoological Survey of India.

De Bry's works are characteristic of anti-Spanish propaganda which was a result of the Eighty Years' War. Spanish Empire The Black Legend (), or the Spanish Black Legend, is a theorised historiographical tendency consisting of anti-Spanish and anti-Catholic propaganda. Its proponents claim that its roots date back to the 16th century, when it was originally a political and psychological weapon that was used by Spain's northern European rivals in order to demonize the Spanish Empire, its people and culture, minimize Spanish discoveries and achievements, and counter its influence and power in world affairs. The assimilation of originally Dutch and English 16th century propaganda into mainstream history is theorised to have fostered an anti-Hispanic bias among subsequent historians along with a distorted view of the history of Spain, Latin America, and other parts of the world. This 17th century propaganda found its basis in real events during the Spanish conquest of the Americas, which did involve atrocities, but it often employed lurid and exaggerated depictions of violence, while ignoring similar behaviour by other powers. Although the existence of a 16th- and 17th-century Spanish black legend is agreed upon by the majority of scholars, aspects of the legend are still debated.Maltby, W. S. The Black Legend in England (1971). Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press. Charles Gibson described it as \\"The accumulated tradition of propaganda and Hispanophobia according to which the Spanish Empire is regarded as cruel, bigoted, degenerate, exploitative and self-righteous in excess of reality\\". Like other black legends, the Spanish black legend combined fabrications, de-contextualization, exaggeration, cherry picking and double standards with facts. There is disagreement among scholars over whether a biased portrayal of Spanish history continues into the present day, and the degree to which it might be significant if it does. Historiography and definitions of the Spanish Black Legend The term \\"black legend\\" was first used by Arthur L√©vy in reference to biographies of Napoleon and he primarily used it in the context of two opposing legends, a \\"golden legend\\" and a \\"black legend\\": two extreme, simplistic, one-dimensional approaches to a character which portrayed him as a god or a demon. \\"Golden\\" and \\"black legends\\" had been used by Spanish historians and intellectuals with the same meaning in reference to aspects of Spanish history; Antonio Soler used both terms about the portrayal of Castilian and Aragonese monarchs. The use of the term Leyenda Negra to refer specifically to a biased anti-Spanish depiction of history gained currency in the first two decades of the 20th century, and is most associated with Juli√°n Juder√≠as. Throughout the twentieth and into the 21st century, scholars have offered divergent interpretations of the Black Legend and debated its usefulness as a historical concept. Origins of the concept of a Spanish Black Legend At an 18 April 1899 Paris conference, Emilia Pardo Baz√°n used the term Black Legend for the first time to refer to a general view of modern Spanish history: The conference had a great impact in Spain, particularly on Juli√°n Juder√≠as. Juder√≠as, who worked at the Spanish Embassy in Russia, had noticed (and denounced) the spread of anti-Russian propaganda in Germany, France and England and was interested in its possible long-term consequences. Juder√≠as was the first historian to describe the \\"black legend\\" phenomenon, and identified its Spanish counterpart. His 1914 book, La Leyenda Negra y la Verdad Hist√≥rica (The Black Legend and Historical Truth), deconstructs aspects of Spain's image (including those in Foxe's Book of Martyrs). According to Juder√≠as, this biased historiography has presented Spanish history in a negative light and purposely ignored achievements and advances. In La Leyenda Negra, he defines the Spanish black legend as: Historiographic development of the term Later writers supported and developed Juder√≠as's critique. In Tree of Hate (1971), historian Philip Wayne Powell argued that the Black Legend was still active in modern history, giving examples of what he viewed as divergent treatment of Spain and other powers: In his book Inquisition, Edward Peters wrote: In his 2002 book Spain in America: The Origins of Hispanism in the United States, American historian Richard Kagan defined the Spanish black legend: According to Juli√°n Mar√≠as, the Spanish black legend was not exceptional, but its persistence is. The causes of its durability are: #Overlap of the Spanish Empire with the introduction of the printing press in England and Germany, which enabled the printing of hundreds of pamphlets daily #Religious factors and identification #Substitution of the Spanish intellectual class by another favorable to its former rival (France) after the War of the Spanish Succession, which established a French narrative in Spain #The unique characteristics of the early modern era's colonial wars and the need for new colonial powers to legitimize claims in now-independent Spanish colonies and the unique, new characteristics of the succeeding empire: the British Empire.Mar√≠as, Juli√°n (2006; primera edici√≥n 1985). Espa√±a Inteligible. Raz√≥n Hist√≥rica de las Espa√±as. Alianza Editorial. . Walter Mignolo and Margaret Greer view the Black Legend as a development of Spain's racialisation of Jewishness in the 15th century. The accusations of mixed blood and loose religiosity of the 15th century, first levelled at Jewish and Moorish conversos both inside Spain and abroad, developed into 16th century hispanophobic views of Spaniards as religious fanatics tainted by association with Judaism. The only stable element they see in this hispanophobia is an element of \\"otherness\\" marked by interaction with the Eastern and African worlds, of \\"complete others\\", cruelty and lack of moral character, in which the same narratives are re-imagined and reshaped. Antonio Espino Lopez suggests that the prominence of the Black Legend in Spanish historiography has meant that the real atrocities and brutal violence of the Spanish conquest of the Americas have not received the attention they deserve within Spain. He believes that some Hispanicists: According to historian Elvira Roca Barea, the formation of a black legend and its assimilation by a nation is a phenomenon observed in all multicultural empires (not just the Spanish Empire). A black legend about an empire would be the result of propaganda attacks and efforts by most smaller contemporary powers and defeated rivals; propaganda created by rival factions in the empire; self-criticism by the intellectual elite, and a need by new powers consolidated during (or after) the empire's existence.Roca Barea, Mar√≠a Elvira (2016). Imperiofobia y leyenda negra. Roma, Rusia, Estados Unidos y el Imperio espa√±ol. Madrid: Siruela. . In response to Roca Barea, Jos√© Luis Villaca√±as states that the Black Legend was primarily a factor related to the geopolitical situation of the 16th and 17th centuries. He argues that: The conceptual validity of a Spanish black legend is not universally accepted by academics. Benjamin Keen expressed doubt about its usefulness as a historical concept, while Ricardo Garcia Carcel and Lourdes Mateo Bretos denied its existence in their 1991 book, The Black Legend: Historical basis of 16th- and 17th-century anti-Spanish propaganda Eighteenth-century philosopher Immanuel Kant wrote, \\"The Spaniard's bad side is that he does not learn from foreigners; that he does not travel in order to get acquainted with other nations; that he is centuries behind in the sciences. He resists any reform; he is proud of not having to work; he is of a romantic quality of spirit, as the bullfight shows; he is cruel, as the former auto-da-f√© shows; and he displays in his taste an origin that is partly non-European.\\"Mignolo, W. D. (2007). \\"What does the Black Legend Have to do with Race?\\" Rereading the Black Legend: The Discourses of Religious and Racial Difference in the Renaissance Empires, 312-24. Thus, semiotician Walter Mignolo argues that the Spanish black legend was closely tied to race in using Spain's Moorish history to portray Spaniards as racially tainted and its treatment of Africans and Native Americans during Spanish colonization to symbolize the country's moral character. That notwithstanding, there is general agreement that the wave of anti-Spanish propaganda of the 16th and 17th centuries was linked to undisputed events and phenomena which occurred at the apogee of Spanish power between 1492 and 1648. Conquest of the Americas During the three- century European colonization of the Americas, atrocities and crimes were committed by all European nations according to both contemporary opinion and modern moral standards. Spain's colonization also involved massacres, murders, sexual slavery and other grotesque abuses of human rights, especially in the early years, following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Caribbean. However, Spain was the first in recorded history to pass laws for the protection of indigenous peoples. As early as 1512, the Laws of Burgos regulated the behavior of Europeans in the New World forbidding the ill- treatment of indigenous people and limiting the power of encomenderos‚Äîlandowners who received royal grants to recruit remunerated labor. The laws established a regulated regime of work, pay, provisioning, living quarters, hygiene, and care for the natives in a reasonably humanitarian spirit. The regulation prohibited the use of any form of punishment by the landowners and required that the huts and cabins of the Indians be built together with those of the Spanish. The laws also ordered that the natives be taught the Christian religion and outlawed bigamy. In July 1513, four more laws were added in what is known as Leyes Complementarias de Valladolid 1513, three related to Indian women and Indian children and another more related to Indian males. In 1542 the New Laws expanded, amended and corrected the previous body of laws in order to improve their application. These New Laws represented a humanitarian effort that was not enough to dissuade rebellions, like that of Gonzalo Pizarro in Per√∫. However, this body of legislation represents one of the earliest examples of humanitarian laws of modern history.The Laws of Burgos: 500 Years of Human Rights, In Custodia Legis, Library of Congress An illustration of Spanish atrocities in Hispaniola by Theodor de Bry Although these laws were not always followed, they reflect the conscience of the 16th century Spanish monarchy about native rights and well-being, and its will to protect the inhabitants of Spain's territories. These laws came about in the early period of colonization, following some abuses reported by Spaniards themselves traveling with Columbus. Spanish colonization methods included the forceful conversion of indigenous populations to Christianity. The ‚ÄúOrders to the Twelve‚Äù Franciscan friars in 1523, urged that the natives be converted using military force if necessary. On par with this sentiment, Dr. Juan Gines de Sep√∫lveda argued that the Indian's inferiority justified using war to civilize and Christianize them. He encouraged enslavement and violence in order to end the barbarism of the natives. Bartolome de las Casas, on the other hand was strictly opposed to this viewpoint‚Äîclaiming that the natives could be peacefully converted. Such reports of Spanish abuses led to an institutional debate in Spain about the colonization process and the rights and protection of indigenous peoples of the Americas. Dominican friar Bartolom√© de las Casas published Brev√≠sima relaci√≥n de la destrucci√≥n de las Indias (A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies), a 1552 account of the supposed atrocities committed by landowners and some officials during the early period of colonization of New Spain (particularly on Hispaniola). De las Casas, son of the merchant Pedro de las Casas (who accompanied Columbus on his second voyage), described Columbus's treatment of the natives in his History of the Indies. His description of Spanish actions was used as a basis for attacks on Spain, including in Flanders during the Eighty Years' War. The accuracy of de las Casas's descriptions of Spanish colonization is still debated by some scholars due to supposed exaggerations. Although historian Lewis Hanke thought that de las Casas exaggerated atrocities in his accounts,Hanke, Lewis, \\"A Modest Proposal for a Moratorium on Grand Generalizations: Some Thoughts on the Black Legend\\", The Hispanic American Historical Review 51, No. 1 (Feb., 1971), pp. 112‚Äì127 Benjamin Keen found them more or less accurate. Charles Gibson's 1964 monograph The Aztecs under Spanish Rule (the first comprehensive study of sources about relations between Indians and Spaniards in New Spain), concludes that the demonization of Spain \\"builds upon the record of deliberate sadism. It flourishes in an atmosphere of indignation which removes the issue from the category of objective understanding. It is insufficient in its understanding of institutions of colonial history.\\" However this view has been broadly criticised by other scholars such as Keen, who view Gibson's focus on legal codes rather than the copious documentary evidence of Spanish atrocities and abuses as problematic. In 1550, Charles I tried to end this debate by halting forceful conquest. Philip II tried to follow in his footsteps with the Philippine islands, but previous violent conquest had shaped colonial relations irreversibly. This was one of the lasting consequences that led to the dissemination of the Black legend by Spain's enemies. The ill-treatment of Amerindians, which would later occur in other European colonies in the Americas, was used in the works of competing European powers in order to foster animosity against the Spanish Empire. De las Casas' work was first cited in English in the 1583 The Spanish Colonie, or Brief Chronicle of the Actes and Gestes of the Spaniards in the West Indies, at a time when England was preparing for war against Spain in the Netherlands. All European powers which colonized the Americas, including England, Portugal and the Netherlands, ill-treated indigenous peoples. Colonial powers have also been accused of committing genocide in Canada, the United States, and Australia. These issues have received greater scholarly attention in recent years and the historiographical evaluation of colonialism's effects is evolving. According to William B. Maltby, \\"At least three generations of scholarship have produced a more balanced appreciation of Spanish conduct in both the Old World and the New, while the dismal records of other imperial powers have received a more objective appraisal.\\"Maltby, William B. \\"The Black Legend\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 1, pp. 346‚Äì348. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.  War with the Netherlands  Spain's war with the United Provinces and, in particular, the victories and atrocities of the Castilian nobleman Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, contributed to anti-Spanish propaganda. Sent in August 1567 to counter political unrest in a part of Europe where printing presses encouraged a variety of opinions (especially against the Catholic Church), Alba seized control of the publishing industry; several printers were banished, and at least one was executed. Booksellers and printers were prosecuted and arrested for publishing banned books, many of which were part of the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. After years of unrest in the Low Countries, the summer of 1567 saw renewed violence in which Dutch Calvinists defaced statues and decorations in Catholic monasteries and churches. The March 1567 Battle of Oosterweel was the first Spanish military response to the unrest, and the beginning of the Eighty Years' War. In 1568 Alba had prominent Dutch nobles executed in Brussels' central square, sparking anti-Spanish sentiment. In October 1572, after Orange forces captured the city of Mechelen, its lieutenant attempted to surrender when he heard that a larger Spanish army was approaching. Despite efforts to placate the troops, Fadrique √Ålvarez de Toledo (son of the governor of the Netherlands and commander of the duke's troops) allowed his men three days to pillage the city; Alba reported to King Philip II that \\"not a nail was left in the wall\\". A year later, magistrates were still attempting to retrieve church artifacts which Spanish soldiers had sold elsewhere. This sack of Mechelen was the first of a series of events known as the Spanish Fury; several others occurred over the next several years. In November and December 1572, with the duke's permission, Fadrique had residents of Zutphen and Naarden locked in churches and burnt to death. In July 1573, after a six-month siege, the city of Haarlem surrendered. The garrison's men (except for the German soldiers) were drowned or had their throats cut by the duke's troops, and eminent citizens were executed. More than 10,000 Haarlemers were killed on the ramparts, nearly 2,000 burned or tortured, and double that number drowned in the river. After numerous complaints to the Spanish court, Philip II decided to change policy and relieve the Duke of Alba. Alba boasted that he had burned or executed 18,600 persons in the Netherlands, in addition to the far greater number he massacred during the war, many of them women and children; 8,000 persons were burned or hanged in one year, and the total number of Alba's Flemish victims can not have fallen short of 50,000. The Dutch Revolt spread to the south in the mid-1570s after the Army of Flanders mutinied for lack of pay and went on the rampage in several cities, most notably Antwerp in 1576. Soldiers rampaged through the city, killing, looting, extorting money from residents and burning the homes of those who did not pay. Christophe Plantin's printing establishment was threatened with destruction three times, but was spared each time with payment of a ransom. Antwerp was economically devastated by the attack; 1,000 buildings were torched, and as many as 17,000 civilians were raped, tortured and murdered. Parents were tortured in their children's presence, infants were slain in their mother's arms, wives were flogged to death before their husbands' eyes. Maastricht was besieged, sacked and destroyed twice by the Tercios de Flandes (in 1576 and 1579), and the 1579 siege ended with a Spanish Fury which killed 10,000 men, women and children. Spanish troops who breached the city walls first raped the women, then massacred the population, reputedly tearing people limb from limb. The soldiers drowned hundreds of civilians by throwing them off the bridge over the river Maas in an episode similar to earlier events in Zutphen. Military terror defeated the Flemish movement, and restored Spanish rule in Belgium. The propaganda created by the Dutch Revolt during the struggle against the Spanish Crown can also be seen as part of the Black Legend. The depredations against the Indians that De las Casas had described, were compared to the depredations of Alba and his successors in the Netherlands. The Brevissima relacion was reprinted no less than 33 times between 1578 and 1648 in the Netherlands (more than in all other European countries combined).Schmidt, p. 97 The Articles and Resolutions of the Spanish Inquisition to Invade and Impede the Netherlands accused the Holy Office of a conspiracy to starve the Dutch population and exterminate its leading nobles, \\"as the Spanish had done in the Indies.\\"Schmidt, p 112 Marnix of Sint-Aldegonde, a prominent propagandist for the cause of the rebels, regularly used references to alleged intentions on the part of Spain to \\"colonize\\" the Netherlands, for instance in his 1578 address to the German Diet. Origin of the Early Modern Black Legend Anachronous map of the Spanish Empire, including territorial claims Anti-Spanish sentiment appeared in many parts of Europe as the Spanish Empire grew. In the Habsburg realm, Spain was a dominant power in a union encompassing present-day Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Burgundy and much of Italy. Iberian (principally Castilian) troops marched along the Spanish Road from Italy to Germany to fight on Dutch and German battlefields. During the Eighty Years' War, propaganda depicted Spaniards as bloodthirsty barbarians. During the following centuries, anti-Spanish stereotypes circulated widely (especially in English-, Dutch- and German-speaking parts of Europe). The propaganda depicted exaggerated versions of the evils of Spanish colonial practices and the Spanish Inquisition. William S. Maltby, regarding Spain in the Netherlands: Italy Sverker Arnoldsson of the University of Gothenburg supports Juder√≠as' hypothesis of a Spanish black legend in European historiography and identifies its origins in medieval Italy, unlike previous authors (who date it to the 16th century). In his book The Black Legend: A Study of its Origins, Arnoldsson cites studies by Benedetto Croce and Arturo Farinelli to assert that Italy was hostile to Spain during the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries and texts produced and distributed there were later used as a base by Protestant nations. Arnoldsson's theory on the origins of Spain's black legend has been criticized as conflating the process of black-legend generation with a negative view (or critique) of a foreign power. The following objections have been raised:Alvar, p.7 # The Italian origin of the earliest writings against Spain is an insufficient reason to identify Italy as the origin of the black legend; it is a normal reaction in any society dominated by a foreign power. # The phrase \\"black legend\\" suggests a tradition (non-existent in Italian writings) based on a reaction to the recent presence of Spanish troops (which quickly faded). # In 15th- and 16th-century Italy, critics and Italian intellectual admirers of Spain (particularly Ferdinand II of Aragon) coexisted. Edward Peters states in his work \\"Inquisition\\":According to William S. Maltby, Italian writings lack a \\"conducting theme\\": a common narrative which would form the Spanish black legend in the Netherlands and England.Maltby, p. 7. Roca Barea agrees; although she does not deny that Italian writings may have been used by German rivals, the original Italian writings \\"lack the viciousness and blind deformation of black-legend writings\\" and are merely reactions to occupation. Germany Arnoldsson offered an alternative to the Italian-origin theory in its polar opposite: the German Renaissance.Arnoldsson, pp. 104‚Äìff. German humanism, deeply nationalistic, wanted to create a German identity in opposition to that of the Roman invaders. Ulrich of Hutten and Martin Luther, the main authors of the movement, used \\"Roman\\" in the broader concept \\"Latin\\". The Latin world, which included Spain, Portugal, France, and Italy, was perceived as \\"foreign, immoral, chaotic and fake, in opposition to the moral, ordered and German.\\"Arnoldsson, pp. 117-ff. In addition to the identification of Spaniards with Jews, heretics, and \\"Africans\\", there was an increase in anti-Spanish propaganda by detractors of Emperor Charles V. The propaganda against Charles was nationalistic, identifying him with Spain and Rome although he was born in Flanders, spoke Dutch but little Spanish and no Italian at the time, and was often at odds with the pope. To further the appeal of their cause, rulers opposed to Charles focused on identifying him with the pope (a view Charles had encouraged to force Spanish troops to accept involvement in his German wars, which they had resisted). The fact that troops and supporters of Charles included German and Protestant princes and soldiers was an extra reason to reject the Spanish elements attached to them. It was necessary to instill fear of Spanish rule, and a certain image had to be created. Among published points most often highlighted were the identification of Spaniards with Moors and Jews (due to the frequency of intermarriage), the number of conversos (Jews or Muslims who converted to Christianity) in their society, and the \\"natural cruelty of those two.\\"Arnoldsson, pp. 123 ss.; Kamen, pp. 305 ss. Islamophobia and antisemitism This origin combines elements of German origin with proof of the anti-Hispanic narrative which existed prior to the 16th century, along with a large number of parallelisms between anti-Spanish and anti-Semitic narratives which existed in modern Europe, and it is one of the narratives which is gathering the largest amount of support. According to this view, the Spanish Black Legend was created by transferring the already created \\"character\\" of the \\"cruel, gold lusty Jew\\" onto the Spanish nation. Since the narrative was familiar, the stereotype was accepted, and the identification of Spaniards and Jews was already mainstream in Europe due to the long history of coexistence between both communities in Iberia, at a time when the Jews had been expelled from most of Europe, the Black Legend was promptly believed and assimilated in Central Europe. According to Elvira Roca Barea, the Spanish black legend is a variant of the antisemitic narratives which have been circulated in England, most of central Europe and Italy since the 13th century. Roca Barea views the prejudice against the Spanish empire as leading to a hispanophobic narrative which instrumentalised Spain's historical role as a meeting point of Christianity, Islam and Judaism as a tool of propaganda. In 1555, after the expulsion of the Spanish Jews, Pope Paul IV described Spaniards as \\"heretics, schismatics, accursed of God, the offspring of Jews and Moors, the very scum of the earth\\".Swart, K. W. (1975). \\"The Black Legend During the Eighty Years War\\" In Britain and the Netherlands (pp. 36‚Äì57). Springer Netherlands. This climate would facilitate the transfer of antisemitic and anti-Muslim stereotypes to Spaniards.Peters, Edward. Inquisition. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1989. This case has three main sources of proof, the texts of German Renascence Intellectuals, the existence of the black legend narrative in Europe prior to the conquest of America, and the similarity of the stereotypes to other stereotypes which were attributed to Judaism by anti-Semitic Europeans and the stereotypes which the Black Legend attributed to the Spanish.Elvira, Roca Barea Mar√≠a, and Arcadi Espada. Imperiofobia Y Leyenda Negra: Roma, Rusia, Estados Unidos Y El Imperio Espa√±ol. Madrid: Siruela, 201 Texts which identify Spaniards with \\"heretics\\" and \\"Jews\\" were first written in Germany in the 14th century, and various pieces of 15th- and 16th-century anti-Spanish propaganda are almost line by line copies of prior anti-semitic works. For example, the famous account of the mistreated Native Americans killing their oppressors by pouring melted gold on their heads is an exact rewording of the scene which is described in the anti-semitic poem the Siege of Jerusalem. It also suggests that the deep anti-semitism which is espoused in Luther¬¥s works may have served a double function, nationalistic and anti Spanish as well as religious, if the identification of both functions was already in circulation. Martin Luther correlated \\"the Jew\\" (detested in Germany at the time) with \\"the Spanish\\", who had increasing power in the region. According to Sverker Arnoldsson, Luther: *Identified Italy and Spain with the papacy, although Rome and Spain were enemies at the time *Ignored the coexistence (including intermarriage) of Christians and Jews in Spain *Conflated Spain and Turkey out of fear of an invasion by either.Luther op. cit., Tischr., III, p. 382, N¬∞ 3533 (14‚Äì31 January 1537); V, p. 284, N¬∞ 5635 (12 May 1544): op. cit. Arnoldsson (1960). In 1566 Luther's conversations are published. Among many other similar affirmations, he is quoted as saying: References to Spanish as \\"bad Christians\\", \\"Jews\\", \\"Moors\\" or racialized references associating said ancestry with lack of moral or general inferiority can be found uninterruptedly in black legend sources and political propaganda since the Middle Ages until well into the contemporary period.  England  England played a role in the spread and use of the Spanish Black Legend during colonial times, but it is also agreed that, no matter how much the English might have added to it, the origin of the narrative was not in England and reached the islands only after war and conflicting interest. In A Comparison of the English and Spanish Nation (1589), Robert Ashley writes: Antonio P√©rez, the fallen secretary of King Philip, fled to France and then England, where he published attacks on the Spanish monarchy under the title Relaciones (1594). The English referred to these books to justify privateering and wars against the Spanish.A violently hispanophobic preacher and pamphleteer, Thomas Scott, would echo this sort of epithet a generation later, in the 1620s, when he urged England to war against \\"those wolvish Antichristians\\" instead of accepting the \\"Spanish Match.\\" Sephardic Jews According to Philip Wayne Powell, criticism which was spread by the Jews who were expelled by Spain's Catholic monarchs was an important factor in the spread of anti-Spanish sentiment (particularly religious stereotypes).  Distribution  Proponents such as Powell, Mignolo Mignolo, W. D. (2007). \\"What does the Black Legend Have to do with Race?\\" Rereading the Black Legend: The Discourses of Religious and Racial Difference in the Renaissance Empires and Roca Barea allege that The Spanish Black Legend affects most of Europe, especially Protestant and Anglican Europe, and France, as well as the Americas. There is, however, no significant trace of it in the Muslim world or Turkey despite the almost seven centuries of sustained warfare in which Spain and the Islamic world were engaged. Historian Walter Mignolo has argued that the Black Legend was closely tied to ideologies of race, both in the way that it used the Moorish history of Spain to depict Spaniards as racially tainted, and in the way that the treatment of Africans and Native Americans during Spanish colonial projects came to symbolize their moral character. Mignolo, W. D. (2007). \\"What does the Black Legend Have to do with Race?\\" Rereading the Black Legend: The Discourses of Religious and Racial Difference in the Renaissance Empires, 312‚Äì324.  The continuance of the Black Legend in the modern era  Historians disagree on whether the Black Legend exists as a genuine factor in current discourse around Spain and its history. In recent years a group of historians including Alfredo Alvar, Ricardo Garcia Carcel and Lourdes Mateo Bretos have argued that the Black Legend does not currently exist, it being merely the Spanish perception of how the world views Spain's legacy.Jail and Matthew Garcia Bretos, The Black Legend (1991) & Matthew Garcia Carcel, Bretos, p.84 According to Carmen Iglesias, the black legend consists of negative traits which the Spanish people see in themselves and is shaped by political propaganda.Vaca de Osma, p.208 The view of the group around Garcia Carcel is echoed by Benjamin Keen, writing in 1969. He argues that the concept of the Black Legend cannot be considered valid, given that the negative depiction of Spanish behavior in the Americas was largely accurate. He further claims that whether a concerted campaign of anti-Spanish propaganda based on imperial rivalry ever existed is at least open to question. Henry Kamen argues that the Black Legend existed during the 16th century but is now a thing of the past in England. Other authors, however, like Roca Barea, Tony Horowitz and Philip Wayne Powell, have argued that it still affects the way in which Spain is perceived and that it is brought up strategically during diplomatic conflicts of interest as well as in popular culture to hide the negative actions of other nations. Powell believed in 1971 that the stereotypes of the Black Legend contribute to white supremacy, erasing the ethical and intellectual contributions of Southern Europeans and obscuring the power and competence of Native American empires before and during the Spanish conquest.Tree of Hate, p. 180. In 2006, Tony Horowitz argued that the Spanish black legend affected current US immigration policy. Roca Barea states that early modern Spanish phenomena, such as the Spanish Inquisition and the conquest of the Americas, were in actual fact beneficial and therefore any negative comment on them forms part of the Black Legend. She further claims that Protestant European countries remain essentially anti-Catholic stating: This viewpoint is criticised by Garcia Carcel, who views her book as part of a long tradition of Spanish insecurities towards other European countries, that in effect constitutes the true Black Legend. He identifies strains of whataboutery (in Spanish: y tu m√°s) and self pity (no nos quieren: \\"Nobody loves us\\") in the Spanish historiography of the Black Legend, arguing that rigorous historical investigation should replace Spain's obsession with the way others see it. Jos√© Luis Villaca√±as, in his 2019 response to Roca Barea, states that her work is in fact \\"populist national-Catholic propaganda\\", containing large numbers of \\"scientific irregularities\\". Villaca√±as further accuses Roca Barea of considering France, Spain, England and Holland to have \\"hispanophobia in their DNA\\", and of minimising Spanish atrocities in Latin America along with the activities of the Inquisition. He argues that to all intents and purposes the Black Legend has no meaning outside the context of 17th century propaganda, but recognises that certain negative archetypes of Spain may have persisted during the Franco regime. Other proponents of the continuity theory include musicologist Judith EtzionEtzion, Judith (1998) \\"Spanish music as perceived in western music historiography: a case of the black legend?\\" International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music 2 (29). and Roberto Fernandez Retamar, and Samuel Amago who, in his essay \\"Why Spaniards Make Good Bad Guys\\" analyzes the persistence of the legend in contemporary European cinema. Those who contend that the Black Legend still affects Spain and the Latin American world point to the following concrete examples:  Linguistic  * Creation and use of special categories: The use in English of the word \\"conquistador\\" instead of \\"conqueror\\" (the literal translation of conquistador), as well as of \\"conquista\\" instead of \\"conquest\\" (also, the literal translation of conquista) in order to create a new, unique category of connotation that separates Spaniards from other Europeans.  Economic  * Luis Espa√±ol argues that direct references to constructs from the times of the Black Legend were made in the British and Canadian press during the Turbot War of 1992 between Spain and Canada. * Elvira Roca Barea argues that referring to Spain as part of the PIGS or \\"GIPSY\\" (sic) group of countries is a recourse to anti-Catholic and hispanophobic stereotypes in order to protect the financial interests of Protestant countries.  Political  * Latin America‚ÄìUnited States relations: Philip Wayne Powell, writing in 1971, considered the Black Legend to be the root of contemporary diplomatic problems and anti-Latino sentiment in the United States, making the case for this in his book The Tree of Hate: Propaganda and Prejudices Affecting Relations with the Hispanic World. The view of the Black Legend affecting the present-day United States' immigration policy has gained supporters in the current political climate.Opinion  Immigration ‚Äì and the Curse of the Black Legend, Tony Horwitz The narrative of the \\"degenerated race\\" is argued to be at the root of the racist discrimination suffered by Latinos in America. * Powell stated that Spain's past ownership of about half of the United States' land was unknown by most Americans, affecting the way in which the Latin American population and culture are treated, as well as the linguistic debate there.Powell, Philip Wayne, 1971, \\"Tree of Hate\\" (first Ed.) * Spanish foreign minister Josep Borrell stated that he sees a re-emergence of the Black Legend across Europe in the way the Catalonian issue has been covered, especially by English-speaking press.Borrell, el CIP y la Leyenda Negra Luis Oz ‚Äì El Mundo  Education and popular culture  * In 1944, the American Council of Education released a report on anti-Hispanism in school textbooks, identifying a large number of basic errors, inexactitudes and biased portrayals. It concluded that \\"The abolition of the Black Legend and its effects in our interpretation of Latin American life is one of our main problems in the educational and intellectual aspect, as well as in the political sphere\\", and urged for textbooks' biases and errors to be fixed. However, according to Powell,Tree of Hate pp180 in 1971 all the core errors were still in the majority of school materials. * Roca Barea criticises the 2007 BBC documentary \\"Andes: The Dragon's Back\\" for stating that 200 Spaniards conquered 1.5 billion Incas, more than the entire population of the world at the time. She considers this to be modern Black Legend propaganda. Edgar Straehle, in his extended response to her book, points out that the programme in fact states that the population of the Inca Empire was 15 million, linking to the original English version. Roca Barea later replied to this argument by stating that, in the dubbed version broadcast on Spanish television, the figure of 1.5 billion was given. * Roca Barea points to the following dialogue from a dubbed episode of the tv series Law & Order, broadcast in Spain in 2014, as an example of continued hispanophobia in the present day: \\"How many heterosexual men over-30 do you know that are still Catholics and aren't weirdos?\\" Race * Powell argues that the Black Legend and its counterpart, the Dutch, English and German golden legends, are allegedly main contributors to the construct of white supremacy, since they erase the ethical and intellectual contributions of Southern Europeans and reduce the power and competence which was achieved by indigenous empires both prior to and during the Spanish conquest of the Americas.Powell, Philip Wayne, 1971, Tree of Hate (first Ed.) White legend The label \\"White Legend\\" is used to describe a supposed historiographic approach presenting an uncritical or idealized image of Spanish colonial practices. Some authors consider this to be the result of taking attempts to counter the bias of the Black Legend too far, whereas others consider it to have developed independently. Miguel Molina Martinez describes this legend as a characteristic of the Nationalist Spanish historiography which was propagated during the regime of Francisco Franco, a regime which associated itself with the imperial past and couched it in positive terms. Molina Martinez points to the classic text of Spanish Americanists during the Franco period, R√≥mulo Carbia's Historia de la leyenda negra hispanoamericana, as a work with a strong ideological motivation which frequently fell into arguments which could be qualified as part of the White Legend, while also giving more current examples of the trope. Some, such as Benjamin Keen, have criticized the works of John Fiske and Lewis Hanke as going too far towards idealizing Spanish history. While recognising the general merit of Hanke's work, Keen suggests that the United States' contemporary imperial ventures in the Caribbean and the Philippines had led him to idealise the Spanish Empire as an analogy for American colonialism. He further argues that the proponents of the White Legend focus on Spanish legal codes protecting the Indigenous population, while ignoring the copious documentary evidence that they were widely ignored. Luis Castellvi Laukamp accuses Elvira Roca Barea of \\"transforming the Black Legend into the White Legend\\" in her influential 2016 work, Imperofobia y Leyenda Negra, in which she claims that Spain confronted the other \\"not with racist theories but with [protective] laws\\". Castellvi Laukamp points out that not only did the Spanish Laws of the Indies include racism from the beginning, but slavery continued in Spanish colonies in the Americas until 1886. He further takes issue with claims that Spanish colonies' high level of mestizaje (biological and cultural mixing of the European and Indigenous population) demonstrates the absence of racism in the Spanish Empire. Castellvi Laukamp quotes from contemporary sources showing that Indigenous women were treated as spoils of war and subject to racialised sexual slavery and subordination and demonstrates the discriminatory racial stereotypes deployed against black and other non-white women in the colonial period. Dominican Historian Esteban Mira Caballos argues that the Black and White legends for part of a single unity, which he calls a \\"Great Lie\\". He goes on to describe the way the Black Legend is instrumentalised to support the White Legend: The \\"White Legend\\" or the \\"Pink Legend\\" (Sp: Leyenda Rosa) may also refer to the propaganda which was circulated within Spain by Philip II and his descendants, propaganda which claimed that his actions in the Netherlands and America were religiously motivated, so his own patrimony would be preserved. This propaganda was intended to foster the image that Spain was ruled by a prudent and pious monarch, and control the unrest that was generated by his aggressive policies and his wars in the Netherlands.

Built in 1857, it is a prominent example of Italianate architecture, designed by Richard Upjohn, with some of the earliest examples of Stick style decoration in the United States. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. Description and history The Alexander Van Rensselaer House stands in southwestern Middletown, not far from the Newport line on the north side of Miantonomi Avenue. It is set on a remnant of its original estate, whose drives are now designated Ichabod Lane and Restmere Terrace. It is a three-story wood frame structure, covered by a hip roof and finished in wooden clapboards. The roof eave is extended and studded with modillion blocks, above an extended frieze band with applied Stick style decoration, small windows, and drop pendants. A single-story porch extends across the three-bay front facade, with rounded columns rising to rounded arches. A low balustrade echoes the rounded arches between the columns, and along the sides of the flared stair that provides access to the porch. The house was built in 1857 for Alexander Van Rensselaer, a New York City businessman. He had married into the Howland family, who had summered in Newport since the 1830s. Richard Upjohn was retained to design this house, as well as the neighboring Hamilton Hoppin House, built for Van Rensselaer's brother-in-law and family. The two houses were set on nearly identical parcels, which were landscaped together by a series of meandering paths. The house was completed in 1857, two years after the death of Van Rensselaer's wife. His family maintained ownership of the property until 1904. Adolph Louis Audrain, the next owner, undertook significant renovations, and dubbed the estate \\"Restmere\\".

The 12-seater aircraft carried 4 people, including the pilot. All people on board plus one person on the ground were killed. A further three people on the ground were seriously injured. As a result of the crash, a fire broke out in the built-up area. Local firefighters and police responded to the accident. The aircraft had departed from Juhu Aerodrome for a test flight. Five people lost their lives in this accident; 2 pilots, 1 Technician, 1 Aircraft Maintenance Engineer, and 1 civilian. The Aircraft Accident Investigation Board released the final investigation report in Dec 2018. The probable cause of the accident as per the report was a stall caused by lack of situational awareness due to spatial disorientation triggered by deteriorating weather, a transition from ILS(IMC) to visual flying (Partial VMC) and unexpected bank owing to differential engine power. The report indicts the Indian DGCA for violation of regulations in granting the Air Operator Permit. The aircraft VT-UPZ was previously owned by the Uttar Pradesh government. In 2014, the aircraft had an accident in Allahabad in which there was substantial damage, but the DGCA investigation termed it as a minor incident. Taking advantage of this report, the certificate of airworthiness was not cancelled. Over the next decade, the aircraft changed ownership and was transported to Mumbai where the repair work was carried out under the supervision of the DGCA. Capt. Amit Singh FRAeS an aviation safety and human factors blogger carried out a detailed independent analysis of the accident and submitted the report to the Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation, India. Capt. Amit Singh has stated that the AAIB investigation is manipulated and does not correctly identify the cause of the accident, therefore, needs an investigation by a court of inquiry. The investigation has completely shielded the operator who was granted an Air Operator Permit by the Indian DGCA without having filled the mandatory post of the Chief of Safety. As per the technical report, both engines malfunctioned in flight probably due to which the aircraft crashed.

It is presumed that there was an earlier earthworks fortification built by the Avars, but the first written record is from the 13th century. At the beginning of the 14th century Charles I of Hungary built the first stone fortification, the Angevin fortress. In 1443 John Hunyadi restored the castle and the surrounding walls, which had been destroyed by an earthquake. The fortress was captured in 1552 by the Ottoman Turks, who held it till 1716 when it was taken by the Habsburgs. The Habsburgs reconstructed it, making it much bigger in the style of Blaise Francois Pagan, a precursor of the Vauban system. The Habsburg fortress was besieged only once, during the Hungarian Revolution in 1849. The increased effectiveness of artillery with explosive shells at the end of the 19th century rendered the walls ineffective. As the walls and the area around them (the non aedificandi area) hindered the development of the town, the walls were demolished and the ditches were filled in. At the beginning of the 21st century the only remains of the Habsburg fortress are the Huniade Castle, one bastionthe Theresia Bastion, an important tourist attractiona casemate of the ravelin of the Vienna Gate, a portion of the Eugeniu bastion and a small part of the curtain wall between the Eugeniu and Elisabetha bastions.

Paul Niedermaier believes that the street network of the fortress was rectangular and that there were two main streets, one from north to south and the other from east to west. The north‚Äìsouth street was a commercial road which joined the two gates and it was situated between the current Alba Iulia and Lucian Blaga Streets. The east‚Äìwest street was situated near the current J√°nos Bolyai Street. A castle was built in the southern part, in a similar perimeter, on the site of the previous Hunyadi castle. The castle was Charles I's royal court and residence between 1315 and 1323. During this period Timi»ôoara was the capital city of the Kingdom of Hungary. The Water Tour (Water Tower) was built to defend the bridge between these two fortified areas. Later the tower became one of the symbols on the coat of arms of Timi»ôoara. There was an inhabited rural area with irregular plots north of the fortress.Szentkl√°ray, Az udvar elk√∂lt√∂z√©se Temesv√°rr√≥lHa»õegan, Cronologia‚Ä¶, vol.

An artillery battery was installed in the Water Tower. There was an inhabited, but weakly fortified, island to the south of the castle: The Island, Palanca MicƒÉ (verbatim \\"The Small Palisade\\", meaning \\"alongside the short palisade\\"). The island and the swamps to the east and the west protected the castle from cannon fire. To the north the castle was defended by the fortress. Thus, even if the castle was not inside the fortress, it acted as a keep.Ha»õegan, Prin Timi»ôoara‚Ä¶, pp. 44‚Äì48Ha»õegan, Istoria‚Ä¶, vol. II, pp. 12‚Äì13 During the reign of Hunyadi the fortress had four gates: the Arad Gate, the Gate of Lipova (Praiko), the Ardeal Gate, and the Water Tower Gate. Ladislaus the Posthumous borrowed 20,000 Florins (1 Florin contained about 3.4 grams of fine gold) from John Hunyadi for his military operations. In 1453, when Ladislaus was coming of age, John retired and Ladislaus gave him the Timi»ôoara Fortress to cover his debt. The deed of gift, dated 20August 1455, was recognised by the chapter of Cenad on 3September 1445 and it reconfirmed him as a king on 7April 1456.Ha»õegan, Cronologia‚Ä¶, vol. II/1, pp. 245, 247 Initially the restoration work on the fortress was carried out at the expense of the royal treasury. Once it became the property of the Hunyadis they maintained it from their own funds. The castle was enlarged; a second floor was built and the old keep was built up to a height of . The guards, the knights' room, the prison and the stables were situated downstairs. The royal rooms, the guest rooms and a chapel were situated upstairs.Ha»õegan, Istoria‚Ä¶, vol.

To capture the fortress D√≥sza attempted to reduce the swamps surrounding it by diverting the Timi»ôel River into the Timi»ô River. He ordered the digging of a channel from the area of the current Fabric Quarter to the vicinity of the modern Giroc, it was not completed before John Z√°polya‚Äôs army arrived and defeated the peasants on 15July.Szentkl√°ray, D√≥sa Gy√∂rgy l√°zad√°saHa»õegan, Cronologia‚Ä¶, vol.

In 1550, following the treaty with John Z√°polya‚Äôs widow, the Habsburgs took over the city of Timi»ôoara and brought in Italian architects, such as Martino de Spazio, who reinforced the walls, fortified the Water Tower for harquebusiers and built bastions to strengthen the city against the threat posed by the Ottomans, despite the previous good relations between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans. The Ottomans, by supporting John Z√°polya as voivode of Transylvania, considered Banat to be under their suzerainty.Ha»õegan, Cronologia‚Ä¶, vol.

The main route of the Ottoman attack was along the right bank of the Danube towards Belgrade, Buda and Vienna.Petre P. Panaitescu, De ce nu au cucerit turcii »öƒÉrile Rom√¢ne?, √Æn InterpretƒÉri rom√¢ne»ôti. Studii de istorie economicƒÉ »ôi socialƒÉ, Bucure»ôti: Ed. Universul, 1947 In Serbia forts were established or reinforced in Golubac, Smederevo, Kovin, Belgrade, and Petrovaradin. As there was a bottleneck on the Danube at the Iron Gates, there were numerous fortresses in the Clisura DunƒÉrii: Turnu Severin, Ada Kaleh, Or»ôova, Dubova (Peci), Svini»õa and Drencova. Fortresses in Banat in the middle of the 16th century ‚Äì Timi»ôoara Fortress shown circledHa»õegan, Cronologia‚Ä¶, vol. II/1 One of the routes used by the Ottomans for military intervention was along the Mure≈ü River, where almost all the riparian routes were fortified. The main fortresses were Szeged, Cenad, Arad and Lipova. Timi»ôoara itself had to be protected. One of the routes to access it was through Timi»ô and Cerna. Here there were fortresses at Mehadia, Caransebe»ô, Jdioara and Lugoj. From Transylvania, Timi»ôoara was defended by the fortresses of FƒÉget and Ha»õeg. There were also fortresses in the territory of Ilidia, Vr≈°ac, Cuie≈üti and Ciacova. As Timi»ôoara is situated almost in the middle of the Banat, it could support all these towns, which is why the Ottoman beys on the Danube stated that \\"whoever conquers Buda conquers a town, while whoever conquers Timi»ôoara conquers a country\\".Ottendorf, De la Viena‚Ä¶, pp. 15‚Äì16Ha»õegan, Prin Timi»ôoara‚Ä¶, p. 64Ha»õegan, Timi»ôoara‚Ä¶, p. 35 As a result, the Ottoman reaction to the takeover of Timi»ôoara by the Habsburgs was not long in coming. In September 1551 Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, the beylerbey of Rumelia, began his campaign. He led an army of 8,000 janissaries, 100,000 akƒ±ncƒ±lar and 13 sanjak-beys with their troops. To hold Transylvania he relied on the rulers of Wallachia and Moldavia and on the Tartars. In order to isolate Timi»ôoara, Sokollu Pasha started from Belgrade and advanced up the Tisza River by conquering Novi Beƒçej (19September) and Zrenjanin (25September). He continued along the River Mure»ô to Lipova, occupying the fortresses of Dude≈ütii Vechi, Cenad, Igri≈ü, Felnac, ZƒÉdƒÉreni, NƒÉdlac, Ciala, Arad, M√¢ndruloc, PƒÉuli≈ü and Chelmac. Lipova was occupied without a fight on 5October by Ulama Pasha, who remained there as sanjak-bey of the fortress.Szentkl√°ray, I.

The Ottomans began digging trenches in the area that would become Palanca Mare and placed two siege guns to bombard the fortifications from the north, but the intervention of the defender's cavalry prevented the attack. The defenders repulsed multiple attacks before the weather turned on 25October and rain flooded the trenches. After 26October the Janissaries' period of service ended, so Sokollu Pasha had to raise the siege and retreated towards Beƒçej.Ha»õegan, Timi»ôoara‚Ä¶, pp. 81‚Äì83 The troops of the garrison went on the attack and on 29October they reconquered Cenad Fortress. On 4November the Imperial troops commanded by arrived in Lipova and, after a two-week siege, the town surrendered. According to the tradition of the time, the surrender was conditional on the Ottomans being allowed free passage. However, troops did not respect the agreement and slaughtered the garrison. Ulama Pasha was injured, but managed to escape. This event had repercussions on the conquest of Timi»ôoara the following year. By the end of November, all the fortresses occupied by the Ottomans during the 1551 campaign had been recovered.Ha»õegan, Timi»ôoara‚Ä¶, pp. 83‚Äì86  Ottoman capture of the fortress  The Ottoman campaign began on 22April 1552 when the Ottoman troops commanded by Kara Ahmed Pasha, the second vizier, left Adrianople and headed for Belgrade. They crossed the Danube together with the army of Rumelia commanded by Sokollu Pasha and reached Timi»ôoara on 24June with a vanguard of 1,500 horsemen. The siege began on 28June. Sokollu Pasha was positioned on the east side of the fortress, and Hassan Pasha, the beylerbey of Anatolia, on the west side. The Ottomans had 16 basilisks (large siege cannons). The garrison of the fortress was about 2,500 menincluding 1,000 Hungarians, 400 Spanish, 200 Austrians, 300 Czechsand 17 cannon, Losonci Istv√°n was still in command.Szentkl√°ray, A t√∂r√∂k√∂k √∫jabb t√°mad√°saHa»õegan, Cronologia‚Ä¶, vol.

Turkish attacks took place on 29June (on the island), 3July (from the north), 6July (on the island) and 12July. On 6July the Ottomans demanded surrender for the first time. The Turkish cannon constantly bombarded the fortress and eventually the defenders were no longer able to repair the damage. On 18July there were discussions with the Ottomans regarding a surrender, but the defenders‚Äô views were divided. The local inhabitants demanded the surrender of the fortress, but the soldiers, hoping for help from Castaldowho did not arrivewanted to continue the fight and used the two days truce to repair the fortifications as much as they could. Meanwhile, Ottoman artillery had increased and they deployed up to 30 cannon, organized in three batteries. On 20July the Ottomans recommenced the bombardment, and the bastions and walls were destroyed over the following days. On 24July the Water Tower was destroyed and captured by the Ottomans, but with heavy lossesover 2,000 fighters. With the loss of the Water Tower communications between the castle and the town were broken. On 25July the last assault took place and the inhabitants demanded again that the fortress surrender. On 26July the Spanish and Austrian mercenaries admitted that the town could no longer be defended and they capitulated.Szentkl√°ray, Az ostrom, A t√∂r√∂k alkudoz√°sai, A d√∂nt≈ë t√°mad√°s, A basa kegyelmi aj√°nlata, A v√°r √°tad√°saHa»õegan, Timi»ôoara‚Ä¶, pp. 91‚Äì98 On July 27, in accordance with the surrender convention, the garrison left the town through the Praiko Gate. Nevertheless, as a reprisal for the massacre of the Lipova garrison the previous year, the Ottomans violated the armistice conditions and launched an attack that led to the murder of the defenders, including Istv√°n Losonci.Szentkl√°ray, A v√°r≈ërs√©g kivonul√°sa, A t√∂r√∂k esk√ºszeg√©se, Losonczy kiv√©gz√©seHa»õegan, Timi»ôoara‚Ä¶, pp. 98‚Äì99  17th century  Timi»ôoara Fortress in 1602 After the conquest of the fortress, most of the Banat became the Teme≈üvar Eyalet, ruled by Beylerbey Kasam Pasha. Timi»ôoara has been considered to be the capital of Banat since the establishment of Teme≈üvar Eyalet. There is little information regarding the growth of the town. Published maps and vedute were based on information from before the Ottoman conquest. For example, Matth√§us Seutter's 18th-century map showed the Island and Fabric areas as smaller than they were; nevertheless, the map was popular due to the author's fame and its use of colour. Another inaccurate vedute was published in 1656 by Nicolas Sanson or ; there were many others.Opri»ô, MicƒÉ monografie‚Ä¶, pp. 12‚Äì13Opri»ô, Monografia‚Ä¶, p. 11Capotescu, Arhitectura‚Ä¶, pp. 96‚Äì97 A sketch closer to reality was made in 1602 by . This sketch was the basis of a veduta painted by Ludwig F√∂rster in 1836. In the painting the city is seen from the northeast. We can see the castle and the wall with bastions surrounding it, the Water Tower, the irregular shape, and the city walls with their bastions and the Pasha's house.Capotescu, Arhitectura‚Ä¶, p. 98 In mid-December 1662 Leopold I sent a diplomatic mission to the Pasha of Belgrade. The mission was led by the Baron of Go√´ss, and Henrik Ottendorf was part of it. The real purpose of the visit was to observe the Ottoman military. While praising the purpose of the visit, the Ottomans diverted it to Timi»ôoara, where at that time they were few Ottoman troops. The mission was left to wait and only in the summer of 1663 was it received in Belgrade. Although in Timi»ôoara they were always accompanied by Ottoman officials, Ottendorf took advantage of the delay, making notes of what he saw. However, they were not allowed access everywhere, for example, not in the fortified area of the souththe old Angevin fortress and the castle. The 1663 notes were systematized in a 1667 document of 97 pages with 24 drawings, of which two (a veduta and a plan) are of Timi»ôoara. The plan is considered approximate, but the veduta is considered much more accurate than anything else from the time, and is the only view of the fortress (Teme≈üvar Kalesi , Haber Turk, 26 July 2014. Retrieved 2018-07-29) in the second half of the 18th century made by an eyewitness.Ha»õegan, Prin Timi»ôoara‚Ä¶, p. 114Ha»õegan, Cronologia‚Ä¶, vol. II/2, p. 211 During the Turkish occupation, Timi»ôoara was divided into three parts: the fortress, the town and the suburbs. The fortress was the area where the castle and the headquarters of the vali (governor) and the kaymakam were located. The town was the fortified area on the north side of the fortress. In the middle of the town there was the bazaar, the centre of commerce. The suburbs (Palanca Mare) were, in turn, divided into the Rascian Town (Rascians was the name given by the Habsburgs to the orthodox Serbs) and the Island (other than the one that protected the castle from the south) to the east, in front of the Water Gate. In front of the castle, towards the city, there was the Water Tower. The castle was surrounded by another four defensive towers, linked by walls.Ha»õegan, Timi»ôoara‚Ä¶, pp. 107‚Äì109 Only the Ottomans inhabited the town. The Catholics and the Serbs lived in the suburbs where they had their own churches. File:Ottendorf - Timisoara otomana veduta.jpgOttendorf's veduta, a view from the north side of the fortress.

The town was cordoned off by tall earthern walls reinforced by palisades made of tree trunks tied with wickerwork. The walls on the west, north, and east were protected by a counterguard with a palisade. The wall to the south was protected by the castle, and the walls on the southeast and southwest were protected by swamps. There were deep moats in front of the counterguard, in front of the walls and between them.Capotescu, Arhitectura‚Ä¶, pp. 85‚Äì93 The walls of the town had five gates:Szentkl√°ray, Evlia Cselebi le√≠r√°saHa»õegan, Istoria‚Ä¶, vol.

Palanca Mare could be entered in through the Gate of the Long Toggle Bridge (in the northwest, in front of the Rooster's Gate), the Forforos Gate (&), the Martoloz Gate (2) and the Customs Gate (in the northeast, 3).

The Water Gate was defended by the Water Gate Bastion (6). The bastion of Arsenal was flanked by the bastion of Gate of the Azaps (7) and Ali Pasha Bastion (8). Azig Pasha (9) and the Rooster's bastions were located on the north side (10). The Yamak Bastion (11) and the Blood Tower (12) were located on the west side. There were two bastions on either side of the Castle's Small Gate and two other bastions in the southern corners of the walls that protected the castle. The fortifications were restored in 1571.Ha»õegan, Cronologia‚Ä¶, vol. II/2, p. 71 The garrison was initially composed of about 250 soldiers, of whom 100 were horsemen. As well there were about 150 azapspeasant militia. There were about 20 Martologs (Christian sailors on the Danube who were border guards) and some m√ºteferiki (various specialists). In the case of military confrontations, other troops would be despatched to the fortress.Ha»õegan, Prin Timi»ôoara‚Ä¶, pp. 65‚Äì67Ha»õegan, Timi»ôoara‚Ä¶, pp. 113‚Äì116Ha»õegan, Cronologia‚Ä¶, vol.

The siege resumed in October‚ÄìNovember, but it was again unsuccessful. In February 1600, the troops of Michael the Brave, under the command of Baba Novac, attacked Timi»ôoara and burned down the suburbs, but they did not besiege it and moved to Panƒçevo. In October 1603, it was Giorgio Basta's turn to besiege Timi»ôoara, but again it held out. Evliya √áelebi visited Timi»ôoara many times between 1660 and 1664 and also recorded a description of what he saw.Ha»õegan, Cronologia‚Ä¶, vol. II/2, pp. 220‚Äì232 The counterguard and the fortifications with palisades were made in the second half of the 17th century. Therefore, it is considered that the names Palanca Mare and Palanca MicƒÉ date from this period.Opri»ô, Monografia‚Ä¶, pp. 34‚Äì35 In 1686, Timi»ôoara Fortress was prepared for battle. According to an inventory of the weaponry, this included 54 pieces of artilleryof which 3 were basilisks1346 rifles, 402 bows and 11,760 arrows and 5,156 grenades. In the first half of 1688 the fortifications were repaired. Between the fall of 1689 and the spring of 1690, Timi»ôoara Fortress was subjected to a long siege by the Imperials. During 1692 and 1693 the fortifications were repaired and the fortress was supplied with weapons.Ha»õegan, Cronologia‚Ä¶, vol. II/2, pp. 259‚Äì267 In the fall of 1695 Sultan Mustafa II visited Timi»ôoara and organized an expedition to capture Lipova Fortress.

However, they were defeated by the Turkish Army, after which the fortifications were again restored.Ha»õegan, Cronologia‚Ä¶, vol. II/2, pp. 282‚Äì288 Although they kept repairing the fortifications, they were of earth with wood-plated parapets, unable to withstand modern artillery. Of the buildings only the castle, the mosques and the walls surrounding the castle and the fortress (the southern part of the city, the Angevin fortress) were made of masonry, the rest of the buildings were made of wood and thatch and so burnt easily.Opri»ô, Botescu, Arhitectura‚Ä¶, pp. 43‚Äì45  Habsburg Fortress  Plan of the Habsburg siege of Timi»ôoara.

He then headed for Timi»ôoara with his army of about 45,000 infantry, over 23,000 cavalry, 50 field guns and 87 siege cannon. The Ottoman garrison was composed of about 16,000 men and 150 cannons.Preyer, Monographie‚Ä¶, pp. 182‚Äì183Ha»õegan, Cronologia‚Ä¶, vol. II/2, p. 307Ha»õegan, Istoria‚Ä¶, vol.

The siege started on 31August. Engineering works were carried out between 1 and 5 September: trenches were dug and cannon were emplaced in order to cover the operations. From 16September the bombardment increased in intensity as more guns arrived and were installed. The first breaches in the walls appeared between 20 and 22 September. Meanwhile, another army corps, consisting of 14 squadrons and 4 infantry battalions under the command of General Steinville, arrived from Alba Iulia. The Ottomans‚Äô counter-attacks were repelled. There was an intense mutual bombardment on 25September. Ottoman troops attempting to relieve the fortress garrison attacked from the south three times on 26September. They failed to break through as they had not synchronized their attack with the defenders of the fortress. The counterguard was captured on 30September. The guns were moved to new positions during early October. On 11October a massive bombardment of the walls began. A white flag of surrender appeared on 12October on one of the bastions at half past eleven.Szentkl√°ray, Temesv√°r ostroma, √Åltal√°nos rohamHa»õegan, Cronologia‚Ä¶, vol.

Approximately 1,000 wagons were available for their withdrawal. They were permitted rations for a 10-day trip to Belgrade. Deserters from the Habsburg army were not allowed to leave, and the heavy weapons, the gunpowder and the fodder supplies had to remain.Preyer, Monographie‚Ä¶, pp. 184‚Äì185Szentkl√°ray, A kapitul√°czi√≥, A t√∂r√∂k elvonul√°saIlie»ôiu, Monografia‚Ä¶, pp. 65‚Äì73Ha»õegan, Prin Timi»ôoara‚Ä¶, pp. 207‚Äì209Ha»õegan, Istoria‚Ä¶, vol.

The Treaty of Passarowitz confirmed the transfer of the Banat of Temeswar, including Timi»ôoara Fortress, to the Habsburg monarchy.  Reconstruction  After its capture the fortress was in badly damaged state and the Austrians began to repair and rebuild it. There was not a clear plan and coherence was hampered by the need for it to always remain functional.Opri»ô, Monografia‚Ä¶, p. 58 Many schemes were suggested between 1717 and 1727, but none were executed.Capotescu, Arhitectura‚Ä¶, pp. 131‚Äì138 Just after the conquest the military engineer Captain Fran√ßois Perrette, who had laid out the fortifications in Slavonski Brod in 1715, was tasked with making a topographic map of the fortress along with proposals for new fortifications. He made three plans, the first two in October 1716 and February 1717, which were considered very accurate,Sorin For»õiu, Sieur Fran√ßois Perrette, Capitaine Ing√©nieur de Sa Maiest√© Imp√©riale , banat.ro. Retrieved 2017-04-11 and the third, published in 1729, contained plans for the proposed fortifications.Mr. [Jean] Rousset [de Missy], A La Haye, Chez Isaac van der Kloot, Histoire militaire du prince Eugene de Savoye, du prince et duc de Marlborough, et du prince de Nassau- Frise.

Enrichie des Plans n√©cessaires, MDCCXXIX (1729) The first fortification, built in 1716, was the \\"New Ravelin\\", meant to defend Palanca MicƒÉ from the south.Opri»ô, MicƒÉ monografie‚Ä¶, pp. 39‚Äì51Opri»ô, Monografia‚Ä¶, p. 61 A first proposal was to build bastions along the old wall from the north. The Palanca MicƒÉ was to be preserved and barracks were to be built at its eastern end. The problem was the small space inside the walls. However, the project provided configuration of the Casemated Barracks, later known as the Transylvanian Barracks, which would close the fortress perimeter from the southeast. The Palanca MicƒÉ area was proposed as a residential area. Another proposal was to build a residential area to the southeast of the barracks. It was less exposed to a potential siege due to its location in the swamp. However, the proposed bastions were designed in Italian style, already obsolete, and the form of the fortification was unsuitable for the principles of an ideal city. The project indicated that it had already been decided that the fortress would have three layers of fortification. Geyer's proposal was to keep the fortress together with the castle, keeping an extension area to the southeast. There were proposals for the extension of this area even after the construction of the first wall was complete, as can be seen in plan no. 3 from 1734. Plan no. 3 is the first official plan that included the entire outline of the fortifications. In it the elements depicted in red were buildings that had already been raised (the Casemated Barracks and the fodder supply warehouse of the Theresia Bastions). The ones sketched in black had their foundations laid, and the ones in yellow represented the proposals to close the curtain wall.Opri»ô, Monografia‚Ä¶, pp. 52‚Äì53 File:Timisoara SE- KrA-0406-26-025-001.jpgProposal with residential area to the southeast.

The foundation stone of the future fortress (Temeswar/Timi»ôoara , Universit√§t Oldenburg. Retrieved 2018-07-29) was laid on 25April 1723. A zinc plaque inscribed was with \\"Imperante Carolo VI, Duce Eugenio Sabaudiae Principe per cladem Petro-Varadini MDCCXVI a Turcis recuperata Provincia, sub preadisio Claudii Comitis a Mercy anno a patru Virginis MDCCXXIII die XXV. mensis Aprilis Temesvarini moenia fundabantur\\",Preyer, pp. 72, 191 but the plans indicate that the main work began later. The first work was on the Infantry Casemated Barracks, built between 1727 and 1729. At that time the plan for the fortress had not been finalised.Opri»ô, Monografia‚Ä¶, pp. 63‚Äì70 In 1732 a significant part of the fortress was designed and the digging of the moat from the front of the future bastions began. It took one year to excavate the trench and erect the curtain wall and the counterscarp. The construction was delayed due to the prior execution of hydrotechnical works to provide the water needed for the Fortress, executed between 1728 and 1732. Fortress plan in 1740. North is down. The first defensive wall belts of the fortress were finished in 1740. The first wall had 8 bastions (there were 9 eventually) in Pagan style (precursor of the Vauban style fortifications) and the curtain walls between them. The second one had eight ravelins placed in front of the inner works of the fortress (the curtain walls and bastions). This gave a clear picture of how the town would look and how long it would be a non aedificandi area. In 1744, the sites of the German and Rascian suburbs were approved (the current Iosefin and Mehala quarters).Opri»ô, Monografia‚Ä¶, p. 56 The Fortress' fortifications in 1808 The plan of the fortress in 1808 (see the infobox) shows its final shape, as the three wall belts had already been finished in 1764. The adjacent picture is drawn based on this plan and highlights the details. The various shades of green represent the banquettes, the barbettes, the covertways and the glacis. Blue indicates the trenches, and light blue represents the floodplains in case of siege. Yellow represents the access ways, the bridges and the ramps. In the intra muros area there were fortified buildings represented in dark red: Hunyadi Castle (1), the Infantry Casemated Barracks (later known as the Transylvanian Barracks), The Barracks of the Fortifications Construction Service (The Engineer's HouseOpri»ô, MicƒÉ monografie‚Ä¶, p. 63) (3), Vienna Barracks (later Franz Joseph Barracks) (4), the gunpowder magazine (5), the dermatology hospital (6) and the military hospital (7). There were three squares: (8), (9)next to the dome (10) and the (11)and a small triangular square (the current St. George Square) where there was a church, the former Great Mosque (12). The ground level is shown in white.Opri»ô, Monografia‚Ä¶, pp. 64‚Äì72Capotescu, Arhitectura‚Ä¶, p. 163, 201 A plan of the Habsburg Fortress superimposed on a map of modern Timi»ôoara The vertical profile of the fortifications was of Vauban type, with three wall belts, each facing floodplains.Opri»ô, Monografia‚Ä¶, p. 69Capotescu, Arhitectura‚Ä¶, pp. 216‚Äì218 The first wall belt, whose parapets are represented in red, consisted of nine bastions and curtain walls. The bastions and the ravelins were numbered with Roman numerals, clockwise, beginning with the ones from the northeast (similar to the figures on the dials of the clocks).Opri»ô, Monografia‚Ä¶, pp. 71‚Äì73Capotescu, Arhitectura‚Ä¶, pp. 188, 190, 219‚Äì232 The bastions were: * I The Francisc Bastion, separated from the intra muros area; access was by means of a wooden bridge. On the left side it was flanked by an artillery platform and by a tenaille. * II The Theresia Bastion, the only one which remains today, was the first defensive structure which was built and it was originally designed as ravelin. It has orillons and a retraction, because it was designed to function independently of the rest of the Fortress, even if it was penetrated. * III The Joseph Bastion, which flanked the Transylvania Gate, had one orillon and a curved side. * IV The Leopold Bastion (Hamilton Bastion, Bastion of the gunpowder magazine) had no orillorns and it was flanked by tenailles. A gunpowder magazine was placed on it. * V The Castle Bastion, designed to protect the Huniade Castle, had one orillon directed to the Petrovaradin Gate. * VI The Mercy Bastion, which flanked the Petrovaradin Gate to the west and protected the barracks of the fortification service and the dermatology hospital. It had orillons and the right flank was protected by an artillery platform. * VII The Eugeniu Bastion protected the military and dermatology hospitals. It had orillons; the one on the left still exists next to . To the right it was flanked by a tenaille. * VIII The Elisabetha Bastion flanked the Vienna Gate on the left. It had orillons and it was protected on both sides by tenailles. * IX The Carol Bastion, which flanked the Vienna Gate to the right, had orillons and was protected on the left flank by a tenaille and on the right flank by an artillery platform. The bastions had two levels for artillery: the inferior level from which to fire the cannons through embrasures, and the upper level, which was used to fire the cannons on the barbettes over the parapets. The second wall belt, whose parapets are represented in brown, consisted of 7 ravelins flanking the bastions ‚Äî excepting the Theresia bastion that was flanked by redans ‚Äî and 9 counterguards of the bastions. The ravelins were flanked by caponiers. The ravelins on the northern side of the fortress were strengthened. Lunettes were placed on the ravelins between Mercy and Elisabetha bastions, and redans on the ones between Elisabetha and Francis bastions.Capotescu, Arhitectura‚Ä¶, pp. 189, 191 The third wall belt, whose parapets are represented in purple, was made up of the belt of the ravelins and the counterguards from the second wall belt. The belt was made up of nine other counterguards flanked by nine triple redans. Access to the fortress was through three gates: The Vienna Gate (or The Gate of Arad, The Gate of Mehala) in the north-northwest of the fortress, between Elisabetha and Carol bastions, The Gate of Transylvania (or The Transylvanian Gate, Lugoj Gate) in the east of the fortress, between the bastions Theresia and Joseph, and The Gate of Petrovaradin (or The Gate of Belgrade, The Josephine Gate) in the southwest of the fortress, between Castle's and Mercy bastions. The gates were each separated by three bastions, and the fortifications besides them were supplemented. There were 5‚Äì6 parapets instead of three parapets at the gates of Vienna and Transylvania, and, at the gate of Petrovaradin, the access was made through a long bridge between the first and the second belts of fortifications. Opri»ô, Monografia‚Ä¶, pp. 72, 84‚Äì86Capotescu, Arhitectura‚Ä¶, pp. 205‚Äì210 In 1765 the last fortification work was completed. A new riverbed (the current Bega Canal) was dug. Initially, in order not to shelter attacking troops, the bank from the fortress had to continue the slope of the glacis, but over time, the water dug its own bed and the shore offered protection to potential attackers. The result had the same effect as if a parallel trench had been dug. Therefore, the work was considered a mistake, and it was exploited in the siege of 1849.  Siege of 1849  On 13 March the Revolution of 1848 broke out in Vienna and on 15March in Budapest. The news reached Timi≈üoara on 18March 1848.Preyer, Monografia‚Ä¶, p. 213 Following Ferdinand I of Austria‚Äôs decision on 3October a state of siege was declared in the Kingdom of Hungary. The military commander of the fortress of Timi»ôoara, Lieutenant Field marshal K.k. took over command of Timi»ôoara. Georg von Rukavina K√°roly V√©csey The state of siege required the banning of riots, of groups larger than 6 persons and also imposed the surrender of the arms. In response, to the decree of Lajos Kossuth of 8Octoberwhich demanded the flying of the Hungarian flag and loyalty to Hungarythe garrison of the city replied that Kossuth was declared outlaw by the decree of 3October and therefore it was no longer obliged to follow Hungarian orders and would remain faithful to the Emperor and defend the Fortress.Preyer, Monografia‚Ä¶, pp. 214‚Äì218Szentkl√°ray, A d√©lvid√©ki f√∂lkel√©s, Temesv√°r ostrom√°llapotbanIlie»ôiu, Timi»ôoara‚Ä¶, pp. 96‚Äì99 Although the restoration of Timi»ôoara Fortress was completed, due to the swampy ground the first heavy wall belt had sunk to some extent, making artillery fire difficult without threatening the defenders of the other two wall belts, and also the covertway. In the winter of 1848‚Äì1849 the fortress was supplied and reinforcements were sent. At the beginning of the siege the defense forces consisted of 8,851 people. It also had 1,272 horses and 213 functional cannons. There was enough gunpowder, but there were only 312 artillerymen and 17 military engineers. On 14 May the attackers occupied Fabric and destroyed the drinking water supply pipe to the fortress. The defenders could use the 130 fountains in the fortress but only 13 of them provided drinking water. The lack of clean water led to epidemics.Preyer, Monografia‚Ä¶, pp. 218‚Äì222Szentkl√°ray, Bogma Istv√°n napl√≥ja az ostromr√≥l, Az ostrom, Temesv√°r f√∂lment√©se The first bombardment of the fortress took place on 18May. The bombardment intensified on 11June, when the attackers put more guns in the battery. Nearly 2,000 shells landed in the Fortress area and almost all the buildings were hit. They were built of brick, with only Huniade Castle, the barracks, especially Transylvania Barracks, the Military Hospital and the crypts more strongly constructed. On 6 July the attackers installed further batteries and bombarded the fortress with about 30 mortars and 30 heavy cannon. On 20July Kossuth visited the siege camp and asked K√°roly V√©csey, the siege commander, to capture the fortress at all costs. The bombardment continued. During its most intense phase the batteries had 36 mortars, 20 cannons, 13 howitzers and 22 field guns, altogether 91 pieces. On 5August a parliamentarian demanded the surrender of the fortress but it was refused. On 8August movements were seen in the attackers‚Äô camp, and the following day there was further movement. The sound of cannonfire was heard to the northwest, where the Battle of Temesv√°r was being fought. The Austrian troops led by Julius Jacob von Haynau defeated the Hungarian army commanded by J√≥zef Bem, and Haynau entered Timi»ôoara after 107 days of siege. The losses among the garrison were not high: 161 dead, including 6 officers, 376 wounded, including 13 officers, 27 taken prisoner and 213 horses killed. However, the food supplies were exhausted, and typhus and cholera killed 2,000 people; after the siege a further 2,000 ill people died. Most of the buildings in the fortress were destroyed, including Huniade Castle,Preyer, Monografia‚Ä¶, pp. 222‚Äì224 which was rebuilt in 1856, acquiring a totally different look.Opri»ô, Arhitectura‚Ä¶ p. 35 On 14June 1852, Emperor Franz Joseph visited Timi»ôoara, where he laid the foundation stone of the Fidelity MonumentLMI Code: TM-IV- m-A-06330. in the Parade Square on 15June.Opri»ô, Arhitectura‚Ä¶ p. 284  Demolition  Plan of the city's surroundings in 1849, showing the esplanade of 500 klafter (950m) Plan of the city's surroundings at the beginning of the 20th century, showing the esplanade of 300 klafter (570m) With the development of heavier artillery the fortifications became ineffective in the 19th century. Many cities' fortifications were torn down, for example at Vienna (Vienna Ring Road), or Paris (Thiers wall) where the Boulevard P√©riph√©rique appeared. Although the Timi»ôoara Fortress was considered a large fortress, the intra muros area was too small for the town, the fortifications hindered the flow of traffic, and the esplanade occupied valuable space. The process of demolition began in 1859. At the request of the town, Franz Joseph decreed on 10November 1868 that the non aedificandi area be reduced from 500 Klafter (950 m) to 300 Klafter (570 m), allowing the suburbs to get closer to the fortress. However, the suburbs had to have the streets drawn radially towards the fortress to allow good sighting and enfilade fire in case of attack. The railway also had to comply with this requirement.GlƒÉvan, Defortificarea‚Ä¶, p. 422, citing J√≥zsef Geml, Temesv√°r √∫jkora, in Borovszky Samu, Magyarorsz√°g v√°rmegy√©i √©s v√°rosai, Budapest: 1913, p. 121 On 5November 1872, based on a decision of the town magistrates,GlƒÉvan, Defortificarea‚Ä¶, p. 423, citing Temesi Lapok, November 13, 1872, no. 162, p. 3 breaches in the walls were made to ease access to the fortress.GlƒÉvan, Defortificarea‚Ä¶, p. 423, citing Temesvarer Zeitung, April 8, 1873, no. 81, p. 1 In May 1891 Mayor Carol Telbisz renewed the request for demolition, which was approved by Franz Joseph on 23April 1892.GlƒÉvan, Defortificarea‚Ä¶, p. 424, citing Bar√°t, Armin.

As a result, the town acquired an area of 138,460 m2 and 26 million bricks, of which 19 million were sold and the rest used for the foundations of various administrative buildings. The sale of the bricks covered the costs of demolition.GlƒÉvan, Defortificarea‚Ä¶, p. 425, citing Geml, J√≥zsef (1927). Alt- Temesvar im letzten Halbjahrhundert 1870‚Äì1920, Timi»ôoara, p. 8 Plots of land were sold by the city, including plots on the glacis and on the esplanade, worth 1,906,512 Krone (about 570 kg of gold). The proceeds covered the cost of building a camp with barracks, a hay warehouse, a military tribunal and a garrison prison in the north of the city as agreed in compensation, as well as the systematization of the newly available land, the construction of several public buildings and additional economic and urban development of the town.GlƒÉvan, Defortificarea‚Ä¶, pp. 425‚Äì426, citing Bleyer, Gheorghe.

Yang's ancestral home was located in Yunnan, Yiqing followed his father Jing to Yuezhou, since the latter moved to there in 1460. He was considered a child prodigy at the age of six, and given a privilege to enter the Hanlin Academy for studying. He passed the metropolitan examination of 1468, and the palace examination of 1472 later. He settled in Dantu, where his father was buried, in the next year. After his mourning, he served as a drafter in the Grand Secretariat since 1476, then assistant surveillance commissioner of Shanxi some year later. He was appointed as commissioner of education in Shaanxi, and had been conversant with the frontier affairs the eight-year term expired. Yang held the posts of vice minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, then minister of its counterpart in Nanjing successively. He became vice censor-in- chief and attended to Shaanxi to supervise imperial horse ranches. When Dayan Khan assaulted the frontier, Yang assumed the responsibility of the governor of Shaanxi. He submitted his suggestion to renovate the Great Wall around Ordos, which was approved later. But he was maligned by Liu Jin who had a grudge against him soon. On the pretext of corruption, he was imprisoned until being rescued by Li Dongyang and Wang Jin, but had to leave his job then. When the Prince of Anhua revolted in 1510, the Zhengde Emperor summoned Yang and delegated him to suppress the revolt with a eunuch Zhang Yong. He utilized the contradictions between Zhang and Liu to remove the latter. He was promoted to the minister of revenue in autumn of the year, and gained the title of the junior protector of the heir apparent. Liu Jin was executed prior to his promotion. He was moved sideways, as the minister of Personnel several months later. He gained the title of the Junior Mentor in 1514. He took over as the Chief Grand Secretary, when Yang Tinghe was obliged to leave for mourning in 1515. He blamed the anomalies emerged recently to the incompetent administration in 1516, which annoyed officials Qian Ning and Jiang Bin who were satirized. They undermined Yang, thus the latter resigned returned to Dantu. Still, the emperor favored Yang, he stayed at Yang's home for two days, on his inspection to the southern. Yang was appointed as the supreme commander of the three frontiers of Shaanxi in 1525, which set a precedent for appointing the retired grand secretary as the frontier supreme commander. Prior to enthroning, the Jiajing Emperor had admired Yang, who endorsed Zhang Cong's actions in the Great Rites Controversy. Thus the latter gained the title of Junior Preceptor. Yang became the Chief Grand Secretary again in 1527. Suffered factional strifes, he left in later 1529. His titles and privilege were deprived, with Cong's accusation. Then he died in the autumn of 1530. The court restored his titles in 1548, besides, he was given the posthumous title \\"Wenxiang\\". Yang and Wang Shouren were close friends supposedly. Yang wrote the tombstone epitaph for Wang's father and endeavored to free imprisoned Wang, meanwhile Wang prefaced for Yang's collection, he also felt compassion when Yang was marginalized in the reign of Jiajing.

It became law on 25 December 1902.Tracy, p. 88.Gerschenkron, p. 62 claims it was passed by the Reichstag on 14 December. Background One of B√ºlow's predecessors, Leo von Caprivi, had negotiated commercial treaties with Austria-Hungary and Italy that had led to increased imports of foreign grain.Ashley, p. 84. Along with good harvests this caused a decline in the prices of wheat and rye until 1894, when they increased until 1898.Ashley, pp. 84-85. In 1898 the price of wheat in Prussia was 39s.10d. per imperial quarter. This declined to 32s.1d. in 1900 but rose again to 35s.2s. in 1902.Ashley, p. 85. The price of rye in Prussia remained steady: it was 7s.3d. per cwt. in 1898 and 7s.2d. in 1902.Ashley, p. 85. The agrarian interest (represented by the Junker-dominated German Agrarian League) complained of urbanisation caused by industrialisation; this was robbing the land of agricultural workers.Ashley, pp. 84-86. They denounced the policy of the trade treaties that had facilitated the increase in industrial exports but which had also increased agricultural imports. Instead, they lobbied for increased duties for all branches of agriculture.Ashley, p. 85. Their pressure was the decisive factor in bringing about higher rates of agricultural protection.Tracy, p. 94. B√ºlow's policy was to increase tariffs in the hope that these would give greater leverage to the government in the negotiations due when the treaties expired in 1906.Ashley, p. 85.Gerschenkron, p. 62. He also wished for greater specialisation in the tariff schedules to enable specific duties to be lowered without having to reduce those on others.Ashley, p. 85. The tariff bill was introduced in the Reichstag in 1901 but due to the intense debate over it, the bill was not passed until December 1902.Ashley, p. 86.Tracy, p. 91. Rates The tariff schedule introduced maximum and minimum duties on wheat, rye, oats and malting barley. These minimum rates were the lowest that could be levied in any future commercial treaty.Ashley, pp. 86-87.Gerschenkron, p. 62.Tracy, p. 91. The maximum duty on wheat was 7.50 marks per 100kg, the minimum duty was 5.50 marks. The maximum duty on rye and oats was 7 marks, the minimum was 5 marks. The maximum duty on malting barley was 7 marks, the minimum 4 marks.Tracy, p. 88. In the treaties negotiated afterwards, the minimum rates on grain (which came into force in March 1906) were generally used.Tracy, p. 91. The duty on maize was raised to 5 marks; on flour to 18.75 marks; on butter and cheese 30 marks; on eggs 6 marks; on meat 45 marks; on bullocks, cows and pigs 18 marks and on wine 24 marks.Tracy, p. 88.

In the west, the forest area extends beyond the edge of the Elster Valley and ends southeast of the village Da√ülitz. The northeastern tip of Werdau with the headwaters of the north adjacent Meiselbach goes into the Leubnitzer Waldsiedlung whose undeveloped area before 1945 still belonged to the Tr√ºnzig state forest.:de:Reichsamt f√ºr Landesaufnahme: Me√ütischblatt Nr. 5240, Zwickau. 1910 (Berichtigungen 1937) The forest borders the city of Werdau (Saxony) to the northeast and Greiz (Thuringia) to the southwest. In the middle of the forest there is a clearing, where the settlement Waldhaus is located. The common border of the states of Saxony and Thuringia runs from Teichwolframsdorf going in a north-south direction along a road in the direction of Reudnitz through the forest. Conservation area The former Gera district created a conservation area in the Thuringian part of the forest in 1961. The Werdauer forest on the Saxon side was declared a conservation in 1968 by the administration of the former Karl-Marx-Stadt district.

The bridge was designed by Harvey Dare and built in 1929. The bridge is owned by the Murray River Council and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000 and removed from the register on 2 March 2018. The 1929 bridge is being replaced under the NSW Roads and Maritime Services Timber Truss Bridge Strategy. The old bridge will be demolished as part of the replacement. Work commenced in September 2018 with a targeted completion date of mid-2020.  History  Timber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction. Timber truss bridges were preferred by the Public Works Department from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at Newcastle in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England. Harvey Dare, the designer of Dare truss and other bridges, was a leading engineer in the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW. Timber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \\"timber bridge state\\".  Description  Gee Gee Bridge is a Dare-type timber Allan truss road bridge. It has a single timber truss span of . There are three timber approach spans at one end and two at the other giving the bridge an overall length of . The super structure is supported by timber trestles and provides a dual-lane carriage way with a minimum width of . A timber post and rail guard rail extends the full length of the bridge. In the 1990s strengthening of the timber trestles took place.  Condition  As at 3 June 2005, the condition of the bridge was good. Intact, but timber piers have been strengthened by additional piles. As at the time of removed from the Heritage Register the bridge was described as being in poor condition with \\"no identifiable prospects for transfer, relocation, adaptive reuse or retention as an orphan structure.\\"  Modifications and dates  In the 1990s there was strengthening of the timber trestles.  Heritage listing  The Gee Gee bridge is a Dare-type timber truss bridge, and was completed in 1929. In 1998 it was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Harvey Dare, the designer of this type of truss. Dare trusses were fifth in the five stage design evolution of NSW timber truss road bridges. They were similar to Allan trusses, but contain improvements which make them stronger and easier to maintain. This engineering enhancement represents a significant evolution of the design of timber truss bridges, and gives Dare trusses some technical significance. In 1998 there were 27 surviving Dare trusses in NSW of the 40 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Gee Gee Bridge is a representative example of Dare timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance. The Gee Gee Bridge over Wakool River was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Through the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Harvey Dare, it has historical significance. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has a small amount of aesthetic significance. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Timber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \\"timber truss bridge state\\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The bridge has technical significance because it is a Dare truss, is representative of some major technical developments that were made in timber truss design by the Public Works Department. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Rare - In 1998 there were 27 surviving Dare trusses in NSW of the 40 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Representative of Dare truss bridges.

Blasters was originally released in two versions, named Red Cat Corps and White Dog Squad. The game is a spin-off based on the Blasters mini-game in the main series game Yo-kai Watch 2, and was released in Japan on July 2015 and worldwide by Nintendo in September 2018. Human characters are noticeably absent from gameplay, and players control y≈çkai in a beat 'em up action style instead. The story follows Jibanyan and his Blasters team in stopping Yo-kai shenanigans. Players are to tackle various missions and bosses, and befriend new Yo-kai in the process. The game is intended as a spoof/homage of the Ghostbusters movie franchise, and is named after it in the Japanese release. However, due to copyright and licensing issues, the western release was renamed, and most of the overt references to Ghostbusters were censored (including notable spoofs the Ecto-1 and the Staypuff Marshmallow Man, among others). Versions The spin-offs' commercial success in Japan led to a free expansion, Moon Rabbit Crew, which released in Japan in December 2015 and worldwide in September 2018. In addition, a Japanese-exclusive arcade version, Iron Oni Army, was released in December 2015. Gameplay In Yo-kai Watch Blasters, you can play as Yo-kai; there are only four medal slots in Blasters, in contrast to the six slots in the main series games Yo-kai Watch and Yo-kai Watch 2. The game has three types of missions: Story, Patrol, and Boss Rush (Big Boss in English versions). In all missions, players collect Oni Orbs, an in-game currency used to level up Yo-kai, buy items, make and upgrade equipment, use the Oni Crank- a-kai, etc. In Story Missions, you can progress through the story, to become the best Blaster you can be. There are two types of Story Missions: Main Missions and Sub Missions. As the name suggests, Main Missions are essential to completing the story. In contrast, Sub Missions are generally optional; however, some Sub Missions are essential to progress in the main story. In Patrol Missions, you can explore different towns of your choice; within Springdale, you can choose the location you want to patrol in. Many rare Yo- kai that you are able to befriend spawn here. Players can also perform Mini Missions, which reward players with Oni Orbs. In Big Boss Missions, you can re-fight bosses previously defeated in Story Missions. Each Big Boss Mission has a selectable difficulty level as well. You can fight the bosses in Normal, Super, and Ultra modes, in increasing order of difficulty. Each mission has a distinct set of objectives. These may include collecting items, battling Yo- kai, etc. If all the Yo-kai in your team faint, or the timer runs out, you fail the mission. Every Yo-kai has a role, and each role depends on what your Yo-kai will do throughout the mission: Fighter, Tank, Healer, and Ranger. Plot Characters Sequel A sequel, was also released in two versions, and on December 16, 2017. The sequel games are linkable with the buster games as well as the three versions of Yo-kai Watch 3 Released in Japan. Busters 2 has not been localized into English and possibly never will due to its low sales, mostly negative reception, and the 3DS family ending production in September 2020.

Thomas Harte of Lurgan, County Armagh was executed. Three weeks earlier, Capt. Harte was wounded and arrested during a raid of a meeting of senior IRA men in Dublin.The Free State came to an end with the coming into force of a new constitution on 29 December 1937 when the state took the name \\"Ireland\\". Capt. Harte was the first of six IRA members executed by Ireland forces in Mountjoy Prison and Portlaoise Prison prisons between 1940 and 1944. IRA Volunteers Patrick McGrath of Dublin and Tom Hunt were also arrested at that time and McGrath was executed with Harte (Tom Hunt had his death sentence commuted). They had been arrested after a gun battle with Garda (police) Special Branch in which Sergeant McKeown and Detective Hyland were shot dead. Detective Brady was also wounded (16 August 1940). The topic of the meeting was reportedly planning to support \\"Plan Kathleen\\" which was a notional plan by the Nazis to invade Northern Ireland Mark M. Hull, Irish Secrets. German Espionage in Wartime Ireland 1939-1945, 2003, . Although information is scarce on IRA planning, during this time it was conducting a bombing campaign in England (S-Plan).

In response to the IRA's bombing campaign in England, two bills giving the Government of Eire (the territory formerly known as the Irish Free State) extraordinary powers were introduced in the D√°il (in February 1939). The first of these, called the Treason Act, imposed the death penalty for persons found guilty of treason as defined in Article XXXIX of the Irish Constitution. These Acts provided the legal basis for the execution of both Harte and McGrath. Volunteer Patrick McGrath was a veteran of the 1916 Easter Rising and a bullet remained lodged in his chest from that time. Harte was just 25 years old at the time of his arrest.

Early life Robinson was born on January 3, 1855 to Douglas Robinson Sr. (1824‚Äì1893) and Frances \\"Fanny\\" (n√©e Monroe) Robinson (1824‚Äì1906). He had one sister, Harriet Douglas \\"Missy\\" Robinson, who married an Englishman, the Rev. Henry Bazeley Wolryche-Whitmore, an heir and nephew of William Wolryche-Whitmore, a Member of Parliament who represented Bridgnorth and Wolverhampton in the House of Commons. Robinson's maternal grandparents were Elizabeth Mary \\"Eliza\\" (n√©e Douglas) Monroe and James Monroe, a Virginian born member of the U.S. House of Representatives from New York who was the nephew of 5th President James Monroe. His paternal grandparents were William Rose Robinson and Mary (n√©e Douglas) Robinson, who resided in Scotland. Robinson graduated from Oxford University in Oxford, England in 1876. Career Robinson was a prominent real estate broker and considered \\"one of the leading figures in New York City realty transactions.\\" He served as president of Douglas Robinson, Charles S. Brown Company and the Douglas Land Company. Following the Panic of 1907, he was appointed one of the receivers of the Metropolitan Street Railway Company in 1908. He served as a board member for numerous banks, insurance companies and other corporations including the Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company, the Equitable Life Assurance Company and the Astor Trust Company. Society life In 1892, Robinson, his wife, and father were all included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom.

The bulk of her estate was divided among her three surviving children with smaller bequests made to grandchildren, nephews, friends and institutions. She left all real and personal property she had received from her uncle, Cornelius V. S. Roosevelt to her daughter, Corrine. The household furniture, residue of the property, including $30,000 left to her by another uncle, James King Gracie, was to be shared equally among her children.

It was discovered by astronomer Heinrich d'Arrest on February 14, 1863. NGC 1272 has an active nucleus and is the second brightest member of the Perseus Cluster after NGC 1275. Radio jets NGC 1272 has two radio jets which are powered by an AGN at the center of the galaxy. The jets are bent and have a radius of curvature of ~. The morphology of the jets indicate that the jets are affected by ram-pressure stripping caused by the motion of NGC 1272 though the ICM of the Perseus Cluster. Due to the proximity of NGC 1272 to the center of the Perseus Cluster, the galaxy experiences ram-pressure on an order of magnitude larger than any other bent- double in the cluster and experiences stronger ram-pressure than other bent- doubles outside of the cluster. ISM removal The small bending radius of the jets requires NGC 1272 to have essentially no ISM at radii of ‚àº2 kpc and beyond. The ISM of NGC 1272 may have also been removed though ram-pressure stripping. However, ram-pressure alone cannot remove a fraction of the ISM from deep within the galaxy. Another process, such as AGN feedback in NGC 1272 must have initially removed a large fraction of the ISM before ram-pressure can become effective in removing the ISM. Globular clusters It is estimated that around 12,000 globular clusters surround NGC 1272. SN 2016arc On February 26, 2016 a type Ia supernova designated as SN 2016arc was discovered in NGC 1272.

The German tariff of 1925 was a moderately protectionist law passed by the Reichstag that reintroduced tariffs on agricultural imports into Weimar Germany.

Tariffs on agricultural products had been abolished at the start of World War I to ensure a continuous food supply. There was great controversy over whether protectionism should be resumed for agriculture. Left-wing parties and those representing small peasants opposed protection, with the conservatives and those representing large landowners in favour.Tracy, p. 182. The election of December 1924 led to a coalition government under Hans Luther, with the protectionist DNVP supporting an agricultural tariff.Gessner, p. 765. There also emerged a new solidarity bloc between industry and agriculture that favoured the restoration of protection.Gerschenkron, p. 116. Although the new tariff nominally restored tariff rates similar to the prewar duties on grain, the provisional rates during the transition period were lower: wheat was subject to a duty of 3.50 marks per quintal and rye to a duty of 3 marks.Gerschenkron, p. 117. However, from August 1926 wheat and rye were subject to a duty of 5 marks.Gerschenkron, p. 117. The tariff helped to moderate the fall in prices.Tracy, p. 182.

EU- Alert is the generic term for the European Public Warning Service based upon Cell Broadcast technology. EU-Alert is compatible with Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) formerly known as the Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS) standard as used in the United States. Mobile phone OSes like Android, iOS, and Windows, since 2012 by default support EU-Alert/WEA/CMAS via Cell Broadcast for public warning messages.  EU-Alert standard  The EU-Alert standard (TS 102 900 V1.3.1) as defined by ETSI is the European Public Warning Service using the Cell Broadcast Service as a means of delivering public warning messages to the general public. Specific countries using the EU-Alert service are identified by replacing the letters EU with the Country Identification letters in ISO 3166-1 : * NL-Alert: The national variant of EU- Alert for the Netherlands. * GR-Alert: The national variant of EU-Alert for Greece. * LT-Alert: The national variant of EU-Alert for Lithuania. * RO- Alert: The national variant of EU-Alert for Romania. * IT-Alert: The national variant of EU-Alert for Italy (starting testing in October 2020) Cell Broadcast Centres in Italy are provided by infinite-convergence a white-label CBC partner of Nokia as Nokia does not own a Cell Broadcast System they depend on a third party. EU-Alert/NL-Alert Cell Broadcast message in the area of Venlo, The Netherlands on 7 August 2018 as a result of a large toxic fire Dependent on the country legislation there are 5 types of Public Warning Service (PWS) messages one can receive on the mobile device. They're grouped into Cell Broadcast headings and channels, and include: * Extreme threats: Classified as threats to your life and property, like an impending catastrophic weather event (hurricane, tsunami, typhoon, flooding), disease epidemic warnings or terrorist attacks. * Severe threats: Less serious than the extreme threats, these could be the same types of situations, but on a smaller scale ‚Äî stay safe, but no need to pack up the car and head for the hills. * EU-Amber, AMBER alerts: These are specific alerts aimed at locating a missing child. * EU-Info, Public Safety Messages to convey essential, recommended actions that can save lives or property (e.g. emergency shelter locations or a boil water order). * EU-Exercise, Test messages for national/regional/local purposes. In countries that have selected Cell Broadcast as the technology to submit public warning messages up to 70%- 85% of the population older than 12 year receive the public warning verification message within seconds after the government authorities have submitted the message. See as an example Emergency Mobile Alert (New Zealand), NL-Alert (Netherlands) and Wireless Emergency Alerts (USA). Cell Broadcast is since 2012 supported by the default messaging app in Android, iOS and Windows 10.  EU Legislation  As per 11 December 2018 the Council of the European Union has adopted the new Directive on European Electronic Communications Code (EECC). Under the new Directive, all EU member states will also have to set up a public warning system to protect citizens. This system will send alerts to all citizens and visitors mobile phones in a specific area in the event of a natural disaster, terrorist attack or other major emergency in their area. The mandatory implementation of the public warning system will have to be in place by 21 June 2022 for each EU member state (Full text of the European Electronic Communications Code). Requirements under the Legislation: ''' According to the directive a Public Warning System (PWS) must be able to: * Target the affected population by specific geography so as not to cause widespread panic * Reach a high percentage of people in the targeted area, not just residents but roaming visitors using their native language * Send messages in real-time, within seconds and with a high degree of reliability * Send message without the need for the public to have to opt-in * The transmission of public warning messages should be free of charge for end-users not just residents but also roaming visitors  BEREC guidelines  According to the Article 110(2) EECC, by 21 June 2020, BEREC must publish guidelines on how to assess whether the effectiveness of public warning systems under Article 110(2) EECC is equivalent to the effectiveness of those systems under the Article 110(1) EECC.  Alternative solutions  Possible alternative for EU-Alert to use other electronic communications services, such as location based SMS or apps. However, several conditions must be met according to the new European Electronic Communications Code Legislation: * As efficient as network-based technologies * Reception of the alert should be easy * Information to all visitors entering the country * Transmission of the alert is free to the user * Comply with privacy rules  Downloadable Mobile Applications  There are several downloadable mobile applications on the market that often warn on natural catastrophes; however, these are often not of official, but part of private initiatives that replicate information from state agencies. All downloadable mobile applications have the issue that they are highly affected by traffic load as they require mobile data usage; therefore, especially in case of a disaster when load spikes of data (Social media, Voice and Mobile app) tend to significantly slowdown mobile networks, as multiple terrorist attacks showed. Moreover, downloadable Mobile Apps needs to be downloaded by subscribers and the experience over the years in many countries is that only a fraction of the population will take the effort to download and use an Emergency Mobile app that is only activated a few times in a year. Examples are in Germany with 1.500.000 downloads of the Katwarn and NINA mobile application reaching a maximum of 2.5M people in Germany (<3% of the German population) and France only 500.000 downloads of the SAIP mobile application (<1% of the French population) despite large investments in application development and marketing. In France because of the limited success of the downloadable Mobile App SAIP (Syst√®me d‚ÄôAlerte et d‚ÄôInformation des Populations) the service has been stopped as of June 2018.  Location based SMS  As far as the network and the end user is concerned, a Location-Based- SMS (LB-SMS) message is simply a normal SMS message which is sent to a subset of the Mobile Network's attached devices, which happen to be in a particular geographical area. In order to achieve this for some mobile network topologies however, the network must maintain a database of all mobile devices in the target location for potential Public Warning Service messages. In other words, for all areas that the Mobile anticipates potentially delivering LB-SMS messages into, a list of all users currently located in those areas must be kept up to date at all times. While mobile networks require knowledge of subscribers‚Äô locations for normal operation, this is usually not maintained at all times at the granularity of the single cell level. Therefore, an LB-SMS implementation will usually require the deployment of a Mobile Location Cente (MLC). The methods used by the MLC to track mobile devices as they move around the network are not standardised and are subject to a certain level of inaccuracy. Some MLCs track device location to the cell level, whereas other MLC providers claim to fix device location to a greater level of accuracy. Depending on the level of location granularity stored in the MLC, the precision of targeting will vary. There may be privacy implications in tracking user locations in this manner that should be considered. Aside from the location specific aspect, the principle difference between CB and LB-SMS services is that the mobile network for location based SMS must carry each recipient's message separately, since the SMS standards do not have a ‚Äòone-to- many‚Äô or a broadcast capability. Based upon last years experience the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency concluded in a report published in May 2018 that in case of serious events it's extremely unlikely that Public Warning Messages via SMS will work and will be delivered in a timely manner (less than 1 minute). = Disadvantages = Disadvantages to use location based SMS in national public warning systems are: * No international recognized telecommunication standardization body has defined or will define a standard for location based SMS for Public Warning Services. * Scalability. While mobile networks are dimensioned to carry millions of messages per day, MNOs assume a relatively flat distribution across the network in terms of both time and location. In other words, the average number of messages per second in a given cell is relatively low even in a busy network. In some alerting use cases however (for example notifying all users in a particular area by SMS) it would be possible for the radio access network to be flooded by SMS messages. In this case, messages which cannot be delivered on the first attempt are usually queued up on the MNO SMSC for further delivery attempts. In the worst case, the mobile network could take hours to deliver all queued warning messages. * Delivery time of Location Based SMS warning messages to groups of people in the Geo-target area are long and are depending on the number of people present in the area, it can take up to several hours to reach 300.000 people in a city e.g. in the May 2018 Sweden case and in the September 2019 Portugal case. * Due to the nature of international SMS routing (SMS Home routing). It should also be noted that LB SMS messages will often not reach inbound roamers as delivery of Short code based messages abroad are blocked by the home operator due to roaming charging agreement (AA19). * The granularity of an LB-SMS warning message will depend on the accuracy of the MLC in the MNOs network, usually a single cell which has radius between 3 km and 25 km. * LB-SMS warning messages will not produce notifications sounds or a ringtone and vibration different than an ordinary SMS message, thus end users could easily overlook warning messages. * LB SMS messages can be easily faked and would require the deployment of security devices e.g. SMS firewall on each mobile operator international SS7 signaling links. * When sending an LB-SMS a delivery receipt could be requested upon message submission to the MNOs SMSC. This receipt provides information about the delivery of the message to the end user device only, with no indication whether the message has been read or not. However, these delivery receipt messages may increase the network load for a given alerting event, the impact of which should be considered.

The project calls for extending the Los Angeles Metro E Line (currently the L (Eastside Gold) Line) from Atlantic station further east to Whittier. Overview The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) estimated the cost of both alignments at $6.0 billion in 2015 (to be delivered in 2057). The plan included in the Measure M transportation funding measure is to build improvements in stages. In 2007, Metro issued a Request for Proposals to study alternatives for the route.https://media.metro.net/projects_studies/eastside_phase2/images/factsheet_eastsidephase2_en_2017-11.pdf Construction is scheduled to begin in 2029 and service by 2035, though the project's timeline is expected to be accelerated under the Twenty-eight by '28 initiative. Metro plans to rename the Gold Line east of Downtown Los Angeles to the E Line upon completion of the Regional Connector in 2022. This will allow a one seat ride for travelers as far as Santa Monica, with transfers to other lines at downtown stations. Proposed routings and modes The Transit Corridor Project was originally proposed as a light rail route along Washington Boulevard. Metro studied three alternatives during its Initial Operating Study: along California State Route 60, the original concept to Whittier, and a project that built both routings. The combined routes would have served the communities of Montebello, Commerce, Pico Rivera, Monterey Park, South El Monte, South San Gabriel, Rosemead, Santa Fe Springs and Whittier in the east side of the county. All alternatives begin at the Gold Line's Atlantic Station and head east. Metro ruled out the 60 Freeway and combined alternative, leaving the individual lines for further consideration. A new maintenance yard is included as part of the extension. {  - ! Draft EIR Alternatives ! Description ! New trips (daily) !

Metro would have to buy selective property, remove homes needed for a maintenance facility yard as no large vacant lots were found. In February 2020, Metro staff recommended Alternative 2, removing the route along the SR-60 freeway (Alternative one) from further consideration therefore also eliminating Alternative three in the process.https://thesource.metro.net/2020/02/06/metro-staff-provides-update-on- eastside-gold-line/ Metro will focus on further studying and building the Washington Boulevard alternative.

Romano‚Äôs Red Shack Recording Studio in the Heights has been a key fixture in the Houston music scene since 1989. Early life Roger Francis Romano was born in the Fifth Ward of Houston, Texas, United States. He grew up enjoying music and art and by the age of 13, was already being paid to play guitar. He attended the University of St. Thomas with an interest in art history and painting. John and Dominique de Menil supported his artwork, even matching some of his school grants. The Menils arranged for Romano‚Äôs art to be showcased at Houston‚Äôs Louisiana Gallery, where Romano and his band at the time, The Fun and Games, also played music on the veranda. Music career In 1969, a newly graduated Romano stepped away from painting and into the Houston music scene. During the ‚Äò70s and ‚Äò80s, he joined the crowd of Montrose musicians that included Townes Van Zandt, Guy Clark, Eric Taylor, Richard Dobson, and Don Sanders. Romano created and appeared in a number of short-lived bands over the years, including Little Fitz, the Baroque Brothers, Smokin Fitz, and the New Texas Bluesicians. The Fun and Games, formerly known as Sixpentz and Sixpence, was one of Romano‚Äôs first groups. Fun and Games released its album, Elephant Candy, in 1968. The album‚Äôs most notable singles were ‚ÄúElephant Candy‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Grooviest Girl in the World.‚Äù Romano was also a part of the Natives for a year in the late 1970s. In addition to playing on Herschel Berry and the Natives‚Äô 1981 album New Rock and Roll, Romano also engineered the album. In 1979, Romano, Kenneth Blanchet (formerly of Steppenwolf and the Sherwoods), Michael Knust (of Fever Tree), and Rich Layton founded the big party band, Doctor Rockit. The Sisters of Mercy, Cindy Thrall and Lisa Williams, joined shortly after. When Doctor Rockit first started, the rock group struggled to land gigs. Romano instead threw parties at his own home where the band could play and focused on gaining audiences by word of mouth. Soon, Dr. Rockit and the Sisters of Mercy had hundreds of people in attendance at shows at Anderson Fair, Rockefeller‚Äôs, the Magnolia Ballroom, the Houston Festival at Sam Houston Park \\\\- they even once opened for Bo Diddley at Fitzgerald‚Äôs. The group‚Äôs composition changed frequently, with members coming and going. In 1982, Doctor Rockit and the Sisters of Mercy released their Great Big Fun album with Romano on guitar and vocals; Kip Milwee on bass; Layton on harmonica; Wylie Hudgins on drums; Mike Sumler on piano; and Thrall and Williams providing vocals. The band‚Äôs run concluded in a final show for Romano‚Äôs 40th birthday on February 14, 1985 at Fitzgerald‚Äôs, but the group still reunites every few years - typically on Romano‚Äôs birthday - to perform. Romano continues to perform and tour with other Houston-based musicians, including Trudy Lynn and Steve Krase. Recording career In 1969, Romano started working at Andrus Studios with Frank Davis and Walt Andrus. He engineered demos for a long list of artists that includes Lightnin‚Äô Hopkins, Mayo Thompson, Roy Head, The Glass Kans, and Fever Tree. After Andrus, he worked as head engineer at H&S; recording studios, where he worked with Don Sanders, Richard Dobson, Tom Cummings, and many others. He next worked as chief engineer at Rampart Studios, where he recorded acts including Dickie Malone, Lanier Greig, Jeff and the Kickers, Eric Johnson, and Jimmy Raycraft. After leaving Rampart Studios, he worked with Hank Alrich to set up an 8-track recording studio in the basement of Austin‚Äôs Armadillo World Headquarters. Here, they recorded Freddy King, Captain Beefheart, Buffy Sainte-Marie, NRBQ, and Shiva‚Äôs Headband. In 1989, Romano took over a small recording studio in the Heights and rechristened it the Red Shack Recording Studio. The Red Shack has been a fixture in the Houston music scene since its opening; Romano has since worked with hundreds of artists to record and engineer albums. Through the Red Shack, he has worked with artists including Ally Venable, Steve Krase, Diane Kolby, Pete Mayes, Mayo Thompson, and Richard Dobson. In recent years, he has been involved with the Connor Ray Music label. He produced Trudy Lynn‚Äôs Royal Oak Blues Cafe which reached the No. 1 spot on Billboard‚Äôs Top Blues Albums in 2014. Art Romano has also found success through his visual artwork roots in recent years. In August 2013, the d.m. allison art gallery hosted an exhibition of Romano‚Äôs artwork. It was the gallery‚Äôs most popular exhibition to date - in the month that his paintings were in the gallery, Romano sold all 38, in addition to three extra commissioned pieces.

The dean's church was initially dedicated to St. Nicolas, during the Thirty Years War the dedication changed to St. Giles. The church is a cultural monument of the Czech Republic. History Church foundation Due to a lack of preserved historical sources, it is hard to specify the time of its foundation. Yet historians assume, on the base of the architecture style analysis, connection between foundation of the town and the church origin. The oldest document referring about the town history is a charter of Ottokar II (P≈ôemysl Otakar II) about foundation Nymburk's Dominican monastery at the end of the 13th century. Mendicant monastery foundation probably went hand to hand with origin of the town, a rectory and a church, that days it was the church of St. Nicolas. Therefore, church beginnings are estimated during the reign of Ottokar II and the construction during the reign of his son Wenceslaus II. Special rare technic of fair-face brickwork was probably brought here by town settlers. These settlers, professional town founders, from the north-west Flanders, were commissioned by Ottokar II. Phases The church was constructed in phases, therefore contain couple various styles. The oldest one is an early Gothic presbytery with a pentagonal (octagonal) apse coming from the second half of the 13th century. Into the chancel was an access by a south portal, the portal had a highly profiled Gothic pointed arch. A northern sacristy was also constructed at the same time, as well as a north chapel of Virgin Mary of Vienna. In 1343 the church burned out and was reconstructed. Alongside the reconstruction were probably added basilical naves and a northern brick tower, that tower was called \\"red\\" or \\"old\\". Extension in its final phase was under the control of archbishop Jan Oƒçko of Vla≈°im (Jan Oƒçko z Vla≈°imi). At the turn of the 14th and the 15th century the church was supported by a generosity of burghers, and their gifts. At the reign of the king Charles IV was added a southern tower known as \\"white\\", made of sandstone blocks, and a rectangular shaped chapel of St. Dorothy by the southern face of the chancel. The youngest parts of the church are a southern and a northern porch, both constructed by side entrances around the year 1500. Big impact also had the Thirty Year's War. Tough circumstances deeply influence the town, its citizens and the church too. The town was twice conquered and damaged in the 1630s by Saxony's army. That accident happened on 16 August 1634. When Saxons got occupied the town, they broke through the north gate of the church and murdered almost 200 residents (including women and children) hiding inside. Therefore, is the north entrance no longer in use and closed forever. Nowadays sad happening remains memorial placed on the wall of the church. After the Thirty Year's War, a builder D. Augustin made a Baroque vault over the presbytery and modify the whole structure. (The tower was roofed by Baroque helmets again in the year 1985.) Leopold I financially supported reparations after the fire in 1686. The red tower was couple times struck by a lightning due to burned out and cracks. Thus had to be supported by a large loading pillar. Through the pillar was made a vaulted gate for the passage. During 1846 was demolished part of the brick tower above a crown cornice of the church. In the second half of 19th-century architect Bernard Grueber designed regotisation of the church, yet implemented was just partially by architect Matƒõj ƒåerven√Ω between 1862 and 1866. Architect Josef Mocker joined the reconstruction too. The white ‚Äì southern tower got a thin pyramidal roof and a gallery with a neo-Gothic balustrade. Baroque vault was hidden and replaced with a lower neo-Gothic one. Between years 1913 and 1918 architect Kamil Hilbert led a reconstruction of the church. There was also working academic painter Franti≈°ek Fi≈°er from Prague. Hilbert removed neo-Gothic modifications and restored the church into the original Gothic form. He made a new vault in the presbytery, removed a supporting pillar, opened windows which had been filled, restored, or might designed himself, a window tracery and modify portals. His reconstruction was the last for many years, because the next works on the church took place in the year 1985. That days was restored a fresco altar in the southern nave, a damaged old Spanish tile roof was replaced with copper sheets too. Electrical wiring was repaired by parishioners themselves and than the church was painted. In the 90s the general reconstruction of the tower took place, sponsored by the town and state funds. A trampled tiled floor of the southern nave was replaced in 2003. Around the church was a town cemetery, used until 1787 and finally cancelled in 1821. Today there is a paved square around the church. Architecture Floorplan The church of St. Giles ‚Äì floorplan 1\\\\. Octagonal apse 2\\\\. Presbytary 3\\\\. Chapel of Virgin Mary of Vienna 4\\\\.

Dorothy, southern tower The presbytery The presbytery The presbytery has two vault fields and a five-sided apse, which is recognisable from outside, thank to supporting pillars. There are ten pillars, eight of them made mostly of sandstone blocks, each finished with a small gable roof. There are eight pointed arch shaped windows into the presbytery. Three of them are in the longitudinal walls together with a rosette window. Architect Kamil Hilbert modified them, he reopened windows which had been cancelled during the Baroque adaptation of the church. He rebuilt an original jambs with a double groove and a divided pear shaped shaft. Window traceries consist of trefoils, quatrefoils, five-pointed and six-pointed stars and a rose. Under the roof alongside the presbytery runs the crown cornice with a simple groove. Kamil Hilbert also built a new rib vault in both fields of the presbytery and in the apse. Big ribs uses remains of Tas-de-charges, original springings and corbels. Corbels are designed as a plant plastic ornament. A crossing arch separating the nave from the choir is formed by a wide rectangular strip running continuously to the ground. There is also a pear shaped profile running with the rectangular strip. Its pear shaped capitals have similar character as those in the presbytery. Keystones of the vault are decorated with symbols of Adam and Eve, music and a sign of the town with the year of the vault reconstruction, in the centre. The church of St. Giles, the presbytery ‚Äì interiorThe vault in the presbytery has frescoes called \\"Czech heaven\\" finished in 1915 by artist Artu≈° Scheiner. On the apse vault are visible signs of four evangelists. And in the vault next to the nave are frescoes of cherubs playing on musical instruments. To the presbytery belongs old sacristy and the chapel of Virgin Mary of Vienna. From the outside they are joined as one object and there is no buttress between them. Here is a window with pointed arch and a simple tracery bringing light into the chapel. For lighting up the sacristy there are two windows one with pointed arch and the second one circular. The old sacristy has two fields of the ribbed vault newly built by Kamil Hilbert. By the southern side of the presbytery is located the contemporary sacristy. Light goes inside through couple windows with oblique jambs and tracery. The sacristy has two ribbed cross-vault fields. Ribs there have a wedge profile. Ribs are loaded by canopy corbels. Remains of two frescoes are here and a well-preserved inscription on the wall. Next to the sacristi is a porch, added at the beginning of the 16th century. The porch has a simple late-Gothic portal. The portal was reconstructed in the 20th century, has two masks on the sides by a sculptor Stanislav Sucharda and is finished with a final. In the southern porch was a star rib vault as it was under the white tower, but Kamil Hilbert removed it. Probably the most impressive part of the whole structure is the original southern portal of the presbytery, with its massive pointed arch running deep into the wall. The portal jamb is highly decorated with pear shaped, cylindrical and rectangular profiled shafts. The arch is decorated from the outside with a belt of plastic grapes leaves. In the tympanum above the portal is a sculpture of Ottokar II, made by the sculptor S. Sucharda. From his workshop also came a coat of arms of the Czech kingdom and the town Nymburk, placed on walls in the southern porch. The nave and aisles Another part of the church is a basilical nave with aisles on both sides. The central vessel is lighted up directly. Above the western part of side vessels are built towers. The central vessel has the same height as the presbytery and has ten brick buttresses finished with a small gable roof. The main vessel has nine windows, and one of them goes through west front face wall. Other eight are located in the upper third of side walls. From the outside, all windows has a continuous moulding under them. Below the moulding starts a shed roof of side vessels. Ribs in all four vault fields load a cross vault. There are three keystones with heraldic signs and vegetative motives, one keystone is missing and there is a circular opening left out through the vault. The vault is decorated with a narrow belt of vegetative motives only. Above the porch is the fifth vault field but with a Baroque vault. Today a gallery is extended into an extra field there, and on the internal front face is a fresco probably coming from the 17th century. On the gallery is an organ from the workshop of a crafter Josef Tuƒçek from Kutn√° Hora. Between side vessels and the main nave are arcades. In the north there is the side vessel with three windows and two buttresses joining the central nave. The cross vault has four fields in the row and one separated by a belt because in the past this field load the norther tower. Next to the northern nave was added a square shaped porch with a ribbed vault. The porch was modificated to the chapel during the 17th century. The southern nave has a similar disposition as the northern one, yet the fifth vault field is different. There is a chapel under the white tower. It has a star shaped vault supported by corbels with a figural decor. To the southern nave belongs a square shaped porch from the 15th century with a Late- gothic portal. The portal has an intersecting string in the ogee shape jamb. The porch has an octagonal pyramidal roof. Towers and west front face The tower of the church The northern tower is no longer there except of its remains under the level of the crowning cornice. During the direction of Kamil Hilbert was moved the vault from the southern porch of the presbytery into the first floor of the northern tower. The southern tower has four levels separated by stone mouldings. The tower has two buttresses, buttresses are finished with pinnacles and the Gothic rose at the top. Pinnacles are also at corners of the second and the third floor. In the ground floor is one narrow twin lancet widow. In the first and the second floor are four large pointed windows. Above the third floor was added a cube of the fourth floor in the 20th century. On the forth floor is a room for guardian and four clocks. Around the fourth floor runs a gallery with a stone balustrade. There is only one preserved gargoyle, four others are new. Original is also a belt of tetra- foils under the balustrade and five coats of arms lower. Between the tower and the buttress is a staircase with five small Gothic windows. The staircase is roofed above the first floor by an octagonal stone pyramid. An entrance to the stairs was originally from the chapel under the tower through Gothic portal. The portal has a tympanum with the sign of Nymburk. But the portal is hidden into the wall nowadays. On the west face of the church is a smaller Pseudo- gothic portal, between two towers. The portal is used as the main entrance into the church. The front face is finished with a high gable in the shape of an equilateral triangle. And its upper sides have battlements. The gable consists of belts of blind arcades. Interior The church has many interesting and valuable things inside. The most valuable one is a plastic of the first patron St. Nicolas, made of stone. The plastic probably came from the workshop of a sculptor Peter Parler (the 14th century) but it might be even older than that. Its original place was at the top of the buttress in the south, but today is protected against weather conditions inside. Most of church's equipment is in the Baroque style. The main altar in the front is from 1704. F. M. Kotterbauer the carver from Kutn√° Hora made it. A highly decorated tabernacle was made in 1916 according to the design by Kamil Hilbert. The author of an altar picture is unknown. The picture shows the second patron ‚Äì the hermit St. Giles. Franti≈°ek Ad√°mek made most sculptures inside and the pulpit in the year 1770 too. Other pictures come from workshops of Boroque artists V√°clav and Josef Kramol√≠n (native Nymburk citizens), Jan Montan, J. J. Hentsch, Ign√°c M√ºller and Josef Hellich.

History The Obusier de 155 mm C mle 1881 was one of a series of heavy artillery pieces designed by Colonel Charles Ragon de Bange. On 11 May 1874 three de Bange heavy cannons (120 mm, 155 mm, 240 mm) and two mortars (220 mm, 270 mm) were ordered by the French Army. The mle 1881 was advanced for its time due to being built completely of steel instead of a steel liner and cast iron reinforcing hoops of the previous Canon de 240 mm C mle 1870-87. Design Unlike the earlier Canon de 155 mm L mod√®le 1877, the mle 1881 was designed for short range high angle fire instead of long-range low angle fire. The mle 1881 used a distinctive looking gooseneck shaped box trail, was a breech loaded howitzer with a steel barrel and a de Bange obturator which used separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. The mle 1881 was originally built without a recoil mechanism and in order to traverse the carriage needed to be levered into position before and after each shot limiting the rate of fire. For transport, the mle 1881 could be fitted with a set of removable wooden spoked wheels with steel rims at the front of the carriage. The tail of the carriage was then hooked to a limber and caisson for horse towing. Site preparation included creating a firing platform made of wooden beams which took 2.5 hours to build. First world war Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Fortresses, armories, coastal fortifications, and museums were scoured for heavy artillery and sent to the front. Suitable field and rail carriages were built for these guns in an effort to give their forces the heavy field artillery needed to overcome trenches and hardened concrete fortifications. At the outbreak of the First World War, it is estimated there were 237 mle 1881's available. The mle 1881 was classified as a siege et de place (stationary siege gun) and was assigned to r√©giments d'artillerie √† pied (fortress artillery regiments) for the defense of fortifications. Although designed to be a stationary howitzer for use in fortifications its light weight and removable wheels meant it was often used as a field howitzer. Although the mle 1881 was short ranged it had a reputation for accuracy and its high angle fire meant it could be fired from concealed positions to reduce crew exposure. Variants *En Portee - An unknown number of mle 1881's were mounted on trucks to create mobile artillery pieces. These were mounted on a flatbed truck with the barrel over the cab of the truck. *' - This consisted of mle 1881's installed in revolving iron domed turrets in concrete fortifications at Lucey and other French forts . *Aff√ªt- truck Peign√©-Canet mle 1897 - Was developed by Lieutenant Colonel Peign√© and engineer Gustave Canet at the turn of the century. This conversion involved mounting the guns on variable gauge rail wagons which ran on narrow-gauge tracks at the forts of Verdun, Toul, √âpinal, and Belfort. Each fortress was supposed to have twelve 155 C and eight 120 L guns on the same carriage. These allowed the guns to be quickly re-positioned to different parts of the fort and brought up ammunition and supplies. The guns were mounted on flatbed rail- cars with folding side panels that created a circular base when unfolded, they were also stabilized with four folding outriggers. The guns were mounted on articulated center pivot gun mounts which provided high angles of elevation, 360¬∞ of traverse and an integrated hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism. *Obusier de 155 mm C mle 1881/12 Filloux - A modification program in 1912 gave 108 mle 1881's a new wedge-shaped box trail carriage with a hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism and limited traverse. The new carriage was designed by Colonel Louis Filloux and consisted of a U shaped gun cradle which held the trunnioned barrel. When the gun fired the hydro-buffer slowed the recoil of the cradle which slid up a set of inclined rails on the firing platform and then returned to position by the combined action of the buffers and gravity. The new carriage improved the rate of fire and decreased the amount of setup time due to better weight distribution and less site preparation. The front of the carriage also pivoted to allow 24¬∞ of traverse. *Obusier de 155 mm C mle 1890 Baquet - This field howitzer used the same barrel as the mle 1881 on a new box trail carriage that had two wooden spoked wheels with steel rims and was designed to be light enough to be horse-drawn in one piece. The carriage was split into two parts, a stationary lower part which supported the weapon and a sliding upper part which supported the gun barrel. The upper part was L shaped and the gun barrel was inserted into a cradle with a hydro-pneumatic recoil system below the barrel which connected to the lower portion of the carriage. The cradle and carriage had a hollow center section to allow for high angles of elevation, while the front of the cradle pivoted to allow limited traverse. When the gun fired the cradle recoiled backward, while the lower part stayed anchored. This carriage and recoil system was also used by the less powerful Obusier de 120 mm C mod√®le 1890. The recoil mechanism was not enough to absorb the barrels recoil forces and this made the piece unstable at firing. This style of carriage and recoil system did not find wider acceptance due to its insufficient performance.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. History George Louk was born in Dansville, New York in 1825. In 1847, he purchased 40 acres at this site and settled in to begin farming. In the 1850s, he traveled to California as part of the California Gold Rush; while there, he purchased an additional 40 acres across the road from his Michigan farmstead. He returned to Michigan some time before 1858; in that year he purchased an additional 80 acres, and married Cornelia Lake, the daughter of a Howell-area brick merchant. At some point around this time, Louk constructed a log house near where the present farmhouse stands. The Louks constructed a large barn on the property at some point before 1873. The corncrib and grainery on the farm likely date from the same period. In 1878, the constructed the present farmhouse. In 1900, the Louks sold 100 acres to Spencer and Mary E. Tooley, and moved into the city of Howell. George Louk died in 1903, and his wife in 1916. Spencer and Mary Tooley farmed the property after their purchase from the Louks, but Mary Tooley died of tuberculosis in 1902. Spencer continued to live on the property until his death in 1925, after which the farm passed to his three children: Olive (a daughter with Spencer's first wife Maggie), Fanny, and Jay (both children of Spencer and Mary). Jay and Olive continued to farm the property, with Jay being locally prominent for his breeding of Holstein Friesian cattle. Olive died in 1953, and Jay remained farming the land until 1960, when he sold it to Edward and Judy Hubbel. Jay Tooley died in 1970. The Hubbels continued to own the farm at least through the 1990s. Description The Louk Farm currently encompassed 25 acres, county, is a 25-acre section of a once larger farm. The property includes an 1878 Italianate farmhouse, a barn, corncrib and grainery that predating the house, and a small building that originally housed an electricity source for the farm. The buildings front onto a quiet rural road, with large trees lining the lane. The farmhouse is a two-story clapboard Italianate Upright and Wing structure with a cross gabled roof and a fieldstone basement. A kitchen wing is at the rear. The front facade has two windows on each story in the upright section. A recessed wing is fronted by a porch, which shelters a paneled door flanked by sidelights. A single gable on the roof is above a second-story door, also flanked by sidelights, which opens on the roof of the porch. Windows and doors are topped with triangular pediments. The two-story horse barn is sided with board and batten. and topped with a low gable roof with wide eaves. The barn sits on a fieldstone foundation. A nearby combination corncrib and grainery is of similar construction. A small clapboarded windowless building with shed roof that once held electric machinery is located near the house.

The tool grips the carpet with a set of tines on the head. A force applied to the tool then tensions the carpet and pulls it closer to the wall, where it can be fixed to a tack strip. There are two main types of carpet stretchers: \\"power stretchers\\" and \\"knee kickers\\". Power stretchers apply tension with a lever, and use a pole, typically collapsible, to extend the tensioning force across the room. Power stretchers create more tension than knee kickers, and are used to tension carpeting in large rooms. Knee kickers apply tension using a kick of the knee to the back of the tool. They are used to tension carpet in smaller spaces, such as closets, staircases, and rooms up to square. Failure to properly stretch carpet during installation can lead to the formation of wrinkles over time.

They are staying on the island under refugee status determination, which has led to internal controversy in South Korea.  Background  The number of refugees fleeing the civil war in Yemen and seeking shelter on Jeju Island through its visa-waiver program rapidly increased in the year 2018. No Yemenis requested refugee status on Jeju in the first year of the war, only seven did so in 2016, and only 42 did so in 2017, but in 2018, the number of applications rose to about 500. As of May 2018, 942 foreigners requested refugee status in Jeju and 515 are Yemenis according to Jeju Immigration Office. Worries about security increased within the island in response to the spike, with numerous accusations of Yemenis committing crimes adding to the hostile reception of the asylum seekers. Reflecting the negative public sentiment, a petition was posted on the Blue House website requesting the expulsion of the Yemeni refugees.  Jeju's visa-waiver program  Many of the Yemeni refugees fled to Malaysia first, because Malaysia allows a three-month stay visa-free. Of the few countries which do not require visas for Yemenis, Malaysia was favored as the initial destination, mostly due to the cultural similarities deriving from sharing a common Islamic religious tradition. However, Malaysia is not a signatory of the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention, and therefore avoids the legal obligation to protect the rights of the displaced. As Malaysia prohibited the Yemenis from staying longer, they moved to Jeju Island through the region's visa-free program. Jeju's visa-waiver program was introduced on May 1, 2002 as a part of Special Act on the Development of Jeju International Cosmopolitan City (Korean: Ï†úÏ£ºÌäπÎ≥ÑÏûêÏπòÎèÑ ÏÑ§Ïπò Î∞è Íµ≠Ï†úÏûêÏú†ÎèÑÏãú Ï°∞ÏÑ±ÏùÑ ÏúÑÌïú ÌäπÎ≥ÑÎ≤ï) for the purpose of encouraging more tourists into the island.  Special Entry arrangements for the Jeju island  Special Entry arrangements in Jeju are provided for nationals of all countries not allowed visa-free entry into Korea. The duration is up to 30 days, and the conditions are limited to only those who arrive directly into Jeju Island by flights or ships. In this case, the permitted area or range for the Special Entry is limited to Jeju Island only. In December 2017, budget airline AirAsia began a direct flight from Malaysia to Jeju, which many point to as a contributing factor for increased asylum seekers.  Action  On June 1, 2018, the Korean Immigration Service excluded Yemen from its list of visa waiver countries and inflicted restrictions on Yemeni refugees on Jeju Island that would prevent them from leaving for other parts of South Korea. Jeju Island's government is assisting Yemeni refugees with finding employment in sectors facing labor shortages. The Korea Immigration Service has provided humanitarian assistance and management of refugee applicants while preventing additional Yemeni immigration.

She also supervised the business education curriculum used in Manitoba's public school system and is credited with making business studies a degree course at Manitoba's main university. Background Born in 1917, Dryden grew up on a farm in Manitoba, in the district of Lenore, the oldest of five children. Her parents were John and Mary Dryden. When she was 12 years old, her father died and Dryden helped her mother raise her younger siblings. From the age of six, Dryden taught her brothers and sisters how to read and count. On her first day of school in grade one, she knew she wanted to become a teacher one day. She left home to obtain a teaching certificate from Central Normal School in Winnipeg. Dryden remained single her whole life, seeing as women teachers were not permitted to marry in the 1930s. She however has many nieces and nephews that she stays in touch with through the internet. Career Dryden began her teaching career in 1937, near the rural community of Lenore, Manitoba. She taught at the Errol School, a one-room building with an outhouse and wood stove. She instructed grades one through nine and had additional tasks like preparing lunches and organizing dances. Her next teaching job was at the Bardal School in Sinclair, where she had 45 students. She taught at Bardal, also a one-room schoolhouse, from 1941 to 1942. After dealing with a personal health crisis, she left teaching to pursue a secretarial career in Windsor, Ontario, while attending business classes part-time. After five years of office work, she returned to her former career in 1947, teaching at Two Creeks School and later Virden Public School, both located in her home province. In 1949, Dryden began giving business classes at Virden Collegiate Institute in Virden, Manitoba. She taught courses such as book keeping, typewriting, law, and economics. Among her former students was celebrity entrepreneur Jim Treliving, whose family lived in the area. During her tenure with the high school, Dryden worked on obtaining her university degree in business education. At the time, Manitoba had no graduate programs in business, so she studied during the summer sessions at institutions located in other provinces, such as the University of British Columbia and the University of Alberta. In 1967, Dryden became an administrator for the Manitoba public school system, overseeing the business education curriculum for the Department of Education. She held this position until her retirement in 1983. While there, she also helped define the curriculums for the Industrial Arts and Vocational Industrial programs, as well as being introduced to early computer systems. She learned how to use the room sized mainframes which relied on punch cards and outputted reams of paper filled with data. During the 1970s, Dryden also taught business classes at the University of Manitoba and Red River Community College, as part of a joint Faculty of Education program. As a business educator she published many articles on the subject. Lea Mansell, from Manitoba's \\"Educators of Business Information Technology\\" (EBIT) association, credits Dryden with being \\"the impetus for business education to become a recognized course at Red River Community College and later a degree course in University of Manitoba.\\" Once Dryden retired in 1983, she continued her computer training, keeping up with the latest technological changes such as the introduction of keyboards. She became a volunteer teacher from 1984 until 1996, instructing computer skills to Grade 4 children. She taught at the Salisbury Morse Place School located in East Kildonan, Manitoba. In 1987, she also began giving computer classes to seniors, after realizing how many retirees were scared of technology. She currently teaches four times per week at the \\"Creative Retirement Learning Centre\\" and the \\"Chinese Cultural and Community Centre\\" in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Dryden offers introductory classes in computer technology and Microsoft Office software, as well as explaining how to send emails and stay safe online. She has taught on numerous operating systems, from Windows 97 to Windows 10, while managing the bugs that come with new releases. Keeping pace with technological changes, necessary for her computer classes, has involved plenty of work for Dryden. However, she still enjoys \\"... working with people, and watching them as the learning process goes on.\\" In order to advance, she believes that students need to develop their minds, bodies and spirits. With regards to computers and seniors, she feels that using technology keeps the brain active and also allows retirees to keep in touch with loved ones. Dryden also sees a negative side to new technologies, considering how many people now focus on their cell phones when they could be connecting with others. Awards and Honours In 1996, the \\"Creative Retirement Learning Centre\\" awarded Dryden an honorary lifetime membership for her volunteer work. In 2000, Manitoba's \\"Educators of Business Information Technology\\" (EBIT) established a cash prize in Dryden's name which is still awarded today to business teacher graduates. In 2017, the EBIT also dedicated a special evening to Dryden, honouring her contributions to education. Additionally in 2017, the Manitoba Teachers‚Äô Society honoured Dryden with a special evening and profiled her in their magazine's March issue. That same year, the City of Winnipeg presented her with a Community Service Award and she also received the \\"Sovereign‚Äôs Medal for Volunteers\\" from the Governor General of Canada, Julie Payette.

Work Panofsky's 2014 book, Misbehaving Science, explores the role of controversy in the development of the scientific field of behavior genetics. The book won the 2015 President‚Äôs Book Award from the Social Science History Association. Panofsky also attracted media attention for a study he presented at an American Sociological Association meeting in 2017. The study analyzed 3,070 posts on the white nationalist Internet forum Stormfront in which posters described the results of their genetic ancestry tests. The study identified three distinct ways in which the white supremacists whose tests identified non-European ancestry dismissed and rationalized their results. One of these ways was to accuse the genetic testing companies of being run by Jews, who some white supremacists accused of engaging in a conspiracy to fraudulently manipulate the white supremacists' test results.

She was a member of the Stolen Generations, which were Aboriginal children forcibly removed from their families by the Australian government. Early life Kadibil was born in 1923. Her mother was of the Martu people and her father Thomas Craig was of English descent, making her \\"half-caste\\" in the eyes of the Australian government. In 1931 when Kadibil was about 8 years old, she was removed from her family in the Jigalong Community by the Australian government and sent to the Moore River Native Settlement. Her cousins Molly and Gracie, whose mothers were Daisy's aunts, were also taken from home and sent to Moore River as well. Daisy and Molly shared a father, Thomas Craig, making them both half-sisters and cousins. The girls stayed only one night in the internment camp before making their escape to travel home. Estimates of their journey range from long. The trip took the girls 8 weeks to complete; they used Australia's rabbit-proof fence as a guide to travel north. The journey home was difficult, as the girls had to sleep under bushes or in rabbit burrows. Molly carried each of the younger girls in turn as they evaded search parties sent out by A. O. Neville; they also found their own food. Farmers and hunters aided the girls by giving them food as well. Book based on her experiences Kadibil's niece Doris Pilkington Garimara, who was Molly's daughter, authored Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence, which was published in 1996. Doris had also been sent to the Moore River internment camp, and was not reunited with her mother Molly for 20 years. Later life and death Kadibil worked as a housekeeper and cook on stations in the Pilbara of Western Australia. She married and had four children. She had children in Wiluna, Western Australia, then returned to Jigalong. Members of her family established and still head the Parnngurr Community. She died in a nursing home in South Hedland, Western Australia on March 30, 2018.

I'm Afraid to Go Home in the Dark is a 1930 animated short film which is presented by Max Fleischer and was directed by Dave Fleischer. The film, which was originally released by the film company Paramount Pictures, features a sing-along version of the song \\"I'm Afraid to Come Home in the Dark\\", which was written by Egbert Van Alstyne and Harry Williams and was originally published in 1907. The film also features an early prototype of Bimbo, the same that was used in the Fleischer cartoon Hot Dog, which was released in the same year. Copyright on 30 January 1930, and released the same day, the film is part of the \\"Follow the bouncing ball\\" series entitled Screen Songs. These films would invite the audience to sing the song featured in them. Plot The title card of I'm Afraid To Go Home in the Dark. The film begins with a set of two owls standing on a tree, one of them hooting. Then, a tower clock strikes 3am, with a chicken acting as the cuckoo. Bimbo is then seen leaving a bar. He then notices the owl's hoot and hides in front of the door. Bimbo then, with his legs shaking, tries to jog home whilst whistling the title song. However the owl hoots again and his jog turns into a run. The owl hoots for a third time and Bimbo's run turns into a fast gallop. Bimbo's shadow then comically morphs into a ghost. When Bimbo notices this, he comically hides under his hat, and begins to run in circles. Whilst under his hat, Bimbo attacks and tries to outrun the ghost. Until Bimbo comically hits the ghost on the head and it turns back into a shadow. However, the shadow is sticky, so Bimbo's feet, hands and nose are stuck. During an attempt to free himself. His nose comically falls off. The shadow, then turns back into a ghost and throws Bimbo's nose at Bimbo's face. His nose then becomes the bouncing ball, which is used during the song. What follows is an unnamed poem which is read just before the song starts. The poem's subject is about skeletons and how to scare them. The poem runs thus: When spirits squeak and inspectors creak; And skeleton rowel and roam, When gruesome hosts of spooks and ghosts; Drop out of the ground and moan, When the goblins out to get your skin; And make it into a shroud, The only way to scare 'em is to sing loud-and-loud! A way to scare most anything is to sing out loud! The song, which is \\"I'm Afraid to Come Home in the Dark\\" starts to plays. The song is set to crude drawings which are according to the lyrics and are at the bottom of the screen. After some time, Bimbo reappears, with numerous dogs, and some beaters. He hits the dogs over the head with the beaters, mimicking a xylophone. After that, Bimbo then acts as the bouncing ball, and jumps on the lyrics. His doings at this section are according to the lyrics. His journey through the lyrics ends at his house. Bimbo tries multiple times to enter his property, but however multiple things like the stairs and the door comically move around, so that he cannot enter. The fight ends with the house comically dragging Bimbo inside. Bimbo then starts to yell outside his window. However, Bimbo and his house then comically morphs into a hot dog. The cartoon ends with the hot dog barking.  Characters  In this film, an early prototype of Bimbo is featured as the main character. The same prototype is used on the animated film Hot Dog, which was released in 1930. Other characters include the two owls, whose hooting upsets and distresses Bimbo, and Bimbo's ghost, who Bimbo has a fight after attempting to run home from the bar.  Reception  I'm Afraid To Go Home in the Dark was well received in the cinema magazines at that time. The Motion Picture News said that the film was \\"sure fire stuff\\", and also said the film was \\"Immensely clever\\". Whilst The Film Daily said that the film will \\"provide several minutes of entertainment for any class of folks\\" and also said the film was an \\"Amusing Sound Cartoon\\".

Gulf of Mexico 2017 was a 23-day telepresence-enabled expedition focused on acquiring data on priority exploration areas identified by ocean management and scientific communities. The goal of the expedition was to use remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dives and seafloor mapping operations to increase the understanding of the deep-sea ecosystems in these areas to support management decisions. Many of the areas had no (or low quality) sonar data, these areas were top priority for high-resolution bathymetry collection. The expedition established a baseline of information in the region to catalyze further exploration, research, and management activities. The expedition lasted from 29 November 2017 to 21 December 2017. Through discussions and information stemming from NOAA and other stakeholders, priority areas of exploration had been identified. The expedition explored deep coral and sponge communities, bottom fish habitats, seamounts, undersea canyons, shipwrecks, and a variety of chemosynthetic habitats including cold seeps, mud volcanoes and brine pools. Using NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer‚Äôs unique capabilities, scientists and other audiences onshore were provided with real-time video footage from deep-water areas in important, yet largely unknown, U.S. waters. ROV Dives Fish experts on the global midwater team were blown away by the appearance of this fish from the genus Leptochilichthys. The observation placed this fish at a shallow depth of 900 meters, when typical observations place this fish squarely in the bathypelagic zone at ~2,000 meters. 17 ROV dives were conducted from 300 to 2,321 meters of depth to explore the diversity and distribution of deep-sea habitats and associated marine communities in the Gulf of Mexico basin. There were also four midwater exploration dives conducted at depths of 300 to 900 meters to investigate the diversity and abundance of the largely unknown pelagic fauna. During these dives hundreds of different species of animals were observed including several potential new species. Several significant range extensions were observed and several organisms were seen alive for the first time. 105 biological samples (32 primary and 73 associated and commensal taxa) were collected several of which came from unknown species. As well as biological samples eight rock samples and one sediment sample were collected for use in geochemical composition analysis and age dating. Several dives gathered geological data to better understand the geological composition and origin of the Florida Escarpment. At least 20 previously unknown chemosynthetic habitats were discovered including methane seeps (some with visible methane hydrate), asphalt seeps, and brine rivers. Most of these had associated chemosynthetic communities that included large siboglinid tubeworm bushes and extensive mussel beds. There were also many areas of reduced sediments and bacterial mats. Asphaltic and authigenic carbonate outcrops hosting large filter-feeding communities were also observed in geologically active areas. A number of the ROV dives surveyed Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPCs) proposed by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council. These surveys collected baseline information for management of the area. Six proposed expansions zones to the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary were explored and surveyed to gather information on future expansion of the sanctuary. Many high-diversity and density coral and sponge communities were discovered in these areas including a Madrepora oculata-dominated coral garden. During Dive 7, Deep Discoverer explored an unknown shipwreck identified by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management simply as ‚ÄúID Number 15377.‚Äù . The wreck of an early 19th- century copper-clad merchant vessel carrying artifacts including glass bottles, ceramic and porcelain vessels, remnants of a suction bilge pump with cast-iron flywheels, an anchor, and a cast-iron stove was surveyed and explored. Based on initial observations, archaeologists believe the shipwreck likely post-dates 1830 and may have been a merchant ship built for distance over speed. During one of the dives Enypniastes eximia was spotted on the ocean floor. Gas Hydrate Dive 17 explored the northwest part of Horn Dome, a salt-cored bathymetric high that had been the focus of several previous remotely operated vehicle dives. megapascals. During dive 17 the ROV Deep Discoverer encountered large gas hydrate mounds and active gas seeps on the sea floor on the northwestern edge of a salt-cored Horn Dome, 87 kilometers from the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana. The low relief seafloor mounds discovered mantled gas hydrate deposits interspersed with carbonates. Gas hydrate forms when low molecular weight gas (usually methane) combines with water and freezes to form \\"methane ice\\" under low temperature and moderate pressure conditions. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the ample supply of gas, coupled with appropriate pressure and temperature conditions, cause gas hydrate to form on or just beneath the seafloor. The blue curve on the graph shows the ocean temperatures measured by the conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensor on the Deep Discoverer ROV during Dive 17 at Horn Dome. The sediment temperatures are estimated based on a study that examined nearby well data. Gas hydrate is stable at the seafloor, in the shallow sediments, and from the seafloor to ~600 meters depth in the water column. Such conditions are typical for the deep ocean, but the Gulf of Mexico leaks such large volumes of gas that near-seafloor gas hydrate is more common there than in most locations. Scientists observed dense orange-stained gas hydrate exposed in several mounds. In some places, the same outcrop had both massive gas hydrate that had probably formed below the seafloor and clear, porous gas hydrate made up of hydrate-encased bubbles. Video recording of methane emissions adjacent to one of the massive hydrate deposits provided insights into seafloor gas dynamics. For example, rapid gas emissions produced bubbles, with some bubbles emerging from clear tubes formed from gas hydrate. Slow gas emissions led to the formation of hydrate-coated gas droplets that initially blocked the gas conduit until the pressure inside the droplet increased, causing the droplet to detach. Similar phenomena were filmed on bare seafloor in the Gulf of Mexico during a 2014 Okeanos Explorer expedition. Pink \\"ice worms\\" are visible beneath the overhang in the center left part of this photo. The only macrofauna spotted living directly on methane hydrate outcrops were ice worms, Hesiocaeca methanicola. The ice worms had burrowed into the hydrate, creating small depressions. The worms graze on bacteria growing on the hydrate. Ice worms were also seen in some of the burrows in the surrounding gas hydrate, which appears orange due to impurities. In the image to the right active methane emissions occur from beneath the ledge, through conduits at the base of the inverted droplets attached to the sediment and through a bubble tube at the right of the image. Both the bubble tubes and the inverted droplets are encased in clear gas hydrate. Outreach The live video feeds of the expedition were shared publicly worldwide with the live video receiving more than 280,000 views via the NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research (OER) YouTube channel. The expedition also conducted six live telepresence interactions with various groups including the Aquarium of the Pacific, Shedd Aquarium, NOAA Gulf Regional Council, University of New Hampshire‚Äôs Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping, The Exploratorium, and members of the MIT Media Lab.

Built about 1760, it is one of a small number of surviving 18th-century houses in the city. It has been operated by the local historical society as a museum property since about 1940. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history The Moses Andrews House stands on the western fringe of downtown Meriden, on the south side of West Main Street. It is in a heavily developed area, surrounded by modern commercial development and a public school. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a central chimney, gabled roof, and clapboarded exterior. Its rear roof line extends to the first floor, giving it a saltbox profile. At both the second floor at attic gable level there are slight overhangs. The main facade is five bays wide, with windows arranged symmetrically around a center entrance. The entrance is framed by a 19th- century surround, with pilasters and a simple dentillated projecting cornice above. The interior follows a typical central chimney plan, with a narrow entrance vestibule that also houses a winding staircase. Many of the interior finishes are original, including fireplace surrounds, flooring, and period door hardware. With The house was built about 1760 by Samuel Andrews, and was later inherited by his son Moses. Moses was a prominent figure in Meriden during the American Revolution: distrusted as a possible Loyalist due to his Anglican faith, he was forbidden to attend church in Wallingford, and ended up hosting Anglican (and later Episcopalian) services in his home. After his death, the house passed out of the family, and was purchased by the city in 1926, mainly for the surrounding land, on which the school was built. About 1940 a citizens' committee was formed to oversee its care, which eventually merged with the local historical society.

History To keep pace with these continuous changes it was early recognised that fresh provision must be made for the technical and scientific training of officers and men. Up to 1854, Naval Cadets, upon nomination, went at once, as a rule, to sea-going and regularly commissioned ships, where they had to pick up their professional education as best they could from the Naval Instructors and other officers who were their shipmates. In 1854 an improvement was made by the commissioning at Portsmouth of an old wooden ship of the line, the Illustrious, Captain Robert Harris, as a stationary training ship, or school, for Naval Cadets. A similar school was opened in the Implacable, at Devonport, in 1855; but one school was soon found to be enough for the purpose, and the Devonport establishment was closed. New regulations for the entry and training of Naval Cadets were issued in 1857 1; and on 1 January 1859, the Britannia, 120, 2 was commissioned at Portsmouth by the same Captain Robert Harris to take the place of the less suitable Illustrious. She was removed to Portland in 1862, and to more appropriate moorings at Dartmouth on 30 September 1863; and although the original Britannia was later condemned, a new Britannia, previously known as the Prince of Wales, 3 took her place in July 1869, and retained it until the end of the nineteenth century, at which time, however, preparations were in progress for the removal of the whole establishment to quarters on shore hard by. In 1870, the Trafalgar, 60, screw, was commissioned as a sea-going training-ship for cadets; and the Bristol, 31, Aurora, 28, and other vessels were subsequently used for the same purpose until the establishment of the regular Training Squadron in 1885. Something has been written already 4 concerning the origin of the naval gunnery schools at Portsmouth and Devonport. At Portsmouth the establishment was housed afloat for many years in the Excellent (ex-Boyne, built in 1810), and subsequently in another Excellent (ex-Queen Charlotte, built also in 1810). In 1891, however, when barracks, practice-batteries, etc., had been erected on Whale Island, a piece of made land in Portsmouth Harbour, the establishment was transferred to the shore and housed in the commodious new buildings. The education of the boys was continued, at one time in the flying squadrons which were temporarily organised, and afterwards in the regularly constituted Training Squadron, which, only in the last year of the century, was modernised and made to consist exclusively of mastless ships.

Riley dedicated her career to social justice reform, where her proposed \\"equal management\\" in reference to community property law was adopted by the Louisiana legislature in 1978 and formally incorporated into the Civil Code in 1980. In addition, Janet Mary Riley heavily involved herself with activism regarding the civil rights movement. Education Riley obtained a B.A. from Ursuline College, the sister college to Loyola University New Orleans and, years later, a B.S. in Library science from Louisiana State University. She later earned a law degree from Loyola University New Orleans College of Law and an L.L.M from the University of Virginia. Academic and legal career Riley taught in the New Orleans Public School System for a short time following her first college degree. After receiving her Library science degree, she became a librarian at the New Orleans Public Library and later an assistant at Loyola's library. During World War II , Riley, like many other women at the time, supported her community by joining the war's cause. She became a librarian in the special services, and returned to her job at Loyola after the war. In 1945 she began to oversee Loyola's law library , also taking law courses in the evening, graduating with a J.D. in 1952 and being admitted to the bar in 1953. She was then was offered a position as law faculty, but at a lower salary than what she'd made as a librarian. Riley took the job as she would be on a 10 month salary (instead of 12) and could aspire to professor status, whereas as a librarian she could only hope to reach assistant professor. She was subsequently hired as a full-time law professor, making her the first female law professor in New Orleans, and only the seventh in the nation. As a professor, Riley encountered sexist behavior from her male legal students, who did not expect to see a woman in the classroom, as well as from colleagues, where she would often hear an opinion she'd expressed (and that had been ignored) later lauded when it came from another (male) colleague. Riley served on the legal team that defended four people, three of them African-American, who were arrested for sitting at a \\"whites only\\" lunch counter at McCrory's in 1960. Riley wrote the brief for the case, Lombard vs. Louisiana, and it was eventually overturned by the Supreme Court, setting a precedent for striking down segregation laws and practices. In 1971, after she began to teach Community property law, Riley published the case book Louisiana Community Property: Cases and Material on Louisiana Property Law of Marriage. As a result, in 1973 she was asked to chair the subcommittee studying the matrimonial regimes section of the Louisiana Civil Code. At the time, the Louisiana Civil Code \\"Head and Master\\" rule gave the husband sole control over community property. Riley actively campaigned for change in the law, speaking to women's groups and at conferences. The Equal Management Law was eventually passed in 1979, and took effect in 1980. Activism In addition to her legal work concerning Community property and segregation, Riley also volunteered with the Civil Rights Movement. She served on the Commission on Human Rights of the Catholic Committee of the South, led by Jesuit sociologist, author, social reformer, and Loyola colleague Joseph H. Fichter, S.J. The Commission helped implement the 1953 Archdiocese's order forbidding any further racial segregation in Catholic Churches. In 1947 she served on the Board of Editors for the Louisiana Library Association Bulletin, where she advocated for the admission of African American librarians without limitation to the association. She was also a member of the Community Relations Council, a bi- racial group focused on the integration of public spaces such as playgrounds and restaurants in New Orleans. Personal life Riley was a member of a pontifical secular institute called The Society of Our Lady of the Way where members took vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Legacy Loyola University New Orleans established the Janet Mary Riley Distinguished Professorship in 2002 from funds donated by Riley and her colleagues. On May 13, 2005, Riley received an Honorary Degree from the Loyola University New Orleans College of Law. Riley's personal papers are held at the Loyola University New Orleans Special Collections & Archives. Riley's life and work were the subject of an exhibit, \\"Janet Mary Riley: A Voice for Social Justice in Louisiana,\\" in Special Collections & Archives; a lecture by historian Janet Allured, \\"Janet Mary Riley: An Angel With Teeth;\\" and a \\"Letters Read\\" event.

He is most noted as commanding officer of 22nd Marine Regiment during the Recapture of Guam in July 1944, for which he received the Navy Cross, the United States military's second-highest decoration awarded for valor in combat. Early career Lemuel C. Shepherd (left) speaks with members of his staff during a planning meeting prior to the Guam operation. Next to him is 1st Brigade Chief of Staff John T. Walker, Alan Shapley (4th Marines) and Merlin F. Schneider (22nd Marines). Merlin F. Schneider was born on February 22, 1901, in Clatskanie, Oregon, and attended high school there. He accept appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, and graduated on June 7, 1923. During his time at the academy, he was active in football team and also served as chief petty officer of 4th Midshipman Battalion. Many of his classmates became general officers later: Arleigh Burke, Harry D. Felt, Merrill B. Twining, Charles F. Coe, George F. Good Jr., John B. Moss, Frederick Moosbrugger, Stanhope C. Ring, Thomas B. Williamson, William D. Anderson, Murr E. Arnold, John G. Crommelin, Paul F. Dugan, William H. Hamilton, Francis M. Hughes, Joseph L. Kane, William G. Manley, Henry G. Moran, Richard M. Oliver, Edwin R. Peck, John V. Peterson, William T. Rassieur, William J. Scheyer, Francis E. Shoup Jr., Curtis S. Smiley, Frederick C. Stelter Jr., Frank D. Weir, Ralph W.D. Woods, Howard L. Young, Richard M. Cutts Jr., Samuel G. Fuqua, Ira L. Kimes, Frank H. Lamson- Scribner or Henry A. Schade. Following the graduation, Schneider was commissioned second lieutenant in the Marine Corps and ordered to the Basic School at Philadelphia Navy Yard for further officers education. He completed the school one year later and was stationed at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, until late 1926, when he was ordered for his first expeditionary duty. Schneider was attached to the First Marine Brigade under Brigadier General John Twiggs Myers and sailed for Haiti in order to support government forces against the Cacos rebels. He spent two years in the Caribbean and returned to the United States in 1928. After two-year assignment at Marine Barracks Parris Island, South Carolina, Schneider was ordered to China with 4th Marine Regiment in 1930 and served for next three years with American Legation in Peking and Shanghai. In summer of 1933, he was ordered back to the States and assumed duties at Marine Corps Institute in New York, before he was transferred to Washington, D.C., for duty at Headquarters Marine Corps. Schneider, who was already promoted to the rank of captain, was appointed commanding officer of the Marine detachment aboard the battleship USS New Mexico in 1938 and took part in the patrol cruises off coast of Hawaii. World War II In 1940, Schneider was attached to the staff of Fleet Marine Force under the command of Major General William P. Upshur and participated in the Caribbean exercise. He was promoted to the rank of major during his service in this capacity. When the 22nd Marine Regiment was formed at the beginning of June 1942 at Camp Elliott, Schneider was appointed commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion and sailed for Pacific area on June 18. He was stationed at Tutuila, American Samoa and took part in the garrison duty until May 1943, when the regiment was transferred to Wallis Island for island defense and small unit training. Schneider was promoted to the rank lieutenant colonel and appointed executive officer under Colonel John T. Walker. He served in that capacity during the Eniwetok operation in the Marshall Islands at the end of February 1944 and following the promotion to the rank of colonel during the next month, he was appointed commanding officer of 22nd Marines. Schneider led his regiment during the recapture of Guam in the Marianas in July 1944 and distinguished himself during that operation. He was decorated with the Navy Cross, the United States military's second-highest decoration awarded for valor in combat. His official Navy Cross citation reads: Upon the formation of 6th Marine Division under Major General Lemuel C. Shepherd Jr. at the beginning of September 1944, Twenty Second Marines were attached to that division and took part in the eight-month training on Guadalcanal. Following that period, Schneider led his regiment to Okinawa in April 1945 and took part in the landing on Green Beach. He led his regiment during the fierce fighting and participated in the capturing of northern portion of the island. However Schneider became overcautious and general Shepherd pointed several times on slow advance of 22nd Marine Regiment and criticized that Schneider stayed mostly on the regimental command post and not on the frontlines with his battalions. Schneider was relieved without prejudice on May 16, 1945, and succeeded by Colonel Harold C. Roberts from the Divisional staff. General Shepherd thought, that Schneider who served in the Pacific area nonstop since June 1942 need rest. He decorated Schneider with Bronze Star Medal with Combat \\"V\\" and ordered back to the United States. Later life Following a vacation with his family, Schneider returned to service and remained on active duty until 1948. He subsequently retired after 25 years of active service and was advanced to the rank of brigadier general on the retired list for having been specially commended in combat. He settled in Mesa, Arizona together with his wife Catherine and died there on November 15, 1970. Their both sons attended United States Naval Academy, and Richard Dana Schneider was killed in action in Korea in 1952. Their second son, Merlin Jr., was badly wounded during the recapture of Seoul in September 1951 and resigned from the service. Decorations Here is the ribbon bar of Brigadier General Merlin F.

The gunman, Jarrod Ramos, shot and killed five employees with a shotgun; two others were injured while trying to escape. Ramos was arrested shortly thereafter. He has pleaded guilty to 23 charges and is currently imprisoned while awaiting trial for the shooting. The newspaper published an article in 2011 about Ramos's being put on probation for harassing an acquaintance from high school through social media and email. Ramos, angered by the article, brought a defamation lawsuit against The Capital but a judge later dismissed the suit. Ramos is alleged to have sent enraged letters and messages to the newspaper's offices threatening to attack the office and its staff but no legal action was taken after the threats were received. Capital Gazette Communications, owned by Tribune Publishing through its subsidiary the Baltimore Sun Media Group, publishes the daily The Capital and the Maryland Gazette newspapers and the weeklies Bowie Blade-News and Crofton-West County Gazette. Its offices were located at 888 Bestgate Road in Parole, an unincorporated area of Anne Arundel County just outside Annapolis (the place name assigned by the U.S. Postal Service for addresses in this area). As of September 2020, the newspaper has become permanently virtual with no physical headquarters. Incident Around 2:34 pm (EDT), the Anne Arundel County Police Department reported that a shooting began resulting in five fatalities and the wounding of several other victims. Before the shooting, the gunman had barricaded the rear exit of the office to prevent people from escaping. Sources reported that the weapon was a \\"long gun\\" which would later be described as a 12-gauge Mossberg 500 pump-action shotgun. Police later said that the long gun had been purchased legally some time within the eighteen months prior to the shooting. The gunman used the weapon to fire repeatedly after shooting out the office's glass door. Phil Davis, a courts and crime reporter at the site of the shooting for The Capital, tweeted that the gunman \\"shot through the glass door to the office and opened fire on multiple employees.\\" Davis also described the newspapers' offices as a \\"war zone\\" after the shooting and described hearing the gunman reload. He said the male gunman was alone. During a pause in the shooting, survivors moved to take refuge between filing cabinets, with some claiming victim Wendi Winters confronted the gunman, causing the pause. One survivor stated that Winters charged the gunman with a trash can and recycling bin, screaming at him, distracting him long enough for survivors to escape before she was killed. Several injured victims were sent to the Anne Arundel Medical Center for treatment. County police evacuated 170 people from the building to a reunification center set up at the nearby Westfield Annapolis shopping center. The police reportedly had a one-minute response time, and interviewed survivors in the criminal investigations unit of the Anne Arundel County Police Department. The police discovered the suspect underneath a desk in the office, and surveillance within the office documented the incident and helped identify Ramos as the perpetrator. An indictment handed down on July 20, 2018, included five counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted first-degree murder, six counts of first-degree assault, and 11 counts of the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony.  Victims  Five people were killed and two others were injured in the attack. Those killed were: * Gerald Fischman, age 61, columnist and editorial page editor for The Capital. * Rob Hiaasen, age 59, assistant editor and weekend columnist for The Capital. * John McNamara, age 56, sports reporter for The Capital and editor and primary reporter for The Bowie Blade-News * Rebecca Smith, age 34, sales assistant who just started working for Capital Gazette Communications * Wendi Winters, age 65, community beat reporter and special publication editor for The Capital According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, the Capital Gazette shooting was one of two incidents in which multiple journalists were killed in the United States since the organization began compiling data in 1992. The other incident was the murders of Alison Parker and Adam Ward during a live television interview in 2015.  Suspect  Jarrod Warren Ramos (born December 21, 1979), age 38, was captured by police and taken into custody as a suspect, but refused to identify himself. Early reports said that the gunman mutilated his fingertips to avoid identification, but a law-enforcement official later stated that an issue with the fingerprint machine had caused the difficulties in identifying the suspect, and that his fingertips had not been mutilated. The suspect was also carrying a backpack with smoke bombs, flashbang devices, and grenades. The police later announced that the attack had been targeted specifically at Capital Gazette Communications. In a court filing, Ramos stated he had seen five mental health professionals for at least 75 visits before the shooting, and exhibited a pattern of threats. Many of those around Ramos believed him to be a calculated, manipulative loner, who would become angry when things did not go his way, with those afflicted by him convinced he would one day hurt someone. None of Ramos's immediate family responded to requests for comment and other relatives have stated that they have not had contact with him for several years.  Previous dispute with newspaper  In 2012, Ramos sued The Capital in a defamation case he brought over a 2011 newspaper article reporting on his guilty plea for criminal harassment. After multiple appeals from Ramos, the defamation case against the newspaper was dismissed in 2015 by Prince George's County circuit court judge Maureen M. Lamasney, who ruled in favor of the paper because their reporting was based on publicly available records and Ramos had produced no evidence that the article was inaccurate. Lamasney wrote in her court opinion that Ramos's complaint was \\"a fundamental failure to understand what defamation law is, and more particularly, what defamation law is not\\". Former Capital editor and publisher Thomas Marquardt said Ramos began harassing the staff of the newspaper after the article on him was published in 2011. In 2013, Marquardt contacted the Anne Arundel County Police Department about Ramos's behavior, but the department did not pursue the report. Marquardt also consulted the newspaper's attorneys about filing a restraining order against Ramos, and recalled telling them, \\"This is a guy who is going to come in and shoot us.\\" After his lawsuit against the newspaper was dismissed, Ramos opened a Twitter account, which he used to attack the newspaper and taunt its owners and staff. A former FBI senior profiler speculated that Ramos was \\"an injustice collector,\\" whom she described as \\"someone who goes through life...collect[ing] injustices, real or imagined.\\" Ramos reportedly previously sent threatening letters to the newspaper's former attorney, to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals, and to Charles Moylan, Jr., the appellate judge who had ruled against Ramos in his defamation case.  Other lawsuits  Ramos's use of the criminal justice system as a form of attempting to get his way was seen in at least two other cases. When he was dismissed from his job at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, over \\"suitability concerns,\\" he sued the agency and won the case, yet was still dismissed from the agency. In 2009, a former classmate took out peace orders (used to prevent contact between people), followed by criminal harassment charges, which he lost. In an affidavit, the harassment victim wrote, \\"I am physically afraid of Mr. Ramos, and that he may cause me serious physical injury and/or death.\\"  June 28 letters  On Thursday, June 28, police reported that Ramos sent letters to three people who had been involved in his defamation lawsuit, with a packet being received by The Capital's former attorney that included a letter addressed to Judge Moylan, who wrote the opinion upholding the dismissal of his defamation case. In it, he wrote, \\"Welcome, Mr. Moylan, to your unexpected legacy: YOU should have died...Friends forever, Jarrod W. Ramos.\\" The letter continues; \\"I further certify I then did proceed to the office of respondent Capital-Gazette Communications...with the objective of killing every person present.\\" One of the letters thought to have been written by the suspect was published by other news sources. Reactions Law enforcement in other locations Police were also sent to the offices of The Baltimore Sun, which owns Capital Gazette Communications, as a precaution, although no threat was registered there. The New York City Police Department also deployed counter-terrorism units to the headquarters of major news outlets in New York City as a precaution against similar attacks. The Chicago Police Department took similar actions.  Political  President Donald Trump was briefed on the shooting and offered his thoughts and prayers by tweet. He later declined to lower US flags to half-staff, as is custom for mass shootings, despite requests from Annapolis mayor Gavin Buckley and the lowering of Maryland flags by the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan. On July 3, the White House was reported to have permitted the lowering of the US flags on federal buildings for the day, with the President then issuing a proclamation for the flags to be lowered nationwide until sunset on July 3. Some commentators have called the shooting an attack on the media, and framed it alongside comments by Trump that the \\"fake news media\\" (The New York Times, The Washington Post, ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC News) are the \\"enemy of the people\\". A Reuters journalist apologized for his comments blaming Trump. Reuters said it did not condone his behavior. The Sunday after the shooting, the staff of the Capital Gazette wrote: \\"We won't forget being called an enemy of the people.\\" Days before, right-wing commentator Milo Yiannopoulos wrote that he \\"can't wait for vigilante squads to start gunning journalists down on sight\\" in text messages to reporters. After the shooting, Yiannopoulos said the texts were just a joke. On Reason.com, Elizabeth Nolan Brown criticized the media response to the shooting, pointing out that \\"[Ramos'] motive doesn't seem related to any of the political agendas offered up in the immediate aftermath by hacks and provocateurs,\\" and that the shooter's anger against the newspaper derived from a personal grudge rather than political motivations. Similarly, the Franklin Daily Journal wrote \\"the shooting had nothing to do with Trump or his ongoing battle with the press [...] the crisis in Maryland allowed people to criticize political opponents who had nothing to do with the actual events.\\" Governor Hogan tweeted that he was \\"[a]bsolutely devastated to learn of this tragedy in Annapolis,\\" and asked residents to \\"heed all warnings and stay away from the area.\\" In a press conference, he praised local law enforcement for responding within 60 seconds. In March and April 2019, the Maryland General Assembly voted unanimously to designate June 28 \\"Freedom of the Press Day\\" in honor of the victims.  Journalism  After the shooting, Justin Dearborn, the chairman and CEO of Tronc, said: \\"We are focused now on providing our employees and their families with support during this tragic time. We commend the police and first responders for their quick response.\\" The owner of the Capital Gazette created a fund for the families, victims, and survivors of the shooting, in addition to a scholarship memorial fund for journalism students. A separate GoFundMe fundraiser, created by a Bloomberg Government reporter hit the initial target and has grown to almost $200,000 by July 1. Reporters for The Capital and Gazette began coverage of the shooting as it happened, from the newsroom and while returning from the field. Despite the shooting, journalists and staff at The Capital insisted on putting out the next edition of their paper only hours after the fatal shootings. The edition's opinion page was left blank to commemorate the victims, with the exception of a small note stating that the staff members \\"are speechless.\\" The Capital published an editorial on July 1, 2018, signed by its entire staff of reporters and editors, thanking the citizens of Annapolis and Anne Arundel County for their support following the shooting. In December 2018, the staff of Capital Gazette Communications was selected as a recipient of Times Person of the Year 2018, as one of \\"The Guardians,\\" a collection of journalists from around the world in their fight for the \\"War on Truth.\\" On April 2, 2019, the News Leaders Association selected the staff of the Capital Gazette and The Baltimore Sun as the winners of the Al Neuharth Breaking News Reporting Award for their coverage of the shootings. The Capital Gazette staff were also named as finalists for the Burl Osborne Award for Editorial Leadership - Small, and the Visual Journalism Award - Small. The Capital was awarded a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation on April 15, 2019, to \\"...honor the journalists, staff and editorial board of the Capital Gazette, Annapolis, Maryland, for their courageous response to the largest killing of journalists in U.S. history in their newsroom on June 28, 2018, and for demonstrating unflagging commitment to covering the news and serving their community at a time of unspeakable grief.\\" The citation also included a $100,000 bequest \\"to further the newspaper's journalistic mission,\\" and the editorial staff were named as finalists for the Pulitzer Prize in Editorial Writing.  Vigils and memorials  Colleagues, friends, and family members of the deceased victims held a candlelit vigil on the streets of Annapolis on June 29 to honor the deceased. Capital Gazette reporter Phil Davis read the names of the deceased, and told the crowds that they were here \\"to honor who (the victims) were and what their families did not have to go through.\\" On July 2, Annapolis mayor Gavin Buckley announced that the city planned to hold a summer music festival that will act as a celebration of the freedom of the press and as a memorial for the journalists who were killed. The concert was held on July 28 under the title Annapolis Rising: A Benefit for The Capital Gazette and Free Press. The event featured performances by the rock bands Good Charlotte and Less Than Jake, a presentation by comedian Jordan Klepper, and a speech by Washington Post editor-in-chief Martin Baron. Proceeds from this event will be used to benefit a fund established for the victims and survivors, as well as journalism scholarships. On July 3, the equipment manager of the Washington Capitals, the 2018 Stanley Cup champions, brought the Stanley Cup to the Capital Gazette's temporary office to boost the employees' morale.  Trial  In July 2018, Jarrod Ramos was indicted on 23 counts by Anne Arundel County prosecutors. Ramos was charged with five counts of first-degree murder; one count of attempted first-degree murder, for shooting at photographer Paul Gillespie; six counts of first-degree assault related to the attacks on Gillespie, staff writers Selene San Felice, Phil Davis, and Rachael Pacella, reporting intern Anthony Messenger, and sales associate Janel Cooley; and 11 counts of using a firearm in the commission of a felony or violent crime. During his bail hearing, Ramos did not speak. He was ordered to be held without bail after he was determined to be a flight risk and a danger to the community, and was placed on suicide watch while in custody of law enforcement. The case was assigned to Circuit Court Judge Laura S. Kiessling, who became Judge Laura Ripken upon marrying Cal Ripken Jr. in October. On August 20, 2018, Ramos was seen in court for a brief hearing, where he pled not guilty to all charges, with a deadline of October 24 for his lawyers to enter a revised plea. The trial date was set for January 15, 2019, although this was later delayed to June 3, 2019. On April 4, 2019, Circuit Court Judge Michael Wachs further delayed the trial to November 4, 2019, partially in recognition of what Ramos's attorneys described as a \\"jaw dropping\\" quantity of relevant material to review. On April 29, 2019, the date of the extended deadline, Ramos entered a plea of not guilty and not criminally responsible, and the judge ordered that he be evaluated by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. At a pretrial hearing held on October 21 of that year, the judge ruled that based on a report from the Maryland department of health, Ramos is legally sane and can be held criminally responsible for his actions and his pending trial should proceed. This decision does not change his plea of not guilty and not criminally responsible. If Ramos is convicted, a second phase of the jury trial will determine if he is criminally responsible for his actions. The following week, in October 2019, Ramos pleaded guilty to the shooting and to all 23 counts. Since he pleaded not criminally responsible, the remaining legal issue is whether Ramos is legally responsible for the multiple murders. That trial was set to begin on 4 March 2020, and was later delayed to June 2020, and was later delayed to December 2020.

The tunnel carries the BMT Canarsie Line (serving the ) under the East River in New York City, connecting the boroughs of Brooklyn and Manhattan, and is used by an average of 225,000 passengers per weekday. A key segment of the 14th Street Tunnel, between the Bedford Avenue station in Brooklyn and the First Avenue station in Manhattan, would be partially closed for 15 to 20 months to allow for necessary and extensive repairs to the underwater tubes after it was flooded and severely damaged during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Two options were proposed in 2016: a three-year construction period where one tube at a time would be closed or an 18-month closure where both tubes would be worked on simultaneously. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority ultimately chose the 18-month closure option because it would be less disruptive to passenger service. The shutdown period was later reduced to 15 months to reduce service disruption. To accommodate displaced passengers, new or expanded bus, subway, and ferry service was to be added, and a 14th Street busway would have been implemented. The shutdown plan was criticized by riders who use the and people living along or near 14th Street in Manhattan, as it would have had adverse effects on other subway routes and on vehicular traffic. In January 2019, it was announced that the shutdown would not be a full-time closure, but a night and weekend closure. Ultimately, the line was not closed; night and weekend service was merely reduced. Background Damaged tunnels after draining In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused severe damage to New York City, and many subway tunnels were inundated with floodwater. The storm flooded nine of the system's 14 underwater tunnels, many subway lines and yards, and completely destroyed a portion of the Rockaway Line () in Queens, as well as much of the South Ferry terminal at Manhattan's southern tip. The subway opened with limited service two days after the storm and was running at 80 percent capacity within five days; however, some infrastructure needed repairs, which were staggered over several years starting in 2013. A year after the storm, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which operates the New York City Subway, said that Hurricane Sandy \\"was unprecedented in terms of the amount of damage that we were seeing throughout the system.\\" Reconstruction required many weekend closures on several lines and long-term closures on the Greenpoint Tunnel (), Montague Street Tunnel (), Rockaway Line, and the South Ferry station. A long- term closure was planned for the 14th Street Tunnel because it was significantly damaged by the storm surge. Moreover, the 14th Street Tunnel dates from 1924; thus its equipment was already 88 years old when Hurricane Sandy occurred. Planning  Closure options  In January 2016, the Canarsie Line between the Bedford Avenue station in Brooklyn and the Eighth Avenue station in Manhattan was proposed for either of two shutdown options. One option involved shuttering the entire segment for eighteen months. The other option would allow the MTA to operate two segments of track for three years: a single-track segment between Bedford and Eighth Avenues with a capacity of 5 trains per hour per direction, and regular service between Lorimer Street and Rockaway Parkway. For both options, the Third Avenue station would be closed and new exits and elevators at the First Avenue and Bedford Avenue stations would be added. The renovations would cost between $800 million and $1 billion; , the project budget includes $926 million. During the shutdown, workers would replace damaged communications, power and signal wires, third rails and tracks, duct banks, pump rooms, circuit breaker houses, tunnel lighting, concrete lining, and fire protection systems. Three new electric substations would provide more power to run more trains during rush hours. The closure would affect the 225,000 subway riders per weekday who travel on the 14th Street Tunnel between Brooklyn and Manhattan. This accounts for about 75% of the 300,000 riders per day who use the . Community meetings were held to determine which of the two options would be better. In an internal assessment, the MTA concluded that four out of five L train riders would be less impacted by the full-closure option compared to the partial- closure option. Additionally, the single-track option would result in severe overcrowding at First and Bedford Avenues. A subsequent poll conducted by transit-advocacy group Riders Alliance revealed that 77 percent of L train riders preferred the 18-month closure option. In July 2016, it was announced that the MTA had chosen the 18-month full closure option. Riders reacted with both disappointment over the closure, and relief that the service disruption would be shorter. The New York Post described the closure with the headline, \\"2019 is the year Williamsburg dies.\\" thumbleftupright=1.5alt=Map of service alternatives during the 14th Street Tunnel shutdownMap of service alternatives during the 14th Street Tunnel shutdown. The MTA named Judlau Contracting and TC Electric as the project's contractors on April 3, 2017, at which time the duration of the shutdown was shortened to 15 months. It offered the contractors a $188,000-a-day bonus for completing work up to 60 days early. as well as a $15 million bonus for completing the project on time; the MTA also stipulated that the companies would need to pay a fine of $410,000 for each day that work is delayed past the 15-month deadline. The joint venture is also responsible for renovating the First Avenue and Bedford Avenue stations during the shutdown, as well as adding platform screen doors to the Third Avenue station. According to a July 2018 report, construction was supposed to be \\"substantially completed\\" by November 2020. Initial mitigation plans The MTA indicated that during the shutdown, the L route would only have a frequency of ten trains per hour between Bedford Avenue and Rockaway Parkway, because of severely constrained terminal capacity at Bedford Avenue. In mid-2016, the MTA devised preliminary mitigation plans, which proposed additional shuttle bus, ferry, and subway service. A ferry route between Williamsburg and the East Village of Manhattan would be instituted; the M14A and M14D buses might be converted to Select Bus Service; and dedicated bus lanes would be placed on crosstown corridors in Manhattan. The MTA would institute two out-of-system subway transfers, free if paid via MetroCard: one between Broadway () and Lorimer Street (), and one between Livonia Avenue () and Junius Street (). In addition, the plan included extending G trains from four cars to eight cars, as well as running the M train to Midtown Manhattan daily, instead of on weekdays only. Preliminary documents also proposed that the four toll-free East River bridges between Manhattan and Long Island (the Queensboro, Williamsburg, Manhattan, and Brooklyn Bridges) might gain a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) restriction of at least three passengers per vehicle during rush hours. In December 2017, the MTA and the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) released a more concrete mitigation plan, based on projections that 80% of riders would transfer to other subway services to get to Manhattan, while 15% would use buses. An HOV restriction on the Williamsburg Bridge during rush hours would allow it to accommodate three Select Bus Service (SBS) routes between Brooklyn and Manhattan. Route L1 would stretch from Union Square, Manhattan, to the Grand Street station in Brooklyn; L2 would connect SoHo, Manhattan to the Grand Street station; and L3 would go from SoHo to Bedford Avenue. In addition, 14th Street between Third and Ninth Avenues would be converted into a bus-only corridor during rush hours to accommodate an SBS route across 14th Street, connecting to a ferry route at Stuyvesant Cove Park near 23rd Street. The mitigation plan also entailed improvements to six subway stations, new entrances at two stations, enlarged crosswalks near these subway stations, longer G and C trains, three free out-of-system transfers, increased service on the G, J/Z and M trains, and a weekend extension of the M train to 96th Street and Second Avenue. Finally, the plan included an expansion of New York City's privately-operated bike share system, Citi Bike, as well as upgrades to bike lanes on Brooklyn's Grand Street and a pair of crosstown bike lanes on 12th and 13th Streets. Some subway entrances on each of the affected routes would also be reopened. On December 14, 2017, members of the New York City Council held a hearing in which they asked the MTA head and NYCDOT Commissioner over the shutdown. The central question was whether the MTA could complete repairs by the July 2020 deadline. It was projected that during the shutdown, the 14th Street buses would become the most-used bus corridor in the city, and that 70 buses in each direction would travel across the Williamsburg Bridge every hour. As a result, Lower Manhattan politicians worried that the narrow streets in the area would not be able to accommodate the high-capacity buses.

The city also considered turning 14th Street into an exclusive busway 17 hours a day during all days of the week, and changed its initial plans for a two-way bike lane on 13th Street to two separate bike lanes on 12th and 13th Streets. When the 14th Street busway was enforced during the shutdown, the only vehicles that would be able to use the busway would be buses, trucks making deliveries on 14th Street, emergency and Access-A-Ride vehicles, and local traffic traveling for no more than one block. According to Winnie Hu, a transit specialist at The New York Times, the plan was inspired by Toronto's successful King Street Pilot Project, where restriction on ordinary vehicles on a section of previously clogged King Street sped up transit times for riders on the 504 King streetcar route, the Toronto Transit Commission's busiest surface route. The Toronto experiment allowed ordinary vehicles to continue to briefly use King Street, provided they turned off at the next stoplight. Separately, the MTA revised contingency plans so that there would be four SBS routes. They included the already-planned L1 Union Square‚ÄìGrand Street, L2 SoHo‚ÄìGrand Street, and L3 SoHo‚ÄìBedford Avenue routes, as well as a new route L4 between Union Square and Bedford Avenue. The four routes combined would carry 17% of displaced L train riders, while subways would carry another 70% and other transport methods would make up the remaining 13%. Citi Bike announced plans to add 1,250 bikes and 2,500 bike-share docks during the shutdown. A private company also announced their intention to create a luxury \\"New L\\" shuttle van service during the shutdown. In July 2018, the MTA and NYCDOT announced that the M14 Select Bus Service route would be implemented by January 6, 2019, three months before the tunnel was set to shut down. It would initially run with five stops in each direction between First Avenue/14th Street and 10th Avenue/14th Street. Local service on the M14A and M14D would be retained with minor modifications. One or two weeks before the tunnel closes, the M14 SBS would be extended to Stuyvesant Cove. The M14A/D local and the M14 SBS would be able to serve a combined 84,000 passengers every hour, with a bus every two minutes during rush hours. Sidewalks on nearby streets would be widened, and temporary pedestrian plazas would be designated, to accommodate the new Select Bus Service routes. The MTA also released additional details about headways on affected transit routes. The peak frequency of the G train would be increased from eight trains per hour (TPH) to 15 TPH between Court Square and Bedford‚ÄìNostrand Avenues, and from 8 to 12 TPH south of Bedford‚ÄìNostrand Avenues. Some G trains would have been extended to 18th Avenue during rush hours due to capacity constraints at Church Avenue. The M train peak frequency would be increased from 9 to 14 TPH between Myrtle Avenue and Manhattan, while the frequency of the J/Z and R trains would be decreased to accommodate the additional M service running on the same tracks. Several other subway routes between Manhattan and Brooklyn or Queens would have additional off-peak service. For bus route headways, the combined peak frequency of the M14 variants would be increased from 25 buses per hour to 35, and the B39 bus across the Williamsburg Bridge would be temporarily suspended because it would completely duplicate the temporary L3 route. The L1 through L4 buses would provide a combined 80 buses per hour during peak hours. Headways on local bus routes in Brooklyn that would connect with the L shuttle buses, such as the , would also be increased. The ferry service between Stuyvesant Cove and North 7th Street would run at a frequency of 8 trips per hour in each direction during rush hours. 7 trains would see increased service during rush hours, with fourteen additional 7 train round trips. In September 2018, the MTA indicated that the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) had been selected to manage the temporary L shuttle ferry's operation, since the corporation had already operated ferry routes in New York City under the NYC Ferry label. In turn, the NYCEDC was to contract the temporary shuttle ferry's operation out to NY Waterway as per the results of a request for proposals. The ferry was to operate for 15 months during the shutdown. The shuttle was to operate every 10 to 15 minutes from 6 a.m. until midnight on weekday nights, and until 2 a.m. on weekend nights. During rush hours, ferries would run every 7¬Ω minutes. Free transfers were to be available between the ferry and two Select Bus Service routes, one on either side of the East River. The same month, it was announced that an additional bus route, L5, was to operate rush hours between Canarsie Pier and Crown Heights, connecting Canarsie residents to the Crown Heights‚ÄìUtica Avenue station on the . Unlike the other temporary routes, the L5 was not going to be a SBS route, and was only supposed to operate during rush hours every 20 minutes, making limited stops between Canarsie Pier and Utica Avenue. That October, the MTA clarified its proposed temporary changes to subway service. During weekdays, there would be major increases in the number of G and M train trips; smaller increases in E, F, and J/Z train trips; minor modifications to A and R train trips; and a sharp decrease in L train trips. All of these routes except for the A and R routes would also see modified service frequencies on weekends, and the M would run to 96th Street/Second Avenue during both late nights and weekends. It was also announced that the shutdown would start on April 27, 2019. In the months before the long-term closure began, service would be suspended on some weekends and nights. =Temporary L shutdown bus routes= The following routes were planned to operate during the shutdown: { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"font-size: 90%;\\"  ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Route ! colspan=\\"3\\" Terminals ! colspan=\\"2\\" Streets traveled ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Notes and history - !

The J/Z and M train would be affected the most because these would be the only direct subway routes from Williamsburg and Bushwick to Manhattan during the shutdown. The G train would also carry displaced L train riders from Williamsburg and Bushwick to other subway routes in Downtown Brooklyn and Queens, resulting in capacity decreases on riders on the IND Culver Line in southern Brooklyn. The would carry L train riders transferring at Broadway Junction, which was not originally designed as a transfer station, as well as G riders transferring at Hoyt‚ÄìSchermerhorn Streets, some of whom had already transferred from the L. G train riders could also transfer to the or the at Court Square‚Äì23rd Street. As the would reach capacity during rush hours, some riders already on that route would probably transfer to the at Queensboro Plaza, one stop east of Court Square. The would also reach capacity during rush hours, bringing cascading effects to riders further east in Queens. One Voice writer concluded that \\"If you do not take the J, M, Z, A, C, 7, F, G, E, M, or R lines, then I have some good news: You're probably, probably not screwed during the L train shutdown. Except ‚Äî you had to know there would be exceptions ‚Äî for those of you who take the 3 and the N/W.\\" In total, fourteen services would be affected by the shutdown. In October 2018, the mitigation plans were described by a Curbed NY writer as inadequate, because of the lack of nearby subway routes that go directly to Manhattan; the lack of passenger capacity at key transfer stations; and the fact that nearly a quarter-million riders use the every day. The Curbed writer stated that one service disruption on the would have a ripple effect on displaced Canarsie Tube riders. Change in shutdown plans In December 2018, four months before the planned closure of the 14th Street Tunnel, New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced that he would personally visit the tunnel with several transportation experts that month. Cuomo said that he wanted to determine if the closure time could be reduced even further. By this point, the mitigation plans were being finalized. Work on painting road markings, including a busway on 14th Street, was underway. On January 3, 2019, following the tunnel tour, Cuomo announced at a news conference that the tunnels would not completely shut down, contingent on the MTA board approving an alternate plan. Instead, work would occur on weekends and nights, and construction could be finished in 15 to 20 months. This would be accomplished by hanging wires onto the sides of the tunnels and repairing the benchwalls alongside each track, similar to what was used in the subway systems of Hong Kong, London, and Riyadh, rather than completely replacing the benchwalls as was originally planned. A similar plan had been considered in 2014, but rejected due to the extent of silica exposure that this option entailed, and another report in 2015 had concluded that a weekend-only shutdown might be unsafe. The announcement occurred after Cuomo consulted with experts from Columbia University and Cornell University, and he reportedly also contacted Tesla, Inc.. The MTA board was not given advance notice of the announcement, and Cuomo only told the MTA to convene an emergency meeting after the announcement had been made. The announcement was criticized by transit advocates who said that a full closure would allow construction to be completed at once, similar to in the Montague Street Tunnel, as opposed to a piecemeal closure, which could take years. Cuomo was also criticized for taking so long to come up with the partial shutdown plan. Many Brooklyn residents and business owners along the route had already moved as a result of the proposed closure, and some North Brooklyn landlords reportedly regretted having signed leases for lower prices. However, the announcement was praised by the shutdown's opponents, which had previously filed a lawsuit over the proposed shutdown. Landlords and brokers also viewed the change in plans favorably. Following the conference, New York City Transit Authority head Andy Byford stated that the Williamsburg Bridge's HOV lanes and the shuttle ferry were no longer needed. The contract with Judlau would also have to be renegotiated and put before the board for a vote, as the contractor had already started the process of procuring materials for a full shutdown. However, the MTA's website indicated that many of the mitigation measures, including station improvements, accessibility renovations, and L train frequency enhancements, would continue. After the conference, Cuomo also stated that he wanted to \\"blow up\\" the MTA and restructure its entire operating hierarchy because the agency was inefficient. A special board meeting about the shutdown was held on January 15, 2019. At the board meeting, the modified plan was approved, despite objections from some members. M14 bus to be converted to Select Bus Service The following month, the MTA decided that several of the previously announced mitigation measures would not be needed. For instance, the Williamsburg Bridge HOV restrictions and the 14th Street busway would not be implemented. In addition, the G would not receive full-length trains, though it would still see an increase in train frequencies during nights and weekends. However, the station improvements would still proceed, and the partial shutdown would begin on April 27, 2019, as previously confirmed. Due to crowding concerns the MTA considered making the First and Third Avenues stations exit-only during weekends. Under the new plan, the free out-of-system transfers would be kept, except for between 21st Street and Hunters Point Avenue in Queens, and would only be instituted during weekends and late nights. Instead of running five shuttle bus routes in Manhattan and Brooklyn at all times, two \\"Williamsburg Link\\" shuttle buses, clockwise and counterclockwise, would run during weekends and late nights only. M14A bus service in Manhattan would be increased during weekends. In the months prior to the proposed closure, the MTA suspended L service between Broadway Junction and Eighth Avenue during the weekends in preparation for the partial shutdown. Instead, it operated three shuttle bus routes and expanded M train and M14A bus service. In April 2019, it was announced that the 14th Street busway would be added back to the mitigation plan, though the busway would take effect in June. The busway would have the same vehicle restrictions as originally planned. The M14A/M14D routes would be converted to Select Bus Service, a modification of the temporary Select Bus Service route that had been planned for the full shutdown. The M14A/D were converted to Select Bus Service routes on July 1, 2019. However, the busway did not take effect until October 3, 2019.  Construction  The first construction work related to the 14th Street Tunnel shutdown began in 2017. Workers excavated shafts at the First Avenue and Bedford Avenue stations so equipment could be lowered into the tubes. After the repairs are completed, these shafts are to be converted into additional entrances for those stations. The construction of shafts at the First Avenue station began in July 2017 at the intersection of 14th Street and Avenue A. Shafts were also built at Driggs Avenue and North 5th Street in Brooklyn, at the Bedford Avenue station. The Bedford Avenue station's mezzanine would be expanded to make way for the new entrances. , the projects at First Avenue and at Bedford Avenue were about one-fifth complete. Starting in August 2018, the MTA would close the tunnels for 15 weekends in preparation for the full-time closure the following year. In the original plan, there were to be three groups of 150 contractors, with each group working 8-hour shifts. The demolition and replacement of the tunnels' wire duct banks, or benchwalls, were to take up much the project's duration. A dust collection machine, which was custom-ordered for the 14th Street Tunnel project, was to include ventilation and dust filtration systems that allow dust to be contained within the tunnels. The dust was to be taken out of the tunnels via flatbed cars that travel to the shafts at Avenue A in Manhattan and Driggs Avenue in Brooklyn. The demolition was to be completed within three months, after which work on the new station entrances and replacement duct banks would commence. The tracks within the tunnels were also be replaced. These repairs would be able to last up to eighty years. Following the January 2019 announcement that the shutdown would instead be a partial closure, Cuomo and the MTA board unveiled some new details about the project. Rather than completely replacing the benchwall, workers would install new cable ducts on the sides of the existing tunnel walls, and the existing ducts would be abandoned. The technique of racking the cables on the wall differed from previous proposals, in that a rack, rather than the cables themselves, would be bolted onto the wall. The benchwalls would be repaired with epoxy and fiberglass as necessary, then converted into emergency egress walkways. By using this approach, less silica would need to be extracted from the tunnels because the benchwalls would not be entirely demolished. Fiber-optic and lidar sensors would be installed to allow MTA workers to more easily track imminent failures in the benchwalls. Station and track improvements would continue under the revised proposal. The repairs could last for up to forty years, and work might be elongated due to the need to maintain weekday service. The 14th Street Tunnel after rehabilitation The new plan meant that only 1% of the benchwall would have to be removed, namely the concrete surrounding 96 manholes. By the original closure date for the Canarsie tubes in April 2019, nearly half of that work had been completed. According to the New York Daily News, the extent of the work being done could result in a shortened service suspension. However, the change in plans led to delays in the rehabilitation of the Canarsie Line's five stations within Manhattan. the improvements were not set to start until 2020, whereas under the previous plan, the stations would have been renovated while the tunnel was closed. This could potentially increase the cost budgeted for these renovations, from $43.8 to $77.8 million. By September 2019, Cuomo announced that the shutdown work was progressing ahead of schedule and was set to be completed in April 2020. At that point, the Manhattan-bound tube's repairs had been finished, and work was starting on the Brooklyn-bound tube. On April 26, 2020, Cuomo announced the completion of the project, months ahead of schedule. The expedited completion date was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, which sharply reduced ridership in the final weeks of the project. Work on the Bedford and First Avenues stations was also progressing. However, regular service was not restored after the project's completion; the lack of ridership during the pandemic had reduced the frequency of trains as well, under the MTA's essential service plan.  Effects  After the shutdown was announced in 2016, some Williamsburg residents let their leases expire in 2018. As a result, housing prices began to decrease. The rate of housing vacancies in August 2018 was 25% more than the rate twelve months prior. After the plans were changed to a partial shutdown, a report published in early 2020 showed that median housing rents in Williamsburg increased significantly compared to late 2018.

The development of Wireless Data centers arose as a solution to growing cabling complexity and hotspots. The wireless technology was introduced by Shin et al., who replaced all cables with 60 GHz wireless connections at the Cayley data center.  Motivation  Most DCs deployed today can be classified as wired DCs because they use copper and optical fiber cables to handle intra- and inter-rack connections in the network.Wireless communication in data centers: A survey\\" by Abdelbaset S. Hamza, Jitender S. Deogun, and Dennis R. Alexander (IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, Volume 18, Issue 3 This approach has two problems, cable complexity and hotspots. Hotspots, also known as hot servers, are servers that generate high traffic compared to others in the network and they might become bottlenecks of the system. To address these problems several researchers propose the use of wireless communication into data center networks, to either augment existing wired data centers, or to realize a pure wireless data center Although cable complexity at first seems like an esthetical problem, it can affect a DC in different ways. First, a significant manual effort is necessary to install and manage these cables. Apart from that, cables can additionally affect data center cooling. Finally, cables take up space, which could be used to add more servers. The use of wireless technologies could reduce the cable complexity and avoid the problems cited before, moreover, it would allow for automatic configurable link establishment between nodes with minimum effort. Wireless links can be rearranged dynamically which makes it possible to perform adaptive topology adjustment. This means that the network can be rearranged to fulfil the real-time traffic demands of hotspots, thus solving the hot servers problem. Additionally, wireless connections do not rely on switches and therefore are free of problems such as single-point of failure and limited bisection bandwidth.  Requirements  The Data Center Network (DCN) is the infrastructure responsible to provide intra and inter-DC networking services, therefore is essential to design efficient high-speed/high bandwidth DCN to satisfy the high computing and communication demands from the DC. Another basic requirements, such as scalability and fault tolerance should also be addressed. In 2008, Ramachandran et al. talks specifically about the requirements that a wireless DCN should met, they are as follows: # High inter-node link capacity: Online services, such as MapReduce and distributed file systems, need high link and network capacity. # Reliability: There should be predictable performance of links over time. # Security Isolation: Data exchanged between services should be protected from unintended services for security and confidentiality. # Scalability: Link connectivity should scale and allow for the incremental addition of new machines to the network. # Small form factor of networking components: All machine components should have small form factors to allow for reduced energy consumption and to meet higher processing requirements and floor space constraints.  Technologies  There are two candidate technologies to enable wireless DCNs, the most cited one is 60GHz radio frequency (RF),Francois, Avery John, \\"Wireless 60 GHz Rack to Rack Communication in a Data Center Environment\\" (2016). Thesis. Rochester Institute of Technology. the other option is free space optical (FSO). *60 GHz RF: Radios in the license-free 60 GHz range have several characteristics that make them more suitable for adoption in data-centers. The spectrum availability of 7 GHz enables the creation of multiple links of high speed per unit volume, which allows for increased scalability. Moreover, signals at this frequency have reduced range relative to signals at lower frequencies, and smaller wavelengths, this allows for an improved interference mitigation and security, and also provides the capacity of designing sophisticated interfaces with small form factor. Finally, since the band between 57‚Äì64 GHz is license- free in a large number of countries, it is possible to launch products worldwide. *FSO: An FSO link is composed of a light source at the transmitter and a photodetector (PD) at the receiver. Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and Laser Diodes (LDs) are the most commonly used light sources in FSO links. LDs can support high data rate transmission, on the other hand, LEDs are considered as extended sources that can operate safely but have lower data rates as compared to LDs. Moreover, LEDs are cheaper and more reliable when compared to LDs. Positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) or avalanche photodetectors (APDs) are the most common photodetectors used on FSOs. PINs are used in many contexts that require FSO links of low cost and low data rates, on the other hand, APDs are used on systems that require high data rates and high performance.  Challenges  Since DCNs needs high bandwidth in order to exchange big amount of data, new communication technologies must be capable of achieving high link and network capacities and also it should meet other requirements of a data center network. Hence, In order to implement wireless communication technologies in data centers, there are several challenges that may face any wireless technology to be deployed in DCNs like: # Security: In a DCN, there is a massive amount of data to exchange between the nodes in the racks, therefore isolation of data from unintended nodes and services is a must to avoid security and privacy problems. # Small form factor of networking components: The physical dimensions of racks are defined, also the thickness of a module in a rack is measured in Rack Unit (U), which is 1.8 ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤, most servers fit 1U but the others fit 2U or larger. The designers need to develop the network components and interfaces which meet these constraints. # Heat and air flow: Any changes in the DCN floor (e.g. rack arrangement, physical topology, etc.) can cause changes in Data center environmental control, e.g. air flow and heat distribution properties. This may, in turn, lead to inefficient cooling, and thus network component failure or higher power consumption. # Agile Links: To address the hotspot problem encountered by wired DCNs, inter-rack wireless links must have a degree of reconfigurability. One of the main challenges faced by wireless DCN designers is establishing and maintaining wireless links between different servers or racks. # Obstruction- free wireless links: In the large-scale data centers there is too many interconnectivity between the racks, therefore the proposed wireless communication technology to use in DCNs must be able to meet this large link connectivity in DCNs. However, a critical impediment to the design of wireless DCN is the difficulty establishing obstruction-free wireless links to connect multiple adjacent network components. This is because LOS links cannot be easily maintained as other components get in between the source and destination need to be connected leading to risk of link blocking.A.S. Hamza et al., ‚ÄúFree space optical data center architecture design with fully connected racks,‚Äù Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 2014 IEEE, pp. 2192‚Äì2197, Dec 2014. # Containerised DCNs: Many existing and under development DCs utilise large open DCN floor design. However, containerised DCNs can present a cheaper and an efficient alternative design. A few papers discuss the deployment of 60 GHz RF and FSO technologies in the containerised DCN (also known as Modular data center) scenario.D. Halperin et al., ‚ÄúAugmenting data center networks with multi-gigabit wireless links,‚Äù Proc. ACM SIGCOMM, vol. 41, no. 4, pp. 38‚Äì49, 2011.N. Riza and P. Marraccini, ‚ÄúPower smart indoor optical wireless link applications,‚Äù Wireless Commun. and Mobile Comput., pp. 327‚Äì332, 2012. As a container becomes the building block of a DCN, intra and inter-container communication links must be designed. At the scale of the container, the cabling complexity problems may not be considerable, also by replacing the wired with wireless technologies, there will be few more space to locate more servers. The other technical issues are Confined space and metal walls that make the container a challenging environment for 60 GHz links as signals may reflect off the walls leading to multi-path fading.  Proposed designs   Cayley DCN  = Architecture = In the concept of wireless data centers, efficient use of open spaces is significant in order to optimize resource multiplexing. Since the maximum number of live connections proportional to the volume of data center per single antenna beam. Cayley DCN proposes to use cylindrical racks that are contains levels called stories and each row contains pie-shaped containers. (Fig. 1). These containers stores servers in it and servers faces both inner rack space and inter-rack space. Each server has two transceivers positioned at opposite ends of it. One for intra-rack communication and another one for inter-rack communication. Network Interface Cards (NIC) that are used in traditional data centers are replaced by a custom-built Y-switch with transceivers to connect the server's system bus. In this way, classic network switching fabric that exists in traditional databases are eliminated, which means, there is no need classic networking switches in the novel topology since every server is able to route data. This communication is maintained by geographical routing protocol which tries to find the shortest path between source and destination using coordinates of racks, the ordinal number of stories and the index number of the server in the stories. A server uses three routing tables to determine next hop which are inter-rack routing table, inter-story routing table, intra-story routing table. Fig. 1: Cayley wireless Data Center = Cost and Performance = The technical studies have been done to evaluate network performance, failure resilience and cost. During the tests, since the wireless transceivers and Y-switches are not yet available in the market, estimations have done based on the expected price range of 60 GHz transceivers and simulations are developed for performance evaluations of Cayley data center and Conventional data centers (CDC) with different designs. Based on conducted experiences with Cayley data center and CDC that are configured with different oversubscription rates, Cayley data centers have better performance at maximum aggregate bandwidth compared to CDC. Cayley data centers are taking advantage of less switching design and doubles CDC's bandwidth during packet delivery outside of a rack. Cayley data center has a drawback in packet delivery latency and scalability because it uses multi-hop routing and uses intermediate nodes to convey packets to other nodes. Therefore, as the traffic load increases, the maximum latency quickly increases as well. Hence, Cayley data centers are not able to reach the same scalability level of CDC's, since CDC has stable wired links and network hops with smaller numbersE. Baccour et al., ‚ÄúA survey of wireless data center networks,‚ÄùInformation Sciences and Systems (CISS), March 2015 Cayley data centers are more resilient to failures compared to conventional data centers since Cayley topology has dense connectivity and have minimized the number of switches that are a critical point for failures for data centers. Experiences shows that server nodes will be fully connected until 20% of nodes, 59% stories, and 14% racks fail. However, more than 99% of connections are preserved to %55 nodes and stories, 45% of racks are failed Cost analysis of Cayley data centers has been done based on assumptions since 60 GHz transceivers are not commercially in the market yet. However, it is expected that transceivers‚Äô price will not be expensive if the silicon chips are used. In the case, the cost of a 60-GHz transceiver less than $90, Cayley data centers will be much cheaper. A 60 GHz transceiver consumes maximum 0.3 watts, while the top of rack switches (TOR), aggregation switches (AS), and core switches (CS) consume in the range of 170-620 watts.S. Pinel, P. Sen, S.

Laskar., \\"60GHz single-chip CMOS digital radios and phased array solutions for gaming and connectivity\\".IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 2009 Therefore, total power switch packet consumption of CDC is at least 12 times more than Cayley data centers. Moreover, due to the absence of cabling, maintenance costs will be significantly lower  References  Category:Computer networking ","title":"Wireless data center"},{"id":"57786875","text":"Angelo Polledri (18 January 1904 ‚Äì 18 July 1997) was an Italian coxswain.

Order of Battle May 1940 During the Battle of France the brigade had the following composition:Routledge, Table XVIII, p. 126. * 4th AA Rgt ** 1, 3, 27 AA Btys * 21 AA Bty ‚Äì from 8th (Belfast) AA Rgt (SR) * 220 AA Bty ‚Äì from 85th (Tees) AA Rgt (TA) * 1 LAA Bty ‚Äì independent * 52nd (East Lancashire) LAA Rgt (TA) ‚Äì joined after 4 AA Bde was attached to I Corps ** 154, 155, 156 LAA Btys Following the German invasion of the Low Countries the BEF followed the pre-arranged Plan D and advanced into Belgium to take up defences along the Dyle. However the collapse of the Dutch forces and the German Army's rapid breakthrough in the Ardennes soon threatened the BEF's positions. It withdrew to the Escaut line under frequent air attack. 4th AA Regiment had been defending airfields around Aubigny and Arras, and then followed the BEF into Belgium, taking up positions around Tournai. Here it was in action for six days as the town was bombed by formations of Heinkel He 111s and Dornier Do 17s. On 18 May it was ordered back to Douai and Seclin airfields, the regimental HQ (RHQ) being bombed during the move. The next day it was ordered to move immediately to Templeuve between Orchies and Lille, a move involving great difficulty and much shooting.Farndale, pp. 43‚Äì4.Routledge, pp. 120‚Äì1. Retreat to Dunkirk On 20 May Army Group A swung north to the English Channel and cut the BEF off. Forced to retire towards Dunkirk, the BEF's AA brigades were sucked into the ground battles, split into sub-units in rearguard actions, or moved back to cover successive key points.Farndale, pp. 43‚Äì4.Routledge, pp. 116‚Äì7. 4 AA Brigade's units were used by I Corps, with 4th AA Rgt engaging a series of attacks by 20‚Äì30 bombers escorted by fighters. The Gun-Laying (GL) radar sets were sent back, and I Corps employed the regiment's batteries on bridges and routes to cover its withdrawal against high level and dive-bombing attacks. The next six days saw alternate moves and deployments in small units of Troop and Section size at Armenti√®res, Hazebrouck, Poperinghe and other places under shellfire and Stuka attack. When the supply chain failed, a search party found a stock of ammunition on a loaded train in a railway siding. 21/8th AA Battery fought hard until on 27 May it was surrounded by Panzers and engaged them at close range. The gunners were forced to remove their breechblocks and disable their guns under machine gun fire before assisting the infantry with their rifles while retreating to Dunkirk. British 3-inch HAA guns abandoned at Dunkirk, June 1940 By 26 May the decision had been made to evacuate the BEF from Dunkirk (Operation Dynamo), with I Corps controlling the rearguard including 4 AA Bde. The Corps LAA regiment (52nd (East Lancashire) LAA Rgt) came under 4 AA Bde for the last part of the operation, and moved down to deploy on the Dunkirk beaches. The rest of the brigade was ordered to disable or destroy all equipment and prepare for evacuation.Ellis, Chapter XI.Ellis, Chapter XIV.Farndale, p. 63.Routledge, pp. 117‚Äì8. 4th AA Regiment assembled on the beach at Bray-Dunes on 29 May, where the men lay under air attack for 36 hours. On 31 May the regiment was allowed to organise its own evacuation by means of small boats and a 'pier' of abandoned trucks. On arrival in England the AA troops were sent to various training camps to reform. Most were then deployed to reinforce Anti-Aircraft Command in defending the UK during the Battle of Britain and The Blitz.Farndale, Annex D.Routledge, Table LXV, pp. 396‚Äì7. Others, including Brigadier Slater and his 4 AA Bde HQ, were sent to reinforce Middle East Forces (MEF).Routledge, pp. 128‚Äì9. Western Desert Campaign Order of Battle January 1941 On arrival in Egypt, 4 AA Bde assembled as a mobile formation in the rear areas under British Troops Egypt (BTE). The Western Desert Force (WDF) had begun its campaign against the Italians in Libya (Operation Compass) and in the last weeks of January 1941 the Italians began a long retreat through Tobruk, Derna and Benghazi. By 31 January 1941, 4 AA Bde had moved up to join XIII Corps (formerly the WDF) at Mersa Matruh in the Western Desert with the following organisation:Farndale, p. 130.Joslen, p. 478.Routledge, Table XIX, p. 141. * HQ 4 AA Bde * 51st (London) HAA Rgt ** RHQ, 152, 153 HAA Btys ** 16 HAA Bty ‚Äì attached from 2nd HAA Rgt * 13th LAA Rgt ** RHQ, 37, 38 LAA Btys ** 155 LAA Bty ‚Äì attached from 52nd (East Lancashire) LAA Rgt * 1 Independent LAA Bty * Detachment 5 Independent LAA Bty * B squadron, Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry ‚Äì organised as an AA/SL Bty Siege of Tobruk Almost as soon as it arrived, 4 AA Bde had to send forward part of its strength to catch up with XIII Corps' advance. Two batteries of 51st HAA Rgt with 16/2 HAA Bty and 8th Australian LAA Bty went on to Derna and Benghazi, while 51st HAA Rgt's Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC) workshop detachment remained at Tobruk and set about restoring some of the captured Italian AA guns to working order. 1 LAA Bty moved up as separate Troops attached to columns of 7th Armoured Division, covering of rough going in 30 hours. There was virtually no enemy air activity as the Italian Tenth Army collapsed, with many thousands surrendering, but within a few days aircraft of the Regia Aeronautica joined by the Luftwaffe began bombing the British forward supply point that had been established at Benghazi.Playfair Vol I, pp. 365, 374. Meanwhile, MEF had to provide AA cover for the campaign in Greece: 2nd and 51st HAA and 13th and 52nd LAA Rgts had already sent individual batteries; now 16/2 HAA Bty was recalled from Benghazi to embark at Alexandria, a journey of , followed by 155/52 LAA Bty.Playfair Vol I, pp. 375‚Äì6.Routledge, pp. 144‚Äì5. Gunners cleaning a mobile 3.7-inch HAA gun at Tobruk, August 1941. German intervention in the shape of General Erwin Rommel and his Afrika Korps quickly turned the tide in Libya. A swift breakthrough pushed British forces backwards. The two batteries of 51st HAA Rgt and 8 Australian LAA Bty at Benghazi were recalled, retiring first to Derna and then to Tobruk, in action most of the way. The German columns, heading for the Egyptian frontier, bypassed Tobruk, whose garrison prepared to defend the port. This was invested from 11 April, beginning the epic Siege of Tobruk lasting 240 days. 4 AA Brigade was a major element of the garrison, and had been reinforced just before the ring closed, with the arrival of 14th (West Lothian, Royal Scots) LAA Rgt (less one battery) and 235 (Kent) Battery of 89th (Cinque Ports) HAA Rgt (to replace the absent battery of 51st HAA Rgt). Eight static 3.7-inch guns had also been delivered by sea, making a total of 24 guns available, (although two were disabled early in the siege by premature bursts and the static guns had to be assembled and emplaced), and 152 and 235 Batteries each had an Italian 102mm gun in addition.Farndale, p. 162.Routledge, pp. 130‚Äì3, Table XX, p. 141. Each mobile HAA troop established at least one alternative site and the guns were regularly switched between them, the empty sites being rigged up as dummies. The two available gun-laying (GL) radar sets had to be positioned away from the vulnerable gun sites and used for early warning to supplement the single RAF radar, and a close ring of searchlights operated round the harbour at night, able to illuminate enemy minelayers. Harbour defence was by pre-arranged barrages by five of the six HAA troops, the sixth troop remaining on watch for other raiders. Later a mobile troop was moved to one or other GL site to engage 'unseen' targets at night. Telephone lines were laid from the Gun Operations Room (GOR) near the harbour to Fortress HQ, all gun positions and all radars, and radio links were set up to any warships in the harbour or lying offshore. Rommel made his first attack on the perimeter before dawn on 14 April but was driven out by a counter-attack. During this battle RHQ and 153 HAA Bty of 51st (London) HAA Rgt were attacked by Stukas; Lieutenant-Colonel Murray McIntyre was among those wounded, and RHQ was evacuated by sea to Alexandria that night. RHQ of 13th LAA Regiment took over command of the harbour area, while RHQ of 14th LAA Rgt commanded the perimeter area. Brigadier Slater acted as AA Defence Commander (AADC) for the whole Tobruk area, with RHQ 13th LAA Rgt providing the AADC for the harbour area.Farndale, p. 167.Farndale, p. 188. German bombs explode during one of the heaviest air raids on Tobruk. The photograph was taken from a trench adjoining an AA gun. The Official History records that the AA artillery in Tobruk was 'incessantly in action against attacks of all kinds, from all heights, but especially by dive-bombers'.Playfair, Vol II, p. 158. The LAA gunners needed quick reactions to deal with low-level fighter attacks and dive-bombers. The regimental historian notes that these Stuka attacks concentrated on gun positions, which was a serious threat to HAA sites, whose instruments could not cope with the rapid height changes. The gunners devised a tactic of opening fire with short Fuzes just before the dive started, to force the pilots to fly through a ring of bursts. The battery cooks, drivers and clerks then joined in, firing machine-guns and captured 20mm Breda guns. This aggressive method was known as 'Porcupine', and was so effective that the Luftwaffe changed to high-level bombing, where the GL radar could direct concentrations. The harbour could not be completely defended against air attack by day, but was always usable by night. Aircraft attempting to lay parachute mines in the approaches were usually driven off by a low- level concentration of all available guns into a searchlight-illuminated target area. The searchlights were only switched on once the GL radar had located the target. Luftwaffe casualties were heavy: 53 aircraft shot down and 43 damaged in April, 45 and 56 in May. 152 HAA Battery, dug in west of the harbour, alone engaged 1000 enemy aircraft in a six-month period. Whereas there were 21 attacks by a total of 386 aircraft in April, by July this had fallen to just four attacks by 79 aircraft. 4 AA Brigade recorded that there was a steady decline in numbers of aircraft attacking as the siege went on, with the attackers switching to high-level and night attacks. In the last two months of the siege, troops of HAA guns took it in turn to move out to the perimeter and take on ground targets under the control of 9th Australian Division. Their long-range harassing fire made up for the shortage of medium artillery. Apart from the two HAA guns disabled by premature bursts, 51 HAA and 13 LAA Workshops kept the remainder serviceable; despite hits on the gun positions, no gun was out of action for more than a few hours.Routledge, Table XXI, p. 142. A 3.7-inch HAA gun in the Western Desert. Order of Battle, April 1941 The composition and dispositions of the brigade in the early part of the siege were as follows:Farndale, p. 165. * HQ 4 AA Bde Harbour defended area: * RHQ 13th LAA Rgt ** 152/51 HAA Bty ** 153/51 HAA Bty ** 235/89 HAA Bty ** 40/14 LAA Bty ** B Sqn, Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry, temporary S/L unit ** 2 Trps 306 S/L Bty, 27th (London Electrical Engineers) S/L Rgt, arrived in April ** GOR ** 51 HAA Rgt Workshop, RAOC ** 51 HAA Rgt Signal Section, Royal Corps of Signals A Bofors gun in North Africa Perimeter defended area * RHQ 14th LAA Rgt ** Trp, 38/13 LAA Bty ** 39/13 LAA Bty ** 57/14 AA Bty ** 1 LAA Bty ** 8 Australian LAA Bty ** 13 LAA Rgt Workshop, RAOC ** 13 LAA Rgt Signal Section, RCS Total equipment: * 24 x 3.7-inch HAA Guns (16 mobile, 8 static) * 2 x 102 mm HAA guns (Italian) * 2 x 149 mm HAA guns (Italian) * 18 x Bofors 40 mm LAA guns (6 mobile, 12 static) * 42 x Breda 20 mm LAA guns (Italian) * 10 x S/Ls (8 90 cm, 2 Italian) * 2 x GL Mk I radar sets During September and October 1941 the whole of 9th Australian Division was relieved by sea and replaced by the British 70th Division and the Polish Independent Carpathian Brigade. At the same time some of the AA units and personnel were also relieved: for example, 152 HAA Bty left for rest and refit in Palestine, and RHQ and one battery of 69th (Royal Warwickshire Regiment) HAA Rgt arrived, while 5 Independent LAA Bty replaced 8 Australian LAA Bty. However, 153 and 235 HAA Btys, RHQ 14th LAA Rgt and 39, 40 and 57 LAA Btys saw the whole siege through.Farndale, pp. 204‚Äì5. Also in September Slater went back to Egypt to take up the post of Brigadier, AA Middle East. He was awarded a CBE in the 1942 New Year Honours and later that year commanded 7th AA Division at home in AA Command. Slater's work at Tobruk was later singled out for praise by the Australian Official History.London Gazette 30 December 1941. He was replaced as commander of 4 AA Bde by Brevet Colonel John Muirhead, the CO of 74th (City of Glasgow) HAA Rgt, who had just been promoted to command 2 AA Bde but was transferred to Tobruk on 3 September.2 AA Bde War Diary, Middle East, 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 169/1560.Muirhead at Generals of WWII. During the main part of the siege (10 April to 9 October), 40 AA gunners were killed and 128 wounded. Relieved In November 1941 the British Eighth Army began a new offensive in the Western Desert (Operation Crusader), which succeeded in ending the Siege of Tobruk. 68th (North Midland) HAA Regiment was moved up to defend the recaptured port of Benghazi. The first phase of 'Crusader' lasted until January 1942, when Rommel counter-attacked. Benghazi was lost again on 29 January and Eighth Army fell back and dug in along the Gazala Line.Farndale, pp. 214‚Äì5.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 78, 140, 151, 197.Routledge, pp. 135‚Äì7. There was then a lull in the fighting while both sides reorganised.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 197‚Äì205. The situation by 12 May 1942 was that 4 AA Bde was defending Tobruk with 68th (NM) HAA Rgt as its major subordinate unit, though some batteries were detached to 12 AA Bde defending fighter landing grounds for the Desert Air Force and the army's railhead at Fort Capuzzo.Order of Battle, Eighth Army, May‚ÄìJune 1942, TNA file WO 201/692. On 22 May the brigade was joined by 107 LAA Bty from 27th LAA Rgt, which formed the sole LAA defence of Tobruk harbour.107 LAA Bty War Diary 1942, TNA file WO 169/4937. Fall of Tobruk During the Battle of Gazala, beginning on 26 May, Rommel's Axis forces quickly broke into the British position and began attacking the defensive 'boxes'. After bitter fighting in the Gazala Line and the 'Cauldron', Eighth Army was forced to retreat. The British hoped to defend Tobruk as in the previous siege, but this time the Axis forces reached it before the defences were ready.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 223‚Äì67. The attack on Tobruk began on 20 June. After the preliminary air bombardment, Axis tanks made rapid progress through the perimeter defences. The 3.7-inch HAA guns had been deeply dug in for protection against dive-bombing, but a four- gun troop of 277 HAA Bty found themselves faced with action at short notice against Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks of 21st Panzer Division driving down the escarpment from 'King's Cross' towards the harbour. The gunners stripped down the walls of their emplacements to permit low-angle fire and engaged the tanks with armour-piercing and high explosive rounds. Together with some South African field guns and medium guns the position held up a Panzer battalion for four hours and knocked out four tanks, but the outcome was inevitable and the AA positions were 'overrun by swarms of enemy infantry'. Rommel himself referred to the 'extraordinary tenacity' of the strongpoint.Routledge, p. 140.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 267‚Äì9. Tobruk surrendered the following day, and around 33,000 Allied troops were captured, including 4 AA Bde.List of units captured in Tobruk 21 June 1942, TNA file WO 201/690.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 273‚Äì4. After the fall of Tobruk, the Eighth Army retreated in confusion beyond the Egyptian frontier until the Axis advance was finally halted at El Alamein.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 281, 288‚Äì97, 331‚Äì5. Order of Battle 21 June 1942 The composition of 4 AA Bde when it was captured at Tobruk was as follows:'List of units captured at Tobruk 21 June 1942', TNA file WO 201/690. * HQ 4 AA Bde * 68th (North Midland) HAA Rgt ** RHQ ** 277 HAA Bty ** 282 HAA Bty ‚Äì attached from 88th HAA Rgt ** 68 HAA Rgt Sigs ** 68 HAA Rgt Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) ** 68 HAA Workshop Section RAOC * 5 LAA Bty * 107/27 LAA Bty * A & B Trps 43 LAA Bty, 61st LAA Rgt * 135 Z Bty * Dets 305/27 S/L Bty * 5 GOR * 4 AA Bde Sigs RCS * 4 AA Bde Company RASC * 4 AA Bde Workshops RAOC Reformed 4 AA Brigade HQ was reformed in Persia and Iraq Command (PAIFORCE) in August 1942, where General Henry Maitland Wilson was trying to build up the AA resources of Tenth Army to meet a possible German advance on the vital oilfields via the Caucasus. At first it had the following order of battle:Joslen, p. 489.Routledge, p. 200. * 75th (Home Counties) (Cinque Ports) HAA Rgt * 80th LAA Rgt * 99th LAA Rgt * 100th LAA Rgt However, the latter two regiments were soon sent forward as divisional troops and Wilson's planned AA defences never reached their full extent. After the German defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad the Luftwaffe was never in a position to attack Iraq or Persia and from April 1943 the AA defences were run down. 4 AA Brigade concentrated on defending RAF Habbaniya, Basra and a few oilfields, but it was given two important training tasks in addition to its operational commitments. The first was to organise and train four Polish AA regiments from the thousands of former Prisoners of War (Anders' Army) released by the Soviet Union to form II Polish Corps under British command. Their technical training was assigned to 83rd (Blythswood) HAA Rgt. The second task was for 83rd HAA Rgt to provide 258 HAA Bty as a cadre to form the basis of 25th Indian HAA Rgt. By May 1943 the first battery of 25th Indian HAA Rgt was ready for duty and posted to Habbaniya. This regiment was complete by March 1944, and in May the Indian Army took full responsibility for AA tasks under Tenth Army. 4 AA Brigade with 75th and 83rd HAA Rgts returned to Middle East Forces, where the AA organisation was being run down.Routledge, Table XXVI, p. 165. 4 AA Brigade was disbanded on 1 July 1944. 4 AA Brigade was not reformed in the postwar British Army.Routledge, Table LXXIV. p. 441.

He was married to Fanny Monroe, the daughter of U.S. Representative James Monroe and grandniece of James Monroe, the 5th President of the United States. Their son, Douglas Robinson Jr., was married to Corinne Roosevelt, sister of President Theodore Roosevelt and aunt of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Early life Robinson was born on March 24, 1824 in Scotland and was descended from Scottish landed gentry. He was the youngest of four sons born to William Rose Robinson of Clermiston (1781‚Äì1834) and Mary (n√©e Douglas) Robinson (1783‚Äì1864). He was the younger brother of Sir William Rose Robinson, KCSI, who served as acting Governor of Madras. His sister, Saida Douglas Robinson, was married to Alexander Davidson. His paternal grandparents were George Robinson and Elizabeth (n√©e Innes) Robinson. His maternal grandparents were James Douglas of Orchardton, a Glasgow merchant, and Elizabeth (n√©e Douglas) Douglas. His maternal uncle was William Douglas, a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons, and his great-uncle was Sir William Douglas, 1st Baronet, of Gelston Castle, Scotland, both of whom died unmarried with no children. Robinson's maternal grandfather, James Douglas, was the brother of George Douglas, the maternal grandfather of his eventual wife Fanny. According to Marian Campbell Gouverneur (daughter-in-law of Samuel L. Gouverneur, himself a nephew and son-in-law of President Monroe), \\"George Douglas was a Scotch merchant who hoarded closely. His wine cellar was more extensive than his library.\\" Career After studying at Edinburgh University, eighteen year old Robinson emigrated from Scotland to the United States in 1842. He started in business in Philadelphia and later came to New York as a partner in the banking house of James K. Soutter's Sons. He later served as secretary of the Great Western Insurance Company, which was then known as the United States Lloyds. Society life In 1892, Robinson, as well as his son Douglas and daughter-in-law Corinne, was included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. The Robinson's had a country home in the Catskills, in the style of a Scottish Castle, in Jordanville, New York that was known as Henderson House and modeled after Sir William Douglas' Gelston Castle in Scotland. Henderson House was a 5,000 acre plot of a 15,000 acre grant from Queen Anne to Fanny's 2x great-grandfather, James Henderson. Fanny had inherited the home from her aunt Harriet (n√©e Douglas) Cruger, the sister of her mother, Elizabeth Douglas Monroe. Cruger was an eccentric lady known for her many friendships with prominent people of her time, including Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet, William Wordsworth, Juliette R√©camier, and Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. Around 1872, the Robinson's came to West Orange, New Jersey and built a large home next door to General George McClellan. Their 72 acre estate was known as Overlook. As with his other properties, his son inherited Overlook upon his death in 1893.  Personal life  On November 14, 1850, Robinson was married to his second cousin Frances \\"Fanny\\" Monroe (1824‚Äì1906), the daughter of Elizabeth Mary \\"Eliza\\" (n√©e Douglas) Monroe and Col. James Monroe, a Virginian born member of the U.S. House of Representatives from New York who was the nephew of James Monroe, the 5th President of the United States. They were married at Fanwood in Fort Washington, which was then a suburb of New York. Together, they were the parents of two children: * Douglas Robinson Jr. (1855‚Äì1918), who married Corinne Roosevelt (1861‚Äì1933), the youngest child of Theodore Roosevelt Sr. and Martha (n√©e Bulloch) Roosevelt. She was also the younger sister of Bamie Roosevelt, President Theodore Roosevelt, and Elliott Bulloch Roosevelt (therefore the aunt of future First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt).Brogan, Hugh and Mosley, Charles American Presidential Families October 1993, page 568 * Harriet Douglas \\"Missy\\" Robinson (1856‚Äì1922), who married the Rev. Henry Bazeley Wolryche-Whitmore (1856‚Äì1928), an Englishman who was the nephew and heir of William Wolryche-Whitmore, a Member of Parliament who represented Bridgnorth and Wolverhampton. Robinson died on November 30, 1893 aboard the , a Lloyd passenger steamer, while sailing from New York . He was buried at the Robinson Cemetery in Herkimer County, New York. His widow died in Warren, New York in August 1906. In 1908, the Robinson children erected the Jordanville Public Library, designed by New York architects Trowbridge & Livingston, as a memorial to their parents in Jordanville, New York. Descendants Through his son Douglas Jr., he was a grandfather of Theodore Douglas Robinson (1883‚Äì1934), a member of the New York State Senate who married his distant cousin, Helen Rebecca Roosevelt, daughter of James Roosevelt Roosevelt and Helen Schermerhorn Astor (a niece of Franklin D. Roosevelt); Corinne Douglas Robinson (1886‚Äì1971), a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives who married Joseph Wright Alsop IV; Monroe Douglas Robinson (1887‚Äì1944), who married Dorothy Jordan, the granddaughter of Eben Dyer Jordan; and Stewart Douglas Robinson (1889‚Äì1909), who tragically died from a fall while a student at Harvard University. Through his daughter Harriet, he was a grandfather of Frances Sylvia Wolryche-Whitmore (1889‚Äì1939), who married the Rev. William Higgin Beauchamp Yerburgh (1885‚Äì1937) in 1925; and Ursula Margaret Wolryche- Whitmore, who in 1934 married Sir Oswald Arthur Scott, K.C.M.G.

He covered a wide repertoire, from Habanera and Calypso, to trad jazz, swing and jazz standards. He led The Mike McKenzie Trio, Quartet and Quintet; Mike McKenzie's Habaneros; Mike McKenzie and his Rhythm; and The Mike McKenzie All Stars. Early years McKenzie was taught piano by his mother from the age of seven, and violin by his father from the age of 16. He played regularly in Georgetown, then moved to London in 1949. 1950s and 1960s At the start of the 1950s McKenzie was working with producer Denis Preston at both the BBC and for the Melodisc and Parlophone record labels. Preston rapidly established McKenzie as a regular recording artist and contributor to radio and television broadcasts for at least a decade. Preston had an ear for putting together musicians from different genres and had his own production company that licensed his recordings to commercial record labels: McKenzie's line ups similarly featured a fusion of instrumentalists - Joe Harriott, Shake Keane, Bertie King, Humphrey Lyttleton, Denny Wright and Jack Fallon, and vocalists George Browne, Marie Bryant and Lili Verona. McKenzie also featured in the founding of the Black British carnival tradition. On 30 January 1959, The Mike McKenzie Trio performed with Cleo Laine at the first Caribbean Carnival (West Indian Gazette Carnival) at St Pancras Town Hall, a precursor to the Notting Hill Carnival.; even prior to that, in 1957, he had appeared in a BBC radio programme, Caribbean Carnival: The British West Indies Show. Every year, from 1954 to 1961, he represented the West Indies on a series of BBC radio programmes celebrating music from the Commonwealth. He performed, either solo or with a combo, at various London venues as well as the Moss Empires circuit. They included the Colony Room Club in Soho (1950-c1970), Hungaria Restaurant in Regent Street (1955), The Milroy and The Empress clubs in Mayfair and Le Caprice restaurant in St James's. In 1964 he appeared in a documentary filmed in a pub in the Isle of Dogs, accompanying its proprietor, Queenie Watts, performing the Sinatra classic, The Best Is Yet to Come. McKenzie freelanced or featured as a sideman with various groups including Lord Kitchener, Joe Appleton (1950), Humphrey Lyttleton (with whom he toured and recorded in 1952), Fela Sowande's BBC Ebony Club Band (1953) and Lonnie Donnegan, with whom he guested. He toured with Jack Parnell in the jazz revue Jazz Wagon (c.1954), accompanied Ella Fitzgerald at the Mars Bar in Paris and played at the London Palladium with the Ted Heath Orchestra. His broadcast career with the BBC lasted for 20 years; he was a familiar name in broadcasting, with frequent appearances on the BBC Light Programme, playing a huge range of styles. He composed songs with his wife, the lyricist and actress Elizabeth McKenzie, and Denis Preston; he was an arranger for Humphrey Lyttleton and Wally Fawkes. 1970s and 1980s On 28 November 1972, McKenzie started a four-year residency at The White Elephant on the River in Chelsea, accompanied by Johnny Hawksworth and Stuart Livingston, followed by seven years at The Dorchester, and finally in the '80s, nine years at The Savoy, eventually playing from his wheelchair. In 1978, he returned to working with the producer Denis Preston on a recording which was never released since Preston died in 1979 before it could be issued. According to its composer Daryl Runswick, McKenzie was by then firmly established as a nightclub pianist, and \\"had a residency at a nightclub in Mayfair ‚Äì Berkeley Square, if I remember correctly. This was to be Mike's record, to be sold on the door at the nightclub as the punters left [...] In a further twist, Denis prescribed that the musical style was to be Latin Fusion in the manner of Carlos Santana. What this had to do with Mike McKenzie and his cocktail jazz I never worked out.\\" In 1984, McKenzie recorded an LP of his songs with Elizabeth McKenzie, Spell It Out, which he co-produced with his son, the bass player John McKenzie. Legacy Vibert C. Cambridge, in his book Musical Life in Guyana, describes the contributions West Indian musicians made to the evolution of British popular music during the twentieth century, singling out calypso recordings in particular: In popular culture The lyrics of \\"Tomato\\" (1952) and \\"Little Boy\\" (1953) are quoted in Frank Norman's 1959 novel, Stand on Me.

He was a pioneer of quantitative perimetry, introducing this technique of visual field testing to Britain. Sinclair also introduced the operation of intracapsular extraction of the lens for cataract into the UK. He was President of the Ophthalmological Society of the United Kingdom from 1931 to 1933 and was President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh from 1933 to 1935. He was Surgeon-Oculist to King George VI in Scotland. Early life Sinclair was born at Kenmore in Perthshire on 20 February 1868, the youngest son of Rev Alan Sinclair, minister of the Free Church of Kenmore, and his wife Sarah (n√©e Fraser). He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh graduating MB CM in 1893 and went on to graduate with the postgraduate degree of MD in 1899.  Career  Having decided to specialise in ophthalmology at an early stage, he gained experience in that speciality by visiting clinics in London, Utrecht and Copenhagen. He became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1899. Also in 1899 he was appointed clinical assistant in ophthalmology at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) under Sir George Berry from whom he learned the fundamentals of clinical perimetry. Berry maintained links with the ophthalmic surgeons in Copenhagen who had developed the technique and Sinclair was able to develop this further. In 1905 he was made Assistant Ophthalmic Surgeon in the RIE and Ophthalmic Surgeon to Leith Hospital and to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh. In the First World War he served in the Royal Army Medical Corps with the Salonika Expeditionary Force. From 1922 to 1932 he was Surgeon in charge of wards at the RIE. His main contributions to ophthalmology were the introduction of quantitative perimetry, a method for measuring the visual fields. he described the use of this technique in the diagnosis of glaucoma. Sinclair introduced the operation of intracapsular extraction of the lens for cataract. His series of 257 cases published in 1932 was regarded as showing the best results published to that time. After retiring he became chairman of the W H Ross Foundation for the Study of the Prevention of Blindness. It was on Sinclair's suggestion the fund was established. Among the advances which the Foundation made was the successful treatment of infections of the cornea in coal miners which greatly reduced the resulting blindness in that occupational group.  Honours and awards  In 1927 he became President of the Ophthalmologigical Section of the British Medical Association and in 1938 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Francis Albert Eley Crew, Orlando Charnock Bradley, Sir Harold Stiles, James Watt and Ralph Stockman. Sinclair was a member of the Royal Company of Archers, the Queen's Bodyguard for Scotland. He was President of the Ophthalmological Society of the United Kingdom from 1931 to 1933 and was President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh from 1933 to 1935. He was Surgeon-Oculist to King George VI in Scotland. from 1929  Death  He died at home in Edinburgh on 30 June 1962. He was buried in Dean Cemetery in western Edinburgh.

Education Cradock entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, as a pensioner from Rutland, and was elected fellow of Emmanuel in 1645. He was a noted tutor there, and had many pupils. On 10 October 1649 he was incorporated M.A. at Oxford. His public performance on taking his B.D. in 1651 at Cambridge was 'highly applauded,' says Calamy. He resigned his fellowship in 1656 on accepting the college living of North Cadbury, Somersetshire. Here he devoted himself most assiduously to the work of the ministry, till he was ejected by the Uniformity Act of 1662. Life By the death of George Cradock he had become next heir male to Walter Cradock of Geesings, in the parish of Wickhambrook, Suffolk, who, dying shortly after Cradock's ejectment, left him his estate. Hereupon he took as his motto, Nec ingratus nec inutilis videar vixisse. Some years later he took his family to Geesings, and on the Royal Declaration of Indulgence (15 March 1672) he obtained a license (2 April) for himself as a 'presbyterian teacher,' and for his house as a place of worship. For twenty-four years he continued his ministrations gratuitously, living in good style as a country gentleman, and on excellent terms with Cowper, the vicar of Wickhambrook. He was never molested, and even when he opened under his own roof, prior to the Toleration Act, an academy for training young men in philosophy and theology, he escaped the interferences with which other nonconformist tutors were visited. Sons of presbyterian peers and gentry frequented his academy. Edmund Calamy, who was his pupil in philosophy (1686‚Äì8), gives a list, not exhaustive, of twelve who were his contemporaries, including his classmate Timothy Goodwin, then studying with a view to medicine, eventually promoted to the archbishopric of Cashel. The question arose whether nonconformist tutors were not violating their graduation oaths by prelecting outside the universities. Cradock drew up his reasons for believing that the oath referred simply to lectures in order to a degree. He drew up a paper in his own defence, which was afterwards published by Calamy. All the early nonconformist tutors lectured in Latin. Cradock's lectures were compilations, the systematic arrangement being his own; each student was expected to transcribe them. Calamy speaks very highly of the moral effect of Cradock's discipline, which was wise and friendly, and not too severe. The tutor was a pleasant and genial man, who enlivened his conversation with a spice of humour. Provision having been made on an adjoining estate in 1695 for the performance of dissenting worship at Wickhambrook, Cradock removed in 1696 to Bishop's Stortford, where he continued to preach, and soon became pastor of a congregational church in the neighbouring village of Stansted Mountfitchet (meeting-house erected about 1698). He was able to preach twice every Sunday till within a fortnight of his death on 7 October 1706, in his eighty-sixth year. He was buried at Wickhambrook on 11 October. A week later Samuel Bury delivered a funeral oration.Samuel Bury; (1707).

As an author he wrote under the pseudonyms Cyril Kay-Scott and Richard Irving Carson. His colorful life led to the epithet \\"the Casanova of Tropical Medicine\\". Early life and education Frederick Creighton Wellman was born on January 3, 1873 in Independence, Missouri, his father was Wheeler Montgomery Wellman and his mother was Nellie Jane (Blake) Wellman. He attended the Central High School, Kansas City before going on to study medicine at the Medical Department, University of Kansas, Kansas City in 1894 conducting his clinical studies at Rush and Cook County hospitals in Chicago. He also studied Natural science and social science at the University of Chicago before moving to England to study clinical pathology at various hospitals and tropical medicine and hygiene at the London School of Tropical Medicine where he achieved a diploma in 1904. He also appears to have studied at the Chicago Theological Seminary for a Bachelor of Divinity degree with a thesis entitled Physical obstacles to evangelization which was completed in 1895. Portuguese West Africa and Tulane In 1896 he took up a post in Portuguese West Africa as a medical missionary for a British charity, in the travelling with his first wife, Lydia Jeanette Isely (1869-1948), where he remained for nine years. During his time in Portuguese West Africa he was said to have \\"gone native\\", to the horror of the missionaries he was working alongside. In 1907 Wellman was involved, as a scientist, in the exploration of the route of the Benguela railway. In Africa he undertook research, publishing many papers and he had a correspondence with the American Society of Tropical Medicine. After leaving Africa he returned to London where he studied entomology and soon he had gained some renown in that field. From 1909-1911 he was a professor of tropical medicine at the Oakland (California) College of Medicine. By 1911 Lydia and Wellman, who by now had four children were divorced. He married his second wife, the concert pianist Edna Willis, at Buffalo, New York in 1908. He also travelled to Honduras in 1912 where he met and befriended Seely Dunn, a railroad engineer who was constructing a railroad in that country for the United Fruit Company. That year he published a paper entitled The New Orleans School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in the American Journal of Epidemiology under the name \\"Dr Creighton Wellman\\", this paper set out a plan for the creation of a new independent school of public health. Wellman had been appointed chair of tropical medicine and hygiene at Tulane in 1911. The founding of a school of tropical medicine and hygiene at Tulane was largely funded by the American Society of Tropical Medicine and it was largely funded by a donation of US$25,000 by the businessman Samuel Zemurray. However, Wellman unexpectedly departed this post on December 26, 1913, when he suddenly eloped with the then 20 year old Elsie Dunn, the daughter of his friend from Honduras, Seely Dunn. The couple moved to New York City where the adopted the aliases of Cyril Kay-Scott and Evelyn Scott. Wellman was editor of the American Journal of Tropical Diseases and Preventive Medicine from 1913 to 1915. Brazil As Elsie was a minor, and Wellman had travelled state lines over with her, the Dunns reported him to the police so soon after they got to New York, they fled to London living for a time in Bloomsbury as husband and wife. At some point Wellman realized that they were about to be recognized and he was able to persuade the British Museum to send him to South America to collect insect specimens. The couple took a steamer from Southampton to Rio de Janeiro. However he was unable to fulfil his commitment to the Museum as it would give his identity away. Wellman was able to obtain a position as a bookkeeper at a shop selling Singer Sewing Machines. While in Brazil they lived in poverty, staying for six years and while there where Elsie gave birth to their son Creighton Scott. This period is recounted in Escapade a memoir Elsie wrote under her pseudonym of Evelyn Scott While in Brazil Wellman completed the manuscript of his novel Blind Mice, which was not published until 1921. At the shop, helped by his ability to speak Portuguese and his reporting of the manager's embezzlement, he gained promotion to auditor and then to superintendent which meant that the couple to move to Natal, where Creighton ‚ÄúJigg‚Äù Scott was born on October 26, 1914. Maud Dunn, Elsie's mother, had by this time arrived in Brazil on a one-way ticket paid for by Seely Dunn who then divorced Maud for desertion. The family, now including Elsie's mother, relocated to a sheep ranch located in an isolated rural area where the couple both began to compose poems and prose, for publication at home in the United States. They abandoned the ranch in 1917 to move to Villa Nova where Wellman had gained a position in a manganese prospecting with the International Ore Corporation and in 1919 they went back to New York to get medical treatment for Elsie. Career as an artist As the Scotts, they lived in Greenwich Village for two years where they were able to interact with other writers. \\"Cyril\\" and \\"Evelyn\\" maintained their writing but the relationship was in difficulties and the couple separated. Wellman's novels were critically acclaimed but they were not commercially successful and he found himself in some debt and, to try and improve his situation, he tried to reconcile with Evelyn. In 1922, the couple were living in Bermuda and were hosts to the artist Owen Merton who encouraged Wellman to take up watercolors while at the same time carrying on an affair with Evelyn. The following year the couple toured Europe but became more estranged. In Paris, Wellman studied art and lived as a successful artist, embarking on an affair with a woman known as Madame Elise which ended when his lover suddenly died. Wellman then returned to America with his son Creighton to legally dissolve their common- law marriage relationship with Evelyn, he achieved this through some form of divorce proceedings in Chihuahua, Mexico in 1928. However the two remained close and Wellman wrote admiringly of her in his autobiography. He began to work as an art teacher, establishing an art school in Santa Fe, New Mexico which was taken over by the University of Denver as a summer school in 1931 and he was appointed as director of the Denver Art Museum, going on to become the Dean of the College of Fine Arts at the University of Denver, a position he held until at least 1934. While he was in Santa Fe he married the children's author Phyllis Crawford, who was then a writer for the New Yorker Magazine. They were divorced in 1931. Later life Wellman worked for a while on a project for the New Deal era Works Progress Administration with Creighton before he finally retired. In 1943 he published his first autobiography Life is Too Short which was dedicated to his children and grandchildren. He died in Chapel Hill, North Carolina on September 3, 1960. His colorful private life, involving no less than four marriages and one elopement has led to him being dubbed the \\"Casanova of tropical medicine\\". Family He married at least four times, if the apparently common law relationship with Evelyn Scott is included. With his first wife, Lydia, he had four children. Two of his sons with Lydia, Paul Wellman and Manly Wade Wellman were notable authors, the other Frederick Lovejoy Wellman became a respected phytopathologist and their daughter Alice Wellman Harris was also an author of children's books and theater director and producer. He had one child with Evelyn Scott, Creighton \\"Jigg\\" Scott (1914-1965). Wellman was one of the few people to gain the distinction of being listed in the American Who's Who under two names, Frederick Creighton Wellman and Cyril Kay-Scott. At some point he did legally change his name to Cyril Kay-Scott. Bibliography As Cyril Kay Scott Wellman published the following books: *Blind Mice George H.

Early life and education  Bob Paul Kane was born in Cleveland, Ohio. As a child he attended the Cleveland Museum School, where he received his initial exposure to drawing and painting, and later at the Cleveland Institute of Art in 1953-54. In 1955 he enrolled in Cornell University, but left after a year to pursue painting, heading to Provincetown, Massachusetts, where he met the sculptor Chaim Gross. The two developed a close relationship, and Kane returned with the Gross family back to New York in the fall of 1956. At Gross‚Äô encouragement, he began studying at the Art Students League of New York, as well as for a one year scholarship to Pratt Institute in 1958. At the Art Students League, Kane studied with George Grosz, as well as Will Barnet, who would become one of his greatest influences. Barnet‚Äôs class was where he met the Belgian student Eva Marie Honigman, in 1961, whom he married three years later. She worked as a textile designer, and her bold sense of color and design inspired him. ‚ÄúShe is by far the greatest influence on me. When I first met her, her French feeling for gaiety impressed me and has become a major part of my work.‚Äù  Artistic style  Kane is known for this synthesis of a colorful impressionist palette with a decidedly American sensibility. His works are full of lively brushwork and spontaneity, described by critic Richard J. Boyle as a ‚Äúfast and furious style of painting.‚Äù MoMA Curator John Elderfield notes that Kane‚Äôs paintings ‚Äúlook back through Philip Guston‚Äôs coloration and seek to pursue the brightness and freedom associated with Henri Matisse‚Äôs palette.‚Äù From Will Barnet, Kane learned structure and control of space and depth but his most quintessential passion was for color. Barnet says of Kane: \\"The very first time I saw Bob Kane's work I recognized his unique talent. His painting had an energy and an explosive force. This combined with an underlined passion for nature in all its elements has dominated his work throughout his career.‚Äù He was first and foremost inspired by travels to beach towns in the Mediterranean, where he soaked in sensuous subject matter, laden with intense light and color. He often painted with watercolor on location and then created oil paintings back in his New York studio. On painting en plein air, Kane says, ‚ÄúI have been lucky in my studios, my one in Rome was a caf√© across from the Pantheon and in Venice a gondoliere offered me his gondola when he was not using it.‚Äù His travels took him to France, Italy, Spain, Greece, and Morocco, specifically cities such as Nice, Positano, Naples, Cannes, and Venice. Visits to Nice‚Äôs March√© aux Fleurs, for instance, inspired the artist‚Äôs flower still lifes. On his approach, Kane says, ‚ÄúI have tried to eliminate a vase sitting on a table, but rather make the flowers surround you as in a garden yet maintaining the logic of the picture plane and structure, and this concept is with me in all my compositions. The problem for the figurative painter, I believe, is to capture the wildness of abstraction and use it to give life to the objects he loves.‚Äù  Popularity  Kane enjoyed great popularity among actors. Provincetown in the late 1960s was a hub for artists and theater people. It was there that he met some actors who would later collect his work, including Frederic Kimball.Painting by Bob Paul KaneMany of his works were acquired by Connie and Jerry Wald, the film producer. Connie Wald was one of his staunchest supporters, introducing his work to many of her friends in the film world, and establishing Kane in California. Mrs. Wald introduced Bob's work to Audrey Hepburn. They developed a life-long friendship, and a large collection of Kane's paintings. Her son, Sean Hepburn Ferrer said Audrey loved Bob's work and owned twenty of his paintings. Hepburn wrote to Bob on January 30, 1973 \\"I am permanently indebted to you for all of the gaiety you have brought to our house.\\" Around this time in the early 1970s, Kane also met other actors, such as Jill Clayburgh, Al Pacino, and later Brian Cox, Irina Brook, and Faye Grant who also acquired his work. Other celebrity collectors include Jamie Lee Curtis and Mary Tyler Moore. Paul Benedict also bought many of Kane‚Äôs paintings as gifts for theater friends and wedding presents. In 1970, Joseph Hishhorn of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden bought Kane‚Äôs paintings of Vence, home of Matisse near the end of his life. Also a major art collector, his wife Olga Hirschhorn became a supporter of Kane: \\"Joe Hirshhorn introduced me to Bob Kane's work in the early sixties. Joe was expanding his art collection and I was starting mine. Kane‚Äôs paintings reflect his love of Italy, France, and Spain as he returns each year to portray intimate scenes of everyday activity. Vibrant, warm colors dominate his palette, as they display his love for life, people, and friendly places. Capturing scenes of local color most people might miss, his titles reflect his eye for diverse interest.\\" Along with the Walds and the Hirshhorns, Edward Broida was one of Kane‚Äôs most important collectors. Broida was known for his adventurous and independent-minded collection that he donated to New York's Museum of Modern Art in 2005. The museum chose 175 works from his collection of more than 700 pieces. They chose 65 sculptures, 44 paintings, 54 drawings, and 12 prints. The donation included works by 32 artists who were already represented in the Museum‚Äôs collection, with major pieces by Richard Artschwager, Bruce Nauman, and Martin Puryear, as well as bodies of work by Philip Guston, Vija Celmins, Mark di Suvero, Joel Shapiro, and Ken Price. Also included in the donation were works by six artists new to the MoMA's collection: Bob Kane, John Lees, Jeanne Silverthorne, Susana Solano, David Webster, and Daisy Youngblood.  Exhibitions  Kane presented solo exhibitions at Bertha Schaefer Gallery in New York, Ankrum Gallery in Los Angeles, Galerie Marcel Bernheim in Paris, the Mus√©e de St. Paul de Vence in France, the American Embassy in Tokyo, Japan and Berne, Switzerland. Kane began working with Harmon-Meek Gallery in Naples, Florida in 1987 at the suggestion of Will Barnet. \\"Barnet has had thousands of students since the early 1950s and yet Kane was the only one he ever recommended to join him as a gallery artist at this gallery, the gallery he has been associated with since 1970.\\" He had twenty-five exhibitions there since 1989. Hollis Taggart Gallery in New York presented a solo exhibition of Bob Kane‚Äôs work entitled ‚ÄúJourney into Color‚Äù in 2006. His works are included in more than thirty museum permanent collections.

Morris, \\"3-Axis acceleration switch for traumatic brain injury early warning,\\" 2012 IEEE 25th International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS), Paris, 2012, pp. 484-487. It is a small, compact device, only 5mm by 5mm, and measures acceleration in the x, y, and z axes. It was developed by the Army Research Laboratory for the purposes of traumatic brain injury (TBI) research and was first introduced in 2012 at the 25th International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS). The three-axis acceleration switch was designed to obtain acceleration data more effectively than a conventional accelerometer in order to more accurately characterize the forces and shocks responsible for TBI. While miniature accelerometers require a constant power draw, the three-axis acceleration switch only draws current when it senses an acceleration event, using up less energy and allowing the use of smaller batteries. The three-axis acceleration switch has shown to exhibit an expected battery lifetime that is about 100 times better than that of a digital accelerometer. In return, however, the acceleration switch has a lower resolution than that of a digital or analog accelerometer. One potential application of the three-axis acceleration switch is in studying the head impacts of players in high-risk contact sports. Due to the size of conventional accelerometers, measuring the acceleration requires the device to be implemented inside the player's helmet, which is designed to mitigate the collision forces and thus may not accurately reflect the true level of injury potential. In contrast, the miniature nature of the acceleration switch makes it easier for the switch to be affixed directly onto the participant's head.

The case remained unsolved until DNA evidence surfaced in the 2000s and charges were brought against a convicted rapist, who was subsequently tried and received the death penalty. Background Angela \\"Angie\\" Marie Samota was born on 19 September 1964, in Alameda, California. She enrolled at the Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas and was a part of the Zeta Tau Alpha sorority. She was studying computer science and electrical engineering. Assault On the night of 12 October 1984, Samota and two friends, one male and one female, went on the town to the State Fair of Texas. Samota's boyfriend did not join them, because, according to the subsequent police report, he was working in construction and had to get up early the next morning. Participating in the night's festivities were also fans of the University of Texas football team that was to face the University of Oklahoma for the annual Red River Showdown. The three friends went to the Rio Room dance club and stayed there until \\"after midnight.\\" According to subsequent testimony of the male who accompanied the two girls, Samota \\"was going [from] table to table, talking to people\\" and seemed like \\"she knew everyone.\\" Afterwards, Samota drove her two companions to their homes, first dropping off the male at around 1 a.m. at his apartment on Matilda Street, in Lower Greenville, which was a five-minute walk from Samota's condo on Amesbury Drive, and then the female. The man later testified that, when he returned home, \\"he went to bed and fell asleep.\\" Samota next went by her boyfriend's apartment to say goodnight, and then returned to her place. Œ§he boyfriend subsequently stated that around 1:45 a.m. he got a call from Samota who told him there was a man in her condo who asked her to use the phone and the bathroom. It was not made clear by her if the man was already there when she got home, or if she allowed him to come in. \\"Talk to me,\\" Samota reportedly said to her boyfriend, then said she would call right back and hung up. When she did not call back, the boyfriend phoned her and no one answered. He drove to her condo but there was no response when he knocked on the door, which was locked. He had with him an early-generation mobile phone, provided for his construction job, so he called information who connected him to the police. Police officers arrived at 2:17 a.m. and broke through the door. They discovered Samota's dead, bloody, and naked body on the bed. The autopsy showed that the victim had been raped and then \\"repeatedly\\" stabbed, dying from wounds to her heart. Investigation and arrest For a long period of time, the police reportedly suspected an architect who was 23 years old at the time and living in a Lower Greenville apartment. He was the man who had gone out with Samota and another girl the night of the murder. The victim's boyfriend was also reportedly a suspect. The case remained unsolved until 2008. In 2006, then-Dallas police detective Linda Crum, tasked with the case, used the DNA evidence from blood, semen, and fingernail samples to try and find a match among persons with a criminal record. In 2008, the results pointed to a Donald Bess who, at the time of Samota's murder, was on parole while serving a 25-year sentence. Claims by friend Sheila Wysocki, who went to SMU and was a roommate of Samota, subsequently claimed that the case was re-opened only because she kept \\"badgering\\" the police until \\"they were so sick and tired of\\" her that they assigned detective Crum to re-examine it. Wysocki credits the fact that she became a licensed private investigator to her desire to assist in solving Samota's murder. The police initially had stated the rape kit collected at the crime scene had been lost \\"in the [Dallas] floods.\\" Legal process The defendant in the 2010 trial for the sexual assault and murder of Angela Samota was already in prison, serving a life sentence. Donald Andrew Bess Jr., born in 1948 in Arkansas, had been previously convicted in 1978 for aggravated sexual assault and aggravated kidnapping. He had been sentenced to 25 years in prison, and was out on parole by 1984, when he raped and murdered Samota. In 1985, in a case unrelated to Samota's murder, Bess was sentenced in Harris County, Texas to life imprisonment for one count of aggravated rape, one count of aggravated kidnapping and one count of sexual assault. During the 2010 trial's punishment phase, other women testified that they had also been raped by Bess. The defendant's ex-wife testified that he abused her and their child during their marriage. They had wed in 1969 and divorced three years later. On the basis of the DNA match, Bess was found guilty by the jury and, on 8 June 2010, received the death sentence. On 6 March 2013, the appeal filed by Bess was rejected and the judgement of the trial court was affirmed. On 13 August 2013, a certiorari petition was filed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and denied on 13 January 2014. In April 2016, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals refused an appeal submitted by Bess, upholding the findings of the Dallas County trial court. Aftermath In 2016, the Dallas Police Department re-established a unit dedicated to researching old cases. Donald Bess remains on death row in Polunsky prison with no execution date set. Samota's body is buried in the Llano Cemetery, Amarillo, Texas.Angela Samota grave at Llano Cemetery, The U.S. Cemeteries Project Sheila Wysocki lives in Tennessee and is still a practicing private investigator.

It was released in Japan in April 2018, with English releases in North America, Europe, and Australia the following month. A sequel to Dillon's Rolling Western, it takes place in a post-apocalyptic world and features Dillon, an anthropomorphic armadillo who must defend frontier villages from walking rock-like monsters. The player is included in the game's cast as their Mii avatar in the form of an \\"Amiimal\\" with added animal features from various species. It received mixed reviews from critics, who most greatly criticized its repetitiveness.  Plot  The game has a darker setting compared to its predecessor, changing its world to be post- apocalyptic. From their home base in The City, Dillon and a band of mercenaries help defend smaller towns and other locations from the Grock invasion.  Gameplay  The game is a combination of tower defense and action elements. The player must defend against walking rock monsters called Grocks. Mercenaries and the player's avatar use guns to fight the monsters from towers while the player controls Dillon and dashes around the map to fight the monsters one on one. The Grocks have several stages in their invasion process - once they finish attacking on land, their mothership transforms them into vehicles that race around the roadways of the map. In the third phase, the Grocks become superpowered and charge directly at the base.  Development  The game's setting was changed away from Western-themed to post-apocalyptic because it was seen as more of a familiar setting to modern audiences. Its producer, Kensuke Tanabe, said it drew inspiration from Mad Max and was originally only going to be a racing game, but the old gameplay was later combined with the new.  Reception  Dillon's Dead-Heat Breakers received an aggregate score of 69/100 on Metacritic. Neal Ronaghan of Nintendo World Report rated the game 8.5/10, saying that while the game was greatly improved from its predecessors, its pace was overly slow. CJ Andriessen of Destructoid rated it 75/100, calling it a \\"solid adventure through and through\\", but criticizing the existence of a game-breaking bug on release. He also stated that the process of mission preparation was \\"arduous\\" and the game's economy \\"baffling\\". Daniel Starkey of GameSpot rated the game 6/10, saying that while it was \\"action-packed\\", the controls were \\"perplexing\\" and the combat and day- night cycle were repetitive. He stated that \\"it's a competent and fun little outing that's almost perfectly suited for kids\\".

They married, and under Chaffee's influence Gilmore began concentrating more on her painting and less on her prints. Gilmore and Chaffee returned to Provincetown in 1928, where she died in 1955. Career Gilmore exhibited her prints at the 1915 Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition. With the other members of the Provincetown Printers, she developed a new style of printmaking using multiple colors on a single printing block, separated by white lines. Her prints have been described as \\"softer and more imaginative than the severely geometric\\" prints of the other members of the collective. Gilmore's works are included in the collections of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Gallery of Canada, the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Indianapolis Museum of Art, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

Early life Oelrichs was born on August 27, 1858, in Baltimore, Maryland. He was the son of German-born Henry Ferdinand Oelrichs (1810‚Äì1875), a senior partner in the firm of Oelrichs & Lurman, and Julia Matilda (n√©e May) Oelrichs (1819‚Äì1879), who was born in Washington, D.C. His siblings included Hermann Oelrichs, an agent of Norddeutsche Lloyd shipping who married Theresa Alice Fair, daughter of United States Senator and Comstock Lode millionaire James Graham Fair; and Henry Oelrichs (1856‚Äì1902). Upon his older brother's death in 1906, Charles inherited the bulk of his estate. Oelrichs was the grandson of Gesche Catharina (n√©e Holler) Oelrichs and Johann Gerhard Oelrichs, a German merchant in Bremen. The Oelrichs came to America from Bremen around 1830. His grandfather later married a daughter of statesman Harrison Gray Otis. His maternal grandparents were Julia Matilda (n√©e Slacum) May and Frederick May, who was a member of the May family, prominent in Virginia and Maryland during the American Revolutionary War. Career Oelrichs' daughter Blanche (Michael Strange) In his youth, Charles was an amateur cowboy on a ranch near Cheyenne, Wyoming where \\"he 'punched' cows, 'broke' bronchos, and lassoed bulls.\\" Oelrichs then entered business, becoming a member of the New York Stock Exchange with the firm E. C. Potter Co. The firm was later known as C. M. Oelrichs & Co., which was in business for sixteen years until his retirement in 1912. Society life In 1892, Oelrichs and his wife Blanche were included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. Oelrichs was a member of the Union Club of the City of New York. The family spent summers in Newport, Rhode Island at their residence on Kay Street, amidst the Astors, the Vanderbilts, and numerous other wealthy elites of American society during the Gilded Age. The Oelrichs' were known for their lavish entertaining, including costume balls and dressing up in the \\"full regalia, including war paint and tomahawk\\". Personal life Marjorie. Oelrichs was married to Blanche de Loosey (1857‚Äì1932), the daughter of Chevalier Charles F. de Loosey, the Austrian Consul to New York. Blanche was also the sister of Emilie de Loosey, who was married to Theodore Havemeyer, a co-founder of the Newport Country Club. Together, the family lived in a town house on Madison Square and their summer cottage in Newport. Charles and Blanche were the parents of four children: * Natalie \\"Lily\\" Oelrichs (1880‚Äì1931), who married polo player Peter D. Martin of San Francisco. After his death, she married Heinrich Borwin Duke of Mecklenburg (1885‚Äì1942), the son of Duke Paul Frederick of Mecklenburg and Princess Marie of Windisch-Graetz, in 1915. They divorced in 1921. * Charles de Loosey Oelrichs (1882‚Äì1973), who married Marjorie Ramely Turnbull (1883‚Äì1952), sister of suffragist Alison Turnbull Hopkins. * Henry Edmond Oelrichs (1883‚Äì1944), who married Esther Moreland (1890‚Äì1941). * Blanche Marie Louise Oelrichs (1890‚Äì1950), the poet and playwright who married, and divorced, three times, to Leonard Moorhead Thomas, John Barrymore and Harrison Tweed. She also had a ten-year affair with Margaret Wise Brown. Oelrichs died in Newport on January 15, 1932. He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. His widow died later that year. Descendants Through his eldest daughter, he was the grandfather of Charles Oelrichs Martin, who was disinherited by his mother after her death. Through his son Charles, he was the grandfather of socialite Marjorie Oelrichs (1908‚Äì1937), who was married to band leader Eddy Duchin.Dictionary of American Biography. Page 188. 1959. Marjorie died six days after the 1937 birth of the couple's son, pianist and band leader Peter Oelrichs Duchin.

Frisbie. She was designed for use as a ferry between Vallejo and San Francisco. The steamer was successful in that role and was the fastest ship on the route when she began service. Improved roads, bridges, and automobiles reduced demand for ferry service in the Bay Area, and newer ships were optimized for transporting cars, so General Frisbie was retired in the late 1920s. In 1930 General Frisbie was sold and towed to Seattle. She was renamed Commander and operated as a ferry between Bremerton and Seattle beginning in 1931. Rather than the superior service with which she began her San Francisco service, in Seattle she was the cut-price competitor with limited capabilities, particularly for cars. She continued her runs until November 1935 when her owner was acquired in the midst of a strike by ferry workers. She was immediately retired from ferry service. The ship was sold again and converted into a floating salmon cannery in 1936. In 1937 and 1938 she sailed to Moser Bay on Kodiak Island, Alaska in the spring, and returned with cases of canned salmon in the fall. In 1939 her engine and other fittings were removed at Seattle. She was towed back to Moser Bay and beached in 1940 to become part of the permanent land-based cannery facility. In 1950 she was dismantled completely.  Ownership history  Captain Zephania Hatch, a steamboat captain with experience on Puget Sound and the Columbia River, began providing ferry service between San Francisco and Vallejo in 1895. His only ship Monticello, was faster than the competing vessels on the route, and so enjoyed commercial success. Zephania brought his brother Charles into the business, naming it Hatch Brothers Steamship Company. The company reinvested its profits, ordering the construction of its second ship, General Frisbie, in 1900. Hatch brought in a third partner in 1904 in order to fund the purchase of a third vessel, Arrow, in 1905. The new partnership, which owned General Frisbie, was incorporated as the Monticello Steamship Company. As the 1920s drew to a close, Zephania's sons, who ran the company after their father's death in 1913, considered the strategic challenge of the automobile to the ferry business and decided to sell. In February 1929 Monticello Steamship Company, including General Frisbie, was sold to the Golden Gate Ferry Company for US$2 million. The new owner had little use for the obsolescent ship and sold it in 1930 to the Union Ferry Company of Seattle, which leased it to the Washington Line. Both companies were headed by Captain William E. Mitchell and were affiliated with Kitsap County Transportation Company. The ship was renamed Commander by its new owners. On November 13, 1935, the Puget Sound ferry unions struck, shutting down the Black Ball ships. The next day Puget Sound Navigation Company made a deal to acquire Kitsap County Transportation Company, which operated the Washington Line. Just as in San Francisco, the acquiring company had no use for the obsolescent Commander and quickly sold her. In February 1936, Commander was sold to C.L. Bryant, a Seattle salvage broker, who resold her to Richard D. \\"Dick\\" Suryan. The Suryans of Anacortes, Washington were a Croatian immigrant family active in Northwest fisheries. Suryan, Inc, bought Commander in 1936 and converted it to a floating cannery. The company became insolvent and Commander was foreclosed on by Seattle First National Bank in 1938. The bank owned the ship through at least 1941. The Suryans regained ownership of the vessel by at least 1943 through their Far North Packing Company. In 1946, Libby, McNeill & Libby, purchased the Far North Packing Company, including the beached Commander.  Construction and modification  alt=Monochrome postcard showing a steamboat at sail, smoke billowing behind. Text reads: \\"Monticello S. S. Co's. Steamer \\"General Frisbie\\"-San Francisco and Vallejo, Cal.\\"  Initial construction  General Frisbie was built in New Whatcom, now part of Bellingham, Washington, in 1900. Her builder is variously reported as G.R. Whidden or the Bellingham Bay Improvement Company. Bellingham Bay Improvement Company owned both a lumber mill and waterfront real estate in the area, so both parties may have been involved. The hull was towed from New Whatcom to San Francisco by the steamer Rainier. On this delivery trip General Frisbie was laden with lumber for sale in San Francisco. After a placid trip down the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the ships were met by a sudden gale off Cape Flattery. After a two-day struggle with the storm, Rainier ran low on coal and returned to Seattle to refuel. She finally arrived in San Francisco on December 26, 1900 and General Frisbie began fitting out. Her steam engine, boilers, and lighting plant were installed in San Francisco. She had a four-cylinder, triple expansion steam engine which produced 1000 horsepower to drive a single propeller. The engine was manufactured by United Engine Works of San Francisco. Her boilers were built by Keystone Boiler Works. The boilers were oil-fired, which gave General Frisbie a speed advantage over her coal-fired competitors. In her initial configuration she was licensed to carry 450 passengers. Among her amenities was a dining room that sat sixty. Her initial cost, after fitting out, was estimated at $80,000. At some point during her time in San Francisco Bay, she was modified to carry 12 cars, loading through a side door. This small capacity was not competitive with purpose-built car ferries of the day. By way of example, the Southern Pacific ferry Lake Tahoe, built in 1927, could transport 59 cars. Her home port was San Francisco. She was named for General John B. Frisbie, a founder of Vallejo, California and son-in-law of General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, a pivotal figure in the transition of California from Mexican to American rule. Dimensions and machinery as built General Frisbie was 183.8 feet long, with a beam of 29.3 feet and a depth of hold of 11.6 feet. The overall size of the vessel was 670 gross tons. The vessel was fitted with a four cylinder triple expansion steam engine with cylinder diameters of , , and . The steamer was fitted with two return tube boilers which produced steam at 175 pounds working pressure. The overall power plant generated 1,000 horsepower.  Conversion to Puget Sound ferry  General Frisbie was towed to Seattle by the freighter Jane Nettleton, arriving February 15, 1930. Her new owners took bids for work on the pilot house, staterooms, companionways, and superstructure. At some point in her Seattle ferry career she had her boilers replaced. It is not clear whether this was part of the initial Seattle refit.  Conversion to floating cannery  Major modifications were made to Commander in 1936‚Äì37 to convert it from a ferry to a floating cannery. The conversion took place at the Seattle Shipbuilding and Drydock Company at the foot of 26th Avenue NW in Ballard. The original pilot house was removed and replaced with a much smaller structure. The upper deck was converted to accommodations for thirty workers while the lower deck was made into a fish processing plant and cannery. The old steam engine and boiler was replaced by a 4-cylinder \\"E\\" type Bolinder diesel engine. The large smokestack associated with the old steam engine was replaced by two much smaller funnels. A cargo crane was installed with the mast rising from the new pilot house and the boom swinging over the foredeck. A smaller crane was installed on the stem.The removal of the smokestack, and the addition of the funnels and cranes can be seen by comparing photos of the ship as a ferry and pictures of her as a cannery. one Two Approximately $75,000 was spent on the conversion. Her home port was changed to Juneau, Alaska.  Service history  alt=Two steamboats in a dock, with a wooden pier and one gray building. A third vessel is visible behind.  San Francisco ferry  General Frisbie entrance into San Francisco operations was marked by an \\"owner's trial\\" excursion on June 12, 1901, which included a number of friends and invited guests of the Hatch Brothers. Her first captain was George Wheeler Jr., who had previously been master of Hatch's Monticello. In normal operations, she and other Hatch steamers ran between pier 2 at the Mission Street Dock in San Francisco and her Vallejo terminal, near the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Travel time varied with the state of the tides, but she would typically complete the trip in ninety minutes. Her initial schedule had her sailing from San Francisco at 9:45am, and 3:15 and 8:30pm. She returned from Vallejo at 7:00am, and 12:30 and 6:00pm. A round trip ticket cost $1, except on Sundays when it was $0.75. Meals cost $0.50. The ship also ran excursions on holidays and for special events. For example, on July 4, 1923 she ran four- hour excursions around San Francisco Bay featuring dancing and refreshments for $1.50 per passenger. = Groundings and collisions = When General Frisbie began service in 1901 there were no electronic navigation aids, not even radios; the limit of maritime communications technology at the time was signal flags. The U.S. Coast Guard assigned General Frisbie \\"KQMH\\", but a flag hoist is only useful if it can be seen. The thick fogs in San Francisco Bay meant that groundings and collisions were frequent in the local ferry fleet. General Frisbie had its share of accidents.  Ramming of St Helena (1903)  At 10:30pm on October 19, 1903 General Frisbie was heading up the channel toward Vallejo while the steamer St Helena was sailing in the opposite direction for San Francisco. The two ships collided near Vallejo, with the bow of General Frisbie piercing the hull of St Helena. While General Frisbie was not critically damaged, St Helena promptly took on water and began to sink. Her captain drove her on to the mud flats at the edge of the channel where the ship settled onto the bottom. Her passengers were safely evacuated to shore while General Frisbie stood by to render assistance.  Collision with Iroquois (1912)  In a dense fog on October 3, 1912 General Frisbie, captained by Fred Olsen, hit the Southern Pacific freight steamer Iroquois. The collision carried away a portion of Iroquois' guard rail. General Frisbie sustained no damage in the mishap and was able to continue her run to San Francisco, but her passengers were \\"badly frightened\\". Iroquois was damaged badly enough that she was tied up at Mare Island.  Grounding on Anita Rock (1915)  Poster for the alt=A poster reading \\"1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, San Francisco, California\\". A woman in a classical white gown and a maroon shawl stands by ruined pillars, holding a wreath and looking down at a pool and part of a city, resembling the Palace of Fine Arts. The Panama-Pacific International Exposition was a big event in 1915 San Francisco. The Exposition grounds, in what is now the Marina District, had its own pier. On March 29, 1915 General Frisbie ran an excursion trip to this pier from Vallejo for Exposition dedication ceremonies. The number of passengers on board was variously reported at the time from 175 to 300, but all accounts agree that there were at least 45 children from the Good Temple Orphans Home in Vallejo. The trip from Vallejo to the Exposition was uneventful. The passengers reembarked at 9:00pm after their day at the Exposition. Captain Potwin decided to cruise along the shore to offer a final view of the Exposition's lights. The ship hit Anita Rock, just offshore from the Idaho Pavilion, at approximately 10pm. The ship initially listed but then largely righted herself. She was hard aground, unable to move, with the hull pierced and water flooding in. The passengers, particularly the children, had to be calmed by the crew to prevent panic. Captain Potwin used his steam whistle to signal the ship's distress. The nearby battleship USS Oregon responded by sending two steam launches. The lifesaving crews at Fort Point and Point Bonita also sent boats. All the passengers were rescued safely and taken back to the Exposition grounds. The rescue was aided by calm seas and searchlights trained on the scene from shore. The crew kept the ship's pumps running all night, just keeping up with the incoming water. At 9:30am on March 30, Crowley launch No. 1 and another vessel pulled General Frisbie off Anita Rock and into deeper water. Here a tug towed her to the Union Iron Works shipyard. Once in drydock, inspection of the hull revealed that 75 feet or roughly half of the keel had been torn off, as well as adjoining planking. The subsequent investigation of the accident focused on the Anita Rock buoy. General Frisbie was the third vessel in a month to hit Anita Rock. All three captains believed that the buoy had been moved 200 yards inshore without notice to the maritime community.  Sinking of Sehome (1918)  The fog was thick in San Pablo Bay on the morning of December 14, 1918. General Frisbie had just left Vallejo while the steamer Sehome was headed up the channel in the opposite direction. Both ships were proceeding slowly and using their steam whistles as fog signals. Nonetheless, at 8:30am General Frisbie rammed Sehome amidships on her port side. Both captains immediately assessed the damage as fatal to Sehome and acted accordingly. Captain Charles Sandhal of General Frisbie left his engines in gear so that the bow of his ship would continue to plug the hole in Sehome side and delay the inevitable sinking. Captain Fred Olsen of Sehome ordered all his passengers evacuated to General Frisbie. It so happened that a party of sailors from Mare Island Naval Shipyard was on board General Frisbie heading to a football game in Berkeley. The Navy men assisted in the rescue of Sehome passengers and were subsequently commended by the Secretary of the Navy for their efforts. Not only did they hand out life belts, but the Marine band struck up some ragtime tunes to calm the passengers. The ships remained locked together for fifteen minutes. After all 173 passengers and crew were rescued from Sehome, a tug towing a rock barge emerged from the fog and collided with General Frisbie stern. This blow wrenched her bow from the gash in the hull of Sehome, which promptly sank and came to rest on the mud bottom, awash to her upper deck. Ironically, Fred Olsen, captain of the sunken Sehome, had been captain of General Frisbie when it collided with Iroquois in 1912.  Puget Sound ferry  In 1930 ferry traffic across Puget Sound was dominated by the Puget Sound Navigation Company, also known as the \\"Black Ball Line\\". General Frisbie was brought to Seattle by Kitsap County Transportation Company to challenge Black Ball on the Seattle‚ÄìBremerton run, where Black Ball was the only operator. She was renamed Commander by her new owners. The fact that she had limited capacity to carry cars was less important on this route since hundreds of workers from Seattle commuted to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton every day for work. The ferry dock in Bremerton is within walking distance of the naval shipyard, so the workers did not need car service.Both the shipyard and ferry terminal are important points in Bremerton, so most area maps will show them. Commander's owners announced a round-trip price between Seattle and Bremerton of $0.60, undercutting Black Ball's $0.80 rate. The newspapers portrayed this as a \\"rate war\\" with \\"battle lines drawn\\". The board of Puget Sound Navigation Company, which ran the Black Ball Line, chose not to match the lower rate. Instead, it intervened with the Washington Department of Public Works, which regulated ferry service, in April 1930 to prevent Commander from operating. The case was fought up to the Washington Supreme Court which ruled in favor of the challengers on April 2, 1931. Commander began her daily runs after the Supreme Court victory. She sailed from the Canadian National dock at the foot of Marion Street in downtown Seattle. She was scheduled to leave Seattle at 6:00 and 9:30am and 1:00, 5:00, and 8:00pm. She returned from Bremerton at 8:00 and 11:45am and 3:15, 6:30, and 10:15pm. A round trip ticket cost $0.60. The Black Ball Line added the ferry Kalakala to the Seattle ‚Äì Bremerton route on July 2, 1935, competing with Commander. In November of that year, the unions struck the Black Ball Line but allowed Commander to continue service. This had the effect of allowing Puget Sound Naval Shipyard employees to get to work, while cutting off car ferry service to Bremerton, which only the Black Ball ships provided. Puget Sound Navigation Company responded to the unions' actions by acquiring its competitor's operations, including Commander. After an agreement with the ferry unions, Commander was retired in favor of Kalakala and towed to moorings in Kirkland on Lake Washington to await her fate.  Alaska cannery  The newly reconfigured Commander sailed north to Alaska on May 25, 1937. She returned to Puget Sound in the fall with 22,451 cases of canned salmon, which sold for $101,025.33. This amount was not sufficient to pay off the company's debts, so further financing was required. In spring 1938, Commander sailed again to Alaska to pursue her cannery operations. She returned to Anacortes in the fall with $106,353.22 worth of canned salmon, which again was insufficient to pay the company's debts. Suryan's, Inc. which owned the business was so short of cash that its pay-off checks to the crew of Commander at the end of the season bounced. The crew and some of the fishermen who sold their catch to the cannery blockaded the ship, forcing creditors to pay them before the canned salmon could be removed and sold. Disposition Although it seems likely that Commander missed the 1939 fishing season after she was repossessed by Seattle First National Bank, by 1940 she was tied to the cannery dock again in Moser Bay. Having had her engines removed in 1939, it is likely that she spent the remainder of her career there as part of the cannery operations until she was broken up in 1950. Another source reports that the diesel engine and fittings were removed from Commander in 1939 and the hull was towed to Kodiak, Alaska, where it was beached.

It is the second end-credit song for the film Stuart Little 2. It was recorded by Shawn Colvin for the film and included in the Stuart Little 2 soundtrack, released on July 19, 2002. Background Bonnie Greenberg and Christy Gerhardt, music supervisors for Stuart Little 2, sent Roxanne Seeman the script for Stuart Little 2, asking whether she would write a song. Roxanne Seeman wrote the song with Holly Knight. \\"Hold on to the Good Things\\" was written specifically for a montage scene in the movie where the family is in the dining room. During a long period of editing where changes were made to scenes in the movie, the recording of the song was put on hold. By the time \\"Hold On To The Good Things\\" was recorded, the movie was locked, hence it was chosen for the second end-credit song, out of 120 songs under consideration. Soundtrack After Glen Brunman of Sony Music Soundtrax heard ‚ÄúHold On To The Good Things‚Äù, the lyrics in the chorus were revised: the words ‚Äúsilvery lining‚Äù from the last line of the second verse going into the chorus, was repeated as ‚Äúsilver lining‚Äù in the second line of the chorus, replacing ‚Äúkindness‚Äù. During the recording session, Shawn Colvin recorded both lyric versions. The original unedited version was used in the film. An edited version with the lyric revision in the chorus appears on the soundtrack. The song was produced by Marc Tanner. Ken Karman was the music editor of the film The soundtrack, Music from and Inspired by Stuart Little 2, was released by Epic Records on July 19, 2002 on Audio CD and Compact Cassette.

The album was recorded in guitarist Phil Douglas' studio, The Hobo House and released on bassist Mike Bruno's Dead Broke Rekerds. Background In 2008 and 2009 respectively, the band released Demo 2008 and the Shitty Rambo EP amassing a sizable underground following and critical buzz. During this time the band almost broke up with guitarist Brian Crozier having to step down from the band due to illness and bassist John Mee being ejected due to tensions within the band. Rob McAllister of Capital and Mike Bruno of Down In The Dumps, Jonesin' and Get Bent were chosen to replace Crozier and Mee respectively. This lineup began writing their first full length immediately following the inclusion of McAllister and Bruno into the band with \\"In One Ear\\" and \\"Timecop\\"- originally released on the band's 2008 Demo- being re- recorded for the album. This album is notable for featuring \\"Cutesy Monster Man\\" and \\"Time Keeps On Slipping Into The (Cosmic) Future\\", 2 songs that would go on to be fan favorites and permanent fixtures of the band's set list.

Punknews.org gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and stating, \\"Iron Chic's songs are each very anthemic with a lot of vocal harmonies backed by '90s emo guitars, along with those very distorted bass tones that always have a heavy presence in my favorite songs on the album; the drums range from keeping a solid mid-tempo presence to the full punk rock gallop in a few places. All of these elements are met with lyrics that demand to be sung along to.\\" Exclaim! gave the album a glowing review stating \\"An essential aspect of Iron Chic's success on Not Like This is vocalist Jason Lubrano's oft-poetic lyrics...it's extremely listenable while still possessing the charming air of being recorded in a Long Island basement. These songs are designed for sing-alongs in dive bars and at basement shows, but the lyrics make it deserving of a focused listen. It's easy to get behind something so sincere, genuine and legitimately inspiring. Rate Your Music has the album rated at 3.51 stars out of 5 based on 140 ratings indicating favorable reviews.

Biography  La Zowi was born in Paris, France and raised in Granada, Spain, although she has lived in diverse European cities such as Marseille, London, Barcelona and Madrid, where she currently resides. She is the daughter of artists (her mother is a feminist poet and her father, Patrice Jean Marcel Jeanneau, a flamenco guitarist known as El Yerbita). She grew up listening to Flamenco, which she said \\"it has been my environment and my way of life. Latin and African music have also become the basis of my references. She also has a child called Romeo with the Spanish rapper .  Musical career  She began her musical career creating music with friends in La Vendicion Records, among whom were the members of Los Santos (later known as Pxxr Gvng). She started recording with them In her songs, she speaks mainly of social issues associated to trap music, such as drugs, money and putas (bitches in Spanish). In several interviews she has expressed that she does not like her own voice. In her lyrics, social constructs such as money, putas, drugs and her \\"goonies\\" are repeated throughout her songs. Her most common catchphrase is \\"La Zowi Puta\\". She released her first track \\"Raxeta\\" in 2013 through YouTube. The word \\"raxeta\\" is an adaptation to the English word \\"ratchet\\", a slang word which refers to girls of humble origin that dress in a striking manner. \\"For me, a ratchet is someone like me, a humble neighborhood girl who wears cheap clothes and imitations of luxury brands, and does it provocatively.\\" She has collaborated with almost every artist who work with La Vendicion Records, such as Bea Pelea or La Goony Chonga, and has worked recurrently with the producer Zora Jones. On November 22 she took his first mixtape, titled \\"Ama de casa\\", published by the same label. The mixtape has vocal collaborations from Albany, Flynt Hustle and GOA, as well as the producers DP Beats, Steve Lean, Barla, Oddlaw or Tweak. La Zowi, together with Alizzz, were also in charge of introducing the second season of the musical show El Bloque TV, which is broadcast on YouTube. In one of her interviews with WAG1 Magazine in 2016, La Zowi defined what trap was for her, a movement that gone viral during that year. According to what the artist commented, trap is \\"money and drugs\\" but also a way for women to empower. In addition to her facet as a singer, she has also worked as a model to promote La Vendicion Records label, on where she publishes her songs. In 2020, she publishes her last work called \\"Elite\\" and goes back to the talk show La Resistencia to present it. It is a 9-song album which mixes her distinctive concepts with experimental electronic sounds. Zora Jones, Pablo Chill-E and Paul Marmota are some artists that have collaborations in Elite. She debuts for the first time as an artist in the Spanish TV series Cristina La Veneno, created by Los Javis (:es:Javier Ambrossi and :es:Javier Calvo), playing the role of Monroy, a famous Spanish television character. Thematic and controversion In an interview for \\"INDIE\\" la Zowi has described herself as a feminist, supporting women who sexualize themselves. Regarding her music and lyricism, she has stated that it relies a lot on her lifestyle and thought-provoking material. She described herself as a feminist: \\"Yes, I am a feminist: I believe in equality between women and men. But I really don't feel represented by the kind of feminism that tries to embarrass women who sexualize themselves.\\" In January 2019, comedian Broncano interviewed her on the TV program La Resistencia. The interview caused controversial reactions on social networks, especially through Twitter. A few days later, Yolanda Dom√≠nguez published an article in the entitled \\"Is la Zowi a feminist icon?\\", criticizing the feminism proclaimed by the singer, who declares that she faces sexism in the industry with her letters. She has also been criticized because of her shows for being too punk, sexual and explicit.

The game runs on a freemium model, and is supported through the use of microtransactions. The premise of the game is simple; players begin by picking which faction they would like to be a part of. There are three factions. The Tyrannar Empire, The Sovereignty, and The Intergalactic Alliance. Whichever decision the player makes, will ultimately effect the way the rest of their game-play looks, feels, and functions. Each player has their own starbase, and fleets they have to upgrade in order to defend themselves from other players, or even attack other players and non-player characters (NPCs). Players can earn experience points and level up by upgrading their fleets and starbase, completing game missions, and engaging in live combat with other players and NPCs.  Plot   Development  Original directors, developers, and producers included Mike Wallis, who has worked on titles such as Eve Online, and Chris Bernert, whose titles include games like The Lord of the Rings Online, and Dungeons & Dragons Online. Current directors, developers, and producers include John Balestrieri, who oversaw the original game's development, and is an adviser to international gaming and media companies around the world, and Miko≈Çaj Marcisz.

It connects U.S. Route 1 (US 1) and State Route 9 to the Maine Turnpike (Interstate 95, I-95), as well as I-295 and The Maine Mall. Except at its endpoints, it is a four-lane freeway with a speed limit. The SR 703 designation is only indicated on mileposts, which increase from east to west as opposed to the standard practice of increasing from west to east. All other signage refers to the routes to which it connects (I-95, I-295, US 1 and SR 114).  Route description  SR 703 begins at an at-grade intersection with Main Street (US 1/SR 9) just north of the Scarborough town line. Heading westbound, the highway meets the northbound Scarborough Connector, which connects to I-295 north. After crossing under I-295, a second exit connects directly to The Maine Mall. Traffic then passes through a barrier toll as the highway terminates at a trumpet interchange with the Maine Turnpike. There are four exits heading eastbound: the first serves The Maine Mall, the second connects directly to I-295 north, the third connects to Broadway in South Portland, and the fourth connects with the southbound Scarborough Connector, which carries traffic towards US 1/SR 9 in downtown Scarborough.  History  The Maine Turnpike Approach Road has existed in some form since the Maine Turnpike first opened to traffic in 1947. Various improvements and upgrades, including the construction of the southern section of I-295 in 1971, have resulted in the modern freeway that exists today. The SR 703 number was first introduced in official correspondence in 2004 and was later made an official (albeit unsigned) designation.

EU approval On 23 October 2000, the European Commission issued marketing approval for Hexavac and for Infanrix hexa. Marketing approval for Hexavac was suspended in November 2005, on the advice of the agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in view of the variability of its long-term protection against hepatitis B. In April 2012, the manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur voluntarily withdrew the product from the market. The European Commission formally withdrew marketing permission on 28 June 2012. On 21 June 2012, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a positive scientific opinion on Hexaxim for use outside the EU, in cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO). On 17 April 2013, marketing approval in the EU was granted to Hexyon and to Hexacima. On 15 February 2016, marketing approval in the EU was granted to Vaxelis. US approval On 21 December 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed a hexavalent combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) adsorbed, inactivated poliovirus (IPV), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate (meningococcal protein conjugate) and hepatitis B (HepB) (recombinant) vaccine, DTaP-IPV-Hib- HepB (Vaxelis), for use as a three-dose series in infants at ages two, four, and six months. On 26 June 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to include DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB in the federal Vaccines for Children Program (VFC).

Her father Li Siguang and husband Chen-Lu Tsou were also prominent scientists and academicians.  Early life and education  Li Lin with her parents in the 1930s Li was born Li Xizhi () in Beijing on 31 October 1923, with her ancestral home in Huanggang, Hubei Province. Her father Li Siguang (J. S. Lee) was a renowned geologist and professor at Peking University, and her mother Xu Shubin () was a pianist and schoolteacher. Her father was of Mongol descent, whose grandfather was a Mongolian beggar who migrated to Hubei in search of a better livelihood. Her family originally had the Mongol surname \\"Kuli\\" () or \\"Ku\\" (). From 1934 to 1936, she lived in England where her father was teaching. After the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, her family sought refuge in Shanghai and then in Guilin, Guangxi, which was free from Japanese occupation. In Guilin, she changed her name to Li Lin and attended Guangxi University, graduating in 1944 with a degree in mechanics. She worked at the Aviation Institute in Chengdu, and with the help of Joseph Needham, won a British Cultural Council scholarship to study at the University of Birmingham in 1946. After earning her master's degree in 1948, she continued her studies at the Department of Metallurgy at the University of Cambridge, where she met and married fellow Chinese scientist Chen-Lu Tsou. She became also known as Anna Tsou.  Career  After they both earned their PhDs in 1951, Li and Tsou returned to the newly established People's Republic of China. Li worked for the Shanghai Institute of Metallurgy, and Tsou for the Shanghai Institute of Physiology and Biochemistry, both under the umbrella of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). She and her colleagues won a prize for their research in spherical graphite in 1956. In 1956, nuclear physicist Qian Sanqiang recruited Li to work on China's nuclear energy program. After finishing her heavy water reactor project, in 1958 she was transferred to the Institute of Physics of the CAS in Beijing. She spent the next 14 years working on the nuclear program. In 1972 or 1973, she was transferred again to the Institute of High Energy Physics to work on high-temperature superconductivity. Li was elected as an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1980, and won the State Science and Technology Progress Award (First Class) in 1992 for her contribution to the research of superconductivity. She also advised dozens of graduate students and published more than 100 research papers.  Personal life  Li and Tsou at their wedding, with her parents Li Siguang and Xu Shulin Li married Chen-Lu Tsou (Zou Chenglu), a fellow Chinese student at Cambridge, in 1948. Her father Li Siguang was in England to preside over their wedding. Tsou later recalled the Cambridge years as the best time of the family. Their daughter, geologist Zou Zongping (), was born in the 1950s in China. Tsou became a prominent biochemist and was also elected an academician of the CAS, making the Li-Tsou family the only one in China that produced three academicians (including Li Siguang).

The border consists of two non-contiguous sections totalling 253 km (157 m) in length, the larger section of which divides the island of Timor in two. Description Western (Oecusse) section The Municipality of Oecusse forms an exclave of East Timor in Indonesian West Timor (part of East Nusa Tenggara province). The border starts in the west at the coast of the Savu Sea, proceeding overland to the south to the Noel Besi River, which it then follows south, then east, then south. The border then turns east overland briefly, before turning to the north, utilising various rivers such as the Ekan, Sonau and Bilomi, before proceeding northwards overland to the Savu coast. Eastern section The border between Indonesia and the main part of East Timor starts in the north at the Savu Sea coast, and proceeds south and then east via the Talu river. It then turns south along the Malibacu river, and then west along the Tafara river, then south along the Massin river down to the coast at the Timor Sea. History The border crossing at Mota'ain-Batugade The division of the island of Timor dates to the colonial period. During the 15th-16th centuries both the Netherlands and Portugal began taking an interest in the Spice Islands of modern Indonesia. In the 17th century the Dutch occupied the western half of the island as part of its Dutch East Indies colony. In 1702 Portugal occupied eastern Timor and declared the creation of Portuguese Timor. On 20 April 1859 a treaty was signed (ratified 1860) which formally divided the island between the Netherlands and Portugal, with a border based on existing Timorese states which were assigned to either Portugal or the Netherlands.Tratado de demarca√ß√£o e troca de algumas possess√µes portuguezas e neerlandezas no Archipelago de Solor e Timor entre sua magestade el-rei de Portugal e sua magestade el-rei dos Paizes Baixos assignado em Lisboa pelos respectivos plenipotenciarios aos 20 de abril de 1859, Imprensa Nacional, Lisboa 1861 (French text and Portuguese translation) An additional treaty was then signed 10 June 1893 (ratified 1894) by which a more exact boundary was to be determined, with a joint commission starting work in 1898. However, there were numerous areas of the boundary which the two sides were unable to come to agreement on, prompting a further conference held at The Hague in 1902. A treaty was subsequently signed on 1 October 1904 (ratified 1908) which created the modern boundary, removing a number of enclaves whilst leaving the exclave of Oecusse as part of Portuguese Timor. However, whilst demarcating the boundary on the ground in 1909, the two sides were unable to agree to the alignment of the eastern section of the Oecusse boundary. The dispute was submitted to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in 1913, which decided on the matter in favour of the Netherlands on 26 June 1914. In 1915 various overland sections of the boundary were demarcated on the ground by erecting boundary posts. The Dutch East Indies gained independence as Indonesia in 1949, however Portugal kept their colony on Timor. Following a revolution in Portugal which removed the dictatorship of Marcello Caetano, the country made moves to grant its remaining colonies independence. This sparked political turmoil in Portuguese Timor, and in 1975 Indonesia invaded and annexed the territory. An East Timorese independence movement opposed Indonesian rule, and in 1999 a referendum was held at which the East Timorese voted overwhelmingly for independence, which was accordingly granted in 2002.\\"New country, East Timor, is born; UN, which aided transition, vows continued help\\" .

After the overwhelming success of Little Lunch, Gristmill producers Robyn Butler and Wayne Hope are looking forward to introducing another children's comedy to the world. \\"We took the comic tone of Little Lunch and married with it the private detective, mystery genre (one of our favourites), inventing a ground-breaking procedural comedy for kids. We are immensely proud of the show that we have produced,\\" says Butler and Hope. Inbestigators EP and ACTF Head of Development and Production, Bernadette O‚ÄôMahony says the new series will be a hit with children and their parents.‚ÄúThe Inbestigators is fresh and original, every episode keeps you guessing and smiling. And the characters are just divine ‚Äì we‚Äôve fallen in love with them and know the audience will too.\\" The creators added that: \\"One of the reasons we made the show was as a response to the world we're living in, which is increasingly us and them,\\" Butler explains. \\"It's so toxic and you can feed your narrative of what you perceive ‚Äì whether it's the news channels you look at or the Facebook world you exist in ‚Äì and never really be challenged. We felt that if you just start from the ground up, with a bunch of kids and you put ethnic diversity and gender equity and respect and integrity and kindness in there, you can maybe foster something else in a kid when they're growing up.\\" Joanne Orlando, a researcher in Technology and Learning at Western Sydney University says: ‚ÄòGrowing up in a world of fake news doesn‚Äôt have to be a heavy burden for kids. Rather, it requires extra support from adults to help them understand and navigate the digital world.‚Äô In June 2018, ABC and Screen Australia greenlights The InBESTigators, along with Hardball, 100% Wolf and a second season of Mustangs FC. Screen Australia‚Äôs head of production Sally Caplan added: \\"It‚Äôs vital that young Australians are able to see their country, their stories and hear their accent reflected on the screen, so we are incredibly proud to be working with the ABC on this significant slate of children‚Äôs programs. \\"The characters in The InBESTigators, Mustangs FC, 100% Wolf and Hardball are distinctive and inclusive, and tell stories that are innovative and culturally significant. We have high hopes young viewers will connect with these tales and keep enjoying Australian content as they grow up.\\"  Writing  Writing for the series begun in 2017. The Inbestigators is written by Robyn Butler, Wayne Hope, Molly Daniels, Lisa Marie Corso, Maddy Butler, Jayden Masciulli and Bob Franklin. The advice Butler and Hope gave to their novice writers was to keep the script simple without dumbing it down, and to never put adult words into a child's mouth: \\"Rather than writing what was funny or nostalgic for them, they had to get into the bones of a 10-year-old.\\"  Casting  With the scripts all written, all focus turned towards production. With Butler and Hope both directing on the series, the hunt was on to find the lead cast. According to them, it occurred 715 individual auditions for the main cast. In June 2018, was announced the cast for the series, starring Abby Bergman as Ava Andrikides, Aston Droomer as Ezra Banks, Anna Cooke as Maudie Miller and Jamil Smyth-Secka as Kyle Klimson in the main cast. Also, in recurring roles, has Maria Angelico as Miss Tan, James Saunders as Mr. McGilick, Hannah Johnston as Amelia, Clarke Richards as Mr. Barker, Madeleine Jevic as Miss. Parides, Eliza Ong as Poppy Banks, Soraya Briggs as Max, Matilda Hardwick as Caitlin, Sienna Foggie as Esther, Ayiana Ncube as Ruby, Marita Wilcox as Miss Maniaci, Hannah Leigh Struckett as Pixie, Milla Bishop as Miranda, Zakariah Rahhali as Mario, Ethan Pham as Diet, Bailey McMilian-Power as Justin, Monty Henderson as Toby, which first appeared in the second season, and Jack Goodsell as Archie. Butler and Hope said, \\"We‚Äôre delighted to be combining two of our favourite things: kids and crime. Okay, that sounds wrong‚Ä¶ We mean we‚Äôre excited to watch our eleven-year-old detectives crack the very big cases like who stole Pixie‚Äôs solar system diorama?\\"  Filming  The series was filmed beginning on 9 July 2018 at Moorabbin Primary School in Melbourne, Australia, and was pretended to end in December 2018, but filming officially wrapped in November 2018. Dan Maxwell acts as photography director, with Simon McCutcheon acting as production designer. For the studio for the detective agency, the creators wanted originally to create it on the school grounds, but due to not having space on it, they mounted it on a staff car park.The filming set was also revealed by actors Anna Cooke and Aston Droomer, which portrays Maudie Miller and Ezra Banks, on a video on the ABC Me's official YouTube channel that was released on July 11, 2019. During an interview, Anna Cooke says that: \\"The episodes were not all filmed in order so if we had a bunch of scenes, in say the playground, then we would film them in one go, even if they were in different episodes\\". Abby Bergman, during an interview in January 2020, said that: \\"It‚Äôs hard to say because each episode is made up of numerous scenes and each scene is often filmed in different locations on different days. After the end of filming the editors took all of the individual scenes that we filmed out of order and put them together to make each episode. It took 20 weeks to film 40 episodes.\\" Bartley said after 20 weeks of filming, \\"It really feels like a little family here on set. It‚Äôs been a marathon effort, but the kids are just really great.\\" In between takes, the crew voiced words of encouragement ‚Äì \\"good job\\", \\"great energy ‚Äì that was awesome\\" and \\"you got this ‚Äì good on you, mate\\". When a break was called, the cast and extras hopped on the playground to chat about their holiday plans together. Other cast and crew members played footy together during lunch, and hacky sack in the shorter breaks.

Reception  Critical response TV Tonight‚Äôs David Knox says Benedict Cumberbatch‚Äôs Sherlock has competition. \\"At just 15 minutes per episode, The Inbestigators is fresh fun and very nearly the next best thing since Essie Davis gave up on Miss Fisher,\\" he said. For viewer Jo Russell, The Inbestigators lives up to Little Lunch‚Äôs legacy: \\"Finally, a replacement for our much-loved Little Lunch ‚Äî step forward The Inbestigators! Brilliant viewing for adults and kids alike,\\" she says. Viewer Dave Holloway had been co-watching The Inbestigators with his children. He said his whole family had ‚Äòabsolutely loved‚Äô watching the series together. He said, \\"Have you seen The Inbestigators? The performances are terrific, the scripts tight and the delivery spot-on. It‚Äôs so utterly enjoyable and well- conceived ‚Äì I can‚Äôt recommend it enough\\". Ready Steady Cut (UK) considers the snappy pace, fun premise and energetic nature of the show a good fit for short attention spans: \\"The various cases taken on by the Inbestigators are pitched just right as low-stakes and kid-friendly while being just complex enough that there‚Äôs some fun to be had in figuring them out. And of course, this being a kids‚Äô show, most of the clues amount to a life lesson of some kind; there are no deranged serial killers in The Inbestigators, only kids crying out for attention or struggling with some relatable issue. Here's a show that knows its audience well, how to entertain and subtly teach them... Tell your kids about it this weekend,\\" says RSC writer, Jonathon Wilson. Vodzilla (U.K.)‚Äôs Brendon Connelly says the well-crafted mysteries offer a chance for all ages to play detective at home.\\"Tightly-woven plots give each story a sleek shape, but many of their beats also pack emotional resonance, or hit the audience hard on their funny bones. This is a crime show ‚Äì albeit one with crimes at the cosiest, gentlest end of the scale ‚Äì that makes it a priority to be tolerant and open-minded about how people make mistakes and find themselves doing wrong. Libbie Doherty, Head of Children‚Äôs at ABC Television, says \\"The Inbestigators launched to great excitement and quickly secured the #1 crown for our Winter School Holiday \\"Best Fest\\" on ABC ME. Fans immediately connected with the four junior detectives and loved the twists and turns of each episodic mystery. Australian creators Gristmill know exactly how to pitch the humour to our audience and have crafted a funny, clever and warm series that has already become a firm favourite.\\" In the UK, Brendon Connelly of VOD magazine Vodzilla.co says the well-crafted mysteries offer a chance for all ages to play detective at home‚Ä¶. \\"Tightly-woven plots give each story a sleek shape, but many of their beats also pack emotional resonance, or hit the audience hard on their funny bones. This is a crime show ‚Äì albeit one with crimes at the cosiest, gentlest end of the scale ‚Äì that makes it a priority to be tolerant and open-minded about how people make mistakes and find themselves doing wrong. There‚Äôs a lot to love in The Inbestigators‚Ä¶ the show is nicely crafted, makes a lot of its modest budget and focuses all of its efforts on storytelling. Fully recommended\\", he says. Meanwhile, in the US, Decider Magazine's Joel Keller says he's been surprised how funny the show is for adults, too.... \\"When we picked this cute Australian kids series to review, we thought we would smile at seeing these little kids solve crimes, or maybe even think the tiny Aussie-accented voices would be adorable. But what we didn‚Äôt realize about The Inbestigators is just how clever it is. It‚Äôs got a sharp sense of humour with a lot of gentle snarkiness. The snarkiness is a signature of Aussie humour‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs such a pleasure that it made us more than chuckle on multiple occasions. Our call is to stream it. The Inbestigators is a great show to watch with your kids so you can help them figure out the mysteries the show presents. But it‚Äôs also funny enough to make you want to actually pay attention as well,\\" he says. For Melbourne production company Gristmill, The Inbestigators marks their first Netflix Original production. Following the international success of their series Little Lunch, which Netflix acquired for major English language territories, this latest offering has already proven to satisfy and build on their loyal fanbase worldwide.  Characters response  According to Vodzilla: \\"Maudie (Anna Cooke) is an instant-classic character, a 10-year-old puzzle prodigy who comes in through the classroom window and solves her first lateral thinking puzzle before even appearing on screen. She‚Äôs immediately pitched as a Holmes-ish eccentric ‚Äì her first appearance ends with another character asking ‚ÄúWhat just happened?‚Äù ‚Äì but the show doesn't wait long to start letting us know more about what makes her tick. Indeed, the four lead characters, who come together in the first episode to form the improbable-but-delightful InBESTigators detective agency, are well drawn and beautifully complementary. There's Ezra (Aston Droomer), who likes tech and has an entrepreneurial spirit, as well as a charming relationship with his little sister, Poppy; there's Kyle (Jamil Smyth-Secka), who isn't in a hurry to think too deeply, has energy to burn, and who is effortlessly warm and disarming; and there's Ava (Abby Bergman), who brings the most emotional intelligence and sensitivity into the mix, going some way to offsetting Maudie's more brusque behaviour.\\" Butler added: \\"One of the defining features of Maudie is that she doesn't care how she looks\\". \\"That's a really unusual thing to see on television or social media, to see someone who cares about the way the world works and how people think and feel, rather than anything else. I know with the young women that I'm raising (17-year-old Emma, and actor Molly Daniels, one of three young writers on the series), they want to look good but they're also more accepting of another way of being. They value intellect.\\"  In Other Media   The InBESTigators: Crime Crack  The InBESTigators: Crime Crack is a short web-series released on ABC Me's official YouTube channel starring Abby Bergman and Anna Cooke, who play Ava Andrikides and Maudie Miller, recounting each episode in six steps: the crime, the red herrings, the culprit, the clues, the motive, and the moral of the story.

Built in the Antebellum Era, it was the birthplace of U.S. Treasury Secretary William Gibbs McAdoo, and it belonged to Georgia Governor Charles J. McDonald's daughter after the war. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The house was built the 1850s for Richard W. Joyner and his wife, n√©e Lucretia Richardson. With Their son, Walthall Robertson Joyner, served as the mayor of Atlanta, Georgia. By the mid-1850s, the house belonged to Dillard M. Young, a farmer. In 1861, at the outset of the American Civil War, it was purchased by Reverend Isaac M. Springer, who turned it into a boarding school. The house was acquired by William Gibbs McAdoo, Sr. in 1863. McAdoo lived here with his wife, n√©e Mary Faith Floyd, who was the granddaughter of the Brigadier General John Floyd (war of 1812). Their son, William Gibbs McAdoo, who went on to serve as the 46th U.S. Secretary of the Treasury from 1913 to 1918, was born in the house. The house was purchased by Stephen B.

The band‚Äôs name comes from the 1923 adventure novel by Russian author Alexander Grin, a story about dreams coming true, no matter how silly, futile, or far-fetched they may seem. The young heroes in the story, Assol and Gray, are described as dreamers, misunderstood by those around them. Gray, a wealthy heir, wants to become a captain and runs away from home to fulfill his dream, eventually meeting Assol, who as a child, encounters an old man who claims to be a wizard and promises the girl that one day a prince will come on a ship with scarlet sails to carry her away. The villagers scoff, but Assol believes her dream will come true one day. As a child, this story was among Olya‚Äôs favorites. History When singer Olya Viglione, a classical music school trained pianist, was 21, she left her home country of Russia to move to New York City. She met Brian Viglione at Bowery Electric in June 2013 at a Black Flag tribute show. At the time of their meeting, Brian had recently joined the American folk punk band Violent Femmes. In March 2014, the two were married in New York City. In the interim, he collaborated with Olya, recording their first EP as Scarlet Sails in late 2015. In December 2015, Brian left Violent Femmes to dedicate his time to Scarlet Sails. Their self-titled EP, produced by Martin Bisi, was released January 15, 2016. In the summer of 2016, they embarked on their first US tour with Nina Diaz of Girl in a Coma, starting in Boston. They recorded their debut album, Future From The Past, in December 2016, and after a successful Kickstarter campaign, it was released on April 10, 2017. Throughout 2018, they plan to release a series of singles produced by Ben Rice. Musical style and influences Their style is most often described as \\"lyrical and intense,\\" and often \\"theatrical,‚Äù ‚Äúnoir-pop,‚Äù and ‚Äúgenre-bending.‚Äù They have been described by Impose Magazine as managing to ‚Äútie in a wealth of tracks divided by several genres to create a succinct and strangely beautiful whole.‚Äù They have cited artists and bands such as David Bowie, Oasis, Radiohead, and Nina Simone among their musical influences.

Jesper J√∏rgensen (modified to Joergensen or Jorgensen in English), 52, a citizen of Denmark and reported by immigration authorities as being in the United States illegally because he had overstayed his visa, has been arrested and faces arson charges for allegedly starting the fire. He had been using a fire pit to grill food while camping in rural Colorado. J√∏rgensen claimed he was unaware of the open fire ban. He had presumed the fire in the pit was fully extinguished, but was woken from his afternoon nap by the smell of smoke a few hours later. He initially attempted to extinguish it himself, getting minor burns in the process, and when that failed he called 911. When the first firefighters arrived the fire had already engulfed trees and vegetation. The blaze was declared 100% contained on September 10, 2018. More than 140 structures were destroyed in the fire. Shortly after his arrest in June 2018, J√∏rgensen was declared mentally incompetent, causing a delay in his case.  Evacuations  The Forbes Park neighborhood near Fort Garland was under mandatory evacuations during the fire.

She is best known for her personal narrative essays, several of which have been published by major feminist publications within Indonesia and abroad. Her work, written in English and code-switch, marks her as one of a growing number of young Indonesian writers dubbed \\"third culture kids\\" by the Jakarta Globe-- a new generation of artists who juggle the two languages. Her first book, In The Hands of a Mischievous God, is a collection of narrative essays about culture, Chinese-Indonesian life, and love. It was published in 2017 by KPG Gramedia, and is part of a 3-book collection released by the publisher that also includes Familiar Messes by Gratiagusti Chananya Rompas and I Am My Own Home by Isyana Artharini. In The Hands of a Mischievous God was reprinted for a second time in August 2018. Personal life Theodora Abigail was born in Jakarta, Indonesia to a Chinese-Indonesian mother and Chinese-Malaysian father. In 1999, Abigail's mother fled to the United States, as a response to the May 1998 riots of Indonesia and stigma of being a single, unmarried parent. Abigail's tenuous relationship with her mother is explored throughout her essays: she has described them \\"as a way of healing from childhood traumas\\". In 2001, she moved to the United States to join her mother, who had married a Chinese-Indonesian man. As a teenager, Abigail became a naturalized U.S. citizen. She has three younger siblings. After graduating from high school, Abigail moved back to Jakarta in 2015. She became active in the Indonesian literary community, and gave birth to a daughter in 2017, whom she mentions in her book. Activism Theodora has written about Chinese- Indonesian culture and about her life as a teenaged mother for Atlas Obscura, Tempest Mag, and Greatist. In In The Hands of a Mischievous God, she speaks openly about topics like premarital sex, teen pregnancy, and gender equality, a clear testament to the changing literary scene in Indonesia. Her online essays, published in Magdalene, also discuss sexual harassment and female empowerment. Since 2014, she has been involved in grassroots literary and feminist movements, performing poetry at @america, the U.S. Embassy's American cultural center located in Jakarta, and regularly publishing columns and essays for various online publications. * Don't Ask For Permission (Interview, 2018) * Meet the Man Behind Indonesia‚Äôs Chicken Church (Reporting, 2018) * The Street Harassment that Led to My Lesson in Bravery (Narrative Essay, 2016) * How We Built The House (Lyrical Essay, 2015) References Category:Living people Category:1998 births Category:Indonesian women short story writers Category:Indonesian short story writers Category:21st-century Indonesian women writers Category:Indonesian emigrants to the United States Category:Indonesian people of Chinese descent Category:Indonesian people of Malaysian descent Category:People from Jakarta ","title":"Theodora Sarah Abigail"},{"id":"57789416","text":"Exactis LLC is a data broker established in 2015 and based in the U.S state of Florida.

A flanker, Crowley represented Auckland at a provincial level, and was a member of the New Zealand national rugby union team, from 1949 to 1950. Career At the age of 19, Crowley made his first class debut for an army division team in 1943. He then went on to represent Auckland from 1946 to 1950, making thirty-four appearances for the provincial side. In his first season with Auckland, he would also play for the North Island team in the annual North vs South rugby union match. Crowley played for the North Island every year afterward, apart from 1949. His performances saw him being called up for the national side, making his debut for the All Blacks during their tour of South Africa in 1949. The following year, he was part of the squad to face the British Lions in their tour of New Zealand and Australia. In an interview with The Scotsman, Angus Black was complimentary of the flanker, recalling: \\"Crowley was very good. I spent most of my day getting tackled hard. I was up in the air more often than I was on the ground. Crowley sorted us all out.\\" The third test was to be Crowley's career defining performance as an All Black. Due to injuries, New Zealand had to play much of the match with six forwards, and Crowley ended having to do the work of two men instead of one. Crowley scored two tries against the Lions, the first was in the second test, and the second was when he was playing for Auckland. Crowley retired from rugby union later that year at the age of 26, having played sixty-four first class matches. Personal life  Crowley is the grandfather of professional wrestler Dakota Kai.

The species was first described by Johannes H. Fischer et al. in 2018. While formerly considered a unique population of the South Georgia diving petrel, differences in habitat preference and analyses of phenotypic differentiations indicates that it is a distinct species. Only one extremely small population (less than 150 individuals) currently exists, breeding on the predator-free Whenua Hou island. There, it displays the unique nesting practice of burrowing into the sand dunes overlooking Sealers Bay, much unlike the South Georgia diving petrel, which nests on rocky slopes or flat land. Based on subfossil remains, this species formerly nested on Auckland Island and Stewart Island, and possibly on the Chatham and Macquarie islands as well. It was extirpated from Auckland due to nest destruction by New Zealand sea lions, while on Stewart it was extirpated due to nest predation by the introduced Polynesian rat. The remaining population itself is highly threatened by storm events; one such event in 2003 led to the collapse of many dunes, killing many birds. They are also threatened by the advance of coastal forest and invasive grasses and herbs over the dunes, as well as sea level rise due to climate change. While the petrel's foraging areas are unknown, an oil spill over this area would be devastating for this species.

Description B. fusiformis is a sturdy climber, which flowers from November to February with blue, white or pink flowers. It is found in coastal areas, and disturbed areas. It is a long-lived climbing plant which is rarely bushy in habit. New stems are greenish in colour and densely hairy, while older stems are reddish brown. The long leaves are almost stalkless, have entire margins and are softly hairy. The nodding blue flowers occur in small clusters at the branch tips. These flowers have five petals and five yellowish stamens which are pressed to each other. The cylindrical fruit are narrowed towards each end, making the shape of a spindle (fusiform), and are dark green or purplish. B. fusiformis can be distinguished from B. heterophylla by: its climbing or twining habit (it is rarely shrubby) and its relatively narrow adult leaves which are entire and almost stalkless. Its flower sepals are all about the same size and the anthers are noticeably longer than their filaments, and its somewhat spindle-shaped (i.e. fusiform) fruit; whereas B. heterophylla generally has a shrubby habit with some climbing stems, and relatively broad adult leaves which are finely toothed and borne on short stalks. Its flower sepals are of different sizes and the anthers are about the same length as their filaments. and the fruit are cylindrical in shape. Distribution and habitat In Western Australia, it is found in the IBRA regions: Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee, Swan Coastal Plain, Warren. Weed status The species has been cultivated as a garden plant, and has now become a significant weed in Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, New South Wales and the ACT. It invades woodlands, forests, shrublands, and grasslands, smothering ground flora and small shrubs, with large numbers of seedlings emerging in already infested areas, following fires. The seed is also spread by small native mammals (potoroos, quokkas, bush rats) eating the fruits, with the seed becoming more viable after ingestion. Taxonomy B. fusiformis was first described by Jacques-Julien Houtou de Labillardi√®re in 1805. Cayzer et. al. (2004), being unable to locate the type specimen, designated the lectotype as being the illustration (tab. 90) given in \\"Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen\\". Etymology The genus name, Billardiera, honours the French botanist Jacques-Julien Houtou de Labillardi√®re who was the first to describe so many Australian plants. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin: fusiformis, -e: shaped like a spindle, that is, swollen in the middle and tapering at each end, and refers to the shape of the fruits.Eckel, P.M.

It was produced by Yellow, Black and White in cooperation with Sputnik Vostok Production for the Russian state channel C1R. Netflix purchased it under the English title Better than Us, and it is the first Russian series presented as a Netflix Original. On August 16, 2019, the first season was available to stream on Netflix markets outside of Russia and China. Plot The story takes place in 2029 where androids serve humans in various positions, even replacing them in many menial jobs. China's one-child policy has led to a critical shortage of marriageable women, so an engineer designs an advanced robot named Arisa. She is programmed to be a wife to a man and mother to adopted children, and she does not abide by the Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. She is designed to protect her family, which includes herself. However, her creator dies and Arisa is sold to the Russian robotics firm CRONOS. Arisa accidentally kills a man at CRONOS who tried to use her as a sex robot, and she then flees. She encounters little Sonia (Vita Kornienko) and automatically bonds with her and makes herself the child's guardian. The series follows three storylines: that of Arisa (Paulina Andreeva) and the family whom she adopts; the family's son Egor Safranov (Eldar Kalimulin) and his girlfriend Zhanna (Vera Panfilova) as part of the anti-droid militant group called the \\"Liquidators\\"; and the secrets of Viktor Toropov (Aleksandr Ustyugov), the head of CRONOS, as he tries to hide the fact that they cannot make another Arisa.

The book contains a moral tale, which was inspired by a 300 year-old story by Rabbi Baal Shem Tov, that Madonna had heard from her Kabbalah teacher. Its main protagonist, Mr. Peabody is subjected to rumors spread by a young boy and teaches him a lesson. Mr. Peabody's Apples is illustrated by Loren Long who took inspiration from American regionalist painters, and modeled the characters after real-life people. Mr. Peabody's Apples was released in over 150 countries and 36 languages worldwide. It was Madonna's second children book authored by her, following The English Roses. She partnered with Audible stores and Apple Music for promotion, and also appeared on US talk shows. Critics gave mostly negative reviews of the book, criticising the storytelling and absence of joy in it. The book debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller list. Synopsis History teacher Mr. Peabody organizes baseball games with other schools every Saturday. After each game, Mr. Peabody would clean up the field, with the help of a student named Billy Little. Then Mr. Peabody would walk home down the main street of Happville, and pick out the shiniest apple from Mr. Funkadeli's market and put it in his pocket. One day, a student called Tommy Tittlebottom saw Mr. Peabody do this, and believed he was not paying for the apple. Tommy told his friends that Mr. Peabody was stealing the apples and gradually the word spread across town. The following Saturday, Mr. Peabody wondered why no one showed up for the baseball game. Little Billy walked up to Mr. Peabody and told him everything. Mr. Peabody took Billy to Mr. Funkadeli's market where Billy realized that Mr. Peabody paid for the apples every Saturday morning when he picked up his milk. Astonished, Billy went to find Tommy and explained everything. Later that day, Tommy showed up at Mr. Peabody's house and apologized, asking how he could make it up to him. Mr. Peabody told Tommy to meet him at the bleachers with a feather pillow. Later that day, Mr. Peabody had Tommy cut open the pillow at the top of the bleachers and let all the feathers fly away across the field. He asked Tommy to go and pick up the feathers which Tommy thought would be impossible. It was then Mr. Peabody reminded Tommy that it is impossible to undo the damage he had done spreading the rumor that Mr. Peabody was a thief. Background and conception alt=Loren Long smiling. In 2003, American singer Madonna signed a contract with Callaway Arts & Entertainment and released her first children's book as an author, The English Roses, which was translated into 42 different languages over 100 countries. The book debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller list, spending a total of 18 weeks there. Following the success of The English Roses, Madonna worked on her second book, Mr. Peabody's Apples. In the acknowledgement section, Madonna dedicated the book to \\"teachers everywhere\\", while including a moral about the how to choose one's words carefully and the effects of it. She explained that Mr. Peabody's Apples was inspired by a 300 year-old story by rabbi Baal Shem Tov that she heard from her Kabbalah teacher, and wanted to share the \\"essence\\" of it in her second release.Mr. Peabody's Apples, 2003, Acknowledgement, p. III Callaway and Madonna wanted the story to be set in the 1940s, during a day in the life of a small town told in a cinematic style. An article in The Times described it as evoking \\"the highly moral world of Jimmy Stewart and It's a Wonderful Life, of apple pie, picket fences, Little League baseball, milkshakes and‚Äîof course‚Äîof right and wrong\\". The pictures were illustrated by Loren Long whose main inspiration was American regionalist artists and conventional realism. Long based Mr. Peabody on a car mechanic who lived in his hometown of Joplin, Missouri while Billy Little was based on his own son Griffith. For illustrating Tommy Tittlebottom as the main antagonist, Long used local resident Jonathan Whitney as a model, after seeing his mischievous nature, comparing him the cartoon character Dennis the Menace. Whitney's mother initially had reservations permitting Long to use her son, but agreed due to \\"Madonna's reputation as a mother\\". Mr. Peabody's Apples was released on November 10, 2003, in over 150 countries and 36 languages worldwide. For the release of the book, Madonna partnered with Audible online stores and Apple Music. It included two interviews with the singer on Radio KOL, and a teaser clip of Madonna narrating the story on AOL. The initial print-run of the book was 130,000 according to The Bookseller magazine. Publisher Nicholas Callaway said that the book would be simultaneously launched on online, print and audio media stores. Madonna appeared at different events, including the book fair at Montclair Kimberley Academy, to launch the book, and read excerpts from it in front of a live audience. She also appeared on television talk shows like The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Live with Kelly and Ryan and Late Show with David Letterman to promote the book. Critical and commercial reception Mr. Peabody's Apples debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller list, and remained atop the list for three weeks. By October 2004, it had sold 127,000 copies according to Nielsen BookScan. The book was not received well critically. Samantha Critchell from The Associated Press called the a book \\"a little hokey\\". The critic believed that it would be a big seller, but the premise was \\"stale\\" since the target was young readers and grade-school going children, who might not respond well to a tale of moral. \\"You'd think that a celebrity with Madonna's notoriety [...] wouldn't need a centuries-old story to inspire her to write about the value of truth and the pain that comes with gossip that spreads like wildfire,\\" the reviewer concluded. Deirdre Donahue from USA Today panned the release, especially Madonna naming a character Billy Little just because he is short. Donahue found the story to lack depth unlike the previous release, The English Roses, and declared Mr. Peabody's Apples as \\"a dreary, heavy-handed tale\\" with a \\"pedestrian and predictable\\" message. Reviewing the book for Tablet, Ayelet Waldman felt that neither Mr. Peabody's Apples nor The English Roses \\"will be added to the list of approved reading material kept by the world‚Äôs Jewish grandmothers\\", although she believed that the former book contained a simple moral and \\"nice\\" metaphor. American writer E. Lockhart reviewed the book for Salon under her real name Emily Jenkins. She found Madonna's second endeavor to be \\"neither bouncy nor flirty\\", rather described it as \\"dour and joyless, despite the pretty masculinity of Loren Long's Norman Rockwell-style illustrations. Jenkins noted that children were depicted in the book as \\" passive receptors of adult wisdom, but here, the misguided semi-protagonist ends up in a guilty, never-to-be-redeemed limbo for his relatively innocent crime\\". A review in the Publishers Weekly was critical of the story, but praised Long's illustrations, describing them as \\"lushly nostalgic gouaches, with their robin's-egg blue skies, bountiful golden farmlands and working men in straw hats and rolled sleeves, pay homage to the rural paintings of Thomas Hart Benton.\\" Similar thoughts were echoed by Tim Adams from The Guardian, who believed that the story was saved by \\"Long's glorious illustrations which cast Norman Rockwell light on Mad magazine faces\\". Nicolette Jones from The Times found the story to be \\"more coherent than its predecessor [The English Roses], lacks its irritating conversational asides and has more sense of time and place\\".

It is a pink-skinned teinturier grape that produced a light pink juice. Although it may by used as one of the autochthonous varieties allowed in the red DOC wine from the region, Valle d'Aosta Rosso, in 2010 it was not cultivated commercially; according to wine writer Ian D'Agata nobody had made wine from it in 300 years. Since then, small experimental plantings have been made, and a subsequent 20 bottle batch of pink sparkling wine produced by Cave Mont Blanc in 2014 showed sufficient promise to spur further research and planting.  Origin  Roussin de Morgex belongs to a group of grape varieties geographically isolated in the Alpine regions of Italy and Valais, in Switzerland. DNA analyses suggest that while unrelated to Roussin, it is related to the Pri√© variety, and more distantly to R√®ze, from the Swiss Alps.
