It is a green frog with distinctly orange eyes, and is very similar in appearance to the red-eyed tree frog. Description Tadpole of the orange-thighed frog The orange- thighed frog is a medium-sized tree frog, reaching a length of 5.5 cm. It is a slender frog, with a thin body, flat head, and large eyes, which are orange in colour. It has a green dorsal surface, with bright yellow feetand vocal sac, and a yellow band down its flank. The inner surfaces of its legs are yellow, and the outer surfaces are green. It is distinguished, physically, from the red-eyed tree frog by the presence of bright-orange thighs; the red-eyed tree frog has mauve thighs. Ecology and behaviour Male orange-thighed frogs congregate around still ponds, and call from low branches, or the edges of the water. The call is a long \\"aaa-rk\\", followed by a soft trill. They call after heavy monsoon rains. The males call in a large chorus; amplexus occurs where the frog calls, and the male and female move to the laying site. The eggs are brown, and are in masses of 800 to 1600. The tadpoles are identical in appearance to those of the red-eyed tree frog. The orange-thighed frog inhabits dense rainforest.

He is the 1993 Skate Canada International bronze medalist and an eight-time British national champion. He finished as high as 6th at the Olympics (1998), 7th at the World Championships (1998), and 4th at the European Championships (1996).  Career  Cousins began skating in 1978 after he and his brother pushed their parents to take them to an ice rink. Although he had a negative reaction at first (\\"We ended up going to the rink, and I hated it\\"), he eventually grew interested in figuring out how to jump and spin. He was also spurred on by sibling rivalry with his elder brother. Cousins is the youngest skater to win the British National Championships. He trained with Donna Gately at Deeside Ice Rink in the United Kingdom and then moved to the United States where he spent a number of years. In 1993, he moved to Canada and was coached by Doug Leigh at the Mariposa School of Skating in Barrie, Ontario. He also worked with Stephen Pickavance and Karen Barber in the UK. Cousins competed at three Winter Olympics, nine World Championships, and nine European Championships during his career. He became the first Briton to land a triple Axel in competition at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. He was the British national champion for seven consecutive years before his streak was interrupted by Neil Wilson in the 1996‚Äì97 season. Cousins finished higher at the 1997 European Championships and was sent to the 1997 World Championships. Cousins reclaimed his national title in the 1997‚Äì98 season. After finishing ninth at the 1997 Nations Cup, he withdrew from the 1997 Troph√©e Lalique. He placed sixth at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. He was coached by Doug Leigh and Robert Tebby. Cousins retired from eligible competition in 1998 but continued to skate in shows, including touring with Stars on Ice until 2007. He has worked as a choreographer. In May 2010, he joined the International Skating School at Planet Ice, Coventry, and Silver Blades, Altrincham. He was the event manager for the 2012‚Äì13 Disson skating shows.  Personal life  Cousins was born on 24 May 1972 in Chester, England. He married Canadian ice dancer Kristina Lenko in June 2003. They formally separated in the summer of 2006 and subsequently divorced. With former wife Elena Berezhnaya, he has two children, a son Trystan, born on 6 October 2007, and daughter Sofia Diana, born on 21 June 2009. The couple's separation was confirmed in August 2013. Cousins has a home in Chester but lives more than half the year in Ontario, Canada.  Programmes  {class= style=text-align:center ! Season ! Short programme !

Despite its name, CRL also governed rugby league in the Australian Capital Territory. Apart from selecting a Country Origin side to play in the annual City vs Country Origin game, the CRL administered many senior and junior competitions across the state. History Country Rugby League logo used before 2013 Newcastle was the first city outside Sydney to start a league competition, being involved in the Sydney Premiership in 1908-09 and then starting their own competition in 1910. On 11 February 1911, the Hunter District Rugby Football League (HDRFL) was established at a large meeting in Maitland, thus becoming the first branch of the NSW Rugby League in \\"the bush\\" (i.e. outside the urban centres of Sydney and Newcastle). The HDRFL territory encompassed a lower part of the Hunter Valley from Singleton down to the Maitland district and towns on the nearby coalfields (the major ones being Cessnock, Kurri Kurri and Weston). Competition games were scheduled to kick off on 13 May but were pushed back to 20 May when clubs complained they had not had enough time to practice the new code. In the first senior-grade games played, West Maitland def. Kurri Kurri (12-0) and Cessnock def. Morpeth (23-0) in a double-header on the enclosed Albion Ground at Maitland. The first City v. Country match (advertised as such by the NSWRL in the Sydney Morning Herald of 10/6/1911) was played at the Sydney Agricultural Ground on that same Saturday, with City winning 29-8. The Country team was composed exclusively of players from the Newcastle (\\"Northern\\") and the Hunter competitions. The first ever country divisional match (described as such in the Maitland Daily Mercury of 31/7/1911) was played at Newcastle on 29/7/1911 between Newcastle and Hunter. Newcastle won 29-14. The first NSW Country team to tour was a squad of 17 players (12 from Newcastle and 5 from Hunter) that played three matches in Queensland between 5/8/1911 and 12/8/1911, defeating the Queensland State side twice and a Queensland Country representative side once. They then travelled to Sydney to play the Sydney Metropolitan team, again winning 31-24.Cessnock Rugby League Football - The Early Years; Mark Bennis; 2011 On 13 May 1911, another branch of the NSWRL was established in the Wollongong area. In 1911, a Goldfields' League was formed in West Wyalong, and games were played in Tamworth, Aberdeen, and along the South Coast. The game was introduced to Orange in 1912 and spread quickly through the western districts. In 1913 branch leagues were formed at Bathurst, Dubbo, Nowra, and Tamworth. In 1920, the NSWRL set up a Country Committee. NSW Country was divided into six sections: South Coast, Northern Districts, Central Northern Districts, Western Districts, Southern, and North Coast. The group system was introduced in 1922, with neighbouring towns being organised into 12 groups. The Country Rugby League (CRL) was officially formed in 1934, \\"subject to the NSW Rugby League still being the paramount institution.\\" In 1939 a dispute arose between the CRL and the NSWRL. The CRL wanted a new administration structure, an equal partnership in which the NSWRL looked after league in Sydney, and the CRL looked after it in the bush. When their proposal was rejected the CRL broke away from the NSWRL for a week, but returned to the fold with a promise that a committee would be set up to sort things out. Eventually the CRL gave in on the grounds that it was in no one's best interests to have the game divided during the war. The NSWRL and CRL have since cooperated in the running of Rugby league in NSW, including various 'joint ventures' such as the Ron Massey Cup which features three teams from areas under the control of the CRL. On 24 August 2018, the NSWRL and CRL announced that they had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which will involve formal discussions in relation to a possible merger that would see a merger of the two organisations. This would result with Rugby League in NSW governed by one body for the first time in more than 80 years. In October 2019 merged with the NSWRL after the NSWRL agreed a new constitution and the CRL voted to wind up its affairs immediately. The decisions made on 19 October and merger mean that the aim of a unified administration of the sport in NSW was achieved over a year ahead of time.

Career Hughes played for the Ballymena United academy, before transferring to the academy at hometown club Larne. He went on to make his Irish League debut for The Harbour Rats, before moving to The Football League in England to join Lincoln City in League Two. He was originally deployed in the left-back position for Larne, however under John Schofield at Lincoln, he has proven that he is equally adept at playing a more attacking role as a wing-back and a winger on the left side. Despite Hughes' three goals over two legs against Bristol Rovers, Lincoln experienced their fourth-successive play-off defeat in 2007, and Hughes moved to Crystal Palace of The Championship, reaching his highest level yet. However, he struggled at Selhurst Park. He went on a two-month loan to Peterborough United in November 2007, scoring once against Bradford City. In the January transfer window, Peterborough tried to agree terms with Hughes to sign him, but failed to do so, and thus he returned to Palace. At the end of March, Bristol Rovers signed Hughes on a loan deal until the end of the season, but he was injured on his reserve team debut, after giving Rovers the lead. He returned to Palace for treatment, before signing permanently for Rovers in the summer. On 30 April 2010 he was called to the Northern Ireland B national football team for a friendly against Scotland B national football team on 6 May 2010. On 18 September 2010 Hughes scored his first professional hat-trick away to Dagenham and Redbridge, a game which Rovers won 3‚Äì0. He was one of seventeen players released by the team in May 2011. On 28 June 2011, Hughes signed for League One side Notts County on a two-year deal. He scored on his league debut against Carlisle United on 6 August 2011. On 22 May 2013, Hughes signed for Fleetwood Town. On 14 July 2015, Hughes signed a two-year contract with Cambridge United.

The side is organised by the Hellenic Cricket Federation, which became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1995 and an associate member in 2017. Greece is often referred to as Hellas in cricket contexts. Greece made its international debut at the 1990 European Cricketer Cup in Guernsey, and has participated regularly in European Cricket Council tournaments since then.Other matches played by Greece ‚Äì CricketArchive. Retrieved 8 October 2015. Cricket in the country is played mainly on the island of Corfu. This strong cricket tradition is due to the 50 years British rule of the Ionian islands at the time of the liberation of Greece from the Ottoman Empire. Efforts are currently underway to expand the game further outside Corfu. History The Greek cricket team appeared in every edition of the ECC Trophy from 1999 to 2005, hosting and winning the tournament in 1999. This enabled them to play in Division Two of the European Championship in 2000, finishing in sixth place. They once again played in the tournament in 2006, but this time they met with controversy. After winning all three of their first round group games, they looked to be a favourite for the tournament, and promotion to Division One. However, it was revealed that they had fielded two ineligible players and their wins were cancelled. Then they opted not to travel to RAF Lossiemouth to play Israel in the eighth place play-off, despite being fully aware that this would forfeit that game, and relegate them. In September 2009 Greece took part in the 2009 European Cricket Championship Division Five in Corfu, Greece. The national team won the event with five wins out the five games . 2018-Present In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Greece and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I. Greece played their first T20I on 15 October 2019, against Serbia, during the 2019 Hellenic Premier League.

Information about songs on this album  * \\"Fodder In Her Wings\\" and \\"I Sing Just To Know That I'm Alive\\", Nina first recorded these self-written songs on Fodder On My Wings (1982). Both are very personal to her, talking about Nina's estrangement from people and closing a bad chapter and beginning a new one. *\\"Be My Husband\\", written by her ex-husband and ex-manager Andrew Stroud, first featured on Pastel Blues (1965). Later covered by Jeff Buckley as \\"Be Your Husband\\". *\\"I Loves You Porgy\\", her first hit-single from her debut Little Girl Blue (1958). *\\"Mississippi Goddam\\", Nina wrote this civil rights song after four black girls died during a church bombing, first featured on Nina Simone In Concert (1964). *\\"Moon over Alabama\\", together with \\"Mississippi Goddam\\". Nina sings this song to show that the two songs have a similar melody. She, therefore, switches between them during the performance. *\\"My Baby Just Cares For Me\\", Nina introduces this last song with: > I think this is what you've all been waiting for...

Dunn (March 27, 1953 ‚Äì December 4, 2011) was the non-executive chairman of the board of Hewlett-Packard (HP) from February 2005 until September 22, 2006, when she resigned her position. On October 4, 2006, Bill Lockyer, the California attorney general, charged Dunn with four felonies for her role in the HP spying scandal. Some members of the press reported that Dunn had been scapegoated. On March 14, 2007, California Superior Court Judge Ray Cunningham dismissed the charges against her. Early life Born in Burbank, California, Dunn grew up in Las Vegas, Nevada, where both of her parents were involved in the casino industry. Her father was the entertainment manager for the Dunes and Tropicana hotel-casinos, and her mother was a model and entertainer. When Dunn was only eleven, her father died. Her mother subsequently moved the family to California.Stewart, J., \\"The Kona Files\\", New Yorker, February 19 & 26, 2007, p. 154. Education After graduating from Terra Linda High School in 1970, Dunn entered the University of Oregon, but dropped out to support her mother by working as a housecleaner. She resumed college and graduated from UC Berkeley in 1975 with a B.A. in Journalism. Career After college, Dunn began working as a temporary secretary at Wells Fargo & Co. She eventually became CEO at Barclays Global Investors, the company that acquired the asset management division of Wells Fargo. In 1998 she joined the HP Board of Directors. In 2001, the Financial Women of San Francisco named Dunn the \\"Financial Woman of the Year\\". Dunn became non- executive chair of the HP board in February 2005 when Carly Fiorina, the CEO and chair of the HP board, left the company. Dunn was also non-executive Vice Chairman of Barclays Global Investors from 2002 to October 2006. Additionally, she was Director and Executive Committee member of Larkin Street Youth Services in San Francisco, on the board of the Conference Board's Global Corporate Governance Research Center, and an advisory board member of UC Berkeley Haas School of Business.HP Board members biographies HP Internal Spying Scandal Dunn was at the center of the 2006 HP Spying Scandal because she directed investigations of board-level leaks of information to reporters in 2005-2006. HP hired companies which, while investigating the leaks, obtained the personal telephone records of HP board members and reporters who covered HP through a practice called pretexting. It is illegal under California law to use deceit and trickery to obtain private records of individuals. On September 12, 2006, HP announced that Mark Hurd, the company's CEO, would replace Dunn as Chairman after the HP board meeting on January 18, 2007, but that Dunn would continue as an HP board member. But on September 22, 2006, Dunn resigned, effective immediately, from both her position as chairman and from the board of directors of HP. In an official statement, Dunn noted \\"I accepted the responsibility to identify the sources of those leaks, but I did not propose the specific methods of the investigation ... Unfortunately, the people HP relied upon to conduct this type of investigation let me and the company down. I continue to have the best interests of HP at heart and thus I have accepted the board‚Äôs request to resign.\\" On October 4, 2006, Dunn and four others were charged by California attorney general Bill Lockyer with four felony counts: fraudulent use of wire, radio or television transmissions; taking, copying, and using computer data without authorization; identity theft; and conspiracy. Lockyer issued arrest warrants for all five of those so charged. Dunn was scheduled to have been arraigned on November 17, 2006. On March 14, 2007, the judge in the case dropped all criminal charges against her in the \\"interests of justice\\". The dropping of the criminal charges by Judge Cunningham came after Dunn refused to take a plea of one misdemeanor in exchange for four felonies before the preliminary hearing.  Personal life  Dunn married William Jahnke, a former head of Wells Fargo Investment Advisors. The couple owned a winery in Australia, a home in Hawaii, and a home in Orinda, California. Dunn survived breast cancer and melanoma, but was diagnosed with advanced (Stage IV) ovarian cancer in January 2004. Chemotherapy treatment led to remission until August 2006, when she underwent surgery to remove liver metastases.On December 4, 2011, Dunn died from ovarian cancer at her home in Orinda, age 58. Dunn was survived by her husband, three adult children, ten grandchildren, a brother, and a sister.(bad link)(subscription required for full article) References External links *2006 Separate videos of Fiorina and Dunn after HP pretexting scandal 2006-10-08 Category:1953 births Category:2011 deaths Category:American computer businesspeople Category:Deaths from cancer in California Category:Deaths from ovarian cancer Category:Hewlett-Packard people Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:American chairmen of corporations Category:American women in business Category:Businesspeople from the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Women corporate directors Category:Businesspeople from Las Vegas Category:Wells Fargo employees Category:BlackRock people Category:People from Burbank, California Category:Technology corporate directors Category:People from Orinda, California ","title":"Patricia C.

It was first published in 1994. Plot America has won the Cold War, but continues to face new dangers from terrorists. After Admiral Hardcastle warns the world about America's lack of guards against terrorism, the horrors begin. Henri Cazaux, a psychopathic Belgian ex special Forces soldier, is out for revenge against the United States. After a botched exchange of military hardware leads to federal agents swarming the airport where he was conducting the transaction, he escapes on his plane and ends up bombing a military airfield and San Francisco International with explosives, escaping via parachute in the process. Later at a staff meeting, he then is convinced by his financial manager to attack companies who have hubs at airports, using the chaos to make money by driving down the stocks of the companies attacked and conducting options on other transportation industries such as oil and railroads. Memphis International is targeted with explosives dropped from a cargo plane leading to heavy loss of life and a major shipping company's headquarters destroyed. Faced with the growing chaos, the President authorizes Admiral Hardcastle to help lead the operation by authorizing the military to defend airports across the nation through the use of Patriot missile batteries and around the clock air defense through intercepting any aircraft that deviates from their flight plan. After a failed attack by Cavaux's forces on Dallas-Fort Worth International and another botched incident when an F-16 on an intercept course mistakenly shoots down a TV news crew off the coast of New Jersey, the President cautiously begins to relax the strict civil emergency measures. A tip off by Cavaux's attorney leads to a joint agency raid on his hideout in New Jersey, where Cavaux escapes in the confusion. He then heads to New Hampshire where his final plan is unrevealed: attacking Washington DC itself. Under the cover of a disguised Air Force One, the operation begins with Cavaux's forces attacking and disabling all Patriot units and air defense forces in the Washington DC area. The disguised plane then launches a suicidal run on the Capitol. A remorseful F-16 pilot, who was blamed after failing to prevent the first attack on San Francisco which lead to the death of hundreds and his wingman, rams his jet into the plane, causing it to crash and cause heavy damage in the Washington Mall area, but sparing the Capitol. In the chaos, Cavaux attempts to kill Hardcastle himself, but is stopped by the FBI director. Cavaux escapes, and reveals his final plan: using another plane loaded with explosives to fly into the White House. Hardcastle, with the help of the local mission commander, manages to shoot down the plane using the Avenger Air Defense System, just before it strikes the White House. However, the White House is badly damaged in the explosion that follows. Cavaux escapes in the chaos, but is then shot dead by his top lieutenant, who remarks that Cavaux's time is over and now it's his time.

A forward, his final club was Northampton Town. He played for numerous clubs in his career, and was also a Northern Ireland international. He is currently first-team coach at Solihull Moors. Club career After four league games with Birmingham City, Coventry-born Quinn was sold to Second Division Blackpool for ¬£25,000. He scored a total of 47 goals and made 150 first-team starts over five years. Two of those goals were scored against Chelsea in the League Cup second round. On 12 August 1995, he opened the scoring in Blackpool's game at Bristol City after eleven seconds, equalling the club's fastest-ever goal by Bill Slater at Stoke City 46 years earlier. These exploits led West Bromwich Albion to sign Quinn for ¬£500,000. He made his Albion debut in a 1‚Äì1 home draw against Bury on 21 February 1998. He scored twice in a 2‚Äì1 win over Middlesbrough on 4 April 1998, his first goals for the club; however, he found goals hard to come by during his Baggies career, scoring just ten times in 123 appearances in all competitions. During 2001‚Äì02, Quinn was loaned out to Notts County, but returned to the Hawthorns when a permanent deal could not be agreed. He was then loaned out again, to Bristol Rovers, where he scored once against Kidderminster Harriers. In the days following Albion's promotion to the Premier League in April 2002, Quinn found himself surplus to requirements and was released. A few days later he moved to Dutch side Willem II. Quinn was released by Willem II in January 2005. He had been unhappy with his life in the Netherlands, and set about finding a new club in England whilst training with the MK Dons. He quickly became Paul Sturrock's first permanent signing for Sheffield Wednesday, joining on a short-term contract until the end of the season. After scoring two goals in fifteen appearances during four months at Hillsborough, Quinn signed for Peterborough United in August 2005. In October of the same year he went on a month's loan to Bristol City, scoring on his debut against Oldham Athletic. He signed for Northampton Town in August 2006, scoring his first and what turned out to be only goal for the club against Brighton on 21 October 2006. On 21 December 2006, a poor start to the season saw him placed on the transfer list alongside Andy Kirk and Scott McGleish. In March 2007 Quinn joined Scunthorpe United on loan for the remainder of the season. He was an unused substitute for the Iron on several occasions, but did not experience any first-team action. Quinn retired from playing football on 11 September 2007, due to his failure to break back into the Northern Ireland team. International career Quinn collected fifty caps for Northern Ireland, and scored goals against Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta and Serbia & Montenegro.

He obtained the UEFA Pro Licence in 2012 and in 2013 was appointed Head Coach of USL Premier Development League side Central Jersey Spartans, shortly before their dissolution. In the summer of 2015, he joined National League team, Tranmere Rovers, as first-team coach under new manager Gary Brabin. Following a short spell coaching in America he returned to England and in August 2018 he was appointed as the first-team coach at National League club Solihull Moors, working alongside Tim Flowers.

Born into a leading Pomeranian landowning family (he was born at the noble estate of Gut Trieglaff, near Greifenberg, Pomerania), he was the half-brother of Elisabeth von Thadden, a prominent critic of the National Socialists who was executed by the Third Reich in September 1944.Echoes from an Unhappy Past, Time, 26 September 1969, retrieved 24 June 2009 Early life Thadden was born into the Thadden family, one of Pomerania's oldest Junker families, with his father a prominent local magistrate.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1990, p. 387 He educated at the gymnasium in Greifenberg and subsequently studied agriculture and economics. On 1 September 1939 he became a member of the National Socialist German Workers Party.Bergmann, W. (e.a.) (2009) Handbuch des Antisemitismus. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, p. 822 He served as a lieutenant with the Wehrmacht in the Second World War, suffering a number of battle injuries during the conflict.Louis L. Snyder, Encyclopedia of the Third Reich, Wordsworth, 1998, p. 344 A brigade adjutant in the artillery section, he was captured near the end of the war by Polish forces. Thadden later went to court to sue over rumours that he had collaborated with the Poles during his imprisonment. He was successful in his case. He escaped captivity in November 1946 and fled to the British Zone of Occupation, finding work with the British Property Control in G√∂ttingen, where he settled. Political career After the war, Thadden entered politics as a member of the Deutsche Rechtspartei and its successor the Deutsche Reichspartei.R. Eatwell, Fascism: A History, London: Pimlico, 2003, p. 281 As a member of both, he served as a councilman in G√∂ttingen from 1948 to 1958. Elected to the Bundestag in 1949, he was the second youngest member and was thus addressed by an SPD member as 'Bubi', (a nickname that stuck with him). He became the main writer on the party organ Reichsruf, gaining a reputation both for his demagogy and his extensive use of humour and wit. He remained a Bundestag member to 1953 and again from 1955 to 1959, was a Senator from 1952 to 1958 and a member of the Landtag of Lower Saxony from 1956 to 1959. In the 1950s he was befriended by Winifred Wagner, whose grandson Gottfried Wagner later recalled that Having been deputy to leader Wilhelm Meinberg, Thadden became chairman of the Deutsche Reichspartei in 1961 and in this position was one of the signatories of the European Declaration at Venice which set up the National Party of Europe. Thadden was personally close to the British Union Movement leader Oswald Mosley, on whose initiative the NPE was founded, and was attracted to his concept of Europe a Nation.Graham Macklin, Very Deeply Dyed in Black, IB Tauris, 2007, p. 90 He specifically denied any accusations of neo-Nazism levelled at him, arguing that he was a supporter of conservative nationalism. However, he was frequently labelled a neo-Nazi due to his prominent opposition to the notion of any German guilt for the Second World War. NPD Thadden played a leading role in formation of the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) by merging his party with a number of other rightist groups, including a revived German National People's Party in 1964. He was initially overlooked as leader in favour of Friedrich Thielen of the German Party. Thadden regularly clashed with the more moderate Thielen and both men were involved in several lawsuits against each other, aimed at gaining control of the NPD and ousting their rival from membership. Thadden was eventually appointed chairman in 1967. He moved the party to the right, bringing in policies such as withdrawal from NATO, a return of Danzig to a united Germany, wide-ranging reform of the constitution and possibly a second Anschluss. In one of his more widely reported activities, Thadden accidentally referred to the party as National Socialists rather than National Democrats in a television interview, something that was frequently brought up by critics who accused Thadden and his party of neo-Nazism. He remained leader until 1971, achieving strong showings in regional elections, although the party failed to gain representation in the Bundestag under his leadership (and have never managed to do so).P. Ignazi, Extreme Right Parties in Western Europe, Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 67 Although a loyal supporter of his successor, Martin Mussgnug, Thadden eventually left the NPD in 1975 after Gerhard Frey, who had previously been a harsh critic of von Thadden, was appointed Federal Administrator of the party.C.P. Blamires, World Fascism ‚Äì A Historical Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 658 He left active politics in 1974 and worked for a construction firm, although he remained as chief editor of the Deutsche Wochenzeitung into the 1980s. He maintained an interest in publishing for several years and was reported as acting on behalf of the Gesellschaft f√ºr freie Publizistik, a far- right journalism organisation linked to the NPD in 1981 and 1982. Death Thadden died on 16 July 1996, in Bad Oeynhausen, at the age of 75. Since Thadden's death it has been claimed that he was a secret agent of the United Kingdom's external security agency, MI6.Neo-Nazi leader 'was MI6 agent', John Hooper, The Guardian, 13 August 2002, retrieved 24 June 2009 References Category:1921 births Category:1996 deaths Category:People from Gryfice County Category:People from the Province of Pomerania Category:Nazi Party politicians Category:Deutsche Rechtspartei politicians Category:Deutsche Reichspartei politicians Category:National Democratic Party of Germany politicians Category:German military personnel of World War II Category:Leaders of political parties in Germany Category:German anti-communists Category:Members of the Bundestag for Lower Saxony Category:German nationalists Category:Members of the Landtag of Lower Saxony Category:Political party founders ","title":"Adolf von Thadden"},{"id":"6868646","text":"Trond Egil Soltvedt (born 15 February 1967) is a Norwegian former footballer who played as a midfielder. After playing for Viking, Brann and Rosenborg in Norway, he played in England with Coventry, Southampton and Sheffield Wednesday before he retired. Soltvedt was capped four times playing for Norway. Playing career Norway Soltvedt started his professional career at Viking in Stavanger in 1987 and was a member of the team who won the Norwegian Cup in 1989 and the Tippeligaen in its inaugural year, 1991. In 1992, he joined mid-table club Brann. At the end of his first season he was voted the club's \\"most popular\\" player. During his time at Brann, the club finished each season in 6th or 7th place in the league. His extremely dedicated style, his innocent and somewhat na√Øve personality and the fact that many of his goals were scored as a midfielder made him immensely popular. Just before the start of the 1995 season, however, he was sacked by Brann's board for \\"illoyality\\", the board refusing to elaborate on this. This prompted a demonstration from fans supporting Soltvedt. After three seasons at Brann, he moved to Rosenborg where he was able to share in more success, claiming the Tippeligaen championship in 1995 and 1996 as well as winning the Norwegian Cup in 1995. Trond Egil was also part of the Rosenborg team who beat AC Milan 2-1 away at the San Siro to advance to the quarter-finals of the Champions League. England His success in Norway brought him to the attention of English clubs and after an unsuccessful trial at Stoke City, Gordon Strachan signed him for Coventry City for a fee of ¬£500,000 in July 1997. After two seasons at Coventry City, he was then signed by Southampton under Dave Jones in August 1999 for ¬£300,000. He was a \\"tall, elegant midfielder who added an air of calm authority whenever he played\\". He made his Saints debut as a substitute in a 4-2 victory over Newcastle United on 15 August 1999, helping to set up Mark Hughes for the final goal. He made a total of 24 appearances in the 1999-2000 season, playing in midfield alongside Matthew Le Tissier and Marians Pahars as Saints struggled both in defence and in attack, finishing in the lower half of the table. Soltvedt missed a large part of the last few months of the season with persistent groin problems. After replacing Jones as Southampton's manager, Glenn Hoddle soon transferred Soltvelt to Sheffield Wednesday, initially on loan before making the deal permanent in March 2001 for an appearance-based fee which had the potential to rise as high as ¬£200,000. He remained at Sheffield Wednesday for three seasons and was appointed team captain. Unfortunately, he was unable to prevent Wednesday being relegated at the end of the 2002-03 season, when he was released, returning to Norway to play in the lower leagues.

Roedean School The village is famous for its independent school, Roedean.Rodean School official website, Contact us Physical features and history Roedean Gap is a slight dip in the cliffs between Black Rock and Ovingdean Gap, and has been known by the name since at least 1724. It was the site of a toll-gate on the Newhaven turnpike, and Roedean Farm stood on the clifftop until the construction of the Marine Drive road in the early 1930s. There was also a windmill at Roedean from around 1750 to about 1790, and the old mill-house was amongst the buildings cleared for the road construction. Roedean Bottom extends northwards from the gap and has been the site of a number of Roman finds. In about 1900 an isolated row of coastguard cottages now known as Roedean Terrace was erected to the west of the valley. The Roedean estate, which was developed around the terrace from the 1930s, is now one of Brighton's most exclusive residential districts with a population of around 600. The open spaces along the cliff top were acquired by the corporation in 1928‚Äì35. The miniature golf-course opened in April 1957, but was reduced to 16 holes in 1988 for the new layout of Marine Drive to cater for Marina traffic; the adjacent area to the north of Roedean Road has also been used as a pitch-and-putt golf course. The East Brighton Golf Club in Roedean Road is a private club, founded in 1893 as the Kemp Town Golf Club.East Brighton Golf Club official website Initially it had just a few holes alongside Roedean Road, but it was soon extended to nine holes across the Downs, and in 1897 changed its name to East Brighton with the addition of another nine holes. The small clubhouse was near the present fourth tee, but the present clubhouse was erected in 1897 and extended several times until 1912. The course itself is 6,291 yards long and was remodelled in 1903 along Wick Bottom; the land is leased from the corporation which acquired it in September 1913 as part of the East Brighton estate. Past presidents of the club include the Duke of Norfolk, Marquess of Abergavenny, Earl of Chichester and Earl Haig. White Lodge, The Cliff, Roedean is an atypically small house by Sir Edwin Lutyens, built for Victoria Sackville. It was one of the architect's first commissions, and herringbone-style vertically laid floor tiles in the garden were in part laid by the architect himself. Roedean Road itself opened between Arundel Road and the coast road at Roedean Farm in 1897 as an alternative to the cliff-top road which had become unusable to the east of Black Rock owing to cliff erosion; seventy-five feet of land had disappeared in fifty years. The new road to Rottingdean, Marine Drive, was opened on 22 July 1932 by Percy John Pybus, Minister of Transport, with the cliffs protected by the Undercliff Walk sea-wall. John Howard House at the western end of Roedean Road (which today would be considered part of the mid-late 20th century East Brighton estate of Whitehawk) was opened in 1914 at the expense of Sir John Howard as a convalescent home for gentlewomen, but it was almost immediately requisitioned for use as an officers' hospital in World War I. Since 1974 it has been a home of the Royal Hospital and Home for Incurables, which is based in Putney and run on a voluntary basis. Opposite is a large electrical substation built by the local authority in 1924, and the Bell Tower Industrial Estate, developed in 1983 on the site of St Mark's School; the school's bell-tower is preserved as the estate's distinctive feature.

Thrissur district was formed on 1 July 1949. It is an important cultural centre, and is known as the Cultural Capital of Kerala. It is famous for the Thrissur Pooram festival, one of the most colourful and spectacular temple festival of Kerala. From ancient times, Thrissur has played a significant part in the political, economical and cultural history of Indian sub continent and South East Asia. It has opened the gates for Arabs, Romans, Portuguese, Dutch and English. Thrissur is where Christianity, Islam and Judaism entered the Indian sub continent, when Thomas the Apostle arrived in 52 CE and the location of country's first Mosque in the 7th century. Etymology The name Thrissur is derived from 'Thiru-Shiva- Perur', which literally translates to \\"The City with the name of the Lord Siva\\". Thrissur was also known as \\"Vrishabhadripuram\\" and \\"Thenkailasam\\" (Kailasam of the South) in ancient days. Another interpretation is 'Tri-shiva- peroor' or the big land with 3 Shiva temples, which refers to the three places where Lord Shiva resides ‚Äì namely Vadakkumnathan Temple, Asokeswaram Siva Temple near Vadakkechira, North Bus stand, Irattachira Siva Temple, Near Sakthan Bus stand Pre-history Megalithic Menhir at Ramavarmapuram Kerala Starting from the Stone Age, Thrissur must have been the site of human settlement. This is evidenced by the presence of a megalithic monuments at Ramavarmapuram, Kuttoor, Cherur and Villadam. The Ramavarmapuram monument is in granite and is of Menhir type. The monument in Ramavarmapuram is 15 feet height and 12 feet 4 inches broad. From 1944, it is under the protection of Department of Archaeology. The monument is locally known as 'Padakkallu' or 'Pulachikkallu'. These menhirs are memorials for the departed souls put up at burial sites. They belong to the Megalithic Age of Kerala, which is roughly estimated between 1000 BCE and 500 CE.S Hemachandran, \\"Monuments Embossing History\\", Kerala Calling, July 2007. (Retrieved on 24 January 2009) All such monuments have not been dated exactly. Some experts are of the view that these are the remnants of the Neolithic Age in the development of human technology. The Ramavarmapuram Menhir is also believed to be a monument belonging to the Sangam period in the South Indian history.V V K Valath (1992).

Kerala Sahithya Akadamy, Thrissur. Another monolithic monuments like Dolmens and rock-cut caves are at Porkulam, Chiramanengad, Eyyal, Kattakambal and Kakkad. The monument excavated under Archaeologist BK Thapar, between 1949‚Äì50, was under the Department of Archaeology. Another megalithic monument is situated at Ariyannur in Thrissur. This place has unravelled monuments such as the 'Kudakkallu' or 'Thoppikkallu' (Mushroom stones or Umbrella stones) and 'Munimada' (Saint's abode). The laterite hillocks of Ariyannur rise to about 50 metres. Another reference in Ariyannur dates back to the early 15th century in the poem 'Chandrotsavam'. Chera Dynasty The early political history of the Thrissur and Thrissur district is interlinked with that of the Chera Dynasty of the Sangam age, who ruled over vast portions of Kerala with their capital at Vanchi. Kodungallur was also the capital of Cheraman Perumal, the last Chera ruler in the 7th century. The legend is that he abdicated his throne and divided his kingdom among the local chieftains and left for Mecca to embrace Islam. This place was later ruled by the Kingdom of Cochin (Perumpadapu Swaroopam). During the time of the Chera ruler, Kodungallur was an important trade link in Indian Ancient Maritime History. The whole of the present Thrissur district was included in the early Chera empire. The district can claim to have played a significant part in fostering the trade relations between Kerala and the outside world in the ancient and medieval period. It can also claim to have played an important part in fostering cultural relations and in laying the foundation of a cosmopolitan and composite culture in this part of the country. Muziris (Muchiri) was an important port city in the pre-historic era, was a part of it. Muziris Muziris, as shown in the Tabula Peutingeriana. Muziris (1st century BCE), is a lost port city in Kodungallur and was a major center of trade in kerala between the Chera Empire and the Roman Empire.Muziris (Cranganore) was destroyed by massive flooding of the river Periyar in 1341, opening a new port called Kochi.Muziris was also known as Mahodayapuram, Shinkli, Muchiri (anglicised to Muziris) and Muyirikkodu. It is known as 'Vanchi' to locals.Muziris opened the gates for Arabs, Romans, Portuguese, Dutch and English to Indian sub continent and South East Asia. Muziris dealers had set Indo-Greek and Indo-Roman trade with Egypt, which comes in gold and other metals, pepper and spices, precious stones and textiles. It was famous as a major port for trade and commerce for more than 2,500 years. There has always been a lot of confusion about the exact location of the port, as also about other aspects of it. For long it was considered to be Kodungalloor. However, in 1983, a large hoard of Roman coins was found at a site around 10 km from a place called Pattanam, some distance away from Kodungalloor. Excavations carried out from 2004 to 2009 at Pattanam has revealed evidence that may point out the exact position of Muziris. The recent archaeological work done in the area has revealed fragments of imported Roman amphora, mainly used for transporting wine and olive oil, Yemeni and West Asian pottery, besides Indian roulette ware (which is also common on the East Coast of India, and also found in Berenice in Egypt). This suggests that Muziris was a port of great international fame and that South India was involved in active trade with several civilizations of West Asia, the Near East and Europe with the port as a means to do so. While there is a consensus on that both the port and the city ceased to exist around the middle of the 13th century, possibly following an earthquake (or the great flood of 1341 recorded in history, which caused the change of course of Periyar river), there does not seem to be clear evidence as to when the port might have first come into being. Presently, researchers seem to be agreed on that the port was already a bustling center of trade by 500 BCE, and there is some evidence that suggests that Muziris was a city, even if not certainly a port as well, from before 1500 BCE.http://www.samachaar.in/Delhi/Trade_links_of_Kerala_city_date_back_to_500_BC_19220/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/index.php?issueid=&id;=3689&option;=com_content&task;=view&sectionid;=21 It is called as 'Murachipatanam' in Sanskrit and Muchiri in Tamil. Later it was also called as Makothai, Mahodayapuram, Mahodayapattanam. The port was familiar to the author of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea who described it as being situated on Pseudostomos river (Œ®ŒµœÖŒ¥œåœÉœÑŒøŒºŒøœÇ: Greek for \\"false mouth\\" ‚Äì a precise translation of the Malayalam description of the mouth of the Periyar, Alimukam) 3 km from its mouth. According to the Periplus, numerous Greek seamen managed an intense trade with Muziris: Muziris is also mentioned in the epics Ramayana, Mahabharatha, Akananuru, and Chilappathikaram. The poets Pathanjali and Karthiyayan have referred to it, as well as the travelogues of both Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy under different names. Moreover, Kodungallur (Muziris) is mentioned in the stone writings of Ashoka. It was known as Muziris to Pliny the Elder (N.H. 6.26), who describes it as primum emorium Indiae. The ancient Greek explorer Hippalus landed at this port after discovering the patterns of the Indian monsoon trade winds on his way from the aast African coast. Evidence of the Peutinger Table suggests that there was a temple dedicated to the Roman emperor Augustus. The Greeks, the Romans (known locally as the Yavanas) and the Jews, Arabs etc. all have come to this place at different times in its history. Roman gold and silver coins bearing impressions of Roman Emperors Tiberius and Nero were discovered in the village Kochal in Valluvally-Koonammavu near Paravur near the town in 1983. A 2nd-century papyrus from Egypt concerning the transshipment of goods originating in Muziris from the Red Sea to Alexandria attests to the continued importance of the port in the Indian Ocean commerce trade a century after Pliny and the Periplus.Th√ºr, G. 1987.

Tyche 2:229‚Äì245. =Thomas the Apostle (51‚Äì52)= Statue of St. Thomas at Palayoor in Thrissur district. In 52 St Thomas landed at Palayoor by boat from Muziris. He came to visit the Jewish merchants at Palayur Judankunnu and to preach the good news in course of time. The indigenous church of Kerala has a tradition that St. Thomas sailed there to spread the Christian faith. He landed at the ancient port of Muziris. He then went to Palayoor (near present-day Guruvayoor), which was a Hindu priestly community at that time. He left Palayoor in 52 for the southern part of what is now Kerala State, where he established the Ezharappallikal, or \\"Seven and Half Churches\\". These churches are at Kodungallur, Kollam, Niranam, Nilackal (Chayal), Kokkamangalam, Kottakkavu, Palayoor (Chattukulangara) and Thiruvithancode Arappally ‚Äì the half church. \\"It was to a land of dark people he was sent, to clothe them by Baptism in white robes. His grateful dawn dispelled India's painful darkness. It was his mission to espouse India to the One-Begotten. The merchant is blessed for having so great a treasure. Edessa thus became the blessed city by possessing the greatest pearl India could yield. Thomas works miracles in India, and at Edessa Thomas is destined to baptize peoples perverse and steeped in darkness, and that in the land of India.\\" ‚Äì Hymns of St. Ephraem, edited by Lamy (Ephr. Hymni et Sermones, IV). Cheraman Juma Masjid (629) Believed to be built in 629 by Malik Bin Deenar, Cheraman Juma Masjid is considered as the oldest mosque in India, and the second oldest mosque in the world to offer Jumu'ah prayers. Constructed during the lifetime of Muhammad, the bodies of some of his original followers are said to be buried here. Unlike other mosques in Kerala that face westwards this mosque faces eastwards. Though, generally it is considered to be the second mosque of the world after the mosque in Medina, Saudi Arabia. The legend has it that a group of Muhammad's Sahaba (companions) visited Kodungallur. Cheraman Perumal (Rama Varma Kulashekhara), then the Chera ruler, had witnessed a miraculous happening ‚Äì the sudden splitting of the moon, the celebrated miracle of Muhammad ‚Äì and learned on inquiry that this was a symbol of the coming of a Messenger of God from Arabia. Soon after, Perumal travelled to Makkah, where he embraced Islam, and accepted the name Thajudeen. On his way back to India he died at Salalah in the Sultanate of Oman. On his deathbed he is said to have authorised some of his Arab companions to go back to his kingdom to spread Islam. Accordingly, a group of Arabs led by Malik Bin Deenar and Malik bin Habib arrived in north Kerala, and constructed the Cheraman Juma Masjid at Kodungalloor. Cochin Royal Family Statue of Rama Varma Thampuran in Thrissur There is no extant written evidence about the emergence of Kingdom of Cochin or of the Cochin Royal Family, also known as Perumpadapu Swaroopam. All that is recorded are folk tales and stories, and there is a somewhat blurred historical picture about the origins of the ruling dynasty. The surviving manuscripts, such as Keralolpathi, Keralamahatmyam, and Perumpadapu Grandavari, are collections of myths and legends that are less than reliable as conventional historical sources. There is an oft-recited legend that the last Perumal who ruled Kerala divided his kingdom between his nephews and his sons, converting to Islam and traveling to Mecca on a hajj. The Keralolpathi recounts the above narrative in the following fashion: > The last and the famous Perumal king Cheraman Perumal ruled Kerala for 36 > years. He left for Mecca by ship with some Muslims who arrived at > Kodungallur (Cranganore) port and converted to Islam. Before leaving for > Mecca, he divided his kingdom between his nephews and sons. The Perumpadapu Grandavari contains an additional account of the dynastic origins: > The last Thavazhi of Perumpadapu Swaroopam came into existence on the > Kaliyuga day shodashangamsurajyam. Cheraman Perumal divided the land in > half, 17 amsha north of Neelaeswaram and 17 amsha south, totaling 34 amsha, > and gave his powers to nephews and sons. Thirty-four rajyas between > Kanyakumari and Gokarna, now in Karnataka were given to the Thampuran who > was the daughter of the last niece of Cheraman Perumal. Keralolpathi recorded the division of his kingdom in 345, Perumpadapu Grandavari in 385, Loghan (a historian) in 825. There are no written records on these earlier divisions of Kerala, but according to writer Elamkulam Kunjan Pillai, a division might have occurred during the Second Chera Kingdom, at the beginning of the 12th century. The history of Thrissur from the 9th to the 12th centuries is the history of Kulasekharas of Mahodayapuram and the history since the 12th century is the history of the rise and growth of Perumpadapu Swaroopam. In the course of its long and chequered history, the Perumpadappu Swarupam had its capital at different places. According to the literary works of the period, the Perumpadapu Swaroopam had its headquarters at Mahodayapuyram and had a number of Naduvazhies in southern Kerala. Central Kerala recognised the supremacy of the Perumpadappu Moopil and he is even referred to as the 'Kerala Chakravarthi' in the 'Sivavilasam' and some other works. One of the landmarks in the history of the Perumpadapu Swaroopam is the foundation of a new era called Pudu Vaipu era. The Pudu Vaipu era is traditionally believed to have commenced from the date on which the island of Vypeen was thrown from the sea. The 14th and 15th centuries constituted a period of aggressive wars in the course of which the Zamorins of Calicut acquired a large part of the present Thrissur district. In the subsequent centuries the Portuguese dominated the scene. By the beginning of the 17th century the Portuguese power in Kerala was on the verge of collapse. About this time other European powers like the Dutch and the English appeared on the scene and challenged the Portuguese. Internal dissension in the Perumpadappu Swarupam helped the Dutch in getting a footing on the Kerala coast. As the Kerala chiefs were conscious of the impending doom of the Portuguese, they looked upon the Dutch as the rising power and extended a hearty welcome to them. Flood of 1341 The flood of the river Periyar in 1341 resulted in the splitting of the left branch of the river into two just before Aluva. The flood silted the right branch (known as River Changala) and the natural harbour at the mouth of the river, and resulted in the creation of a new harbour at Kochi. An island was formed with the name Vypinkara between Vypin to Munambam during the flood. During this time there was the rise of the Samoothiri Rajas of Kozhikode. The town was nearly completely destroyed by the Portuguese (Suarez de Menezes) on 1 September 1504 in retaliation for the Samoothiri Raja's actions against them. Portuguese Raid on Cranganore India Malabar Coast c. 1500 October 1504 While in Cochin, Lopo Soares receives reports that the Zamorin of Calicut has dispatched a force to fortify Cranganore, the port city at the northern end of the Vembanad lagoon, and the usual entry point for the Zamorin's army and fleet into the Kerala backwaters. Reading this as a preparation for a renewed attack on Cochin after the 6th Armada leaves, Lopo Soares decides on a preemptive strike. He orders a squadron of around ten fighting ships and numerous Cochinese bateis and paraus, to head up there. The heavier ships, unable to make their way into the shallow channels, anchor at Palliport (Pallipuram, on the outer edge of Vypin island), while those ships, bateis and paraus that can continue on. Converging on Cranganore, the Portuguese-Cochinese fleet quickly disperses the Zamorin's forces on the beach with cannon fire, and then lands an amphibian assault force ‚Äì some 1,000 Portuguese and 1,000 Cochinese Nairs, who take on the rest of the Zamorin's forces in close combat. The Zamorin's forces are defeated and driven away from the city.Castanheda, p.272 The assault troops capture Cranganore, and subject the ancient city, the once-great Chera capital of Kerala, to a thorough and violent sacking and razing. Deliberate fires were already started by squads led by Duarte Pacheco Pereira and factor Diogo Fernandes Correa, while the main fighting was still going on. They quickly consume most of the city, save for the Syrian Christian quarters, which are carefully spared (Jewish and Muslim homes are not given the same consideration). In the meantime, the Calicut fleet of some five ships and 80 paraus that had been dispatched to save the city are intercepted by the idling Portuguese ships near Palliport and defeated in a naval encounter.Mathew (1997: p.14) Two days later, the Portuguese receive an urgent message from the ruler of the Kingdom of Tanur (also known as Tanore or Vettattnad), whose kingdom lay to the north, on the road between Calicut and Cranganore. The raja of Tanur had come to loggerheads with his overlord, the Zamorin, and offered to place himself under Portuguese suzerainty instead, in return for military assistance. He reports that a Calicut column, led by the Zamorin himself, had been assembled in a hurry to try to save Cranganore, but that he managed to block its passage at Tanur. Lopo Soares immediately dispatches P√™ro Rafael with a caravel and a sizeable Portuguese armed force to assist the Tanurese. The Zamorin's column is defeated and dispersed soon after its arrival. Relics of the Cranganore Fort built by the Portuguese on the shores of the Kottapuram River The raid on Cranganore and the defection of the raja of Tanur were serious setbacks to the zamorin, pushing the frontline north and effectively placing the Vembanad lagoon out of the Zamorin's reach. Any hopes the Zamorin had of quickly resuming his attempts to capture Cochin via the backwaters are effectively dashed. No less importantly, the battles at Cranganore and Tanur, which involved significant numbers of Malabari captains and troops, clearly demonstrated that the Zamorin was no longer feared in the region. The Battle of Cochin had broken his authority. Cranganore and Tanur showed that Malabaris were no longer afraid of defying his authority and taking up arms against him. The Portuguese were no longer just a passing nuisance, a handful of terrifying pirates who came and went once a year. They were a permanent disturbance, turning the old order upside down. A new chapter was being opened on the Malabar coast. Cranganore Fort (1523) Cranganore Fort was built by Portuguese in 1523 and later it in 1565 it was enlarged. It is also known as Kottappuram Fort. The Dutch took possession of the fort in 1661. In 1776, Tipu Sultan seized the control of fort. The Dutch wrested it back from Tipu Sultan, but the fort eventually came under the control of Tipu, who destroyed it in the following year. The remains of the fort show that the original fort wall was 18 feet in thickness. The ruin is also known as Tipu's fort. Mysorean invasion (1773‚Äì1790) The 1773 conquest of the Mysore King Hyder Ali in the Malabar region descended to Kochi. The Kochi Raja had to pay a subsidy of one hundred thousand of Ikkeri Pagodas (equalling 400,000 modern rupees). Later on, in 1776, Hyder Ali capture Thrissur, which was under the Kingdom of Kochi. Thus, the Raja was forced to become a tributary of Mysore and to pay a nuzzar of 100,000 of Pagodas and 4 elephants and annual tribute of 30,000 Pagodas. The hereditary Prime Ministership of Cochin came to an end during this period. His son Tipu Sultan's invasion had an adverse impact on the Syrian Malabar Nasrani community of the Malabar coast. Many churches in Malabar and Cochin were damaged. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Syrian Malabar Nasrani were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Syrian Malabar farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tipu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, Mavelikkara, etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses. Colonel Macqulay, the British resident of Travancore also helped them.K.L. Bernard, Kerala History , pp.78‚Äì79 Sakthan Thampuran (1790‚Äì1805) In 1790, Raja Rama Varma popularly known as Sakthan Thampuran ascended the throne of Kingdom of Cochin. With the accession of this ruler, the modern period in the history of Kochi and the Thrissur District and the city begin. Sakthan Thampuran was the most powerful maharaja as the very name indicated. His punishment of criminals and wrongdoers was considered harsh but helped restore peace to the country. Sakthan Thampuran had been at the helm of affairs since 1769 when all administrative authority in the Cochin State was delegated to him by the then reigning sovereign on the initiative of the Travancore Raja and the Dutch Governor. As his very name suggests, this Raja was a strong ruler and his reign was characterised by firm and vigorous administration. By the end of the 18th century, the power of the feudal chieftains had been crushed and royal authority had become supreme. Sakthan Thampuran was mainly responsible for the destruction of the power of the feudal chieftains and increase of royal power. Another potent force in the public life of Thrissur and its suburbs was the Namboothiri community and the Syrian Christian community. A large part of the Thrissur taluk was for long under the domination of the Yogiatiripppads, the ecclesiastical heads of the Vadakkunnathan and Perumanam Devaswoms. The Yogiatirippads were elected and consecrated by the Namboothiri Yogams of the respective places. Under their leadership the Namboothiri families of Thrissur and Perumanam were playing in active part against the ruler of Cochin in his wars against the Zamorin of Calicut. Hence after the expulsion of the Zamorin from Thrissur in 1761, drastic action was taken against these families by the Raja of Cochin. The institution of Yogiatirippads was discontinued and the management of Thrissur and Perumanam Devaswoms were taken over by the Government. The Namboothiri Yogams were reduced to impotence. Thus the anti- feudal measures of Sakthan Thampuran coupled with the several administrative reforms introduced by him marked the end of the medieval period in the history of Cochin and ushered in the modern epoch of progress. It may be interesting in this connection to know something about the institution of the Yogatirippad. The Yogatirippad of the Vadakkunnathan Devaswom was elected by the Namboothiri illams of Thrissur and its suburbs. The Yogatirippad was elected for life in the presence of the ruler of Cochin, local chieftains and prominent Namboothiri from places outside Thrissur. The Yogatirippad was a very powerful and influential dignitary. The last Yogatirippad was banished from Thrissur in 1763 for having joined the side of the Zamorin against Cochin. Sakthan Thampuran put an end to the institution of the Yogatirippad. Since then the numerous Namboothiri illams situated in Thrissur gradually became extinct. But even today there are a few Namboothiri illams in Thrissur and its suburbs reminding one of those old days when the Namboothiri Yogam of Thrissur along with the Perumanam Yogam exercised jurisdiction over a large portion of the present Thrissur taluk. Sakthan Thampuran enjoyed good relations with the British authorities and was also a personal friend of Dharma Raja of Travancore. Sakthan Thampuran married twice. His first wife was a Nair lady from the reputed Vadakke Kuruppath family of Thrissur (several members of the Cochin Royal Family later took spouses from this family) whom he married when he was 30 years old. He is said to have had a daughter from this first wife. However, this Nethyar Amma (title of the consort of the Cochin Rajah) died soon after an unhappy marriage. Thereafter the Sakthan Thampuran remained single for a few decades, marrying again at the age of 52. The second wife of the Sakthan Thampuran was Chummukutty Nethyar Amma of the Karimpatta family and was a talented musician and dancer of Kaikottikalli. She was 17 at the time of her marriage with the Sakthan Thampuran. The marriage was without issue and within four years, Sakthan Thampuran died. In those days the widowed Nethyar Ammas did not have any special provisions from the state and hence Chummukutty, at the age of 21, returned to her ancestral home. His palace, Shakthan Thampuran Palace, in Thrissur is preserved as a monument and he was responsible for developing the Thrissur city and also making it the Cultural Capital of Kerala. English Period (1805‚Äì1947) Image of main entrance of Vadakkunnathan Temple seen from Swaraj Round from Illustrated Guide to the South Indian Railway, printed by Hoe and Coat the 'Premier Press' The wave of nationalism and political consciousness which swept through the country since the early decades of this century has its repercussions in the Thrissur as well. Even as early as 1919 a Committee of the Indian National Congress was functioning in Thrissur. In the Civil Disobedience Movement of 1921, several persons in Thrissur city and other places in the District took active part and courted arrest. Thrissur District can claim the honour of having been in the forefront of the country-wide movement for temple entry and abolition of untouchability. The famous Guruvayur Satyagraha is a memorable episode in the history of the national movement. The Government of Cochin under the guidance of R.K. Shanmughom Chetti followed a policy of conciliation. By degrees the public demand for the introduction of responsible Government in the State grew strong. In August 1938, Cochin announced a scheme for reforming the State legislature and introducing a system as per the Government of India Act of 1919 in the British Indian provinces. The administration of certain departments was entrusted to an elected member of the legislature to be nominated by the Maharaja. In the elections to the reformed legislature two political parties, viz, the Cochin State Congress and the Cochin Congress won 12 and 13 seats respectively. With the help of a few independents Ambat Sivarama Menon who was the leader of the Cochin Congress Party took up office as Minister under the scheme in June 1938. On his death in August 1938, Dr A.R. Menon was appointed as Minister. When the State Legislature passed a vote of non-confidence against him, Dr Menon resigned office on 25 February 1942 and was succeeded by T.K. Nair, Nair was in office until 11 July 1945. The introduction of diarchy did not satisfy the political aspirations of the people of Cochin. The idea of full responsible Government on the basis of adult franchise had caught their imagination. On 26 January 1941 a new political organization called the Cochin State Praja Mandal took shape on the initiative of a few young politicians under the leadership of V. R. Krishnan Ezhuthachan. The Quit India movement of 1942 has its echoes in the District. After the release of the leaders from jail in 1943, the Cochin State Praja Mandal pursued its organizational activities more vigorously. In the elections to the State Legislature in 1945 it won 12, of the 19 seats contested by its candidates. At the annual conference of the Praja Mandal held at Ernakulam in 1946 it was decided to start a statewide movement for the achievement of a responsible Government. The State Legislature was scheduled to meet on 29 July, and it was decided that the day should be observed all over the State as responsible Government day. In pursuance of this decision, meetings and demonstrations were held all over the State demanding the end of Dewan's rule and the transfer of full political power to the elected representatives of the people. The Maharaja of Cochin announced in August 1946 decision to transfer all departments of the State Government except Law and Order and Finance to the control of Ministers responsible to the State Legislature. In co-operation with other parties in the State Legislature, the Cochin State Praja Mandal decided to accept the offer. Consequently, the first popular Cabinet of Cochin consisting of Panampilly Govinda Menon, C.R. Iyyunni, K.Ayyappan and T.K. Nair assumed office. The first step towards the achievement of the goal of Aikyakerala was taken with the integration of Travancore Cochin States in July 1949. With the linguistic reorganization of States in India, in November 1956 the Kerala State came into existence. Post Independence era Skyline of modern Thrissur city from the Bible Tower of Basilica of Our Lady of Dolours. In 1947, India gained independence from the British colonial rule. Cochin was the first princely state to join the Indian Union willingly. Post independence, E. Ikkanda Warrier became the first Prime Minister of Cochin. K.P.Madhavan Nair, P.T Jacob, C. Achutha Menon, Panampilly Govinda Menon were few of the other stalwarts who were in the forefront of the democratic movements. Then in 1949, Travancore-Cochin state came into being by the merger of Cochin and Travancore, with Parur T. K. Narayana Pillai as the first chief minister. Travancore-Cochin, was in turn merged with the Malabar district of the Madras State. Finally, the Government of India's 1 November 1956 States Reorganisation Act inaugurated a new state ‚Äì Kerala ‚Äì incorporating Travancore-Cochin, Malabar District, and the taluk of Kasargod, South Kanara.

The eggs are laid by the adult worm in the bronchi. They are coughed up, swallowed, and passed out via the feces. The eggs are then eaten by earthworms in which they develop through three larval stages over 10 days to become infective. The cycle is completed by the pig eating the earthworm. Infection, therefore, only occurs where pigs have access to earthworms, for example, in outdoor production. The larvae from the earthworm penetrate the intestine and migrate via the lymph nodes and blood vessels to the lungs, undergoing two more larval stages in the process. The prepatent period is 3-4 weeks.

His final appearance for the national side came in their 3-0 defeat against Brazil in the 1986 tournament. Club career At club level, O'Neill played for Leicester City, QPR, and Norwich City. However, his spell with the Canaries was cut short, and he made just one appearance for Norwich - against Wimbledon in 1987. On the field for just 34 minutes, an horrendous tackle from Dons player John Fashanu so severely damaged O'Neill's knee ligaments that he never played another professional game, and finished his playing career. O'Neill began legal proceedings against Fashanu for the tackle that ended his career, before settling out of court for ¬£70,000. He was granted a testimonial at Carrow Road by Norwich in the 1988-89 season. Management and administration After his playing career ended, O'Neill had a spell from 1990 managing Finn Harps of the League of Ireland. He later moved back to his home city and became a member of the board of Derry City for a period.

The fraternity was first mentioned in the Philippine Collegian in its November 24, 1933 article as the \\"first and only medical students' fraternity.\\" The Mu Sigma Phi does not confer honorary memberships.  History  The first fraternity in the University of the Philippines College of Medicine. Dr. Fernando Calderon, the first Filipino Dean of the UP College of Medicine and the first Filipino Director of the Philippine General Hospital, became the fraternity's first Faculty Adviser.  The Service Arm of the Fraternity  Being a fraternity of medical students, the Mu Sigma Phi has developed a tradition of service. Less than two years after its inception, Mu put together a fund for typhoon victims in the island province of Leyte. This unprecedented act was commended by then Governor-General Frank Murphy (the Philippines was under American rule until 1946). In the succeeding decades, the Fraternity put up projects for the College and its training hospital, the Philippine General Hospital (PGH). These projects, notably the Mu Blood Bank and the Mu Eye Bank, were turned over to the College. To facilitate access of indigent patients of the PGH to free medicines, Mu put up a 'Charity Medical Bag' in 1956. In line with the College's emphasis on community medicine, Mu has adopted several communities since the 1970s. Mu contributes medical and educational assistance to these areas through medical missions, public health seminars, and the training of local health workers. Several organizations, including the Philippine government, have recognized the efforts of Mu Sigma Phi in socio-civic work. In 1997, the Presidential Commission for Urban Poor cited the Fraternity as its \\"Most Active NGO Partner in Luzon\\", an award conferred by then President Fidel V. Ramos. The Committee of Health of the Philippine Senate, for its part, declared Mu to be the \\"Best Community Oriented Student Organization\\" in 2002. Recently, the Mu Sigma Phi was named as the 2007 Most Outstanding Student Organization in the University of the Philippines-Manila after also being bestowed the same honor the previous year. Today, service activities of the Fraternity include medical missions, blood- letting drives, benefit concerts, and working trips to its adopted communities. These are usually held on Saturday and Sundays as the undergraduate brods have classes from Monday to Friday. Major medical missions are occasionally held during summer and semestral breaks.  The Mu Sigma Phi Foundation  In 2004, alumni of the Mu Sigma Phi and its counterpart sorority formed the Mu Sigma Phi Foundation, a nonprofit organization which aims to support the projects of the UP College of Medicine. Its most recent project was the renovation of the Anatomy laboratory for the benefit of first-year medical students. This undertaking was completed on July 2006. In December 2008, Mu Sigma Phi celebrated its diamond jubilee. Its website lists over 1,600 brothers from all over the world.

The game features playable giant monsters that are reminiscent of characters from kaiju and tokusatsu films. In 1992, a sequel titled King of the Monsters 2 was released for arcades. Months later, King of the Monsters was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It would then be ported to the Sega Genesis in 1993. It was included in the video game SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1, which was released for the Wii, PlayStation 2 and PSP in 2008. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot. Players choose one of six monsters (four in the 16-bit ports) for battle, and two players can join forces to fight the monsters together. Battles end when one of the monsters is pinned for a three count or if time expires (in which case the player loses). The game consists of 12 total levels (8 in the 16-bit ports) which takes place in 6 cities in a futuristic 1996 Japan. Each city is featured twice with the game beginning and ending in Tokyo. Other cities include Kyoto, Okayama, Osaka, Kobe and Hiroshima (the latter two are omitted from the SNES port. The Sega Genesis port only features Tokyo with the other cities being \\"Mega Port\\", \\"Dragon City\\", and \\"Castle City\\"). The player first must defeat all six monsters, with the last monster being oneself, but in a different palette. Then the player must defeat the six monsters again, in the same order, but this time in different cities.King of the Monsters user's manual (Neo Geo AES, US) Characters * Geon: A Godzilla-like dinosaur. * Woo: A King Kong-like giant gorilla (not available on the ports). * Poison Ghost: A creature composed of toxic waste (not available on the ports). * Rocky: A giant Moai-like golem made of boulders. * Beetle Mania: A large beetle-like creature. * Astro Guy: A giant Ultraman-like superhero. Other appearances In 1992, a sequel called King of the Monsters 2: The Next Thing was released. In 2005, three characters from that sequel (Cyber-Woo, Super Geon and Atomic Guy) was featured in the SNK Playmore game NeoGeo Battle Coliseum, a fighting game featuring many of the company's popular characters. These characters also appeared as character cards in the DS game SNK vs Capcom: Card Fighters DS. In addition, to the original ports, King of the Monsters was included in SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1 featuring many rare pieces of the game's production art production art. In 2018, the game was ported to the Nintendo Switch Shop by Hamster as part of their Arcade Archives line. The port features two extra features in a High Score Mode and Caravan Mode. A Neo Geo CD version was advertised and even previewed, but it never released. Other media King of the Monsters was a regular on the popular Nickelodeon game show Nick Arcade. It was almost always picked, leaving other games like ActRaiser, Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts, and El Viento out, this was the same on earlier broadcasts of Sky1 show Games World. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed King of the Monsters on their April 1, 1991 issue as being the fourth most-successful table arcade unit of the year.

Igiƒá is a member of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of Republic of Srpska. He received his M.D. at the University of Belgrade and Ph.D. at the University of Sarajevo. He was a Professor of Pharmacology at the University of Tuzla (1978-1992), and the Director of the Department of Scientific, Cultural, and Educational International Exchange for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1990 to 1992, when he left at the start of the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina. His research career centered on the [Renin Angiotensin System  renin-angiotensin system]. While at the Universities of Tuzla and Banja Luka in the 1980s, Igiƒá organized an early anti-smoking campaign aimed at the territories of former Yugoslavia. Igiƒá served as the Editor-in-Chief of a Scripta Medica (Banja Luka), a medical journal, from 2010-2013. He also devised a new script, Slavica, a fused version of the (Cyrillic and Latin alphabet), used by speakers of the predominant southern Slavic languages (Serbo-Croatian). It was a quixotic attempt to mend the linguistic divisions among the Yugoslav ethnic groups, prior to outbreak of widespread [Balkan Wars  conflict].

A former gas worker of medium build, he was a prolific goalscorer in the Irish League and the Football League, adept at getting into good scoring positions and athletic enough to make the final touch count. \\"Head, heel or toe, slip it to Joe\\" became a famous catch-phrase when referring to him. His scoring of six goals for Ireland v Wales at Celtic Park on 1 February 1930 in a 7‚Äì0 win, still remains the record score for a British Isles player in an international fixture. Club career Irish League Bambrick began his professional career with Glentoran, spending a season there before moving to Belfast rivals Linfield. His scoring record with Linfield was phenomenal: he scored a total of 286 league goals in just 183 games, 50 of these coming in the 1930‚Äì31 season, which was the highest in the world that year and a then record in British football (Fred Roberts of Glentoran scored 55 the following season). In total that season he managed 96 goals in all competitions, and his overall goal tally for Linfield was 509 goals managed in just 8 years, finishing as Irish League top scorer on four occasions. Chelsea On 24 December 1935 Bambrick signed for English side Chelsea for a fee of ¬£3,000, making his debut the following day (Christmas Day) against Aston Villa. He then scored his first goal the day after (Boxing Day) also against Aston Villa at Villa Park. Bambrick scored Chelsea's goal in their highest-attended competitive match at their ground Stamford Bridge. A crowd of 82,905 watched the 1‚Äì1 draw with local rivals Arsenal on 12 October 1935. In total he scored 38 goals in 66 appearances for Chelsea, including four hat-tricks (on two of these occasions he managed four goals). Walsall Bambrick gradually fell out of favour, losing the number 9 shirt to George Mills, transferring to Walsall in July 1938 where he spent a season before the outbreak of World War II led to his retirement. He returned to Linfield as a coach, but Walsall retained his registration and refused to release him to play for Linfield in war-time competitions. He eventually played for Linfield in the 1943 County Antrim Shield when he scored his final goal. International career Bambrick scored 12 goals in 11 games for Ireland, including six in one game against Wales. His goal tally ensures that he still ranks as the joint-fourth highest goalscorer for the Northern Ireland national side.

Crypt for \\"Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament for Indians and Colored People\\" in Saint Louis Cemetery #3, New Orleans. History The Third Plenary Council of Baltimore (1884), which at the time was the meeting of all Roman Catholic bishops in the United States, renewed the vigor for missionary work among the \\"Colored and Indian races\\". Archbishop James O'Connor of Omaha, acting alongside Katharine Drexel, decided, with the approval of Archbishop P. J. Ryan of Philadelphia, to form a new congregation on behalf of Native Americans and African Americans. For some years previous to this step, Miss Drexel had been very active in re-establishing and supporting schools in many of the Indian reservations. The first sisters, including foundress Katharine Drexel, entered religious life under the tutelage of the Sisters of Mercy in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They were also inspired by O'Connor, who served as Drexel's spiritual director until his death. In 1889, after completing a two-year novitiate to learn the foundations of religious life and upon first profession of vows, these sisters were clothed in the habit of the new congregation of the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament of the Indians and Colored People.

Early in 1892 a mother-house and novitiate were opened at Cornwells Heights, Pennsylvania, adjoining which was erected a manual training and boarding school for African-American boys and girls. In June 1894, four sisters set out for Santa Fe, New Mexico to reopen St. Catherine Indian School.\\"Timeline\\", Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament Since then, the sisters have staffed a number of Catholic schools for Native American and African American children, which involved collaboration with the Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions, the Commission for the Catholic Missions among the Colored People and the Indians and other Catholic institutions.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a town and locality in the Hunter/Mid North Coast region of New South Wales, Australia in the Mid-Coast Council local government area. At the 2016 census, the locality had a population of 1,424. The main population centre, where 69% of the area's population lived in 2006, is the town of Bulahdelah. Geography The town is situated north of Sydney along the eastern and northern banks of the Myall River, approximately east of the confluence of the Myall and Crawford rivers. The eastern sector of the township is built on the foot of the Alum Mountain. Leading into the town from the south is the Bulahdelah Bridge which forms part of the Pacific Highway. History The mountain on which the south-eastern sector of the township is built was first named by the Aboriginal people of the area, the Worimi. They called their mountain \\"Boolah Dillah\\" (meaning: the Great Rock).Henning R., The Letters of Rachel Henning & Rupp H.M.R., The Orchid Man - The Life and Times of H.M.R. Rupp In 1818 John Oxley, a crown surveyor added the word \\"Mountain\\" to its original name. The mountain is widely known by its long-term nickname, \\"the Alum Mountain\\", but is officially registered as Bulahdelah Mountain. After the discovery of alunite on the mountain, the mountain was mined from 1878 to 1927, and was managed by the Department of Mining from 1897 onwards. A refinery \\"The Alum Works\\" was created to facilitate the extraction of alum from the mined alunite. Another period of mining was then again from 1934 to 1952. Decreasing profitability meant mining had ceased by 1952 and in 1979 NSW State Forests took over management of the mountain. Bulahdelah Bypass Construction of the timber bridge across the Myall River was completed in 1892 and the bridge was formally opened on 28 July 1892. A 2-lane concrete bridge over Myall River was completed in 1969. In 1970 the Bulahdelah tornado swept through the nearby forests, just north of Bulahdelah in what was Australia's most destructive tornado on record. On 3 May 2006 funding was approved (project approval was granted on 11 October 2007) for the relocation of the Bulahdelah section of Pacific Highway, to through the mid-slopes of Bulahdelah (the Alum) Mountain. Major construction of this highway deviation, known as the Bulahdelah Bypass, commenced in August 2010. The bypass was completed in July 2013. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 1,424 people in Bulahdelah. 83.8% of people were born in Australia and 91.2% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were Anglican 30.3%, Catholic 23.3% and No Religion 21.9%. Places of interest The Alum Mountain Overlooking the town of Bulahdelah, the Alum Mountain provides views of the area from Cabbage Tree Mountain to the coastline. A lookout is accessible via walking trails and car access extends about two thirds of the way up. Abandoned mining equipment from the mining operations up until 1952 is found in parts of the mountain as are blast caves. A disused mining cart trail directly up the mountain (known by the locals as \\"the trolley track\\") is part of the heritage mine-site complex.

They were formed in 1879 by a merger of the Ayr Thistle and Ayr Academicals football clubs. Their initial home ground was Springvale Park, which they left in 1884 to play home fixtures at Beresford Park, which they in turn left in 1888 to move to Somerset Park. Ayr won their first ever game at Somerset Park 3‚Äì0 against Aston Villa. Ayr had spent 13 seasons in the Scottish Football League Division Two, with a best finish of third place which they managed on three occasions. They never won promotion above this level. Ayr F.C. merged with fellow league members Ayr Parkhouse in 1910 to form Ayr United. This is the first and only example in Scottish football of a merger between two league clubs from the same town. The merger came about because it was felt that a merged club would have better prospects of playing in Division One. Ayr United achieved that status three years after the merger. Origins In 1879 two clubs from Ayr, Ayr Thistle and Ayr Academicals, merged to form a new club, the team was to be called Ayr F.C. and Springvale Park was chosen as the home ground. However, the club did retain the Academicals name for its Athletics section. There was a team simply called Ayr prior to the existence of Ayr F.C. but there is no connection between the two clubs. Shortly after the merger, a team calling themselves Ayr Thistle F.C. appeared briefly and shared only a name with the previous Ayr Thistle and no connection to the then-newly formed Ayr F.C., however, they did not last long. The Ayr Academicals name was also revived around 1884 and again had no connection to Ayr F.C. History At the time of the merger, two other prominent Ayr Clubs where Ayr Rovers F.C., who played at Savoy Park and Ayr Robert Burns F.C., who played at Mair Park and Virginia Park respectively. Ayr F.C. played both in their early years and in their first season they competed in the Scottish Cup for the first time, although they were put out in the First Round by Kilmarnock Athletic and the following season they recorded a 20-0 (twenty) over Dreghorn Black Watch in the Ayrshire Cup. Two weeks after this match they travelled to Belfast for an Exhibition match with Cliftonville, the Ayr side winning 4-1. These 'exhibition games' were regular and saw some of the biggest teams of the day play against the Ayr side, for example, Aston Villa played against Ayr no more than four times, three times in Ayr, once in Birmingham. By the turn of the century Ayr F.C. had also played in these exhibition matches against Sunderland, Preston North End and Bolton Wanderers. In 1884, Ayr F.C. moved the short distance from Springvale Park to Beresford Park at the top of the town (on the site that Odeon now stands). The inauguration match was won 3-1 against a side called Glasgow Pilgrims. The club's reserve side also had some success, with the 'Ayr Strollers' winning the 1887-88 Scottish Second XI Cup. In 1888, problems arose when the Annual Cattle Show was scheduled earlier than usual. The Cattle Show required Beresford Park and adjoining fields, but Ayr F.C. had a friendly arranged with Aston Villa on a conflicting date. This saw the club move north of the River Ayr to Somerset Park, originally renting it from Walker's Chemical Works, situated just to the north. They also brought their clubhouse and grandstand with them from Beresford Park. Further adjustments to the ground for about a decade saw the club left with a debt of ¬£600 in 1898. Ayr F.C.'s departure from Beresford Park, saw Ayr Parkhouse move in, and eventually developed a rivalry between the two clubs as the team from south of the river grew. A further important event in the club's history took place in 1888, when Ayr took on Canada and won convincingly 4-0 at the new Somerset Park. Between March and April 1897 Somerset Park was closed as the club changed the orientation of the pitch and to include a tarmacadam cycle track as well as a new grandstand. This was the format the ground would stay until the 1920s when it was changed to its current layout (by Ayr United). In 1901 Ayr F.C. won the Ayrshire Cup meaning the trophy would come back to the county town for the first time after defeating Stevenston Thistle 2-1 in a replay at Rugby Park. The club would go on to have further success in this competition, winning it again in 1905, 1906 and 1910, twice beating rivals Ayr Parkhouse in the final (in 1906 and 1910, in 1905 the beat Kilmarnock 1-0 to lift the trophy).

Burns Park was built in response to blue laws, which prevented Sunday games from being played at Bennett Park, the team's primary baseball park. The park was named for the Tigers' then- owner, James D. Burns, who built the ballpark on his own property. Sources are in some conflict about the exact location of the ballpark. Some have placed it on a triangular block between Livernois Avenue, Vernor Highway, and railroad tracks. However, contemporary sources place it at \\"south of the stock yards, at the corner of Waterman and Dix Avenues\\" [Detroit Free Press, April 25, 1900, p.8]; and Polk's 1901 Detroit City Directory states \\"southwest corner Toledo and Waterman Avenues.\\" Toledo was later renamed Vernor Highway, and Dix Street merges into Vernor Highway at the Waterman intersection. Marc Okkonen, in his book Minor League Baseball Towns of Michigan (Dickinson Press, 1997) also places the ballpark at the southwest corner of Waterman and Vernor. One source described the location as \\"near the stockyards in Springwells Township, just past the Detroit city line.\\" Being outside the city limits was key to being able to play Sunday ball there. The April 25, 1900, newspaper report stated that park was to have covered seating for 1,200 and open bleachers for about another 2,300. The only known references to the park are text; no photographs or diagrams of the park are known to exist. The American League of 1900 was a minor league, previously called the Western League. The first game at the park was held on May 6, 1900, with the Tigers losing to the Indianapolis Hoosiers 11-5.[Detroit Free Press, May 7, 1900, p.8] The American League declared itself a major league in 1901 and broke relations with the National League. On April 28, 1901, the first major league game was played at the ballpark in which the Tigers defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 12-11. With peace between the leagues for 1903, the Tigers were advised to abandon Burns Park as being in an unsavory part of town, by which time Burns had sold the club anyway, so Burns Park ceased being a host to professional baseball. The Tigers wrapped up their usage of Burns Park on September 7, 1902, with an 11-6 win over the Baltimore Orioles. In subsequent years they played a handful of Sunday \\"home\\" games in other cities, until finally securing permission to play Sunday ball at Bennett Park in August of 1907.

Throughout his career, Danj≈´r≈ç would hold some of the highest ranks in the hy≈çbanki, an annual Edo publications which evaluated actors and performances. At one point in 1782, he was even granted the rank of . He is depicted in countless ukiyo-e actor prints (yakusha-e), and unlike many actors who focus on one type of role, Danj≈´r≈ç excelled at many types of roles, playing heroes, villains, samurai, peasants, and beautiful women with equal skill. One of his most famous roles is that of the hero in Shibaraku, a scene contained within full plays. Names Like most kabuki actors, and many artists, of his time, Danj≈´r≈ç had a number of names. He was the fifth to be called Ichikawa Danj≈´r≈ç, and though not the first to be known as Ichikawa Ebiz≈ç, he used different kanji (characters) than his predecessors in writing the name. He was a member of the guilds Naritaya and K≈çraiya, and could be referred to by these names (see yag≈ç). Other names he used on stage include Ichikawa Hakuen I, Matsumoto K≈çshir≈ç III, Matsumoto K≈çz≈ç, Matsumoto Umimaru, and Naritaya Shichizaemon (I). In poetry circles, he often used the names Baid≈ç, Omegawa, Sansh≈ç, and Hakuen. Lineage He was the fifth in the line of Ichikawa Danj≈´r≈ç, his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather being the fourth, second, and first in the line respectively (his father and grandfather were also known as Ebiz≈ç II and III). He had a son, named Momotar≈ç, who died at a very young age, but Danj≈´r≈ç also adopted a son who would succeed him and become Ichikawa Danj≈´r≈ç VI. Danj≈´r≈ç VII and IX were his grandsons. Life and career The actor who would later be known as Ichikawa Danj≈´r≈ç V was born in Edo (now Tokyo) in August 1741, and appeared on stage for the first time at the age of four. His first role in a play was in 1754, at the age of thirteen, in Miura no ≈åsuke Bumon no Kotobuki at the Nakamura-za in Edo. Until 1770, his stage name was Matsumoto K≈çshir≈ç (III). In 1760, the Nakamura-za and Ichimura- za theaters were destroyed by a fire, called the Akashiya fire after the shop where it began, which claimed a fair portion of the city as well. K≈çshir≈ç aided in the reconstruction of the theaters, and performed at the Ichimura-za the following month. Like all Kabuki actors, K≈çshir≈ç would devote his life almost exclusively to the theater. By the age of 29, he had performed in at least 35 plays, quite possibly many more. In November 1770, K≈çshir≈ç, aged 29, took part in a grand naming ceremony (Ë•≤Âêç, sh≈´mei) at the Nakamura-za and took the name Ichikawa Danj≈´r≈ç. This was followed by a performance of Nue no Mori Ichiy≈ç no Mato, in which Danj≈´r≈ç would perform the lead role of Shibaraku for the first time. This role was nearly always played by a member of the Ichikawa Danj≈´r≈ç line, and it would become one of Danj≈´r≈ç V's most famous roles. The following year, Danj≈´r≈ç became the head (Â∫ßÈ†≠, zagashira) of the Morita-za troupe and left the Nakamura-za, where his father still performed. He would return to the Nakamura-za in 1773, but left it again the following year along with a number of other actors, returning once more to the Morita-za. Danj≈´r≈ç's son Momotar≈ç, born in 1768, died in 1776 at the age of eight. Danj≈´r≈ç began performing at the Ichimura-za, leaving the Morita-za again. At this point, according to the book Yakusha Sensakuron (ÂΩπËÄÖË©ÆÁ¥¢Ë´ñ, \\"About Actors Prying\\"), he was living in the town of Sakai in Sumiyoshi district, and earning 800 ry≈ç a year. August 1778 marks another major event in Danj≈´r≈ç's life, and in the kabuki world as a whole. As a result of Danj≈´r≈ç's growing influence among patrons and within other elements of the kabuki world had created enmities among a number of other actors. Accused of misappropriation of funds, Danj≈´r≈ç was forced to give up his name to another actor, Matsumoto K≈çshir≈ç IV, and to take on the name Ichikawa Ebiz≈ç for himself. After showing his anger on stage, and accusing Matsumoto K≈çshir≈ç IV and Iwai Hanshir≈ç IV in public of plotting against him, Danj≈´r≈ç was forced to leave the stage for a time. Though he returned to performing three months later at the Morita-za, Danj≈´r≈ç would not return to the Nakamura-za for a full year. In November 1779, he did so and became troupe head (zagashira). Seven years later, K≈çshir≈ç IV would join Danj≈´r≈ç in performing at the Kiri-za, and reconcile the dispute. Danj≈´r≈ç formally took on the name Ebiz≈ç at a ceremony at the Ichimura-za in 1791. However, in writing \\"Ebiz≈ç\\" he chose different kanji (characters) from those used by his father and grandfather. Ebiz≈ç had formerly been written as \\"Êµ∑ËÄÅËîµ\\", but the new Ebiz≈ç would instead use \\"È∞ïËîµ\\". Five years later, Ebiz≈ç announced his retirement; he was 55. He took on the name Naritaya Shichiemon and moved to a small hut on the tiny island of Ujishima, near Muk≈çjima. The following month, the hy≈çbanki would give his rank as sanga no tsu murui-dai-shigoku-j√¥- j√¥-kichi-murui (Â±±Ê≤≥„ÅÆÊ¥•ÁÑ°È°ûÂ§ßËá≥Ê•µ‰∏ä„ÄÖÂêâÁÑ°È°û, \\"Unequaled in the Three Capitals - grand - exceedingly - superior - superior - excellent). He returned to the stage shortly after the death of his adopted son, Ichikawa Danj≈´r≈ç VI, in 1799, taking on the name Ichikawa Hakuen. His definitively final performance, after countless performances in an incredible variety of roles and at a number of theaters, would be in March 1802, at the Kawarazaki-za. Ichikawa Hakuen died in October 1806, in his small hut on Muk≈çjima. He had many disciples, including Matsumoto K≈çshir≈ç IV, Ichikawa Omez≈ç I, Ichikawa Tatsuz≈ç I (Hanai Saizabur≈ç IV), Ichikawa Mitsuz≈ç (Nakamura Matsue II), Ichikawa Takiz≈ç, Ichikawa Hamaz≈ç, Ichikawa Tomiemon, and Ichikawa Kosanza.

It details Keladry of Mindelan's (Kel's) continuing quest for knighthood. Plot summary Squire tells the story of Keladry of Mindelan's years as a squire, between the ages of fourteen and eighteen. Having passed the \\"big examinations\\", Kel becomes a squire without a knight- master. While she becomes frustrated at waiting for offers from knights, her best friend, Nealan of Queenscove, becomes squire to Alanna the Lioness, the first lady knight in Tortall, and Kel's personal hero. While Kel is disappointed at not becoming the Lioness's squire, she shortly receives an equally prestigious offer from Lord Raoul of Goldenlake, commander of the elite King's Own and a personal friend to the Lioness. As Lord Raoul's squire, she travels with the King's Own and participates in routine duties ranging from chasing rogue centaurs to helping to rebuild villages afflicted by natural disasters such as mudslides. Along the way, Kel acquires a baby griffin from the bandits who kidnapped him from his parents' nest. Due to the high incidence of kidnapping immature griffins for their magical powers, griffin parents attack any human who has ever touched one of their offspring, so this task is not without its dangers. As knight-master, Raoul teaches Kel the fineries of command, and hones her proven skills in jousting, eventually entering her into tournaments where she jousts against other squires and knights. She jousts twice against Wyldon of Cavall, her previous training master, a political conservative who was initially vehemently opposed to Kel's training to be a knight. After the second time, she meets three girls, two of them sisters, who explain that they wish to train for knighthood as well. Kel gives them some advice, noting that the sisters appear serious about it while the third girl seems more like the type that jumps around from idea to idea. When a political marriage is arranged for Prince Roald, the heir apparent, the Yamani Princess he is betrothed to turns out to be Shinkokami (nicknamed Shinko), a friend from Kel's childhood years in the Yamani Islands; one of her ladies-in-waiting is Yukimi noh Daiomoru, another of Kel's old friends. Shinko's anxiety about her upcoming marriage, and the prospect of integrating into Tortallan society, become catalysts for the three to reforge their friendship as Kel introduces Shinko to various aspects of Tortallan culture. She also introduces Yuki to her squire friends, and she and Neal strike up a quick romance. Joren of Stone Mountain is found to be the noble who paid two men to kidnap Lalasa Isran, Kel's maid. He is, however, acquitted with a fine. Kel protests the unfairness of the law to the monarchs and gets them to attempt to change it. Princess Shinkokami's introduction to the subjects of Tortall provides an excuse for the Grand Progress, a progress of the royal family, nobility, and other notables. Against his wishes, Raoul joins the progress, with Kel in tow. This becomes a chance that lets Kel strike up a secret romance with Cleon of Kennan, and Raoul becomes involved with the commander of the Queen's Riders, Queen Thayet's former bodyguard and right- hand lady, Buriram Tourakom. Kel's second Midwinter as a squire sees her facing the ordeals of knighthoods of her older friends Prince Roald and Cleon of Kennan (who is at this point Kel's sweetheart). Their age group includes Joren of Stone Mountain, who dies in the Chamber, and Vinson of Genlith, who is punished by the Chamber for all the evil deeds he has done to women, namely by feeling every injury done to them. On the Midwinter after her eighteenth birthday, Kel is scheduled to undergo the Ordeal of Knighthood, a ritual that determines if a squire is worthy to become a knight. Of all her year-mates, her name is drawn for the last day of midwinter. Kel waits anxiously while all her friends pass their Ordeals, but her anxiety is disproven; she passes the Ordeal and receives her knight's shield after seeing a disturbing vision in the Chamber, as well as a sword from the Lioness, who had been anonymously sending her gifts of weapons and training equipment throughout her page and squire years.

There is no official release in English but a community supported English patch is available (based upon the open source ONScripter-EN visual novel engine). Story Kagetsu Tohya consists of \\"Twilight Glass Moon, Fairy Tale Princess\\", the long main story with many branches, and several shorter side stories that are unlocked one after another after related events in the main story have been read. Ten of these side stories are combined as \\"Ten Nights of Dream\\". Twilight Grass Moon, Fairy Tale Princess One year after the events of Tsukihime (presumably from the \\"Good Ending\\" of Arcueid path, as none of the characters are dead), half of July 2001, Shiki is a victim of an accident. After this accident, Shiki awakens into a strange dream wherein he repeats the same day over and over. There are infinitely many endings to the day, but it always begins anew after each day. Eventually, Shiki discovers that he must find Ren, the creator of the dream, if he wishes to escape. The gameplay is much more dynamic than in Tsukihime. It uses a vastly different system in which the player goes through each of Shiki's \\"days\\" in the dream. The number of choices presented to the player in Kagetsu Tohya is also significantly larger than in Tsukihime. Also, due to the plot structure, the timeframe of Kagetsu Tohya is not linear like Tsukihime, but circular; that is, after completing one \\"day\\" in Shiki's dream, your status is automatically saved and you have to play the same \\"day\\" again, but with different choices. The days do not progress; rather, every time a day is completed, what you have accomplished in that day is saved by the computer. Eventually, you will come across the ending for the game after accomplishing everything that comes before it. Ten Nights of Dream The first seven of these stories were written by Kinoko Nasu like the rest of Kagetsu Tohya, while the last three are contribution works by others, essentially fanfiction. It is unknown if any of these stories are to be considered canon. In fact, some are obviously NOT canon, such as Imogirisou and Ciel-Sensei. It is likely, however, that the background information is to be considered canon. (Such as Nanako-chan and Arihiko's pasts, along with the explanations for certain plot holes in Ciel-sensei, such as how Chaos and Arcueid got to Japan). ;Good luck, Ciel-sensei: Ciel teaches the rest of the cast in her role as Ciel-sensei from Tsukihime. The story is mainly a comedy story, reflecting on parts of the series in the form of questions. It also explains plotholes as well. ;A Story for the Evening: Akiha solves a mystery in her boarding school. This story is a sequel to her true ending in Tsukihime. An urban legend around school involves placing curses and an old mailbox. Tsukasa, another student at the school, placed a curse on Akiha but is afraid she'll find out, and attempts to kill Akiha by knocking her off two stories from the roof. Akiha survives due to her super-human abilities and Tsukasa comes in the night to kill her with a knife, but Akiha yet again survives and knocks out Tsukasa. By the end of the story, Akiha is informed that Ciel saved Shiki Tohno from death and that he'd return by the end of the year. Akiha dedicates herself to regrowing her black hair, which she shortened after a portion was cut by Tsukasa's knife. ;Crimson Moon: A look at Arcueid's history as a True Ancestor, and her first fateful meeting with Roa. This story has Roa as the protagonist and shows him in less of an antagonistic light. ;Red Demon God: The story of Shiki's father Kiri Nanaya. This story reveals much about the Nanaya family and the Demon Hunter's Association that they are connected with. Kiri Nanaya is at the end killed by Kishima Kouma, who is taking revenge for his parents deaths at the hands of Kiri Nanaya. ;Nanako-chan SOS: Nanako (the spirit of the Seventh Holy Scripture) escapes from Ciel and hides out at Arihiko's place. This story has Arihiko as the protagonist and reveals how he and Shiki met in the past. Ciel ends up taking Nanako back by the end of the story. ;Imogirisou: A parody of the horror game Otogiris≈ç starring Shiki, Akiha, Hisui and Kohaku. With a cameo by The Dead. ;Flower of Thanatos: Erotic story that takes place in an artificial dream world where Shiki, Kohaku and Hisui live in the isolated Tohno mansion. ;Hisui-chan, Inversion Impulse!:A Comedic story wherein Hisui undergoes the Inversion Impulse normally restricted to members of the Tohno family. Based on Hisui's Good Ending. ;The Tohno Family Con Game: Nearly the whole cast plays an elaborate game of tag for Kohaku's sake. Even the villains, major and minor take a part in it, with Kohaku using her assets and intelligence to win the game. ;Dawn: The continued story of the girl that gets devoured in the park by Nrvnqsr Chaos in Tsukihime. She also holds Nrvnqsr's Reality Marble, Lair of the Beast King, allowing her to use his animals. The first part of the story misleadingly leads the reader to believe they are Shiki Tohno, until Arcueid suspects that the protagonist isn't Shiki. The girl ends up dying at the hands of Shiki Tohno, unaware of anything other than her nature as a vampire. She dies happily in her sister's arms. This story was submitted by Maruyama Kugane, the author of the light novel series Overlord.Overlord Volume 1 Author Thoughts: Although there was a case of giving up the dream to be a novelist in my introductory published work, that is the adoption of my short story ‚ÄôDawn‚Äô in Kagetsu Tohya, Other stories ;Summer Festivals: Five short scenes in which Shiki takes either Arcueid, Ciel, Akiha, Hisui or Kohaku on a date to the summer festival. ;Drinking, Dreaming Moon: This hidden story, unlocked after all other content in the game has been viewed, has Shiki meeting his adoptive brother SHIKI and discussing their relationship on friendly terms. Characters Each of Tsukihime's characters, including Shiki, Akiha, Ciel, Arcueid, Kohaku, Hisui, Nrvnqsr Chaos, and others, make appearances in Kagetsu Tohya. While some of the following characters were briefly mentioned in Tsukihime, they appear with larger roles in Kagetsu Tohya: ;: Len is a former familiar under Arcueid's care, sometimes referred to as a succubus. She is not contracted to Arcueid, and is currently an independent existence. She can take the form of a pre-pubescent girl or a black cat. Her only appearance in Tsukihime is to grant Shiki a dream of a sexual encounter. ;: Akira is an underclassman of Akiha's. She has minor precognitive powers, and previously appeared on the Tsukihime PLUS-DISC. ;: Akiha's roommate at her private school. Rather punkish. Shiki thinks she's a guy. ;: Akiha's other roommate at her private school. Thinks slowly and strangely; conscientious, thorough and good at fixing things. ;: Another student at Akiha's school, appears in \\"A Story for the Evening\\". She is convinced she placed a curse on someone by mistake, or so she says. ;: The spirit of Ciel's most powerful weapon, Seventh Holy Scripture, who was offered as a willing sacrifice.

The film, produced in association with HBO Films, follows a terrorist attack on Central London where a \\"dirty bomb\\" is deployed. Principal cast members for the film include Louise Delamere, Alastair Galbraith, William El-Gardi, Martin Savage, Koel Purie, Helen Schlesinger, Ewan Stewart and Paul Antony-Barber. Following its broadcast in the UK, a live questions & answers session with the writers of the programme broadcast on BBC One at 22:50 GMT. In the United States, the film was made available on HBO on 24 January 2005, and the broadcast for the first time on PBS on 23 February 2005. The film was later released on DVD in the United States on October 6, 2005.https://www.amazon.com/Dirty-War-Murray- Corrigan/dp/B0007R4SXQ/ Percival later won a BAFTA Award for Best New Director for his work on the film. Production Percival was tasked with creating the film by BBC executives, whose outline for the project was \\"think about what the new generation of terrorism actually meant\\". Percival stated that \\"The challenge of Dirty War was to tell the story of the attack from the intimate perspective of several different characters. We want to get the messages of this film to the widest possible audience.\\" Mickery was asked if she would like to co-write the script. She said of her contribution; \\"I think drama has the capacity to touch more people. If you are caught up in the emotions of the characters involved - and not just the statistics - the effect it has on you will last longer and be more intimate. Dirty War's aim is to try to make sense of the situation we all face, to ask questions on our behalf, and most importantly, to move us.\\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/dirty_war/3654566.stm Plot Dirty War opens with a quote from Eliza Manningham-Buller, the then-Director General of MI5: \\"It will only be a matter of time before a crude chemical, biological, or radiological (CBRN) attack is launched on a major Western city\\". Dirty War follows the journey of radioactive material, hidden in vegetable oil containers, from Habiller, Turkey, approximately west of Istanbul, through Sofia, Bulgaria, onwards to Deptford, then to an East End Indian food takeaway restaurant, and finally to a rented house in Willesden, where the radioactive material and other components are assembled into a dirty bomb. When the bomb goes off in the heart of London, next to the entrance to Liverpool Street Underground station, the city's inadequate emergency services plans are put to an immediate test, with disturbing results for a population ill-prepared to understand or obey anti-contamination and quarantine orders. In addition to touching upon the motivations of the Islamic extremist terrorists to conduct what they saw as a martyrdom operation, the events are shown through the eyes of three principal groups: the government, the emergency medical services, and the police. Nicola Painswick (Helen Schlesinger), Minister for London, and Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Ives (Ewan Stewart) of the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch, present a governmental point of view. Watch Commander Murray Corrigan (Alastair Galbraith) of the London Fire Brigade and his wife Liz Corrigan (Louise Delamere), who works for the National Health Service, present the emergency services' story. Detective Sergeant Mike Drummer (Martin Savage) and Detective Constable Sameena Habibullah (Koel Purie) lead the police investigation to catch the terrorists, under the watchful eye of their boss, Commander Paul Hardwick (Paul Antony-Barber). DC Habibullah, an English Muslim policewoman from Luton, who speaks Urdu, Punjabi, and Arabic, presents a unique point of view throughout the film.

The seventh tropical storm and second hurricane of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season, Florence developed from a tropical wave in the eastern Atlantic Ocean on September 3\\\\. Due to unfavorable conditions, the system failed to organize initially, and as a result, the storm grew to an unusually large size. After several days, Florence encountered an area of lesser wind shear and intensified into a hurricane on September 10\\\\. It passed just west of Bermuda while recurving northeastward, and on September 13 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Florence produced wind gusts of up to 115 mph (185 km/h) on Bermuda, which caused several power outages and minor damage. Florence then brought heavy rains across Newfoundland as an extratropical storm, destroying one house and causing minor damage to several others. There were no fatalities as a result of the hurricane. history A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 29. It tracked slowly westward, and first showed signs of development two days later. On August 31, a second tropical wave exited the coast of Africa at a faster speed than its predecessor. The two waves interacted, and by September 2 combined to form a large area of disturbed weather across the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Convection increased within the system, and it developed a concentrated area of convection in conjunction with a well-defined low pressure area. By late on September 3, the system maintained a broad closed circulation and enough convective organization to be classified Tropical Depression Six while located about midway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression maintained multiple cloud swirls within a common center. Banding features increased, though southwesterly wind shear and the lack of a well-defined circulation prevented initial strengthening. Dry air encountered the depression, and as such it developed very slowly; forecasters maintained considerable difficulty in determining a center of circulation. It continued its motion to the west-northwest while tracking around the southern periphery of a deep-layer subtropical ridge to its north. Though convection remained focused near the outer periphery of the system, the overall organized continued to steadily increase, and it is estimated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Florence on September 5 while located about 1,120 miles (1,800 km) east-northeast of Anguilla. Florence after becoming an extratropical storm over the north Atlantic on September 14 After attaining tropical storm status, the maximum sustained winds fluctuated for three days between 40 mph (65 km/h) and 50 mph (85 km/h). This was due to the large size of Florence; the overall wind field reached a diameter of 460 miles (745 km), and the radius of maximum winds reached about 110 miles (170 km). By September 6, a well-defined cloud swirl became evident, with thin rainbands developing in the southeast and northwest quadrants. As a result, hurricane forecasters anticipated Florence would develop significantly and attain major hurricane status. Though convection gradually migrated closer to the center of the storm, forecasters could not detect a well-defined center of circulation by late on September 6. On September 7, convection developed over and to the west of the center for the first time in its duration. However, Florence failed to intensify further, as its wind field had increased to more than 1,035 miles (1,670 km) in diameter. This led to difficulties in forecasting, as its environment favored further strengthening; the storm tracked through an area of 84¬∞ F (29¬∞ C) water temperatures and light shear, and the system maintained a large low-level cyclonic envelop with abundant convection. By early on September 8, the storm consisted of an elongated, shapeless cloud pattern atypical of a tropical cyclone. Later that day, as an anticyclone developed over Florence, the storm began to consolidate around a vorticity center on the western side of the large cyclonic envelope. It began to strengthen more steadily as it turned to the northwest. Early on September 10, an eye began developing within a round central dense overcast over the center, and shortly thereafter Florence attained hurricane status while located about 390 miles (630 km) south of Bermuda. Hurricane Florence turned to the north and north- northeast through a break in the subtropical ridge. Though its eyewall was open on the north side, favorable conditions led forecasters to predict Florence passing near Bermuda as a strong Category 2 hurricane. The inner core of convection became ragged-looking on satellite imagery, and based on reports from Hurricane Hunters it is estimated the hurricane attained peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) late on September 10. Subsequent to further erosion of the eyewall, the hurricane weakened, and on September 11 passed about 60 miles (95 km) west of Bermuda with winds of 85 mph (135 km/h). The overall cloud pattern became slightly better organized, and Florence briefly re-strengthened before encountering increased upper-level winds and cooler waters. Dry air wrapping around the southern periphery of the cyclone eroded most of the deep convection by early on September 12. The cloud shield became asymmetrically displaced to the north of the center, and frontal-like features began to form. It continued to lose tropical characteristics, and on September 13 Florence transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about 485 miles (780 km) south- southwest of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Initially maintaining hurricane-force winds, the extratropical remnant passed near Cape Race before turning to the east-northeast, and on September 14 the winds weakened to gale force. The storm executed a broad cyclonic half-loop to the southwest of Iceland over the subsequent days, and after turning to the west the extratropical remnants of Florence were absorbed to the east of Greenland by a developing extratropical cyclone to its south. Preparations Hurricane Florence over Bermuda on September 11 The government of Bermuda issued a hurricane watch for the island on September 8, which was followed by a tropical storm warning on September 9. These were replaced by a hurricane warning on September 10, coinciding with the storm's strengthening to hurricane intensity. The government urged the potentially impacted citizens to take preparations for the storm, many of whom bought supplies at local hardware stores. Residents installed storm shutters, while boat owners moved their yachts to safer locations. An emergency shelter was prepared on the island. Prior to the arrival of the storm, officials canceled bus and ferry service, and also closed all schools and government offices on the day of impact. The Bermuda International Airport was also closed. Impact Rainfall totals for Florence in Newfoundland (in metric units) Imperial units Hurricane Florence produced strong swells and dangerous surf conditions along the northern Lesser Antilles, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Bermuda. Later in its duration, the tight pressure gradient between Florence and a high-pressure system over southeastern Canada produced strong winds and rough waves along the East Coast of the United States. The hurricane also caused strong swells and rough ocean conditions, including rip currents, in the Bahamas and Atlantic Canada. In South Carolina, high waves produced severe beach erosion on several beaches. Passing a short distance west of Bermuda, Hurricane Florence produced strong winds on the island; sustained winds peaked at 82 mph (132 km/h) on St. David's Island at an elevation of 157 feet (48 m), while gusts reached 115 mph (185 km/h) at the Maritime Operations Centre in St. George's Parish at an elevation of 256 feet (78 m). The winds knocked down trees and power lines, leaving over 25,000 homes and businesses without electricity during the peak of the storm. The powerful winds damaged ten houses, including destroying the roofs of three, and blew out windows across the island. A few people were injured by flying glass, though none required hospital care. Rainfall on the island reached 1.32 inches (34 mm) at the Bermuda International Airport. A possible tornado in Southampton Parish downed trees and caused light property damage. At the Bermuda Zoo and Aquarium, two flamingos died due to falling branches. During the peak of the storm, police officials advised citizens to remain indoors away from harm, though there were several reports of looting throughout the territory. On the island, the storm's damage totaled over $200,000 (2006 USD). Shortly after the storm passed through, BELCO began restoring power, and by six hours after the peak of the storm power had been restored to 7,000 homes and businesses. By the day after the storm, about 3,000 remained without electricity on the island. The storm damaged the causeway between St. David's Island and Hamilton Parish, temporarily limiting traffic to one lane in each direction. As an extratropical storm over Newfoundland, Florence produced powerful winds peaking at 101 mph (163 km/h) and moderate amounts of rainfall of up to 2.6 inches (67 mm). Flooding and power outages were reported, although they were isolated. The hurricane caused flight interruptions at St. John's International Airport and also to the Trans Canada ferry between Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island in eastern Nova Scotia. Strong winds destroyed a house in the small Newfoundland village of Francois. Residents in Francois agreed to rebuild the wrecked home while the family temporarily resided in a summer home of another family. The winds also caused damage to shingles and sides of homes, while the strong waves damaged roads and boats along the Burin Peninsula.

O'Neill started his playing career in his native Northern Ireland with Coleraine, before playing for a number of clubs in England, Scotland and the United States, including Newcastle United, Dundee United, Hibernian, Wigan Athletic and Portland Timbers. He was capped 31 times at international level by Northern Ireland, scoring four goals. His first managerial role was with Brechin City from 2006 to 2008. He then joined Shamrock Rovers, where he won two League of Ireland titles and the Setanta Cup. He became Northern Ireland manager in 2011 and, under his management, they qualified for their first ever European Champions finals in 2016. In November 2019 O'Neill was appointed manager at Stoke City. Early life Michael O'Neill was born on 5 July 1969 in Portadown, County Armagh, to parents Des and Patricia O'Neill. Raised Catholic, he briefly attended Presentation Convent Primary School before the family moved to Ballymena, County Antrim. In Ballymena he attended All Saints Primary School and later St Louis Grammar School, Ballymena, where he won the Northern Ireland Schools FA Cup. He was also a promising Gaelic games player, representing Antrim GAA minors, before concentrating on football. He played youth football for Ballymena team Star United for four years before joining intermediate club Chimney Corner. Playing career Club O'Neill began his senior career with Coleraine, making his debut in the Irish League at the age of 15. After playing against Dundee United in a UEFA Cup tie in 1987 O'Neill came close to joining the Scottish club. In October 1987 he was signed by Newcastle United for a ¬£100,000 fee. After scoring 13 goals in 22 appearances during his first season and helping Newcastle finish eighth in the First Division, O'Neill suffered from injuries and loss of form in his second season which saw Newcastle relegated. O'Neill joined Dundee United in August 1989 for a club record fee of ¬£350,000. A difficult relationship with manager Jim McLean came to a head in 1991 when O'Neill refused to extend his contract and was dropped from the first team. He left the club in 1993 joining Hibernian where he had three successful seasons under the management of Alex Miller. O'Neill agreed to join Austrian club Sturm Graz on a Bosman free transfer in 1996 but changed his mind after an offer to return to English football with Coventry City where he spent just over two years. After spending time on loan to Aberdeen and Reading during the 1997‚Äì98 season O'Neill left Coventry to sign for Wigan Athletic in September 1998. He later played for St Johnstone, Portland Timbers, Clydebank, Glentoran and Ayr United. International He played for the under-21, under-23, B and full international teams of Northern Ireland. He scored four goals for the national team, including two in a 5‚Äì3 win against Austria. Coaching career O'Neill retired from playing football in 2004 and began a career in financial services. A year later he took a part- time role as assistant manager at Cowdenbeath, working with Mixu Paatelainen. Brechin City O'Neill became manager of Scottish side Brechin City in April 2006. He won the Second Division Manager of the Month award in both December 2007 and October 2008. O'Neill was released by Brechin City to join Shamrock Rovers on 13 December 2008.Managerial Statement, Brechin City, 13 December 2008. Shamrock Rovers At the press conference when unveiled as Rovers manager, he cited Gordon Strachan as his main managerial influence. He was awarded the Irish Soccer Writers Manager of the Month award for July 2009 and eventually guided The Hoops to second place in the 2009 League of Ireland. In October 2010, he guided Shamrock Rovers to win the 2010 League of Ireland title, their first league championship since 1994. O'Neill led Rovers to the 2011 Setanta Sports Cup and then made history by being the first manager of a League of Ireland team to reach the group stages of a European competition. Rovers defeated Partizan Belgrade in the play-off round of the 2011‚Äì12 UEFA Europa League. Shamrock Rovers retained their league title in the 2011 season. New contract talks between O'Neill and Shamrock Rovers stalled and he left the club in December 2011. O'Neill won the Soccer Writers Association Personality of the Year award for 2011. Northern Ireland O'Neill was appointed manager of Northern Ireland on 28 December 2011, with one report stating he was \\"the first Catholic in 50 years to manage Northern Ireland\\". However, this is almost certainly untrue, since previous managers Lawrie Sanchez (2004‚Äì07) and Lawrie McMenemy (1998‚Äì99) were both educated in Roman Catholic schools. O'Neill's first game in charge ended in defeat with a 3‚Äì0 loss to Norway. In his next game an inexperienced Northern Ireland team were beaten 6‚Äì0 by the Netherlands in Amsterdam. During their 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, Northern Ireland earned some creditable results, including a 1‚Äì1 draw away to Portugal and a 1‚Äì0 home win against Russia. In November 2013, O'Neill agreed a new two-year deal with Irish Football Association to remain as Northern Ireland manager. Northern Ireland qualified for their first ever European Championship, Euro 2016 in France after beating Greece 3‚Äì1 at Windsor Park on 8 October 2015. It was the first time in 30 years that Northern Ireland had qualified for a major tournament. At the tournament itself he led the side to the second round, losing narrowly to Wales but recorded a surprise victory over Ukraine in the group stages. In January 2018, O'Neill turned down an offer to become manager of Scotland following discussions with the Scottish Football Association. O'Neill initially continued as Northern Ireland manager after his appointment by Stoke City in November 2019. He had intended to stay on for UEFA Euro 2020 playoffs, which had been scheduled for March 2020, but these were postponed by the COVID-19 pandemic. With the Euro 2020 playoffs delayed at least until the autumn of 2020, O'Neill resigned as Northern Ireland manager on 22 April. Stoke City O'Neill was appointed manager of EFL Championship club Stoke City on 8 November 2019. He joined Stoke with the side bottom of the 2019-20 EFL Championship table after struggling under the management of Nathan Jones. O'Neill won his first match in charge of Stoke, 4‚Äì2 away at Barnsley on 9 November. Under O'Neill Stoke began to improve and secured vital victories over Wigan Athletic, Luton Town, Sheffield Wednesday and Huddersfield Town, helping the team move out of the relegation zone at the turn of the year. In the January transfer window O'Neill cancelled the loans of Cameron Carter-Vickers, Mark Duffy and Scott Hogan, whilst also letting Peter Etebo, Badou Ndiaye and Ryan Woods leave on loan. Into the team came Northern Irish midfielder Jordan Thompson from Blackpool, center-back James Chester on loan from Aston Villa and young midfielder Tashan Oakley-Boothe from Tottenham Hotspur. Stoke beat Hull City 5‚Äì1 on 7 March 2020 moving the team three points above the drop with nine remaining matches. The Championship was suspended on 13 March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Championship squads returned to training on 25 May with the intention to finish the season behind closed doors. Stoke's preparations for the season restart were disrupted after O'Neill tested positive for coronavirus on 9 June which caused a training match against Manchester United to be cancelled. Stoke won four of the remaining nine matches to avoid relegation and finish in 15th position, finishing eight points clear of the relegation zone.

Climate  In spite of its temperate latitude, the powerful Oyashio Current on the western flank of the Aleutian Low gives Lopatka a chilly and very wet polar climate that borders extremely closely on subarctic climate (K√∂ppen Dfc/ET), for which is just qualifies due to its August means, which in low-lying areas would be expected only at latitudes about 20 degrees or further north. Unlike typical polar climates, however, the winters are only moderately severe and there is no permafrost since the mean annual temperature is around , whilst temperatures have never fallen below . However, the extreme winds make it feel much colder. Summers are mild, but extraordinarily cloudy with annual sunshine hours about 1,050 per year, which is comparable to Reykjav√≠k or the extremely foggy Sichuan Basin.

It was the winner of the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel in 1989. Plot summary Shortly after the end of the Iranian Hostage Crisis, the newspaper Stars and Stripes publishes an article chronicling a series of brutal, ritualistic murders in Far East Asia. All of the victims have had their eyes and ears removed, and each was found with a playing card slipped into his or her mouth with the word \\"KOKO\\" written on it. Shortly thereafter, a reunion of Vietnam War veterans is held at the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington DC. Four survivors of a doomed platoon‚ÄîMichael Poole (a pediatrician plagued by grief over the death of his young son from cancer and ambivalence about his marriage), Tina Pumo (owner of a Vietnamese restaurant), Conor Linklater (a journeyman construction worker) and Harry Beevers (an opportunistic lawyer)‚Äîgather to discuss the Koko killings. Because the word \\"Koko\\" holds special significance to the members of their platoon, and because the killings recall the events in a series of books he wrote, the men believe that the killer is Tim Underhill, another member of their platoon who disappeared years earlier in southeast Asia. Beevers convinces the men to help him track down Underhill, hoping that later they can sell the story of their adventure to the news media and become millionaires. While Pumo remains in New York to finish work on his soon-to-be-reopened restaurant, Beevers, Poole, and Linklater travel to Asia in search of Underhill, while the killer travels to America to continue his killing spree, which is meant to atone for an atrocity committed by Beevers and other members of the platoon years earlier, during the war. Much of the plot is interspersed with flashbacks to the four friends' time in Vietnam. Harry Beevers, the lieutenant of the group, was forceful and merciless. Tina, Conor, and Michael were soldiers in his platoon, along with several other men, most notably Victor Spitalny, a foul-tempered and arrogant young man, and M.O. Dengler, a philosophical and thoughtful man from a small town. After Vietnam, it was said that, while Dengler and Spitalny were traveling together in Bangkok, Dengler was brutally murdered in an alleyway while Spitalny fled the scene. Spitalny has not been accounted for since then (fifteen years before the platoon's trip to Singapore). Michael, Conor, and Harry fail to find Underhill in Singapore, but are given several leads while milling around sketchy clubs in the heart of the city that lead Michael and Conor to Bangkok and Harry to Taipei. While Conor searches the darker side of Bangkok, Michael wanders the flower market and residential areas of Bangkok. Before he does so, he visits the scene of Dengler's death, among other landmarks, but his search turns up fruitless. However, while wandering aimlessly around the city, thinking of his wife Judy and the strained relationship between the two of them, he sees an elephant, which delights him, and very soon afterwards finds Underhill at a small neighborhood fair. Upon meeting him, Michael realizes that Underhill couldn't possibly be Koko. His personality and state of mind are far too stable for vicious homicides. Michael convinces Underhill to return to America and help them find Koko. It is agreed that Underhill will accompany Michael and Conor on the flight to San Francisco where they meet with Harry and return to New York together. Meanwhile, back in America, Tina Pumo is murdered by Koko in his apartment. Tina's girlfriend, an attractive young Chinese woman named Maggie Lah, comes to visit him shortly thereafter. Maggie realises something is wrong on arriving at Tina's apartment, as the front door has been left open, and enters the apartment trying not to attract notice. Koko realises she has entered but is not sure of her whereabouts. Koko attempts to lure Maggie into exposing herself to him & gives his position away in the process. Maggie smashes an empty plant pot on Koko's head and knocks him briefly to the floor. This gains Maggie the few precious seconds she needs to escape, and she runs off. She is pursued, but the small lead she has is enough, and she makes it to safety. Michael, Conor, Beevers, Underhill, and Maggie mourn Tina's death, though Maggie does not attend the funeral, as she's worried about what Tina's relatives will say about her position in his life. The five get together and deduce that the murderer is, in fact, Victor Spitalny, having seen such horrors in the war that he has snapped and gone on a murderous rampage. Underhill and Beevers stay at Beevers' house and man the phones in case Koko calls. Michael, Maggie, and Underhill travel to Milwaukee, where Spitalny's parents live, and speak with the two of them. They do not trust the father, George Spitalny, and Maggie develops a hatred towards him. Conor returns home and develops a relationship with the niece of a man he works with, a woman named Ellen Woyzak. Beevers posts many fliers around town, each of them displaying a coded message only understandable by Koko, telling him to meet Beevers at a park in the center of town a few days later. In Milwaukee, the trio find out that Dengler and Spitalny went to the same school together, and speak to several of Spitalny's old classmates. None have anything particularly odd to say about Spitalny, though Michael agrees to meet one of them for lunch the next day and another for drinks that evening. Out of curiosity, Michael, Underhill, and Maggie go to see Dengler's mother. She turns out to be a religious maniac who taught M.O. Dengler a twisted version of Christianity, along with her husband, who is now deceased. When Michael meets Dengler's classmate for drinks, the man tells him that Dengler's parents had violently abused him several times to correct any errors he might have made. Furthermore, Dengler's father had been arrested and put in prison (and gruesomely murdered two years later by another prisoner) for sexually assaulting Dengler, beginning when he was five or six. Underhill learns the same information at the library, as well as the fact the Karl Dengler is Manny Dengler's real father (where Mrs. Dengler is not his real mother). Michael is shocked by the news and returns with Maggie and Underhill to New York, Michael and Maggie beginning a relationship before the journey. Conor and Ellen are waiting fervently for them at the airport, where Underhill is arrested because Harry Beevers had made an anonymous call to police so he could get Michael and Underhill out of the way and capture Koko alone. It is revealed that Koko has been telling people that his name is Underhill, thus framing Underhill for any murders he may have committed. Michael explains this to Murphy, the policeman who arrested Underhill, and reveals that Koko is not Spitalny as they had thought, but M.O. Dengler, their beloved comrade. Dengler killed Spitalny, switched dog-tags, and had a mob destroy his face and body. Murphy scolds the group for not telling the police of their findings before letting them go. Meanwhile, Harry Beevers decides to trap Koko in a killing box and hides in an arcade in Chinatown. He moves down a flight of stairs, a knife in one pocket and a pair of handcuffs in the opposite pocket. He hears something in the darkness and reaches for his knife. Beevers then remembers, belatedly, that the knife had fallen through a hole in his coat pocket earlier on that day, and he transferred it to the same pocket as the handcuffs, to make it easier to find. Koko seizes him and draws him into the darkness beneath the stairs. Michael, Maggie, Underhill, Conor, and Ellen travel quickly to where they think Beevers met Koko‚Äîa cave-like arcade in Chinatown. Murphy and his squad of police trail them. They are unaware of the policemen's presence until Underhill alerts Michael to the sight of them. Michael and the group flee in different directions down a deserted street by the arcade. Underhill and Maggie alert Michael after finding a bloody knife on a lower level of a tenement building that they were hiding in. Michael, Conor, and Underhill find Beevers tied up, gagged, and injured. Koko/Dengler is nearby, and smashes a lightbulb, throwing the group into darkness. The policemen catch up with them and negotiate with Koko to release the four men. Koko/Dengler stabs Michael in the side and does the same to Underhill, however he gags Underhill and steals his jacket so that he could be easily mistaken for Underhill himself in the dim light. After Michael alerts the police that the small man in the coat is not Underhill, Koko/Dengler murders one of the officers and escapes. In the aftermath, Koko/Dengler travels to Honduras and is never heard from again. Michael, Underhill, Maggie, Conor, and Ellen all survive, however Beevers commits suicide six months after the scene in the basement, having no purpose in his life and no more illusions of grandeur to hold on to. Two years later, Michael and Maggie are together and live in a loft above Tina Pumo's old loft, where Underhill lives with Vinh and his daughter. Underhill narrates the end of the story, and imagines Koko's first few days in Honduras and the constant anxiety that would come with them.

The densely populated village is one of Wrexham's largest and is situated in the north western suburbs of the town, bordering the nearby villages of Llay, Cefn-y- Bedd, Brynteg, and Pentre Broughton. The community, also including the villages of Summerhill, Sydallt, Rhosrobin and Bradley, had a total population of 10,056 at the 2001 census,Gwersyllt Community, Office for National Statistics rising to 10,677 at the 2011 Census. The name is usually stated to be derived from the Welsh word, gwersyll, meaning \\"campsite\\", with the final t common in the area's dialect.Palmer, A. N. A History of Ancient Tenures of Land in North Wales and the Marches, 1910, p.127 This is, however, a comparatively modern form, and during the mediaeval period the name was written as \\"Wershull\\" or \\"Wersull\\", with \\"Gwershull\\" and \\"Wersham\\" occurring in the 16th century. It is therefore possible that the present name, like others in the area, is a Welsh adaptation of an earlier English name ending in \\"-hull\\" (i.e. \\"hill\\"). A derivation from the genitive singular of Old English wearga, with the meaning \\"[the] felon's hill\\", \\"gallowstree hill\\", has been suggested by placename scholar Melville Richards,Archaeologia Cambrensis, v. CXII, 1964, p.161 although an original form of Wersiges-hyll from an Old English personal name has also been suggested.Nomina, v.XI, 1987, p.104 History Gwersyllt was originally a township of the parish of Gresford, and by 1833 had 834 inhabitants.Gwersyllt, Holy Trinity, GENUKI The gradual increase of the area's population in the industrial era led to Gwersyllt being formed as a new parish in 1851, combining the old township of Gwersyllt and parts of the neighbouring township of Stansty. The parish church, from plans by Thomas Penson, was consecrated at the same time.Gwersyllt, Holy Trinity , Church Plans Online The village grew rapidly with the local coal mining industry and the area was home to several collieries, of which many features still remain. In 1896, the Gwersyllt coal mine owned by Edward Griffiths had 185 employees with 167 below ground. It was in operation by 1881. The area was situated between the collieries of the Moss Valley and Bradley and benefitted from good rail links on the former Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway to Wrexham, Birkenhead, Ellesmere, Brymbo and New Brighton. A canal also was planned to run through the community with the intention of forming part of the Ellesmere Canal. Evidence of the canal cuttings can still be seen alongside the Sydallt junction between the Summerhill Bottom Road and A541 Mold Road, and a local street, named Heol-y-Camlas, meaning Canal Road in Welsh, lies on the former canal alignment. In the mid-20th century, large council estates were built amongst the existing village, extending the size of the community and its services substantially. Governance Prior to 1974, the civil parish of Gwersyllt fell into the County of Denbighshire and the Wrexham Rural District (however some areas in Gwersyllt were moved to Wrexham Borough in the 20th Century). In 1974, the civil parish became a community of the Borough of Wrexham Maelor, in the County of Clwyd. Since further reorganisation in 1996, the community has been part of the County Borough of Wrexham and the wider preserved county of Clwyd. Gwersyllt Community Council covers a wider area, including Summerhill, Bradley, Rhosrobin, Moss, Parkwall and Sydallt. For local government purposes, the Community is split into three subdivisions; Gwersyllt North, Gwersyllt West and Gwersyllt East & South. Facilities Leisure and lifestyle A number of leisure and lifestyle facilities are available for local residents. Gwyn Evans Sports Centre, named after a local councillor and school teacher, is a council-operated leisure centre, consisting of a 25-metre swimming pool and multi-use sports hall, within the grounds of local secondary school, Ysgol Bryn Alyn. The school additionally offers an outdoor astroturf multi-use games area, situated adjacent to the leisure centre. The newly built Gwersyllt Community Resource Centre provides a large bookable function hall and meeting rooms, along with Gwersyllt Library, which is open six days a week. A number of public houses have been central to the area, including The Wheatsheaf and Gwersyllt Working Men's Club, along with those in the wider Gwersyllt Community in Summerhill, Bradley and Gresford. Religion Gwersyllt is predominately served by two churches, namely Gwersyllt Congregational Church of the evangelical faith, and Holy Trinity Church, which is part of the Church in Wales Anglican denomination. Both date from the Victorian era, with the Congregational Church being the older of the two. Supplies Gwersyllt's largest shopping centre is known locally as the Kwik Save Centre, an outdoor precinct formally headed by the Kwik Save supermarket chain. Today it consists of Home Bargains, Iceland and a number of local retailers. German discount supermarket Lidl also operates a store adjacent to Gwersyllt railway station, along with a number of locally owned shops, food outlets and hairdressers around the community. Education Gwersyllt has four school within the community borders: Gwersyllt County Primary School, Ysgol Heulfan, Ysgol Bro Alun, and Ysgol Bryn Alyn. Gwersyllt CP and Ysgol Heulfan are both English-medium primary schools. Gwesyllt CP was created in 2007 by the amalgamation of Ysgol y Gaer Infant School with Gwersyllt County Primary Junior School, and Ysgol Heulfan was created in 2005 by the merger of Ysgol Bryn Golau Infants, Ysgol Y Drindod Juniors and Ysgol Powys. Ysgol Bro Alun is a Welsh-medium primary school which opened in 2013. Ysgol Bryn Alyn is an 11-16 English-medium secondary school. Post-16 education is provided by Coleg Cambria, formerly Yale College, Wrexham. Welsh-medium pupils from Gwersyllt attend Wrexham's 11-18 secondary school, Ysgol Morgan Llwyd. A centre for alternative curriculum programmes continues in the former building of Ysgol Powys. Health Pen-y-Maes Health Centre is the local clinic, being staffed by doctors, nurses and regular health visitors, and also incorporates a pharmacy. Women in the Gwersyllt West ward had the lowest life expectancy at birth, 72.6 years, of any ward in England and Wales in 2016. Industry Gwersyllt's former heavy industries of coalmining and manufacturing have declined over the 20th Century. Much of the former land of these industries has been reclaimed, mostly as housing. However a number of industrial warehouses continue, namely of building supplies, car sales and double-glazing window manufacturing. The Studios is the headquarters of the former Marcher Radio Group, which produces and broadcasts radio programmes to the local Capital FM stations, formally Marcher Sound, Buzz 97.1, Coast 96.3, Champion FM 103, along with Smooth Wales (formerly Classic Gold). Transport Gwersyllt railway station The A541 road, locally known as the Mold Road is the main thoroughfare into Wrexham southbound, and northwards through south Flintshire onto Mold. The community is also nearby to the A483 road via the Gresford and Wrexham junctions. Gwersyllt railway station provides hourly services by rail on the Borderlands Line, southbound to Wrexham Central, and northbound onto Bidston, changing for Merseyrail services to Liverpool Central. All services are operated by Transport for Wales, predominately using Class 150 and Class 153 diesel multiple units. Public bus transport is provided by Arriva Buses Wales on services from Wrexham to Summerhill, Mold, Flint and Deeside on Monday to Saturdays. A reduced service operates on Sundays and bank holidays, subsidised by Wrexham Council and provided by Arriva.

The work was intended to be a grand opera, in the style of Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, but was never completed, as Sibelius became disenchanted with Wagner's compositional techniques. History Sibelius was of the generation of composers whose works modeled late 19th- century compositional methods. Like others, he had a great appreciation for Wagner. Inspired by Wagner, Sibelius thought of himself as an operatic composer and thought that operas would be the focus of his career. He systematically studied the scores of Wagner's operas Tannh√§user, Lohengrin, and Die Walk√ºre. He also attended a performance of Parsifal, which greatly affected him. Sibelius then began work on his opera, entitling it Veneen luominen (The Building of the Boat). Shortly thereafter, his enthusiasm for Wagner plummeted and he forcefully rejected Wagner's techniques of composition, feeling that they were too mechanical and stilted. The Swan of Tuonela ‚Äì now a popular concert item ‚Äì was to be the work's Prelude. As he had lost interest in the composition of opera, the musical material from the incomplete Veneen luominen was eventually used for the Lemmink√§inen Suite (1896), and the tone poem The Wood Nymph (1895).

It is publicly traded as a \\"paired share\\" with ESH Hospitality, Inc., a real estate investment trust and the owner of the hotels. As of December 31, 2019, the company owned and operated 557 hotel properties consisting of approximately 61,900 rooms and franchised or managed 73 hotel properties consisting of approximately 7,500 rooms. History Extended Stay America was founded on January 9, 1995 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida by George D. Johnson, Jr. and Wayne Huizenga, both former executives from Viacom and its subsidiary Blockbuster LLC. The first two Extended Stay America hotels opened in August 1995 in Spartanburg, South Carolina and Marietta, Georgia. The company became a public company via an initial public offering on December 14, 1995. Extended Stay America acquired the extended-stay hotel chain StudioPLUS on April 11, 1997. The company also developed the Crossland Economy Studios brand as a budget extended-stay hotel brand. In 2013, the company moved its headquarters from Spartanburg, South Carolina to Charlotte, North Carolina. The Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, acquired Extended Stay America in May 2004 for US$3.1 billion in cash and debt. At the time of the merger, Extended Stay America operated 475 hotels; Blackstone increased that number with the addition of 132 from Homestead Studio Suites. Homestead, which was founded by Security Capital in 1992, had been acquired by Blackstone in November 2001 for US$740 million. All of Blackstone's extended-stay hotels consisting of the Crossland, Extended Stay America, Homestead, StudioPlus, and, eventually, Extended Stay Deluxe brands were managed together by Extended Stay Hotels. In June 2007, Blackstone sold Extended Stay Hotels to the Lightstone Group for US$8 billion. The deal, financed with US$7 billion of debt, was one of several multibillion-dollar hotel and casino sales made that year. The Great Recession decimated leisure and business travel and Extended Stay faced shortages in liquidity stemming from the leveraged buyout by Lightstone. On June 15, 2009, Extended Stay America filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. Through debtor-in-possession financing, it was able to continue operating rather than to face liquidation. In July 2010, an investment consortium made up of Blackstone, Paulson & Co., and Centerbridge Partners bought Extended Stay America through a bankruptcy auction for US$3.93 billion. After its successful reorganization, Extended Stay America emerged from bankruptcy in October 2010. A year after the bankruptcy, Blackstone was sued by creditors of Extended Stay America alleging that Blackstone \\"skimmed\\" US$2.1 billion off of the sale to Lightstone and knew that the amount of debt would have been unsustainable for the hotel chain; Blackstone settled the lawsuit in June 2013 for US$10 million. In April 2020, The Blackstone Group acquired an 4.9% stake in the company and Starwood Capital Group acquired an 8.5% stake in the company. References * .

It is one of the most venerated icons in the Upper Volga region. Her feast days are March 14 (27) and August 29.  Church lore  Since the Feodorovskaya follows the same Byzantine Eleusa (Tender Mercy) type as the Theotokos of Vladimir, pious legends declared it a copy of that famous image, purportedly created by Saint Luke. In Greek, Theotokos means \\"God-bearer\\". It is believed that, before the Mongol invasion of Rus, the icon was kept in a monastery near the town of Gorodets-on-the-Volga. After the Mongols sacked and burnt the town, the icon disappeared and was given up for lost.\\"Feodorovskaya-Kostroma icon of the Mother of God\\", Transfiguration of Our Lord Russian Orthodox Church, Baltimore, Maryland Several months later, on 16 August 1239, Prince Vasily of Kostroma wandered while hunting in a forest. While trying to find his way out of a thicket, he saw an icon concealed among fir branches. When he reached out to touch it, the icon mysteriously rose up in the air. The awestruck prince informed the citizens of Kostroma about the miracle he had witnessed and returned with a crowd of people to the forest. They fell prostrate before the icon and prayed to the Theotokos. They carried the icon to the city and placed it in the Assumption Cathedral. A conflagration destroyed the cathedral and most of its icons soon thereafter, but the Feodorovskaya was found intact on the third day after the fire.For a complete list of the icon's purported miracles, see –°—ã—Ä—Ü–æ–≤ –í.–ê. –°–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–∏–µ –æ –§–µ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–π –ß—É–¥–æ—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–Ω–æ–π –∏–∫–æ–Ω–µ –ë–æ–∂–∏–µ–π –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏, —á—Ç–æ –≤ –≥. –ö–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–º–µ. Kostroma, 1908. The people of Gorodets, at a distance to the east from Kostroma, learned about the miracle of the survival of the icon in the fire. They recognized the newly found icon as the one that used to be in their church. Church legends differ as to why the icon was named after Saint Theodore Stratelates (, Feodor Stratilat), not to be confused with Theodore Tyro). One explanation is that, during Vasily's absence in the forest, several residents of Kostroma claimed to have seen an apparition of Saint Theodore come up to the city with an icon in his hands.  A wedding gift?  16th-century Epiphany Monastery in Kostroma, where the icon is on exhibit today Since the icon was overpainted several times during its history, by the time of the Russian Revolution of 1917, the image had nearly disappeared. Art historians disagree about when and where the icon was created. Some propose an early 11th-century date; others date it as late as the turn of the 14th century.See –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–∞, —Ç–æ–º 1.

On the reverse side of the Feodorovskaya is an image representing Saint Paraskeva, a saint whose veneration started in the Novgorod Republic at the turn of the 13th century. Scholars believe that the image of Saint Paraskeva is contemporaneous with the image of the Theotokos on the other side. This dating seems to confirm the Novgorodian origin of the icon, as it was only in the 15th century that the veneration of Saint Paraskeva spread to other parts of the country. The saint's noble dress may indicate that the icon was intended as a wedding gift to a princess whose patron saint was Saint Paraskeva. According to Vasily Tatishchev, the only such princess known in the Rurikid family was Alexandra of Polotsk, the wife of Saint Alexander Nevsky of Novgorod. The feast day of St. Alexandra coincides with that of Saint Paraskeva (20 March). In the Rurikid family, it was customary for a groom to present his bride an icon representing her patron saint.For instance, Boris of Volokolamsk (Ivan III's brother) presented to his bride, Princess Uliana Kholmskaya, an icon of St. Barbara, who was a likely patron-saint of the princess.

Moscow, 1976. Maslenitsyn also argues that Yaroslav endowed the church of St. Theodore Stratelates in Kostroma. His Christian name was Feodor () and his patron saint was Theodore Stratelates. There may have been several reasons why the icon could have surfaced in Gorodets or Kostroma. It is known that Alexander Nevsky had a palace in Gorodets and that he died in this town. On the other hand, Vasily of Kostroma was Alexander's brother and could have obtained the icon from him or his wife.  Veneration  Fyodorovskaya Church in Yaroslavl (1682-87). Up to the 17th century, the icon was little known outside Gorodets and Kostroma. After 1613, its fame spread when the adolescent Mikhail Romanov had been elected as the new Russian tsar. Romanov lived in Kostroma with his mother Ksenia, who had been forced by the regent Boris Godunov to \\"take the veil\\" (join a convent and withdraw from public life). At first the nun advised her only son to stay in Kostroma and decline the offer of the Monomakh's Cap, or the position of tsar. She noted that three previous tsars had been either murdered or disgraced. Ksenia blessed her son by giving him a copy of the Feodorovskaya. She asked the icon to protect Mikhail and his royal descendants. The young tsar took a copy of the icon with him to Moscow, where it came to be regarded as the holy protectress of the Romanov dynasty. Apart from Kostroma, the Feodorovskaya has been venerated in nearby Yaroslavl, where some of the oldest copies of the icon may be found. In 1681, the icon appeared in a dream to Ivan Pleshkov, who had been paralysed for 12 years. He was commanded to go to Kostroma, procure a copy of the icon, bring it back to Yaroslavl and to build a church for its veneration. As soon as he was cured of palsy, Pleshkov commissioned Gury Nikitin, the most famous wall-painter of 17th-century Russia, who hailed from Kostroma, to paint a copy of the miraculous icon. The Fyodorovskaya Church was built to house the icon, with funds provided by ordinary people. A treatise details its construction and the miracles attributed to the icon in Yaroslavl.–®–∞–±–∞—Å–æ–≤–∞ –û.–ò. –õ–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–∞—è —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏—è: —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–∏—è –æ–± –∏–∫–æ–Ω–µ –§–µ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–π –ë–æ–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∏—Ü—ã, in –í–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ –ö–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–º—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –≥–æ—Å. –ø–µ–¥. —É–Ω-—Ç–∞ –∏–º. –ù.–ê. –ù–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Å–æ–≤–∞: –ù–∞—É—á–Ω–æ-–º–µ—Ç–æ–¥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª. –í—ã–ø. 2.

The cathedral was rebuilt in 2005. Metallic khorugv (processional banner) of the Theotokos of Saint Theodore, Moscow (1916). Another copy of the icon has been venerated in Gorodets, especially after the Feodorovsky Monastery was re-established in the early 18th century. A new copy of the icon was brought to it from Kostroma. This image was fitted into a golden riza inlaid with precious stones, so as to rival the original by its sumptuous decoration. During the annual Makariev Fair, the icon was brought for veneration to Nizhny Novgorod.For details about the Gorodets copy, see –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –§–µ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ì–æ—Ä–æ–¥–µ—Ü–∫–æ–≥–æ –º–æ–Ω–∞—Å—Ç—ã—Ä—è. Nizhny Novgorod, 2002 (reprint of the 1913 edition). When the tercentenary of the Romanov dynasty was celebrated in 1913, Nicholas II of Russia commissioned a copy of the Gorodets icon, which he placed at the Royal Cathedral of Our Lady Saint Theodore, constructed to a design by Vladimir Pokrovsky in the town of Tsarskoye Selo. It is said that Nicholas II could not have had a copy from the original image because the icon in Kostroma had blackened so badly that the image was hardly visible. This was interpreted as a bad sign for the Romanov dynasty. Indeed, the Romanovs were dethroned four years later during the Russian Revolution. Unlike the other great icons of Russia, the Feodorovskaya was not transferred to a museum, because the image was impossible to discern. The Black Virgin was given to the sect of obnovlentsy, which had it restored in Moscow in 1928. After the sect was dissolved in 1944, the icon reverted to the Russian Orthodox Church. It deposited the icon in the famous Resurrection Church on the Lowlands in Kostroma. In 1991 the icon was moved from there to the revived Epiphany Cathedral in the same city. Recently encased in a new chasuble, the icon is still venerated at the convent associated with the cathedral.

It is believed that from the conspicuous appearance of his Taj or jeweled crown, his estate derived the name of Tajhat. From 1984 to 1991 the palace was used as a Rangpur High Court Branch of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. In 1995 the palace was declared as a protected monument by the Department of Archaeology. Recognizing its outstanding architectural value the Government of Bangladesh shifted the Rangpur Museum to the second floor of the palace in 2005. The main room at the top of the marble stairs have a number of display cases which show 10th‚Äì11th century terracotta artifacts. There are a number of fine examples of Sanskrit and Arabic manuscripts, including copies of the Mahabharat, Ramayan, and a Quran whose provenance is attributed to none other than the Mughal Aurangzeb. The back rooms have several examples of black stone Hindu carvings in its back rooms, mainly of the deity Vishnu. Photography is not permitted in the museum itself.

In jazz jam sessions and for educational purposes, players often choose D7(11) D7(11) Cm7 as turnaround, which also fits with the original melody.

Biography Miller was born in Iota, Louisiana, on May 5, 1922, and spent many childhood years in El Campo, Texas. He lived most of his life in Crowley, where in the late 1930s he played guitar with several Cajun bands, including the Four Aces, the Rice City Ramblers, and the Daylight Creepers. In 1946, he began to record Cajun musicians, using a studio belonging to the record producer Cosimo Matassa, in New Orleans. In 1946, his new label, Fais Do Do Records, recorded most notably the string band Happy, Doc, and the Boys (Happy Fats and Oran \\"Doc\\" Guidry).Miller, J. D. Interview by author, 21 February 1991. Crowley Louisiana. Tape recording. Acadian and Creole Folklore and Folklife Collection, University of Louisiana at Lafayette. After a few records, in 1947, he changed the name of the label to Feature Records, which recorded Cajun musicians such as Amidie Breaux, Aldus Roger, Austin Pete and various other country musicians. Later, Miller would create and record for smaller labels for different genres of music: Rocko Records (originally Rocket), Zynn Records, Showtime Records, Rebel Records, Kajun Records, Cajun Classics, Blues Unlimited, Swade, Excello, Spot, Action, Kay, Ringo, Tribute, and French \\"Hits\\". In the 1950s he began to record swamp pop artists, including King Karl, Guitar Gable, Warren Storm, Rod Bernard, and Johnnie Allan, among others. In 1952, Miller wrote the lyrics to \\"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\\" (an answer song to the recent Hank Thompson hit \\"The Wild Side of Life\\"). The song, as recorded by Kitty Wells, became gold and stayed number 1 for several weeks.Davis, Bill; Pugh, Ronnie (1994). Liner notes for From the Vaults: Decca Country Classics 1934‚Äì1973. Around this time he also began to record swamp blues artists, such as Lightnin' Slim, Lazy Lester, Lonesome Sundown and Slim Harpo. Miller produced Harpo's \\"I'm a King Bee\\" and \\"Rainin' in My Heart\\", significant swamp blues recordings later covered, respectively, by the Rolling Stones and by Neil Young. From 1962 to 1965, Miller also recorded sides by Silas Hogan, until Miller argued with the new owners of Excello Records and his input to that label dried up. Miller's recording studio attracted a handful of mainstream recording artists, including Paul Simon, who used the studio to record \\"That Was Your Mother\\", a track from his acclaimed album Graceland, and John Fogerty, who traveled to Crowley to record a cover of \\"My Toot Toot\\", by the zydeco musician Rockin' Sidney. Miller's songwriting credits include \\"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels.\\" Although he claimed to be a segregationist, Miller nonetheless used interracial studio bands during the Jim Crow era, when black and white musicians in the South were not permitted to mingle onstage or elsewhere in public. He professed to enjoy African-American blues music more than any other musical genre, and he wrote blues songs under the pseudonym \\"Jay West\\" (a name he used to disguise his race). Yet in the 1960s he also produced and released several racist recordings on his own Reb Rebel label, most notably those of Johnny Rebel (the pseudonym of a local Cajun/country musician, Clifford \\"Pee Wee\\" Trahan). Miller died in Crowley, on March 23, 1996, after complications following quadruple bypass surgery. The Jay D. Miller Award, granted by the Louisiana Blues Hall of Fame, is named for him.

He was cited in 1995 at election to the National Academy of Science of the United States ‚Äúas the world‚Äôs leading authority on the regulation of salt and water metabolism and relevant endocrine control mechanisms. He is one of Australia‚Äôs most eminent scientists with a record of remarkable scholarly and organizational contributions. He is a highly cultured person and internationally recognised for his scientific leadership‚Äù.  Career  He is the founding Director and Emeritus Director of the Howard Florey Institute, Honorary Professor at the University of Melbourne, and a consultant at the Baker Research Institute. Denton's latest book is The Primordial Emotions: The Dawning of Consciousness.  Research  Three months after medical graduation in 1947, he made a basic discovery on kidney function at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. In the face of profuse alkaline drainage (Na+ in excess of Cl- relative to extracellular proportions) from a pancreatic fistula (2-3 litres/day) the patient‚Äôs kidneys primarily regulated the ionic pattern of the extra cellular fluid ‚Äì not plasma concentration or the load of ions to the kidney tubules. As the fistula drained, blood pressure declined, respiration increased, and Cl- excretion in urine increased despite decline in plasma Cl- level below the so called ‚Äúrenal threshold ‚Äú. Adequate intravenous infusion of sodium lactate, or oral sodium bicarbonate reduced or stopped the urinary Cl- excretion. In this era, urinary Cl- was measured at the bedside (Fantus test) to assess whether salt content of the body was adequate or whether salt administration was needed urgently. This was recommended by Marriott in his Croonian Lecture and was the practice of the British Army in India. The proposal was physiologically unsound in specific circumstances of loss of Na in excess of Cl, and Marriott altered his recommendations. It was the wrong approach in diseases such as e.g. dysentery, cholera and paralytic ileus. No rapid estimation of urinary sodium by flame photometry had yet emerged. Denton recognised also a crucial biological fact that no biologically relatively inactive cation had evolved in Metazoan organisms to play a role analogous to that which increase of bicarbonate plays on the anion side of the pattern during vomiting and excess Cl- loss.Denton, D. A. Renal regulation of the extracellular fluid. I. A study of homeostasis in a patient with duodenal fistula. Medical Journal of Australia, 2, 521-528, 1949. In this latter case no large urinary Na excretion was obligatory to keep acid-base balance compatible with life. The initial finding with pancreatic fistula was published by Nature (London, 1948).Denton, D. A. Renal regulation of the extracellular fluid. Nature, 162, 618-619, 1948. In 1949, he, and Dr Victor Wynn who had joined him in study of a second case, were supported by Professor R. D. Wright and Sir MacFarlane Burnet to set up the Ionic Research Unit of the NHMRC in the Physiology Department at Melbourne University. The Ionic Research Unit originated flame photometry in clinical medical practice internationally ‚Äì a Wynn initiated step.Wynn, V., Simon, S., Morris, R. J. H., McDonald, I. R. and Denton, D. A. The clinical significance of sodium and potassium analyses of biological fluids: their estimation by flame spectrophotometry. Medical Journal of Australia, 1, 821-835, 1950. Rapid measurement of sodium and potassium in blood and urine helped originate intensive care, and they published a monograph in Acta Medica Scandinavica.Denton, D. A., Wynn, V., McDonald, I. R. and Simon, S. Renal regulation of the extracellular fluid. II. Renal physiology in electrolyte subtraction. Acta medica scandinavica, 140 suppl. 261, 1-202, 1951 Denton and Wynn‚Äôs approach, particularly flame photometry with rapid assessment of biochemical disorder, eventually resulted in saving of tens of thousands of lives in Australia as well as in other countries by chemically accurate intervention. In 1952 Wynn went to London, where Professors Pickering and Robb at St Mary‚Äôs Hospital established a metabolic intensive care unit which Wynn directed. Some years later he was visited by Professor Francis Moore of Harvard who incorporated the Melbourne classification of distortion of body fluid status viz subtraction acidemia e.g. pancreatic fistula; addition acidemia e.g. diabetic coma; subtraction alkalemia e.g. vomiting gastric juice; and addition alkalemia (excess alkali ingestion) into his textbook ‚ÄòMetabolic Aspects of Surgery‚Äù Denton, in Melbourne, directed his efforts to basic physiological processes involved in regulation of body fluids. Fifty years had passed since Pavlov was using Pavlov-Glinski parotid fistulae in dogs with discovery of conditioned reflexes. Nine papers from Russia and Germany had reported in the interim that a permanent unilateral parotid fistula was not surgically feasible in ruminants. Denton succeeded surgically in sheep which opened a new era in the study of body fluid regulation. In effect, the parotid fistula (1-4l/day) represented a tap on the blood stream letting out sodium. Many animal preparations made also embodied his novel idea of adrenal autotransplant into arterio-venous skin loops constructed in the neck, as executed by Wright and Goding. This allowed revelation of direct action on the gland by adrenal arterial infusion of e.g. Na, K, ACTH in a conscious undisturbed animal. Following the discovery of the salt retaining hormone aldosterone by the Taits in 1953, with major medical implications, the hunt for the mode of control of it was internationally intense. Following the Australian Group finding of a specific but limited role of Na, K and ACTH, cross circulation experiments by Denton, Goding and Wright discovered an unidentified humoral agent in aldosterone control, and contemporaneously Davis and Peterson at NIH made a similar finding in anaesthetized dogs. (subsequently angiotensin II was indicted ‚Äì Ganong, Mulrow)). Denton and colleagues showed direct action of Angiotensin II on the adrenal by arterial infusion. The operative idea of the cervical autotransplant was later applied internationally to ovary and uterus, and the parathyroid, thyroid, pancreas, and in Melbourne to the kidney.  Evolutionary implications  Continuous parotid fistula secretion (1-4 litres daily) contrived severe Na depletion rapidly in sheep. Salivary Na/K ratio of 170/10 changed dramatically over days to 10/160 as a result of adrenal secretion of aldosterone. Thus K, abundant in vegetation, could be used in the digestive life cycle for months. This evolutionary advantageous process allowed use of the Na content of the rumen ‚Äúreservoir‚Äù to support the circulation, and reproduction ‚Äì foetal tissues and lactation. Thus, herbivores invaded and reproduced in the vast Na depleted interior of continents, alps, deserts and jungles. Their historic evidence of severe sodium depletion in native and introduced species of wild animals in the Alps in Australia was ratified by direct measurement of peripheral blood aldosterone with a double isotope dilution method set up by Dr John Coghlan of the Ionic Unit following his study with Professor Ralph Peterson in New York. The discovery of severe Na depletion of animals in the Alps of Australia was confirmed in camels in the desert in Africa by Knut Schmidit-Nielsen, and in moose in Canada by Jordan and Botkin.Denton, D.A. The Hunger for Salt : an anthropological, physiological and medical analysis, 1982, Springer Verlag, Heidelberg. Hitherto salt depletion had been inferred by the attraction of animals to salt. Meteorological data had shown that by 150-200 Km from the ocean coast rainwater is devoid of Na containing marine aerosols, and thus vast areas of the planet are Na depleted. With regard to the HCO3 ion, Denton recognised early that data showing that alligators, with their swallowing of whole large prey and having plasma HCO3 rise from 40 to 100 mmol/litre, and Cl decrease from 100 to 40 mmol/litre with blood pH near 7.8 reflected a basic mechanism in the pathway of evolution of the constrictors and big reptiles. They passed a major portion of their extracellular CL- content into their stomach as HCl to digest prey over very many days. He suggested also that the endocannibalism recognized by Alfred Russel Wallace in the vast Na depleted regions of the Amazon Basin reflected conservation by the tribes of very scarce minerals of critical importance. With Hird and Reich, Denton showed the monotremes platypus and echidna were ureotelic which underlined biochemical changes crucial for mammalian evolution. The months following graduation (1947), and the responsibility for the patient with a pancreatic fistula, led to study sojourns with Frank Fenner and Macfarlane Burnet in Melbourne, and Verney in Cambridge, UK in 1952. On return from the UK, Denton‚Äôs discoveries starting from the two fistula patients, and several sheep in cages progressively revealed novel renal, endocrine and instinctive behavioural mechanisms of notable medical, integrative physiological, and evolutionary survival importance.  Australian and International Recognition of the Investigation  The work attracted large financial support from private benefactors in Australia (Kenneth and Baillieu Myer, and Sir Ian Potter) and overseas, the Australian Government and Reserve Bank, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health (US). This founded and supported the Howard Florey Laboratories in 1962, and then in 1970, the Howard Florey Institute of Experimental Physiology and Medicine, which has eventually become the largest neuroscience institute in the Southern Hemisphere (The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health ‚Äì 600 personnel).

Derek Denton has done this in ‚ÄúHunger for Salt‚Äù, and the result is something astonishing among contemporary scientific letters ‚Äì a single author book that covers everything ‚Äì This grand book‚Äù, and by Harold Schmeck, lead Science Writer of the New York Times, as ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Äùmay be the most comprehensive treatment of the subject ever completed‚Äù, Dr. John Pappenheimer, the Emeritus Professor of Physiology at Harvard, characterized it as ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Äùthe best example of integrative physiology to come of the second half of the 20th century‚Äù. Fierce controversies on the role of excess salt intake as a major cause of hypertension in humans were rampant in the second half of the twentieth century. The issue was clouded by citation of multiple factors possible and the role of the Salt Institute in Washington, an industry funded body. At the primate research centre of the Texas Biomedical Institute in San Antonio, Eichberg and Shade showed humans closest relatives, chimpanzees, fed a diet with Na content equivalent to urban humans showed characteristic population blood pressure rise with age. Denton located a population of chimpanzees at the Institute of Primate Research at Franceville, Gabon, approximately 100 km further up the Ouguie river than Dr Schweitzer‚Äôs Hospital at Lamborene in Equatorial Africa. The Franceville chimpanzees received essentially a vegetarian-fruit diet providing 5-10 mmol of Na per day. Twelve were continued on the diet and twelve others had sodium added to the same diet via a protein supplement drink given to both groups. Initially, mean blood pressure of both groups was characteristic of agricultural society (circa 120/50 mm of Hg) but with the increase of Na intake up to 15g/day over 1.5 years, which reflected intake in Akita province of Northern Japan (a region of high incidence of hypertension) mean systolic blood pressure had increased by 33 mmHg and diastolic by 10mmHg . By 20 weeks after ceasing salt supplement, the blood pressure had reversed to initial control level baseline. With publication and editorial in Nature Medicine, the New York Times cited it as a decisive one variable experiment and Denton, accompanied by the Editor of Nature Medicine presented a Lecture on it to the FDA in Washington. He was notified later that the Salt Institute had withdrawn a Citizens Petition to the FDA proposing cessation of designation of sodium content of foods in the USA which probably would have influenced many other countries. Denton had already persuaded Heinz in Australia to cease adding salt to baby food. From the outset of preparation of sheep with a permanent parotid fistula in 1953 it was evident that the animals vigorously licked any dried saliva on the walls of their cages and attacked a salt block placed in their cage. A clear-cut avid appetite for salt was evident, and opened a new way to investigate the neural organization of a classic instinct. Elaborating the general biological context, Denton showed that sodium was a rate limiting factor in reproduction, especially in animals with multiple litters, and that in pregnancy and lactation increased secretion of a quintet of steroid and peptide hormones caused a large increase of salt appetite. His wide-ranging area of study ‚Äì the instincts ‚Äì is where many major discoveries were made. The primordial emotions ‚Äì hunger for air, food hunger, thirst, pain, sexual desire, specific mineral appetites such as for salt or phosphate, search for temperature compatible environment or sleep after deprivation etc., are the subjective element of the instincts. They embody, when fully active, an imperious goal directed intention, which may entirely dominate the stream of consciousness. Denton showed that sodium appetite is innate, specific for sodium salts, and separate from thirst, as shown by brain lesion and behavioural studies. There is clearly a genetically determined neural organization subserving gratification of sodium appetite. He showed in certain species the genesis of appetite involves response to reduction of brain intracellular sodium concentration whereas in others the hormone Angiotensin II, released as a result of reduction of blood volume, is the initiating stimulus and its antagonist losartan will reduce or abolish appetite. The appetite can be rapidly gratified by eating or drinking of salt by animals in the wild, akin to the rapid gratification of thirst, rapidity being of high survival value. It reduces the chances of being killed by predators lying in wait. The hormonal cascade initiated by stress and ACTH was shown also to cause a large sodium appetite. In parallel, his oesophageal fistula studies of thirst and sodium appetite and its gratification conducted with his colleagues, Elspeth Bott, Michael McKinley, Eva Tarjan, and Richard Weisinger revealed the role of the 5th, 7th, 9th and 10th cranial nerves as a chronological sequence contriving gratification. Neuroimaging has shown also a novel mechanism involved in the inhibiting of fluid intake when adequate has already been ingested. At this time, the Florey Group led by McKinley showed the site of Verney‚Äôs osmoreceptor was outside the blood-brain-barrier in the lamina terminalis. Investigations in collaboration with Professor Wolfgang Liedtke of Duke University, USA (2011) examined gene expression in the hypothalamus of mice associated with Na appetite, and its abolition by rapid voluntary intake of salt solution before the time of significant absorption from the gut. Na deficiency caused up regulation of hypothalamic genes, including dopamine and cAMP regulated neuronal phosphoprotein 32 kDA (DARPP-32), dopamine receptors 1 and 2 and STEP. Administration of D1and D2 receptor antagonists reduced gratification. The gene sets were gene sets previously linked to addiction (opiates and cocaine). Salt appetite and gratification are evident in Metatheria (e.g. kangaroos) which evolved more than 100 million years ago, whereas drugs of addiction are recent. This raised the question whether contemporary hedonic indulgence and addiction has utilized ancient neural pathways and receptors of instinct processes, which may explain the many difficulties in treatment. From early studies on the organization of fluid control of the body, Denton‚Äôs investigations advanced to centre on the greatest challenge in biology. Consciousness has emerged during evolution because its advent gave very great survival value. The neural organization was honed on the anvil of natural selection. The primordial emotions are the subjective component of the instincts and represent an extremely powerful impetus orientated to a specific goal. Specific and innately programmed sensory signals act as the releasing mechanism which initiated the consummatory behaviour. William James in ‚ÄúPrinciples of Psychology‚Äù published a century ago said ‚Äì ‚ÄúIn speaking of instincts, it has been impossible to keep them separate from the emotional excitements which go with them.‚Äù As well as the central issue of genetically programmed behaviour, Denton has studied also higher cognitive function in chimpanzees ‚Äì explicitly self-awareness. Hitherto it was established by Gallup and others that chimpanzees used mirror reflections to examine otherwise visually inaccessible parts of the body e.g. genitalia or arm pit. The proposal is that you cannot use mirrors to do this unless you know who you are ‚Äì i.e. you are self-aware. Denton has elaborated this by showing chimpanzees their reflection in distorting ‚Äúcircus mirrors‚Äù where they will appear either very fat, or very tall and thin ‚Äì quite unlike any chimpanzee they had ever seen, or their own reflection as seen in a mirror. It emerged that the chimpanzees had the cognitive capacity to abstract. By swaying from side to side, they established that the distorted reflection moved contemporaneously with their own volitional movement. Thus it was themselves, and they rapidly lost interest. The observation focuses whether ‚Äúcause and effect‚Äù was understood as a discernible natural law or reality of the external world by the animal brain. The Howard Florey Institute of Physiology and Medicine has been a leader in long term survival experiments on large animals and was characterized by the National Institutes of Health Washington, as probably the best facility in the world for this type of experiment. Apart from striking new knowledge on the brain sensors (sodium appetite) and organization of primordial emotions entrained, such as, for example, thirst, salt appetite or hunger for air, his work has led to a theory proposing that the primordial emotions, the subjective elements of the instincts, were phylogenetically the first emergence of consciousness, often instigated by dedicated interoceptors. This hypothesis is set out comprehensively in a book ‚ÄúThe Primordial Emotions : The Dawning of Consciousness\\",Denton, D.A. Primordial Emotions: the dawning of consciousness, (Preface by Prof. Jean-Pierre Changeux), Flammarion, Paris, 2005; Oxford University Press, UK, 2006 published by Flammarion, Paris, 2005, and Oxford University Press 2006.  The Analysis of Instinctive Behaviour  During the past twenty years, Denton‚Äôs studies increasingly have concerned the issue of the evolutionary emergence of consciousness and his proposal that the primordial emotions, the subjective elements of the instincts were the beginning of consciousness. The experimental work included the first neuroimaging of thirst with the Melbourne group, including Gary Egan, Michael Farrell and Michael McKinley, working with Peter Fox and colleagues at the Research Imaging Centre in San Antonio. The early concentration on the instincts subserving the vegetative systems e.g. thirst and hunger for air highlighted the imperious arousal compulsive of intention, which is apt for survival of the organism. Imaging revealed an important role of the midcingulate (BA32) and insula in the consciousness of thirst, and also that of midbrain structures. Latest discoveries, reported in PNAS with Pascal Saker as lead author have included the identification of a mechanism inhibiting swallowing in the situation of complicit over-drinking of water by subjects following immediate earlier adequate volitional satiation of thirst. The complicit over-drinking evokes an unpleasant aversive subjective sensation and probably reflects evolutionary emergence of protection against surfeit, and its hyponatraemic dangers. Denton hypothesized that early in animal evolution complex reflex mechanisms located in the basal brain subserving responses with a homeostatic outcome, in concert with elements of the reticular activating system subserving arousal, melded functionally with regions embodied in the progressive rostral development of the telencephalon. This included the emergent limbic and paralimbic areas, and the insula. This phylogenetically ancient organization subserved the origin of consciousness as the primordial emotion, which signalled that the organisms existence was immediately threatened. Neuroimaging confirms major activations in regions of the basal brain during primordial emotions in humans. The behaviour of decorticate humans and animals is important in relation to the possible existence of primitive awareness. Neuroimaging of the primordial emotions reveals that rapid gratification of goal directed intention by a consummatory act such as ingestion causes precipitate decline of both the initiating sensation and the intention. There is contemporaneous rapid disappearance of particular regions of brain activation which suggests they may be part of the jointly sufficient and severally necessary activations and deactivations which correlate with consciousness.  Awards and honours  In 1995, on election to the National Academy of Sciences, he was cited as \\"the world's leading authority on the regulation of salt and water metabolism and relevant endocrine control mechanisms\\". He is also exploring the nature of consciousness in animals. In 1987 he was awarded the Macfarlane Burnet Medal and Lecture by the Australian Academy of Science for his lifetime's work and in 1999 elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. He was made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2005 for leadership in medical research.

The J90 evolved from the Cray Y-MP EL minisupercomputer, and is compatible with Y-MP software, running the same UNICOS operating system. The J90 supported up to 32 CMOS processors with a 10 ns (100 MHz) clock. It supported up to 4 GB of main memory and up to 48 GB/s of memory bandwidth, giving it considerably less performance than the contemporary Cray T90, but making it a strong competitor to other technical computers in its price range. All input/output in a J90 system was handled by an IOS (Input/Output Subsystem) called IOS Model V. The IOS-V was based on the VME64 bus and SPARC I/O processors (IOPs) running the VxWorks RTOS. The IOS was programmed to emulate the IOS Model E, used in the larger Cray Y-MP systems, in order to minimize changes in the UNICOS operating system. By using standard VME boards, a wide variety of commodity peripherals could be used. The J90 was available in three basic configurations, the J98 with up to eight processors, the J916 with up to 16 processors, and the J932 with up to 32 processors. Each J90 processor was composed of two chips - one for the scalar portion of the processor, and the other for the vector portion. The scalar chip was also notable for including a small (128 word) data cache to enhance scalar performance. (Cray machines have always had instruction caching.) In 1997 the J90se (Scalar Enhanced) series became available, which doubled the scalar speed of the processors to 200 MHz; the vector chip remained at 100 MHz. Support was also added for the GigaRing I/O system found on the Cray T3E and Cray SV1, replacing IOS-V. Later, SV1 processors could be installed in a J90 or J90se, further increasing performance within the same frame.

Slavs settled in this area in the 6th century. Old Slavic graves dating from the 6th and 7th century have been found in Slankamen. During the Middle Ages, Slankamen was a fortified city and was first mentioned in 1072 as Castrum Zalankemen. Arsenije I Bogdanoviƒá from Srem, the second Serb archbishop (1233‚Äì1263) after Saint Sava, was born in the village Dabar near Slankamen. In 1325, according to a letter by pope John XXII to the Roman Catholic archbishop of Kalocsa, a public hospital was built in the village. In the 15th century, the town was a possession of the Serbian despots Stefan Lazareviƒá and ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá. From 1451, it was property of Hunyadis and from 1498 of John Corvin. In the 16th century it was a residence of Radoslav ƒåelnik, a duke of Srem. Acumincum was declared Archaeological Sites of Great Importance in 1991, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia.

The X1 is often described as the unification of the Cray T90, Cray SV1, and Cray T3E architectures into a single machine. The X1 shares the multistreaming processors, vector caches, and CMOS design of the SV1, the highly scalable distributed memory design of the T3E, and the high memory bandwidth and liquid cooling of the T90. The X1 uses a 1.2 ns (800 MHz) clock cycle, and 8-wide vector pipes in MSP mode, offering a peak speed of 12.8 gigaflops per processor. Air-cooled models are available with up to 64 processors. Liquid-cooled systems scale to a theoretical maximum of 4096 processors, comprising 1024 shared-memory nodes connected in a two-dimensional torus network, in 32 frames. Such a system would supply a peak speed of 50 teraflops. The largest unclassified X1 system was the 512 processor system at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, though this has since been upgraded to an X1E system. The X1 can be programmed either with widely used message passing software like MPI and PVM, or with shared-memory languages like Unified Parallel C programming language or Co-array Fortran. The X1 runs an operating system called UNICOS/mp which shares more with the SGI IRIX operating system than it does with the UNICOS found on prior generation Cray machines. In 2005, Cray released the X1E upgrade, which uses dual-core processors, allowing two quad-processor nodes to fit on a node board. The processors are also upgraded to 1150 MHz. This upgrade almost triples the peak performance per board, but reduces the per-processor memory and interconnect bandwidth. X1 and X1E boards can be combined within the same system. The X1 is notable for its development being partly funded by United States Government's National Security Agency (under the code name SV2).NSA Secures Future of Cray SV2 With 5-Year Funding Deal The X1 was not a financially successful productCray Inc. 10k-filing for December 31, 2005 and it seems doubtful that it or its successors would have been produced without this support.

Nine clubs play in the competition, eight of which are from Brisbane with one club from the Gold Coast. The premiership has been contested in its present form since 1929.Queensland qru  Hospital Cup Winners  History  Queensland Premier Rugby (QPR) evolved out of the Brisbane club competition that had been running since 1887. It was created by players, administrators, referees and coaches to expand and improve the top level of Queensland non-professional rugby. QPR provides Queensland rugby players a stepping stone for selection into the Queensland Reds and other teams in Super Rugby or other professional rugby competitions. Previous to 1920, the Hospitals Challenge Cup was established as a fund-raising exercise for the Brisbane General Hospital. After the devastation of World War I the competition was suspended until the Hospitals Cup was established. The Brisbane Club competition recommenced in 1929. The 1975 Grand Final was played between the Brothers club and GPS and Brothers won the match. Teachers-Norths, Wests and again Brothers won the next seasons. In 1979, the first ever draw in a final occurred with a 24-all draw between rivals University and Brothers, a reply of the final was held, which saw University defeat Brothers by a mere 3 points. Brothers dominated the next few seasons, winning the 1980 to 1984 premierships. Souths won their first title in 1986, and University won a number of titles at the end of the decade. Souths came to major prominence during the 1990s, winning the competition five times in a row from 1991 through to 1995, and then again in 1998 and 2000. They also featured in the 1996 season final which GPS won, and the 1997 final which Easts won. Canberra also competed in the competition, and found major success, winning three titles in a row from 2001 to 2003. The Gold Coast Breakers also began to become a force in the competition, featuring in five finals from 2001 to 2007, although they were on the receiving end of the competitions largest ever grand final score being thrashed 85-19 by the Sunnybank Dragons in the 2007 Grand Final. In future, teams from other Rugby regions in Queensland may also join the competition, thus encouraging the pursuit of Rugby excellence across the state, not just confining it Queensland's south-east corner. However at a meeting of the Sunshine Coast Rugby Union in October 2013, it was decided by the members not to compete in the 2014 QRU‚Äôs Premier Rugby Competition, but will instead focus its energy on becoming the leading force in regional rugby.http://www.scru.com.au/2013/10/scru-to-consolidate-its-position/ Other trophies Thomas Welsby Memorial Cup: The top two premier grade teams at the end of the first full round of home and away matches contest the Welsby Cup in their second round meeting.

Geography The source of the Adan River is in the Washim district of Maharashtra. The Arunavati River meets the Adan River about 13 kilometres before it joins the Painganga River. The river dries up in the summer, leaving only pools towards the end of its course. Two dams have been built on the Adan; one at its origin near Sonala village and the other near Karanja Lad city, both in Washim District. The river then flows shrubland. Adan Dam was built in 1977 near Karanja Lad, Washim district around 13 km from where the Adan River meets the Painanga.  Environmental Impact of the Adan Dam  In two separate reports on the environmental impact of the Adan Dam on the aquatic biodiversity of the river and the surrounding fishing communities in 2008 and 2012, Dr Nilesh K. Heda reported the following effects: * Effect on Fishing Communities: The new reservoir has led to large areas of the river becoming inaccessible to local anglers who cannot fish for most of the year due to the low water level. The construction of the dam has led to high levels of siltation and hydrophyte growth. These changes have led to the local Bhoi people having to rely less on their more sustainable, traditional fishing techniques. * Effect on Aquatic Ecosystem: The diversity and abundance of fish has declined since the construction of the dam.

The WARU Senior Grade competition was contested from 1895 to 1913. The Rugby Football code went into recess in the west from the 1914 season until 1928 when 4 Clubs; Wanderers, Rangers, Wallabies and Fremantle revived the First Grade Club Competition. In 2004, RugbyWA successfully secured the fourth Australian Super 12 licence, entering a team in the expanded Super 14 competition from 2006, called the Western Force. RugbyWA has also established a series of development programs. The development team is the Perth Spirit, which has competed in the Australian Rugby Championship in 2007 and the National Rugby Championship since 2014. There are currently 10 RugbyWA Board Members, President, D G Redpath who was re-elected in March 2012. Dr R J Perry is the current Chairman and Mr Arthur Hill is the current Patron. The RugbyWA is a not-for-profit organisation run by its shareholding organisations ‚Äì WA clubs and affiliated bodies (juniors, schools, referees, women's and country rugby). RugbyWA incorporates both Professional and Community Rugby. There is no private ownership of RugbyWA with profit generated re-invested into the game at all levels in Western Australia.

Led by Richard Sinclair, it evolved from the short-lived Going Going. Going Going Sinclair (vocals, bass) and Hugh Hopper (bass), both mainstays of the Canterbury scene, had played together in the Wilde Flowers 25 years previously. They were re-united in a band with Mark Hewins (guitar-synth), Andy Ward (drums, with whom Sinclair had played in Camel) and Vince Clarke (percussion, from the late 1970s RSVP line-up with Sinclair). Sinclair has said that they almost persuaded fellow former Wilde Flowers member Kevin Ayers to join too, \\"but he was busy with recording work.\\" Billed as Hugh Hopper & Friends, the band debuted at the Canterbury festival on 10 June 1990. Three further shows follow in October/November (with Clarke only playing the first). The name Going Going was chosen as they were supporting (an offshoot of) Gong, thus \\"Going, Going... Gong\\" as a pun on the phrase \\"going, going, gone\\". The set list for the later shows was: * \\"Where But For Caravan Would I\\" * \\"In The Land Of Grey And Pink\\" * \\"Keep On Caring\\" * \\"Led It Lay\\" (a Hewins instrumental) * \\"We Did It Again\\" * \\"Miniluv\\" * \\"Going For A Song\\" * \\"Hope For Happiness\\" Caravan of Dreams Sinclair had also joined a Caravan reunion in 1990, which inspired him to form a new band to play his material with two fellow members of Going Going. Caravan of Dreams was launched in 1991 as a trio with Sinclair (bass, vocals), Hewins (guitar) and Ward (drums). They played live twice that year. Hewins left the band, busy with other projects, and Sinclair and Ward were joined by Rick Biddulph (a former roadie for Sinclair's earlier band Hatfield and the North) on bass, with Sinclair switching to guitar. Based around these three, the band continued until 1993, often joined by former Caravan members Dave Sinclair and Jimmy Hastings. An example set list from 27 April 1993 (with just R. Sinclair, Biddulph and Ward) is: \\"In The Land Of Grey And Pink\\", \\"Only The Brave/Plan It Earth\\", \\"Share It\\", \\"Videos\\", \\"Heather\\", \\"Keep On Caring\\", \\"Emily\\", \\"Felafel Shuffle\\", \\"Going for a Song\\", \\"Back to Front\\", \\"Cruising\\", \\"Halfway Between Heaven and Earth\\", \\"It Didn't Matter Anyway\\", \\"Golf Girl\\". On their first album, Caravan of Dreams (1992), the band consisted of Richard Sinclair (guitar, vocals, bass on studio tracks), Dave Sinclair (keyboards), Jimmy Hastings (flute, saxophone), Andy Ward (drums), Rick Biddulph (live bass), Michael Heupel (flute) and Alan Clarke (harmonica). A double live album followed: An Evening Of Magic (1993), recorded in Italy. Latterly in 1993, Sinclair moved on to his RSVP album project and the band broke up. Ward and Biddulph went on to join the Camel and Caravan spin-off Mirage. Richard Sinclair's Caravan In the autumn of 1993, a new band toured, billed as Richard Sinclair's Caravan and initially consisting of Richard Sinclair, Hugh Hopper and two drummers, Andy Ward and Dave Cohen. Hopper was only able to make the first show on the tour, leaving the other three to continue as a trio.

Within the state of Victoria, it is the governing body for the sport of rugby union. Rugby Victoria manages competitions for males and females in several age groups and divisions, and involving clubs from metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria. Rugby union was founded in Melbourne in 1888. However competition lapsed and was twice re-established during the first twenty years, and again after the first World War when the present governing body was founded in 1926, then known as the Victorian Rugby Union, or VRU. In December 2017, the VRU was re-branded as Rugby Victoria. History Early years: 1888 to 1945 The Melbourne Rugby Union was established in 1888 and the first two clubs were founded in that year. Later that season, a Victorian team was selected to play the British side known then as the \\"English Footballers\\" but now recognised as the First British Lions team. The visitors won the match, 9-3. Melbourne's club competition ceased in 1890 but a new administrative body, the Victorian Rugby Union, was formed in 1893. The Victorians played their first inter-colonial rugby match in 1894, beating South Wales by 3-0 at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground. Competition lapsed again after the Victorians were defeated 30-0 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) by the British Lions in 1899, but the Victorian Rugby Union was re-formed in 1908. Australia played Victoria at the MCG in August of that year, on their way to Great Britain for what became known as the First Wallabies Tour. Of the seven clubs comprising the new Union in 1909, Melbourne, East Melbourne, South Melbourne and University were the first to compete for the Dewar Shield, a trophy which is still awarded today to the premier first grade team. Competition ceased during the First World War and recommenced under a re-established VRU in 1926. The subsequent decade later became known as the Golden Years of Victorian Rugby and included the selection of the first Victorian-born player to represent Australia, Sir Edward \\"Weary\\" Dunlop, in 1932. Dave Cowper, who played for the Melbourne Rugby Club and represented Victoria in the 1930s became Victoria's first, and so far only, Wallaby captain in 1933. In 1939, four Victorian players were selected in the Wallaby side to tour Europe: Andy Barr, Max Carpenter, Stan Bisset and George Pearson. However the tour was prematurely ended by Britain's declaration of war on Germany just two days after the team arrived at Plymouth on 2 September 1939, with all sport in Britain cancelled.  Amateur rugby: 1945 to 1995 Logo until late 2017 In 1958, the first test match in Victoria was staged at Olympic Park Stadium, with Australia hosting the Maoris. Modern era: 1996 onward The Victorian Rugby Union (VRU) bid unsuccessfully for the fourth Australian Super 14 licence, which eventually went to the Western Force prior to the 2006 season. However, New South Wales gave up a fourth franchise for the Australian Rugby Championship, allowing Victoria to field the Melbourne Rebels in that competition. In November 2009, SANZAR announced that Australia had won the 15th Super rugby franchise licence, and the Australian Rugby Union awarded it to the Melbourne Rebels consortium led by media magnate Harold Mitchell. The VRU did not initially own or run the Melbourne Rebels. On 27 June 2013, the Rebels announced that foundation shareholders Harold Mitchell AC, Bob Dalziel, Lyndsey Cattermole, Alan Winney, Ralph D'Silva, Gary Gray, Paul Kirk, Leon L'Huillier, David Ogilvy and Michael Bartlett had transferred 100% of their shares to the Victorian Rugby Union. The two organizations combined operations as a result of the transfer with Ross Oakley concluding his tenure as CEO of the VRU once the transfer was made. Rebels CEO Rob Clarke took responsibility for both organizations. Jonathan Ling became the chairman of the Melbourne Rebels, replacing Harold Mitchell. Peter Leahy was appointed General Manager of Community Rugby to oversee the operations of local competitions and all Victorian Community Rugby activities. Current competition Victoria has twenty-five senior rugby clubs . Senior player numbers have grown from 1,400 in 1998 to well over 2,200 in 2012. Teams in the competition have grown from 4 in 1909 to 173 in 2013. The nine teams that play for the Shield in the domestic Premier 1 Division are: *Melbourne University Rugby Football Club (Parkville) *Harlequin Rugby Union Club (Ashwood) *Melbourne Rugby Union Football Club (Prahran) *Power House Rugby Union Football Club (Albert Park) *Box Hill Rugby Union Football Club (Box Hill) *Endeavour Hills Rugby Union Football Club (Endeavour Hills) *Moorabbin Rugby Club (Moorabbin) *Footscray Rugby Union Football Club (Footscray) *Southern Districts (Frankston) , Rugby Victoria has seven teams in their senior women's competition.  Representative teams  The Victoria Country Barbarians team competes in the NRC Division 2 tournament. From 2000 to 2008, the Melbourne Axemen played in the Australian Rugby Shield.

They use cameras, camcorders and audio recorders to conduct overt surveillance of the public. An unsuccessful legal challenge has been made against their use of overt surveillance, but in 2009 the Court of Appeal ruled that they must justify retention of photographs on a case-by-case basis. Any retained information is recorded on the Crimint database. Political activists have criticised FITs and said that they feel the aim of FIT deployment during protests is to prevent legal protests. Journalists have also complained that FITs attempt to stop them photographing protests and that they conduct surveillance of journalists. A campaign group, Fitwatch, formed in 2007 that aim to obstruct FITs and conduct sousveillance on the officers. Two members of the group were arrested at the 2008 Climate Camp on obstruction charges. A similar police surveillance unit, the Video Intelligence Unit is operated by Greater Manchester Police. In June 2010, the Home Office announced it would review the use of FITs during public order policing. History and purpose FITs were first formed in the early 1990s, as part of the Public Order Intelligence Unit (CO11), a section of the Public Order Branch of the Metropolitan Police. They initially targeted football fans, hunt saboteurs and political protesters (since at least 1996),George Monbiot, \\"Defective Inspectors (archived)\\". 29 August 1996, The Guardian Archived using cameras, camcorders and audio recorders to conduct overt surveillance of the public. The police officers wear full uniform, and are intended to be a highly visible presence. Their uniform is sometimes different from normal police officers in that the upper half of their yellow fluorescent jackets is blue. Civilian photographers are also employed by the police to work alongside FITs. According to Scotland Yard, the aim of FIT teams at protests is to record evidence of protesters in case disorder occurs later on at a protest.Protesters' rights were violated by Met surveillance Mark Blunden London Evening Standard 28.07.10 archived link More recently the teams' purpose has been extended to routine police work on low-level crime and anti- social behaviour and police forces throughout the UK now have their own FITs. Despite the implication in their name that their function is to merely gather intelligence, they are also intended to have a deterrent effect. This approach has been reported to work in reducing reports of anti-social behaviour at times when FITs are deployed in specific neighbourhoods.Crackdown sees drop in antisocial behaviour Daily Gazette 26 August 2009 archive link Jacqui Smith, then Home Secretary praised Operation Leopard that used FITs to target youths, in Laindon, Essex stating:5.00 Operation LeopardThe Guardian Paul Lewis and Simon Green 30 May 2008 > \\"Operation Leopard is exactly the sort of intensive policing that can bring > persistent offenders to their senses... Relentless filming of them and their > associates throughout the day and night\\" Linda Catt, an activist, has suggested that their tactics are \\"designed to intimidate people and prevent lawful dissent\\". This view is echoed by a police debriefing of their operations at the 2008 Camp for Climate Action which praised FITs at the event for disrupting activists.P21 Operation Oasis Debrief Kent Police 9 October 2008 archive link In June 2010, the Home Office announced it would review the use of FITs during public order policing. The move was influenced by the discovery that information collected by FITs, included that which was unrelated to suspected crimes, for example recording who made speeches at demonstrations. In October 2010, FIT officers in plain clothes were spotted by a press photographer at a protest against companies avoiding tax, despite Commander Bob Broadhurst telling a parliamentary committee in May 2009, that only uniformed officers distinguishable by their blue and yellow jackets were involved in gathering intelligence at protests. The Metropolitan Police told The Guardian that it was necessary to deploy plain-clothed officers to \\"gather information to provide us with a relevant and up-to-date intelligence picture of what to expect\\". It was the first time that FITs are known to have been deployed in plain clothes. Legal issues Liberty brought a judicial review of the overt surveillance practices in May 2008, which was decided in favour of the police, however the police were asked to clarify their evidence to the Court of Appeal, following an investigation by The Guardian newspaper. In May 2009, the Court of Appeal ruled that photographs collected by FITs of people who have not committed a criminal offence can no longer be kept. The ruling was made after Andrew Wood, an arms trade activist, was photographed after challenging the management of Reed Elsevier at their AGM over them organising arms trade exhibitions. Wood argued that police had harassed him and infringed his right to privacy by photographing him. Lord Collins of Mapesbury said that the police presence had a \\"chilling effect\\" on people who were protesting lawfully. FITs have not been banned but they must now justify the retention of photographs on a case-by- case basis. As a result of the ruling the Metropolitan Police's public order unit, CO11 was forced to delete 40% of the photos of protesters that it held. In a report about the policing of the 2009 G-20 London summit protests, Denis O'Connor, the chief inspector of constabulary, stated that the routine use of FITs at protests \\"raises fundamental privacy issues and should be reviewed\\". He also said that there was \\"confusion\\" over the role of FITs and advised that the Home Office should issue guidance over the legality of the surveillance of protesters and the retention of images. Information processing A \\"spotter card\\" used by FITs at protests and political meetings. This was dropped by a police officer at the alt=A piece of paper with 24 photographs of people saying \\"for police eyes only\\" and that it should be destroyed after the event The information that FITs collect is stored on the Crimint database, which is used daily by police officers to catalogue criminal intelligence. People are listed by name allowing police to determine which events individuals have attended. Photographs obtained by FITs are used to produce \\"spotter cards\\" consisting of people's photographs which allows officers to identify people at future events that they attend. For ¬£10, people are able to obtain a list of protests that they have attended from the data held on Crimint under laws in the Data Protection Act 1998. Academic response A 2006 report, The Economics of Mass Surveillance calculated that the use of FITs at mass gatherings involves gathering intelligence on roughly 1,200 people to record the actions of one person. The report also noted that most of the people on \\"spotter cards\\", used by the police photographers, were those involved in the organisation of protests and that FITs also attend meetings where demonstrations are organised. Criticism Fitwatch (formed in early 2007) campaign against FITs by actively obstructing their operations, and by passively opposing their operations by photographing units (a form of sousveillance). In June 2009,The Guardian released video evidence recorded by a FIT at the 2008 Climate Camp of alleged police brutality against two female members of Fitwatch. The women had asked police officers to reveal their shoulder numbers, as at least four officers had not displayed them. The women attempted to photograph the police officers for evidence, but were forced to the ground, restrained with handcuffs, and had their legs bound with straps. They were then placed in restraint positions, arrested, charged and held in custody for four days, including three days in HMP Bronzefield, before they were released on bail. The police later retracted all the charges against the women. The women lodged a complaint with the IPCC over the incident. The journalist George Monbiot commented on this case, saying that \\"the police are turning activism into a crime\\" and that \\"the FITs' methods appear to have been lifted from a Stasi training manual\\". He claimed that \\"anybody who is politically active is filmed, identified, monitored, logged, and cross- checked\\". A police debrief into the operation at Kingsnorth praised the deployment of FITs saying that they were \\"highly effective and gained good intelligence and disruption\\".P43 Operation Oasis Debrief Kent Police 9 October 2008 Three members of Fitwatch were convicted for obstructing FIT officers in June 2008 as they attempted to photograph those attending a No Borders meeting in London. In July 2010 the Inner London Crown Court overturned the men's convictions, with the judge stating that the protesters' human rights may have been violated by the FIT officers. On 15 November 2010, the hosts of the Fitwatch blog were asked by the Police National E-Crime Unit to take down the website due to it \\"being used to undertake criminal activities\\". The request came after a post on the blog after the 2010 student protest in London, which advised students of actions they should take if they were concerned that they were photographed at the demonstration, such as cutting their hair and disposing of clothing they were wearing. Emily Apple, one of the founders of the site told The Guardian, \\"Nothing in that post [giving guidance to student protesters] has not been said before on our blog or on other sites\\". On 17 November 2010, the Fitwatch website returned, hosted on a web server outside of the UK. The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has criticised FITs for their surveillance and sometimes violent harassment of working journalists. Marc Vallee, who was hospitalised by police after documenting a protest, has said that the teams limit freedom of the press and called on the Home Office to confirm that the police had no right to restrict the work of photojournalists. Bob Broadhurst, who is in charge of public order policing at the Metropolitan Police, said in a statement to the NUJ in 2008 that journalists, \\"on the production of a valid form of accreditation will be able to continue with their work\\". The NUJ are to make a formal complaint to the Information Commissioner due to the Metropolitan Police failing to provide details on the surveillance of journalists under the Freedom of Information Act. Bob Broadhurst told photographers at an NUJ conference that he had no faith in the National Press Card (a form of press pass) despite journalists needing to prove that they are bona-fide newsgatherers to an independent authority before they are issued. The BBC TV series Panorama produced an episode entitled \\"What ever happened to people power?\\" in July 2009 which discussed the use of FITs in targeting activists and journalists.What Ever Happened to People Power? BBC Panorama First broadcast 6 Jul 2009 archive link Similar police units Greater Manchester Police operate a Video Intelligence Unit, whose plainclothes officers confront and video certain freed prisoners as they leave prison after serving their sentences. They also record footage of people involved in anti-social behaviour on the streets. The aim is to give other police officers up to date information on the appearance of people who have broken the law. Video footage thus collected is constantly replayed on TV screens in rooms where officers complete their paperwork. Footage that they have recorded has also been uploaded onto YouTube in an attempt to catch people they believe have reoffended. This has resulted in several offenders being sent back to prison after breaching licence conditions. Since the unit was launched in 2006 more than 900 people have been filmed by the unit. Not all of these people are suspects in crime however, people can be filmed if they are thought to associate with prolific offenders or if they have been stopped in an area of high crime under suspicious circumstances. Kieran Walsh, a civil liberties lawyer, said the unit's work \\"could have implications\\" for the force under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right to privacy. He believes that filming must be a \\"proportionate and reasonable\\" response to a crime and that this does not appear to be the case as people are being targeted over what they might do in the future. It is uncertain as to how long data collected by the unit is to be kept but GMP currently anticipate it will be stored for five years.

The chimney is 300 metres high, one of the highest chimneys in Germany. The power station supplies not only electricity but also process steam for the paper factory of the Norske Skog as well as long- distance heating and electricity to Fernw√§rmeschiene Niederrhein and the Walsum coal mine. From approximately 930,000 tons of coal, the power station produces approximately 2.2 billion a kWh electricity, 33 million a kWh of long-distance heating, 500,000 t process steam and 250 million m¬≥ compressed air per year. It has a coal storage capacity of 34.000 t. History At the location Duisburg Walsum were established to 1928 a power plant for the covering of the need of the coal mine Walsum at steam. 1957 were extended it by a power station block (block 6) with 68 MW, 1959 and 1960 followed two power station blocks (block 7 and 8) with 150 MW each. 1988 replaced block 9 with an output of 410 MW the blocks 6 and 8. 2007 are to be begun with the building of the block 10 for a capacity of 700 megawatts (MW). Block 10 will be ready to start end of 2013 after serious problems with the high-tech steel of the boiler. June 30, 2007 the Walsum coal mine stopped down.

Noted for performing traditional music on his twelve string guitar, he released his first album in 1969. He released 10 albums during his lifetime and was featured on national television. He was a recipient of the East Coast Music Award's Lifetime Achievement Award and the Order of Canada, conferred in 2003. Biography Cameron was born in Inverness County, Nova Scotia to Dan L. Cameron and Catherine Anne (Katie Anne) MacDonald. Katie Anne (1914‚Äì1983) was the only sibling of renowned Cape Breton fiddler and composer Dan Rory MacDonald. In 1957 John Allan moved to Ottawa, Ontario where he studied to be a Roman Catholic priest through the Order of the Oblate Fathers. In 1964, a few months before ordination, Cameron obtained a dispensation from the church to pursue studies in education at St. Francis Xavier University, and eventually a career in music. He was a regular on Singalong Jubilee in the 1960s and he was later host of two Canadian television series. The first was the Montreal-produced John Allan Cameron on CTV from 1975 to 1976. Guests included Stan Rogers, Edith Butler, The Good Brothers, Stringband, Colleen Peterson, Adam Mitchell, Michael Cooney, Shirley Eikhard, Liam Clancy, Tommy Makem, Nancy White, Steve Goodman, and Rhythm Pals. Cameron would return to national television on CBC with the Halifax-produced The John Allan Cameron Show which ran from 1979 to 1981. He was also a guest star on Sharon, Lois & Bram's The Elephant Show in 1986. John Allan Cameron also was the host of Super Variety Tonight, a CBC television special that aired on Sunday, April 4, 1982 featuring several guests including Sharon, Lois & Bram. Besides his numerous television and concert appearances, he performed at the Grand Ole Opry in 1970. In January 2005, Cameron was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome. Several benefit projects such as concerts and a tribute CD were produced to support costs resulting from his treatment of this cancer. On 22 November 2006, Cameron died in Toronto. Cameron's son, Stuart Cameron is also an accomplished musician. Discography Albums {  ! Year !

In desert cultures one is required by laws of hospitality to provide a drink to strangers. The amount that was provided was indicative of how welcomed the guest was, and to pour a full glass or a glass that ‚Äúran over‚Äù would be reserved only for the most welcomed guest. In the Bible This phrase, in Hebrew (k≈çs√Æ r…ôwƒÅyƒÅh), is translated in the traditionally used King James Version as my cup runneth over. Newer translations of the phrase include \\"my cup overflows\\"NIV, ESV, NASB, Holman Bible. and \\"my cup is completely full\\".NET The 23rd psalm, in which this phrase appears, uses the image of God as a shepherd and the believer as a sheep well cared-for. Julian Morgenstern has suggested that the word translated as \\"cup\\" could contain a double meaning: both a \\"cup\\" in the normal sense of the word, and a shallow trough from which one would give water to a sheep.Morgenstern, Julian. ‚ÄúPsalm 23.‚Äù Journal of Biblical Literature, vol. 65, no. 1, 1946, p. 18., www.jstor.org/stable/3262214. Other interpreters have suggested that verses 5 and 6 of Psalm 23 do not carry forward the \\"shepherd\\" metaphor begun in verse 1, but that these two verses are set in some other, entirely human, setting.For bibliographic information about various suggested settings, see Arterbury, Andrew E., and William H. Bellinger. ‚Äú‚ÄòReturning‚Äô to the Hospitality of the Lord A Reconsideration of Psalm 23,5-6.‚Äù Biblica, vol. 86, no. 3, 2005, pp. 387‚Äì388., www.jstor.org/stable/42614606. Andrew Arterbury and William Bellinger read these verses as providing a metaphor of God as a host, displaying hospitality to a human being.Arterbury, Andrew E., and William H. Bellinger. ‚Äú‚ÄòReturning‚Äô to the Hospitality of the Lord A Reconsideration of Psalm 23,5-6.‚Äù Biblica, vol. 86, no. 3, 2005, pp. 387‚Äì395., www.jstor.org/stable/42614606. Thus, alongside other actions in Psalm 23, such as preparing a table, and anointing one's guest with oil, providing a full or even overflowing cup for him to drink from can be read as an illustration of God's generosity to the Psalmist. In music The phrase is the title of a popular song written by Harvey Schmidt with lyrics by Tom Jones, featured in the 1966 Broadway musical, I Do! I Do!, which starred Robert Preston and Mary Martin. The most popular recording of the song was made by Ed Ames in 1967, which was a #8 pop (#9 Can.) and #1 AC hit in the United States. Other notable versions of the song are by: * Al Martino ‚Äì for his album Daddy's Little Girl (1967). * Andy Russell ‚Äì included in his album Such a Pretty World Today (1967). * Aretha Franklin ‚Äì recorded for her album Young, Gifted and Black (1972) but not used. Eventually included in the compilation album Rare & Unreleased Recordings from the Golden Reign of the Queen of Soul (2007) Aretha Franklin also covered the Ed Ames song at the Wynton Marsalis Christmas Jazz Performance in 2015 accessible on YouTube. * Bing Crosby & Kathryn Crosby ‚Äì for the album Bing Crosby Live at the London Palladium (1976) * Bobby Goldsboro ‚Äì The Romantic, Wacky, Soulful, Rockin', Country, Bobby Goldsboro (1967). * Des O'Connor ‚Äì I Pretend (1968). * Floyd Cramer ‚Äì Class of '67' (1967). * Jerry Vale ‚Äì Time Alone Will Tell and Other Great Hits of Today (1967). * The Lennon Sisters ‚Äì Somethin' Stupid (1967). * Andrew Bird ‚Äì Pulaski at Night * By popular New Zealand barbershop quartet, the Musical Island Boys. The quotation has been used extensively in other music. Rapper Project Pat employed the quotation in its most literal sense when he stated \\"Patron in my cup runneth over\\" in his song \\"I Keep That\\" from his post- incarceration album Crook by da Book: The Fed Story. Rap artists Eminem and Jay-Z have used it in \\"Rabbit Run\\" and \\"Can't Knock the Hustle\\" respectively, and Eminem has also used the phrase \\"His cup just runneth over, oh no!\\" in the song \\"Forever\\", while actor and musician Drake used it in \\"Ignant Shit\\" as well as in a collaborative song with Eminem called \\"Forever\\"; Justin Timberlake also uses the phrase \\"Sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over\\" on Jay-Z's song \\"Holy Grail\\". Rapper T.I. uses the term in his song \\"sorry\\", where the first words spoken on the track are \\"My cup runneth over...\\". Rock musicians have also used the phrase. It is in the opening lyrics of \\"December\\" by Collective Soul and in the opening line of the Alice in Chains song \\"Bleed the Freak\\", while the death metal band Aborted include the phrase as a lyric in \\"Pestiferous Subterfuge\\" and the virtual band Gorillaz referenced the phrase in \\"All Alone\\". A variation is also used in the song \\"So Appalled\\" from rapper/producer Kanye West's album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy when fellow rapper Cyhi the Prynce says \\"My cup overrunneth with hundreds,\\" referring to one-hundred dollar bills. This line is also similar to rapper Jay-Z's line in his song \\"Can't Knock the Hustle\\" from his album Reasonable Doubt when he too says \\"My cup runneth over with hundreds.\\" Childish Gambino references the quote in his song \\"53.49\\" when he say \\"Get your cup it runneth over once I got the juice.\\" The words are exactly repeated in the song \\"Manifest\\" by the Fugees in their 1996 album The Score. The quotation is also used in the song \\"Gorgeous\\" from the 1966 Broadway musical The Apple Tree, directed by Mike Nichols with music by Jerry Boc, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, and a book by Bock and Harnick with contributions from Jerome Coopersmith. It starred Barbara Harris, Alan Alda, and Larry Blyden. The quotation also features prominently in the Bob Marley song \\"My Cup\\" and in the Dennis Brown song \\"Here I come\\". It is also used by Tavares in their disco hit-song \\"Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel\\". It also features in the song \\"Desert Sand\\" by UB40 and in the Brandon Flowers song, \\"Magdalena\\", from the album Flamingo. It also features in The Stone Roses' song \\"Tightrope\\", on their album Second Coming and in Andrew Bird's song \\"I want to see Pulaski at Night\\", which is also featured in the second-season premiere episode of Orange Is the New Black. The quotation is also used in Kacey Musgraves‚Äô song ‚ÄúI Miss You‚Äù, from her debut album Same Trailer Different Park. In video games \\"My cup runneth over!\\" is screamed as an expression of ecstasy by the fictional character William Bedford Diego in the 1999 video game System Shock 2, while in World of Warcraft, fictional character Blood Prince Valanar uses the phrase during the \\"Blood Prince Council\\" encounter. Also Pandaren Brewmaster from Dota 2 uses it. \\"Your cup runneth over!\\" is also an achievement or trophy in Devil May Cry 4. In an easter egg in Day of the Tentacle there is a Victorian photograph resembling the character Max from Sam & Max Hit the Road with the caption \\"The late Max Attucks, his petard runneth over.\\" In the MOBA Smite, it is the name of a Match of the Day where teams begin the match at max level with 12,000 gold. In television \\"Thy cup runneth over\\" was the catch-phrase of the coverage of the 2010 FIFA World Cup on the Australian Special Broadcasting Service (SBS). In the animated series Daria, the title character uses the phrase sarcastically in the episode \\"I Loathe a Parade\\". This term has also been referred to in ABC's new series GCB. In GCBs second episode, \\"Hell Hath No Fury\\", Amanda and other waitresses of Boobilicious have \\"My Cup Runneth Over\\" printed on the backs of their T-shirts. In the first episode of the second season of Sex and the City, Samantha uses the phrase \\"His cup runneth over\\", as a pun and in a more literal meaning, referring to a baseball player who wears a protective cup. In an \\"A Few Minutes with Andy Rooney\\" segment on the topic of driveways, Rooney uses a modified version of the phrase: \\"Like the garage, the driveway is never quite big enough. There never has been a driveway big enough in the whole history of driveways. Our driveways runneth over.\\" DCI Gene Hunt remarks \\"Our cup runneth over\\" in series 1 episode 2 of Ashes to Ashes, most likely sarcastically as a respected lawyer has just arrived to represent a suspect CID has detained.

Two minor lakes or ponds lie along the creek: Jewel Lake and Lake Anza. The latter was enlarged by the construction of a small dam in the mid-20th century. An active tectonic fault, the Wildcat Fault, runs the length of the canyon. Wildcat Canyon was named for the mountain lions which used to be fairly common in the area.

Soon however, a high performance main power station developed from it. In the years 1968 to 1971 the almost identically constructed blocks B to E went into operation, in 1974 and 1975 followed G and H (50% portion of RWE power), 1979 the block F and at the end of 1985 the long-distance heating power station Buer (FWK).

It is the same as the harmonic minor scale, except that it has a raised fourth scale degree to introduce an additional gap, or augmented second. It is a symmetrical scale with a slightly ambiguous tonal centre, due to the many half steps. Its step pattern is W, H, +, H, H, +, H, where W indicates a whole step, H indicates a half step, and + indicates an augmented second (three half steps, enharmonically equivalent to a minor third but notionally distinct). The scale contains two augmented seconds, one in each tetrachord.Kahan, Sylvia (2009). In Search of New Scales, p.39. . Cites Liszt. Des Boh√©mians, p.301. It also contains an augmented fourth between the first and fourth degree. This scale (and its modes like the double harmonic scale) is the one perfectly balanced seven-note subset of the equally tempered chromatic scale: when its pitches are represented as points in a circle whose full circumference represents an octave, their average position (or \\"centre of mass\\") is the centre of the circle.

Greengairs is shown on a map by Roy c.1754 under the name of Green Geirs. In toponymy the name means \\"green strips of grass\\". Lying southeast of Cumbernauld and north east of Airdrie, the village consists mainly of local authority housing. Between them Greengairs and Wattston have about 1,190 residents. It developed in the nineteenth century due to increased coal mining and quarrying. Ironstone was first mined by the Summerlee Iron Company in the 1840s. It was in the parish of New Monkland or East Monkland. It also historically had its own school; the teachers had a house but no salary. The village was badly affected by the Stanrigg Mining Disaster where, in July 1918, a collapse led to the deaths of 19 local mine workers. Greengairs power station opened in 1996, and is powered by methane produced by biodegrading materials from a large landfill site developed since 1990 in former open cast workings situated to the south of the village. Greengairs is the largest landfill site in Scotland, handling waste from Glasgow and Edinburgh. Greengairs has 6000m of pipes with biogas fed by 90 gas wells.

He played for a number of Danish clubs, and most notably won the 1998‚Äì99 Danish Superliga with AaB. A prolific striker in the Superliga, he finished league top scorer three years in row in the 2003‚Äì04 (joint), 2004‚Äì05 and 2005‚Äì06 seasons. He played one match for the Danish national team.Inetrview with Bold On 7 January 2008, the day of his retirement from his career as a professional footballer, H√∏jer started as head of sport in Viborg FF. Biography Born in Viborg, H√∏jer made his senior debut for hometown club Viborg FF in the Danish 1st Division in 1992. Through four years at the club, H√∏jer and Viborg struggled to get a foothold in the top-flight Danish Superliga. When they succeeded in the 1995‚Äì96 season, H√∏jer scored 16 goals in 32 games, and was sold to league rivals Aalborg Boldspilklub (AaB). He made his debut for the Danish national team, when he was substituted into an August 1996 match against Sweden for the last ten minutes of play. He was an immediate success at AaB, though he did not score as many goals as he did for Viborg FF. In his final year of contract at AaB, he helped the club win the 1998‚Äì99 Danish championship. He did not play much that season due to stiff competition from Norwegian player Frank Strandli and fellow Dane S√∏ren Frederiksen, which prompted H√∏jer to look for a new club. He signed a contract with Italian club Brescia Calcio and was loaned out from AaB to Viborg FF, while awaiting his AaB contract to expire in the summer 1999. At Viborg, he played four games before he suffered a knee injury, which meant he started his Italian career injured. His stay at Brescia was short, and he never played a game for the club. He moved back to Denmark in 2000, in order to play the season out at Danish 1st Division team FC Midtjylland. He helped the club win promotion to the Superliga, before moving back to play with childhood club Viborg FF. Not regaining his former goal scoring prowess, lacklustre play in the first half of the 2002‚Äì03 season meant that H√∏jer was sold to Odense BK in January 2003. At Odense, he looked to replace league top scorer Kaspar Dalgas, who had been sold to Br√∏ndby IF before that season. H√∏jer rediscovered his goal scoring form at Odense, as he finished the 2003‚Äì04 season as joint top scorer with Mohamed Zidan, Mwape Miti and Tommy Bechmann. He was the sole top scorer of the 2004‚Äì05 season. As H√∏jer still lived in Viborg, he decided to once again play for Viborg FF when his contract expired following the 2004‚Äì05 season. In his first season back at Viborg FF, he set the record of three consecutive Superliga top scorer titles, improving Peter M√∏ller's former record of two, set in the 1991‚Äì92 and 1992‚Äì93 seasons. Steffen H√∏jer scored 125 goals in Danish Superliga.

He was the leading sire in North America in 1999 and 2000, and the leading juvenile (two-year-old) sire a record seven times. He sired 108 graded stakes winners and eight champions, including Giant's Causeway, who also became a leading sire. Although best known as a sire, Storm Cat was one of the best two-year-old racehorses of his generation, winning the Grade I Young America Stakes and finishing second in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. Background Storm Cat was a dark bay horse with a white star and stripe on his forehead and white socks on his left feet. He was sired by Storm Bird, a son of Northern Dancer. His dam was Terlingua, an outstanding sprinter who was sired by Secretariat. William T. Young of Overbrook Farm purchased Terlingua in partnership with Bill Lockridge, who arranged the mating with Storm Bird. Lockridge then sold his share of Terlingua to Young, who thus became Storm Cat's breeder of record. Storm Cat was foaled at Derry Meeting Farm in Pennsylvania. As a yearling in July 1984, Young intended to offer Storm Cat at the Keeneland Sales. However, Storm Cat tested positive for equine viral arteritis (EVA), and had to be withdrawn. \\"It was funny\\", said Young in a later interview. \\"Storm Cat might have tested positive for EVA, but he never had it. Anyway, Keeneland wanted me to bring him back in the September sale, but I just decided to keep him and race him.\\" He was trained by Jonathan Sheppard, who was best known as a steeplechase trainer. Storm Cat stood high at maturity. He was a high-spirited, well-built horse with a powerful hip, but suffered from offset knees. Peppermints were his favorite treat. Storm Cat was the focus of the well-received 2002 nonfiction book \\"Stud: Adventures in Breeding\\" by author Kevin Conley. Racing career Storm Cat made his racing debut on August 11, 1985 at Saratoga racetrack, finishing second. He then won his next two starts, a maiden special weight race at Saratoga on August 21 and an allowance race at the Meadowlands on September 9. He then finished second in the World Appeal Stakes on September 28 before winning the Grade I Young America Stakes on October 10, both races held at the Meadowlands. Storm Cat entered the 1985 Breeders' Cup Juvenile as the favorite and led by as much as three lengths down the stretch. In the last strides however, he was run down by Tasso and finished second by a nose. \\"If he had won that race,\\" said Young, \\"he would have been a champion, and I think I would have been able to finally sell him.\\" Instead, Storm Cat underwent surgery over the winter for bone chips in his knees then suffered a tendon injury. He returned to the racetrack in October 1986, winning an allowance race at the Meadowlands and finishing fourth in the Annapolis Stakes. He was kept in training at age four but was never fit enough to race. He retired with a record of four wins from eight starts. Stud career Storm Cat retired to stud at Overbrook Farm in Lexington, Kentucky in 1988 with modest expectations. His initial stud fee was $30,000, dropping to $20,000 in 1991. Even at this price, demand was low so Young would sometimes enter into foal-sharing agreements with the owners of quality mares ‚Äì Young would pay the stud fee in exchange for part ownership of the resulting foal. In some cases, Young even gave seasons away for free to keep Storm Cat's stud career alive. Storm Cat's first crop of 39 foals started racing in 1991 and were only moderately successful, with average earnings of just $16,850. Even so, two members of that crop eventually became Grade I winners. When his second crop started racing in 1992, he started to establish a reputation as the sire of fast, precocious two-year-olds. He was the leading juvenile sire in North America in 1992, a title he would earn a record seven times (1992, 1993, 1995, 1998, 1999, 2002 and 2004). The previous record holder was Bold Ruler with six such titles. In 1994, Young received the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Breeder, in no small part due to the success of Storm Cat's son Tabasco Cat, who won the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes. In 1995, Storm Cat's stud fee increased to $100,000, which was considered a bargain after yearlings from that crop sold for an average of $500,000. The crop foaled in 1996 included Aljabr, a multiple Group One winner in Europe on the turf, and Cat Thief, a Grade I winner in America on the dirt whose wins included the 1999 Breeders' Cup Classic. These wins propelled Storm Cat to the top of the North American sire list in 1999. Storm Cat's next crop included 'iron horse' Giant's Causeway, who won five straight Group One races in Europe and then finished second in the 2000 Breeders' Cup Classic. Storm Cat repeated as the leading sire in North America, and also finished second in the standings for Great Britain and Ireland. The crop foaled in 1998 was the first to average more than $1 million at auction and included Black Minnaloushe, who won the Irish 2,000 Guineas and St. James Palace Stakes. Storm Cat's stud fee increased to $200,000 in 1999, then to $300,000 in 2001. From 2002 to 2007, his fee was $500,000, the highest in North America at the time. His yearlings continued to be in high demand, reaching a peak in 2005 when 28 of his offspring were sold for an average price of $1,763,750. At the September 2004 Keeneland yearling sales, a Storm Cat colt since named Mr. Sekiguchi sold for $8 million, and in the 2005 sale, another of his colts, Jalil, sold for $9.7 million. The price was the highest ever paid for a yearling sold at the Keeneland September sale and is third-highest overall. All told, 462 of his yearlings were sold at auction for a total of about $319 million, including 91 yearlings that brought $1 million or more. In 2008, Storm Cat remained in high demand with a fee of $300,000 but was retired from service because of declining fertility. Of 30 mares covered that year, only three were reported in foal. In 2009, Storm Cat's services were offered to Quarter Horse breeders using artificial insemination, which is not allowed with Thoroughbreds. He sired one graded stakes winner this way, named Stray Cat. In 2015, it was announced that two clones of Storm Cat had been produced, though one subsequently died in a paddock accident. The clone is not considered a Thoroughbred by the rules established by The Jockey Club and the plan is to use him to breed polo ponies. At the time of his death in April 2013, he had sired 35 grade/group one winners, eight champions, 108 winners of group or graded stakes races, and 180 stakes winners worldwide, which have earnings in excess of $128 million.http://www.drf.com/news/legendary-overbrook-farm- stallion-storm-cat-dies-30 \\"For years Storm Cat has been very aware of who he is,\\" said stallion manager Wes Lanter. \\"I've been fortunate to work around a couple of really great horses. I think the top ones kind of have that attitude in them that says, 'I am the best.' And I think part of that attitude is imparted on their progeny, and that, as much as good conformation, ability, tenacity and desire, is key to the success of a horse.\\" { class = \\" sortable\\" width:90%\\" +  left;\\" Group/Grade 1 winners by Storm Cat - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Foaled ! scope=\\"col\\"  Name ! scope=\\"col\\"  Sex ! scope=\\"col\\"  Major Wins -  1989 Harlan  c  Vosburgh - 1989November SnowfTest, Alabama Stakes -  1990  Desert Stormer  f  Breeders' Cup Sprint -  1990 Missed the Storm f  Test -  1990  Mistle Cat  c  Premio Vittorio Di Capua -  1991  Sardula  f  Hollywood Starlet, Kentucky Oaks - 1991 Tabasco Cat  c  Preakness, Belmont -  1993  Hennessy  c  Hopeful -  1993  Silken Cat  f  Mazarine Stakes -  1994  Aldiza  f  Go For Wand Handicap -  1994  Sharp Cat  f  Del Mar Debutante, Santa Anita Oaks, Acorn, Beldame, Ruffian, etc. -  1995  Catinca  f  Ruffian -  1996  Tactical Cat  c  Hollywood Futurity -  1996  Aljabr  c  Prix de Salamandre, Sussex, Lockinge -  1996  Cat Thief  c  Breeders Futurity, Breeders' Cup Classic -  1996  Forestry  c  King's Bishop -  1997  Giant's Causeway  c  St. James Palace, Sussex, Eclipse, Juddmonte International, Irish Champion -  1997  High Yield  c  Hopeful, Blue Grass -  1997  Finders Fee  f  Matron, Acorn -  1998  Raging Fever  f  Matron, Frizette, Ogden Phipps -  1998  Black Minnaloushe  c  Irish 2000 Guineas, St. James Palace -  1999  Sophisticat  f  Coronation -  2000  Dessert  f  Del Mar Oaks -  2000  Hold That Tiger  c  Grand Criterium -  2000  Storm Flag Flying  f  Matron, Frizette, Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, Personal Ensign -  2000  Nebraska Tornado f  Prix de Diane -  2001  One Cool Cat  c  National Stakes -  2001  Good Reward  c  Hollywood Derby, Manhattan -  2001  Denebola  f  Prix Marcel Boussac -  2002  Sweet Catomine  f  Del Mar Debutante, Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, Santa Anita Oaks -  2002  Consolidator  c  Breeders' Futurity -  2003  Bluegrass Cat  c  Haskell -  2003  After Market  c  Charles Whittingham, Eddie Read -  2004  Mr Sidney  c  Maker's Mark Mile -  2005  Life Is Sweet  f  Santa Margarita, Breeders' Cup Ladies Classic - } Champions sired by Storm Cat include: * Silken Cat (1995 Canadian Champion 2yo filly) * Aljabr (1998 Cartier Award Champion 2yo colt) * Giant's Causeway (2000 Cartier Award Horse of the Year * Hold That Tiger (2002 Cartier Award Champion 2yo colt) * Storm Flag Flying (2002 American Champion 2yo filly) * Denebola (2003 Champion 2yo filly in France) * One Cool Cat (2003 Cartier Award Champion 2yo colt) * Sweet Catomine (2004 American Champion 2yo filly) Sire of sires and broodmares Storm Cat is also a noted sire of other successful stallions. By far his most successful son at stud was Giant's Causeway, who was a three-time leading sire in North America. Like Storm Cat, Giant's Causeway produced Grade/Group One winners on both turf and dirt, and left behind several promising sons at stud, including dual French classic winner Shamardal. Storm Cat also left behind numerous other sons at stud, including Harlan, Hennessy, Forest Wildcat, Forestry, Stormy Atlantic, Tale of the Cat and Bernstein. These sons have also produced further generations of good sires such as his grandson Harlan's Holiday and great-grandson Scat Daddy, the sire of 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify. Bluegrass Cat and Freud are successful regional sires in California and New York respectively. Tiger Ridge became a successful sire when exported to South Africa. His daughters have also made him a noteworthy broodmare sire. He was the leading broodmare sire in North America from 2012 to 2014 and has been in the top 10 every year between 2005 and 2015. Progeny produced by daughters of Storm Cat include: * Speightstown, 2004 Breeders' Cup Sprint winner and Champion Sprinter * Folklore, 2005 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies winner and Champion 2-Year Old Filly * Bodemeister * Close Hatches, 2014 Champion Older Female Horse * Shared Belief, 2013 Champion 2yo male horse * Honor Code, 2015 Champion Older Male Horse * Real Steel (JPN), winner of the 2016 Dubai Turf ;Closest ancestor of two triple crown winners Storm Cat is the great-grandsire of American Pharoah, winner of the 2015 U.S. Triple Crown and the great-great-grandsire of Justify, winner of the 2018 U.S. Triple Crown.

Both LEP and English-language learner (ELL) are terms used by the Office for Civil Rights, a sub-agency of the U.S. Department of Education. According to data collected from the U.S. Census Bureau and Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS) data, LEP individuals accounted for 9% of the U.S. population over the age of five. The definition of \\"limited English proficiency\\" varies between states and within state districts. History The term \\"limited English proficiency\\"‚Äîtogether with the initialism \\"LEP\\"‚Äîwas first used in 1975 following the U.S. Supreme Court decision Lau v. Nichols. ELL (English Language Learner), used by United States governments and school systems, was created by James Crawford of the Institute for Language and Education Policy in an effort to label learners positively, rather than ascribing a deficiency to them. Recently, some educators have shortened this to EL ‚Äì English Learner. The term English Learner replaced the term limited English proficient student with the 2015 re-authorization of the Elementaty and Secondary Education Act known as the Every Student Succeeds Act. On August 11, 2000, President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 13166, \\"Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency.\\" The Executive Order requires Federal agencies to examine the services they provide, identify any need for services to those with limited English proficiency, and develop and implement a system to provide those services so LEP persons can have meaningful access to them.Executive Order 13166. Retrieved on 2008-12-11 The Virginia Department of Education has created a guidebook titled, Limited English Proficient Students: Guidelines for Participation in the Virginia Assessment Program. The guidebook is intended to determine how Limited English Proficient (LEP) students should participate in the Standards of Learning testing. Healthcare consequences Limited English proficiency is associated with poorer health outcomes among Latinos, Asian Americans, and other ethnic minorities in the United States. Studies have found that women with LEP disproportionately fail to follow up on abnormal mammogram results, which may lead to increases in delayed diagnosis.Marcus, Erin, et al. \\"How Do Breast Imaging Centers Communicate Results To Women With Limited English Proficiency And Other Barriers To Care?.\\" Journal of Immigrant & Minority Health 16.3 (2014): 401-408. Web. 25 July 2014. Medical interpreter A physician assistant with the Utah State Medical Command, Utah Army National Guard, speaks to an interpreter while working at a humanitarian civic assistance. Less than half of non-English speakers who say they need an interpreter during clinical visits report having one. The absence of interpreters during a clinical visit adds to the communication barrier. Furthermore, inability of providers to communicate with limited English proficient patients leads to more diagnostic procedures, more invasive procedures, and over prescribing of medications. Many health-related settings provide interpreter services for their limited English proficient patients. This has been helpful when providers do not speak the same language as the patient. However, there is mounting evidence that patients need to communicate with a language concordant physician (not simply an interpreter) to receive the best medical care, bond with the physician, and be satisfied with the care experience. Having patient-physician language discordant pairs (i.e. Spanish- speaking patient with an English-speaking physician) may also lead to greater medical expenditures and thus higher costs to the organization. Additional communication problems result from a decrease or lack of cultural competence by providers. It is important for providers to be cognizant of patients‚Äô health beliefs and practices without being judgmental or reacting. Understanding a patients‚Äô view of health and disease is important for diagnosis and treatment. So providers need to assess patients‚Äô health beliefs and practices to improve quality of care. Asian Americans One-third of the total population of Asian Americans is of limited English proficiency. Many Asian Americans are uncomfortable with communicating with their physician, leading to a gap in healthcare access and reporting. Even persons comfortable with using English may have trouble identifying or describing different symptoms, medications, or diseases. Cultural barriers prevent proper health care access. Many Asian Americans only visit the doctor if there are visible symptoms. In other words, preventive care is not a cultural norm. Also, Asian Americans were more likely than white respondents to say that their doctor did not understand their background and values. White respondents were more likely to agree that doctors listened to everything they had to say, compared with Asian American patients. Lastly, many beliefs bar access to proper medical care. For example, many believe that blood is not replenished, and are therefore reluctant to have their blood drawn.

It was well publicised at the time, but since has received little historical attention, despite it producing a higher body count than the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and the Four Dead in Five Seconds Gunfight of 1881. Unlike most other well-known gunfights of the Old West, it involved no notable or well known gunfighters, nor did it propel any of its participants into any degree of fame. Its legend has grown, however, because one of the participants simply walked away from the scene, never to be seen again. The gunfight The incident began with an argument between two local lawmen, Billy Bailey and Mike McCluskie. The two men began arguing on August 11, 1871, over local politics on election day in the \\"Red Front Saloon\\", located in downtown Newton. The argument developed into a fist fight, with Bailey being knocked outside the saloon and into the street. McCluskie followed, drawing his pistol. He fired two shots at Bailey, hitting him with the second shot in the chest. Bailey died the next day, on August 12, 1871. McCluskie fled town to avoid arrest, but was only away for a few days before returning, after receiving information that the shooting would most likely be deemed self defense, despite the fact that Bailey never produced a weapon. McCluskie had claimed he feared for his life, having known that in three previous gunfights, Bailey had killed two men. Bailey, a native of Texas, had several cowboy friends who were in town. Upon hearing of his death, they vowed revenge against McCluskie. On August 19, 1871, McCluskie entered Newton and went to gamble at \\"Tuttles Dance Hall\\", located in an area of town called Hide Park. He was accompanied by a friend, Jim Martin. As McCluskie settled into gambling, three cowboys entered the saloon. They were Billy Garrett, Henry Kearnes, and Jim Wilkerson, all friends to Bailey. Billy Garrett had been in at least two prior gunfights, killing two men. Hugh Anderson, the son of a wealthy Bell County, Texas cattle rancher, also entered, and approached McCluskie, calling him a coward and threatening his life. Jim Martin jumped up and attempted to stop a fight from occurring. Anderson shot McCluskie in the neck, knocking him to the floor. McCluskie attempted to shoot Anderson, but his pistol misfired. Anderson then stood over him and shot him several times in the back. Kearns, Garrett, and Wilkerson also began firing, perhaps to keep the crowd back, and may have shot McCluskie in the leg. At that point a young man, believed to have been around 18 years of age at the time, named James Riley, opened fire on them. Riley was dying from tuberculosis, and had been taken in by McCluskie shortly after arriving in Newton. Riley had never been involved in a gunfight before, but only Anderson still had a loaded pistol to return fire. Some accounts say Riley locked the saloon doors before shooting, but this seems unlikely. The room was filled with smoke from all the prior gunfire, and visibility was bad. Riley ended up hitting seven men. Jim Martin, the would-be peacemaker, was shot in the neck and later died of his wound. Garrett, Kearns, and a bystander named Patrick Lee were also mortally wounded. Anderson, Wilkerson, and another bystander were wounded but survived. With both guns empty and all his opponents down, Riley walked away and was never seen again. Legend has it he left the area and began a new life elsewhere. However, due to his ill physical state, it is more likely he died not long afterward under an assumed name. Either way, he disappeared. A warrant was issued for Anderson for killing McCluskie. He left Kansas cause he was bored by training and settling in Texas to recover from his gunshots.

The team was officially formed in 1987 and is nicknamed the Eagles. An international powerhouse during the 1990s‚Äî the Eagles won the inaugural 1991 Women's World Cup and finished second in the two following World Cups in 1994 and 1998. The team finished fourth in the most recent Rugby World Cup 2017 in Ireland. In May 2018, the Rob Cain was appointed full-time Head Coach. Cain joined the Eagles after winning the inaugural Tyrell Premier 15s title in England with Saracens Women. History (Source: US Women's Rugby Foundation) The history of women's rugby in the United States can be traced back to three teams that existed in 1972 ‚Äì the Colorado State University Hookers at Fort Collins; the University of Colorado, at Boulder; and the University of Illinois, at Champaign. During the mid-1970s women's teams began to spring up on college campuses across the United States. As those players graduated they went on to set up teams near cities and urban centers. At that time there was only one division for all women's rugby. In 1975 United States Rugby Football Union was formed and contained four territories. At this time the women had their own Board of Directors and followed in parallel USARFU with four territories (East, Midwest, West and Pacific). In 1978 the first Women's National Championships was held. The Chicago Women's Rugby Club in Chicago, Illinois hosted this event. The winner of that championship was Portland, Maine. 1980s‚Äì1991 In 1985 the first semblance of a national team was formed. An ‚Äòinvitation-only‚Äô team was put together and made up of, arguably, the top women playing the game at the time. The team was named WIVERN and toured throughout England and France. The team finished the tour undefeated. Many of these players went on to be selected to the 1991 World Cup Team. In 1987 the USA women's national team was officially born with their first match against the Canadian women's national team. Although the women were not permitted to wear the Eagle logo, this match was sanctioned by Rugby Canada and USA Rugby. USA and Canada began holding an annual match, which became known as the CanAm series. For ten years the Women Eagles went undefeated in this test series. In 1990 the women's national team, competing under the name ‚ÄòUSA Presidents 15‚Äô, traveled to New Zealand to compete in the historic Women's World Rugby Festival. The WNT posted a record of 3‚Äì1 with their only loss coming at the hands of New Zealand. In 1991 the first Women's Rugby World Cup was held in Cardiff, Wales. Coached by Beantown's Kevin O‚ÄôBrien, a Welshman himself, and Minnesota's Chris Leach, a South African the stage was set for the US women to bring home the Cup. Defeating New Zealand in semi-final play, the USA women advanced to the finals where they defeated England. Also in 1991 the first woman was elected to serve on the USARFU Board of Directors. Jamie Jordan was elected Treasurer for the Board. Present The USA Women's National Team XVs most recently finished fourth at Rugby World Cup 2017 in Ireland which earned them automatic qualification to the next World Cup in New Zealand in 2021. In early 2018, the program hired former Women's National Team player Emilie Bydwell to serve as its General Manager of Women's High Performance. Soon after in May, Rob Cain was appointed full-time Head Coach and has since helped lead the program in a new direction. The Women's National Team Program fields a number of age-grade and development programs including the High School All-Americans (U18), Under-20s, Collegiate All-Americans and USA Selects. All age-grade and development programs are umbrellaed under the national team program and serve as a feeder to the senior Women's Eagles. 2019 Performance Squad The 2019 Performance Squad serves as the top tier of the USA Women's National Team XVs depth chart.

The staff of the station mentors students of the university's Department of Language, Literature & Communication, as well as volunteers/students interested in broadcasting. It has 41 kilowatts (kW) power. History The station originally began broadcasting on Tuesday March 18, 1986 with 10 kW at 90.7 MHz from a little white house-like building that currently houses other offices of the university. WRVS became Northeastern NC's first Public Radio Station. Edgard \\"Eddie\\" Oakley was the first student to broadcast on the station. Aerek Stephens the first student sports announcer. The station later moved to its current location in Williams Hall. The original slogan for WRVS-FM was \\"Wonderful Radio Viking Style\\". WRVS-FM at one point used the slogan \\"The Rhythm of the River City\\" and currently uses the tagline \\"Your Community Voice\\". The station was the brainchild of former Chancellor Jimmy Jenkins. He hired David C. Linton, from WSHA-FM at Shaw University to help the University realize his dream. Linton was brought in as Special Assistant to the Chancellor for Media Development. Linton, worked with the FCC, engineers and others to get the station on the air. Linton, who served as the stations first General Manager & Program Director also coined the slogan, as well as, the station call letters. The original staff consisted of Paula Sutton, Public Affairs Director, Andre Smith,Sports Director, Gospel announcer Dorothy Keith and a group of talented students. It was David Linton and Paula Sutton who shared the on-air debut honors by playing the song \\"Ain't No Stopping Us Now\\" by McFadden and Whitehead. The station call letters stand for Wonderful Radio Viking Style. In 1990 the station received several upgrades, including a new transmitter allowing an effective radiated power of 41 kW (the old transmitter now serves as a backup transmitter) as well as a new frequency of 89.9 MHz. On July 3, 1996 the station went dark for weeks due to water and smoke damage to equipment due to an electrical fire that occurred upstairs in Williams Hall. The station signed back on in October and later went to a Jazz-based format as \\"Jazzy 89-Nine\\". In 2003, the station reverted to its original and current Urban/Urban AC based format, and began broadcasting 24 hours a day. In the 1990s WRVS-FM was one of the best programmed student operated stations of its kind. WRVS-FM is Public Supported NPR Affiliated Radio Station. Its 280-foot (85 m) transmitter and studios are located on the campus of Elizabeth City State University. WRVS-FM is currently the only station in Elizabeth City that broadcasts in HD radio and is currently streaming online.

It was built in memory of the civilians killed during the Japanese occupation of Singapore during World War II. The Civilian War Memorial sits on serene parkland in the midst of busy city traffic near Singapore's Padang and City Hall. Located within the War Memorial Park at Beach Road within the Central Area, Singapore's central business district, it is usually easy to spot in most backdrops encompassing the CBD landscape. It was gazetted as a 65th national memorial on 15 August 2013. History During the Japanese Empire's occupation of Singapore, thousands of ethnic Chinese were killed in the Sook Ching massacre. In an effort to remove anti-Japanese elements in Singapore, Chinese men between the ages of 18 and 50 were to report to the Kempeitai, the Imperial Japanese Army military police. The death toll was reported to be 6,000 by the Japanese, but official estimates range between 25,000 and 50,000.. In February 1962, remains belonging to civilian victims of the Japanese occupation were unearthed in areas like Siglap, Changi and Bukit Timah. The Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCC) undertook the responsibility of gathering the remains and creating a memorial. The Civilian War Memorial project In 13 March 1963, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew set aside a plot of land at Beach Road for the building of a memorial dedicated to the civilians killed in World War II. The SCCC set up a fund committee that was later enlarged to include all ethnic groups due to good response from the community. With the support of the Government and contributions from the public, construction of the memorial was able to start. Architecture The Civilian War Memorial lit up at night The design of the memorial was conceived by one of Singapore's most renowned architects, Leong Swee Lim (1935‚Äì2002) of Swan & Maclaren Architects whom it won first prize in an open design competition in that month. The design was one of Leong's most famous and significant contributions towards Singapore's architecture. The four identical pillars, each high, represent the shared experiences and unity of the four major races of Singapore;‚Äì Chinese, Eurasian, Indian and Malay. Ground-breaking ceremony In 15 June that year, Lee Kuan Yew performed the ground-breaking ceremony of ‚Äúturning (or breaking) the sod‚Äù to lay the foundation for the memorial witnessed by a gathering of representatives from the Inter-Religious Organisation and members of the consular corps. Construction of the memorial began on 23 April 1966. A ceremony was held on 1 November that year before the completion of the memorial, which saw 606 urns containing the remains of thousands of unknown civilians from the mass graves interred on either side of the memorial podium, added to the material significance of the structure whose history it represents. Unveiling of the Memorial Pedestal of the memorial with inscriptions written in English and Tamil. The memorial was completed in January 1967 at a total construction cost of about S$500,000. On 15 February that year, the Civilian War Memorial was officially unveiled by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who laid a wreath at the memorial. The memorial is one of Singapore's iconic heritage landmarks that truly embraces the virtues of a multiracial and multicultural city, the unity of which is inevitably one of the pillars for Singapore's modern day success, harmony and prosperity. The memorial has also been affectionately described by some as resembling four giant chopsticks. Every year on 15 February (Total Defence Day in Singapore, commemorating the 1942 surrender of Singapore to the Japanese), a memorial service is held at the Civilian War Memorial to remember the victims of the war. National Monument On 15 August 2013, the Civilian War Memorial was gazetted by the National Heritage Board as 65th National Monument of Singapore.

Besni Fok is placed on the Zrenjaninski put road which connects Belgrade with the town of Zrenjanin in Vojvodina. History From the late 19th century, the area was intermittently inhabited, mostly by Hungarians and Germans. In the 1930s several drainage channels were dug, draining the area and making the permanent settlement possible. In 1947 first works on the construction began and first settlers came in 1948. The origin and the future development of Besni Fok was closely tied to the Combined Agricultural Enterprise Beograd (PKB Beograd). Originally the settlement consisted of barracks, later of concrete and brick houses, while proper residential buildings were erected in the mid-1970s. Until the 1970s, Besni Fok was statistically a separate settlement, but then it was annexed to Padinska Skela, which is located 9 km to the south, becoming its neighborhood, though they don‚Äôt make one continuous built-up area. Demography While it was a separate settlement, according to the official censuses, Besni Fok had a population of 946 in 1961 and 977 in 1971. Estimated population in 2015 was around 1,000. Characteristics Despite being a small and stagnant neighborhood, Besni Fok is quite known in the rest of Belgrade. Some of it comes from a notoriously bad communal infrastructure it has, but also because of its unusual name and popularity it gained as a fishing resort. Since 1967, Besni Fok is a location of the traditional Prvomajski uranak or \\"Labour Day early outing\\", celebration of May 1, Labour Day.Prvomajski uranak za svaƒçiji ukusOd Avale do Fru≈°ke gore It is traditionally celebrated with the large camp bonfire and a series of sport activities, including sack race, futsal, tug of war, handball and soccer matches, etc. The settlement has its own football team, ‚ÄúFK Pionir‚Äù. Eccentric footballer Sa≈°a ƒÜurƒçiƒá, who played for Aston Villa, Crystal Palace F.C. and Yugoslav national football team, grew up in Besni Fok.  Preliv  Sub-settlement of Preliv is a stretched row of some 60 houses, 2.5 to 5 kilometers away from Besni Fok. The communal situation is even worse than in the rest of Besni Fok as practically it has no waterworks, roads or even grocery stores, so out of the 60 houses, in 2012 half of them were without residents. Elementary school was closed in the late 1970s and the main road was paved only in 2007. The only economic activity in the settlement is agriculture, which makes it a rare purely rural area as most of the neighboring settlements are oriented towards the agricultural industry. The name, preliv, comes from the Serbian word for overspill.

It is operated by Indiana Michigan Power, a subsidiary of American Electric Power. History Two identical non-cyclonic Babcock & Wilcox units (1,300 MW eachRockport Power Plant on mesotheliomasymptoms.com) were launched into service in December 1984 and December 1988. They are among the largest coal units built. The plant is connected to the grid by 765 kilovolt transmission lines (the highest rated voltage used in the United States). The power plant features the tallest smokestack in Indiana, and is one of the tallest smokestacks in the world at . Coal supply The coal is delivered to the plant by barges along the Ohio River. The plant burns in excess of seven million short tons of coal a year. To minimize cost, AEP announced in February 2018 that Rockport will rely solely on coal from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. Retirement In July 2019, AEP announced that Rockport's Unit 1 will retire by the end of 2028. This was made in an agreement modification between AEP, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), several northeastern states, the Sierra Club, and other parties. The agreement allows AEP to achieve emission reduction goals while also shutting down Unit 1 without adding costly pollution control systems.

The book, published in 2004, with a second edition in 2015, aims to refute claims about religion made by another well-known professor at Oxford, Richard Dawkins. McGrath's book does not seek to demonstrate how Dawkins‚Äô claims differ from Christianity, rather, it argues that Dawkins' arguments fall far short of the logical and evidence-based reasoning that Dawkins himself espouses. Synopsis McGrath begins with an overview of evolutionary biology and Darwinist theory. He then presents Dawkins' view that the current state of scientific knowledge should lead a rational person to conclude that there is no God. McGrath argues that Dawkins fails to declare or defend several crucial assumptions or premises. McGrath also defends other conclusions in the book, including: * the scientific method cannot conclusively prove that God does or does not exist; * the theory of evolution does not necessarily entail any particular atheistic, agnostic, or Christian understanding of the world; * Dawkins' refutation of William Paley's watchmaker analogy does not equate to a refutation of God‚Äôs existence; * Dawkins' proposal that memes explain the evolutionary development of human culture is more illogical and unscientific than a clearly articulated defence of Christianity; * Dawkins is ignorant of Christian theology and mischaracterizes religious people generally. McGrath argues that Dawkins' rejection of faith is a straw man argument. According to McGrath, Dawkins‚Äô definition that faith ‚Äúmeans blind trust, in the absence of evidence‚Äù is not a Christian position. In contrast, argues McGrath, accepting Dawkins‚Äô definition would require blind trust since he offers no evidence to support it. Rather, it is based upon what McGrath calls ‚Äúan unstated and largely unexamined cluster of hidden non-scientific values and beliefs‚Äù (p. 92). McGrath then argues that Dawkins frequently violates the very tenets of evidence-based reasoning that Dawkins himself claims to uphold and use to dismiss all religious belief. Also on page 92, McGrath states \\"... Darwinism neither proves nor disproves the existence of God (unless, of course God is defined by his critics in precisely such a way...).\\" Reception In Science the sceptic Michael Shermer, reviewing this book, says Response from Dawkins In response to the book in general, and to the accusation of being ignorant of Christian theology in particular, Richard Dawkins stated: In The Dawkins Delusion?, McGrath has met that criticism, saying, that, for example, you may believe astrology to be totally false, but that if you were writing a 400+ page book denouncing it, you should have most of your facts right on the subject matter.

It is operated by the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (OVEC). History The Kyger Creek was launched into service in 1955. The plant with its five units supplied electricity for the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon, Ohio along with its sister plant, Clifty Creek Power Plant in Madison, Indiana. The plant supplied electricity Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant and sold any excess to the markets. In 2003, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) terminated the contract, making Kyger Creek to rely solely on the markets. The Kyger Creek is located downstream along the Ohio River from a much larger, newer coal-fired Gavin Power Plant. In July 2019, the State of Ohio signed into law a bill mandating FirstEnergy customers to subsidize Kyger Creek and Clifty Creek. American Electric Power (AEP), Duke Energy, and Dayton Power & Light (DP&L;) customers already subsidize these plants based on power usage. However, the bill for FirstEnergy customers to subsidize Kyger Creek was a part of a public corruption scheme revealed by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) in July 2020. Environmental mitigation When Kyger Creek was first constructed, three smokestacks were constructed to disperse emissions; mitigating the nearby area from soot and foul gases. With amendments added to the Clean Air Act in 1970, regulators pressed Kyger Creek in modernizing their outdated smokestacks. A smokestack, one of the tallest chimneys in the world was built in the mid-1970s. Pollution control systems were installed at Kyger Creek in 2001 to reduce nitrogen oxide () emissions by 80%. The implementation of two jet bubbling reactor flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) systems in 2011 reduced 98% of sulfur dioxide () emissions at Kyger Creek.

In many industries, the primary market consists of durable goods, whereas the aftermarket consists of consumable or non-durable products or services. Accordingly, the \\"aftermarket goods\\" mainly include products and services for replacement parts, upgrade, maintenance and enhancement of the use of its original equipment. Examples of durable goods and their associated aftermarket goods and services include: razor handle mounts and disposable razor blades designed to mount in that handle; computer printers and their matching printer cartridges; and new cars and optional upgrades that can be installed after the car is purchased, such as car stereos or fog lights.  Elements There are two essential elements of the aftermarket: installed base and lock-in effect.  Installed base  A certain level of installed base of original equipment customers is necessary for the sufficient demand of aftermarket products. Therefore, significant installed base normally makes aftermarket profitable as an established installed base is likely to consume the aftermarket products repeatedly over the lifespan of their durable goods.  Lock-in effect (also installed-base opportunism)  Lock-in effect or installed-base opportunism refers to the situation where the customers can only consume the aftermarket goods produced by original equipment manufacturer. The reason could be: # Compatibility between primary and aftermarket goods which requires switching costs of original equipment # contractual means which imposes penalty # provision of incentives to use specific primary and aftermarket products These two essentials, installed base and lock-in effect, make aftermarket less volatile relative to primary market and therefore more likely to be profitable.  Strategy  The most well-known aftermarket strategy model is \\"Gillette‚Äôs razor and blades business model\\" also known as \\"freebie marketing\\" whereby a product is largely discounted or even free as a loss leader in order to increase the sales of its complementary goods. In the razor and blades example, a company may sell a razor handle (in which blades can be mounted) inexpensively, with the goal of having customers buy blades to mount in the handle. With printers and ink cartridges, the company may sell the printer inexpensively, so that customers will purchase new printer cartridges and/or ink. Often the durable goods are offered at a low price (or even below marginal cost) in order to attract new customers amid competitive primary markets and the loss from the primary market will be rebated by the profits from consumables in aftermarket. In this case, an established installed base is essential to ensure sustainable business practice. Tying or bundling of aftermarket products with original equipment also could be the strategies for aftermarket.  Examples  * Inkjet printers and toner cartridges are well- known examples of original equipment and their aftermarket products. Many inkjet printer manufacturers employ technology which renders their printers compatible only with printer cartridges they also manufacture in order to increase their aftermarket profits. * Many mobile network carriers offers contracts by which consumers could get a mobile phone device for a lower price or even free in exchange for long-term network service contract. * Some automobiles only could be fixed by the specially trained engineers from the company manufacturing those cars.  Monopolisation  There have been a significant number of economic literature discussing about the aftermarket monopolisation after US Supreme Court‚Äôs 1992 decision in the case Eastman Kodak Company v. Image Technical Service. The key issue of the debate is whether the monopolisation in the aftermarket harms customers and social welfare.  Chicago school  The Chicago school economists and advocates of this approach assert that aftermarket monopolization would not be harmful for the following reasons: # The primary market and its aftermarket should be considered as a single joint market since they are to a large extent related; unless both primary and aftermarket are monopolized, there will be no anti- competitive impact in monopolizing either of them. # Consumers are rational and farsighted. They can accurately reckon the whole lifecycle cost of a product including original equipment and aftermarket costs; a supplier is not able to charge supra-competitive prices in the aftermarket or # Even if the supplier is able to charge supra-competitive prices in the aftermarket, these profits should be employed to lower the price of the original equipment in order to attract consumers in its primary market. In addition, the Chicago school argues that aftermarket monopolization enables manufacturers to afford investments into quality improvement of their original equipment; consumers may benefit from quality primary goods for lower price and overall economic efficiency therefore increases.  Post-Chicago school  In contrast to the Chicago school, the post-Chicago school asserts that the monopolization in the aftermarket could harm consumer welfare as following reasons: # The profits from the increase in prices in the monopolized aftermarket tend to outweigh the loss from the decrease in new sales in the primary market competition; exploiting installed base might be more profitable than competing in the primary market # Moreover, high switching costs of primary goods worsen the lock-in effect; monopolists have more incentives to exploit the locked-in customers with the supra-competitive pricing # Customers are not always farsighted, but myopic; they are highly focusing on the upfront costs of original equipment which allows manufacturers to exploit them by the supra- competitive pricing in the aftermarket In addition, the post-Chicago school economists argue that the primary market where the investments costs in original equipment are largely subsidized by the profits from its monopolized aftermarket tend to be anti-competitive as entry into a market will be difficult without installed base.  Consensus  Although Chicago school economists assumes that theoretically consumers are farsighted and rational, the results of a number of empirical economic literature insist that consumers are in many cases highly myopic towards the sophisticated choices. Thus, now there is consensus that aftermarket monopolization has potential harms even when consumers are fully informed about the whole lifecycle costs with the competitive primary market. Following is a list of factors making aftermarket monopolization more harmful. # High switching cost of original equipment (primary goods) # Lack of complete contracts (unclear) # A large number of uninformed customers (exploitable installed base) # Low quality information (validity) # Large aftermarket (large installed base) # High proportion of locked-in customers relative to new customers (also large installed base) # Weak competition on the primary market (easy to maximise profits) # High discount rate (incentive to exploit the installed base in order to set-off the loss from discount on primary goods)  See also  * Complementary good * Durable good Notes References Category:Marketing techniques ","title":"Aftermarket (merchandise)"},{"id":"6870125","text":"All Over the World may refer to: * All Over the World: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra, an album * All Over the World (The Seekers album), 1978 * All Over the World (JJ Weeks Band album), 2013 * \\"All Over the World\\" (Electric Light Orchestra song), 1980 * \\"All Over the World\\" (Ola song), 2010 * \\"All Over the World\\" (Fran√ßoise Hardy song), 1965 * \\"All Over the World\\", a song by Pet Shop Boys from their album Yes * \\"All Over the World\\", a song by Pixies from their album Bossanova * \\"All Over the World\\", a song by Chuck Jackson * \\"There's a Kind of Hush (All Over the World)\\", a song by Geoff Stephens and Les Reed, recorded by Herman's Hermits in 1967 and by The Carpenters in 1976 * All Over the World, 1992 album by reggae band The Wailing Souls See also * All Around the World (disambiguation) ","title":"All Over the World"},{"id":"6870129","text":"right Zurab Konstantinovich Tsereteli (, ; born January 4, 1934) is a Soviet/Russian painter, sculptor and architect known for large-scale and at times controversial monuments.

Tsereteli was then granted the position of senior master at the industrial combine of the USSR's Arts Foundation in Tbilisi, where he began to experiment with bronze, stone, glass, wood, and mosaics, as well as creating group commissions for public buildings. In 1964, he made his first trip abroad to France. He stayed in Paris for three months, during which time visited Pablo Picasso in his studio. This experience served to greatly shape his later creative production. At a later stage he also became acquainted with Marc Chagall and other Impressionist and Post-Impressionist artists, whose characteristic influences can also be seen in the artist's work. Following his return home, Tsereteli became the chief designer of Soviet resorts on the Black Sea, such as Pitsunda (1967) and Adler (1972). In these works, he combined monumental sculpture, architectural scenery, and three-dimensional mosaic compositions. Following his completion of the project in Pitsunda in 1967, Tsereteli was awarded the title of Honoured Artist of Georgia. In the 1970s, Tsereteli continued to make public projects in Tbilisi, Ulyanovsk, Yalta and other cities. In this period, Tsereteli also designed several Soviet embassies and consulates over the world, such as those in Brazil, Portugal, and Japan. In 1978‚Äì9, Tsereteli was invited to teach painting as a visiting professor at the College at Brockport, State University of New York. During his stay, he completed and presented to the college two public sculptures on the behalf of the people of the USSR: Prometheus (Light and Knowledge to the World), installed in front of the Allen Administration Building, and Joy and Happiness to All the Children of the World, placed by the Drake Memorial Library. The latter was created in collaboration with Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation in honour of the 1979 Special Olympics held in Brockport and the International Year of the Child. In 1980, Tsereteli was appointed as the chief designer for the XXII Summer Olympic Games in Moscow. That same year, he completed A Hymn to Man, which sits atop the Concert and Cinema hall of the Izmailovo Hotel Complex, constructed for the Olympics and received the Order of ‚ÄúFriendship of Peoples‚Äù. In 1981, he became a professor at his alma mater, the Tbilisi Academy of Arts. In 1983, he created Friendship Forever, in Moscow's Tishinskaya Square (1983), dedicated to the fellowship between the countries of Georgia and Russia. The architectural part of the monument was designed by Andrey Voznesensky. In the same period, Tsereteli began work on two large-scale projects in Tbilisi: the monument to Saint Nina (1988-1994), and the History of Georgia complex (1985‚Äìpresent). In 1988, Tsereteli was elected an Academician of the USSR Academy of Arts and his sculptural composition Break the Wall of Distrust was installed on Canon Street, London. In 1990, Good Defeats Evil, Tsereteli's interpretation of St. George slaying the dragon as an allegory for world peace in the modern age, was unveiled at the United Nations Headquarters. In the 1990s, Tsereteli continued to work on public commissions for the city of Moscow, which many insist was due to his personal friendship with the mayor, Yuri Luzhkov. The most significant of these projects include: the reconstruction of Cathedral of Christ the Savior, Manege Square, the War Memorial Complex on Poklonnaya Gora, the Moscow Zoo, as well as the 98m tall Peter the Great, monument erected in 1996‚Äì7, which has caused mixed feelings among the citizens of Moscow. The Birth of the New Man was inaugurated in Seville, Spain in 1995, in celebration of the European discovery of the New World by Christopher Columbus. The following year, in 1996, Marbella also received a sculpture, entitled 'Victory'. In 1997, Tsereteli was elected the President of the Russian Academy of Arts. He established the Moscow Museum of Modern Art in 1995, and it officially opened its doors in 1999, becoming the first state museum in the country entirely dedicated to modern and contemporary art. In 1998, Tsereteli had his first solo exhibition at the New Manege, which was dedicated to the memory of his wife, Inessa. This show became the starting point of the numerous travelling shows of his works, which followed in the 2000s-2010s in Russia, Georgia, Latvia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Bulgaria, Italy, France, the United States, Australia, China, and Japan. In 2001, the Gallery of Arts of Zurab Tsereteli was opened in Moscow as part of the museums and exhibitions complex of the Russian Academy of Arts. In 2006, Tsereteli unveiled his monument To the Struggle Against World Terrorism, or The Tear of Grief, in Bayonne, NJ. It was donated to the United States as an official gift by Russia in the aftermath of 9/11 attacks to show support and solidarity for the American people. In 2007, Tsereteli became the UNESCO Ambassador of Good Will. In 2009‚Äì10, he was elected a Member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts (Austria), given the title of Chevalier of the National Order of the Legion of Honor by France, as well as a 1st Rank Order ‚ÄúFor Services to the Motherland‚Äù by the Russian Federation. In 2011, he received two awards from the Roman Academy of Fine Arts: the ‚ÄúFor Life in Art‚Äù Prize and the International Giuseppe Sciacca Award for significant contribution to the arts. In 2014, Tsereteli received the UNESCO Five Continents Medal for his contribution to world culture, and in 2015 was elected a Member of the Chinese Academy of Fine Arts. In 2005, 'Holocaust' was donated by Russia to Israel and opened in Jerusalem. Some of his other works include: the sculpture of Nikolai Gogol in Rome's Villa Borghese (2002), Honor√© de Balzac in Agde (2003), Marina Tsvetaeva in St. Giles Croix de Vie (2012), Founding Fathers of the European Union (2012) in Lorraine, and the monument to Pope John Paul II (2014) next to Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral facing the Seine. Zurab Tsereteli founded the Museum of Modern Art in Tbilisi, Georgia in 2012. Despite his significant age, Zurab Tsereteli continues his service as President of the Russian Academy of Arts, organises regular exhibitions by Georgian and international artists at the Museum of Modern Art in Tbilisi, as well as continuing to produce artwork.Hill, J. (2019). Zurab Tsereteli. 1st ed. Milan: Skira, pp.92-95.  Controversy  Tsereteli has been heavily criticized throughout the duration of his career, with public opinion heavily shaped by his involvement with the Russian government. In March 2014 he was reported to have signed a letter in support of the position of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin on Russia's military intervention in Ukraine. However, the following day, a statement was released to several Georgian news outlets by the artist's aide, Sergi Shagulashvili, denied that Tsereteli signed the letter and that he \\"generally does not get involved in politics\\".  Offices  * Professor and President of the Russian Academy of Arts. * President of the Foundation for the Children's Park of Miracles (since 1988), hence the rumours of his involvement with the construction of Disneyland in Russia. * Founder of the Moscow International Foundation for Support to UNESCO, he was appointed a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador on 30 March 1996. * Since 2005 he has been a member of the Public Chamber of Russia. * Eminent Member of the Sergio Vieira de Mello Foundation.  Projects  The Birth of a New Man in Seville * The statue of Peter the Great in downtown Moscow which, at 94 meters, is the eighth tallest statue in the world. Popular legend states that the Statue was initially of Christopher Columbus, but that after being rejected by the US Government, its head was replaced, and it was sold to the Russian government as a nautical statue of Peter the Great. In November 2008, it was voted the tenth ugliest building in the world by Virtual Tourist. * A statue known as Birth of the New World depicting Christopher Columbus. The statue was rejected by the US government when Tsereteli attempted to have it installed there in 1992, in connection with the 500th anniversary of his voyage. The municipal government of Cata√±o, Puerto Rico, consented to having the statue built in their town, but later was unable to garner enough public support and funding. On August 15, 2008, the private contractor in charge of building a series of facilities for the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games announced that the corporation had bought the structure and will build it in the municipality of Mayag√ºez, expecting to assemble it in time for the games. After this project was abandoned, the statue was moved to the municipality of Arecibo, where its assembly began during the spring of 2014. The statue was unveiled in Arecibo on June 14, 2016. A smaller twin statue named The Birth of a New Man was given by Russia in 1993 and was assembled in Seville, where it is popularly known as Huevo de Col√≥n (Columbus' Egg). * The statue of St. George at the Moscow War Memorial and several versions of the same subject in Moscow and elsewhere. The foremost among these is a sculpture using sections of scrapped US Pershing II and Soviet SS-20 nuclear missiles. The sculpture, entitled Good Defeats Evil is on the grounds of the UN building in New York City. The sculpture is a 39 foot high, 40 ton monumental bronze statue of St George fighting the dragon of nuclear war. It was donated to the UN by the Soviet Union in 1990. * A 9-1/2 meter tall, 2 metric ton treble clef covered in mozaic gold that tops the cupola of the Moscow International House of Music. The sculpture rotates like a weathervane. * His Tear of Grief (actually titled To the Struggle Against World Terrorism) features a 40-foot teardrop suspended in the fissure of a 106-foot bronze rectangular tower. The monument includes the names of all the victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York, Washington D.C., and Pennsylvania, as well as the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center. At the ground breaking for the massive project, Vladimir Putin was present and called the sculpture ‚Äúa gift from the people of Russia.‚Äù It was erected at the tip of the decommissioned Military Ocean Terminal, now rechristened The Peninsula at Bayonne Harbor, in Bayonne, New Jersey (after nearby Jersey City first accepted, then declined, the free monument) and was dedicated on September 11, 2006. The artist, Bill Clinton, Michael Chertoff, New Jersey Senator Jon Corzine, and a 9/11 widow all spoke at the dedication ceremony. * On September 25, 2006, another Peter the Great statue by Tsereteli was installed on Vasilievsky Island, St. Petersburg, in front of the Pribaltiiskaya Hotel. The sculptor had originally wished it to be placed in front of the historic Manege next to St. Isaac's Cathedral, but this was turned down because of risk of damage to Quarenghi's building. *The Chronicle of Georgia (or History Memorial of Georgia) * Other offers of statuary by Tsereteli rejected by intended recipients in recent years include a statue of Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill next to Livadia Palace in Yalta (Ukraine), Magellan (Uruguay), the Colossus of Rhodes (Greece), Franklin D. Roosevelt (New York) and Balzac (France).Pulse magazine, St. Petersburg, October 2006  Cultural activities  Tsereteli heads many cultural projects as a president of the Russian Academy of Arts Honours and awards * Hero of Socialist Labour, Order of Lenin and Gold medal \\"Hammer and Sickle\\" (11 November 1990) - for his great personal contribution to the development of Soviet art and productive social activities * Order of Merit for the Fatherland; **1st class (26 July 2010) - for outstanding contribution to the development of fine arts and many years of creative activity **2nd class (4 January 2006) - for outstanding contribution to the development of fine arts **3rd class (29 April 1996) - for his great personal contribution to the development and successful completion of a complex of works on the Victory Monument, Poklonnaya Hill, Moscow * Order of Friendship of Peoples (1994) * People's Artist of the Russian Federation (4 January 1994) - for great achievements in the field of fine arts * People's Artist of the USSR (1980) * People's Artist of Georgia (1978) * Russian Federation State Prize in Literature and Art (21 June 1996) - a memorial \\"Monument of Victory in Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945\\" on Poklonnaya Hill in Moscow * Lenin Prize (1976) - for the space-decorations Children's Zone a resort town in Adler (1973) * USSR State Prize **1970 - for the mosaic composition of Lenin memorial in Ulyanovsk (1969) and in the Palace of Trade Unions Tbilisi (1969‚Äì1970) **1982 - for participation in the creation of the hotel complex \\"Izmailovo\\" in Moscow (1980) * Chevalier of the Legion of Honour (France, 2010) * Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters (France, 2005) * Medal \\"Astana\\" (Kazakhstan, 11 December 1998) * Badge \\"For Services to Moscow\\" (Moscow, 30 December 2003) - for his great personal contribution to the development of fine art, many years of fruitful activity for the city and the Muscovites * Order of Akhmad Kadyrov (Chechnya, 2005) - for his personal contribution to the commemoration of the first president of the Chechen Republic, the Hero of Russia Akhmad-Hadji Kadyrov, activities that promote peace, friendship and cooperation between peoples * Medal \\"In Praise of Ossetia\\" (North Ossetia, 2010) References *UNESCO participation *Moscow news: Zurab Disney Or Walt Tsereteli? *Artnet Magazine, July 10, 2006 *moscow- life.com External links * * The official site of To the Struggle Against World Terrorism monument by Zurab Tsereteli * Artwork by Zurab Tsereteli at The Cold War Museum * Good Defeats Evil at the New York Public Art Curriculum * Monument to Peter the First from Inside and Above.

Practical use of a column store versus a row store differs little in the relational DBMS world. Both columnar and row databases can use traditional database query languages like SQL to load data and perform queries. Both row and columnar databases can become the backbone in a system to serve data for common extract, transform, load (ETL) and data visualization tools. However, by storing data in columns rather than rows, the database can more precisely access the data it needs to answer a query rather than scanning and discarding unwanted data in rows. Description Background A relational database management system provides data that represents a two-dimensional table, of columns and rows. For example, a database might have this table: {  - ! RowId ! EmpId ! Lastname ! Firstname ! Salary -  001  10  Smith  Joe  60000 -  002  12  Jones  Mary  80000 -  003  11  Johnson  Cathy  94000 -  004  22  Jones  Bob  55000 } This simple table includes an employee identifier (EmpId), name fields (Lastname and Firstname) and a salary (Salary). This two-dimensional format is an abstraction. In an actual implementation, storage hardware requires the data to be serialized into one form or another. The most expensive operations involving hard disks are seeks. In order to improve overall performance, related data should be stored in a fashion to minimize the number of seeks. This is known as locality of reference, and the basic concept appears in a number of different contexts. Hard disks are organized into a series of blocks of a fixed size, typically enough to store several rows of the table. By organizing the table's data so rows fit within these blocks, and grouping related rows onto sequential blocks, the number of blocks that need to be read or sought is minimized in many cases, along with the number of seeks. A survey by Pinnecke et al. covers techniques for column-/row hybridization as of 2017. Row-oriented systems A common method of storing a table is to serialize each row of data, like this: 001:10,Smith,Joe,60000; 002:12,Jones,Mary,80000; 003:11,Johnson,Cathy,94000; 004:22,Jones,Bob,55000; As data is inserted into the table, it is assigned an internal ID, the \`rowid\` that is used internally in the system to refer to data. In this case the records have sequential \`rowid\`s independent of the user-assigned \`empid\`. In this example, the DBMS uses short integers to store \`rowid\`s. In practice, larger numbers, 64-bit or 128-bit, are normally used. Row-based systems are designed to efficiently return data for an entire row, or record, in as few operations as possible. This matches the common use-case where the system is attempting to retrieve information about a particular object, say the contact information for a user in a rolodex system, or product information for an online shopping system. By storing the record's data in a single block on the disk, along with related records, the system can quickly retrieve records with a minimum of disk operations. Row-based systems are not efficient at performing set-wide operations on the whole table, as opposed to a small number of specific records. For instance, in order to find all records in the example table with salaries between 40,000 and 50,000, the DBMS would have to fully scan through the entire table looking for matching records. While the example table shown above will likely fit in a single disk block, a table with even a few hundred rows would not, and multiple disk operations would be needed to retrieve the data and examine it. To improve the performance of these sorts of operations (which are very common, and generally the point of using a DBMS), most DBMSs support the use of database indexes, which store all the values from a set of columns along with \`rowid\` pointers back into the original table. An index on the salary column would look something like this: 55000:004; 60000:001; 80000:002; 94000:003; As they store only single pieces of data, rather than entire rows, indexes are generally much smaller than the main table stores. Scanning this smaller set of data reduces the number of disk operations. If the index is heavily used, it can dramatically reduce the time for common operations. However, maintaining indexes adds overhead to the system, especially when new data is written to the database. Records not only need to be stored in the main table, but any attached indexes have to be updated as well. The main reason why indexes dramatically improve performance on large datasets is that database indexes on one or more columns are typically sorted by value, which makes range queries operations (like the above \\"find all records with salaries between 40,000 and 50,000\\" example) very fast (lower time-complexity). A number of row-oriented databases are designed to fit entirely in RAM, an in-memory database. These systems do not depend on disk operations, and have equal-time access to the entire dataset. This reduces the need for indexes, as it requires the same amount of operations to fully scan the original data as a complete index for typical aggregation purposes. Such systems may be therefore simpler and smaller, but can only manage databases that will fit in memory. Column-oriented systems A column-oriented database serializes all of the values of a column together, then the values of the next column, and so on. For our example table, the data would be stored in this fashion: 10:001,12:002,11:003,22:004; Smith:001,Jones:002,Johnson:003,Jones:004; Joe:001,Mary:002,Cathy:003,Bob:004; 60000:001,80000:002,94000:003,55000:004; In this layout, any one of the columns more closely matches the structure of an index in a row-based system. This may cause confusion that can lead to the mistaken belief a column- oriented store \\"is really just\\" a row-store with an index on every column. However, it is the mapping of the data that differs dramatically. In a row- oriented indexed system, the primary key is the rowid that is mapped from indexed data. In the column-oriented system, the primary key is the data, which is mapped from rowids. This may seem subtle, but the difference can be seen in this common modification to the same store wherein the two \\"Jones\\" items, above, are compressed into a single item with two rowids: ‚Ä¶;Smith:001;Jones:002,004;Johnson:003;‚Ä¶ Whether or not a column-oriented system will be more efficient in operation depends heavily on the workload being automated. Operations that retrieve all the data for a given object (the entire row) are slower. A row-based system can retrieve the row in a single disk read, whereas numerous disk operations to collect data from multiple columns are required from a columnar database. However, these whole-row operations are generally rare. In the majority of cases, only a limited subset of data is retrieved. In a rolodex application, for instance, collecting the first and last names from many rows to build a list of contacts is far more common than reading all data for any single address. This is even more true for writing data into the database, especially if the data tends to be \\"sparse\\" with many optional columns. For this reason, column stores have demonstrated excellent real-world performance in spite of many theoretical disadvantages. Partitioning, indexing, caching, views, OLAP cubes, and transactional systems such as write-ahead logging or multiversion concurrency control all dramatically affect the physical organization of either system. That said, online transaction processing (OLTP)-focused RDBMS systems are more row-oriented, while online analytical processing (OLAP)-focused systems are a balance of row-oriented and column-oriented.  Benefits  Comparisons between row-oriented and column-oriented databases are typically concerned with the efficiency of hard-disk access for a given workload, as seek time is incredibly long compared to the other bottlenecks in computers. For example, a typical Serial ATA (SATA) hard drive has an average seek time of between 16 and 22 milliseconds while DRAM access on an Intel Core i7 processor takes on average 60 nanoseconds, nearly 400,000 times as fast. Clearly, disk access is a major bottleneck in handling big data. Columnar databases boost performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be read from disk, both by efficiently compressing the similar columnar data and by reading only the data necessary to answer the query. In practice, columnar databases are well-suited for OLAP-like workloads (e.g., data warehouses) which typically involve highly complex queries over all data (possibly petabytes). However, some work must be done to write data into a columnar database. Transactions (INSERTs) must be separated into columns and compressed as they are stored, making it less suited for OLTP workloads. Row-oriented databases are well-suited for OLTP- like workloads which are more heavily loaded with interactive transactions. For example, retrieving all data from a single row is more efficient when that data is located in a single location (minimizing disk seeks), as in row- oriented architectures. However, column-oriented systems have been developed as hybrids capable of both OLTP and OLAP operations. Some of the OLTP constraints, faced by such column-oriented systems, are mediated using (amongst other qualities) in-memory data storage. Column-oriented systems suitable for both OLAP and OLTP roles effectively reduce the total data footprint by removing the need for separate systems.  Compression  Column data is of uniform type; therefore, there are some opportunities for storage size optimizations available in column-oriented data that are not available in row-oriented data. For example, many popular modern compression schemes, such as LZW or run-length encoding, make use of the similarity of adjacent data to compress. Missing values and repeated values, common in clinical data, can be represented by a two-bit marker. While the same techniques may be used on row-oriented data, a typical implementation will achieve less effective results. To improve compression, sorting rows can also help. For example, using bitmap indexes, sorting can improve compression by an order of magnitude.Daniel Lemire, Owen Kaser, Kamel Aouiche, \\"Sorting improves word-aligned bitmap indexes\\", Data & Knowledge Engineering, Volume 69, Issue 1 (2010), pp. 3-28. To maximize the compression benefits of the lexicographical order with respect to run-length encoding, it is best to use low-cardinality columns as the first sort keys.Daniel Lemire and Owen Kaser, Reordering Columns for Smaller Indexes, Information Sciences 181 (12), 2011 For example, given a table with columns sex, age, name, it would be best to sort first on the value sex (cardinality of two), then age (cardinality of <128), then name. Columnar compression achieves a reduction in disk space at the expense of efficiency of retrieval. The greater adjacent compression achieved, the more difficult random-access may become, as data might need to be uncompressed to be read. Therefore, column-oriented architectures are sometimes enriched by additional mechanisms aimed at minimizing the need for access to compressed data.  History  Column stores or transposed files have been implemented from the early days of DBMS development. TAXIR was the first application of a column-oriented database storage system with focus on information-retrieval in biology in 1969. Clinical data from patient records with many more attributes than could be analyzed were processed in 1975 and after by a time-oriented database system (TODS). Statistics Canada implemented the RAPID system in 1976 and used it for processing and retrieval of the Canadian Census of Population and Housing as well as several other statistical applications. RAPID was shared with other statistical organizations throughout the world and used widely in the 1980s. It continued to be used by Statistics Canada until the 1990s. Another column-oriented database was SCSS.already on the market by September 1977 Later column-oriented database packages included: * 1993: KDB * 1995: Sybase IQ Since about 2004 there have been additional open source and commercial implementations. MonetDB was released under an open-source license on September 30, 2004, followed closely by the now defunct C-Store. C-store was a university project that eventually, with team member Michael Stonebraker staying on, led to Vertica, which he co-founded in 2005. The MonetDB-related X100 project evolved into VectorWise. Druid is a column-oriented data store that was open-sourced in late 2012 and is now used by numerous organizations. Classic Relational DBMS can use column-oriented strategies by mixing row- oriented and column-oriented tables. Despite the DBMS complexity, this approach has proven to be valuable from the years 2010 to present. For example in 2014 Citusdata introduced column-oriented tables for PostgreSQLhttps://github.com/citusdata/cstore_fdw/graphs/contributors and McObject added support for columnar storage with its release of eXtremeDB Financial Edition in 2012 which was then used to establish a new standard of performance for the independently audited STAC-M3 benchmark.

Visitors have to stop at the plant's gate and have a security guard escort them to the cemetery. The cemetery was part of a larger tract of land owned by the Yellow Dirt Baptist Church (founded 1872). When the church building and land was sold to Georgia Power, in 1971, the church (now Lighthouse Baptist Church of Franklin, Georgia) and congregation retained ownership to a two-acre parcel which including the cemetery. Problems eventually arose, however, when Georgia Power employees attempted to assert control over the private two-acre parcel. In September 2011, a Georgia Power employee entered the cemetery and removed seven Confederate flags placed on the graves of Confederate veterans. The flags were replaced in October 2011 by the local Sons of Confederate Veterans, but were subsequently removed again by employees of the utility based on a company policy prohibiting the display of \\"offensive materials\\" on company property.Sons of Confederacy Replace Flags on Graves, Georgia Power Removed Them Members of the church congregation, some of whom had Confederate ancestors buried in the cemetery, protested. Congregation members asserting their property rights to the cemetery, stating that the flags were not placed on company property and that Georgia Power had no right to interfere with the practice. Georgia Power conceded the matter after company attorneys completed a title search in November 2011.

Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia owned Wansley Unit 9 consists of three combined-cycle gas-powered generators: CT1 and CT2, rated at 171 MWe each, and ST1, rated at 226 MWe. All of them were launched into service in 2004. Coal delivery Coal is delivered via Norfolk Southern Railway Company unit coal trains 100-cars long, each carrying 10,000 tons of coal. At the plant, an automated unloading trestle empties the train in about 30 minutes and conveyor belts move the coal to the storage pile or the storage bunkers inside the plant. The bunkers hold a 14-hour reserve; the coal pile target inventory is a 32-day supply. Coal is coarsely crushed at the mine then crushed again at the plant as it travels to the storage bunkers inside the boiler house. A pulverizer below each bunker grinds the coal to a fine powder that is mixed with air and blown into the boiler through a network of pipes. With both units at full load, Plant Wansley burns about 14,000 tons of coal every 24 hours. Annual consumption averages four to five million tons. Cooling water Cooling water is taken up from the \\"service water pond\\", created by damming a small creek flowing from the north-west into the Chattahoochee River immediately on the south-eastern side of the plant. At coal-fired units 1 and 2, water is converted to steam at temperature and pressure. At full 920 MWe load, each turbine processes of steam per hour. Low- pressure steam exits the turbine into a condenser where it is cooled and converted back into the water to repeat the cycle. During this cooling process required by the second law of thermodynamics, waste heat from the condensing steam is absorbed by the warm water that circulates through the cooling towers, where it cools by evaporation and forced convection of air. Environment Electrostatic precipitators on units 1 and 2 remove more than 99% of the fly ash from the boiler exhaust stream. A digital boiler control system, low NOx burners, and selective catalytic reactors, installed since the initial operation, have reduced nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions by almost 90%. The use of cooling towers and the closed-loop steam cycle prevent thermal pollution in the Chattahoochee River. Wet scrubbers and hydrated lime injection systems remove almost all sulphur oxides from the flue gas as well.

He joined the U.S. Army under the Americanized named Henry Beeger in 1846 and served in the Mexican War. In the 2nd U.S. Artillery he rose to the rank of sergeant on August 21, 1846 but deserted the army four and a half years later on January 20, 1851. Sometime before 1861 he changed his name to Henry Bertram, presumably to escape any connections to his earlier army desertion. On June 29, 1861, under his new name, Bertram enlisted in the 3rd Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry as a first lieutenant. By July 31, 1861 he had risen to lieutenant colonel of the 20th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry. Bertram and the 20th Wisconsin first saw action at the battle of Newtonia. In early December 1862, Bertram found himself as the senior ranking officer in his brigade, though only a lieutenant colonel.20th Wisconsin He assumed command of the 1st Brigade in Francis Herron's 3rd Division of the Army of the Frontier. and was in command at the battle of Prairie Grove. Though Bertram clung to the title of brigade commander during the battle, he realistically commanded no more than the 430 men of his own 20th Wisconsin regiment as the other regiments in his command were detached for temporary assignment elsewhere. On December 10, 1862 Bertram was promoted to colonel. Despite his promotion he returned to regimental command during the siege of Vicksburg. He commanded brigades in the Department of the Gulf after the fall of Vicksburg. In August 1864 his brigade was transferred to the Mobile Bay Land Forces under the command of Gordon Granger. There Bertram participated in the land operations during the battle of Mobile Bay against Fort Morgan. He briefly commanded the District of Southern Alabama before returning to brigade command. His brigade, now part of the XIII Corps, fought in the battle of Spanish Fort. He received a brevet promotion to Brig. Gen. of U.S. Volunteers, backdated to March 13, 1865.

Sammis Power Plant is 2.2-gigawatt (2,220 MW) a coal power plant in Stratton, Ohio, in Jefferson County, Ohio. The plant is operated by Energy Harbor. It began operations in 1960. History Ohio Edison broke ground for W.H. Sammis in May 1956. The plan originally called for the construction of two, 170 MW units. In September 1956, Ohio Edison announced they would double the facility with two additional units also at 170 MW each. The first four units of Sammis were finished between 1960 and 1962 at cost of $118 million. It was dedicated in 1960 for Ohio Edison president and CEO, Walter H. Sammis. Units 5 was completed in 1967. Unit 6 began operations in 1969 at a cost of $75 million. The unit had an operating capacity of 625 MW. During construction of Unit 6, its stator, constructed by Westinghouse, was featured on the cover in a March 1967 issue of Forbes. Unit 7, with an operating capacity of 650 MW, began operations in 1971. Unit 7's chimney had a height of . The power plant includes a four-lane tunnel for State Route 7, constructed in 1982 at a cost of $27 million. The road goes under the baghouse structure. FirstEnergy assumed operations of Sammis after the former operator, Ohio Edison merged with Centerior in 1997. Due to low wholesale power prices in 2012 exacerbated by the supply of natural gas, FirstEnergy temporarily idled Sammis. It was announced in July 2016 that FirstEnergy would retire its four oldest units of Sammis in 2020 due to increasing costs and market forces. Only 1,500 (MW) from three units would remain generating electricity. FirstEnergy Solutions had announced in August 2018 that they will shut down the three remaining units at Sammis by June 2022. FirstEnergy Solutions blamed the wholesale market system, which PJM Interconnection operates on, for not relying on coal and nuclear plants. Murray Energy, a supplier of coal for Sammis, floated the possibility of buying the plant and to continue operating it. Ultimately, the retirements of the final three units were rescinded in July 2019 when the State of Ohio passed and signed into law a subsidy to support FirstEnergy Solutions' Perry Nuclear Generating Station and Davis‚ÄìBesse Nuclear Power Station. However, the bill itself was a part of a public corruption scheme revealed by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) in July 2020. Environmental mitigation Sammis was subjected to a suit by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for violating the Clean Air Act in 1978. The EPA charged that Ohio Edison was emitting 50 times more pollution than allotted at Sammis. Ohio Edison reached a settlement with the EPA to implement pollution controls. To resolve the persistent pollution issues raised by the EPA, Ohio Edison constructed a $445 million structure for electrostatic precipitators on top of tunnel over State Route 7. Sammis was again the subject of another Clean Air Act case by the EPA filed in 1999. To satisfy the EPA's request to reduce air pollution, FirstEnergy commissioned a $1.8 billion construction project in 2005. Construction was designed and managed by Bechtel. The plant was retrofitted with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems and scrubbers by Babcock & Wilcox to reduce sulfur dioxide () and nitrogen oxide () emissions by 95% and 90% respectively. A new chimney for the flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) process was constructed to support the scrubbers. The project was completed in 2010.

Internal RAM (Random Access Memory)   History of Random Access Memory (RAM)  Earlier forms of what we have today as DRAM started as Drum memory which was an early form of memory for computers. The drum would have to be pre-loaded with data and small heads in the drum would read and write the pre- loaded information. After drum memory came Magnetic-core memory which would store information using the polarity of ferrite donuts' magnetic fields. Through these early trial and errors of computing memory, the final result was Dynamic Random Access Memory which we use today in our devices. Dynamic Random Access Memory or (RAM) was first invented in 1968 by Robert Dennard. He was born in Texas and is an engineer who created one of the first models of (RAM) which was first called Dynamic Random Access Memory. His invention led to computers being able to reach a new era of technological advancement.  General Information about RAM  Random Access Memory is memory storage that if found in electronic devices such as computers. It hold data while the computer is on so that it can be quickly accessed by the CPU or (Central Processing Unit). Ram is different from regular storage units such as Hard Disks, Solid State Drives, and Solid State Hybrid Drives. While these types of drives hold much permanent information, RAM holds temporary, yet important, information for the computer to receive. While using very minimal programs such as a browser or having a couple of programs open, a RAM is working so that it can load up small tasks like these. However when opening up bigger programs and more tabs for a computer to work harder the information is shifted from the RAM to other drives such as the hard disk.  Technical Properties of RAM  Generally, IRAM is composed of very high speed SRAM located alongside of the CPU. It acts similar to a CPU cache, but is software addressable. This saves transistors and power, and is potentially much faster, but forces programmers to specifically allocate it in order to benefit. In contrast, cache is invisible to the programmer. Associated with speed, the more RAM there is in the system, the faster the computer can run, because it allows the RAM to run more information through to the computer's (CPU). Not only does adding more RAM to a computer help it run faster, it helps boots up a computer immensely faster compared to booting up a system with less RAM. Another important factor of speed has to do with how fast transfer rate speeds are. For example a stick of RAM that has only 512 megabytes of transfer speed is too slow compared to a stick of RAM that has 16 gigabytes of transfer speeds. Not only does the transfer speeds depend of how fast a RAM can process information, the type of stick of RAM depends as well. For example, there are sticks that can be DDR3 and DDR4. Between these two models the DDR3 is a lot older and has slower speed compared to DDR4 which most computer run nowadays. Just recently, there was an announcement that a DDR5 stick of ram would be released sometime in 2020. The DDR5 ram would use less power and would have double the bandwidth compared to the DDR4 RAM.

The incident is described as the first Palestinian suicide attack despite the fact that the attacker survived. Attack On 6 July 1989, Egged commuter bus line No. 405 began its regular route from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. When the bus passed Neve Ilan, Ghanim attacked the driver, seized the steering wheel of the bus and pulled the bus over a steep precipice into a ravine in the area of Qiryat Ye'arim. The driver was unable to stabilize the bus; as a result the vehicle rolled down the depth of the ravine and caught fire. Some of the passengers were burned alive. Sixteen civilians were killed in the attack, including two Canadians and one American, and 27 were wounded. Students from the Telz-Stone yeshiva who heard the screaming rushed to the scene to administer first aid. One of them, Yehuda Meshi Zahav, went on to found ZAKA, a volunteer rescue service organization. Perpetrator The perpetrator, who survived the crash, received medical treatment for his injuries in an Israeli hospital. After the attack, it was revealed that the perpetrator was a 25-year-old Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant named Abd al-Hadi Rafa Ghanim who originated from the Nusseirat refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. Ghanim was convicted and given 16 life sentences for murder, hijacking and terrorism.

Over the course of her screen career, Mersereau appeared in over 100 short and silent film features. Early life Mersereau was born in New York City and had a younger sister, Claire (1894-1982). Mersereau's father died when she was 9 years old. Mersereau's maternal grandmother, Mme. Luzanzie, had been a noted stage actress in France. While Mersereau's own mother had acting aspirations, she never pursued a career in acting but decided to allow her children to begin acting.  Career  At the age of 8, Mersereau played child parts in repertory theatre. She toured with Margaret Anglin and portrayed the role of \\"Flora\\" in the original company of The Clansman.Waterbury 1917 p.41 The play continued to show for three years. During her time as a stage actress, Mersereau was given the nickname \\"The Child Wonder\\". She also starred on the touring production of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm and then became a screen actress. The Narrow Path (1916) In 1908, Mersereau made her first film for the Biograph Company. She stayed with the company until 1911. Mersereau then signed with Independent Moving Pictures where she appeared in ingenue roles. She found success with these roles and was often cast as innocent young helpless girls which was a popular staple in films at the time. When Independent Moving Pictures and several other studios merged to form Universal Pictures, Mersereau continued working for Universal. During this time, Mersereau appeared in several short films alongside William Garwood (who often directed the films).Doyle 1995 p.28 In 1916, Carl Laemmle decided to open one of his eastern United States studios for Mersereau's own productions. Laemmle engaged Oscar A. C. Lund to direct her in these features. Mersereau had always exhibited a distinct preference for working in the East, and disliked California. Among her most successful ventures for Blue Bird and Universal include The Boy Girl (1917), Morgan's Raiders (1918), Little Miss Nobody (1917), Susan's Gentleman (1917), The Honor of Mary Blake (1916), Souls United (1917), Autumn (1916), and The Little Terror (1917). The most acclaimed project of Mersereau's final period was Nero (1922), directed by J. Gordon Edwards, grandfather of Blake Edwards. she continued in motion pictures into the 1920s with her final film being The Wives of the Prophet (1926), in which she had the role of Alma.  Personal life  Mersereau died on November 12, 1975 in Plymouth, Massachusetts, at the age of 83.

He was a former Lord Mayor of Belfast as well as the longest serving member of Belfast City Council, having represented the Upper Shankill Road area since 1973. Smyth was awarded the Order of the British Empire in the 1996 New Year's Honours list. Emergence in politics Born in the Woodvale Road district of the Shankill Road area of Belfast, Smyth was one of nine children and was educated locally and worked as a metal bonder in the Short Brothers factory before entering full-time politics. Smyth first came to attention in the early 1970s when he served as a public spokesman for the Ulster Volunteer ForceJim Cusack & Henry McDonald, UVF, Dublin: Poolbeg, 1997, p. 103 although he was not an active member of the organisation.Ronnie Hanna, The Union: Essays on Ireland and the British Connection, Newtownards: Colourpoint, 2001, pp. 81‚Äì82 His inspiration for politics was the struggle his father endured whilst working to support his family. Deeply opposed to what he described as 'Big House Unionism', he stated that at that time Belfast City Council was composed mostly of upper class unionists who sought to obstruct working class council members by holding council meetings during the daytime, when working class councillors were required to be at work.\\"PUP man Hugh Smyth who scorned Big House unionism and rose to rank of Lord Mayor\\", belfasttelegraph.co.uk; accessed 4 March 2015. He was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 1973 under the label of Independent Unionist, a well-established term used in Northern Irish politics for unionists outside the major unionist parties. While serving in the Assembly, Smyth was claimed by the UVF as a member of the Ulster Loyalist Front, a political arm that the group had established in October 1973. Although it revealed some policies, including increased use of referenda, worker cooperative initiatives, improvements in social care, and alterations to the educational and social housing systems, the group disappeared almost immediately and Smyth retained his independent designation.Cusack & McDonald, UVF, p. 126. He also joined its successor group, the Volunteer Political Party, when it was formed, but this group also made no impact and dissolved soon afterwards.Henry Sinnerton, David Ervine: Uncharted Waters, Dublin: Brandon, 2002, p. 118 Smyth was also elected to the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention in 1975, once again as an Independent Unionist. Smyth remained close to the UVF. On 2 October 1975, he accompanied a UVF delegation to a meeting with leading figures from the Northern Ireland Office.Cusack & McDonald, UVF, p. 165. Progressive unionist Smyth and some like-minded followers came together in 1978 under the name Independent Unionist Group, a more formalised alliance of working-class independent unionists based in Belfast of which Smyth was leader. The group was close to the UVF. This group would change its name to the Progressive Unionist Party the following year as a response to the growing Ulster nationalism within the Ulster Defence Association, with Smyth and his fellow founders fearing that their description as \\"independent Unionists\\" might lead to them being associated with independence to which they were opposed. Smyth was close to leading UVF member Gusty Spence, who had become a supporter of political methods, and the two worked to recruit David Ervine to the PUP after being impressed by his ability as a speaker.Sinnerton, David Ervine, pp. 109‚Äì110 Hoping to gain some understanding of his republican opponents, Smyth was one of only two unionist politicians to accept an offer to visit Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) inmates in Long Kesh in the early 1980s (the other was John Carson).Roy Garland, Gusty Spence, Belfast: Blackstaff Press, 2001, p. 248. As leader of the PUP, Smyth ran as a candidate for West Belfast in the elections to the 1982 Assembly although he failed to take the seat and the PUP as a whole did not gain any representation. Although Smyth managed to build up a strong personal following on the Shankill Road, this did not transfer to the rest of the PUP which enjoyed little success elsewhere, barring a single member's election to Carrickfergus Borough Council in 1985 and 1989, until after the 1994 ceasefire.Hanna, The Union, p. 77. Belfast City Council Smyth was first elected to the council in 1972 as representative for the Shankill ward. He won a by-election resulting from the resignation of John McQuade, and beat James Brown of the Ulster Unionist Party and David Robb of the Ulster Constitution Party in a three-way contest. In the election, he received the support of McQuade's party, the Democratic Unionists.The Troubles #13 (May 1972), pp. 31, 37. Following a change in council structure, he was re-elected the following year for \\"Area E\\" which included the Glencairn, Woodvale, Ballysillan, Highfield, Legoniel and Ardoyne areas. He subsequently represented the Court electoral area which covered Glencairn, Highfield, Woodvale and the mid and lower Shankill areas.COUNCILLOR HUGH SMYTH CV Smyth was appointed as Alderman in 1978, receiving the same honour in 1985, 1989 and 1993. In 1983 he was chosen as deputy mayor and served in this capacity again in 1993 before being appointed as Lord Mayor in June 1994. He again served as deputy mayor in 2001. As a councillor Smyth had been willing to oppose the main unionist parties on some issues, as he demonstrated in 1991 when he helped to overturn a ban on government ministers visiting Belfast City Hall, an initiative passed by unionist councillors in 1985 as a reaction to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.W.D. Flackes & Sydney Elliott, Northern Ireland: A Political Directory 1968‚Äì1993, Belfast: Blackstaff Press, 1994, p. 305. Ceasefire and after Following the 1994 ceasefire by the Combined Loyalist Military Command, of which the UVF was a member, Smyth became an important figure in the negotiations that followed, accompanying Ervine and Ulster Democratic Party representatives Gary McMichael and John White to 10 Downing Street in June 1996 for a meeting designed to prevent the collapse of the ceasefire.Peter Taylor, Loyalists, London: Bloomsbury, 2000, p. 241 Indeed, Spence has claimed that Smyth personally held a number of individual meetings with John Major in the aftermath of the ceasefire.Garland, Gusty Spence, p. 285 The same year Smyth was elected to the Northern Ireland Forum, along with Ervine, as \\"top-up\\" members on account of the PUP finishing in seventh place overall.Sinnerton, David Ervine, p. 187 Following his election Smyth clashed with UK Unionist Party leader Robert McCartney who, like Smyth, was born in Belfast's Shankill Road. McCartney suggested that the two were thus similar but for one thing ‚Äì McCartney had got out, a rebuke to Smyth and the run-down and deprived state of the Shankill area.Susan McKay, Northern Protestants: An Unsettled People, Belfast: Blackstaff Press, 2005, p. 42 Around this time he also criticised the DUP. Referring to the scene of an IRA bomb attack in 1972 at the Four Step Inn where he was helping retrieve bodies from the rubble, Ian Paisley approached him and said \\"Your worries are over. I have just formed the DUP. Everything is going to be all right\\". Smyth was unimpressed and remarked \\"but another 3000 people are dead and buried and what has the DUP done. It has done nothing.\\"David McKittrick, Lost Lives Mainstream Publishing 2006, p. 103 In the 1997 general election Smyth stood as PUP candidate in South Antrim where his 9% vote share was seen as a respectable result in what had been a traditionally solid Ulster Unionist Party seat.Sinnerton, David Ervine, p. 194 Smyth gave up leadership of the PUP in 2002 with Ervine chosen as his successor.Joanne McEvoy, The Politics of Northern Ireland, Edinburgh University Press, 2008, p. 62 He was subsequently a candidate in the Northern Ireland Assembly elections of 2003 and 2007 in his home constituency of West Belfast although the party did not contest the seat in 2011. However Smyth successfully defended his council seat in the 2011 local elections.Council election results Smyth was not due to be a candidate for the 2014 local electionsElection 2014 , belfastcity.gov.uk; accessed 4 March 2015. having announced his retirement from politics due to ill health in late 2013.Former PUP leader and ex-Lord Mayor of Belfast Hugh Smyth dies, belfasttelegraph.co.uk; accessed 4 March 2015.

Facility The station generates enough electricity to light 17 million 100-watt bulbs. The facility consists of two steam turbines, which began commercial operation in 1970 and 1971, and two cooling towers. The main turbines run on steam produced by twin year-around 850 MWe boilers, each as tall as a 14-story building. The plant uses more than 4 million tons of coal each year. Conemaugh has two hyperbolic natural draft cooling towers which provide recirculating water to cool and condense the steam and to limit the amount of water needed from the river. The plant is one of several in the area, situated near Pennsylvania deep mines and is basically a twin of the Keystone Generating Station, partially owned by PSEG Power. Controlling emissions To control air pollution emissions, the plant is equipped with electrostatic precipitators and low-NOx burners. A wet limestone flue-gas desulfurization system was installed in the mid 1990s. The plant donated a particularly scenic portion of the site, known locally as Buttermilk Falls, to Indiana County for use as a wildlife refuge. Company The plant employs about 200 people and is one of the largest employers in Indiana County. It is a subsidiary of GenOn Energy Inc. Water pollution In March 2011, PennEnvironment and the Sierra Club won a favorable court ruling finding that the plant had committed 8,684 violations of the Clean Water Act by discharging wastewater directly into the Conemaugh River. On June 6, 2011 GenOn agreed to a $5 million settlement with $3.75 million going toward the restoration of the river.

The phenomenon consists of a sudden rotation of cold southern winds to the south-east. This change, while moderating the cold temperatures, loads the air masses with oceanic humidity, bringing heavy rain and rough seas in the coastal regions. The air circulation also increases the intensity of the winds. The Sudestada is most likely to happen between July and October. Types and causes of sudestada A sudestada may take place with or (less commonly) without precipitation. The latter is caused by a high pressure system, centered on the southwest of Buenos Aires Province in Argentina, bringing persistent winds to the mouth of the R√≠o de la Plata. A sudestada with rain, on the other hand, is generated by the combined effect of two systems: a high pressure one located on the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of central Patagonia, which brings cold sea air to the east of Buenos Aires Province and the south of the Argentine littoral and Uruguay, and a low pressure system, located over the center-south of Argentine Mesopotamia and western Uruguay, which brings hot, humid air to the same region. As the pressure in the latter system drops, winds from the southeast increase.

At over 3,450 megawatts, Plant Bowen is one of the largest coal-fired power plants in North America.Electricity in the U.S. The station is connected to the southeastern power grid by numerous 500 kV transmission lines, and is owned and operated by Georgia Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company. Description Plant Bowen consists of four units, with capacities of 806, 789, 952, and 952 megawatts, respectively. The first unit began operation in 1971, and additional units were brought online in 1972, 1974, and 1975, respectively. Bowen's four cooling towers are tall and in diameter and can cool per minute. Another or 37 million gallons per day (MGD) of water is lost to evaporation which creates the distinctive white clouds rising from each tower. Bowen's two smokestacks are tall. Particulates are removed from the exhaust gases through the use of electrostatic precipitators. The exhaust gases are then closely monitored to comply with air quality regulations. In addition, Jet Bubble Reactor (JBR) units have recently been constructed on all four units to meet federal clean air and ozone standards. Coal for this plant comes from Eastern Kentucky and is delivered by CSX Transportation Inc. Atlanta Division crews with unit coal trains that are sometimes 120 cars long. Incidents On 4 April 2013, an explosion occurred on unit 2 while it was being removed from service and readied for a planned maintenance outage. This caused significant damage to the plant but there were no serious injuries. The explosion was attributed to a mixture of hydrogen and air in the generator, due to failure to comply with procedures. On July 13, 2017, A transformer in the plant's switchyard caught fire.

McGeough broke with Sinn F√©in in 2001 and he is now an independent Irish Catholic/nationalist activist. McGeough was set to serve 20 years imprisonment after being found guilty in 2011 for attempted murder, although he was released two years later, on 29 January 2013, under the Good Friday Agreement. Early life McGeough joined the Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade in 1975, aged 16. According to Tim Pat Coogan, Gerry McGeough was beaten by RUC interrogators at Cookstown barracks, Co. Tyrone in 1977, and was deported from Britain following a brief visit to London in 1978. McGeough had been arrested and interrogated for a full week before deportation, on suspicion that he was an IRA member. After activity in Ireland and Europe, he was arrested (along with another IRA member, Gerry Hanratty) in August 1988 while crossing the Dutch-German border with two AK47 rifles in his car. He was charged with attacks on the British Army of the Rhine and held for four years in a specially-built German detention centre. His trial in Germany was interrupted by extradition to the United States, where he was charged with attempting to buy surface-to-air-missiles in 1983. He served three years of his sentence in US prisons until his release in 1996 whereupon he was deported to the Republic of Ireland. McGeough led Sinn F√©in's opposition to the referendum on the Nice Treaty in the Republic of Ireland., A. Shaw, Red Action Bulletin, Volume 4, Issue 12, July/Aug 2001. He was also a Sinn F√©in national executive (ard- comhairle) member before becoming disgusted with what he perceives as the socially \\"liberal\\" views of \\"nouveau Sinn F√©in\\". Post-Sinn F√©in activism McGeough is known for his opposition to what he perceives as \\"liberalism\\" within contemporary Sinn F√©in: > You would never get a leader of Sinn F√©in condemning abortion, homosexual > \\"marriage\\" or anything of that nature. I, as an Irish nationalist and Roman > Catholic, never want to see the day when there are abortion clinics in every > market town in Ireland.

He accompanied Justin Barrett on a lecture tour of Irish towns in March 2004, in support of Barrett's unsuccessful attempt to become a member of the European Parliament. In May 2006, McGeough, as editor, and Charles Byrne, a 28-year-old from Drogheda, launched a monthly magazine called The Hibernian, dedicated to \\"Faith, Family and Country\\". The magazine had articles espousing the views of Father Denis Fahey and also promoted the Society of St. Pius X. McGeough is associated with the Ancient Order of Hibernians.Ex-Provo gives new life to Irish clerical fascism, Scott Millar, Searchlight Magazine, August 2006 In 2007, McGeough declared he would be standing for election in the Northern Ireland Assembly elections against Sinn F√©in in the Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency. He put himself forward as a protest against Sinn F√©in's vote in January 2007 to support the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), a key provision of the St Andrews Agreement. He polled 1.8% of the vote.

The chairman of the Bar Council of Northern Ireland,Gerry McAlinden QC, stated that \\"An independent, impartial judiciary and independent, impartial prosecuting counsel play a fundamental role in the maintenance of the rule of law and the protection of rights of all citizens in a free and democratic society ... Impartial and dedicated judges and prosecutors uphold the law and provide justice for victims and the community, and they should be allowed to work without fear or threat.

Rabin Lights) is a power station, as of 2016 Israel's largest. It is currently a 2.59GW coal-fired plant, although some of its generating units are in the process of conversion to a single-shaft combined- cycle gas power plant.Orot Rabin Modernization Project, NS Energy, 2019, accessed 28/09/2019 It is situated on the Mediterranean coast in Hadera, Israel and is owned and operated by the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC). The older, unmodernised four of its total six coal-fuelled units will be closed by mid-2022 in order to eliminate this major source of air pollution in the country.Government OKs Decision to Shut Coal-Fired Power Plants in Hadera by 2022, Israel Ministry of Environmental Protection, 09/08/2018, accessed 28/09/2019 History Construction of the station began in 1973 and block 1 (steam boiler, turbine and generator units 1-4) began operating in stages between 1981 and 1984. A second generation block (boiler, turbine and generator units 5-6) came online in 1996. A coal port is attached directly to the station which supplies all its coal consumption needs. Its total generating capacity is 2,590MW of electricity using the six power generating units (composed of two large units and four smaller units) located at the site. The plant's overall design can accommodate two additional large generation units which could be built at a future date. The chimneys at Orot Rabin Originally the power station was named Maor David after David Shiffman, then-chairman of the IEC who died during its lengthy period of construction. However, after the completion of a major expansion of the station in the 1990s and the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, the station was renamed in his honor to Orot Rabin, Hebrew for \\"Rabin Lights\\". Technical description the plant is Israel's largest power station with its 2,590 MW representing about 19% of the Israel Electric Corporation's total generation capacity (that is, unless Phase D expansion at the Rutenberg Power Station in Ashkelon will be built, at which point the latter would surpass Orot Rabin as Israel's largest power station). The plant burns 18,000 tons of coal every 24 hours and uses 320,000 tons of seawater every hour. It is also possible to operate the station using fuel oil. In 2009, a large desalination plant was built adjacent to the power station. In the mid 2010s, a fourth flue stack coupled with a scrubber (for FGD) and additional pollution control devices (including an SCR system for reduction) were connected to generation block 2 of the station, significantly reducing the amount of particulate pollution emanating from the block. Flue- gas stack 3 of the power station is tall, making it Israel's second-tallest structure after the towers of the Dimona Radar Facility, although stack 3 is no longer used since the construction of flue stack 4. Development: replacing coal with gas Units 1-4 replacement In 2016 the Israeli Ministry of Energy announced that the IEC would be ordered to shut down the older block 1 (generation units 1-4) of the station in the early 2020s. Block 1's production capacity will be replaced with a natural gas powered 2-unit combined cycle power plant utilizing two advanced GE Power HA-class gas turbines, scheduled to come online in 2022. The new gas-powered plant is expected to be built in the space originally reserved for additional coal units in the northern part of the Orot Rabin site and although shut down, coal units 1-4 will continue to be maintained so that they may be restarted in case of emergency (such as an extended disruption in the domestic supply of natural gas). =Pollution= Coal units 1-4 are the oldest and most polluting ones in the country, producing about 25% of the main total particulates emissions generated by all sources in the entire country. Unlike block 2, as well as both blocks of the Rutenberg coal plant, a scrubber has not been fitted to the four units of Orot Rabin's block 1. The old, unmodernised coal-fueled units 1 through 4 pollute 10 to 1000 times more per kilowatt than natural gas-fueled power plants, and 3 to 8 times more than a coal plant fitted with scrubbers. =Productivity= The shutdown of coal units 1-4 will also save Israel's economy billions of shekels, and bring its electricity sector into the 21st century in accordance to developed world standards. Environmental issues Orot Rabin has been accused of polluting the nearby Hadera Stream. Greenpeace claims that the station pollutes the sea water when coal is unloaded from ships and the sea water used for cooling the plant ends up in the Hadera River which harms wildlife. On the other hand, hot water gushing from the plant draws schools of hundreds of sandbar and dusky sharks every winter. Scientists are researching the rare phenomenon, which is unknown in the vicinity. It is speculated that the water, which is ten degrees warmer than the rest of the sea, may be the attraction.Sharks drawn to warm waters by Israeli coastal power plant See also *Economy of Israel *Energy in Israel *List of power stations in Israel  References  Category:Chimneys in Israel Category:Coal- fired power stations in Israel Category:Hadera Category:Buildings and structures in Haifa District ","title":"Orot Rabin"},{"id":"6870336","text":"The Old Bunnell State Bank Building (also known as the Citizens Bank of Bunnell) is a historic site in Bunnell, Florida, located between 101 through 107 North Bay Street.

It has been held at the Grand Floridian Resort in Walt Disney World each spring, usually in April, since 2015 (previously, it was held at the Contemporary Resort). Each county school board in Florida is asked to send a team composed of six high school students. Participating counties are separated into three divisions based on their full- time enrollment numbers for grades 9-12.  Tournament Format  Teams compete in up to four untimed matches, with each match consisting of 1) the 5-point question round of 20 \\"Button\\" questions, followed by a 10-point Team Question, 2) the 10-point question round of 20 \\"Button\\" questions, followed by a 20-point Team Question, and 3) the 15-point round of 25 \\"Button\\" questions followed by a 30-point Team Question. Button questions are quick-response toss-ups, answered by only one team, with correct answers earning points and incorrect answers losing points. The Team Questions are written worksheets, completed by each team, requiring several minutes to complete. Teams earn points for each correct answer, and are not subject to losing points for incorrect answers as they are in Button questions. The questions asked become progressively harder in each round and cover a variety of fields including English, math, science, social studies, art, music, foreign language (French and Spanish), technology, and multi-subject. The questions take a variety of forms, such as matching, multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and free response. Only four players may compete during a given round, but coaches are allowed to make substitutions between rounds. Most matches feature somewhere between four and six teams competing at the same time. A panel of judges is present in each competition room to deliberate if a challenge is declared by a team. These judges are experts in their field of study. A Reader reads most of the questions, aloud, to all the teams in the competition. Some questions, such as foreign language, music, art and physics are written and are distributed on handouts, simultaneously, to all participants. Others, such as music, are played as audio tracks, and some, such as foreign language are displayed as video tracks. A Coordinating Judge manages the competition in the match, which, although untimed, generally runs about two hours. The CAC is unlike many other quizbowl tournaments in that it is a slower-paced, more team-oriented competition. Team members are allowed to converse with each other at all times, and instead of having individual buzzers, each team is provided with only one or two buzzers that they must share. The CAC also differs from most tournaments in that there is no \\"rebounding.\\" This means that once a team has buzzed in on a question, that question is finished regardless of whether the team gave a correct or incorrect response.  Awards and Prizes  At the conclusion of the tournament, the top three teams in each division receive rings from Herff Jones, while the championship and second place teams also receive trophies and medallions from the Florida High School Athletic Association. In addition, one winning player from each of the three championship counties, and three other players selected \\"at large,\\" are chosen to serve on Team Florida, which competes at the National Tournament of Academic Excellence in June.

The resulting summary report allows individual users, such as professional information consumers, to quickly familiarize themselves with information contained in a large cluster of documents. In such a way, multi-document summarization systems are complementing the news aggregators performing the next step down the road of coping with information overload. Key benefits Multi-document summarization creates information reports that are both concise and comprehensive. With different opinions being put together & outlined, every topic is described from multiple perspectives within a single document. While the goal of a brief summary is to simplify information search and cut the time by pointing to the most relevant source documents, comprehensive multi- document summary should itself contain the required information, hence limiting the need for accessing original files to cases when refinement is required. Automatic summaries present information extracted from multiple sources algorithmically, without any editorial touch or subjective human intervention, thus making it completely unbiased. Technological challenges The multi-document summarization task is more complex than summarizing a single document, even a long one. The difficulty arises from thematic diversity within a large set of documents. A good summarization technology aims to combine the main themes with completeness, readability, and concision. The Document Understanding Conferences, conducted annually by NIST, have developed sophisticated evaluation criteria for techniques accepting the multi-document summarization challenge. An ideal multi-document summarization system not only shortens the source texts, but also presents information organized around the key aspects to represent diverse views. Success produces an overview of a given topic. Such text compilations should also basic requirements for an overview text compiled by a human. The multi-document summary quality criteria are as follows: *clear structure, including an outline of the main content, from which it is easy to navigate to the full text sections *text within sections is divided into meaningful paragraphs *gradual transition from more general to more specific thematic aspects *good readability. The latter point deserves an additional note. Care is taken to ensure that the automatic overview shows: *no paper-unrelated \\"information noise\\" from the respective documents (e.g., web pages) *no dangling references to what is not mentioned or explained in the overview *no text breaks across a sentence *no semantic redundancy. Real-life systems The multi-document summarization technology is now coming of age - a view supported by a choice of advanced web-based systems that are currently available. * Ultimate Research Assistant \\\\- performs text mining on Internet search results to help summarize and organize them and make it easier for the user to perform online research.

Launched on 24 February 1939, production continued into the war until 1943. Approximately 9,000 - 9,500 of the wartime Austin models were two-seater military 8AP tourers produced for the armed services and government, and the rest were four light saloons, six light saloons, two and four seater tourers and vans. After World War II, the model was made from 1945 until 1948. By the late 1930s, sales of Austin's big seller, the Austin 7, were declining and the 1938 addition to the range of the 900 cc \\"Big 7\\" did little to fill the demand, as despite its larger engine its suspension and handling were still rooted in its early 1920s origins. A restyled and re-engineered range of cars had started to appear in 1937 with the Cambridge 10 with its much more streamlined look, and following the arrival of Leonard Lord development of a proper 8 hp car was accelerated. First the \\"new\\" engine was advertised to be 27HP, but later it was corrected to the same rate as the Big 7, which was 24HP. The new car, which was displayed to dealers in February 1939, kept the 900 cc, four-cylinder, side-valve engine from the Big 7, now with a higher 6.5:1 compression ratio, but had a completely new chassis. This was halfway to full unitary construction in that the main member was a pressed steel floor pan with a box section welded down each side of the car with three others going across the floor. The body was then bolted to this structure. Suspension was by semi-elliptic leaf springs with hydraulic dampers. Two- and four-door saloon bodies were made as well as two- and four-seat tourers, and vans. About 47,600 were made before war closed production in 1943. In 1945, production restarted, but there were no more tourers or two-door saloons produced in England. Post-war production of the tourer was however undertaken in Australia. Pre war Austin 8 Initially there were four base models of the Austin 8. The model was unnamed and known simply by its RAC horsepower rating, plus the prosaic code that would not have been familiar to many outside the industry and trade. AR = Austin 8 four door six light saloon. ARA = Austin 8 two door four light saloon. AP = Austin 8 tourer, available in two seater and four seater AV = Austin 8 van Military Austin 8AP Tourer Just before and during the war a special Austin 8 \\"tilly\\" was manufactured, the Austin 8AP Military Tourer. Exact manufacturing numbers are not known but according to several sources the number would have been between 9000 and 9500 vehicles, most of them for Royal Army Service. The Military 8AP Tourer is recognised by, vertical louvres in the side bonnet plates of the car instead of horizontal ones, woodwork on the lower part of the windscreen, oil filled air filter, key-less ignition switch, closed wheels instead of pressed spoke wheels, pressed steel grille instead of sectioned casted grille, two seaters only. Please take care of these details, because some civilian cars have been transformed to military vehicles, where these details will indicate its civilian background. You will also find many Austin Tilly 8 saloons in military trim, but these are most probably non original transformations. There are no indications that the saloons were specially made for the armed forces. Post war Austin 8 After the war the Austin 8 was manufactured in a slightly different way than the pre-war 8s. The main differences were: steering wheel, chrome plated head lights instead of spray painted ones, horizontal air filter instead of vertical air filter, over riders on the bumpers, full back bumper instead of quarter ones, trunk handle, moveable licence plate carrier on the trunk lid, cast steel gear box instead of aluminium one. Only two models were available after the war, the six light four door saloon and the van. The tourer and the four light two door saloon were no longer available.

However, an imported chassis attracted minimal tax, and as a result Australian coach-builders imported rolling chassis to which they fitted custom-built bodies. The Austin chassis were reputedly shipped with guards (fenders), bonnet and grill surround pressings. The largest and best of these companies known for the Austin 8 were: Ruskin, Larke Hoskins, General Motors-Holden's Ltd and TJ Richards & Sons. The Larke Hoskins Austin 8s were called Austin Wasp and were built both as tourer and saloon. There are even Austin 8 two door Doctor's Coupes know manufactured by Ruskin. The Richards-built Tourers can be recognised by a curved cease in the door panels. 8s were built by General Motors-Holden's Ltd at least in 1940/1941/1942 as Austin 8 saloon and Austin 8 saloon Melbourne model.Holden GM production records document 1917-1949 A coach built Austin 8 tourer utility was discovered in Melbourne in the late eighties and was sold to South Australia for restoration. Post war Australian Austin 8s were therefore manufactured also as tourer, where in UK this model was not manufactured anymore. The Australian Tourers are slightly different from the original. The front window and seats were changed and some were fitted with a trunk lid, a feature which was not present on the pre war UK tourers. Other Austin 8 export models Both post war and pre war Austin 8s export models were manufactured. The Austin 8s were available for the European market as LHD. All other details of the cars were un-changed. The pre war export models for the US market were delivered LHD as well. At least some of the US export models were provided with the closed pressed wheels instead of the pressed spoke wheels used for the cars for the home market. The pressed wheels were of the same model as fitted on the Austin 8AP tourer models and had the same wheel discs as the military ones, although the civilian US wheel discs were chrome plated.

How many were manufactured of each model is not known, since more detailed production records have been destroyed. Austin 8 Register Since 1990, there is an Austin Eight Register, started by Ian Pinniger and continued in 2012 by Hermann Egges. Slightly over 100,000 Austin 8s have been manufactured between 1939 and 1948. The register contains information about 400-500 Austin 8s in existence, of which most are post-war six light saloons.

The gameplay straddled the line between entertainment and programming education. The game was developed in MacFORTH, and later ported to the Apple II and Commodore 64. Reception Computer Gaming World preferred Robot Odyssey to Chipwits but stated that both were \\"incredibly vivid simulation experiences\\". The magazine criticized Chipwits inability to save more than 16 robots or copy a robot to a new save slot, and cautioned that it \\"may be too simple for people familiar with programming\\". The magazine added that the criticism was \\"more a cry for a more complex Chipwits II game than condemnation of the current product\\".

The tall chimneys at Duvha are the second and third tallest structures in Africa, only a chimney located at the Secunda CTL plant is taller. History Construction of Duvha Power Station started in November 1975 and the last unit came into operation in 1984. In 1993 Duvha became the first power station in the world to be retrofitted with pulse jet fabric filter plants on three of its six units. These plants contribute largely to the reduction of air pollution by removing 99.99% of the fly ash, which otherwise would be released into the air through the station's chimneys. On 8 January 2003, Unit 2 generator exploded while being returned to service after a malfunction. On 9 February 2011 another unit failed catastrophically while performing over speed testing. The units are over speed rated at 3600 rpm and the last recorded speed before failure was 4250 rpm. It was the first power station in South Africa to have a black power station manager, Ehud Matya. Power generation The station consists of six 600 MW units with a total installed capacity of 3,600 MW operating with a turbine Maximum Continuous Rating of 37.6%. The station is a twin sister to Tutuka Power Station.  Corruption allegations  In April 2017 General Electric filed a court application accusing Eskom of rigging the tender to install a new boiler at the station so that Dongfang Electric would get the contact even though their bid was R1 billion (US$76 million) more than the General Electric bid.

The Longest Novels. AbeBooks A Suitable Boy is set in a newly post- independence, post-partition India. The novel follows the story of four families over a period of 18 months, and centres on Mrs. Rupa Mehra's efforts to arrange the marriage of her younger daughter, Lata, to a \\"suitable boy\\". Lata is a 19-year-old university student who refuses to be influenced by her domineering mother or opinionated brother, Arun. Her story revolves around the choice she is forced to make between her suitors Kabir, Haresh, and Amit. It begins in the fictional town of Brahmpur, located along the Ganges between Banares and Patna. Brahmpur, along with Calcutta, Delhi, Lucknow and other Indian cities, forms a colourful backdrop for the emerging stories. Seth has stated that the biggest influence on writing A Suitable Boy was the five- volume 18th century Chinese novel The Story of the Stone by Cao Xueqin.https://www.telegraphindia.com/1090710/jsp/entertainment/story_11216652.jsp The novel alternately offers satirical and earnest examinations of national political issues in the period leading up to the first post-Independence national election of 1952, including Hindu‚ÄìMuslim strife, the status of lower caste peoples such as the jatav, land reforms and the eclipse of the feudal princes and landlords, academic affairs, abolition of the Zamindari system, family relations and a range of further issues of importance to the characters. The novel is divided into 19 parts with, generally, each part focusing on a different subplot. Each part is described in rhyming couplet form on the contents page. A sequel, to be called A Suitable Girl, was due for publication in 2017. this was still unpublished. Plot summary In 1951, 19-year old Lata Mehra attends the wedding of her older sister, Savita, to Pran Kapoor, a university lecturer. Lata‚Äôs mother, Mrs. Rupa Mehra, informs Lata that it is time she marries, a notion which Lata dismisses as she intends to concentrate on her studies in English literature. Nevertheless Mrs. Rupa Mehra begins to put out feelers for a suitable boy for Lata to her friends and family. In the meantime Lata is approached several times by a boy her own age and after a few meetings feels she has already fallen in love with him. She learns his name is Kabir Durrani and is distressed when she realises he is Muslim as her Hindu family would never allow her to marry a Muslim man. When her early morning meetings with Kabir are discovered she tries to run away with Kabir, who refuses. Ultimately Lata agrees to go with her mother to Calcutta to live with her arrogant older brother Arun, who is already married. As Lata is leaving she is spotted by Haresh Khanna, an ambitious shoe manufacturer who is involved in business with Kedarnath Tandon, the husband of Pran‚Äôs older sister, Veena. He is intrigued by her beauty and sadness. In Calcutta, Lata is surprised to find herself enjoying her time with her brother and sister-in-law. She meets her sister-in-law Meenakshi‚Äôs eccentric family, the Chatterjis, and bonds with her older brother, Amit, an England-educated poet who is under pressure from his family to grow up and marry. Though Amit initially only intends on being friendly to Lata as a member of his family, he begins to wonder whether she might make a suitable wife. Mrs. Rupa Mehra is horrified when she realises that Amit and Lata might be considering each other as spouses as she dislikes Meenakshi and disapproves of the Chatterjis as a result. She decides to go to Delhi to renew her efforts to find a spouse for Lata. By accident she is introduced to Haresh Khanna and decides he is suitable for Lata. Despite the fact that he is in love with another woman, who he is also unable to marry due to objections from her family, Haresh agrees to meet Lata. Lata finds the idea of marrying Haresh ridiculous but nevertheless has an agreeable time with him and gives him permission to write to her. Returning home she hears that Kabir was involved in reuniting her sister-in- law Veena with her son after a mass stampede separated them. She nevertheless vows to forget about Kabir only to be surprised when they are both cast in the university‚Äôs production of Twelfth Night. During rehearsals Pran is hospitalised and Savita gives birth. Lata takes on a more prominent role in taking care of her sister and niece which results in her realising her mother is only trying to ensure her happiness and safety. She begins corresponding more warmly with Haresh and despite still being attracted to Kabir tells him that she is no longer interested in marrying him. Haresh loses his managerial job at a shoe factory but inveigles his way into a lesser position as the foreman at the Praha shoe factory with promise of upward mobility. His new circumstances fail to impress Arun and Meenakshi who are also biased against him as they are aware of Amit's burgeoning attraction to Lata and want to encourage that match. In the new year the Mehra family once again travels to Calcutta to spend time with Arun and Meenakshi and to reconnect with Haresh. At a cricket match Haresh, Kabir and Amit all meet and recognise that they are all loosely acquainted, but fail to realise that they are all, in one way or another, courting Lata. Kabir is in Calcutta trying to work up the courage to speak to Lata, however he fails to do so and Lata receives a letter from her best friend informing her that Kabir was spotted in an intimate conversation with another woman. Haresh is more persistent in his courtship of Lata, but after she off-handedly calls him mean, he takes offence and their relationship comes to a standstill. In the new year, based on Kabir's invitation, Amit comes to speak at Lata's school. She reconnects with Kabir where she learns that the information he was courting another woman was false. However she tells him she is seriously writing to Haresh and is strongly considering marrying him. Amit also takes this opportunity to more seriously propose to Lata. Lata meets Kabir one last time where she realises that the passion she feels for him is not the basis for a good marriage. After receiving an apologetic letter from Haresh renewing his offer of marriage and a second letter from Arun, strongly encouraging her to reject Haresh, Lata decides once and for all to marry Haresh. Concurrent to the main plot is the story of Maan Kapoor, Lata's brother-in-law Pran's brother. Maan is the feckless youngest child of respected politician Mahesh Kapoor, the state Minister of Revenue. At a Holi celebration, Maan watches the courtesan singer, Saeeda Bai, perform. He visits her house and begins to court her. They become lovers. Saeeda Bai later feels that her feelings for him are interfering with her work and reputation. She sends him away with Tasneem's Urdu teacher, Rasheed, to his remote village under the pretence of wanting Maan to learn flawless Urdu. Maan spends the time becoming acquainted with Rasheed's family who are politically influential. When Maan returns to Brahmpur he resumes his love affair with Saeeda Bai and gains favour with his father who decides to run for office again in the seat where Rasheed's family lives. After campaigning with his father, Maan returns to Saeeda Bai's house where he sees his friend Firoz and believes from veiled comments that Saeeda Bai makes that the two have been having a love affair behind his back. In reality, Firoz had come to propose to Tasneem who Saeeda Bai revealed to be her secret daughter and Firoz's half- sister. In the ensuing confusion Maan stabs Firoz in a fit of jealousy. The ensuing scandal causes his father to lose his seat and his mother to die after a series of strokes. However once Firoz recovers he insists that the stabbing was caused by his own clumsiness and Maan is made a free man. The wedding between Lata and Haresh takes place with joy to all except Kabir who is invited but does not come. A few days later Lata and Haresh take a train to his home to begin their new lives together.

The school has been named a Blue Ribbon School of Excellence. The school serves grades 9 through 12, and has a preschool with a main teacher and student teachers.  History  The school originated in what is now Apopka City Hall. In 1950, the school was moved to what is now Apopka Memorial Middle School, and then to its current location in 1976. In 2009, most of the campus was torn down and a new campus was constructed with the same layout as Timber Creek, Ocoee, Wekiva, and Freedom High Schools. Athletics Apopka competes in the Florida High School Athletic Association and has about 26 total sports teams. The football team won the class 6A State Championship in 2001. Since then the Apopka Blue Darters, led by Head Coach Rick Darlington, have collected two 8A state titles ('12 & '14) along with a 2013 state runner-up. The Apopka High School football team competes in District 4, Region 1 of FHSAA Class 8A. They hold an overall record of 106-29 since 2005. Apopka High School boys varsity bowling team had three consecutive undefeated seasons in 2013, 2014, and 2015.

The laboratory is part of the 96th Test Wing. In addition to Air Force testing, it can be used by other US government agencies and private industry. On October 6, 1997, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The laboratory was named a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1987. History In 1940, the US Army Air Force designated Ladd Field in Fairbanks, Alaska as a cold-weather testing facility. Because sufficiently cold weather was not predictable and often of short duration, Ashley McKinley suggested a refrigerated airplane hangar be built. The facilities were constructed at Eglin Field. The first tests started in May 1947. Airplanes that were tested included the B-29 Superfortress, C-82 Packet, P-47 Thunderbolt, P-51 Mustang, P-80 Shooting Star, and the Sikorsky H-5D helicopter. More recently, it has tested the C-5 Galaxy, the F-117, the F-22, the Boeing 787, and the Airbus A350 XWB. On 12 June 1971, the hangar was dedicated as the McKinley Climatic Hangar in honor of Col. Ashley McKinley, who suggested the facility and served at Eglin during its construction. Buildings The Building 440 is an insulated, refrigerated hangar. There is an office and instrumentation building, a cold-weather engine test cell, the refrigeration system, mechanical-draft cooling towers, and a steam-heating plant. The main chamber is wide, deep, and tall at the center of the hangar. It was constructed to hold aircraft as large as a B-29, its size also fitting the larger Convair B-36 Peacemaker. In 1968, a by extension was added. It now has working area. This allows it to test aircraft as large as a C-5A. Under hot conditions, it can achieve . The All-Weather Room is by . It has a temperature range from to . Rainfall can be as high as per hour and the wind can be as high as . Snow can be made in the chamber. The Temperature-Altitude Chamber is by with a height of . Altitudes up to can be simulated. The temperature range is to . The engine test cell was originally used for aircraft engines. It was about by with a height of . It is now called the Equipment Test Chamber and is used mainly for tanks, trucks, and other equipment. The original building had small tests rooms for desert, hot, marine, and jungle conditions. These have been eliminated. The original floor of the building was constructed of reinforced-concrete slabs that were thick and square. The slabs rested on of cellular glass blocks over reinforced concrete. In 1990, much of this floor was replaced with square slabs. The walls and door are insulated with of glass-wool board sheathed in galvanized steel. To seal the doors, they are pulled against foam rubber seals. The ceiling insulation is on a corrugated steel deck, which is suspended from the roof trusses by chains. Refrigeration system The original coolant was R-12 refrigerant. Liquid refrigerant is held in a low-pressure surge tank. The pressure in this tank is maintained at the saturation pressure for the desired temperature for the cooling coils. Vapor from this tank is compressed to a gage pressure of by the first-stage compressor. The compressed vapor is expanded into an intermediate, desuperheater tank. Liquid condensed in this expansion is drained back to the surge tank. The remaining vapor is compressed in a high-stage compressor to a gage pressure of about . Heat is transferred from the hot vapor to cooling water. Any condensed liquid is returned to the intermediate tank, the surge tank, or the supply tank. Liquid refrigerant from the surge tank is pumped through the cooling coils at sufficient pressure to avoid vaporization. Warmed liquid is returned to the surge tank. As its pressure is reduced, a portion of this liquid will flash into vapor. There are three such refrigeration systems. Each low-stage compressor is powered by a motor and each high-stage compressor is powered by a motor. The system was built by York Corporation. The original motors were Allis-Chalmers induction motors. They have been replaced by variable frequency, synchronous motors manufactured by EMICC that operate between 350 and 1800 rpm. Recent efforts have been made to change from ozone-depleting refrigerants. For engine tests, there is need for makeup air. The system originally could cool per second of humid air. In 1966, this was increased to per second. Air is also cooled by a two-stage heat exchanger. The first stage uses of 20% calcium chloride brine pre-cooled to . The second stage uses of methylene chloride pre-cooled to . This can cool per second of humid air from to for 40 minutes.

Unlike most public key encryption models, distributed key generation does not rely on Trusted Third Parties. Instead, the participation of a threshold of honest parties determines whether a key pair can be computed successfully. Distributed key generation prevents single parties from having access to a private key. The involvement of many parties requires Distributed key generation to ensure secrecy in the presence of malicious contributions to the key calculation. Distributed Key Generation is commonly used to decrypt shared ciphertexts or create group digital signatures. History Distributed key generation protocol was first specified by Torben Pedersen in 1991. This first model depended on the security of the Joint-Feldman Protocol for verifiable secret sharing during the secret sharing process. In 1999, Rosario Gennaro, Stanislaw Jarecki, Hugo Krawczyk, and Tal Rabin produced a series of security proofs demonstrating that Feldman verifiable secret sharing was vulnerable to malicious contributions to Pedersen's distributed key generator that would leak information about the shared private key. The same group also proposed an updated distributed key generation scheme preventing malicious contributions from impacting the value of the private key. Methods The distributed key generation protocol specified by Gennaro, Jarecki, Krawczyk, and Rabin assumes that a group of players has already been established by an honest party prior to the key generation. It also assumes the communication between parties is synchronous. # All parties use Pedersen's verifiable secret sharing protocol to share the results of two random polynomial functions. # Every party then verifies all the shares they received. If verification fails, the recipient broadcasts a complaint for the party whose share failed. Each accused party then broadcasts their shares. Each party then has the opportunity to verify the broadcast shares or disqualify accused parties. All parties generate a common list of non-disqualified parties. # Each non-disqualified party broadcasts a set of values constructed by raising a common generator to the power of each value used in one polynomial in Part 1. # These broadcast values are verified by each party similarly to as in Part 2. When a verification fails, the party now broadcasts both the values received in Part 1 and the values received in Part 3. For each party with verifiable complaints, all other parties reconstruct their own value sets in order to eliminate disqualified contributions. # The group computes the private key as the product of every qualified contribution (each qualified party's random polynomial evaluated at 0). Avoiding the Synchrony Assumption In 2009, Aniket Kate and Ian Goldberg presented a Distributed key generation protocol suitable for use over the Internet. Unlike earlier constructions, this protocol does not require a broadcast channel or the synchronous communication assumption, and a ready-to-use library is available. Robustness In many circumstances, a robust distributed key generator is necessary. Robust generator protocols can reconstruct public keys in order to remove malicious shares even if malicious parties still remain in the qualified group during the reconstruction phase. For example, robust multi-party digital signatures can tolerate a number of malicious users roughly proportionate to the length of the modulus used during key generation. Sparse Evaluated DKG Distributed key generators can implement a sparse evaluation matrix in order to improve efficiency during verification stages. Sparse evaluation can improve run time from O(nt) (where n is the number of parties and t is the threshold of malicious users) to O(log^3n). Instead of robust verification, sparse evaluation requires that a small set of the parties verify a small, randomly picked set of shares. This results in a small probability that the key generation will fail in the case that a large number of malicious shares are not chosen for verification. Applications Distributed key generation and distributed key cryptography are rarely applied over the internet because of the reliance on synchronous communication. Distributed key cryptography is useful in key escrow services where a company can meet a threshold to decrypt a ciphertext version of private key. This way a company can require multiple employees to recover a private key without giving the escrow service a plaintext copy. Distributed key generation is also useful in server-side password authentication. If password hashes are stored on a single server, a breach in the server would result in all the password hashes being available for attackers to analyze offline. Variations of distributed key generation can authenticate user passwords across multiple servers and eliminate single points of failure. Distributed key generation is more commonly used for group digital signatures. This acts as a form of voting, where a threshold of group members would have to participate in order for the group to digitally sign a document.

Originally scheduled as a four issue mini-series, it spawned a mythology that would inform other versions of the saga. It also had a UK sister title that spliced original stories into the continuity, running for 332 issues. US Title Story Arcs There were several story arcs that ran through the US series. Issues # 1-4 - The Autobots and Decepticons land on Earth via the Ark, paralleling the cartoon. The Autobots are reformatted by the Ark to resemble cars and trucks; the Decepticons take the form of jets, weapons or in the case of Soundwave, a cassette deck with tapes. The Decepticons wreak havoc, steal energy and build a fortress. The Autobots, seen here as very weak underdogs, unsuited for war, fight valiantly to stop their foes. Ultimately, it's the humans that the Autobots befriend that save the day. Buster Witwicky's father, captured by the Decepticons to formulate a fuel for them, secretly poisons his captors. In the final battle, five Autobots take on the entire Decepticon army. With the Autobots on the cusp of defeat, the tainted fuel concocted by Mr. Witwicky kicks in and the Decepticons fall. The Autobots don't even have time to celebrate, however, as the 4-part mini-series ends with Shockwave making an appearance, blowing the remaining Autobots to pieces. This cliffhanger led directly into the monthly Marvel run, which began 3 months after the miniseries ended. (Issue #4 had a cover date of Mar. 1985; issue #5 had a date of June.) The series was originally intended to end after issue #4 and the planned last page of issue #4 indicated as much,http://www.tfarchive.com/comics/faq/alternate.jpg but with strong sales, Marvel was convinced to make the series ongoing and the ending was altered to have Shockwave show up and attack the Autobots prior to the issue being published. The series was also set in the Marvel Universe at one point with the X-men's Dazzler is referenced in Issue #2 as well as Spider-Man, Nick Fury, Joe Robertson and Dum Dum Dugan of S.H.I.E.L.D. making appearances as early as Issue #3. Additionally, the Savage Land appears in Issue #4 when Ratchet visits the place which debuted in X-Men. The Marvel Universe connections were since jettisoned in later issues of the comic. Early Marvel comic art work Issues # 5-12 - In this story arc, Shockwave has control of the Ark. Most of the Autobots are non-functional, and Optimus Prime has been reduced to just a head. Shockwave wants Optimus Prime to give life to Decepticons using the Creation Matrix that he possesses, but Optimus refuses and eventually passes the Matrix on to an unwitting Buster. Meanwhile, a weakened Megatron tries to regain command of the Decepticons, but Shockwave easily takes him down. Needing help against Shockwave, medical officer Ratchet finds and enlists the help of the Dinobots. Megatron soon winds up lost in the woods, stuck in gun mode and without his memory. Issues # 13-23 - Megatron is inadvertently reawakened and heads back to become leader of the Decepticons again. Meanwhile, the government hires a comic book writer named Donny Finkelberg to play Robot Master, a man supposedly behind all the robot attacks (making no distinction between Autobot or Decepticon). The point of the whole ruse is to put an easily identifiable face on the public's worries about the robots. Donny eventually becomes Megatron's pawn for a while, then escapes and tries to help the Autobots - but not before selling them out to the U.S. government. Eventually he realises the error of his ways and gives up all the money that the government paid him. The Autobots meet more troubles in the form of Circuit Breaker, a character first introduced in #8. A sweet and brilliant young lady who created advanced technology for oil magnate Mr. Blackrock, she was crippled during an attack on one of Blackrock's oil rigs in issue #5. Using her technical know-how to create a suit that gives her control of her motor functions again, she adopts the Circuit Breaker persona and vows revenge on all Transformers, also making no distinction between Autobot and Decepticon - and unfortunately, more often than not her actions negatively affect the Autobots alone. Issues #17 and #18 feature a two-parter that takes the reader back to Cybertron. (This was prior to seeing Cybertron in the movie or the TV show.) New characters such as Blaster were introduced through this storyline, and the characters eventually crossed over onto Earth.) In issue #19, the Dinobots (especially Grimlock) begin to resent taking orders from Optimus Prime, so they strike out on their own. Omega Supreme is introduced. Issues # 24-37 - In events that parallel the happenings in the movie and TV show (though the events take place 20 years apart), many major characters make their final stand. Bumblebee is destroyed by the unwitting members of G.I. Joe in G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers #1; Megatron succeeds in killing Optimus Prime (or does he?) in #24; Megatron is driven mad and runs into a space portal that destroys him in #25; etc. Bumblebee soon returns as Goldbug. A new human adversary named The Mechanic first appears in #26, a car thief whose handiness with a wrench can spell disaster for Autobots that get in his path. The Dinobots return in issue #27 and Grimlock quickly asserts himself as the new leader of the Autobots. Many Autobots have strong reservations about his leadership skills, particularly his lack of concern for human life. Blaster and Goldbug decide to defy orders after one mission and not return to the Ark, making them the subject of hunting by an enraged Grimlock. Issues #33 and 34 took a break from the main storyline to reprint a Marvel UK Transformers story called \\"Man of Iron\\". Since this is outside the normal continuity, Optimus Prime is still alive and the leader of the Autobots at this time. Starting in issue #35 (cover-dated December, 1987), the events became less Earth-centric, as the Transformers repaired their spacecraft and were able to revisit their homeworld Cybertron and other planets. This aspect was particularly prominent in the Matrix Quest sub-plot. Starting in issue #38, the Headmasters showed up, after appearing in their own four-issue miniseries. Optimus Prime returned, in a manner of speaking, in issue #40 when it was discovered that his personality had been saved on a floppy disk. Unfortunately, he had no memory of working with the Autobots. However, by #42, he'd been given a new Powermaster body and his memory had been restored. In issue #75 (cover-dated February, 1991), the Autobots and Decepticons had united under one banner after Autobot commander Optimus Prime surrendered to Scorponok, in order to end their civil war. United, they finally faced their ancient nemesis: Unicron. The Transformers won, but with heavy losses, including the deaths of Scorponok and Optimus Prime (again). Peace between the two Transformers factions was short-lived after Unicron's death. Bludgeon, the new Decepticon leader, tried to strand the Autobots on Cybertron, which was apparently destroying itself. His plan failed and the final confrontation between the two factions played out, with the Autobots lead again by Grimlock. Optimus Prime is united with Hi-Q (his Powermaster) and given life by The Last Autobot. He returns to battle to save the Autobots and then exiles the Decepticons forever (until Transformers: Generation 2). After the battle with Unicron, the comic ran for only five issues before being cancelled. The final issue had the mini series banner above the title; \\"#80 IN A FOUR ISSUE LIMITED SERIES\\". Writers Most of the issues of Transformers Marvel US were written by two writers. Although the first issue was written by Bill Mantlo and Ralph Macchio, and the second through fourth issues were written by Jim Salicrup, editor Bob Budiansky was the one who contributed the most to the story, writing the character bios and backgrounds for the Transformers, even giving names to some of them. After the mini-series became an ongoing comic, Budiansky was promoted to constant writer. Except for issue #16 (Plight of the Bumblebee, written by Len Kaminski), issue #43 (The Big Broadcast of 2006), a Transformers cartoon episode adaptation by Macchio (who also wrote the limited series adapting the movie) and the two-part story Man of Iron (imported from Transformers Marvel UK), Bob wrote all the Transformers comics until issue #55. Most famous story arcs and issues are Warrior's School featuring the introduction of the Dinobots and the first clash between Autobot medic Ratchet and Megatron; Prime Time! when Optimus Prime is finally freed from captivity and battles current Decepticon commander Shockwave; Smelting Pool and The Bridge to Nowhere brought the story back to Cybertron where only a handful of Autobots fight an underground war against Straxus's Decepticons, also introducing Blaster, Budiansky's most-used character who was radically different from his cartoon and Marvel UK version. Afterdeath and Gone but not forgotten saw the deaths (for a while, anyway) of Optimus Prime and Megatron, after which Grimlock took control of the Autobot forces in King of the Hill. Starting at issue #28, Blaster and Goldbug (a rebuilt Bumblebee) defected from the Autobots due to Grimlock's tyrannical leadership, which ended with Grimlock and Blaster having a duel in Totaled. The next issue, People Power saw the return of Optimus Prime, as a Powermaster. The \\"Underbase saga\\" began in issue #47 and ended in issue #50, Dark Star, where Starscream, absorbing the power of the Underbase, kills most of the active Transformers of the time. (Budiansky admitted in an interview that Hasbro was forcing him to introduce new characters so quickly, he had to do an epic to \\"make room\\" for them.) Budiansky's last 5 stories were very mediocre, he himself said that he lost the interest in Transformers, and asked Hasbro to hand over the comics to a new writer. From issue #56, the by then well-known writer of Transformers Marvel UK, Simon Furman took over the reins, having been asked by Marvel US. Furman used the characterisation he used at Marvel UK for the Transformers, and introduced many characters to the US comic who have already appeared in the UK comic. He wrote all the issues until the comic's cancellation at issue #80. Furman's most famous story arcs include Back from the Dead, the return of Megatron who kidnaps Ratchet to help him in his revenge against both Autobots and Decepticons; Primal Scream! which introduced Primus and re-told the origin of the Transformer race to the US readers too; the \\"Matrix Quest\\" which features the Autobots sending numerous teams to locate the Matrix that was lost when Optimus \\"died\\" and his body was shot into space; and the Unicron story arc from #67 to #75, featuring the Transformers' ultimate battle against the Chaos Bringer. The comic was cancelled shortly after issue #80, so Furman had to \\"wrap up\\" the ending. According to some interviews with him, he planned to feature the Neo-Knights and the \\"demons\\" inhabiting Cybertron's underground more in the never-written issues.. UK Title The U.K. version of the original Transformers comics was produced by Marvel UK (Marvel Comics's semi- independent UK imprint). It began as a simple reprint book with a single US story split across two or more UK issues, but differences in production schedules meant that additional locally sourced material was need to pad around the U.S. material. Over 160 new stories not included in the U.S. comic were produced for the UK market. They introduced characters such as Emirate Xaaron, and operated an expanded continuity parallel to main U.S. franchise. Classic storylines included Galvatron time-travelling in Target: 2006 and the introduction of the Transformer God, Primus. Initially, the UK exclusive stories were heavily tied into U.S. continuity and were not able to develop the characters. However, the release of the Transformers animated movie introduced a new generation of future characters (Hot Rod, Ultra Magnus, Galvatron, etc.) who were generally ignored by the U.S. title and could be developed by the UK title without contradicting the U.S. reprints. The principal writer of the UK material was Simon Furman. Many of his longer stories took a more epic approach to the Transformers than the U.S. title. The UK comic extensively developed the back-story world of the Transformers. Furman's epic semi-mythical and more sophisticated approach to the material had a significant impact on future Transformer imprints. His success on the title was such that he succeeded Bob Budiansky as writer of the U.S. counterpart and has been associated with the succession of Transformers comic franchises, such as published by Dreamwave and IDW. The Transformers UK comic was equally home to two long standing backup humour strips. The first was Robo-Capers, written and produced by artist/creator Lew Stringer. The second was Matt and the Cat, written and produced by artist/creator Mychailo \\"Mike\\" Kazybrid. Whilst originally created as the daily cartoon strip Matt in April 1979, and appearing for six years in the Bradford Telegraph & Argus newspaper, and later in The Manchester Evening News, the comic strip began in Transformers issue 5, November 1984, and continued until issue 73, August 1986. In order to fit in with the theme of the Transformers publication, the format and style was changed. Also, whilst starting as mainly a supporting character, Humph the Cat began to take more of a lead during his humorous encounters with robots, aliens, and his ongoing need to post his comic book subscription. Other Titles There were two 4-issue mini-series, G.I. Joe and the Transformers, and The Transformers: Headmasters, which integrated into the story of the main title. The G.I. Joe comic would also later introduce the 12-issue follow up, Generation 2. Continuation of the comic In July 2011, it was announced that IDW Publishing has signed up Simon Furman, Andrew Wildman and Stephen Baskerville (Wildman's Transformers inker) to make a continuation of the Marvel Transformers comic, consisting of 20 issues from #81 to #100.81 is a go for 2012!, IDW Publishing Forums. Accessed 24 July 2011. A special \\"prequel\\" issue, numbered #80.5, was published on Free Comic Book Day on 5 May 2012. Issue number #81 was published in July 2012, after which the series continued monthly.

A member of the Republican Party, he first entered Congress in 2007, representing Florida's 13th congressional district until redistricting. His district is anchored by Sarasota and Bradenton. Buchanan is the only Republican member from Florida on the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over tax policy, international trade, health care and Social Security. Prior to serving in Congress, Buchanan was in business for over 30 years and was the chairman of both the Greater Sarasota Chamber of Commerce and Florida Chamber of Commerce. He served as member of the board and the executive committee of the United States Chamber of Commerce. With a net worth of $73.9 million, Buchanan is the 8th wealthiest member of Congress. Early life and education Buchanan grew up in Inkster, Michigan, a small town outside Detroit, Michigan, the son of a factory foreman in a family of six children.Lauren Mayk, \\"Buchanan: Big deals led to big riches\\", Herald-Tribune, October 31, 2006 His maternal grandparents immigrated to the United States from Finland.http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/buchanan.htm When he graduated from high school in 1969, he joined the Michigan Air National Guard, serving there for six years. Buchanan got a bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Cleary University, in Michigan, and a Masters in Business Administration from the University of Detroit. Business career In June 2007, Buchanan, in his financial disclosure filing, reported having over $100 million in assets, making him among the five wealthiest members of Congress. Most of his wealth is from his automotive empire, which includes several dealerships in Florida. He also reported ownership interests in about fifty other businesses, including offshore reinsurance companies, and a charter-jet business. He reported receiving at least $19.5 million in income from these businesses in 2006.Duane Marsteller, \\"One of richest reps in Congress: Vern Buchanan\\", Bradenton Herald, June 16, 2007 American Speedy Printing In May 1976, Buchanan convinced the owner of a Michigan printing company, Jim McDonald that he could help the business grow. The two founded American Speedy Printing, which grew through franchising to more than 730 stores in 44 states. Later, Buchanan and American Speedy Printing were defendants in a string of lawsuits during the late 1980s and early 1990s by franchisees and master franchisees, who said they were not making the money that Buchanan had said they could expect. After filing for bankruptcy, he was accused by a creditors committee of taking excessive compensation and actions that resulted in overstated earnings for American Speedy Printing. In a 1995 deposition, he said that he had no personal obligation to repay a large corporate loan from Merrill Lynch. A dispute with the Internal Revenue Service over taxes on the money Buchanan received from Merrill Lynch stretched through the 1990s. Buchanan, his business partner, and Merrill Lynch were sued for violating the Michigan Corporation Act. It ended with Buchanan paying $1.5 million.Lauren Mayk, \\"A success story that's not so simple: Vern Buchanan's messy departure from American Speedy is a seldom-told tale\\", Herald Tribune, October 6, 2006 Car dealerships In 1992, Buchanan bought a Honda and Acura dealership in Ocala, Florida. In late 1999, he bought two more dealerships. He continued to acquire dealerships after that, but in 2006 he sold five dealerships and other businesses in order to concentrate on politics. His dealerships had $756 million in sales in 2005. Reinsurance companies Buchanan owns two reinsurance companies ‚Äî Jamat Reinsurance Co. and Buchanan Reinsurance Co., in Turks and Caicos, and part of the Bermuda reinsurance company Greater Atlantic Insurance Co. The three companies offer extended warranty policies to car buyers. Buchanan invests some of the proceeds from his reinsurance companies in real estate developments in the Bahamas.Michael Bragda, \\"Use of offshore companies helps Buchanan reduce his tax burden\\", Herald-Tribune, October 31, 2006 Ritz-Carlton In 1999, Buchanan was approached to help to finance the Ritz-Carlton condo-hotel development in Sarasota. Buchanan was cut out of the project. The developers, Robert Buford and Kevin Daves, said he lied about his financial means. Buchanan sued and the parties settled in 2001.Michael Braga, \\"Accountants, others question settlement between Buchanan, wealthy developer\\", Herald- Tribune, September 10, 2006 Per a structured settlement, Buchanan bought a condo from a nephew of Buford's for $5 million; the nephew had purchased it the day before for $2.368 million. Buchanan owned the unit a little more than a year and then sold it to another member of Buford's family for $6.35 million. The arrangement resulted in Buchanan paying taxes on his gain at the reduced long-term capital gains rate. Buford benefited from the apartment's increased appraised value and the use of Buchanan's $5 million. In the year he owned the penthouse, Buchanan used it for charity fundraisers. Political campaigns 2006 =Primary election= Buchanan ran in the 13th congressional district in Florida to replace incumbent Republican Katherine Harris, who was the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate. Buchanan won the Republican primary with 32% of the vote, against four opponents. His closest challengers were Nancy C. Detert, with 25% of the vote, and Tramm Hudson, with 24%. In the November general election, Buchanan faced Democrat Christine Jennings, a banking executive. There were 216,000 registered Republicans and about 155,000 registered Democrats in the district,Jeremy Wallace, \\"President Pitches In at Buchanan Fundraiser: Bush touts GOP principles at Vern Buchanan event in Sarasota\\", The Ledger, October 25, 2006 but Jennings polled ahead of Buchanan up to election day.\\"Another election mess in Florida\\", The Economist, December 9, 2006 Buchanan put more than $5 million of his own money into his campaign.

Due to the closeness of the race, and a high undervote of 18,000 in Sarasota County, a recount was ordered. Voters in Sarasota County had given more votes to a hospital board than they had to their Congressional representative‚Äîwith 13% of voters not voting, compared to an average of 2% in neighboring counties. The touch-screen voting machines used provided no paper record. On November 20, 2006, the Florida Department of State certified the results of the recount, which showed Buchanan winning by 369 votes. Jennings challenged the results of the election in court, citing \\"pervasive malfunctioning of electronic voting machines.\\" In December 2006, a Florida circuit judge ruled that her claim that voting machines in Sarasota County lost up to 18,000 votes was \\"conjecture\\" and didn't warrant overriding the trade secrets of the voting machine company. In June 2007, a Florida state appellate court ruled that Jennings did not meet the \\"extraordinary burden\\" of proving the lower court judge was wrong.\\"Jennings Dealt Setback In Voting Machine Challenge\\" , CBS local news (cbs4.com), June 18, 2007 Another suit, filed by voters represented by Voter Action, People For the American Way Foundation, the ACLU of Florida, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation\\"Sarasota Voters File Lawsuit for Re-vote in Congressional Race \\" Electronic Frontier Foundation, November 21, 2006 was also dismissed. The U.S. House of Representatives had the right to make the final determination as to whether Buchanan will hold the seat for the remainder of the term or be replaced by Jennings. In April, a three-person House task force was created to evaluate the election.Phil Davis, , Associated Press, April 17, 2007 In early May, the task force voted along party lines to refer an investigation into Florida's 13th district House race to the Government Accountability Office (GAO).Aaron Blake, \\"FL-13 task force will turn over investigation to GAO\\", The Hill, May 3, 2007 On February 25, 2008, the committee and the House accepted the GAO's findings that no machine error was demonstrated as sufficient to have altered the outcome of the election. The House passed HR 989 affirming the findings of the committee, accepting the results of the 2006 race and formally dismissing Jennings' challenge of the election's results. Jennings formally dropped her challenge shortly thereafter to focus on her 2008 rematch against Buchanan. 2008 Buchanan, won narrowly in 2006, but was easily re-elected in a 2008 rematch with Christine Jennings.

Buchanan won the 2010 General Election for Florida's 13th Congressional District with 68.9% of the vote. 2012 In 2012, Buchanan was challenged by former Democratic state representative Keith Fitzgerald. Buchanan won with 53.6% of the vote, his narrowest victory since the 2006 election against Jennings. 2014 2016 In 2016, Buchanan was re-elected to a sixth term with 60% of the vote. 2018 In 2018, Buchanan faced off against Democratic challenger attorney David Shapiro. He was re-elected with 54.6% of the vote. 2020 Buchanan is currently facing a challenge from Democratic state representative Margaret Good. Good defeated Buchanan's son James in a closely watched special election in 2018. Criminal investigations In July 2012, the House Ethics Committee cleared Buchanan of charges that he violated House rules by misleading Congress in his financial disclosure forms. After the issue was raised, Buchanan submitted revised forms.John Bresnahan, House Ethics Committee finds no wrongdoing by Rep. Buchanan, Politico (June 24, 2016). The committee \\"found no evidence that the errors were knowing or willful and unanimously determined that the errors were not substantively different from the hundreds or thousands of errors corrected by amendment at the requirement of the Committee every year.\\" In 2008, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed a Federal Elections Commission (FEC) complaint, alleging \\"straw donors\\" to Buchanan's campaign (campaign contributions from Buchanan's employees for which they were then reimbursed); in 2011, CREW requested a U.S. Department of Justice investigation. (The group also named Buchanan to its annual \\"most corrupt members of Congress\\" list for 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012). By 2012, Buchanan was being investigated on the House Ethics Committee, FEC, Justice Department, and Office of Congressional Ethics, over two separate allegations of campaign finance misconduct: that he had violated federal law and House rules by coercing a former business partner to sign a false affidavit to the FEC, and that he had illegally reimbursed car-dealership employees for campaign contributions.Rema Rahman, House Ethics Committee Clears Vern Buchanan: Panel cites insufficient evidence against Florida congressman, Roll Call (June 24, 2016). The latter allegation was also raised in a lengthy and acrimonious legal dispute with Sam Kazran, Buchanan's former business partner, who alleged that Buchanan engaged in a \\"cash swap scheme\\" in which employees were directed to write checks to Buchanan's campaign fund, then reimbursed by the company. In 2012, the Justice Department ended its 11-month investigation with no criminal charges.Jeremy Wallace, Buchanan campaign says he's been cleared by Justice Department, Sarasota Herald-Tribune (September 11, 2012). The FEC also ended its investigation by 2012. Kazran agreed to pay $5,500 in fines \\"for improperly funneling money to Buchanan's campaign committee,\\" and in May 2013 three men and two Tampa companies were fined a total of $16,000 by the FEC for illegal campaign contributions to Buchanan.Susan Taylor Martin, FEC fines 3 men, 2 Tampa companies for illegal contributions to Rep. Vern Buchanan,Tampa Bay Times (May 7, 2013).Kent Cooper, FEC Follows DOJ With Another Fine for Buchanan Contributions, Roll Call (May 6, 2013). In 2016, after a four-year inquiry, the House Ethics Committee ended its investigation, finding \\"insufficient evidence\\" of wrongdoing on Buchanan's part. Kazran filed a separate breach of contract lawsuit against Buchanan in Florida state court; Buchanan prevailed in that litigation.Sara Kennedy, Vern Buchanan scores big legal win in fight with former business partner, Bradenton Herald (November 14, 2014).Jeremy Wallace, Jury sides with Buchanan against former business partner, Sarasota Herald-Tribune (November 13, 2014). Beginning in 2008, Buchanan faced lawsuits by six former employees, who alleged \\"conspiracy, fraud, and retaliatory personnel actions\\" as well as the hiring of undocumented immigrants and consumer fraud. However, none of those cases made it to trial and by 2011 most had been \\"dismissed with no judgments against Buchanan.\\"Jeremy Wallace, Buchanan sheds car dealerships, fueling speculation he may run for U.S. Senate, Sarasota Herald-Tribune (July 3, 2011). On June 23, 2016, the House Ethics Committee released this statement, concluding its investigation into Congressman Buchanan: \\"Because the evidence is insufficient to conclude that Representative Buchanan himself was aware of the unlawful reimbursements at the time they occurred, or had any role in directing or approving of them, and the evidence is insufficient to find that Representative Buchanan attempted to improperly influence the testimony of Mr. Kazran before the FEC, the Committee has determined to take no further action in this matter, and upon publication of this Report,considers the matter closed.\\" U.S. House of Representatives  110th Congress (2007‚Äì2009)  Buchanan was sworn in as Representative for Florida's 13th Congressional District on January 3, 2007. Congressional Quarterly noted that Buchanan voted in support of President Bush's legislative agenda 66 percent of the time in 2007, the third lowest rate of the 16 members of Florida's Republican congressional delegation. Buchanan secured federal funding of $2 million for reimbursement for cleanup efforts in Anna Maria Island and $4 million for cleaning up Wares Creek in Manatee County. Buchanan introduced a constitutional amendment in January 2007 which would require Congress to pass a balanced budget if ratified.\\"H.J.

These override votes included a vote in support of expanding the coverage range of the SCHIP program, the 2008 farm bill, and the Water Resources Development Act. On September 29, 2008, Buchanan voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, but changed his vote to support the bill on the October 3, 2008 second House vote . 111th Congress (2009‚Äì2010) Buchanan sponsored several bills in the 111th Congress, including House Resolution 1839, a Bill to Amend the Small Business Act to Improve SCORE (Service Corps of Retired Executives), which was introduced on April 1, 2009.

This can be useful when a check digit is required to validate an identification string composed of letters, a combination of letters and digits or even any arbitrary set of characters.  Informal explanation  The Luhn mod N algorithm generates a check digit (more precisely, a check character) within the same range of valid characters as the input string. For example, if the algorithm is applied to a string of lower-case letters (a to z), the check character will also be a lower-case letter. Apart from this distinction, it resembles very closely the original algorithm. The main idea behind the extension is that the full set of valid input characters is mapped to a list of code-points (i.e., sequential integers beginning with zero). The algorithm processes the input string by converting each character to its associated code-point and then performing the computations in mod N (where is the number of valid input characters). Finally, the resulting check code-point is mapped back to obtain its corresponding check character.  Mapping characters to code-points  Initially, a mapping between valid input characters and code- points must be created. For example, consider that the valid characters are the lower-case letters from a to f. Therefore, a suitable mapping would be: {  style=\\"width:300px;\\" -align=center !Character  a  b  c  d  e  f -align=center !Code-point  0  1  2  3  4  5 } Note that the order of the characters is completely irrelevant. This other mapping would also be acceptable (although possibly more cumbersome to implement): {  style=\\"width:300px;\\" -align=center !Character  c  e  a  f  b  d -align=center !Code-point  0  1  2  3  4  5 } It is also possible to intermix letters and digits (and possibly even other characters). For example, this mapping would be appropriate for lower-case hexadecimal digits: {  style=\\"width:500px;\\" -align=center !Character  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f -align=center !Code-point  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15 }  Algorithm in C#  Assuming the following functions are defined: int CodePointFromCharacter(char character) {...} char CharacterFromCodePoint(int codePoint) {...} int NumberOfValidInputCharacters() {...} The function to generate a check character is: char GenerateCheckCharacter(string input) { int factor = 2; int sum = 0; int n = NumberOfValidInputCharacters(); // Starting from the right and working leftwards is easier since // the initial \\"factor\\" will always be \\"2\\". for (int i = input.Length - 1; i >= 0; i--) { int codePoint = CodePointFromCharacter(input[i]); int addend = factor * codePoint; // Alternate the \\"factor\\" that each \\"codePoint\\" is multiplied by factor = (factor  2) ? 1 : 2; // Sum the digits of the \\"addend\\" as expressed in base \\"n\\" addend = IntegerValue(addend / n) + (addend % n); sum += addend; } // Calculate the number that must be added to the \\"sum\\" // to make it divisible by \\"n\\". int remainder = sum % n; int checkCodePoint = (n - remainder) % n; return CharacterFromCodePoint(checkCodePoint); } And the function to validate a string (with the check character as the last character) is: bool ValidateCheckCharacter(string input) { int factor = 1; int sum = 0; int n = NumberOfValidInputCharacters(); // Starting from the right, work leftwards // Now, the initial \\"factor\\" will always be \\"1\\" // since the last character is the check character. for (int i = input.Length - 1; i >= 0; i--) { int codePoint = CodePointFromCharacter(input[i]); int addend = factor * codePoint; // Alternate the \\"factor\\" that each \\"codePoint\\" is multiplied by factor = (factor  2) ? 1 : 2; // Sum the digits of the \\"addend\\" as expressed in base \\"n\\" addend = IntegerValue(addend / n) + (addend % n); sum += addend; } int remainder = sum % n; return (remainder  0); }  Algorithm in Java  Assuming the following functions are defined: int codePointFromCharacter(char character) {...} char characterFromCodePoint(int codePoint) {...} int numberOfValidInputCharacters() {...} The function to generate a check character is: char generateCheckCharacter(String input) { int factor = 2; int sum = 0; int n = numberOfValidInputCharacters(); // Starting from the right and working leftwards is easier since // the initial \\"factor\\" will always be \\"2\\". for (int i = input.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) { int codePoint = codePointFromCharacter(input.charAt(i)); int addend = factor * codePoint; // Alternate the \\"factor\\" that each \\"codePoint\\" is multiplied by factor = (factor  2) ? 1 : 2; // Sum the digits of the \\"addend\\" as expressed in base \\"n\\" addend = (addend / n) + (addend % n); sum += addend; } // Calculate the number that must be added to the \\"sum\\" // to make it divisible by \\"n\\". int remainder = sum % n; int checkCodePoint = (n - remainder) % n; return characterFromCodePoint(checkCodePoint); } And the function to validate a string (with the check character as the last character) is: boolean validateCheckCharacter(String input) { int factor = 1; int sum = 0; int n = numberOfValidInputCharacters(); // Starting from the right, work leftwards // Now, the initial \\"factor\\" will always be \\"1\\" // since the last character is the check character. for (int i = input.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) { int codePoint = codePointFromCharacter(input.charAt(i)); int addend = factor * codePoint; // Alternate the \\"factor\\" that each \\"codePoint\\" is multiplied by factor = (factor  2) ? 1 : 2; // Sum the digits of the \\"addend\\" as expressed in base \\"n\\" addend = (addend / n) + (addend % n); sum += addend; } int remainder = sum % n; return (remainder  0); }  Example   Generation  Consider the above set of valid input characters and the example input string . To generate the check character, start with the last character in the string and move left doubling every other code-point. The \\"digits\\" of the code-points as written in base 6 (since there are 6 valid input characters) should then be summed up: {  style=\\"width:500px;\\" -align=center ! Character  a  b  c  d  e  f -align=center ! Code- point  0  1  2  3  4  5 -align=center ! Double   2   6 (base 10) 10 (base 6)   10 (base 10) 14 (base 6) -align=center ! Reduce  0  2  2  1 + 0  4  1 + 4 -align=center ! Sum of digits  0  2  2  1  4  5 } The total sum of digits is 14 (0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 5). The number that must be added to obtain the next multiple of 6 (in this case, 18) is 4. This is the resulting check code-point. The associated check character is e.  Validation  The resulting string can then be validated by using a similar procedure: {  style=\\"width:500px;\\" -align=center ! Character  a  b  c  d  e  f  e -align=center ! Code-point  0  1  2  3  4  5  4 -align=center ! Double   2   6 (base 10) 10 (base 6)   10 (base 10) 14 (base 6)  -align=center ! Reduce  0  2  2  1 + 0  4  1 + 4  4 -align=center ! Sum of digits  0  2  2  1  4  5  4 } The total sum of digits is 18. Since it is divisible by 6, the check character is valid.  Implementation  The mapping of characters to code-points and back can be implemented in a number of ways. The simplest approach (akin to the original Luhn algorithm) is to use ASCII code arithmetic. For example, given an input set of 0 to 9, the code-point can be calculated by subtracting the ASCII code for '0' from the ASCII code of the desired character. The reverse operation will provide the reverse mapping. Additional ranges of characters can be dealt with by using conditional statements. Non-sequential sets can be mapped both ways using a hard-coded switch/case statement. A more flexible approach is to use something similar to an associative array. For this to work, a pair of arrays is required to provide the two-way mapping. An additional possibility is to use an array of characters where the array indexes are the code-points associated with each character. The mapping from character to code-point can then be performed with a linear or binary search. In this case, the reverse mapping is just a simple array lookup.  Weakness  This extension shares the same weakness as the original algorithm, namely, it cannot detect the transposition of the sequence to (or vice versa). This is equivalent to the transposition of 09 to 90 (assuming a set of valid input characters from 0 to 9 in order). On a positive note, the larger the set of valid input characters, the smaller the impact of the weakness.

Sobchack's work on science fiction films and phenomenology of film is perhaps her most recognized. She is a prolific writer and has authored numerous books and articles across a diverse range of subjects; from historiography to film noir to work on documentary film, new media, and film feminism. Her work has been featured in such publications as Film Comment and Camera Obscura. She is the author and editor of many books on film and media.  Biography  Sobchack was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1940 as Vivian Finsmith. Her early life was spent on Long Island until she moved to Manhattan to attend Barnard College. While at Barnard, Sobchack often frequented the nearby legendary Thalia Theater, which offered up a diverse schedule of classic and foreign films. She received her degree in English Literature in 1961 with aspirations to write fiction. She published some poetry and began work on a novel, but within two years of graduating moved into a career counseling college grads in search of their first jobs. This ultimately led her to a new position, sponsored by President Johnson‚Äôs Anti-Poverty Program, counseling troubled high school dropouts towards sustainable careers. She remained in New York until 1966 when she relocated to Salt Lake City where her husband Thomas J. Sobchack had taken an Assistant Professorship in the English Department at the University of Utah. It was there that Sobchack got her first teaching experience. She took part-time work with the University, teaching film courses‚Äîsome of the first offered in the early 1970s. She stayed with the part-time teaching at the University of Utah while she brought up her son. In Salt Lake City, she also became involved in the establishment of a film club with the intention of bringing hard-to-find films to a city with only one art house theater. The success of this film club eventually led to the inauguration of the Utah Film Festival (which, as it grew, eventually led to the establishment of the US Film Festival and ultimately, the Sundance Film Festival). Sobchack went on to pursue a more established career as a film studies professional. She earned her MA in Critical Studies from UCLA‚Äôs Department of Theater Arts/Division of Motion Pictures and Television in 1976. Her Masters Thesis became her first book, The Limits of Infinity: The American Science Fiction Film 1950-1975 (In 1987 greatly expanded and retitled Screening Space: The American Science Fiction Film). In 1978, she took a position as Visiting Lecturer at the University of Vermont in Burlington, in the Department of Communication. On her trip back to her family in Utah, she visited the University of Southern Illinois-Carbondale, where she ultimately decided to pursue her Ph.D. the following year in the Department of Speech Communication, with an emphasis on Philosophy of Language. In 1984, she was awarded her Ph.D. Her dissertation on the phenomenology of film became the basis for her groundbreaking film theory book The Address of the Eye: A Phenomenology of Film Experience (1992). Sobchack began teaching at the University of California, Santa Cruz In 1981. While at Santa Cruz, along with pursuing her own research and writing, she served in a number of administrative capacities including becoming the first Dean of the Arts Division and effectively helping to establish the University‚Äôs Film Studies curriculum. In 1992 she moved to the University of California, Los Angeles as a professor in the Critical Studies area of the UCLA Department of Film Television, and Digital Media and Associate Dean of the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. She retired from administration and currently teaches classes in Visual Phenomenology, Contemporary Film Theory, Historiography, and Cultural Studies. Sobchack is the recipient of the 1995 Pilgrim Career Award for science fiction scholarship from the Science Fiction Research Association., and also received the Society for Cinema and Media Studies Distinguished Service Award in 2005. She has served as a juror on the American Film Institute Awards Motion Picture Committee five times since 2000. She is on numerous editorial and advisory boards for print and electronic publications‚ÄîFilm Quarterly, Cultural Theory and Technology, Signs, Journal of Film and Video, Journal of Popular Film and Television, and Cinema Journal, to name a few. She has been an on-camera participant and voice-over commentator for several DVD features and featurettes. She can be seen delivering commentary, for example, on the bonus features of Dark City, Buffy the Vampire Slayer(Season 7) and Warner Bros. Tough Guys set of DVDs. She did a voice-over commentary on His Kind of Woman for Warner Bros. Film Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 3. Additionally, Sobchack is in high demand as a lecturer for conferences and presentations around the world. She has spoken at over 30 conferences and presentations in the last five years alone.

This is gone into in great depth in the introduction to The Black Dwarf.

The park forms a cross shape with the axes crossing at the Carter Center. The park stretches from west-east from Parkway Drive, just west of Boulevard, to the intersection with the north-south BeltLine Eastside Trail, to Candler Park, and north-south from Ponce de Leon Avenue to the Inman Park/Reynoldstown MARTA station. Freedom Parkway, a four-lane limited-access road, runs through the park west-to-east from the Downtown Connector to the Carter Center, where the main road turns north towards Ponce de Leon Avenue, with a branch continuing east towards Moreland Avenue. History Rise Up Atlanta by Charlie Brouwer, was a temporary sculpture made of ladders erected in Freedom Park 130px In the 1960s, the Georgia Department of Transportation began acquiring land for two east-side freeways. The north-south route would have cut north from I-20 through Virginia-Highland, creating an interchange at I-85 and continuing north as what is now SR 400\\\\. The east-west route (part of which is now Freedom Parkway) would run east from the Downtown Connector (I-75/85) to the Stone Mountain Expressway. A cloverleaf interchange for the two was to be atop the prominent hill where the neighborhood of Copenhill was demolished, and where the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum and Carter Center now stands. The east-west portion from Downtown to Copenhill and the north south portion from Copenhill north to the I-85/SR 400 interchange, was to carry the interstate number I-485. Through purchases and eminent domain, the GDOT assembled much of the central portion of the project land, and had already demolished 500 homes when local protests and lawsuits, and Governor Jimmy Carter finally stopped the project in the 1970s. That land sat vacant and overgrowing with kudzu for more than 20 years. Shortly after the 1990 selection of Atlanta for the 1996 Olympic Games, Mayor Maynard Jackson brokered a solution allowing the current parkway to be completed out to Ponce de Leon Avenue to the north and Moreland Avenue to the east. The strip of land further to the east, and land along the new parkway segment, was converted into a linear park with the help of PATH. The 207-acre (84-hectare) Freedom Park was officially dedicated on September 19, 2000 with ribbon cutters Jimmy Carter, then-current Governor Roy Barnes, and Mayor Bill Campbell. Since then it has hosted a number of outdoor sculpture displays and is a popular jogging, bike riding, and dog-walking park. With the 2012 opening of the BeltLine's busy Eastside Trail, which crosses the Freedom Park Trail just west of the Carter Center, the trail became connected to the large citywide BeltLine ring of parks and trails. Geography Freedom Parkway interchange with Downtown Connector The main portion of Freedom Parkway, running east from an oversized interchange with the Downtown Connector (I-75/85) and then north at the Carter Center to Ponce de Leon Avenue (US 78), is numbered and signed as SR 10\\\\. The \\"Freedom Parkway East\\" portion running around and to the east of the Carter Center is Georgia State Route 42 Connector, linking it to Moreland Avenue (US 23/SR 42, and the Fulton/DeKalb county line) just north of Little Five Points. This area is considered part of Poncey-Highland, one of the neighborhoods of Atlanta. This portion around the Carter Center consists of two one-way streets. Eastbound, Copenhill Avenue begins as exit ramps from SR 10 northbound and southbound, then curving northward and becoming two-way as Cleburne Avenue at the northeast corner of the library property. Westbound traffic is carried along the north side on Williams Mill Road, which then becomes two-way Ralph McGill Boulevard at a surface intersection with SR 10\\\\. Freedom Parkway East continues east of North Highland Avenue as Vaud Avenue, before ending about later at Moreland. The radio tower located immediately adjacent to the road just southwest of the Carter Center is that of WSB-TV 39 (2.1/2.2). While it appears that the \\"tunnel\\" the parkway travels through at this point is an unused overpass for a never-built road, this underpass is actually to prevent ice from falling into the roadway or onto cars during or after a winter storm. Falling ice could occur with gusty north and northwest winds from the tower itself, but one of the tower's three sets of guy wires also runs directly over the road. Public art The Bridge by Thornton Dial (1997) Public art displayed along Freedom Parkway includes Homage to King, a 1996 sculpture by Spaniard Xavier Medina-Campeny at the corner of Boulevard, which portrays Martin Luther King, Jr. outstretching his arms, and welcomes those visiting the King Historic Site.Atlanta Art Park, Freedom Park site \\"Homage to King\\", City of Atlanta public art site The Bridge, 1997, by Thornton Dial, at Ponce de Leon Avenue. portrays congressman John Lewis' \\"lifelong quest for civil and human rights\\" and the community's \\"valiant efforts\\" to stop the construction of freeways and preserve intown neighborhoods\\".Plaque at The Bridge in John Lewis Plaza in Freedom Park Future In August 2018, the name \\"Freedom Parkway\\" is planned to be changed to the name \\"John Lewis Freedom Parkway\\", in honor of U.S. Rep.

It is part of Tales of My Landlord, 4th series, along with Castle Dangerous. The novel is set in Constantinople at the end of the 11th century, during the build-up of the First Crusade and centres on the relationship between the various crusading forces and the Byzantine Emperor Alexius I Comnenus. Composition and sources After completing Anne of Geierstein at the end of April 1829, Scott's energies were devoted principally to non-fictional works, most notably a two-volume History of Scotland. But a new novel was always on his schedule; by February 1830, Scott had determined on a narrative of the First Crusade, and was soon undertaking appropriate research while working on Tales of a Grandfather and Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft. The title Robert of Paris was settled by 5 September, and composition began in November.For a full account of the composition see Walter Scott, Count Robert of Paris, ed. J. H. Alexander (Edinburgh, 2006), 381‚Äì405. In spite of concern caused by unfavourable comments on the opening chapters by James Ballantyne and Robert Cadell, Scott finished the first volume before the end of January 1831, using the services of William Laidlaw as amanuensis when he was available. In mid-March, Scott thought the second volume was complete and began the third, but there had been a miscalculation, and he had to provide additional material to bring the second volume up to the usual length. Towards the end of April only a third of the final volume remained to be written, but Scott was delayed by objections by Ballantyne and Cadell to Brenhilda's pregnancy and her combat with Anna Comnena. After a fitful attempt to change his text, Scott laid it aside to work on the second French series of Tales of a Grandfather (which was never completed), and then spent late June, July, and August writing Castle Dangerous, before completing Count Robert on 14 September: these final stages involved a good deal of textual maneuvering, including the provision of extra material consisting of an approach by Alexius to the Manichaeans, which in the event was not needed. Two days later, on 16 September, Scott accepted a suggestion by J. G. Lockhart that Count Robert should appear together with Castle Dangerous as a fourth series of Tales of my Landlord. After he had left for the Mediterranean on 29 October, Cadell and Lockhart radically revised Scott's text without any further authorial input, completing their work early in November. The two principal sources for Count Robert were Histoire de l'Empereur Al√©xis by Anna Comnena, included in Histoire de Constantinople by Louis Cousin (1672‚Äì74), and The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776‚Äì88) by Edward Gibbon. Scott was more inclined towards Gibbon's sceptical approach as opposed to Anna's panegyrics.Ibid., 498‚Äì502. Editions Tales of my Landlord, Fourth and Last Series, dated 1832, was published on 1 December 1831 by Robert Cadell in Edinburgh and Whittaker and Co. in London. The print run was 5000, and the price two guineas (¬£2 2s or ¬£2.10). Scott may have had some input into the text of the 'Magnum' edition of the series, which appeared posthumously as Volumes 46, 47, and 48 (part) in March, April, and May 1833; he sent Lockhart a list of errata from Naples on 16 February 1832, but it has not survived. He also provided an introduction for Castle Dangerous, but apparently none for Count Robert.Ibid., 405, 423‚Äì24. The standard modern edition of Count Robert of Paris, by J. H. Alexander, was published as Volume 23a of the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels in 2006; this is based on the first edition, with extensive emendations mainly from the surviving fragments of manuscript and proofs, which are designed to restore as much of Scott's original work as possible. Plot introduction Set in Constantinople at the time of the First Crusade, Count Robert of Paris portrays the impact of Western medieval values and attitudes on the sophisticated Romano-Greek classical society of the Byzantine Empire. The two main characters are Count Robert, a Frankish knight, and Hereward, an Anglo-Saxon refugee from the Norman conquest of England, serving as a mercenary soldier in the Varangian Guard of the Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Count Robert was an actual but minor historical figure who disrupted negotiations between the Crusader leaders and the Emperor by occupying the latter's throne when it was temporarily vacated. Plot summary This section of the article includes text from the revised 1898 edition of Henry Grey's A Key to the Waverley Novels (1880), now in the public domain. At the end of the 11th century, the Byzantine capital of Constantinople was threatened by Turkic nomads from the east, and by the Franks from the west. Unable to rely on his Greek subjects to repel their incursions, the emperor was obliged to maintain a body-guard of Varangians, or mercenaries from other nations, of whom the citizens and native soldiers were very jealous. One of these, the Anglo-Saxon Hereward, had just been attacked by Sebastes, when a Varangian officer, Tatius, intervened and led him to the palace. Here he was introduced to the imperial family, surrounded by their attendants; and the Princess Anna was reading a roll of history she had written, when her husband Brennius entered to announce the approach of the armies composing the first Crusade. Convinced that he was powerless to prevent their advance, the emperor offered them hospitality on their way; and, the leaders having agreed to acknowledge his sovereignty, the various hosts marched in procession before his assembled army. The Byzantine Empire in 1090 As Emperor Comnenus, however, moved forward to receive the homage of Count Bohemond, his vacant throne was insolently occupied by Count Robert of Paris, who was with difficulty compelled to vacate it, and make his submission. The defiant knight, accompanied by his wife Brenhilda, afterwards met the sage Agelastes, who related the story of an enchanted princess, and decoyed them to his hermitage overlooking the Bosphorus. Here they were introduced to the empress and her daughter, who, attended by Brennius, came to visit the sage, and were invited to return with them to the palace to be presented to the emperor. At the State banquet which followed, the guests, including Sir Bohemond, were pledged by their royal host, and urged to accept the golden cups they had used. On waking next morning, Count Robert found himself in a dungeon with a tiger, and that Ursel was confined in an adjoining one. Presently an aggressive orangutan descended through a trap-door, soon followed by the armed Sebastes. Both were overpowered by the Count, when Hereward made his appearance, and undertook to release his Norman adversary. A treasonable conference was meanwhile taking place between Tatius and Agelastes, who had failed in endeavouring to tamper with the Anglo-Saxon; and the countess had been unwillingly transported by the slave Diogenes to a garden-house for a secret interview with Brennius, whom she challenged to knightly combat in the hearing of her husband. Having hidden the count, Hereward encountered his sweetheart Bertha, who had followed Brenhilda as her attendant, and then obtained an audience of the imperial family, who were discussing recent events, including a plot in which Brennius was concerned for seizing the throne, and received permission to communicate with the Duke de Bouillon. Bertha volunteered to be his messenger, and, at an interview with the council of Crusaders at Scutari, she induced them to promise that fifty knights, each with ten followers, should attend the combat to support their champion. Interior of Pammakaristos Church, Constantinople, built shortly before the First Crusade Having made his confession to the Patriarch, while Agelastes was killed by the orangutan as he argued with Brenhilda respecting the existence of the devil, the emperor led his daughter to the cell in which Ursel was confined, with the intention of making him her husband, instead of Brennius. She had, however, been persuaded by her mother to intercede for the traitor, and Ursel was merely placed under the care of the slave doctor Douban to be restored to health after his long imprisonment. The emperor had decided that Brennius should fight the Count of Paris, instead of the countess, and all the preparations for the combat had been made, when the ships conveying the Crusaders hove in sight; and, after defeating the Greek fleet, they landed in sight of the lists. Brennius, in the meantime, was pardoned, and, in answer to shouts of discontent from the assembled crowd, Ursel was led forth to announce his restoration to liberty and the imperial favour, and the conspiracy was crushed. Hereward then appeared to do battle with Count Robert, and, saved from the knight's axe by Bertha, he joined the Crusaders, obtaining on his return the hand of his betrothed, and, ultimately, a grant of land from William Rufus, adjacent to the New Forest in Hampshire, where he had screened her when a girl from the tusk of a wild boar.

In other editions (where there are substantial differences in the text, especially towards the end of the novel) Chapters 24 and 25 are not divided: the different numbers are given in square brackets. Volume One Ch. 1: The narrator provides a brief history of Constantinople and its decline before introducing the Emperor Alexius. Ch. 2: A succession of citizens react to the Anglo-Saxon Hereward walking and sleeping at the Golden Gate. He repels an attack by Sebastes, one of the guard under the centurion Harpax, before being escorted to the imperial palace by Achilles Tatius, who fills him in on procedures. Ch. 3: Achilles introduces Hereward at Court, where Anna Comnena asks him to indicate any inaccuracies in her account of the battle of Laodicea. Ch. 4: Hereward is moved by Anna's reading of her account of the battle, where his brother died. Ch. 5: Anna's husband Nicephorus Briennius brings news of a new advance by the Crusaders. Hereward gives his unfavourable view of the Normans. Ch. 6: Achilles asks Hereward to observe the conduct of the sage Agelastes, with a view to ascertaining how he obtains influence at Court. Ch. 7: Alexius gives orders to impede the Crusaders' advance. After transmitting this welcome news to his fellow-Varangians, Hereward is conducted by a black slave to the ruins of the temple of Cybele. Ch. 8: At the temple Hereward resists the advances of Agelastes, who tempts him with theological unorthodoxy and an invitation to favour Achilles above the Emperor, and claims to be able to give him news about his beloved Bertha. Achilles and Agelastes plot against Alexius. Achilles teases Hereward about Agelastes. Ch. 9: A month later, the Crusaders agree to be subject to Alexius, but Count Robert disrupts the fealty ceremony on the shores of the Propontis. Ch. 10: The narrator sketches the relationship between Robert and Brenhilda. On their way back to Constantinople they meet Agelastes, who tells them the story of the sleeping princess of Zulichium, resulting in Robert's expression of unflinching devotion to his wife. They accept his invitation to visit his kiosk. Ch. 11: On their way to the kiosk the Count and Countess rout an aggressive band of Scythians. Ch. 12: Agelastes welcomes the martial pair to his retreat, and guests are heard approaching. Volume Two Ch. 1 (13): The imperial party arrive at the kiosk, where Nicephorus offends Brenhilda by his flirtatious manner at table. On the way back to the city, Hereward quarrels with Count Robert as a Norman. Agelastes advises Alexius that Robert and Brenhilda may be tamed by appealing to their love of fame. Ch. 2 (14): Alexius and Agelastes distrust each other. Robert breaks one of the mechanical lions of Solomon guarding the imperial throne. Alexius and Agelastes plan how to deal with the Crusaders, and Alexius makes Robert and Bohemond uneasy with each other. Ch. 3 (15): Robert wakes up to find himself in a prison cell. He kills a tiger and makes contact with Ursel in a neighbouring cell. Ch. 4 (16): The ourang-outang Sylvan leaps into the cell: Robert spares his life but kills his keeper Sebastes. He then fights Hereward, but they agree to join forces to seek Brenhilda and help Ursel. Ch. 5 (17): Achilles and Agelastes discuss further their conspiracy against Alexius, one stage of which involves promoting Nicephorus and pandering to his desire for Brenhilda. The sage's servant Dionysus informs him that Brenhilda is in the garden-house, to which he admits Nicephorus by unblocking a postern. Ch. 6 (18): In the dungeon Hereward and Robert assess Brenhilda's situation. They go to the garden-house, where they overhear Brenhilda preparing for Nicephorus. When he arrives she offers to fight him herself, in the absence of her husband. Ch. 7 (19): Robert expresses his confidence in Brenhilda's ability to defeat Nicephorus, and Hereward affords him accommodation in his quarters. Hereward returns to Agelastes' garden, where he reports to Achilles that Robert is at liberty and receives a warrant to apprehend him. Ch. 8 (20): On his way to his quarters, Hereward encounters Bertha, who has been alarmed by Sylvan. The narrator relates their story. Bertha expresses her anxiety about Brenhilda's readiness for combat for a reason she cannot divulge, and Hereward offers himself as a reserve champion if Robert doesn't appear to do battle in her stead. Hereward tells Robert he will arrange for the Count and himself to be present at the combat. Ch. 9 (21): Alexius tells Anna and his wife Irene that Hereward has revealed the treacherous plans of Nicephorus and his associates. He agrees that Robert should be at Hereward's disposal, and that a contingent of troops under the Duke of Bouillon should attend the lists in case of treachery against Brenhilda. Ch. 10 (22): Hereward hears in the street a proclamation of the combat between Nicephorus and Robert, and discusses with Achilles its implications for the plot. At his quarters, Bertha agrees to take a message to Geoffrey de Bouillon and Tancred of Otranto. Ch. 11 (23): Vexhalia sees her husband Osmund off on Bertha's mission. Bertha delivers the message to Bouillon and Tancred, and their troops achieve technical compliance with their undertaking to Alexius by adopting a retrograde motion to each of the boats conveying them to Constantinople. Volume Three Ch. 1 (24): There is much speculation in Constantinople as to what is going on, and Alexius resolves to consult the Patriarch Zosimus. Ch. 2 (25) [24 ctd]: Zosimus reassures Alexius that his future reputation is secure and suggests that the fate of Ursel (believed to have been starved to death) is a central issue in the prevailing unrest. Ch. 3 (26) [25]: Agelastes attempts to convert Brenhilda to his scepticism and is killed by Sylvan. Ch. 4 (27) [26]: In the dungeon Alexius introduces Ursel to Anna as a potential future husband. Rushing up the steps she encounters Hereward, who comforts her. Irene pleads with Anna that Nicephorus be pardoned: Anna's initial severity is tempered when her husband is revealed and joins in the plea. She insists, though, that he should remain in captivity and not take part in the combat. Ch. 5 (28) [27]: Alexius commits Ursel to the care of the medical slave Douban. The next morning, seeking his co-operation, he finds him devoid of earthly aspirations. Ch. 6 (29) [28] : Ursel tells Douban he is ready to help Alexius and then retire to a monastery. Ch. 7 (30) [29]: The seating arrangements at the lists, prioritising the Varangians, offends Harpax and other supporters of the Immortals (the military √©lite). Tancred's troops arrive, surviving heavy attack by the imperial admiral. Ch. 8 (31) [30]: Alexius despatches a confused Achilles, together with his rival Nicanor, commander of the Greek army, to negotiate with Tancred. Ch. 9 (32) [31] : Alexius pardons Nicephorus on his way to execution. Peeved at being used as a pawn, Anna decides to offer to fight Brenhilda, believing her father will not permit it. Ch. 20 (33) [32]: Tancred makes clear that his intentions are pacific, and Achilles sees him as likely to frustrate the conspiracy against Alexius. Ursel is revealed to the people and gives Alexius his support. Ch. 21 (34) [33]: Alexius announces Agelastes' death and grants a general pardon. Anna insists on proceeding with the combat, against Douban's advice. As the duel is about to begin, Alexius directs that instead the matter be resolved by means of a riddle presented by Anna to Brenhilda. The Countess rejects the riddle, but as the combat begins her pregnant condition disables her. In a second combat Robert betters Hereward, but he spares him at Bertha's appeal and accepts him into his crusading service. Sylvan appears and is entrusted to Hereward's care. Five months later, Brenhilda gives birth to a son. Ch. 22 (35) [34]: The narrator presents Anna's account of her father's remaining career and death. After being wounded at the battle of Doryl√¶um, Robert retires to France and arranges a Hampshire estate for Hereward. The author takes his farewell. Reception Two-thirds of the reviews of Count Robert were appreciative, and even enthusiastic.For an annotated list of most of the contemporaneous reviews of Tales of my Landlord (fourth series) see James Clarkson Corson, A Bibliography of Sir Walter Scott (Edinburgh and London, 1943), 275. The knowledge that the fourth series of Tales of my Landlord was probably Scott's last publication may well have played a part in the favourable reception, and there was not much detailed criticism of the volumes, but most of the reviewers found in Count Robert abundant evidence of the author's powers of characterisation, story-telling, description, and historical recreation. A couple of the enthusiasts did discern a tendency to tedium in dialogue or descriptive detail, and the minority who judged the publication a failure added accusations of improbability, narrative vagueness, disgust, dubious morality, and tastelessness.

It is part of Tales of My Landlord, 4th series, with Count Robert of Paris. The castle of the title is Douglas Castle in Lanarkshire, and the action, based on an episode in The Brus by John Barbour, is set in March 1307 against the background of the First War of Scottish Independence. Composition and sources Scott wrote Castle Dangerous, using William Laidlaw as his amanuensis, in late June, July, and August 1831 during a break in his composition of Count Robert of Paris following objections raised by James Ballantyne and Robert Cadell to Brenhilda's pregnancy and combat with Anna Comnena.For a full account of the composition see Walter Scott, Castle Dangerous, ed. J. H. Alexander (Edinburgh, 2006), 209‚Äì16. He had written about a third of a volume by 3 July (though he thought he had done much more) and, taking time off to visit the scene of the novel at Douglas, actually completed the volume on 1 August. There were further interruptions that month, when his mind was confused, and when Laidlaw was ill, but the work was finished around 9 September. There was not enough material for a complete second volume, though, so Scott was happy to accept the suggestion by J. G. Lockhart that the two novels be published together in four volumes as a fourth series of Tales of my Landlord. After Scott had left for the Mediterranean on 29 October, Cadell and Lockhart radically revised his text without any further authorial input, completing the work in mid-November. Although Scott was very familiar with the standard sources for Scottish medieval history, for Castle Douglas he used two sources almost exclusively: the narrative poem The Bruce by John Barbour (d. 1395), and The History of the Houses of Douglas and Angus (1644; reissued 1648) by David Hume of Godscroft. As usual, he makes chronological adjustments for his fictional purposes.Ibid., 386‚Äì89. Editions Tales of my Landlord, Fourth and Last Series, dated 1832, was published on 1 December 1831 by Robert Cadell in Edinburgh and Whittaker and Co. in London. The print run was 5000 and the price two guineas (¬£2 2s or ¬£2.10). Scott may have had some input into the text of the Magnum edition of the fourth series of Tales of my Landlord, which appeared posthumously as Volumes 47, 47, and 48 (part) in March, April, and May 1833: he sent Lockhart a list of errata from Naples on 16 February 1832, but it has not survived, and in any case Scott's accompanying letter refers only to Count Robert of Paris. He also provided an Introduction for Castle Dangerous (but apparently none for Count Robert).Ibid., 216, 260‚Äì61. The standard modern edition of Castle Dangerous, by J. H. Alexander, was published as Volume 23b of the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels in 2006: this is based on the first edition, with extensive emendations mainly from the surviving manuscript and proofs, designed to restore as much of Scott's work as possible. Plot introduction The story is set in Lanarkshire in March 1307.Ibid., 385. Lady Augusta has promised to marry Sir John de Walton provided that he can maintain possession of the castle he has captured for a year and a day. Regretting her promise, she resolves to travel in disguise to the castle to find some method of subversion. The story had already been told in brief in his essay on 'Chivalry' for the Encyclopaedia Britannica in 1818, and in spite his failing health and a recent decline in popularity due to his politics, Scott made an effort to visit the area to collect information and adjust descriptions. Pained by James Ballantyne's criticisms of Count Robert of Paris, and by his unexpected disagreement on the subject of the recent Reform Bill, Scott did not discuss the book with him.Edgar Johnson, Sir Walter Scott: The Great Unknown (London, 1970), 1183‚Äì84. Only one ruined tower remains of Douglas Castle, and that dates from the 17th century. Scott called this area \\"Douglasdale\\"The term Douglasdale was used in the 'Magnum' preface to Castle Dangerous, transmitted from Naples, Italy early in 1832. See Walter Scott, Introductions and Notes from The Magnum Opus: Ivanhoe to Castle Dangerous, ed. J. H. Alexander with P. D. Garside and Claire Lamont (Edinburgh, 2012), 583, 589. Plot summary During the struggle for the Scottish crown between Edward I and Robert Bruce, the stronghold of his adherent Sir James Douglas, known as Castle Dangerous, has been taken by the English, and Lady Augusta has promised her hand and fortune to its new governor, Sir John de Walton, on condition that he holds it for a year and a day. Anxious to curtail this period, she determines to make her way thither, accompanied by her father's minstrel, Bertram, disguised as his son, and they are within three miles of their destination, when fatigue compels them to seek shelter at Tom Dickson's farm. Two English archers, who are quartered there, insist that the youth (Lady Augusta in disguise) should be left at the neighbouring convent of St Bride's, until Bertram satisfies Sir John as to the object of their journey, and this arrangement is approved of by Sir Aymer de Valance, the deputy governor, who arrives to visit the outpost. As they proceed together towards the castle, the minstrel entertains the young knight with some curious legends respecting it, including the supernatural preservation of an ancient lay relating to the house of Douglas, and the future fate of the British kingdom generally. De Valance would pass the stranger into the stronghold as a visitor at once; but the old archer Gilbert Greenleaf detains him in the guard room until the arrival of the governor, who, in the hearing of Fabian, Sir Aymer's squire, expresses his disapproval of his deputy's imprudence, and thus the seeds of disagreement are sown between them. Part of Bothwell Castle, a similar castle also in South Lanarkshire Sir John, however, wishes to be indulgent to his young officers, and accordingly arranges a hunting party, in which the Scottish vassals in the neighbourhood are invited to join; but, at the mid-day repast, a forester named Turnbull behaves so rudely to the governor that he orders him to be secured, when he suddenly plunges into a ravine and disappears. The young knight takes fresh offence at being ordered to withdraw the archers from the sport to reinforce the garrison, and appeals to his uncle, the Earl of Pembroke, who, instead of taking his part, writes him a sharp reproof. He then opposes the governor's wish that the minstrel should terminate his visit, which induces Sir John to threaten Bertram with torture unless he instantly reveals his purpose in coming to the castle. The minstrel declines to do so without his son's permission; and, the Abbot having pleaded for delay on account of the boy's delicate health, Sir Aymer is ordered to meet a detachment at an outpost, and then to bring him to the castle to be examined. As he passes through the town he encounters a mounted warrior in full armour, whom neither the inhabitants nor his followers will admit to having seen. The old sexton, however, declares that the spirits of the deceased knights of Douglas cannot rest in their graves while the English are at enmity with their descendants. On reaching the convent, De Valence rouses Father Jerome, and insists that the youth (Lady Augusta) should at once accompany him. He is, however, allowed to return to his bed till daybreak, and upon the door of his room being then forced open, it is empty. During the night, Sister Ursula, who has hidden in the room, elicits Lady Augusta's secret, which she has already guessed, and, having narrated the circumstances under which she had entered the convent without taking the vows, they escape through a concealed postern and find a guide waiting for them with horses. A scroll which his lady-love had left behind her explains matters to Sir John, who, in his despair, is comforted by the sympathy of his lieutenant; and the faithful minstrel, having been admitted to their confidence, steps are at once taken to track the fugitives. Having reached a thicket, Sister Ursula (whose original name is Lady Margaret) disappears to join her friends, and Lady Augusta is escorted, first by the celebrated Douglas, and then by Turnbull, to a spot where they meet Sir John, to whom the forester delivers a message with which he refuses to comply, and mortally wounds the man when he attempts to lead the lady away. But Sir James is at hand, and the two knights fight until summoned by the church bells to Palm Sunday service, at which the old bishop officiates in the presence of an excited assemblage of armed English and Scotch warriors eager to attack each other. Bertram meets Lady Augusta in the churchyard, and is arranging for her safety, when De Walton and The Douglas renew their combat, and an encounter also takes place between De Valence and Sir Malcolm Fleming, Lady Margaret's lover. The life of Sir Malcolm is saved by the intercession of Lady Margaret, and Sir John surrenders his sword and governorship on the arrival of a messenger with the intelligence that an English force, commanded by the Earl of Pembroke, which was advancing to prevent an anticipated attack on the castle, has been utterly defeated by Bruce and his followers. He and his troops, however, are allowed to retire with their arms, Sir James Douglas having chivalrously transferred his claim upon her lover to the Lady Augusta of Berkeley, who, in return for his courtesy, decorates the brave Scotchman with a chain of brilliants which were won in battle by her ancestor.

Ch. 2: Arriving at Hazelside, Bertram and Augustine are questioned by the garrison there. It is agreed that Augustine should stay at the nearby convent. Sir Aymer de Valence arrives and examines Bertram courteously. Ch. 3: On the way to Douglas, Bertram and Aymer discuss the relationship between military exploits and minstrelsy. Ch. 4: Aymer tells Bertram the story of the Douglas Larder, as the minstrel reflects on military inhumanity and his desire for peace in Britain. Ch. 5: Bertram tells Aymer of his desire to discover a manuscript produced by Thomas the Rhymer, encountered in the spirit by the minstrel Hugo Hugonet. Aymer admits Bertram into Douglas Castle in spite of the misgivings of Gilbert Greenleaf, but he begins to have doubts and says that the approval of Sir John de Walton will be required. Walton arrives, and Aymer's squire Fabian overhears Greenleaf warning him about the lad's influence: he conveys a distorted version of these remarks to his master, setting in train an awkwardness between Aymer and Walton. Ch. 6: Walton proposes a hunting relaxation for the garrison. Aymer is uncharmed, but preparations go ahead. Ch. 7: At the hunting breakfast, the forester Michael Turnbull defies Walton and makes his escape with great agility. Ch. 8: The relationship between Aymer and Walton deteriorates further. Aymer argues against interrogating Bertram under torture. Greenleaf maintains to Walton that the minstrel is a dubious character. Bertram has found fragments of the Rhymer's manuscript: Walton questions him, without torture, and allows him to write to Augustine for permission to divulge the purpose of their visit. Ch. 9: Walton takes Bertram's letter to the convent, but Augustine declines to answer it till noon the next day. Returning to the castle, Walton instructs Aymer to go with a detachment to Hazelside and wait for Augustine to deliver himself up. In the town, Aymer encounters a strange horseman bearing the Douglas arms. He seeks out the sexton Lazarus Powheid, who maintains that the spirits of the old Douglasses cannot rest in peace following the dishonouring of their monuments and the downfall of their house. Aymer directs that he be taken before Walton. Ch. 10: After Aymer has had discussions with Abbot Jerome and Augustine, the young man is guarded in preparation for his removal to the castle, but in the morning his room is discovered to be empty. Ch. 11: [retrospective] Augustine (Augusta) and Sister Ursula (Margaret de Hautlieu) share their stories before fleeing the convent. Volume Two Ch. 1 (12): Aymer and Jerome react to a letter left by Augustine forgiving Aymer but rebuking Walton. Returning to the castle, Aymer tells Walton he has noted down his understanding of Augustine's secret. Ch. 2 (13): In Bertram's cell Aymer reveals to Walton the truth about the disguised Augusta's identity and attempts to console him. They determine to seek her. Ch. 3 (14): While the search for them goes on, Augusta and Margaret debate the best course of action. Augusta reluctantly accepts the protection of the Knight of the Tomb (Sir James Douglas). Ch. 4 (15): Douglas guides Augusta, as if bewildering her, but assuring her of his good faith. Ch. 5 (16): The pair meet up with Douglas's retainers, and Turnbull offers to take Augusta (on parole) to Walton, with a letter giving the terms for her freedom. Ch. 6 (17): Turnbull and a colleague convey Augusta in a surreal manner to a forest, where they meet Walton. Turnbull negotiates with the knight, but they come to blows and Turnbull is wounded. Douglas arrives and fights Walton till a truce is agreed at Augusta's request. Ch. 7 (18): Bertram expounds the Rhymer's prophecies to Greenleaf, and they agree to seek out the portentous location known as Bloody Sykes referred to by Thomas as having particular significance for the relationship between Douglas and the English. Ch. 8 (19): Bertram and Greenleaf pass the spot where Douglas and Walton fought [probably Bloody Sykes]. They reach the church, where Augusta, disguised as a pilgrim, secretly identifies herself to Bertram but arouses Greenleaf's suspicions. The Bishop of Glasgow arrives for the Palm Sunday rites and tries to pacify the dying Turnbull. The Scots answer a challenge to combat by the English. Ch. 9 (20): The Bishop's efforts to preserve peace are helped by general admiration for a reconciliation between Walton and Augusta. He tries unsuccessfully to commend the disfigured Margaret to Sir Malcolm Fleming. Douglas's attempt to divert attention from Fleming sparks a general conflict, which is narrowed down to encounters between Aymer and Fleming, and Douglas and Walton. Fleming defeats Aymer, with Margaret's help. The duel between Douglas and Walton is interrupted by news of the Earl of Pembroke's defeat at Loudon Hill. Walton surrenders the castle to Douglas, who in turn yields Augusta to him. Many months later, Fleming is reconciled with Margaret (her disfiguration skilfully minimised) after a chance encounter. The author takes his leave. In this final chapter the Edinburgh Edition text differs substantially from that in other editions. Reception With two exceptions, the reviews of Castle Dangerous were generally appreciative, and even enthusiastic. For an annotated list of most of the contemporaneous reviews of Tales of my Landlord (fourth series) see James Clarkson Corson, A Bibliography of Sir Walter Scott (Edinburgh and London, 1943), 275. The knowledge that the fourth series of Tales of my Landlord was probably Scott's last publication may well have played a part in the favourable reception, and there was not much detailed criticism of the volumes, with Castle Dangerous sometimes largely or entirely passed over; but there was substantial praise for the characterisation, the local description, and the dramatic story. As for the dissenters, the Literary Test found the story more interesting than in Count Robert but was put off by the mystery and superstition, and the Monthly Review was unable to finish a work which read like a feeble and awkward imitation of the master.

It is therefore sometimes employed to crystallize highly lipophilic compounds. It is used in liquid bandages (spray on plasters) such as cavilon spray, to protect damaged skin from irritation from other bodily fluids. It is also used to soften and remove adhesive residues left by medical tape and bandages, without causing further skin irritation. HMDSO is being studied for making low-k dielectric materials for the semi-conductor industries by PECVD (plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition). HMDSO has been used as a reporter molecule to measure tissue oxygen tension (pO2). HMDSO is highly hydrophobic and exhibits high gas solubility, and hence strong nuclear magnetic resonance spin lattice relaxation rate (R1) response to changes in pO2.

Courts-martial are conducted under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (Title 10 of the United States Code ¬ß¬ß 801-946), and the Manual for Courts-Martial. If the trial results in a conviction, the case is reviewed by the convening authority (the person who referred the case for trial by court- martial). The convening authority has discretion to mitigate the findings and sentence. Review court If the sentence, as approved by the convening authority, includes death, a bad conduct or dishonorable discharge, dismissal of an officer, or confinement for one year or more, the case is reviewed by an intermediate court. For the Navy and Marine Corps, this is the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals. Description The Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals (NMCCA) is located in Washington, D.C. in the Navy Yard. The court conducts mandatory review (unless waived by the appellant) of all courts-martial of members of the naval service referred to the court pursuant to Articles 62, 66, 69, and 73 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. When necessary in furtherance of its jurisdiction, the Court reviews all petitions for extraordinary relief properly filed before it (28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1651). The United States military justice system commonly uses four writs: mandamus, prohibition, error coram nobis, and habeas corpus. A writ of mandamus is an order from a court of competent jurisdiction that requires the performance of a specified act by an inferior court or authority.Black's Law Dictionary at 866 (5th ed. 1979) The writ of prohibition is used to prevent the commission of a specified act or issuance of a particular order.Black's Law Dictionary at 1091. The writ of error, coram nobis, is used to bring an issue before the court that previously decided the same issue. It allows the court to review error of fact or a retroactive change in the law that which affects the validity of the prior proceeding.Black's Law Dictionary at 487. The writ of habeas corpus is used to challenge either the legal basis for or the manner of confinement.Black's Law Dictionary at 638. The court has the statutory authority to determine whether the findings of guilty and the sentence are correct in law and fact for all courts-martial reviewed under Article 66, UCMJ (about 96% of the Court's work), and to take corrective action if prejudicial error has occurred. Such action includes setting aside or modifying the findings and/or the sentence, ordering a rehearing, and dismissing charges and specifications. Unless reversed by a higher court, such action is binding on all parties, including all officials of the United States. The court's published opinions are binding precedent for the conduct of courts-martial in the naval service. The Courts of Criminal Appeals review cases for legal error, factual sufficiency, and sentence appropriateness. All other cases are subject to review by judge advocates under regulations issued by each service. After such review, the Judge Advocate General may refer a case to the appropriate Court of Criminal Appeals. The Courts of Criminal Appeals also have jurisdiction under Article 62 of the UCMJ to consider appeals by the United States of certain judicial rulings during trial. Review under Article 62 is limited to issues involving alleged legal errors. Bluebook citation form for this Court is provided in Table T.1 (N-M. Ct. Crim.

The inverted N of chimneys on the West Face of Douglas Boulder can be climbed at grades ranging from Difficult to Severe. Tower Ridge is one of several ridges protruding north east from the summit plateau of Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in the United Kingdom. Technical description The ridge starts close to the Charles Inglis Clark hut below Coire Leis and terminates close to the highest point of the mountain. The normal route up Tower Ridge is a graded 3S as a scramble (the highest scrambling grade), and contains short pitches of rock climbing graded as difficult. It is one of the few mountain routes in Scotland with sufficient length and exposure to be considered Alpine in character. In winter it is graded Scottish Grade IV, partly because most of its difficulties (in particular the Eastern Traverse and the Tower Gap), lie high up on the route. A number of distinct features can be identified on the ridge. In ascending order, these are (page references are to the SMC's 2002 Climbers' Guide, edited by Simon Richardson): Most parties bypass the Douglas Boulder (centre) to join Tower Ridge from East Gully (left) up to the Douglas Gap; it is easier still to scramble onto the ridge by a right-rising traverse from the left end of the large, high snowpatch.Even as late as June, snow can block access to the foot of East Gully on the Douglas Boulder, in which case the eastern flank of the boulder can be scrambled. # The Douglas Boulder, a 200m high semi-cone separated from the ridge proper by gullies on the east and west sides meeting at the Douglas Gap. If climbed from the lowest point by Direct Route (Very Difficult) this offers the most challenging climbing on the ridge. Many parties avoid it (p105), usually by scrambling up East gully (Easy). South-West Ridge (Moderate) to the immediate left of West Gully (Easy) is the easiest face route up the boulder (p112), and a short descent of the same ridge and thence into West Gully is the easiest route down into the Douglas Gap from the top (p107). # The Douglas Gap, where parties avoiding the Douglas Boulder via East Gully join the direct line. Tower Ridge proper is then gained via the 20m \\"tricky chimney\\" (p106), which became the crux of the route following rockfalls at Tower Gap on and after 30 July 2011. It is well-polished and the exit is delicate in damp conditions. # A short, almost level section after Douglas Gap, which steepens to a short wall sometimes mistaken for the Little Tower. The wall can be climbed or bypassed by following an obvious ledge leading up to the right (p105) and climbing back up to the crest. Either route is easy to follow thanks to the abundance of crampon-scratches that mark out the lines of least resistance through these and indeed all awkward sections of the ridge. # Another easy-angled section with several undulations and some exposure where it passes over the Great Chimney (Severe, p104) on the east flank (diagram p101). # The Little Tower, which heralds a sustained steepening of the ridge but is itself \\"little more than a step\\" 50m beyond the Great Chimney (p105). # The Great Tower, a much more imposing steepening of the ridge reached after a short level section and a few easy ledges. The two direct ascents (Pigott's and Bell's routes) up the front of the Great Tower are both graded Very Difficult so these are typically avoided by taking the Eastern Traverse, a high ledge traversing to the left and through a flake tunnel before climbing \\"tricky short walls\\" (p106) directly up the side of the tower to a small cairn at the top.Crossing Tower Gap above Glover's Chimney: this horizontal problem is difficult to protect. Climbers on the Easter Traverse below the Great Tower in full winter conditions # Tower Gap, a small nick in the ridge beyond the Great Tower, and the old crux of the route. The gap is no more than three metres deep but the ridge approach narrows at this point to about one metre wide, with steep drops to either side. Although the \\"quite tricky\\" descent into the gap can be done directly the easiest line is on the left side of the final block; the climb out is \\"straightforward\\" (p105). The upper tower and descent into the gap can be bypassed altogether by extending the Eastern Traverse slightly downwards and then further round instead of entering the flake tunnel, regaining the ridge at or beyond the gap or escaping into the neighbouring Tower Gully (Easy, p100). # A final easy scramble from above Tower Gap to the summit plateau. History Tower Ridge was first climbed in descent by J., E. and B. Hopkins on 3 September 1892. They had ascended it as far as the Great Tower the previous day. The first ascent and first winter ascent was Norman Collie, Godfrey Solly and J.Collier on 29 March 1894. They turned the Great Tower on the right by the Western Traverse, which is harder than the Eastern Traverse; the route normally used today.G.

Japan  Some Japanese railway stations have platform gap fillers, which are known as . Over 200 fillers are used in the Tokyo subway. New York City Subway The Interborough Rapid Transit Company's first cars were built with only two doors on each side, at the extreme ends of the car, lining up with the curved platforms so as not to leave a wide gap between the train and the platform. When the IRT modified existing cars and ordered new cars with a middle door, gap fillers were needed because the middle door was not near the platform. After the City of New York bought the IRT in 1940, new car designs (starting with the R12) had the end doors away from the extreme ends of the car body, which also required the use of gap fillers at certain stations. Stations equipped IRT stations with gap fillers are: * South Ferry, outer loop. The station closed on March 16, 2009 and was replaced by a new station which does not require gap fillers. After the latter station was damaged by flooding during Hurricane Sandy, the loop station was reopened as a temporary terminus on April 4, 2013. The 2009-era station reopened on June 27, 2017. * Brooklyn Bridge ‚Äì City Hall (IRT Lexington Avenue Line) originally had gap fillers on the express platforms. These were deactivated when the station was extended northward. These gap fillers are still in place and can be seen just south of the current platforms. * 14th Street ‚Äì Union Square (IRT Lexington Avenue Line) has gap fillers on both tracks on the downtown platform. There may have been gap fillers on the uptown express platform. A new design of gap filler was installed in 2004 to provide maintenance access from the platform rather than requiring crews to stand at track level. * Times Square (IRT 42nd Street Shuttle) has them on Shuttle tracks 1 and 3. They are mounted under the platform rather than on it, so they are not ADA accessible. They are to be removed following the reconstruction of the shuttle.  Singapore  Platform gap fillers are used in the Mass Rapid Transit system of Singapore, namely the North South MRT Line and the East West MRT Line. Platform gap fillers are also planned for installation on trains on the North East MRT Line and the Circle MRT Line as well, because newer trains can be equipped with gap fillers.  London Underground  With the introduction of the NTfL, Transport for London are hoping to introduce platform gap fillers on the Bakerloo, Central & Piccadilly lines (of which 14 platforms have been identified for installation) at curved platforms such as Bank, where the gap between the train and the platform can exceed 1 foot.

Career Mountain bike career Cioni began his career as a professional mountain bike racer at the age of 19. He found success early with victory in the Italian Winter Championship and second place at both the Italian Cup and Italian Championships. Selected to represent Italy at the World Championships, Cioni finished tenth. He continued with similar results through his mountain bike career, with several top five placings at World Cup events including second at St. Wendel in 1996. Cioni also rode some Cyclo-cross towards the end of the nineties. Road racing career In 2000, Cioni was selected for the team, alongside, amongst others, Filippo Pozzato, Fabian Cancellara, Michael Rogers and Charlie Wegelius. His intention was to use the training on the road to help his mountain bike career with the specific aim of riding for Italy at the 2000 Summer Olympics. However, he was not selected for the Olympics and it was at this point that Cioni decided to concentrate on road racing. In his first season, Cioni won a stage of the Tour of Slovenia and was second in a stage of the Tour de Normandie. He also rode his first Vuelta a Espa√±a. In 2001, Cioni won his first stage race, the Vuelta Minho in Portugal. Cioni moved to in 2003, where he was used as a domestique for Alessandro Petacchi. Whilst Petacchi flourished that season, Cioni had no notable results. It was in 2004 that Cioni made his breakthrough in sustaining his abilities in time trialing and climbing through important stage races. After a promising Tour de Romandie, where he finished fifth overall, Cioni finished fourth in the Giro d'Italia and followed this up with third place in the Tour de Suisse. Cioni was subsequently chosen to represent Italy at the World Cycling Championships, however, was not allowed to complete when he registered a hematocrit level over 50%. Although Cioni was aware his hematocrit level was naturally high, he had failed to get an exemption and personal level from the Italian federation in 1999, since his level was not consistently higher than 50%, but consistently around it. The UCI awarded Cioni an exemption certificate, with a personal level, after further tests in October 2004.www.cyclingnews.com ‚Äì the world centre of cycling In 2005, Cioni moved to the newly formed team where, despite being one of the team's leaders and hence liberated from the role of domestique, he had no notable successes. The best that Cioni achieved at Liquigas was a second place in stage four in the 2005 Giro d'Italia, third place at the 2005 Italian National time trial championships and sixth place overall at the 2006 Tour de Romandie. In 2007, Cioni moved to the Belgian ProTour team . His first victory with this team came when he won the first stage of that year's Vuelta a Andaluc√≠a, outsprinting his breakaway companion Ant√≥n Luengo. In 2011 he announced his retirement from racing, and moved into a public relations role with his final pro team, . He was also appointed as a member of the inaugural UCI Athletes' Commission in 2011. He originally served as a business manager with the team, combining the role with work as a press officer. He switched roles and became one of the team's directeurs sportifs in 2014. Personal life He currently lives in Montelupo Fiorentino, Tuscany, with his wife. In 2004, Cioni graduated from the European School of Economics with an honours degree in International Business with specialisation in Sports Management.

Born in Montreal, he was part of an ethnic French family that had been fur trading in New France since the late 17th century. Biography Baby was born in 1733 in Montreal to a family of fur traders. His father, and grandfather Jacques Babie, had been successful in the business. His eldest brother Jacques and other family members were active in the same business. After completing formal education at the Jesuit college at Quebec, he joined his brothers Jacques and Antoine in a fur trading business they called Baby Fr√®res. His two brothers conducted the field operations, while Fran√ßois ran the Montreal operation, importing trade goods and exporting furs and dealing with their contacts in France. Baby was appointed to the Legislative Council for the Province of Quebec in 1778 by Governor Haldimand. He appointed Baby as part of his unconstitutional privy council around that time. (This appointment placed Baby on the Legislative Council of Lower Canada when it was formed in 1792.) Joining the governing class meant that Baby had less time to spend on commercial activities. In 1786, he had married Marie-Anne Tarieu, the daughter of seigneur Charles-Fran√ßois Tarieu de La Naudi√®re. He suffered from ill health later in life and became less active in politics. Baby died at Quebec City in 1820. His son Charles-Fran√ßois-Xavier later served as a member of the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada.

She founded a school for girls in Ningbo, Zhejiang. Her pioneering the field of mission work for single women in China was the most remarkable outcome of her life. Biography Aldersey was a native of London from a wealthy nonconformist family. She studied Chinese under Robert Morrison in London when he was on home leave from 1824 to 1826. Also in attendance were Samuel Dyer and his wife Maria Tarn. The friendship that she forged with Maria eventually led to her inviting their orphaned teenage daughters to work with her in China. In London, Aldersey was still attached to family ties, but she made gifts to the London Missionary Society that enabled Maria Newell to go to Malacca (1827) where Newell met and married pioneer missionary Karl G√ºtzlaff. In 1837, she herself was able to go to Surabaya, where she started a school for Chinese girls. When the treaty ports in China were opened (1843) she moved to Ningbo where she opened a school for girls assisted by three teenagers, Mary Ann Leisk, Ruth Ati and Christiana A-Kit. Ruth Ati and Christiana were from Surabaya. Never an agent of any missionary society, Miss Aldersey did maintain close links with the London Missionary Society. Several of her teaching staff were Chinese-speaking daughters of missionaries; at least four became missionary wives, including Burella Hunter Dyer who married John Shaw Burdon, Maria Jane Dyer, who married James Hudson Taylor in 1857 (against Aldersey's wishes). Another protegee, Mary Ann Leisk, became the wife of William Armstrong Russell, later bishop in north China. In 1861, Aldersey handed her school over to the Church Missionary Society and retired to Australia, where she lived until her death. She retired to McLaren Vale, South Australia in 1861 and built a house (Tsong Gyiaou) named after a former preaching station. The name is an anglicised form of 'San Ch'iao' (pronounced 'Song Jow'). It is now part of the Southern Districts War Memorial Hospital. References Bibliography *E. Aldersey White (1932) A Woman Pioneer in China.

Konrad von Jungingen granted the settlement town privileges in 1395. It lay on the bank of the Czarna river, hence its modern name. It was an important trade and military point due to the nearby Teutonic Order and Pomeranian frontier. In 1454 the town and region were incorporated to Poland by King Casimir IV Jagiellon. After the Thirteen Years' War, according to the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), it was recognized as part of Poland. Since then the town was part of the Pomeranian Voivodeship in the Polish province of Royal Prussia, and later also in the province of Greater Poland. Czarne was the seat of the starosts (local royal administrators), they resided in the local castle. In 1627, it was site of the Battle of Czarne, in which Poles under the command of Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski defeated the invading Swedes. After the First Partition of Poland in 1772 the town was annexed by Prussia. It became part of the newly established Province of West Prussia in 1773. Prussian authorities ordered the demolition of the Czarne castle. In 1885 the Prussian Army built a large training ground (√úbungsplatz) there. Old townhouses in the town center In World War I the German Army used it for a large prisoner-of-war camp for Russian prisoners. In World War II it was the site of the notorious Stalag II-B in which tens of thousands, mainly Soviet prisoners, died from disease, mistreatment and malnutrition. In 1945 the town was ceded to Poland according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement as part of the Recovered Territories. Germans remaining in the town were expelled and replaced with Poles.

She had graduated the year before from Los Angeles High School. She served for only four years but left a legacy for Los Angeles librarians to remember.  Early life  Foy was born in Los Angeles, California. Predecessors Women played a subsidiary role in Los Angeles Public Library affairs for many years. On the library's founding in 1872, women were excluded from even using it. ::However, this situation quickly changed. Within its first six months of operation, the board discussed allowing ‚Äúladys‚Äù limited membership, letting them use their male relatives‚Äô membership cards to gain access to the library‚Äôs collections.13In 1876 the library added a ‚ÄúLadies Room‚Äù to its complex. Although the new room did not contain books, it did house a number of popular magazines as well as comfortable sofas and chairs for local clubwomen to use.Debra Gold Hansen, Karen F. Gracy, and Sheri D. Irvin, \\"At the Pleasure of the Board: Women Librarians and the Los Angeles Public Library, 1880‚Äì1905\\", p. 314 John C. Littlefield, the editor of the Los Angeles Weekly Express, was appointed the city's first librarian in 1872. Littlefield was an asthmatic and would smoke jimsonweed in his office much to the dismay of patrons. He was succeeded in 1879 by an untrained partisan appointee, Patrick Connolly, who, it was suggested, was an alcoholic who missed more than his share of days at work and was discharged by the library board, which then vowed to name a \\"lady librarian.\\" At the Los Angeles Public Library Foy, the 18-year-old daughter of merchant Samuel Foy, asked the Foys' next-door neighbor, Mayor John Toberman, for the job and he advised her to canvass all of the City Council members, which she did. She then spent the summer of 1880 in the San Francisco Bay area, working with librarians in San Francisco and Oakland to learn her trade. She later wrote that her responsibilities on the job in the library at Main and Temple Streets in Los Angeles included: ::setting up a catalogue system, keeping the library accounts, acting as hostess in the Ladies Reading Room, serving as referee for ongoing chess games in the Newspaper Room, and settling bets made in the downstairs saloon on such questions as, \\"Who wrote Webster‚Äôs Dictionary: Noah or Daniel?\\" According to Sheri D. Irvin, in those days the appointment of women to Los Angeles city positions was often done for semi-charitable reasons such as a woman's need for financial support. When Mayor Toberman left office, a new library board was appointed and another woman appointed in Foy's place. Foy did not, however, leave quietly: She \\"published a valedictory in the newspaper where she criticized the [outgoing] board for its lack of involvement and interest in the library.\\" The woman appointed to replace Foy was the daughter of L.D. Gavitt, Jessie. The house where Mary Foy was born on July 13, 1862, and in which she lived is Los Angeles Historical Cultural Monument No. 8. As an educator and champion of women's rights Later she taught at Alameda School in Downey and the Eighth Street School in Los Angeles and by 1903 was teaching at Los Angeles High School. Newspaper columnist John Adams, writing in the Downey Eagle, said that Foy was a \\"strong-willed woman\\" who \\"campaigned for Woodrow Wilson during his national political career and fought for decades for the California Progressive Movement and Women‚Äôs Rights\\". She was listed in the 1913 yearbook of Los Angeles High School as a \\"prominent club woman and suffragist\\".  Personal life  On February 21, 1962, Foy died. She was 99.  Legacy  Foy was honored with the establishment of the Mary Foy California Room in the new public library building at Fifth and Olive Streets, though that room was not part of the redesign of the library building when it was reconstructed after two serious fires in 1986. Foy's tenure at the Los Angeles Central Library is chronicled in Susan Orlean's The Library Book.

Carpenter Edmund Carpenter began his anthropology studies under Dr. Frank G. Speck at the University of Pennsylvania in 1940. After completing his semester in early 1942, he volunteered to serve his country during World War II. World War II He joined the United States Marine Corps in early 1942, fighting in the Pacific Theater of Operations for the duration of the war especially in New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the Marianas, and Iwo Jima. After the war ended, he was assigned to oversee hundreds of Japanese prisoners, putting them to work on an archaeological dig in Tumon Bay, Guam.Cf. \\"Skeletons, Pottery, Tools Found on Sites of Ancient Villages\\" in THE NAVY NEWS, (United States Navy), February 10, 1946, page 5. Post war Discharged as a captain in 1946, he returned to the University of Pennsylvania using his G.I. Bill, was awarded a bachelor's degree, and earned his doctorate four years later in 1950. His doctoral dissertation was on the pre-history of the Northeast, entitled Intermediate Period Influences in the Northeast. Carpenter began teaching anthropology at the University of Toronto in 1948, taking side jobs such as radio programming for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). In 1950, he started fieldwork among the Aivilingmiut, returning to these Inuit in Nunavut in the famine winter of 1951‚Äì52, and again in 1955. When public television took off in Canada with the launching of CBC-TV in 1952, Carpenter began producing and hosting a series of shows. Moving back and forth between Toronto's broadcasting studios and Arctic hunting camps, Carpenter collaborated on the theoretical ideas in development by Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan. He and McLuhan co-taught a course, and together hatched core ideas about the agency of modern media in the process of culture change. In 1953, after a well-received proposal written by Carpenter, he and McLuhan received a Ford Foundation grant for an interdisciplinary media research project, which funded both the Seminar on Culture and Communication (1953‚Äì1959) and their co-edited periodical Explorations throughout the 1950s. Meanwhile, Carpenter continued his programs on CBC-TV, including a weekly show also titled \\"Explorations\\" (which started as a radio program). Together with Harold Innis, Eric A. Havelock, and Northrop Frye, McLuhan and Carpenter have been characterized as the Toronto School of communication theory. In his famous article \\"The New Languages\\" (1956), Carpenter offers a succinct analysis of modern media based on years of participant observation in different cultures, academic and popular print publishing, and radio and television broadcasting. Visual media In 1959, Carpenter joined anthropologist Raoul Naroll at San Fernando Valley State College (California State University-Northridge) and was appointed an assistant professor and founder of an experimental interdisciplinary program of Anthropology and Art, where students were trained in visual media, including filming.Naroll, Raoul (ed.) ‚ÄúNews of Institutions.‚Äù, Northridge, CA: Southwestern Anthropological Association Newsletter, v. 2, n.1, Spring 1959. P. 2‚Äì3.Valley State Sentinel, San Fernando Valley State College newspaper, March 17, 1960Profile of Edmund Carpenter, Association for Cultural Equity As the only faculty member in the new department, Carpenter went on to hire more faculty. In 1960, he was promoted to the rank of associate professor. In 1961, he was made chairman of the anthropology department.Cal State Northridge faculty affairs records for Edmund S. Carpenter, per Dr. Naomi Bishop With award-winning filmmaker Robert Cannon, he made an innovative documentary about \\"surrealist\\" Kuskokwim Eskimo masks. Carpenter also co-authored Georgia Sea Island Singers (1964), a film documenting six traditional African-American songs and dances by Gullahs of St. Simon Island, based on fieldwork by Alan Lomax. And with Bess Lomax Hawes, he collaborated on Buck Dancer (1965), a short film featuring Ed Young, an African-American musician-dancer from Mississippi. In 1967, however, just when visual anthropology began to take institutional form as an academic enterprise, the program was closed. During this period, Carpenter worked with McLuhan on the latter's book Understanding Media (1964). In 1967 McLuhan was awarded the Schweitzer Chair at Fordham University, and he brought Carpenter (on a sabbatical from Northridge), Harley Parker, and Eric McLuhan to be on his research team. On leave from his faculty position at Northridge, Carpenter subsequently held the Carnegie Chair in anthropology at the University of California, Santa Cruz (1968‚Äì69), and then took a research professorship at the University of Papua New Guinea, officially having resigned his position at Northridge. Joined by photographer Adelaide de Menil (who later became his wife), he journeyed to remote mountain areas where indigenous Papua had \\"no acquaintance\\" yet with writing, radios, or cameras. They took numerous Polaroid and 35mm photographs, made sound recordings, and shot some 400,000 feet of 16mm film in black and white, as well as color and infrared film. During the next dozen years, Carpenter taught at various universities, including Adelphi University (c. 1970‚Äì1980), Harvard, New School University, and New York University (c. 1980‚Äì1981). In addition to numerous other publications, he also completed art historian Carl Schuster's massive cross- cultural study on traditional art motifs, Materials for the Study of Social Symbolism in Ancient and Tribal Art: A Record of Tradition and Continuity, published privately in three volumes, with a much-abbreviated one-volume version published in 1996 by Abrams under the title Patterns That Connect. In 2008, Carpenter guest-curated an important Eskimo traditional and prehistoric art exhibit Upside Down: Les Arctiques at the Mus√©e du quai Branly, the ethnographic art museum in Paris, France. This exhibit was re-installed in 2011 as Upside Down: Arctic Realities at The Menil Collection, an art museum in Houston, Texas, which, since 1999, also houses his permanent exhibit Witnesses to a Surrealist Vision.  Personal life  On June 14, 1946, Edmund Carpenter married a fellow student at the University of Pennsylvania, Florence Ofelia Camara, and had two children with her, sons Stephen and Rhys. Their marriage united two of the earliest English and Spanish families to settle in the New World: the Camaras were a Spanish Conquistador family who settled in the Yucat√°n Peninsula of Mexico. They served under Francisco de Montejo, the Adelantado and Capitan General of Yucat√°n, and after that under his son, Francisco de Montejo (el Mozo), conqueror of the Yucat√°n.The Hispanic American Historical Review, Volume 1, James Alexander Robertson, Board of Editors of the Hispanic American Review, 1918. Cf.pp.57-58 They divorced in the mid-1950s. On September 6, 1961, in Yorkville, Michigan, Carpenter married Virginia York Wilson, of Toronto, the daughter of the well-known Canadian artist Ronald York Wilson. This marriage produced a third son, Ian Snow Carpenter. This marriage also ended in divorce. In the late 1960s, Carpenter met Adelaide de Menil, the daughter of Dominique de Menil and John de Menil of Houston, Texas. Adelaide was a professional photographer who had worked for the American Museum of Natural History, and who joined Carpenter in New Guinea when he took a professorship there in 1969. Their collaborations and subsequent marriage lasted until his death in 2011.Cf. Prins & Bishop (2001), p.124-125  Memorial Service 2011  A memorial service for Dr. Edmund Carpenter, attended by 400 people, was held on October 29, 2011, at the LeFrak Theater of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.

History In 1951, The Judge Advocate General of the Army established this court's predecessor, the U.S. Army Boards of Review, pursuant to Article 66, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1950. The UCMJ empowered the Boards to \\"weigh the evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses, and determine controverted questions of fact, recognizing that the trial court saw and heard the witnesses.\\" It also charged each board with affirm[ing] only such findings of guilty and the sentence or such part or amount of the sentence, as it finds correct in law and fact and determines, on the basis of the entire record, should be approved.\\" Finally, the UCMJ made the decisions of the Army Boards of Military Review binding on The Judge Advocate General and, by implication, binding on the Secretary of the Army and the President as well. The Military Justice Act of 1968 redesignated the Boards of Review as Courts of Military Review and provided each service court with a chief judge, appointed by The Judge Advocate General, and enabled the court to either sit en banc or in panels, empowering the chief judge to designate the senior, or presiding, judge for each panel. The All Writs Act empowers the court to issue extraordinary writs, such as habeas corpus, mandamus, and prohibition, in aid of its jurisdiction. The Military Justice Act of 1983 gave the court additional power to entertain interlocutory appeals by the Government from certain adverse trial rulings by the military judge. Congress also expanded the authority of The Judge Advocate General under UCMJ Article 69(a) to refer to the court records of trial other than those automatically reviewed by that Court under Article 66. In 1994, the U.S. Army Court of Military Review was renamed the U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals. This coincided with the renaming of the U.S. Court of Military Appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF). More recently, The Judge Advocate General, by regulation, granted tenure to the appellate judges serving on the Army court, as well as the trial judges. Operation Presently, the Army Court of Criminal Appeals is composed of three judicial panels, each with three appellate judges (one of which is the senior judge), a commissioner, and paralegal. The Chief Judge, while not assigned full-time to a single panel, sits on cases with judges from all three panels and has his own commissioner. The military justice system commonly uses four writs: mandamus, prohibition, error coram nobis, and habeas corpus. A writ of mandamus is an order from a court of competent jurisdiction that requires the performance of a specified act by an inferior court or authority.Black's Law Dictionary at 866 (5th ed. 1979). The writ of prohibition is used to prevent the commission of a specified act or issuance of a particular order.Black's Law Dictionary at 1091. The writ of error coram nobis is used to bring an issue before the court that previously decided the same issue. It allows the court to review error of fact or a retroactive change in the law that which affects the validity of the prior proceeding.Black's Law Dictionary at 487. The writ of habeas corpus is used to challenge either the legal basis for or the manner of confinement.Black's Law Dictionary at 638. The court has the statutory authority to determine whether the findings of guilty and the sentence are correct in law and fact for all courts-martial reviewed under Article 66, UCMJ (about 96% of the court's work), and to take corrective action if prejudicial error has occurred. Such action includes setting aside or modifying the findings and/or the sentence, ordering a rehearing, and dismissing charges and specifications. Unless reversed by a higher court, such action is binding on all parties, including all officials of the United States. The court's published opinions are binding precedent for the conduct of courts-martial in the Army. The Courts of Criminal Appeals review cases for legal error, factual sufficiency, and sentence appropriateness. All other cases are subject to review by judge advocates under regulations issued by each service. After such review, the Judge Advocate General may refer a case to the appropriate Court of Criminal Appeals. The Courts of Criminal Appeals also have jurisdiction under Article 62 of the UCMJ to consider appeals by the United States of certain judicial rulings during trial. Review under Article 62 is limited to issues involving alleged legal errors. Bluebook citation form for this Court is provided in Table T.1 (A. Ct. Crim. App.), The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation (Columbia law Review Ass'n et al. eds, 18th ed. 2005). The official reporters are West's Military Justice Reporter (M.J.) (1975‚Äìdate) and Court Martial Reports (C.M.R.) (1951‚Äì1975). Current Composition of the Court Presently, the U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals is composed of three judicial panels. Each panel includes three appellate judges (with one judge appointed as the senior judge of that panel) and a commissioner. The Chief Judge, while not assigned full-time to a single panel, sits on cases with judges from all three panels and is also assigned a chief commissioner. Gerald R. Krimbill is the chief judge.

The character set of the controller includes ASCII characters, Japanese Kana characters, and some symbols in two 28 character lines. Using an extension driver, the device can display up to 80 characters. The HD44780 is one of the most popular character LCDs ever made, with numerous third-party displays utilizing its 16-pin interface and instruction set for compatibility. Architecture Block diagram of an HD44780U-based LCD module Character LCD module on a solderless breadboard being controlled by an Arduino Uno The Hitachi HD44780 LCD controller is limited to monochrome text displays and is often used in copiers, fax machines, laser printers, industrial test equipment, networking equipment, such as routers and storage devices. Compatible LCD screens are manufactured in several standard configurations. Common sizes are one row of eight characters (8x1), and 16√ó2, 20√ó2 and 20√ó4 formats. Larger custom sizes are made with 32, 40 and 80 characters and with 1, 2, 4 or 8 lines. The most commonly manufactured larger configuration is 40x4 characters, which requires two individually addressable HD44780 controllers with expansion chips as a single HD44780 chip can only address up to 80 characters. Character LCDs may have a backlight, which may be LED, fluorescent, or electroluminescent. Character LCDs use a 16 contact interface, commonly using pins or card edge connections on 0.1 inch (2.54 mm) centers. Those without backlights may have only 14 pins, omitting the two pins powering the light. This interface was designed to be easily hooked up to the Intel MCS-51 XRAM interface, using only two address pins, which allowed displaying text on LCD using simple MOVX commands, offering cost effective option for adding text display to devices. The pinout is as follows: #Ground #VCC +3.3 to +5V (typical) #Contrast adjustment (VO) This is an analog input, typically connected to a potentiometer. The user must be able to control this voltage independent of all other adjustments, in order to optimise visibility of the display that varies i.a. with temperature, and, in some cases height above the sea level. With a wrong adjustment the display will seem to malfunction. #Register Select (RS). RS=0: Command, RS=1: Data #Read/Write (R/W). R/W=0: Write, R/W=1: Read (In most applications reading from the HD44780 makes no sense. In that case this pin can be permanently connected to ground and no io pins need to be allocated to steer it.) #Clock (Enable). Falling edge triggered #Bit 0 (Not used in 4-bit operation) #Bit 1 (Not used in 4-bit operation) #Bit 2 (Not used in 4-bit operation) #Bit 3 (Not used in 4-bit operation) #Bit 4 #Bit 5 #Bit 6 #Bit 7 #Backlight Anode (+) (If applicable) #Backlight Cathode (-) (If applicable) The nominal operating voltage for LED backlights is 5V at full brightness, with dimming at lower voltages dependent on the details such as LED color. Non-LED backlights often require higher voltages (I.E. electroluminescent).  Mode selection  thumb In 8-bit mode all transfers happen in one cycle of the enable pin with all 8 bits on the data bus and the RS and RW pins stable. In 4-bit mode, data are transferred as pairs of 4-bit \\"nibbles\\" on the upper data pins, D7-D4 with two enable pulses and the RS and RW pins stable. The four most significant bits (7-4) must be written first, followed by the four least significant bits (3-0). The high/low sequence must be completed each time or the controller will not properly receive further commands. Selecting 4-bit or 8-bit mode requires careful selection of commands. There are two primary considerations. First, with D3-D0 unconnected, these lines will always appear low (0b0000) to the HD44780. Second, the LCD may initially be in one of three states: * (State1) 8-bit mode * (State2) 4-bit mode, waiting for the first set of 4 bits * (State3) 4-bit mode, waiting for the second set of 4 bits State3 may occur, for example, if a prior control was aborted after sending only the first 4 bits of a command while the LCD was in 4-bit mode. The following algorithm ensures that the LCD is in the desired mode: The same command is sent three times, Function Set with 8 bit interface D7-D4 = 0b0011, the lower four bits are don't care, using single Enable pulses. If the controller is in 4 bit mode the lower four bits are ignored so they can't be sent until the interface is in a known size configuration. Starting in state 1 - 8 bit configuration Send Function Set command. Command will be executed, set 8 bit mode. Send Function Set command. Command will be executed, set 8 bit mode. Send Function Set command. Command will be executed, set 8 bit mode. Starting in state 2 - 4 bit configuration, waiting for first 4 bit transfer Send Function Set command. First four bits received. Send Function Set command. Last four bits, command accepted, set 8 bit mode. Send Function Set command. Command will be executed, set 8 bit mode. Starting in state 3 - 4 bit configuration, waiting for last 4 bit transfer Send Function Set command. Last four bits, unknown command executed. Send Function Set command. In 8 bit mode command will be executed, else first 4 bits. Send Function Set command. 8 bit command will be executed or last 4 bits of previous command, set 8 bit mode. In all three starting cases the bus interface is now in 8 bit mode, 1 line, 5x8 characters. If a different configuration 8 bit mode is desired an 8 bit bus Function Set command should be sent to set the full parameters. If 4 bit mode is desired 0b0010 should be sent on D7-D4 with a single enable pulse. Now the controller will be in 4 bit mode and a full 4 bit bus Function Set command sequence (two enables with command bits 7-4 and 3-0 on subsequent cycles) will complete the configuration of the Function Set register.

The DDRAM is 80 bytes (40 per row) addressed with a gap between the two rows. The first row is addresses 0 to 39 decimal or 0 to 27 hex. The second row is addresses 64 decimal to 103 decimal or 40 to 67 hex. The CGRAM is read/write memory used to encode up to 8 characters in the character generator. It consists of 64 fields at addresses 0 to 3F. Each field is 5 bits mapping to a row of pixels of each character. Each 8 fields in the CGRAM are used for each character. The lower 3 bits of the character codes from 0-7 and 8-15 select the groups of 8 fields in the CGRAM memory. Reading and writing to the DDRAM is done by setting the RS input high during bus transfers. The DDRAM must also be selected by using the Set DDRAM address command which selects the DDRAM for access and also sets the starting address for DDRAM access. Likewise reading and writing to the CGRAM is done by setting the RS input high during bus transfers. The CGRAM must also be selected by the Set CGRAM address command which selects the CGRAM for access and also sets the starting address for CGRAM access. The execution times listed in this table are based on an oscillator frequency of 270 kHz. The data sheet indicates that for a resistor of 91 kŒ© at 5V Vcc the oscillator can vary between 190 kHz and 350 kHz resulting in wait times of 52.6 us and 28.6 us instead of 37 us. If a display with the recommended 91 kŒ© resistor is powered from 3.3 volts the oscillator will run much slower. If the busy bit is not used and instructions are timed by the external circuitry, this should be taken into account. Font Amber backlight on a HD44780 display The original HD44780 character generator ROM contains 208 characters in a 5√ó8 dot matrix, and 32 characters in a 5√ó10 dot matrix. More recent compatible chips are available with higher resolution, matched to displays with more pixels. Two versions of the ROM have been developed: *HD44780UA00, the standard (Japanese) version, which includes katakana characters and some Greek letters and mathematical symbols *HD44780UA02, a European version, which includes the complete set of Greek, Cyrillic and Western European characters (with diacritics) The 7-bit ASCII subset for the Japanese version is non-standard: it supplies a Yen symbol where the backslash character is normally found, and left and right arrow symbols in place of tilde and the rubout character. A limited number of custom characters can be programmed into the device in the form of a bitmap using special commands. These characters have to be written to the device each time it is switched on, as they are stored in volatile memory.

He was the first qualifier ever to win the championship and remains one of the youngest champions in history. For his world championship win, Deller used 18-gram spring-loaded darts, later banned for tournament play but now legal again. Career BDO Deller's victory over Eric Bristow in the tournament by 6 sets to 5 was probably the biggest upset in the history of the championship. He also beat world number 3 John Lowe in the quarter finals and defending champion and world number 2 Jocky Wilson in the semi-final to become the only player in history to defeat the world's top three ranked players in the World Championship. The champion's prize money in 1983 was ¬£8,000. His checkout of 138 to clinch the trophy is amongst the most memorable in darting history. Bristow had left himself 50 to stay in the match, but decided to throw for single 18 to leave double 16 instead of a more difficult attempt at the bullseye. Deller then hit treble 20, treble 18, double 12 for the title, and even to this day commentators often refer to 138 as the \\"Deller checkout\\" if a player is left with that score. Despite a meteoric rise to World Champion, his career results failed to maintain that level. On the defence of his world title, he lost in the first round to Nicky Virachkul, and he only won three further matches in the BDO World Championship in subsequent years. He did win the British Professional Championship in 1987, but generally his world ranking continued to fall, and he even failed to qualify for the World Championship between 1989 and 1993. One of his more notable achievements in the years following his world title win is his 100.30 average in his quarter-final match against John Lowe in the 1985 World Championship; this made him the first-ever player to record a three-figure average in a BD0 world championship match. PDC Deller was one of the players who broke away from the British Darts Organisation in 1992 and joined the WDC, now the PDC. This saw him gain some more television exposure, and he did produce a few resurgent performances to reach the semi finals of the 1998 PDC World Championship and also the semi finals of the 1998 PDC World Matchplay. Deller dropped out of the top 32 of the PDC's World Rankings around 2005 and therefore has to attempt to qualify for their major tournaments ‚Äì which he failed to do for the 2006, 2007 and 2008 PDC World Championships. He now competes much less on the circuit, including around half-a-dozen UK Open Regional events during 2007, preferring to perform in more lucrative exhibition matches with fellow legend players such as the late Eric Bristow and Lowe. Records Deller's name has been in the record books on a couple of occasions. He held the Guinness World Record for the fastest 3 legs of 301 in 97 seconds. On 13 October 1984 he was on the wrong end of a piece of darting history when Lowe hit the first-ever televised nine-dart finish against him in the quarter-finals of the MFI World Matchplay. He became the first player in history to achieve a match average of 100 in the 1985 World Championship quarter-finals; he did, however, lose the game to Lowe. Deller set another World Record in darts as recently as 7 August 2012; Deller smashed the World Records set by Dean Gould of hitting the quickest 301 at 36 seconds, which Dean beat at Olympia Great British Beer Festival on the same day by making it 33 seconds. Deller beat that record on the same event by becoming the World Record holder by taking out 301 in 25 seconds by taking out a 130 checkout by hitting the bullseye. So Deller now has the World Record of the quickest 301 in 25 seconds. Spotter Deller has for many years been part of the Sky Sports broadcasting team acting as a \\"spotter\\" for the cameras. His knowledge of the players and scoring shots helps the director and cameramen anticipate where the next dart will be thrown.

He is considered one of the greatest exponents, if not the greatest, of the tradition of \\"praise-poetry\\", verse addressed to a noble patron.The Poetry of Guto'r Glyn , University of Wales Biography Valle Crucis Abbey. Guto spent his last years here, and it has been suggested that he was adopted by the abbey and educated there. Guto is associated with the Ceiriog Valley, in the modern Wrexham county borough of north-east Wales, and many of his patrons lived in the same region, although he visited houses across Wales in the course of his journeys.Guto'r Glyn, Dictionary of Welsh Biography His early life is obscure, but Glyn Ceiriog or Glyndyfrdwy have been suggested as his places of birth in the years between 1412 and 1420. It is also possible that y Glyn refers to Valle Crucis Abbey, and various suggestions and references within his poetry infer that he may have been a child adopted by and brought up at the abbey itself, explaining some of his later association with Cistercian institutions: he was certainly not from the noble or gentry class and may have come from a farming family.Rees, E. A life of Guto'r Glyn, Y Lolfa, 2008, pp.19-20 Guto is a diminutive of the Welsh name Gruffudd, and his father's name was Siancyn, so he was probably christened Gruffudd ap Siancyn using the patronymic system of the time. His poetic career seems to have blossomed relatively early and he was already a well-known poet by the early 1430s, while in 1441 he is known to have enlisted to fight in the Hundred Years War. From various of his poems we know that Guto was large and physically strong, recognised for his courage and sporting prowess, wore a beard and had black hair (though he rapidly went bald, leading him to jokingly compare himself to a tonsured monk wandering the countryside). Poets of the time commonly traded humorous insults, and the Hanmer poet Dafydd ap Edmund wrote that Guto was not good-looking and had a nose like a billhook, while another poet described him as having the alarming features of a bear. He was acknowledged as a master of praise poetry forms, an opinion echoed by the poet Tudur Aled, though he was also skilled at satire and like most bards of the period could exhibit a sharp humour on occasion. Work as a drover led to an incident in which he lost the parson of Corwen's sheep, instigating a poetic controversy with his rival Tudur Penllyn. While Guto chides Penllyn, who worked as a drover and wool-merchant, for not assisting him and vows never to set foot in the Marches again, Penllyn responds by describing a fantastical end for Guto's flock and suggests that Guto has in fact stolen the sheep to give to his wool-combing wife in Oswestry, in the process including digs at Guto's baldness.Rees, 2008, p.105 His finest and, to modern understanding, most powerful poems were written at the end of his long life and reflect on mortality, while he dismissed his earlier work as \\"babbling sweet nonsense continually\\" (\\"malu son melys ennyd\\"). As a soldier, Guto fought on the Yorkist side during the Wars of the Roses, and composed poems in praise of King Edward IV and prominent Yorkists such as William Herbert and Sir Roger Kynaston.

It was a society for people working in local government in highways departments in senior positions known as county surveyors. Over time most authorities stopped using the term 'county surveyor', but the society and the magazine who support them Surveyor magazine both opted to retain the title, although the society has since been subsumed (see reference to ADEPT below). The first meeting, and many other early meetings, were concerned with conditions of service of surveyors, mainly pay and hours of work. However, by 1890 the society had become increasingly involved with such matters as the rolling and watering of carriageways and repairs to footways. The Development and Road Improvement Funds Act 1909 created a Roads Board, which later became the Department for Transport with powers to give grants to highway authorities (local authorities) to construct and maintain roads. Many meetings of the society at that time were concerned with these grants, attempting to ensure an even spread of money around England and Wales. A Society of County Surveyors for Scotland was formed in 1931, although this was an extension of the earlier Association of Road Surveyors of Scotland founded in 1884, a year earlier than its English counterpart. In June 1937 it was agreed that they should join with their English and Welsh counterparts. In 1937 a society delegation visited Germany and subsequently set out proposals in 1938 for a national motorway network, having been impressed with the work carried out by the then Nazi Government. In 1955 with rationing that had hung over Great Britain since the end of World War II saw the end of the lean years of highway funding with the beginning of the motorway era, during which time the UK was transformed from a series of country lanes to having major ‚ÄòA‚Äô routes and motorways, eventually including the M25. Following the publication of the Buchanan Report in 1964, county surveyors became increasingly involved in transportation studies, traffic management and road safety, in addition to the existing work on road maintenance and new road construction. The 1970s saw the start of the greatest road building programme since the days of the Turnpikes and also a major change in the structure of local authorities. The Society played a significant part in these changes and was accepted as a principal channel for initiatives and advice. The 1974 reorganisation of local government added waste disposal to county surveyors' responsibilities. At the same time Surveyors of the Counties in Northern Ireland became part of the Department of the Environment, but in 1992 a Northern Ireland branch was formed which became part of the main society. Campaign for Safe Road Design In July 2008, now using the shorter name CSS, the society remained a partner in the Campaign for Safe Road Design which was calling on the UK government to make safe road design a national transport priority. Since then, CSS has been subsumed by ADEPT, the Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport.  ADEPT  CSS changed its name to the Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning & Transport (ADEPT) as a result of expansions in the responsibilities of the local government officers who were its members. The term 'county surveyor' had by then fallen from use.

Saint Catharine of Siena Parish was founded October 8, 1919, when Archbishop Dennis Cardinal Dougherty, Archdiocese of Philadelphia appointed the Reverend John C. Phelan as pastor of a new church in the west end of Allentown. By 1952, the parish campus had grown greatly, with additions of a school and convent and there was a need for a new church. On June 9, 1952, Msgr. Leo Fink broke ground on the new church. The Most Reverend Joseph M. McShea, Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia laid the cornerstone of the new structure on April 26, 1953. The building was designed in the Colonial Revival style. The exterior is faced with a variegated salmon brick trimmed with Salem limestone. At the crossing formed by the transept, there is a tall spire topped with a cross. The windows are colonial glazed antique glass. The Cathedral In 1961, the Diocese of Allentown was carved out from the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. The St. Catharine of Siena parish was honored to learn that their church was to be the seat of the new bishop The church would become the Cathedral Church of St. Catharine of Siena.

It provides an unsettling portrait of post-Civil War Madrid while caudillo Francisco Franco was in power. Plot Surcos follows the struggles of a Spanish family as it emigrates from the country to Madrid circa 1950. Facing difficulties in finding housing and employment, several family members turn to illegal or immoral activities in order to make ends meet, and the traditional family structure disintegrates. The movie begins when the Perez family of country bumpkins arrive from the country at the Madrid train station, disoriented, gawking and loaded down with baggage, including a basket of live chickens. The Perez family consists of a mother (who is never named in the movie), the fiftyish aged father, Manuel, his older son Pepe (who had visited Madrid during the Spanish Civil War), his younger son, Manolo and his slightly impish, but completely na√Øve daughter, Tonia. They move in with a relative of the mother in a run down apartment complex that is overrun with hordes of children who do cruel things every time they get a chance, showing that none of them are attending school at that point in Franco's Spain. In the apartment they meet the relative's daughter, the street smart Pili. Pili makes a living for her mother and herself by selling contraband American cigarettes in the street. Pili has an evil boyfriend, El Mellao. El Mellao works for the even more evil black marketer, but well dressed, very rich and smooth, Don Roque (‚ÄúEl Chamberlain‚Äù). Pepe quickly makes an implacable enemy of El Mellao when he defends Pili from his abuses and Don Roque hires Pepe in the place of El Mellao to drive around his contraband, because Pepe will do it for less. Pepe and Pili also become a couple and move in together. The father, Manuel tries selling candy in the street for his sister in law, but fails when the multitude of street children demand that he give it to them for free. Then a police officer takes away his entire supply because he is selling without a license. His sister in law is so enraged that she makes a very proud Manuel do kitchen work. Then, to Manuel's surprise, a note arrives that he has gotten a job in a foundry. However, when he attempts to work in the arduous conditions, he is quickly overcome by the noise and heat of the foundry and faints, losing the job almost immediately. His sister in law then again relegates him to humiliating kitchen work. Pepe's job for Don Roque is to work with a gang that steals sacks of potatoes from trucks that are climbing a hill and then deliver those potatoes to Don Roque to sell on the black market. Tonia also meets Don Roque through Pepe and Pili, who immediately has designs on her. First, he hires Tonia as a maid for his mistress. Tonia is very impressed by all the fine clothing that Don Roque's mistress has. When Don Roque hears Tonia sing while working, he tells her she has talent and offers to pay for singing lessons for her. With her mother's reluctant consent, Tonia accepts enthusiastically. He buys her a lot of attractive clothing, supposedly so she will be well dressed for her performance as a singer. However, when she actually gets the chance to sing on stage, some ruffians, hired by Don Roque, disrupt her performance and make her look foolish. Tonia runs off the stage in tears. Then, Don Roque comforts Tonia and takes her away in his limousine to deflower her and make her his mistress. Manuel is totally shocked by the whole thing and slaps his wife around for letting it happen. Then, Manuel shows up unexpectedly at the door of the love nest, slaps a shocked Tonia hard and cries bitterly while she goes to get her things so he can take her away. Pepe loses his job with Don Roque when he confronts him about deflowering his sister and demands that Don Roque marry her, which Don Roque laughs off with contempt. Pili still demands that he steal from trucks, but the rest of Don Roque's gang refuses to accompany him and El Mellao tips off the authorities that Pepe is about to try it without them. When Pepe hops into the back of the truck, they are waiting for him. They shoot him and he is further injured when he jumps off the truck. When he returns in the truck, badly injured, he finds El Mellao trying to drag away Pili as his prize. El Mellao then hits Pepe on the head with a large wrench and rushes off to chase a fleeing Pili. Don Roque arrives to find Pepe badly injured, but still alive. He takes him to a bridge and throws him onto railroad tracks as a train passes under the bridge. In the last scene of the movie, Manuel, his wife, Manolo and Tonia have returned to their village where Pepe is being buried. Manuel picks up a handful of soil from the grave and tells his family that they have to return to the country. His wife says people will laugh, but Manuel replies that, even with shame, they have to return to the land.

Background Surcos is considered one of the very few Spanish neo-realist films from the era when the style was being created and popularized in Italy. The picture only escaped censorship because Jos√© Mar√≠a Garc√≠a Escudero, Spain's Chief of Cinematography, appreciated the value of the film for its artistic merit.Brennan, Sandra. . The film dealt with issues virtually unseen in Francoist Spain, including rural immigration into the cities, poverty, prostitution, unemployment, and class conflicts. Surcos is a view of the contradictions found in Francoist Spain. The Catholic Church considered the film \\"deeply dangerous,\\" yet political observers labeled the drama of \\"national interest.\\" The film was not released until its controversial ending was removed.

The trustees of St. Mary's rushed to Hogan's defense and Conwell soon had a full- blown schism on his hands. He eventually excommunicated Hogan in 1821 and then, like many American bishops in the 1820s, wrested control of the parish from the lay trustees. Following his excommunication, Hogan managed a circus, studied law, and married twice, before reemerging in the 1840s as a leading voice of anti-Catholicism. He went on the lecture circuit, wrote belligerent essays in popular journals, and published in 1851 a book entitled, Popery as It Was and as It Is.

Stippled area marks the probable extent of the pagan reaction. The pagan reaction in Poland was a series of events in the Kingdom of Poland in the 1030s that culminated in a popular uprising or rebellion, or possibly a series of these, that destabilized the Kingdom of Poland. Background Dissatisfaction with the process of Christianization, which had started after the baptism of Poland in 966, was one of the factors that led to the uprising. The Roman Catholic Church in Poland sustained substantial losses, with many churches and monasteries destroyed, and priests killed. The spread of the new Christian religion had been coupled with growth of the territories and central power of the king. In addition to anti-Christian sentiments, the rebellion showed elements of a peasant uprising against landowners and feudalism. Also present was a struggle for power between the king and some of the nobility. Anita Prazmowska notes, \\"Historians have concluded that in effect two overlapping revolutions had taken place simultaneously: a political and a pagan revolution.\\" Rebellion While Frucht states that the uprising overthrew King Mieszko II of the Piast dynasty, others say it started after his death in 1034. Gerard Labuda, who provides an overview of Polish historiography of the period, gives 1032 as the date when the pagan reaction started, and he notes that historians give other dates for the start of another uprising or uprisings, referencing 1034, 1037, 1038 and 1039. In any case, Poland in the early 1030s was torn by a number of conflicts, and in 1031 Mieszko II had to briefly seek refuge in Bohemia after losing a civil war to his brother Bezprym, before returning to reclaim the Polish lands in 1032. The pagan reaction and related uprisings and rebellions of the time, coupled with foreign raids and invasions, threw the young Polish realm into chaos. Among the most devastating of the foreign contributions was a raid by Duke Bretislaus I of Bohemia in 1039, which pillaged Poland's first capital, Gniezno. The destabilization wrought by these events was so severe that historians doubt that anyone can be considered Poland's ruler in the late 1030s; the name of one of the pretenders, Boles≈Çaw the Forgotten, illustrates (\\"with a proper irony\\", writes Vlasto) the complexity and obscurity of the situation. Dvorn√≠k lists no ruler for Poland in 1034‚Äì40, pointing instead to a \\"dynastic struggle\\". Outcome According to some historians, the 1030s pagan uprising marks the end of the earliest period of Polish history, under the \\"First Piast Monarchy\\". Returning to Poland around 1040, Mieszko II's son reunited most of the Polish lands and became known as Casimir the Restorer. In the 1040s, he also fought a civil war against Miec≈Çaw (who created his own state), which some authors see as a continuation of the 1030s struggles.

Buying decisions in these markets are made differently than those in many consumer contexts, being based more on technical information and rational analysis and less on style, fashion, or impulse. Therefore, selling in these markets cannot depend on consumer-type sales methods alone, and instead it relies heavily on technical information and problem-solving to convince buyers that they should spend money on the seller's products or services, in order to meet a business need (that is, to satisfy a business case). A sales engineer is thus both \\"a salesperson that understands and can apply engineering\\" and \\"an engineer that understands how to sell engineered systems\\". They thus not only sell but also provide advice and support. They provide this service to various internal or external customers, and they may work for a manufacturer (servicing its industrial- account/business-to-business customers), for a distributor (which in turn services the industrial-account/business-to-business customers), or for a third party such as an engineering consultancy or a systems integrator. Sales Engineers are a critical sales team member in many companies and industries around the world. They are more than just technical experts in their respective industries. Highly successful sales engineers must build and maintain parallel expertise in \\"soft skill\\" disciplines such as business acumen, presentation skills, building customer relationships, developing an engagement strategy, and having a thorough understanding of the targeted industry. Many companies have difficulty finding people who possess these qualities, plus have extensive technical knowledge. The essence of the sales engineering role can be called by various names. Which name is most apt can even depend on which industry it is used in. Some common job titles that involve the essence of sales engineering include sales engineer, solutions engineer, solutions architect, systems engineer, customer engineer, pre-sales consultant, technical account manager, applications engineer or field applications engineer. The term systems engineering has various shades of meaning, however, as it is often more or less synonymous with industrial engineering; but in any market economy, industrial engineers will often end up providing some sales engineering as a necessary portion of their work. Service technicians in industrial fields may also find that their work challenges them to provide some sales engineering, to whatever extent they are capable of providing it, because they interface with customers having problems with equipment (or lacking the right equipment) and seeking solutions (anywhere from diagnosis and repair, to identifying entirely different systems that could be used instead).  External Functions   Sales and consultancy  The purpose of the job is to help potential customers understand, compare, and contrast the solutions that are available for purchase (the pre-sales role); to troubleshoot problems with their implementations‚Äîthat is, to help ensure that the solutions work successfully once a purchase is made (the post-sales role); and to maximize sales for the sales engineer's employer by providing help to customers (the aspect of the job that puts the \\"sales\\" in the title sales engineer). = Conflict-of-interest management and return-on-investment demonstration= It is understood in the market, by both the sales engineer and his or her wary industrial client, that the sales portion of the sales engineering role inherently involves a conflict of interest (COI), because it is always possible that the ideal solutions could involve recommending a competitor's products or services. However, the sales engineer is under pressure to steer the customer towards their employer's product. Thus, customers are generally wary of advice given by sales engineers. Nevertheless, sales engineers do usually provide real value to customers, which is why the role endures despite customers' apprehension. The customer's only motivation to participate in the encounter is to achieve return on investment (ROI) in one way or another. Toward that end, sales engineering increasingly relies on any information technology that can help quantify ROI. This is summed up in the aphorism that \\"at the end of the day, the customer just wants to know for sure that they will gain A dollars over the next B years (via reduced expenses or increased sales) if they pay C dollars up front for product D.\\"  Application development  Another function of the sales engineer is to introduce modified, improved, and/or advanced technology to potential users who may have an application but who have not yet acquired knowledge of the material or technique in question. The sales engineer may conduct training sessions or demonstrations to accomplish this. The task of seeking out industries, firms, or business models that do not yet use a certain product (for example, a CAx system or a CRM system) and causing them to adopt a new approach using that product is what puts the \\"applications\\" in \\"applications engineering\\" or \\"application development\\" (not to be confused with another common sense of that term, which refers to software development and programming). The task is to seek out and develop new applications for the product, in order to increase sales. The customer's only motivation for adopting it is \\"what it can do for me\\", such as same-output-lower-costs, more- output-same-cost, etc. Thus, when things work out correctly, both firms profit from the application development. This result also has broader economic implications, as it is a mechanism by which economic efficiency increases, productivity grows, and economic growth is encouraged. Inventors and R&D; people create new tools and processes; but they do not disseminate into the business world (to do any economic good) without some amount of applications development, teaching (from exposing decision-makers via trade shows to providing workers with training), and sales.  Teaching customers  Many products and services purchased by large companies and institutions are highly complex. Examples include airliners, weapons systems, and IT systems (such as telecommunications, or databases and their dependent applications for purposes such as logistics or customer relationship management). Sales engineers advise customers on how best to use the products or services provided. The sales process also may require some technical proof of concept or tech demo to be assured of the practicality of the solution. Sales engineers normally will ensure these efforts are successful.  Internal Functions   Proposal preparation  The sales of systems and solutions delivered by these companies are complex and usually require extensive documentation that describes what is being proposed and what the company commits to deliver. The sales engineer is in charge of preparing these documents, i.e. Technical Proposal or Scope of Work (SoW), which are usually subject to technical negotiation with the customer prior to the provider being able to submit a commercial proposal. In order to prepare the commercial proposal, once the scope of the proposed solution is finalized, the sales engineer is typically also in charge of gathering all the inputs from internal stakeholders (i.e. Product, R&D;, Delivery, Services, Finance, Legal, etc) so that Profit and Loss (P&L;) can be calculated, pricing can be established and final commercial proposal can be approved and submitted to the customer.  Tailoring of solutions  Sales engineers also collaborate with the design, production, engineering, or R&D; departments of their companies to determine how products and services could be made or modified to suit customers' needs. This aspect of sales engineering is important, because it is what allows the sales engineer to feel that they can maintain their personal integrity (ethically speaking) in the face of the inherent COI of the job (explained earlier). The sales engineer does not have to lie (ignore or negatively misrepresent the competitor's products or services) if they can reasonably tell the customer that their employer can tailor its solutions to the customer's particular requirements. Doing that may not be easy or cheap, which means that there is always a line to be walked to avoid overpromising-and/or-underdelivering.  Personnel considerations   Talents, skills, knowledge  The companies that employ sales engineers need to sell their products or services to generate income, but since engineers and scientists usually have substantially different personality traits than those required for sales work, there is a role for people with a combination of abilities. These individuals must have technical understanding of the complexities of what their company supplies together with sales skills. This combination of traits is not common.  Travel, communications, telepresence, compensation  Sales engineers may spend 20% to 70% of their time traveling, and they may work a flexible schedule due to the needs of the sales organization they support. Most sales engineers telecommute or spend a limited amount of time in the office. Skills with IT that help remote people communicate better, such as teleconferencing, videoconferencing, web conferencing, and telepresence (e.g., GoToMeeting, WebEx, Live Meeting, Fuze Meeting) are put to good use both on and off the road. Sales engineers, like their sales representative counterparts, are hired based on their geographic location rather than their proximity to the corporate, or even regional, office. Working in another part of the country, or even outside the country, where the corporate offices are, a sales engineer may only make it to corporate headquarters once or twice each year. A key differentiator between sales engineers and other roles within the organization is that a sales engineer is usually compensated by salary plus commission, as most sales representatives are. This commission is usually paid out when the sales representative is paid. Far less common is the case where a sales engineer is compensated with a base salary plus bonus. The bonus can be based upon the revenue generated within an assigned territory, set up as a Management By Objective (MBO) bonus, or a combination of the two.Mourer, D., 2008, Sales Engineer MBOs, thesalesengineer.com In both cases a sales engineer will make a base salary that is proportionally higher than their sales representative counterparts, and significantly more than the traditional engineers in an organization.  Sales engineering resources  Sales engineering is different from traditional sales roles. The systems and technology that a sales engineer sells are often complex and expensive. Traditional sales strategies including closing techniques, do not typically work and can even hurt a sale. As technology advances, so must the sales strategy of a sales engineer.  Consultative approach  Sales engineers and technical sales reps must perfectly understand the product or service they are selling; they should be able to explain in detail how it works, what business value it offers, and the results that customers will achieve. They also have to sell the idea of why customers need to make a change to move forward to the solution offered. Sales engineering uses a lot of discovery questions to uncover the challenges that customers have in their business or the outcomes they can‚Äôt drive.

Generation Joshua is a division of the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), which is a non-profit 501(c)3 organization, based in Purcellville, Virginia. Generation Joshua seeks to educate students on the history and founding of the United States through a conservative Christian perspective, while also providing hands-on opportunities for students to be involved in government and politics. To this end, the organization provides civics education classes, a book club program, and bi-weekly current events discussions. Generation Joshua also seeks to promote activism opportunities for members through local clubs, voter registration drives, and Student Action Teams, where student members campaign for political candidates. The organization also offers a college scholarship program, called the Ben Rush Awards Program, where students participate in civic involvement to earn money for college.\\"What is Generation Joshua?\\",Generationjoshua.org, http://www.generationjoshua.org/dnn/Default.aspx?tabid=244 2006.

Generation Joshua's name is taken from the Biblical character Joshua, who led the nation of Israel after Moses. Programs Generation Joshua runs five major programs: the Civics Education program, local Generation Joshua clubs, Student Action Teams, the Voter Registration Initiative, and the Benjamin Rush Awards Program. In addition to these, it offers four political simulation camps (called \\"iGovern\\" camps) during the summer. Generation Joshua has over 65 local clubs (as of 2008). At GenJ Club meetings, usually once a month, at least 10 times per year, members discuss current events with a Biblical perspective, listen to a special speaker, pray for the nation and its leaders, and organize local activism. The clubs are governed by Robert's Rules of Order and are led by a president and other officers. The clubs include homeschoolers as well as private and public school students.\\"East Tennessee teens mix politics with prayer.\\", NBC WBIR, http://www.wbir.com/life/programming/local/liveatfive/story.aspx?storyid=32295 28 February 2006. Generation Joshua's \\"Student Action Teams\\" buses students from across the country to campaign in local, state, federal elections for conservative candidates. These students, often too young to vote, are encouraged to go door to door and campaign for candidates who share their values. Generation Joshua students have influenced the outcomes of congressional elections in November 2016. Relation To HSLDA GenJ's national offices are at the Home School Legal Defense Association, which is also the campus of Patrick Henry College. Michael Smith, president of the group's parent organization, the Homeschool Legal Defense Association sees Generation Joshua as part of a larger movement. By training students (often homeschoolers) in the principles of conservative Christian political views and encouraging them to be active politically, Generation Joshua seeks to fundamentally influence the next generation's involvement in government. Many of these students go on to enter conservative colleges such as Patrick Henry College, (also founded by the HSLDA) where they will learn to \\"restore a moral framework and return America to its founding principles\\".

The Eleanor name is also used in the 2000 remake for a customized Shelby Mustang GT500. Eleanor - 1974 film Though four Mustangs are portrayed in the film as \\"Eleanor\\" targets, only two cars were used for filming the movie, with license plates and tires alternated as necessary. Of these two, one car was modified for the stunt driving necessitated by the final chase and wrecked in said process, while the other was kept intact for all external \\"beauty shots.\\" The latter car was also used for all but two interior shots. Prepping the two 1971 Mustangs for the film Both 1971 Mustang Sportsroofs used in the film (neither car has been proven to be a Mach 1, as often assumed) were bought in 1971, but - as it was three years before Halicki could raise sufficient funds to start filming - each car was facelifted with 1973 grilles for the film. Both cars retain their 1971 front bumper and valance panels, as retrofitting the 1973 parts to the car would have required swapping the fenders as well. As with the liberties taken with the body modifications, Halicki's paint scheme on both cars were similar - but not identical - to Ford factory offerings. Both cars received blackout treatment to the lower bodyside - resembling Mach 1's and base models equipped with the Exterior Decor Group - and a unique blackout treatment to the standard hood; not seen on any factory 1971-1973 Mustang. Additionally, neither car wears any identifiable badging spelling the \\"Mustang\\" name in type, though the pony badge and \\"Ford Motor Company\\" hubcaps are visible in the film. Despite rumors that both cars were painted in Ford's Medium Yellow Gold, Halicki - in a 1974 interview - stated that the cars were painted \\"generic school bus yellow\\" to save money. Stunt Eleanor The modified car required 250 hours of labor before it was ready for the film. All body panels were removed in order to install a roll cage throughout the Mustang's stock unibody. The transmission was also chained in for safety. An adjustable camera rig was mounted in the back seat to capture footage from the internal ‚Äúdriver's point of view.‚Äù The wrecked Eleanor was equipped with a base interior and no instrumentation package, but utilized seats from the Mustang's deluxe interior package; sourced from the beauty car. Conversely, the beauty car had deluxe interior, with the standard seats from the stunt car swapped into it. Other safety modifications included: *Heavy duty Simpson shoulder harness *Deadbolt door locks *Aftermarket hood pins *24-volt electrical system *On-board first-aid kit *Electrical kill switches *Individual locking rear brakes *Fish plating of the undercarriage - 3‚Äù x 3/8‚Äù steel The interior of the stunt car is seen only once in the film, when Halicki - as Maindrian Pace - places his hands against the windshield when cornered by the Long Beach police. The rollcage is clearly visible against the A-pillar. All other interior shots were executed with the \\"beauty\\" car, generally on alternate filming dates. =Additional history= The stunt car survives to this day, despite two serious incidents during filming: The first occurred during a stunt wherein \\"Eleanor\\" cuts across multiple lanes of freeway traffic. The stunt driver leading the \\"traffic\\" overshot his mark during the take, clipping the Mustang and causing it to careen into a nearby light pole. Halicki was rendered unconscious from the impact, but filming resumed the following week - utilizing this accident as part of the final film. Halicki's first words - upon regaining consciousness - were \\"Did we get coverage?\\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071571/trivia Following the incident with the light pole, Halicki compressed multiple vertebrae after performing the impressive 128-foot jump in the closing minutes of the film. The modified Mustang survived, despite the rough nose landing. Beauty Eleanor The second car was left absolutely stock - as noted by cinematographer Jack Vacek in the film's DVD commentary - and was not modified extensively other than the obligatory matching paint job, grille change, and seat swap with the stunt car. Though this car was not damaged during filming, Halicki stated (in 1974, at the film's premiere) that the car was crushed.

Halicki's widow, licensed the rights of the 1974 film to Disney for a remake of the same name. The new 2000 Gone in 60 Seconds film, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, features Nicolas Cage as master auto thief Randall \\"Memphis\\" Raines. Both films share plot similarities about a crew of thieves who steal a large order of cars (48 in the original, 50 in the 2000 film) and deliver them to the Long Beach docks. Once again, the \\"Eleanor\\" name is given to the film's featured car; now a Dupont Pepper Grey 1967 Ford Mustang fastback, depicted as a Shelby GT500, with a customized body kit designed by Steve Stanford. Screen-used vehicles Depending on the source, either eleven or twelve cars were built by Cinema Vehicle Services for the film (not including CVS's creation of one additional Eleanor clone - with a Ford 428 - for producer Bruckheimer). Nine were shells, and three were built as fully functional vehicles. Seven were reported to have \\"survived the filming [and] made it back to Cinema Vehicle Services\\" according to research by Mustangandfords.com. Of the surviving vehicles, three cars have been offered to the public with claims of originality and screen-use in the film, as follows: {  left; width:100%;\\" - !Cinema Vehicle Services numberVINSales history - ?7R02S211287Sold at Barrett-Jackson's 2009 Scottsdale, AZ auction for $216,700. - 77R02C173895Sold at COYS Autosport International January 2012 auction (Birmingham, UK) for ¬£95,000.

Whether the two wrecked cars were rebuilt - or whether surviving shells were built up into functional cars - remains unknown and unpublicized. A fourth car, VIN #7F02C229830, last offered for sale in Dubai, also claims originality to the film. This car has not been authenticated.http://67mustangblog.com/2013/01/original-eleanor-movie-car-on- sale-in-dubai/ Reproductions Between 2007 and 2009, Classic Recreations manufactured reproductions of the 2000 film's Eleanor Mustang under license by Halicki Films/Eleanor Licensing. After two years Classic Recreations terminated the licensing agreement. Classic Recreations produced two models of the Eleanor Mustang (535 model, 750 model). Denice Halicki currently owns the copyrights to the ‚ÄúEleanor‚Äù body style and has filed lawsuits preventing unlicensed ‚ÄúEleanor‚Äù look-a-likes or copies of the 1967 Ford Mustang fastback. These lawsuits have sparked controversy among many in the car community. The license for Eleanor reproductions is currently held by Fusion Motor Company of Chatsworth, California.

It consisted of parts of the present day Guntur and Prakasam districts. According to historian and geographer K. Iswara Dutt, Kammanadu consisted of the Narasaraopet, Sattenapalle, Bapatla and Ongole taluks, including the villages of the Addanki area. It was bounded by Srisailam in the west, Palnadu and Velanadu in the north, the Gundlakamma river in the south and the Bay of Bengal in the east. The erstwhile Vinukonda taluk and the Chirala taluk are also often included, which are anyway indicated by the boundary at the Gundlakamma river.  Etymology  According to one theory, Kammanadu derived its name from the Gundlakamma river, which is a prominent river between the Krishna and Penna rivers in coastal Andhra.: \\"Kammanadu: This region should have acquired its name from the river Gundlakamma. The Kammanadu the area around Narasaraopet taluq of Guntur district of the east of Srikakulam in Krishna district...\\" \\"Kamma\\" in this context means a stream or river.: \\"Here, Kamma indicates a stream. Cf: Gundlakamma: Prakasam District; Perakamma: a big Kamma, River Krishna\\" According to another theory, Kammanadu was the region between Gundlakamma and Pƒìrakamma (the \\"big river\\", perhaps the Krishna river).: \\"Kammanadu: the region between the rivers Gundlakamma and Perakamma rivers in Guntur and Prakasam districts of Andhra Pradesh\\" However, the Tenali and Repalle taluks of the Guntur district, closer to the Krishna river, are referred to as Velanadu. They are not generally regarded as part of Kammanadu. The modern town of Guntur is likely to have been at the edge of Kammanadu.  History  Between the seventh and thirteenth centuries AD, Kammanadu was ruled by a branch of the Telugu Cholas with their capital at Konidena (which is now a small village).  Ethnicity  The people that emigrated from Kammanadu were referred to as belonging to a kammakula (kamma community) . Prominent among them were the general Vennaya-bhatta of the Chalukya emperor Vikramaditya V (r. 1008‚Äì1015), and generals Sarvadeva and Chamundaraya of Vikramaditya VI (r. 1076‚Äì1126). Terms such as kamma-brahmana, kamma-komati, kamma-sreshti and kamma-kapu are also attested in inscriptions as descriptions of people. The famous poet Pampa (902‚Äì941), the author of Pampa Bharata in Kannada, was referred to as a kamma-brahmana. The prominent Kamma community of present day is believed to be derived from the kamma-kapus, i.e., Kapus (agricultural families) of Kammanadu. Inscriptions Various historic inscriptions referring to the region have been found. A reference to Karmarashtram appears in the inscriptions of the Ikshvaku king Madhariputra Purushadatta (3rd century A.D) found at Bethavolu (Jaggayyapeta).Burgess, J. 1886, Buddhist Stupas of Amaravathi and Jaggayyapeta, Madras Presidency, Archaeological Survey of India, p. 110. Later ones include the inscription of the Pallava king Kumara Vishnu II, son of Buddha Varma found in the village of Chendaluru, and one of the Eastern Chalukya king Mangi Yuvaraja (627-696 AD) written in Sanskrit. In the inscriptions ascribed to period from the 3rd to the 11th century AD, the words Kammarashtram, Kammaratham, Kammakaratham, Karmarashtram, Karmakaratham, Karmakarashtram and Kammakarashtram were used interchangeably. The subsequent inscriptions of Telugu Chodas and Kakatiyas mentioned Kammanadu; for example, the Konidena inscription of Tribhuvana Malla from 1146. Some of the important inscriptions relating to Kammanadu are: * Epigraphica Indica, Vol VIII, pp. 233‚Äì236 (Chandaluru copper plate inscription of Kumara Vishnu) * Epigraphica Indica, Vol XV, pp. 249‚Äì252 (Ongole copper plate inscription of Pallava king Vijaya Skandavarma) * Epigraphica Indica, Vol XXIV, pp. 137‚Äì143 (Chura inscription of Vishnugopa) * Epigraphica Indica, Vol XVIII, p. 250 (Kopparapu copper plate inscription of Pulakesi II, 7th century CE) * Epigraphica Indica, Vol XVIII, p. 27 (Aluru inscription of Chalukya king Vikramaditya V, 1011 CE). * South Indian Inscriptions, Volume 6, Inscriptions 124, 128, 129, 132, 139, 147, and 179.

Roma.Interview with Jyllands-posten.dk He played 46 matches and scored five goals for the Danish national team, and he represented his country at the 1986 World Cup and two European Championship tournaments. Career Born in Virum, Berggreen started playing football at local club Lyngby Boldklub at the age of six. He made his senior debut in 1975, in a Lyngby team which struggled to establish itself in the Danish 2nd Division. Berggreen was Lyngby's top goalscorer for several seasons, and scored 15 goals when the club won promotion to the Danish 1st Division in 1979. He made his international debut for Denmark in August 1979, in the first game of the newly appointed national manager Sepp Piontek. He played one more game for his country, before his international career went on a hiatus. In 1982, he moved abroad to play for newly promoted club SC Pisa in the Italian Serie A. Berggreen helped the club stay in Serie A, and was recalled to the Danish national team in October 1982. In the 1983‚Äì84 Serie A season, Pisa were relegated to Serie B, but Berggreen chose to stay with the club. He was selected to compete for the Danish national team at the 1984 European Championship, where he played four matches, and scored a goal in the 5‚Äì0 victory against Yugoslavia. In the semi-final against Spain, Berggreen was sent off in injury time, and Denmark were later eliminated following penalty shootout. The following season, he helped Pisa win the 1984‚Äì85 Serie B title, and obtain promotion to Serie A once again. Pisa were relegated once more at the end of the 1985‚Äì86 Serie A season. With the Danish national team, Berggreen played an important part in Denmark's first ever qualification for a World Cup tournament. In the penultimate match of the qualification stage in October 1985, Denmark were trailing against Norway by 0‚Äì1 at half-time. Ten minutes after the break, Berggreen snapped the ball from a Norwegian defender, and made the assist for Michael Laudrup to tie the game. Berggreen himself went on to score two goals, as Denmark eventually won 5‚Äì1. He was included in the Danish squad for the 1986 World Cup, and played three games, before Denmark were once again eliminated by Spain. After the World Cup, Berggreen opted to stay in the Serie A, and signed with vice- champions A.S. Roma. He played a single season at Roma, which ended in a seventh place finish in Serie A. He then moved on to league rivals 1988 European Championship in June 1988, where he played two games as a substitute. Berggreen ended his national career after the tournament, having played 46 matches and scored five goals since his international debut in 1979. Berggreen moved back to Denmark, where he ended his career with Lyngby, in a combined role as both active player and Lyngby sports director. He ended his active career in March 1990, at the age of 32 years, after more than 200 games for Lyngby. Lyngby struggled financially, and Berggreen left his job as a sports director in November 1992. He went on to concentrate on his clothing company.

Nebres is a Filipino scientist, mathematician, and Jesuit who was the longest-serving university president of the Ateneo de Manila University. He succeeded Joaquin G. Bernas in 1993, and served as University President until 1 June 2011. He currently sits as a member of the board of trustees of Georgetown University, Regis University, the Asian Institute of Management (where he sits as Vice-Chair), and other colleges and universities in the Philippines. He is also a member of the board of directors of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, and is currently chairman of the Synergeia Foundation. He was also Provincial Superior of the Society of Jesus in the Philippines. Nebres served as the Ateneo's university president for more than 18 years. His term was extended for him to lead the Ateneo through the completion of key initiatives as well as its sesquicentennial celebration, and was again extended until June 1, 2011, after which he was succeeded by Jose Ramon Villarin as the Ateneo's university president. Since his return to the Philippines in 1970 after graduate studies abroad, Nebres has worked on three major areas: teaching and development of mathematics and science in the Philippines and in Southeast Asia; administration in the university and in the Jesuit Order; and leadership in the socio-political concerns of the Philippines during the years of martial law and in the early years of democratic restoration. In the 1990s, he also became more involved in the business world, particularly in the relationships between universities and business and technology. In 2011, he was named National Scientist of the Philippines upon the recommendation of the National Academy of Science & Technology. Early life and education Bienvenido Nebres was born in Baguio on March 15, 1940 and grew up in Bacnotan in La Union, Philippines. He studied at the Bacnotan Elementary School, and then moved to Christ the King College in San Fernando, La Union. His vocation to the priesthood came early, and soon enough he found himself at the Vigan seminary in Ilocos Sur. He wanted to become a priest because of a teacher who was a nun, her stories made him realize that it was a life worth living. He finished high school at the San Jose Seminary, and then moved to the Sacred Heart Novitiate in Novaliches. He did his early studies in classical studies and philosophy, completing his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1962 and his Master of Arts degree in 1963, both in Philosophy, at the Jesuit Scholasticate, Berchmans College in Cebu City, Philippines. He attended Stanford University in California 1965-70, wherein he completed his Master of Science and Ph.D. in mathematics. He completed his dissertation \\"Preservation Theorems and Herbrand Theorems for Infinitary Languages\\" in 1970 under the supervision of Solomon Feferman. Teaching, development of mathematics and science in Southeast Asia Nebres was founding President of the Mathematical Society of the Philippines in 1972. He was one of the founding officers of the Southeast Asian Mathematical Society (SEAMS) also in 1972. The SEAMS has continued activities among the Southeast Asian nations by supporting graduate programs, research, and mathematics education. Nebres was President of the SEAMS 1977-78 during its period of consolidating its network. Nebres was also one of the founders of the consortium of the leading universities in Manila to develop Ph.D. programs in mathematics, physics and chemistry. The consortium has succeeded in developing a critical mass of scientists in these areas, has developed extensive links with scientists abroad (particularly in Australia and Japan), and is now the core of a large network of schools in the Philippines (more than 110 high schools as well as over 30 colleges and universities) which are supported by the Philippines‚Äô Department of Science and Technology as the leadership group for improving science and engineering education in the country. From 1992 to 1998, Nebres was Chairman of the Project Advisory Group for a World Bank- and OECF- financed Engineering and Science Education Project of the Philippine Department of Science and Technology. From 1994 to 1998, he directed a team for the Philippine Department of Education on the development of education plans to strengthen elementary and secondary education in the poorest provinces of the country. He has served as Chair of the Technical Panel on Science and Mathematics of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) since its inception and also chairs the CHED Technical Working Group for faculty development. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2013-02-24. As a Jesuit Nebres was dean of the School of Arts and Sciences of the Ateneo de Manila 1973 to 1980. He was also Rector of the Loyola House of Studies from 1980 to 1982. From 1983 to 1989, he served as Provincial Superior of the Jesuits in the Philippines. Nebres was also President of Xavier University - Ateneo de Cagayan in Mindanao 1990 to 1993. He was President of the Ateneo de Manila University, and was its longest-serving university president. His main concerns apart from the normal duties of a university president are the strengthening of basic education and of science and technology in the Philippines. He currently leads the Ateneo through several key initiatives, such as: basic education development through the Ateneo Center for Educational Development (ACED) and the Ateneo Center for English Language Teaching (ACELT), among other Ateneo initiatives; public health development through the Ateneo's Leaders for Health Program as well as the establishment of the Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health; housing and social development through leadership in initiatives such as Gawad Kalinga and Kalinga Luzon, where he is one of the key leaders; and leadership and good governance. On July 28, 2008, Nebres celebrated his 52nd year as a Jesuit. Society and politics Nebres also worked to establish the Center for Community Services and the first conscientization and politicalization programs of the Ateneo de Manila in the 1970s. The students from these programs have become major contributors to social development in the Philippines. He also helped in the political programs of various parties and groups during the years of forming alternatives to the Ferdinand Marcos martial law regime. As Provincial Superior of the Jesuits in the Philippines from 1983 to 1989, much of his work was to support and coordinate efforts on the part of the Church in the years prior to and immediately after the People Power Revolution in 1986. In 2006, Nebres merged the Center for Community Services with the Ateneo School of Government. Chair, Presidential Task Force on Education On September 4, 2007, the Presidential Task Force on Education under the Office of the President named Nebres, chairman. Nebres will be joined by 4 others‚ÄîAngeles University Foundation President Emmanuel Angeles, Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Donald Dy, Asian Institute of Management Professor Victor Limlingan, and former University of the Philippines president Jos√© Abueva. The 5 with Education Secretary Jesli Lapus, Romulo Neri, and Augusto Syjuco, complete the task force. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed Executive Order 635 on August 24 creating a presidential task force to assess, plan and monitor the entire educational system. Frontline Leadership On December 5, 2007, Nebres launched \\"Frontline Leadership,\\" a book project of the Ateneo School of Government (sponsored by German foundation Konrad Adenauer Stiftung) was written by several authors. He stated: \\"I look forward to the future when the next President of the Philippines does not come from the Senate but from [the ranks of] mayors or governors; I do hope that a next generation of leaders will emerge and see local leadership as the wave of the future.\\" The book narrates the performances of 4 former local officials, an unnamed female governor in the Visayas and one incumbent: Naga Mayor and Ramon Magsaysay awardee Jesse Robredo, former San Fernando, La Union Mayor Mary Jane Ortega, former Bulacan Gov. Josie de la Cruz, and former Surigao del Norte Gov. Robert Lyndon Barbers. In business Nebres sits on the boards of several companies as an independent director, most notably that of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT), where he has been a member from 1998 to 2012. His resignation on September 25, 2012 came in the wake of PLDT Chairman Manny Pangilinan's \\"disengagement\\" from the Ateneo due to \\"irreconcilable\\" differences of positions taken on controversial issues, particularly the Reproductive Health Bill in which the Catholic Church is against, and mining. Recognition * In 1981, Nebres was conferred the Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques for his contributions to the Philippine-French exchange especially in the field of mathematics by the French Republic. * In 1992, he received an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of the Philippines for his work in promoting science and technology in the country. He was conferred an Honorary Doctor of Science degree by De La Salle University for his work in science and science education in 2004. * In 1999, Nebres was inducted into the Alumni Hall of Fame of the Asian Activities Center of Stanford University ‚Äúfor his distinguished accomplishments and outstanding contributions to our community and society.‚Äù * In 2001, Nebres was accorded the rank of Officer in the National Order of Merit of the French Republic (Officier de L'Ordre National du M√©rite). The decoration recognises his valuable \\"contribution to the development of scientific knowledge and education in the Philippines as well as his dedication to the promotion of relations between French and Philippine universities.\\" The award was conferred by decree of the President of the French Republic upon the recommendation of the French Foreign Minister. Report, Hong Kong Baptist University, Fall 2001. Nebres is also an honorary member of Phi Kappa Phi. The Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) on June 15, 2008, stated that \\"Ateneo de Manila University president Bienvenido Nebres will be formally honored as among the DOST's \\"50 Men and Women of Science\\" July to September; the DOST Citation for Nebres described him as an \\"education icon,\\" having reconciled the fields of science and religion with his work.\\" References Sources * Biography of the President, ateneo.edu, accessed 7 September 2006. * Mass of Thanksgiving Homily: Fr.

He was a judge and state senator in Ohio before serving sixteen years as Chief Justice of the Montana Territorial Supreme Court. As a member of the post-statehood Code Commission, he was one of the main drafters of the Montana Code and the most vocal advocate in the state for codification. Early life and career in Ohio Wade was born in Ashtabula, Ohio, where he spent the early years of his life. He studied law in the office of his uncle Benjamin F. Wade, who was a U.S. Senator from 1851 to 1869. Wade was also the brother-in-law of Vice President Schuyler Colfax, who married Wade‚Äôs sister, and became friends with future President James Garfield. Wade was admitted to the bar in 1857, and in 1860 he was elected probate judge of Ashtabula County, a position he held for seven years. Wade married Bernice Galpin on June 3, 1863. In 1867, he was elected to a term in the Ohio Senate. On the Montana Territorial Supreme Court Though he had no previous experience in the west, Wade was appointed the third Chief Justice of the Montana Territorial Supreme Court by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 14, 1871, and confirmed by the United States Senate on March 17. His sixteen-year tenure on that court was the longest served by any member. He was appointed to three more terms, serving on the court until 1887, when N. W. McConnell was appointed as his successor by President Cleveland. Wade authored roughly thirty percent of the court‚Äôs output during its 25-year history, writing 192 majority opinions, along with fourteen concurrences and dissents. His opinions often did not cite precedents, but instead simply explained a rule based on an applicable statute or simply through elaborated reasoning. Territorial Supreme Court justices also served as trial judges until 1886, and in this capacity Wade sentenced a reported 500 men to prison and sent twelve to the gallows. An anecdote relates how Wade, trying to rid Friday of its nickname of the \\"hangman‚Äôs day,\\" sentenced a murderer to be hanged on a Thursday instead. He explained, \\"I could not see but the fellow enjoyed it just as well as though Friday had been the day appointed, and I thought that poor abused Friday looked a little brighter the next morning.\\" While on the court, Wade authored a law-themed novel, Clare Lincoln, which was published in 1876 and achieved some popularity in the territory. In 1879, he wrote an article titled Self Government in the Territories, Int‚Äôl Rev. 229 (1879), in which he said that the territorial court's structure \\"made official life in the Territories\\" into \\"a personal warfare, which is neither pleasant to the officer nor beneficial to the people.\\" Montana codification and later life After leaving the court, Wade entered private practice in Helena as a partner in a law firm. Montana became a state on November 8, 1889, and from 1889 until 1895, Wade served as one of three Code Commissioners who were tasked with the codification of Montana law. The Commission produced four legal codes--Civil, Political, Procedure and Penal--to replace the volumes of session laws. These were reported to the Montana Legislature in 1892, though no action was taken at first due to political reasons as well as concerns of uncertainty and inconsistency inherent in codes. Wade, at that time one of the most prominent lawyers in the state, is considered to have been the most important advocate for codification. On April 5, 1894, he gave an address to the Helena Bar Association arguing for the adoption of the four codes. His speech was subsequently published as a pamphlet, Necessity for Codification. The Legislature adopted the codes the following year. In addition to his private practice and support of codification, Wade continued to write. He contributed the chapters on law and the courts for An Illustrated History of the State of Montana by Joaquin Miller, a popular history of Montana published in 1894; Wade‚Äôs section was titled \\"The Bench and Bar 1880-1884.\\" In 1895, Wade gave an address to the Montana Bar Association that was subsequently published as The Common Law. Wade eventually returned to Ashtabula in Ohio, where he spent his last years. References *Andrew P. Morriss, Legal Argument in the Opinions of Montana Territorial Chief Justice Decius S. Wade, 1 Nev.

About 33 species are known in one family (Diaphanocephalidae), two genera (Diaphanocephalus and Kalicephalus) and six subgenera. Snakes can be orally infected with third-stage larvae experimentally, but it is a mystery how snakes become infected in the wild. Since snakes flick their tongue around to examine their environment, it is possible that the nematodes attach to the tongue. Kalicephalus species lack host specificity, and are intolerant of each other - different species space themselves apart in the host's gut. Ancylostomatoidea The hookworms, these have very large buccal cavities. They infect the small intestine of mammals. Many hookworms can infect the host by skin penetration, an important discovery made by A. Looss when he accidentally spilt larvae in water on his hand in 1898. The larvae release enzymes to assist their passage through the skin. There are three species that infect humans. Fourth-stage and adult hookworms suck blood, which can cause anaemia in humans with malnutrition. The third-stage larvae are carried by general circulation to the heart and lungs. In the lungs, they enter alveoli and begin to develop to the fourth stage. Then they migrate to the trachea and intestine. They attach to the wall of the intestine, reaching the adult stage in two to seven weeks, depending on the species. If the infective third stage is ingested orally, the worm can still, nevertheless, attach to the gut wall and develop to the adult stage. In a resistant host, the third stage larva can invade tissue and persist, eventually infecting offspring in females either in milk or prenatally. This phenomenon, well-studied in trichostrongyles of herbivores and known as arrest, occurs in several hookworm species such as Ancylostoma caninum in canids, Uncinaria lucasi in fur seals and Ancylostoma duodenale in humans. Strongyloidea These have large buccal capsules and leaf-like structures known as corona radiata. Most of them infect the large intestine by oral ingestion of the larva. The superfamily consists of the Strongylidae (including the strongyles of equines), Chabertiidae (including the nodular worms), Syngamidae (including the gapeworms of birds) and Deletrocephalidae (of Rhea americana). The gapeworms (Syngaminae) develop to the third larval stage inside the egg. Some strongyles, including the gapeworms, use earthworms and gastropods as paratenic hosts. The final hosts of strongyles are generally herbivores, such as horses, ruminants, ratite birds and Australian marsupials.Anderson p.61 Trichostrongyloidea Egg of Trichostrongylus sp. Trichostrongyloidea are divided into 14 families and 24 subfamilies. These worms have very small mouths and are found in a large number of hosts. They generally infect the stomach or intestine. Species that infect herbivorous hosts climb onto vegetation via films of moisture. Some species such as those infecting rodents can use either the oral or percutaneous route. There are unusual features in the development and transmission of some Trichostrongyloidea species. For example, Ollulanus tricuspis, which infects the stomach of pigs, is autoinfective: the sole means of transmission is through the pig vomiting. Arrested development is a well- studied feature, which may occur in temperate zones when the weather is too cold, or when it is too dry. This is known as seasonal arrest. In ewes, they wait for parturition and lactation, when there will be a population of young animals with little or no immunity; the sudden production of eggs by newly matured worms is known as spring rise. Another factor involved in stimulating arrest is overpopulation of adult worms.Anderson pp.81-83 Metastrongyloidea All of these parasites go through a snail to infect the lungs or vascular system of mammals, like artiodactyls, carnivores, marsupials, and cetacea.

Wins over Lanquaye Wilson on 22 May (third-round TKO) and Ruddy Encarnacion on 18 July (eighth-round TKO) served as a prelude to what would be one of Mitchell's most acclaimed performances to date, against Breidis Prescott on 5 December. Prescott, notorious for his punching power and shocking knockout of Amir Khan in 2008, had virtually no answer for Mitchell's skilful use of range, movement and accurate punches.

On the line was the WBO interim title, held by hard-hitting slugger Michael Katsidis, as well as a chance to fight for a full world title later in the year. At the opening bell, Mitchell looked to establish his jab and keep Katsidis at bay. In the first two evenly split rounds, the occasional flurry of hooks from a highly aggressive Katsidis was enough to make Mitchell fight consistently on the back foot in an attempt to keep out of range. However, in the closing seconds of both rounds, Katsidis was able to launch a charging attack and finish strongly at the bell. In the third round, Katsidis continued to charge at Mitchell and was soon able to land a combination of hooks which made Mitchell stumble backwards on unsteady legs. From thereon, Mitchell was unable to fully regain his composure and, less than two minutes later, he was buckled by a hard left hook and a further succession of unanswered punches, at which point the referee stopped the fight.

On 31 May 2014, an unexpectedly stiff test came in the form of Ghislain Maduma, on the undercard to the rematch between Carl Froch and George Groves at Wembley Stadium. On the day of the fight, Mitchell failed to make the IBF-mandated same-day weigh-in by , a mistake which Mitchell put down to having eaten steak the night before. Since the fight was an eliminator to face then-reigning IBF lightweight champion Miguel V√°zquez, Mitchell had forfeited his chance at fighting for the title even if he won. In the fight against Maduma, Mitchell gave up an early lead on points and absorbed many clean punches from his highly aggressive opponent.

In what was described as a career-best performance, Mitchell showcased his boxing skills with renewed motivation en route to stopping Estrada in eight rounds.\\"Kevin Mitchell stops Daniel Estrada in eight rounds to set up a world title shot\\". Sky Sports. Sky. 1 February 2015. Retrieved 14 January 2016. This set up a second world title opportunity for Mitchell, this time against WBC lightweight champion Jorge Linares. Their fight took place on 30 May and got off to a cagey start, with neither fighter winning any rounds convincingly. In round five, Mitchell scored a hard knockdown, allowing him to build up a lead on the scorecards and box with increasing confidence. However, Linares scored a knockdown of his own in round ten, which quickly signalled the end of the fight as Mitchell's eye had been badly cut from a punch, forcing the referee to wave off the fight.\\"Photo: Kevin Mitchell's Gruesome Eye Injury After TKO\\".

The year ended on a sour note for Mitchell on 12 December, as he made another attempt at vying for a world title on the undercard of Anthony Joshua vs. Dillian Whyte. On the line was the WBA interim lightweight title, and facing him was Ismael Barroso, a then-unknown power puncher who came in with a near-perfect knockout record. From the opening round, Mitchell was unable to fend off the undefeated southpaw, who knocked him down three times. By the fifth round, the referee spared Mitchell from further damage and stopped the fight. Immediately afterwards, Mitchell had to be given oxygen by ringside doctors.Anderson, David (12 December 2015). \\"Kevin Mitchell battered by Ismael Barroso and left needing oxygen as world title hopes end\\".

In 1997, a new group organized by the Amana settlement organization and moved to resettle Hemdat. This group was made up of students at the Bnei David pre-military yeshiva academy in Eli and one family named Shitrit. Education Three months after the re-founding of the village, a religious pre-military academy was established called Hemdat Yehuda. Other educational institutions include a nursery school and a kindergarten. Young children learn at the elementary school on the Sde Eliyahu kibbutz.

He was engaged in the West End as a composer and musical director from 1883 to 1904. Life and career Slaughter was born in Fitzroy Square, London.The Musical Herald, 1 December 1906, p. 359 He attended the City of London School, and sang in the choir of St. Andrew's Church, Wells Street under Joseph Barnby.Obituary, The Musical Herald, 1 April 1908, p. 105 After leaving school, he worked in a wine merchant's office and then for the music publishers Metzler.The Strand Magazine, 4 July 1892, p. 85 While there, he studied music under Alfred Cellier, Berthold Tours, and Georges Jacobi, the musical director of the Alhambra Theatre. He was also brought into frequent contact with Arthur Sullivan, who gave him much encouragement and friendly advice. Slaughter once asked Sullivan the best way to study composition; Sullivan replied, \\"Take off your gloves, go into the orchestra and study it there, as an engineer studies his business in the engine room.\\" Slaughter married Luna Lauri (\\"Mlle. Luna\\"), one of the two famous dancing daughters of John Lauri, ballet-master at the Alhambra Theatre. Their daughter, Marjorie Slaughter, also became a composer.Obituary, Cremona, March 1908, p. 35 Early career Slaughter served as the organist at St. Andrew's and as a cellist and pianist in music halls prior to becoming a musical director in West End theatre productions. Before he was 20, he had composed three ballets for the South London Palace. His early works also included some individual songs, one of which was the popular \\"The Dear Homeland\\". He composed the music for the successful all- women one-act opera di camera An Adamless Eden (1882 at the Opera Comique),The Times, 14 December 1882, p. 5 which was produced in Britain and in America (1884) by Lila Clay's ladies' company.

He also wrote a work called Sappho that year for the Opera Comique, which was not as well received because of a weak libretto.The Times, 12 February 1886, p. 13 Slaughter later wrote the score to the medieval comic opera Marjorie produced by the Carl Rosa Opera Company in 1890 (Prince of Wales's Theatre, 193 performances), and contributed to the Gaiety Theatre's Cinderella burlesque, Cinder-Ellen Up-too-Late in 1891 and King Kodak in 1894. In 1893 he composed the score for a musical farce, Peggy's Plot, for the German Reeds.The Times, 22 December 1893, p. 11 At the same time, Slaughter composed incidental music for plays, including those produced at the St. James's Theatre, while he was employed as the musical director there, including, in 1890, Walter Frith's Molier√® and Quinton and Hamilton's Lord Anerley; in 1891, Haddon Chambers's The Idler; and in 1892, Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan and Donna Luiza (with Basil Hood as librettist). Peak years Theatre poster for The French Maid, 1897 Slaughter's breakthrough success came in 1895 in collaboration with Hood with the musical comedy Gentleman Joe, The Hansom Cabbie as a vehicle for the low comic Arthur Roberts. Bernard Shaw dismissed the score in The Saturday Review: \\"The music, by Mr. Walter Slaughter, does not contain a single novel, or even passably fresh point, either in melody, harmony or orchestration.\\"The Saturday Review, 9 March 1895, p. 315 However, the show ran for 391 performances and enjoyed a New York production the following year. This was followed in 1896 by another collaboration with Hood that produced The French Maid, which debuted at Terry's Theatre and was a long-lived international success (480 performances in London, and a long-running New York production), and the less successful Belinda. He also wrote incidental music to Henry James's Guy Domville (1895) and The Prisoner of Zenda (1896) around this time. In 1897, Basil Hood and Slaughter wrote a series of short children's musicals based on fairy tales that received warm reviews.\\"Terry's Theatre\\", The Times, 24 December 1897, p. 6\\"'The Happy Life,' by Louis N. Parker, to be Produced at the Duke of York's Theatre\\", The New York Times, December 5, 1897 Also with Hood, Slaughter wrote a farcical musical comedy, Dandy Dan the Lifeguardsman (1897, Lyric Theatre), another successful vehicle for Roberts, and Orlando Dando, The Volunteer (1898), a similar success for Dan Leno at the Fulham Grand Theatre and then on tour. Next, Slaughter wrote three shows for the Vaudeville Theatre managed by Seymour Hicks. The most successful of these was Bluebell in Fairyland (1901), produced by Charles Frohman and starring Hicks and his wife, Ellaline Terriss. This turned out to be the most popular Christmas entertainment of its time and was continually revived for the next four decades. Other 1901 works were Little Miss Modesty and The English Rose. An English Daisy, written with Hicks, was produced on Broadway with a Kingston run in 1902. Slaughter wrote several more shows, including Little Hans Andersen with Hood (1903) and The Hooligan Band with Charles H. Taylor (1906). He also served as the first musical director for Oswald Stoll at the London Coliseum from 1904 to 1906. He died in London in 1908 at the age of 48.

Although St. Martin is a single island, it contains two separate nations: Saint-Martin, a French overseas collectivity; and Sint Maarten, part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Although each side's culture is influenced by their respective administering countries, they share enough similar heritage and traditions that it can be difficult to tell where Saint- Martin ends and Sint Maarten begins. The native Creole population can trace most of their roots to Africa, France, the Netherlands and the British Isles. Only some stones remain from the ruins of the two forts built by the Spanish occupation in its early take over. But during the colonial period, the British settlers and several military dominations left their idiom as the main language spoken on the island, and have made a large impact on St. Martin's culture. Nowadays, due to a major influx of immigrants searching for better employment and living conditions, over the past twenty years the number of Creoles has been surpassed by the number of immigrants. Today, the island's population of 77,000 is highly diverse, containing people from more than 70 different countries. With so many different nationalities present, quite a few languages are spoken. An English-based creole is the main local vernacular.Holm (1989) Pidgins and Creoles, vol. 2 However, the official languages are French for Saint-Martin, with Dutch and English being official for Sint Maarten. Other common languages include various French creoles (spoken by French Caribbean immigrants), Spanish (spoken by immigrants from the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and various South American countries), and Papiamento (spoken by immigrants from Aruba, Bonaire and Cura√ßao).Culture of St. Maarten . St. Maarten Tourism Office. In French Saint-Martin, the most popular religion is Roman Catholicism. Dutch Sint Maarten favors Protestant denominations, particularly Methodism. The island also has small Jewish and Seventh-day Adventist communities. The whole island is known for its excellent cuisine. Creole, French, and West Indian cooking are particularly renowned. Popular music on St. Martin includes a variety of styles beloved throughout the Caribbean. Calypso, merengue, soca, zouk, and reggae all contribute to the festive culture.

Landscape photograph circa. 1873‚Äì83 Nature photography is a wide range of photography taken outdoors and devoted to displaying natural elements such as landscapes, wildlife, plants, and close-ups of natural scenes and textures. Nature photography tends to put a stronger emphasis on the aesthetic value of the photo than other photography genres, such as photojournalism and documentary photography. Purdue Univ., \\"Nature and Landscape Photography\\" , from Visualizing Nature: Promoting Public Understanding and Appreciation of Nature, [Department of] Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, retrieved October 4, 2015. \\"Nature photography\\" overlaps the fields of -- and is sometimes considered an overarching category including -- \\"wildlife photography,\\" \\"landscape photography,\\" and \\"garden photography\\". Nature photographs are published in scientific, travel and cultural magazines such as National Geographic Magazine, National Wildlife Magazine and Audubon Magazine or other more specific magazines such as Outdoor Photographer and Nature's Best Photography. Well known nature photographers include Ansel Adams, Eliot Porter, Frans Lanting, Galen Rowell, and Art Wolfe. Wildlife photography Indian elephants at Mudumalai National Park, India Nature photography includes images from both large and small subjects.

The animals are often photographed in action, such as eating, fighting, or in flight. Alternatively, more static portraits may be used to show detail of the animal or to depict it in its environment. Captive or controlled animals are often photographed instead of true wild specimens, although it is arguable as to whether this constitutes true wildlife photography. The world's largest photography organizations, the Photographic Society of America, the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Art Photographique and the Royal Photographic Society have agreed on a definition for nature and wildlife photography that will be applied to photography competitions.http://rps.org/news/2014/may/nature- definition-agreed Accessed 25 May 2014 The techniques of wildlife photography differ greatly from those used in landscape photography. For example, in wildlife photography wide apertures are used to achieve a fast shutter speed, freeze the subject's motion, and blur the backgrounds, while landscape photographers prefer small apertures. Wildlife is also usually shot with long telephoto lenses from a great distance; the use of such telephoto lenses frequently necessitates the use of a tripod (since the longer the lens, the harder it is to handhold). Many wildlife photographers use blinds or camouflage. Macro and texture The macro photography article explains close-up photography in general; however, this is also a type of nature photography. While common macro subjects ‚Äì bees, dragonflies, and so on ‚Äì could be described as wildlife, their world also makes for good photography. Many photographers record images of the texture in a stone, tree bark, leaf, or any of other small scenes. Many of these images are abstract. Tiny plants and mushrooms are also popular subjects. Close-up nature photography doesn't always need a true macro lens; however, the scenes here are small enough that they're generally considered different from regular landscapes. Use of color Color images are not a requirement of nature photography. Ansel Adams is famous for his black-and-white depictions of nature, while Galen Rowell praised Fujifilm Velvia film for its bright, saturated colors, asking \\"Who wants to take dull pictures that will last a hundred years?\\"Galen Rowell's Vision, Galen Rowell, Both men distinguish between photography as an expressive art form and sensitometry; an accurate reproduction is not necessary. Ethics A number of ethical concerns and debates surround the creation of nature photography. Common issues involve the potential of stress or harm to wildlife, the potential of photographers overrunning and destroying natural areas, the use of game farms, and veracity and manipulation in photography. Also the information posted by photographers on social media of the location of endangered species leads to poachers using this information to hunt these animals.

Early life Ong Keng Sen was youngest of six children born to immigrants from Putian, China. Ong joined the drama club at Anglo-Chinese Primary School and went on to serve as president of the Varsity Playhouse of the National University of Singapore as he was studying law. A trained lawyer, he completed his pupillage at Singapore law firm Lee & Lee. Ong is also Fulbright scholar who studied intercultural performance with the Performance Studies Department at Tisch School of the Arts, New York University. Theatre career Theatre Ong took on the post of artistic director of theatre group TheatreWorks in 1988. He was involved with the production of comedies such as Beauty World and Army Daze. His local productions include Destinies of Flowers in the Mirror and Descendants of the Admiral Eunuch. Ong was the director of Singapore International Festival of Arts (SIFA) from 2014 to 2017. The SIFA was a revamped, independent version of its predecessor, the Singapore Arts Festival. Ong was invited to recreate this national performing arts festival after an industry review. He was the first artist to helm the festival since the festival's inception in 1977, which had previously been headed by civil servants. Ong restructured the festival and renamed it SIFA to highlight the Singapore and international perspectives in it. Beginning with 20,000 audiences in SIFA 2014, this has increased to 62,000 and in 2016, the festival peaked with 155,000 attendances, 96% capacity houses and 75% of its performances sold out. Further in 2016, he was responsible for raising 20% of the S$9 mil festival through sponsorship. During his tenure, he has brought international artists to work with Singapore art schools. He has capacity- built cultural development through his scaffold of an alternating international and local focus for SIFA from year to year. As festival director, he has been vocal about the government restrictions and non- transparent OB markers for performance arts staged in Singapore. In addition to serving as festival director, Ong has directed one performance every year at the festival. Ong directed Facing Goya, a Michael Nyman-composed opera, for the opening of Singapore International Festival of Arts 2014. In 2015, Ong directed a six-hour site-specific performance, The Incredible Adventures Of Border Crossers, for the opening of the inaugural Singapore Festival in France at the Palais de Tokyo. The production involved 30 foreigners and explored what it meant to be a \\"border crosser\\". The festival also re-staged at Theater de la Ville Paris, TheatreWorks' Lear Dreaming, directed by Ong. In the same year, Lear, directed by Ong and written by Rio Kishida, was selected by The Business Times as one of the \\"finest plays in 50 years\\" alongside productions by Goh Poh Seng, Michael Chiang and Alfian Sa'at and others. In 2016, Ong created Sandaime Richard based on Hideki Noda's script of the same title with kabuki onnagata Kazutaro Nakamura as Richard III. This gender bending production at Tokyo Metropolitan Theater was followed by a new production of Trojan Women at the National Theater of Korea, showcasing a blend of pansori, K-pop and Greek tragedy. In particular, the show gained much attention by casting a male pansori singer as Helen of Troy. Film Ong directed the Singaporean film Army Daze, based on a play written by Michael Chiang. The movie was released in 1996. Themes and style Ong is a member of the Asia- Europe Network, which promotes the artistic exchange between Asia and Europe. He has been applauded around the world for this kind of transcultural theatre which mixes Western and Eastern performance traditions, especially dance with spoken word drama. Ong is largely contributed to cultivating young, educated, imaginative audiences for new works. Ong's unique \\"process-oriented\\" projects involves placing wide ranges of master practitioners of different traditions on the same stage, but remaining independent in their own aesthetics. He is particularly well known for his performance at the Bunkamura Cocoon Tokyo production of Lear in 1997, his Desdemona at the Adelaide Festival, Australia in 2000, and his Search:Hamlet at the Kronbourg Castle in Elsinore and Copenhagen. Accolades Ong is the first artist to have received the two most acclaimed Singaporean cultural awards, the Young Artist Award (1992) and the Cultural Medallion (2003). In 2010, he received the prestigious Fukuoka Prize for Art and Culture for his contemporary performance directions. Personal life Ong Keng Sen is the younger brother of Ong Keng Yong.

In 2010, it was named as a census-designated place with a population of 905. On September 8, 2018, Start held a community wide celebration in recognition of its centennial year as the named place of Start. Geography Start is located at (32.48639, -91.85917). Start is located near the Boeuf River to the east and Lafourche Diversion Canal to its west. A small tributary called Crew Lake flows through the community. Major highways *20px I-20, Exit 132 *20px Louisiana Highway 80 *20px Louisiana Highway 132 The Kansas City Southern Railway also passes through the community, running east and west. Community Start is a small, rural, farming community. There are four churches, including Start Baptist Church, Crew Lake Methodist Church, Faith Baptist Church, and Start Assembly of God. The Start Post Office, Start Fire Department, and Start Water System each serve the residents in this community. The Start Fire Department has two stations, located on the north and south side of the railroad. Start Elementary School, which is operated by the Richland Parish School Board, is a public school for kindergarten through the sixth grade. History Prior to the creation of Richland Parish in 1868, The area now recognized as Start was situated in Morehouse Parish. After the new parish of Richland was formed, this area was often referred to as Ward 3, Crew Lake, Charleston, or Wynn Island. Start officially derived its name in 1918 when the United States Postal Service officially accepted it as new name of the community. Charleston was originally submitted, but this name was rejected. The owner of a small mercantile store in Start named James M. Morgan was granted permission to receive mail at his store, but the area would need a permanent name. James Morgan's daughter, Rachel, suggested that they name the community Start, because they were making a new Start. This name was officially approved by the USPS on September 7, 1918. Louisiana Public Broadcasting aired a segment in 2006 on Louisiana: The State We're In, detailing how the community came up with the name of Start. In the summer on 1923, the Richland Parish School Board passed a motion to advertise for bids on a new high school building, to be known once constructed as Start High School. Marie Robinson was the sole graduate of Start's first graduating class, held in the spring of 1925. Up until November 29, 1930 mail was continually delivered to both Start and Crew Lake, (located directly west of Start.) After this date, Crew Lake ceased to also serve as a post office location, and the primary hub for mail became Start. In 1937, Congressman Newt V. Mills announced that the Resettlement Administration, (a New Deal program initiated under President Franklin D. Roosevelt), had purchased the 3,000 acre Millsaps Plantation. This program provided for approximately 40 new families to move in to the Start community. Notable people Tim McGraw, returned to his hometown for an outdoor concert on September 7, 2002, where more than 40,000 people were in attendance on the site of the C.W. Earle cotton gin. The concert was broadcast nationwide NBC in November 2002. Mcgraw was raised in Start and grew up believing his stepfather, Horace Smith, was his father and until he met his biological father, McGraw's last name was Smith. At age 11, McGraw discovered his birth certificate while searching in his mother's closet to look for a picture for a school project. Following the discovery, McGraw learned from his mother who his biological father was and took him to meet the elder McGraw for the first time. Tug McGraw denied the parentage for seven years until McGraw was 18 years old. After that time, the two formed a relationship and remained close until the former baseball star's death in 2004.

The idea for this project was first developed during a field survey in 2001 conducted by Md. Osman Gani, Ishtiaq U. Ahmad, James L. D. Smith and K. Ullas Karanth. They realized that the Sundarbans mangrove forest at the mouth of the Ganges River contained one of the largest populations of wild tigers in the world. As such, there was an urgent need to start measures that would ensure the protection of this precious area. The Save the Tiger Fund and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service generously donated funds to support the initial phase of research that aims to collect data on tiger ecology using telemetry and study the tiger's environment by assessing its habitat and prey. But management of a wilderness area needs more than just information on the species to be protected. Personnel with skills and resources to implement conservation strategies and the general support of the country are also required. From the research base, the project is evolving rapidly to encompass capacity building and conservation awareness activities. It has been able to do so through the forward thinking approach to management taken by the Forest Department and the incredible support of the Bangladeshi people. From 2004 to 2008, the project was administered by the Forest Department and used wildlife consultants from the University of Minnesota to advise on research strategies and train staff. From 2008 to 2012 the project was coordinated by the Wildlife Trust of Bangladesh, with advisory support from the Zoological Society of London. From 2013 the project has changed its name to \\"TigerTeam\\" under the coordination of the Wildlife Trust of Bangladesh, which in 2013 changed its name to \\"WildTeam\\".

Its position on the geographical periphery of the island of Great Britain is also a factor. Cornwall shares some of the political issues of the other Celtic nations, in particular Wales, and a notable movement exists seeking greater powers of self-government within the UK, similar to that achieved in Wales. Cornish politics is also defined by its historical relationship between the Liberal Democrats (and formerly the Liberal Party), and the Conservative Party.  History  Cornwall's politics have partly been dictated by its geography and history. It is a peninsula, relatively distant from London, and its main industries ‚Äì fishing, farming, and various kinds of mining, have been in decline for a long time. Cornwall's GDP still remains low. However, Cornwall is attractive to tourists, and to people seeking to move into the area to live. There are therefore tensions in the housing market between the demands of inward migrants to the area and the needs of local people. Historically, Cornwall was a Brittonic-speaking area separate from the rest of England until about the 10th century and retained much of its cultural distinctiveness in later centuries. Religious non- conformism was strong in Cornwall, and the Church of England was less well supported than some areas to the east. This has continued to inform later Cornish politics, in the form of Liberalism, now represented mainly by the Liberal Democrats can be traced to historical associations with Liberalism and non-conformist religion, particularly Methodism, in the 19th century and similarly land ownership and the Conservative party in the same period. The Conservative Party is also fairly strong in Cornwall, but for slightly different reasons. They suffered a particularly bad setback in the 1990s. However, they regained three of the six Cornish seats in the 2010 general election. The Labour Party is traditionally much weaker in Cornwall than many other parts of the UK, although it has had some representation locally. This may be partly because there is no major urban center in Cornwall ‚Äì Plymouth tends to fulfill that role. Cornwall also traditionally elects a number of independent councillors, and is a centre for the rump Liberal Party in the UK. The distinctive nature of Cornish politics has led to a significant number of officeholders from both the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative Party being supportive of greater Cornish autonomy. However, with both parties this has never been official national policy. 1986 saw the death of the charismatic MP David Penhaligon of the (then) Liberal Party. Penhaligon's career looked promising, with some tipping him as a future leader. In a speech he made in support of the Cornish miners at Camborne, he said: Cornwall's distinctiveness as a national, as opposed to a regional, minority has been periodically recognised by major British papers. For example, a Guardian editorial in 1990 pointed to these differences, and warned that they should be constitutionally recognised: :\\"Smaller minorities also have equally proud visions of themselves as irreducibly Welsh, Irish, Manx or Cornish. These identities are distinctly national in ways which proud people from Yorkshire, much less proud people from Berkshire will never know. Any new constitutional settlement which ignores these factors will be built on uneven ground.\\"The Guardian, editorial, 8 May 1990 At a local level the tradition of Independent candidates and councillors is far stronger than most other areas. Mebyon Kernow was formed in 1951, initially as a pressure group. Some of its members and supporters were politicians (councillors and MPs) from the three main British political parties, but later on, it became a party in its own right and members of other parties left. Its most famous supporter of the time was the novelist Daphne du Maurier. One of Mebyon Kernow's main campaigns is for a Cornish Assembly and in 2001 it presented a petition to 10 Downing Street with 50,000 signatures in favour of the Assembly.50,000 Assembly petition presented to 10 Downing Street This was backed up by Cornwall Council's Feb 2003 MORI poll which showed 55% in favour of an elected, fully devolved regional assembly for Cornwall and 13% against. (Previous result 46% in favour in 2002). Growing dissatisfaction with European Union fishing policy including the Common Fisheries Policy has recently led to a growth of support for United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) within fishing ports such as Newlyn. On 26 July 2007 the Conservative party-appointed Mark Prisk (Member of Parliament for Hertford and Stortford) \\"Shadow Minister for Cornwall\\". This appointment was called \\"the fictional minister for Cornwall,\\" by a Liberal Democrat MP, as there was no government minister to shadow.http://www.newstatesman.com/uk- politics/2009/03/conservative-party-local-mps The post was not continued following the 2010 election, and no longer exists. This was to put the Duchy's concerns \\"at the heart of Conservative thinking\\", according to a party statement. Conservative Party leader David Cameron said he wholeheartedly endorsed the appointment and it would ensure that the voice of Cornwall is heard.Mark Prisk appointed Tory Shadow Minister for Cornwall However, as the post has been discontinued, this concept remains unproven. In the June 2016 EU referendum, Cornwall voted decisively to leave the EU, 43.5per cent (140,540) of Cornwall's voters wanted to remain in the EU, while 56.5per cent (182,665) voted to leave.http://www.westbriton.co.uk/8203-we-got-there-dreckly-cornwall- s-out-vote-is-the-last-to-be-announced-in-eu- referendum/story-29439264-detail/story.html#sKK6H6jikMMIJAsJ.99  Westminster representation  From the 2010 general election, Cornwall has had six parliamentary constituencies Following a review by the Boundary Commission for England taking effect at the 2010 general election, Cornwall is divided into six county constituencies to elect MPs to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.

Cornwall Council election results, 4 June 2009 Elections for the new unitary Cornwall Council were held on 4 June 2009, and 123 members were elected, replacing the previous 82 councillors of Cornwall County Council and also another 249 (some of whom were also county councillors) on the six district councils.Cornwall Council June 2009 Electoral divisions At the 2009 elections, the Liberal Democrats lost overall control of Cornwall, with no single party gaining overall control of the new council. Although the Conservatives now have the largest number of elected members, they do not have a majority.Lib Dems lose control of Cornwall in June 2009 Cornwall Council elections The Conservatives received 34% of the vote and won 50 seats, followed by the Liberal Democrats on 28% winning 38 seats, the Independents 23% and 32 seats, and Mebyon Kernow 4% and three seats. The turnout was 41%. Labour, the Green Party, UKIP and the BNP failed to secure any seats in Cornwall.Cornwall Council election results 5 June 2009BBC Cornwall 2009 Cornwall Council election results Cornwall Council election results, May 2013 The council remained as \\"no overall control\\", with the Independent politicians becoming the largest grouping on the council through a modest gain of councillors from the previous election. The Liberal Democrats remained the second largest party after losing 2 councillors and the Conservatives slipped to third after losing over a third of their councillors. The Labour Party (+8), UKIP (+6), and the Green Party (+1) all gained seats, with UKIP and the Greens entering Cornwall Council for the first time. Mebyon Kernow had 6 councillors prior to the election, having added 2 since the 2009 election, their total following the election was reduced to 4.https://democracy.cornwall.gov.uk/mgElectionResults.aspx?ID=15&RPID;=4025451 Cornwall Council election results, May 2017 The Conservative Party became the largest group on Cornwall Council, with 46 seats achieving 35% of the overall vote.

Three UK political parties recognise the cause of Cornish self- determination, the Liberal Party, the Cornish section of the Green Party of England and Wales and the Communist Party of Britain. However, in the 2015 general election, the Liberal party in Cornwall withdrew its candidates, and encouraged its supporters to vote UKIP An Gof have also expressed Cornish nationalism, though not in political ways as much as violent ones.  Cornish nationalist and/or regionalist organisations  The principal political party in the Cornish Nationalist movement is Mebyon Kernow which labels itself as a 'centre-left, green and decentralist party' and has close association with its sister party Plaid Cymru in Wales. Mebyon Kernow's membership is calculated at around 1,000 members across Cornwall. In 1979, in the first elections to the European Parliament, Mebyon Kernow won almost 10% (over 10,000 votes) of the vote in the Cornwall seat. This reflected a decade of steady growth for the party. MK continues to contest parliamentary seats and also local government seats. In the 2015 general election, Mebyon Kernow fielded candidates in all of the constituencies in Cornwall. Mebyon Kernow declined to stand candidates in the 2017 general election, stating; \\"The timing of this snap election, so close to the local polls, makes it impractical for a party with our level of resources to put together and finance a meaningful campaign for the General Election.\\"https://www.mebyonkernow.org/news/article.php?id=317 In 2019, Mebyon Kernow fielded only one candidate (Dick Cole) in the Newquay and St Austell constituency. In the district elections of 2007 seven Mebyon Kernow district councillors were elected. MK lost one district seat and gained two, a net gain of one. This gave them seven of the 249 seats (2.8% of seats) up for election. Mebyon Kernow got around 5 percent of the total vote in these district elections, putting the party in third position behind the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative Party and ahead of Labour in several seats including Kerrier, Restormel, North Cornwall and Caradon.BBC ‚Äì 2007 Local Election results Prior to the 2013 local elections Mebyon Kernow held six seats on the council, having gained two due to defections from other parties, and winning one in a by-election. Keeping the seat won in the by-election, and a gain of one seat elsewhere, left them with four in total. This dropped them to being the sixth largest group on the council, from the position of fourth largest prior to the election, being overtaken by UKIP and The Labour party.https://democracy.cornwall.gov.uk/mgElectionResults.aspx?ID=15&RPID;=4025451 The Cornish Nationalist Party was founded as a splinter group from Mebyon Kernow in the 1970s following a split over the ideological path of the Cornish National Movement, the members of the Cornish Nationalist party favouring a more 'right of centre approach' to attracting support. Initially led by Dr James Whetter, the Cornish Nationalist Party are not a registered political party under the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998 and therefore cannot stand for local or Westminster elections. In addition to political parties, other independent organisations promote the autonomy movement. The Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament was a human rights pressure group which claimed to be a revival of the mediaeval Stannary Parliaments, local legislative organisations in the mining regions. It was established in 1974 and had campaigned against the government of the United Kingdom's position on the constitutional status of Cornwall. The group has not been active since 2008.http://www.cornishstannaryparliament.co.uk/ Other groups include TGG (Tyr-Gwyr-Gweryn), Cornwall 2000, Cornish Solidarity who were constitutional and Cornish human rights groups, but are no longer active, and the Cornish Constitutional Convention which campaigns for a Cornish Assembly. Other issues and lobby groups Within Cornwall there are a growing number of pressure groups/lobbying groups devoted to Cornish issues other than the national question. Local environmental issues feature prominently, notably the Surfers against Sewage group, formed in this region, heavily dependent on the tourist industry. The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) has a local presence, with a branch in Penzance.CND ‚Äì Local Group Contacts Some east Cornwall CND activists are members of the Plymouth branch. There is a Cornish branch of Greenpeace. Amnesty International have a local branch.

G√∂khan Mert Koral left the group in early 2003. They played in many Turkish festivals like Rock'n Coke. Their biggest hits were \\"Bu Sabahlarƒ±n Bir Anlamƒ± Olmalƒ±\\", \\"Serzeni≈üte\\", and \\"Elimde Deƒüil\\". For their first album Tamam Sustum, the group collaborated with Turgay G√ºlaydƒ±n from Athena and Burak Karata≈ü from Kargo.  Career   Foundation and first album  Vega was founded in 1996 by guitarist Tuƒürul Aky√ºz, keyboardist Mert Koral and vocalist Deniz √ñzbey. Aky√ºz and Koral knew each other from their time at the ITU Electronic Engineering and were making music in English since 1992. Together with the Mimar Sinan University graduate, Deniz √ñzbey, they started to write their own songs, and the first piece, \\"Tamam Sustum\\", was noticed by NR1 M√ºzik's founder Murat Akad, who encouraged the group to keep working on new songs. Deniz √ñzbey and Tuƒürul Aky√ºz are married since 1999 and have a daughter together.  2000s  The band started working on their new albums in 2000 and new records were made in 2001. In the summer of 2002, the group's second album, Tatlƒ± Sert, was released. The album's production was taken from NR1, and given to Procekts, a music company founded by Teoman and connected to Universal M√ºzik, but he didn't contribute much to this album due to his own projects. The group performed at their first concert for the album on 2 July 2002 at the H2000 festival. However, due to the financial hardships experienced by the company Universal, only 5000 copies of the album were prepared and not much promotion was done for it. In 2005, the band started playing new songs at concerts and by the end of the year their third album, Hafif M√ºzik, was released by Sony BMG. The album's first music video was made for the song \\"Serzeni≈üte\\", written by Deniz √ñzbey and Tuƒürul Aky√ºz. Later, separate music videos were released for the song \\"Elimde Deƒüil\\" and \\"Hafif M√ºzik\\". The release of the album was followed by a concert tour inside Turkey. The group also performed at the Rock'n Coke 2006. As the album's tour ended in 2008, Tuƒürul and Deniz Aky√ºz's daughter, Ceylin, was born towards the end of the year.  2010s  In 2015, Vega began new activities and started working for their new album. On 11 September 2017, the album's titled was announced as Delinin Yƒ±ldƒ±zƒ± and it was released a week later. A concert tour in support of the album began on 30 September, which included 11 concerts.  Discography  Tamam Sustum (OK I Shut Up) (NR1 M√ºzik, 1999) #(Tamam) Sustum!

Biography Club career Jacob Burns began his career with the local team Sydney United. He then moved to local rivals Parramatta Power, whom he left in 2000 to join the Premier League club Leeds United. They signed him as squad cover, and he only played eleven games during his three-year stay. His contract was allowed to run out, and on 17 October 2003 he joined Barnsley on a free transfer. He also spent three seasons at Barnsley however these were a lot more respectable, as he played 91 times gaining 8 goals and one assist, as well as the club captaincy. However, he craved another chance at international football, and so in 2006 he followed the chance of Champions League football to Polish League champions Wisla Krakow. When Wisla manager Dan Petrescu moved to Romanian top-flight team Unirea Urziceni at the start of the 2008‚Äì09 season, the Australian followed. Burns' time in Romania was of mixed form and inconsistent appearances, and at the end of that one season, he decided the time was right for a return to his home land. On 4 May 2009, it was announced that Burns had signed a three-year contract with A-League club Perth Glory.Perth snaps up Burns He has also been awarded the club captaincy. In the 2011‚Äì12 season, Burns led the Glory to the A-League Grand Final, and despite losing, he was awarded the Joe Marston Medal awarded to the best player of the match. Burns was in turns praised and criticised for the sportsmanship he showed after the match, following the controversial penalty decision that won Brisbane Roar the championship, and the FFA 'administrative error' which saw the Joe Marston medal incorrectly awarded to Thomas Broich during the on-field presentations.http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/sport/football/aleague-awards- medal-to-wrong-player-20120422-1xffj.html Burns played his 100th game for Glory on 23 November 2013 in a game against Central Coast Mariners, and he was handed a two-match ban. On 4 April 2014 Jacob Burns announced his retirement from football. International career Burns made his full international debut in 2000 against Scotland, and played again in 2001 against Colombia. However his lack of first team football, and then the level of football he played with Barnsley meant that he dropped out of contention. He made his return to the Australia squad for the 2‚Äì0 loss to Kuwait on 6 September 2006. His fourth cap came against Denmark in 2007. In the same year he came off the bench to earn his fifth cap against China where Australia won the match 2‚Äì0. He received a late call up to the Australian squad against Nigeria as a replacement for Tim Cahill, and came on at the start of the second half. He gained another cap in a friendly game against Ghana in Sydney, where he started the match, and came off on the 79th minute. He earned another cap on 10 September 2008 when he replaced Jason Culina in the starting line-up to face Uzbekistan in a World Cup Qualifier. Burns won the praise of Socceroos coach Pim Verbeek for filling in for a virus-stricken Culina at the last minute and performing admirably alongside Carl Valeri in defensive midfield in the side's 1‚Äì0 win in Tashkent. His most recent appearance was on 17 June 2009 when he came on as a second-half substitute against Japan in a World Cup Qualifier won 2‚Äì1 by Australia.

One of these was used as the basis for the original Diva GT in 1961. By this time, Heron also built their own coupe, the Europa, although they did not debut it until the 1962 Racing Car Show. The car had a steel backbone chassis with outriggers fore and aft to support the running gear. Wishbones and coil spring independent suspension provided good handling, it was claimed. The front brakes were discs while drums served at the rear. The GRP body was bonded to this chassis and plywood floorpan. The engine was a Ford straight-four OHV unit with a choice of 997 cc or 1500 cc capacity. With the larger engine, a 0 to time of 8.5 seconds was boasted with a top speed of .

The character was also a regular on the \\"revival\\" series, The New WKRP in Cincinnati (1991‚Äì93), still working as general manager of WKRP. He was played by Gordon Jump in both shows. Before and after the format change Mr. Carlson is a well-meaning, bumbling, childlike man who is completely out of touch with the changes that have occurred in the radio and music business. He keeps his job as general manager of WKRP only because his mother, Lillian Carlson, better known as \\"Mama Carlson\\", owns the station. Unbeknownst to him, his mother has set up WKRP as a tax write-off that is intended to lose money, and she keeps him at the station not because she wants him to succeed but because she expects him to fail. Flashbacks in the episode \\"Bah, Humbug\\" reveal that Mr. Carlson joined WKRP as sales manager in the early 1950s. When his mother fired the previous station manager for being too generous to the employees, Arthur got his job. With the rise of rock n' roll music, WKRP's \\"beautiful music\\" format became outdated and a sure money-loser, appealing only to senior citizens. In the pilot of WKRP, the new program director, Andy Travis, convinces Mr. Carlson that switching the format to rock n' roll might make the station successful and profitable; Mr. Carlson, who wants desperately to prove to his mother that he can be a success, goes along with the change and even gets the nerve to defend Andy's changes to his mother. Only when Arthur shows that much backbone does his mother relent and keep to the format change. \\"Management\\" style Though he accepts the format change, Mr. Carlson is not a fan of rock n' roll music (though he does admit to Andy that he likes Crosby, Stills and Nash), and frequently does not even listen to his own station because he doesn't enjoy the songs or the modern, with-it styles of the disc jockeys. As the series goes on, however, Mr. Carlson becomes more accepting of the format and the changing cultural trends. In the episode \\"In Concert,\\" after eleven kids are trampled to death at a concert by The Who (based on a real-life incident that happened in Cincinnati in 1979), the staff fears that Mr. Carlson, who feels guilty about having helped to promote the concert, will change their format back to \\"elevator music.\\" But Mr. Carlson, who was at the concert and actually found himself enjoying the music (before he learned what happened), understands that the stadium's first-come, first-served seating was to blame for the tragedy, and not the band or the music. \\"We're a rock n' roll station,\\" he declares, \\"and we're going to stay a rock n' roll station.\\" Because Mr. Carlson doesn't know much about the music or about business, he spends most of his time sleeping or playing with various toys he keeps in his office: model trains, a miniature basketball and hoop, or toy soldiers. He defends this practice by saying \\"I'm not a child -- I'm a hobbyist.\\" He is also an avid fisherman, keeping several rods and reels in his office at all times and speaking eloquently of the joys of hooking a fish and then throwing it back. Mr. Carlson has trouble dealing with people, especially with saying \\"no\\"; he will buy anything from a salesman (WKRP sales manager Herb Tarlek once sold him an insurance policy) and tends to whimper when someone yells at him. To protect him from the outside world, he depends on his receptionist, Jennifer Marlowe, whose main job is keeping people away from her boss by any means necessary, including telling them that he's dead. Jennifer and Mr. Carlson have an agreement: she doesn't take memos, and she doesn't serve coffee. (\\"Turkeys Away\\") Despite these foibles, Mr. Carlson has a very strong sense of right and wrong, and at times, stands up for what he believes in and can even be confrontational. This is revealed in an episode where a sleazy photographer (George Wyner) snaps nude pictures of Jennifer as she is changing in another room following a cheesecake photo shoot with Andy Travis. When Carlson finds the pictures in the photographer's studio, he grabs the photographer by his shirt and threatens a lawsuit. In another episode, he gently but firmly supports Andy's decision to fire a new disc jockey replacing Johnny Fever, after it is proven that the DJ (Philip Charles MacKenzie) is being paid with cocaine under a payola plan with a record producer. Some episodes, particularly in the first season, show Mr. Carlson feeling left out at the station and wanting to prove that he, too, can come up with good ideas to make WKRP more successful. The most famous such attempt is chronicled in \\"Turkeys Away,\\" where Mr. Carlson tries to become actively involved in every aspect of running the station, driving the employees crazy with incessant suggestions. He then comes up with what he describes as a brilliant idea for a Thanksgiving promotion, but, distrustful of Andy and the other \\"casually dressed\\" employees, he won't tell anyone what the promotion is, except the obsequious Herb. On the day of the promotion, with news director Les Nessman covering it live, the WKRP staff discovers that Mr. Carlson and Herb are throwing live turkeys out of a helicopter, which promptly plummet to their deaths. When Mr. Carlson returns, covered with feathers, he admits: \\"As God is my witness, I thought turkeys could fly.\\" (Mr. Carlson had released the remaining turkeys on the ground, which promptly attacked Carlson and Herb, hence their being covered in feathers) Despite the fiasco, the employees realize that they need to make Mr. Carlson feel more respected and wanted at the station. This was not the only Carlson sales idea fiasco; according to Johnny Fever, Mr. Carlson once tried to sell 3,000 blonde Dolly Parton wigs on the air; when that failed, Carlson donated them to the Red Cross for earthquake victims. Being generally a straightforward, uncomplicated kind of person, Mr. Carlson sometimes acts as a father figure to members of his staff. By using a low-key, friendly approach, he helps Herb face up to his alcoholism problems, and in the episode \\"Who is Gordon Sims\\", he assists Venus in coming to terms with his past as an Army deserter (albeit with mixed feelings, as Mr. Carlson himself had served in the Marine Corps and is initially very taken aback at hearing of Venus' desertion). Although genial and rather bumbling, Mr. Carlson does display a quick wit at times. In the episode \\"Changes\\", after overhearing Venus and Johnny Fever discuss Venus' racial identity concerns in the station's record library, Mr. Carlson offers some advice to Venus. When Johnny then asks him what he was doing hanging out in the record library in the first place, Carlson replies, deadpan, that he was \\"looking for old Guy Lombardo records and smoking dope.\\" Personal life Arthur Carlson comes from a successful family of Cincinnati business people. Arthur's grandfather, who is seen in one episode in a dream (also played by Gordon Jump), was a miserly businessman who built up Carlson Industries. He left it to Arthur's father, Hank, a sweet-natured man who was more interested in having a good time than running the business. Hank married Lillian, a former actress in Broadway musicals, who soon proved to have a talent for business and took the family business more seriously than Hank did. Eventually Lillian took over the corporation entirely, and Hank died soon after. Because his father died when he was very young, Arthur Carlson was raised mostly by his mother and by her sarcastic butler, Hirsch (Ian Wolfe). Mr. Carlson served in the Marine Corps as an officer, presumably during the Korean War, however, this is never explicitly stated; he also makes reference to being at Guadalcanal, as well as learning some Japanese, which may be a vague indication that he served during World War II instead. He is explicitly referenced as being 48 in an episode aired in 1979, giving him a birth year of 1931 (or possibly 1930) making Korea a much more likely. At some point he saw combat, a fact he confirmed to Venus Flytrap. Mama Carlson has never shown Arthur any open signs of affection, and constantly puts him down: when he tries to hug her, she pushes him aside and says \\"keep away from me!\\" She admits to Andy Travis that she \\"pushed and bullied\\" her son this way because she was trying to make him tough and self- sufficient, like her; instead, by her own admission, the tactic backfired, making him even more weak-willed than his father. He is married to Carmen (Allyn Ann McLerie), a sweet-natured woman who is almost as shy as he is: though they are happily married, their main problem is that they are so anxious to avoid hurting each other's feelings that they rarely tell each other what they really think. They have a son, Arthur Jr., whom they sent off to military school on Mama Carlson's advice; this proved to be a mistake when it turns \\"Little Arthur\\" into a nasty, racist, borderline fascist. In the first season, Mr. Carlson takes his son out of military school, to live with his parents and go to public school, but later references suggest that Little Arthur gets worse, not better; in one episode, it is revealed that Little Arthur wants to join the American branch of the Nazi Party, and in another it's stated that he wants to join the PLO. During the course of the series, Carmen has a surprise pregnancy and, after she and Arthur decide they want the baby, she gives birth to a daughter, whom she and Arthur hope they can raise their own way, without the mistakes they made with their son. The girl's name is later revealed to be Melanie in a subsequent episode. In the episode \\"A Simple Little Wedding\\", it is revealed that Arthur and Carmen have been married for 25 years, and that they eloped when Mama Carlson began taking control of their wedding. When they decide to renew their vows and have a small wedding ceremony (after a humorous aside when Jennifer and Bailey together seductively tell Mr. Carlson that he should \\"play the field\\" first), Mama Carlson initially agrees to remain in the background. When Mama Carlson's characteristic need to control asserts itself again, Arthur and Carmen decide to elope again for the second time. Though Mr. Carlson pays the sexy Jennifer the highest salary of any employee at the station, there is never anything improper about their relationship. He relies on Jennifer to give him the kind of support he never got from his own mother. He also knows that Jennifer, despite her apparent self-reliance, really cares about him and, in her own way, depends on him too: \\"You need me to need you,\\" he tells Jennifer in one episode. Carmen is friendly with Jennifer and shows no jealousy or suspicions of her. Aside from Jennifer, Carlson also relies heavily on Andy Travis. Although their initial meeting was rocky (Carlson didn't remember hiring Andy over the phone, and then tried to fire him after the station's format change to rock and roll), Carlson often turns to Andy for advice (such as when he decided to turn down a funeral home's business because he found their advertising campaign to be tasteless) and often stands behind Andy when Andy's required to make tough decisions (such as firing a DJ who was taking payola from a record company). Mr. Carlson is tempted once in the course of the series, by his first receptionist, Joyce Armour (Rosemary Forsyth). When Joyce stops by to recruit WKRP's business for her rep firm, she takes Carlson out for drinks and then asks him to come see her at her hotel room. A nervous Carlson initially thinks Joyce is coming on to him and so brushes her off, but eventually decides to visit her. After a couple of drinks, and some confused conversation, Joyce explains to Carlson that she was simply trying to drum up some business for her firm, and never intended to mislead him. Carlson replied that she didn't, it was merely his usual misinterpreting of a situation. Joyce then tells Carlson that she was flattered he was attracted to her, stating \\"If you weren't married I'd camp on your doorstep,\\" to which Carlson replied before departing, \\"If I wasn't married, you wouldn't be camping very long.\\" Mr. Carlson is a Republican; he belongs to the local Kiwanis Club as well as the Rotary Club, attends church every Sunday, and teaches Sunday School. He also drives a Dodge (at a time when Chrysler was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy). In the episode \\"Clean Up Radio Everywhere,\\" his socially conservative leanings cause him to befriend the Reverend Dr. Bob Halyers, the Jerry Falwell-esque leader of an organization dedicated to purging \\"obscene\\" songs from the airwaves. Shocked at reading some of the sexually suggestive lyrics that are being played on his station, Mr. Carlson orders his employees to follow Halyers' suggestions and not play those songs. But when Halyers delivers another list of songs to ban (including songs WKRP hasn't played yet), Mr. Carlson defies Halyers and refuses to co-operate with him anymore, leading to a boycott of WKRP's sponsors. In the closing scene of the episode, Mr. Carlson reaffirms that he likes Halyers personally, but that he won't submit to censorship, and he warns Halyers that anyone who would be cowardly enough to co-operate with him is bound to change his tune when the political winds shift. Carlson's religious views are also brought forward in the episode \\"God Talks to Johnny\\"; when Johnny believes that God is speaking to him and starts to go a little crazy, Carlson helps Johnny regain a sense of normalcy by telling him that it's all right if he thinks God is speaking to him, as long as God doesn't tell him to \\"get naked and hang out at the airport\\". Inspiration and casting According to Jay Sandrich, director of the WKRP pilot, MTM Enterprises originally wanted Roddy McDowall to play Mr. Carlson. When McDowall was unavailable, Sandrich recommended Jump, who had just played a memorable role for Sandrich as the bumbling Police Chief Tinkler on the show Soap. Carlson was a parody of Jerry Blum (c.1932‚ÄìFebruary 16, 2019), the President and General Manager of WQXI in Atlanta, Georgia from 1960 to 1989. The turkey drop, in particular, was a much-exaggerated version of one of Blum's real stunts, when he attempted to drop turkeys off the back of a truck and caused a melee of people looking for a free turkey; Carlson's postmortem was lifted, with only slight alteration, from Blum's own reaction to his stunt. Whereas Carlson was weak and indecisive, Blum was in many ways the opposite, a brash and in-your-face personality (hence his nickname \\"Big Guy\\") frequently seen in oversized sunglasses and a buttoned-down leisure suit.

The band incorporated elements of Southern rock, blues, jazz, and country music, and their live shows featured jam band-style improvisation and instrumentals. The group's first two studio releases stalled commercially, but their 1971 live release, At Fillmore East, represented an artistic and commercial breakthrough. The album features extended renderings of their songs \\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\" and \\"Whipping Post\\", and is often considered among the best live albums ever made. Group leader Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident later that year, and the band dedicated Eat a Peach (1972) in his memory, a dual studio/live album that cemented the band's popularity. Following the motorcycle death of bassist Berry Oakley later that year, the group recruited keyboardist Chuck Leavell and bassist Lamar Williams for 1973's Brothers and Sisters, which, combined with the hit single \\"Ramblin' Man\\", placed the group at the forefront of 1970s rock music. Internal turmoil overtook them soon after; the group dissolved in 1976, reformed briefly at the end of the decade with additional personnel changes, and dissolved again in 1982. The band reformed once more in 1989, releasing a string of new albums and touring heavily. A series of personnel changes in the late 1990s was capped by the departure of Betts. The group found stability during the 2000s with bassist Oteil Burbridge and guitarists Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks (the nephew of their drummer) and became renowned for their month-long string of shows at New York City's Beacon Theatre each spring. The band retired for good in 2014 with the departure of the aforementioned members. Gregg Allman died from complications arising from liver cancer in May 2017. The band has been awarded seven gold and four platinum albums, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. Rolling Stone ranked them 52nd on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time in 2004. Studio and contemporary live albums More so than most bands, the Allman Brothers have frequently released live albums that filled the role of conventional studio albums, in that they were recently recorded and often contained new material not on any studio album, or significantly lengthened or revamped versions of studio material. An integral part of the contemporaneous evolution of the band, such live albums are included in this section. { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\" Title ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\" Album details ! colspan=\\"2\\" Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Certifications - ! style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" US ! style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" AUS - ! scope=\\"row\\" The Allman Brothers Band  * Released: November 1969 * Label: Atco * Format: LP  align=\\"center\\"  188  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Idlewild South  * Released: September 1970 * Label: Atco * Format: LP  align=\\"center\\"  38  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" At Fillmore East (Live)  * Released: July 1971 * Label: Capricorn * Format: LP  align=\\"center\\"  13  ‚Äî  * RIAA: Platinum - ! scope=\\"row\\" Eat a Peach (Part live)  * Released: April 1972 * Label: Capricorn * Format: LP  align=\\"center\\"  4  35  * RIAA: Platinum - ! scope=\\"row\\" Brothers and Sisters  * Released: August 1973 * Label: Capricorn * Format: LP  align=\\"center\\"  1  5  * RIAA: Platinum - ! scope=\\"row\\" Win, Lose or Draw  * Released: August 1975 * Label: Capricorn * Format: LP  align=\\"center\\"  5  ‚Äî  * RIAA: Gold - ! scope=\\"row\\" Wipe the Windows, Check the Oil, Dollar Gas (Live)  * Released: November 1976 * Label: Capricorn * Format: LP  align=\\"center\\"  75  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Enlightened Rogues  * Released: February 1979 * Label: Capricorn * Format: LP  align=\\"center\\"  9  ‚Äî  * RIAA: Gold - ! scope=\\"row\\" Reach for the Sky  * Released: August 1980 * Label: Arista * Format: LP  align=\\"center\\"  27  92  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Brothers of the Road  * Released: August 1981 * Label: Arista * Format: LP  align=\\"center\\"  44  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Seven Turns  * Released: July 3, 1990 * Label: Epic * Format: CD  align=\\"center\\"  53  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Shades of Two Worlds  * Released: July 2, 1991 * Label: Epic * Format: CD  align=\\"center\\"  85  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" An Evening with the Allman Brothers Band: First Set (Live)  * Released: June 9, 1992 * Label: Epic * Format: CD  align=\\"center\\"  80  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Where It All Begins  * Released: May 3, 1994 * Label: Epic * Format: CD  align=\\"center\\"  45  ‚Äî  * RIAA: Gold - ! scope=\\"row\\" An Evening with the Allman Brothers Band: 2nd Set (Live)  * Released: May 9, 1995 * Label: Epic * Format: CD  align=\\"center\\"  88  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Peakin' at the Beacon (Live)  * Released: November 4, 2000 * Label: Epic * Format: CD  align=\\"center\\"  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Hittin' the Note  * Released: March 18, 2003 * Label: Sanctuary * Format: CD  align=\\"center\\"  37  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" One Way Out (Live)  * Released: March 23, 2004 * Label: Sanctuary * Format: CD  align=\\"center\\"  190  ‚Äî  -  align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"8\\" style=\\"font-size:90%\\" \\"‚Äî\\" denotes releases that did not chart. } Retrospective live albums \\"Retrospective\\" live albums are various recorded, unreleased, archived concerts during the early years of The Allman Brothers Band.

CASLEO is one of two observatories located within El Leoncito National Park, which is in a part of the country which rarely sees cloud cover. The other facility in the park is the Carlos U. Cesco Astronomical Station of the F√©lix Aguilar Observatory. CASLEO was established in 1983 by an agreement between National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET) of Argentina, the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MINCYT) of Argentina, the National University of San Juan (UNSJ), the National University of La Plata (UNLP), and the National University of C√≥rdoba (UNC). The facility was dedicated in 1986 and regular observations began in 1987. CASLEO's telescopes are located in two separate areas within the El Leoncito Park. The Jorge Sahade and Submillimeter telescopes are at the main site on the edge of the Pampa de la Ci√©naga del Medio, along with support facilities. The Helen Sawyer Hogg telescope, Ghielimetti telescope, and the Astrograph for the Southern Hemisphere are located on Cerro Burek, approximately to the northeast and higher. Separating the areas is the Arroyo El Leoncito, which flows west into the Barreal Blanco in the Pampa de El Leoncito. The driving distance between the two sites is approximately . Telescopes * The Jorge Sahade Telescope (JS) is a Ritchey-Chr√®tien reflecting telescope built by Boller & Chivens. The 40-ton telescope is supported by an equatorial mount. It was installed in 1984 and began regular operations in 1987.

It is part of the Fairfield group in the Eastern Fells. It should not be confused with the Heron Pike that forms part of Sheffield Pike, although it appears that, by coincidence, both Heron Pikes are exactly the same height. Topography Not a fell of great significance, Heron Pike is a slight grassy rise on the long southern ridge of its parent fell Fairfield. Just cresting the 2,000 foot mark at 612 m (2,008 ft), it is mostly climbed as part of the Fairfield horseshoe walk and it lies between the adjoining fells of Nab Scar and Great Rigg. Heron Pike‚Äôs eastern side features Erne Crag and Blind Cove as it falls away quite steeply towards Rydal Beck. At the base of Erne Crag is an old quarry, the mouth of a cavern quite easy to locate.Richards, Mark: Near Eastern Fells: Collins (2003): The fell's western flank drops towards Grasmere and has the small Alcock Tarn on its lower slopes at a height of 360 m (1,180 ft). Alcock Tarn was originally known as Butter Crags Tarn and was enlarged by means of a stone and earth dam in the nineteenth century to a depth of about six feet. The owner, a Mr Alcock of Grasmere, then stocked it with brown trout.Blair, Don: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (2003): Heron Pike has a \\"subsidiary\\" top which qualifies as a Nuttall. It is called Heron Pike North Top on the Nuttall lists, but is also known as Rydal Fell in some guide books.Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): It lies 400 metres north of the main summit at the top of Erne Crag and has a height of 621 m (2,039 ft). The deliberate choice by Alfred Wainwright of the lower top to be the summit in his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells is one of the many oddities which differentiate Wainwrights from more logical hill lists such as Nuttalls or Hewitts. Geology The ridgeline exposes the dacitic welded lapilli-tuff of the Lincomb Tarns Formation.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Ascents Ascents of the fell are commenced either from Rydal or Grasmere; the ascent from Grasmere allows Alcock Tarn to be visited by a short detour while the route from Rydal first climbs Nab Scar. However, the majority of walkers who visit Heron Pike do so either on the way to or on the way back from the main fell of Fairfield. Summit The south summit has flashes of quartz in the uppermost rock and by far the better view. This takes in a fine vista of Windermere, the Coniston and Central Fells. The higher northern top bears the remains of a cross wall, some of this fashioned into a small cairn.

The name of the dish is pronounced in Thai colloquial speech. It is made with stir-fried wide rice noodles, a meat such as chicken, beef, pork, or seafood or tofu, garlic, straw mushrooms, and gai lan (; ). The dish is then covered in a sauce made of stock and tapioca starch or cornstarch. It is seasoned with sweet soy sauce, fish sauce, sugar, and black pepper. In Thailand people often sprinkle some additional sugar, fish sauce, sliced chillies preserved in vinegar (with some of the vinegar), and ground dried chillies on the dish. There are variants, including using rice vermicelli instead of the wide noodles, and using deep fried thin egg noodles (mi krop), with the sauce poured on to soften them. In areas where gai lan can not be easily obtained, broccoli and kale are often used as a substitute.  History  Rat na was originally cooked in China, prepared only in high-end restaurants where it became very successful. Teochew people (Chinese people native to the Chaoshan region) began cooking and selling it to working-class people and its popularity spread to Thailand. Originally, rat na in Thailand was made with a little extra sauce and covered with a banana leaf. Diners themselves cut the fat noodles, which were large and circular, as they ate.

He is a research professor in the Walter Burke Institute for Theoretical Physics in the California Institute of Technology Department of Physics. He has been a contributor to the physics blog Cosmic Variance, and has published in scientific journals such as Nature as well as other publications, including The New York Times, Sky & Telescope, and New Scientist. He has appeared on the History Channel's The Universe, Science Channel's Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman, Closer to Truth (broadcast on PBS), and Comedy Central's The Colbert Report. Carroll is the author of Spacetime And Geometry, a graduate- level textbook in general relativity, and has also recorded lectures for The Great Courses on cosmology, the physics of time, and the Higgs boson. He is also the author of four popular books: From Eternity to Here about the arrow of time, The Particle at the End of the Universe about the Higgs boson, The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself about ontology, and Something Deeply Hidden about the foundations of quantum mechanics. He began a podcast in 2018 called Mindscape, in which he interviews other experts and intellectuals on a variety of science-related topics.  Career  Carroll received his PhD in astronomy in 1993 from Harvard University, where his advisor was George B. Field. His dissertation was entitled Cosmological Consequences of Topological and Geometric Phenomena in Field Theories. He worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara and as an assistant professor at the University of Chicago until 2006 when he was denied tenure. He is now a research professor at Caltech. In 2010, Carroll was elected fellow of the American Physical Society for \\"contributions to a wide variety of subjects in cosmology, relativity, and quantum field theory, especially ideas for cosmic acceleration, as well as contributions to undergraduate, graduate, and public science education\\". In 2014 he was awarded the Andrew Gemant Award by the American Institute of Physics for \\"significant contributions to the cultural, artistic or humanistic dimension of physics.\\" In 2015 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship.  Personal life  Carroll is married to Jennifer Ouellette, a science writer and the former director of the Science & Entertainment Exchange.Claudia Dreifus, \\"Sean Carroll Talks School Science and Time Travel\\", The New York Times, April 19, 2010 The novel Starquake by Robert L. Forward was listed by Carroll as his favorite science fiction novel.  Research  Carroll has worked on a number of areas of theoretical cosmology, field theory and gravitation theory. His research papers include models of, and experimental constraints on, violations of Lorentz invariance; the appearance of closed timelike curves in general relativity; varieties of topological defects in field theory; and cosmological dynamics of extra spacetime dimensions. He has written extensively on models of dark energy and its interactions with ordinary matter and dark matter, as well as modifications of general relativity in cosmology. He has also worked on the foundations of quantum mechanics, especially the Many-Worlds interpretation, including a derivation of the Born Rule for probabilities. His most-cited work, \\"Is Cosmic Speed-Up Due To New Gravitational Physics?\\" (2003) was written with Vikram Duvvuri, Mark Trodden, and Michael Turner. With over 1,900 citations, it helped pioneer the study of f(R) gravity in cosmology.inSPIRE High-Energy Physics Database Carroll has also worked on the arrow of time problem. He and Jennifer Chen posit that the Big Bang is not a unique occurrence as a result of all of the matter and energy in the universe originating in a singularity at the beginning of time, but rather one of many cosmic inflation events resulting from quantum fluctuations of vacuum energy in a cold de Sitter space. They claim that the universe is infinitely old but never reaches thermodynamic equilibrium as entropy increases continuously without limit due to the decreasing matter and energy density attributable to recurrent cosmic inflation. They assert that the universe is \\"statistically time-symmetric,\\" insofar as it contains equal progressions of time \\"both forward and backward\\".Sean M. Carroll, Jennifer Chen, \\"Spontaneous Inflation and the Origin of the Arrow of Time\\"Adam Frank, \\"3 Theories That Might Blow Up the Big Bang\\", Discover, April 2008, pp. 57‚Äì58 Some of his work has been on violations of fundamental symmetries, the physics of dark energy, modifications of general relativity, and the arrow of time. Recently he started focusing on issues at the foundations of cosmology, statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and complexity. In 2017 Carroll presented an argument for rejecting certain cosmological models, including those with Boltzmann Brains, on the basis that they are cognitively unstable: they cannot simultaneously be true and justifiably believed.

Sea Sparrow incident During the autumn of 1992, the United States, Turkey, and several other NATO members participated in \\"Exercise Display Determination 1992\\", a combined forces naval exercise under the overall command of Admiral Jeremy Michael Boorda of the United States Navy. The forces of participating nations were assigned to either of two multinational teams. Vice Admiral T. Joseph Lopez of the United States Navy led the \\"Brown Forces,\\" which included Saratoga. The opposing \\"Green Forces,\\" including Muavenet were under the direct control of Admiral Kroon of the Netherlands. During the \\"enhanced tactical\\" phase of the training exercises, the Brown Forces were to attempt an amphibious landing at Saros Bay in the Aegean Sea against the resistance offered by the Green Forces. Admiral Boorda ordered the units comprising each force to actively seek and \\"destroy\\" each other. Both task force commanders had full authority to engage the simulated enemy when and where they deemed appropriate and to use all warfare assets at their disposal to achieve victory. During an exercise planning session on 1 October 1992, the Battle Group commander, Rear Admiral Philip Dur, ordered that a simulated attack on nearby opposition forces use Sea Sparrow missiles. Sea Sparrow missiles, an anti-aircraft defensive system, was not part of existing doctrine for fighting surface targets and had not been used before, either in exercises or in live combat operations against surface targets. The order was accepted by the Operations staff with the notation that the missile system would be \\"simulated\\" (meaning the missile stations would be unmanned). Just prior to midnight on 2 October 1992, when the exercise was scheduled to begin, Rear Admiral Dur asked whether the Sea Sparrows were ready to go for the exercise. He was told that the use of the missiles was going to be simulated for this exercise. Rear Admiral Dur then directed that the use of the Sea Sparrows was not to be simulated and that the missile team was to be on station for the exercise. Without providing prior notice of the exercise, officers on Saratoga woke the enlisted Sea Sparrow missile team and directed them to conduct the simulated attack. According to U.S. Navy, certain members of the missile firing team were not told that the exercise was a simulation drill, rather than an actual firing event. As the drill progressed, the missile system operator used language to indicate he was preparing to fire a live missile, but due to the absence of standard terminology, the supervisors failed to appreciate the significance of the terms used and the requests made. Specifically, the Target Acquisition System operator issued the command \\"arm and tune\\", terminology the console operators understood to require arming of the missiles in preparation for actual firing. The officers supervising the drill did not realize that \\"arm and tune\\" signified a live firing and ignored two separate requests from the missile system operator to clarify whether the launch order was an exercise. As a result, shortly after midnight on the morning of 2 October, Saratoga fired two Sea Sparrow missiles at Muavenet. The first missile struck in the bridge, destroying it and the Combat Information Center. The second missile struck in the aft magazine but did not detonate. The explosion and resulting fires killed five of the ship's officers and injured 22. Nearby US Navy ships responded in aid to the Turkish ship which was now without leadership. Fire and rescue teams boarded the ship and put out the fires in the bridge and the aft magazine preventing any secondary explosions. The sailors who actually fired the missiles were not punished, but the ship's commanding officer, Captain James M. Drager,CAPT James M.

Lawsuit On 29 September 1994, some of the Turkish Navy sailors serving aboard Muavenet instituted legal action against the United States government. The action encompassed two wrongful death claims and 299 personal injury claims. On 20 February 1997, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court ruling against them.

It is one of the facilities of the British monarch's personal religious establishment, the Chapel Royal, but should not be confused with the 1540 building also known as, Chapel Royal, which is within the palace and just across Marlborough Road. It is a Grade I listed building. History The Queen's Chapel was built as a Roman Catholic chapel at a time when the construction of churches for that denomination was otherwise prohibited in England, and was used by Charles I's French queen Henrietta Maria, who imported chapel furnishings from France. During the English Civil War it was used as a stable. It was refurbished in 1662, and again in the 1680s by Christopher Wren. From the 1690s the chapel was used by the Continental Protestant courtiers of William and Mary. It became a Chapel Royal again in 1938. The chapel was built as an integral part of St James's Palace, but when the adjacent private apartments of the monarch burned down in 1809 they were not replaced, and in 1856‚Äì57 Marlborough Road was laid out between the palace and the Queen's Chapel. The result is that physically the chapel now appears to be more part of the Marlborough House complex than of St James's Palace.

It was first published in 1856, in the literary and political magazine Sovremennik. Background The idea for \\"The Snowstorm\\" dates back to January, 1854, when Tolstoy was lost all night in a snowstorm about 100 versts (~107 km or 66 miles) from Cherkassk and thought to write a story about the event. It was two years later before he carried out his plan and wrote the story. Plot Photo of Tolstoy, by Sergei Lvovich Levitsky, 1856The unnamed narrator of the story and his manservant Alyeshka start on an evening trip by sledge from Novocherkassk in the Caucasus to a destination in central Russia. As they ride, a winter storm begins, and soon the road becomes covered with heavy, thick snow. The narrator becomes concerned about getting lost and queries his driver about their chances of making it safely to the next post station. The driver is somewhat vague and fatalistic concerning the rest of the journey, suggesting that they may or may not get through. The narrator has little confidence in the driver, who seems inexperienced and sullen. A few minutes later, the driver stops the sledge, gets down, and starts searching for the road that they have lost. Disturbed by this situation, the narrator orders the phlegmatic driver to turn back, giving the horses their head to seek out the post station from which they started out. To add to the anxiety, the driver tells a story of some recent travelers who got lost and froze to death in a similar storm. Soon they hear the balls of three men sledges coming toward them and going in the opposite direction. The narrator orders his driver to turn around and follow the fresh tracks of the courier sledges. The tracks and road markers quickly disappear in the drifting snow. The narrator himself now gets out of the sledge to look for the road, but soon loses sight of even the sledge. After finding his driver and sledge, a decision is again made to turn back and return to the station from which they started out. Again they hear the bells of the courier troika, which is now returning to their original starting point, having delivered the mail and changed horses. The narrator's driver suggests that they follow them back. As the narrator's driver tries to turn around, his shafts hit the horses tied to the back of the third mail troika, making them break their straps, bolt, and run. The post driver goes off in search of the runaway horses while the narrator follows the first two sledges at full gallop. In better spirits now that he has somebody to follow, the narrator's driver converses with his passenger affably, telling about his life and family circumstances. Soon they run across a caravan of wagons, led by a mare without help from the driver, who is sleeping. They almost lose sight of the courier sledges, and the driver wants to turn around again, but they go on. The old driver who went to get the runaway horses returns with all three and loses little time in reprimanding the narrator's driver, whose inexperience created the problem in the first place. The narrator begins to daydream, losing himself in the monotonous and desolate snowstorm and musing lyrically about the snow and wind: ‚ÄúMemories and fancies followed one another with increased rapidity in my imagination.‚Äù The narrator conjures up stream-of-consciousness images of his youth: the old family butler on their baronial estate, summers in the country, fishing, languid July afternoons, and finally a peasant drowning in their pond and nobody being able to help. The narrator's driver announces that his horses are too tired to go on, and he proposes that the narrator and his servant go with the post sledges. The baggage is transferred, and the narrator is glad to get into the warm, snug sledge. Inside, two old men are telling stories to pass the time. They give very short, blunt answers to the narrator's suggestion that they all might freeze to death if the horses give out: ‚ÄúTo be sure, we may.‚Äù After driving a while longer, the men in the sledge begin arguing about whether what they see on the horizon is an encampment. The narrator becomes sleepy and thinks that he is freezing to death. He has hallucinations about what it must be like to freeze to death, dozing and waking alternately. The narrator wakes in the morning to find that the snow has stopped and he has arrived at a post station. He treats all the men to a glass of vodka and, having received fresh horses, continues on the next leg of his journey. Reception Contributors to Sovremennik in 1856 (left to right): Ivan Goncharov, Ivan Turgenev, Leo Tolstoy, Dmitri Grigorovich, Alexander Druzhinin and Alexander Ostrovsky.Unlike other text that Tolstoy published at this time (Two Hussars and A Landowner's Morning), reception of \\"The Snowstorm\\" among the literati of contemporary Russia, was generally favorable.Knowles ‚ÄúTolstoy's Literary Reputation before ‚ÄòWar and Peace‚Äô‚Äù p. 635 \\"The Snow Storm\\" still benefited from his high reputation and was seen by its early reviewers less as prose as such, more as poetry in prose in its tonalities and even in its structure; Turgenev was as usual carried away,Letter to Sergey Aksakov, 27 February 1856. See Knowles ‚ÄúTolstoy's Literary Reputation before ‚ÄòWar and Peace‚Äô‚Äù p. 635 and Sergey Aksakov agreed, finding the description of the blizzard the most realistic he had ever read.Russkoye obozreniye, 1894, no. 12. See Knowles ‚ÄúTolstoy's Literary Reputation before ‚ÄòWar and Peace‚Äô‚Äù p. 635 Herzen thought it marvellousLetter to M. K. Reykhel, 18 June 1856. See Knowles ‚ÄúTolstoy's Literary Reputation before ‚ÄòWar and Peace‚Äô‚Äù p. 635 and Alexander Druzhinin wrote in the Biblioteka dlya chteniya1856, no. 139 that there had been nothing quite like it since the days of Pushkin and Gogol. In Modern Language Studies 1987, Sydney Schultze writes: > This slender story serves as the vehicle for a beautiful description of a > snowstorm surrounding an even more vivid description of a blistering day in > July. But there appears to be no point to the story, no message of the sort > one expects from Tolstoj even in his early works.Schultze, ‚ÄúMeaning in ‚ÄòThe > Snowstorm‚Äô‚Äù p. 47 Early commentators like Druzinin praised Tolstoj's descriptive powers in \\"The Snowstorm\\", but did not have much to say about other aspects of the story.A. V. Druzinin, \\"'Metel,\\" 'Dva gusara.' Povesti grafa L. N. Tolstogo,\\" Biblioteka dlia ctenija, 1856, vol. 139 in V. Zelinskij, Russkaja kriticeskaja literatura o proizvedenijax L. N. Tolstogo (Moscow: 1901). Druzinin praises the story's \\"life, style, . . poetry.\\" (pt. 1, p. 57.) Other early critics include Cernysevskij who mentions the story's \\"interior scenes\\"; Grigor'ev who classifies the story as an \\"artistic study\\"; and an unnamed reviewer for Otecestvennye zapiski who compares the story to Puskin's \\"Besy.\\" But perhaps the most interesting comment was made by E. Edel'son in 1863. Edel'son cannot discern any tendency or inner link in Tolstoj's works, but finds Tolstoj an observant, talented, likeable writer who \\"seriously strives for truth.\\" Zelinskij, pt. 1, pp. 80, 94‚Äì99; pt. 2, pp. 2, 34. Later critics have also paid little attention to \\"The Snowstorm\\" beyond a complimentary reference to the description of the storm. Typical is Ernest J. Simmons, who in his biography of Tolstoy says, \\"There is no plot; the theme is the storm ... The effectively repeated motifs of the snow and wind amount almost to the incremental repetition of a folk ballad.\\"Ernest J. Simmons, Leo Tolstoy (New York: 1960), vol. 1, p. 149. Ejxenbaum finds \\"The Snowstorm\\" notable for its plot arrangement, the weaving together of reality and dreams, rather than its fabula (story line).Boris Eikhenbaum, Lev Tolstoj (Munich: 1968), pt. 1, pp. 243‚Äì46.

It looks out over Lake Geneva from an altitude of 1000 meters. Overlooked by the Rochers de Naye summit (2000 meters), the Caux area was traditionally used only by cattle farmers. Late in the 19th century, local riviera hotels owners from Montreux and Territet became aware of the touristic potential of the Caux Mount. Simples inns first, then the massive Caux Grand-H√¥tel (1893), and finally, the spectacular Caux Palace Hotel (1902), masterpiece of Swiss architect Eug√®ne Jost, gave Caux an international status, attracting the wealthiest and most famous guests: Empress Sissi of Austria-Hungary, Lord Robert Baden-Powell, Sacha Guitry, Edgar Wallace, prince Ibn Saud, future king of Saudi Arabia, John D. Rockefeller and the maharajah of Baroda, just to name a few.The informations in this section are drawn from Philippe Mottu‚Äôs historic book: Caux from Belle Epoque to Moral Rearmament, published by La Baconni√®re, Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland, 1969. World War I prematurely killed the Caux luxury hotels. In spite of the efforts of the hotel's owners, the golden years of the Belle Epoque would never return and the 1929 economic crisis and World War II brought all the hotels to bankruptcy for the last time. During World War II, the hotels fell into disrepair and were used to house civilian refugees and interned escaped Allied prisoners of war. Finally some 1,600 Jews from the Kasztner train from Budapest found refuge there.Philippe Mottu, Caux, de la Belle √âpoque au R√©armement moral, la Baconni√®re, Geneva, 1969, p. 48 In 1946 the former Caux Palace Hotel was purchased and renovated by the Moral Re- Armament organization (MRA), for use as an international conference centre to work on the reconciliation of European peoples. They held many workshops and brought together people at many levels of government and society. The historians Douglas Johnston and Cynthia Sampson describe the MRA work as \\"important contribution to one of the greatest achievements in the entire record of modern statecraft: the astonishingly rapid Franco-German reconciliation after 1945.\\".Douglas Johnston and Cynthia Sampson, Religion, the Missing Dimension of Statecraft, Oxford University Press, 1994 The former Caux-Palace Hotel is still today the home of Initiatives of Change's conference centre, which can accommodate up to 450 people. The building is operated as a hotel school for much of the year, the Swiss Hotel Management School, though it still houses the Initiatives of Change annual conferences each summer. The Caux Palace Hotel building can be seen from Montreux and the surrounding area. There is a small historical exhibition that is open to the public. Caux also has two churches, both built in the early 20th century: * The Protestant chapel, originally Anglican (1906), features an audacious timber frame, English style stained-glass windows (representing the deeds of the angels in the Bible), and a series of carved woods : angels on the side and foremost a singular boxwood altarpiece, representing a crucifixion in three dimensions, originating from Bruges. * The Catholic chapel (1907). Caux also offers a wide range of winter-related activities: the first bobsleigh world championship was organised in Caux in 1930. Alpine and cross-country skiing are easily practised around the village, which also hosts an outdoor ice rink. The village of Caux can be reached by train from Montreux, en route to the Rochers de Naye, or the Jaman Pass and peak. The area is popular with birdwatchers, as it lies along a major migration flyway for birds heading south in the autumn.

It is used to diagnose blood coagulation disorders and to assess the effectiveness of fibrinolytic therapy. This test is repeated with pooled plasma from normal patients. The difference in time between the test and the 'normal' indicates an abnormality in the conversion of fibrinogen (a soluble protein) to fibrin, an insoluble protein. The thrombin time compares the rate of clot formation to that of a sample of normal pooled plasma. Thrombin is added to the samples of plasma. If the time it takes for the plasma to clot is prolonged, a quantitative (fibrinogen deficiency) or qualitative (dysfunctional fibrinogen) defect is present. In blood samples containing heparin, a substance derived from snake venom called batroxobinBatroxobin factsheet (formerly reptilase) is used instead of thrombin. Batroxobin has a similar action to thrombin but unlike thrombin it is not inhibited by heparin. Normal values for thrombin time are 12 to 14 seconds. If batroxobin is used, the time should be between 15 and 20 seconds. Thrombin time can be prolonged by heparin, fibrin degradation products, and fibrinogen deficiency or abnormality. Test procedure After separating the plasma from the whole blood by centrifugation, bovine thrombin is added to the sample of plasma. Clot formation is detected optically or mechanically by a coagulation instrument. The time between the addition of the thrombin and the clot formation is recorded as the thrombin clotting time. Specimen requirements Whole blood is taken with either citrate or oxalate additive (if using the vacutainer system, this is a light blue top tube). As with other coagulation assays, the tube must not be over- or under-filled in order to ensure the correct anticoagulant-to-blood ratio: one part anticoagulant per nine parts blood. Reference ranges The reference ranges of the thrombin clotting time is generally <22 seconds, and from 14 to 16 seconds. Laboratories usually calculate their own ranges, based on the method used and the results obtained from healthy individuals from the local population. Separate ranges are used for infants.Practical Haemostasis Limitations Blood samples that are more than eight hours old can give inaccurate results when tested.

These fittings are used in plumbing to manipulate the conveyance of water, gas, or liquid waste in domestic or commercial environments, within a system of pipes or tubes. Fittings (especially uncommon types) require money, time, materials, and tools to install, and are an important part of piping and plumbing systems. Valves are technically fittings, but are usually discussed separately.  Standards  Standard codes are followed when designing (or manufacturing) a piping system. Organizations which promulgate piping standards include: * ASME: American Society of Mechanical Engineers ** A112.19.1 Enameled cast-iron and steel plumbing fixtures standards ** A112.19.2 Ceramic plumbing fixtures standard * ASTM International: American Society for Testing and Materials * API: American Petroleum Institute * AWS: American Welding Society * AWWA: American Water Works Association * MSS: Manufacturers Standardization Society * ANSI: American National Standards Institute * NFPA: National Fire Protection Association * EJMA: Expansion Joint Manufacturers Association * CGA: Compressed Gas Association *PCA: Plumbing Code of Australia Pipes must conform to the dimensional requirements of: * ASME B36.10M: Welded and seamless wrought-steel pipe * ASME B36.19M: Stainless-steel pipe * ASME B31.3 2008: Process piping * ASME B31.4 XXXX: Power piping The B31.3 and B31.4 codes have requirements for piping found in petroleum refineries; chemical, pharmaceutical, textile, paper, semiconductor, and cryogenic plants, and related processing plants and terminals. These codes specify requirements for materials and components, design, fabrication, assembly, erection, examination, inspection and testing of piping. The codes are applicable to piping for all fluids, including raw, intermediate and finished chemicals; petroleum products; gas, steam, air and water; fluidized solids; refrigerants, and cryogenic fluids.  Materials  Display of threaded cast-iron fittings The material with which a pipe is manufactured is often the basis for choosing a pipe. Materials used for manufacturing pipes include: * Carbon (CS) and galvanized steel * Impact-tested carbon steel (ITCS) * Low-temperature carbon steel (LTCS) * Stainless steel (SS) * Malleable iron * Chrome-molybdenum (alloy) steel (generally used for high- temperature service) * Non-ferrous metals (includes copper, inconel, incoloy, and cupronickel) * Non-metallic (includes acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and toughened glass; polybutylene has also been used, but is now banned in North America because of poor reliability) The bodies of fittings for pipe and tubing are most often the same base material as the pipe or tubing connected: copper, steel, PVC, CPVC, or ABS. Any material permitted by the plumbing, health, or building code (as applicable) may be used, but it must be compatible with the other materials in the system, the fluids being transported, and the temperature and pressure inside (and outside) the system. Brass or bronze fittings are common in copper piping and plumbing systems. Fire resistance, earthquake resistance, mechanical ruggedness, theft resistance, and other factors also influence the choice of pipe and fitting materials.  Gaskets  Gaskets are mechanical seals, usually ring-shaped, which seal flange joints. Gaskets vary by construction, materials and features. Commonly used gaskets are non-metallic (ASME B 16.21), spiral-wound (ASME B 16.20) and ring-joint (ASME B 16.20). Non-metallic gaskets are used with flat- or raised-face flanges. Spiral-wound gaskets are used with raised-face flanges, and ring- joint gaskets are used with ring-type joint (RTJ) flanges. Stress develops between an RTJ gasket and the flange groove when the gasket is bolted to a flange, leading to plastic deformation of the gasket.  Gender  Piping or tubing is usually inserted into fittings to make connections. Connectors are assigned a gender, abbreviated M or F. An example of this is a \\"-inch female adapter NPT\\", which would have a corresponding male connection of the same size and thread standard (in this case also NPT). Common piping and plumbing fittings  This section discusses fittings primarily used in pressurized piping systems, though there is some overlap with fittings for low-pressure or non-pressurized systems. Specialized fittings for the latter setups are discussed in the next major subsection.  Adapter  Two threaded adapters for connecting copper pipe (sweat) to a female thread In plumbing, an adapter is generally a fitting which interfaces two dissimilar parts. The term commonly refers to: *any fitting that connects pipes of different materials, including: **expansion adapters which have a flexible section to absorb expansion or contraction from two dissimilar pipe materials **mechanical joint (MJ) adapters for joining polyethylene pipe to another material **bell adapters which are like mechanical joint adapters but contain a stainless steel backup ring to maintain a positive seal against the mating flange **flange adapters which attach to a polyethylene pipe with butt fusion to stiffen a junction and allow another flanged pipe or fitting to be bolted on *a fitting that connects pipes of different diameters, genders, or threads **adapter spools (also called crossover spools), used on oilfields and pressure control, have different diameters, pressure ratings or designs at each end **adapters to convert NPT to BSP pipe threads are available *a fitting that connects threaded and non-threaded pipe  Elbow  Short- radius (or regular) 45¬∞ elbow (copper sweat) Long-radius (or sweep) 90¬∞ elbow (copper sweat) An elbow is installed between two lengths of pipe (or tubing) to allow a change of direction, usually a 90¬∞ or 45¬∞ angle; 22.5¬∞ elbows are also available. The ends may be machined for butt welding, threaded (usually female), or socketed. When the ends differ in size, it is known as a reducing (or reducer) elbow. A 90¬∫ elbow, also known as a \\"90 bend\\", \\"90 ell\\" or \\"quarter bend\\", attaches readily to plastic, copper, cast iron, steel, and lead, and is attached to rubber with stainless-steel worm drive clamps. Other available materials include silicone, rubber compounds, galvanized steel, and nylon. It is primarily used to connect hoses to valves, water pumps and deck drains. A 45¬∞ elbow, also known as a \\"45 bend\\" or \\"45 ell\\", is commonly used in water-supply facilities, food, chemical and electronic industrial pipeline networks, air-conditioning pipelines, agriculture and garden production, and solar-energy facility piping. Elbows are also categorized by length. The radius of curvature of a long-radius (LR) elbow is 1.5 times the pipe diameter, but a short-radius (SR) elbow has a radius equal to the pipe diameter. Short elbows, widely available, are typically used in pressurized systems, and in physically tight locations. Long elbows are used in low- pressure gravity-fed systems and other applications where low turbulence and minimum deposition of entrained solids are of concern. They are available in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS plastic), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC), and copper, and are used in DWV systems, sewage, and central vacuum systems.  Coupling  Pipe coupling (copper sweat) A coupling connects two pipes. If their sizes differ, the fitting is known as a reducing coupling, reducer, or an adapter. There are two types of couplings: \\"regular\\" and \\"slip\\". A regular coupling has a small ridge or stop internally, to prevent over-insertion of a pipe, and thus under- insertion of the other pipe segment (which would result in an unreliable connection). A slip coupling (sometimes also called a repair coupling) is deliberately made without this internal stop, to allow it to be slipped into place in tight locations, such as the repair of a pipe that has a small leak due to corrosion or freeze bursting, or which had to be cut temporarily for some reason. Since the alignment stop is missing, it is up to the installer to carefully measure the final location of the slip coupling to ensure that it is located correctly.  Union  Combination union and reducer (brass threaded) A union also connects two pipes, but is quite different than a coupling, as it allows future disconnection of the pipes for maintenance. In contrast to a coupling requiring solvent welding, soldering, or rotation (for threaded couplings), a union allows easy connection and disconnection, multiple times if needed. It consists of three parts: a nut, a female end and a male end. When the female and male ends are joined, the nut seals the joint by pressing the two ends tightly together. Unions are a type of very compact flange connector. Dielectric unions, with dielectric insulation, separate dissimilar metals (such as copper and galvanized steel) to prevent galvanic corrosion. When two dissimilar metals are in contact with an electrically conductive solution (ordinary tap water is conductive), they form an electrochemical couple which generates a voltage by electrolysis. When the metals are in direct contact with each other, the electric current from one to the other also moves metallic ions from one to the other; this dissolves one metal, depositing it on the other. A dielectric union breaks the electrical path with a plastic liner between its halves, limiting galvanic corrosion. Rotary unions allow mechanical rotation of one of the joined parts, while resisting leakage.  Nipple  Nipple A nipple is a short stub of pipe, usually male-threaded steel, brass, chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC), or copper (occasionally unthreaded copper), which connects two other fittings. A nipple with continuous uninterrupted threading is known as a close nipple. Nipples are commonly used with plumbing and hoses.  Reducer  sweat (at right) reducers A reducer reduces the pipe size from a larger to a smaller bore (inner diameter). Alternatively, reducer may refer to any fitting which causes a change in pipe diameter. This change may be intended to meet hydraulic flow requirements of the system or adapt to existing piping of a different size. The length of the reduction is usually equal to the average of the larger and smaller pipe diameters. Although reducers are usually concentric, eccentric reducers are used as needed to maintain the top- or bottom-of-pipe level. A reducer can also be used either as a nozzle or diffuser, depending on the mach number of the flow.  Double-tapped bushing  A double-tapped bushing is a fitting which serves as a reducer. It is a sleeve similar to a close nipple, but is threaded on both its inner and outer circumferences. Like a reducer, a double-tapped bushing has two threads of different sizes. A double-tapped bushing is more compact than a reducer, but not as flexible. While a double-tapped bushing has a smaller female thread concentric to a larger male thread (and thus couples a smaller male end to a larger female), a reducer may have large and small ends of either gender. If both ends are the same gender, it is a gender-changing reducer. There are similar fittings for both sweat and solvent joinery. Since they are not \\"tapped\\" (threaded), they are simply called reducing bushings.  Tee  Copper sweat tee A tee, the most common pipe fitting, is used to combine or divide fluid flow. It is available with female thread sockets, solvent-weld sockets or opposed solvent-weld sockets and a female-threaded side outlet. Tees can connect pipes of different diameters or change the direction of a pipe run, or both. Available in a variety of materials, sizes and finishes, they may also be used to transport two-fluid mixtures. Tees may be equal or unequal in size of their three connections, with equal tees the most common. Diverter tee This specialized type of tee fitting is used primarily in pressurized hydronic heating systems, to divert a portion of the flow from the main line into a side branch connected to a radiator or heat exchanger. The diverter tee is designed to allow flow to continue in the main line, even when the side branch is shut down and not calling for heat. Diverter tees have directional markings which must be heeded; a tee installed backwards will function very poorly.  Cross  Crosses, also known as four-way fittings or cross branch lines, have one inlet and three outlets (or vice versa), and often have solvent-welded socket or female-threaded ends. Cross fittings may stress pipes as temperatures change, because they are at the center of four connection points. A tee is steadier than a cross; it behaves like a three- legged stool, and a cross behaves like a four-legged stool. Geometrically, any three non-collinear points can self-consistently define a plane; three legs are inherently stable, whereas four points overdetermine a plane, and can be inconsistent, resulting in physical stress on a fitting. Crosses are common in fire sprinkler systems (where stress caused by thermal expansion is not generally an issue), but are not common in plumbing. One cross fitting is more expensive than two tees. Cap  Copper sweat cap Caps, usually liquid- or gas-tight, cover the otherwise open end of a pipe. A cap attaches to the exterior of a pipe, and may have a solvent-weld socket end or a female- threaded interior. The exterior of an industrial cap may be round, square, rectangular, U- or I-shaped, or may have a handgrip. If a solvent-weld cap is used to provide for a future connection point, several inches of pipe must be left before the cap; when the cap is cut off for the future connection, enough pipe must remain to allow a new fitting to be glued onto it. Plug A plug fits inside the pipe segment or fitting.  Barb  These brass PEX fittings are very similar to, but not necessarily interchangeable with hose barbs A barb (or hose barb), which connects flexible hose or tubing to pipes, typically has a male-threaded end which mates with female threads. The other end of the fitting has a single- or multi-barbed tube‚Äîa long tapered cone with ridges, which is inserted into a flexible hose. An adjustable worm drive screw clamp (or other type of clamp) is often added, to keep the hose from slipping off the barbed tube. Barb fittings can be made of brass for hot-water applications, and plastic may be used for cold water; brass is considered more durable for heavy-duty use. The barb fitting may be elbow-shaped or straight. Valve  These compression connections on water shutoff valves under a kitchen sink show evidence of slow seepage (greenish deposits). Valves stop (or regulate) the flow of liquids or gases. They are categorized by application, such as isolation, throttling, and non-return. Isolation valves are used to temporarily disconnect part of a piping system, to allow maintenance or repair, for example. Isolation valves are typically left in either a fully open or fully closed position. A given isolation valve may be in place for many years without being operated, but must be designed to be readily operable whenever needed, including emergency use. Throttling valves are used to control the amount or pressure of a fluid allowed to pass through, and are designed to withstand the stress and wear caused by this type of operation. Because they may wear out in this usage, they are often installed alongside isolation valves which can temporarily disconnect a failing throttling valve from the rest of the system, so it can be refurbished or replaced. Non-return or check valves allow free flow of a fluid in one direction, but prevent its flow in a reverse direction. They are often seen in drainage or sewage systems, but may also be used in pressurized systems. Valves are available in a number of types, based on design and purpose: * Gate, plug, or ball valves ‚Äì Isolation * Globe valve ‚Äì Throttling * Needle valve ‚Äì Throttling, usually with high precision but low flow * Butterfly or diaphragm valves ‚Äì Isolation and throttling * Check valve ‚Äì Preventing reverse flow (non-return)  Drain-waste-vent (DWV) and related fittings  This view looking upwards through a hole in the ceiling shows a traditional leaded hub joint (at top) and a more recent rubber-sleeved hubless connection (at lower right). Because they operate at low pressure and rely on gravity to move fluids (and entrained solids), drain-waste-vent systems use fittings whose interior surfaces are as smooth as possible. The fittings may be \\"belled\\" (expanded slightly in diameter) or otherwise shaped to accommodate the insertion of pipe or tubing without forming a sharp interior ridge that might catch debris or accumulate material, and cause a clog or blockage. Freshly cut ends of pipe segments are carefully deburred to remove projecting slivers of material which may snag debris (such as hair or fibers) which can build up to cause blockages. This internal smoothness also makes it easier to \\"snake out\\" or \\"rod out\\" a clogged pipe with a plumber's snake. Underground piping systems for landscaping drainage or the disposal of stormwater or groundwater also use low-pressure gravity flow, so fittings for these systems resemble larger-scale DWV fittings. With high peak-flow volumes, the design and construction of these systems may resemble those of storm sewers. Fittings for central vacuum systems are similar to DWV fittings, but are usually of thinner and lighter construction because the weight of the materials conveyed is less. Vacuum- system designs share with DWV designs the need to eliminate internal ridges, burrs, sharp turns, or other obstructions which might create clogs.  Slip- joint fitting  Slip-joint fittings are frequently used in kitchen, bathroom and tub drainage systems. They include a detached (movable) slip nut and slip- joint washer; the washer is made of rubber or nylon. An advantage of this type of fitting is that the pipe it is connecting to does not need to be cut to a precise length; the slip joint can attach within a range of the end of the inserting pipe. Many slip fittings may be tightened or loosened by hand, for easier access to residential drainpipe systems (for example, to clean out a trap or access a drain line past a trap).  Sweep elbow  DWV elbows are usually long-radius (\\"sweep\\") types. To reduce flow resistance and solid deposits when the direction of flow is changed, they use a shallow curve with a large radius of curvature. In addition, a well-designed system will often use two 45¬∞ elbows instead of one 90¬∞ elbow (even a sweep 90¬∞ elbow) to reduce flow disruption as much as possible. Central vacuum system inlet fittings are intentionally designed with a tighter radius of curvature than those of other bends in the system. If vacuumed debris becomes stuck it will jam at the inlet, where it is easy to find and remove.  Closet flange  A closet flange (the drainpipe flange to which a flush toilet is attached) is a specialized flange designed to be flush with the floor, allowing a toilet to be installed above it. The flange must be mechanically strong to accommodate slight misalignments or movements, and resist corrosion. Clean-out  Clean-outs are fittings with removable elements, allowing access to drains without the removal of plumbing fixtures. They are used to allow an auger (or plumber's snake) to clean out a plugged drain. Since clean-out augers are limited in length, clean-outs should be placed in accessible locations at regular intervals throughout a drainage system (including outside the building). Minimum requirements are typically at the end of each branch in piping, just ahead of each water closet, at the base of each vertical stack and inside and outside the building in the main drain or sewer. Clean-outs usually have screw-on caps or screw-in plugs. They are also known as \\"rodding eyes\\", because of the eye-shaped cover plates often used on external versions. Trap primer  A trap primer automatically injects water into a trap, maintaining a water seal to keep sewer gas out of buildings. It must be installed in an easily accessible place for adjustment, replacement, and repair. A trap primer, a specialized valve, is usually connected to a clean- water supply in addition to a DWV system. Because of the dual connection, it must be designed to resist the accidental backflow of contaminated water.  Combo tee  A combination tee (combo tee, combo wye, tee-wye, long-sweep wye, or combi) is a tee with a gradually curving central connecting joint: a wye plus an additional 1/8 bend (45¬∞), combined in one 90¬∞ unit. It is used in drains for a smooth, gradually curving path to reduce the likelihood of clogs, to ease the pushing of a plumber's snake through a drain system and to encourage water flow in the direction of the drain.  Sanitary tee  A sanitary tee has a curved center section. In drainage systems, it is primarily used to connect horizontal drains (including fixture trap arms) to vertical drains. The center connection is generally to the pipe leading to a trap (the trap arm). It must not connect a vertical drain to a horizontal drain, because of the likelihood that solids will accumulate at the bottom of the junction and cause a blockage.  Baffle tee  Also called a tee with diverter baffle, a waste tee or an end-outlet tee, it typically connects waste lines before they enter the trap and has a baffle to keep water from one waste pipe from entering the other at the connection.  Double sanitary tee (sanitary cross)  This fitting differs from a standard cross in that two of the ports have curved inlets. Although it has been used in the past for connecting the drains of back-to-back fixtures (such as back-to-back sinks), some current codes‚Äîincluding the 2006 Uniform Plumbing Code in the United States‚Äîprohibit the use of this fitting for that purpose and require a double-fixture fitting (double combination wye) to minimize wastewater from one side flowing into the other.  Wye (Y) or tee-wye (TY)  A fitting with three openings, a wye joins (or creates) branch lines. It is a waste-fitting tee in which the side inlet pipe enters at a 45¬∞ angle. A standard wye is a Y-shaped fitting which allows one pipe to be joined to another at a 45¬∞ angle. A wye may also be used to split a branch line equally in two directions, such as the splitting of a main line into two smaller branches. Tee-wyes are similar to tees, except for the angling of the branch line to reduce friction and turbulence. They are commonly used to attach a vertical drainpipe to a horizontal one, while reducing the deposition of any entrained solids at the junction. The connection is typically at 45¬∞, rather than 90¬∞; if a branch turns out further at the end to 90¬∞ (perpendicular), the fitting becomes a combo tee. Wyes and combo wyes follow a long-sweep pattern relative to sanitary tees and other short-sweep bends, which have a smaller radius and require less space. Wyes also have industrial applications. Although low-priced wyes are often spot- welded, industrial-strength wyes are flash-welded at each seam. In long- distance pipeline applications, a specialized wye is used for allow insertion of pigging to keep pipes clear and maintain flow.  Side inlet tee-wye (TY) This fitting (also known as a \\"bungalow fitting\\" or a \\"cottage fitting\\") is a sanitary tee that allows two trap arms to be connected at the same level. A toilet is the main connection, with the option of a right or left-hand outlet to the 3\\" inlet with a choice of 1-1/2\\" or 2\\" in size. It is used for keeping stack-vented fixtures high to the joist space and thus conserving head room in a basement. As the water closet must be the lowest fixture, the smaller side outlet (usually used to connect the bathtub trap arm) enters slightly above the larger connection.  Hydraulic fittings  Hydraulic systems use high fluid pressure, such as the hydraulic actuators for bulldozers and backhoes. Their hydraulic fittings are designed and rated for much greater pressure than that experienced in general piping systems, and they are generally not compatible with those used in plumbing. Hydraulic fittings are designed and constructed to resist high-pressure leakage and sudden failure.  Connection methods  Much of the work of installing a piping or plumbing system involves making leakproof, reliable connections, and most piping requires mechanical support against gravity and other forces (such as wind loads and earthquakes) which might disrupt an installation. Depending on the connection technology and application, basic skills may be sufficient, or specialized skills and professional licensure may be legally required.  Fasteners and supports  Fasteners join, or affix, two or more objects. Although they are usually used to attach pipe and fittings to mechanical supports in buildings, they do not connect the pipes to each other. Fasteners commonly used with piping are a stud bolt with nuts (usually fully threaded, with two heavy, hexagonal nuts); a machine bolt and nut; or a powder-actuated tool (PAT) fastener (usually a nail or threaded stud, driven into concrete or masonry).  Threaded pipe  Male threaded pipe and female threaded elbow A threaded pipe has a screw thread at one or both ends for assembly. Steel pipe is often joined with threaded connections; tapered threads are cut into the end of the pipe, sealant is applied in the form of thread-sealing compound or thread seal tape (also known as PTFE or Teflon tape) and the pipe is screwed into a threaded fitting with a pipe wrench. Threaded steel pipe is widely used in buildings to convey natural gas or propane fuel, and is also a popular choice in fire sprinkler systems due to its resistance to mechanical damage and high heat (including the threaded joints). Threaded steel pipe may still be used in high-security or exposed locations, because it is more resistant to vandalism, more difficult to remove, and its scrap value is much lower than copper or brass. A galvanized coating of metallic zinc was often used to protect steel water pipes from corrosion, but this protective coating eventually would dissolve away, exposing the iron to deterioration. Pipes used to convey fuel gas are often made of \\"black iron\\", which has been chemically treated to reduce corrosion, but this treatment does not resist erosion from flowing water. Despite its ruggedness, steel pipe is no longer preferred for conveying drinking water, because corrosion can eventually cause leakage (especially at threaded joints), deposits on internal surfaces will eventually restrict flow, and corrosion will shed black or rusty residues into the flowing water. These disadvantages are less problematic for fire sprinkler installations, because standing water in the steel pipes does not flow, except during occasional tests or actual activation by a fire. The introduction of oxygen dissolved in fresh supplies of water will cause some corrosion, but this soon stops in the absence of any source of further water-borne oxygen. In older installations, threaded brass pipe was similarly used, and was considered superior to steel for drinking water, because it was more resistant to corrosion, and shed much less residues into the flowing water. Assembling threaded pipe is labor-intensive, and requires skill and planning to allow lengths of pipe to be screwed together in sequence. Most threaded-pipe systems require the use of strategically located pipe-union fittings in final assembly. Threaded pipe is heavy, and requires adequate attachment to support its weight.  Solvent welding  Polypropylene fittings for solvent welding A solvent is applied to PVC, CPVC, ABS or other plastic piping to partially dissolve and fuse the adjacent surfaces of piping and fitting. Solvent welding is usually used with a sleeve-type joint to connect pipe and fittings made of the same (or compatible) material. Unlike metal welding, solvent welding is relatively easy to perform (although care is needed to make reliable joints). Solvents typically used for plastics are usually toxic and may be carcinogenic and flammable, requiring adequate ventilation.  Soldering  Brass fitting soft-soldered to copper pipe To make a solder connection, a chemical flux is applied to the inner sleeve of a joint and the pipe is inserted. The joint is then heated using a propane or MAPP gas torch, solder is applied to the heated joint and the molten solder is drawn into the joint by capillary action as the flux vaporizes. \\"Sweating\\" is a term sometimes used to describe the soldering of pipe joints. Where many connections must be made in a short period of time (such as plumbing of a new building), soldering is quicker and less expensive joinery than compression or flare fittings. A degree of skill is needed to make a number of reliable soldered joints quickly. If flux residue is thoroughly cleaned, soldering can produce a long-lasting connection at low cost. However, the use of an open flame for heating joints can present fire and health hazards to building occupants, and requires adequate ventilation.  Brazing  Brazing is a thermal joining process in which two pieces of base metal are joined by a molten brazing filler metal which is drawn between them by capillary action. The process can be used to join most metals and alloys commonly used in engineering. A brazing filler metal has a high melting temperature, which is nevertheless lower than the melting point of the metals being joined. Brazing can join pipes, rods, and metal pieces which fit tightly against each other without large gaps; it can even join tungsten carbide, ceramics, and similar non-metallic materials. Well-brazed joints are as strong as their parent-metal pieces and can withstand demanding service. With smooth, neat fillets, they have good electrical conductivity.  Welding  Partially-welded steel pipe joint The welding of metals differs from soldering and brazing in that the joint is made without adding a lower-melting-point material (e.g. solder); instead, the pipe or tubing material is partially melted and the fitting and piping are directly fused. This generally requires that the piping and fitting are the same (or compatible) material. Skill is required to melt the joint sufficiently to ensure good fusion, while not deforming or damaging the pieces being joined. Properly welded joints are considered reliable and durable. Pipe welding is often performed by specially licensed workers whose skills are retested periodically. For critical applications, every joint is tested with nondestructive methods. Because of the skills required, welded pipe joints are usually restricted to high- performance applications such as shipbuilding, and in chemical and nuclear reactors. Adequate ventilation is essential to remove metal fumes from welding operations, and personal protective equipment must be worn. Because the high temperatures during welding can often generate intense ultraviolet light, dark goggles or full face shields must be used to protect the eyes. Precautions must also be taken to avoid starting fires caused by stray sparks and hot welding debris.  Compression fittings  Compression connectors on an isolating valve; the reddish part is a copper compression ring Compression fittings (sometimes called \\"lock-bush fittings\\") consist of a tapered, concave conical seat; a hollow, barrel-shaped compression ring (sometimes called a ferrule); and a compression nut which is threaded onto the body of the fitting and tightened to make a leakproof connection. They are typically made of brass or plastic, but stainless steel or other materials may be used. Although compression connections are less durable than soldered (aka sweated) connections, they are easy to install with simple tools. However, they take longer to install than soldered (aka sweated) joints and sometimes require re- tightening to stop slow leaks which may develop over time. Because of this possible leakage, they are generally restricted to accessible locations (such as under a kitchen or bathroom sink), and are prohibited in concealed locations such as the interiors of walls.  Push-to-pull compression fittings   Flare fittings  Flare connection: 1) Screw thread; 2) O-ring; 3) Body; 4) Nut; 5) Seal interface; 6) Support ring (sleeve), and 7) Flared tubing Flared connectors should not be confused with compression connectors, with which they are generally not interchangeable. Lacking a compression ring, they use a tapered conical shaped connection instead. A specialized flaring tool is used to enlarge tubing into a 45¬∫ tapered bell shape matching the projecting shape of the flare fitting. The flare nut, which had previously been installed over the tubing, is then tightened over the fitting to force the tapered surfaces tightly together. Flare connectors are typically made of brass or plastic, but stainless steel or other materials may be used. Although flare connections are labor-intensive, they are durable and reliable. Considered more secure against leaks and sudden failure, they are used in hydraulic brake systems, and in other high-pressure, high-reliability applications.  Flange fittings  Flange connection with a gasket Flange fittings are generally used for connections to valves, inline instruments or equipment nozzles. Two surfaces are joined tightly together with threaded bolts, wedges, clamps, or other means of applying high compressive force. Although a gasket, packing, or O-ring may be installed between the flanges to prevent leakage, it is sometimes possible to use only a special grease or nothing at all (if the mating surfaces are sufficiently precisely formed). Although flange fittings are bulky, they perform well in demanding applications such as large water supply networks and hydroelectric systems. Flanges are rated at 150, 300, 400, 600, 900, 1500, and 2500 psi; or 10, 15, 25, 40, 64, 100, and 150 bars of pressure. Various types of flanges are available, depending on construction. Flanges used in piping (orifice, threaded, slip-on, blind, weld neck, socket, lap-joint, and reducing) are available with a variety of facings, such as raised, flat, and ring-joint. Slip-on flanges are slipped over the pipe and welded to provide strength and prevent leakage. This flange is less expensive than a weld neck and requires less accuracy when cutting pipe to length. Blind flanges are used to shut off a piping system or opening, while still allowing easy access for inspection. A weld neck flange is joined to a piping system by butt welding. Although its long neck (or hub) makes it expensive, it reduces mechanical stress on piping by distributing stress between the base of the flange and the wall at the weld. Turbulence and erosion are reduced due to the matching size of the pipe and flange. A socket flange appears similar to a slip-on flange, but its bore is counter-bored to accept pipe. A fillet weld around the hub of the flange attaches the flange to the pipe, with an interval weld added in high-stress applications. It is most frequently used in high-pressure systems, such as hydraulic and steam lines. A lap-joint flange is similar to a slip-on, with room at the intersection of the bore and the flange face for a lap stub end. The face of the stub end conforms to the gasket face of the flange. It is used where sections of piping need to be dismantled quickly and easily for inspection or replacement. Flange connections tend to be expensive, because of their requirement for precision forming of metal. Factory-installed flanges must meet carefully measured dimensional specifications, and pipe segments which are cut to length on-site require skilled precision welding to attach flanges under more-difficult field conditions.  Mechanical fittings  Mechanical sleeve clamps Manufacturers such as Victaulic and Grinnell produce sleeve-clamp fittings which are replacing many flange connections. They attach to the end of a pipe segment via circumferential grooves pressed (or cut) around the end of the pipe to be joined. They are widely used on larger steel pipes, and can also be used with other materials. The chief advantage of these connectors is that they can be installed after cutting the pipe to length in the field. This can save time and considerable expense compared to flange connections, which must be factory- or field-welded to pipe segments. However, mechanically fastened joints are sensitive to residual and thickness stresses caused by dissimilar metals and temperature changes. A grooved fitting, also known as a grooved coupling, has four elements: grooved pipe, gasket, coupling housing, and nuts and bolts. The groove is made by cold-forming (or machining) a groove at the end of a pipe. A gasket encompassed by coupling housing is wrapped around the two pipe ends, with the coupling engaging the groove; the bolts and nuts are tightened with a socket or impact wrench. The installed coupling housing encases the gasket and engages the grooves around the pipe to create a leakproof seal in a self-restrained pipe joint. There are two types of grooved coupling; a flexible coupling allows a limited amount of angular movement, and a rigid coupling does not allow movement and may be used where joint immobility is required (similar to a flange or welded joint).  Crimped or pressed fittings  Fittings for crimping Crimped or pressed connections use special fittings which are permanently attached to tubing with a powered crimper. The fittings, manufactured with a pre-installed sealant or O-ring, slide over the tubing to be connected. High pressure is used to deform the fitting and compress the sealant against the inner tubing, creating a leakproof seal. The advantages of this method are durability, speed, neatness, and safety. Some crimped fittings are designed to be used with copper tubing, without requiring flux or filler metal. The connection can be made even when the tubing is wet. Although crimped fittings are suitable for drinking-water pipes and other hot-and-cold systems (including central heating), they are substantially more expensive than sweated fittings. Press fittings with either V and M profile (or contour) in stainless steel, carbon steel, and copper are highly popular in Europe, and several manufacturers such as Viega, Geberit, Swiss Fittings, and ISOTUBI, distribute proprietary systems of press fittings. When compared to other connection types, press fittings have the advantages of installation speed and safety. Pressing a stainless steel fitting can be completed within 5 seconds with the correct equipment. Major pressing of fittings to pipes or other fittings is performed using electrically powered press equipment, but mechanically driven press equipment is also available. Most of the major brands further have a plastic slip on the end of the press fittings allowing a simple identification if a press fitting has securely been installed. Further, the installation does not use any welding; press fittings with appropriate and region specific certification may be installed for gas lines. Stainless steel and carbon steel press fittings can hold up to 16 bars of pressure.  Leaded hub fittings Diagram showing the construction of a typical leaded hub joint Cast iron piping was traditionally made with one \\"spigot\\" end (plain, which was cut to length as needed) and one \\"socket\\" or \\"hub\\" end (cup-shaped). The larger-diameter hub was also called a \\"bell\\" because of its shape. In use, the spigot of one segment was placed into the socket of the preceding one and a ring of oakum was forced down into the joint with a caulking iron. Then the remainder of the space in the hub was filled up. Ideally, this would be done by pouring in molten lead, allowing it to set, and hammering it tightly with a caulking tool. If this was not possible due to position or some other constraint, the joint could alternatively be filled with lead wool or rope, which was forcibly compacted one layer at a time.Damm, John A. and Waugaman, Charles H. (1948) The Practical and Technical Encyclopedia Wm. H. Wise & Co., Inc. New York. pg. 94,395,396 This labor- intensive technique was very durable if done properly, but required time, skill, and patience for each joint to be made up. Quicker and lower-cost methods, such as rubber sleeve joints, have largely replaced leaded hub connections of cast-iron piping in most new installations, but the older technology may still be used for some repairs. In addition, some conservative plumbing codes still require leaded hub joints for final connections where the sewer main leaves a building.  Rubber sleeve fittings  Flexible rubber sleeves are used to connect this cast-iron and copper DWV installation Cast iron DWV pipe and fittings are still used in premium construction because they muffle the sound of wastewater rushing through them, but today they are rarely joined with traditional lead joints. Instead, pipe and fittings with plain (non-belled) connections are butted against each other, and clamped with special rubber sleeve (or \\"no-hub\\") fittings. The rubber sleeves are typically secured with stainless steel worm drive clamping bands, which compress the rubber to make a tight seal around the pipes and fittings. These pipe clamps are similar to hose clamps, but are heavier-duty and ideally are made completely of stainless steel (including the screw) to provide maximum service life. Optionally, the entire rubber sleeve may be jacketed with thin sheet metal, to provide extra stiffness, durability, and resistance to accidental penetration by a misplaced nail or screw. Although the fittings are not cheap, they are reasonably durable (the rubber is typically neoprene or flexible PVC). An alternative design also allows the selective use of belled fittings made entirely of flexible rubber, including more-complex shapes such as wyes or tee-wyes. They are secured to cast iron pipe segments by use of stainless steel worm drive clamps. Because these fittings are not as stiff as traditional cast-iron fittings, the heavy pipe segments may need better anchoring and support to prevent unwanted movement. The lighter rubber fittings may not muffle sound as well as the heavy cast-iron fittings. An advantage of flexible rubber fittings is that they can accommodate small misalignments, and can be flexed slightly for installation in tight locations. A flexible fitting may be preferred to connect a shower or heavy tub to the drainage system without transmitting slight movements or stresses which could eventually cause cracking. Flexible fittings may also be used to reduce transmission of vibration into the DWV system. If necessary, clamped joints can be disassembled later, and the fittings and pipe may be reconfigured. However, it is often not customary to re-use the clamps and rubber sleeves, which may be deformed by their previous installation, and may not seal as well after being rearranged. Clamped fittings may occasionally need to be disassembled to provide access for \\"snaking\\" or \\"rodding-out\\" with a special tool, to clear blockage or clogs. This is also an indication that a clean-out fitting could be installed to provide easier future access.

Antennas Propagation, Vol. AP-34 (March 1986), pp.276-280.  History  In many practical signal processing problems, the objective is to estimate from measurements a set of constant parameters upon which the received signals depend. There have been several approaches to such problems including the so-called maximum likelihood (ML) method of Capon (1969) and Burg's maximum entropy (ME) method. Although often successful and widely used, these methods have certain fundamental limitations (especially bias and sensitivity in parameter estimates), largely because they use an incorrect model (e.g., AR rather than special ARMA) of the measurements. Pisarenko (1973) was one of the first to exploit the structure of the data model, doing so in the context of estimation of parameters of complex sinusoids in additive noise using a covariance approach. Schmidt (1977), while working at Northrop Grumman and independently (1979) were the first to correctly exploit the measurement model in the case of sensor arrays of arbitrary form. Schmidt, in particular, accomplished this by first deriving a complete geometric solution in the absence of noise, then cleverly extending the geometric concepts to obtain a reasonable approximate solution in the presence of noise. The resulting algorithm was called MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification) and has been widely studied. In a detailed evaluation based on thousands of simulations, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory concluded that, among currently accepted high-resolution algorithms, MUSIC was the most promising and a leading candidate for further study and actual hardware implementation. However, although the performance advantages of MUSIC are substantial, they are achieved at a cost in computation (searching over parameter space) and storage (of array calibration data).R. Roy and T. Kailath, \\"ESPRIT-estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques,\\" in IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, vol. 37, no. 7, pp. 984-995, Jul 1989.  Theory  MUSIC method assumes that a signal vector, \\\\mathbf{x}, consists of p complex exponentials, whose frequencies \\\\omega are unknown, in the presence of Gaussian white noise, \\\\mathbf{n}, as given by the linear model : \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\mathbf{s} + \\\\mathbf{n}, where \\\\mathbf{A} = [\\\\mathbf{a}(\\\\omega_1), \\\\cdots, \\\\mathbf{a}(\\\\omega_p)] is an M \\\\times p Vandermonde matrix of steering vectors \\\\mathbf{a}(\\\\omega) = [1, e^{j\\\\omega}, e^{j2\\\\omega}, \\\\ldots, e^{j(M-1)\\\\omega}]^T. The M \\\\times M autocorrelation matrix of \\\\mathbf{x} is then given by :\\\\mathbf{R}_x = \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\mathbf{R}_s \\\\mathbf{A}^H + \\\\sigma^2 \\\\mathbf{I}, where \\\\sigma^2 is the noise variance and \\\\mathbf{R}_s is the autocorrelation of \\\\mathbf{s}. MUSIC estimates the frequency content of the signal or autocorrelation matrix using an eigenspace method. Since \\\\mathbf{R}_x is a Hermitian matrix, all of its M eigenvectors \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{v}_1, \\\\mathbf{v}_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\mathbf{v}_M\\\\\\\\} are orthogonal to each other. If the eigenvalues of \\\\mathbf{R}_x are sorted in decreasing order, the eigenvectors \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{v}_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\mathbf{v}_p\\\\\\\\} corresponding to the p largest eigenvalues (i.e. directions of largest variability) span the signal subspace \\\\mathcal{U}_S. The remaining M-p eigenvectors correspond to eigenvalue equal to \\\\sigma^2 and span the noise subspace \\\\mathcal{U}_N, which is orthogonal to the signal subspace, \\\\mathcal{U}_S \\\\perp \\\\mathcal{U}_N . Note that for M = p + 1, MUSIC is identical to Pisarenko harmonic decomposition. The general idea behind MUSIC method is to use all the eigenvectors that span the noise subspace to improve the performance of the Pisarenko estimator. Since any signal vector \\\\mathbf{e} that resides in the signal subspace \\\\mathbf{e} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}_S must be orthogonal to the noise subspace, \\\\mathbf{e} \\\\perp \\\\mathcal{U}_N, it must be that \\\\mathbf{e} \\\\perp \\\\mathbf{v}_i for all the eigenvectors \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{v}_i \\\\\\\\}_{i=p+1}^M that spans the noise subspace. In order to measure the degree of orthogonality of \\\\mathbf{e} with respect to all the \\\\mathbf{v}_i \\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}_N, the MUSIC algorithm defines a metric :d^2 = \\\\mathbf{e}^H \\\\mathbf{U}_N \\\\mathbf{U}_N^H \\\\mathbf{e} = \\\\sum_{i=p+1}^{M} \\\\mathbf{e}^{H} \\\\mathbf{v}_i^2 where the matrix \\\\mathbf{U}_N = [\\\\mathbf{v}_{p+1}, \\\\ldots, \\\\mathbf{v}_{M}] is the matrix of eigenvalues that span the noise subspace \\\\mathcal{U}_N. If \\\\mathbf{e} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}_S, then d^2 = 0 as implied by the orthogonality condition. Taking a reciprocal of the metric expression creates sharp peaks at the signal frequencies. The frequency estimation function for MUSIC (or the pseudo-spectrum) is :\\\\hat P_{MU}(e^{j \\\\omega}) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathbf{e}^H \\\\mathbf{U}_N \\\\mathbf{U}_N^H \\\\mathbf{e}} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sum_{i=p+1}^{M} \\\\mathbf{e}^{H} \\\\mathbf{v}_i^2}, where \\\\mathbf{v}_i are the noise eigenvectors and :\\\\mathbf{e} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}1 & e^{j \\\\omega} & e^{j 2 \\\\omega} & \\\\cdots & e^{j (M-1) \\\\omega}\\\\end{bmatrix}^T is the candidate steering vector. The locations of the p largest peaks of the estimation function give the frequency estimates for the p signal components : \\\\hat{\\\\omega} = \\\\arg\\\\max_\\\\omega \\\\; \\\\hat P_{MU}(e^{j \\\\omega}). MUSIC is a generalization of Pisarenko's method, and it reduces to Pisarenko's method when M=p+1. In Pisarenko's method, only a single eigenvector is used to form the denominator; and the eigenvector is interpreted as a set of autoregressive coefficients, whose zeros can be found analytically or with polynomial root finding algorithms. In contrast, MUSIC assumes that several such functions have been added together, so zeros may not be present. Instead there are local minima, which can be located by computationally searching the estimation function for peaks. Comparison to other methods MUSIC outperforms simple methods such as picking peaks of DFT spectra in the presence of noise, when the number of components is known in advance, because it exploits knowledge of this number to ignore the noise in its final report. Unlike DFT, it is able to estimate frequencies with accuracy higher than one sample, because its estimation function can be evaluated for any frequency, not just those of DFT bins. This is a form of superresolution. Its chief disadvantage is that it requires the number of components to be known in advance, so the original method cannot be used in more general cases. Methods exist for estimating the number of source components purely from statistical properties of the autocorrelation matrix. See, e.g. Fishler, Eran, and H. Vincent Poor. \\"Estimation of the number of sources in unbalanced arrays via information theoretic criteria.\\" IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing 53.9 (2005): 3543-3553. In addition, MUSIC assumes coexistent sources to be uncorrelated, which limits its practical applications. Recent iterative semi-parametric methods offer robust superresolution despite of highly correlated sources, e.g., SAMV  Other applications  A modified version of MUSIC, denoted as Time-Reversal MUSIC (TR-MUSIC) has been recently applied to computational time-reversal imaging.. MUSIC algorithm has also been implemented for fast detection of the DTMF frequencies (Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling) in the form of C library - libmusic.

This method assumes that a signal, x(n), consists of p complex exponentials in the presence of white noise. Because the number of complex exponentials must be known a priori, it is somewhat limited in its usefulness. Pisarenko's method also assumes that p + 1 values of the M \\\\times M autocorrelation matrix are either known or estimated.

Due to controversial themes, it did not air in the United States. However, it did air in certain countries around the world, including Europe and the Caribbean. Synopsis The series stars the characters Split Kit, Elliot Mess, Terri Cloth, Patty Putty, and Clogged Duane as gross looking kids with abilities to help others. In the first two episodes, they have normal alter-egos, which transform into their \\"Garbage Pail\\" identities; later episodes show them exclusively in their Garbage Pail looks (it is never explained how their Garbage Pail personae became permanent). The show also features parodies of Hollywood famous movies like the Indiana Jones series, Superman, Conan the Barbarian, King Kong, and The Fly.

Controversy The CBS television network directly produced the series, and ordered an entire season, heavily promoting it in the run-up to the 1987‚Äì88 season. However, it was abruptly pulled a few days before its debut, and (just like Little Muppet Monsters) was replaced with an extra half hour of Muppet Babies, which was expanded to 90 minutes in order to fill the time-slot after Garbage Pail Kids was pulled from the schedule. CBS removed the series from their schedule, following protests from Action for Children's Television, the National Coalition on Television Violence, and the Christian Leaders for Responsible Television (a part of the American Family Association). The reasons given were that the series ridiculed the handicapped and glorified violence, along with the common issue eventually rectified by the Children's Television Act that the program was effectively program-length ads for the toys and cards of the Garbage Pail Kids. Some advertisers, such as Nabisco, McDonald's and Crayola also pulled out, either due to pressure from interest groups, or because they were unable to pre-screen the series from advanced tapes. A few CBS affiliates, such as WIBW-TV in Topeka, Kansas; KOTV in Tulsa, Oklahoma and KREM-TV in Spokane, Washington made known they would not carry the series on their stations, notifying CBS of their pre-emptions weeks in advance of the debut. Despite not airing in the United States, the series did air in numerous other countries, including Spain, Italy, Greece, France, Portugal, Germany, United Kingdom, Russia, Hungary, Ukraine, Norway, Czech Republic, Iceland, Finland, Bulgaria, Denmark, Poland, Sweden, Romania, Trinidad & Tobago, the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Israel, United Arab Emirates and Canada.

This continuing trend is also visible in the results of presidential elections; the last Republican to win San Francisco was Dwight Eisenhower in 1956. Although the fight between Democrats and Republicans has been unequal for the last forty years, it has become increasingly lopsided, with conservative commentators frequently attacking the city's politics using the ad hominem phrase, \\"San Francisco values\\". In spite of its heavy liberal leanings, San Francisco has the highest percentage of \\"no party preference\\" voters of any California county, as of November, 2012. Campaign corruption is monitored by the San Francisco Ethics Commission and violations result in fines up to $5,000 per violation.  State and federal representation  In the California State Senate, San Francisco is in . In the California State Assembly, it is split between , and . In the United States House of Representatives, San Francisco is split between two congressional districts. Most of the city is in the 12th District, represented by . A sliver in the southwest is part of the 14th District represented by . Pelosi has been the current House Speaker since January 3, 2019, a post she also held from 2007 through 2011. She has also held the post of House Minority Leader, from 2003 to 2007 and 2011 to 2019.  Local politics  The city is governed by a mayor and an 11-member Board of Supervisors, both elected using preferential voting. The current mayor is London Breed.  Housing  Housing is a frequent topic in San Francisco politics. San Francisco has the highest housing prices in the United States. As of 2018, its median house price was $1.61 million, almost twice the average from five years earlier. Many factors contribute to the housing situation in San Francisco. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of available homes to live in. The Bay Area, from 2011 to 2015, only created 1 home for every 8 jobs created. San Francisco has some of the most stringent housing laws in the United States. It ranks 3rd among cities in the United States as the hardest city to build in. It has been estimated by San Francisco's chief economist that in order for prices in San Francisco to stabilize, the city would need around 100,000 units to reduce prices.

He was the first recipient of the Parama Weera Vibhushanaya, the highest award for gallantry awarded by the Sri Lanka Army for his actions during the Elephant Pass Siege, in which he was killed.  Early life  Gamini Kularatne was the second son of a family of four brothers and a sister. He obtained his primary education at Ranasinghe Premadasa Madhya Maha Vidyalaya at Hasalaka (farming hamlet in the salubrious Kandy District of Sri Lanka). Some claim that he was a survivor of the Aranthalawa Massacre on 2 June 1987 as Mahiyangane Dhammajothi Thero. After seeing the brutality of the Tiger massacre he pleaded with the chief Thero and left robes to join the Sri Lanka Army on 27 August 1987 with the blessings of his father S.G Babanis and mother S.G Juliet.  Death  On the night of 10 July 1991 over 5000 LTTE fighters surrounded the 600 strong army garrison located at Elephant Pass. The base was known as the gateway to the northern Jaffna Peninsula. Enlisted to the Sri Lankan Army Sinha Regiment Sixth Battalion as a Rifleman, Lance Corporal Gamini Kularatne, along with the rest of his regiment, was tasked with watching for possible LTTE infiltrators. As dusk fell the LTTE launched several human wave attacks. Flanked by hundreds of armed fighters, they surrounded the Army's fortifications. As the battle ensued a previously unknown armored bulldozer resembling a tank advanced on the military installation. Equipped with a machine gun and containing a haul of arms and ammunitions inside, the armored bulldozer rumbled towards the southern entrance of the camp. Lance Corporal Kularatne recognized the heavily armored rolling weapon would be able to swarm the garrison within seconds, and inflict heavy casualties. Above all the fall of Elephant Pass to the enemy would be catastrophic and counterproductive at a national level. Although the LTTE began pounding the Army camp with heavy mortars and weapons to the cries of injured and dying soldiers amidst deafening explosions, all eyes were still centered on the enemy's approaching mysterious bulldozer laden with sophisticated weapons. The Memorial to Gamini in Elephant Pass Lance Corporal Kularatne, holding two grenades in his hands, dashed out towards the oncoming bulldozer tank, clambered up the tank's ladder and tossed the two grenades inside it, disregarding the numerous injuries he himself had suffered from LTTE bullets. The grenades disabled the bulldozer amidst bursts of fire accompanied by a series of explosions. Lance Corporal Kularatne was flung to the ground and lay motionless. As the siege of Elephant Pass Army Camp was broken, one of the most ferocious battles in Sri Lanka's modern history ended. The camp had been saved from being overrun by the LTTE in part by Corporal Kularatne's bravery. In recognition of his act of gallantry Lance Corporal Gamini Kularatne was promoted to the rank of Corporal posthumously and honored with the award of \\"Parama Weera Vibhushanaya\\" on 10 October 1991, the highest gallantry award in Sri Lanka for the first time in the history of Sri Lanka Army. Later he came to be known as the Hasalaka Weeraya (Hasalaka Hero)  Memorial  After the war was over, a memorial to Corporal Gamini was later set up in Elephant Pass with the remains of the bulldozer he destroyed. The memorial, as well as the destroyed vehicle, can be seen on the A9 road on the way to Jaffna. A statement made by Dambara Amila Thero in March, 2015 in recommending the removal of this memorial sparked massive public outcry and widespread condemnation. The Sri Lankan Baila singer Dhanapala Udawatta sang \\"Hasalaka Gamini\\", a song tribute to the famous war hero.

The Boston Red Sox foundation and the Esplanade Association in conjunction with the Hill House, an NPO, helped fund the 1.8 million-dollar renewal project. The field reopened on September 5, 2006, to the Hill House youth soccer program. The land includes two baseball/softball diamonds, a youth baseball diamond, a T-ball diamond, or up to five youth soccer fields, or a regulation-sized soccer field in a design that accommodates a variety of other athletic and community uses. Before the renovations, the fields were uneven and often flooded. The fields are named after a young Red Sox fan, Teddy Ebersol, who died in a plane crash on November 28, 2004, in Colorado. Teddy was the son of NBC Sports head Dick Ebersol and Kate & Allie actress Susan Saint James.  Controversy  As of mid-2008, the permitting process was guided by an eight-person advisory committee, with all weekday field use (7 a.m. to 3 p.m.) permitted to Hill House, a Beacon Hill community group. Utilization of the field was low. In 2009, a large metal fence was constructed around the entire park, further preventing casual use. The fence was opposed by community groups including the Esplanade Association, but was requested by private donors and installed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR).

David Kirby (born 1944) is an American poet and the Robert O. Lawton Distinguished Professor of English at Florida State University (FSU). His most recent book is Talking about Movies with Jesus, published in 2011 by LSU Press. His new and selected poetry collection, The House on Boulevard St. (Louisiana State University Press), was nominated for the 2007 National Book Award in poetry. Kirby has published over 20 books, including collections of poetry, and literary criticism, and his poems frequently appear in The Southern Review. His collected earlier poems, up to the transitional Big-Leg Music, have been published as I Think I Am Going to Call My Wife Paraguay. His earliest books of verse, Sarah Bernhardt's Leg (1983) and Saving the Young Men of Vienna (1987, winner of the Brittingham Prize), showed the distinctive mixture of lyricism and wit that can be found in his later work, which began in Big-Leg Music (1995). In that collection, Kirby began presenting what he termed \\"memory poems,\\" freewheeling, associative verse with long lines in shaped stanzas that give play to his interests in high and popular culture, are informed by personal and cultural experiences in the author's life, and present, under the guise of apparent ingenuousness, an array of literary and cultural theories wittily and succinctly stated‚Äîall making what the poet and critic Peter Klappert has termed \\"the Kirby poem.\\" Kirby's later titles in this vein include My Twentieth Century, The House of Blue Light, and The Travelling Library. His volume, The Ha-Ha was chosen one of ten \\"Best Books of 2003\\" by Boston Globe critic Clea Simon,Mike Arnold, New Hampshire Public Radio, 17 December 2003 and was shortlisted for the Griffin Poetry Prize. His work has won numerous awards, including four Pushcart Prizes, the James Dickey Prize, and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Guggenheim Foundation. Kirby obtained his Ph.D. in 1969 from Johns Hopkins University. He lives with his wife and fellow poet Barbara Hamby in Tallahassee, Florida.

Boris Shtokolov was born in the settlement of Kuzedeyevo in Gorno-Shorsky District of Kuznetsk Okrug in Siberian Krai (now in Novokuznetsky District of Kemerovo Oblast). In 1949, he entered the Ural State Conservatory in Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg), but wanted to become a military pilot. Georgy Zhukov, having heard his singing, said: There are many guys like you in aviation, but in opera singing you are unique. In 1950 and 1951, he was singing at the Sverdlovsk Philharmonic Society before he became a soloist at the Sverdlovsk Opera and Ballet Theater. In 1959, he was invited to the Mariinsky Theater in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) where he gained world fame as a leading soloist from 1959 to 1989. At the Mariinsky Theater he sang a great number of roles, such as Ruslan, Don Basilio, Boris Godunov, Ivan Susanin, the title role in Anton Rubinstein's The Demon, Prince Gremin, Mefistofele, and many others.

Background His father, William Eliot Morris Zborowski (1858‚Äì1903) was also a racing driver, and died in a racing crash, in 1903 at La Turbie Hillclimb in Nice, France. His mother was a wealthy American heiress, born Margaret Laura Astor Carey (1853‚Äì1911), a granddaughter of William Backhouse Astor, Sr. and Margaret Rebecca Armstrong of the prominent Astor family. She had been Madame de Stuers before her divorce and marriage in 1892 to Eliot Zborowski. Early life Louis Zborowski as child (Julian Russell Story, 1898) After the death of his father in 1903, in 1910 his mother bought the Higham Park estate at Bridge near Canterbury in Kent. Paying ¬£17,500 to the executors of the estate of London banker William Gay, the sale included a farm, and twelve houses. Mrs. Zborowski immediately commissioned a ¬£50,000 refurbishment of the house from the architect Joseph Sawyer. On her death in 1911, 16-year-old Louis instantly became the fourth richest under-21-year-old in the world, with cash of ¬£11 million and real estate in the United States, including of Manhattan and several blocks on Fifth Avenue, New York. Early racing career Zborowski's career as an amateur racing driver encompassed a wide experience of marques and events. He was an early patron of Aston Martin, and raced for them at Brooklands and in the 1922 French Grand Prix. In 1921 Zborowski was to drive one of the 1921 Grand Prix Sunbeams representing Britain at Le Mans but this did not transpire and instead he raced the car at the International Shelsley Walsh - England‚Äôs foremost Speed Hill-Climb.May, C.A.N. (1945). Shelsley Walsh, England‚Äôs International Speed Hill-Climb. P25, 28 Car designs Zborowski designed and built four of his own racing cars in the stables at Higham Park, assisted by his engineer and co-driver Captain Clive Gallop, who was later racing engineer to the \\"Bentley Boys\\". The first car was powered by a 23,093 cc six-cylinder Maybach aero engine and called \\"Chitty Bang Bang\\". A second \\"Chitty Bang Bang\\" was powered by 18,825 cc Benz aero engine. A third car was based on a Mercedes 28/95, but fitted with a 14,778 cc 6-cylinder Mercedes aero engine and was referred to as the White Mercedes. These cars achieved some success at Brooklands. Another car, also built at Higham Park with a huge 27-litre American Liberty aero engine, was called the \\"Higham Special\\". After Zborowski's death the \\"Higham Special\\" was purchased by J.G. Parry-Thomas to make bids on the land speed record. Designer/driver Thomas improved the car and christened her \\"Babs\\". In April 1926 J.G. Parry- Thomas successfully took the Land Speed Record at over 170 mph at Pendine Sands. Thomas' second attempt at the same location in 1927 turned out fatal. At over 100 mph the car overturned and caught fire, killing the driver. \\"Babs\\" has been restored and can be seen either at the Pendine Sands museum of speed in the summer months or in the Brooklands Museum during other months of the year. In January 1922 Louis, his wife Vi, Clive Gallop and Pixi Marix together with a couple of mechanics took Chitty Bang Bang 2 and the White Mercedes across the Mediterranean for a drive into the Sahara Desert, in the tracks of Citro√´n's K√©gresse-track-equipped expedition. Later career and death In the 1923 Indianapolis 500 Zborowski drove a Bugatti. He drove in the 1923 Italian Grand Prix at Monza in a car designed by American engineer Harry Arminius Miller, the single-seat \\"American Miller 122\\". Zborowski joined the Mercedes team in 1924 but died in one of their cars, after hitting a tree during the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. He was just 29 years old. The grave of Louis Zborowski in the churchyard of St James, Burton Lazars Legacy Zborowski was a railway enthusiast and a gauge railway circuit, the Higham Railway, was built around his estate in Kent. This line was part of the inspiration behind the joint decision by Zborowski and his racing friend Captain J.E.P. Howey to construct a long-distance passenger-carrying railway line in the same gauge. Many locations were investigated, but this eventually led to the founding of the long Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway in Kent, which remains a popular tourist attraction and means of local transport. Zborowski ordered a steam locomotive from Bassett-Lowke, which ran on the Higham Railway in 1924. The locomotive was purchased by the Fairbourne Railway in Wales following the Count's death and named \\"Count Louis\\" in his honour. The locomotive remained at the Fairbourne until 1988. Zborowski also ordered the first locomotives for the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway from Davey Paxman & Co. of Essex. The order (and the project) was continued by Capt Howey alone, following the Count's death. The children's book by Ian Fleming, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and the subsequent musical film, were inspired by the romance of Zborowski's exploits. Fleming had watched Zborowski race at Brooklands as a school boy, and later visited Higham Park (then known as Highland Court) as a friend of its later owner, Walter Whigham the chairman of Robert Fleming & Co. merchant bank founded by Ian's grandfather. In the third book, Zborowski is a major character, where his relationship to Chitty is explored and his future deadly crash is alluded to.

It was reopened in 1976 as a heritage line. The locomotive workshops here are the headquarters of the Diesel and Electric Preservation Group (DEPG). History A train from Bishops Lydeard exchanges tokens by the signal box which was built in 1874 and is still in use The station opened on 31 March 1862 when the West Somerset Railway started operations between Norton Junction and . A virtual copy of , it consisted of a single platform on the down-side (left) of trains travelling towards Watchet. With the extension of the West Somerset Railway from to , a loop became necessary at a mid-way point on the line. Hence in 1874 a second broad gauge track and associated platform was opened, allowing trains to pass within the station. To enable this, a new road bridge was built at the south end of the station before the loop was opened, but the level crossing next to the platform was left in place. The railway was operated from its opening by the Bristol and Exeter Railway, which became a part of the Great Western Railway in 1876. The West Somerset Railway remained an independent company until 1922, when it too was absorbed by the Great Western. In 1907, and again in 1937, the passing loop was extended to allow longer summer through-trains on their way to to pass at Williton. In 1948, the line became a part of the Western Region of British Railways as a result of nationalisation in 1948, after which in the 1960s the loop line was shortened back towards the original level crossing point. The station closed on 4 January 1971. On 28 August 1976, a new West Somerset Railway reopened the station. It was the terminus of the line from until 7 May 1978 when the line was extended to . The goods shed and yard have since been adapted for restoring and repairing locomotives and carriages. Description The topiary box hedge garden, which is over 100 years old The main station building is on the northbound platform, being typical of a Bristol and Exeter Railway stations of the 1860s complete with an Italianate chimney, and next door is a matching small cafe. To the south is the signal box which dates from 1875, the only Bristol and Exeter Railway one still in use, it still operates the signals and overlooks the level crossing at the south end of the station. Beyond this is a small store which dates from 1862, and the road bridge. On the north side of the station building is the goods shed, now used as a diesel heritage visitor centre, and the locomotive workshops. The opposite platform was built in 1874 (the original broad gauge loading gauge still reflected in the platform's spacing), and has always been the site of a wooden waiting room. Behind this platform is a box hedge garden which is over 100 years old. The original B&ER; footbridge was installed towards the south end of the station close to the signal box, but was removed by British Railways in the 1960s, when they shortened the passing loop. A new original GWR footbridge that had previously been in use at Trowbridge railway station, was brought into use on the north side of the main station building on 16 July 2011, so that people can cross to the second platform without having to cross the tracks on the level crossing. The newspaper kiosk, plate layers hut, signal box, waiting room and east platform and booking office are listed buildings. Railway workshops The workshop moved from Swindon The station is a major site for the WSR's workshops. The former goods shed was converted for use by the DEPG as a locomotive workshop; this has since been supplemented by a purpose-built workshop nearby. At the far end of the station yard is a pre- fabricated building that is used for steam locomotive and coach overhauls by the West Somerset Railway Association, the volunteer supporters of the West Somerset Railway; it was originally erected at Swindon Works in 1899 and is Grade II listed and was donated by Tarmac Ltd following the closure of the works. Services Trains run between and at weekends and on some other days from March to October, daily during the late spring and summer, and on certain days during the winter.

A three-year pilot program for uniforms was proposed by Central Elementary principal Lee McFerren in order to \\"blur socioeconomic distinctions and improve discipline and the learning environment\\". The policy required solid shirts of any color and black, khaki and navy pants with no more than four pockets. The program went into effect in 2005-06 at Central and across the remaining schools during the following year. During a regular board meeting on July 14, 2008, the board passed a vote that all-but-ended the near-uniform dress code that had existed for elementary students since the 2005-2006 school year. Logos, writing and pictures - including on crew neck shirts are permitted under the revised policy.The Derrick Central Elementary Located at 1276 Otter St, Franklin, PA 16323.

Report Card 2010  2006-07 Achievement  The Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA) \\"is a standards-based criterion-referenced assessment used to measure a student's attainment of the academic standards while also determining the degree to which school programs enable a student to attain proficiency of the standards\\".PSSA home The test is given annually to every Pennsylvania student in grades 3-8 and grade 11. All students are tested in math and reading, while students in grades 5,8, and 11 are also assessed in writing. For the 2006-2007 academic year, Franklin Area School District district wide results were: Number Math scored: 1,128 (930,999) Math Advanced: 36.1% (38.2%) Math Proficient: 34.3% (31.0%) Math Basic: 14.8% (15.4%) Math Below Basic: 14.8% (15.4%) Number Reading scored: 1,128 (929,484) Reading Advanced: 29.8% (31.2%) Reading Proficient: 37.9% (36.4%) Reading Basic: 14.9% (16.0%) Reading Below Basic: 17.4% (16.4%)PSSA District ResultsPSAA Pennsylvania state-wide Results Summer school The district offers an extensive summer school program for students in first grade through 12th grade. Special education In December 2009, the district administration reported that 582 pupils or 27.5% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In accordance with state and federal law, the District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students in order to increase state funding has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. Franklin Area School District received a $1,435,204 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. Gifted education The District Administration reported that 117 or 5.58% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum by the classroom teacher. This approach permits such specialized instructional strategies as tiered assignments, curriculum compacting, flexible grouping, learning stations, independent projects and independent contracts. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to honors and advanced placement courses, and dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Bullying and school safety The Franklin Area School District administration reported there were 5 incidents of bullying in the district in 2010. The Franklin Area School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti- bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Budget In 2009, the district reports employing over 190 teachers with a starting salary of $40,000 for 180 days of pupil instruction. The average teacher salary was $52,248 while the maximum salary is $102,275. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked in the top 10 states in average teacher salaries.

According to the association's report, the average salary for a superintendent, for the 2007-08 school year, was $122,165. Superintendents and administrators receive a benefit package commensurate with that offered to the district's teachers' union. In 2008, Franklin Area School District reported spending $13,362 per pupil. This ranked 145th in the commonwealth. In 2010, the district's per pupil spending had increased to $14,524.97, which ranked 149th statewide. Among the states, Pennsylvania's total per pupil revenue (including all sources) ranked 11th at $15,023 per student, in 2008-09. In 2007, the Pennsylvania per pupil total expenditures was $12,759. In May 2011, the school board adopted a 2011-2012 Proposed Final General Operating Budget for the 2011-2012 school year. It anticipated revenues of $30,563,914 and expenditures of $31,672,356 to include an approximate fund balance draw down of $1,108,442. ; Reserves In 2009, Franklin Area School District reported $4,788,676 in an unreserved-undesignated fund balance. The designated fund balance was reported as $1,370,311. In 2010, Franklin Area School District reported $1,415,523. in its unreserved-undesignated fund. The designated fund balance was reported as $2,357,623. Pennsylvania school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending, in the undesignated reserve funds, to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds. In January 2011, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. Serious findings were reported to the administration and school board. The audit noted that the administration had failure to apply for Alternative Education Funding. The district is funded by a combination of: a local income tax, a property tax, a statewide real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax regardless of the individual's wealth. State basic education funding In 2011-12, the district received a $11,067,679 allocation, of State Basic Education Funding. Additionally, Franklin Area School District received $162,272 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state education budget includes $5,354,629,000 for the 2011-2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation. This amount is a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted State appropriation for 2010-2011. The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011-12. In 2010, the district reported that 1,016 students received free or reduced-price lunches, due to the family meeting the federal poverty level.Pennsylvania Department of Education, District Allocations Report 2010, 2010-11 For the 2010-11 school year, the Franklin Area School District received a 2.41% increase in state Basic Education Funding resulting in a $12,063,578 payment.

Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County received the highest increase in the state at 23.65% increase in funding for the 2010-11 school year. One hundred fifty school districts received the base 2% increase in 2010-11. The amount of increase each school district receives was determined by then Governor Edward G. Rendell and Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak through the allocations set in the state education budget proposal. In the 2009-2010 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 6.43% increase in Basic Education funding for a total of $11,779,552.

According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 889 district students received free or reduced-price lunches due to low family income, in the 2007-2008 school year.Pennsylvania Department of Education Funding Report by LEA 2009 =Accountability Block Grants= Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, Franklin Area School District applied for and received $440,446 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district used the funding to provide all-day kindergarten for the 7th year. =Classrooms for the Future grant= The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Franklin Area School District was denied funding for 2006-07 by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The Administration did not apply for funding in the subsequent two years funding was available. Of the 501 public school districts in Pennsylvania, 447 of them received Classrooms for the Future state grant awards. =Education Assistance grant= The state's EAP funding provides for the continuing support of tutoring services and other programs to address the academic needs of eligible students. Funds are available to eligible school districts and full-time career and technology centers (CTC) in which one or more schools have failed to meet at least one academic performance target, as provided for in Section 1512-C of the Pennsylvania Public School Code. In 2010-11, Franklin Area School District received $82,314. Federal Stimulus grant The district received an extra $3,117,278 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010-11 school years. . Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly warned to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs in buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. =Race to the Top grant= Franklin Area School District officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district over one million additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. Common Cents state initiative The Franklin Area School Board chose to not permit the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program access to the district records. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. Real estate taxes The Franklin Area School Board increased the property tax rates for 2011-2012 to 17.3400 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections (Local Tax Enabling Act), which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. *2010-11 - 17.0000 mills *2009-10 - 17.0000 mills. *2008-09 - 17.0000 mills. *2007-08 - 17.0000 mills. =Act 1 Adjusted index= The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not authorized to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or the school board seeks one or more exceptions from the state's Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines. The School District Adjusted Index for the Franklin Area School District 2006-2007 through 2010-2011. * 2006-07 - 5.6%, Base 3.9% * 2007-08 - 4.9%, Base 3.4% * 2008-09 - 6.3%, Base 4.4% * 2009-10 - 5.9%, Base 4.1% * 2010-11 - 4.2%, Base 2.9% * 2011-12 - 2.0%, Base 1.4% * 2012-13 - 2.4%, Base 1.7% For the 2011-12 school year, Franklin Area School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, Franklin Area School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. Franklin Area School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budgets in 2009-10 or in 2010-11. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. =Property tax relief= In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Franklin Area School District was $221 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 4,220 property owners applied for the tax relief. The tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property on the individual's tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. The Pennsylvania Auditor General found that 73% of property owners applied for tax relief in Venango County. In Venango County, the highest property tax relief in 2009 was $274 awarded to the approved property owners in Oil City Area School District. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $632 per homestead and farmstead in 2010. This was the second year Chester Upland School District was the top recipient. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially more than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).

Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Stanton graduated from Holy Name High School in 1949 and then served in the United States Air Force from 1950 to 1954, during the Korean War. He earned an A.B. from the University of Dayton in 1958, and a J.D. from the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law in 1961. He became a member of the Ohio bar association that year, and went into private practice. Stanton served as a member of the Cleveland city council from 1959 to 1970, serving as president from 1964 to 1970. He was then elected as a Democrat to the 92nd and to the two succeeding Congresses (January 3, 1971 ‚Äì January 3, 1977). In his last Congress, he was instrumental in getting House Doorkeeper William \\"Fishbait\\" Miller defeated by the House Caucus and installed his friend and prot√©g√© James Molloy in Miller's place. Molloy kept the office until it was abolished in 1995. Stanton was not a candidate for reelection to the House of Representatives in 1976, but was an unsuccessful candidate for nomination to the United States Senate. He supported the man who bested him in the primary, Howard Metzenbaum. Though he had been instrumental in that body in a few years, he tired of the slow progress a member encountered in gaining stature in such a body. After his political career, Stanton resumed the practice of law in Washington, D.C. from 1977 to 1981. He served as executive vice president of Delaware North Companies in Buffalo, New York, from 1981 to 1988. He went on to earn an A.M.P. from Harvard University Business School in 1984.

History It was created by Victor Beigel in 1921 as the Gervase Elwes Memorial Fund, following the death of English tenor Gervase Elwes. It was renamed as the Musicians Benevolent Fund in 1926 and became a registered charity. Until his death in 1934, Edward Elgar was the fund's president. During World War II the fund was supported by proceeds from daily concerts in the National Gallery, London, organized by Myra Hess. Purpose It supports working musicians who are dealing with an illness, injury or accident. It gives financial grants to pay for medical treatment, specialist therapies and living costs and provides one-on-one help to those with life-changing situations. It also provides regular payments and social visits to retired musicians. Help Musicians UK also supports emerging and graduate musicians. The programme offers funding awards to postgraduate musicians undertaking advanced training and also helps with short-term treatment costs for music students experiencing health problems. Amongst the awards they offer, they administer the Peter Whittingham Jazz Award (started in 1989), a ¬£5,000 award for an emerging jazz musician or group to undertake a creative project of their choice that will support their professional development. An annual concert in support of the fund is given in London on or near St. Cecilia's Day. In 2014 the charity spent ¬£3.3 million in support of more than 5000 musicians.

He played for a number of Danish clubs, as well as Fortuna D√ºsseldorf in Germany and English clubs Grimsby Town, Wimbledon and Norwich City. His greatest triumph was the 1997 Danish Cup victory, which he won with Danish club F.C. Copenhagen. He played 46 matches and scored 33 goals for various Danish youth national teams between 1992 and 1997, including eight games and three goals for the Denmark national under-21 football team. Nielsen has attracted controversy at various times in his career for falling into serious gambling debt, assaulting a teammate and then, in November 2008, admitting matchfixing in a Danish game played in 2004. Biography Playing career Born in Skagen, Nielsen started playing youth football in Skagen IK and Frederikshavn fI. He scored 17 goals in 24 matches for the Danish under-16 and under-17 national teams. He received offers from English club Tottenham Hotspur and Bayern Munich in Germany, but decided to stay in Denmark, as he was brought to OB in the top- flight Danish Superliga in May 1993, 16 years old. Here he became known for his elaborate goal celebration, a round off stretch jump with a backtuck. He was loaned out to Lyngby FC in January 1996, where he got his national breakthrough with 10 goals in 13 league games. When his Odense contract ran out in the Summer 1996, he moved abroad to play for Fortuna D√ºsseldorf in the Bundesliga championship. He did not find playing success with the club, and after half a year in Germany, Nielsen moved back to Denmark to play for F.C. Copenhagen in a DEM 600,000 transfer deal in February 1997. He played three and a half years at F.C. Copenhagen, with whom he won the 1997 Danish Cup. He was club top goalscorer in 1998, 1999 and 2000, and was elected 1999 F.C. Copenhagen Player of the Year. He was loaned out to English club Grimsby Town in the second tier of English football, the English First Division in October 2000, as Grimsby had a hard time scoring goals. When his loan deal ended in March 2001, Nielsen moved on to English club Wimbledon F.C. on a free transfer. He joined Norwich City F.C. on loan in December 2001, and scored five goals in five games during his loan spell, including one against his parent club, prompting Norwich manager Nigel Worthington to pay ¬£210,000 to Wimbledon to secure his services on a permanent basis. Whilst playing for Norwich City he was a member of the team that reached the final of the First Division play-offs in May 2002. However, he was unable to maintain his initial impressive scoring rate and left the club at his own request to return to Denmark in August 2003. He signed with Superliga club Aalborg BK (AaB), where he rediscovered his goalscoring ability. Following a training ground bust-up with teammate Allan Gaarde in February 2005, David Nielsen was fired by the club. Within days, he was hired by league rivals FC Midtjylland, to replace Egyptian striker Mohamed Zidan. He was let go by FCM in May 2006, and he moved abroad to play for Norwegian club IK Start. He became an immediate hit scoring seven goals in 21 matches, but left the club during the reign of manager Stig Inge Bj√∏rnebye. On 20 July 2007, he signed a three-year contract with the Danish Superliga side OB. On 26 March he went on a loan deal with the Norwegian club Str√∏msgodset Toppfotball, for the rest of 2008. Nielsen was sold to the Norwegian club Brann as a part of a deal were Njougu Demba Nyren went in the opposite direction in January 2009. During his stay in Brann, Nielsen has spent most of his time as a substitute and when he has been playing he has had the role as a facilitator for the other striker Erik Huseklepp. After his contract with Brann expired in June 2010 Nielsen planned to stay in Bergen and together with Per Ove Ludvigsen and Kjetil Knutsen offer organized soccer practice for kids through a company called Max Fotball. Controversies By April 2004, David Nielsen and fellow AaB teammate Jimmy Nielsen had raked up a debt of ‚Ç¨201,000 with bookmakers in Aalborg. AaB director Lynge Jacobsen decided to help out financially and arranged for gambling addiction counselling. In his 2008 autobiography, Nielsen admitted playing to deliberately lose a Superliga match between AaB and his former club F.C. Copenhagen in May 2004. As AaB had lost the Danish Cup final to F.C. Copenhagen earlier that year, winning the Superliga would propel F.C. Copenhagen into the UEFA Champions League and hand their UEFA Cup-berth as the Danish Cup winners on to the losing finalists from AaB. Nielsen was also motivated by his gambling debts,\\"David Nielsen har ikke betalt sin g√¶ld\\" Nordjyske.dk. 26 May 2004 as UEFA Cup qualification would wield him a personal DKK300,000 bonus. AaB and F.C. Copenhagen drew the match, and F.C. Copenhagen eventually won the 2003‚Äì04 Superliga championship by one point. In February 2005, Nielsen was sacked by AaB when he physically attacked teammate Allan Gaarde during a training session, leaving him with a concussion. Nielsen later explained in his autobiography that Gaarde was \\"pretentious... talking loudly about wine in Italian. \\"I told him: 'The next time you speak Italian I will break you in half. You're not f***ing Italian ‚Äì you spent eight months there.' So when he did it again I decided to break his shitting legs like sticks. I jumped at him and bang. Jackpot. Felt good.\\" During the pre-season of 2010‚Äì11, in a friendly against English side Leeds United, he made a 'shocking high- footed' tackle against winger Robert Snodgrass, who was injured and missed the start of the campaign. Managing career Nielsen was appointed assistant manager of L√∏v-Ham on 27 May 2011. Later that summer, he was appointed manager of Nest-Sotra. After saving the club from relegation from the 2. Divisjon in 2011, he led them to a 4th place in 2012 and promotion to the 1. division in 2013. On 11 November 2013, he was appointed assistant manager of Str√∏msgodset. After just seven months, he was appointed manager, when Ronny Deila left for the vacant managing position at Celtic. On 26 May 2015 Str√∏msgodset announced that David Nielsen would step down as manager in mutual agreement with the club. On 17 June 2015 he signed a three-year-contract as manager for Danish 1st Division club Lyngby Boldklub. On 30 September 2017 he signed a three- year- contract as coach for Danish Superliga team AGF Aarhus. Personal life David Nielsen was born in Denmark to a DR Congolese father, and a Danish mother.

World Englishes is a term for emerging localized or indigenized varieties of English, especially varieties that have developed in territories influenced by the United Kingdom or the United States. The study of World Englishes consists of identifying varieties of English used in diverse sociolinguistic contexts globally and analyzing how sociolinguistic histories, multicultural backgrounds and contexts of function influence the use of English in different regions of the world. The issue of World Englishes was first raised in 1978 to examine concepts of regional Englishes globally. Pragmatic factors such as appropriateness, comprehensibility and interpretability justified the use of English as an international and intra- national language. In 1988, at a Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) conference in Honolulu, Hawaii, the International Committee of the Study of World Englishes (ICWE) was formed. In 1992, the ICWE formally launched the International Association for World Englishes (IAWE) at a conference of \\"World Englishes Today\\", at the University of Illinois, USA.International Association of World Englishes , Retrieved on 18 November 2010. There is now an academic journal devoted to the study of this topic, titled World Englishes. Currently, there are approximately 75 territories where English is spoken either as a first language (L1) or as an unofficial or institutionalized second language (L2) in fields such as government, law and education. It is difficult to establish the total number of Englishes in the world, as new varieties of English are constantly being developed and discovered.Crystal, D. (2007). English as a Global Language. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press World English vs. World Englishes vs. Global Englishes The notions of World English and World Englishes are far from similar, although the terms are often mistakenly used interchangeably. World English refers to the English language as a lingua franca used in business, trade, diplomacy and other spheres of global activity, while World Englishes refers to the different varieties of English and English-based creoles developed in different regions of the world. Alternatively, the term Global Englishes has been used by scholars in the field to emphasise the more recent spread of English due to globalization, which has resulted in increased usage of English as a lingua franca.Galloway, N. & Rose, H. (2015). Introducing Global Englishes. Arbingdon, UK: Routledge Historical context History of English English is a West Germanic language that originated from the Anglo-Frisian dialects brought by Germanic invaders into Britain. Initially, Old English was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England. Eventually, one of these dialects, Late West Saxon, came to dominate.Baugh, A. C. and Cable. T. (1993). A History of the English Language. Routledge. The original Old English was then influenced by two further waves of invasion: the first by speakers of the Scandinavian branch of the Germanic language family, who conquered and colonized parts of Britain in the 8th and 9th centuries; the second by the Normans in the 11th century, who spoke Old Norman and ultimately developed a Norman variety called Anglo-Norman. For two centuries after the Norman Conquest, French became the language of everyday life among the upper classes in England. Although the language of the masses remained English, the bilingual character of England in this period was thus formed. During the Middle English period, France and England experienced a process of separation. This period of conflicting interests and feelings of resentment was later termed the Hundred Years' War. By the beginning of the 14th century, English had regained universal use and become the principal tongue of all England, but not without having undergone significant change. During the Renaissance, patriotic feelings regarding English brought about the recognition of English as the national language of England. The language was advocated as acceptable for learned and literary use. With the Great Vowel Shift, the language in this period matured to a standard and differed significantly from the Middle English period, becoming recognizably \\"modern\\".Stockwell, R. (2002). \\"How much shifting actually occurred in the historical English vowel shift?\\", Minkova, Donka; Stockwell, Robert. Studies in the History of the English Language: A Millennial Perspective. Mouton de Gruyter. By the 18th century, three main forces were driving the direction of the English language: (1) to reduce the language to rule and effect a standard of correct usage; (2) to refine the language by removing supposed defects and introducing certain improvements; and (3) to fix English permanently in the desired form. This desire for system and regularity in the language contrasted with the individualism and spirit of independence characterized by the previous age. By the 19th century, the expansion of the British Empire, as well as global trade, had led to the spread of English around the world. The rising importance of some of England's larger colonies and former colonies, such as the rapidly developing United States, enhanced the value of the English varieties spoken in these regions, encouraging the belief, among the local populations, that their distinct varieties of English should be granted equal standing with the standard of Great Britain. Global spread of English =First dispersal: English is transported to the 'new world'= The first diaspora involved relatively large-scale migrations of mother-tongue English speakers from England, Scotland and Ireland predominantly to North America and the Caribbean, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Over time, their own English dialects developed into modern American, Canadian, West Indian, South African, Australian, and New Zealand Englishes. In contrast to the English of Great Britain, the varieties spoken in modern North America and Caribbean, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand have been modified in response to the changed and changing sociolinguistic contexts of the migrants, for example being in contact with indigenous Native American, Khoisan and Bantu, Aboriginal or Maori populations in the colonies.Jenkins, Jennifer. (2003). World Englishes: A Resource Book for Students. London and New York: Routledge. =Second dispersal: English is transported to Asia and Africa= The second diaspora was the result of the colonization of Asia and Africa, which led to the development of 'New Englishes', the second-language varieties of English. In colonial Africa, the history of English is distinct between West and East Africa. English in West Africa began with trade. particularly the slave trade. English soon gained official status in what are today Gambia, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon, and some of the pidgin and creoles which developed from English contact, including Krio (Sierra Leone) and Cameroon Pidgin, have large numbers of speakers now. As for East Africa, extensive British settlements were established in what are now Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe, where English became a crucial language of the government, education and the law. From the early 1960s, the six countries achieved independence in succession; but English remained the official language and had large numbers of second language speakers in Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi (along with Chewa). English was formally introduced to the sub-continent of South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan) during the second half of the eighteenth century. In India, English was given status through the implementation of Macaulay 'Minute' of 1835, which proposed the introduction of an English educational system in India. Over time, the process of 'Indianisation' led to the development of a distinctive national character of English in the Indian sub-continent. British influence in South-East Asia and the South Pacific began in the late eighteenth century, involving primarily the territories now known as Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong. Papua New Guinea, also a British protectorate, exemplified the English-based pidgin - Tok Pisin. The Americans came late in South-East Asia but their influence spread like wildfire as their reforms on education in the Philippines progressed in their less than half a century colonization of the islands. English has been taught since the American period and is one of the official languages of the Philippines. Ever since English became the official language, a localized variety gradually emerged - Philippine English. Lately, linguist Wilkinson Daniel Wong Gonzales argued that this variety has in itself more varieties, suggesting that we move towards Philippine Englishes paradigm to progress further in Schneider's dynamic model after gathering evidences of such happening. Nowadays, English is also learnt in other countries in neighbouring areas, most notably in Taiwan, Japan and Korea, with the latter two having begun to consider the possibility of making English their official second language. Classification of Englishes The spread of English around the world is often discussed in terms of three distinct groups of users, where English is used respectively as: # a native language (ENL); the primary language of the majority population of a country, such as in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. # a second language (ESL); an additional language for intranational as well as international communication in communities that are multilingual, such as in India, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Singapore. Most of these Englishes developed as a result of imperial expansion that brought the language to various parts of the world. # a foreign language (EFL); used almost exclusively for international communication, such as in Japan. Kachru's Three Circles of English Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English. The most influential model of the spread of English is Braj Kachru's model of World Englishes. In this model the diffusion of English is captured in terms of three Concentric Circles of the language: The Inner Circle, the Outer Circle, and the Expanding Circle.Kachru, B. (1992). The Other Tongue: English across cultures. University of Illinois Press. The Inner Circle refers to English as it originally took shape and was spread across the world in the first diaspora. In this transplantation of English, speakers from England carried the language to Australia, New Zealand and North America. The Inner Circle thus represents the traditional historical and sociolinguistic bases of English in regions where it is now used as a primary language: the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, anglophone Canada and South Africa, and some of the Caribbean territories. English is the native language or mother tongue of most people in these countries. The total number of English speakers in the inner circle is as high as 380 million, of whom some 120 million are outside the United States. The Outer Circle of English was produced by the second diaspora of English, which spread the language through imperial expansion by Great Britain in Asia and Africa. In these regions, English is not the native tongue, but serves as a useful lingua franca between ethnic and language groups. Higher education, the legislature and judiciary, national commerce and so on may all be carried out predominantly in English. This circle includes India, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Malaysia, Tanzania, Kenya, non-Anglophone South Africa, the Philippines (colonized by the US) and others. The total number of English speakers in the outer circle is estimated to range from 150 million to 300 million.Kachru, Y. (2006). World Englishes in Asian Contexts. (Larry E. Smith Eds.) Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press Singapore, while in the Outer Circle, may be drifting into the Inner Circle as English becomes more often used as a home language (see Languages of Singapore), much as Ireland did earlier. Countries where most people speak an English-based creole and retain standard English for official purposes, such as Jamaica and Papua New Guinea, are also in the Outer Circle. Finally, the Expanding Circle encompasses countries where English plays no historical or governmental role, but where it is nevertheless widely used as a medium of international communication. This includes much of the rest of the world's population not categorized above, including territories such as China, Nepal, Russia, Japan, non-Anglophone Europe (especially the Netherlands and Nordic countries), South Korea, and Egypt. The total in this expanding circle is the most difficult to estimate, especially because English may be employed for specific, limited purposes, usually in a business context. The estimates of these users range from 100 million to one billion. The inner circle (UK, US etc.) is 'norm-providing'; that means that English language norms are developed in these countries. The outer circle (mainly New Commonwealth countries) is 'norm-developing'. The expanding circle (which includes much of the rest of the world) is 'norm- dependent', because it relies on the standards set by native speakers in the inner circle.Kachru, B. (1992). World Englishes: approaches, issues and resources. Language Teaching, 25: 1-14. Cambridge UP. Schneider's Dynamic Model of Postcolonial Englishes Edgar Werner Schneider tries to avoid a purely geographical and historical approach evident in the 'circles' models and incorporates sociolinguistic concepts pertaining to acts of identity.Le Page, R. B. and Tabouret-Keller, A. (1985). Acts of identity: Creole-based approaches to language and ethnicity. New York: Cambridge University Press. He outlines five characteristic stages in the spread of English: Phase 1 ‚Äì Foundation: This is the initial stage of the introduction of English to a new territory over an extended period of time. Two linguistic processes are operative at this stage: (a) language contact between English and indigenous languages; (b) contact between different dialects of English of the settlers which eventually results in a new stable dialect (see koin√©). At this stage, bilingualism is marginal. A few members of the local populace may play an important role as interpreters, translators and guides. Borrowings are limited to lexical items; with local place names and terms for local fauna and flora being adopted by the English.Schneider, E. W. (2007). Postcolonial English: Varieties around the world. Cambridge University Press. Phase 2 ‚Äì Exonormative stabilization: At this stage, the settler communities tend to stabilize politically under British rule. English increases in prominence and though the colloquial English is a colonial koin√©, the speakers look to England for their formal norms. Local vocabulary continues to be adopted. Bilingualism increases amongst the indigenous population through education and increased contacts with English settlers. Knowledge of English becomes an asset, and a new indigenous elite develops. Phase 3 ‚Äì Nativisation: According to Schneider, this is the stage at which a transition occurs as the English settler population starts to accept a new identity based on present and local realities, rather than sole allegiance to their 'mother country'. By this time, the indigenous strand has also stabilized an L2 system that is a synthesis of substrate effects, interlanguage processes and features adopted from the settlers' koin√© English. Neologisms stabilize as English is made to adapt to local sociopolitical and cultural practices. Phase 4 ‚Äì Endonormative stabilization: This stage is characterized by the gradual acceptance of local norms, supported by a new locally rooted linguistic self-confidence. By this time political events have made it clear that the settler and indigenous strands are inextricably bound in a sense of nationhood independent of Britain. Acceptance of local English(es) expresses this new identity. National dictionaries are enthusiastically supported, at least for new lexis (and not always for localized grammar). Literary creativity in local English begins to flourish.Mesthrie, Rajend and Bhatt, Rakesh M. (2008). World Englishes: The Study of New Linguistic Varieties. Cambridge University Press. Phase 5 ‚Äì Differentiation: At this stage there is a change in the dynamics of identity as the young nation sees itself as less defined by its differences from the former colonial power as a composite of subgroups defined on regional, social and ethnic lines. Coupled with the simple effects of time in effecting language change (with the aid of social differentiation) the new English koin√© starts to show greater differentiation. Other models of classification =Strevens's world map of English= The oldest map of the spread of English is Strevens's world map of English. His world map, even predating that of Kachru's three circles, showed that since American English became a separate variety from British English, all subsequent Englishes have had affinities with either one or the other.Strevens, P. (1980). Teaching English as an International Language. Oxford: Pergamon Press. =McArthur's circle of World English= McArthur's \\"wheel model\\" has an idealized central variety called \\"World Standard English,\\" which is best represented by \\"written international English.\\" The next circle is made of regional standards or standards that are emerging. Finally, the outer layer consists of localized varieties which may have similarities with the regional standards or emerging standards. Although the model is neat, it raises several problems. Firstly, the three different types of English ‚Äî ENL, ESL and EFL, are conflated in the second circle. Secondly, the multitude of Englishes in Europe are also missing in this layer. Finally, the outside layer includes pidgins, creoles and L2 Englishes. Most scholars would argue that English pidgins and creoles do not belong to one family: rather they have overlapping multiple memberships.McArthur, A. (1987). \\"The English Languages?\\" English Today: 11:9-13. =G√∂rlach's circle model of English= Manfred G√∂rlach's and McArthur's models are reasonably similar. Both exclude English varieties in Europe. As G√∂rlach does not include EFLs at all, his model is more consistent, though less comprehensive. Outside the circle are mixed varieties (pidgins, creoles and mixed languages involving English), which are better categorized as having partial membership.G√∂rlach, M. (1990).Studies in the History of the English Language. Heidelberg: Carl Winter. =Modiano's model of English= In Modiano's model of English, the center consists of users of English as an International Language, with a core set of features which are comprehensible to the majority of native and competent non-native speakers of English. The second circle consists of features which may become internationally common or may fall into obscurity. Finally, the outer area consists of five groups (American English, British English, other major varieties, local varieties, foreign varieties) each with features peculiar to their own speech community and which are unlikely to be understood by most members of the other four groups.Modiano, M. (1999). \\"Standard English(es) and educational practices for the world's lingua franca\\". English Today: 15/4: 3-13. Variations and varieties The World Englishes paradigm is not static, and neither are rapidly changing realities of language use worldwide. The use of English in the Outer and Expanding Circle societies (refer to Kachru's Three Circles of English) continues its rapid spread, while at the same time new patterns of language contact and variety differentiation emerge. The different varieties range from English in the Inner circle societies such as the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, to the Outer circle post- colonial societies of Asia and Africa. The World Englishes Initiative, in recognizing and describing the New Englishes of the Caribbean, Africa and Asia, has been partly motivated by a consideration of the local linguistic factors and partly by a consideration of the wider cultural and political contexts of language acquisition and use. This, in turn, has involved the creative rewriting of discourses towards a recognition of pluralism and multiple possibilities for scholarship. The notion of varieties in this context is similarly dynamic, as new contexts, new realities, new discourses, and new varieties continue to emerge.Kachru, B. B., Kachru, Y. and Nelson, C. (2009). The Handbook of World Englishes. Wiley-Blackwell. The terms language and dialect are not easily defined concepts. It is often suggested that languages are autonomous, while dialects are heteronomous. It is also said that dialects, in contrast with languages, are mutually intelligible, though this is not always the case. Dialects are characteristically spoken, do not have a codified form and are used only in certain domains.Melchers, G. and Shaw, P. (2003) World Englishes. The English Language Series. Department of English, Stockholm University, Sweden In order to avoid the difficult dialect- language distinction, linguists tend to prefer a more neutral term, variety, which covers both concepts and is not clouded by popular usage. This term is generally used when discussing World Englishes. The future of World Englishes Two scenarios have been advanced about English's future status as the major world language: it will ultimately fragment into a large number of mutually unintelligible varieties (in effect, languages), or it will converge so that differences across groups of speakers are largely eliminated. English as the language of 'others' If English is, numerically speaking, the language of 'others', then the center of gravity of the language is almost certain to shift in the direction of the 'others'. In the words of Widdowson, there is likely to be a paradigm shift from one of language distribution to one of language spread:Widdowson, H. G. (1997). \\"EIL, ESL, EFL: Global Issues and Local Interests\\". World Englishes, 16: 135‚Äì146. In this new paradigm, English spreads and adapts according to the linguistic and cultural preferences of its users in the Outer and Expanding circles (refer to Kachru's Three Circles of English). However, if English is genuinely to become the language of 'others', then the 'others' have to be accorded ‚Äì or perhaps more likely, accord themselves ‚Äì at least the same English language rights as those claimed by mother-tongue speakers.Paradowski, M.B. 2008, Apr. Winds of change in the English language ‚Äì Air of peril for native speakers? Novitas-ROYAL (Research on Youth and Language) 2(1), 92‚Äì119. http://www.novitasroyal.org/paradowski.pdf However, it remains to be seen whether such a paradigm shift will take place. A different world language The other potential shift in the linguistic center of gravity is that English could lose its international role altogether, or come to share it with a number of equals. Although this would not happen mainly as a result of native-speaker resistance to the spread of non-native speaker Englishes and the consequent abandoning of English by large numbers of non-native speakers, the latter could play a part. As evidence that English may eventually give way to another language (or languages) as the world's lingua franca, David Crystal cites Internet data:Crystal, D. (2001) Language and the Internet. Cambridge UP. On the other hand, there are at least 1500 languages present on the internet now and that figure is likely to increase. Nevertheless, Crystal predicts that English will retain its dominant presence.

It connects the city of Rhodes with the village of Lindos.  History  Current routing is fairly new as it was completed in 1974 replacing the old national road which was narrow and curvy. Until 1999 it was a single carriageway that, especially during summer time, made driving to the south east part of the island a bad experience. In 1999 the first part of the road from the city to Faliraki was expanded to a dual carriageway with 4 lanes and jersey barrier island. Nowadays (Jun18) further widening of the road from Faliraki to Kolymbia is completed and in use. Route GR-95 is a 46 km north-south avenue connecting Rhodes City to Lindos. Its northern end is supposedly at the port of Rhodes City but in reality becomes an avenue at Exit 1/Rodini Junction. From there up until Exit 21/Kolymbia is dual carriageway with speed limits varying due to passing within residential and tourist areas. Due to lack of funds, almost all main junctions till Kolymbia are traffic lighted - some 20 exits with traffic lights are in use currently. From Kolymbia to Lindos the road becomes single carriageway making junctions hard to record, as every 50 or 100 metres one exists. Please note that since 2014 roundabouts were constructed in major crossroads in this part of GR-95. The main junctions of the road are (Rhodes City to Lindos direction): {  border=\\"1\\" - - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"00408B\\" style=\\"color: white;font-size:100%;\\"  colspan=\\"6\\"  Greek National Road 95 - !

According to same announcement, the prestudy includes same characteristics as the Rhodes to Kolymbia section meaning two lanes per direction divided by a jersey island while for the first time constructions of 3 interchanges is included. Moreover, avenue will follow a new route in the rocky area surrounding Tsambika monastery bypassing it on the northwest end instead of the current southeast route.https://www.rodiaki.gr/article/391688/shmantikes-parembaseis-apo- kolympia-ews-lindo Its also worth noting that if and when city ring road phase 2 goes ahead, an interchange is planned connecting Rhodes-Lindos Avenue to the ring road. Finally, a useful addition would be interchanges at exits 1, 4 and 7 which are usually congested and accidents are not rare.

He was the youngest son of William Henry Seward Sr., the United States Secretary of State under Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson. Early life Seward was born in Auburn, New York. His father, William Henry Seward Sr., had just taken office as Governor of New York when he was born, and his mother, Frances Adeline Seward, was the daughter of Judge Elijah Miller, a law partner of Seward who had built the family home in Auburn in 1816. His elder brothers were Augustus Henry Seward, a brevet colonel in the Paymaster Corps, and Frederick William Seward, who served as Assistant Secretary of State to his father. Career Banking Educated at home, Seward became interested in finance and later started a partnership with Clinton McDougall, was private secretary to his father, then a U.S. Senator from New York, in 1860, and opened a private bank in Auburn in 1861. He left banking on August 22, 1862, to join the Union Army in the U.S. Civil War.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001, , p. 479.Warner, Ezra J. Generals in Blue: Lives of the Union Commanders. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1964, , p. 431.Sifakis, Stewart. Who Was Who in the Civil War. New York: Facts On File, 1988, , p. 581. Military career Seward was appointed lieutenant colonel of New York's 138th Infantry Regiment, which became the 9th New York Heavy Artillery Regiment in December 1862. The regiment served in the defenses of Washington, D.C. until it was converted back to an infantry regiment and sent to the Army of the Potomac because of the losses sustained by that army in the Overland Campaign. After fighting at the Battle of Cold Harbor, Seward was appointed colonel of the regiment on June 10, 1864. A few weeks after Seward's promotion to colonel, his regiment was sent north to meet the threat to Washington, D.C. posed by Confederate Lieutenant General Jubal Early's Valley Campaigns of 1864. Seward was slightly wounded in his arm and suffered a broken leg when his horse fell on him after the horse was shot at the Battle of Monocacy on July 9, 1864. He was promoted to brigadier general on September 13, 1864, and in January 1865 was assigned to command a brigade in the Department of West Virginia, which he did until April 1865. He was thereafter known within his family as \\"The General\\". Seward commanded the 3rd Division for 6 days after Confederate partisan rangers captured Brigadier General George Crook on February 20, 1865. Post-military career Seward resigned his commission on June 1, 1865. After the war, Seward returned to banking and lived with his wife in the family homestead in Auburn, New York. In addition to his banking career, he engaged in politics, charitable work, and patriotic and historic societies and he became a director of several corporations. In 1886, he was elected as a companion of the New York Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and was assigned insignia number 4696. Personal life Seward married Janet MacNeil Watson (1839‚Äì1913), with whom he had three children: *Cornelia Margaret Seward Allen (1862‚Äì1921) *William Henry Seward III (November 10, 1864 ‚Äì February 16, 1951) *Frances Janet Seward Messenger (1880‚Äì1957) William Henry Seward Jr. died in Auburn, New York, on April 26, 1920, at the age of 80, and is buried in Auburn's Fort Hill Cemetery, next to his father.

Marketing Right Guard targets sports enthusiasts, as portrayed through its advertising from the late 1980s to the late 1990s.

He attended Vaughan Road Collegiate school in Toronto, and has an older sister, Ilana.  Career  While growing up in Richmond Hill, Ontario, Zylberman booked his own audition for a Crunchie commercial at age ten, and had landed several voice acting jobs in animated TV series by the time he was 13 years old. He went on to provide voices for many characters on animated series such as The Raccoons, ALF Tales, Garbage Pail Kids, Sylvanian Families, and The Care Bears. He gained some notoriety playing the title role in The Outside Chance of Maximilian Glick, a coming-of-age feature film about being Jewish in a multicultural rural Manitoba town. In a year-end arts review for 1988, the Toronto Star's Sid Adilman called Zylberman \\"the best newcomer to English-Canadian movies this year\\". He was slated to reprise the role in a subsequent CBC Television series, Max Glick, but more than two years passed before production on the series started, and by that time he had grown too tall for the role.

One such program focusing on network sciences NIS-ITA ran from 2006 to 2016. The other program focusing on distributed analytics DAIS-ITA was initiated in 2016.  Overview  The ITA is a combination of country-specific research programs that are run by ARL and MoD respectively. ARL runs several programs called Collaborative Technology Alliances (CTAs) and the MoD runs equivalent programs, each of which are collaborative research programs involving multiple research institutes and universities. CTA programs are run for the duration of 3‚Äì5 years, and usually involve a consortium of industrial research laboratories and universities to team together to solve research problems in a specific domain. The International Technology Alliance differs from the CTAs in having an international scope spanning two countries, the United States and the United Kingdom. The program focuses on coalition operations, and limits its research explorations to fundamental research in public domain, i.e. work that is intended to be published in academic forums.

It was opened by the West Somerset Railway in 1862 and closed by British Rail early in 1971. It was subsequently reopened in 1978 by the present day West Somerset Railway, a heritage line. It has a different layout to most stations, in that the main building lies on the opposite side of the tracks to the platform. History The station was first opened on 31 March 1862 when the West Somerset Railway was brought into use between Norton Junction and . The small station building was put on the east side of the track and the platform on the west; access between the two was across a pedestrian level crossing. A loop line served a goods shed opposite the platform to the north of the station building. The railway was operated from the start by the Bristol and Exeter Railway which became a part of the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1876, but the West Somerset Railway remained an independent company until 1922 when it too was absorbed by the GWR. The platform was extended northwards in 1900 and again in 1933; a small signal box was in use here for a few years but was closed on 6 April 1926. The GWR undertook many projects to increase the capacity of the line in the 1930s. Because of the position of the goods shed opposite the platform it was not possible to add a second track and platform at Stogumber, so a passing loop was instead constructed at Leigh Bridge just south of the station. It was opened on 16 July 1933 but the signal box was generally only used during the daytime each summer. A GWR camp coach was placed in the goods yard from 1934 to 1939. A camping coach was also positioned here by the Western Region from 1952 to 1964, the lack of facilities at this remote location meant that this was accompanied by a water tanker and stores van. Nationalisation in 1948 saw the line become a part of the Western Region of British Railways. The goods facilities were withdrawn on 17 August 1963 and the goods shed had been demolished before the end of the year. Leigh Bridge loop was taken out of use from 5 May 1964 as it was in need of renewal. The station, along with the whole line, was closed on 4 January 1971, but on 7 May 1978 trains returned. The new West Somerset Railway operated trains from to Stogumber, and these were extended on to from 9 June 1979. Description A train to Minehead restarts after its call at Stogumber The original stone-built station building is still in use on the east side of the line and is situated in well nurtured gardens. The platform with its waiting shelters is on the west side of the line. The approach road is on the east side of the line and drops down to the road that passes beneath the line at the south end of the platform. A footpath from the south end of the platform leads down to join this road which leads to Stogumber itself, but a side road to the north by the old railway hotel passes through the smaller settlement of Kingswood, which is nestled below the railway line.Quantock Hills and Bridgwater, Ordnance Survey Explorer Map 140 (1:25,000 scale) Services Trains run between and at weekends and on some other days from March to October, daily during the late spring and summer, and on certain days during the winter.

A notable side-project of the Library of Michigan is the Michigan eLibrary (MeL), one of the first online libraries on the Internet. MeL provides full-text articles, books, Michigan history materials, and evaluated web sites to residents of the state of Michigan. In 2003, the Library of Michigan Board of Trustees elected as chair Elaine Didier, dean of Oakland University's Kresge Library and professor at Oakland University. History In 1828, a territorial library was created containing laws and government documents for use by the territorial council, and William B. Hunt was appointed the territorial librarian. Nine years later, the former territorial library became the state library, and Governor Stevens T. Mason appointed Oren Marsh as the first state librarian. In 1879, the state library moved to the new State Capitol in Lansing. It was originally a two- story room on the second and third floor in the west wing. The space is now the Speaker's Library on the second floor and the House Appropriations Committee room on the third floor. A fire in the State Office Building where the library was housed in 1951 destroyed 20,000 books and damaged 30,000 more. Public Act 540 of 1982 created the Library of Michigan and transferred control of the library from the Department of Education to the Legislative Council. Three years later, the Library of Michigan Foundation, which secures funds to support the library‚Äôs priority programs and projects, was established. In 1988, the Michigan Library and Historical Center opened, tripling the Library of Michigan‚Äôs space and merging its full collection of books in one place for the first time since the 1951 fire. In 2001, the library was moved to the new Department of History, Arts and Libraries. After that department's abolition in 2009, the library was moved back to the Department of Education.Library of Michigan: 175 Years of ServiceMichigan Executive Order 2009-36: Abolishing the Department of History, Arts and Libraries Building Michigan in the 20th Century exhibit in the Michigan History Museum The Library of Michigan at 5 stories contains over 3.2 million different items that take up over of shelves.

Gameplay In 1982, Edu-Ware released a second version of the game, entitled, Prisoner 2, with color and improved graphics (all high-resolution), which replaced the original's top- down perspective with a first-person view. In addition to the Apple II, this version was also available on the Atari 8-bit and IBM PC platforms. While sometimes incorrectly considered a sequel due to its title, Prisoner 2 was essentially the same as the first Prisoner game, only with updated graphics and a limited number of design changes, several of which referenced other games: * A fence (which the player may attempt to jump over) now surrounds the Island. * Rover's appearance was changed from a white ball to that of an entity resembling Pac-Man. * The Hospital is now home to the Milgram Experiment, which is now a special event that occurs periodically. * The Free Information display was moved to the Town Hall, which still houses the Run the Island task, but only as a special event occurring periodically. * The Recreation Hall has expanded obstacle courses. * The Great Chair has been moved into a multi-roomed building called the Switchyard. Most rooms are identical to each other except for a single letter on the wall, which together spell out \\"Rubik's Cube\\". Three rooms are special: the Great Chair room itself, the switch room (with a switch to disable the music that accompanies the scrolling game text), and the exit. * The Library sends the player on literary-themed quests for the Wicked Witch of the West's broomstick or Injun Joe's treasure (from The Adventures of Tom Sawyer), if he chooses not to burn books. * The building that formerly housed the Milgram Experiment is renamed Grail Hall and contains items for the Library quests. It is a maze of rooms, including some that mimick the look of Scott Adams' adventure games, or that reference adventure games such as Colossal Cave Adventure (a cave with the word \\"PLUGH\\" written on the wall), Wizard and the Princess (a castle, whereupon arrival, the player is sent back to the Castle), and Mystery House (whereupon arrival, the player is told \\"He's killed Ken!\\" [a reference to Ken Williams of Sierra On-Line] and is accused of murder until granted absolution in the Church). Reception Jeff Rovin for Videogaming Illustrated said that \\"A great piece of computergaming from both a design point of view and as a challenge, though the lack of originality is disappointing.\\" C.J. Thorns for ANALOG Computing said that \\"Prisoner II is a superb package (I dare not call it a \\"game\\") that should provide weeks of entertainment. It goes far beyond the traditional \\"collect the right combination of treasures\\" adventure, and includes some diabolical arcade-like sequences to frustrate you even more.\\" Jeff Hurlburt for SoftSide said that \\"Prisoner 2 is a superbly crafted adventuring experience. Surely among the more complex computer games, it will repay the involved player with hours of enjoyment in a variety of imaginative, challenging, often humorous scenarios.\\" Softalk said that \\"You have been forewarned. The time and patient you devote to delving into the mysteries of the Island will be well spent. Be seeing you.\\" Prisoner 2 was voted the fourth most popular fantasy game in the annual Softalk reader poll in its 1982 poll.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins and Baltimore Orioles. Professional career Minnesota Twins Casilla was signed as a free agent by the Anaheim Angels in . On December 9, 2005, the Angels traded Casilla to the Minnesota Twins for pitcher J. C. Romero. Casilla made his major league debut with the Twins in September of , playing in nine games. In , after a brief call-up with the Twins, Casilla became the everyday second baseman after Luis Castillo was traded to the New York Mets. Casilla struggled, producing a .222 batting average with no home runs in 189 at-bats. In , Casilla did not make the Twins Opening Day roster and instead started for the Twins AAA affiliate, the Rochester Red Wings. After an injury to infielder Nick Punto, Casilla was called up in May. On May 19, 2008, Casilla hit a three-run homer, his first career MLB home run against Texas Rangers. It was also his first hit of the 2008 season. Casilla spent the rest of the 2008 season as the Twins' starting second baseman and second hitter in the lineup. At the end of the 2008 season, he was batting .281 with 7 home runs and 50 RBIs. Casilla struggled to begin the season. After hitting only .167 in his first 84 at-bats, he was optioned to AaA Rochester. He was recalled and had a .202 AVG, .280 OBP, and a .259 SLG. He had the most at-bats without a home run in the AL. In 2009, during the 2009 AL Central tie-breaker game featuring the Twins against the Detroit Tigers, Casilla became the unlikely hero, hitting a game-winning walk-off single to score Carlos G√≥mez from second base in the bottom of the 12th inning. Prior to the season, Casilla changed his number from 25 to 12, giving number 25 to Jim Thome, who had worn the number for almost his entire 21-year career. For most of the season, Casilla switched between second base and shortstop, sometimes filling in for Tsuyoshi Nishioka, who was injured for the first two months of the season. In 97 games, Casilla hit .260 with 2 home runs and 21 RBI's. Casilla made the Twins' Opening Day roster in 2012 and got off to a relatively slow start in his first 16 games. For the season, he played in a career high 106 games, hitting .241 with 30 RBI's. Baltimore Orioles On November 2, 2012 he was picked up off waivers by the Baltimore Orioles. On November 30, Casilla signed a one-year, $1.7 million deal with a club option for 2014 to avoid arbitration with Baltimore. Casilla made the Opening Day roster with the Orioles in 2013. After Brian Roberts went down with an injury 3 games into the season, Casilla entered a platoon with Ryan Flaherty at second base. Through June, Casilla was hitting .222 with 8 RBI and 10 R. When Roberts returned on June 30, Casilla's playing time drastically diminished, leading to only 4 appearances in all of July, and 20 appearances after June despite being healthy. In 62 games (31 starts) in 2013, Casilla hit .214 with 1 HR, 10 RBI and 15 R. He did not make an error in 170 chances in the field, with 169 of those being at second base. On November 4, Casilla had his $3 million club option declined, and was instead paid the $200,000 buyout, becoming a free agent. In January 2014 he signed with Orioles again and by April 17 of the same year was replaced by Jonathan Schoop due to his strained hamstring.

History The regiment, which was formed in April 2008, is one of two British Army units attached to 3 Commando Brigade, Royal Marines, the other being 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery. It was announced on 4 July 2012 that 24 Commando Engineer Regiment was to disband under Army 2020. Members of the unit were to be dispersed to other British Army units and 59 Independent Commando Squadron would be re-formed to replace it. In a contrasting written statement on 10 April 2014, the Minister for Defence Mark Francois, stated that this withdrawal would not take place. The unit was to be retained but reduced in size. In August 2014 it was agreed that 131 Independent Squadron would re-subordinate from 3 Commando Brigade to become part of 24 Commando Royal Engineers. This change took place on 2 October 2015, making the regiment a hybrid Regular/Reserve unit, like its counterpart in 16 Air Assault Brigade, 23 Parachute Engineer Regiment.

The Commando course All individuals who volunteer to join the regiment have the opportunity to complete the thirteen-week All Arms Commando Course, after receiving pre-course coaching to develop their strength and endurance. Progressive in nature, this pre-course conditioning package focuses upon developing the individual to undertake the arduous activities of the Commando course. The Green Beret The coveted Green Beret, the distinctive hallmark of Commando trained troops, is worn by the regiment, recognising those who have completed the grueling and physically demanding tests of endurance, whilst displaying the Commando spirit. On passing the Commando course, other ranks (ORs) wear the Commando Green Beret with a blackened Royal Engineers cap-badge, whilst officers wear the officers' flaming grenade cap-badge with a green base material, sewn onto the Commando Green Beret. Other uniform emblems Both officers and ORs wear the Army Commando shoulder titles on each sleeve, which have replaced the All-Arms Commando badge (a small red dagger on a dark blue background) on the upper left sleeve in No. 8 Temperate Combat Dress, (PCS-CU) uniform only. All other orders of dress retain the All-Arms Commando badge. The Royal Engineers stable belt is differentiated by a Commando Dagger emblem on the clasp. Additionally, the 3 Commando Brigade RM Tactical Recognition Flash, (TRF) a black Commando Dagger on an olive green square, is worn on the left arm of shirt and combat jacket.

Political campaigns 2006 In 2006 Loebsack narrowly defeated 15-term Republican incumbent Jim Leach in one of the biggest upsets of the cycle. Loebsack was nominated by a special convention of the 2nd District after failing to get the required number of signatures to be on the primary ballot. Since there was no one qualified for the ballot, the convention was called to determine the nomination. The 2nd had been trending Democratic for some time (a Republican presidential candidate had not carried it since 1984), and was considered the most Democratic-leaning district in the state. It was taken for granted that Leach would be succeeded by a Democrat once he retired, but he was not considered particularly vulnerable due to his moderate voting record, popularity, and longtime incumbency. Loebsack won largely by running up an 8,395-vote margin in Johnson County, home to Iowa City. 2008 Loebsack was easily reelected in 2008, taking 57 percent of the vote over Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a doctor from Ottumwa and the former president of the state medical society. 2010 Loebsack faced Miller-Meeks again in 2010 and had a much more difficult time of it than he had two years earlier. He prevailed with only 51% of the vote, largely by running up a 13,900-vote margin in Johnson County. Terry Branstad easily carried the district in his successful bid to reclaim the governorship. Chuck Grassley carried every county in the district except Johnson; in fact, Johnson was the only county Grassley lost in his bid for another term. 2012 After redistricting moved Loebsack's longtime home in Mount Vernon to the 1st District of fellow Democrat Bruce Braley, Loebsack moved to Iowa City in the reconfigured 2nd. The redrawn district is less Democratic than its predecessor; it regained Davenport, which had been the anchor of the 2nd and its predecessors for decades before being shifted out of the district in the 2000s round of redistricting. Loebsack won the election with 55.4% of the vote. His Republican opponent, John Archer, got 42.5%; Alan Aversa, an Independent candidate, received 2.2%.

U.S. 1 (the Overseas Highway) crosses the key at approximately mile markers 36-38.5, between Ohio Key and Spanish Harbor Key west of Marathon, close to the west end of the Seven Mile Bridge. The island is virtually uninhabited, being home to the Bahia Honda State Park. Founded in 1961, the park occupies most of the island. The channel at the island's west end is one of the deepest natural channels in the Florida Keys. Fauna Marine life is quite plentiful in the waters surrounding the island. Just off the beach snorkelers can spot many species of small reef fish, as well as rays, barracuda, and even the occasional small nurse shark. The only known natural colony of the now rare Miami blue butterfly was discovered in the park in 1999. The butterfly had been thought to have become extinct as a result of Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Flora Several rare plants, including yellow satinwood (Zanthoxylum flavum), Florida silver palm (Coccothrinax argentata), Coconut palm (Cocos nucifera), Key thatch palm (Leucothrinax morrisii), and the endangered small- flowered lily-thorn (Catesbaea parviflora) are found in the park History Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast Railway once ran through the present parkland to Key West. Built between 1905 and 1912, it was destroyed by the severe Labor Day Hurricane of 1935. Later, the railroad bridge foundations were used to build the Overseas Highway, which became U.S. 1. Part of the old Bahia Honda Bridge is accessible from the park, and offers a panoramic view of the islands. In 1908, the Florida East Coast Railway Company built two large two-story dormitories there to house workers building the Bahia Honda Bridge. In 1890 Bahia Honda Key was the southern terminus for Miami-Dade county which stretched as far north as present day St. Lucie River. Recreational activities The natural, white sand beach was rated the #1 beach in 1992 in the United States by \\"Dr. Beach\\" Stephen Leatherman (the first Florida beach to be so honored), making it popular for swimming. A nature trail near the park's oceanside beach skirts a tidal lagoon before passing through a coastal hardwood hammock. Bicycling and inline skating can be done on the park's paved road, and there are several fishing and picnicking spots in the area. The Sand and Sea Nature Center features displays about local sea and shore life, including corals, shells, crabs, sea urchins, drift seeds, sea sponges and sea turtles. Kayaks and snorkeling gear can be rented at the park, and boat trips for snorkeling on the reef are available. The park has a marina with boat slips available for overnight rental. Campsites (primitive and full hook-up) and vacation cabins are available, although reservations for the winter months can be very difficult to get. The park is also a part of the Great Florida Birding Trail. Hours Florida state parks are open between 8 a.m. and sundown every day of the year (including holidays).

The object of the game is to guide a student named Mikie around the school locations to collect hearts which make up a letter from his girlfriend while being chased by members of the school staff. Gameplay The game starts at Mikie's classroom. Mikie must bump the students out of their seats to collect the hearts they're sitting on, while simultaneously avoiding the classroom teacher. Once all hearts are collected by the player he is allowed to leave the room and enter the school corridor. The school corridor is where Mikie will be chased by the janitor and his classroom teacher, who follows him outside. This is the way to gain access to the rest of the school building, each room representing a different challenge or level. Mikie will be cued to the proper door to enter by a large, flashing \\"In\\" - opening any other door will result in Mikie being punched by a coiled boxing glove or hairy foot, stunning him. One of the doors, however,contains a scantily clad girl: opening this door is worth 5,000 points. Mikie can also pick up extra points by picking up lunch boxes and opening a grate that contains a burger and soda. In addition to head-butting, enemies (the janitor and the classroom teacher) can also be stunned by slamming doors in their faces. The second room is the locker room, where the objective is to break the lockers to get the hearts, while being pursued by a janitor, a cook, and the classroom teacher. In addition to the head-butting, there are three bins of basketballs located around the room, which Mikie can pick up and throw using the action button. Each bin holds three basketballs. Room three is the cafeteria where Mikie is pursued by two cooks and, again, the classroom teacher. One cook who stands at the top of the room occasionally throws a leg of meat directly at Mikie. On each table are roasts (3 per table) which Mikie can hurl at his enemies. Room four sees the student in the Dance Studio, where he must avoid dancing girls who stun him, as well as the dance instructor and, yet again, his classroom teacher. The final stage has Mikie avoiding football players in the garden outside of his school, who are guarding the hearts he must collect, attempting to reach his girlfriend Mandy. Releases Arcade Mikie initially underwent location testing in Japan under its international title, with the same graphics and high school theme that would be used for the game's overseas releases. However, Konami chose not release Mike as is in Japan due to the game's premise of having a protagonist sneaking out of school after incidents of school violence at the time. As a result, an alternative version was produced for Japanese arcades titled , which replaces the school setting with a workplace. The classroom in the first level becomes an office and the teacher into a manager; the dance studio in the third level becomes the OL office; the other levels (the hallway, the gym, the restaurant and the outdoor garden) are mostly unchanged aside from a few graphical modifications, but the football players in the final level are instead security guards. The game's soundtrack, which features chiptunes rendition of The Beatles songs \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", and \\"Twist and Shout\\", had permission granted by JASRAC in Japan, with a license displayed on the instruction card and printed circuit board. A revised version of the game, titled High School Graffiti Mikie, provided less violent action, in which Mikie's physical attack was changed from a head butt to a paralyzing shout, while his \\"death\\" animation was changed from rolling around on the floor to sobbing in contrition.Retro Gamer, issue 76. Retrorevival ... Mikie (pages 90-91). The glass jars, which Mikie had to head butt three times to retrieve the heart inside, were replaced with bundles of three hearts, providing the same effect without requiring the player character to head butt glass. In the first level, the writing on the blackboard reads \\"Failure Teaches Success\\", instead of \\"E=MC2\\". Mikie's shout has no effect on his classroom teacher. After each completed \\"step\\" (the loops of the game) in this version, the speed of the enemy characters increases, with some of them even gaining new abilities. Home conversions Mikie was ported to various home computers by Ocean Software subsidiary Imagine Software, with versions released for the Amstrad CPC, Acorn Electron, BBC Micro, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. An SG-1000 version of Shinny≈´ Shain T≈çru- kun, was also released exclusively in Japan by Sega.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Mikie on their December 1, 1984 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the year.

The earthquake doublet killed three people and injured 19. Poor water and sanitation posed an ongoing risk to health, as did malaria, given its prevalence in the region and the fact that some people sleep outdoors without mosquito nets. Damaged roofs made from asbestos posed additional risks to health. Following an initial assessment mission of the earthquake affected areas on 29 July by the Minister for Emergency Situations, a second joint mission followed on 1 August, led by the Deputy Prime Minister and including the UN Country Team, WHO and humanitarian partners. WHO, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, immediately activated other UN and international agencies and NGOs in response to the disaster. To date, more than ten health partners, including NGOs, UN and International agencies have worked together to provide 50,000 water purification tablets, 86 tents and essential household items, mosquito nets, soap, buckets and high energy biscuits and to ensure basic drugs and WHO has donated 1 NEHKit to support local health authorities in ensuring essential medications are available for affected communities and forwarded drug donation guidelines.

It is situated from the village of Crowcombe. History Crowcombe Heathfield station was first opened on 31 March 1862 when the West Somerset Railway was opened from Norton Junction to . The railway was operated by the Bristol and Exeter Railway which became a part of the Great Western Railway in 1876, but the West Somerset Railway remained an independent company until 1922 when it too was absorbed by the Great Western. When the station first opened there was just one platform, on the east side of the line, on what is now the \\"up\\" side towards . A \\"down\\" loop line and second platform were opened in 1879, together with an accompanying signal box at its north eastern end. The developments also included an extension of the existing goods siding west of the station, accessed via the western throat, which was extended to the road overbridge. W.G.King's had a quarry at Triscombe, and had built their own tramway transporting stone from the quarry to a stone-crusher, and then onwards to either: a tarmac/concrete plant located adjacent to the Station Master's House; or a tipper parallel to the goods siding, and hence loaded on to its own set of 5 plank private owner wagons. On 1 December 1889 the station was renamed as plain \\"Crowcombe\\" to avoid confusion with on the Moretonhampstead branch in Devon. The loop was extended in 1934 to cope with long holiday trains running to , leaving the signal box now sited midway down the western platform; the eastern ends of the platforms to this day are made up of different materials. Nationalisation in 1948 saw it become a part of the Western Region of British Railways. British Rail closed the railway on 4 January 1971, during which they demolished a number of buildings on the stations platforms, and burnt down the original \\"squat\\" B&ER; signal box. WSR The station reopened on 9 June 1979; the West Somerset Railway was now a heritage railway operating steam and diesel trains from Minehead to and Bishops Lydeard. The WSR removed the goods siding, and left the down side loop out of action. The station was still known as Crowcombe for a while, but the name was returned to Crowcombe Heathfield in 1991. Description Located in a small local valley, the station stands at the highest point on the line, just under above sea level. The station has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II listed building. The railway workers' cottages and station master's house, together with the main station building, are the only original structures left. A display of permanent way can be found on the western platform and includes a portion of broad gauge \\"baulk road\\" as was originally used on the line. Loop and signal box The signal box, looking towards . The grassed sections of the platform are located on the 1934 extension The station stands at the highest point on the line, just under above sea level, approached by a 1:86 gradient either side. This has always slowed the operating time on the long section between and , resulting in total capacity restrictions on the whole line to . Increasing seasonal passenger traffic to , was the driver behind the B&ER; installing a loop at the station in 1879, doubling maximum traffic to a total of four trains per hour. When the WSR reopened the line only the eastern \\"up\\" platform line was certified for operation. The resultant long-section between and meant that the line could only operate a maximum of two trains which were timed to pass at which is about half way along the line. The station's loop was reinstated in May 1994 so a new signal box was required. A small standard-pattern GWR signal box was made using an upper wooden section reclaimed from the closed Ebbw Vale Sidings South in South Wales which was mounted on a newly constructed standard-height brick locking room. This has access steps on the southern side rather than the northern side as before. The 34 lever tappet-locking frame was first installed at Marsh Junction, Bristol, and then moved to Frome North in 1970. It was bought directly by the WSR after that signal box closed in 1984, and reinstalled in its current location, with 29 operating levers. The two loops were purposefully installed with linked-operated catch-points, which allows full two-train operations. The signalling design allows the signal box to be switched-out of operation at quiet times when trains do not need to pass here. Three token boxes are hence provided at the signal boxes at and , and the signal box has two extra levers to allow the signalman to passover section control. Films made at Crowcombe Several films and television programmes have been shot at Crowcombe: * A Hard Day's Night (1964) featured The Beatles and was filmed in 1964 at London Marylebone station and on the Taunton to Minehead branch line. A scene in which the band ran alongside a train was filmed near Crowcombe. * The Flockton Flyer (1976-7) was a children's television drama series about a preserved railway that was filmed on the West Somerset Railway and included scenes filmed at many stations including Crowcombe Heathfield. * The Land Girls (1997) was filmed on the West Somerset Railway and Crowcombe Heathfield featured as Bamford station. * The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1988), a BBC television mini-series, where the four Pevensie children arrived at the start of the film after being evacuated by train from London. Services Trains run between and at weekends and on some other days from March to October, daily during the late spring and summer, and on certain days during the winter.

How Fairtrade works With Fairtrade coffee, for instance, packers in developed countries pay a fee to The Fairtrade Foundation for the right to use the brand and logo, and nearly all the fee goes on marketing. Packers and retailers can charge as much as they want for the coffee. The coffee has to come from a certified Fairtrade cooperative, and there is a minimum price when the world market is oversupplied, and 10c per lb extra at other times. The cooperatives can, on average, sell only a third of their output as Fairtrade, because of lack of demand, and sell the rest at world prices.Mohan, S. (2010).

There is little or no research on the extra costs incurred or the extra revenue. The marketing system for Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade coffee is identical in the consuming countries, using mostly the same importing, packing, distributing and retailing firms.

Work Certification Fairtrade Canada is responsible for certifying that Canadian products bearing the Fairtrade certification marks meet international Fairtrade standards. While the entire certification system monitors supply chains from the producers until the final point of packaging, we are responsible for monitoring and auditing products once they enter Canada, to ensure that what is sold as fair trade certified actually is. Licensing Fairtrade Canada licenses Canadian companies to use the fair trade certification marks on their products, and as part of that license companies must abide by strict mark-use standards. Fairtrade Canada monitors these licensed organisations to ensure that the markings are not used in a way that is misleading to the public, and work with companies to ensure their use does not undermine the integrity of the marks. Promotion Fairtrade Canada works alongside community groups, companies, and individual citizens to promote fair trade certified products. Through partnerships, campaigns, promotional materials, events, and media engagement, the organisation works to develop peoples' understanding of fair trade and to build momentum so that more producers can sell more of their products on fair terms. Sign announcing Wolfville's (Canada) Fair Trade Town status The following fair trade products are currently certified by Fairtrade Canada and available throughout the country: coffee, tea, cocoa, sugar, fresh fruit, grains (rice and quinoa), spices and herbs, cotton, wine, flowers, nuts and oils (shea butter and olive oil), and sports balls. Fairtrade Canada organizes and coordinates several events every year to promote fair trade in Canada, most notably the Fair Trade Fortnight (or the Quinzaine du Commerce √âquitable in French) which typically run in May, and the Canadian Fairtrade Towns campaign. In 2007, Fairtrade certified sales in Canada amounted to CAD $120 million, a 55% year-to-year increase. Furthermore, in 2005 it was estimated that approximately 27% of the Canadian adult population was aware of fair trade certified coffee, up from 17% in 2003 and 11% in 2001. Criticisms Ethical basis of criticisms Consumers have been shown to be content paying higher prices for Fairtrade products, in the belief that this helps the very poor.See for example Costa. (2010).

Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics , 54: 555-565. The main ethical criticism of Fairtrade is that this premium over non-Fairtrade products does not reach the producers and is instead collected by businesses, employees of co-operatives or used for unnecessary expenses. Furthermore, research has cited the implementation of certain Fairtrade standards as a cause for greater inequalities in markets where these rigid rules are inappropriate for the specific market.Booth, Philip \\"Don‚Äôt bully the faithful into buying Fairtrade\\", The Catholic Herald, 20 February 2009; Booth, P. and L.

In four cases it has been possible to find out. One British caf√© chain was passing on less than one percent of the extra charged to the exporting cooperative; in Finland, Valkila, Haaparanta and NiemiValkila, J., Haaparanta, P., & Niemi, N.

Journal of Business Ethics , 86:3-26 , p. 21. =Less money reaches farmers= The Fairtrade Foundation does not monitor how much of the extra money paid to the exporting cooperatives reaches the farmer. The cooperatives incur costs in reaching the Fairtrade political standards, and these are incurred on all production, even if only a small amount is sold at Fairtrade prices. The most successful cooperatives appear to spend a third of the extra price received on this: some less successful cooperatives spend more than they gain. While this appears to be agreed by proponents and critics of Fairtrade,e.g. Utting-Chamorro, K (2005). Does Fairtrade make a difference? The case of small coffee producers in Nicaragua.

FLO figuresFairtrade Labelling Organizations International.: 2010, Annual Report 2009-2010. Retrieved May 27, 2011, from http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/resources/FLO_Annual- Report-2009_komplett_double_web.pdf are that 40% of the money reaching the Third World is spent on ‚Äòbusiness and production‚Äô which would include these costs, as well as costs incurred by any inefficiency and corruption in the cooperative or the marketing system. The rest is stated to be spent on social projects, rather than being passed on to farmers. There is no evidence that Fairtrade farmers get higher prices on average. Anecdotes state that farmers were paid more or less by traders than by Fairtrade cooperatives. Few of these anecdotes address the problems of price reporting in Third World markets,See Bowbrick, P, \\"Are price reporting systems of any use?\\", British Food Journal. 90(2) 65-69 March/April. 1988. Current international research on Third World market information systems is given at http://www.sim2g.org/. and few appreciate the complexity of the different price packages which may or may not include credit, harvesting, transport, processing, etc. Cooperatives typically average prices over the year, so they pay less than traders at some times, more at others. Bassett (2009)Bassett, T. (2009). Slim pickings: Fairtrade cotton in West Africa. Geoforum. is able to compare prices only where Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade farmers have to sell cotton to the same monopsonistic ginneries which pay low prices. Prices would have to be higher to compensate farmers for the increased costs they incur to produce Fairtrade. For instance, Fairtrade encouraged Nicaraguan farmers to switch to organic coffee, which resulted in a higher price per pound, but a lower net income because of higher costs and lower yields.Kilian, B., Jones, C., Pratt, L., & Villalobos, A. (2006). \\"Is Sustainable Agriculture a Viable Strategy to Improve Farm Income in Central America? A Case Study on Coffee\\". Journal of Business Research , 59(3), 322‚Äì330.; Valkila, J. (2009). Fair Trade organic coffee production in Nicaragua - Sustainable development or a poverty trap? Ecological Economics , 68 3018-3025;Wilson, B. R. (2009). Indebted to Fair Trade? Coffee and Crisis in Nicaragua. Geoforum. =Lack of evidence of impact= There have been very few attempts at fair trade impact studies. It would be methodologically and logically incorrect to use these attempts to conclude that Fairtrade in general does or does not have a positive impact.Griffiths, Peter, ‚ÄòLack of rigour in defending Fairtrade: a reply to Alistair Smith, Economic Affairs 30 (2) 40-96, June 2010 Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm Griffiths (2011) argues that few of these attempts meet the normal standards for an impact study, such as comparing the before and after situation, and having meaningful control groups. Serious methodological problems arise in sampling, in comparing prices, and from the fact that the social projects of Fairtrade do not usually aim to produce economic benefits. Inefficient marketing system One reason for low prices is that Fairtrade farmers have to sell through a monopsonist cooperative, which may be inefficient or corrupt ‚Äì certainly some private traders are more efficient than some cooperatives. They cannot choose the buyer who offers the best price, or switch when their cooperative is going bankruptMendoza, R., & J. Bastiaensen, J. (2003). Fair Trade and the Coffee Crisis in the Nicaraguan Segovias. Small Enterprise Development , 14(2), p. 42. if they wish to retain fairtrade status. There are also complaints that Fairtrade deviates from the free market ideal of some economists. Brink calls fair trade a \\"misguided attempt to make up for market failures\\" encouraging market inefficiencies and overproduction.Brink, Lindsey. (2004). Grounds for Complaint. URL accessed on September 25, 2006. =Corruption= The Fair Trade marketing system provides more opportunities for corruption than the normal marketing system; and less possibility of, or incentive for, controlling corruption. Corruption has been noted in false labelling of coffee as Fairtrade by retailers and by packers in the developing countries,Weitzman, H. (2006, September 8).

Fair Trade organic coffee production in Nicaragua - Sustainable development or a poverty trap? Ecological Economics , 68 p. 3023) Fairtrade harms other farmers =Overproduction argument= Critics argue that Fairtrade harms all non- Fairtrade farmers. Fairtrade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on increasing yields and quality. Economistse.g.Griffiths, P. (2008) ‚ÄòWhy Fairtrade Isn‚Äôt Fair‚Äô, Prospect, August Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htmBooth, P. and L. Whetstone (2007) ‚ÄòHalf a Cheer for Fair Trade‚Äô, Economic Affairs, 27, 2, 29‚Äì36; Sidwell, M. (2008) Unfair Trade, London: Adam Smith Institute.Harford, T: \\"The Undercover Economist.\\", 2005 state that, if this is indeed so, Fairtrade farmers will increase production. As the demand for coffee is highly inelastic, a small increase in supply means a large fall in market price, so perhaps a million Fairtrade farmers get a higher price and 24 million others get a substantially lower price. Critics quote the example of farmers in Vietnam being paid over the world price in the 1980s, planting much coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s. The Fairtrade minimum price means that when the world market price collapses, it is the non-Fairtrade farmers, particularly the poorest, who have to cut down their coffee trees. This argument is supported by mainstream economists, not just free marketers. This argument falls away if, as critics and FLO state, farmers do not get a higher price. =Diverting aid from other farmers= Fairtrade supporters boast of ‚ÄòThe Honeypot Effect‚Äô ‚Äì that cooperatives which become Fairtrade members then attract additional aid from other NGO charities, government and international donors as a result of their membership.e.g. Utting, K. (2009). Assessing the impact of Fair Trade Coffee: Towards an Integrative Framework. Journal of Business Ethics , 86:127-149. p. 141). ; Murray, D., Raynolds, L., & Taylor, P. (2003).

A Case Study with COOCAFE in Costa Rica; Valkila, J. (2009). Fair Trade organic coffee production in Nicaragua - Sustainable development or a poverty trap? Ecological Economics , 68 p. 3024 Typically there are now six to twelve other donors. Critics point out that this inevitably means that resources are being removed from other, poorer, farmers. It also makes it impossible to argue that any positive or negative changes in the living standards of farmers are due to Fairtrade rather than to one of the other donors. Other ethical issues =Secretiveness= Under EU law (Directive 2005/29/EC on Unfair Commercial Practices) the criminal offence of Unfair Trading is committed if (a) ‚Äòit contains false information and is therefore untruthful or in any way, including overall presentation, deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer, even if the information is factually correct‚Äô, (b) ‚Äòit omits material information that the average consumer needs . . . and thereby causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise‚Äô or (c) ‚Äòfails to identify the commercial intent of the commercial practice . . . [which] causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise.‚Äô Griffiths (2011) points to false claims that Fairtrade producers get higher prices, the almost universal failure to disclose the extra price charged for Fairtrade products, to disclose how much of this actually reaches the Third World, to disclose what this is spent on in the Third World, to disclose how much, if any, reaches farmers, and to disclose the harm that Fairtrade does to non-Fairtrade farmers. He also points to the failure to disclose when ‚Äòthe primary commercial intent‚Äô is to make money for retailers and distributors in rich countries. =Imposing politics= The Fairtrade criteria are essentially political, and critics state that it is unethical to bribe Third World producers to adopt a set of political views that they may not agree with, and the donors providing the money may not agree with. In addition many of the failures of Fairtrade derive from these political views, such as the unorthodox marketing system imposed.e.g. Booth, Philip \\"Don‚Äôt bully the faithful into buying Fairtrade\\", The Catholic Herald, 20 February 2009; Booth, P. and L. Whetstone (2007) ‚ÄòHalf a Cheer for Fair Trade‚Äô, Economic Affairs, 27, 2, 29‚Äì36; Griffiths, P., ‚ÄòEthical objections to Fairtrade‚Äô Journal of Business Ethics July 2011 (DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm; Boersma (2002, 2009)Boersma, F.

This may not tie in with the objectives of producers, consumers, importers or retailers. =Unethical selling techniques= Booth says that the selling techniques used by some sellers and some supporters of Fairtrade are bullying, misleading, and unethical.Booth, Philip \\"Don‚Äôt bully the faithful into buying Fairtrade\\", The Catholic Herald, 20 February 2009; Booth, P. and L.

London: Institute of Economic Affairs http://www.iea.org.uk/record.jsp?type=book&ID;=437 ; There are problems with the use of boycott campaigns and other pressure to force sellers to stock a product they think ethically suspect. However, the opposite has been argued, that a more participatory and multi-stakeholder approach to auditing might improve the quality of the process. Some people argue that these practices are justifiable: that strategic use of labeling may help embarrass (or encourage) major suppliers into changing their practices. They may make transparent corporate vulnerabilities that activists can exploit. Or they may encourage ordinary people to get involved with broader projects of social change. =Misleading volunteers= A lot of people volunteer to work to support Fairtrade. They may do unpaid work for firms, or market Fairtrade in schools, universities, local governments, or parliament. Crane and Davies‚ÄôCrane, A., & Davies, I. A. (2003). Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies.

In 2006, a Financial Times journalist found that ten out of ten mills visited had sold uncertified coffee to co- operatives as certified. It reported that \\"The FT was also handed evidence of at least one coffee association that received Fairtrade certification despite illegally growing some 20 per cent of its coffee in protected national forest land. Trade justice and fair trade Segments of the trade justice movement have also criticized fair trade in the past years for allegedly focusing too much on individual small producer groups while stopping short of advocating immediate trade policy changes that would have a larger impact on disadvantaged producers' lives. French author and RFI correspondent Jean- Pierre Boris championed this view in his 2005 book Commerce in√©quitable.Boris, Jean-Pierre. (2005). Commerce in√©quitable. Hachette Litt√©ratures. Paris. Political objections There have been largely political criticisms of Fairtrade from the left and the right. Some believe the fair trade system is not radical enough. French author Christian Jacquiau, in his book Les coulisses du commerce √©quitable, calls for stricter fair trade standards and criticizes the fair trade movement for working within the current system (i.e., partnerships with mass retailers, multinational corporations, etc.) rather than establishing a new fairer, fully autonomous trading system. Jacquiau is also a staunch supporter of significantly higher fair trade prices in order to maximize the impact, as most producers only sell a portion of their crop under fair trade terms.Jacquiau, Christian. (2006). Les Coulisses du Commerce √âquitable. √âditions Mille et Une Nuits. Paris. It has been argued that the approach of the FairTrade system is too rooted in a Northern consumerist view of justice which Southern producers do not participate in setting. \\"A key issue is therefore to make explicit who possesses the power to define the terms of Fairtrade, that is who possesses the power to determine the need of an ethic in the first instance, and subsequently command a particular ethical vision as the truth.\\"Catherine S.

After an unsuccessful movie, Head, from the previous winter, RCA Records attempted to revive interest in the Monkees which was waning, but to no avail.

This first compilation also featured the LP debut, as well as the stereo debut, of \\"A Little Bit Me, a Little Bit You\\" without handclaps and with Davy Jones singing \\"Oh girl, oh girl\\" during the instrumental section which is not present in the mono single version. Of the eight remaining tracks, \\"(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone\\" was a very popular B-side. \\"Randy Scouse Git\\" was issued as a single in UK and reached #2 on the UK Singles Chart (as \\"Alternate Title\\"). \\"She\\" was released in Mexico and \\"Shades Of Gray\\" in the Philippines; however, they did not do as well as Mexico‚Äôs number one, \\"(Look Out) Here Comes Tomorrow\\" or Australia‚Äôs chart topper, \\"(Theme From) The Monkees,\\" neither of which appear on this package. Despite Mike Nesmith still being with the group at the time, no songs with Nesmith's lead vocals appear on the album (the Nesmith-penned \\"Mary, Mary\\" does make an appearance). Although Peter Tork had recently departed, he gets a co-vocal with Jones on \\"Shades of Gray.\\" As was common on the show and the albums, Micky Dolenz has many lead vocals on the album; 8 of the 14 tracks feature Dolenz. Missing from the album are three B-sides that charted in the Billboard Hot 100: \\"The Girl I Knew Somewhere\\", \\"Words\\" and \\"Tapioca Tundra\\". \\"Take a Giant Step\\", the B-side to \\"Last Train to Clarksville\\", and \\"Goin' Down\\", the B-side to \\"Daydream Believer\\", also do not make an appearance. Instead, \\"I Wanna Be Free,\\" \\"Cuddly Toy\\" and \\"Zor and Zam\\" were included. \\"Free\\" appeared multiple times on the TV series; \\"Cuddly Toy\\" may have been included because it was written by Harry Nilsson, whose star was on the rise at the time; and \\"Zor and Zam\\" was the final song by the group to appear on the series in the show's final episode. The album progresses in roughly a reverse-chronological order, with more recent hits \\"Daydream Believer\\" and \\"Pleasant Valley Sunday\\" at the beginning, and early hits \\"(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone\\" and \\"Last Train to Clarksville\\" closing out the album. All of the tracks would reappear on Barrel Full of Monkees except for \\"Zor and Zam\\". This was finally reissued on 3 Jan 2012, in 180 Gram vinyl, by Friday Music Cataloged as FRM-115. The reissue is exactly the same as the original.

A recent discovery of a test pressing of this record reveals that the title of this album was to be called Greatest Hits, No. 2. Like its predecessor, it contained 14 songs. Four of these songs were key album tracks; five songs were issued on both singles and albums; the remaining five selections were previously released only as singles and would have made their album debut on this collection, had it actually been released. Again, the Top 40 hits \\"Words\\" and \\"Tapioca Tundra\\" were, for some reason, overlooked for this compilation. While no official catalog number was ever assigned, the track listing was in place right from the start. Further documentation reveals that all 14 songs were in true stereo.

Cray turned the design into a commercial product in 2004. The XT3 derives much of its architecture from the previous Cray T3E system, and also from the Intel ASCI Red supercomputer. XT3 The XT3 consists of between 192 and 32,768 processing elements (PEs), where each PE comprises a 2.4 or 2.6 GHz AMD Opteron processor with up to two cores, a custom \\"SeaStar\\" communications chip, and between 1 and 8 GB of RAM. The PowerPC 440 based SeaStar device provides a 6.4 gigabyte per second connection to the processor across HyperTransport, as well as six 8-gigabyte per second links to neighboring PEs. The PEs are arranged in a 3-dimensional torus topology, with 96 PEs in each cabinet. The XT3 runs an operating system called UNICOS/lc that partitions the machine into three sections, the largest comprising the Compute nodes, and two smaller sections for Service nodes and IO nodes. In UNICOS/lc 1.x, the Compute PEs run a Sandia developed microkernel called Catamount, which is descended from the SUNMOS OS of the Intel Paragon; in UNICOS/lc 2.0, Catamount was replaced by a specially tuned version of Linux called Compute Node Linux (CNL). Service and IO PEs run the full version of SuSE Linux and are used for interactive logins, systems management, application compiling and job launch. I/O PEs use physically distinct hardware, in that the node boards include PCI-X slots for connections to Ethernet and Fibre Channel networks. Though the performance of each XT3 model will vary with the speed and number of processors installed, the November 2007 Top500 results for the Red Storm machine, the largest XT3 machine installed at Sandia, measured 102.7 teraflops on the Linpack benchmark, placing it at #6 on the list. After upgrades in 2008 to install some XT4 nodes with quad-core Opterons, Red Storm achieved 248 teraflops to place at #9 on the November 2008 Top500.

During the war, large scale research at the RadLab was devoted to the rapid development of microwave radar. Projects included physical electronics, microwave physics, electromagnetic properties of matter, and microwave communication principles. The \\"Rad Lab\\" designed almost half of the radar deployed in World War II, created over 100 different radar systems, and constructed $1.5 billion worth of radar. At the height of its activities, the Rad Lab employed nearly 4,000 people working on several continents. What began as a British-American effort to make microwave radar work, evolved into a centralized laboratory committed to understanding the theories behind experimental radar while solving its engineering problems. The Rad Lab formally closed on December 31, 1945, and its staff members resumed their peacetime activities. In its wake remained tons of surplus equipment and the concept for a basic research center that was to continue in RLE. On January 1, 1946, under the sponsorship of the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development, the RadLab's Basic Research Division continued work at MIT as a transitional organization. Under the leadership of Director Julius A. Stratton and Associate Director Albert G. Hill, it continued investigation on problems in physical electronics that involved cathodes, electronic emission, and gaseous conduction. In microwave physics, the electromagnetic properties of matter at microwave frequencies were studied. Modern techniques were applied to both physics and engineering research, and in microwave communications, engineering applications were emphasized. On July 1, 1946, the Basic Research Division was finally incorporated into the new Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT.  Research Today  The Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT was the first of MIT's modern interdepartmental academic research centers. Today, RLE is one of MIT's largest such organizations, and the most diverse research laboratory at MIT in our scope of intellectual interests. Research in RLE encompasses an extensive range of natural and man-made phenomena, and the projects are both basic and applied. Common among all RLE efforts is an expansive 21st century interpretation of the 20th century term ‚Äúelectronics,‚Äù starting at the most basic physical realm of particles and quantum physics and extending all the way to engineering application technologies relevant to modern day issues.  Seven Major Themes  Research in RLE today is focused on seven major themes: * Atomic Physics * Circuits, Systems, Signals and Communications * Quantum Computation and Communication * Energy, Power and Electromagnetics * Photonic Materials Devices and Systems * Nanoscale Science and Engineering * Multiscale Bioengineering and Biophysics  A Nexus of Interdisciplinary Activities Seventy-two principal investigators in RLE‚Äîof whom sixty-four are members of the MIT faculty‚Äîdirect the Laboratory's research projects. Our professors reflect the Laboratory‚Äôs diverse scope of intellectual interests, and are drawn from nine MIT academic departments and divisions: * Biological Engineering Division * Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science * Department of Materials Science and Engineering * Department of Mathematics * Department of Mechanical Engineering * Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering * Department of Physics * Engineering Systems Division * Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology Over three hundred MIT graduate and undergraduate students‚Äîalso drawn from the MIT departments and divisions above‚Äîmake RLE one of the primary environments for student learning at MIT.

Mayr was particularly known as the man who introduced Hitler to politics. In 1919, Mayr directed Hitler to write the Gemlich letter, in which Hitler first expressed his anti-semitic views in writing. Mayr later became Hitler's opponent, and wrote in his memoirs that General Erich Ludendorff had personally ordered him to have Hitler join the German Workers' Party (DAP) and build it up. As far as it is known, his last rank was major. In 1933, he fled to France after the Nazis came to national power. Mayr was tracked down by the Gestapo, arrested, imprisoned, and later murdered at the Buchenwald Concentration Camp in 1945. A fact-based portrayal of Mayr is dramatized in the 2002 film Max, a fictional account of Hitler's life in Munich just prior to joining the German Workers' Party. Life and work Mayr was the son of a magistrate. After graduating from high school, he was enrolled on 14 July 1901 in the 1st Bavarian Infantry Regiment in Munich as a cadet. Well regarded by his superiors, he made rapid progress, becoming Leutnant in 1903 and Oberleutnant in 1911. From August 1914 Mayr was with the 1st Bayerischen J√§gerbattailon. During the First World War he was in combat in Lorraine and Flanders and involved in early 1915 with the German Alpine Corps. On 1 June 1915 Mayr was promoted to Hauptmann (captain). In 1917, he was named on the General Staff of the Alpine Corps. On 13 March 1918 he was appointed commander of the 1st Bavarian J√§gerbattailon, with whom he served in the Eastern Army Group in Turkey from 20 July to 15 October 1918. Shortly after the war, from 1 December 1918, Mayr acted as company commander in the 1st Bavarian Infantry Regiment in Munich. On 15 February 1919 he was on leave from the military, but returned in May as commander of the 6th Battalion of the guards regiment in Munich and from 30 May as head of the \\"Education and Propaganda Department\\" of the General Command von Oven and the Group Command No. 4 (Department Ib) under Lieutenant-General von M√∂hl. In his capacity as head of the intelligence department, Mayr recruited Adolf Hitler as an undercover agent in early June 1919. Hitler's role involved informing on soldiers suspected of communist sympathies. Hitler took part in \\"national thinking\\" courses at the Reichswehrlager Lechfeld near Augsburg which were organized by the Bavarian Reichswehr under Captain Mayr. Mayr believed demoralized and Bolshevized forces should be taught national sentiments. After this training Mayr issued Hitler the order to become \\"anti-Bolshevik educational speaker\\" to the soldiers at the Munich barracks. Furthermore, Hitler was sent as an observer to the numerous meetings of the various newly formed political parties in Munich. Hitler spent much time at the meetings and wrote reports on the political ideas, goals and methods of the groups. This included studying the activities of the DAP (German Workers' Party). Hitler became impressed with founder Anton Drexler's antisemitic, nationalist, anti- capitalist and anti-Marxist ideas. Drexler was impressed with Hitler's oratory skills and invited him to join the DAP, which Hitler accepted on 12 September 1919. After attending a further meeting on 3 October, Hitler stated to Mayr in his report \\"must join this club or party, as these were the thoughts of the soldiers from the front-line\\". In March 1920, Mayr sent Hitler, Dietrich Eckart and Ritter von Greim to Berlin to observe at close range the events of the Kapp Putsch. On 8 July 1920, Mayr was released from military service as a major of the General Staff of the military district commands VII, but reappeared in September 1920 as commander of Section I b/P of army intelligence. Mayr in 1921 was a Nazi Party supporter, but later became a critic. In 1925 he joined the SPD. Subsequently he was the leader and editor of the Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold, an SPD paramilitary force. In the early 1930s, Mayr collected among other things, information on Georg Bell, an associate of Ernst R√∂hm, and other material against the Nazi Party, which he leaked in the Social Democratic press. After 1933, Karl Mayr emigrated to France. After the German invasion of France in 1940, he was arrested in Paris by the Gestapo. Mayr was taken back to Germany and was incarcerated in Sachsenhausen concentration camp until 1943, when he was transferred to Buchenwald concentration camp and forced to work at the Gustloff ammunition plant, where on 9 February 1945 he was killed.

Service catalogs act as knowledge management tools for the employees and consultants of an enterprise, allowing them to route their requests for and about services and services related topics to the subject matter experts who own, are accountable for, and operate them. Each service within such service catalogs is usually very repeatable and has controlled inputs, processes, and outputs. Service catalogs also allow leadership and management, for example the Chief Operations Officer (COO), to compartmentalize the enterprise into highly structured and more efficient operational units, hence the descriptive phrase: \\"a service-oriented enterprise.\\"  Service centralization  A service catalog is a means of centralizing all services that are important to the stakeholders of the enterprises which implement and use it. Given its digital and virtual implementation, via software, the service catalog acts, at a minimum, as a digital registry and a means for highly distributed enterprises to see, find, invoke, and execute services regardless of where they exist in the world. This means that people in one part of the world can find and utilize the same services that people in other parts of the world use, eliminating the need to develop and support local services via a federated implementation model. Centralizing services also acts as a means of identifying service gaps and redundancies that can then be addressed by the enterprise to improve itself.  Service catalog composition  Service catalogs are implemented in a manner that facilitate the registration, discovery, request, execution, and tracking of desired services for catalog users. Each service within the catalog typically includes traits and elements such as: * Clear ownership of and accountability for the service (a person and often an organization) * A name or identification label for the service * A description of the service * A service categorization or type that allows it to be grouped with other similar services * Related service request types * Any supporting or underpinning services * Service level agreement (SLA) data and information that helps service providers set expectations for their service requestors * Who is entitled to request/view the service * Associated costs (if any) * How to request the service and how its delivery is fulfilled * Escalation points and key contacts The more descriptive the service details are, the easier it is for end users of the service catalog to find and invoke the services they desire.  Catalog categories  A service catalog is commonly structured in a manner where its registered services are categorized. A large percentage of Categories for services are derived from the areas of an enterprise and the functions it performs, such as Information Technology, Operations, and Fulfillment. Examples of common service categories include Marketing Services, Product Development Services, Fulfillment Services, and Support Services, which are consumed and performed by most businesses. The purpose of categorization of services is to facilitate service curation, such as how books may be curated in a library.  Resource management  The utilization of service catalogs allow enterprises to allocate and track resources, both human and systemic, which are required for successful service delivery, operations, and support. This allows enterprises to understand where resources are allocated, whether there are too many or too few resources allocated, and whether or not the resources allocated are adequate for purpose. It also allows an understanding of what resources are shared between multiple services versus those that are fully dedicated to a single service.  Metrics driven transparency  Benefits of implementing and maintaining a service catalog include allowing an enterprise to track and manage metrics that represent the utilization of services and service-related traits, such as those associated with service supply and demand. For example, enterprises can track and measure: * Services that are most and least used (i.e. enterprise service demand) * Services that are successfully delivering versus those that struggle to deliver (i.e. enterprise service supply) * How many service requests are being invoked for each service (i.e. service-specific demand) * How many service deliverables are making it to their targeted service requestors (i.e. service-specific supply) * Who invokes what services most or least * How much time it takes to approve service requests * How much time it takes to deliver service outputs, once requests are approved * Service finances, such as how much is spent on each service by those who invoke them and those who provide them In addition to the above, a service catalog also helps leadership and management better see and understand correlations of service related work, assets, and resources to the people, organizations, and projects that request them.  IT service catalog  An IT service catalog is a subset of an enterprise service catalog and is defined by the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), by the book Service Design, to be an exhaustive list of IT-only services that an organization provides or offers to its employees or customers. The catalog is the only part of the Service Portfolio that is published to customers and is used to support the sale and/or delivery of IT services.  A user's perspective  A user goes to a website to search for a specific service, such as requesting a new laptop, requesting a change in benefits, or adding a new employee to a department. The service catalog site groups services by category and allows for searching (especially when hundreds or thousands of services are available). The user selects a desired service and sees the description and details. The user enters any pertinent information (contact information, service-specific questions) and submits the request for service. The request requires approval, and goes through routing, service-level management, and other processes necessary to fulfill the request. The user may return to the site later to check on the status of a request, or to view overall metrics on how well the organization is performing the services it provides.  A business unit manager's perspective  Business Unit Managers determine what services to \\"publish\\" to end-users via the service catalog. Business Unit Managers and Analysts would determine what questions are to be asked of the user, any approvals necessary for a request, and what other systems or processes are needed to fulfill the request. Once the service is defined and the fulfillment process organized, these people or a more technical employee would build the requisite functionality into the service definition and then publish this to the service catalog.  Service catalogs for cloud computing services  The use of a service catalog for cloud computing services is an integral part of deploying services on private and public clouds. Users wishing to consume cloud services would use a cloud service catalog to view what cloud services are available, their function, and know the technologies used to provide the services. Onisick, Joe. Private cloud success factors include service catalog, Network Computing, January 05, 2012 Users would also see the available different service level options based on latency and reliability. With this knowledge, users are able to change the configuration of the technologies used to deliver the services based on cost, performance and technology improvements. By seeing and understanding the different services available through the cloud users can better appreciate what is available to them, compared to traditional IT whereby one group of users or business unit may be unaware of the technologies available to another unit. Accessed by self-service portals, service catalogs contain a list of cloud services from which cloud consumers select for self-provisioning of cloud services.Miller, Rich. Cisco buys NewScale for cloud service catalogs, Datancenterknowledge.com, March 29, 2011 This removes the need for users to work through various IT departments in order to provision a cloud service, nor are users required to provide detailed IT specifications. They are only required to provide business and organization requirements. To make selection easier and to speed service deployment, service definitions are often standardized in cloud service catalogs. This presents three benefits: improved capacity planning, particularly if standard components are used; quicker service provisioning; and better buying forecasts which helps to lower costs.Flores, Rodrigo. The competitive threat of public clouds, Datacenterknowledge.com, June 4, 2010. Automation is an aspect of cloud service catalog that has been noted.

Life He was born, according to his epitaph, on 26 Sept. 1593, was fifth and youngest son of Sir John Osborne of Chicksands Priory, Shefford, Bedfordshire, by his wife Dorothy, daughter and coheiress of Richard Barlee, esq., of Effingham Hall, Essex. Sir John Osborne was son of Peter Osborne.:s:Osborne, Francis (1593-1659) (DNB0) Francis was educated privately at Chicksands. Coming to London as a youth, he hung about the court, and attracted the notice of William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, who made him his master of the horse. Subsequently, he was for a time employed in the office of the lord treasurer's remembrancer, which was presided over successively by his father and his eldest brother Peter. In politics and religion he sympathised with the popular party in parliament; but, although a close observer of public life, took no active part in it. After residing for a time at North Fambridge, Essex, he removed about 1650 to Oxford, to superintend the education of his son, John, and there printed a series of historical, political, and ethical tracts. He married Anna, sister of William Draper, colonel in the parliamentary army, and a parliamentary visitor of the university. They had three daughters, as well as one son John, to whom his Advice to a Son was written. Through Draper's influence Osborne obtained a small official employment under the Commonwealth. After the publication of his Advice to a Son in 1656, he gained a wide reputation, and paid many visits to London, he reckoned the philosopher Thomas Hobbes among his friends. He died at Draper's house at Nether Worton, near Deddington, Oxfordshire, on 11 February 1659, and was buried in the church there. His son John Osborne moved to Ireland, where he became Prime Serjeant, and died there in 1692. Advice to a Son Francis Osborne's chief publication was his Advice to a Son, in two parts, of which the first was published in 1656, 'printed for H. Hath, printer to the university for Thomas Robinson,' and the second in 1658. The first part, which was divided into five sections, headed Studies, Love and Marriage, Travel, Government, and Religion, appeared without an author's name; it became popular at once, and after it had passed through five editions within two years Osborne declared himself the author. In 1658 the second part appeared, and he dedicated it under his own name to Draper, at the same time issuing a new edition of the first part, with his name on the title-page. The warnings against women with which he plied his son give the book a misogynist character, and it was ridiculed by John Heydon in his Advice to a Daughter, in opposition to Advice to a Son, 1658. A defence of Osborne appeared in Advice to Balaam's Ass, by Thomas Pecke, whom Heydon castigated in a second edition of his Advice to a Daughter, 1659. In Osborne's day his Advice to a Son found admirers among the young scholars at Oxford, but the clergy detected atheism in its vague references to religion, and denounced its evil influence. On 27 July 1658 the vice-chancellor, John Conant, accordingly summoned the Oxford booksellers before him, and told them sell no more copies of Osborne's book; but this direction caused the Advice, according to Anthony √† Wood, to sell far more copies. At a later date Samuel Pepys studied it, and Sir William Petty told him that the three most popular books of his time were Osborne's Advice, Thomas Browne's Religio Medici, and Samuel Butler's Hudibras. Jonathan Swift wrote of Osborne in The Tatler as one who affected the phrases in fashion at court in his day, and soon became either unintelligible or ridiculous. James Boswell found the Advice shrewd, quaint, and lively; but Samuel Johnson told Boswell that Osborne was conceited: \\"Were a man to write so now, the boys would throw stones at him.\\" Other works His Traditional Memoirs of the Reigns of Q. Elizabeth and King James I, 1658, supplies court gossip. This tract was reprinted by Sir Walter Scott in his Secret History of James I (Edinburgh, 1811). Other works by Osborne were: 1. A Seasonable Expostulation with the Netherlands, declaring their Ingratitude to and the Necessity of their Agreement with the Commonwealth of England, Oxford, 1652. 2. Persuasive to mutual Compliance under the present Government, and Plea for a Free State compared with Monarchy, 1652. 3. Political Reflections upon the Government of the Turks, with 'discourses' on Machiavelli, Luther, Nero's death, and other topics, 1656. 4. Miscellany of sundry Essays, Paradoxes, Problematical Discourses, Letters, and Characters, together with political Deductions from the History of the Earl of Essex,' London, 1659. All these works were subsequently bound together, and entitled Osborne's Works. The collective edition of 1673 was brought to the notice of the House of Lords on 13 March 1676, on the ground that its incidental vindication of a republican form of government in England rendered it a seditious and treasonable publication. Reissues followed in 1682 (8th edit.), 1689 (9th edit.), 1701 (10th edit.), and 1722, in 2 vols. (11th edit.) To the last are prefixed a memoir of Osborne and many previously unprinted letters addressed by him to Colonel Draper between 1653 and 1658. Osborne has also been credited, apparently wrongly, with Private Christian's non ultra, or a Plea for the Layman's interpreting the Scriptures, Oxford, 1650, (anon.); with A Dialogue of Polygamy (London, 1657), translated from the Italian of Bernardino Ochino by 'a person of quality', and dedicated to the author of the Advice; and William Sprigge's A modest Plea for an equal Commonwealth against Monarchy.

It is a satire on the 1960s media-influenced phenomenon of Swinging London. It was written by George Melly and directed by Desmond Davis. The supporting cast includes Ian Carmichael, Michael York, Jeremy Lloyd, Anna Quayle, Irene Handl, Arthur Mullard and Geoffrey Hughes. Plot Brenda (Rita Tushingham) and Yvonne (Lynn Redgrave), two girls from the North of England, arrive in London to seek fame and fortune. However, their image of the city is quickly tarnished when they are robbed of their savings by a tramp. Determined not to let her chance slip, Yvonne visits Carnaby Street in the hope of catching the eye of a trendy photographer, whilst Brenda has to stay behind and do the washing up in a greasy spoon cafe after the girls cannot afford to pay. Yvonne does get spotted by a trendy photographer, Tom Wabe (Michael York), but is singled out for being poorly dressed. After several unsuccessful job attempts, she accidentally wins the star prize in a television game show and decides to invest the prize money in becoming a pop star. Her single, \\"I'm So Young\\", though patently awful, becomes a big hit and she and Brenda drift apart. As Tom Wabe's muse, Brenda goes on to become a top model, while Yvonne's popularity wanes. However, at a glamorous party at the top of the Post Office Tower, the girls realise the shallowness of the media business and decide to return home.

Similarly, Murray Melvin and Paul Danquah, Tushingham's co-stars in A Taste of Honey, appear in cameo roles as boutique shop customers. Geoffrey Hughes, later to become familiar to millions as Eddie Yeats in Coronation Street, appears as a workman. The then-popular BBC series Juke Box Jury is parodied as Hi-Fi Court, and the UK version of the hidden camera series Candid Camera is parodied as You Can't Help Laughing! Private Eye magazine at the time referred to the Queen and Princess Margaret as, respectively, Brenda and Yvonne. Some of the characters' names are borrowed from Lewis Carroll's poetry, chiefly the nonsense poem Jabberwocky: Charlotte Brillig, Tom Wabe, Mrs Gimble, Bobby Mome-Rath, Jeremy Tove, Toni Mimsy, and The Snarks (the rock band played by Tomorrow). Additionally, the futuristic art exhibition is held at the Jabberwock Gallery. The film was nominated for a Golden Globe (Best English-Language Foreign Film) in 1968. The theme tune was sung by Tushingham and Redgrave, who also performed several of the numbers in the film. In the 1993 BBC series Hollywood UK, about the British film industry in the 1960s, the actresses appeared in the back of a London taxi singing the theme again. Reception The film performed poorly at the box office and ABC recorded a loss of $710,000. The film critic Alexander Walker noted that the film arrived too late to parody 'Swinging London' as the fad was already dead.Walker, Alexander (1974) Hollywood England: The British Film Industry in the Sixties, Michael Joseph.

Minogue is Chairman, CEO & President of the company, with Dr. Thorsten Siess as Chief Technology Officer, Dr. Chuck Simonton as Chief Medical Officer and Dr. David M. Weber as Chief Operating Officer. According to Bloomberg, the company \\"engages in the research, development, and sale of medical devices to assist or replace the pumping function of the failing heart. It also provides continuum of care to heart failure patients\\".https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=247589 As of 2019, the company had secured five FDA approvals and 715 patents with 622 pending. For fiscal year 2019, Abiomed reported $769.4 million in revenue and reported diluted earnings per share was $5.61 for the year.\\"Abiomed FY 2019 Annual Report,\\" Abiomed.com, retrieved July 29, 2010.  History  Abiomed was founded in Danvers, Massachusetts by David M. Lederman in 1981 as Applied Biomedical Corporation. That year, the company commenced the development of an artificial heart. Funded by federal research grants, Lederman partnered with The Texas Heart Institute to develop the AbioCor, a grapefruit-sized electromagnetic device with an internal battery that completely replaces the heart without wires or tubes passing through the skin. In July 2001, AbioCor became the first artificial heart successfully implanted in a patient, where it pumped more than 20 million times. Fourteen of the AbioCor devices were implanted, during clinical trials from 2001 to 2004, with the longest-living recipient surviving 512 days. The AbioCor won FDA approval in 2006 for patients who are near death and do not qualify for a heart transplant. In 2004, Michael R. Minogue became president and CEO of Abiomed. In 2005, Abiomed purchased ventricular assist device company Impella CardioSystems AG of Aachen, Germany, maker of the Impella heart pump, developed by Thorsten Siess, who is now the Chief Technology Officer at Abiomed. After Abiomed acquired Impella the company‚Äôs focus shifted from heart replacement to heart recovery. In July 2014, Abiomed acquired German heart pump maker ECP in a deal worth up to $30 million. The deal included a nearly $2.8 million buyout of AIS GmbH Aachen Innovative Solutions, which owns some of the patents licensed to ECP. In May 2018, Abiomed was added to the S&P; 500 index.\\"Abiomed (ABMD) to Replace Wyndham in the S&P; 500 Benchmark,\\" Nasdaq.com, retrieved August 9, 2020. During the S&P;‚Äôs rise from 2000 to 3000, Abiomed was the index‚Äôs top performing stock. In 2018, Abiomed built a $17 million Innovation Center to facilitate research and product development. The 29,800-square-foot facility features laboratories for blood, optical, software, mechanical and electrical research, plus a production line. In 2019, Barron's ranked Abiomed the 4th best stock of the 2010s, with total return of 1,983%. while Fortune ranked Abiomed 19th on the magazine‚Äôs list of 100 fastest-growing companies. In April 2020, Abiomed acquired Breethe, developer of a novel extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) system. Impella products Impella is the world‚Äôs smallest heart pump. It sits in the heart, spinning up to 50,000 revolutions per minute, sending blood throughout the body, allowing the heart to recover. It is inserted through a minimally invasive procedure and guided through an artery to the heart. In 2007, the Impella 2.5 heart pump was among 35 healthcare products to receive a 2007 Medical Design Excellence Award. As of August 2020, the Impella heart pump products include the Impella 2.5, Impella 5.0/LD, Impella CP with SmartAssist, Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist, Impella RP and Impella Connect. Since 2005 when Abiomed acquired the Impella technology, the heart devices have received a series of FDA approvals. Notably, in 2015, Abiomed received FDA approval to use the Impella 2.5 heart pump during elective and urgent high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention procedures. In 2016, the Impella RP system became the first percutaneous single-access heart pump designed for right- heart support to receive FDA approval.Alexandra Pecci, \\"Impella Heart Pump by Abiomed,\\" Northshore Magazine, February 25, 2016. The FDA approval was based on the PROTECT II randomized controlled trial, which found high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients who underwent PCI with Impella had fewer major adverse events at 90 days, compared to patients who underwent PCI with the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). A 2020 study of 21,848 non-emergent, high-risk patients who underwent PCI with percutaneous ventricular assist devices (PVADs), including Impella, demonstrated the PVAD patients had a lower rate of mortality and complications than patients who underwent PCI with IABPs. As of 2020, the Impella heart pump is the most studied mechanical circulatory support device in the history of the FDA with more than 14 years of studies, clinical data on more than 140,000 patients, and more than 650 peer-reviewed publications. Leadership Michael R. Minogue, Chairman, CEO & President, took over as chief executive in 2004 when Abiomed‚Äôs founder, David Lederman, stepped down. Minogue is a former Army Ranger and Operation Desert Storm veteran with an engineering degree from West Point and an MBA from the University of Chicago. Prior to Abiomed, Minogue spent eleven years with General Electric Healthcare. Minogue helped found the Medical Technology Veterans Program (MVP), a career training and mentorship initiative designed to help veterans entering the civilian workforce transition into jobs in the medical device and life sciences industries, and also serves on the boards of directors for the medical device industry association AdvaMed, Insulet Corporation, and the Medical Device Innovation Consortium.

Life and career Charles H. Taylor was born in Manchester, the son of a silk merchant. He followed his father into the trade and remained there until his late thirties. His friend Robert Courtneidge was a producer at a local theatre, and Taylor supplied some topical lyrics for a pantomime production there. This eventually led to continued contributions of lyrics, and so Taylor quit the silk business to begin writing lyrics full-time for popular music.\\"Charles H. Taylor\\", British Musical Theatre at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, adapted from The Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre by Kurt G√§nzl, accessed 6 September 2006 After writing the lyrics for his first production for London's West End, The Silver Slipper, Taylor became a popular lyricist. He supplied lyrics for Seymour Hicks's Bluebell in Fairyland (1901), which became the most successful children's entertainment of the era and was revived annually for the next four decades. During the next few years, he contributed lyrics to Sidney Jones's comedy opera My Lady Molly (1902),(James) Sidney Jones, The Guide to Light Opera and Operetta, accessed 9 June 2019 George Edwardes's production of The Girl from Kays, The Medal and the Maid (1903),The Medal and the Maid, The Guide to Light Opera and Operetta, accessed June 9, 2019 and Leslie Stuart's The School Girl (1903).\\"The School Girl\\", the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 9 March 2017, accessed 9 June 2019 After the success of Bluebell in Fairyland, the Seymour Hicks/Charles Frohman organisation hired him as its chief lyricist.

His last work, Tom Jones, was a collaboration with Courtneidge, who had co-written an opera libretto adaptation of Henry Fielding's novel The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling. Taylor supplied the lyrics, and Edward German wrote the music. Some of the songs such as \\"For Tonight\\" (sometimes recorded as \\"The Tom Jones Waltz\\"), \\"The Green Ribbon\\", and \\"The West Country Lad\\" proved to be some of the most popular of Taylor's and German's work. The work eventually became popular among amateur light opera groups. Taylor died at the age of 47 while working on his first musical comedy libretto. A song from that work, \\"Dream 'o Day Jill\\", became a special addition to Tom Jones to celebrate the 100th night of its run.

Travel documents usually assure other governments that the bearer may return to the issuing country, and are often issued in booklet form to allow other governments to place visas as well as entry and exit stamps into them. The most common travel document is a passport, which usually gives the bearer more privileges like visa-free access to certain countries. However, the term is sometimes used only for those documents which do not bear proof of nationality, such as a refugee travel document. Passport In general, a passport is a travel document that also serves as proof of nationality from the issuing country. Although generally accepted by the majority of countries in the world, some issuing countries expressly exclude the validity of passports from nations that are not recognized by their governments. Non-citizen passports =United Kingdom= Due to the United Kingdom's legacy as an imperial power, British nationality law is unusually complex compared to other countries with multiple classes of nationality. People who resided in British Hong Kong before the Hong Kong Handover in 1997 who registered as a British National (Overseas) are entited to a British National (Overseas) passport which has some restrictions over a regular British Passport issued to British Citizens. People who are not citizens of the United Kingdom but are citizens of a British Overseas Territory can apply for a passport issued by their local governments, such as the Gibraltarian passport for citizens of Gibraltar. British subjects can also apply for a British passport. =Latvia and Estonia= Non-citizens in the now independent Republics of Latvia and Estonia are individuals, primarily of Russian or Ukrainian ethnicity, who are not citizens of Latvia or Estonia but whose families have resided in the area since the Soviet era of forcible annexation (1940‚Äì1990), and thus have the right to a non-citizen passport issued by the Latvian government as well as other specific rights. Approximately two thirds of them are ethnic Russians, followed by ethnic Belarussians, ethnic Ukrainians, ethnic Poles and ethnic Lithuanians.Population of Latvia by ethnicity and nationality; Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs 2015 Non-citizens in the two countries are issued special non-citizen passportssee para. 16 of the Resolution on national minorities OSCE PA, 2004 as opposed to regular passports issued by the Estonian and Latvian authorities to citizens. This form of legal discrimination is often labelled as xenophobic.Report on mission to Latvia (2008), UN Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance ‚Äî see Para. 30 and 88 =American Samoa= Although all U.S. citizens are also U.S. nationals, the reverse is not true. As specified in , a person whose only connection to the U.S. is through birth in an outlying possession (which is defined in as American Samoa and Swains Island (which is administered as part of American Samoa)), or through descent from a person so born, acquires U.S. nationality but not U.S. citizenship. This was formerly the case in only four other current or former U.S. overseas possessions.In the Panama Canal Zone only those persons born there prior to January 1, 2000 with at least one parent as a U.S. citizen were recognized as U.S. citizens and were both nationals and citizens. Also in the former Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands the residents were considered nationals and citizens of the Trust Territory and not U.S. nationals. The U.S. passport issued to non-citizen nationals contains the endorsement code 9 which states: \\"THE BEARER IS A UNITED STATES NATIONAL AND NOT A UNITED STATES CITIZEN.\\" on the annotations page. Non-citizen U.S. nationals may reside and work in the United States without restrictions, but must apply for citizenship under the same rules as resident aliens. Like resident aliens, they are not presently allowed by any U.S. state to vote in federal or state elections, although, as with resident aliens, there is no constitutional prohibition against their doing so. Laissez-passer and emergency passports A \\"special pass\\" issued for travel in Boulogne, France by the British Red Cross during World War I A laissez-passer (French for \\"let pass\\") is a travel document issued by a national government or certain international organizations, such as the United Nations, European Union and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). A laissez-passer is often for one-way travel to the issuing country for humanitarian reasons only such as Restoring Family Links. Some national governments issue laissez-passers to their own nationals as emergency passports. Others issue them to people who are stateless, or who are unable to obtain a passport from their own government, or whose government is not recognized by the issuing country. One such example is the People's Republic of China, which issues the non-passport Chinese Travel Document to its nationals under certain circumstances. One such circumstance stems from a reported loss of passport while traveling or living abroad. China issues a temporary two-year validity Travel Document in lieu of a passport to allow said citizen to complete their travels and return to China to apply for a replacement Chinese passport. Under other circumstances such as a Chinese citizen studying or working abroad, the Chinese embassies or consulates will issue passports if requested. The Chinese Travel Document is a blue-covered passport-sized booklet clearly denoted \\"Travel Document\\" as opposed to the usual red-covered passport. Historically, laissez-passers were commonly issued during wartime and at other periods, literally acting as a pass to allow travel to specific areas, or out of war zones or countries for various officials, diplomatic agents, other representatives or citizens of third countries. In these contexts, a laissez-passer would frequently include quite specific and limited freedom of movement. The form and issuing authority would be more or less standardized, depending on the circumstances. An example is when in the early 1950s, the Iraqi government granted permission to its 120,000 Jewish citizens to leave (Operation Ezra and Nehemiah), conditional on their renouncing their citizenship and leaving behind all their properties and assets. The travel document that was issued was the laissez-passer, since an Iraqi passport was no longer possible. Laissez-passer documents may also be issued to goods or other non-living objects to facilitate their transport across international borders. For instance, the Agreement on the Transfer of Corpses sets out rules whereby human corpses may be issued laissez-passer documents in order for a body to be buried or cremated in a country different from the one in which the person died. Israeli travel documents Travel document issued in 1949 by the legation in Bucharest for a one-way trip to Israel The Israeli authorities maintain a unique system of travel documents issued to non-Israeli permanent residents, such as those living in East- Jerusalem outside Palestinian Authority-administered areas, Syrians residing in the Golan Heights, and to certain Israeli citizens. Naturalised Israeli citizens People who immigrate to Israel are generally not eligible for an Israeli passport until they have resided in Israel for at least 75% of their first year of citizenship. Such citizens are issued a \\"travel document in lieu of national passport\\" in their first year of citizenship. UN travel documents The United Nations and the International Labour Organization issue laissez-passers to officials and members of the UN and other specialized agencies as well as to several international organizations. The laissez-passer is also issued to their families for official use. The United Nations laissez- passer is similar to a passport, and is generally recognized worldwide, although some countries will not accept the document as sufficient to gain entry. It does not generally confer diplomatic immunity, but may confer limited immunities and privileges. Between 2000 and 2010, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) issued travel documents to residents of Kosovo as they were often not able to obtain a passport through other channels. Aliens and refugees German 1954 Convention Travel Document An Argentinian C√©dula de identidad, also valid for travel in other South American countries * Refugee travel document (formally: 1951 Convention travel document) are passport-like booklets issued by national governments to refugees under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. * 1954 Convention travel documents are similar documents issued to stateless persons under the 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons. The document is the successor of the (now defunct) League of Nations' Nansen passport. * Alien's passports and certificates of identity are passport-like booklets issued by national governments to resident foreigners, other than those issued under the 1951 and 1954 conventions mentioned above. However, some governments issue certificates of identity to their own nationals as emergency passports. Other documents as travel documents Several other groups of documents issued for a different purpose officially serve as travel documents, generally for a limited set of countries. Such documents (when allowing full border crossing -exiting one country, and entering another- only) are discussed below: National identity card Identity cards are generally issued as a means of identification within a country, but in some cases they may also be used as a travel document. For example, EU, EEA and Swiss citizens can use their national identity cards to exercise their right of free movement in the EU, EEA and Switzerland without a visa. They can also visit most other countries in Europe as well as a few countries and territories outside Europe. Similarly, citizens of most South American countries can use their ID cards for travel between the countries. A U.S. passport card can be regarded an identity card fit for terrestrial international travel, particularly in North America. Driver's licence Driver's licenses are generally not considered travel documents, since they bear no information on nationality and conditions which would lead to refusal of a travel document have generally not been tested. However, in several provinces of Canada and U.S. states, nationals/citizens can ‚Äî upon payment of an extra fee and the provision of additional information ‚Äî receive an enhanced driver's license which enables border crossing between Canada and the U.S. by land and sea. De facto travel documents De facto travel documents are documents which in practice will be sufficient to cross borders legally, but with no legal status as a travel document. Within the Border Controls in the Common Travel Area, travel between Ireland, the United Kingdom, the British Crown Dependencies, Isle of Man and Channel Islands, no travel documents are required by British or Irish citizens. As this requirement does not hold for others, these citizens have to establish the presumption of having this nationality, which requires in practice some form of identification. The documents used for this purpose (most notably: driving licence) are thus de facto travel documents. Some airlines still require passport from CTA citizens. The Nordic Passport Union means that Nordic citizens (of Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Iceland) can stay in all those countries (on the paper) without any I.D., in the same way as in the home country. In reality an I.D. card is needed for travel and other situations, and any Nordic I.D. card is valid in the area for travel purposes (but not for residence, e.g. banking or authority contacts). Other means of identification Strictly speaking, it is not necessary for an EU, EEA or Swiss citizen to possess a valid travel document (such as a national identity card or passport) to enjoy the right of free movement in the EU, EEA and Switzerland. In theory, if an EU, EEA or Swiss citizen can prove his/her nationality by 'any other means' (e.g., by presenting an expired national identity card or passport, or a citizenship certificate), he/she must be permitted to enter and reside in the EU, EEA and Switzerland without a visa. An EU citizen who is unable to demonstrate his/her nationality satisfactorily must nonetheless be given 'every reasonable opportunity' to obtain the necessary documents or to have them delivered within a reasonable period of time.Article 6.3.2 of the Practical Handbook for Border Guards (C (2006) 5186)Judgement of the European Court of Justice of 17 February 2005, Case C 215/03, Salah Oulane vs. Minister voor Vreemdelingenzaken en Integratie Gallery File:Us-passport.jpgCover of a travel document, in this case a US passport. image:OCI JK.jpgAn Overseas Citizen of India booklet is a travel document issued by India to foreign citizens of Asian origin exempting them from usual immigration controls in India.

Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter featuring Robert E. Howard's sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It was first published in paperback by Lancer Books, and has been reprinted a number of times since by various publishers. It has also been translated into German, Japanese, Spanish, Swedish and Dutch. It was later gathered together with Conan the Adventurer and Conan the Wanderer into the omnibus collection The Conan Chronicles 2 (1990). Plot summary Conan, now in his late thirties and privateer captain of the Wastrel, becomes embroiled in the politics of the kingdom of Zingara when he searches for a mythical treasure on the Nameless Isle. Mixed up in his adventure are Princess Chabela, daughter of a dying Zingaran king, the privateer Zarono, and the Stygian sorcerer Thoth-Amon. Chronologically, Conan the Buccaneer falls between \\"The Pool of the Black One\\" in Conan the Adventurer and \\"Red Nails\\" in Conan the Warrior. However, the present book ends with Conan as a successful captain, high in the favor of the royal family of Zingara, while \\"Red Nails\\" starts with him as a fugitive mercenary in the jungles south of Stygia. How Conan lost his ship, left the sea, and took up again the role of a mercenary is untold. Reception Critic Don D'Ammassa writes \\"I'd bet a lot of money that this Conan adventure was largely written by Lin Carter. It reflects his style and preoccupations a great deal more than it does those of de Camp, and it lacks the latter's light touch with the prose. ...

Early life He was born in Florida, a suburb to the west of Johannesburg, Transvaal (now part of the province of Gauteng). He was the only child of David Jakobus Engela (1895‚Äì1962) and Sophia Hendrina Fredrika Engela (1903‚Äì1991, n√©e Buys). His father was a teacher in the service of the Transvaal Education Department and, later, also a part-time lecturer in philosophy at the University of South Africa. His mother was an obstetric nurse and midwife. His parents, both members of the Gereformeerde Kerk, brought him up to be highly religious, an important fact which was reflected in various compositions. His father was of an artistic nature and was a self-taught musician and painter, and Dawid was encouraged to learn the piano formally. He took an early interest in African music and song and would attend Sunday afternoon church services in the African neighborhood to make closer acquaintance with the music of the people. This knowledge evidently contributed in later years to his decision to set two poems by Roy Campbell including The Zulu Girl to music; these poems describe typical Zulu characters. In 1947 he matriculated from Voortrekker High School, Boksburg, with a first-class pass and distinctions in Latin, Mathematics, Physical Science and Music. University and early broadcast work He registered in 1948 for a BA degree at Potchefstroom University. His subjects were Latin, Hebrew, Greek, Theology, Dutch and Afrikaans, and Music. He was also accompanist, soloist and pianist/conductor in the student orchestra. At this point Engela was aiming to enter the ministry, but soon realized that his future career lay in music. He nevertheless decided first to complete the year's study at Potchefstroom. In 1949 he registered for a three-year B.Mus. degree at the University of the Witwatersrand. His tutors were Prof. P. R. Kirby, Dr. W Paff and Adolph Hallis. Engela's long association with the broadcast media began on 1 December 1948, when he took a part-time job as an apprentice record program compiler in the SABC record library. He managed his time sufficiently well to pursue his full-time studies while having an income. In February 1950 he resigned from the SABC to pay more attention to his studies; nevertheless he handled the music column in the weekly SABC magazine, Radio, from June ‚Äì August 1950. At the end of 1951 he completed his B.Mus. studies and immediately (in November) rejoined the SABC, this time as announcer/producer. He held this post until May 1953. Vienna In May 1952 he met the young singer Mimi Coertse. They married on 25 July 1953. For this occasion he composed his so-called Wedding Cantata (Huwelikskantate). They wished to further their music studies in Vienna from January 1954, but first would undertake a tour of Europe. As a result they departed for London in September 1953 with individual two-year music bursaries of ¬£25 per annum awarded by the Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurverenigings (FAK ‚Äì Federation of Afrikaans Cultural Unions). Engela's chief goal for his studies in Vienna was to achieve a doctorate in musicology. He registered at the University of Vienna, and began his research under Prof. Erich Schenk. This would deal with 'Harmony in the music of the early seventeenth century, with particular reference to the works of Monteverdi, Sch√ºtz and Schein'. At the same time he registered at the Akademie f√ºr Musik und darstellende Kunst with a view to establishing himself generally as a musician. He took courses in piano accompaniment (with Alfred Uhl and later Karl Schiske) and composition and arrangement (with Hanns Jelinek and Paul Hindemith). Full-time study proved to be difficult, however, with Engela having to take a number of part-time broadcasting jobs to make ends meet. During this period his marriage to Mimi failed, and he moved instead to London to try to get a permanent broadcasting job. London and the BBC Engela's application for a permanent post at the BBC was successful and he was appointed from 1 September 1956 for a contract period of three years. Later it was extended and eventually he was in the service of the BBC for seven years, during which time he became a naturalised British citizen. Initially he worked in the Afrikaans Division and later in the Overseas Regional Service, as announcer, translator, programme compiler and drama organiser and producer, even occasionally doing duty as a sports commentator. In September 1956 Engela registered as a student at the Royal College of Music. He resumed his interrupted studies, taking composition with Herbert Howells, music criticism with Frank Howes and piano with Henry Brown. In April 1958 he passed the ARCM Performance Diploma examination with distinction. In the same year he also passed the written examination for the D.Phil. degree in music history. His plan was to complete his doctoral thesis within eighteen months. Its title was to be 'Periods of crisis in musical thought during the past millennium in Western civilisation and their relation to the present musical revolution'. In 1958 he met the Scottish contralto, Ruth Morrison, whom he married in December of that year. From this marriage two children were born, Charl (1960) and Jeannie (1961). This marriage also failed, however, and was finally dissolved in January 1967. In 1962 his father died. Engela and his family attended the funeral in South Africa. During this visit he wrote a children's book, Stories uit die Italiaanse Operas (Stories from the Italian Operas). The London period was filled with rich musical experiences, including the radio interviews that he conducted with the composers Aaron Copland, Iain Hamilton, Humphrey Searle, John Joubert and others. The first public performances of his compositions date from this period. Well-known South African performers such as Joyce Barker, Betsy De La Porte and Dawie Couzyn were involved. He also organised the entire London production of Bartho Smit's play The Maimed. The performance by the English Stage Society took place on Sunday, 27 November 1960, at the Royal Court Theatre. Return to South Africa At the end of August 1963 Engela left the BBC. During September the family moved to Cape Town where he took up the post of Music Organiser for the SABC on 1 October 1963. He held this post until February 1965 after which he began work as music manager of the Cape Performing Arts Board (CAPAB) in March 1965. He held this post until his death. On 1 September 1967 he married for a third time, this time to a person without musical training ‚Äì Ansie Fouch√©. He would not enjoy this marriage for long, however. On Saturday 25 November 1967 the couple left Cape Town for a short visit with his mother in Boksburg, before leaving on a long-planned overseas visit. Near Laingsburg Engela was killed instantly in a head-on collision with an oncoming car. His wife, who lost consciousness, died shortly afterwards.

It may be used in patients with epilepsy not responding to medical treatment, and who are potential candidates to receive brain surgery in order to control seizures. It may also be used in research to collect neural data from specific regions of the brain, such as from the auditory cortex for auditory stimulus reconstruction.H. Akbari, B. Khalighinejad, J. Herrero, A. Mehta, and N. Mesgarani, ‚ÄúReconstructing intelligible speech from the human auditory cortex,‚Äù bioRxiv, Jan. 2018. This technique was introduced in the diagnostic work up of patients with epilepsy by the group of the S. Anne Hospital, Paris, France, in the second half of the 20th century.Talairach J, Bancaud J, Szikla G, et al. Approche nouvelle de la neurochirugie de l‚Äôepilepsie. M√©thodologie st√©r√©rotaxique et r√©sultats th√©rapeutiques. Neurochirurgie (1974) 20 (Suppl. 1): 1-240. Intracerebral electrodes are placed within the desired brain areas to record the electrical activity during epileptic seizures, thus contributing to define with accuracy the boundaries of the \\"epileptogenic zone\\", i.e. the area of brain generating the seizures which should be eventually surgically resected to achieve freedom from epileptic seizures. Potential risks of the procedure, accounting for less than 1% of cases, include brain hemorrhage and infection, which can lead to permanent neurological impairment or death. For this reason, stereoelectroencephalography is reserved to selected and particularly complicated epilepsy cases.Cossu M, Cardinale F, Castana L, et al.

She was Lady of the Bedchamber, and the first woman private secretary, to Princess Alexandra of Denmark, later Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom, consort of Edward VII of the United Kingdom. Biography The daughter of Sir William Thomas Knollys, a successful military figure and Comptroller of the Household to Edward VII the Prince of Wales, and his wife, Elizabeth St. Aubyn, Charlotte Knollys was born in London on 5 January 1835. Her parents lived at 13 Portman St. in Marylebone.London, England, Church of England Births and Baptisms, 1813-1906; for Elizabeth Charlotte Knollys; Westminster St Marylebone; baptised 5 February 1835; born January 5, 1835 At 28, was sent into Alexandra's service as a Lady of the Bedchamber. The Princess of Wales came to rely heavily on her. By the late 1880s she began to perform duties as a private secretary. Alexandra required her services more when she was in mourning, for example when her beloved son, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence, died in 1892. Upon Edward's ascension to the throne, when Queen Victoria died in 1901, Charlotte was officially installed at Alexandra's side. The new King Edward VII granted her the style the Honourable and precedence as the daughter of a Baron, after her brother became Viscount Knollys. She performed all duties as private secretary and was also in Alexandra's complete confidence. However, this came at the price of having little freedom, a price which grew much more oppressive when Edward died in 1910. Alexandra, now Queen Dowager, shut herself away in seclusion at Sandringham House, in Norfolk, England, her favourite home. Charlotte wrote in a letter dated a year before Alexandra's death in 1925: > \\"H.M. is so fond of Sandringham...she readily falls in with the doctor's > advice that she should not tire herself with all the hurry and bustle of the > Season...As far as I'm concerned, I am a 'Cockney born and bred', and down > here I can never see my friends and relations and seem quite cut off from > all the world.\\" (Letter to an unknown Gentleman; Private Manuscript > collection) Later years Her leave of service came upon Alexandra's death in 1925. During her service, she was credited as the first woman private secretary to the Sovereign, and the first person not of royal blood to enter the Queen's boudoir without invitation. She was presented with a gold medal after saving Alexandra from a fire. Death She died, aged 95, unmarried, at her flat in South Audley Street, London in 1930.Civil Registration event: Death Name: KNOLLYS, Elizabeth C.; Registration District: St. George Hanover Square; County: London; Year of Registration: 1930; Quarter of Registration: Apr-May- Jun; Age at death: 95; Volume No: 1A/Page No: 449 as per death extract from GRO at Findmypast.co.uk, giving age at death as 95 See also * Knollys (family) References Category:1835 births Category:1930 deaths Category:People from Marylebone Category:Ladies of the Bedchamber Charlotte ","title":"Charlotte Knollys"},{"id":"6872971","text":"Roy Grow (1941 ‚Äì 2013) was the Kellogg Professor of International Relations at Carleton College before retiring in April 2013.

He said that his 1962 essay, Edmund Husserl's Origin of Geometry: An Introduction, already contained many elements of his thought, that would be further elaborated. He added: \\"that essay can be read as the other side (recto or verso, as you wish) of Speech and Phenomena.\\"Positions (1981), p. 5. On the relationship between his three foundational works of 1967, Derrida explained: \\" Speech and Phenomena is perhaps the essay which I like most. Doubtless I could have bound it as a long note to one or the other of the other two works. Of Grammatology refers to it and economizes its development. But in a classical philosophical architecture, Speech... would come first: in it is posed, at a point which appears juridically decisive for reasons that I cannot explain here, the question of the privilege of the voice and of phonetic writing in their relationship to the entire history of the West, such as this history can be represented by the history of metaphysics and metaphysics in its most modern, critical and vigilant form: Husserl's transcendental phenomenology.\\"Positions (1981), pp. 4‚Äì5 Contents #¬´Implications.

It is the most distinct of the Indian Ocean kestrels. It colonized its island home to evolve into a distinct species probably during the Gelasian (Late Pliocene Possibly to be moved to the Early Pleistocene. See Groombridge et al. (2002) for a thorough discussion of this species' recent evolutionary history.). It is the most distant living species among the western Indian Ocean kestrels (Groombridge et al. 2002, qv R√©union kestrel). By 1974 the Mauritius kestrel was close to extinction, with only four known birds including one breeding female. After a number of conservation efforts, by 2019 there was a population of about 400 birds. This conservation achievement is regarded as one of the most successful and best documented bird restoration projects in the world. Description Wild specimen It can reach a size between 26 and 30.5 cm. The weight is up to 250 grams. The males are slightly smaller than the females. Wingspan is approximately 45 cm and wings are rounded, unlike those of other falcons. The lifespan is 15 years in captivity. The Mauritius kestrel hunts by means of short, swift flights through forests. It is carnivorous, eating geckos, dragonflies, cicadas, cockroaches, crickets, and small birds. Conservation In pre-colonial time the population was estimated between 175 and 325 breeding pairs. This small population was caused most likely by deforestation in the 18th century and by cyclones. But the most severe decline was in the 1950s and 1960s due to indiscriminate DDT use and invasive species like cats, mongooses and crab-eating macaques which killed the kestrels and their eggs. What was probably this species' closest relative in Recent times, the R√©union kestrel, became extinct around 1700 for fairly mysterious reasons. The recorded population dropped to an all-time low of only 4 individuals in 1974 and it was considered the rarest bird in the world. Stanley Temple from Cornell University studied this species for two years and the first attempt in 1973 to breed the birds in captivity failed because the hatchling died when the incubator had a breakdown. Though conservation measures were immediately undertaken with the help of a breeding program by the Jersey Zoo (now Durrell Wildlife Park), the efforts to rescue this species initially failed because the eggs were not fertile. In 1979 a new attempt was undertaken. With the help of Gerald Durrell, the Welsh biologist Carl Jones established a wildlife sanctuary on Ile aux Aigrettes. He climbed on the trees and removed the eggs from the nests. This time the eggs were fertile, and Jones was able to rear the hatchlings in incubators. The wild kestrels' diet was supplemented so they would be able to lay a new egg after the first one was removed, averting any negative impact on the wild population. Slowly the population increased and during a census in 1984 50 individuals were estimated. Techniques for breeding, release, and \\"hacking\\" of young birds were improved, the captive breeding center becoming a pioneering research institution for tropical raptor and small falcon conservation. The captive breeding programme was scaled back in the early 1990s as a self-sustaining population was established. Since 1994, the programme serves only as a safeguard, should some catastrophe befall the wild population, and other rare endemics are now being cared for at the station (such as the pink pigeon or the Mauritius fody). Bird awaiting release, 1989 In 2005, there were at least 800 mature birds; it is estimated that the remaining habitat allows for a carrying capacity of maybe 50-150 more (BirdLife International 2006a,b). They occur in the remaining forests of the island, especially in the Black River Gorges region. The species was downlisted to vulnerable by the IUCN in 1994 as releases of captive-bred birds became unnecessary. Little conservation action was deemed necessary only two decades - in Mauritius kestrel terms, a long lifetime or maybe 4-5 generations - after the species had stood at the very brink of extinction. Today, apart from routine monitoring to be able to assist individual couples that fail to establish breeding territories for lack of nesting facilities - a major limiting factor, the ongoing control of introduced predators is basically all that is being done to assist the species' survival (BirdLife International 2006a,b). In 2014, the species was uplisted to endangered due to a decline in a once increasing population. It is believed that there are less than 400 mature birds alive in the wild. While some apparent inbreeding depression was noted in the captive birds, it was certainly lower than might be expected given that the effective population size was maybe 5 individuals during the mid-1970s. It is known that several genetic lineages of Mauritius kestrels have disappeared entirely during the 20th century population decline. However, the debilitating effects of DDT accumulation on the birds' health, and not inbreeding, are considered to have been the major cause for the failure of Temple's breeding program. The evolutionary history of the birds seems to hold clues as to why (Groombridge et al. 2002): Mauritius is a volcanic island, and although the colonization of the island by kestrels cannot be dated with high precision, it was almost certainly some time before volcanic activity died down. The Mauritius kestrel population seems to have survived a prolonged period of volcanic activity, which must have kept the population small and fluctuating as habitat, food, and kestrels were destroyed by volcanic eruptions time and again. As near-panmictic conditions were sustained for many generations, alleles that might cause inbreeding depression were steadily removed by means of natural selection. The phenomenon that effective population sizes as low as 4-5 can be tolerated without pronounced inbreeding depression is also known from other small-island birds, such as Petroica traversi or the Laysan duck. The classification as an endangered species is due to the same fact: on an island as small as Mauritius, chance events like volcanic eruptions (hardly likely in our time) or storms (common and possibly increasing in frequency and strength) can always wipe out major parts of a species' population (BirdLife International 2006a,b).

Club career Malta Barbara started his career as a youth player with Qormi. After having been spotted by scouts following some impressive displays, he earned a move to play in the Maltese Premier League with Floriana in July 1999. Early in his career with them, he was often used in defensive positions and although he played 74 games with the club he only managed eight goals ‚Äì all which were all scored during the 2001‚Äì02 season. In 2002, Barbara received his first call up to the Maltese national team due to a number of impressive performances for Floriana. With Barbara in high demand he moved on from Floriana after four years of service, and joined ambitious newly promoted club Marsaxlokk on 25 January 2003. He scored 21 goals in 43 games. Following two successful years, and a series of impressive displays with Marsaxlokk, Barbara earned a move to join up with Birkirkara in January 2005. In two seasons, Barbara managed 31 goals in 59 appearances with Birkirkara, but was forced to leave the club in July 2007, when he was and teammate Roderick Briffa were deemed surplus to requirements, following a major reshuffle in the playing staff the club. Barbara transferred from Birkirkara to Sliema Wanderers in July 2007, and signed a two-year deal, where he teamed up with former team mate Roderick Briffa who had joined earlier in the month. He remained with Malta‚Äôs most successful club for one season, making a total of 23 appearances and scoring eight goals, but indicated he would leave at the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season in order to pursue a career in Europe. Germany Barbara found his move to mainland Europe in the shape of German Regionalliga West (IV) side SC Verl, where he signed a two-year contract. He made his debut for Verl on 16 August 2008 in a league match against Bayer 04 Leverkusen II, being introduced in the second half as a 55th-minute substitute for Waldemar Jurez. During the 2008‚Äì09 winter break, League of Ireland First Division winners Dundalk made a move to take Barbara to play for them in the League of Ireland Premier Division. It is believed that Barbara was interested in the move, but with the player still under contract with SC Verl, the move did not materialize. Barbara played 1117 minutes for the SC Verl (not counting cup and preparation games), without scoring a single goal, and during the preparations for the 2009‚Äì10 season, he was dismissed with immediate effect for unexcused absence. Back to Malta Following his dismissal by Verl, Barbara was given a trial and took part in a pre-season tournament with English Football League Championship side Sheffield Wednesday, however he was not offered a contract. On 20 August 2009, it was announced that Barbara had joined Maltese Premier League champions Hibernians. Barbara had hoped to win a contract elsewhere in Europe, but after weeks of speculation and deals not materialising, this put a host of Maltese Premier League on alert. The first to express a strong interest where Floriana, with new manager Roddy Collins reportedly offering Barbara the option of linking him with a club in the United Kingdom in January. However Collins dropped his interest in Barbara on 20 August therefore he joined Hibernians, who were keen to sign him, likely to fill the void left by Terence Scerri, who joined Valletta. Barbara had an outstanding debut, scoring all three goals and winning the Man of the Match award in a 3‚Äì1 in over his former club Marsaxlokk. Later on the game was invalidated. North America Barbara joined United States USSF Division 2 club Carolina RailHawks on 25 February 2010. He scored two goals in his RailHawks debut on 10 April 2010, in a game against AC St. Louis.Etienne Barbara scores two goals in Carolina RailHawks debut Barbara double sinks St. Louis Barbara currently holds the record for most goals scored by a Carolina Railhawk in a single season for two consecutive years, scoring eight goals during the 2010 campaign, and breaking his own record with nine goals in the first seven matches of the 2011 campaign. Additionally, he is the clubs' all- time leading scorer. In August 2011, he was voted as offensive player of the month, just days after he scored a brilliant hat-trick. In October 2011, Etienne Barbara won the NASL Golden Ball, the award for the league‚Äôs most valuable player. Barbara received all nineteen first place votes cast by media from each NASL market. In his second season with the RailHawks, he scored 20 goals and had eight assists to win the NASL's Golden Boot. He was also named to the NASL Best XI. Due to Barbara's great form, he had been heavily linked with a move to the MLS or another high level league. Due to a MLS discovery claim, the rights to sign Barbara in MLS belonged to Montreal Impact through the 2012 season meaning that the club would be the only team in MLS able to sign him unless Montreal trades his rights, according to the league's discovery process. In an interview on 10 January 2012 Barbara revealed that talks with Montreal had stalled because he did not feel Montreal's contract offer was fair and that the club was stalling in signing him. Of the situation, Barbara said, \\"I felt they were wasting time because they were signing other players but they were in no rush to sign me because they already own my rights. They just weren‚Äôt getting back to me. It was frustrating....Now we are in January and as far as I'm concerned we are just wasting time. Plus, I can't talk to any other team because they own me. The problem is in the rules. America has everything that any other country in any other sport should envy. You have facilities and everything in your favor and then you have rules like that. Montreal made me a bad offer. Look, I've scored 20 goals and had 9 assists and I won the best player of the league. And for what? For nothing in America. Because I'm stuck with Montreal and they don't want to pay good money. From what I understand, they are just holding my rights to try to get the best offer from somebody else. How can Montreal own my rights without even talking to me or paying me anything? If they don't want me they should just release me but obviously they want money for me. But who gives the right for that club to own me? That happens only in America. To own me without even talking to me or paying any money to me?\\" On 17 January 2012, Montreal traded Barbara's MLS rights to Vancouver Whitecaps FC, then coached by former RailHawks coach Martin Rennie, in exchange for Gienir Garcia. He officially signed with Vancouver on 28 February 2012. His season was marred with injuries that kept him out action for a lot of the season. Eventually he was released by Vancouver on November after only two league appearances for the club. On 23 January, Barbara was one of six high-profile signings announced by Minnesota United. He was traded to Tampa Bay Rowdies on 1 August 2013 in exchange for forward Mike Ambersley.  International career  Barbara made his international debut for Malta during a UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying match away to Israel, which ended with an impressive 2‚Äì2 draw. He scored his first and second goals in the same match during the Malta International Tournament, when Malta defeated Estonia with a 5‚Äì2 scoreline. Barbara scored the third of his international goals in a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Bulgaria in a 1‚Äì1 draw, an equaliser to cancel out an earlier goal from Chavdar Yankov. Barbara has played as a midfielder, a striker, and a winger during his times with the national team, and is great at creating goal scoring opportunities.

He has worked on numerous television series and made-for-TV movies including The Day Reagan Was Shot, Falcon Crest, Into the West, and the controversial docudrama The Path to 9/11. He has also directed the theatrical features The Stoning of Soraya M. (2009), The Young Messiah (2016), and Infidel (2020). Early life and education Nowrasteh was born on 19 September 1956, in Boulder, Colorado, and grew up in Madison, Wisconsin. He is of Iranian descent, and his parents are Persian Bah√° º√≠sts.LIBERTAS ¬ª Blog Archive ¬ª Interview: Writer-Producer Cyrus Nowrasteh on his \\\\‚ÄùInto the West\\\\‚Äù & \\\\‚Äù9/11\\\\‚Äù Miniseries He graduated from Madison West High School in 1974 and was a city boys high school tennis champion.\\"Nikita Is A Gusher for West Grad.\\" The Capital Times, 8 July 1997. Nowrasteh attended New Mexico State University on an athletic scholarship and later transferred to the University of Southern California to attend the School of Cinematic Arts, graduating in 1977. Cyrus Nowrasteh and Betsy Giffen Nowrasteh in 2017. Career In 1986, Nowrasteh began his career by writing for the CBS television series The Equalizer. He went on to work on Falcon Crest as a producer and story editor, and wrote the pilot for the USA Network show La Femme Nikita (1996). He made his directorial debut with the Veiled Threat, a 1989 independent film based on the real-life murder of an Iranian journalist living in Orange County. The film was pulled from the AFI Film Festival after organizers received bomb threats, allegedly due to the film's criticism of anti-Khomeni themes. Nowrasteh subsequently accused the AFI of buckling to \\"censorship\\" and claimed their pulling the film \\"killed\\" its chances at distribution. He also worked on independent films such as the American/Brazilian production The Interview (1995), which played at Sundance and on the Showtime network; and Norma Jean, Jack and Me (1998), a film that was not theatrically released but played the festival circuit and aired on HDNet. In 2001, Nowrasteh wrote and directed the highly rated, award-winning Showtime presentation The Day Reagan Was Shot, which starred Richard Dreyfuss as Alexander Haig and was executive produced by Oliver Stone. The following year he wrote 10,000 Black Men Named George, the story of the Pullman strike of the 1930s, for Showtime. For both of the above films, Nowrasteh received the Pen USA West Literary Award for Best Teleplay‚Äîthe only writer in the history of the Pen awards to win two years in a row in the same category. The Day Reagan Was Shot also received the Eddie Award and the Golden Satellite Award for Best Motion Picture for Television, 2001, as well as a SAG nomination for Best Actor (Richard Dreyfuss). Nowrasteh wrote the \\"Manifest Destiny\\" episode of the highly regarded (16 Emmy nominations) Steven Spielberg and TNT miniseries presentation, Into the West. Nowrasteh wrote and produced the controversial ABC miniseries The Path to 9/11. He then went on to co-write (with his wife, Betsy Giffen Nowrasteh), and direct the film The Stoning of Soraya M., released in 2009 by Lionsgate Films. The Path to 9/11 The 2006 ABC miniseries The Path to 9/11 aired under much controversy. Critics said it fictionalized the lead-up to the 11 September 2001 attacks in order to direct blame to the Clinton administration. Although Nowrasteh's screenplay for The Path to 9/11 was billed by the ABC network as having been \\"based on the 9/11 Commission Report\\", there were accusations that the screenplay evidenced political bias because of its allegedly contrafactual portrayal of events.Edward Wyatt, New York Times Nowrasteh admitted dramatic license in the movie. However, he maintained that a certain amount of dramatic license must be allotted in the process of writing a dramatic script with a historical underpinning (see docudrama and biopic). Although the precise conversations depicted in the script may never have taken place, he alleged that the general tone and content of events depicted in The Path to 9/11 were true. Nowrasteh was quoted in FrontPage Magazine as saying that the film \\"dramatizes the frequent opportunities the administration had in the '90s to stop bin Laden in his tracks but lacked the will to do so.\\" When asked if he thought of the script as a \\"historical document,\\" Nowrasteh has responded: > No, but I stand by the original version of the movie, and I stand by the > edited version. ... There has to be conflation of events. The most obvious > problem any dramatist faces is that of sheer length. I had to collapse the > events of eight and a half years into five hours. I don't know any other way > to do it except collapse, conflate, and condense. Critics, including 9/11 Commission member Richard Ben-Veniste pointed out that some scenes in the film were complete fabrications.CQ.com Richard Miniter, a conservative author and critic of the Clinton administration, said that a key scene with Sandy Berger was based on \\"Internet myth\\": \\"If people wanted to be critical of the Clinton years there's things they could have said, but the idea that someone had bin Laden in his sights in 1998 or any other time and Sandy Berger refused to pull the trigger, there's zero factual basis for that.\\" Nowrasteh wrote about his work on Path To 9/11 in an opinion piece in the opinionjournal.com on 18 September 2006. He stated: > The Path to 9/11 was set in the time before the event, and in a world in > which no party had the political will to act. The principals did not know > then what we know now. It is also indisputable that Bill Clinton entered > office a month before the first attack on the World Trade Center. Eight > years then went by, replete with terrorist assaults on Americans and > American interests overseas. George W. Bush was in office eight months > before 9/11. Those who actually watched the entire miniseries know that he > was given no special treatment. Critics‚Äîincluding President Bill Clinton, Sandy Berger, Madeleine Albright, former Clinton aides, an FBI agent who quit as a consultant to the film, 9/11 Commission co-chair Lee H. Hamilton, and some conservatives, including Bill Bennett and John Fund‚Äîasserted that the film contained inaccuracies such as its depiction of Clinton as so distracted by the Lewinsky scandal that he neglected the terrorism issue (although the 9/11 Commission Report states that \\"we have found no reason to question\\" the testimony of Clinton aides who claimed that the Lewinsky scandal had no bearing on national security considerations9/11 Commission Report, p. 118). Nowrasteh is quoted in the documentary Blocking the Path to 9/11 as saying that his intention in depicting Clinton as \\"somewhat hamstrung\\" in his response to terrorism was, ironically, to make Clinton a more sympathetic figure. Blocking The Path to 9/11 Documentary In August 2008, talk show host and documentary filmmaker John Ziegler and producer David Bossie of Citizens United premiered a documentary co-produced, written and directed by Ziegler entitled Blocking The Path to 9/11,Blocking The Path To 9/11 - Credits, Blocking The Path To 9/11 official website (accessed 21 September 2008)Premiere of John Ziegler's Film Announced!!, John Ziegler official website (accessed 2008-09-21)Premiere of JZ's Film Ends With Standing Ovations, John Ziegler official website (accessed 2008-09-21) which revisits the political controversy behind the ABC miniseries.\\"Who Was Blocking 'The Path to 9/11'?\\" by Jeffrey Ressner, Politico, http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12671.html Through interviews with the Path to 9/11 filmmakers (including Nowrasteh) and others, news clips regarding the controversy, and footage from the miniseries itself, the documentary asserts not only that accusations of the filmmakers' covert political agenda were unfounded, but that they were generated by Clinton-era politicians concerned that the miniseries tarnished their political legacy, and were reported uncritically by bloggers and a biased news media. The documentary also claims that Disney/ABC ultimately shelved plans to release a DVD of the miniseries as a result of pressure from the political left, specifically the Clintons themselves. As noted in the documentary, Disney/ABC denies this and claims the decision not to release a DVD was purely a business decision. Regarding the documentary's intention, filmmaker Ziegler stated, \\"... the point of my documentary is not to 'blame' 9/11 on Bill Clinton. We just want to expose the real history that led to the attacks and correct the historical record about what happened to this film so that we can help prevent this from happening again in the future.\\"\\"Blocking 'The Path to 9/11'\\" interview http://97.74.65.51/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=32317 The Stoning of Soraya M. The Stoning of Soraya M. () is a 2008 American drama film adapted from French-Iranian journalist Freidoune Sahebjam's 1994 book of the same name based on the true story of a woman falsely convicted of adultery in Iran and subsequently stoned to death. The film version was directed by Cyrus Nowrasteh and written by Nowrasteh and his wife, screenwriter Betsy Giffen Nowrasteh. It stars Academy Award nominee Shohreh Aghdashloo, as well as James Caviezel and Mozhan Marn√≤. Because of its highly critical attitude toward the Iranian legal system, the controversial book, an international bestseller, was banned in Iran. Likewise, the film version of The Stoning of Soraya M., even before its release, made its way onto a list of American films that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad deemed offensive and for which he demanded an apology. But the film's release also drew enough attention to the issue of stoning in Iran that it sufficiently embarrassed the Iranian authorities into announcing consideration of a ban on stoning and other harsh legal punishments. Writing in The Wall Street Journal, John Jurgensen said the film was shot over six weeks in a mountain village in Jordan. The stoning sequence itself took six days to shoot. Jurgensen reports that \\"some human-rights advocates call the film inaccurate and sensationalistic,\\" but that director Cyrus Nowrasteh responds, \\"A movie like this needs to be absolutely uncompromising in its approach. The subject demands it.\\" The film had its world premiere at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival, where it won Runner-up for the Audience Choice Award. It also won Second Runner-up for the Cadillac People's Choice Award, as well as the Audience Award for Best Feature at the 2009 Los Angeles Film Festival. The film also won the Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award,The Stoning of Soraya M. and the 2009 Ghent Film Festival's Canvas Audience Award.2009 Ghent Film Festival Awards At the 2009 Satellite Awards, it was named one of the year's Top Ten Films and nominated for Best Drama Film, while its star Shohreh Agdashloo won Best Actress in a Drama.2009 Satellite Awards In 2010, the film was hailed as one of Movieguide's Ten Best 2009 Movies for Mature Audiences and was the co-winner, with Invictus, of Movieguide's Faith and Freedom Award for Promoting Positive American Values for 2009.Movieguide.org It also shared, with \\"Women in Shroud,\\" the Cinema for Peace Award for Justice in conjunction with the Berlin Film Festival and won Outstanding Foreign Motion Picture at the NAACP Image Awards. The Young Messiah Nowrasteh directed the biblical drama The Young Messiah, which was released on 11 March 2016. The story was adapted by Cyrus and Betsy Giffen Nowrasteh from Anne Rice's Christ the Lord, and was produced by 1492 Pictures and Ocean Blue Entertainment in association with CJ E&M; Film Division. The film was distributed by Focus Features. The project had a jump start in early 2013 but was shut down in preproduction and was seemingly dead. Then in late 2014, the project was resurrected thanks to the efforts of Tracy K. Price and Bill Andrew, along with Italian producer Enzo Sisti. Filmed in Matera and Rome, Italy, the plot follows Jesus Christ at age seven, when he returns to Nazareth and learns about his true place as the son of God. On 10 December 2015, Nowrasteh was interviewed on EWTN by Raymond Arroyo. Nowrasteh said of the film: \\"This is really a movie about a family and we take you inside the Holy Family.\\"  Infidel  Nowrasteh's wrote, directed, and produced the 2020 film Infidel, a political thriller about an American journalist (played by Jim Caviezel) held captive by the Iranian regime. Nowrasteh cited several real world instances of American nationals imprisoned by the Iranian government, including Xiyue Wang and Robert Levinson. One of the film's producers was right-wing pundit Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza, who had previously produced several political documentaries including 2016: Obama's America, Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party, and Death of a Nation. Infidel is his first narrative film. The film was shot on-location in Jordan, where Nowrasteh previously shot Soraya M. On his website, Nowrasteh stated the Jordanian film commission kept its filming secret for fear of objections from the Iranian government, and the film had heavy security. When the Iranian government did become aware of Nowrasteh being in Amman to film and voiced its displeasure to the Jordanian government. The story centers on a Christian underground inside Iran, led primarily by women. They work together in the film with Muslims who are also in opposition to the Iranian regime, by helping the main character, Doug Rawlins (portrayed by Jim Caviezel) and his wife, Liz (played by Claudia Karvan). Another actress was set to play Liz but left the film only weeks before filming due to a conflicting commitment. Karvan was recommended by Caviezel who worked with her on Long Weekend (2008). Upcoming projects Among Nowrasteh's upcoming projects were reportedly to be film adaptations of Thomas Tessier's book The NightwalkerThe Nightwalker ¬´ NightWriter and The Last Campaign, Thurston Clarke's account of Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign. His most notable other project is a film about Andrew Jackson entitled The Battle of New Orleans. He is partnered with producer/manager Alan Siegel and Gerard Butler has expressed interest in portraying Jackson who led a ragtag army in defeating the British at New Orleans on 8 January 1815.  Personal life  Nowrasteh is married to screenwriter Elizabeth (\\"Betsy\\") G. Nowrasteh (born 1953). They have two sons, Alex and Mark. Nowrasteh is a Christian. Political orientation Nowrasteh received criticism from conservatives for an alleged \\"liberal bias\\" in his Showtime film, The Day Reagan Was Shot. Former Reagan National Security Advisor, Richard Allen, led the charge with a piece in The Wall Street Journal (14 December 2001), accusing Nowrasteh and Executive Producer Oliver Stone of \\"yet another dubious Oliver Stone production\\" and referring to it as \\"The Day They Shot the Truth.\\" Mr. Allen based his piece on tapes he had kept from that day, releasing only six minutes to support his position. Nowrasteh responded in the Los Angeles Times (24 December 2001) and a letter to the editor in the Wall Street Journal (2 January 2002), \\"the clear solution is to have Allen release the entire unedited tape and allow anyone to make the comparisons and draw whatever conclusions seem warranted.\\" Nowrasteh concluded his Los Angeles Times piece by writing, \\"The Day Reagan Was Shot provides the first-ever dramatization of a constitutional crisis and government cover-up (both amply supported by facts) and the threat they pose to a nation when a president becomes incapacitated. This is important and relevant and raises issues that should be discussed openly.\\" Los Angeles Times TV critic Howard Rosenberg, in a review entitled, \\"Film on Reagan Shooting Plays Loose With Facts,\\" wrote that Nowraseth's script \\"in some key areas collides head-on with other accounts.\\" Rosenberg added: > In the movie, also, the perceived Soviet nuclear threat turns out to be a > harmless simulation by the North American Aerospace Defense Command. > However, NORAD conducted no such operations that day, [national security > advisor Richard V.] Allen says in one of the documentaries. When apprised of > that, Nowrasteh said he had based that part of his script on > \\"circumstantial\\" evidence. As for the hospital intruder who reaches Reagan's > bedside, Nowrasteh said he's certain that happened and that he read of it in > Washingtonian magazine. Even if didn't happen, though, it plays well, which > is all that really matters. Nowrasteh was likewise criticized by liberals for an alleged \\"conservative bias\\" in his controversial ABC docudrama The Path to 9/11, which he wrote and co-produced. Nowrasteh describes himself as more libertarian than either conservative or liberal.

The XOR gate is dependent on timing. A domino computer is a mechanical computer built using dominoesDomino computer to represent mechanical amplification or logic gating of digital signals. Because of the existence of multiple schemes, domino computer will be used in this article to denote any particular scheme that uses the mentioned base phenomenon (of domino sequences) for building machines equivalent to a computer. This choice of terminology may be somewhat arbitrary, because only few resources write on this topic.Domino computers , a detailed description written by David Johnston  Basic phenomenon  Sequences of standing dominoes (so that each topples the next one) can be arranged to demonstrate digital concepts such as amplification and digital signals. It is some digital information that is conducted by a string of dominoes, thus this effect differs from phenomena where: * energy is conducted without amplification, thus dissipating; or * amplification is applied to non-digital signals, allowing noise effects to occur. The Domino Day event shows many constructs, mainly with purpose of entertainment. Some constructs may remind people of digital circuits. Some of them suggest that not only telegraph-like tools can be shown, but also simple information processing modules can be built. It is possible to use this phenomenon for constructing unconventional computing tools.James Maguire: IBM Creates Molecular Computer Circuit NewsFactor Magazine Online, 2006. A topic in the intersection of molecular computing and domino computer The base phenomenon is sufficient to achieve this goal, but also sophisticated ‚Äúmechanical synapses‚Äù can be used (see online Perrucci, Mike: Domino Toppling.), to the analogy of electrical synapses or chemical synapses. Logical aspects The logic gate OR is very natural in dominoes. The problem is which gate we should add to OR, and obtain a functionally complete set. Note that no domino gate can produce output 1 with all inputs 0, so we cannot make NOT, therefore we cannot even make IMPLIES without an external 'power source' sequence. Once we admit it, NOT is realized and we have a complete set. But it is however distant to lead in a sequence from one source to many gates in each suitable timing. Let us suppose we do not have one. A root breaking system is basically needed if one wants a logical connective with output 0 for input 1. Let P$Q be the gate in which the sequence to be turned down by P is broken by that by Q. Then P$Q is logically equivalent to P AND (NOT Q), if the input Q is earlier than P. The set of OR and $ can represent any logical connectives in any arity except for ones which generates 1 with all inputs 0. Similarly, XOR can be realized with the gate in a diagram above as a bi-root breaking system. The problems of these two root breaking systems is that they heavily depend on the simultaneity of two inputs. In the gate of XOR one input may destroy the opposite input root tracking back. Note that the expression of P AND Q, P$(P$Q) OR Q$(Q$P) is symmetric, hence does not depend on the simultaneity, and with no worry of tracking back, though it is complicated. Record The current record for domino computers is a 5 bit adder. At the Manchester Science Festival in 2012, mathematician Matt Parker and a team of volunteers worked together to build a domino binary adder which could add two three-bit inputs and produce a 4-bit output, which ran successfully. The following day, they attempted to build a 5-bit adder, which they completed, but the final test run had some errors (one due to signal bleed between chains of dominoes, and one timing issue).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpLU__bhu2w At American British Academy (ABA), Muscat, a team of Grade 12 students lead by Saatvik Suryajit Korisepati, supported by Alex Freyer, Zoltan Sojitory and rest of computers students had executed a 5-bit adder which will be able to add any numbers up to the sum of 63. The previous world record is a 4-bit adder that can only add up numbers up to 31. They had used 15,000 dominoes to build the circuit at Bank Muscat headquarters Oman.http://www.omanobserver.om/aba-oman-students- set-world-record-for-dominoes-circuit/  See also  * Domino logic * The concept is mentioned in the book I Am a Strange Loop by Douglas Hofstadter.

With this sperm sample, they inseminate Slymenstra Hymen, who gives birth further into the show. After giving birth (with the \\"Fire In The Loins\\" footage), the infant is abducted by Synnite warriors, who announce the coming of Cardinal Syn. Their reason for abducting the newborn is not revealed until Syn arrives - Cardinal Syn is a robot, powered by the soul of an infant with a high level of Jizmoglobin (previously mentioned in Skulhedface). With Syn's arrival, the band is utterly defeated, until they are finally able to (literally) disarm the robot, and open his chest cavity (which reveals his power source). The video for \\"Surf of Syn\\" has a different fate for both Gwar and Syn. At the end, Syn's body is destroyed (by the craft that brought him to Earth; Techno Destrcuto hijacks it and rams it into the body), but his head fires lasers at Gwar, incapacitating them long enough to get away. Music Used Though there is live footage, the music used is lifted directly from the album, with two exceptions (\\"Sonderkommando,\\" a song from This Toilet Earth, is a live version, with differing lyrics than the one found on the album, and \\"S.F.W.,\\" a song written and recorded for the soundtrack to the eponymous film, is also live). Music videos \\"Saddam a Go-Go\\" was used in a later episode of Beavis and Butt-head, and was highly praised (it is generally assumed that Gwar is Beavis and Butt-head's favorite band). Though from This Toilet Earth, the entire video uses footage from the 1994 tour, and was unable to be used in the Skulhedface movie. \\"Meat Sandwich\\" is credited (on the Ultimate Video Gwarchive) as directed by Abe Spear, but credited as being directed by Dave Brockie in Rendezvous with RagNaRok. The meat-eating scene at the end made a number of extras ill, as they actually ate the (undercooked) meat (Brockie and Gorman claim to have instructed them to act like they were eating it, and they didn't listen). \\"Surf of Syn\\" was the first video for the album, and was filmed on a very, very small budget. It features the X-Cops, except for \\"Zipper Pig\\" (Gorman). Matt Maguire plays Cardinal Syn in the video (and in the song). Miscellaneous Flattus Maximus speaks more in this video than in any other recording to date. It is also the only footage with Peter Lee speaking as Flattus; the character was played by two extras (Lee was recovering from a gunshot wound) in Skulhedface, and Flattus and JiZMak never said anything during Dawn of the Day of the Night of the Penguins.

History The 297th Military Intelligence Battalion was originally constituted in the United States Army Reserves as the 297th Army Security Agency Company on 21 November 1962 and assigned to the Third United States Army. It was activated on 1 March 1963 in Atlanta, Georgia. The unit was reorganized and redesignated as the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 297th Security Agency Battalion on 15 April 1966. It was inactivated on 31 January 1968 and relieved from assignment to the Third United States Army. On 1 February 1990 the unit was redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 297th Military Intelligence Battalion and concurrently removed from the Army Reserve and allotted to the Regular Army. The unit was redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Service Company, 297th Military Intelligence Battalion on 1 February 1990 and was activated at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. During June and July 1994, the elements at Fort Monmouth moved to Fort Gordon, Georgia. The battalion was subordinate to the 513th Military Intelligence Brigade, a force projection brigade. The battalion was composed of the Headquarters and Headquarters Service Company, A Company and C Company, all located at Fort Gordon, and elements of B Company, were collocated with the Joint Surveillance and Target Attach Radar System (JSTARS)at Warner Robins AFB, Georgia and US Central Command (USCENTCOM) at MacDill AFB, Florida. The Intelligence Support Element- McPherson (ISE-M), was collocated with the U.S. Army Central Command (ARCENT) at Fort McPherson, Georgia. There were two Corps Military Intelligence Support Elements (CMISE), one at Fort Hood, Texas with the III U.S. Corps and one at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, with the XVIII Airborne Corps. Their mission was to enhance INSCOM's support to the warfighting corps commanders. The Army's Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) Detachment was also part of the battalion. It provided Army crewmembers to JSTARS and was located at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia. In 1999 while located at MacDill, Air Force Base, B Company became officially recognized as C Company. C Company, located at Fort Gordon, became officially recognized as B Company. In October 2004, the CMISE mission in support of III U.S. Corps became integrated in Fort Gordon operations, reducing the Battalion's number of remote CMISE to one. Also, JSTARS was redesignated the 138th MI Company and was subordinated to INSCOM HQ.

Bureau of Economic Geology The Bureau of Economic Geology was established in 1909 as a successor to the Texas Geological Survey and the Texas Mineral Survey. Dr. William Battle Phillips was the Bureau's first director. Before 1909 the Texas legislature established and funded three Texas Geological Surveys, which lasted from 1858‚Äì1867 (with a four-year suspension), 1873‚Äì1876, and 1888‚Äì1901 (with the last five years unfunded). Today the Bureau functions as a research unit of The University of Texas at Austin, the State Geological Survey, and the Regional Lead Organization for the Petroleum Technology Transfer Council. right Currently under the leadership of Dr. Scott Tinker, The Bureau conducts research in two broad areas: energy and environment. The Bureau's energy research focuses largely on oil and natural gas. Major approaches include salt tectonics, carbonate and clastic reservoir characterization, fracture characterization and prediction, multicomponent seismic applications, and basin analysis. The Bureau works to bring insight and innovation from outcrop studies to the evolving science of reservoir characterization. With 70% of in- place reserves typically remaining in the ground at the time of oil field abandonment, this research has enduring economic and societal importance. The Bureau's environmental research group conducts a wide range of basic and applied research in groundwater resources, vadose zone hydrology, coastal studies, near-surface geophysics, and geologic mapping. The group also has programs that relate energy and the environment, including a major initiative in geological sequestration of greenhouse gases. A variety of approaches are used to investigate characteristics and processes of shallow Earth systems and impacts of human activities on those systems. Remote sensing, including satellite (GRACE and MODIS) and airborne geophysics are used to quantify regional scale evapotranspiration, groundwater storage, and saline plume characterization. Subsurface geologic and hydrogeologic characterization provides critical information on sustainability of water resources and potential for carbon sequestration and desalination. Although many of the studies are focused in Texas, insights and process understanding are applied to other regions globally (such as China, India, Africa, and South America). The Bureau provides wide-ranging advisory, technical, informational, and research-based services to industries, nonprofit organizations, and Federal, State, and local agencies. The Bureau also provides facilities and management to the office of Publication Sales, Core Research Laboratories, and the Geophysical Log Facility, all of which serve the public. Institute for Geophysics Founded in 1972, the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG) is an Organized Research Unit within The University of Texas at Austin, conducting academic research in geology and geophysics. UTIG works with the UT Department of Geological Sciences and Bureau of Economic Geology to provide basic and applied geophysical research opportunities for graduate students at the MA and PhD level through its worldwide programs in solid earth geophysics, marine geology/geophysics, and multi-channel reflection seismology. Some of its scientists also participate in the university's Environmental Science Institute. UTIG research activities are carried out all over the world and include large-scale, multi-investigator, multi-institutional field programs. The importance of geophysical measurements and their mathematical interpretation in the exploration for petroleum and economically useful minerals has also led to valuable partnerships between UTIG and industry. UTIG plays a role in K-12 education through formal teacher-training programs and informal outreach efforts. UTIG strives to conduct research that expands the frontiers of knowledge in earth science, has societal and economic relevance, and is of human interest. Dedicated to basic and applied research alike, the Institute aims to enhance humanity's fundamental understanding of the dynamic geophysical processes that have influenced and continue to influence Earth's structure and climate. Geographically, UTIG's scope includes the ocean basins, continental margins, Antarctica, and all sites of seismic activity. Chronologically, its scope is no less vast: from the development of tectonic evolution models that reconstruct continental arrangements as much as a billion years ago to predicting how future climatic scenarios would impact sea-level changes and thus the habitability of densely populated coastal regions. The Institute's research is highly relevant to natural resource exploration, the assessment of geologic hazards, and the mitigation of environmental damage. The development of new mathematical models, data processing and imaging techniques, and geophysical instrumentation is also an integral part of UTIG's ongoing research and future goals. Department of Geological Sciences rightFounded in 1888, the Department of Geological Sciences is the main academic unit of the Jackson School. However, scientists and students in the Department do conduct a wide range of research and collaborate with researchers at the Institute and Bureau, as well as with colleagues around the world. Scientists in the Department conduct research and teach courses in 9 main areas: Atmospheric Sciences, Computational Geosciences, Geochemistry/Thermo- & Geo-chronology, Geophysics/Seismology, Hydrogeology/Glaciology, Paleontology/Geobiology, Petrology/Mineral Physics, Sedimentary Geology/Stratigraphy, Structural Geology/Lithospheric Geodynamics.Jackson School of Geosciences Research Disciplines http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/research/disciplines/ The Department houses one of only a handful of non-medical CT scanners at an academic institution anywhere in the world. The High Resolution X-Ray CT (UTCT) Facility has been used to non-destructively scan precious, one-of-a-kind specimens such as Lucy (an ancient human ancestor and the world's most famous fossil),Researchers Complete First CT Scan of Ancient Human Ancestor Lucy http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/2009/02/researchers-complete-first-ct-scan-of- ancient-human-ancestor-lucy/ Archaeopteryx (one of the oldest and most primitive birds known), one of the first books printed in the New World, and a meteorite thought by some to contain signs of life on Mars.

It is known to have existed only on the main islands of Chatham Island and Pitt Island. It is largely known from skeletal remains found in the kitchen middens of the original Polynesian inhabitants, the Moriori. The bird was approximately tall and weighed about and is thought to have been primarily an insectivore. Close up of the skull Henry Ogg Forbes originally placed the bird in the same genus as the red rail of Mauritius, Aphanapteryx, but later moved it to its own genus. A 2014 genetic study found that it formed a clade with the Invisible rail of Indonesia with a common origin around 10 million years ago, as the sister clade to the Gallirallus radiation. It was long thought that the Hawkins' rail was extinct prior to European discovery, however recent evidence suggests that the bird may have become extinct much later. An 1895 letter from Sigvard Dannefaerd belonging to financier/zoologist Walter Rothschild describes the appearance, behaviour, and Moriori hunting method concerning the species. A second account was published by Alexander Shand in 1911, though he seems to confuse the bird with a large parrot. The accounts suggest that the bird was known as the Mehonui and was dull brick-red in colour, that it spent much ot its time pecking for invertebrates in decayed wood, similar in lifestyle to the Weka. Its cry was described a loud \\"Tue-ck\\" sound. Groups of five to eight individuals likely formed during the breeding season. Due to the strength of its beak it has been suggested to have preyed on ground dwelling chicks, including those of petrels.

Earlier, Morini had also manufactured motorcycles together with Mario Mazzetti under the name MM. Moto Morini came under Cagiva control in 1987, then in 1996 joined Texas Pacific Group, which had also bought Ducati, and in April 1999, the rights to the name were purchased by Morini Franco Motori spa, a company which had been founded by Morini's nephew in 1954. After building large v-twin motorcycles early in the 21st century the company went into liquidation in late 2010. Moto Morini restarted motorcycle production in 2012. Moto Morini Corsaro 1200 History Alfonso Morini was born on 22 January 1898. Before he was 16 he was repairing motorcycles, and at the age of sixteen, opened a workshop. This was just before World War I broke out. During the war he was with the 8th Motorcycles Unit, stationed at Padova. MM In 1925 Mario Mazzetti, impressed by Alfonso's work, asked him to build a single-cylinder 120 cc two-stroke racing bike, making Alfonso the designer, constructor, and racer. They were successful racing, under the MM name, and Alfonso's finest racing moment came in 1927 when his MM 125 took six world records at Monza, during the Grand Prix of Nations. (These records were not bettered for twenty years.) In 1933 he set a new world speed record for 175 cc motorcycles of 162 km/h. Moto Morini three wheelers In 1937 Alfonso and Mario parted ways, and Alfonso Morini went into the production of 350 cc and 500 cc three wheelers, under the Moto Morini name. The government regulations favoured these lighter fuel efficient machines, and the successful Moto Morini M610 had advanced features, like cardan driveshafts. This was interrupted by World War II, and Moto Morini was converted to produce aeronautical components. In 1943 the factory was bombed. Motorcycles Moto Morini 175 Tresette Sprint of 1958 Moto Morini Corsaro 125 of 1960 Undeterred, in 1946, a new three-speed transmission, single cylinder, two- stroke T125 emerged from the new Bologna factory, Via Berti. In 1947 a Sport version appeared. In 1953 a 175 cc pushrod OHV four-stroke model appeared in production. Models like Gran Turismo, Settebello, Rebello, Supersport, Briscola, Tresette, and Tresette Sprint also appeared. In 1956 Moto Morini moved to a larger production facility at Via Bergami. In 1958 Alfonso Morini, Dante Lambertini, and Nerio Biavati designed the 250 GP Double Camshaft. On 30 June 1969 Alfonso Morini died. He was 71. His daughter, Gabriella Morini, took over management, and would remain in control until 1986. In 1970 Franco Lambertini (unrelated to the earlier Dante Lambertini of Morini's technical staff) left Ferrari works and joined Moto Morini. Competition history Moto Morini 175 Sprint F3 Corsa, 1959 Moto Morini 175 Settebello ‚ÄúShort Rods‚Äù, 1961 In 1948, Raffaele Alberti won the Italian Championship for Lightweight Motorcycles on a two-stroke 125 Competition. Umberto Masetti won the Italian Championship for Lightweight Motorcycles in 1949, on a 125 SOHC four-stroke that produced @ 10000 rpm, and could exceed . In 1952 Moto Morini won races outside of Italy with the 125 SOHC four-stroke, as Emilio Mendogni won both the Nations Grand Prix, and the Spanish Grand Prix. The 250 GP put out @ 11,000 rpm and had a maximum speed of . In 1961, Giacomo Agostini began his racing career on a Moto Morini Settebello ‚ÄúShort Rods‚Äù, coming second at Trento-Bondone. Agostini was Italian Cadet Champion in 1962, and Italian Junior Champion in 1963. Tarquinio Provini, riding a Moto Morini 250 GP, won the Italian Championship in 1961 and 1962. In 1963, Provini convinced Alfonso Morini that they should try for the World Championship. Provini would wage a season-long battle with Honda's Jim Redman for the 250 world championship. Each rider won four races and the title wasn't decided until the final race in Japan,The Japanese team ( 250 4cyl) would not let Provini practise before the race to hinder Morini's chances with Redman just winning the championship over Provini by two points.50 Years Of Moto Grand Prix (1st edition). Hazelton Publishing Ltd, 1999. The single Cyl 250 Morini is still the fastest single cyl (4t) 250 racer to this day. Moto Morini 350 & 500 V-twins In the early 1970s, Moto Morini launched their first 72¬∞ V-twin engined motorcycles, designed by Franco Lambertini, and created by Franco and Gino Marchesini. The 350 Sport and Strada models displaced 344 cc and were complemented in 1977 by 500 cc Sport and Strada models. Equipment on the models was of high-spec and when released the Morini 3¬Ω was around the same price as a Honda CB750. Moto Morini 3¬Ω GT (Strada). The Morini 3¬Ω still has a loyal following and a number of spare parts are available from specialist firms. The former editor of Classic Bike magazine, veteran motorcycle writer Hugo Wilson, has owned a 3¬Ω Sport since 1982 and still uses it as a regular commuter motorbike.Classic Bike, December 2010, p.24 The engine featured Heron heads,3¬Ω Sport Technical Specification'.

A fuel consumption test by Motorcycling Monthly at Britain's Motor Industry Research Association in 1976 returned a performance of while a 3¬Ω bike carried rider and pillion passenger.Clarke, R. M., Moto Morini 3¬Ω & 500 Performance Portfolio: 1974-1984, p. 37 The engine also incorporated one piece forged steel crankshaft, ball main bearings (first series motors), plain big end bearings (second series motors), and the conrods run on a common pin, desaxe, and offsetting the rear cylinder to the front by . Front and rear barrels and heads are interchangeable. VBH Dell'Orto (25 mm VHB 25 BS) square slide carburettors were fitted to the 350, with air fed via air-box with two filters. Bore and stroke was , respectively. The camshaft was driven by a small toothed belt, and was a revolutionary advance. They also included an electronic capacitor discharge ignition system designed by Ducati Elettronica. Early models had kick-start only but later ones also included a starter motor using three centrifugal friction shoes engaging the alternator rotor cover. The CDI ignition was powered by a coil in the alternator and using the kick-start a bike could be started and ridden with a flat battery. Moto Morini 3¬Ω Moto Morini 350 K2 1986 The frame is a full steel duplex swingarm design, with Ceriani rear suspension, and Marzocchi front forks. The early models had a twin leading shoe drum brake up front (Strada: drum, Sport: drum) that was notoriously grabby on the Borrani spoked wheels, but these were replaced with a single chromed Grimeca disc in 1976, and later optional double discs. The rear drum brake was replaced in the early 1980s with a Grimeca disc. Switchgear, tail and brake lights were the standard CEV model used on many Italian motorcycles of the 1970s. The month and year of manufacture is embossed in small figures on the side of each cast wheel, near where one of the seven cast spokes meets the rim. The helical gear transmission was a six- speed, with a top gear ratio of 1:0.954, making it akin to an overdrive. The transmission was engaged with a six-plate dry clutch, making a characteristic rattle similar to Ducatis when disengaged. Secondary drive was by a 5/8 x 3/8-inch chain to a rear sprocket with cush drive. Gear change is by right foot and the rear brake operated by left foot. Engine lubrication was by oil pump to the crankshaft but no force lubrication went to the rocker gear. Instead, crankcase pressure forced oil mist up the short pushrod tunnels to the rocker covers, where two 'crow's feet' allowed mist to condense and drip onto the rocker gear. Although ingenious, it required riders to gentle warm up their engines before using maximum revs, redlined at 9,200 rpm. Oil filtration was by plastic mesh filter. The 1979 model incorporated a moulded tank-hugging seat, black crankcase side covers and a black exhaust system in homage to the Moto Guzzi Le Mans. Footrests were placed too far forward for many riders and a common modification was to replace them with rearset footrests. Although not suitable for large riders, the 3¬Ω was renowned for sharp and impeccable handling and was able to compete against larger capacity motorbikes on twisty roads. Maximum torque was above 6,000 rpm and so required high revving, similar to a two-stroke, to make the most of the engine's characteristics. Nevertheless, a 3¬Ω Sport could still return when ridden hard. The 3¬Ω Sport had a higher compression ratio than the softer-tuned Strada. The Sport featured Tomaselli clip-ons handlebars and throttle, a steering damper and Veglia instruments. In November 1981 a 500 Turbo was shown at the Milan Show, producing at 8,300 rpm. It did not make it to production. An enduro version called the Camel 500 was released in 1981. In 1983 the Kanguro 350 was released. In 1986 Moto Morini brought out a cruiser version, the Excalibur, available in 350 and 500 versions. The 350 was conceived as a modular design, and single cylinder versions were made. (Looking like the V-twin with the rear cylinder removed) These were the 1975 six-speed 125 H and the 1978 250 T Mono, both unsuccessful, as was the later KJ 125 single of 1985. 350 performance figures *Strada @ 8,000 rpm top speed 162kmh *Sport @ 8,500 rpm, @ 6,100 rpm.

On 18 February 1987 Gabriella Morini sold the firm to the Castiglioni firm, Cagiva. Despite their assurances that Moto Morini was important to them, the company was allowed to decline. In 1988 the Dart 350, a fully race-faired version of the 72¬∞ V-twin, appeared. In 1989 the last enduro version, the Coguaro appeared, in 350 and 500 versions, and another cruiser version, the New York, also in both capacities. These were extensions of other models, and little to no development was being undertaken. Franco Lambertini had a new 60¬∞ engine design, but Cagiva was not interested. In the same year as the last models appeared, he left Moto Morini, and went to Piaggio-Gilera. The Via Bergami factory was closed and by 1993 Excaliburs are assembled at Agostini works. In 1996 Ducati and the Moto Morini name are sold to TPG. There were no plans to revive Moto Morini. Morini Franco Motori spa In 1999, Morini Franco Motori spa bought the Moto Morini name from Ducati. Morini Franco Motori spa was founded in 1954 by Franco Morini, Alfonso's nephew. A new joint-stock company was officially presented in 2003, and the principal Moto Morini SPA shareholders were the Berti and Morini families. Corsaro 1200, 9¬Ω, Corsaro Veloce, 1200 Sport, 1200 Avio and Scrambler  Moto Morini Corsaro 1200 (rear) In 2004, a new motorcycle was announced, the Corsaro 1200 naked bike, which appeared in 2005. It was followed by the \\"9¬Ω\\" road bike. There was criticism of the snatchy fuel injection mapping in these early models; however, power delivery was improved in time. They were both powered by an 1187 cc Bialbero CorsaCorta 87¬∞ V twin- cylinder engine that developed at 8500 rpm, and at 6,500 rpm, in the Corsaro, and at 8000 rpm in the 9¬Ω. The engine was designed by Franco Lambertini, who was the young engineer responsible for the \\"3¬Ω\\" model in the 1970s. The engines were tuned differently for different applications. On 10 October 2006, a Corsaro Veloce 1200 was announced. In 2008, at the \\"Padova Motorcycles\\" fair, the 1200 Sport was announced (and went into production) together with the Scrambler, that was afterwards produced,from 2009, just in few pieces due to the sudden financial empasse of the company Granferro : the unrealised dream At the end of 2009, the latest marketing attempt by Morini was almost ready to enter the market : the hypermotard \\"Granferro\\", designed by Rodolfo Frascoli (of Marabese Design). The production was due to commence in April 2010. The company was already in financial turmoil and mass production was not realized. Bankruptcy, liquidation and sale The company went into voluntary liquidation in 2009, after failing to pay suppliers or staff in September while hoping to find further financing. Paolo Berlusconi ‚Äì brother of Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi ‚Äì was interested in buying Morini. He already owned the Garelli brand. However, he could not reach an agreement with the labour unions and he pulled off from the venture. By July 2010, interested buyers could download a pdf of bike stock held by the company and being sold on a direct basis to customers. Prices in the \\"fire sale\\" included four red 2007 Moto Morini 9¬Ωs selling for ‚Ç¨3,600 each, while other cheap deals included ‚Ç¨4,800 for Corsaro Neros and also a stock of 42 variously coloured 1200 Sports selling for ‚Ç¨5,760 each. Some staff were recalled in early 2011 by the liquidator to construct a number of bikes from spare part stock. Liquidator Piero Aicardi believed there were enough parts left in the factory to build as many as 45 bikes, with the production being split between 16 Scramblers and 29 Granpassos, seven of which would use frames originally built for the stillborn Granferro. After the sale of around 40 bikes assembled from remaining parts the company and the intellectual property were put up for sale in April 2011. Many potential bidders emerged; but the sale did not go through. Moto Morini Granpasso 1200 Finally, in July 2011, the company was sold to Eagle Bike, a newly formed company that is run by two Italian entrepreneurs, Sandro Capotosti and Ruggeromassimo Jannuzzelli, for 1.96 million Euros. The factory was not included in the sale although they are thought to have a two-year lease on the premises. Moto Morini E-bike range includes the E-bike Urban: an assisted pedal bike with an urban look 2012, back on the market  In March 2012, the factory announced online auctioning of coupon in order to win a completely new and in limited edition model. It is the Rebello 1200 Giubileo, reinterpretation of the namesake bike from 1956. At the end of the auction Moto Morini built 20 specimens of it to celebrate the 75 years of the brand. In 2013 the Moto Morini range included Corsaro Veloce, Scrambler 1200 and Granpasso 1200. About 30 employees are involved in a production of 70 handmade and handcrafted specimens with spare parts coming mostly from Italy. The initial recovery program planned the achievement of a production capacity up to 5000 bikes per year and the employment of 100 workers before 2016. In the new production system the bikes are assembled by hand on customers' request. Also in 2013, Moto Morini launched the bike rent forms that allowed clients to rent Moto Morini motorcycles for a short period of time. It also introduced the \\"buy-back\\" system: a long term rent that allows customers to pay a monthly fee and decide, after some time, whether to keep the motorcycle or give it back to the factory. Sampler bikes and rented bikes were then sold at reduced prices. At the end of 2013 Moto Morini signed an agreement with the Indian company Vardenchi to provide them with engines. In the summer of 2014 the headquarters and all Moto Morini locations moved from Casalecchio di Reno (BO) to Trivolzio (PV). Meanwhile, a new model was launched: the Moto Morini 11 1/2. In November 2014 a temporary shop in Milan was opened where Moto Morini showed the updated range. In 2015 the company management changed and so did the trade policy: Moto Morini concludes contracts with dealers and distributors and ended the online sale. Moreover, also the production strategy changed, taking Moto Morini more and more to a direction where quality and customization are at the heart of the production. A Granpasso's makeover intended for the Japanese market, called Granpasso R, is launched. The specific characteristics of this model is the reduced ground clearance. In 2016 Moto Morini increased the commercial structure in order to better manage the new sales network. In November Moto Morini returned to the 2016 edition of Eicma after seven years of absence with a new model: the Corsaro ZZ. Thanks to the presence at the International exhibition and a media campaign, Moto Morini appeared in many motorcycles magazines. In that period also the Facebook page was reopened. In 2017 the 11 1/2 was no longer produced and the Moto Morini range included: Scrambler 1200, Granpasso 1200, Granpasso R, Corsaro 1200 ZZ. The Corsaro is the first Moto Morini model in Euro 4, with ABS and electronic gear shift. Furthermore, the lightning system is fully LED, the fuel tank is in aluminium and several body parts are made of carbon fiber as standard. Taking the bike to have the 99% of its components made in Italy. All the motorcycles are hand assembled, from the engine to the final product. In 2017 Moto Morini launched also the new One-off department, an internal area dedicated to customized models on clients' requests. To celebrate the 80 years of the company (1937 - 2017) Moto Morini created a limited edition of 8 specimens of a special Corsaro, called Corsaro80. This special model is improved with more body parts made of carbon fiber and hand hammered aluminium. In July 2017 Moto Morini re-entered the bicycles market. As a matter of fact the company was already selling bicycles in the Sixties. Nowadays, it has introduced a limited edition model of e-bike. The frame in completely in aluminium for a total weight of 13.5 kg. The engine and the battery are designed by the Politecnico di Milano and are both hidden in the hub, creating a more appealing look. Moto Morini produced 30 specimens of the pedal assisted bike in order to test the market. At the end of 2017, due to the success of the first e-bike, Moto Morini launched a range of four more models: Gravel, City, Urban and Sport. They all have the innovative Frame Block system: a solution integrated in the frame that works as a locker. In November√¨ 2017 Moto Morini is present again at Eicma, exhibiting the Corsaro 1200 ZZ MY2018, the Milano, The Scrambler 1200 MY2018. The new Moto Morini Milano pays an homage to the famous Moto Morini 3 1/2, historic model of the company. In addition to that, Moto Morini showed also a customized version of the Corsaro ZZ, called Corsaro Ti22. In the spring of 2018 a new version of Corsaro, the Corsaro ZT, will be on the market. In the fall of 2018 it was announced that ownership had transferred to Zhongneng Vehicle Group.

In Slavic folklore, the raskovnik or razkovniche (Serbian Cyrillic and ; ; ; ) is a magical herb. According to lore, the raskovnik has the magical property to unlock or uncover anything that is locked or closed. However, legends claim it is notoriously difficult to recognize the herb, and reputedly only certain chthonic animals are able to identify it. Names The herb is known by a multitude of names among the South Slavs, and the names vary significantly by region. While razkovniche and raskovnik are the customary names in Bulgarian and Serbian respectively and the root is also preserved in the Leskovac dialect as raskov, in some parts of Macedonia it is known as e≈æ trava (\\"hedgehog grass\\"). In the vicinity of Bar (southeastern Montenegro), the term is demir-bozan, a Turkish borrowing meaning \\"iron breaker\\". In Syrmia, the plant is referred to as ≈°pirgasta trava (a hapax legomenon), in Slavonia it is known as zemaljski kljuƒç (\\"earth key\\"), and in Slovenia's Savinja Valley as mavriƒçin koren (\\"rainbow root\\"). Description and properties Traditionally, it is considered that few people, if any, could actually recognize the herb. However, in Bulgarian sources the raskovnik is sometimes described as a grass resembling a four-leaf clover. It grows in meadows and may be picked either while green and blooming or in hay, when it is already dry. While it is not necessarily rare, nor does it thrive only in remote locations, it is nevertheless impossible to recognize by the uninitiated. In the words of Serbian linguist and folklorist Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá, ‚ÄúIt is some (may be imaginary) grass for which it is thought that thanks to it (when brushed by it) every lock and every other closure would open by itself.‚Äù According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, regardless of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split the ground at the place where a treasure lay so that people could locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was a black man in chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground to be replaced by a cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires. Obtainment In some parts of Serbia, hedgehogs are believed to be animals capable of identifying the raskovnik and involuntarily assisting people in obtaining it. The raskovnik is believed to have been sought after by treasure hunters, sorcerers and herbalists who desired its magic powers for personal benefit. In Serbia, it was believed that there exist certain treasures, such as the Treasure of Tsar Radovan, which could not be unlocked in any other way but employing a raskovnik. As, according to Bulgarian folklore, tortoises were the only beings who knew the appearance of the herb and the location where it grows, such people would try to obtain the raskovnik by deceiving a tortoise. They would find a tortoise nesting site and hem it in with a fence while the tortoise is away. When it returns, the tortoise would be unable to access its eggs, so it would return with a raskovnik in order to breach the fence. Thus, the tortoise would reveal the herb and people would acquire it from the tortoise, which does not need it anymore. While the tricking of a tortoise was the most popular method in Bulgarian mythology, in Dalmatia the legend refers to snakes, and among Serbs another version involves the locking of young hedgehogs in a box for their mother to unlock. In Serbia, one would also have to be quick to take the raskovnik, as the hedgehog would swallow it after use. In any case, turtles, snakes and hedgehogs are all animals with chthonic characteristics which were often variously associated with the underworld in South Slavic tradition. Karad≈æiƒá also mentions another Serbian method to obtain the raskovnik. He recorded a story from the town of Zemun about a merchant who desired to find the herb. The merchant locked an old woman into leg irons and let her wander in a field during the night; if the irons unlocked by themselves at a certain place, that would be a place where the raskovnik grows. Metaphoric use The legendary herb has entered the modern Bulgarian vocabulary as a metaphor for a magic key or a panacea in the wider sense. The phrase ‚Äúto find the razkovniche‚Äù (‚Äû–¥–∞ –Ω–∞–º–µ—Ä–∏—à —Ä–∞–∑–∫–æ–≤–Ω–∏—á–µ—Ç–æ‚Äú ‚Äûda namerish razkovnicheto‚Äú) means to find the solution to a certain problem, usually a complex or difficult one. Razkovniche is also the common Bulgarian name for the plant European waterclover (Marsilea quadrifolia) which, in its appearance, has many similarities with the descriptions of the mythical raskovnik. In eastern Serbia, raskovnik also refers to a specific plant used in vernacular medicine, namely Laserpitium siler.

History Fleeing from Jamaica after being charged with murder, Baldridge sailed to Madagascar and, by 1690, had established a base of operations on the island of St. Mary's. By the following year, Baldridge controlled the inland waterway into St. Mary's having established a virtual stronghold overlooking the island harbor as well as protecting the settlements' warehouses. After he had subdued the local tribes, native chieftains would be forced to pay Baldridge to mediate between warring tribes. Baldridge's settlement had become a popular haven among pirates of the Mediterranean with Baldridge supplying pirates in exchange for high fees. Baldridge's trading supplies came from New York merchant Frederick Philipse, who chartered a number of ships under captains John Churcher, Thomas Mostyn, and others; Baldridge sent slaves back in return. Among his customers was Thomas Tew, who visited once in 1693, and whose ship the Amity visited again in 1695 after Tew had been killed attacking the Moorish ship Gunsway with Henry Every. Baldridge had just traded with the merchant ship Charming Mary in August 1695, and only a few months later equipped the Amity (with the remains of Tew's crew) who left to hunt down the very same Charming Mary who'd just departed. Baldridge reportedly lived a luxurious and extravagant life on the island, which included his own harem of island women, until 1697 when he was forced to flee to the American colonies after the local tribes discovered he had sold a group of natives as slaves. A number of pirates were killed in the ensuing uprising, including John Hoar, Robert Glover, and the remainder of Thomas Wake's crew, who had cruised with Tew and Every. Baldridge himself blamed the pirates for the natives' hostility: \\"The above mentioned men that were killed by the Natives, were most of them privateers that had been in the Red Seas and took severall ships there, they were chiefly the occasion of the natives Riseing, by their abuseing of the Natives and takeing their Cattel from them.\\" However, according to William Kidd: \\"Baldridge was the occasion of that Insurrection of the Natives and the death of the pirates, for that having inveigled a great number of the natives of St. Maries, men, women and children, on board a ship or ships he carryed and sold them for slaves to a French Island called Mascarine or Mascaron, which treachery of Baldridges the Natives on the Island revenged on those pirates by cutting their throats.\\" Another ex-pirate trader named Edward Welsh took over Baldridge's abandoned settlement and fortifications shortly afterwards, but without Philipse's backing had less success. Some years later Dutch ex-pirate John Pro returned to St. Mary's and led a settlement there, trading with pirates and slavers until his death in 1719. After his return to New York, Baldridge presented Governor Bellomont with a plan to establish an English colony at √éle Sainte- Marie. Bellomont and his backers were skeptical, given Baldridge's background, and Bellomont lamented that he lacked enough judicial resources and honest officials to prosecute Baldridge. By 1699 Bellomont had ejected Philipse from the Council and suppressed his pirate-trading endeavors. Baldridge later married an ex-pirate's wife, though Bellomont noted that his marriage license was obtained illegally through a corrupt chaplain, and that the woman was technically still married. Finally Baldridge became a legitimate merchant and died in his seventies. Another source claims that after returning to New York, Baldridge convinced Bellomont to grant him permission to sail as a trader to Antigua; this was a ruse, and as soon as he sailed he turned north to Newfoundland and took to outright piracy, plundering the fishing fleets.

The film was directed by Nick Lyon and starring Ben Cross, Helena Mattsson, Dominic Keating and Marlene Favela. It is not a sequel to the first three films, instead as a stand-alone film and the first film of the Species series that does not feature Natasha Henstridge. The film premiered on the American broadcast, the Sci-Fi Channel on September 29, 2007 and was released on DVD on October 2. Plot Miranda Hollander is a beautiful and smart young woman. She is a college professor and lives with her \\"uncle\\", Tom Hollander who works in a museum; he adopted her after a car crash killed her parents. Miranda can read books just by touching them, without even needing to open them. Miranda believes that she has lived with her \\"uncle\\" ever since her parents were killed in an accident while she was a baby. After her birthday, Miranda passes out and is sent to a local hospital. Tom is notified by the police. When Miranda arrives at the hospital, she silently transforms into alien form and kills several people. When Tom finally arrives at the hospital the following morning, he finds bodies everywhere. Tom locates Miranda, injects her with human hormones and begins driving her to Mexico. On the way to Mexico, Miranda wakes up, asking for the cause of her 'illness'. Tom tells Miranda that she is the result of an experiment that combined human and alien DNA, an experiment conducted with his friend Forbes McGuire while they were both still in college. Tom has been injecting her with human hormones since her childhood to suppress her alien DNA. (Thus she never entered a cocoon stage and aged like a normal human.) Her parents never existed; they were just a fiction created by Tom to help build up Miranda's \\"normal life\\". Tom explains he and Forbes parted ways because of differences of opinion over their vision of their creation. When they arrive in Mexico, Miranda rests in a motel room while Tom spends the day searching for Forbes. After a few incidents, Tom and Miranda locate Forbes' current home. Forbes now lives with his recent experiment named Azura, another human and alien DNA hybrid who also serves as his assistant and lover‚Äîshe is sterile to prevent offspring. Forbes supports his experiment by creating half-alien facsimiles of dead pets and relatives. Forbes checks Miranda's condition and finds that Miranda has reached the end of her lifespan and will die in days; her changes to alien form are her body's way of fighting back as her human form has a weaker immune system. The only way to deny death is injecting fresh human DNA into Miranda. Miranda won't allow that to happen when she realizes it will result in the sacrifice of another human being. Again, Miranda becomes unconscious. Tom goes searching for a \\"donor\\" and is mugged by a woman in the process. Azura then incapacitates the mugger and the two bring her back to Forbes' lab, where they succeed in extending Miranda's life. However, Miranda starts acting odd, joking about having sex with Azura. Tom checks her blood as she invites him to get drunk and have sex in their hotel room; he tells her to rest, believing she is delirious from the procedure. She leaves in a huff. Tom finds Forbes did a sloppy job; Miranda's hormones are unstable, causing her alien side to become increasingly dominant. Driven by her alien sex drive, Miranda manages to seduce the innkeeper, another hybrid; however she kills him mid-process upon finding he is sterile. She goes to a bar for potential mates, seeing that a female singer in a provocative red dress is garnering a lot of attention. She sneaks backstage, intimidating the singer into giving up her dress. Tom wishes to sedate Miranda, so they can fix the imbalance in her DNA; Forbes gives him a near- lethal dose to use, but warns that she's \\"100% pure creature\\". Making things worse is that Miranda is no longer sterile, thanks to the new stem cells. Investigating a church, Tom is attacked by Azura; she is angry that his arrival changed things. He manages to knock her out by dropping a large cross on her, leaving Azura to heal and regain consciousness. Forbes tracks Miranda to an abandoned warehouse, where she strips naked; Miranda reveals Forbes has wanted to have sex with her since they met. She squeezes his hand to make him drop the sedative; Forbes gives in to his lust, allowing Miranda to strip him. They copulate, much to his pleasure. Once finished, Miranda changes into alien form and sends her tongue down Forbes' throat, suffocating him. Tom finds them later, barely pitying Forbes. Tom takes Miranda back to Forbes' house, where he discovers via X-ray that a hybrid child is rapidly growing in her womb. Miranda weakly says her humanity is dying, and that she doesn't want to be pure alien. Unfortunately, Azura returns in alien form; Tom is forced to fight her. Just when Azura has Tom cornered, Miranda attacks her and apparently kills Azura. However, Azura rises again and fatally impales Miranda before Tom kills Azura with a shotgun. In human form, Miranda thanks Tom for giving her life before dying. In the final scene a saddened Tom turns on all the gas burners and tanks in Forbes' house and leaves. The house explodes and Tom walks away, as the film ends.

An MGM/360 Production, filming commenced in October 2006, with Frank Mancuso Jr. returning as producer. The producers wanted to go back to H. R. Giger's designs of the alien creature due to popularity with fans and the absence of this decision in the last installment. The original look is apparent but with different color variations and new spikes on the aliens' wrists of the nemesis. It is also a first in the series that a half-human, half-alien character does not change fully into the alien creature but has prosthetic eyebrows, veins and contacts for a long period of time in more than one scene. Title The film's title underwent several changes, starting as Species IV, Species: Quattro and finally Species: The Awakening. During pre- production the film was referred to as Species IV on movie websites. When an online trailer was released the film was called Species: Quattro. Eventually Nick Lyon, the director of the film, gave the film's current name on his official website. Like the previous films, the original film's logo is used for the main title.

It is offered by three national satellite television service providers, Bell Satellite TV, TELUS Optik TV, Telus Satellite TV, and Shaw Direct and many digital cable television providers such as Eastlink, Shaw, Cogeco and more. It offers NHL regular season and select playoff games that are played outside the local viewing area using American local and national television networks such as Fox Sports Net and other sports networks like NBC. It offers both standard and high definition games. Blackout restrictions NHL Centre Ice does not black out any game based on attendance or mileage to said arena. All home teams are blacked out in their designated TV markets. For example, customers in Toronto cannot see Toronto Maple Leafs games on NHL Centre Ice; these local games are instead available on a local Toronto station. This creates a significant problem in areas that lie within the blackout zone but are not served by the NHL team's regional sports network. Erie, Pennsylvania is an American example of this: Erie is in the Buffalo Sabres' blackout zone, but MSG Network is not carried in that section of Pennsylvania, thus resulting in a total blackout of all Sabres games not carried on a national provider. (When Empire Sports Network existed, that outlet did serve Erie.) Blackouts can be lifted if one team is not televising the game and the other is, provided the non-broadcasting team grants permission. On some systems, WGN-TV Blackhawks games are not blacked out on WGN-TV in Canada even when they are playing a Canadian team even when it's the local team.

Raw bitumen, processed from Bituminous rocks, has an extremely high viscosity. Properties Bitumen has an extremely high viscosity, between 8 and 10 API degrees (at ambient temperatures), rendering it unusable for use in electric power stations. Bitumen can be modified by mixing it with fresh water and a small amount of phenol-based surfactant. The resulting mixture has properties similar to conventional fuel oil. A newer version of bitumen-based fuel has replaced the original version with an alcohol-based surfactant, making it easier to transport the fuel and eliminating the health concerns associated with the phenol group of surfactants.

He was also a member of the Orange Order in Canada. He was born in Clones, County Monaghan, Ireland around 1812 and came to Upper Canada in 1833. He worked for his brother-in-law in York, Upper Canada (later Toronto), then opened a dry goods business with another brother- in-law in 1838. He was president of the Toronto and Guelph Railway and also served on the board of directors of several other companies. In 1850, he was elected to city council and council selected him as mayor in 1851, 1852 and 1853. His mayoralty of Toronto was clouded by claims of corruption. In 1853 George Taylor Denison II, and several other alderman, resigned mid-term to protest what they described as Bowes corruption. Bowes and Francis Hincks had benefitted from a bailout of the Toronto, Simcoe & Lake Huron Union Railroad (later the Northern Railway. Hincks, in his capacity as the Province of Canada's Inspector General (effectively Finance Minister), had sponsored legislation to issue bonds to pay back the railway's investors, without revealing that he and Bowes had bought out a large block of the stock, at a discounted value. The pair netted a quick gain of 10,000 pounds - a fortune in those days. Although he was cleared of any charges, Bowes was forced to pay the profit that he had made to the city. In 1854, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada representing Toronto. He was elected to city council again in 1856 and served as mayor from 1861 to 1863.

The album story-line is now explained in the video, to a certain extent. Plot Techno Destructo is behind all of the major assaults on Gwar since his enslavement in 1991 - attracting the attention of the Morality Squad, summoning Cardinal Syn, who in turn dispatched Skulhedface, confusing the band into thinking the year was 1999 (rather than 1996), so that they would think the coming of Cardinal Syn was, in fact, the comet RagNaRok, and the slave revolts. Though they all ended in failure, he has yet another plan - genetically modify abused (by Gwar) penguins into his army, hypnotize Slymenstra Hymen with radioactive crack cocaine, and marry her (to spite Oderus Urungus). Techno builds a robot clone of Sleazy P. Martini, and uses him to distribute the crack, while the band beats up penguins (in their time-honored sport of \\"Penguin-Booting\\"). With the band incapacitated, he proposes to Slymenstra (the stone on the engagement ring is a piece of radioactive crack, as well), and sends the first wave of mutant penguins after Gwar. They are promptly defeated. The wedding, officiated by the Pope, turns into disaster, when the crack wears off, and Slymenstra uses her nether region to punish Techno. In the backdrop of \\"Hate Love Songs,\\" he jousts Oderus. After he is defeated again, he commandeers the microphone, regains his robotic arm (having been disarmed upon enslavement) with the slaves' help, and attacks Gwar. Though he initially defeats the band, Oderus and Slymenstra ultimately win out long enough for a newly revived Gor- Gor (revived with the radioactive crack residue) to start eating him. The concert ends with the subdued \\"Don't Need A Man\\" video, featuring Balsac the Jaws of Death on piano, Beefcake the Mighty on upright bass, Jizmak Da Gusha on a minimal (for him, at least) drum kit, and Slymenstra's lounge singing.

The English rose was bred by crossing the climber 'Aloha' with the floribunda 'Yellow Cushion' and is named after the industrialist Abraham Darby, the constructor of the first iron bridge, which is situated less than 15 km from David Austin's nurseries. The naming happened in collaboration with the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust. Flower colours under rather cold conditions Flower colours under warm conditions 'Abraham Darby' is an old-fashioned looking rose with many large, showy flowers with a classic quartered shape in an apricot-pink colour which varies with climate and age. It ranges from soft apricot pink on the inside, pale yellow on the outside in warmer areas to a rich peachy pink with lighter edges in cooler climates. Additionally the colour pales as the flower matures. The cupped flowers have an average diameter of and up to 70 petals. They usually have strong, fruity fragrance, grow in small clusters and appear abundantly throughout the season. As the rather heavy flowers tend to bow their heads, Abraham Darby is suited to be trained as a climber. The cultivar is winter hardy down to ‚àí20 ¬∞C (USDA zone 6 ‚Äì 10b) and generally disease resistant, but can be susceptible to rust. The vigorous plant grows very bushy growing approximately high and wide. It is almost thornless and has glossy, leathery foliage of a medium to dark green colour. Due to its long arching shoots, it can be grown as a freestanding shrub or trained as a climber, if given some support. The cultivar can be used in flower beds, rose borders, landscaping or as container rose in sunny or partially shaded locations, and is well suited as cut flower. 'Abraham Darby' is used as a parent rose and was used to hybridise the cultivars 'Crown Princess Margareta' (1991), 'Golden Celebration' (1992), 'Pat Austin' (1995) and 'Marianne' (2001).

Written by Charles Chilton, it was originally intended to be a sequel to his Journey into Space series (broadcast in the 1950s), using the cast which had just made a one-off revival of that series (\\"The Return From Mars\\"); while this idea was dropped late in the development of the serial, the four characters are nevertheless essentially the same as those from the earlier series, albeit with different names. The first series begins during the northern summer of 2010. Both series seem to initially mirror the first two Journey Into Space stories before branching off into quite different plots. A second series, known as Space Force 2, featured the same main characters, once again played by Barry Foster, Nigel Stock, Nicky Henson, and Tony Osoba. Within both series, Space Force is the name of the team's spaceship, rather than the name of an organisation. Each episode had an approximate run-time of 30 minutes. First series The episodes of the first series, broadcast in 1984, were: # \\"The Voice from Nowhere\\" (4 April 1984) # \\"Towards the Unknown\\" (11 April 1984) # \\"The Silver Strangers\\" (18 April 1984) # \\"The Time Ship\\" (25 April 1984) # \\"Threshold of the Stars\\" (2 May 1984) # \\"Marooned in Space\\" (9 May 1984) Second series The episodes of the second series, broadcast in 1985, were: # \\"The Return of the Sun God\\" (13 May 1985) # \\"The Red Planet\\" (20 May 1985) # \\"The Great Martian Pyramid\\" (27 May 1985) # \\"A Test of Endurance\\" (3 June 1985) # \\"Living with Death\\" (10 June 1985) # \\"Unto Death and Beyond\\" (17 June 1985) Characters The main characters in Space Force were: {  - !

It is a set of rules of how to build a melody which can ignite a certain mood in the reciter and listeners. The Sikh holy scripture, Guru Granth Sahib Ji, is composed in and divided into a total of 60 ragas. This is a combination of 31 single raags and 29 \\"mishrit\\" raags (a raag composed by combining two or three raags together). Each raga is a chapter or section in the Guru Granth Sahib starting with Asaa raag, and all the hymns produced in Asaa raag are found in this section ordered chronologically by the Guru or other Bhagat that have written hymns in that raga. All raags in the Guru Granth Sahib Ji are named as \\"Raag\\". Following is the list of all sixty Raags under which Gurbani is written, in order of appearance with page numbers. 1\\\\.

Jaijavanti ---------------1352 Raags are used in Sikh music simply to create a mood, and are not restricted to particular times. A mood can be created by the music of the raag regardless of the time of day. There are a total of 60 raags or melodies within the Guru Granth Sahib. Each melody sets a particular mood for the hymn, adding a deeper dimension to it. The Guru Granth Sahib is thought by many to have just 31 raags or melodies which is correct of single raags. However, combined with \\"mishrit\\" raags, that total is 60. 1\\\\. Raag Aasaa (‡®Ü‡®∏‡®æ) ‚Äì Aasaa has strong emotions of inspiration and courage. This Raag gives the listener the determination and ambition to put aside any excuses and to proceed with the necessary action to achieve the aim. It generates feelings of passion and zeal to succeed and the energy generated from these feelings enables the listener to find the strength from within to achieve success, even when the achievement seems difficult. The determined mood of this Raag ensures that failure is not an option and motivates the listener to be inspired. 2\\\\. Raag Gujari (‡®ó‡©Ç‡®ú‡®∞‡©Ä) ‚Äì If there is a perfect simile for Raag Gujari, it would be that of a person isolated in the desert, who has their hands cupped, holding water. However, it is only when the water begins to slowly seep through their joined hands that the person comes to realise the real value and importance of the water. Similarly Raag Gujari leads the listener to realise and become aware of passing time and in this way comes to value the precious nature of time itself. The revelation brings the listener to an awareness and admission of their own death and mortality, making them utilize their remaining ‚Äòlife time‚Äô more wisely. 3\\\\. Raag Gauri Deepaki (‡®ó‡®â‡©ú‡©Ä ‡®¶‡©Ä‡®™‡®ï‡©Ä) ‚Äì In the Guru Granth Sahib, there is one shabad (hymn) under the title Raag Gauri Deepaki. In this shabad, Sohila is a lorrie (lullaby), which is narrating a kind of bedtime story. This Raag generates feelings of warmth and security, just like a mother singing a lullaby to her child. Lullabies were traditionally used not only as a way of comforting a child, but also as a means in which mothers shared their past experiences and knowledge. Similarly this Raag enlightens the listener through knowledge and experience and brings them to the realization that to gain the truth, you must first realize that you are in darkness. This enlightened state gives the listener a feeling of certainty, fearlessness and a new hope for the future. 4\\\\. Raag Dhanasari (‡®ß‡®®‡®æ‡®∏‡®∞‡©Ä) ‚Äì Dhanasari is a sense of being completely carefree. This sensation arises from a feeling of contentment and ‚Äòrichness‚Äô from the things we have in our lives and gives the listener a positive and optimistic attitude towards the future. 5\\\\. Raag Gauri Purbi (‡®ó‡®â‡©ú‡©Ä ‡®™‡©Ç‡®∞‡®¨‡©Ä) ‚Äì Gauri Purbi contains strong emotions of experience along with feelings of preparation, in order to go further and to achieve more. Although there are confident feelings in this Raag, there is a sense of uncertainty as there is a heartfelt request for help to achieve the desired goal. The sentiments of this Raag are well considered assessments of the circumstances, without excess confidence or extreme helplessness. 6\\\\. Raag Siri Raag (‡®∏‡®ø‡®∞‡©Ä ‡®∞‡®æ‡®ó‡©Å) ‚Äì The basis of this Raag is steeped in the traditions of mainstream Indian Classical music. Siri Raag is serious and thought provoking in its nature and creates an atmosphere where the listener is led to heed the advice given therein. The listener (the mind) is made aware of the truth of the message and with this ‚Äòeducation‚Äô is given the strength to face the future with both humility and the ‚Äògained‚Äô knowledge. 7\\\\. Raag Majh (‡®Æ‡®æ‡®ù) ‚Äì Raag Majh was composed by the Fifth Sikh Guru (Shri Guru Arjun Dev ji). The Raag's origins are based in Punjabi Folk Music and its essence was inspired by the Majha regions traditions of ‚ÄòAusian‚Äô; the game of waiting and yearning for the return of a loved one. The feelings evoked by this Raag have often been compared to that of a mother waiting for her child to return after a long period of separation. She has an anticipation and hope for the child's return, although at the same moment she is painfully aware of the uncertainty of their return home. This Raag brings to life the emotion of extreme love and this is highlighted by the sorrow and anguish of separation. 8\\\\. Raag Gauri Guarairi (‡®ó‡®â‡©ú‡©Ä ‡®ó‡©Å‡®Ü‡®∞‡©á‡®∞‡©Ä) ‚Äì Gauri Guarairi contains a mixture of calmness and control in feeling, however the emotional message of the Raag is open and truthful in its approach. The emotions are conveyed in a direct and disciplined way. The balanced and focused character of this Raag is evident in its structure, in that its scale is restricted to ‚Äòmadh saptak‚Äô (middle scale). 9\\\\. Raag Gauri (‡®ó‡®â‡©ú‡©Ä) ‚Äì Gauri creates a mood where the listener is encouraged to strive harder in order to achieve an objective. However, the encouragement given by the Raag does not allow the ego to increase. This therefore creates the atmosphere where the listener is encouraged, but still prevented from becoming arrogant and self- important. 10\\\\. Raag Gauri Dakhani (‡®ó‡®â‡©ú‡©Ä ‡®¶‡®ñ‡®£‡©Ä) ‚Äì Gauri Dakhani has a similar nature to Gauri; however, the South Indian style of this Raag, including the taal (rhythm) highlights the strict and disciplined aspect of Gauri. 11\\\\. Raag Gauri Chayti (‡®ó‡®â‡©ú‡©Ä ‡®ö‡©á‡®§‡©Ä) ‚Äì Gauri Chayti generates a deliberate sensation of fear by creating a conscious reminder of what may occur if we loose the things we take for granted. It awakens feelings of panic and regret, by exposing the listener to the possible outcome of what might happen should this warning not be heeded. 12\\\\. Raag Gauri Bairagan (‡®ó‡®â‡©ú‡©Ä ‡®¨‡©à‡®∞‡®æ‡®ó‡®£‡®ø) ‚Äì As the title suggests Gauri ‚ÄòBairagan‚Äô is a Raag of bairaag (sadness of separation). The listener is left with an intense feeling of sorrow and emptiness. However, the balance of Raag Gauri ensures that this sense of loss and sadness motivates the listener to try to discover exactly what is missing. Gauri Bairagan therefore evokes feelings of sadness, which become a lesson, as opposed to creating a sense of depression. 13\\\\. Raag Gauri Purbi Deepaki (‡®ó‡®â‡©ú‡©Ä ‡®™‡©Ç‡®∞‡®¨‡©Ä ‡®¶‡©Ä‡®™‡®ï‡©Ä) ‚Äì The tone of this Raag is that of self-assessment with a positive attitude of improvement. It creates an atmosphere of constantly progressing with confidence and experience, as well as instilling a positive belief of enduring achievement. 14\\\\. Raag Gauri Majh (‡®ó‡®â‡©ú‡©Ä ‡®Æ‡®æ‡®ù) ‚Äì Gauri Majh is a well-planned emotional ‚Äòact‚Äô, which reaches out to fulfil a yearning created by the Raag. This yearning is similar to that of Raag Majh's regret, hope and anticipation, however in this instance it is created deliberately in order to sway the listener to react to the longing. 15\\\\. Raag Gauri Malva (‡®ó‡©å‡©ú‡©Ä ‡®Æ‡®æ‡®≤‡®µ‡®æ) ‚Äì Gauri Malva is based on Punjabi Folk music and is influenced by the ‚ÄòMalva‚Äô region of Punjab and the Malvaee hospitality. The nature of this Raag can be compared to the thoughtful, very serious, yet caring advice given by a true friend. The Raag persuades the listener with such truth and friendliness, that it is impossible to disagree, even if the listener does not like the advice being given. 16\\\\. Raag Gauri Mala (‡®ó‡®â‡©ú‡©Ä ‡®Æ‡®æ‡®≤‡®æ) ‚Äì The essence of Gauri Mala is a combination of good, pure, true and positive thoughts added together one by one. There is a feeling of having worked hard and an increased energy, which encourages more devotion towards the truth. 17\\\\. Raag Gauri Sorath (‡®ó‡®â‡©ú‡©Ä ‡®∏‡©ã‡®∞‡®†‡®ø) ‚Äì Gauri Sorath has a definite feeling of attraction and appeal, which woos the listener's attention to the subject matter or target. However, the feelings of being enticed and lured are balanced with a sense of duty and realisation, of needing to obey the warning given. 18\\\\. Raag Aasaa Kafi (‡®Ü‡®∏‡®æ ‡®ï‡®æ‡®´‡©Ä) ‚Äì Aasaa Kafi has a carefree and self-assured nature. It is confident in its outlook and does not hold onto any false hopes. The feelings of boundless energy, along with the confidence gained by previous experiences, create an inspirational atmosphere for the listener. 19\\\\. Raag Asavari (‡®Ü‡®∏‡®æ‡®µ‡®∞‡©Ä) ‚Äì Asavari has an atmosphere of real energy and enthusiasm, which encourages the listener to complete the necessary tasks. However, the mood of this Raag is genuine and there is therefore no pretence of showing off its hardworking nature. 20\\\\. Raag Aasaa Asavari (‡®Ü‡®∏‡®æ ‡®Ü‡®∏‡®æ‡®µ‡®∞‡©Ä) ‚Äì Aasaa Asavari provides a sense of assurance to achieve your desired goal with courage, love and confidence. It is a precise direction toward achieving a set outcome, with confidence and positivity fuelled with a burst of energy. The nature of this raag is to produce a strong sense of capability in the listener, converting energy into passion with the motivation to repeat this positivity. The strength of this raag churns out the best of a personality providing the individual with the necessary knowledge to bring thoughts into action. 21\\\\. Raag Devgandhari (‡®¶‡©á‡®µ‡®ó‡©∞‡®ß‡®æ‡®∞‡©Ä) ‚Äì Devgandhari conveys the feeling of satisfaction that comes from making an achievement. These emotions make the listener feel empowered to do more and diminish any feelings of laziness. This state of satisfaction is that of extreme happiness and contentment, and leaves the listener with the feeling of being in paradise. 22\\\\. Raag Bihagara (‡®¨‡®ø‡®π‡®æ‡®ó‡©ú‡®æ) ‚Äì The mood of Bihagara is that of extreme sadness and pain, which gives rise to the need to find peace and understanding. The heightened emotional state of sadness is only harnessed by the craving for truth and meaning. 23\\\\.

League Park was actually the first of three parks to stand on the site: :1884‚Äì1901: League Park :1902‚Äì1911: Palace of the Fans :1912‚Äì1970: Redland Field, renamed Crosley Field in 1934 History During the Cincinnati Reds' first two seasons, the club played at the Bank Street Grounds. Following the 1883 season, the Reds were forced to abandon the park, because the lease had been bought out from under them by the new Cincinnati entry in the one-year wonder called the Union Association. The Reds had to find a new location, and they found one less than a mile away from their old park, a few blocks to the southeast on Western Avenue, at the northwest corner of where Findlay Street intersected Western. Thus the Reds remained in the West End, and fans had only to traverse Western Avenue to see the team of their choice. The new facility was variously called Cincinnati Base Ball Grounds (or Park), Western Avenue Grounds, American Park (while in the AA), and then its most enduring pre-1912 name, League Park (beginning 1890). The small grandstand for the new park was built in the southeast corner of the block, tucked into the acute angle made by the intersection. Although the diamond would be moved back and forth between the southeast and the southwest corners several times, the little 1884 structure would be retained for 28 seasons, and would come in handy. However, it got off to a bad start. It was constructed hastily, and during the opening day game a portion of the stand collapsed, killing one spectator and injuring several others. The park was also very short to right field, with balls hit over the right field fence counting only as a double, until additional land was acquired a few weeks into the season. This increased the distance to right by 50 feet and made the field regulation-sized. Seating chart of the ballpark in 1884 The first game to be played at American Park was on April 9, 1884. It was an exhibition game against the then National League Cleveland Blues. The Reds first official home opening day at American Park was on May 1, 1884 against their American Association rival the Columbus Buckeyes. Cincinnati lost that game 10-9 in heartbreaking fashion. The season itself saw a good deal of competition between the Reds and the Unions. Although many called the Union the \\"Onion League\\" due to its lopsided distribution of talent, the Cincinnati Unions were a fairly strong team and drew fans away from the Reds. Once the Union folded, the Reds opted to remain at Findlay and Western, and would continue to do so for the better part of nine decades. Thus the Reds had the city to themselves in 1885. Although the Reds were not participants in the 1885 World Series, their ballpark was. The contest, between the Chicago White Stockings of the NL and the St. Louis Browns of the AA, staged some of its games at neutral sites. The Reds' ballpark was the site for the final two games of the Series, a disputed match that officially ended in a draw. When the Reds returned to the National League in 1890, the name of the park would come to be known as League Park, in reference to the team's original and now current circuit. In those days, the National League was typically referred to in media as \\"the League\\", since there was only one \\"League\\" and (for ten years) one \\"Association\\". Rebuilt ballpark in 1894 In 1894 the ballpark went through some major changes. The owner of the Reds, John Brush, would build a brand new grandstand and add an amphitheater. In order to build a new grandstand he had the diamond shifted from the southeast corner (Findlay and Western) to the southwest corner (Findlay and McLean). Brush chose to retain the old seating as a right field pavilion. This would prove to be a wise decision. The name of the ballpark was not changed. Because of the relocated diamond, some historians refer to it as League Park II. The center field area was painted black in 1895 to form a batter's eye screen. Some sources (such as Benson) claim this was the first such screen in baseball. On May 28 1900, the ballpark caught on fire, burning the 1894 grandstand. The Reds considered moving to East End Park where the short-lived \\"Kelly's Killers\\" Association club had played in 1891. Instead, they opted to shift the diamond back to its original location in the southeast corner, reusing the original grandstand, which was not significantly harmed in the fire due to a gap between the two seating areas. They played a month's worth of games on the road, returning to their reconfigured home on June 28. After a season and a half of playing in the charred ballpark, the Reds built what they expected to be a more permanent new grandstand, again in the southwest corner, retaining the original seating, and again with a gap between the seating areas that would prove fortuitous. The original seating had changed somewhat over time, as the middle section no longer sat higher than the rest, and the entire structure was roofed. The look of the new grandstand was striking, and the owners named it Palace of the Fans. While the park was still referred to as League Park until 1911, the grandstand nickname is what the park has become known as today.

Contrayerva, or contrajerva, is the medicinal rhizome of various tropical Central American and South American species of Dorstenia in the family Moraceae, mainly Dorstenia contrajerva and the closely related Dorstenia drakena but also Dorstenia brasiliensis. The word contrayerva means ‚Äúcounter herb‚Äù in Spanish. It was given this name since a 16th-century description (see below) claimed that the leaves of a herb (yerva = hierba) were used by South American Indians to counter the deadly poisonous effect of the same herb (‚Äúcontra yerva‚Äù) when used as an arrow poison. Seventeenth century herbalists and botanists identified this herb as the aromatic root that had been brought from Peru to England by Francis Drake, and claimed that it was an antidote against all kinds of poison. By the late 18th century contrayerva had lost its reputation as an antidote, but it continued to be listed in European and American pharmacopoeias and herbals until the 1920s as a gentle stimulant, tonic and diaphoretic.Grieve, M. ‚ÄúContrayerva‚Äù, A Modern Herbal. Retrieved on 14.10.2017.Tropical Plant Database. ‚ÄúContrayerva (Dorstenia brasiliensis)‚Äù. Retrieved 15.10.2017.Remington, Joseph P.; Wood, Horatio C.; and others. The Dispensatory of the United States of America, Twentieth Edition, Philadelphia 1918. It is still used in folk medicine in Central and South America. Description of the contrayerva root In the entry \\"Contra-yerva\\" in Chambers‚Äô Cyclopedia of 1728, it is said that the root is smaller than that of the iris, reddish outside and white inside, knotty, and fibrous. To be of use, it must be new, heavy, and of a dusky red color. Its odor resembles that of fig leaves. Its taste is aromatic, accompanied with some acrimony.Chambers, Ephraim. Cyclopaedia: or, An Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, Vol. 1, London 1728: 319 Dorstenia drakena William Woodville wrote in Medical Botany: \\"The root of Contrayerva has a peculiar kind of aromatic smell, and a light astringent warm bitterish taste, and on being long chewed it discovers somewhat of a sweetish sharpness. According to Lewis, 'Contrayerva root gives out its virtue, by the assistance of heat, both to water and rectified spirit, and tinges the former of a dark brownish red, the latter of a brighter reddish colour: the watery decoction is very mucilaginous, so as not to pass through a filter.' [Lewis Mat. Med.]\\"Woodville, William. \\"Dorstenia contrayerva. Contrayerva\\" in Medical Botany, 1790-1794. Second edition, 1810, Vol. I, p. 485. The Dispensatory of the United States of America (1918) describes the root, as found in commerce, as oblong, long, of varying thickness, very hard, rough, and solid, of a reddish-brown color externally, and pale within; and has numerous, long, slender, yellowish rootlets attached to its inferior part. The odor is aromatic; the taste warm, slightly bitter, and pungent. The sensible properties are extracted by alcohol and boiling water. The decoction is highly mucilaginous. The tincture reddens infusion of litmus, and precipitates on the addition of water. Dorstenia brasiliensis Origin of the contrayerva root The official contrayerva root or radix contrayervae in 18th century English medical literature was Dorstenia contrajerva, but the roots of other Dorstenia species such as the closely related Dorstenia drakenaand Dorstenia brasiliensis were also often collected and sold. The 18th century physician and botanist William Woodville wrote: ‚Äúupon the faith of Dr. Houston, who examined the Contrayerva plants in their native soil, we should otherwise have had no doubt in referring the official radix contrayervae to the species (i.e. Dorstenia contrajerva) he has described, as has been done by Bergius and Murray. But as Houston has observed, that the roots of different species of Dorstenia are promiscuously gathered and exported for those of the Contrayerva; and as all the species bear a great resemblance to each other, we conceive the further discussion of this subject to be of no material consequence.‚Äù The 19th century English pharmacologist Jonathan Pereira wrote in his Elements of Materia Medica that the Contrayerva root ‚Äúusually met in the shops‚Äù is not Dorstenia contrajerva but Dorstenia brasiliensis‚Äî‚ÄúA native of Jamaica, Brazil, and Trinidad.‚ÄùPereira, Jonathan. The Elements of Materia Medica and Therapeutics, Vol. II, Part I, London 1855: 381 The first mention of contrayerva is found in Nicol√°s Monardes Historia medicinal de las cosas que se traen de nuestras Indias Occidentales, 1580. In this work Monardes reproduced a letter by an informant in Peru, the Spaniard Pedro de Osma y de Xara y Zejo, who writes that he has been informed by his soldier cousin that the leaves of a herb (‚Äúyerua‚Äù = yerva = hierba) with broad leaves resembling those of the plantain are used as by the native Indians as a counter herb (‚Äúcontra yerua‚Äù) against injuries caused by arrows poisoned with the deadly poison made from this same poisonous herb (‚Äúuna yerua, que es contra yerua‚Äù).‚Äúnos dize hallado una yerua, que es contra yerua, de la que los Caribes, que mata sin remedio: la qual usan aquellos Indios valientes en sus guerras y ca√ßas: los quales biuen desde las Charcas hasta Chile: que biuen como Alara bes, manteniendo se de solamente ca√ßa, y carne humana.

A report recorded by Hans Sloane in the early 18th century describes the manner the Spanish in America are said to have discovered the use of the contrayerva: When a Spaniard was injured by a poison arrow shot by an Indian, the Spaniards threatened to injure one of their Indian prisoners with a poisoned arrow unless he revealed the cure. Thereupon the ‚ÄúIndian immediately chaw'd some of this Contra Yerva, and put it into the wound, and it healed.‚ÄùSloane, Hans. A voyage to the islands Madera, Barbados, Nieves, S.

The slightly roasted and ground root is used to treat intestinal worms and parasites. The crushed root is mixed with water to treat the bites of snakes. In Nicaragua the boiled root is used to prevent diarrhea; minced raw rhizomes are used to treat diarrhea, sickness, stomach upset, indigestion, and worms. In El Salvador it is used for stomachache and to prevent vomiting. In Costa Rica the boiled root is used in curing diarrhea, and an infusion to lower fever. It is considered useful in curing persistent diarrhea as well as an emmenagogue. In Mexico the latex is used to heal wounds and the inflorescences are given to teething children. In the Amazon region of Peru it is used as a tonic, against gangrene, and as an antidote for bee and wasp stings. In Argentina, the whole plant is used to treat snakebite. In Venezuela it is used as a sudorific and as a cure for dysentery.Ocampo, Rafael & Balick, Michael J. Plants of Semillas Sagradas: An Ethnomedicinal Garden in Costa Rica 2009: 40‚Äì41.

It shows first run movies as well as classics. Owners Buzz and Kathleen Cusack renovated the theater and reopened it on 15 October 2010. The theater closed again for more renovations on 26 April 2012. It has since reopened, with three smaller theaters adjacent to the main one. Architecture The Senator Theatre is an Art Deco landmark built by E. Eyring for Durkee Enterprises at an original cost of $250,000. It opened to the public Oct. 5, 1939. The first movie it featured was Stanley and Livingstone, starring Spencer Tracy and Nancy Kelly. The architect, John Jacob Zink, designed the Senator with a circular upper structure of glass blocks and limestone. Multicolored backlighting of the glass block was added to produce a dramatic effect at night. The lobby still features the original terrazzo floors, and art deco murals about the history of performing arts. A massive gold curtain still opens to dramatically reveal the screen before each performance. The theatre's interior is accented by a back lit sun-burst at the apex of the screen, and rainbow prisms in the recessed ceiling. \\"Originally, it had 1150 seats but that has gone down to 900.\\" The Senator Theatre also has two skyboxes for private parties. They are connected by a mezzanine overlooking the outer lobby and can host up to 40 people. The sidewalk in front of the theatre features a ‚Äòwalk of fame‚Äô which highlights local cinematic accomplishments. The Senator Theater was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. The Baltimore City Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation (CHAP) designated the Senator Theatre as a Baltimore City Landmark. Technical specifications The Senator Theatre boasts a massive, modern 40 ft curved screen, state of the art projection systems, and Dolby Digital sound with surround EX. Today, the Senator Theatre mainly showcases first run movies. It is able to screen films in 35mm or 70mm. Equipment includes a Bauer U2 projector with top of the line German lenses. In 2003, the Senator was selected to become the first venue to complete the Historic Cinema Certification Program offered by THX Ltd., the San-Rafael, California based company founded by George Lucas. The special skyboxes are also equipped with user-controlled digital sound. The snack bar offers traditional movie house snacks, and freshly popped, hot popcorn, with real butter upon request. Tickets are now $9 each. Reputation Many celebrities have attended movie premieres, fundraisers, and screenings at the Senator. They include: Matt Damon, Matthew McConaughey, John Travolta, Joaquin Phoenix, Salma Hayek, and Edward Norton. The Senator Theatre's facade has been featured in many movies and commercials. It was featured prominently in the cult film Cecil B. Demented, which showcased historic theatres around Baltimore. The theatre can also be seen in the movies Twelve Monkeys, Diner, and Avalon. The Senator was also featured prominently in Mario's 2002 music video \\"Just a Friend.\\" Directors John Waters and Barry Levinson premiere most of their films at the Senator. It often hosts East Coast premieres of films shot in and around Baltimore, including Ladder 49, Runaway Bride and The Accidental Tourist. The theatre also showcases films starring Baltimore area natives like Edward Norton and Jada Pinkett Smith. Several books feature the Senator Theatre, including Cinema Treasures, Popcorn Palaces, Exit: A History of Movies in Baltimore and Motion Picture Exhibition in Baltimore: An Illustrated History and Directory of Theatres. * The August 5th, 2005 issue of Entertainment Weekly Magazine ranked the Senator Theater fourth on the list of ‚Äú10 Theaters doing it right... movie houses that make watching films a dream‚Äù. * In its September 29, 2003 edition, USA Today declared the Senator Theatre to be one of America's best ‚ÄúPlaces to see a classic cinema‚Äù. * In 2001, the National Trust for Historical Preservation designated the Senator as America's quintessential independent historic movie house. On May 19, 2003 the National Main Street Center of the National Trust for Historic Preservation honored owner Tom Kiefaber with the ‚Äú2003 Business Leadership Award‚Äù. The award was ‚Äúin recognition of his tireless advocacy for historic, independent movie theaters\\". Fundraisers The Senator Theatre routinely hosts special events that have raised millions of dollars for local charities. * Each December, the Senator holds an annual Holiday Classics Series on the large screen as a means of raising donations of food and cash to the Maryland Food Bank. \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and \\"A Christmas Carol\\" are usually shown. * On February 22, 2007, the Senator Theatre hosted an American Heart Association Go Red for Women campaign fundraiser starring Gretchen Wilson. Special screenings The Senator Theatre has been the site of extended camp-outs where diehard fans await tickets for premieres of epic movie offerings, including series like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter. It is also the place where Maryland's big media franchises typically go to cover movie openings, and interview hardcore fans. The theatre has also hosted midnight shows of fan favorites such as the Star Wars movies. The Senator Theatre has been used as a venue within Maryland Film Festival. The Senator also hosts free screenings classic films in cooperation with community enrichment initiatives. * The 1928 silent comedy classic \\"Speedy\\" starring Harold Lloyd was screened on February 19, 2007. It was accompanied by live music from Alloy Orchestra as part of Loyola College's 2007 Humanities Symposium. * A free screening of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" (1962) starring Gregory Peck was held on Saturday, March 24, 2007. Recent struggles Senator Theatre with 2008 marquee The Senator theatre was scheduled to be auctioned on February 21, 2007. The auction was avoided due to $109,000 (USD) in donations through a grassroots campaign. The Senator's struggles have been attributed to a practice known as ‚Äúclearance‚Äú. Movie \\"clearing\\" or blocking occurs when rival theatres, usually multiplexes, invoke agreements with distribution houses to exclude a nearby theatre from ever concurrently running the same films that are running on any of their screens. The Senator's former owner, Tom Kiefaber explained: \\"We eventually overcame the (rival multiplexes') clearance, but without equal access to the first-run lifeblood of the film exhibition industry during that difficult period, we were forced to accumulate debt that is a continuing detriment to the economic viability of The Senator Theatre.‚Äú The good news is that \\"if we are able to avert the auction sale...our district will soon become a ‚Äôfree zone‚Äô and the primary impediment to our profitability, a restrictive film clearance...by an independent Baltimore multiplex... will soon come to a blessed end.‚Äú \\"(O)ur well-established, activist, anti-film clearance position (has been) outlined... in the national, [but alas not local] media coverage we have received over the years on the subject... in The New York Times, U.S. News & World Report, Forbes Small Business Magazine, USA Today, CBS Sunday Morning, and ABC News among others.\\" The Senator Theatre ceased showing first run movies on 15 March 2009. According to their website, \\"Senator Theatre management has announced that the screening of Watchmen on Sunday evening, March 15th, was the final first-run film to be shown at the renowned theatre in its 70 year history.\\" It was revealed the theatre was again facing possible foreclosure. On March 16, 2009, a town hall meeting was held by the local neighborhoods to rally support to save the Senator Theatre from the pending foreclosure and make it into a cultural center. No general agreement could be made to determine an effort in moving forward in the community's efforts to save the theatre. Attendees were told to wait a few more days as the neighborhood trust releases more details. The Baltimore Sun noted the following on March 17, 2009: \\"The Senator Theatre stopped selling tickets Sunday night, as owner Tom Kiefaber unexpectedly closed the financially troubled movie house.\\" The City of Baltimore bought the mortgage to the Theatre in May 2009, and purchased the property (essentially from itself) at auction on July 23, 2009. New owners have renovated the theater and plan additional renovations following its scheduled October 15, 2010 reopening. These include an additional screen, a small-plate restaurant, and a bar inside the lobby. They have uncovered original wooden paneling in the lobby's rotunda. The Senator closed in September 2012 and opened on October 10, 2013, with a screening of Baltimore local, John Waters', classic movie Hairspray.

MacKenzie (DD-836) was a of the United States Navy, named for Lieutenant Commander George K. MacKenzie (1910‚Äì1943). George K. MacKenzie was launched on 13 May 1945 by the Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine; sponsored by Miss Donna MacKenzie, daughter; and commissioned on 13 July 1945, Commander Alvin W. Slayden in command. Service history 1945-1950 After shakedown off Cuba, MacKenzie returned to Boston, Massachusetts on 15 September 1945 and subsequently participated in the Navy Day celebrations on 27 October at Savannah, Georgia She served with the Operational Development Force at Norfolk, Virginia, her home port, and conducted training exercises and escort duties along the Atlantic seaboard until sailing on 5 January 1948 on a goodwill tour to Buenos Aires, Argentina. MacKenzie returned to Norfolk on 9 February after these duties as a \\"steel grey diplomat\\" and continued peacetime operations, highlighted by a Midshipman cruise June to July 1948 to Portugal, Italy, North Africa, and Cuba. In October 1948 the destroyer sailed for the Near East, where she supported the United Nations Palestine Patrol and the allied occupation of Trieste, returning to Newport, Rhode Island for Christmas. After overhaul at Boston until April 1949, George K. MacKenzie continued peacetime training on the eastern seaboard, and made a \\"Med\\" cruise from January to May 1950. When the uneasy truce in the Far East was shattered by the North Korean aggression, MacKenzie was transferred to the Pacific. She arrived Pearl Harbor on 1 July 1950 to prepare for wartime service. Korean War, 1950-1953 During her first tour in Korea, from 26 July 1950 to 30 January 1951, she screened attack carriers during strikes on North Korean targets and provided close support for advancing Allied armies. After a repair period at San Diego, California from 15 February to 17 July 1951, she returned to perform the same vital screening and support duties until April 1952. George K. MacKenzie provided antisubmarine screening and fired several important bombardment missions at Wonsan Harbor, 16 to 17 January and again 23 February to 21 March 1953 in support of United Nations forces. She lent effective fire support to troops in the vicinity of Suwon Dan from 15 to 19 April 1953 in company with and demolished sections of the enemy's railroad along the eastern coast of Korea in May. 1953-1959 Homeported in San Diego and Long Beach, California, she completed a total of nine tours of duty in the Far East, including training exercises and duty with the Taiwan patrol between 1953 and 1959. 1960-1967 George K. MacKenzie's homeport was changed to Yokosuka, Japan. Throughout various periods of 1960 and 1961, while otherwise home ported at Yokosuka Japan, the Mac would often be deployed for patrol in the Straits of Taiwan, not infrequently steaming the Straits while the Taiwanese Army traded cannonade with the Communist mainland; the Mack also challenged shipping headed to Communist ports and conducted shipboard inspections for armaments disallowed the enemy. (please edit). During on 15 February 1960 as she also continued her peacetime training duties, visiting Hong Kong, the Philippines and other Far Eastern ports, including those in Japan. In 1961 MacKenzie sailed from Subic Bay, P.I., on 23 March to rendezvous with carriers and in the South China Sea to act during the Laos crisis as a powerful on-the-spot force, if needed. Fortunately, the crisis passed; and after further operations George K. MacKenzie put in at her new home port of New York on 11 December 1962. She entered Brooklyn Navy Yard for modernization, returning to sea in October 1963. MacKenzie then made preparations to return to her new homeport of Long Beach, California, where she arrived on 28 January 1964 to prepare for extended duty in the Far East. She left the West Coast on 26 May and reached Yokosuka, Japan, on 13 June to begin over two years of continuous service in Oriental waters operating alternately in Japanese waters and off Vietnam fighting to repel Communist aggression. She specialized in screening aircraft carriers and shelling Communist positions ashore. The battle-tested destroyer returned to Long Beach on 3 August 1966 for a major overhaul to prepare for future action. In mid-1967 she was again in the Far East aiding in the struggle to save Southeast Asia. On 29 July she was screening when fire broke out on the carrier's flight deck. After helping to put out the flames, she escorted the stricken flattop to Subic Bay for repairs. 1968-1970 George K. MacKenzie again changed homeport from Long Beach to Yokosuka, Japan, in July 1968 with Destroyer Squadron Three. The next two years were mostly spent in the waters off Vietnam serving on Yankee Station and providing naval gun fire support to forces in South Vietnam with some time in the Sea of Japan off North Korea. Port visits included Subic Bay, Kaohsiung and Keelung, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Bangkok. CAPT Sherwin J. Sleeper was relieved as Commanding Officer by CDR James A. Allen in May 1969. In July 1970 the entire squadron returned together to San Diego with homeward-bound pennants flying, to be greeted at the pier by Governor Reagan, Senator Murphy, the COMCRUDESPAC Band and several hundred family members and well-wishers. The ship received a Navy Unit Commendation for this period. After a short break the ship moved to the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for a five-month overhaul. 1971-1976 George K. MacKenzie was deployed to Vietnam in 1971 again with the mission of fleet defense and shore bombardment with other vessels, including the cruiser USS Newport News} In the Spring of 1972 she participated in Operation Freedom Train conducting shore bombardment of targets in North Vietnam and in operation Linebacker 1 and Linebacker 2 it may be noted here that during this arduous tour of duty she fired 16,549 rounds of 5\\"/38 ammunition. She returned home to San Diego in August 1972, three months later than planned. She received a second Navy Unit Commendation for this deployment. After a brief stand-down period, she was again selected to conduct a midshipman training cruise with 20 third- and first-class midshipmen embarked. During this training period, the MacKenzie was ordered to perform plane guard duty for the , due to soon rotate back to Vietnam. George K. MacKenzie put to sea to await a rendezvous with the carrier, which was still in port. However, Ranger never sailed because of damage to the #3 main engine reduction gear due to sabotage. To provide at-sea time for the midshipmen, and a time for R&R; for the crew, MacKenzie was given permission to sail to Coos Bay, Oregon for the annual Salmon Festival, she then deployed again back to Vietnam to provide NGFS to South Vietnamese forces and saw the war end later the year. Decommissioning and disposal George K. MacKenzie was decommissioned on 30 September 1976, and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 October 1976. She was sunk as a target off California on 15 October 1976. Awards George K. MacKenzie was awarded six battle stars for Korean service. References * *USS George K.

DMORTs are activated in response to large scale disasters in the United States to assist in the identification of deceased individuals and storage of the bodies pending the bodies being claimed. Organization For organizational purposes, the country is divided into ten regions, each with a regional coordinator. For the duration of their service, DMORT members work under the local authorities at the disaster site and their professional licenses are recognized by all states. DMORT Teams: * REGION I (ME, NH, VT, MA, CT, RI) * REGION II (NY, NJ, PR, VI) * REGION III (PA, MD, DC, DE, VA, WV) * REGION IV (AL, KY, TN, NC, SC, GA, MS, FL) * REGION V (MN, WI, IL, IN, MI, OH) * REGION VI (NM, TX, OK, AR, LA) * REGION VII (NE, IA, KS, MO) * REGION VIII (MT, ND, SD, WY, UT, CO) * REGION IX (AZ, NV, CA, HI) * REGION X (WA, AK, OR, ID) DMORTs are organized under the Department of Health and Human Services National Disaster Medical System. The DMORTs are composed of civilian funeral directors, medical examiners, coroners, pathologists, forensic anthropologists, fingerprint specialists, forensic odontologists, dental assistants, and radiographers. They are supported by medical records technicians and transcribers, mental health specialists, computer professionals, administrative support staff, and security and investigative personnel. When a DMORT is activated, the personnel on the team are treated and paid as a temporary Federal employee. The Department of Health and Human Services maintains three Disaster Portable Morgue Units (DPMU) which are staged at HHS Logistics Centers, one each in Frederick, Maryland, Fort Worth, Texas, and San Jose, California. Each DPMU is a cache of equipment and supplies for a complete morgue with designated workstations for each process the DMORT team is required to complete. History In the 1980s, the National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA) formed a committee to address the need for a way of dealing with mass casualty situations. The group had the goal of formulating a plan for funeral directors to deal with the situation. As the committee worked on the plan, it was revealed that such a situation would call for multiple forensic specialties. The committee created the first portable morgue unit in the country. The committee's work came to the attention of the Federal Government following the complaints of families whose family members had been lost in airline incidents. The families felt that the remains hadn't received adequate treatment. The United States Congress passed the Family Assistance Act in 1996. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was assigned the role of managing the Federal response to aviation disaster victims and their families. The division responsible for this response was the Office of Family Affairs, later renamed the Office of Transportation Disaster Assistance. The NTSB made use of DMORTs to handle large scale transportation disasters. Following the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002, the DMORTs were moved into the Emergency Preparedness and Response directorate as part of the National Disaster Medical System. In 2007 the National Disaster Medical System was removed from DHS and returned to the Department of Health and Human Services under the control of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response.[reference does not support statement] Identification of remains Identification of remains is a two-part process that utilizes a sophisticated computer program for matching physical characteristics. The families of the deceased provide as much information about them as possible: dental records, x-rays, photographs or descriptions of tattoos, clothing and jewelry; blood type information and objects that may contain the deceased's DNA, such as hair or a toothbrush. The information gathered, called antemortem, or \\"before death\\" information, is entered into a computer program called VIP (Victim Identification Profile), which is capable of assimilating 800 different item categories, including graphics, photographs and x-rays. As forensic scientists (pathologists, anthropologists, odontologists) examine the recovered remains, they enter their findings‚Äîcalled postmortem data‚Äîinto VIP (Victim Identification Profile). Depending on the availability of data, the WIN-VIP system enables scientists to match the remains to their identity. Incidents For the World Trade Center attack, Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy G. Thompson activated the National Disaster Medical System. It was the first time this system had been activated on a full nationwide basis. In Manhattan, a team set up morgue outside Bellevue Hospital. In 2006, DMORT operated the Find Family National Call Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. This is the center of all operations concerning the location and reuniting of families scattered by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. Out of nearly 13,000 people reported missing after the impacts of hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Stan, and Wilma, nearly 7,000 were found alive and reunited with their families.

The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting and focuses on facing the permanent insecurity of a dystopian, decaying and hazardous world, and humanity's darkest inclinations towards brutality and materialism. Originally under development by Darkworks from 2003 until 2008, Ubisoft Shanghai completed the title. It was released for Xbox 360 on March 7, 2012, for PlayStation 3 on April 3, 2012 in North America and April 4, 2012 in the PAL region and also for Microsoft Windows on September 6, 2012. Plot The game takes place one year after America has gone through a massive disaster known simply as \\"The Event\\", which included earthquakes that destroyed most cities. Due to the damage of the aftermath, many people are forced to go without resources. The government tries to help citizens, but their attempts are useless. Supplies become low and this causes citizens to become agitated, violent and bitter. An unnamed male survivor travels to his old home of the fictional city of Haventon, to rescue his wife Julie and daughter Mary. When he gets to his apartment, he finds they have left to get to safety and meanwhile video tapes his apology for not being there and says that he will do everything to find them. As he is leaving, the protagonist sees a small girl who he mistakes for his daughter and saves her from three hostile men. The girl, Mei (Angela Galuppo), is missing her mother and gives the protagonist a walkie-talkie with which he talks to Henry (Elias Toufexis), a friend of Mei. Henry asks him to bring Mei to him and he agrees. The protagonist and Mei travel out to Henry's apartment, but soon stop in a dilapidated mall to rest during a dust storm. The protagonist notices that Mei has a fever, so he goes to find a supply drop that the government landed for survivors and is able to recover medicine for Mei. The two leave the next day and arrive at Henry's place, where the protagonist finds out that Henry is disabled and cannot walk. The protagonist is then tasked of finding a radio for Henry and traverses through the deadly dust clouds and makes it to an old boat. After searching the boat and finding the radio, the protagonist makes it off and travels back to Henry. The protagonist makes it back and Henry thanks him and finally trusts him as a friend. Henry also suspects that Mei's mother might be in a local hotel and pressures the protagonist into finding her for Mei. He gets to the hotel and fights through a large number of killers who have kidnapped, intimidated and hurt women to pressure them into performing sexual acts on the men. The protagonist finds Mei's mother, Linda (Jean Nicolai), and rescues her from the men. They both get back to Henry's place and Mei reunites with her mother. Linda is able to use the radio to get messages from a boat coming to Haventon to pick up survivors. This seems as their way out but they soon learn that the boat is not coming to shore because of the dust. Henry makes the plan of creating a beacon to bring in the boat by using fireworks. The protagonist takes some of Henry's fireworks and sets them off on a nearby rooftop, successfully making a beacon for the boat. Just after they set it up though, hunters attack and the protagonist is forced to fight them off but Henry is nowhere to be found after. The protagonist learns from helping an injured man that Henry was taken by the hunters, who they were hunting for, due to his knowledge of where the camps holding survivors are. Finally, the beacon attracts the boat and it arrives at the dock just in time. In the end, Mei and Linda go aboard the boat but the protagonist decides to stay, hoping to find Henry and his family. Mei and Linda bid him farewell and he records his last tape and says that he will find Julie and Mary and try to rescue Henry, before it is shown that a woman, presumably Julie, or his daughter Mary several years later, has been watching all his videos and currently has all his gear. She cries after the video ends and it is left on a cliffhanger whether or not Henry - or the protagonist - survived. Gameplay Here, the protagonist is confronted by an armed survivor while navigating through the Haventon sewers. The player controls the main character from a third person perspective during navigation, the camera switches to first- person when aiming and shooting. During encounters with hostile survivors, the player can use various tactics to stay alive, including sneaking to surprise enemies with a machete quick kill, performing stealth kills with a bow, or using bluff and intimidation e.g. pointing an empty gun at hostile non-player characters. The game has an emphasis on climbing and exploration. The player will scale wrecked buildings and navigate hazardous areas. Every effort has a cost and, when engaging in physically demanding activities, such as climbing or jumping, it is critical to manage the main character's stamina for him to survive. By managing stamina skillfully players are rewarded by accessing hidden paths, resources and other survivors. Gameplay also involves collecting hidden resources and supplies scattered throughout the city: water, food, batteries, gas, medicine, cigarettes, tools, climbing gear, weapons, and ammunition. Anything that the player can salvage from the destroyed city can be used to keep the main characters strong and healthy, or prove helpful in his quest by allowing him to rescue survivors. Retries can be collected throughout the game by helping or rescuing people, with optional side quests to complete. Development The game began development in 2003. The game was first rumored to be in development in July 2008, when it was known that Assassin's Creed producer Jade Raymond was working on a new game, which was announced at E3 2008, along with a trailer. It was later revealed that Raymond was not working on the game. Development experienced various delays. The original developers, Darkworks, announced that it would not be working on it any longer due to a \\"mutual decision\\" and that the studio had other obligations, and that the game would be finished at Ubisoft Shanghai's studio. On August 2009, various screenshots of an old build of the game were leaked onto the Internet. An announcement from Ubisoft indicated a release window between Q2 April 2010‚Äì Q2 March 2011. These dates passed with no new information, until June 2011 when a notification was published at the Australian classification website which indicated a possible release in the late summer of 2011. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said at the start of 2010 that the studio was \\"totally re-engineering the product\\". In May 2011, Ubisoft cancelled a number of games, but it was revealed that I Am Alive and another Ubisoft title Beyond Good and Evil 2 were not among them, with Ubisoft stating that the cancelled games were unannounced games. On September 29, 2011, a new announcement trailer was released for the game with a release date of \\"this winter\\" at the end. On January 23, 2012, the developers announced on Facebook that the game would be available for Xbox 360 on March 7, 2012. On August 23, 2012, Ubisoft announced the PC version, which had been previously cancelled. Reception The PlayStation 3 version of I Am Alive received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", while the PC and Xbox 360 versions received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. GameSpot said of the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, \\"The few unrealistic elements are a stark contrast to the engrossing world and only lessen the experience.\\" Eurogamer said of the Xbox 360 version, \\"What I Am Alive lacks in originality, though, it makes up for in execution\\", praising the tone and gameplay. Edge gave the same console version seven out of ten, saying that it \\"offers a journey worth charting, one of physics, social decline and welcome terror in a market overrun by zombies.\\" Several reviews praised the survival aspects of said console version, commenting on the scarcity of resources and oppressive atmosphere. Conversely, IGN's review cited the same console version's outdated graphics and poor gameplay elements. The Guardian gave the Xbox 360 version all five stars, saying that it \\"uses its post-apocalyptic environment far more effectively than many other games that share its nightmare vision of the future. I Am Alive joins games such as Fallout, RAGE and Left 4 Dead in its setting where a some horrendous event put paid to civilisation as we know it, but in truth, it's far closer in its atmosphere and aesthetic values to Cormac MacCarthy's grim post-apocalyptic novel, The Road.\\" Digital Spy gave it four stars out of five, saying, \\"If I Am Alive were to be described in a single word, that word would be bleak. It is unapologetic in its presentation and unafraid to cross lines that most games never dare to approach. Those crossed lines are certainly through its subject matter, but also in its gameplay through the possibility of causing permanent damage to your stamina bar. It all comes together to make I Am Alive an uncompromising game of survival, quite unlike anything else on the Xbox 360.\\" Metro gave it seven out of ten, calling it \\"One of the most successfully depressing survival games ever made, and a fascinating portrayal of an ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances.\\" References External links * Category:Cancelled Wii games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Post-apocalyptic video games Category:Survival video games Category:Video games set in 2007 Category:Ubisoft games Category:Unreal Engine games Category:2012 video games Category:Video games developed in China Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Category:Horror video games Category:Windows games Category:Darkworks games Category:Single- player video games Category:Video games using Havok ","title":"I Am Alive"},{"id":"6873726","text":"Pereschepyne ( ) is a town in Novomoskovsk Raion of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast (province), Ukraine.

He died in the same plane crash that killed Croce. Early life Maury was born Maurice T. Muehleisen into a large family in Trenton, New Jersey. He received classical piano training at the age of nine and began playing guitar when he was 17. He briefly attended Glassboro State College in Glassboro, New Jersey. Recording Muehleisen had written several songs and was introduced to producers Terry Cashman and Tommy West, who offered to produce an album of his songs. At that time, Jim Croce was out of the music industry and was working a series of odd jobs. Muehleisen and Croce were introduced by a mutual friend and developed an immediate and lasting rapport. With steady gigs and a growing fan base, Muehleisen invited Croce to back him up as a second guitarist at local Philadelphia-area venues just prior to the release of the Gingerbreadd album by Capitol Records in November 1970. Though commercial results were minimal, Muehleisen's music and songwriting began to have a significant impact‚Äîthe emergence of a new structural sophistication and commercial appeal‚Äîon the musical development of Croce's own songwriting. The result was a sound captured by Cashman and West's sparse production on Croce's three albums‚ÄîYou Don't Mess Around with Jim; Life and Times; and I Got a Name, which was released posthumously. The resulting commercial success of the music launched Croce and Muehleisen on 18 months of frequent touring, both in the United States and abroad; seven national television appearances, including The Tonight Show, American Bandstand, The Dick Cavett Show, and the Helen Reddy Show; as an opening act for Randy Newman, Woody Allen, and Loggins and Messina; and numerous radio interviews. A typical concert venue featured Muehleisen and Croce in a two-guitar acoustic duet, playing to audiences sometimes as large as 10,000 people (Chicago's Ravinia Folk Festival, July 1973). Occasionally, producer Tommy West would join them onstage, typically on the TV appearances, playing the piano. With constant touring becoming a grind, and a No. 1 record on the charts (\\"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown\\"), Muehleisen and Croce returned to New York's The Hit Factory in the summer of 1973 to record Croce's third record as a solo artist. Recording sessions were sandwiched between tour stops, and the final song was finished on September 14, 1973. Croce's last recording was a song written by Muehleisen, titled \\"Salon and Saloon\\", one of the few songs on Croce's solo albums where he was not the primary songwriter--the I Got a Name LP included two other non-Croce-written tunes. Death Continuing to tour, Muehleisen and Croce left New York for the southeastern United States. On Thursday, September 20, 1973, they were in Natchitoches, Louisiana, at Northwestern State University. Their entourage‚Äîthe pilot, Muehleisen, Croce, comedian George Stevens who was the opening act, Croce's road manager Dennis Rast, manager and booking agent Kenneth D. Cortose, all arrived by a small chartered plane. Less than an hour after the concert, the plane crashed at 10:45 pm as it was taking off for the next concert in Sherman, Texas. Everyone on board the plane was killed instantly. The official report of the accident said that the charter pilot had severe coronary artery disease, had run a portion of the three miles to the airport from a motel, and may have suffered a heart attack causing him to crash the twin-engined Beechcraft E18S into a pecan tree at the end of a clear runway with excellent visibility. Early the following week, Muehleisen was buried in Trenton. Guitars Muehleisen had an enthusiastic preference for Martin Guitars and used a Martin D-18 and D-35 in his studio recordings, both on Gingerbreadd and on Jim Croce's three albums. Muehleisen had a natural finger- picking style that accentuated the higher registers of the Martins. Eventually both Muehleisen and Croce became some of the early artists to use Ovation guitars, known for the unique synthetic \\"Lyrachord Bowl\\" design on the back of the guitar, instruments often seen on their later television appearances. Muehleisen also added some electric guitar on I Got a Name. Legacy September 20, 2006, 33 years to the day after his death, saw the first domestic CD reissue of his Gingerbreadd LP, along with a companion CD, Maury Muehleisen ‚Äì Before the Ever Since, featuring early home and studio recordings. Liner notes on Gingerbreadd explain the title. In addition to early renditions of the original Gingerbreadd song lineup, the companion CD includes Muehleisen's original solo guitar recording of \\"Salon and Saloon\\" (the version sung by Croce was accompanied only by Tommy West on piano). In an August 12, 2010, article in Inside [New] Jersey magazine, Muehleisen's sister Mary discussed his music and his association with Croce.

In the 1670s the Westo had a village here, but they were displaced by the Savannah (as the English called a local Shawnee band) in a trade war, and it became known by 1685 as Savannah Town. The English colony had traders who did a lucrative business in dressed skins with the Savannah Shawnee. Fortified as a frontier post, the settlement developed and ferry service was established across the river. The town was gradually overtaken by its competitor of Augusta, Georgia, established in 1735 five miles upriver and closer to Indian settlements. Traders here intercepted commerce, sending it to their port of Savannah on the coast. By 1740 Savannah Town was declining, and by 1765 the village was abandoned and the fort closed. Nearby Silver Bluff was the site in 1773-1775 of the first separate black congregation organized in the current United States; most were slaves. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British occupied Savannah, Georgia, most of the congregation members migrated to the city to gain freedom as promised by the British. Some were evacuated with the British in the last days of the war. History This settlement was first recorded by English colonists as a Westo village; they later recognized that the Savannah (Shawnee) displaced the Westo in a 1679-1680 trade war. Joel Gascoyne's 1685 Plat of the Province of Carolina showed the settlement by the name of Savannah Town (Cumming #101). The growing English colony considered Savannah Town important for its profitable Indian trade, and for frontier defense. A thriving business developed around colonial traders, many of them Scots-Irish, who used pack horses to carry their goods and travel throughout Native American communities in what was then considered the interior, western wilderness away from Low Country settlements. In 1692 the South Carolina Proprietors expressed their hope that traders would reside at \\"Savannah town\\" (McCrady p. 237). In 1698, Colonel Thomas Welch reached the Mississippi River on a Native American trail, which came to be known as the Upper Trading Path to the Chickasaw homeland (Atkinson p. 25). Traders offered the Shawnee and other Indians iron and woolen goods in exchange for the dressed skins (mostly deer) which they shipped by the thousands from Savannah Town via oared 'periagoe' (pirogue in French) to Charles Town, and thence to Europe. The colonial authorities built Fort Moore nearby in 1715 and garrisoned it with perhaps twenty-five soldiers. In 1740 settlers established a ferry service across the Savannah River. The Savannah people resented the encroaching Englishmen and slowly departed the area. In the early 1720s the South Carolina Assembly invited Chickasaw living in northern Mississippi to occupy the area, hoping to encourage trade and use them defensively on the frontier. Seeking to strengthen ties with the English as a source of guns, a Chickasaw group led by Squirrel King (as he was known to the colonists) came to Savannah Town in 1723, settling along nearby Horse Creek. These Chickasaw collaborated with the English colonists in defense of this area from other tribes until returning to their Mississippi homeland about the time of the Revolutionary War. In 1730, South Carolina organized eleven frontier townships to buffer the more developed Low Country settlements. Savannah Town was incorporated into the Parish and Township of New Windsor. In 1737, 200 settlers from Appenzell, Switzerland colonized New Windsor; descendants of the Tobler, Zubly, Nagel, Sturzenegger, and Meyer families are part of local history. Savannah Town gained a competitor in 1735 with the founding of Augusta, five river miles upstream on the Georgia side of the Savannah River. The new Colony of Georgia took good advantage of the settlement's superior position, closer to the bulk of the interior Indian settlements, to attract traders to Augusta. Georgia colonists worked to deflect commercial traffic to their own Atlantic coastal seaport at Savannah. By 1740 the prospect for Savannah Town was a matter of dispute. During the Cherokee war of 1760, Fort Moore harbored militia and refugees, but by 1765, the town as such had disappeared, and the fort was closed.  Geography  Savannah Town, variously called Savano Town, Savanaton or Old Savannah, was located at 33¬∞26'18\\"N, 81¬∞54'32\\"W (NAD83/WGS84), 225 river miles above the port of Savannah. The closest modern town is Beech Island, South Carolina. (Related names of settlements are the city of Savannah, Georgia, founded in 1733 at the mouth of the river by James Oglethorpe, and New Savannah, a Chickasaw town located downstream on the Georgia side of the river.)  Notable people and places  Due to uncertain political jurisdiction over Savannah River islands and sand bars, this area became a popular dueling ground in the early 19th century. The ferry at Savannah Town, later called Sand Bar Ferry, continued to operate until a road bridge was constructed over the river in the 1920s. George Galphin operated a trading post at nearby Silver Bluff; it was prosperous until Galphin's death in 1780. Silver Bluff was developed for plantation agriculture, where many African slaves worked. It was the site of the first African-American congregation to be organized in the South, founded in 1773-1775 under elder David George during the Great Awakening. The black Baptist congregation later moved into Savannah, Georgia during the Revolutionary War, where the slaves could gain freedom behind British lines.Albert J.

He is known primarily for his role as commander-in-chief of the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei during the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration. During his tenure he was also known by his courtesy title, . His poetic name was Biography  Early life  Yoshikuni was born at Aoba Castle in Sendai, the second son of the 11th-generation daimy≈ç Date Nariyoshi. His childhood name was first , and then . In 1837, he was adopted as Date Narikuni‚Äôs official successor, taking the name of Date Toshimura. Early the following year, at age 14, he had his coming-of-age ceremony in Edo Castle, and was received in formal audience by the sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieyoshi, who bestowed upon him the \\"yoshi\\" kanji from his name, thus becoming Date Yoshitoshi, and receiving the courtesy titles of Chikuzen-no-kami and jij≈´ (chamberlain). Late in 1841, on the death of his foster-father (brother-in-law) he became daimy≈ç of Sendai Domain, received the courtesy titles of Mutsu no Kami and Sakon-e gon-shosho. He also changed his name to Date Yoshikuni at this time, taking the \\"kuni\\" character from his predecessor's name.  Career as daimy≈ç  Despite its high kokudaka of 620,000 koku, the domain inherited by Date Yoshikuni was beset with problems. The countryside was ravaged from the effects of enormous Tenpo famine, and for much of his tenure his actual income was much reduced, at times to even the 100,000 koku level. The domain was also given the responsibility of policing the vast northern island of Ezo, including border patrols in Chishima islands, especially Etorofu and Kunashiri where incursions by ships from the Russian Empire were becoming more frequent. Sendai domain administered roughly one-third of the area of present-day Hokkaido. The finances of the domain were further weakened when assigned by the shogunate the task of contributing to security efforts in Kyoto in the 1860s. Sendai Domain was assigned to guard the Shimodachiuri-gomon Gate of the Imperial Palace. With the start of the Boshin War in 1868, Sendai initially remained neutral, and its forces based in Kyoto were not involved in the Battle of Toba‚ÄìFushimi. In the period immediately following the battle, Date Yoshikuni was consulted by Matsudaira Nobunori, lord of Aizu Domain, who wished to use the Date clan's as-yet unmarred reputation in the eyes of the Satch≈ç Alliance in order to achieve leniency for his father, Matsudaira Katamori. However, traditional rivalries between the domains of eastern and western Japan, and the arrogant behavior of emissaries sent by the Satch≈ç Alliance, such as Sara Shuzo forced Yoshikuni's hand, and he eventually became the somewhat reluctant leader of the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei. He was appointed sh≈çgun by Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa, who had declared himself the northern emperor, T≈çbu. However, because of Yoshikuni's indecisiveness and the confederation's incohesiveness and obsolescence of its weapons and tactics, Sendai Domain was defeated by the combined armies of the new Meiji government, led by Kuj≈ç Michitaka. Yoshikuni retired to the domain‚Äôs residence in Tokyo together with his son Date Muneatsu, and voluntarily placed themselves in confinement. The same year, Yoshikuni's fourth son Date Munemoto succeeded as clan leader and was allowed to become daimy≈ç of a much reduced Sendai Domain, with revenues of only 280,000 koku. Yoshikuni remained in retirement until his death in 1874 at age 50. His funeral was held at the Buddhist temple of Saifuku-ji in Komagome, Tokyo, but according to Shinto rituals, so he did not receive a posthumous name. In April 1890, his ashes were removed to the Date clan's cemetery at Dainen-ji in Sendai.

An official report observed that: \\"Little however is known about the regulation by anyone outside the trade. The Public Carriage Office (PCO), which regulates and licenses taxis and private hire (commonly known as minicabs) was transferred from the Metropolitan Police to become part of Transport for London in 2000.\\"\\"Where to, Guv?\\", London Assembly Transport Committee report into the Public Carriage Office, November 2005 In 2015, there were around 298,000 licensed drivers in England, of which 164,000 were private hire licences, 62,000 were taxi licences and 72,000 were dual licences.  Types of cab  * Hackney carriages (taxis) can be flagged down in the street or hired from a taxi rank. * Private hire vehicles ('minicabs') are passenger vehicles which can be either a 4-door saloon/hatchback, carrying up to four passengers or MPVs that are licensed to carry between 5 and 8 passengers. These may not be hailed in the street. ** Chauffeur cars are a sub-set of private hire; generally a higher-value car such as a Mercedes or Jaguar where the passenger pays a premium but in return receives a higher level of comfort and courtesy from the driver, some of whom wear a uniform.  Hackney carriages  Only licensed hackney carriages can pick up passengers on the street and without pre-booking. London's traditional black cabs (so-called, despite being of various colours and advertising designs) are specially constructed vehicles designed to conform to the standards set out in the Conditions of Fitness. London taxi drivers are licensed and must have passed an extensive training course (the Knowledge). Unlike many other cities, the number of taxicab drivers in London is not limited. For many years purpose- designed vehicles were used, but from about 2008 specially adapted \\"people carrier\\" vehicles have also been used. There have been many models over the years. The space beside the driver's seat can be used for luggage, although there is much luggage room in the passenger compartment. For improved manoeuvrability, the turning circle is smaller than other vehicles of similar size (a black cab is said to be able to \\"turn on a sixpence\\"). The cab seats three people on the back seat, and two more in backwards-facing \\"jump seats\\". There is good headroom, to facilitate entry to and exit from the vehicle. A ramp for access by disabled people is fitted.  Private hire (minicabs)  A Ford Mondeo UK private minicab with company name and telephone number on each side In London the term minicab is used to refer to a private hire car and \\"private hire\\" is used in the rest of the United Kingdom; that is a car with a driver available for hire only on a pre-booked basis. They began operating in the 1960s in competition with hackney carriages after a loophole in the law was spotted (although in some areas it is possible to hold a dual hackney/private hire licence). A minicab must be booked, for example, by telephone, internet, or fax, or in person at the registered minicab office. A minicab can be booked at the time it is required, but only at the office of a company registered to accept bookings rather than directly with a driver. Since 2001 minicabs have been subject to some regulation in London and most other local authorities. London minicabs are now licensed by TFL (London Taxis and Private Hire), or LTPH, formerly known as the Public Carriage Office. This is the same body that now regulates London's licensed taxicabs, but minicab drivers do not have to complete The Knowledge, and although they must undergo a small \\"topographical test\\" in order to obtain a Private Hire Drivers Licence, they generally rely on satnavs or local knowledge to take them to the pick up and destination. All vehicles available for pre-booking by London minicab drivers must hold a PH licence showing that the vehicles are fit for purpose; this is updated with MOT tests twice a year after an inspection at a licensed garage. In London new applicants must send their Topographical Test Certificate along with their application to the PH Driver Licensing Section of the LTPH. Uber operates under minicab regulations in London.  London  A LTI TX4 black cab at Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 Greater London, a metropolitan area with a population of about 8 million, has no grid plan laying out streets in vertical and horizontal patterns; thus the streets of London follow complex patterns.\\"The Knowledge, London‚Äôs Legendary Taxi-Driver Test, Puts Up a Fight in the Age of GPS\\" Blog post by Jody Rosen The New York Times Magazine November 2014  History  Horse-drawn hackney carriages began providing taxicab service in the early 17th century. In 1636 the number of carriages was set at 50, an early example of taxicab regulation. In the same year, the owner of four hackney carriages established the first taxicab stand in The Strand. After 1662 hackneys were regulated by the Commissioners of Scotland Yard. In the early 19th century cabriolets (cabs for short) replaced the heavier and more cumbersome hackney carriages. Battery-operated taxis appeared briefly at the end of the 19th century, but the modern taxicab service took off with the appearance of petrol-powered taxis in 1903. In 1907 meters were first introduced to calculate the fare and were set at 8d (8 pence) for the first mile. Today, taxicab service in London is provided by the famous black cabs (typically the distinctive TX4 depicted in the photo to the right, The Metrocab and the Mercedes Vito).  The Knowledge  The London taxicab driver is required to be able to decide routes immediately in response to a passenger's request or traffic conditions, rather than stopping to look at a map, relying on satellite navigation or asking a controller by radio. Consequently, the \\"Knowledge of London\\" is the in-depth study of a number of pre-set London street routes and all places of interest that taxicab drivers in that city must complete to obtain a licence to operate a black cab. It was initiated in 1865, and has changed little since. It is the world's most demanding training course for taxicab drivers, and applicants will usually need to pass at least twelve \\"appearances\\" (periodical one-on-one oral examinations undertaken throughout the qualification process), with the whole process usually averaging 34 months, to pass. = Course details = 320 standard routes through central London, or \\"runs\\", are defined in the Guide to Learning the Knowledge of London, which is produced by the Public Carriage Office. In all, some 25,000 streets within a six-mile radius of Charing Cross are covered, along with the major arterial routes through the rest of London. A taxicab-driver must learn these routes, as well as the \\"points of interest\\" along and within of each end of those routes including streets, squares, clubs, hospitals, hotels, theatres, embassies, government and public buildings, railway stations, police stations, courts, diplomatic buildings, important places of worship, cemeteries, crematoria, parks and open spaces, sports and leisure centres, places of learning, restaurants and historic buildings. The Knowledge includes details such as the order of theatres on Shaftesbury Avenue, and the names and order of the side streets and traffic signals passed on a route. There are a number of Knowledge Schools that provide books, maps and classroom tuition which help Knowledge students to learn the 320 runs and points of interest.\\"London Taxi Knowledge Schools\\", There are separate, shorter courses for suburban London, with 30 to 50 runs, depending on the sector.\\"Applicants for a Taxi Driver‚Äôs Licence ‚Äì The 'Knowledge of London' Examination System\\", Public Carriage Office, Transport for London = \\"Knowledge boys/girls\\" = Honda Super-Cub. During training, would-be cabbies, known as Knowledge boys or Knowledge girls, usually follow these routes around London on a motor scooter, and can be identified by the clipboard fixed to the handlebars and showing details of the streets to be learned that day. Taxi-driver applicants must be 'of good character', meeting strict requirements regarding any criminal record, then first pass a written test which qualifies them to make an \\"appearance\\". At appearances, Knowledge boys and girls must, without looking at a map, identify the two points of interest in metropolitan London that their examiner chooses and then choose the shortest and most sensible route from one to the other. For each route, the applicants must recite the names of the roads used, when they cross junctions, use roundabouts, make turns, and what is 'alongside' them at each point.\\"The Knowledge Boys\\", Scientific American Frontiers =Academic research= Knowledge boys/girls and their online learning communities have been the subject of academic research, including a PhD dissertation by Drew Ross at Oxford University. There is evidence that training for the Knowledge can measurably alter the hippocampus of trainee cab drivers. The hippocampus is the area of the brain used for spatial memory and navigation, and is generally larger in taxi drivers than in the general population. =Film and literature= A humorous 1979 television film about this learning experience, called The Knowledge, was written by Jack Rosenthal for Euston Films, and was in 2000 voted number 83 in a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes compiled by the British Film Institute. In the Up Series documentary films, Tony Walker is seen on his motor scooter learning \\"The Knowledge\\" before becoming a cab driver. Later, his wife Debbie joins him after qualifying herself. In the Chas‚ÄîThe Knowledge miniseries, which was a spin-off from the comic book Hellblazer, Chas Chandler's job as a taxi driver is the basis for various plot elements of the series. The Knowledge, its runs, and to a certain extent the role of the PCO, form the basis for a future religion in Will Self's The Book of Dave.  TfL Taxi and Private Hire office  Taxis and private hire driver licences in London from 2010 to 2020 The Taxi and Private Hire office is the body responsible for licensing taxicabs within Greater London. Taxi and Private Hire is part of Transport for London and is responsible for licensing the familiar London taxicab or \\"black cab\\" and also licenses private hire or minicab services. \\"Black cabs\\" were traditionally coloured black, but this is not a requirement and cabs are painted in other colours, sometimes bearing advertising; however they are traditionally called black cabs to distinguish them from minicabs. = History = PCO licence plate, as seen on the back of all licensed hackney carriages (September 2006) Since 1600 public carriages for hire have been a feature of London life. The discarded coaches of aristocratic families, complete with their coat of arms, were among the first hackney carriages to ply for hire. They were the forerunners of the French hackney carriage or cab (cabriolet) which first appeared in London around 1820. The first horseless cab, the Bersey electric-powered vehicle, appeared in 1897, followed by the first internal combustion engine cab in 1903. At that time London still had more than 11,000 horse-drawn cabs. The last horse-drawn cab was removed from service in 1947. As of July 2019, there are over 21,000 licensed vehicles on London's roads. Regulation of the trade passed to the Metropolitan Police in 1850 and was undertaken by the Public Carriage Office, which was originally in an annex to New Scotland Yard in Whitehall called \\"the Bungalow\\". It moved to 109 Lambeth Road in 1919, remaining there until 1966, when it moved to 15 Penton Street, Islington. In 2010 it moved again to the Palestra Building at 197 Blackfriars Road, Southwark. = Present role = On the formation of Transport for London on 3 July 2000, the licensing authority changed; however, the day-to-day licensing function remained with the Public Carriage Office. With the introduction of the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998 the role of the PCO has been expanded to include the licensing of private hire operators, drivers and vehicles, bringing the capital into line with the rest of England and Wales. In November 2005, in the report Where to, Guv?, the London Assembly's Transport Committee reported on a review of the Public Carriage Office and made some key recommendations.  Elsewhere  Hackney carriages in Leeds are white with black bumpers and bonnets Outside London, taxis are licensed by the local authority, and in many places are required to be painted a certain colour. Most major cities predominantly use London taxis, again traditionally black but this is not always mandatory. Smaller towns and rural areas allow more varieties of passenger cars, which may require taxis to be painted in a particular livery as a licence condition. A distinctive livery helps improve identification, which in turn improves passenger safety and accessibility, as well as provide a more professional service and create and promote a local identity with taxis a common sight around town. Many towns use two-colour schemes, such as white vehicles with another specific colour on the bonnet and tailgate. The seaside city of Brighton uses white with an aquamarine colour, Windsor, home to the Queen's residence at Windsor Castle, uses white with royal purple on the bonnet and tailgate, and in the East Riding of Yorkshire white with green and Yorkshire rose markings. Basildon taxis display white with orange bonnet and tailgate, Leeds white with a black, Cardiff black with white, and West Suffolk and Middlesbrough black with yellow. Bradford are all white with a green diagonal stripe on the front side doors. St Albans are all white with a yellow stripe running the full length of the side, and in Bournemouth they are pale yellow with a white stripe. Single colour schemes include blue in Bristol, teal in Guildford, and silver in Portsmouth, whilst white is used widely including in Southampton, Sunderland and Scarborough. In Hartlepool and Derby taxis are yellow, but both local authorities considered changing the livery in 2019 to reduce costs whilst still allowing taxis to be easily identified. Hartlepool proposed a two-colour scheme with a standard manufacturer colour such as white, silver or black as a base, and retain yellow only on the bonnet and boot, but abandoned plans after a consultation. Derby plans to change to black with a yellow diagonal stripe on each side. Elsewhere there are two types of \\"taxi\\"‚Äîhackney carriages (licensed under the Town Police Clauses Act 1847), which may pick up fares on the street or be pre-booked and have a meter that charges a rate set by the local authority (alternatively the driver may negotiate a lower fare with the customer), and private hire vehicles (licensed under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976) which must be pre-booked and whose rates are set by the private hire operator. Hackney carriages may only pick up fares off the street in the area in which they are licensed‚Äîhowever they and private hire vehicles may pick up anywhere in the UK as long as they are pre-booked, and the driver, vehicle and operator are all licensed in the same borough. Some authorities have entered into agreements with neighbouring authorities to deputise each other's enforcement officers so they have the power to apprehend \\"trespassing\\" taxis from outside their area. The legal way for a driver to ply outside their area is to obtain multiple licences, one for each licence authority area.

The volcano is characterized by a large caldera that is flooded by the Sea of Okhotsk. A large eruption occurred early during the Holocene which reached a volcanic explosivity index of 7. Iturup island contains about nine stratovolcanoes, some pyroclastic cones, one somma volcano and several geothermal fields. Among these, Lvinaya Past is formed by a wide and deep caldera, which is connected with the Sea of Okhotsk by a wide and maximally deep strait. The volcano is high, almost above the bottom of the caldera. A major eruption occurred 7480 ¬± 80 BC. The submarine caldera formed during this eruption and heavily altered the topography on Iturup, generating an ignimbrite which joined the three southernmost volcanoes of Iturup to the main island. The total volume of tephra ejected amounts to . This eruption had a volcanic explosivity index of 7, making it one of the largest eruptions that are known to have occurred in the Kuril Islands, and the strongest known to have occurred during the Holocene in the Southern Kurils. Habitats may have been destroyed to distances of from the volcano. The development of alder- containing birch forests in the region may have been favoured by the ash fall from the eruption, which would have killed more susceptible conifers. Ice cores taken in the Siberian Altai demonstrate increased sulfate concentrations at the time, possibly stemming from large sulfate release by the eruptions of Lvinaya Past and contemporaneous large scale activity at Caldera Fisher in Alaska and Pinatubo in the Philippines. Lvinaya Past has erupted tholeiitic magmas with a low potassium content. Other rocks include andesite, basaltic andesite, basalt, dacite and picrite. The caldera-forming eruption ejected dacitic material with hornblende and quartz forming phenocrysts. Other volcanoes on Iturup include Astonupuri, Baransky, Berutarube, Bogatyr Ridge, Chirip, Demon, Golets-Tornyi, Grozny Group, Medvezhy and Past.

The site was discovered in 1987. Some archaeologists consider this find to be one of the most important archaeological discoveries in South America in the last 30 years, as the main tomb was found intact and untouched by thieves. By 2007, fourteen tombs had been located and identified at Huaca Rajada. The Royal Tombs of Sip√°n Museum was constructed in nearby Lambayeque to hold most of the artifacts and interpret the tombs. It opened in 2002 and Dr. Alva is director. Location The Moche tombs at Huaca Rajada are located near the town of Sip√°n in the middle of the Lambayeque Valley. Sip√°n is in the Za√±a district in the northern part of Peru. Close to the coast, it is about 20 miles east of the city of Chiclayo and about 30 miles away from Lambayeque. Huaca Rajada Site of Huaca Rajada Huacas like Huaca Rajada were built by the Moche and other South American cultures as monuments. The Huaca Rajada monument consists of two small adobe pyramids plus a low platform. The platform and one of the pyramids were built before 300 CE by the Moche; the second pyramid at Huaca Rajada was built about 700 CE by a later culture. Many huacas were looted by the Spanish during and after the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire; the looting of huacas continues to be a problem in many locations. In early 1987, looters digging at Huaca Rajada found several objects made of gold. A disagreement among the looters caused the find to be reported to the local police. The police raided the site, recovering a number of items, and alerted Dr. Alva. Lord of Sip√°n El Se√±or de Sip√°n, original artifacts in the Royal Tombs of Sip√°n museum, Lambayeque, Peru Scientific analysis of the skeleton of the Lord of Sip√°n show that he was approximately 1.63 meters tall and was about 35‚Äì45 years old at the time of his death. His jewelry and ornaments, which included headdresses, a face mask, a pectoral, (the pectoral was gold and had the head of a man and the body of an octopus) necklaces, nose rings, ear rings and other items, indicate he was of the highest rank. Most of the ornaments were made of gold, silver, copper and semi-precious stones. The Lord of Sip√°n was wearing two necklaces with beads of gold and silver in the shape of man√≠ (peanuts), which represent the tierra (earth). The peanuts symbolized that men came from the land, and that when they die, they return to the earth. Peanuts were used because they were an important food crop for the Moche. The necklaces had ten kernels on the right side made of gold, signifying masculinity and the sun god, and ten kernels on the left side made of silver, to represent femininity and the moon god. Buried with the Lord of Sip√°n were six other people: three young women (possibly wives or concubines who had apparently died some time earlier), two males (probably warriors), and a child of about nine or ten years of age. The remains of a third male (possibly also a warrior) was found on the roof of the burial chamber sitting in a niche overlooking the chamber. There was also a dog which was probably the Lord of Sipan's favorite pet. The warriors who were buried with the Lord of Sip√°n had amputated feet, as if to prevent them from leaving the tomb. The women were dressed in ceremonial clothes. In addition to the people, archeologists found in the tomb a total of 451 ceremonial items and offerings (burial goods), and the remains of several animals, including a dog and two llamas. Other Sip√°n mummies Tomb of the Warriors, Huaca Rajada In 1988, a second tomb was found and excavated near that of the Lord of Sip√°n. Artifacts in this second tomb are believed to be related to religion: a cup or bowl for the sacrifices, a metal crown adorned with an owl with its wings extended, and other items associated with worship of the moon. Alva concluded that the individual buried in this tomb was a Moche priest. Carbon dating established that the skeleton in this second tomb was contemporary with the Lord of Sipan. The third tomb found at Huaca Rajada was slightly older than the first two, but ornaments and other items found in the tomb indicated that the person buried in the tomb was of the same high rank as the first Lord of Sip√°n burial. DNA analysis of the remains in this third tomb established that the individual buried in the third tomb was related to the Lord of Sip√°n via the maternal line. As a result, the archeologists named this third individual The Old Lord of Sip√°n. The third tomb also contained the remains of two other people: a young woman, a likely sacrifice to accompany the Old Lord of Sip√°n to the next life; and a man with amputated feet, possibly sacrificed to be the Old Lord's guardian in the afterlife. A total of fourteen tombs have been found at Sip√°n.  DNA testing  Archeological research and DNA testing enabled deducing certain physical characteristics of the ruler, such as skin color, the form of his lips, hair, eyes and other facial features. It was also possible to provide an accurate estimate of his age at death, allowing for a more accurate facial reconstruction by researchers.  Museum  The Royal Tombs Museum of Sip√°n Steps of digital forensic facial reconstruction of Lord of Sip√°n. The Royal Tombs of Sip√°n Museum, located in nearby Lambayeque, contains most of the important artifacts found at Huaca Rajada, including the Lord of Sip√°n and his entourage. Dr. Alva helped found and support construction of the museum, which opened in 2002. The museum was designed to resemble the ancient Moche tombs. He has been appointed as director of the museum. In 2009 a smaller museum was opened at the site of Huaca Rajada.

Cork won the championship, beating Offaly 3‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì12 in the centenary year final at Semple Stadium, Thurles. Centenary year 1984 was a special year in the annals of Gaelic games as it was the centenary of the foundation of the Gaelic Athletic Association. Because of this a series of events celebrating the occasion were planned to take place throughout the year. The festivities were officially launched on 18 March at the Michael Cusack cottage in Carron, County Clare. Ash trees were planted to mark the occasion and a plaque was also unveiled in memory of the founder of the association. The Railway Cup finals were later played in Cusack Park, Ennis. A ¬£100,000 film was also commissioned by the centenary committee. Made by Louis Marcus the film was designed to be a portrait rather than a chronological history of the GAA. One of the biggest events during the centenary celebrations was the staging of the All-Ireland final in Semple Stadium, Thurles. It was the first time since 1937 that the championship decider did not take place in Croke Park. The staging of the game in Thurles was a gesture to the cradle-town of the GAA and to the county regarded as 'the home of hurling'. Pre-championship Prior to the opening of the championship Kilkenny were installed as the favourites to retain the All-Ireland title for a third consecutive year. The last time they achieved this was in 1913, however, no final took place that year and Kilkenny were awarded the title as Limerick refused to play. Since then they failed to capture the 'three-in-a- row', in spite of having the opportunity in 1933 and again in 1976. Cork, the defeated All-Ireland finalists in 1982 and 1983, were regarded as the biggest threat to Kilkenny's ambitions. 1984 also provided Cork with the dubious honour of becoming the first team to lose three All-Ireland finals in-a-row. National League champions Limerick and newcomers Offaly were also regarded as teams that would make life difficult for the reigning champions. Teams A total of thirteen teams contested the championship, a reduction of one team from the 1983 championship and one new entrant. The Leinster championship was reduced to five teams as Westmeath declined to take part and instead decided to field a team in the All-Ireland Senior B Hurling Championship. 'The Lakelanders' went on to win that championship and qualified for the All- Ireland quarter-final. Once again the five traditional hurling teams contested the Munster championship. Antrim and Galway, two teams who faced no competition in their respective provinces, entered the championship at the All-Ireland semi-final stage.

She was the sister ship of Britannic. Serving with the White Star Line until 1904, she later operated under the names Ottawa, Gul Djemal and G√ºlcemal, until broken up in 1950 after a total career of 75 years. History Germanic The sister ship of Britannic, delivered in June 1874, Germanic was launched on 15 July 1874. Although fitting out was completed in early 1875, delivery was delayed until May of that year so that she would arrive in time for the summer transatlantic season. Germanic was primarily powered by steam, although she also carried four masts, three of which were square-rigged. She departed on her maiden voyage on 20 May 1875 from Liverpool to New York, arriving ten days later.http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030313/1875-05-31/ed-1/seq-10.pdf In doing so, she replaced , the White Star's first post-Ismay steamship that was sold by the company in the same year. Britannic and Germanic cabin plan In July during an eastbound run, Germanic set a transatlantic speed record of 15.76 knots (average), crossing the ocean in seven days, 11 hours, and 17 minutes, and winning the coveted Blue Riband. In February, 1876, she beat her own record. On a subsequent trip, when the ship was south of Ireland, the propeller shaft sheared and she had to limp into Waterford on sail power alone. In 1895, Germanic underwent a major refit, during which a larger triple-expansion steam engine was installed, and the rigging was removed. On 13 February 1899, while being coaled at White Star's New York City pier, a blizzard blanketed her decks with a heavy layer of snow. Now top heavy, she listed to port so much that water began to enter doors opened for coaling, and Germanic settled on to the shallow harbour bottom.News from 1899: Germanic Sinks in Her Dock at New York She was raised, and determined to be worth saving, so she returned to Belfast for repairs that lasted four months. Ottawa On 3 September 1903, Germanic left on her final run as a White Star liner. She was then laid up for the winter, and in 1904 was sold to the American Line, one of White Star's sister companies under the International Mercantile Marine Co. umbrella. Still named Germanic, she served on the Southampton to New York route, but for only six voyages. She was transferred yet again to another IMM company, the Dominion Line, a niche company that served the immigrant trade. On 5 January 1905, Germanic was renamed Ottawa. For the next four years, Ottawa plied the Canadian waters, sailing only in the summer, between Quebec City and Montreal. After the 1909 summer season, Ottawa was laid up for winter. Gul Djemal In 1910, the Government of the Ottoman Empire bought the ship from IMM, to become part of a five-ship transport fleet, leaving Liverpool for the last time on 15 May 1911, under the name Gul Djemal, in honour of the Sultan's mother. She was operated by the Administration de Navigation √† Vapeur Ottomane of Constantinople. In a few months, she was carrying Turkish soldiers to war duty in Yemen. When World War I began and the Ottoman Empire joined forces with Germany, she again became a troop ship, ferrying soldiers to the Gallipoli Peninsula. On 3 May 1915, Gul Djemal was on this run, carrying over 4,000 soldiers, when she was torpedoed by the British submarine , sinking in shallow waters up to the superstructure. The British claimed that most of those on board lost their lives, though Turkish and German sources mention a very limited number of casualties.Discussion on Uboat.net Since Gul Djemal had not completely sunk, it was decided that she could be raised and repaired, and afterwards she continued to serve the war effort. In 1918, she carried 1,500 German troops to Dover, to the Allied control point there, where the soldiers were disarmed and sent home. In 1919 the ship embarked returning German troops of General Kress's Caucasus expedition, and the remaining German residents of Constantinople, from there to Bremen, arriving 29 June. With the war finally over, Gul Djemal went to work for the Ottoman American Line, again carrying emigrants to new lives in America, making her first trip in this role on 10 October 1921. She was later in service in the Black Sea. After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Gul Djemal became a Turkish ship. She was one of the ships responsible in transporting Turks from Crete, Greece to Turkey during the population exchange between Greece and Turkey after the Turkish War of Independence. After this mission she returned to regular services in the Black Sea.Sea news G√ºlcemal G√ºlcemal, in Karak√∂y, Istanbul. (Estimated photo date between 1928-1937) In 1928, the ship was transferred to Turkiye Seyrisefain Idaresi and renamed G√ºlcemal. In January 1931, she grounded in the Sea of Marmora, but was refloated and returned to service, surviving World War II, although playing no notable part in it. By 1949, she was a storage ship, and in 1950 converted to a floating hotel. Finally, on 29 October of that year, G√ºlcemal was moved to Messina for scrapping, having lasted 75 years, three major mishaps and two World Wars. When being demolished, her original White Star Line gold stripe could still be seen along her hull. Only Cunard's SS Parthia (1870) served a longer time afloat than Germanic, ending her days as a lumber tug in 1956.

It merges with the Macal River at Branch Mouth, Belize, forming the Belize River, which ultimately discharges to the Caribbean Sea. The drainage area of the combined watershed is . Tributaries of the Mopan include Chiquibul Branch, Ceiba Grande, Salisipuedes, and Delores. Hydrology The Mopan River's rate of discharge has been measured regularly since 1981 at the river gauge station in Benque Viejo, Belize. According to these measurements, the river's annual mean discharge varies between 20 and 40 m3/s. The highest rate ever recorded was 404 m3/s in November 1990. Although the Mopan may contribute to downstream flooding during the rainy season, it responds much slower to rain storms than the other major tributary of the Belize River, the Macal. Both rivers yield similar volumes on average, but the Mopan watershed is less mountainous than the Macal watershed, giving it less intense flood waves. Pollution The combined Mopan River/Belize River watershed contains 11% of the population of the Peten District in Guatemala and 45% of the population of Belize.Jes Karper and Ed Boles, Human Impact Mapping of the Mopan and Chiquibul Rivers within Guatemala and Belize (2003) These populations depend on the river for drinking water and other domestic uses; however, water quality is degraded from sediment, nutrient loading, untreated sewage discharge, pesticides and other toxins. The major source of degradation is the extensive deforestation in the upper reaches and non-sustainable agriculture. Karper and Boles have asserted: \\"The greater Mopan/Belize River Catchment provides a prime example of a watershed under stress from extensive non-sustainable agricultural practices that have occurred within the region over the past three decades.\\" Slash-and-burn agricultural practices by native peoples are contributing to such watershed degradation. Maya sites A hand-cranked ferry takes visitors across the river to the Maya site of Xunantunich. Several important Maya archaeological sites are situated along the Mopan River. From upriver to downriver, these include Ucanal, Arenal, Xunantunich, Actuncan, and Buenavista del Cayo. Several of these sites and associated settlement areas have been studied as part of the Mopan Valley Archaeology Project.

He is best known as a big band composer for Stan Kenton and the Don Ellis Orchestra, as well as the founder and long-time director of Towson University‚Äôs Jazz Program. Life and career Levy was born in Baltimore. Levy was a saxophone player and briefly played baritone saxophone for Stan Kenton, but he was most known for his composing and arranging, specifically in odd time signatures. His interest in odd meters pre-dated Dave Brubeck's Time Out album. He studied composition with George Thaddeus Jones at Catholic University in Washington, DC, and became interested in odd meters through their use by such composers as Paul Hindemith, Maurice Ravel, and Igor Stravinsky. He was also a particularly good composer of counterpoint, which can be heard in such compositions as Passacaglia and Fugue (recorded by Don Ellis on \\"Live At Monterey\\") and Quintessence (performed, but not recorded by, Stan Kenton). Levy was also prolific as an arranger of jazz standards, though few of these arrangements were published during his lifetime. He was especially fond of the music of the stage as it came through bebop: Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern. In his last years, he more frequently turned to bebop originals, tunes by Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Tadd Dameron. Though the odd meters he was associated with rarely appeared in these arrangements, and were typically conventional in respect to style, they often displayed a distinctive creativity. Levy began his full-time college teaching career at Towson State University in late 1967 creating \\"The Towson State Jazz Ensemble\\". By 1970, his hard work and passion for teaching brought the band to national prominence when his Towson State Jazz Ensemble competed and won the outstanding band honors at the Notre Dame Collegiate Jazz Festival. Additional honors went to Levy's lead trumpet player, Tony Neenan who was voted \\"Best Lead Trumpet\\" of the festival. He was Professor Emeritus of Towson University. He was posthumously honored by Towson University in a ceremony on April 13, 2017. Levy died of congestive heart failure in Parkville, Maryland.

The recording comprised Levy compositions, all but one in odd meter: \\"Bop City Revisited\\", \\"Poopsie's Penthouse\\", \\"A Quiet Friday\\", \\"Pete Is a Four-Letter Word\\", \\"Bread and Watrous\\", and \\"Stillness Runs Deep\\". Personnel on the recording who also have performed with the Hank Levy Alumni Band include Steve Ashcraft (drums) and Ray Disney (trumpet). Today, Levy's music is performed by the Hank Levy Legacy Band based in Towson, Maryland. The band was founded in 1992 following his retirement from full-time teaching. The band has recorded two live CD's: Hank At Home (2000) and An \\"Odd-Time\\" Was Had By All (2004), both distributed by Sonority Records. The 2014 jazz film Whiplash takes its title from Levy's composition which originally appeared on the 1973 album Soaring by Don Ellis and portions of which are played throughout the course of the film. A handful of Levy's works are still in print through various distributors. His most well-known works, those recorded by Stan Kenton and originally published through Creative World, are now distributed by Sierra Music Publications, headed by Robert Curnow, another Kenton composer.

One of the Central Fells, it is a broad plateau with a succession of rocky tops. Many routes of ascent are possible, beginning either from Grasmere or Great Langdale, though the paths are often poorly marked and hard to follow. Topography The main spine of the Central Fells runs north to south from the Vale of Keswick to its greatest elevation at High Raise. A long ridge runs out eastward from here, so that the range as a whole resembles the letter 'L'. This eastward ridge begins as Blea Rigg and then continues over Silver How and Loughrigg Fell, before petering out near the head of Windermere. Blea Rigg is a broad plateau, around a mile wide and two miles long, climbing roughly east to west. It connects via a narrower section between Stickle and Codale Tarns to Sergeant Man and ultimately High Raise in the west. Stickle Tarn is the larger of the two waterbodies, a 50 ft deep corrie tarn with the level increased by a stone faced dam. It is used to supply water to the residents of Great Langdale. Codale Tarn is a shallow pool set amid rough ground, a little to the north east.Blair, Don: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (2003): Blea Rigg has a number of named tops in addition to the summit. Travelling west to east these are Great Castle How (1,640 ft), Little Castle How (1,581 ft), Swinescar Pike (1,348 ft) and Lang How (1,358 ft) Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): Silver How could also be considered part of Blea Rigg, were it not for Wainwright's decision to accord it a separate chapter in his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells. Drainage from the southern side of the fell is via a number of feeders to Stickle Gill and Great Langdale Beck. Among the tributaries is White Gill, its ravine being an interesting route of ascent. Water from the northern flanks reaches Grasmere via Easedale Beck and its feeders. Crags look down over Easedale Tarn and Blindtarn Moss to the north, while further rough ground looms over the Great Langdale road. Geology The summit of the fell is formed of the Pavey Ark Member, pebbly sandstone and breccia from the Borrowdale Volcanic series.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) There is no history of mining within the area of the fell. Summit The fell has many rocky tops and a number of sizeable tarns. Added to the network of paths this can make the ridge a confusing place for walkers. It is not always immediately obvious which outcrop forms the actual summit, but a small cairn sits on rock above a stone shelter. The view takes in the eastern and southern fells, plus the nearby Langdale Pikes.Mark Richards: The Central Fells: Collins (2003): Ascents Many routes of ascent are possible from either side of the ridge, with a climb from Grasmere over Silver How also popular. From the New Dungeon Ghyll Hotel in Great Langdale the walker can climb either via Stickle Tarn or up the ravine of White Gill. From Grasmere, Easedale Tarn is the preliminary objective. From here Blea Crag can be outflanked on either side to arrive on the summit ridge to the east or west of the summit. Before World War II a stone refreshment hut stood on the slopes of Blea Rigg, just above Easedale Tarn. It is hard to imagine the scene today, with food and drink for sale halfway up a fell.

Although Asia also includes countries of the Middle East, some CIS countries and the vast majority of the land mass of Russia and Turkey, in financial markets it is often only East Asia and South Asia that are included in the term. Issuance Issuance in Asia is predominantly issued by sovereign issuers but corporate bonds are becoming an important source of growth in Asian fixed- income markets. Currently issuance is predominantly in US dollars, although local currency issuance is also growing. Asian governments, central banks and the Asian Development Bank are keen to see the expansion of Asian bond markets over the next few years in order to help provide finance for the large infrastructural development that the region needs over the next decade. Alongside the expansion of the bond markets, Asian governments and central banks are currently discussing the creation of an Asian Currency Unit. The ADB has suggested that bonds may also be issued in ACU over the next few years. This would help lower the financing costs for Asian issuers who have substantial trade links with other countries in the region. Asian issuers tends to have a much higher credit rating than other sovereign debt, particularly those in Latin America because of the strong economic underpinnings and low political risks. Most Asian countries have ratings which are investment grade. History Asian economies suffered badly from the East Asian financial crisis in 1997 and subsequently academic research has identified the over-reliance on short term bank financing as a major cause of economic failure. Governments and central banks are keen to encourage the expansion of the Asian bond markets in order to reduce the reliance on short term bank loans and so avoid the economic catastrophe that occurred in 1997/1998. Investing in Asian Bonds Large investors can buy bonds directly, whereas smaller investor tend to invest via mutual funds. The two major Asian bond indices are the HSBC Asian Bond Index and the JP Morgan JACI Index. As part of the Asian Bond Market Initiative, nine Pan Asian Bond funds have been launched. These passively managed funds are designed to provide an efficient mechanism for investors to buy local currency funds. Whilst their low fees provide funds at an attractive price, the fee scales discourage active management and provides limited incentive for managers to promote these funds. As a result, these funds are not widely known. The managers of the 8 single market funds are; ABF China Bond Index Fund, China Asset Management Corporate Limited ABF Hong Kong Bond Index Fund, HSBC Investments (Hong Kong) Limited ABF Indonesia Bond Index Fund, PT Bahana TCW Investment Management ABF Korea Bond Index Fund, Samsung Investment Trust Management Company Limited ABF Malaysia Bond Index Fund, AmInvestment Management Sdn. Bhd.

It would also contribute to the mitigation of currency and maturity mismatches in financing. The activities of the Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI) is focused on (1) Facilitating access to the market through a wider variety of issuers and (2) Enhancing market infrastructure to foster bond markets in Asia.

The club competes in the National Premier Leagues Western Australia. The club's founders were of Greek heritage. Floreat Athena has been crowned the Western Australian State Champions four times, League Premiers seven times, State Cup Winners six times, and Night Series Champions six times. In 1997, the club won all three trophies to claim its first ever treble. History Early years The club was formed in 1951 as the Athena Club by Greek-Australians as place for the local Greek community to unite around football. The club entered the third division of WA's state league football in 1953. =1960s= In 1960 the club withdrew from the Western Australian Soccer Football Association (WASFA) to form WA's first official semi- professional league under the Western Australia Soccer Federation. It was also in 1960 that Athena played their first season in the state league's top tier, ending the season sixth and maintained its status in the top flight. The 1960s were turbulent times for Athena on the pitch. The club finished third in 1961 and 1963, but declined to just avoid relegation in subsequent years before being relegated in 1966 after finishing 9th in the State Premier League. Athena finished second in the 1967 Second Division season, gaining promotion to the State League for the 1968 season. In 1968 they were relegated for the second time in three years after they finished last. =1970s= Athena remained in the First Division for five successive seasons (1969‚Äì1973). In 1973 Athena clinched the Second Division title and entered the top flight in 1974, finishing sixth. In the 1975 and 1976 seasons, Athena finished third. The club has finished no higher than third on four separate occasions since 1960. In 1977, internal disputes at the committee level resulted in the sacking of coach Bill Dumbbell despite Athena claiming its first state league title. Athena maintained its status in the top flight until 1980 when the club was relegated for finishing tenth under coach Ulysses Kokkinos. Golden era After being relegated in 1980, the club secured its second First Division title in 1981 and returned to the top flight of Western Australia football (soccer). Since 1982, Floreat Athena has not been relegated, remaining in the State Premier League for three decades. =Mid 1980s ‚Äì early 1990s ‚Äì The Golden Years= From 1984 until 1991 Floreat Athena entered into a \\"golden era\\" of Western Australian Premier League football. After winning the Top Four Cup in 1984 Athena proceeded to win the Night Series trophy in 1985. Then from 1986, Athena were placed no lower than third for six straight seasons. Having finished third in 1986 and 1987, Athena claimed only its second State Premier League title in 1988 under coach Ken Worden. Besides its great league achievements Athena also won the then State D'orsogna Cup three years in a row during these halcyon years. Following the 1988 triumph, the Soccer Federation strangely decided that from the 1989 season onwards, the championship would be decided by a top four finals playoff, discarding the 'first past the post' format after nearly a century of Association Football. This was to imitate the Australian Rules code (AFL). In the subsequent three years, 1989, 1990 and 1991, under coach Worden and then Alan Vest, Athena continually topped the State Premier League. The phenomenal 1990 team finished the season first with 17 wins, 1 draw and no losses with a goal difference of +55. A feat only three other teams have matched in going unbeaten, but never surpassed. However, Athena having achieved the top positions in all three seasons, lost in the top four play-off finals against rivals Perth SC (Perth Italia) and Stirling Macedonia. The Soccer Federation intelligently decided to revert to the more accepted and traditional 'first past the post' league championship format continually used around the world from 1992 onwards. If this rule had not changed, Floreat Athena would have seven league championships rather than the recorded four. =The Treble (1997)= In 1997, under coach Jim Pyraglios, the club won a record treble of titles winning the Night Series, League Championship and Association Cup. In 1999, they finished runners up to Inglewood in the Association Cup Final. In 2000, Athena won their fourth Night Series trophy. In 2001, Athena finished runners up in both the Association Cup Final and the Night Series Final to arch rival Perth Italia. In 2002, Athena again finished runners up to Perth Italia, this time in the State Premier League Championship. =Undefeated season (2007)= In the newly formed Football West, Floreat Athena was competing for their fourth State Premier League title. In 2004, a young squad was assembled under former Floreat Athena players Michael Roki and Taki Nicolaidis. Both players had been part of that 1990 side that went through the entire season undefeated. After finishing the 2004 season in ninth position, Athena finished fifth in 2005 and fourth in 2006, climbing the ladder. Athena signed former Perth Glory defender Ante Kovacevic who was to prove instrumental in the 2007 season. Jerry Karpeh scored 25 goals and Josip Magdic played the wing. Captain Bajo Savic played his last game for Athena against Cockburn in a match that helped seal the title for Athena. Savic suffered a serious knee injury and subsequently never played again. In the 2007 Football West Premier League season, Athena clinched the title undefeated with a 15-point gap over second place. There were several notable events during the season: * James Isaia's 94th minute long range goal to draw the match against Fremantle Spirit, * the 4‚Äì1 victory over rivals Perth SC at Dorrien Gardens, * the 4‚Äì0 win over the Stirling Lions at Litis Stadium, * the bicycle kick goal by Garin Collins on debut, and * the last round against Armadale at Alfred Skeet Oval, where Athena found itself down 2‚Äì0 in the first 10 minutes, but rallied to win the match 5‚Äì3. Being the fourth side in Western Australian State Premier League history to go through an entire season undefeated places Michael Roki and Taki Nicolaidis in the elite category of having played and coached Floreat Athena sides through undefeated seasons. Following the 2007 season, Floreat Athena dominated almost all opposition but failed to bring home the trophies. The team finished the 2008 season without a title, having lost the Night Series final to arch rival Perth SC on penalties. Athena was to finish Runners Up in the 2008 State Premier League to Sorrento whom they had beaten 9‚Äì3 on aggregate for the season. Floreat was gain defeated by Perth SC in the 2009 Night Series final. Floreat Athena managed to avenge the defeat Inglewood had inflicted upon them in the 1999 Association (Boral) Cup final by defeating them a decade later in the 2009 Association Cup final. Following the 2010 Night Series, Michael Roki decided it was time to retire due to work and family commitments. Floreat Athena was taken over by player-coach Ante Kovacevic for the beginning of the 2010 Football West Premier League season. Athena finished a respectable 4th in the league and finished Runners Up to the Stirling Lions in the 2010 Association Cup final. 2011‚Äìpresent It had been 11 years since Floreat Athena had been crowned Night Series champions. Ten players and management staff left at the end of the 2010 season. Coach Ante Kovacevic and assistant Taki Nicolaides assembled a fresh outfit that won the title in February 2011. Floreat Athena finished the season at the top of their group, dispatching Armadale and Forrestdale 3‚Äì1, and drawing to Inglewood 2‚Äì2 with goals coming from Liam Boland, Garin Collins, James Isaia and Danny Trevisol. All three games being played at Alfred Skeet Reserve. The quarter final against Sorrento was played at Athena's home ground, Litis Stadium. New recruit Dave Houston scored a goal in the 91st minute to set up a semi-final appearance. The semi-final against Cockburn City was played at 6PR Stadium. Athena went a goal down in the early stages of the first half but Liam Boland scored a goal back. Cockburn defender Paul Natale was sent off in the first half and Floreat Athena took the lead. Early in the second half, Boland scored his second of the game. Garin Collins then added a further two goals to make the score 4‚Äì1 and put Athena into another Night Series Grand Final. Saturday, 19 February 2011, Floreat Athena faced ECU Joondalup at Dorrien Gardens. In the 68th minute, a goal attempt by the right wing by Jack Allen was stopped by the ECU goalkeeper, however Liam Boland scored a goal from three yards. With 15 minutes remaining, a challenge on Athena goalkeeper Alex Dunn forced the no. 1 to leave the field with a head injury. Replacement goalkeeper Simon Madaschi took his place, making several saves in the remaining minutes to hold ECU at bay. The final score was 1‚Äì0. The club had its maiden FFA Cup appearance in 2016, when it qualified for the competition proper at the Round of 32 stage, drawing A-League club Melbourne City FC. Crest and colours Club crest and the Goddess Athena Both the club shield and the Goddess Athena feature on all Floreat Athena merchandise. Playing strips have always carried both emblems. The club shield has blue and white stripes and a football placed in the middle, signifying both the heritage and purpose of the club. The Goddess is the club's original namesake and features heavily on its merchandise and uniforms. Unlike other clubs with an ethnic past, Athena is allowed to keep her name because it is essentially non-ethnic. The Goddess is not a nationality but an idea, a symbol of virtue required in football and in life. Colours Floreat Athena \\"home\\" colours are blue and white stripes. Away strips have generally tended to be all white. However, this current format was not the original strip. In 1953, Athena had a predominantly blue strip with a white block 'V' topped off with a blue collar. Floreat Athena used a replica heritage strip in the 2011 season as it is the club's 60th Anniversary. Blue and white has significance as the majority of people who founded the club came from Greece. Stadium The Stan Lazaridis and Vas Kalogeracos tunnel Athena's first home was at Wellington Square in East Perth. The club later played at Perry Lakes Stadium in Floreat, leading to the addition of Floreat to the club's name. The club has played at Litis Stadium, formerly the Lake Monger Velodrome, in Mount Hawthorn since 1985. There are two grandstands, the Eleni grandstand and a more modern stand in front of the clubrooms which was built 20 years ago. A cycling tunnel has been left intact for players to use to and from the change rooms and is a feature of the ground. The tunnel was named after two famous Athena players: Stan Lazaridis and Vas Kalogeracos. Support Floreat Athena enjoys support from the Greek-Australian community though this has dropped in recent years. The current average attendance at Litis Stadium is between 300 and 500 people per match. This is a far cry from the 5,000 ‚Äì 10,000 that would regularly attend matches in the early years.

Population: . The city is located at the southeast of Luhansk Oblast in the middle of the main Donets River drainage divide that separates watershed of Velyka Kamianka to the north from watersheds of Kundryucha and Burhusta rivers to the south. To the north the city is passed around by a railway line Debaltseve-Zverevo (Russia) with a train station Krasna Mohyla located within the city limits. An international border between Russia-Ukraine runs along the eastern outskirts of the city. Here is located road border checkpoint as well as railway border checkpoint at the Krasna Mohyla train station. History The city was established in November 1960 in the middle of Provallya steppe which is named so for its deep valley with steep slopes. The valley slopes are covered with oak, maple, wild pear, and over a noisy river with willow on its banks. Its establishment amid Provallya steppe, Chervonopartyzansk is owed primarily to Soviet geologists who in 1930s discovered here large deposits of anthracite. The first mine #63 was built during the World War II (1944) and in 1947 there was founded a large coal- mining company, Chervonyi Partyzan Mine. Its projected capacity was 2.5 thousands tonnes of fossil fuel per day. In 1949-1955 next to Chervonyi Partyzan, there were built less powerful mines Provallya #1 and Provallya #2. In 1956 all of the mines yielded 2.3 thousands of tonnes of anthracite or 16.3% of total extraction by mines of the Sverdlovskvuhillya corporation. In September 1956 several populated places, among which were Voznesenivka, Novomykolaivka, Krasna Mohyla train station, and a residential neighborhood of the Chervonyi Partyzan Mine, united into a worker's urban-type settlement Chervonopartyzansk which was accounted already for 15,000 of male population. At the end of 1956 more mines were built. The call of the Communist Party and the Komsomol \\"Youth - on the construction of mines of Donbas!\\" raised thousands of young patriots. To the Provallya steppe with \\"Komsomol travel vouchers\\" arrived over 2,000 lads and lasses from Odessa and Chernivtsi regions and Moldavia to build over a span of year five mines on the northern slope of the Burhustyn gulch. Preparation to meet young volunteers organized the Sverdlovsk District Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine. Since 2014, Chervonopartyzansk has been controlled by the forces of the Luhansk People's Republic. In July 2014, the city was the scene of fighting during the 2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine.Four miners killed, 16 injured after artillery shell hits bus in Chervonopartyzansk - DTEK, Interfax-Ukraine (11 July 2014) In 2016 the city was renamed into Voznesenivka as part of decommunization in Ukraine. The city's name change process is temporarily suspended as it not fully controlled by the government of Ukraine. References External links * Bondar, O. Chervonopartyzansk.

It is a compilation of quotes from founders of the United States of America and select government documents, including information on the rights of a jury to \\"nullify bad law\\" and acquit people on trial. The author of the Rule Book says that jurors have the right to nullify a trial if the law is unconstitutional or is being used in an unconstitutional manner. Originally published anonymously, the Citizens Rule Book is now known to have been written by Charles R. Olsen, a World War II Marine veteran and printer from Boston. It is distributed by the Fully Informed Jury Association, among other groups. Contents The Citizens Rule Book is divided into three sections. The first section deals with the rights of juries, the second section discusses the views of American founders regarding jury trials, and the third section summarizes important founding documents of the United States. Section 1: A Handbook for Jurors The Citizens Rule Book claims that citizens are \\"above the law\\" and may nullify any law which is unconstitutional. It says that a citizen's power comes directly from God, therefore jurors are not beholden to decisions made by judges or other government agents. According to the book, \\"each JUROR has MORE POWER than the President, all of Congress, and all of the judges combined!\\" By issuing a verdict of \\"not guilty\\", even against the wishes of all other jurors, a single juror may \\"hang\\" a trial, resulting in a mistrial. The Rule Book advocates the use of this tactic to overturn cases in which a person is guilty of a crime, but the law in question is unconstitutional. This section also says that the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights are based on the Biblical Ten Commandments. In contrast, \\"many of the planks of the Communist Manifesto are now represented by law in the U.S.\\" Section 2: Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death! In this section, the Citizens Rule Book says that the founders of the United States believed all juries should be composed of people who personally know the accused. It quotes Patrick Henry, Representative John Holmes, and Declaration of Independence signatory James Wilson to the effect that jurors should be familiar with the \\"character\\" of the defendant on trial. Section 3: Index to the Original Documents In this section, the Citizens Rule Book provides summaries and commentaries on three important founding documents of the United States: the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. Distribution The printers claim that over three million copies of the Citizens Rule Book have been published. Family-owned and operated Whitten Printers continues to print and distribute this booklet. The Citizens Rule Book is available in single or bulk quantities direct from the publisher and online through Homeschool Patriot. The book is given away free through such sources as radio-host and filmmaker Alex Jones with every order from his Infowars Shop, he also offers bulk-order options. Creationist Kent Hovind sold the book online through his website. Notable events The Citizens Rule Book had a significant role in the 1997 Idaho trials of three Christian Identity militants and members of the Idaho Militia, who identified themselves as \\"Phineas Priests\\". The three - Charles Barbee, Robert Berry and Verne Jay Merrell - were charged with bombing a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic and the Spokane Valley office of The Spokesman-Review, and with twice robbing a U.S. Bank branch (April 1 and July 12, 1996). The book was mentioned in the opening statement for the defense in the trial of Timothy McVeigh as being possessed by one of the alternative suspects proposed by the defense.

Irwin achieved worldwide fame from the television series The Crocodile Hunter (1996‚Äì2007), an internationally broadcast wildlife documentary series that he co-hosted with his wife Terri. The couple also hosted the series Croc Files (1999‚Äì2001), The Crocodile Hunter Diaries (2002‚Äì2006), and New Breed Vets (2005). They also co- owned and operated Australia Zoo, founded by Irwin's parents in Beerwah, about north of the Queensland state capital of Brisbane. Irwin died on 4 September 2006 after being pierced in the chest by a stingray barb while filming in Australia's Great Barrier Reef. His death became international news and was met with expressions of shock and grief by fans, the media, governments, non- profit organizations, and other celebrities. Numerous parks, zoos, streets, and an asteroid have been named in his honour. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society named its island-class patrol vessel MY Steve Irwin after Irwin. His widow Terri Irwin, with whom he had two children, continues to operate Australia Zoo.  Early life  Irwin was born on his mother's birthday to Lyn and Bob Irwin in Upper Ferntree Gully, a suburb of Melbourne. He was of Irish descent on his father's side. He moved with his parents as a child to Queensland in 1970, where he attended Landsborough State School and Caloundra State High School.\\"Honour Steve Irwin's passion for nature\\" , Queensland Government Department of Education and Training, 2006. Irwin described his father as a wildlife expert interested in herpetology, while his mother Lyn was a wildlife rehabilitator. After moving to Queensland, Bob and Lyn Irwin started the small Queensland Reptile and Fauna Park, where Steve grew up around crocodiles and other reptiles. Irwin became involved with the park in a number of ways, including taking part in daily animal feeding, as well as care and maintenance activities. On his sixth birthday, he was given a scrub python. He began handling crocodiles at the age of nine after his father had educated him on reptiles from an early age. Also at age nine, he wrestled his first crocodile, again under his father's supervision. He worked as a volunteer for Queensland's East Coast Crocodile Management program and captured over 100 crocodiles, some of which were relocated, while others were housed at the family park.\\"The Irwin Family\\" , Australia Zoo web site.

Career   Marriage and family  Irwin's widow, Terri Raines Irwin In 1991, Irwin met Terri Raines, an American naturalist from Eugene, Oregon, who was visiting wildlife rehabilitation facilities in Australia and had decided to visit the zoo. According to the couple, it was love at first sight. Terri said at the time, \\"I thought there was no one like this anywhere in the world. He sounded like an environmental Tarzan, a larger-than-life superhero guy.\\" They were engaged four months later and were married in Eugene on 4 June 1992. Together they had two children: a daughter, Bindi Sue Irwin (born 24 July 1998), and a son, Robert Clarence (named after Irwin's father) Irwin (born 1 December 2003). Bindi Sue is jointly named after two of Steve Irwin's favourite animals: Bindi, a saltwater crocodile, and Sui, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Irwin was as enthusiastic about his family as he was about his work. He once described his daughter Bindi as \\"the reason [he] was put on the Earth.\\" His wife once said, \\"The only thing that could ever keep him away from the animals he loves are the people he loves even more.\\" Although the Irwins were happily married, they did not wear wedding rings; they believed that in their line of work, wearing jewellery could pose a hazard to them and/or the animals.Americanprofile.com.

Improvements to the Australia Zoo include the Animal Planet Crocoseum, the rainforest aviary and Tiger Temple. Irwin mentioned that he was considering opening an Australia Zoo in Las Vegas, Nevada, and possibly at other sites around the world. In 2001, Irwin appeared in a cameo role in the Eddie Murphy film Dr. Dolittle 2, in which an alligator warns Dolittle that he knows Irwin is going to grab him and is prepared to attack when he does, but Dolittle fails to warn Irwin in time. Irwin's only starring feature film role was in 2002's The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course, which was released to mixed reviews. In the film Irwin (who portrayed himself and performed numerous stunts) mistakes some CIA agents for poachers. He sets out to stop them from capturing a crocodile, which, unknown to him, has actually swallowed a tracking transmitter. The film won the Best Family Feature Film award for a comedy film at the Young Artist Awards. The film was produced on a budget of about US$12 million, and has grossed $33 million. To promote the film, Irwin was featured in an animated short produced by Animax Entertainment for Intermix.

Irwin and his entire crew suspended operations to aid in the search. His team's divers searched with the rescue divers, and Irwin used his vessel to patrol the waters around the island where the incident occurred, as well as using his satellite communications system to call in a rescue plane. On the second day of the search, kayakers found one of the divers, Scott Jones, perched on a narrow rock ledge jutting out from the side of a cliff.

Irwin laughingly shared the experience with the Queensland State of Origin squad before the 2006 series.Tributes flow for 'true original'. Retrieved 12 September 2006 Irwin also supported rugby union, being a fan of the national team, the Wallabies. He once wore a Wallaby jersey during a demonstration at the zoo. A behind-the-scenes episode of The Crocodile Hunter showed Irwin and the crew finding a petrol station in a remote part of Namibia to watch the Wallabies defeat France in the 1999 Rugby World Cup Final. Irwin was also a talented surfer.  Controversies  approaching Melbourne in February 2008 A controversial incident occurred during a public show on 2 January 2004, when Irwin carried his one-month-old son, Robert, in his arm while hand-feeding a chicken carcass to Murray, a saltwater crocodile. The infant was close to the crocodile, and comparisons were made in the press to Michael Jackson's dangling his son outside a German hotel window. In addition, some child welfare groups, animal rights groups, and some of Irwin's television viewers criticised his actions as irresponsible and tantamount to child abuse. Irwin apologised on the US NBC show Today. Both he and his wife publicly stated that Irwin was in complete control of the situation, as he had dealt with crocodiles since he was a small child, and based on his lifetime of experience neither he nor his son was in any danger. He also showed footage of the event shot from a different angle, demonstrating that they were much farther from the crocodile than they had appeared in the publicised clip. Terri Irwin said their child was in no more danger than one being taught to swim. No charges were filed; according to one journalist, Irwin told officials he would not repeat the action. The incident prompted the Queensland government to change its crocodile-handling laws, banning children and untrained adults from entering crocodile enclosures. In June 2004, allegations were made that he disturbed wildlife (namely whales, seals and penguins) while filming a documentary, Ice Breaker, in Antarctica. The matter was subsequently closed without charges being laid. After questions arose in 2003 about Irwin being paid $175,000 worth of taxpayers' money to appear in a television advertisement and his possible political ties, Irwin told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that he was a conservationist and did not choose sides in politics. His comments describing Australian Prime Minister John Howard as the \\"greatest leader in the world\\" earned him scorn in the media. Irwin was criticised for having an unsophisticated view of conservation in Australia that seemed more linked to tourism than to the problems Australia faces as a continent. In response to questions of Australia's problems with overgrazing, salinity, and erosion, Irwin responded, \\"Cows have been on our land for so long that Australia has evolved to handle those big animals.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald concluded with the opinion that his message was confusing and amounted to \\"eating roos and crocs is bad for tourism, and therefore more cruel than eating other animals\\".  Death  Irwin died on 4 September 2006 after being pierced in the chest by a stingray barb while filming in Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The stinger penetrated his thoracic wall, causing massive trauma. He was at Batt Reef, near Port Douglas, Queensland, taking part in the production of the documentary series Ocean's Deadliest. During a lull in filming caused by inclement weather, Irwin decided to snorkel in shallow waters while being filmed in an effort to provide footage for his daughter's television program. While swimming in chest-deep water, Irwin approached a short-tail stingray with an approximate span of two metres (6.5 ft) from the rear, in order to film it swimming away. According to the incident's only witness, \\"All of a sudden [the stingray] propped on its front and started stabbing wildly with its tail. Hundreds of strikes in a few seconds\\". Irwin initially believed he only had a punctured lung. However, the stingray's barb pierced his heart, causing him to bleed to death. The stingray's behaviour appeared to have been a defensive response to being boxed in. Crew members aboard Irwin's boat administered CPR and rushed him to the nearby Low Isles where medical staff pronounced him dead. Irwin's death is believed to be the only fatality from a stingray captured on video. Footage of the incident was viewed by Queensland state police as part of their mandatory investigations. All copies of the footage were then destroyed at the behest of Irwin's family. Production was completed on Ocean's Deadliest, which was broadcast in the US on the Discovery Channel on 21 January 2007. The documentary was completed with footage shot in the weeks following the accident, but without including any mention of Irwin's accidental death.  Reactions  News of Irwin's death prompted reactions around the world. Then‚ÄìPrime Minister John Howard expressed \\"shock and distress\\" at the death, saying that \\"Australia has lost a wonderful and colourful son.\\" Queensland's then-Premier Peter Beattie remarked that Irwin would \\"be remembered as not just a great Queenslander, but a great Australian\\". The Australian federal parliament opened on 5 September 2006 with condolence speeches by both Howard and the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley. Flags at the Sydney Harbour Bridge were lowered to half mast in honour of Irwin.\\"Harbour Bridge flags lowered for icons\\", News Corporation (news.com.au), 19 September 2006. In the days following Irwin's death, reactions dominated Australian online news sources, talk-back radio programs, and television networks.\\"Yahoo7 TV Tribute to Steve Irwin\\". Seven Network. In the United States, where Irwin had appeared in over 200 Discovery Network television programs, special tributes appeared on the Animal Planet channel, as well as on CNN and major TV talk shows.The Sydney Morning Herald \\"Aussie 'Superman' brings tears to US chat shows\\" Thousands of Irwin's fans visited Australia Zoo after his death, paying their respects and bringing flowers, candles, stuffed animals and messages of support. Jacques Cousteau's grandson and Jean-Michel's nephew, Philippe Cousteau Jr., called Irwin \\"a remarkable individual\\". Describing the Ocean's Deadliest project (on which he worked along with Irwin), Philippe said, \\"I think why Steve was so excited about it that we were looking at these animals that people think of as, you know, dangerous and deadly monsters, and they're not. They all have an important place in the environment and in the world. And that was what his whole message was about.\\" In the weeks following Irwin's death, at least ten stingrays were found dead and mutilated on the beaches of Queensland, with their tails cut off, prompting speculation as to whether they might have been killed by fans of Irwin as an act of revenge, although, according to the chairman of the Queensland fishing information service, anglers regularly cut the tails off of accidentally caught stingrays to avoid being stung. Michael Hornby, a friend of Irwin and executive director of his Wildlife Warrior fund, condemned any revenge killings, saying that \\"We just want to make it very clear that we will not accept and not stand for anyone who's taken a form of retribution. That's the last thing Steve would want.\\"  Funeral and memorial services  The \\"Crocoseum\\" at Australia Zoo, where Steve Irwin's memorial service was held. Family and friends of Irwin held a private funeral service in Caloundra on 9 September 2006. Irwin was buried in a private ceremony at Australia Zoo later that same day; the grave site is inaccessible to the zoo's visitors. Prime Minister Howard and Queensland Premier Beattie had offered to hold a state funeral, but Irwin's family decided this would not be appropriate and‚Äîin the words of his father‚Äîhe would have preferred to be remembered as an \\"ordinary bloke\\". On 20 September, a public memorial service, introduced by Russell Crowe, was held in Australia Zoo's 5,500-seat Crocoseum; this service was broadcast live throughout Australia, the United States, the UK, Germany, and Asia, and it is estimated to have been seen by over 300 million viewers worldwide. The memorial included remarks by Prime Minister Howard; Irwin's father Bob and daughter Bindi; his associates Wes Mannion and John Stainton; and celebrities from Australia and around the world. Anthony Field of The Wiggles partly hosted the service, often sharing the screen with various animals, from koalas to elephants. Australian music star John Williamson sang \\"True Blue\\", which was Irwin's favourite song. In a symbolic finish to the service, Irwin's truck was loaded up with gear and driven out of the arena for the last time as Williamson sang. As a final tribute, Australia Zoo staff spelled out Irwin's catchphrase \\"Crikey\\" in yellow flowers as Irwin's truck was driven from the Crocoseum for the last time to end the service.  Legacy  On 1 January 2007, Glass House Mountains Road, the road that runs by the Australia Zoo, was officially renamed Steve Irwin Way.Steve Irwin gets his Way . Retrieved 2 January 2007 Later that year the Australian government announced that a 135,000-hectare (334,000-acre) national park was being created in northern Queensland and would be named the Steve Irwin Wildlife Reserve.\\"Govt to buy Cape York land for Irwin memorial reserve\\" , ABC News, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 22 July 2007.

Utigurs were nomadic equestrians who flourished in the Pontic-Caspian steppe in the 6th century AD. They were similar to the Kutrigurs to their west. Etymology The name Ut(r)igur, recorded as Œü·Ω∫œÑ(œÑ)œÅŒØŒ≥ŒøœÖœÅŒøŒπ, Œü·Ω∫œÑŒøœçœÅŒ≥ŒøœÖœÅŒøŒπ and Œü·Ω∫œÑœÅŒØŒ≥ŒøœÖ, is generally considered as a metathecized form suggested by Gyula N√©meth of Turkic *Otur-Oƒüur, thus the *Uturƒüur mean \\"Thirty Oƒüurs (tribes)\\". Lajos Ligeti proposed utur- (to resist), while Louis Bazin uturkar (the victors-conquerors), Quturgur and qudurmaq (the enrages). There has been little scholarly support for theories linking the names Kutrigur and Utigur to peoples such as the Guti/Quti and/or Udi/Uti, of Ancient Southwest Asia and the Caucasus respectively, which have been posited by scholars such as Osman Karatay, and Yury Zuev. No evidence has been presented that the Guti moved from their homeland in the Zagros Mountains (modern Iran/Iraq) to the Steppes, and they are widely believed to have spoken an Indo-European (rather than Turkic) language. The Udi were mentioned by Pliny the Elder (Natural History, VI, book, 39), in connection with the Aorsi (sometimes jointly as the Utidorsi), the Sarmatians and a Scythian caste/tribe known as the Aroteres (\\"Cultivators\\"), who lived \\"above the maritime coast of [Caucasian] Albania and the ... Udini\\" on the western shores of the Caspian Sea. Neither is there general acceptance of Edwin G. Pulleyblank's suggestion that the Utigurs may be linked to the Yuezhi ‚Äì an Indo-European people that settled in Western China during ancient times. History The origin of relative tribes Utigurs and Kutrigurs is obscure. Procopius wrote that \\"Beyond the Sagins dwell many Hunnish tribes. The land is called Evlisia and barbarians populate the sea-coast and the inland up to the so called lake of Meotida and the river Tanais. The people living there were called Cimmerians, and now they are called Utigurs. North of them are the populous tribes of the Antes.\\" They occupied the Don-Azov steppe zone, the Kutrigurs in the Western part and the Utigurs towards the East. Procopius also recorded a genealogical legend according to which: This story was also confirmed by the words of the Utigur ruler Sandilch, \\"it is neither fair nor decent to exterminate our tribesmen (the Kutrigurs), who not only speak a language, identical to ours, who are our neighbours and have the same dressing and manners of life, but who are also our relatives, even though subjected to other lords\\". Agathias (c. 579‚Äì582) wrote: When the Kutrigurs invaded the lands of the Byzantium Empire, Emperor Justinian I (527‚Äì565) through diplomatic persuasion and bribery dragged the Kutrigurs and Utigurs into mutual warfare. Utigurs led by Sandilch attacked the Kutrigurs who suffered great losses. According to Procopius, Agathias and Menander, the Kutrigurs and Utigurs decimated one another, until they lost even their tribal names. Some Kutrigur remnants were swept away by the Avars to Pannonia, while the Utigurs remained in the Pontic steppe and fell under the rule of the T√ºrks. Their last mention was by Menander Protector, who recorded among the T√ºrk forces that attacked Bosporos in 576 an Utigur army led by chieftain ŒëŒΩŒ¨Œ≥Œ±ŒπŒøœÇ (Anagai, Anaƒüay). Bosphoros fell to them c. 579 AD. In the same year, Byzantine embassy to the T√ºrks passed through the territory of ·ºàŒ∫Œ∫Œ¨Œ≥Œ±œÇ (Akagas, Aq-Qaƒüan), \\"which is the name of the woman who rules the Scythians there, having been appointed at that time by Anagai, chief of the tribe of the Utigurs\\".

Population:  History  250px Zmiiv on the map of Izium Cossack Regiment (surveyor Yakia Yseniev), 1725. The oldest settlement dates back to the 1st millennium B.C. Here were the Scythians, Sarmatians, Goths, Huns, Alans, Avars, Polovtsians, Pechenegs, Tatars, and Slavs. Igor Svyatoslavich, Novgorod-Seversky prince, waged wars with the Polovtsy, founded in 1180 - 1185 years on Donets at the mouth of the river Mzha the Zmiiv Settlement. The new wave of settlement of the Wild Field lands, and in particular the lands of the Slobozhanshchina, dates back to the 1630-50s, when thousands of Ukrainians were forced to flee from massacre after unsuccessful revolts against the Polish authorities. 1640 is the official date of foundation of the city. But in the same year, the Tatars seized the city, which was captured by Cossacks Kondratii Sulima. In the 1650s, to the south of the Zmiiv appeared the Zmiiv Nikolaev Cossack Monastery, which was the castle of the old, wounded and other Cossacks. It is believed that the monastery was a treasure chest; it had 6,000 acres of land and numerous buildings. In 1656 it was sent to the city by the Tsar of Moscow, Yakov Khitrovo. At the end of 17 ct., the Zmiiv was already a large enough settlement, surrounded by posts: Zamost, Zidki, and Sands. And if for some time he was a part of the Chuguev uyezd, then from 1657 he became the center of the newly created Zmiev uyezd. Sources also mention the weapons of the local fortress: in 1668 it had 7 large cast iron guns, 290 cores and a lot of gunpowder, with 2 shafts surrounding it and a system of underground passages. In 1688, 1692 and 1736, Tatar attacks were carried out on the city –ó–º–∏–µ–≤ // –ì–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ-—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å: –í 5 —Ç–æ–º–∞—Ö / –°–æ—Å—Ç. –ü. –ü. –°–µ–º—ë–Ω–æ–≤. ‚Äî –°–ü–±., 1865. ‚Äî –¢. 2. ‚Äî –°. 281.. The presence of settlements in Slobozhana under the rule of the Russian tsar and the strong oppression on the part of the church and the cossack elders did not best reflect the mood of the freedom-loving settlers. Thus, in 1668, a rebellion broke out in a number of towns and cities in Slobozhanshchyna, which was headed by Ivan Sirko.

On September 21, 1781, the coat of arms of the city was not officially approved by the Senate of the Russian Empire and Catherine II in one day with all the coat of arms of the county cities and the provincial center of Kharkiv and Voronezh governorships, because the Zmiiv was not then a county town. The coat of arms is \\"old\\", that is, historical, and made long before its approval. A distinctive feature of the \\"old\\" coats of arms was the only field of the shield - with the coat of arms of the city itself (without the coat of arms of the governorate / provincial center at the top). It was officially approved on September 21, 1803 personally by Emperor Alexander I. The red box of the coat of arms depicts a \\"golden serpent twisting upwards and a crown worn on its head\\" showing the name of the city and the abundance of snakes in the vicinity. In 1863 K. Kene drafted the emblem of the city: On a red shield a golden serpent twisting in a pillar; in the free part of the shield the coat of arms of Kharkiv province; the shield is topped with a silver tower crown and surrounded by gold spikes connected by an Alexander ribbon. On the coat of arms of the city of the XVIII century the artist depicted a creeping snake, unlike the coat of arms of the beginning of the XIX century, which depicts a standing snake. The modern coat of arms was approved by the City Council in the 1990s. It, like the coat of arms of the early 19th century, depicts a snake standing.

Early life As a young woman, Marie became pregnant by a palace servant.Pope-Hennessy, pp. 340-343. The servant, a married man named Hecht, was responsible for turning off the gas-lights in the bedrooms of the grand ducal children. Several of Marie's cousins, including the future King George V of the United Kingdom and William II, German Emperor, thought that Marie had been \\"hypnotised\\", while Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom thought that Marie had been \\"drugged\\". Hecht was dismissed from service on the charge of stealing; his subsequent lawsuit against the grand ducal family made the details of the story public. The story made radical newspaper headlines in its day.Pope-Hennessy, p. 339. A daughter was born to Marie in 1898; she was raised under the protection of Marie's grandmother Augusta, Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.Le Royaume- Uni de Grande-Bretagne et Irlande du Nord (Paris : Cercle d'√âtudes des Dynasties Royales Europ√©ennes, 1989): II, 145. First marriage Marie went to France where she met Count George Jametel (1859‚Äì1944), the son of Ernest Jametel, a banker and patent medicine manufacturer, and nephew of the politician Gustave-Louis Jametel; he had received the title of Papal Count from Pope Leo XIII in 1886. The acquaintance proceeded at a brisk pace, and Marie and George were married on 22 June 1899, only one year after the birth of Marie's illegitimate child. The wedding was held at the Catholic Chapel of St. Elizabeth in Richmond Park, near White Lodge, the home of Marie's great- aunt the Duchess of Teck. A second Anglican wedding ceremony was held the same day at the Parish Church of Kew.\\"A Morganatic Marriage\\", The New York Times (23 June 1899): 7. In spite of the fact that the marriage was morganatic, many members of Marie's family attended the wedding, including her grandparents, parents, and three siblings. The wedding breakfast was given by her great- uncle the Duke of Cambridge at Cambridge Cottage, Kew.\\"Court Circular\\", The Times (23 June 1899): 6. Marie's younger brother Karl Borwin, killed by Count Jametel while defending his sister's honour. Marie and George received a large financial settlement ($200,000) from Marie's father.\\"Countess Wants Divorce\\", The New York Times (9 February 1908): C1. They lived in the Faubourg St. Germain in Paris. They had two children: * Count George Jametel (3 February 1904 - 1982) * Countess Marie Auguste Jametel (11 September 1905 - 24 September 1969) Marie's husband George had several affairs, most notoriously with the married Infanta Eulalia of Spain, daughter of Isabella II of Spain.Ricardo Mateo Sainz de Medrano, \\"L'Affaire Jametel\\", Royalty Digest (vol. 8, no. 96): 360. In January 1908, Marie applied for a divorce from George.\\"Royal Divorce Probable\\", The New York Times (1 February 1908): 4. She accused the Count of having married her for her money, and of having continued his affair with Infanta Eulalia. When the matter went to court, Marie's own scandalous past, as the unwed mother of a manservant's child, was revealed and thrown in her face; as a result, Marie's family suffered much public disgrace. In August the same year, while the case was still proceeding in court, Marie's youngest brother, the nineteen-year-old Duke Karl Borwin of Mecklenburg, felt moved to challenge his brother-in-law to a duel, supposedly in defence of Marie's honour. The duel took place, and it was Marie's brother, Karl Borwin, who was killed. Marie and George were divorced 31 December 1908.Almanach de Gotha, 1910, 61. Having lost her fortune due to the divorce, Marie resumed the use of her Mecklenburg title and lived in the Blasewitz section of Dresden. Second marriage On 11 August 1914, at Neustrelitz, Marie married Prince Julius Ernst of Lippe (1873‚Äì1952), third son of Count Ernst of Lippe- Biesterfeld, brother of Leopold IV, Prince of Lippe and uncle of Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands.\\"German Royal Engagement\\", The Times ( 29 April 1914): 7. They were among the guests at the 1937 wedding of Juliana of the Netherlands to Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld. After their marriage Marie and Julius lived in Blasewitz. They had two children: * Princess Elisabeth of Lippe (23 January 1916 - 16 May 2013); married Prince Ernst- August of Solms-Braunfels * Prince Ernst August of Lippe (1 April 1917 - 15 June 1990); a claimant to the headship of the House of Lippe. Marie died at the age of seventy in Oberkassel, near Bonn. She is buried with her second husband in the Lippe family mausoleum at Heisterbach Abbey.

He produced over 100 plays there between 1926 and 1933. Later in life, under the pen name Wei Wu Wei, he published several books on Taoist philosophy. Background Terence James Stannus Gray was born in Felixstowe, Suffolk, England on 14 September 1895, the son of Harold Stannus Gray and a member of a well-established Anglo-Irish family. He was raised on an estate in the Gog Magog Hills outside Cambridge, England. He received a thorough education at Ascham St Vincent's School, Eastbourne, Eton and Oxford University. Early in life he pursued an interest in Egyptology which culminated in the publication of two books on ancient Egyptian history and culture in 1923. In the later part of his life he lived with his second wife, the Georgian princess Natalie Margaret Imeretinsky, in Monaco. He had previously been married to a Russian noblewoman, Rimsky-Korsakov. Gray knew, among others, Lama Anagarika Govinda, Dr. Hubert Benoit, John Blofeld, Douglas Harding, Robert Linssen, Arthur Osborne, Robert Powell and Dr. D. T. Suzuki. Gray maintained his family's racehorses in England and Ireland and in 1957 his horse Zarathustra won the Ascot Gold Cup, ridden by jockey Lester Piggott in the first of his eleven wins of that race. Cambridge Festival Theatre In the 1920s and 1930s Gray worked as a theorist, theatrical producer, creator of radical \\"dance-dramas\\", publisher of several related magazines and author of two related books. His cousin was Ninette de Valois, founder of the Royal Ballet. In 1926, Gray, with no previous practical theatrical experience, opened the Cambridge Festival Theatre as an experimental playhouse. He acquired the old Theatre Royal in the Cambridge suburb of Barnwell, and substantially rebuilt it. The opening production was Aeschylus' The Orestia, with de Valois as choreographer, and he continued to produce non-naturalistic productions, emphasising movement over speech. Critics were divided, with some praising his achievements, and others saying he sacrificed text and acting to clever trickery. Gray delighted in upsetting audiences but, despite controversy, audiences filled the theatre. Many of Gray's collaborators left the project over his inability to compromise. By 1933 he had abandoned theatre for good. Taoism After he had apparently exhausted his interest in the theatre, his thoughts turned towards philosophy and metaphysics. This led to a period of travel throughout Asia, including time spent at Ramana Maharshi's ashram in Tiruvannamalai, India. Between the years 1958 and 1974, eight books and articles in various periodicals appeared under the pseudonym \\"Wei Wu Wei\\" (Wu wei, a Taoist term which translates as \\"action that is non-action\\"). His identity as the author was not revealed at the time of publication for reasons he outlined in the Preface to the first book, Fingers Pointing Towards the Moon (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1958). The next 16 years saw the appearance of seven subsequent books, including his final work under the further pseudonym \\"O.O.O.\\" in 1974. Wei Wu Wei influenced among others, the British mathematician and author G. Spencer-Brown, Galen Sharp, and Ramesh Balsekar. Wei Wu Wei is discussed in some detail in the book Taoism for Dummies (John Wiley and Sons Canada, 2013).

His father was an English shoemaker who immigrated in the early part of the 19th century to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before settling in Pittsburgh. Phipps grew up with Andrew Carnegie as a friend and neighbor. As an adult, he was Carnegie's business partner in the Carnegie Steel Company and became a very wealthy man. He was the company's second-largest shareholder and also invested in real estate. After selling his stock in Carnegie Steel, Phipps became a leading advocate of housing for the poor and a major philanthropist. He embraced the principle that those who have achieved great wealth should give back for the public good and create institutions dedicated to that purpose. Phipps and his wife Anne had five children: Amy, John S., Helen, Henry Carnegie, and Howard. Business activities In 1907, Phipps established the Bessemer Trust Company to manage his substantial assets that would be shared by his offspring following his death. Phipps was also one of the pioneer investors in Florida real estate. At one time, he and his family owned one-third of the town of Palm Beach, 28 miles of oceanfront between Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale, prime bayfront property in downtown Miami, and 75 square miles of land in Martin County. The Phipps family donated to the town of Palm Beach one of the most significant gifts in county history: an ocean- to-lake frontage property that is now known as Phipps Park. Another contribution was the Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens in Pittsburgh. The Phipps family owned country estates in Old Westbury, New York, on the Gold Coast, the stretch of land on the North Shore of Long Island that once held the greatest concentration of wealth and power in America. Phipps built a mansion on 115 acres in Lake Success, New York (also on the Gold Coast), which he used from its completion in 1919 until his death in 1930. During World War II, John Phipps and his wife Margarita arranged for the home to be used to house British evacuees. In 1949 the family donated the property to the Great Neck School District. The mansion was converted into the administration building for the district, and Great Neck South High School and Junior High School were built on the site. Legacy By 1974, Bessemer Trust Company developed an expertise in wealth management that allowed it to take on other clients through the creation of a national bank headquartered in New York City. Phipps' grandchildren, from his son John S. Phipps, donated to the public the Westbury House estate that is now known as Old Westbury Gardens. Gladys Mills Phipps, granddaughter of Darius Ogden Mills and wife of Henry Carnegie Phipps, was prominent among horse breeders and owners in American Thoroughbred horse racing, as were her son, daughters and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She founded Wheatley Stable with her brother, Odgen Livingston Mills. Recently, first cousins Odgen Mills (Dinny) Phipps and Stewart Janney III's horse Orb won the 2013 Kentucky Derby.

Purpose of indirect sales  The sole purpose of a contract sales organization is to provide sales resource to its clients, without taking title to their products. Sales outsourcing providers include manufacturers' representatives, contract sales organizations, sales agents or SO outsourcing consultants. One way of organising the sales effort, especially when product delivery is erratic, is to replace or supplement internal resources with functionality and expertise brought in from contract sales organisations. SO outsourcing is quite different from large-scale service outsourcing, which has its advantages but also requires pro-active contract and relationship management. In addition to full sales outsourcing, many partial models are observed, particularly in large firms.  Advantages  SO is expected to be cheaper than the fully loaded cost of employing salespeople, but calculating the cost comparison over time is far from straightforward. Nevertheless, replacing fixed costs with variable costs is attractive to budget-holders. However, unlike many forms of outsourcing, the advantages of sales outsourcing does not often come from saving costs but rather increasing revenue or providing speed of response or flexibility. The business case for sales outsourcing should also include consideration of the cost of controlling the contract. Difficulty in measuring the link between sales activity and sales performance leads to a preference for employed salespeople. However, the issues internally are often the same and the internal hire has many other corporate \\"distractions\\" that do not occur with external resources. Companies may also choose sales outsourcing as a means of accessing the best sales skills. Although the pejorative term ‚Äúrent-a-rep‚Äù is still used, there is some evidence that contractors are perceived as good performers against qualitative as well as quantitative performance criteria. Even so, the reputational risk of third parties handling customer relationships has been observed as a factor restricting sales outsourcing. One could argue that an employee is often using a company to gain 2‚Äì3 years salary and experience whereas a sales outsourcing firm would usually be looking at a long-term contract even though the staff may change during that time. So the aims of an outsourcer can be closely aligned with the aims and objectives of the contracting company. A recent study has highlighted flexibility as an important driver for outsourcing sales. Uncertain business environments accentuate the need to turn sales resource on and off quickly. Industries and companies undergoing rapid change may need to avoid hiring and firing costs and risks. Contract sales organizations can absorb employment risk, enabling their clients to respond to short-term opportunities or competitor activity (see Lean startup). However, an outsourcer may build in more of a premium to the rate or commission if excessive flexibility is required on a contract. Contract sales organizations are growing in volume and influence, able to provide both tactical activity and long-term strategic support to their clients. Speed of response is seen as a key reason to use an outsourcer. If a company was looking to enter a market it may take several months to recruit the local manager which then takes several months to find an office and build a team. With an outsourcer, a full working team can oftentimes be operational within a matter of days or weeks. Sales outsourcing can also be used as a market entry strategy and avoids permanent establishment risk. The sales outsourcing is gaining popularity among the startups in venturing into a new market. The primary reason being the increasing number of technology based startups around the globe where no physical product is involved. The startups working with limited resources can do a quick market validation by hiring temporary sales force in the targeted market. Indirect sales growth rate The experience of many organizations over the past several years demonstrates that indirect channels can be critical to expanding market coverage. This has been particularly true in the electronics, communications and high tech sectors. For example, the indirect channel now accounts for 66 percent of overall technology sales, up from 53 percent in 1997. The U.S. B2B technology market experienced 6% dollar growth in 2018. During the period, hardware represented 73% of revenue and grew 5%, while software represented 27% of revenue and grew 11%. Examples of indirect sales companies Some examples of communications companies who employ indirect sales forces to their internal sales efforts include: AireSpring, AT&T;, Comcast, Earthlink Business, Integra Telecom, Level 3 Communications, Time Warner Cable, TelePacific, tw telecom, XO Communications, and Windstream. Some top sales agencies who sell voice and data services for these carriers include Telarus, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, Intelisys, based in Petaluma, California, and Telecom Brokerage Inc (TBI), based in Chicago, Illinois.

It was established in 1881 by American humorist Edgar Wilson (\\"Bill\\") Nye, who named the paper after his mule, \\"Boomerang\\", named (said Nye) because he could trust the mule to return him home no matter how inebriated and disoriented Nye might become. Nye contributed several humorous articles to the Boomerang, and served as the paper's editor until 1884. The Boomerang was founded while Nye was the postmaster of the city (then in the Wyoming Territory). It launched him to national fame, gaining the newspaper subscribers in every state and many foreign countries. At its inception in March, 1881, the paper's masthead read simply \\"Boomerang\\" or \\"The Daily Boomerang\\" and was published daily except Sundays and holidays, with the Saturday edition being titled \\"Saturday Boomerang\\" briefly in 1891‚Äì2. Related titles were also issued: \\"The Weekly Boomerang\\" (1895-1904) and \\"The Semi- Weekly Boomerang\\" (from 1894-1912). In 1901, the paper became \\"Laramie Boomerang\\", and was published daily except Sundays (or during some periods, except Mondays instead). In 1923, the Boomerang merged with Laramie's other newspaper, The Laramie Republican, retaining the issue numbering of the older paper, the Republican. The combined press published as \\"The Laramie Republican and the Laramie Boomerang\\" (as a daily except Sunday until 1927) then as \\"The Laramie Republican-Boomerang\\" (as a daily except Saturday until 1937) and then as \\"The Laramie Republican and Boomerang\\" (also as a daily except Saturday). In 1957, another local paper (The Laramie Daily Bulletin, which had been publishing Tuesdays through Saturdays since 1931) merged with the Republican and Boomerang presses, and the paper became \\"The Laramie Daily Boomerang\\" (published as a daily except Mondays). In 2004, the word \\"Daily\\" was dropped from the masthead.

Some of the news archives date back to 18th century. There is a timeline view available, to select news from various years. History The archive went live on June 6, 2006, after Google acquired PaperofRecord.com, originally created by Robert J. Huggins and his team at Cold North Wind, Inc. The acquisition was not publicly announced by Cold North Wind until 2008. While the service initially provided a simple index of other web pages, on September 8, 2008, Google News began to offer indexed content from scanned newspapers. The depth of chronological coverage varies. Since 2008, the entire content of The New York Times back to its founding in 1851 has been available. Newspapers were thought to have escaped copyright obligations of news articles because of Google's method of publishing the archives as searchable image files of the actual newspaper pages, rather than as pure text of articles. In 2011, Google announced that it would no longer add content to the archive project. On August 14, 2011, without notice, Google made the News Archives home page unavailable. Apparently, the service merged with Google News.\\"Google Integrates News Archive Search Into Current News Search, Weakens Archive Search\\". Internet for Lawyers Carly Carlioi, an editor at the Boston Phoenix, speculated that Google discontinued the project because they found it harder than expected, for newspapers were more difficult to index than books because of layout complexities. Another cause might have been that the project attracted a lesser audience than expected. While archived newspapers are still available for browsing, keyword searching is not fully functional. On December 16, 2013, Google News employee Stacie Chan wrote in the Google Product Forums that Google News is \\"performing a much needed facelift on our News Archive search function\\", and that access to archived stories would be limited for several months while \\"this new system\\" is being built. This was reaffirmed on May 22 and July 30, 2014, when Chan wrote that Google is still \\"working on the archives to provide a better user experience\\", and \\"it's in the works\\", and again on December 18, 2014, when Chan wrote that Google \\"is currently working on creating a better experience on the Newspaper Archives that should be available in the near future.\\" Some papers formerly included in the News Archive have been removed because of copyright issues. For instance, the archives of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel disappeared on August 16, 2016, due to a contract between the paper's owner, the Gannett Company, and NewsBank.

History The company was set up as a U.S. subsidiary of Kino Precision Industries Limited, Tokyo, Japan and registered as a trademark on Jan 25 1980,TradeMark registration - http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry;=73247563 in order to market manually focused film camera optical lenses to the United States. Kino Precision was founded in 1959 by Tatsuo Kataoka to manufacture lenses for 8mm movie cameras. A Kiron-made Vivitar 70-210mm f/3.5 Series 1 Originally, Kino Precision manufactured some of the now-famous Series 1 manual focus lenses under contract for Vivitar, a U.S. lens distributor of after-market film lenses for 35mm cameras. However, after the positive reception from consumers on Vivitar Series 1 lenses, and as Vivitar was using other Japanese lens manufacturers to produce Vivitar brand lenses, the company believed the time was right to successfully market lenses to fit existing 35mm Japanese film cameras under their own brand, Kiron. Kiron soon became known as one of the very few after-market lens manufacturers that could supply products equal to or even exceeding the optical and mechanical quality of the original manufacturer. In particular, the Kiron 28mm/2.0, the 105mm/2.8 1:1 macro,'Zes Maal Rond De 100mm, FOTO (March 1985) pp. 16-20: In a review of 100mm focal length macro lenses, FOTO found the Kiron 105/2.8 macro outperformed both the Micro Nikkor 105mm/2.8 AIS and Tokina 90mm/2.5 macro lenses. the 28-210mm/4.0-5.6 and the 3.8-5.6 varifocal zoom, and the 28-85mm/2.8-3.8 varifocal macro zoom lenses were praised in contemporary reviews of the day for their superb optical resolution and clarity, as well as mechanical quality.Modern Photography, Kiron 28-85mm Varifocal Macro Zoom Review, March 1981: As one example, the 28-85mm varifocal was tested by Modern Photography, which reported 34 out of 36 excellent ratings for center and corner sharpness at 28, 50, and 85mm (the two holdouts were both 'very good'). Contrast rated as all highs at 28mm, all but one high at 50mm, and mostly high at 85mm.Keppler, Herbert, Super Stretch Zooms, Do you Lose Picture Quality?, Modern Photography (June 1986), pp. 34-35,74Shutterfinger, A Look Back At Lenses, 11 April 2009 Although reasonably priced for the level of quality offered, Kiron manual focus lenses were never economy-level products, and were always made and assembled in Japan.Ortner, Everett H., Through The Viewfinder: All-Range Zoom, Popular Science (April 1981), pp. 26-28: The 1981 price for the Kiron 28-85/2.8-3.8 zoom was $449 - $1,060.00 in 2009 dollars. As such, Kiron lenses produced during the 1980s were normally priced only slightly below lenses offered by the camera manufacturers themselves. Later, Vivitar itself would purchase some Kiron/Kino lens designs, (such as the Kiron 105mm f/2.8 macro lens, re-labeled as the Vivitar 100mm f/2.8 macro and the Vivitar 105mm/2.5 (1:1) macro lenses), and offered them for sale under the Vivitar brand. They begin with the serial number 22XXXXXX. The increasing cost of quality lens manufacture in Japan led to a loss of sales for Kiron, as the company could no longer offer its lenses at a cost less than that charged by the camera manufacturers, who had begun to offer economy-level lens designs as well as contracting lens assembly operations in lower-cost factories outside Japan. Additionally, the 35mm camera market was in flux by the late 1980s, and 35mm camera manufacturers were transitioning to autofocus lens designs. By 1988, the company decided to discontinue after-market 35mm camera lens production to concentrate on industrial and other markets. In 1989 Kino Precision Industries merged with 'Melles Griot Japan' to form 'Kino-Melles Griot'. In 1995 the firm has changed its name to 'Melles Griot Ltd', and subsequently became a member of CVI Melles Griot Group in 2007. In June 2011 Illinois-based IDEX Corporation completed its $400 million acquisition of the laser and optical component maker CVI Melles Griot from its previous owner, the private equity firm Norwest Equity Partners.IDEX completes takeover of CVI Melles Griot http://optics.org/news/2/6/14 Types Lenses for 35 mm film cameras: * 24mm 1:2.0 * 28mm 1:2.0 * 28mm 1:2.8 * 28‚Äì70mm 1:3.5‚Äì4.5 (two versions) * 28‚Äì70mm 1:4.0 * 28‚Äì85mm 1:2.8‚Äì3.8 varifocal macro zoom (aka \\"The Stovepipe\\") * 28‚Äì105mm 1:3.2‚Äì4.5 (two versions) varifocal zoom * 28-210mm 1:3.8-5.6 varifocal zoom (14 elements/11 groups) * 28‚Äì210mm 1:4.0‚Äì5.6 varifocal zoom (14 elements/11 groups) * 30‚Äì80mm 1:3.5‚Äì4.5 varifocal zoom * 35‚Äì135mm 1:3.5‚Äì4.5 varifocal zoom * 105mm 1:2.8 (macro 1:1)(6 elements/6 groups) * 70‚Äì150mm 1:4.0 * 70‚Äì210mm 1:4.0 (two versions) * 70‚Äì210mm 1:4.5 * 80‚Äì200mm 1:4.0 * 80‚Äì200mm 1:4.5 (six versions) Lenses were made in the following lens mounts: * Canon FD * Konica AR * Minolta SR * Nikon F AI and AI-S * Olympus OM * Rolleiflex QBM * Pentax K and KA * Contax/Yashica Not part of the original range but some lenses (28-210 and 70-210mm f/4.5) were also made available in M42 lens mount in the late 1980s.

It is not being used in Indian music. There is a raga 'Majh Khamaj' in Hindustani Sangeet, but it does not resemble Asa of Gurmat Sangeet. Gurmat Sangeet is a musicology of Sikh Sacred Music, used in the Sikh holy scripture the Guru Granth Sahib. The ragas used by Sikh Gurus for Gurbani are known as Gurmat Sangeet. It is popular in the Sikh tradition from northern India and is part of daily prayers being conducted in Sikh Gurdwaras. Every raga has a strict set of rules which govern the number of notes that can be used; which notes can be used; and their interplay that has to be adhered to for the composition of a tune. In the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy Granth (book) there are 60 Ragas of equal and independent status. Numerous Shabad Reet compositions on the base of these ragas are popular in the tradition. The Gurbani hymns under raga Asa appear in Sri Guru Granth Sahib first at page no. 8. Aasaa has strong emotions of inspiration and courage. This Raag gives the listener the determination and ambition to put aside any excuses and to proceed with the necessary action to achieve the aim. It generates feelings of passion and zeal to succeed and the energy generated from these feelings enables the listener to find the strength from within to achieve success, even when the achievement seems difficult. The determined mood of this Raag ensures that failure is not an option and motivates the listener to be inspired. Asa is five centuries old raga. It is introduced in classical singing styles of Gurmat Sangeet by Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of Sikhism. The raga is originated from popular folk tunes of Punjab (northern India). Raga Asa belongs to Bilawal Thaat. Asa was used by Guru Nanak, Guru Angad, Guru Amar Das, Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan and Guru Tegh Bahadur. The following represents the order of notes that can be used on the ascending and descending phase of the composition and the primary and secondary notes. * Aroh: * Avroh: * Vadi: Ma * Samvadi: Sa * Thaat : Bilaval * Jaati : Audava - Sampurna * Resting notes : Avroha ga , ni * Time : Evening Asa is a crooked (vakra) raga in that approaches to certain notes have to be made from a set position. Its variants as given in the Guru Granth Sahib are Kafi and Asavari, both of which have many features in common with Asa.

It is the administrative center of Horodok Raion. Population: . History Horodok was first mentioned by Nestor the Chronicler in the Primary Chronicle. The Galician‚ÄìVolhynian Chronicle mentions that the King Daniel of Galicia came to Horodok with his forces to join Mstislav Mstislavich the Bold while they fought with Polish-Hungarians over the Galician land. In the mid-14th century, together with whole Kingdom of Rus, the settlement was annexed by the Kingdom of Poland. Its name was changed to Gr√≥dek, and it remained in Poland for the next 400 years. In 1372, King Jagiello founded here a Roman Catholic parish. During this reign, Gr√≥dek also received Magdeburg rights. This was the place where King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Jagiello died on 1 June 1434. Until the Partitions of Poland, Gr√≥dek was part of Ruthenian Voivodeship. A battle between Ukrainian Cossack and Polish forces took place here in 1655 (see Battle of Horodok (1655)), in which Ukrainian Cossack Bohdan Khmelnytsky defeated Polish forces and than laid siege to Lviv. In 1772, Gr√≥dek was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, as part of Austrian Galicia, where it remained until late 1918. German-speaking settlers established their own colony, called Vorderberg (1788). Austrian authorities closed local Franciscan monastery, turning it into a military depot. In 1903, a monument to Wladyslaw Jagiello was unveiled here, and in 1906, the name of the town was changed from Gr√≥dek to Gr√≥dek Jagiello≈Ñski, in honour of the king. During World War I, Horodok was twice the location of fierce battles: In the Battle of Gr√≥dek (1914), the advancing Russian army captured the town from Austria-Hungary, and a year later, a combined German and Austro-Hungarian force fought the Russians in the Battle of Gr√≥dek (1915). In the Second Polish Republic, Gr√≥dek was the seat of a county in Lwow Voivodeship. The town had three Roman Catholic churches, one Greek-Catholic, and a synagogue. It also was a military garrison, where a unit of Polish Army‚Äôs 5th Infantry Division was stationed. According to the 1921 census, Poles made 72% of the population, Ukrainians 26%, and Jews 2%. During the Invasion of Poland, Gr√≥dek was captured by the Wehrmacht on 13 September 1939, and later taken over by the Red Army. It was then recaptured by the Germans in 1941. At this time, the Jewish population of Gr√≥dek was approximately 5,000 people, or 800 families. During the summer of 1942, approximately half of the Jews in Gr√≥dek were murdered by the Nazis assisted, in some cases, by their Ukrainian auxiliaries. The remainder were shot and buried in mass graves on 3 February 1943 in the final liquidation of the Jewish ghetto in the town. Only a few Jews survived the war. From 1945‚Äì1991, Gr√≥dek was a part of the Soviet Union, and returned to its historical name of Horodok (–ì–æ—Ä–æ–¥–æ–∫). Since 1991 it has been part of Ukraine.

Biography Little is known about Fei Xin's life. His family originated from Kunshan, in today's Jiangsu Province. Based on other dates mentioned by him, it is likely that he was born in the 17th year of the Hongwu era (1385), although some authors' calculation give 1388 as the date of his birth. He taught himself the Arabic language. According to what Fei Xin says in the preface to his book, his family was poor. His older brother was called up to serve at the nearby Taicang garrison, but soon died, and young Fei Xin took his place, in or after 1398. J.J.L. Duyvendak speculated that the Fei brothers had been conscripted as a punishment for some political or other offense of their father or grandfather; there is no actual proof of that, but Fei Xin's later biographer, Roderich Ptak, thought that that wasn't impossible. While a soldier, he managed to find time for study. Taicang being the lower-Yangtze base of the Zheng He fleet, Fei Xin ended up sailing with the fleet to the South-East Asia and the Indian Ocean four times. Fei Xin is primarily known as the author of the book Xingcha Shenglan (Description of the Starry Raft; preface dated 1436), in which he recorded what he had seen on his 4 voyages to the southern seas. There are no known mentions of his activities at later dates than 1436, and there is no information about the actual date of his death either. According to Ptak, there is no reliable information about Fei Xin's religion. Ptak believes that it is unlikely that Fei Xin was a Muslim, like Ma Huan or Zheng He himself. Fei Xin did conclude his book with the description of Mecca, but this may have been just an emulation of Ma Huan's book's layout. Fei Xin's book exists in a number of different Ming-era editions. It has been studied by many Chinese and foreign historians. The first English translation of his book was made by William Woodville Rockhill, and published in the T'oung Pao in 1914-1915.Rockhill's work, covering also numerous other sources, appeared in several installments. One of them is this: W. W. Rockhill, Notes on the Relations and Trade of China with the Eastern Archipelago and the Coast of the Indian Ocean during the Fourteenth Century. Part II. T'oung Pao, Second Series, Vol. 16, No. 1 (Mar., 1915), pp. 61-159 The most recent translation, based on a draft by J.V.G. Mills, was edited and annotated by Roderich Ptak (1996).

Born in Urlingford, County Kilkenny, Fogarty first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-one when he first linked up with the Kilkenny intermediate team, before later joining the under-21 side. He joined the senior panel during the 2003 championship. Fogarty quickly became a regular member of the starting fifteen, and won five All-Ireland medals, four Leinster medals and three National League medals on the field of play. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Fogarty won three Railway Cup medals. At club level he has won one junior championship medal with Emeralds. Throughout his career Fogarty made 38 championship appearances. He announced his retirement from inter-county hurling on 26 November 2014. In 2020, Fogarty appeared on the fourth season of the Irish edition of Dancing with the Stars. Playing career Club In 2000 Fogarty was in his last year with the Emeralds minor hurling team when he played in the championship decider. A 1-12 to 0-7 defeat of Shamrocks gave him a championship medal. The following year Fogarty had established himself on Emeralds top team. A 3-11 to 1-11 defeat of Windgap in the junior decider gave him a championship medal in that grade. Under-21 and intermediate Fogarty first played for Kilkenny in 2003 when he joined the under-21 side. He won his sole Leinster medal that year following a 0-12 to 1-4 defeat of Dublin. Kilkenny later faced Galway in the All-Ireland decider, beating them with on a scoreline of 2-13 to 0-12, and giving Fogarty an All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship medal. That same year Fogarty was a member of the Kilkenny intermediate team. He won a Leinster medal that year following a 4-20 to 1-10 win over Dublin in the decider. Kilkenny were later beaten 1-21 to 0-23 by Cork in the All-Ireland decider. Senior =Beginnings= Fogarty was still eligible for the under-21 grade when he was added to the Kilkenny senior panel in 2003. That year he shared in his county's National Hurling League, Leinster and All-Ireland triumphs, however, Fogarty was yet to make his debut. On 13 June 2004, Fogarty made his senior championship debut when he was introduced as a substitute in a 2-15 to 1-16 Leinster semi-final defeat by Wexford. Kilkenny were later defeated by Cork in the All-Ireland decider, however, Fogarty remained on the bench for that 0-17 to 0-9 loss. =Four-in-a-row= In 2006 Fogarty won his first National League medal on the field of play following a 3‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì14 victory over Limerick. On 3 September 2006 Kilkenny faced a Cork team who were presented with the opportunity to become the first side in nearly thirty years to secure three successive All-Ireland championships. Like previous encounters neither side took a considerable lead, however, Kilkenny had a vital goal from Fogarty. Cork were in arrears coming into the final few minutes, however, Ben O'Connor scored a late goal for Cork. It was too little too late as the Cats denied Cork on a score line of 1-16 to 1-13. Fogarty collected his first All-Ireland medal on the field of play. He was later named man of the match. On 2 September 2007 Kilkenny faced defeated Munster finalists and surprise All- Ireland semi-final winners Limerick in the championship decider. Kilkenny got off to a flying start with Eddie Brennan and Henry Shefflin scoring two goals within the first ten minutes to set the tone. Limerick launched a second-half comeback, however, \\"the Cats\\" were too powerful and cruised to a 2-19 to 1-15 victory. It was Fogarty's second All-Ireland medal. Kilkenny secured the Leinster crown in 2008, with Fogarty collecting a first winner's medal on the field of play following a 5-21 to 0-17 defeat of Wexford. On 8 September 2008 Kilkenny faced Waterford in the All-Ireland decider for the first time in forty-five years. In a disappointingly one-sided final, Kilkenny produced a near perfect seventy minutes as Waterford endured a nightmare afternoon. A 23-point winning margin, 3-24 from play, only two wides in the entire match and eight scorers in all with Eddie Brennan and Henry Shefflin leading the way in a 3-30 to 1-13 victory. It was Fogarty's third All-Ireland medal. Fogarty collected a second National League medal in 2009, as Kilkenny beat Tipperary by 2-26 to 4-17 with a thrilling extra-time victory. He later won a second successive Leinster medal, as new challengers Dublin were bested by 2-18 to 0-18. On 6 September Kilkenny were poised to become the second team ever in the history of hurling to win four successive All-Ireland championships when they faced Tipperary in the decider. For long periods Tipp looked the likely winners, however, late goals from Henry Shefflin and substitute Martin Comerford finally killed off their efforts to secure a 2-22 to 0-23 victory. Fogarty had collected his fourth All-Ireland medal. =Continued dominance= In 2010 Kilkenny defeated Galway in an eagerly-anticipated but ultimately disappointing provincial decider. A 1-19 to 1-12 victory gave Fogarty a third Leinster medal. The drive for a fifth successive All-Ireland crown reached a head on 5 September 2010, when Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland decider. \\"The Cats\\" lost talisman Henry Shefflin due to injury, while Tipperary's Lar Corbett ran riot and scored a hat-trick of goals as Fogarty's side fell to a 4-17 to 1-18 defeat. After seeing little action in 2011, Fogarty returned to championship action the following year. Kilkenny, however, were shocked by Galway in the Leinster decider, losing by 2-21 to 2-11, however, both sides subsequently met in the All-Ireland decider on 9 September 2012. Kilkenny had led going into the final stretch, however, Joe Canning struck a stoppage time equaliser to level the game at 2-13 to 0-19 and send the final to a replay for the first time since 1959. The replay took place three weeks later on 30 September 2012. Galway stunned the reigning champions with two first-half goals, however, Kilkenny's championship debutant Walter Walsh gave a man of the match performance, claiming a 1-3 haul. The 3-22 to 3-11 Kilkenny victory gave Fogarty a fifth All-Ireland medal. =Decline= Kilkenny's dominance showed no sign of abating in 2013, with Fogarty winning a third National League medal following a 2-17 to 0-20 defeat of Tipperary in the decider. In 2014 Fogarty won his fourth Leinster medal as Kilkenny dethroned reigning champions Dublin by 0-24 to 1-9. Fogarty played a bit part in Kilkenny's subsequent All-Ireland campaign, however, he collected an eighth All-Ireland medal, his third as a non-playing substitute, following a 2-17 to 2-14 defeat of Tipperary in the decider. On 26 November 2014 Fogarty announced his retirement from inter-county hurling. Inter-provincial In 2006 Fogarty was picked for the Leinster team that faced Connacht in the inter-provincial final. A disappointing contest resulted in a 1-23 to 0-17 victory for Leinster, and a first Railway Cup medal for Fogarty. After surrendering their title the following year, Leinster were back in the decider once again in 2008. Richie Power top-scored with nine points as Leinster secured a 1-15 to 1-12 victory. It was Fogarty's second Railway Cup medal. Leinster made it two in a row in 2009, with Fogarty collecting his third winner's medal as Leinster defeated Connacht by 3-18 to 1-17.

Every raga has a strict set of rules which govern the number of notes that can be used; which notes can be used; and their interplay that has to be adhered to for the composition of a tune. In the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy Granth (book) there are a total of 31 raga compositions and this raga is the ninth raga to appear in the series. The composition in this raga appear on a total of only 2 pages from page numbers 719 to 721. This raga appears in the Ragmala as the first ragini (\\"subset\\") of Sri raga. In the Mesakarna Ragmala (1509), which is almost the same as that of the Guru Granth Sahib, the first ragini of Siri Raga is given as Vairati. However, modern sources do not give Bairari nor Vairati but Barari and Varari as well as Varati are listed. Kaufmann believes that all of these names refer to the same raga, Barari. Whether this is the same as the old Bairari is open to question. The possibility always exists that Bairari was a regional tune. It was used by Guru Ram Das for six short hymns and by Guru Arjan for one. This raga is performed during the evening and it is currently assigned to the Marva thata (\\"set\\"). It resembles Purva Kalyan, the main difference being the use of Pa which is strong in Bairari and weak in Purva- Kalyan. Popley places Bairari in the same group as Sri Raga and this would agree with the Ragmala.

Population  The total population is 13 192 people.  Transport  The Kozyatin-Zhashkiv railway passes through the city, there are two railway stations: Tetiiv and Sloboda Post (in the western part of the city - ‚Äúon Sloboda‚Äù, across the river). Tetiiv station is a big one, there is a big hall and a ticket office. There is a bus station.  Svejkovskiy Chapel  At the beginning of the 19th century, a stone church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary was building in Tetiiv. A chapel was erecting next to the church, which later served as a family tomb for the Svejkovskiy family. The chapel today has been preserving in good condition and is an architectural monument of national importance. On March 11, 2006, the Catholics of Tetiiv received the keys to the chapel. The chapel is building in antique style. In front of the entrance is a four-column ionic portico with an inscription in Polish ‚ÄúTym ktorzy zmartwychwstana‚Äù (‚ÄúFor those who rise from the dead‚Äù) and a triangular pediment with a cross. Above the wrought-iron doors there is a coat of arms and an inscription in Polish, the inscription ‚ÄúCoffins of the Svejkovskiy family‚Äù. The chapel is all that remains of the Tetiiv Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which in Soviet times converted into a club, then to the house of pioneers, and eventually became the factory floor of the Electronmash factory. The chapel in those days served as a composition for the plant.  The remains of the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary  Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary composed in the 20s of the XIX century on the site of an ancient wooden. The decoration of the church was a granite sculpture of St. Jan Nepomutskiy, and the letters N.P.M. Although, according to the Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland, it is stated that ... \\"Latins have in Tetiiv their church a stone parish named after St. John of Nepomucen, Build in the current century (XIX).\\" In Soviet times, the church became part of the Electronmash factory. Despite this fact, the architectural elements of the church are well preserved, it makes it possible to restore it and the city can receive an architectural monument with a two hundred year history.  Monument to Magdeburg Law  The monument was erecting on May 2, 2016 in a city park in honor of the 410 anniversary of the receipt by Tetiiv of the privilege of self-government under Magdeburg Law.  Memorial sign on the site of the Tetiiv city hall  The commemorative sign installed on May 2, 2016 in a city park on the spot where at the beginning of the 17th century. The Tetiiv City Hall was build. The City Hall was an indispensable condition for the city to receive self-government under Magdeburg Law, and for 400 years the most significant historical events for the city took place within its walls. On May 13 and 14, the last king of Poland, Stanislav Augustus, stayed in Tetiiv, including a visit to the Tetiiv Town Hall. During his campaign in Volyn, the hetman Bogdan Khmelnitsky spoke to the residents of Tetiiv from the balcony of the Tetiiv Town Hall.  Barrow \\"Red Grave\\"  Four mounds have been preserving near Tetiiv since those ancient times, but only two of them have names: ‚ÄúRed Grave‚Äù and ‚ÄúGreen Tavern‚Äù. The area of the mound \\"Red Grave\\" is the oldest place of Tetiiv, the site of the oldest burial place of the city residents. The local historian described the legend according to which in the old days the city of Timoshnia stood on the site of Tetiiv. This city was not yet Christian. Timoshnia destroyed, but the inhabitants managed to bury their treasures near the grave, which in the 19th century called Red. In 1830, a large treasure founded next to the grave, consisting of coins in the form of fish scales and grain.   Mill \\"Porhun\\"  German colonists built a water brick mill, as well as a dam with two bridges, in 1812. This area was called Porhun because the water fluttered in the spring, that is, it was noisy.

He first appeared in Devil May Cry 4 in 2008 as the primary protagonist. Nero, a teenager who works for the Order of the Sword, uses demonic powers inherited from Sparda to hunt enemies. In Devil May Cry 4 he meets Dante, a demon hunter and the series' primary protagonist, to whom he learns he is related. Nero returns as the primary protagonist in Devil May Cry 5 to fight the demon king Urizen, a new threat. He has also appeared in printed media related to these two games. Nero was created by Bingo Morihashi and designed by Tatsuya Yoshikawa, who wanted to distinguish him from the veteran series protagonist Dante. The character was redesigned for Devil May Cry 5 to indicate his relationship to Dante's father (Sparda) and brother (Vergil) with physical similarities. Nero is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch in English and Kaito Ishikawa in Japanese. Director Hideaki Itsuno aimed to make Nero stand out within the narrative despite being younger than most characters and thus would acquire new powers in the process. Critical reception has been mainly positive; game journalists found that although fans would miss playing as Dante during Nero's debut, his personality and abilities would be equally appealing. His new look and actions in the sequel, Devil May Cry 5, have also been praised by critics that helped to distinguish him from the other playable characters. Creation and concept Nero was named after the Roman emperor. Nero was created by the Capcom staff as a new protagonist who would develop across the Devil May Cry series because Dante had become stronger with each game. Originally a weak character, he develops new powers (primarily through his Devil Bringer ability) until he reaches Dante's level. Nero was also introduced to attract new gamers to the franchise. The Devil Bringer was originally intended to be part of Dante's mechanics, but the staff found that the games would be more interesting if a character who cannot transform into a demon develops a demonic arm. During their development, Capcom wanted to keep Nero's characteristics (except for Kyrie being his love interest) secret. Bingo Morihashi was inspired to write Nero's story by manga artist Ramo Nakajima in the Amagasaki City series: \\"I love you, so I protect the city you love\\". Love is the focus of the Devil May Cry series, and Devil May Cry 4 focuses on Nero's love for Kyrie. The staff were satisfied with Morihashi's simple story, similar to Hollywood films about a damsel in distress. Fearing negative feedback similar to what followed the replacement of protagonist Solid Snake by newcomer Raiden in Konami's stealth game Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi said that Capcom intended to make Nero fun to play compared with Dante and the team aimed to make him stronger. Kobayashi described Nero as \\"characteristically wild, quite immature, young, and very passionate ... kind of a rebel.\\" Capcom originally planned to name their new character after the French sculptor Auguste Rodin, who created The Gates of Hell from Dante Alighieri's Inferno, and the work makes demons spawn in the human world in Devil May Cry 4. However, the team later wanted a simpler name (similar to Dante and Vergil). Writer Morihashi Bingo persuaded the staff to use the name of the Roman emperor; according to Bingo, the similarities between Nero and the name of Vergil's alter ego (Nelo Angelo) were coincidental and there is no connection between the characters. Most of Nero's moves were named after casino terms, which Morihashi thought would suit the character's personality. In Devil May Cry 5, Nero's gameplay emphasizes his anger at how Dante first treats him. The game's climax, where Nero awakens his demonic powers and ends the struggle between Dante and Vergil, was meant to give the story depth. Nero's new powers' availability near the game's end intended to enhance its replay value and emphasize the power Nero needs to face Vergil; he could not defeat his alter ego, Urizen, at the beginning of the game. Itsuno claimed that while Dante and V get power ups in Devil May Cry 5 during mid areas of the game, which he finds common in gaming, he wanted Nero to awake these powers for the final fight. Nero's relationship with Dante and Vergil was inspired by a mecha anime Itsuno watched as a child. Vergil was based on the protagonist's missing father who makes a sudden appearance with a giant robot that targets his family: Nero and Dante. Design Nero's Devil May Cry 4 appearance was ambiguous, resembling Sparda's twin sons. Nero was designed by Tatsuya Yoshikawa, who researched the entire Devil May Cry series. Yoshikawa was satisfied with Nero's appearance, believing that he fits the series' world. Nero's appearance underwent several changes during the development of Devil May Cry 4; although early designs looked more like Vergil, the final design resembled Dante. Capcom wanted to balance the traits of Nero and Dante, the game's two playable characters. Nero was created to be weak due to his youth, and Dante seems more experienced; existing fans would prefer playing Dante. Capcom had planned another Devil May Cry game, in which Nero would return and might team up with Dante, but first wanted to see fan response to Devil May Cry 4. Yoshikawa also created the , another devil transformation, for Nero. Unlike Dante's transformation (which makes him look like a devil), Nero's Devil Trigger generates a creature behind his back. One prototype (which did not appear in the game) turned Nero into a demon like Dante, with his hood covering one eye. Nero's redesign for Devil May Cry 5 was intended to contrast with Dante's older look. Since Nero's name means \\"black\\" in Italian, he was given black clothing. Capcom used an older incarnation of Nero, so he would be \\"at the top of his game in body and mind\\". Because the game's graphics are meant to be as realistic as possible, Nero's face was modeled on actor Karlo Baker. Fans wondered if Nero was related to Dante or Vergil, as in Devil May Cry 4. Nero is said to be a descendant of Sparda (Dante and Vergil's father) based on their similarities and the Devil Trigger, Nero's power-up which makes him resemble Vergil's devil form. In June 2018, Capcom said that Nero is Vergil's son. Capcom replaced Nero's Devil Bringer with the Devil Breaker, a prosthetic arm useful in combat. Purchasers of the Devil May Cry 5 deluxe edition received four Devil Breaker weapons for Nero, including a Mega Buster based on Mega Man 11. Voice actors Johnny Yong Bosch voiced Nero. Nero was voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch, who enjoyed playing Ichigo Kurosaki from Bleach and Vash the Stampede from Trigun but considers Nero his favorite. He went to Japan to do the character's motion capture. Before his debut, Bosch was familiar with the series, having played the first Devil May Cry. While he enjoyed Dante's character, he wanted Nero to be different personalitywise despite his similar physical appearances. As a result, he considers Nero as a character he relates due to how close he was to the role. Bosch is also in charge of doing the motion capture which he oirginally challenging back in his debut due to some overthetop actions the stunt had to make. The voiceover had to be redone during the making of the game. Although Devil May Cry 5 is a sequel, Bosch did three auditions to reprise his roles due to the large time the game took to be made. In regards to Nero's bloodline, Bosch found that Devil May Cry 4 made it obvious that Nero was Vergil's son but still look forward to how their relationship would be explored in the sequel. In the Japanese version of Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition (an updated version of Devil May Cry 4), Nero was voiced by Kaito Ishikawa. Although Ishikawa tried to follow Bosch's work when dubbing the character to understand Nero's personality, he found it difficult because he did not know English. He had no previous experience with the series before working on Special Edition, but was encouraged by his friends. Ishikawa met Dante's Japanese voice actor, Toshiyuki Morikawa, during recording; they interacted many times, and Morikawa helped him understand the franchise. Ishikawa understood the game better as he worked because it was translated into Japanese (which might attract more fans), and he appreciated the experience. He described Nero as a character who encompasses the universal \\"naughty young boy\\". Nero's interactions with enemies differ significantly from Dante's, and Ishikawa believed that Nero is taking his own path rather than following Dante's. He enjoyed the relationship between the two characters, which he brought into recording the game. Nero tries to act stylishly when facing his enemies (unlike Dante), and Ishikawa noted Morikawa's work. Appearances In the fourth installment of the Devil May Cry series, Nero is injured protecting his childhood friend Kyrie from a pack of demons. At a later mass at the Order of the Sword, Nero's injured arm becomes the Devil Bringer when Kyrie is endangered. With a lone-wolf reputation, Nero is given a mission to find and capture Dante. He learns that the influx of demons on the island was arranged by Sanctus, who was resurrected as a demon by Order scientist Agnus. Nero is revealed as Sparda's descendant, convincing Sanctus to use Kyrie as bait to force Nero to assume the role he intended for Dante. Dante sabotages Sanctus's plans, freeing Nero so he can save Kyrie and destroy Sanctus and the Savior. Nero parts on good terms with Dante, who convinces him to keep Yamato. A Devil May Cry 4 novel by Bingo Morihashi expands Nero's background. Found as an infant in Fortuna, he is bullied by other children who call his mother a prostitute. Nero is taken in by Credo and Kyrie's family and later joins the Order of the Sword, often working alone to defeat demons. Dante says that he has fun with Nero because he reminds him of his brother, Vergil, although he cannot understand why. In Devil May Cry 5, Nero has started a mobile branch of Dante's Devil May Cry business to provide for Kyrie and working with Agnus' daughter Nico. His life is uprooted when a mysterious figure rips his Devil Bringer arm off for the Yamato. Nero is outfitted with the prosthetic Devil Breaker arm and pursues the figure to Red Grave City, where he rejoins Dante and meets the mysterious V. It is revealed that V and Urizen are splintered halves of Vergil, who took Nero's arm and is his father. Nero decides to stop the brothers' fight, and overpowers Vergil with his awakened Devil Trigger. This convinces Dante and Vergil to entrust him with the world's safety, and they trap themselves in the Underworld to destroy the Qliphoth and end the chaos caused by Urizen. The light novel Devil May Cry 5 Before the Nightmare explores the character's actions between his appearances. Nero was scheduled to appear in the fighting game Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, but did not due to time constraints. He is mentioned in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 by Deadpool, interacting with Dante. In Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Vergil has a color scheme based on Nero in DMC4. In Street Fighter V, Nero is an alternate design for Ed. Nero was added to Teppen as a playable character in October 2019 as part of its \\"The Devils Awaken\\" expansion, he was initially announced during the 2019 Tokyo Game Show. Reception A statue of Nero, used to promote Devil May Cry 5 Nero has received mainly-positive reviews from video-game critics. Since his introduction in a game demo, a GameSpot reviewer felt that the character would appeal to series fans (although Dante remained more popular). Dante's replacement with Nero as the new main character was controversial; a GameAxis Unwired reviewer expected him to play similarly to Dante, and his Devil Bringer would satisfy newcomers. Nero's gameplay style was praised by IGN, which said that he \\"strike[s] the right tone of gravity and sarcasm\\". Capsulecomputers.com called Nero \\"our anti-hero with a heart\\", and enjoyed the character's mechanics as much as Dante's. Finding Nero a likable character, a GameSpot reviewer said that players would be pleased with the switch between Nero and Dante as Devil May Cry 4 progressed. Den of Geek noted that although Nero's debut might have surprised fans of Dante, his combined similar appearance and distinctive style might appeal to them. GameSpy described his combat: \\"He has a fuel injector built in, so that he can 'rev' up his blade for charged attacks\\". USgamer noted that despite Nero's being one of Special Edition easiest characters to use, his combat still provided depth and defeating the bosses was more challenging with Nero than with Dante. Noting the similarities between Nero and Dante, Metro said that Nero's other skills (his swordsmanship and the Devil Bringer) made him unique. IGN ranked the Devil Bringer the ninth-best weapon in the Devil May Cry series, since Nero could attack any type of enemy with his arm. A Dual Shockers reviewer enjoyed Nero's combat, which added depth to the series because it differed from Dante's. The website, however, found Nero's story unappealing. Capcom said that it would not make a bad protagonist like that in Metal Gear Solid 2. GameZone found Nero's actions and powers likable. Game Informer agreed with GameZone that Nero is as likable as Dante because he \\"lives up to his legacy\\". Edge was critical of his replacement of Dante, comparing Nero to the unlikable God of War protagonist Kratos. Although it found Nero's improvements in abilities less enjoyable, Edge said that players would find Dante more appealing as the story progressed. In his book, 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die, Tony Mott wrote that the change to Nero from Dante was an appeal to new arrivals at the franchise. Nero performed simpler moves than Dante, with whom players might have become bored; sales of the series were falling. Mott's book called Nero a \\"dead ringer\\", with moves similar to those of Kratos. Bosch's portrayal of Nero in the English-language version was praised by GameZone; GameSpot agreed, saying that Bosch's \\"superb acting makes for one of the most appealing new game characters to be introduced in some time\\". Reaction to Nero's role in Devil May Cry 5 has been mainly positive. GamesRadar found his engagement of demons in the Devil May Cry 5 trailer appealing. Metro also enjoyed his actions in the trailer and joked about Nero's new look, while VG247 found him too different from his Devil May Cry 4 persona. IGN criticized Nero's appearance in Devil May Cry 5, comparing it and the redesigned version of Dante by Ninja Theory as a failed attempt to appeal to gamers during the 2018 Electronic Entertainment Expo. According to Capcom's Michiteru Okabe, gamer response to Nero's new appearance was positive. Despite a confusing scene in the trailer in which Vergil apparently cuts Nero's arm, Kotaku looked forward to the return of the main characters Dante, Vergil and Nero. Another Kokatu writer praised Nero's new costume and his metallic arm. A Daily Star reviewer found Nero likable and reminiscent of Spider-Man. Destructoid liked Vergil's impact on Dante and Nero as his brother and son take it upon themselves to halt the threat to their relative. USgamer compared Dante's relationship with Nero to that of father and son, but found Dante's treatment of the younger demon hunter mean-spirited (although Dante later does not want Nero to face Vergil because of their actual father-son relationship). In promoting Devil May Cry 5, Capcom produced replicas of the character's jacket as limited editions for Japanese gamers. GameSpot noted how engaging Nero is to newcomers thanks to his gameplay. IGN liked Nero's new techniques provided by his mechanical arms‚Äîmost notably the one he shoots to attack enemies. EndGadget found Nero as a worthy Devil May Cry fighter due to his visual appeal and the uniqueness in his movesets.

The unit is responsible for providing policing and security for both Heathrow and London City airports.Metropolitan Police London's other airports, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton are policed by Sussex, Essex and the Bedfordshire Police respectively, as they are not located in the Metropolitan Police District. History Policing at Heathrow was initially undertaken by the Civil Aviation Authority. In 1965, the responsibility was taken over by the British Airports Authority Constabulary, which subsequently passed to the Metropolitan Police on 1 November 1974 as a consequence of the Policing of Airports Act 1974. Policing of London City Airport has always been undertaken by the Metropolitan Police, with Aviation Security acquiring the remit from local officers during 2004. Policing today The unit employs around 400 police officers, the vast majority being trained Firearms Officers. Along with carrying out routine policing, Aviation Security must always guard against terrorism and be ready to respond to an aircraft emergency. Human trafficking is another area policed, with close working relationships existing with the United Kingdom Border Force and UK Visas and Immigration. Traffic wardens and Police Community Support Officers work at both airports. In 2005 the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, announced that Specialist Operations units were to be re-aligned. The plans included forming three new departments within Specialist Operations to carry out specific functions: # Protecting People, (Splitting the functions of both SO14 & SO16 and merging them with parts of SO17, SO18 and SO12) # Protecting Places, (Splitting the functions of both SO14 & SO16 and merging them with parts of SO17 and SO18) # Counter Terrorism Command (Merging SO12 & SO13 together) Firearms commonly used for armed airport policing duties: * German Heckler & Koch MP5 A3 (Semi- Automatic Carbine) * German Heckler & Koch G36C (Semi-Automatic Carbine) * Austrian Glock 17 (Pistol) * American X26 Taser Armed Response Airport Vehicles patrol the entry and exit points to the main terminal buildings, the perimeter roads and respond to firearms calls in local boroughs. There are also armed foot patrols inside. Aviation and Roads Policing Unit (Traffic Unit) One of the key operational units within SO18 is the Aviation and Road Policing Unit. The unit is manned by a small group of traffic officers, trained in Road Collision Investigation, Traffic Law Enforcement are experienced in dealing with collisions and incidents involving vehicles around the airport. They also work alongside the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) of the Department for Transport where a vehicle may have been involved in an aircraft collision. The officers can be distinguished from their armed colleagues as they wear white caps, high visibility jackets and drive conventionally motorway marked battenburg liveried vehicles and are unarmed. They can be regularly seen on the strategic motorway network surrounding the airport, the perimeter roads and also on the terminal forecourts where, along with enforcing the road traffic regulations and assisting the free flow of vehicles, they undertake a highly visible public reassurance counter-terrorism role. This small group of highly specialised officers have led the implementation of new legislation, the Railway & Transport Safety Act to regulate drink flying offences in the UK. Seen as being particularly controversial, information about a suspected offence is normally received from either the airline or airport security personnel. Having informed police, there is a requirement that such allegations are investigated which is undertaken by these officers. Utilising special breath test devices, officers screen crews alleged of having consumed alcohol to prove or disprove the allegation. These rules relate not only to pilots, air traffic controllers, cabin crews but also to ground engineers. Penalties imposed by Courts are particularly severe although the majority of individuals who have been convicted have been foreign members of crew working for foreign carriers.

Its population was recorded at 11,964 in 2013. It is an administrative center of Myronivka Raion (district).  Geography  Myronivka is located in Central Ukraine along a river valley of Rosava River, a tributary of Ros River. The distance to Kyiv - 106 km. The city has area of . The Ukraine's capital Kyiv is approximately away from Myronivka.  History  The city traces its history to a settlement established by some Cossack or free settler Myron Zelenyi. In Ukrainian a word Zelenyi means green. A local historian Leontiy Pokhylevych in his book \\"The legends about settlements in Kyiv Governorate\\", published in 1864, wrote, \\"The village of Myronivka received its name from a free settler Myron Zelenyi. The village consisted (it is then, 130 years ago) of seven ends (kutky) or parts, the actual Myronivka where the church is, Solomakhivka, Nebytivka, Sloboda, Okolotivka, Shafranivka, Rozmarynivka ...\\" There are other legends, but in the center of each is the same name of a person Myron. Myronivka with the listed above ends was described, as it was mentioned, in 1863‚Äì64. In 1740 there were only twenty courtyards (households). In 1749 there was established a church which was opened in 1755. These words were left in his church records by the first priest of Myronivka Sava Chernyakhovsky. Among them he mentions Myron, who in his definition lived exactly where now from the modern vulytsia Buznitskoho vulytsia Chkalova begins. There is where Myronivka starts. Most recently the settlement is better known for its Zhdanov collective (kolkhoz) which for quite sometime was headed by Oleksandr Buznytskyi. Before that counts Branicki held here a private sugar factory which operated since 1858. In 1876 through the village from Fastiv was laid a railway. First public school was opened in 1869. According to Soviet propaganda almost whole Myronivka was involved in the 1905 Russian revolution. In 1911 in Myronivka was established research selection station to analyze harvest and level of sugar in sugar beets. During the World War I, one third of village population was mobilized to war leading to hardship for the rest of the settlement. In 1923 Myronivka became an administrative center of the newly created Myronivka Raion which was carved out of Kozyn and Karapyshi volosts. In 1923 the local railroad network was expanded after adding a railway branch between Myronivka and Kaharlyk. The railway hub became even more important later in 1938 when another branch to Kaniv was added. In Myronivka was also established a state farm and machine- tractor station (MTS). In the beginning of 1930s there were established two collective farms Stalin and Bilshovyk. During the 1932-1933 Holodomor 700 residents of the village died from starvation. In 1938 the population of Myronivka grew over 6,000 residents and the settlement was given the status of urban-type settlement. There were built a department store, dinners, etc. On 6 August 1941 Myronivka was occupied by the German troops after weeks of intense fighting. In the town acted several underground resistance groups supposedly led exclusively by Communists and Komsomol activists. On 31 January 1944 Myronivka was taken back by the Soviet troops of the 54th Fortified District. Over 1,200 residents of Myronivka were mobilized to the Red Army during the Nazi-Soviet War. In 1950 there was established a big collective farm the Zhdanov kolkhoz uniting Bilshovyk and Budyonnyi arteles and later the Stalin kolkhoz. In 1951 a new train station building was built. In 1968 Myronivka was granted a city status and the next year the city's sugar factory was awarded the Red Banner of the Ministry of Food Industry of the USSR. In 1985 in the city was established a memorial complex to the 40th victory anniversary in the Soviet Great Patriotic War. Economy The large produce company \\"Myronivskyi Khliboprodukt\\" (English: Myronivka Bread-Produce) has facilities in the town which include poultry production, and animal fodder. The town is home to a hospital, and is served by a train station which sees dozens of trains daily.

Teams of students from universities all over the world design and build small off-road cars. The cars all have engines of the same specifications. As of 2018 the engine has been an unmodified Briggs & Stratton Model 19 Vanguard engine single-cylinder with a displacement of 305cc and power output of approximately 10 bhp (7.5 kW). The goal in Baja SAE racing is to design, build and race off-road vehicles that can withstand the harshest elements of rough terrain. The vehicles used in Baja SAE racing are often similar in appearance to dune buggies. Before 2007, the events were called \\"Mini Baja.\\" Mini Baja race from the 2004 Mid-West Competition Picture of the Purdue University Northwest vehicle navigating a jump at the 2019 Baja Midwest event at Tennessee Tech University. Each year as many as 141 Baja cars are entered in the Baja SAE events across the US and around the world where events are held including India, China, Brazil, South Africa and Korea. In India, this event is run by SAE India. In China, this event is run by SAE China starting in 2015. All cars must adhere to SAE's rules, and pass SAE's technical inspection and judging; a car may not race until all safety inspections are passed. Small engine manufacturer Briggs & Stratton sponsors Baja SAE teams by providing the SAE sanctioned engine free of charge, at a replacement rate of one engine for every two years in competition. There are multiple dynamic events, photographed by Official SAE Photographer J.Gaines Studio, usually four per event, as well as a single four-hour endurance race. The dynamic events include hill climbs, sled pulls, maneuverability events, rock crawls, and suspension & traction events. Previously the cars had to be able to float and propel itself on water under its own power. This was changed from the 2012 competitions onward due to safety concerns. Static events, such as written reports, presentations and design evaluations are provided by participating teams. This is when the teams are judged on ergonomics, functionality, and producibility of their cars; ensuring that the final placement of the team does not rest solely on the vehicle's performance but rather on a combination of static and dynamic events. Required reports detail the engineering and design process that was used in developing each system of the team's vehicle, supported with sound engineering principles. Also, a cost report that provides all the background information necessary to verify the vehicle's actual cost is used to rate the most economically feasible for production. These reports are submitted weeks in advance of each event, where the presentations and design evaluations are given on site in the presence of SAE design judges. 3D CAD Model designed using Solidworks and CATIA V5 by the TEAM - KIIT of KIIT University, Bhubaneswar in preparation for the 2013 Baja event at Indore, India Origins The Baja SAE Competition originated at the University of South Carolina in 1976, under the supervision of Dr. Harit Mehta . Only 10 teams took part in the very first race. Since that time, the competition has grown to become a premier engineering design series with over 110 university teams participating in each race. Objectives Baja SAE is an intercollegiate engineering design competition for undergraduate and graduate engineering students. The object of the competition is to simulate real-world engineering design projects and their related challenges. Each team is competing to have its design accepted for manufacture by a fictitious firm. The students must function as a team to design, build, test, promote and compete a vehicle within the limits of the rules, also to generate financial support for their project and manage their educational priorities. Each team's goal is to design and build a prototype of a rugged, single seat, off-road recreational vehicle intended for sale to the non-professional weekend off- road enthusiast. The vehicle must be safe, easily transported, easily maintained and fun to drive. It should be able to negotiate rough terrain without damage. As of 2010, the SAE Baja Series consisted of three competitions, though in the past there have been as many as seven sanctioned events. A Baja SAE competition event consists of three to four days. Static Events The static events are usually held on the first two days of competition. Static events consist of: Technical Inspection, Cost, Design Judging, and Sales Presentation.  Technical Inspection  All vehicles competing in the race must pass through Tech Inspection. The vehicles are checked by inspectors to make sure that teams adhere to the rules and safety standards set by SAE. New for the 2015 season is a required frame pre-check. All teams must submit frame documentation and frame drawings to be approved by SAE prior to the races.  Cost Event  Teams submit a cost report before races. The cost report may consist of a maximum of three sections: Overview (optional), Costing Sheets, and Cost Documentation. The optional overview \\"is intended to give each team the opportunity to point out, and briefly comment on, any design features or fabrication processes that are innovative or are expected to result in significant cost savings. Teams may also use the overview to explain items or processes that might appear to be discrepancies within the report.\\" \\"The core of the report is the series of costing sheets. This section must contain the one-page summary sheet broken up into the individual subsystems.\\" The Cost Documentation \\"includes copies of receipts, invoices, price tags, catalog pages, online prices, or other documentation, to substantiate the costs of the parts and materials of any item costing more than $30. Cost documentation must be at full retail US prices. The use of foreign receipts, purchases from discount sites such as Craigslist, EBay or junk yards are not allowed. Starting in 2016, transponders are no longer part of the cost report and therefore no documentation for them is needed either. The report is expected to be comprehensive, well documented, truthful and accurate.\\" At the race, the ten teams with lowest cost in their cost report are then audited by an official. The official will go in depth to review the cost documents and compare them to the actual vehicle. Missing items or math errors will be added to the cost document and a penalty may be issued.  Design Judging  Design Judging is when teams have the opportunity to defend/explain the reasoning used behind designing their vehicle. Prior to the race weekend, a Design Report is submitted. This report is reviewed by the judges who will be judging the vehicle during the event. Taken from the SAE rules, \\"Students will be judged on the creation of design specifications and the ability to meet those specifications, computer aided drafting, analysis, testing and development, manufacturability, serviceability, system integration and how the vehicle works together as a whole...The vehicle that illustrates the best use of engineering to meet the design goals and the best understanding of the design by the team members will win the design event.\\"  Sales Presentation  Since the 2014 season, the sales presentation has been a standard static event at every race. The entire premise behind the Baja SAE competition is to compete for a fictitious contract to manufacture 4000 units a year. The sales presentation is pitching to a panel of \\"executives\\" of a hypothetical manufacturing company to try and convince them to purchase the team's vehicle design and can be able to give a boost to your overall performance. The presentation is limited to 10 minutes, with a 5-minute question period. \\"The presentation event will be scored based on such categories as 1\\\\. The content of the presentation 2\\\\. The organization of the presentation 3\\\\. The effectiveness of the visual aids 4\\\\. The speaker‚Äôs delivery, and 5\\\\. The team‚Äôs responses to the judge‚Äôs questions. The team‚Äôs score will be the average of the individual judge‚Äôs scores.\\" M,NBH3 Dynamic Events Dynamic Events are usually held on the final two days of competition. The first dynamic day includes the following events: Acceleration, Hill Climb or Traction Event, Maneuverability, Specialty Events (Rock Crawl, Mud Bog, and Suspension). On the second dynamic day, an endurance race is held.UMBC Racing Maneuverability run during Kansas 2014 competition Acceleration The acceleration event is a measure of a vehicle's acceleration. The event is a 30.48 m (100 ft) or 45.72 m (150 ft) straight run from a standing start. The faster the time the more points the team will score. Every team can make two attempts with the best time counting for score. Vehicles with acceleration times that are more than 1.5 times that of the fastest vehicle will not receive a score for this event. Hill Climb or Traction Event This event tests the vehicle's ability to climb an incline from a standing start or pull a designated object. Every team can make two attempts with the best time or distance counting for score. Maneuverability is designed to assess each vehicle's handling ability over typical Baja terrain. The course may consist of a variety of challenges at the organizer's option, possibly including tight turns, pylon maneuvers, ruts and bumps, drop-offs, sand, rocks, gullies, logs, and inclines. Each vehicle may make two (2) runs with the best time, including penalties, counting for score. Only vehicles that complete the maneuverability course within a time not exceeding 2.5 times that of the fastest vehicle will receive a score. There are minor and major penalties that can be given during the maneuverability event. A minor penalty is given when an obstacle/pylon is moved. A major penalty is given when a gate is missed. Missing a gate is classified as two or more wheels are outside of the gate. Every minor penalty adds 2 seconds to a vehicle's time, and every major penalty adds 10 seconds. Univ. of Oklahoma vehicle after an extremely muddy endurance race at Kansas 2018. Specialty Events Specialty Events are designed to test the vehicle under unique off-road conditions that might be available at some Baja SAE competition sites. Examples of specialty events are: Rock Crawl; Mud Bog; and Suspension. Specialty events will be announced at the time of opening of registration for a competition. Endurance Race The endurance event assesses each vehicle's ability to operate continuously and at speed over rough terrain containing obstacles in any weather conditions. Endurance may be run for either time or distance. Endurance events for time usually run for 4 hours. Endurance events for distance continue until at least one car has gone the specified distance. The starting grid for endurance will be based on each team's performance in a previous dynamic event, or set of dynamic events, to be determined by the organizer. Endurance mainly checks the working capacity of the vehicle. eBAJA eBAJA is an electric engine driven BAJA event organised by SAEINDIA. This was a new initiative introduced in 2014 on the counsel of former President of India, APJ Abdul Kalam, in order to promote greener mobility. All entries in this category run on rechargeable lithium ion batteries. Teams of students need to design and build electric powered ATV that has traction motor of 48V with fully automatic transmission having 10.83 Gear Ratios and 110 Ah battery pack.

It relies on the fact that two expressions are identical precisely when corresponding coefficients are equal for each different type of term. The method is used to bring formulas into a desired form. Example in real fractions Suppose we want to apply partial fraction decomposition to the expression: :\\\\frac{1}{x(x-1)(x-2)},\\\\, that is, we want to bring it into the form: :\\\\frac{A}{x}+\\\\frac{B}{x-1}+\\\\frac{C}{x-2},\\\\, in which the unknown parameters are A, B and C. Multiplying these formulas by x(x ‚àí 1)(x ‚àí 2) turns both into polynomials, which we equate: :A(x-1)(x-2) + Bx(x-2) + Cx(x-1) = 1,\\\\, or, after expansion and collecting terms with equal powers of x: :(A+B+C)x^2 - (3A+2B+C)x + 2A = 1.\\\\, At this point it is essential to realize that the polynomial 1 is in fact equal to the polynomial 0x2 + 0x + 1, having zero coefficients for the positive powers of x. Equating the corresponding coefficients now results in this system of linear equations: :A+B+C = 0,\\\\, :3A+2B+C = 0,\\\\, :2A = 1.\\\\, Solving it results in: :A = \\\\frac{1}{2},\\\\, B = -1,\\\\, C = \\\\frac{1}{2}.\\\\, Example in nested radicals A similar problem, involving equating like terms rather than coefficients of like terms, arises if we wish to de-nest the nested radicals \\\\sqrt{a+b \\\\sqrt{c}\\\\ } to obtain an equivalent expression not involving a square root of an expression itself involving a square root, we can postulate the existence of rational parameters d, e such that :\\\\sqrt{a+b \\\\sqrt{c}\\\\ } = \\\\sqrt{d}+\\\\sqrt{e}. Squaring both sides of this equation yields: :a+b \\\\sqrt{c} = d + e + 2 \\\\sqrt{de}. To find d and e we equate the terms not involving square roots, so a=d+e, and equate the parts involving radicals, so b\\\\sqrt{c}=2\\\\sqrt{de} which when squared implies b^2c=4de. This gives us two equations, one quadratic and one linear, in the desired parameters d and e, and these can be solved to obtain :e=\\\\frac{a + \\\\sqrt {a^2-b^2c}}{2}, :d=\\\\frac{a - \\\\sqrt {a^2-b^2c}}{2}, which is a valid solution pair if and only if \\\\sqrt{a^2-b^2c} is a rational number. Example of testing for linear dependence of equations Consider this overdetermined equation system (with 3 equations in just 2 unknowns): :x-2y+1=0, :3x+5y-8=0, :4x+3y-7=0. To test whether the third equation is linearly dependent on the first two, postulate two parameters a and b such that a times the first equation plus b times the second equation equals the third equation. Since this always holds for the right sides, all of which are 0, we merely need to require it to hold for the left sides as well: :a(x-2y+1)+b(3x+5y-8)=4x+3y-7. Equating the coefficients of x on both sides, equating the coefficients of y on both sides, and equating the constants on both sides gives the following system in the desired parameters a, b: :a+3b=4, :-2a+5b=3, :a-8b=-7. Solving it gives: :a = 1, \\\\ b = 1 The unique pair of values a, b satisfying the first two equations is (a, b) = (1, 1); since these values also satisfy the third equation, there do in fact exist a, b such that a times the original first equation plus b times the original second equation equals the original third equation; we conclude that the third equation is linearly dependent on the first two. Note that if the constant term in the original third equation had been anything other than ‚Äì7, the values (a, b) = (1, 1) that satisfied the first two equations in the parameters would not have satisfied the third one (a‚Äì8b = constant), so there would exist no a, b satisfying all three equations in the parameters, and therefore the third original equation would be independent of the first two. Example in complex numbers The method of equating coefficients is often used when dealing with complex numbers. For example, to divide the complex number a+bi by the complex number c+di, we postulate that the ratio equals the complex number e+fi, and we wish to find the values of the parameters e and f for which this is true. We write :\\\\frac{a+bi}{c+di}=e+fi, and multiply both sides by the denominator to obtain :(ce-fd)+(ed+cf)i=a+bi. Equating real terms gives :ce-fd=a, and equating coefficients of the imaginary unit i gives :ed+cf=b. These are two equations in the unknown parameters e and f, and they can be solved to obtain the desired coefficients of the quotient: :e= \\\\frac{ac+bd}{c^2+d^2} \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\quad f=\\\\frac{bc-ad}{c^2+d^2} .

Biography Gould was born in Boston. He was at first a merchant with his brother in the dry-goods business, but studied sculpture under Seth Wells Cheney starting in 1851 and in 1863 exhibited two large heads of Christ and Satan at the Boston Athen√¶um. As a result of the American Civil War, he lost his moderate fortune, and in 1868 moved with his family to Florence, Italy, where he devoted himself to study and work. His West Wind, originally sculpted in 1870, stirred controversy in 1874 when it was denounced as a copy of Canova's Hebe, with the exception of the drapery, which was modelled by Signor Mazzoli. Animated newspaper correspondence followed this charge, and it was proved groundless. Gould declared that his designs were entirely his own, and that not a statue, bust, or medallion was allowed to leave his studio until finished in all points on which depended their character and expression. West Wind was later shown in the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876, and all told Gould subsequently made seven copies in two sizes. He also created statues of Kamehameha the Great, Cleopatra, Timon of Athens, Ariel, and John Hancock (now in the town hall of Lexington, Massachusetts). Gould visited Boston in 1878, where he executed a number of portrait busts, including those of Emerson (now in the Harvard University library), John Albion Andrew, Seth Wells Cheney, and Junius Brutus Booth. Two alti-rilievi representing Steam and Electricity, displayed within the Boston Herald building, were among his last works. His statue of John Bridge, now on the Cambridge, Massachusetts commons, was completed by his son. Gould died in Florence, Italy in 1881. His body was returned to Forest Hills Cemetery for burial in the family plot, where it is commemorated with one of his own creations, Ascending Spirit.

Subsequently, research within the Generative Second-Language Acquisition (GenSLA) tradition describes and explains SLA by probing the interplay between Universal Grammar, knowledge of one's native language and input from the target language. Research is conducted in syntax, phonology, morphology, phonetics, semantics, and has some relevant applications to pragmatics. Some of the main questions in GenSLA include: # whether UG is available to the adult L2 learner to guide acquisition and to what extent; # whether L2 learners can reset linguistic parameters from their L1; # whether second-language learners experience difficulties interfacing between different modules of the grammar; # whether child second language acquisition differs from that of adults.Jabballa, M.M.H (2017). Access to Second Language Acquisition. Journal of Language Studies, Semiotics and Semantics, Vol. 8 (2) 479-484 As generative second language research endeavours to explain the totality of L2 acquisition phenomena, it is also concerned with investigating the extent of linguistic transfer, maturational effects on acquisition, and why some learners fail to acquire a target-like L2 grammar even with abundant input. Furthermore, studying L2 acquisition through a generative lens give linguists a better idea of the natural constraints on human languages and the inner workings of Universal Grammar.Haznedar, B. (2013). Child second language acquisition from a generative perspective. In Linguistic Approaches to Bilingualism (pp. 26‚Äì47). John Benjamins Publishing Company. Research in generative second-language acquisition is presented at a range of conferences, including: GASLA (Generative Approaches to Second Language Acquisition), GALANA (Generative Approaches to Language Acquisition - North America), and BUCLD (Boston University Conference on Language Development). Prominent researchers of the topic include Suzanne Flynn of MIT, Bonnie Schwartz of University of Hawaii, Antonella Sorace of University of Edinburgh, and Lydia White of McGill University. History  Pre-GenSLA: 1960s-1970s  In the late 1960s-early 1970s researchers observed that the language and errors of L2 learners were not random but systematic and evidence of rule-governed behaviour.Adj√©mian, C. (1976). On the nature of interlanguage systems. Language Learning, 26, 297‚Äì320.Corder, S. P. (1967). The significance of learners‚Äô errors. International Review of Applied Linguistics, 5, 161‚Äì70.Nemser, W. (1971). Approximative systems of foreign language learners. International Review of Applied Linguistics, 9, 115‚Äì23.Selinker, L. (1972). Interlanguage.International Review of Applied Linguistics, 10, 209‚Äì31. From this observation researchers proposed the concept of interlanguage which refers to the language system used by L2 learners that contains interacting linguistic aspects of both the L1 and L2. This system theory regarding the interlanguage suggests that L2 learners have mental grammars that can be described with rules and principles. The Beginnings of GenSLA:1980-1990s The history of GenSLA research begins in the 1980s prompted by two interconnected questions: # The logical problem of language acquisition # How the logical problem of language acquisition applies to L2 acquisition in adulthood. The logical problem of language acquisition refers to the observable mismatch between the primary linguistic data (PLD) or language specific input a child is exposed to and the state of their eventual language system, that is, children appear to acquire their native language quickly and with little negative feedback even when the input is uneven, inconsistent and unrepresentative of their ultimate linguistic competence. Some suggest in an argument commonly known as Poverty of the Stimulus (POS) that there are, in fact, certain properties of language that are too abstract, subtle and complex to be acquired by language input and the operation of domain general cognitive mechanisms alone. Similarly, children are not exposed to a rich wealth of linguistic data to be able to acquire all the rules and principles of their distinct language. Therefore, an extra component, such as the UG which consists of innate domain-specific linguistic knowledge, is needed to account for these POV properties. Subsequently, starting from the assumption of UG GenSLA researchers asked how the problem of language acquisition applies to L2 acquisition in adulthood. This encompassed questions about what similarities and differences exist between child L1 acquisition and adult L2 acquisition and, in particular, whether or not adults also have access UG. Indeed, most theories and research in the first two decades of GenSLA actually revolved around this singular question to which there are four proposed answers: # L2 learners have direct or full access to UG # L2 learners have partial access to UG #L2 learners have indirect access to UG # L2 learners have no access to UG. GenSLA researchers assumed during these early decades that if they could show that a particular POS property operated or did not operate in L2 grammar they could generalize to other POS properties and to UG accessibility or non- accessibility in general. Because an L2 learner's L1 contains UG information available for transfer to their L2 it was thought that the strongest case for L2 access to UG would be evidence of knowledge in L2 learners that constituted instances of POS properties that are non-transferable. In other words, linguistic knowledge that could not be learned from L2 input, explicit learning, transfer from L1 knowledge, or the operation of domain general cognitive mechanisms. Feature Focused: Late 1990s-early 2000s The field of GenSLA research experienced significant theoretical developments in the late 1990s/early 2000s following changes in generative linguistic theory inspired by Chomsky's minimalist program. These changes shifted the debate from questions solely about access to UG to the consideration of specific features in L2 grammars and how they are represented. The features under consideration here are linguistic units that reflect grammatical meanings such as tense, case, number, person, gender, or conceptual meanings such as evidentiality, habitual aspect and definiteness One key characteristic of these features is that they reflect variation across languages in their overtness, which became particularly important to GenSLA research. A feature of a word or phrase is said to be overt if there is surface evidence of its existence within that word or phrase. By contrast, a feature of a word or phrase is said to be covert if there is no surface evidence of its existence within that word or phrase. This made interesting predictions about adult L2 learning behaviour, for example, that L2 overt morphology should be easier to acquire if the learner has similar overt features in their L1. In one relevant study it was shown that Russian but not Japanese L2 learners of English were, in line with these predictions, reliably sensitive to English plural errors, (Russian has overt plural morphology while Japanese does not).Jiang, N., Novokshanova, E., Masuda, K., & Wang, X. (2011). Morphological congruency and the acquisition of L2 morphemes. Language Learning, 61, 940‚Äì967. Another important element of these features for GenSLA research is interpretability. A feature is said to be interpretable if it contributes to sentence meaning and uninterpretable if it has grammatical significance only. This predicted that only meaningful features should be accessible to adult L2 learners and purely grammatical features should not be accessible for L1 transfer. No access and partial access theories sometimes adopted this distinction, arguing that it explains much variation attested in adult L2 grammars. For example, that Chinese speakers learning English as an L2 often omit third-person singular agreement morphology in obligatory contexts could easily be explained because these features are uninterpretable in Chinese.Li, Y. (1990). Order and constituency in Mandarin Chinese. Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer. New Populations: 2000s Onwards By the 2000s it was generally accepted that adult SLA differed from child L1 acquisition in process and typical outcomes and there was evidence for adult accessibility in at least some properties of UG. This motivated GenSLA theory to shift focus from questions just about UG accessibility and specific features to describing and explaining variation at group and individual levels. The last decade has also seen a significant increase in GenSLA studies that examine SLA in populations complementary to L2 acquisition including heritage bilingualism, child L2 acquisition, and multilingual acquisition to gain new insights into the latter. For example, it was found that heritage bilinguals diverge from monolinguals in the ultimate state of their eventual language system in ways similar to adult L2 learners even though they are native speakers and even when the learning process takes places in a naturalistic setting in early childhood.Rothman, J., & Treffers- Daller, J. (2014). A prolegomenon to the construct of the native speaker: Heritage speaker bilinguals are natives too! Applied Linguistics, 35, 93‚Äì98. This casts doubt on the critical period hypothesis (CP) that age is the determining factor in convergent language acquisition, another rich area of debate in GenSLA research Montrul, S. (2008). Incomplete acquisition in bilingualism: Re-examining the age factor (Vol. 39). Amsterdam, The Netherlands: John Benjamins Publishing.Montrul, S. (2012). Is the heritage language like a second language? EuroSLA Yearbook, 12, 1‚Äì29.Montrul, S. (2016). Heritage language acquisition. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. With respect to child L2 acquisition, it was hypothesized that if child and adult L2 learners follow the same developmental path this would call into question the claims made by some GenSLA researchers that differences between L1 and L2 learners are due to the inaccessibility of UG. This is because in GenSLA child L2 learners under the age of 7 to 8 are hypothesized to have access to UG. Thus, if the developmental paths of child and adult L2 learners overlap significantly it is likely that the basis of difference is the shared experience they have with their L1. If, however, if they follow different developmental paths this would seem to support the claim that adult L2 learners do not have access to UG; their learning must instead be due to other factors. Finally, in multilingual acquisition, if it were shown that adult L2 learners can transfer POS properties only available from their L2 to their L3 or L4 etc. this could also be used to cast doubt on the CP hypothesize. In addition, there has been a movement towards examining children's L2 acquisition. The study of child SLA is argued to be an important way of examining both child L1 acquisition and adult L2 acquisition. Unlike adults, children acquiring an L2 are considered to have full and direct access to Universal Grammar, and are typically more successful at retainment of the L2 and reaching a state of fluency. Some scholars have argued that examining child L2 acquisition is an essential tool in solving the debate over adult access to UG Most recent work on child L2 acquisition within generative framework has focused on the following 3 major issues: # L1 influence in child L2 acquisition, # The availability of functional categories (emphasis on the acquisition of tense-agreement and tense-aspect), # Morphological variability. Access Theories 250px No Access Theories of no access argue that adult second language learners do not have access to UG. One source of evidence for this position stems from research observations made in the 1970s and 80s that children experience a critical period or reduced ability over time to acquire a functional L1 morphosyntactic system that ends around puberty. L2 acquisition, however, does not share this similarity with late L1 acquisition, L2 learners being generally more successful than the latter. Additionally, child L2 and adult L2 learners differ greatly in the developmental paths they take and their ultimate attainment. The Fundamental Difference Hypothesis Bley-Vroman, R. (1990). The logical problem of foreign language learning. Linguistic Analysis 20: 3 ‚Äì 49 refers to how linguistic methods of language acquisition applied in early childhood are not available for adult learners, which points to a fundamental difference in access to UG between child and adult learners. Adult L2 acquisition resembles the process of general adult learning in fields where there is no domain-specific learning system believed to exist. Direct Access Theories of direct access argue that UG is still directly accessible to adult second language learners, in addition to syntactic property transfer from their L1. Evidence for this position stems from research observations that although child L1 and adult L2 grammars differ, adult L2 grammars do exhibit evidence of POS properties that cannot be linked to transfer from their native language or learning. For example, adult L2 learners show knowledge of parameter settings other than those of their first language. In direct access theories the differences between adult and children must subsequently be explained on the basis of something other than UG accessibility. Many propose that it is in fact this difference between the L1 initial state and L2 initial state that accounts for the differences, when comparing child SLA learners and adult SLA learners. Advocates of this position also frequently tried to show that learners are stuck within principles and parameter settings exemplified in their L1.Schachter, J. (1989). Testing a proposed universal. In S. Gass and J. Schachter (eds.), Linguistic perspectives on second language acquisition (pp. 73‚Äì88). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Some experts have commented that theories of direct access could also be characterized as direct access since the learner is not restricted only to UG principles and parameter settings of the L1 grammar due to the resetting and restructuring that occurs with the learning of the L2. Some relevant theories that assume access to UG in adulthood and propose other factors as cause of differences between L1 and L2 acquisition: Missing Surface Inflection Hypothesis,Prevost, P. and L.

Indirect Access  The indirect access viewpoint considers the possibility that access to a second language grammar is first through a first language, where the second language then causes a resetting and restructuring of the learners understanding of grammar once they have been exposed to the second language.White, L. (2003). Second Language Acquisition and Universal Grammar. Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics.

Generative SLA in the Classroom  Teaching ESL  Scholars in Generative SLA have suggested that their research is relevant in developing effective methods of teaching a second language in classroom settings including bilingual, immersion, second dialect education and second language literacy programs.Sutherland, S. (2015). A Generative Second Language Acquisition-Inspired Syllabus: An Article Remedial Course for Intermediate Adult ESL Learners. The University of Sheffield. Practical GenSLA researchers seek to go beyond \\"passive\\" acquisition and utilize theories in SLA to efficiently teach L2s. The practical application of GenSLA is based on what is necessary or unnecessary to teach based on UG access. For example, it is generally accepted that prepositional modifiers can be accessed in UG, and because of this it may not be efficient to teach them explicitly. However, other grammatical issues such as topic and focus structures are not innate, and therefore second language learners benefit from explicit teaching. Additionally, GenSLA research can be used with relation to topics processing, practice and orthography, and be extended beyond mere production.Whong, M., Gil, K.H., Marsden,H. (2013). Introduction: Generative Second Language Acquisition and Language Pedagogy. In Universal Grammar and the Second Language Classroom. Educational Linguistics. 1-13. Research on practical, educational usage of GenSLA theories have been explored in L2s such as Spanish, English, German and French.  Aiding Populations with Special Language Learning Needs  It has been suggested that GenSLA research could be used to aid populations with special language learning needs, for example, it might be used to develop language intervention programs using methods similar to those implemented in second language teaching to help children with down syndrome Mahoney, G. 1975: Ethnological approach to delayed language acquisition.

Applications: Word Order Acquisition  There have been debates regarding how one can apply the principles of Generative L2 Acquisition to individuals acquiring a second language with a different word order from their L1 (for example individuals whose L1 was SOV and are now learning a SVO language, or vice versa). Some researchers have hypothesized that on the basis of the full transfer full access theory, individuals will use L1 grammar and parameter setting initially during their acquisition of L2, but would still have access to the UG. This notion contains features of both the direct and indirect theories of UG, which involves some form of access to the UG. However, research has shown that not all individuals acquiring the L2 will produce transfers from their L1, as the transfer process depends on the structural components of the L1. Instead, some linguists have argued that the process of second language acquisition can be accounted for by general learning principles and in fact not does correspond to having access to the UG. Therefore, this particular issue of different word-order acquisition can be used to call into question if the direct access theory of UG is relevant to second language acquisition, or if a no access theory is more plausible. Pierantozzi, Cristina. 2009. The Acquisition of Word Order in Different Learner Types. In Proceedings of the 10th Generative Approaches to Second Language Acquisition Conference (GASLA 2009), ed. Melissa Bowles et al., 264-271. Somerville, MA: Cascadilla Proceedings Project. Criticism There has been some criticism regarding Generative L2 Acquisition on the basis of methodology and other linguistic theories. Methodological Issues There have been claims that there are several methodological issues in generative research. The subjects need to have a requisite level of the L2 to see if a principle is operating in their interlanguage grammar. Furthermore, complex structures are often needed to test for interlanguage grammar, and the speakers need to be able to competently engage with the structures within their current L2 capacity. It is also difficult to rule out the influence of the L1, if the languages present similar principles that are in question. One of the most controversial methodological issues in generative second language acquisition is regarding what L2 data is collected. There is a need to obtain information about competence rather than performance, and it is difficult to obtain samples which contain the complex structures necessary to observe UG- related parameters and principles. Elicited data is preferred, but still problematic based on the skill level of the speaker, and is not considered naturally occurring speech. The Minimal Tree Hypothesis 250px The Minimal Trees Hypothesis (MTH) is a highly debated hypothesis which is concerned with the distinction between Functional Categories and Lexical Categories during language transfer.Vainikka, A. & Young-Scholten, M. (1994). Direct Access to X-bar Theory: Evidence from Korean and Turkish Adults Learning German.

Based on a study of adult SLA learners of German, Korean and Turkish, this hypothesis asserts that only lexical categories transfer from the L1, and functional categories develop over time. This development has also been termed \\"organic grammar\\", in which the development of functional categories develop from Verb Phrase (VP)‚Üí Inflection Phrase (IP)‚Üí Complementizer Phrase (CP).Vainikka, A. & Young- Scholten, M.

With regard to the methodological problems, the MTH has issue pertaining to performance vs. competence in data collection. The theoretical problems which exist in the hypothesis relate to the role of input, the transfer of lexical categories, and the development of previous linguistic theories and research regarding L2 Acquisition research. The theoretical basis of the MTH has been contested by many researchers, which call into question the validity of the hypothesis. Vainikka & Young-Scholten themselves, the originators of the hypothesis, acknowledge that their theory is more \\"radical\\" than what is often seen in generative SLA academia.Vainikka, A. & Young-Scholten, M.

Despite the controversial nature of the hypothesis, MTH has been considered an extremely strong and valuable contribution to SLA research and generative grammar as a whole.

They contest the existence of the logical problem of acquisition and the existence of UG hypothesized to fill the alleged explanatory gap. If this is true it would throw the generative approach to SLA into question. Supporters of GenSLA argue, however, that in order to disprove the logical problem of acquisition detractors would have to either show there are no instances of poverty of stimulus properties or when input alone is insufficient, one needs to explain the child's resulting competence in virtue of the operation of domain general cognitive mechanisms, statistical learning or processing considerations.Schwartz, B.

The Sican culture is also referred to as Lambayeque culture, after the name of the region in Peru. It succeeded the Moche culture. There is still controversy among archeologists and anthropologists over whether the two are separate cultures. The Sican culture is divided into three major periods based on cultural changes as evidenced in archeological artifacts.\\"Research Settings: The Sican Culture\\" , Sican Archaeological Project (SAP), 2007, Retrieved 5 October 2008. Geography and location Archaeologist Izumi Shimada, founder of the Sican Archaeological Project, named the prehistoric culture which he discovered in northwestern Peru. They succeeded the Moche and preceded the Inca Empire, the historical civilization that encountered the Spanish explorers and conquistadors. The Sican inhabited a coastal territory near the La Leche and Lambayeque Rivers. The archaeological sites span the Lambayeque region, including the Motupe, La Leche, Lambayeque, and Za√±a valleys, near modern-day Chiclayo. Numerous sites have been identified in the Bat√°n Grande area of the La Leche Valley. The climate of the area during Sican occupation was similar to the current climate, despite changes in landscape accumulated in the last 600 years. The drought-and-flood cycles seen in the region for the past 1500 years did not spare the Sican culture. (Goldstein and Shimada 2007, p. 49) Historical periods Early Sican Gold disc ornament The Early Sican period began around 750 and lasted until 900. The lack of artifacts has limited the development of knowledge about this early period. The Sican were probably descendants of the Moche culture, which fell around 800. Their works shows shared motifs in the artifacts recovered.Shimada, Izumi. 2000, p. 52 Similar groups include Cajamarca, Wari and Pachacamac. From remains found in the archaeological locations, researchers have determined that this culture maintained commercial exchange with people from present-day Ecuador (shells and snails), Colombia to the north (emeralds and amber), Chile to the south (blue stone), and the eastern basin of the Mara√±√≥n River (seeds of gold). The Lambayeque culture may have been a separate trading people as well. Around 800, the Sican created the city of Poma, located at Bat√°n Grande, in La Leche Valley. Few other Early Sican sites have been discovered. The Early Sican culture is known for the highly polished, black-finish ceramics found in the La Leche Valley. This black-finish ceramic style began in the Moche culture prior to the Early Sican, and shows the sharing of cultures in the region. Much of the ceramics were examples of a single spout, loop-handle bottle, featuring an anthropomorphic-avian (bird) face at the spout base. The face consisted of bulging eyes, a hooked beak or triangular projection instead of a nose, stylized ears, and no mouth. It appeared to be a predecessor to the related faces of the Sican Deity and the Sican Lord of the Middle Sican culture. (Shimada 2000, p. 51) Aside from the shared ceramic styles, much of the Early Sican defines a distinguishable culture. While the ceramic styles and iconography show some continuity with previous cultures, the combination of all the influences is Sican. The changing ceramic styles, iconography, and funerary practices reflect a change in religious ideology and cosmology that expressed the Sican culture. Most importantly, the late Early Sican period saw the accumulation of these changes in art style and iconography, coupled with other changes in organization, by which the Sican constructed monumental adobe structures, developed large-scale copper alloy smelting and metalworking, and developed the elaborate funerary tradition that would come to characterize the Middle Sican (Shimada 1985, p. 361). Such changes have been seen by researchers at sites in Bat√°n Grande, including the Huaca del Pueblo site, dated to around 850-900. Middle Sican 9-11th century Sican funerary mask in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. The Middle Sican period lasted from 900 to 1100 . This is the period of the Sican's ‚Äúcultural florescence,‚Äù and is marked by the emergence of various cultural innovations, some of which were unprecedented in the local area. The decline of the Wari Empire and the Middle Cajamarca polity enabled the resurgence in local political and religious identity and autonomy. The Middle Sican culture is marked by distinctive characteristics in six areas: art and ideology, crafts and technology, funerary customs, long-distance trade, religious cities and monumental temples, and the structure and authority of the state (Shimada 2000, p. 52-61; Shimada 1985, p. 365-369). Together, these characteristics provide evidence that the Sic√°n culture had a highly productive economy, clear social differentiation, and an influential religious ideology. The religious ideology was the underpinning of the structure of their theocratic state. =Art and ideology= Sic√°n art is representational in style and religious in nature. Features such as sculptural representation and the minimization of number of colors (one to three), were common among the art of many earlier cultures that flourished on the north coast of Peru. Sic√°n art reconfigured the motifs, conventions, and concepts of these antecedent cultures (mainly the Wari and Moche) into an overall new and unique style. The references to the old ideas, images and ways of antecedent cultures in Sic√°n art would have been useful in providing prestige and legitimacy to the new Sic√°n religion which was emerging. Sic√°n iconography is dominated by the Sican DeityNickle Arts Museum. (2006). Ancient Peru Unearthed: Golden Treasures of a Lost Civilization. Calgary: The Nickle Arts MuseumShimada, Izumi. \\"The Late Prehispanic Coastal States.\\" In The Inca World: The Development of Pre- Columbian Peru, edited by L. Laurencich Minelli, pp. 49‚Äì82. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000. It decorates all artistic media of the Sic√°n, including ceramics, metal works, and textiles. The icon is most commonly represented with a mask face and upturned eyes. Sometimes it may be shown with avian features, such as beaks, wings, and talons, which are evident in Early Sic√°n ceramics. These avian features are related to Naylamp, the key figure in Sic√°n mythology. The name \\"Naylamp\\" was first mentioned by the Spanish chronicler Miguel Cabello Valboa, who referred to the Moche figure \\"Naymlap\\" in his 1586 Miscel√°nea Ant√°rtica. Later authors believe the form is Mochica √ëa√±lap, of which the first part is √±a√± \\"waterfowl\\"; a connexion has been made between the Moche and Chim√∫ cultures and the empire of Chimor and the Mochica language. Sican gold cup, 850-1050 Naylamp was said to be the founder of the first dynasty of prehistoric kings in La Leche and Lambayeque valleys. In The Legend of Naylamp, first recorded in the 16th century by the Spanish chronicler Miguel Cabello de Balboa, Naylamp is said to have traveled on a balsa raft by sea to the Lambayeque shores. He founded a large city, and the 12 sons of his eldest son each founded a new city in the Lambayeque region. When Naylamp died, he sprouted wings and flew off to another world (Nickle Arts Museum 2006, p. 18 and 65). Middle Sic√°n art did not change the concept or representation of the icon of the Sic√°n Deity. Both the preceding Moche and Wari cultures feature a single dominant male figure, and the upturned eyes characteristic of the Sic√°n Deity are common to the art and iconography of other Pre-Hispanic societies. The iconography accompanying the Sic√°n Deity was unique and significant (Nickle Arts Museum 2006, p. 66). Iconography of the moon and the ocean may symbolize the Sic√°n Deity's involvement in the wellbeing of marine life and fishermen. Iconography related to water signifies the importance of irrigation and agriculture to the Sic√°n. Other iconography, such as of the sun and moon, symbolizes the importance of duality in both human and celestial life. Depictions of the Sic√°n Deity with tumi knives and trophy heads may indicate his omnipotent control in both human life and the celestial world (Nickle Arts Museum 2006, p. 66; Shimada 2000, p. 52-53). Through the iconography which the Sic√°n associated with the icon, anthropologists theorize that the Sic√°n Deity may have been attributed with power to control all of the celestial forces fundamental to life and abundance (Shimada 2000, p. 53). the lack of representation of humans in Middle Sic√°n art emphasizes the omnipresence of the Sic√°n Deity in Sic√°n iconography. The only exceptions are representations of the Sic√°n Lord, the male elite personage, and his entourage. (Shimada 2000, p. 53) Iconography of the Sic√°n Lord is almost identical to the Sic√°n Deity, except that he is shown in natural settings and does not have avian features. The Sic√°n Lord was probably meant to represent an earthly alter-ego of the Deity. =Crafts and technology= The population of Bat√°n Grande included many skilled artisans. Craft production during the Middle Sican flourished and became one of the leading characteristics of the period. The highly polished black finish ceramics from the Early Sican bloomed in this later phase, along with metallurgy; however, the ceramic technology used in the Middle Sican developed over 2500 years from local pottery production techniques (Shimada and Wagner 2001, p. 26). Workshops, such as the one found at Huaca Sialupe to the west of Bat√°n Grande, likely had both pottery and metalworking production sites (Goldsmith and Shimada 2007, p. 45). Ceramics allowed for a medium to convey political and religious ideology in the forms of storage vessels, architectural ornaments, cooking vessels, sculptures of the Deity or animals, and other types proliferated during this period. The potters likely worked separately from one another, rather than in assembly-line type production. Huaca Sialupe excavations produced clusters of similar kilns using local hardwood for charcoal. Field experiments indicated that the kilns were used either for ceramics or metallurgy (Shimada and Wagner 2001, p. 28). The Paleteada ceramics used the paddle-and-anvil technique to form and decorate pottery, primarily with geometric designs (Cleland and Shimada 1998, p. 112). The monochrome black pottery became widely popular across the region during the Middle Sican as the Sican themselves began to emphasize the black pottery, with the help of the Middle Sican religious prestige. Only the geometric designs continued on the pottery into the Late Sican. Metropolitan Museum Metallurgy is one of the Sican's greatest legacies, lasting nearly 600 years at Bat√°n Grande (Shimada and Merkel 1991, p. 83). Some Middle Sican workshops showed multicraft production and it is likely the crafts competed for resources, such as fuel for kilns. Middle- and high-status burials both contained the black ceramics, while only the social elite had access to the precious metal object; therefore, metalworking probably was given production preference by the elites (Goldsmith and Shimada 2007, p. 47). The greatness of Middle Sican metallurgy was the large scale smelting and diverse use of arsenical copper, which was more ductile and corrosion-resistant than pure copper. The great amounts of smelting and/or metalworking sites found in the Lambayeque region point to the convergence of major factors to allow such an occurrence: accessible ore deposits, extensive forests for hardwood to make charcoal, pottery making tradition using efficient kilns, gold working tradition that formed the basis for later metalworking technology, and a demand for goods by the elites (Shimada, Goldstein, Wagner, Bezur 2007, p. 339). The large number of smelting sites also point to the amount of labor required by using their method. In modern standards, their copper-alloy smelting was inefficient, which could have led to the high number of workshops with multiple furnaces (Shimada and Merkel 1991, p. 85). =Society= The precious metal objects found in Middle Sican sites reveal the unprecedented scale of their production and use. Metal objects permeated all levels of society. Tumbaga, a thin sheet of low karat gold alloy, was used to wrap ceramic vessels for the lower elites, while the upper elites had high karat gold alloys. Common laborers only had arsenical copper objects. The precious metal objects then clearly demonstrate a hierarchy within the society (Shimada 2000, p. 56). No evidence of metalworking at the large sites has been uncovered, such as the Middle Sican capital Sican or elsewhere in the Bat√°n Grande area, but the precious metal objects were clearly for the elites. From their high status sites, the elites supervised the manufacturing of their precious metal objects for ritual or funerary purposes (Shimada and Merkel 1991, p. 86). =Funerary practices= Ceremonial Tumi, 850-10150 Excavations of religious sites have revealed much about the funerary practices of the Sic√°n people. These funerary practices have helped anthropologists understand the broader organization and structure of Sic√°n society and religion. Most of the evidence for these funerary practices has been based on excavations carried out at the Huaca Loro site in Poma by Izumi Shimada and the SAP. First of all, the funerary practices at Huaca Loro reflect the social differentiation and hierarchy present Sic√°n society. This social stratification is revealed in varying burial types and practices, along with accompanying grave goods. The most obvious difference in burial type based on social hierarchy was that commoners were buried in simple, shallow graves on the peripheries of the monumental mounds while the elite of Sic√°n society were buried in deep shaft tombs beneath monumental mounds, as shown in the East and West tombs at Huaca Loro.Shimada et al. 2005 Secondly, it was found that one's social status was also a determinant of the burial position of the body; seated, extended, or flexed. For example, bodies of the High Elite were always buried in the seated position, while commoners could be buried in a seated, extended, or flexed position (Nickle Arts Museum 2006, p. 87; Shimada et al. 2004). Furthermore, social differentiation is manifested even within the elite tombs at Huaca Loro, through the grouping and placement of bodies. The complex internal organization of both East and West Tombs was designed according to specific social and kinship relationships (Shimada et al. 2004). Recent studies that included the use of MtDNA (systematic mitochondrial DNA) analysis and inherited dental traits analysis revealed that women in the West Tomb were grouped according to their kinship ties to the principal personage and each other (Shimada et al. 2005; Shimada et al. 2004). The grouping of women in the south part of the West Tomb were found to be maternally related to one another, as well as the principal personage; the grouping of women in the north part of the West Tomb were found to not only be unrelated to one another, but also unrelated to the principal personage. Further, ceramics in the south part were found to be of typical Middle Sic√°n style, while the ceramics in the North part were of a Mochica style (Shimada et al. 2005; Shimada et al. 2004). This evidence suggests that while the women of the South part of the West tomb were grouped and placed according to their kinship ties with the principal personage, the women of the North part of the West tomb had no kinship ties with the principal personage or each other therefore were placed and grouped according to some other distinct relationship to the principal personage. This genetic evidence and along with the differing styles of ceramics suggests that the North-niche women of the West Tomb were perhaps descendants of a different ethnic group, the Moche, who had been integrated into Sic√°n society under political domination (Shimada et al. 2004). While these relationships have not been proved definitively, it shows the great complexity itself of elite burial practices based on social differentiation. Social stratification and hierarchy is also evidenced through the variation in quantity and quality of grave goods associated with those of different social status. The elite East Tomb at Huaca Loro, contained over a ton of diverse grave goods, over two-thirds of which were objects of arsenical bronze, tumbaga (low-karat gold), silver and copper alloys, and high-karat gold alloys.Shimada 2000, p. 56Nickle Arts Museum 2006, p. 89 Other grave goods of the elite included semi-precious stone objects, amber, feathers, textiles, imported shells (such as conus and spondylus), shell beads, and double spout bottles. (Nickle Arts Museum 2006, p. 87; Shimada 2000, p. 56; Bruhns 1994, p. 290) On the other hand, commoner burials had a significantly less amount of grave goods of different types, made of less valuable materials. For example, commoner grave goods at Huaca Loro were usually restricted to single-spout bottles, utilitarian plain and/or paddle decorated pottery, and copper-arsenic objects, instead of the precious metal objects of the elite tombs. (Nickle Arts Museum 2006, p. 87, Shimada et al. 2004) The power of the elite of Sic√°n society is demonstrated not only by the amount, quality, and diversity of exotic and status goods accumulated in the tombs, but also by the amount of time and labor that would have gone into making and acquiring them. (Shimada 2000, p. 56) All together, the construction of the monumental mound at Huaca Loro, the preparation of the East and West Tombs and performance of the associated rituals required careful and complex planning, and considerable material, labor resources and time, and suggests the elite's control and monopoly of power in society. Secondly, the funerary practices of the Sic√°n suggest the existence of an elite lineage that used the new Sic√°n religion to demonstrate and maintain their power (Shimada et al. 2004). The Sic√°n elite used funerary practices as a way to symbolize their relationship to the divine. The sheer size and grandeur of the monumental mounds built above the elite tombs would have been awe-inspiring to Sic√°n citizens and a symbol the divine nature of the figures buried below. (Shimada et al. 2004) Colorful murals with religious iconography decorated ceremonial precincts in the temples of the mounds, establishing the sanctity of the ritual space, and reaffirming this connection of the buried elite below to the divine. (Nickle Arts Museum 2006, Shimada et al. 2004) Also, the principal personage of the East Tomb at Huaca Loro wears a mask identical to the Sic√°n Deity, which is another reference to his relationship to the Deity and the divine. (Shimada et al. 2004, p. 389) The construction itself of these monumental mounds served as a reminder of the elite's power and endurance, and combined with the symbolic use of Sic√°n religious iconography to justify the divine merits of the elite lineage, was an attempt by the Sic√°n elite to ‚Äúpreserve the status quo of inherited rights.‚Äù (Shimada et al. 2004, p. 370) The funerary rites and rituals performed by the living lineage members served to further reinforce their lineage identity and the three-way relationship between the divine, the dead, and the living elite. (Shimada et al. 2004, p. 389) =Foreign trade= Chancay, vessel with the Sican god, Late Intermediate The variety of grave goods suggests the wide range of power of the Middle Sican elite. They not only received the most grave offerings, but also the best quality and exotic offerings. None of the metalworking sites showed evidence of on-site mining of any of the materials. In addition, the spondylus shell, emeralds, feathers, and other minerals were imported to the area. Their materials came from mainly the northern Andes, such as Ecuador (from the Manteno and Milagro cultures), Peru, Colombia, but could have also reached as far south as the Tiwanaku empire in the south-central Andes and east to the Mara√±√≥n River, a major tributary of the Amazon River.Cleland and Shimada 1998 The Middle Sican trade networks appear to be unprecedented in range and goods involved, which helped to insure the spread of Sican religion and polity outside of the Lambayeque and La Leche valleys (Shimada 2000, p. 58). They also could have controlled the transport methods in addition to the goods being traded. The breeding and herding of llamas on the North Coast since the time of the Moche could have been utilized by the Sican to provide the goods as well as a caravan of llamas to transport the goods considerable distances (Shimada 1985, p. 391). =Religious cities and mounds= The Sic√°n culture is characterized by the establishment of religious cities with monumental temples. The religious capital city and cultural center of the Middle Sic√°n is referenced as the Sic√°n Precinct. (Bruhns 1994, p. 293). This T-shaped area is defined by monumental mounds of Huaca Loro, El Mosc√≥n, Las Ventanas, La Merced, and Abejas built between around AD 900 and 1050.Bruhns, K.O. (1994). Ancient South America. Cambridge [England]; New York: Cambridge University Press. The pyramidal monumental mounds were used as both burials sites for the elite and places of worship and ritual. The construction of the monumental mounds required considerable material, labor resources and time, indicating the Sic√°n elite's control and monopoly over the society's resources and manpower. They are a dramatic symbol of the power, wealth and permanence of the Middle Sic√°n elite and their theocratic state that dominated much of the north coast. Two types of mounds are found in the Lambayeque Valley dating to the Sic√°n. The first type is the T-shaped mound, which is a relatively low mound with a short, central ramp providing direct access to the top of the mound. The second type is a relatively tall mound with steep sides and a zig- zagging ramp to provide circuitous access to the mound top. This second type also featured an enclosed structure at the top of the mound, likely for private rituals, whereas the first type of mound was likely for public rituals (Shimada 2000, p. 60; Shimada, Shinoda, Farnum, Corruccini, Watanabe 2004, p. 388). The mounds also covered and protected the shafts of tombs of elites underneath. The Sic√°n used a walled-chamber-and-fill technique (which first appeared on the North Coast during Moche V) for constructing the monumental mound where the walls were created by adobe bricks and mortar in conjunction with chambers of superimposed lattices filled with refuse and other readily available materials.Cavallero and Shimada 1988, p. 76 Marks on the adobe bricks used to make the mounds are indications of the patrons donating materials and/or labor for the construction of the temples (Shimada 2000, p. 60). This construction technique required ‚Äúlarge-scale, unified construction with centrally pooled materials and labor force‚Äù (Shimada 2000 p. 60). It allowed for rapid erection of monumental buildings while minimizing labor and material investment and promoted the centralization of political and religious power in order to plan and complete these monumental mounds.Shimada 2000 p. 60 =Agriculture and canals= While the Sican ceramics and metallurgy are vastly studied, agriculture during the Middle to Late Sican may have been linked to their increasing craft production. Shimada suggests that the canals at Pampa de Chaparri were developed by the Sican as part of an agro-industrial complex marked by an increase in mining and smelting operations, settlement growth, and the expansion of agriculture.Hayashida 2006, pp. 248-249 Along the canals, 39 Middle Sican sites and 76 Late Sican sites were identified; however, few sites were located in the irrigation fields. This Sican occupation at the irrigation system points to its construction during the Middle Sican. The construction of this irrigation system, as well as the association of hierarchical social units and canal branches, coincides with the rapid and dramatic growth of the Middle Sican. Irrigation for agriculture was a necessity for the Sican elite to produce a surplus of food to feed artisans and laborers, who in turn support the elites.Hayashida 2006, p. 257 Late Sican Double-Whistle Vessel with Sea Birds, 850-1350 The Late Sican period began around 1100 and ended with the conquest of the Lambayeque region by the Chim√∫ kingdom of Chimor circa 1375. =Abandonment of Sican and Bat√°n Grande= Around 1020, a major drought lasting 30 years occurred at Sican. At the time of the drought, the Sican Deity, so closely tied to the ocean and water in general, was at the center of Sican religion. The catastrophic changes in weather were thus linked to the Sican Deity, mainly to the failure of the Sican Deity to mediate nature for the Sican people. The Sican ceremonies (and temples/mounds on which they were performed) were supposed to ensure that there was an abundance of nature for the people. The elites were the mediators between the common people and the Sican Deity, as the Sican Deity was the mediator between nature and the Sican people. After 30 years of uncertainty in respect to nature, the temples that were the center of Middle Sican religion and elite power were burned and abandoned between 1050 and 1100. Perhaps the ancestor cult and aggrandizing of the elites caused too much resentment. Coupled with the drought that surely weakened agriculture in the area, the tolerance of the common population plummeted, forcing the removal of the political and religious leadership at Sican to save the people. There was little or no repair of the destruction of Sican, and further damage was inflicted by El Nino floods around 1100. =New Sican= The Valley of T√∫cume in Peru contains 26 pyramids The burning and abandonment of the previous capital meant that a new capital needed to be built. T√∫cume or \\"el Purgatorio\\" was constructed as the new Late Sican capital at the juncture of the La Leche and Lambayeque Valleys. T√∫cume became the new religious and ceremonial center of the Sican. The religious and iconographic legacies of the Middle Sican abruptly disappeared. It is at this juncture, when the Sican Deity and Sican Lord disappear from art, is when the Late Sican begins. Other mythical depictions from the Middle Sican continued in the Late Sican and reflect the revitalization of the religion going back to tradition relationships with nature. Icons include felines, fish, and birds that were secondary to the Sican Deity during the previous era, but were also linked to previous cultures in the area. Sican material culture, such as ceramics and metallurgy, unrelated to religion or politics did not suffer a severe change during the Middle Sican to Late Sican transition.Hayashida, Frances M. \\"The Pampa de Chaparri: Water, Land, and Politics on the North Coast of Peru.\\" Latin American Antiquity, September 2006: p. 243-263. Agriculture and irrigation were also not affected by the transition of political and religious power, as evidenced by the lack of effects on Pampa de Chaparri and numerous large urban hill-side settlements.Shimada 2000, p. 63 =T√∫cume= T√∫cume took on the religious and ceremonial prestige as the site of Sican claimed during the Middle Sican. The mounds and temples from the Middle Sican were continued into the Late Sican since the idea of mounds were not associated with the fall of the Middle Sican, only those mounds in Bat√°n Grande. The same types of ceremonial and religious artifacts made from the same materials were found at T√∫cume. The site grew enormously during its 250-year Late Sican occupation. By the time of the Chim√∫ conquest of the Lambayeque region in 1375, there were 26 major mounds and enclosures. The site is built on 220 hectares around the La Raya Mountain. T√∫cume is seen as the reorganization and reunification of the Sican elite and Sican population as a whole until the fall of the Sican to the Chim√∫.

It is the center of Ichnia Raion. Population is  History  The city got its name from the river named Ichena (or Ichen'), which was in time renamed into Ichen‚Äôka. The first information about Ichnia dates back to the 14th century. From the 14th to 16th centuries, it was ruled by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. In the middle of the 16th century, Ichnia was granted with the status of a market town. In 1666, a town hall was built. Probably at this time, the Ichnia's castle was built. Residents of the city participated in the struggle against the Swedish army of Charles XII of Sweden during the Great Northern War. In 1748, Ichnia's 20 households belonged to Knyaz N. Saakadze, and 119 households - Colonel from Pryluky G. Galagan. The town had a distillery, 6 water mills, and a brickyard. Vasily Sternberg. Fair in Ichnia (1830s) As of 1788, three annual fairs were held in Ichnia, in which residents traded bread, cattle, victuals, and wooden utensils. There were four schools in Ichnia in the 18th century. In 1812, the Cossacks of Ichnia fought in the Chernigov Regiment during French invasion of Russia. At the beginning of the 19th century, landowner G. Galagan founded a cloth factory in the town, as well as a sugar factory, 2 distilleries, brick factories, and saltpeter factories. In 1894, the town was included into a local railroad connection. In 1897, there were four stone churches. The town operated a post office, hospital, rural and ministerial school, and library. In 1957, Ichnia received the status of a town. Nowadays, the leading industry in Ichnia is the food industry (alcohol, tobacco, feed mill, canning, and cheese-milk powder). In October 2018, Ichnya became an epicenter of massive fire following an explosion at the munitions depot of the 6th Arsenal (military unit A-1479). More than 12,500 people were evacuated and a no-fly zone was established. The fire lasted for 23 days.

It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index but was acquired by the Pearl Group in May 2008. History Early history The Resolution Life group was formed in 2004 to provide a vehicle for life funds that have been closed to new business, but have liabilities extending many years into the future, nicknamed zombie funds. The first purchase was the life insurance business of Royal & SunAlliance, followed by the purchase of Swiss Life's UK business. In September 2005, Resolution Life merged with the FTSE company Britannic Group, who had closed to new business in 2003. In 2006, the merged group bought the life business of Abbey National, a transaction of ¬£3.6 billion that brought entry into the FTSE 100.Company history On May 30, 2007, Resolution announced a strategic partnership with Capita which will result in the transfer of approximately two thousand staff in Customer Services and IT and phased outsourcing of back- office customer services to India.Capita strategic partnership announcement Takeover by Pearl Group On July 25, 2007, Resolution agreed a merger with Friends Provident to create a new entity, Friends Financial, with a market cap of circa ¬£8.6Bn, however by September 2007 it was announced that Hugh Osmond's Pearl Group, a critic of the proposed merger with Friends Provident, had undergone talks with Swiss Re about a potential deal to take over Resolution, but talks broke down. On 10 October 2007, Pearl made a formal offer of 660 pence per share, worth approximately ¬£4.5 billion, in conjunction with the Royal London Mutual Insurance Society. Standard Life and Swiss Re also entered the bidding for Resolution, and for a brief period on October 26, 2007 their cash and shares bid, worth ¬£4.9 billion was recommended by the board, which called off any deal with Friends Provident. Within a short space of time, Pearl came back with an all-cash offer of 720 pence per share. In addition, Hugh Osmond, chief executive of Pearl, now controlled a stake of 24.1% of Resolution's ordinary shares, which would have effectively blocked any planned merger from Standard Life as it would have required 75% approval from shareholders. In mid-November 2007, Standard Life pulled out of the merger and the offer from Pearl was recommended by the board to shareholders. At the extraordinary general meeting, held on January 8, 2008, the shareholders overwhelmingly agreed to the merger. Having been approved by the Financial Services Authority in mid-April 2008, the acquisition was completed on 1 May 2008. The Scottish Provident and Scottish Provident International brands and various in-force blocks of policies were taken over by the Royal London Group, with the rest going to Pearl. The Resolution brand was retained by Clive Cowdery. Relaunch as an investment vehicle Resolution was relaunched by Clive Cowdery as an investment acquisition vehicle in December 2008 and resumed talks with Friends Provident in July 2009 but was rejected twice, though Friends Provident eventually agreed to a takeover in August 2009.

Early life and education Born in Cranwell, Lincolnshire, in 1937, Cassidy grew up in Sydney and attended the Our Lady of Mercy College in Parramatta, a suburb of Sydney. She began her medical studies at the University of Sydney and completed them at Somerville College, Oxford in 1963. She wanted to become a plastic surgeon but could not keep up with the 90-hour week, so she left school. Career Cassidy went to practice medicine in Chile during the government of Salvador Allende. In 1975, Cassidy was caught up in the violence of the Pinochet regime. She gave medical care to Nelson Gutierrez, a political opponent of the new regime who was being sought by the police. As a result, she was herself arrested on 1 November 1975 by the Chilean secret police, the DINA, and kept in custody without trial. During the early part of her custody, she was severely tortured in the notorious Villa Grimaldi near Santiago, Chile, to force her to disclose information about her patient and her other contacts. Later in 1975, Cassidy was released from custody and returned to the UK with the assistance of the British government and Roberto Kozak. Her subsequent description of her experiences, including her account of her torture on the parrilla and her imprisonment, did much to bring to the attention of the UK public the widespread human rights abuses that were occurring at the time in Chile. Her story appeared in news media and in her book, Audacity to Believe.Cassidy, Sheila (1977). Audacity To Believe, Collins, London. .

Produced by Rick Rubin whose concept was to record an unadvertised performance in a small club with a small crowd, many of whom would not necessarily be fans of Clay's act. Clay chose a New York club owned by comedian Rodney Dangerfield, Dangerfield's, to record during the holiday season. A sequel, The Day the Laughter Died, Part II was released in 1993. The album is largely improvisational, with Clay interacting with the audience over the course of over an hour and a half. The topics run through his usual gamut of sex, relationships between men and women, masculinity and popular culture. Unlike his prior recordings, the jokes are delivered intentionally flat and raw as to offend and alienate the audience, turning the performance into the joke itself.http://www.complex.com/music/2012/03/25-best- rick-rubin-songs/hour-back-get-it Clay's performance results in several members of the audience leaving the show early, some insulting him as they leave.

Stella studied at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome, and made her debut in Spoleto, as Leonora in Il trovatore, in 1950, and appeared at the Rome Opera in 1951, as Leonora in La forza del destino. She quickly sang throughout Italy, Florence, Naples, Parma, Turin, Catania, Verona, Venice, etc., and made her debut at La Scala in Milan, as Desdemona in Verdi's Otello, in 1954, where she sang regularly to great acclaim until 1963, in roles such as Violetta in La traviata, Elisabetta in Don Carlo, Amelia in Un ballo in maschera, the title roles in Aida and Tosca, Mimi in La boh√®me, Maddalena in Andrea Ch√©nier, Cio-Cio-San in Madama Butterfly, etc. In 1955, she made her debuts at the Vienna State Opera, the Royal Opera House in London, the Palais Garnier in Paris, La Monnaie in Brussels, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and the following year, at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where she successfully sang until 1960. In 1958 she had a particular success in a new Metropolitan production of Madama Butterfly designed in the manner of Japanese woodblock prints. Her assimilation of Japanese physicality and gesture was particularly praised. Her Leonore in Il Trovatore was also presented in a new production at the Metropolitan to public and critical acclaim. Stella was an elegant, glamorous figure on stage and an accomplished actress. Stella, like so many notable artists of the 1950s and 60s, was somewhat eclipsed by the competition between Maria Callas and Renata Tebaldi, but she did have a notable career and left several very worthwhile recordings, including works such as Linda di Chamounix, La battaglia di Legnano, L'Africaine, and Simon Boccanegra. She appeared in an Italian television production of Andrea Ch√©nier, opposite Mario del Monaco and Giuseppe Taddei in 1955, recently released on DVD.

Early life and first marriages Elizabeth was the only child of , Voivode of Sandomierz, and , daughter of Jan of Melsztyn and godmother of King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço. Elizabeth's uncle Spytek of Melsztyn was an influential figure in Jagie≈Ç≈Ço's court. When her father died in 1384 or 1385, Elizabeth inherited his vast estates, which included Pilica and ≈Åa≈Ñcut. Her dramatic early life was described by Jan D≈Çugosz, but authenticity of that account is doubtful as it is not corroborated by other sources and D≈Çugosz did not provide dates. It is possible that the account was invented to discredit the unpopular queen. According to D≈Çugosz, Elizabeth was kidnapped by Wise≈Ç Czambor from Moravia. Possibly Czambor wanted to marry Elizabeth to obtain her riches. She was kidnapped again by Jan (Ja≈Ñczyk) of Jiƒçina from Czambor's house. Czambor then traveled to Krak√≥w where he was murdered by Jan, who later received a permission from Jogaila to marry Elizabeth. It is unclear if she married Czambor or Jan, but even if she did, she was soon widowed. Around 1397, Elizabeth married , castellan of Nak≈Ço and a widower with at least three sons. The marriage provided a carrier boost to Granowski. He was sent on diplomatic missions to the Teutonic Knights and Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia. In 1409, he became starosta of Greater Poland and in 1410 commanded his own squad in the Battle of Grunwald. He died suddenly at the end of 1410. It is believed that he was poisoned. It is believed that Elizabeth and Granowski had two sons and three daughters. Marriage to W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço In March 1416, Queen Anna of Celje died leaving King Jogaila a widower with one surviving daughter. Polish nobility encouraged Jogaila to remarry both for political reasons and to secure a male heir. Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytautas proposed a marriage to his granddaughter Maria Vasilievna, daughter of Vasily I of Moscow. Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, proposed his niece Elisabeth, Duchess of Luxembourg. Therefore, it came as a surprise when Jogaila decided to marry Elizabeth Granowska, a middle-aged widow with few political connections and scandalous past. Bishop called her a \\"pig\\", while others dismayed over her age. In January 1417, Jogaila traveled to Lithuania and stopped in Liuboml to meet with his sister Alexandra, who was accompanied by Elizabeth Granowska. After a few days, Jogaila left Liuboml but not before showering Elizabeth with many expensive gifts. It was not the first time they met as Elizabeth's family frequented Jogaila's court. In March 1417, on his way back to Poland, Jogaila stopped in ≈Åa≈Ñcut, Elizabeth's domain. It appears that the marriage decision, perhaps engineered by Alexandra, was made there. They married on 2 May 1417 in Sanok, but her coronation was postponed until 19 November due to resistance from the Polish nobility. They argued that the real queen was Princess Hedwig Jagiellon or that Elizabeth was a \\"spiritual sister\\" of Jogaila as her mother was his godmother. Jogaila obtained a dispensation from the Council of Constance. Despite political disapproval, it appears that the marriage was happy. Elizabeth often accompanied her husband on various trips, but had little political sway. She fell ill, possibly with tuberculosis, in early 1419 and had trouble keeping up with her husband's travels. She died in May 1420 and was buried in the Wawel Cathedral. However, her body was later moved to make way for Stephen B√°thory and the subsequent burial place is not known.

He came to prominence in 1997 as the president of the Slovenian retail company Mercator. From October 2006 to December 2011, he was mayor of Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. In October 2011, he established the Positive Slovenia party, which won the plurality of votes at the early Slovenian 2011 parliamentary election. His function as a mayor ceased on 21 December 2011, when he became a deputy in the National Assembly. After he failed to be elected as the prime minister in the National Assembly, he was re-elected as the mayor of Ljubljana and retook the position on 11 April 2012. He is the first mayor of Ljubljana to have served two terms since the end of World War II. Early life Jankoviƒá was born in the village of Saraorci near the town of Smederevo in Serbia, then part of the Yugoslavia, to a Serb father and a Slovene mother. His parents moved to Slovenia for a better life, and left their son in poverty with his grandmother in Saraorci. In this time, his sister Jagoda was born. After finishing fourth grade of the primary school in 1964, he moved to Ljubljana so that he could learn English instead of Russian. He did not know Slovenian at the time. In Ljubljana, he attended the Valentin Vodnik Primary School in ≈†i≈°ka and the Kette and Murn Primary School in Kodeljevo in the last grade. Then, he attended the Poljane High School, where he learned French. There, he met his wife Mija, the cousin of Gregor Virant, who later became an influential politician. In 1971, he entered the Faculty of Economics in Ljubljana, from which he graduated in 1980 with the thesis \\"Agricultural Goods Wheelers-Dealers in Our Country\\" (). During study, he built a house with the money he earned working for the AMD Moste (Auto-Moto Society Moste), with bookkeeping and with cargo transportation. In 1974, he married Mija and later had two children with her, Damijan and Jure. Career as manager Jankoviƒá started his career in 1978 in the investment sector of Post of Slovenia (which is deficient information, as at the time the postal, telephone and telegraph services were still united within PTT Slovenija with several regional PTT branches and it is not clear in which of these organizations Jankoviƒá was employed). Since 1979 till 1984, he was a representative of the company Griƒç Zagreb, and was appointed the acting director of the tourism and trade company Mercator Investa in 1984. As the company sponsors the basketball club Smelt Olimpija, he became also the vice- president of the club. Later, he became the general director of the company. After the merge of Mercator Investa and Mercator In≈æeniring in 1988, he was not appointed the director of the joint company, so he left. Since 1988 till 1990, he was the vice-director of SOZD Emona and the acting director of Emona- VPS. In December 1988, he survived a severe car crash without major injuries. In 1990, as he was not appointed the director of Emona, he founded the civil engineering and interior design company Electa and remained its director till 1997. He moved to Golovec where he jogged a lot. Electa sponsored several junior sports teams. Jankoviƒá became the main sponsor in 1992 and the president of the handball club Krim, later renamed to HC Krim Electa. The club made extraordinary progress and then won the national handball cup for several years. In 1995, Jankoviƒá stepped down from the position of the president of the club due to his dissatisfaction with the Ljubljana city distribution of money to clubs. In 1996, he became the president of the Handball Federation of Slovenia. He retained the position till 2004. In 1995, Jankoviƒá entered the Supervisory Board of Mercator as the representative of the Slovenian Compensation Company (, SOD), which was led at the time by Tone Rop, the then Slovenian Minister of Labour and the president of the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia (LDS). According to the magazine Mladina, the main lobbyist for the entry of Jankoviƒá into Mercator was Peter Rigl, who was also member of LDS. In 1997, after the Supervisory Board of the Slovenian retail company Mercator deposed Kazimir ≈Ωivko Pregelj as the chairman, due partly to the 2.5 billion tolars debt of the company, the board appointed Jankoviƒá as the new director. In 2002, a recording by POP TV was published, in which Rop scolded at Jankoviƒá that he himself had enabled Jankoviƒá to enter Mercator. Both of them claimed later that the recording had been torn out of context, and that it had been about the entry into the supervisory board and not becoming the president of the company. According to Miran Goslar and Jankoviƒá himself, the appointment was not politically motivated but made exclusively by influential managers in Mercator. Goslar stated that not even one of the then politicians supported the appointment of Jankoviƒá. The plaque next to the entrance of the Bre≈æice Mercator mall commemorating the laying of the foundation stone by Zoran Jankoviƒá The entry of Jankoviƒá transformed the company Mercator to the biggest retail company in Slovenia and one of the biggest in the region. The company took over numerous companies, starting with Klas in 1998, and numerous others, among them the most controversial being the take-over of Emona Merkur. In August 1999, the first Mercator hypermarket was opened in ≈†i≈°ka. Despite being a director, Jankoviƒá actively helped his employees, for example with tidying shopping carts. In December 2000, Mercator opened its shops abroad for the first time, in Pula, Croatia, and Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in 2002, the largest one in Belgrade, Serbia. In 1999, Jankoviƒá became a member of the management board in the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia (, ), where he was appreciated as constructive and decisive. In February 2001, Jankoviƒá received a prize for extraordinary economic and business achievements by GZS. In September 2001, an article is published in Delo describing Electa as being severely indebted, not paying its subcontractors, and making profit from business with Mercator. Several lawsuits were filed in but later withdrawn. Despite the accusations, Jankoviƒá remained the director of Mercator and Electa fulfilled its obligations. In 2002, he was proclaimed the manager of the year by the management magazine Manager. In 2003, Jankoviƒá started his second term in Mercator. During this term, he actively opposed the act restricting the use of alcohol that prohibited the sale of alcohol to the youth and to drunk people and the sale of alcohol after 9 pm. He also opposed the closure of shops on Sundays, which was in September 2003 supported on a referendum. The magazine Kapital bestowed him with the title \\"The best director 2003\\" (). At the end of 2003, Mercator took over ≈Ωivila. In January 2004, Slovenia hosted the 2004 European Men's Handball Championship and Jankoviƒá announced his candidacy for the president of the European Handball Federation. He was a favourite at first but fell out already after the first round. In 2005, SOD and KAD () sold a little less than 30% of Mercator to two suppliers of Mercator, Istrabenz and Pivovarna La≈°ko. On 15 November 2005, the new owners removed Jankoviƒá from his position for non-culpable reasons and appointed ≈Ωiga Debeljak, the financial director of Gorenje. Jankoviƒá later accused Prime Minister Janez Jan≈°a of having conspired to achieve his removal as part of a political deal with the new owners of Mercator. Mayor of Ljubljana Borut Pahor, Angela Merkel and Jankoviƒá in Ljubljana Town Hall In September 2006, Jankoviƒá announced his intent to run for the office of mayor of Ljubljana as an independent candidate. He was elected with a landslide in the first round on 22 October 2006, with almost 63% of the popular vote. His list won 23 out of 45 seats in the city council, virtually guaranteeing the stability of his administration. He took the office on 17 November 2006. There were numerous campaign promises made before the elections ‚Äì including the most prominent one, the building of the Sto≈æice Stadium, a new central football stadium and indoor sports arena, which was built in 2010, solving the decades- old issue of Ljubljana not having such facilities. On 10 October 2010, Jankoviƒá was re-elected for another 4-year term, receiving almost 65% of the popular vote. His list won 25 out of 45 seats in the city council. The downtown of Ljubljana has been significantly redesigned during his terms, and closed for traffic. However, the debt of the City Municipality of Ljubljana significantly increased, and many promises were not or were only partly realised. During his term as the mayor of Ljubljana, the daily newspaper Finance accused Jankoviƒá of having abused his powers as mayor of Ljubljana to create economic benefits for his sons. Jankoviƒá rejected these accusations as completely false and based on the journalists' imagination. At a celebration of his father's second victory at the Ljubljana local elections, his younger son Jure Jankoviƒá publicly threatened to murder the Finance journalist Jaka Elikan, who investigated and wrote about the alleged corruption of the Jankoviƒá family and who was present at the event; the threat was recorded by the journalists and made public. Zoran Jankoviƒá publicly reacted to the threat by rejecting any use of violence and apologizing for his son's words; at the same time, however, he accused the journalist of being excessively provocative. Following the media allegations of Jankoviƒá's abuse of power to create economic benefit for his son Jure, an Investigation Commission was formed by the Slovenian National Assembly, headed by the opposition MP Alenka Jeraj. In its final report, the Commission stated that there is a reasonable suspicion that Zoran Jankoviƒá abused his power as Mayor of Ljubljana. In an interview to the Croatian daily newspaper Veƒçernji list in October 2010, Jankoviƒá stated corruption is not an important problem in Slovenia; this statement caused some controversy in the Slovenian media, and triggered a negative public response by the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption. Entry into national politics On 11 October 2011, Jankoviƒá announced his candidacy for prime minister with his own party, Positive Slovenia, to \\"make a better world for all Slovenians, beyond current political doctrines and practices\\". When asked what made him decide to run for the Slovenian parliamentary election, Jankoviƒá replied that his final decision was made upon his wife's insistence that he should run in order to protect their children from unjust persecution. The statement was made in regard of the committee established by the Slovenian National Assembly in order to investigate Jankoviƒá's alleged misuse of power as mayor of Ljubljana; his both sons were summoned to testify at the committee, both availing themselves with the right to silence. The influential investigative journalist Bojan Traven raised a theory, according to which Jankoviƒá's entry into state politics was conditioned by the concern over the financial status of his family. On 4 December, Positive Slovenia won the election with 28.51% of votes, thus gaining 28 seats out of 90 in the Assembly. In his first responses, Jankoviƒá said that the victory of his party was a proof that Slovenians wanted an efficient state and that he would focus on economic growth. Shortly after the unofficial results became available, he stated he would invite all the parties to coalition talks. Analysts predicted the most likely coalition would consist of Positive Slovenia (PS), Social Democrats (SD), Gregor Virant's Civic List (LGV) and Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia (DeSUS). On 5 January 2012, President Danilo T√ºrk proposed Jankoviƒá as the candidate to form a government to the National Assembly. Two days before the scheduled voting, the Slovenian Association of Journalists and Commentators, the second largest journalists' association in the country, issued a statement raising the concern that Jankoviƒá might abuse his power as prime minister by curtailing the freedom of media through intimidation. A coalition agreement between PS, SD, LGV and DeSUS was initialled on 7 January. However, in the evening of 9 January, LGV announced it would not support Jankoviƒá as the new prime minister and also not join his coalition, due to large differences in the programs of the parties. On 11 January, Jankoviƒá was not elected as the new prime minister by the National Assembly. In a secret ballot, his candidacy only gained the support of 42 deputies, two less than expected prior to the voting, and four short of the absolute majority needed for his election. Following the election of Janez Jan≈°a as the prime minister in the second round of the voting, Positive Slovenia became an opposition party. When Jankoviƒá got elected to the National Assembly, his function as the Mayor of Ljubljana ceased because of incompatibility of the two functions. In February, Jankoviƒá announced he decided to run for the position of Mayor of Ljubljana again. He participated at the by-election for the mayor of Ljubljana on 25 March 2012 and was elected for the continuation of the second term with 61% of votes. He retook the leadership of the city council on 11 April 2012. His mandate of a deputy ceased on 16 April 2012. On 19 April, he was replaced by the former athlete Alenka Bikar. On 17 January 2013, Alenka Bratu≈°ek was replaced Jankoviƒá as president of the Positive Slovenia party after Jankoviƒá temporarily renounced all functions in the party following allegations raised by the official Commission for the Prevention of Corruption report. On 26 April 2014, Zoran Jankoviƒá was again voted as the president of the party with 422 votes for out of 763 voters; his only opponent, Alenka Bratu≈°ek, received 338 votes. On 29 April 2014 Bratu≈°ek resigned from Positive Slovenia, and also announced her resignation as Prime Minister, to take effect on 5 May 2014. She became the first Slovenian Prime Minister to resign from office; her resignation went into effect on 8 May, and then on 31 May 2014 she formed her own party Alliance of Alenka Bratu≈°ek (Zavezni≈°tvo Alenke Bratu≈°ek; ZaAB).RTVSLO.si - V ≈æivo: Nastaja stranka Alenke Bratu≈°ek Public perception Throughout his presence in the public life, Jankoviƒá has been mired in scandals. This is alleged by his detractors and acknowledged by his sympathisers. The latter say that while every politician is corrupt, at least Jankoviƒá is \\"a man of action\\" and has finally done something for residents of Ljubljana. This normally refers to him having built the Sto≈æice stadium. His opponents point out, however, that he built it with taxpayers' money and that his family and companies owned by them have benefited to the tune of many millions from backhanders paid by building contractors engaged to construct it, while subcontractors were not paid for their work, supposedly for lack of funds. In 1998, the left liberal magazine Mladina accused Jankoviƒá of having used his influence as businessman in order to secure his younger son's participation in the spring matura state exams, although he should have first passed two retake exams. In October 2011, a whole episode of the talk political show Pogledi Slovenije, aired by the national broadcaster RTV Slovenija, was focused on Jankoviƒá's alleged nepotism. He has been a target of satire, especially by the popular comedian Denis Avdiƒá. In May 2012 it was revealed that the Slovene tax administration is investigating how 400 thousand out of the 15 million euros, paid by the City of Ljubljana to the Sto≈æice Sports Park construction contractor (GREP), ended on the account of the KLM Nalo≈æbe company, which is majority-owned by Zoran Jankoviƒá. Jankoviƒá and his son Jure are under investigation by the tax authorities and the police in connection with the Cypriot company Blue Train of which Jure Jankoviƒá has been revealed to be a director. Nevertheless, Ljubljana's mayor enjoys considerable electoral support, principally from the large Serbian minority in Ljubljana, due to his own Serb heritage. According to left-wing media, he is one of the most influential people in the country. In the beginning of 2011, media reported that he, the President Danilo T√ºrk, and another two left-wing politicians, Gregor Golobiƒç and Milan Kuƒçan, form the \\"gang of four\\", which has the biggest influence on the most important decisions in Slovenia.

Marshall's company built under subcontract the famous droop nose for Concorde.  Sport  In addition to his interest in aeronautics, Sir Arthur also became a gifted sportsman early in his life and tried out for a place on the British team at the 1924 Olympics in Paris, a team which was depicted in the 1981 Oscar-winning film Chariots of Fire. He helped to stage the \\"Chariots of Fire\\" charity run through Cambridge for a trophy named in his honour.  Honours  Marshall was appointed an OBE in 1948, and was knighted in 1974. In 1931, he married Rosemary Dimsdale. The couple had three children, including Michael Marshall, who took over the running of the company upon Sir Arthur's retirement. Lady Marshall died on 24 June 1988. On the death of James Stillman Rockefeller in August 2004 he became the oldest living Olympic athlete.  Death  He died in the early hours of 16 March 2007 at his home near Linton in Cambridgeshire, aged 103. To commemorate Sir Arthur's lifelong interest in aviation, the Marshall family donated a trophy to the Air Training Corps to be presented to \\"The Most Improved Squadron in the ATC over a Protracted Period of Time\\". 1296 (Turiff) Squadron won the inaugural Trophy in 2008. 78 (Wembley) Squadron Air Training Corps won the Sir Arthur Marshall Trophy in 2009. 2227 (Mid Gwendraeth) Squadron won the Sir Arthur Marshall trophy in 2010. 2160 (Sleaford) Squadron won the Sir Arthur Marshall Trophy in 2011. 50F (Lambeth) Squadron won the Sir Arthur Marshall Trophy in 2012. 115 (Peterborough) Squadron won the Sir Arthur Marshall Trophy in 2013 External links *Article from Marshall Web Site on Sir Arthur's 100th Birthday Celebration *Article from Air-Scene UK *Obituary, The Guardian, 26 March 2007 Category:1903 births Category:2007 deaths Category:English aerospace engineers Category:English businesspeople Category:English centenarians Category:Alumni of Jesus College, Cambridge Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:People educated at The Perse School Category:People educated at Tonbridge School Category:People from Cambridge Category:People from Linton, Cambridgeshire ","title":"Arthur Marshall (engineer)"},{"id":"6874714","text":"Bobr√≥vycja (), is the city center of Bobrovytsia Raion within Chernihiv Oblast (province) of Ukraine.

Go north a few miles up the Dnieper river to where the Desna River feeds into it. The Desna comes from the north where, at a city Chernihiv, it curves east. Along this course, where the river bulges southward, is Borzna. More specifically, it is located next to an international highway connecting Kyiv and Moscow (E101). Chernihiv is about away. Borzna has no railway (the nearest railway stations being Doch () with north-south routes and Plysky () with west-east routes.

According to the census of 1859 there were total population of the town of Borzna is about 8,453. Because of its distance from the railway (14 km), it has not grown (1897 pop 8,582). From 1923 Borzna is the administrative center of the Borznyanskyi raion (Borzna district). In World War II, the town was occupied by Nazi Germany from September 11, 1941 to September 7, 1943. On January 18, 1942, the Germans rounded up all the local Jews they could find and massacred them at Shapovalivka. 126 people were killed, 179 removed to Germany.

Discovery 6Q0B44E was first observed by Catalina Sky Survey researchers at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory of the University of Arizona on 28 August 2006. The sighting was confirmed the next day by observations at the Siding Spring Survey and Table Mountain Observatory. Properties The object is just a few metres across and has been provisionally classified as artificial. 6Q0B44E orbits Earth between 585,000 and 983,000 km, which is 2 to 3 times the distance of the Moon's orbit, over a period of 80 days. Its density has been estimated at around 15 kg/m, too low for natural rock and comparable to that expected for an empty fuel tank. 6Q0B44E was spotted at what is believed to be the brightest part of its orbit, at 19th magnitude. As the object moves away from Earth, its brightness falls on a six-month cycle down to 28th magnitude, severely limiting study of its composition. Ephemerides calculated from the observations suggest that 6Q0B44E probably entered the Earth‚ÄìMoon system between 2001 and 2003, although it may have arrived up to a decade earlier. Similarities between the discoveries of 6Q0B44E and J002E3, now believed to be part of the Apollo 12 rocket, have led some astronomers to speculate that 6Q0B44E may be another relic of human space exploration which has returned to Earth orbit. However, no space mission has been identified as the source of 6Q0B44E.

Elections were held in Florida's 1st through 25th congressional districts. Florida is known to be a moderate-to-conservative state, with more liberals residing in South Florida, and moderates and conservatives dominating both the northern and central regions of Florida, as well as a strong Republican base in Cuban-American portions of Miami. A former Florida Secretary of State made famous in the 2000 presidential election challenged incumbent Senator Bill Nelson, and ended up losing to Nelson. Democrats set their sights on two districts in the Sarasota and Tampa area (the open seats of both Harris and the retiring Mike Bilirakis, respectively), and also on a South Florida district held by one of the Sunshine State's longest-serving congressmen. The primary was held on September 5, 2006. The popularity of outgoing Governor Jeb Bush aided their gubernatorial candidate, Attorney General Charlie Crist and helped Republicans win downballot, including Crist's newly elected successor at the Attorney General position, former Rep. Bill McCollum. The following Congresspeople went unopposed in the 2006 election and thus their election is not reported below: *Allen Boyd (D-FL-02) *Corrine Brown (D-FL-03) *Robert Wexler (D-FL-19) *Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL-20) *Alcee Hastings (D-FL-23) Overview { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" - e9e9e9;\\" ! colspan=\\"6\\"  United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2006http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2006/2006Stat.htm#9 - eee; text-align:center;\\" ! colspan=2 style=\\"width: 15em\\" Party ! style=\\"width: 5em\\" Votes ! style=\\"width: 7em\\" Percentage ! style=\\"width: 5em\\" Seats ! style=\\"width: 5em\\" +/‚Äì - ! f33; width:3px;\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Republican  right;\\" 2,182,833  right;\\" 56.67%  right;\\" 16  right;\\" -2 - ! 33f; width:3px;\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Democratic  right;\\" 1,599,968  right;\\" 41.54%  right;\\" 9  right;\\" +2 - ! ddd; width:3px;\\"  style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Independents  right;\\" 69,141  right;\\" 1.79%  right;\\" 0  right;\\" ‚Äî - eee; text-align:right;\\"  colspan=\\"2\\" Totals  3,851,942  100.00%  25  ‚Äî } District 1 thumb Three-term incumbent Republican Congressman Jeff Miller had an easy time seeking re-election in this staunchly conservative district based in the Florida Panhandle. Miller, who was initially elected in a special election in 2001 to replace Joe Scarborough, took advantage of this district‚Äôs large military population based around the Naval Air Station Pensacola with his membership on the House Veterans Affairs Committee and the naturally conservative tendencies of western Florida to easily defeat Democratic challenger Joe Roberts. District 4 thumb Incumbent Republican Congressman Ander Crenshaw, a fixture in Florida politics since the 1970s, has represented this North Florida and Jacksonville-based district since 2001. Given the district‚Äôs strong Republican lean, Crenshaw faced no real challenge in Democratic nominee Robert Harms and easily won another term. District 5 thumb Incumbent Republican Congressman Ginny Brown-Waite was able to take advantage of a Republican wave and a gerrymander in her favor to defeat Democratic Congresswoman Karen Thurman to win a first term in 2002. Seeking a third term, Brown-Waite faced challenger John Russell, whom he handily beat, albeit by a thinner margin than she is used to in this fairly conservative district. District 6 thumb Encompassing North Central Florida, this conservative district is represented by nine-term incumbent Republican Congressman Cliff Stearns. Stearns, seeking a tenth term, faced off against Democratic candidate David Bruderly. Though Stearns defeated Bruderly by a wide margin, it was not the margin of victory that Stearns is used to in this gerrymandered district. District 7 thumb Incumbent Republican Congressman John Mica, initially elected in 1992, sought his eighth term in this conservative district that stretches along the coast of Florida from St. Augustine to Daytona Beach and peeks into the Orlando Metropolitan Area. Mica defeated Democratic candidate John Chagnon in a landslide. District 8 thumb Republican Congressman Ric Keller, seeking a fourth term in this moderately conservative, Central Florida-based district, faced off against businessman Charlie Stuart, a moderate Democrat. Though Keller held onto his seat in the midst of a Democratic wave that was sweeping the country, he won by only a few points. Democratic primary * Charlie Stuart, businessman * Alan Grayson, war contractor attorney * Homer Hartage, Orange County Commissioner  Republican primary  *Ric Keller, incumbent U.S. Congressman *Elizabeth Doran, businesswoman  General election  Incumbent Republican Congressman Ric Keller, best known for his Cheeseburger Bill, which prevented customers from suing fast food chains for health problems, decided to seek a fourth term in Congress. Charlie Stuart, a marketing consultant, an Orange County, Florida native and member of a prominent Orlando family, was nominated by the Democratic Party to face Keller. Stuart was touted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as a top longshot candidate and received the backing of local figures such as Congressman Allen Boyd, ex- Orlando mayors Glenda Hood and Bill Frederick and present Orlando mayor Buddy Dyer, as well as national ones such as former Virginia Governor Mark Warner. District 9 thumb After serving twelve terms in the United States Congress, Republican incumbent Congressman Michael Bilirakis declined to run for re- election. His son, Gus Bilirakis, a member of the Florida House of Representatives emerged as the Republican nominee and squared off against Phyllis Busansky, the Democratic nominee and a former Hillsborough County Commissioner. The district has a tilt towards electing Republicans, so Busansky‚Äôs campaign was not given much of a chance at first. As the campaign progressed, however, it received national attention from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Though Bilirakis defeated Busansky by a ten point margin, Busansky‚Äôs performance was a large improvement over past years and outperformed her expected performance in the polls.http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReportPopup.aspx?g=20103043-8651-4b50-95b0-2fceda2d71a0&q;=31808 District 10 thumb In this district, which is the only congressional district in the state to lie exclusively in one county, has been represented by incumbent Republican Congressman Bill Young for several decades. A former Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Young has been overwhelmingly re-elected year after year. In 2006, despite the moderate nature of his district and the acidic environment for Republicans nationwide, Congressman Young swamped Democratic nominee Samm Simpson. District 11 thumb Rather than seek a sixth term in this liberal district based in Tampa, incumbent Democratic Congressman Jim Davis opted to run for Governor, creating an open seat. Hillsborough County Commissioner Kathy Castor, the daughter of renowned Florida politician Betty Castor, ran for the seat and won the Democratic nomination, defeating Florida State Senate Minority Leader Les Miller. She faced Republican candidate Eddie Adams, an architect, in the general election, which she won by a convincing margin. District 12 thumb Incumbent Republican Congressman Adam Putnam, a member of the Republican leadership in the House, sought and easily won a fourth term in Congress, defeating independent candidates Joe Viscusi and Ed Bowlin. District 13 thumb Two- term incumbent Republican Congresswoman Katherine Harris opted to run for Senate rather than seek a third term, creating an open seat. The 13th district, based in Southwest Florida, is fairly conservative, but a competitive race emerged between the Republican nominee, car dealership owner Vern Buchanan, and the Democratic nominee, banking executive Christine Jennings. Though Buchanan appeared to be victorious on election day by a 350 vote margin, Jennings requested a recount. Though the recount did not change the outcome of the race, Jennings filed additional complaints due to the fact that 13% of Sarasota County residents did not vote in the Congressional election, an unusually high number and the fact that the touch-screen machines did not provide a paper trail.\\"Another election mess in Florida\\", The Economist, December 9, 2006 Believing the matter to be unsettled, Jennings sued to challenge the results of the election in court, noting the \\"pervasive malfunctioning of electronic voting machines.\\" A Florida circuit judge rejected her lawsuit in December 2006, ruling that her allegations of lost votes in Sarasota County were \\"conjecture.\\" Jennings met further failure in June 2007, when a Florida state appellate court ruled that Jennings did not meet the \\"extraordinary burden\\" of proving the lower court judge was wrong.\\"Jennings Dealt Setback In Voting Machine Challenge\\" , CBS local news (cbs4.com), June 18, 2007 Though Jennings fought the results further by appealing directly to the United States House of Representatives, this action, too, caused her to walk away empty-handed. After a three-person House task force was created to evaluate the election,Phil Davis, \\"House Panel to Consider Florida Contest\\", Associated Press, April 17, 2007 the task force voted along party lines to refer an investigation into Florida‚Äôs 13th district House race to the Government Accountability Office (GAO).Aaron Blake, \\"FL-13 task force will turn over investigation to GAO\\", The Hill, May 3, 2007 In February 2008, the committee and the House accepted the findings of the GAO that no machine error affected the outcome of the election, going a step further to pass HR 989, which affirmed the findings of the committee, accepted the results of the 2006 race and formally dismissed Jennings' challenge of the election's results. Jennings formally dropped her challenge shortly thereafter to focus on her 2008 rematch against Buchanan. District 14 thumb After winning his first Congressional election in 2004 to replace Porter Goss, incumbent Republican Congressman Connie Mack IV sought a second term in 2006. Mack's district, based in the Gulf Coast region of Florida, is solidly conservative and overwhelmingly gave the Congressman a second term over Democratic candidate Robert Neeld. District 15 thumb In this Space Coast- based district, incumbent Republican Congressman Dave Weldon sought election to a seventh term in Congress. This district, though undoubtedly conservative, gave Weldon a smaller margin of victory over Democratic nominee Robert Bowman in 2006 than in previous years, likely due to the anti-Republican sentiment nationwide. District 16 thumb Mark Foley Tim Mahoney Incumbent Republican Congressman Mark Foley was considered to be a shoo-in for re-election until the House page scandal involving Foley became public knowledge. The Congressman resigned on September 29, 2006, thus cancelling his re-election bid. The Republican Party of Florida selected Florida State Representative Joe Negron to replace Foley, though Foley's name remained on the ballot. Though Negron launched a successful campaign to urge voters to \\"Punch Foley for Joe!\\", indicating that voters should \\"punch\\" Foley's name on the ballot to vote for Negron, he was ultimately unsuccessful on election day and fell to Democratic nominee and businessman Tim Mahoney. One poll taken by Hamilton Beattie on September 12, 2006, had Foley leading Tim Mahoney in a matchup by 48% for Foley to 35% for Mahoney .Polling Report According to the state of Florida, 42% of the voters in this district are registered Republicans, and 36% are registered Democrats. George W. Bush won this district with 52% of the vote in the 2000 presidential election, and with 54% of the vote in the 2004 presidential election. Mahoney has sharply criticized the Bush administration for overspending, general mismanagement, and its policies in Iraq. In August, General Wesley Clark endorsed the candidacy of Mahoney for Congress.Tim Mahoney for Florida On September 28, 2006, ABC News reported that Republican incumbent Mark Foley had sent email messages, from his personal AOL account, to a then-16-year-old former Congressional page, asking the page to send a photo of himself to Foley, among other things that were overtly sexual in nature. Mahoney has called for a full investigation of Foley's actions. The next day Foley submitted a letter of resignation from Congress on September 29, 2006 in the wake of news reports about the communications. Republicans' hold on Mark Foley's seat went \\"from safe to shaky overnight.\\" On October 2, 2006, the Florida Republican Party Executive Board selected state representative Joe Negron as Mahoney's new opponent. However, Negron's name did not appear on the ballot so he only received votes cast for Foley, whose name remained on the ballot by law. On election day Mahoney narrowly defeated Negron by 1.8 percentage points.Florida Department of State - Election Results While Negron carried most of the more conservative areas of the district near Fort Myers, Mahoney carried the two largest counties in the district, Palm Beach and St. Lucie counties, by a combined margin of over 10,000 votes ‚Äî far more than the actual margin of victory. He was the first Democrat to represent the district since its creation in 1973 (it was the 10th District until 1983 and the 12th District until 1993). District 17 thumb This majority African-American district based in southern Broward County and eastern Miami- Dade County has a very strong Democratic tilt and has been represented by Congressman Kendrick Meek since his initial election in 2002 and was previously represented by Meek's mother, Carrie Meek, for ten years. Meek was overwhelmingly elected to a third term with no Republican or independent challenger. District 18 thumb Incumbent Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a respected member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, represents a marginally conservative district that encompasses much of Miami, the southern suburbs of Miami, and the entire Florida Keys. Seeking a tenth term in Congress, Ros-Lehtinen easily defeated Democratic nominee Dave Patlak in the general election. District 21 thumb Incumbent Republican Congressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart decided to run for an eighth term in Congress in this district composed of the western suburbs of Miami. Conservative due to the large presence of Cuban-Americans here, this district is a Hispanic- American majority district and has regularly sent Congressman Diaz-Balart back to Washington with solid victories. 2006 proved to be no different, and Diaz- Balart defeated Frank Gonzalez, though by a thinner margin than is usually achieved in this district. District 22 thumb This district, which stretches from northern Broward County to northern Palm Beach County, marginally leads towards the Democratic side, but incumbent Republican Congressman Clay Shaw's pragmatic and moderate profile in Congress enabled him to continually be re-elected. This year, however, Shaw faced difficulty in his bid for a fourteenth term. Florida State Senator Ron Klein, previously the Democratic leader in the Senate, ultimately defeated Shaw in the general election by a thin three-point margin. District 24 thumb Incumbent Republican Congressman Tom Feeney, initially elected in 2002 and re-elected unopposed in 2004 in this hand-crafted, gerrymandered district, hardly faced a challenge from Democratic candidate Clint Curtis. Feeney, however, was marred by allegations of corruption brought about by Curtis, a computer programmer who claimed that Feeney asked Curtis to create a software to \\"steal\\" votes using touch-screen voting machines. Feeney treated Curtis like a gadfly, sending out mailers featuring Curtis with a tin-foil hathttp://www.bradblog.com/?p=3616 and refusing to debate him. Polling, however, indicated that the race was tight, with a Zogby poll showing Feeney at a 45% level of support and Curtis attaining 43%.http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=206823 Ultimately, though, on election day, Feeney swamped Curtis, winning all four counties in the district. The surprisingly close race, however, indicated that Feeney could be brought down with a serious challenger. District 25 thumb This district, with a Hispanic-American majority and based in South Florida, has the tendency to support Republican candidates. Incumbent Republican Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart has represented the district since its creation in 2003 and had not faced a close call so far in his career. In 2006, however, though Diaz-Balart defeated Democratic opponent Michael Calderin by a solid margin, it was a thinner margin than usual.

These accommodations serve a traditional purpose of housing residents, but also serve as a long-term outreach incentive for new freshmen and faculty. Student housing also play a key role in developing campuswide social activities. Freshmen Accommodations Freshmen are typically assigned to live in either Middle Earth or Mesa Court; each residence hall is managed by a student Resident Advisor. Freshmen are no longer assigned to Arroyo Vista which accommodates continuing students in special theme houses, with the exception of those who are enrolled in the Campuswide Honors Program. Because of increasing enrollment in recent years, on-campus housing is only guaranteed for freshmen and transfer students. As of 2006, freshmen may take advantage of a two-year university housing guarantee. Furthermore, all freshmen receive academic advising, introductory university seminars, and freshmen-only activities through UCI's new First Year Initiative. Built in 1965, Mesa Court was the first housing complex established at UCI. Middle Earth started out with seven halls: Hobbiton, Isengard, Lorien, Mirkwood, Misty Mountain, Rivendell, and The Shire. Phase II later opened in 1989-1990 with additional thirteen halls: Balin, Harrowdale, Whispering Wood, Woodhall, Calmindon, Grey Havens, Aldor, Rohan, Gondolin, Snowbourn, Elrond, Shadowfax, and Quenya, Lastly in Fall 2000, Crickhollow, Evenstar, Oakenshield, and Valimar were opened. This contrasts with Mesa Court, which is built on expansive and hilly terrain (which sometimes deters non-essential travel) and located far from Ring Road and the central campus. Additionally, Mesa Court has a large number of high-volume residence halls on the far side of the campus, thus encouraging more socialization within specific dormitories themselves. However, each community has a distinct personality and pride all their own, with students identifying strongly with the community in which they reside. Additionally, it is not uncommon for students from both housing communities to intermingle and attend each other's events. Both Mesa Court and Middle Earth offer general use dormitories alongside theme dormitories. Themes vary widely and include Campuswide Honors, leadership, diversity, LGBT issues, school-or major- specific programs, drug abstinence, and the like. Incoming freshmen usually have their choice of dormitory theme (or lack thereof), and residence in any given dormitory offers significant dividents for those who actively participate in theme events. The general theme for the dorms in Mesa Court is based on Spanish names such as Laguna, Niebla and Jardin. As for Middle Earth the general theme is based on the popular series The Lord of the Rings. Some dorm names include Crickhollow and Evenstar. In Mesa Court, the dorms are arranged in suites of four or five rooms and a study room which is shared by the suite. The dorms are usually two or three stories with about three suites on each floor. Middle Earth includes hall houses with 45 ‚Äì 75 residents. Most rooms are double occupancy, but there are also triples in Phase II and Phase III halls. Quenya has 60 single rooms. The suites in the Middle Earth halls include about five - seven rooms which may be single-sex or coed. Each room is furnished with beds, wardrobes, desks, bookcases, and chairs. Each hall has access to a small kitchen, laundry facilities, and a common room with a TV. = Middle Earth = A dormitory in Middle Earth Middle Earth is a student housing complex at the University of California, Irvine. that houses approximately 1,690 students in 24 residence halls. The names of the halls and other facilities were selected from J.R.R. Tolkien's legendarium. Middle Earth is located along Ring Road, toward the core of the university's campus. The residence halls were built in three consecutive phases, beginning in 1974.. The first phase was designed by William Pereira. The last phase was completed in the summer of 2019 and officially opened September 16, 2019; although reported in the media as being called the two towers of Middle Earth, its two buildings are actually named Telperion and Laurelin, after the Two Trees of Valinor. Dining services Residents of Middle Earth and Mesa Court are required to choose and pay for a meal plan to complement their monthly rent expenses; voluntary meal plans are available to all other students and community members. These meal plans may be employed at one of many on-campus eateries such as Phoenix Grille, B.C.'s Cavern on the Green, and Bistro by the Bridge (through the use of debit ZotBucks), or in one of three dining halls. The two main dining halls, Mesa Commons and Pippins Commons, are located in Mesa Court and Middle Earth, respectively. Middle Earth also has a second dining hall, Brandywine, which specializes in freshly prepared food and quick entrees. Most students at UCI prefer Pippins Commons and Brandywine over Mesa Commons. Even though Pippins Commons and Brandywine are across campus from Mesa Court, many Mesa residents find it a treat, worthy of their time, to walk to Pippins and Brandywine just to eat! Thursday dinners are referred to as \\"premium night,\\" a tradition that offers patrons particularly high-quality meals (with past meals including grilled steak and crab legs). Every month, both of the Commons host a special birthday event or theme dinner (with past themes promoting foods from Hawaii, China, Latin America, and so forth). The Commons are both open throughout the weekday and twice during the weekends (for brunch and dinner); Brandywine is generally closed on weekends and offers a more limited weekday schedule. Other undergraduates Non-freshmen undergraduates live in Campus Village, Vista del Campo, Vista del Campo Norte, Camino del Sol, Arroyo Vista, Puerta Del Sol, or in one of the many apartment complexes off-campus. Anteater Express offers complimentary shuttle bus service to and from the five communities mentioned. Campus Village, located off Ring Road next to the School of Biological Sciences, offers 200 two- bedroom university apartments housing four students each. Residents of Campus Village are chosen and paired together via lottery. As an apartment complex, Campus Village uniquely employs active Resident Advisors (RAs). Vista del Campo (or \\"VDC\\" for short), is a modern on-campus apartment managed and owned by American Campus Communities, a private firm. Nearby is Vista del Campo Norte (or \\"Norte\\" for short), an extension of VDC, which was completed in 2006. Across from Vista del Campo Norte is Camino del Sol, the newest phase of undergraduate student housing at UCI, which is also managed by American Campus Communities. Camino del Sol will house its first residents in the Fall of 2010, and expects to house 1,198 students. Camino del Sol differs from VDC and Vista del Campo Norte in that Camino del Sol are townhomes. All three complexes have ultra-modern amenities such as swimming pools, private theaters, computer centers, and large recreation centers. They also employ Community Assistants (CAs) who manage the recreation centers and offer limited event planning. An additional housing complex has been added to the group of VDC, VDCN, and Camino named Puerta Del Sol. Originally built for graduate students, just opened up to undergraduates in 2011. Puerta Del Sol is built from the same company as Camino Del Sol and has similar features. Arroyo Vista is a community of 42 \\"houses\\" accommodating 16, 24, or 32 residents each. These houses combine the setting of a family-style residence with the amenities of a dormitory, which leads to strong resident camaraderie and dynamic community relationship. Prospective Arroyo Vista residents must meet the academic requirements of each house and write essays as part of the application process. The houses themselves are divided between academic themes and Greek interests and will only accept Freshman residents, if there's an overflow of students that cannot fit into Mesa Court or Middle Earth. Academic theme houses are sponsored by a department or on-campus organization, and incorporate courses or events relevant to the house theme (e.g. Biology or Campuswide Honors). Greek houses are allocated to fraternities and sororities, and can be compared to the equivalent of a Greek Row. And recently, Arroyo Vista introduced an International Village, which will combine international students with undergraduates into four adjacent theme houses. Social activities Planning All undergraduate student housing complexes at UC Irvine employ a two-tier structure for planning and implementing social activities. The first tier involves Resident Advisors (RAs) and House Assistants (HAs), whose responsibilities include planning social activities for their residents. These student staff members employ a housing budget to plan events that revolve around a housing theme (if it exists), an educational theme, a special event (such as a faculty lecture), and community development (social activities). RAs and HAs are required to host a set number of each aforementioned type of event each quarter; most often exceed this requirement. Many ad hoc and impromptu events are also organized and held outside of the housing office's requirements, making student staff relatively autonomous when implementing events. Accountability comes in the form of extensive paperwork documenting event descriptions, the number of participants, and all budgetary expenses. The second tier involves Community Programmers (CPs) and housing office professional staff, who plan complex-wide events. These individuals are responsible for developing community-wide events to create cohesion amongst all residents, regardless of the building in which they live. These events usually employ larger budgets and bigger publicity efforts, and must also be held accountable for planning and expenses. These complex-wide events may either be held in the local community center, open space, or available dormitory. Additionally, CPs and the professional staff are required to host a set number of monthly events. Residents of Vista del Campo rely upon Community Assistants (CAs), who are roughly analogous to Resident Advisors in Campus Village. However, CAs have far fewer responsibilities for social activities in comparison to student staff with UCI Student Housing. Additionally, specific dormitories or houses with special themes may have additional student staff on hand to plan events. For example, Sierra in Mesa Court employs Sierra Programmers (SPs) to articulate the dormitory's unique diversity theme, while the Campuswide Honors Program coordinates with its theme dormitories and theme houses for Campuswide Honors events. Traditions In addition to conducting hundreds of events every year, UCI Student Housing also retains many annual events that have become long-standing traditions. For instance, each housing complex offers a major dance every year. For Mesa Court and Middle Earth, these dances usually occur in the fall and are informal outings. In Arroyo Vista, the tradition is to host an annual semi-formal, with past events being hosted on a cruise ship and resort hotel. Another tradition is for Community Programmers to host a food delivery service during midterms and finals weeks. Residents may call the housing office to order food, which is then delivered to them for a fee. The income from this event is used to host large events throughout the year. Additional traditional events abound, with the list including a casino night, camping on the complex's open spaces, talent show, movie screenings, keynote professor lecture series, Halloween haunted house contest, and more. Graduates and faculty Graduate students are housed at the Verano Place, Palo Verde and Vista del Campo apartments. The first two cater to families as well as single students, and there are day care and child education facilities on campus. Both facilities, particularly Palo Verde, have undergone renovation and expansion to accommodate UCI's growing number of programs. These expanded facilities have led UCI to offer guaranteed housing to all incoming PhD and MFA students. Rather than the RA system many students are familiar with from undergraduate education, Verano and Palo Verde are led socially and politically by Residents' Councils. The expanded facilities and councils grew out of a number of protests, including the founding of a temporary graduate student tent city in the middle of Aldritch Park. Improved student governance helped to prevent later controversies such as the closure of Irine Meadows West and the introduction of undergraduates into graduate housing from similarly disrupting the campus. Faculty members and postdoctoral researchers may opt to live in Las Lomas and University Hills, an on-campus apartment complex and planned housing community aimed at the university's research professionals. Las Lomas is at the foot of University Hills, with the former constructed in 1982 and the latter in 1986. Both share open community areas, a Montessori school, parks, and bike paths. The Thomas T. and Elizabeth C. Tierney University House, in which UCI's chancellor resides, is located at the top of University Hills. During his first year as Vice Chancellor of Student Housing, Dr. Bill Zeller (replaced as Housing Director by Lisa Cornish, formerly responsible for Graduate Student Housing, in July 2008) lived on-campus in a Mesa Court freshman dormitory in order to experience on-campus housing from a student's perspective. On April 19, 2010 a two-year moratorium on cats was instituted. New Graduate Housing residents were not allowed to have cats in their apartments.\\"UCI Verano Place Housing\\" Accessed April 1, 2010\\"UCI Palo Verde Housing\\" Accessed April 1, 2010 The moratorium has since been lifted.Graduate & Family Housing Policies Accessed June 4, 2015 Residents of the UC Irvine student family housing units (Palo Verde and Verano Place) are zoned to the Irvine Unified School District.\\"Contact Us.\\" University of California Irvine.

Off campus Since approximately 36% of UCI students reside on campus, the majority either live in the area and commute, or must seek housing in nearby off-campus apartments. UCI Student Housing maintains a housing search office and roommate pairing service in the Administration building. However, nearly all the apartment complexes in Irvine are managed by The Irvine Company (also true in nearby Newport Beach and Tustin to a lesser extent), allowing residents to consolidate their search through one organization. Apartments in this area of Orange County have a reputation for high monthly rent, which is often offset by sharing accommodations with many roommates. One of the most popular off-campus housing locations for UCI students is Parkwest, which is located between Culver and University adjacent to the 405 freeway. Since hundreds of students live here, the ASUCI Express Shuttle devotes a fee-based bus line to servicing this apartment. Other locations notable for significant student populations include Berkeley/Columbia Court, Stanford Court, Harvard/Cornell Court, Dartmouth Court, Villa Sienna, and Turtle Rock, all of which are blocks away from the UCI campus. Other notable off-campus housing locations include Balboa Peninsula and Balboa Island, which is particularly popular with fraternities and sororities. Additionally, the absence of a Greek Row at UCI has resulted in numerous Greek chapter houses being scattered across Irvine and Newport Beach. Irvine Meadows West UCI once hosted Irvine Meadows West (IM West), a trailer park community that offered accommodations for about 111 undergraduates and graduates. It offered the most affordable housing in Orange County close to UCI (at $130/month) and an eclectic membership of students and their pets (including dogs, cats, rabbits, and parrots). IM West was unique in student housing in that it offered its residents democratic participation in the management and maintenance of the trailer park. For example, residents governed monthly rental rates, constructed a community center, and collaborated on park improvement projects. Residents also planned their own events without the assistance of a resident advisor or manager from the student housing office. On August 1, 2004, despite the vocal protests of its resident association, IM West was shut down after a five-year extension on its lease. UCI administrators decided to shut down the trailer park in order to build an extension to an adjacent parking lot between the School of Biological Sciences and School of Physical Sciences. Before Irvine Meadows West (IMW) was created, students parked RVs in the hills around the campus, which was thought to interfere with the wildlife preserve (coyotes, rabbits, deer, turkey vultures, and mountain lions sometimes entered IMW, and wild artichokes and endangered California poppies (state flower) grew in the hills). The illegal campers had no bathroom facilities or showers, so they were moved adjacent to the gymnasium. Some of the earliest residents of IMW lived there before the IMW was created. Residents, at one time, were eligible for the campus meal plan, but later were excluded.

History :This article describes the history of the 107.3 frequency in the Rochester area. For the history of radio stations broadcasting from the Bristol Mountain site prior to 2004, see WAIO. Early Years as Smooth Jazz The station now known as WNBL was granted a construction permit in 1991 as WFUD. On January 26, 1996, it signed on as WRCD, licensed to Honeoye Falls.Broadcasting Yearbook 1997 page B-303 WRCD was a sister station to 106.7 WMAX-FM (now WKGS), operating from the WMAX studios at 412 State Street in downtown Rochester and using a transmitter site in Bloomfield, on the southeastern edge of the Rochester market. Under original owner Auburn Cablevision, WRCD used a satellite-delivered smooth jazz format from Sony's SW programming service. In 1997, Auburn Cablevision sold WMAX-FM and WRCD to Jacor Communications. On February 19, 1998, at midnight, Jacor rearranged the formats on its new acquisitions. WRCD's smooth jazz was replaced by a rhythmic contemporary format called \\"Jam'n 107.3.\\" On March 1, 1998, WRCD changed its call sign to WMAX-FM, as the former WMAX-FM on 106.7 became WYSY.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-02-27.pdf Kiss 107 The \\"Jam'n\\" nickname gave way to a more mainstream Top 40 format as \\"Kiss 107\\" in December 1998. In 1999, Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) bought the station. On April 30, 1999, Clear Channel moved \\"Kiss\\" down the dial to 106.7, which changed its call sign from WYSY to WKGS. 107.3 briefly stunted as \\"Big Cow Country,\\" then flipped to rhythmic oldies on May 7, 1999 as \\"Jammin' Oldies,\\" later modified to \\"Cool 107\\" under the new call sign WLCL, which took effect July 9, 1999.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1999/RR-1999-05-14.pdf In February 2000, WLCL changed format to 80s Hits as \\"Channel 107.3.\\" On September 3, 2001, WLCL began stunting with an all-ABBA format, returning the following week to rhythmic oldies. At the same time, Clear Channel was preparing to relocate the 107.3 facility to South Bristol as part of an upgrade to sister station WNVE on 95.1, which was changing city of license from South Bristol to Honeoye Falls in order to move its transmitter to Baker Hill, closer to Rochester. In January 2002, WLCL relocated its transmitter to the Bristol Mountain site built in 1948 for the Rural Radio Network and formerly used by WNVE. As a class A station from Bristol Mountain, WLCL's new signal in the Rochester market was relatively weak, though the station was well heard in most of the western Finger Lakes region. Classic Rock The Fox In December 2002, WLCL dropped the rhythmic oldies format and began stunting with Christmas music as \\"Rudolph Radio,\\" then with two days of country music. On December 26, 2002, WLCL changed format to classic rock as \\"107.3 the Fox,\\" taking new call letters WFXF on March 28, 2003. On July 4, 2004, Clear Channel swapped formats and call letters between 95.1 and 107.3, sending classic rock WFXF to the stronger 95.1 signal and moving the WNVE call sign and \\"Nerve\\" modern rock format to the weaker 107.3 facility. The move followed Clear Channel's corporate decision to remove Howard Stern from its airwaves, which left WNVE without its main ratings draw. Snap 107.3 and Whoopi Goldberg On August 30, 2006, the Nerve was replaced with a \\"Wheel Of Formats\\" under the moniker \\"Huge 107.3,\\" sponsored by local automobile dealership Fuccillo Hyundai. After six days of stunting, the station flipped to a Rhythmic Adult Contemporary format known as \\"SNAP! 107.3.\\" The station also picked up the nationally syndicated \\"Wake Up With Whoopi\\" for mornings, featuring comic-actress Whoopi Goldberg. The call letters were changed to WSNP on September 15, 2006. Logo as WCRR/WROO \\"Country 107.3,\\" used from May 18, 2007 through September 9, 2009 On May 18, 2007, Clear Channel pulled the plug on the format and went to country music as \\"Country 107.3.\\" On June 14, 2007, the call letters were changed to WCRR. On March 3, 2009, the call letters switched again to WROO, without any change in format or branding. On September 9, 2009, at Midnight, the call letters were changed to WHTK-FM, as an FM simulcast of sports radio WHTK 1280 AM. The move gave listeners who preferred FM radio a sports station and helped to cover areas in the Rochester market that WHTK-AM's signal could not, especially at night. Oldies 107.3 On May 5, 2012, WHTK-FM began stunting with a looped message directing listeners back to 1280 AM. On May 7, at 9 AM, WHTK-FM launched an oldies format, branded as \\"Oldies 107.3\\".http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/netgnomes/57260/107-3-whtk-fm- rochester-to-debut-new-format/#.T6hZGu0Zy70 Oldies 107.3 Launches The call letters were changed to WODX. The first song as \\"Oldies 107.3\\" was Bob Seger's \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\". The flip gave the Rochester market an oldies format for the first time since the demise of WBBF in 2005. 107.3 The Bull On September 11, 2014, at Noon, after playing \\"It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\\" by R.E.M, WODX changed its format back to country, branded as \\"107.3 The Bull\\" launching with 10,000 songs commercial free.Clear Channel Launches 107.3 The Bull The first song on \\"The Bull\\" was \\"Roller Coaster\\" by Luke Bryan.

The village now has a population of 780. History A first fortified settlement at the site was founded in the late 7th century. Santok is mentioned in the 12th century as \\"barbican and key\\" () to the Polish kingdom at the border with the Duchy of Pomerania in the Gesta principum Polonorum chronicle by Gallus Anonymus. Santok watchtower, 1936 reconstruction Re-established by Boles≈Çaw I the Brave in the days of the medieval Piast dynasty, Santok became an important border fortress of Greater Poland and seat of a castellany. An attack by Duke Barnim I of Pomerania in 1251 was repelled. During the 13th century however, the strategically important hill fort became the object of claims raised by the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg, who intended to enlarge their territories in the Neumark region east of the Oder river. Upon the marriage of Margrave Conrad of Brandenburg-Stendal with Constance, daughter of the deceased Duke Przemys≈Ç I of Greater Poland, in 1260, Santok passed to the margraviate as part of her dowry. Once again reconquered by the Polish duke Przemys≈Ç II, it finally was incorporated by Brandenburg upon his death in 1296. The Polish king Casimir III the Great temporarily occupied Santok from 1365; still after his death in 1370, the title of a castellan was awarded by the Polish monarchs until the late 18th century. Within the Brandenburg Neumark region, the fortress lost its importance in favour of nearby Landsberg. It was devastated by Hussite troops in the course of the Polish‚ÄìTeutonic War in 1433. After the 1945 Potsdam Agreement and the implementation of the Oder-Neisse line, Santok was transferred from Germany to Poland as part of the extensive territorial changes of Poland after World War II.

It peaked at #1 on the national singles chart, NOTE: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1970 until ARIA created their own charts in mid-1988. while it reached Top 5 in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. The song was written by guitarist and vocalist Mike Rudd, and produced by Howard Gable. The B-side, \\"Launching Place Part Two\\" was written to promote a music festival. Spectrum never repeated the success of \\"I'll Be Gone\\". Background Spectrum was formed in Melbourne in 1969 by Mike Rudd, a New Zealand-born singer, songwriter and guitarist (ex- Chants R&B;, The Party Machine, Sons of the Vegetal Mother), together with bassist Bill Putt (Gallery, The Lost Souls), organist Lee Neale (ex-Nineteen 87), and drummer Mark Kennedy. Spectrum played covers of Traffic, Soft Machine and Pink Floyd initially, they then developed their own style and wrote a set of original material. Just prior to being signed up by EMI, Spectrum cut a demo single which they hawked to record companies as a 7\\" acetate. One side was an early, folky version of \\"I'll Be Gone\\", according to rock historian Ian McFarlane, these acetates are now \\"impossibly rare\\" and only two or three copies are known to have survived. Once signed to EMI's progressive imprint Harvest Records, Spectrum went into the studio to make their first official recordings under producer Howard Gable, who had worked with The Masters Apprentices. They had a #1 Australian hit with their first single, \\"I'll Be Gone\\", which has become one of the most enduring Australian rock songs of that era. The B-side, \\"Launching Place Part Two\\" was written to promote a music festival. They released their debut LP Spectrum Part One in March 1971 but Rudd would not allow their hit single to appear on the album. Drummer Kennedy left just after it was recorded and was replaced by Ray Arnott (ex-Cam-Pact, Company Caine). Ross Wilson, vocalist and guitarist, had been a founding member of The Party Machine with Rudd, they were later both members of Sons of the Vegetal Mother, Wilson formed Daddy Cool as a side-project while Rudd went on to form Spectrum. During their time in 'Vegetals' Rudd had started working on \\"I'll Be Gone\\" and Wilson approved of the song, \\"That's it, that's the one\\". Daddy Cool and Spectrum often toured together in their early years. Rudd described the development of the song: Although recorded in August 1970 the song was not released until January 1971 due to the 1970 radio ban, which was a dispute between radio stations and major record labels over payments for songs being broadcast. Chris L√∂fv√©n went on to direct the video for Daddy Cool's debut single \\"Eagle Rock\\" which also peaked at #1 later in 1971. The Launching Place Festival was a minor festival held on 31 December 1970 at Launching Place 60 km east of Melbourne, other acts included Wendy Saddington, Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs, Healing Force and King Harvest. Spectrum recorded \\"Launching Place Part One\\" and \\"Launching Place Part Two\\" to promote the festival. Cover versions Several cover versions of \\"I'll Be Gone\\" have been recorded by artists including Colleen Hewett, Margret RoadKnight and Manfred Mann's Earth Band. The latter was released, along with B-side \\"Launching Place Part Two\\", on their 1974 LP The Good Earth. In 1984 Australian country music singer John Williamson paid tribute to the song by recording his own version, a version which kept the originality but also suited his own brand of country music. Palladium recorded a version for the film Dirty Deeds. John Schumann and the Vagabond Crew covered the song on their 2008 album Behind the Lines.John Schumann official website Behind the Lines information Legacy In May 2001 the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th Anniversary celebrations, named \\"I'll Be Gone\\" as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time.

It was once home to a large Jewish community, very few of whom survived World War II. Administratively, Bolekhiv is incorporated as a city of regional significance. Population: .  History  Bolekhiv is first mentioned in historical records in 1371 after the defeat of the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia to Poland. During the Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia Wars in the 14th century, Bolekhiv was variously held by Poland, Hungary (Danylo Dazhbohovych), and Lithuania. Subsequently, King Jogaila of Poland succeeded and Bolekhiv became part of the Kingdom of Poland. In 1546, Emilia Hrosovska established a salt refinery in the town. In 1603, Sigismund III Vasa gave the town the Magdeburg rights. At that time, the Bolekhiv region was involved with the Opryshky movement led by Oleksa Dovbush and German colonists arrived. After World War II, Bolekhiv became a raion (a region of local governance). In 1964, its raion was merged with Dolyna Raion. Since 1993 the city has been governed by the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast.  Bolekhiv Jews  Bolekhiv synagogue, 2009. A Jewish community existed in Bolekhiv (Yiddish pronunciation: Bolechov) since its establishment by Nicholas Gydzincki. The town founder proclaimed equal rights to the three ethnic groups living there, Jews, Polish Catholics and Ruthenians (Ukrainians of the Greek Orthodox), and this was confirmed by Sigismund III Vasa, the king of the new Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, formerly crown prince of Poland, the grand duke of Lithuania, and later to become king of Sweden.JewishEncyclopedia.com according to the 19th-century book \\"Memories of Reb Dov of Bolechov\\" page 8 . The mayor of the town could be from any of the ethnic groups and would swear to care for all three. The town was a privately owned town, and the changes of ownership or inheritance had a strong impact on all the residents of the town, especially the Jews. In 1670, after the Tatars invaded and burnt the town down, the town owner gave the Jews a large loan to rebuild. Towards the middle of the 19th century there was much tension between the Jews and the other ethnicities.Memories of Reb Dov of Bolichov, page 8 A Hassidic rebbe, Rabbi Shneibalg, \\"the Rebbe of Bolechov\\", had a large Hassidic court in the town.Rabbi Shneibalg, the Bolohover Rebbe (Hebrew) By 1890, seventy-five percent of the population of Bolekhiv (4,237 people) was Jewish.Bartov O. \\"Erased: vanishing traces of Jewish Galicia in present day Ukraine.\\" Princeton University Press, 2007. , 9780691131214 p73 ‚Äì 74. Accessed at Google Books 24 February 2014. Atrocities began in 1935, by a hostile government and population, and escalated after the German conquest in 1941. By 1940 the Jewish population of Bolekhiv reached about 3,000.The Lost page 128 On 28 and 29 October 1941, four months after capturing the town, the German police carried out a first Aktion (German annihilation operation) in Bolekhiv, which included a list of 1,000 of the Jewish rabbis, leaders, doctors and richer people, who were tortured for two days, and then shot in a nearby forest, some buried alive.Bolechov remembered (JewishGen website) In 1941 and 1942 thousands of Jews were added to the population, from the surrounding towns. About a year later, 3 to 5 September 1942, the Germans planned a second Aktion. The Jews were warned in advance by a member of their Judenrat who was in a nearby town, but many of the local Ukrainians began a murder spree in the preceding afternoon, targeting mainly children, in horrific acts of barbarity. The Germans joined in the action, and continued to grab people from their houses or hiding places. About 1,500 Jews were murdered, 600-700 of them children, and an additional 2,000 Jews were sent to the Belzec death camp where most were subsequently murdered. Other Aktions continued into 1943 when the surviving 900 Jews, working in makeshift \\"work groups\\", were marched to the cemetery nearby, in groups of 100 or 200, and shot. Only 48 Jews of the town survived World War II  Geography  The Bolekhiv municipality is located in the western part of Ukraine in Ivano- Frankivsk Oblast. It shares borders with Dolyna Raion (east), Lviv Oblast (north, southwest and west), Zhydachiv Raion, Stryi Raion, and Skole Raion. Two rivers, the Sukil and the Svicha, run through the town before joining the Dniester. The Carpathian Mountains lie to the southwest. Bolekhiv is on Ukraine highway 10 between Dolyna and Stryi.

(Benzine is a mixture of alkanes, such as pentane, hexane, and heptane; whereas benzene is a cyclic, aromatic hydrocarbon.) A hydrocarbon is any chemical compound that consists only of the elements carbon (C) and hydrogen (H). They all contain a carbon frame, and have hydrogen atoms attached to the frame. Often the term is used as a shortened form of the term aliphatic hydrocarbon. Most hydrocarbons are combustible.

Derazhnia is situated along the banks of the Vovk River (meaning wolf in Ukrainian), 42 km east from the regional center Khmelnytskyi. An important railway junction on the line Lviv- Khmelnytskyi-Zhmerynka. Derazhnia has 10,500 inhabitants (2001 census). Derazhnia is the administrative center of Derazhnianskyi Raion. Postal code for Derazhnia is 32200. In terms of religious affiliation, local Ukrainian inhabitants belong mainly to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. Derazhnia Milk Plant is one of key enterprises in the city. Local Sugar Factory was 5th largest in Ukraine, defunct from the late 1990s - early 21st century. There are also chemical and brickworks industries. Current population is History Derazhnia was founded in 1431. Turkish records from 1542-3 report that the town site had a small Cossack detachment consisting of no more than a few huts. In 1552 there were only eleven persons living in Derazhnia, four of whom later died in an epidemic. Tatars attacked the town in 1567. Derazhnia was attacked by Bogdan Khmelnitsky's cossacks in 1648. Derazhnia was occupied by Turkey in 1672, becoming part of the Turkish Ejalet of Kamieniecki. In 1682, Derazhnia was recaptured by the Poles under Jan Sobiesky. A small castle was built here that lasted into the early 20th century but is now destroyed. Well- preserved Jewish cemetery in Derazhnia. It contains burials from at least the 1700s. Monument located at the mass shooting site of Derazhnia. It contains the graves of about 4,000 Jews and Romas. The first Jews in Derazhnia are reported in stories within Shivhei haBesht (stories about the Baal Shem Tov) that probably date from about 1750. The well-preserved Jewish Cemetery has burials from at least the late 18th century and maybe earlier. Derazhnia passed into Russian hands during the second partition of Poland in 1792. Starting in the 1840s, special Jewish agricultural colonies were granted close to Derazhnia. The largest and most prosperous was Staro Zakrevsky Meidan, founded 1844. It continued until it was turned into a kolkhoz Staro Meidan by the Soviets in 1928. Historically, Derazhnia was a tiny, impoverished village in the middle of nowhere until the Southern-Western Railroad was built in 1871‚Äì1876. Due to the railroad, the population of Derazhnia swelled from 1,201 people in 1873 to 6,118 people in 1897 and of this 5,230 were the Jews. The large crowded halls of the Derazhnia train station served as a kind of international marketplace and clubhouse. It became possible for local merchants to interact with banking figures and merchants from all over Europe. The economy of Derazhnia thrived. Ukrainian Jewish writer Sholom Aleichem wrote the fictional humorous short story \\"The German\\" taking place in Derazhnia. The train station figures prominently in the story. During World War I the railroad served a different purpose. The train station and embankments were fortified and military supply trains passed through every 10 to 15 minutes. The train station served as a vector of communications and news. After the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, Derazhnia saw numerous pogroms, due both to the communications and the strategic importance of the rail station. Under Soviet rule starting 1922, the region's economy improved. Electricity, schools, roads and other infrastructure were built. Several kolkhozi (collective farms) were established nearby. In the early 1930s, pressure from the government to collectivize and the needs of private peasants resulted in severe food shortages that resulted in famines throughout Ukraine. In World War II, Derazhnia fell to Nazi forces during Operation Barbarossa on July 11, 1941 after heavy fighting. It remained in Nazi hands until it was liberated by Soviet troops on March 25, 1944. The rail station was fortified by the Nazis while the railway was used to help supply the front. Jews from Derazhnia and nearby towns were concentrated into Derazhnia Ghetto. Included were about 200 Roma (Gypsies) from nearby Vovkovyntsi. On September 20, 1942, about 4,000 people were shot - the entire Jewish community perished. During the Cold War, Derazhnia was the location of a secret nuclear missile base.

Vladislaus was the eldest son of Duke Bolko II of Opole by his wife Elisabeth, daughter of Duke Bernard of ≈öwidnica. Life Early years Vladislaus was a descendant of the House of Piast. Little is known about his youth. As a young prince, in order to gain more political experience, he went to Hungary around 1353, where he probably remained until the death of his father (1356). There he also got married. Duke of Opole After Duke Bolko II's death, Vladislaus and his brothers Bolko III and Henry inherited Duchy of Opole (then fiefdom of the Bohemian Crown) as co-rulers; however, the strong personality of Vladislaus soon dominated the whole government and encourage his brothers to accept a modest part of their inheritance. Bolko III and Henry remained as co-Dukes of Opole, but only formally. Cooperation with King Louis I the Great of Hungary The political career of Vladislaus began in the mid 1360s in the Hungarian court of King Louis I. Already in 1364 he took part in the famous Congress of Cracow as part of the Hungarian suite. However, the most important mission of Vladislaus on behalf of King Louis took place two years later (in 1366), when he negotiated conditions of the planned marriage between a niece of Hungarian ruler and Wenceslaus, son of Emperor Charles IV. The faithful service to the Hungarian House of Anjou resulted in the appointment of Vladislaus as Count palatine, which made him most important man after the King in the country. The functions of this post were primarily broad judicial powers, who could be had only with the King. In this office, Vladislaus showed great commitment and capability; he created the rule of four Congregatio generalis, which handled court cases. Despite his huge income, his new post in the Hungarian affected Vladislaus' finances. Death of Casimir III the Great. Homage to the Kingdom of Poland During his time as count palatine, Vladislaus didn't stop to participate in the foreign politics; the example of this was, among other things, his trip to Bulgaria in 1368. In 1370, after the death of Casimir III the Great, the Duke of Opole actively participated in preparing the succession of King Louis I of Hungary in the Polish throne. As a reward, King Louis give him the towns of Wielu≈Ñ and Czƒôstochowa. By that time, Vladislaus' brother Bolko III inherited Strzelce Opolskie from their uncle Albert and with this, the Duke of Opole could maintain the sole government over his domains (the youngest brother, Henry, died in 1365 without issue). In 1371 Vladislaus led an armed expedition against the Crown of Bohemia (this assault caused a terrible devastation of Moravia); however, next year Vladislaus was the head of a mediation mission to resolve dispute between the Emperor (also Bohemian King) Charles IV and King Louis I. Ruthenia Lord and Heir Ducal seal Ladislaus Dei Gracia Dux Opoliensis Wieloniensis et Terre Russie Domin et Heres (ca. 1387) In October 1372 Vladislaus was unexpectedly deprived from the office of Count palatine. Although he retained most of his castles and goods in Hungary, his political influence was significantly decreased. As a compensation, was made Governor of Hungarian-ruled part of the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia. In this new position, the Duke of Opole successfully contributing to the economic development of the territories entrusted to him. Vladislaus mainly resided in Lviv, but at the end of his rule he spent more time in Halych. The only serious conflict during his time as Governor was related to his approaching to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which caused the angry of the local boyars, who were strongly Catholics. Probably following Vladislaus's advice, in 1374 King Louis I published a provincial privilege for the Polish nobility (szlachta) in Ko≈°ice, which ensured the succession of the King's daughters after his death. Count palatine of Poland and ruler of Kujawy In 1378 the departure of Queen Elisabeth from Poland to Hungary, forced King Louis to release Vladislaus from his post of Governor and appointed him with the empty position of Polish Count palatine. But almost immediately Vladislaus had to face the strong resistance of the Polish nobility, dissatisfied with the decision of King Louis to named heirs to his daughters, and soon was forced to resign. As compensation for his resignation, the Duke of Opole received from the Hungarian ruler the towns of Dobrzy≈Ñ Land and part of Kujawy (with towns Bydgoszcz, Inowroc≈Çaw and Gniewkowo). These territories were on the border of the Teutonic Order lands, which soon shortly Vladislaus established close contacts, who included allowed the prosecution of criminals by Teutonic knights in his domains. In Kujawy, Vladislaus entered in a dispute over finances with the Bishop of P≈Çock, Dobies≈Çaw S√≥wka, resulting in the excommunication of the Duke, who was repealed a year later by the Archbishop of Gniezno. As a gesture of reconciliation with the Church, Vladislaus founded the Pauline monastery of Our Lady at Jasna G√≥ra in Czƒôstochowa; also, the Duke brought the famous Black Madonna of Czƒôstochowa, who according to oldest documents, travelled from Jerusalem, via Constantinople and Be≈Çz, to finally reach Czƒôstochowa in August 1382. The deaths of his brother Bolko III (21 October 1382), leaving four minor sons, and one month later (14 September) of the Duke Henry of Niemodlin without issue, made it possible to Vladislaus extend his influence on Upper Silesia, as a rule over Strzelce and Niemodlin (although only as a regent of his nephews) and G≈Çog√≥wek (granted to him one year later, in 1383). The Duke of Opole also supported the Church career of the eldest son of Bolko III, Jan Kropid≈Ço trying to obtain for him, despite his young age, the dignity of the Bishop of Pozna≈Ñ. Death of Louis I and relations with Vladislaus II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço Red Ruthenia Coins of Opolczy (1389) On 10 September 1382 King Louis I of Hungary, Vladislaus' protector, died. Despite the earlier support given to him to late King's daughters, Vladislaus put his own nomination to the royal crown. However, he wasn't popular among the Polish nobility, who decanted (in connection with the broken engagement between Queen Hedwig and William of Habsburg) for Duke Siemowit IV of P≈Çock. Contrary to the old historiography, the Duke of Opole supported the new Polish King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço during the first period of his reign. Some historians accept the fact that in 1386 Vladislaus stood as the King's godfather when he converted to the Catholic faith. However, the cooperation between the Duke of Opole and the King was short-lived: in 1388, after the King dispossessed him from Bydgoszcz, the Duke lead a coup who planned to capture the King and Wawel Castle. Defeated and captured by the Starosta (provincial governor) Sƒôdziw√≥j Pa≈Çuka, Vladislaus was forced to capitulate and resign from any claim to the Polish throne. King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço also blocked the nomination of Jan Kropid≈Ço for the post of Archbishop of Gniezno. Cooperation with the Teutonic Order. Vladislaus' ambitions and war with Poland. Death Further frictions with the King of Poland took place in May 1391, when Vladislaus pledged the land of Z≈Çot√≥w to the Teutonic Order. Aware of the danger that the Teutonic Order to close to his bordes, the King ordained the deprivation of Vladislaus from his fiefs in Polish territory. Against the Royal power, the Duke of Opole capitulated, and in 1392 transferred the disputed territories to Poland (with the exception of Boles≈Çawiec, which, completely loyal to W≈Çadys≈Çaw, only accepted the annexation to the Polish Kingdom after the death of the Duke of Opole). However, the attitude of Vladislaus was not changed and in 1393 he sold his rights over Dobrzy≈Ñ to the Teutonic Order. Has also tried to encourage the Great master of the Teutonic Order, Konrad von Wallenrode, to attack the Kingdom with the combination of the troops of Teutonic knights in Poland, Hungary and Bohemia, but the conflict ended unexpectedly. The war, which began successfully (for example, with the siege to Nowy Korczyn on 26 July 1393), finally ended in 1396, when the royal army decided to attack the Silesian lands of Vladislaus. After the Polish troops took control over Strzelce, on 6 August of that year, Vladislaus' nephews decided to make peace with the King of Poland. Since then, the government of the Duchy of Opole was virtually taken over by the sons of Bolko III, and Vladislaus was relegated to a second status. Disappointed because of his ambitions failed disastrously, Vladislaus died on 18 May 1401 in Opole, and was buried in the local Franciscan monastery. Marriages and issue Around 1355 and during his stay in Hungary, Vladislaus married firstly Elisabeth (b. 1340 ‚Äì d. c. 1369), daughter of Nicolae Alexandru Basarab, Voivode of Wallachia.W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Opolczyk (Ruski, Naderspan)Chronological Dates in Stoyan They had three daughters: #Kinga (b. 1355/57 ‚Äì d. after 1369), a nun at Alt-Buda. #Elisabeth [Agnes] (b. 1360 ‚Äì d. by 9 September 1411), married in 1372 to Margrave Jobst of Moravia, King of the Romans. #Katharina (b. c. 26 March 1367 ‚Äì d. 6 June 1420), married in 1382 to Duke Henry VIII of ≈ªaga≈Ñ-G≈Çog√≥w-≈öcinawa. By 1369, Vladislaus married secondly Euphemia (b. c. 1352 ‚Äì d. by 9 December 1424), daughter of Duke Siemowit III of Masovia. They had two daughters: #Hedwig (b. 1376/78 ‚Äì d. after 13 May 1390), married before 25 January 1390 to Duke Vygantas-Alexander of Kernavƒó. #Euphemia (d. young, before 30 March 1408). Because he died without male heirs, Vladislaus' nephews Bolko IV and Bernard inherited the whole Duchy except G≈Çog√≥wek, who was given by the Duke to his wife, Euphemia, as her dower.

He served as the commanding officer of the 405th Bombardment Squadron (Medium) in the Fifth Air Force's 38th Bombardment Group, based at Durand Airfield, Port Moresby, New Guinea. On August 18, 1943, while leading his group of B-25 Mitchells on a low level attack of two Japanese airfields, his bomber was severely damaged. Cheli pressed the attack despite the battle damage, then crash-landed his bomber at sea. He was made a prisoner-of-war and on March 6, 1944, was executed by his captors. During the period when his status was unknown, Cheli was nominated for the Medal of Honor, which he was awarded in October 1943. Biography Born in San Francisco to Robert Alfred Cheli and Julia (n√©e Martinelli) Cheli (San Francisco, March 27 1893-Piediluco, February 9 1993), he attended Lehigh University as member of the class of 1941. In February 1940, during his junior year, he left Lehigh to enlist in the USAAF as an aviation cadet. He undertook primary flying training at Tulsa, Oklahoma; basic flight training at Randolph Field, Texas; and multi-engine advanced training at Kelly Field, Texas. After commissioning as a second lieutenant in November, Cheli was assigned as a B-17 Flying Fortress co-pilot in the 21st Reconnaissance Squadron, operating from Miami, Florida, under the 3rd Bombardment Wing of General Headquarters Air Force. After attending the Chemical Warfare School at Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland, he rejoined the 21st RS at MacDill Field, Florida, where it had been attached to the 29th Bomb Group. When the United States entered World War II, Cheli was promoted to 1st lieutenant in February 1942 and flew anti-submarine patrols in the Caribbean Sea as a B-17 pilot with the 43rd Bomb Squadron (29th BG). Cheli advanced to captain in June 1942 and was transferred to the 38th Bomb Group at Barksdale Field, Louisiana, where he was assigned as Operations Officer of the 405th Bomb Squadron \\"Green Dragons\\". In August Cheli led a flight of B-25s from Hamilton Field, California, to Australia in the first air movement of B-25s to the Southwest Pacific war zone. Two months later, the 38th moved forward to Port Moresby, where Cheli was assigned command of the 405th BS after the death of its previous commander on January 5, 1943. He was promoted to major in March. On March 3, 1943, during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, Cheli led the 405th Bomb Squadron in the first daylight \\"masthead\\" (low level) attack against a Japanese shipping convoy, one of the first skip bombing raids. In all he flew 39 combat missions and earned the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal. Medal of Honor mission In August 1943, the Fifth Air Force was supporting the Allies' strategic plan of advance toward the Philippines along the north coast of New Guinea. Its next stage, scheduled for early September, was the seizure of the Japanese base at Lae. The immediate goal of the Fifth Air Force was the neutralization of Japanese airpower concentrated at Wewak, some 300 miles west of Lae. Wewak and its satellite fields at But, Boram, and Dagua, based more than 100 bombers and about 90 fighters. The 500+-mile flight to Wewak was the deepest penetration into Japanese-held territory yet made by medium bombers. On the night of August 16, 50 heavy bombers attacked the fields, followed on the morning of the 17th by 32 B-25s, escorted by 80 P-38 Lightnings. Both attacks encountered intense antiaircraft fire but little fighter opposition. Another attack on the airfields was dispatched on the morning of August 18 to strafe and drop the fields from low altitude. The 3rd Attack GroupOfficially, 3rd Bombardment Group (Light), but numerous official records use the \\"3rd Attack Group\\" designation. was assigned to attack Wewak and Boram fields, while the 38th BG was sent further west to attack Dagua and But airdromes. Each bomber was loaded with 12 3-bomb clusters of 23-pound \\"para-frag\\" bombs, which the 405th BS would drop on Dagua and the 71st BS on But., pp. 73-78. Cheli was assigned to lead the 38th BG, 30 B-25 Mitchells including stand-bys. Bad weather en route separated the force from its P-38 cover escort, and mechanical problems reduced each squadron by one Mitchell, leaving his 405th and the following 71st Squadrons to attack with 28 B-25s. His assigned aircraft that day was B-25D-1 (s/n 41-30117), a bomber field-modified into a strafer by enclosure of its plexiglass nose to mounting of four forward-firing machine guns, and a pair of fuselage side \\"blister packs\\" mounting guns that also fired forward. While maneuvering 150 feet above the ground to attack the heavily defended airfield, 10-15 Japanese Oscar fighters orbiting in the clouds attacked from above, making numerous passes at the force over a ten-minute span of time. Several concentrated their fire on Cheli's bomber, causing its right engine to burst into flames while still 2 miles from the target. The fire quickly spread to the nose and cockpit. His speed would have enabled him to gain necessary altitude to parachute to safety, but this action would have resulted in his formation becoming disorganized and exposed to the enemy. Although a crash was inevitable, he elected to continue leading the attack. From a minimum altitude, the squadron made a devastating bombing and strafing attack on the target. Maj. Cheli directed his wingman to lead the formation. His aircraft flew southeast to the vicinity of Boram airfield, where it crash-landed in the sea about 2 kilometers offshore. Initially he was believed killed in the crash, but post war evidence indicates that he survived the crash but was executed in March 1944 by the Japanese while a POW on Rabaul. For his actions, he posthumously received the Medal of Honor. What are believed to be Major Cheli's and other similarly executed POWs remains are now interred at Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri. Cheli was survived by his wife, Geraldine, and infant son, Ralph Jr. The Arnold Air Society chapter at his alma mater Lehigh University was named in his honor. Between 1947 and 1961 the United States Air Force operated the Cheli Air Force Station near Maywood, California. Medal of Honor citation Rank and organization: Major, U.S. Army Air Corps.

He is also well known for his development of the PSLQ algorithm, an integer relation detection algorithm. Early life and education Ferguson's mother died when he was about three and his father went off to serve in the Second World War. He was adopted by an Irish immigrant and raised in New York. He learned to work with his hands in an old-world style with earthen materials from his adoptive father who was a carpenter and stonemason by trade. An art-inclined math teacher in high school helped him develop his dual interests in math and art. Ferguson was a graduate of Hamilton College, a liberal arts school in New York. In 1971, he received a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Washington. Ferguson and his wife, Claire, later moved to Utah, where he continued to teach math and she studied art at Brigham Young University. The couple raised their seven children, while Ferguson was tenured at BYU for 17 years. Ferguson is a Latter-day Saint. Work In 1977, Ferguson and another mathematician, Rodney Forcade, developed an algorithm for integer relation detection. It was first viable generalization of the Euclidean algorithm to three or more variables.http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Ferguson- ForcadeAlgorithm.html A more notable integer relation detection algorithm he developed, the PSLQ algorithm, was selected as one of the \\"Top Ten Algorithms of the Century\\" by Jack Dongarra and Francis Sullivan.The Best of the 20th Century: Editors Name Top 10 Algorithms by Barry Arthur Cipra; SIAM News, Volume 33, Number 4PSLQ Algorithm In January 2014, Ferguson and his wife Claire Ferguson delivered an MAA Invited Address, titled \\"Mathematics in Stone and Bronze,\\" at the Joint Math Meetings in Baltimore Maryland. He is an active artist, often representing mathematical shapes in his works. One of the first bronze torii sculpted by Ferguson was exhibited at a computer art exhibition in 1989 at the Computer Museum in Boston. His most widely known piece of art is a 27-inch (69 centimeters) bronze sculpture, Umbilic Torus. In 2010, the Simons Foundation, a private institution committed to the advancement of science and mathematics, commissioned him to create the Umbilic Torus SC, a massive 8.5 meter-high cast bronze and granite sculpture weighing more than nine tons. With its installation completed in 2012, the torus sculpture was donated to Stony Brook University, in Long Island, N.Y., and sits outside the Math and Physics buildings of the same university, near the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics. Mounted on a stainless steel column, the torus has a 7.7 meter diameter as the granite base, where various mathematical formulas defining the torus are inscribed.Helaman Ferguson, \\"Two Theorems, Two Sculptures, Two Posters\\", American Mathematical Monthly, Volume 97, Number 7,August‚ÄìSeptember 1990, pages 589-610.

Geomembranes are made from relatively thin continuous polymeric sheets, but they can also be made from the impregnation of geotextiles with asphalt, elastomer or polymer sprays, or as multilayered bitumen geocomposites. Continuous polymer sheet geomembranes are, by far, the most common. Manufacturing The manufacturing of geomembranes begins with the production of the raw materials, which include the polymer resin, and various additives such as antioxidants, plasticizers, fillers, carbon black, and lubricants (as a processing aid). These raw materials (i.e., the \\"formulation\\") are then processed into sheets of various widths and thickness by extrusion, calendering, and/or spread coating. Three methods used to manufacture geomembranes. Geomembranes dominate the sales of geosynthetic products, at US$1.8 billion per year worldwide, which is 35% of the market. The US market is currently divided between HDPE, LLDPE, fPP, PVC, CSPE-R, EPDM-R and others (such as EIA-R), and can be summarized as follows: (Note that M m2 refers to millions of square meters.) * high-density polyethylene (HDPE) _~_ 35% or 105 M m2 * linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) _~_ 25% or 75 M m2 * polyvinyl chloride (PVC) _~_ 25% or 75 M m2 * flexible polypropylene (fPP) _~_ 10% or 30 M m2 * chlorosulfonated polyethylene (CSPE) _~_ 2% or 6 M m2 * ethylene propylene diene terpolymer (EPDM) _~_ 3% or 9 M m2 The above represents approximately $1.8 billion in worldwide sales. Projections for future geomembrane usage are strongly dependent on the application and geographical location. Landfill liners and covers in North America and Europe will probably see modest growth ( _~_ 5%), while in other parts of the world growth could be dramatic (10‚Äì15%). Perhaps the greatest increases will be seen in the containment of coal ash and heap leach mining for precious metal capture. Properties The majority of generic geomembrane test methods that are referenced worldwide are by the ASTM InternationalAmerican Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) due to their long history in this activity. More recent are test method developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Lastly, the Geosynthetic Research Institute (GRI) has developed test methods that are only for test methods not addressed by ASTM or ISO. Of course, individual countries and manufacturers often have specific (and sometimes) proprietary test methods.  Physical properties  The main physical properties of geomembranes in the as-manufactured state are: * Thickness (smooth sheet, textured, asperity height) * Density * Melt flow index * Mass per unit area (weight) * Vapor transmission (water and solvent).  Mechanical properties  There are a number of mechanical tests that have been developed to determine the strength of polymeric sheet materials. Many have been adopted for use in evaluating geomembranes. They represent both quality control and design, i.e., index versus performance tests. * tensile strength and elongation (index, wide width, axisymmetric, and seams) * tear resistance * impact resistance * puncture resistance * interface shear strength * anchorage strength * stress cracking (constant load and single point).  Endurance  Any phenomenon that causes polymeric chain scission, bond breaking, additive depletion, or extraction within the geomembrane must be considered as compromising to its long-term performance. There are a number of potential concerns in this regard. While each is material-specific, the general behavior trend is to cause the geomembrane to become brittle in its stress-strain behavior over time. There are several mechanical properties to track in monitoring such long term degradation: the decrease in elongation at failure, the increase in modulus of elasticity, the increase (then decrease) in stress at failure (i.e., strength), and the general loss of ductility. Obviously, many of the physical and mechanical properties could be used to monitor the polymeric degradation process. * ultraviolet light exposure (laboratory of field) * radioactive degradation * biological degradation (animals, fungi or bacteria) * chemical degradation * thermal behavior (hot or cold) * oxidative degradation.  Lifetime  Geomembranes degrade slowly enough that their lifetime behavior is as yet uncharted. Thus, accelerated testing, either by high stress, elevated temperatures and/or aggressive liquids, is the only way to determine how the material will behave long-term. Lifetime prediction methods use the following means of interpreting the data: * Stress limit testing: A method by the HDPE pipe industry in the United States for determining the value of hydrostatic design basis stress. * Rate process method: Used in Europe for pipes and geomembranes, the method yields similar results as stress limit testing. * Hoechst multiparameter approach: A method that utilizes biaxial stresses and stress relaxation for lifetime prediction and can include seams as well. * Arrhenius modeling: A method for testing geomembranes (and other geosynthetics) described in Koerner for both buried and exposed conditions. Seaming The fundamental mechanism of seaming polymeric geomembrane sheets together is to temporarily reorganize the polymer structure (by melting or softening) of the two opposing surfaces to be joined in a controlled manner that, after the application of pressure, results in the two sheets being bonded together. This reorganization results from an input of energy that originates from either thermal or chemical processes. These processes may involve the addition of additional polymer in the area to be bonded. Ideally, seaming two geomembrane sheets should result in no net loss of tensile strength across the two sheets, and the joined sheets should perform as one single geomembrane sheet. However, due to stress concentrations resulting from the seam geometry, current seaming techniques may result in minor tensile strength and/or elongation loss relative to the parent sheet. The characteristics of the seamed area are a function of the type of geomembrane and the seaming technique used.

The novel was Klause's first; it was published on September 1, 1990, and was re-issued in 2009 with two bonus short stories by Klause. The Silver Kiss was inspired by Klause's poems and her teenage fantasy about romancing with a vampire. It is set in a suburban area in Seattle, in the early 1990s and explores themes of belonging, death, and loss through the romance between a young woman‚ÄîZo√´ Sutcliff‚Äîand Simon, an English vampire who looks like a nineteen-year-old youth. During the story, Zo√´'s mother is in hospital dying from cancer. Zo√´ and Simon come to terms with their own mortality and the loss of their loved ones through their growing relationship and their battle with an evil vampire named Christopher. The novel is a coming-of-age drama in which the characters must confront their fear of death and challenge their notions of it. Klause uses the horror genre to examine different types of horror such as terminal illness, spiritual horror in the form of vampires, and personal loss.http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-the-silver-kiss/#gsc.tab=0 accessdate =21 March 2015 The Silver Kiss received numerous accolades; it was selected as Best Book of the Year Honor Book (1990) by Michigan Library Association, Best Books by School Library Journal (1990), and Best Books for Young Adults (1991) by American Library Association. Plot Zo√´ Sutcliff is a young woman who experiences the slow death of her mother, Anne Sutcliff, and the dislocation of her father, Harry Sutcliff. She turns to her sole friend Lorraine, who cannot provide emotional support for Zo√´. Lorraine moves to Oregon with her father and stepmother, leaving Zo√´ completely alone. On the news, there are reports of women being killed in Zo√´'s area, whose throats are slashed and drained of blood. While walking in a park, Zo√´ meets Simon, begins a friendship with him; they eventually develop a mutual romantic attraction until one night, she caught him eating a pigeon. He later tells her the truth of his origin, which he is a vampire from 17th-century England, and he is seeking to kill Christopher‚Äîhis own brother‚Äîwho looks like a six-year-old albino but is a sadistic version of what Simon could become. He reveals that Christopher is Zo√´'s neighborhood's throat-slashing killer, and his brother was also responsible for the murder of their mother and his vampirism; hence, he wants retribution against his brother. Prior to Simon's revelations, Lorraine was almost killed by Christopher when he attempted to lure her into an alley until Zo√´ reached her in time; Zo√´ now realizes that she has met the childlike vampire before and inadvertently saved her friend's life by interfering. Skeptical, Zo√´ allows Simon to feed upon her in a controlled manner to prove his claims. Simon is entranced by the grief-stricken Zo√´ and must accept his feelings of fondness for her while trying to control his own nature. His growing attachment to Zo√´ puts them both at risk because of his feud with Christopher. Zo√´ tells Lorraine about her feelings for Simon, but does not tell her about him being a vampire. Zo√´ considers asking Simon to turn her mother into a vampire, but he tells her there is no cure for vampirism and that existence as one is unappealing. Despite misgivings, Simon approaches Zo√´; she lures Christopher into a trap where Simon has the strategic advantage. In a climactic battle, Simon slays Christopher. After the battle, despite Zo√´ offers herself to Simon for him to turn as a vampire for companionship, he refuses and decides to end his life now that his revenge is completed and seeking the peace he has been unable to get since his transformation. Simon spends his final hours with Zo√´; they have sex and he dies after exposing himself to sunlight. Characters *Zo√´ Sutcliff, the main character; a young woman in her late teenage years. *Simon is a 340-year- old vampire from Bristol, England, and Zo√´'s love interest. *Lorraine, Zo√´‚Äôs best friend who moves to Oregon with her family. *Anne Sutcliff, Zo√´'s mother, who is dying of cancer. *Harry Sutcliff, Zo√´'s argumentative father. *Christopher, Simon's older brother, who is also a vampire. Bonus stories The 2009 reissue of The Silver Kiss contains two bonus short stories written by Klause; \\"The Summer of Love\\" and \\"The Christmas Cat\\". Reception The Silver Kiss has been compared to the successful Twilight series as a vampire romance. The Silver Kiss was written several years before Twilight and has been successful by its own merits. Klause has been said to have successfully integrated \\"gory details\\" into a \\"sensuous and suspenseful story\\". The novel has been cited in the psychology journal Adolescence as an example of literature that can help adolescents understand death, \\"enabling them to understand the impact of trauma and identify corrective responses\\". According to Publishers Weekly, Klause's use of themes and genres is \\"excessively ambitious\\", making \\"her suspense ... uneven, her love story inadequately rooted and her resolution just a bit pat\\". The reviewer, however, said Klause's use of the vampire figure and the quality of her prose points to \\"an intelligent and original eye\\". Kathleen Reese of Entertainment Weekly gave the novel a \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale, stated the novel is a \\"complicated story, but Klause tells it skillfully and simply\\".

Population: . It is administrative center of the Busk Raion. Busk was the birthplace of Yevhen Petrushevych, the president of the West Ukrainian National Republic.  History  Busk has a long history. First mentioned in 1097 in Primary Chronicle as Bug City (Ruthenian: –±—É–∂—å—Å—ä–∫—ä –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥—ä, buzhesk horod) in the context of the dispute between Rus' princes for border area between Principality of Halych and Volhynian principality.–ü–°–†–õ. ‚Äî –¢. 2. Hypatian manuscript. ‚Äî –°–ü–±., 1908. ‚Äî –°—Ç. 241 Bug City was named due to its location near Western Bug which locally is known as Bug river. Busk was granted town charter in 1411 by Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia. In the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth, it belonged to the Belz Voivodeship, and was the seat of a separate administrative unit, the Land of Busk. The town remained part of Poland until the first partition of Poland (1772), when it was seized by the Habsburg Empire, and remained in Austrian Galicia until late 1918. In the interwar period, Busk belonged to Kamionka Buska County, Tarnopol Voivodeship, until Soviet invasion of Poland (September 1939). In 1913, the population of Busk was 8,000, including 3,500 Poles, 2,700 Jews and 1,800 Ukrainians. Busk had a very active Jewish community before World War II. The first synagogue was built in 1502.Porteur de m√©moires, P√®re Patrick Desbois, Flammarion 2007 The old Jewish cemetery was renowned. On July 1, 1941, German forces occupied Busk. The Jewish population was transferred to a ghetto then murdered on May 21, 1943. 1500 Jews perished during this operation.

It is the administrative center of Turka Raion. Population: . Name The name Turka originates from Ukrainian word, (), meaning aurochs or urus (), the ancestor of domestic cattle ‚Äî a type of huge wild cattle which inhabited in the surrounding forests (it survived in Europe until 1627).Unofficial site of Turka (in Ukrainian) In another version the city's name derives from the Ukrainian name of the gate-towers, \\"Turia\\" (), \\"Turja\\" (), \\"Turnia\\"(), which stood at the entrance to an ancient settlement. Origin of name may also be linked to the Turks since the area was under Hun Empire and they are considered as ancestors of Turks. Also, Turkic tribes were nomadic, who settled in various places and assimilated. Location The city is located in the south Lviv Oblast, in the Carpathian Mountains, on the left bank of the Stryi River, with its tributaries, the Yablunka River () and Litmyr River (), and between the mountains Shymenka (), Kychera (), Vinets' () and Osovnya (). City is located 137 km from Lviv, 107 km from Uzhhorod, 75 km from Drohobych, at an altitude of 557 meters above sea level. The location of initial settlement outpost, from which arose Turka, was determined by the so-called \\"Path of Rus\\" - Neolithic trade route that connected through the Turka Western Europe to Hungary, Moldova and the Balkan countries.  History  On June 27, 1431, King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço presented Turka to a man named Vancza Valachus. This was confirmed in 1444 by King W≈Çadys≈Çaw III of Poland, and by Sigismund I the Old in 1517. In 1730 Turka received Magdeburg rights, and three years laters, a Roman Catholic parish was opened here. Until the Partitions of Poland, Turka remained in Kingdom of Poland‚Äôs Przemy≈õl Land, Ruthenian Voivodeship. From 1772 to 1918 the town belonged to Austrian Galicia. In the Second Polish Republic, Turka was the seat of a county in Lw√≥w Voivodeship. It was home to a county court, private high school and tax office. In 1921, Turka had the population of 10 030, including 4 201 Jews. At that time, its starosta was Tadeusz Zawistowski, and the mayor was Micha≈Ç Grudzi≈Ñski. Following the September 1939 Invasion of Poland, Turka was occupied by the Soviet Union. In June 1941, the town was captured by the Wehrmacht, and its Jewish population perished in the Holocaust. The area of Turka also witnessed mass murders of Poles, carried out by Ukrainian nationalists (see Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia). After World War II, the town was reattached to the Soviet Ukraine, and its Polish community was expelled to the so-called Recovered Territories. Administrative status Turka is the administrative center of the Turkivskyi Raion (districts) and the unofficial capital of Boykos country ().

She was Newfoundland's first opera singer and became known as The Nightingale of the North. Life and career Stirling is the daughter of Ann (Peyton) and William Stirling. Her birth year is uncertain as sources are contradictory. The Twillingate Sun newspaper notes that she was 68 when she died but there is no obituary to confirm her birth year. She was educated at Twillingate and Toronto and went on to study singing in Paris, Italy and Germany. She had taken the stage name \\"Toulinguet\\" which was the original French name for Twillingate. At the age of fifteen she played as a church organist in her hometown and early in her career had been instrumental in the formation of the Dorcas Society. While in Paris, Stirling had studied under the tutorship of Madame Mathilde Marchesi where she was discovered by a Milan opera company. She toured and accepted engagements with many operas such as the Opera Company of New York City, the Boston Harmony Orchestral Society and the Scalchi Opera Company. At the peak of her career she had developed a throat ailment that cut her singing career short. She eventually made a comeback as concert artist.

He was drafted by the Chargers in the third round of the 2004 NFL Draft, and was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2006. He played college football for Purdue. High school career Hardwick attended at Lawrence North High School in Indianapolis, Indiana. Unlike most of his peers, he did not play high school football, having \\"ditched\\" the sport in the ninth grade. He was a three-year varsity letterman in wrestling and won a state championship. College career Hardwick was a sophomore economics major at Purdue University when his future San Diego Chargers teammate Drew Brees led the Boilermakers to the 2001 Rose Bowl. Inspired, he joined the football team as a walk-on, initially playing as a defensive tackle. The next year, he became the team‚Äôs starting center and earned all-Big Ten honors. During his senior year, his starting quarterback was Kyle Orton, who was drafted the following year. Professional career 2004 NFL Draft Hardwick was picked with the 66th overall selection in the 3rd round of the 2004 NFL Draft by the Chargers. San Diego Chargers In 2004, Hardwick began his career by starting all 14 games he played in when incumbent starter Jason Ball held out due to a contract dispute. During the year, the Chargers ranked sixth in rushing offense and allowed the fourth-fewest sacks in the league. In his second year as a pro, he again started all games he played in as the Chargers ranked in the top ten in rushing offense and in the top half of the league in sacks allowed. Hardwick (No. 61) snapping the ball to 339x339px During the 2006 off-season, he agreed to a five-year $17 million contract extension with the Chargers. He then went on to start all 16 games for the first time in his career as the Chargers ranked second in rushing offense and eighth in sacks allowed. In December 2006, Hardwick was named the backup center for the AFC squad in the 2007 Pro Bowl, Jeff Saturday being the starter. He was one of 11 Chargers selected to the Pro Bowl that year.http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/5591/nick-hardwick In his fourth season with San Diego, he started 12 games, being forced to miss 4 due to a foot injury. In 2008, Hardwick was inactive for the first three weeks of the season while recovering from an offseason foot injury. He returned to the starting lineup at center in Week 4 to play the remaining 13 games. In 2009, Hardwick suffered an ankle injury so severe that it nearly ended his career. He missed 13 games that season, but returned in time for a late-season push to the playoffs and he hasn‚Äôt missed a game since. 2010 was a comeback year for the center as he was back to his usual form. He started all 16 games for the second time of his career.http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/2802/nick- hardwick In 2011, Hardwick played another full season starting every game. He was one of the few players on a crippled offensive line hurt by multiple injuries. After the 2011 season ended, Hardwick became an unrestricted free agent, he had recently become a new father, and he had just watched one of his best friends and linemates, left guard Kris Dielman retire after suffering a serious concussion. All three factors led Hardwick to ponder whether he wanted to continue playing football, and if he did, whether he wanted to play it in San Diego or make a fresh start elsewhere. Hardwick decided to stay in San Diego and finish his career there, opting to sign a new three-year contract with the Chargers, worth $13,500,000. In his 10th year with the Chargers, Hardwick maintained his place at center, starting in all 16 games and earning Chargers' Lineman of the Year honors for the second time in a row. However, quarterback Philip Rivers was sacked 49 times, a career high, due to the offensive line's struggle with injury and poor performance. On September 10, 2014 the Chargers placed Hardwick on injured reserve with a neck injury, ending his season after one game. He announced his retirement on February 2, 2015. Serious health concerns played a large part in Hardwick's decision to retire. \\"Nerves were getting compressed through various forms. My hands were going numb during training camp for weeks at a time. I was losing feeling in my fingers up through my elbows. I was having a bunch of stingers.

Recordings Recordings by Florrie Forde and Ella Retford are the most commonly heard versions, though Dorothy Ward first sang it. Jolly Old Fellows performed the song in 1930. British blues singer Kevin Coyne also released a version on his 1978 LP Dynamite Daze. Use in other media No√´l Coward used the song for his 1931 stage production Cavalcade, about British life in the first two decades of the twentieth century and in the 1944 film This Happy Breed. It was also used in the Errol Flynn film Let‚Äôs Make Up in 1956. A recording of the song by Cicely Courtneidge from the 1962 film The L-Shaped Room was sampled at the beginning of the title track of the album The Queen Is Dead by the Smiths. The song was also used in the film Flyboys.

Current status Between May 1 and May 5, 2006, the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights (or SCCR) established a Basic Proposal in order to develop protection rights for all broadcast organizations. However, members at the meeting decided at the time to exclude webcasting from the treaty, as well as establish a Revised Draft Basic Proposal in a September 2006 congregation. The revised proposal would in fact consider creating protection rights for webcasting, netcasting, and simulcasting. Between September 25 and October 3, 2006, members of the SCCR met in Geneva and agreed to finalize the draft text at a later time. They would have another conference meeting between July 11 and August 1, 2007 in order to update the rights of broadcasting organizations. Broadcaster rights Under the treaty, media broadcasters would have the right to protect the content of their media transmissions. Moreover, they would have the right to protect their broadcasts from reproduction, retransmission, and even from public communication. All copyright protections would endure for 50 years.  Overview  According to the US Government in 2007: > Because existing international agreements relevant to broadcasting > protections do not cover advancements in broadcasting technology that were > not envisioned when they were concluded, in 1998 the Standing Committee on > Copyright and Related Rights (SCCR) of the World Intellectual Property > Organization (WIPO) decided to proceed with efforts to negotiate and draft a > new treaty that would extend protection to new methods of broadcasting, but > has yet to achieve consensus on a text. In recent years, a growing signal > piracy problem has increased the urgency of concluding a new treaty, > resulting in a decision to restrict the focus to signal-based protections > for traditional broadcasting organizations and cablecasting. Consideration > of controversial issues of protections for webcasting (advocated by the > United States) and simulcasting will be postponed. However, considerable > work remains to achieve a final proposed text as the basis for formal > negotiations to conclude a treaty by the end of 2007, as projected. A > concluded treaty would not take effect for the United States unless Congress > enacts implementing legislation and the United States ratifies the treaty > with the advice and consent of the Senate. Noting that the United States is > not a party to the 1961 Rome Convention, various stakeholders have argued > that a new broadcasting treaty is not needed, that any new treaty should not > inhibit technological innovation or consumer use, and that Congress should > exercise greater oversight over U.S. participation in the negotiations. In November 2008, the US re-opened talks about the Treaty and the internet.  Reception  Negative The Electronic Frontier Foundation argues that \\"the only thing the Broadcasting Treaty is good for is crushing innovation\\". Podcasters - like the ones represented by UK Podcasters Association - don't like that the treaty \\"would require signatory countries to provide legal protection for technological protection measures (TPM) and is likely to lead to technology mandate laws controlling the design of broadcast-receiving devices.\\" Podcasters and the EFF also worries that the Treaty will hurt innovation in podcasting and internet distribution technologies. Intel, AT&T;, Sony, CTIA - The Wireless Association, the US Public Interest Research Group, and the American Association of Law Libraries says that \\"Creating broad new... rights in order to protect broadcast signals is misguided and unnecessary, and risks serious unintended negative consequences\\" and \\"We note with concern that treaty proponents have not clearly identified the particular problems that the treaty would ostensibly solve, and we question whether there are in fact significant problems that are not addressed adequately under existing law\\".

He graduated from Evangel University, a private liberal arts college in Springfield, Missouri, with a BA in psychology, and received a Master's Degree in counseling at Louisiana Tech University. He began his working career as a counselor, later becoming a fitness trainer in Dallas, before switching careers yet again to become a real estate manager.Cheaters.com, Accessed November 22nd 2009 In a 2011 interview on Decently Funny With Nuzzy and the Guy (a pop-culture podcast by broadcasters/producers David \\"Nuzzy\\" Nussbaum and Guy \\"The Guy\\" Opochinski), Greco revealed that he used to tend bar at a seafood restaurant. As a fitness trainer, he landed a job on ESPN's hip-hop oriented fitness show, Fitness Pros. In December 2002, he replaced Tommy Habeeb as host of Cheaters. At the start of Season 13 (2012‚Äì2013), Greco was replaced by Clark Gable's grandson, Clark Gable III, but resumed hosting duties at the end of Season 15 (2015). He has also appeared in television commercials. In early 2003, Greco was allegedly stabbed by a cheating boyfriend when the Cheaters crew boarded the man's boat; however, on November 3, 2009, the news magazine program Inside Edition interviewed the female companion, who said it was all staged. Greco was confronted a week later by the program's investigative reporter Matt Meagher. Greco declined to answer any of Meagher's questions, stating he couldn't legally comment on the accusation. John Ellison of the Rowlett Police Department stated on the same program that \\"There were no arrests at all during that time period for that type of crime.\\" In 2005, Greco, Cheaters director at the time Hunter Carson, and two security guards, were indicted for assaultRealitytvworld.com but acquitted by a grand jury in connection with the 'confrontations' on the program.

Population: It is the largest settlement on the Kunashir Island of the Kuril Islands. History The history of Yuzhno-Kurilsk is connected with the history of the Kuril Islands as a whole. In Russia, the Kuril Islands first became known after an expedition by Russian explorer Ivan Moskvitin and his companions, after which another explorer Kolobov in 1646 talked of the Ainus‚Äîthe indigenous inhabitants of the Kuriles. According to some Japanese sources, Kunashir became known to Russians later than the other islands of the Kuril chain. After that, the Kuriles, Sakhalin, and Hokkaido were explored and settled both by the Russians and Japanese. By the end of the 18th century, first settlements of Russian exiles and volunteers appeared on the Kuriles. Also, along with Ainu settlements, the islands had a Japanese trading post and fortified settlements with military garrisons. In 1769, Lieutenant Ivan Chyorny was informed that the Japanese on Kunashir had founded a settlement with a fortress and a permanent garrison. Weakened by the Crimean War, in 1855 Russia signed the Treaty of Shimoda and ceded a part of the South Kuril Islands to Japan, including the island of Kunashir. The Japanese predecessor of Yuzhno-Kurilsk, the village of Furukamappu (), was located in the northeastern corner of the eponymous bay. Furukamappu, with the neighboring villages of Okinokotan and Isoyanbetsu had fifty houses. There was a post office with the telegraph and shops. When the island was administered by Japan (1855‚Äì1945), other settlements were founded as well. Kunashir came back under the Russian rule on September 1, 1945, as a result of the Kuril landing operation. A Platoon of the Machine Gun Battalion of the 113th Infantry Brigade of the 87th Infantry Corps of the 2nd Far Eastern Front landed near Furukamappu. On the shore there was a Japanese battalion commander waiting for them with a white flag in hands. The Japanese garrison surrendered without a fight. On February 2, 1946 the island was included in the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (Sakhalin) Oblast of the USSR, and the village of Yuzhno-Kurilsk was founded. The first Yuzhno-Kurilsk City Council and all the services of civil authority were formed from members of the 113th Infantry Brigade. Captain Babukhadiya, an artillery division battery commander, became the first chairman of the regional executive committee. After World War II, active construction was launched using Soviet military forces. Japanese prisoners of war who were kept on Kunashir in a separate camp were also used for the construction. Japanese prisoners of war were given the same rations as Soviet soldiers. The Japanese wore their uniform with their own insignia, were divided into platoons and companies with their commanders in the lead. They moved around in formation, abided by strict discipline and order according to the statutes of the Japanese army (if it posed no harm to the Soviet side). According to the decision of the Soviet Government, in the summer of 1947 all the Japanese people were repatriated from the Kuril Islands to Hokkaido, Japan. By that time Kunashir was settled by many immigrants and seasonal workers from various regions of the Soviet Union. Fisheries based on Kunashir and Shikotan began to increase their production output and revenues. After the 1953 tsunami, many Yuzhno-Kurilsk public facilities had to be rebuilt above the previous level. After the 1994 earthquake in the open sea to the east of the island of Hokkaido, the buildings sustained extensive damage and were rebuilt at a new location. After a period of uncertainty and decline in the 1990s, largely caused by the fears that the island was going to be ceded to Japan, Yuzhno- Kurilsk gradually began to revive. A Federal Program for the Development of the Kuril Islands involves a significant investment to build a new airport, roads and other facilities on the island. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Yuzhno-Kurilsk serves as the administrative center of Yuzhno-Kurilsky District and is subordinated to it.Law #25-ZO As a municipal division, the urban-type settlement of Yuzhno-Kurilsk and nine rural localities of Yuzhno-Kurilsky District are incorporated as Yuzhno-Kurilsky Urban Okrug.Law #524 Climate Yuzhno-Kurilsk has a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dfb) with strong influences from the North Pacific Ocean and Sea of Okhotsk. However, precipitation is much heavier than in most humid-continental climates, owing to the presence of strong onshore winds from the Pacific Ocean. However, these also make the whole Kuril Islands archipelago extremely cloudy, especially in summer, when fog from the cold Oyashio Current produces near-saturation humidity and extremely high cloudiness. However, Yuzhno-Kurilsk itself is less affected than areas like Simushir in the Kuril Islands to the northeast, because it is somewhat shielded from fog by nearby Japan's Shiretoko and Nemuro Peninsulas and actually receives more sunshine than Wakkanai and only marginally less than Sapporo. In Yuzhno-Kurilsk, with powerful oceanic and marine influences (producing strong seasonal lag), average monthly temperatures are lowest in February, and highest in August, but warmer in September than July, suggesting the year's highest average temperatures occur in late August - exceptionally late in the year, relative to the rest of the Northern Hemisphere. Average monthly precipitation is lowest in February, and highest in September - the latter resulting in part from tropical weather systems, including former typhoons approaching from over or near Japan to the southwest, and bringing high winds and heavy rains. Maritime influences are also reflected in summer temperatures here being much lower than in comparable latitudes in the interior of Asia; for example, the warmest month at Yuzhno- Kurilsk is cooler than at Vladivostok and cooler than in Harbin. Due to its less cold winters, these differences even out during the course of the year, but Yuzhno-Kurilsk has a colder climate annually than Genoa, Italy on the exact same latitude. In winter, Yuzhno-Kurilsk lies in a sharp transition zone between pulses of frigid air from the Siberian High centered over northeastern Russia during winter, and the much milder (but still chilly), wet and stormy Aleutian Low over the North Pacific Ocean to the east and northeast. In summer, clouds, fog and cooling influence from the Sea of Okhotsk and Oyashio Current predominate. Combined over the year, these features produce an exceptionally cold climate for a marine area for this near 44 degrees north- latitude location. Transportation Aurora Airlines operates flights to and from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk 3 times per week, out of Mendeleyevo Airport (ICAO: UHSM), located 20 kilometers outside Yuzhno-Kurilsk. One or two times every month in summer, there is a ferry service connecting to Korsakov on Sakhalin island.

A geogrid is geosynthetic material used to reinforce soils and similar materials. Geogrids are commonly used to reinforce retaining walls, as well as subbases or subsoils below roads or structures. Soils pull apart under tension. Compared to soil, geogrids are strong in tension. This fact allows them to transfer forces to a larger area of soil than would otherwise be the case. Geogrids are commonly made of polymer materials, such as polyester, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene or polypropylene. They may be woven or knitted from yarns, heat- welded from strips of material, or produced by punching a regular pattern of holes in sheets of material, then stretched into a grid. The development of methods of preparing relatively rigid polymeric materials by tensile drawing, in a sense \\"cold working,\\" raised the possibility that such materials could be used in the reinforcement of soils for walls, steep slopes, roadway bases and foundation soils. The principal function of geogrids is for reinforcement. This area, as with many other geosynthetics, is very active, with a number of different products, materials, configurations, etc., making up today's geogrid market. The key feature of all geogrids is that the openings between the adjacent sets of longitudinal and transverse ribs, called ‚Äúapertures,‚Äù are large enough to allow for soil strike-through from one side of the geogrid to the other. The ribs of some geogrids are often quite stiff compared to the fibers of geotextiles. As discussed later, not only is rib strength important, but junction strength is also important. The reason for this is that in anchorage situations the soil strike-through within the apertures bears against the transverse ribs, which transmits the load to the longitudinal ribs via the junctions. The junctions are, of course, where the longitudinal and transverse ribs meet and are connected. They are sometimes called ‚Äúnodes‚Äù. Currently there are three categories of geogrids. The first, and original, geogrids (called unitized or homogeneous types, or more commonly referred to as 'punched and drawn geogrids') were invented by Dr Frank Brian MercerMercer, F.B. (1987) \\"Critical Aspects of Industrial and Academic Collaboration,\\" The Philips Lecture, The Royal Society. in the United Kingdom at Netlon, Ltd., and were brought in 1982 to North America by the Tensar Corporation. A conference in 1984 was helpful in bringing geogrids to the engineering design community.Ward, I. M. (1984) ‚ÄúThe Orientation of Polymers to Produce High Performance Materials‚Äù Proceedings of the Symposium on Polymer Grid Reinforcement in Civil Engineering, Institution of Civil Engineers, UK. A similar type of drawn geogrid which originated in Italy by Tenax is also available, as are products by new manufacturers in Asia. The second category of geogrids are more flexible, textile-like geogrids using bundles of polyethylene-coated polyester fibres as the reinforcing component. They were first developed by ICI Linear Composites LTD in the United Kingdom around 1980. This led to the development of polyester yarn geogrids made on textile weaving machinery. In this process hundreds of continuous fibers are gathered together to form yarns which are woven into longitudinal and transverse ribs with large open spaces between. The cross-overs are joined by knitting or intertwining before the entire unit is protected by a subsequent coating. Bitumen, latex, or PVC are the usual coating materials. Geosynthetics within this group are manufactured by many companies having various trademarked products. There are possibly as many as 25 companies manufacturing coated yarn-type polyester geogrids on a worldwide basis. The third category of geogrids are made by laser or ultrasonically bonding together polyester or polypropylene rods or straps in a gridlike pattern. Two manufacturers currently make such geogrids. The geogrid sector is extremely active not only in manufacturing new products, but also in providing significant technical information to aid the design engineer.

Career Xu was among the most successful of a number of Chinese-born female players who emigrated from their badminton-rich homeland, in part, for a better opportunity to play in the world's biggest events. Beginning in 2003 when she won a spate of middle tier open tournaments in Europe, Xu went on to become one of the more consistent performers on the international circuit. She was a women's singles bronze medalist twice at the BWF World Championships (2005 and 2006) and won European Championships in 2006 and 2008 over Mia Audina and Tine Rasmussen respectively in the finals. At the 2008 Beijing Olympics Xu was eliminated in a close quarterfinal match by China's Xie Xingfang, the world's number one ranked player. Among Xu's more than twenty national and international singles titles are the Scottish (2003), Polish (2003), Dutch (2005), and Swiss (2006) Opens, the Copenhagen Masters (2007), and five consecutive (2004-2008) German National Championships. Notably, she earned all of these titles after turning 27, an age at which world level singles players often feel that their best years are behind them. Xu retired from playing on the international circuit in 2009 and worked as a coach for two years at the Bellevue Badminton Club near Seattle, teaching the Junior National team of young badminton players hoping to succeed in professional badminton. In 2010, she was appointed as an International Olympic Committee athlete role model for the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics. From 2011 to 2012, she served the Dutch Badminton Association as their National Coach. Personal life Xu speaks fluent Chinese, German and English.

History Lawrence Cabin was built by Henry Lawrence sometime between 1690 and 1710. Originally located on Darby Creek, it was moved in 1961 when threatened with destruction. A small log house, it is typical of the first homes originally built on the bank of Darby Creek at Old West Chester Pike by four early settlers, including David Lawrence. One of the early Welsh settlers in Haverford Township, David Lawrence emigrated with his wife Elinor Ellis and her family in 1684, and took up part of his father-in-law's land grant. His son Henry Lawrence then purchased along Darby Creek in 1709. It has not been determined whether the log house pre-dates this purchase but a 2¬Ω story stone addition was built circa 1730, and later a clapboard summer kitchen was added. It became known as the Three Generation House, and remained in Lawrence family ownership until 1942. A large fireplace dominates the first floor room of Henry Lawrence's structure (Lawrence Cabin), with a ladder leading to the sleeping loft. The house is furnished appropriately in the period before 1750, and is used for the Colonial Living Experience provided by The Haverford Township Historical Society for elementary school students. The cabin is also available to be viewed by locals during the Haverford Heritage Festival, where local vendors sell food and trinkets, and the Haverford Township Historical Society opens up Nitre Hall in addition to Lawrence Cabin.

In 1852, he converted to Roman Catholicism. Ives subsequently became a noted professor at colleges in the New York area. He was the founder and first president of the New York Catholic Protectory, an institution for the shelter and education of destitute and abandoned children. He was also a founder of Manhattan College. Early life Levi was born at Meriden, Connecticut, the son of Levi and Fanny Silliman Ives. He was brought up on his father's farm in Turin, New York. Levi served during the first year of the War of 1812 and studied at Hamilton College, but in 1819 left the Presbyterian for the Episcopal Church, and studied under Bishop John Henry Hobart and was graduated from the General Theological Seminary in New York City. In 1822, he married Bishop Hobart's daughter, Rebecca. That year he was ordained a deacon by Bishop Hobart. Like his father-in-law, Ives was a supporter of the High Church wing of the Episcopal church. In 1823 he was ordained a priest in Philadelphia by Bishop William White. Episcopal Church career Ives was rector of Trinity Church, Southwark, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from 1823 to 1827; later he served as assistant minister at Trinity Church, New York, and as rector at St. James Church, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, until 1831. After the unexpected death of the Right Reverend John Stark Ravenscroft in 1830, Ives was elected bishop of North Carolina on May 21, 1831. He was the 25th bishop of the ECUSA, and was consecrated by bishops William White, Henry Ustick Onderdonk, and Benjamin Treadwell Onderdonk. For many years Ives's views and those of the lay delegates of the diocese coincided. As a bishop Ives took great interest in the education and religious training of the black community. Having become deeply attracted to the Oxford Movement while studying Church history, Ives founded a religious community called the Brotherhood of the Holy Cross at Valle Crucis, North Carolina. Its members (a few clergymen and zealous laymen) observed a community rule and preached Tractarian ideas. Ives was sympathetic to the idea that a number of Anglican practices, rituals, and theological ideas had been too hastily been discarded during the English Reformation. These views were not shared by members of the Low Church party who felt that it tended to obscure the differences between Anglicanism and Roman Catholicism. So enthusiastic was the brotherhood for Tractarian theories that in 1848, Ives was arraigned before the convention of the Episcopal Church. His explanations were accepted for a time, but the \\"Brotherhood of the Holy Cross\\" was dissolved.Meehan, Thomas. \\"Levi Silliman Ives.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 15 August 2019 Conversion to Roman Catholicism \\"The apostles doctrine and fellowship.\\" Five sermons preached in the principal churches of his diocese, during his spring visitation, 1844 Despite these concessions, Ives's theological convictions continued to evolve until he was no longer able to accept that his denomination was a branch of the true Catholic church. \\"But in a time of rabid, irrational anti-Catholicism, Ives's espousal of a more inclusive and flexible historical catholicism within Anglicanism received a suspicious and horrified hearing.\\"Malone, Michael T. \\"Ives, Levi Silliman\\", Dictionary of North Carolina Biography, University of North Carolina Press. 1988 In 1852, after obtaining a six-month leave of absence, the 55-year-old cleric left for Europe with his wife. They went to Rome, where, on December 22, 1852, he sent a letter to the convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in North Carolina resigning his office of Bishop of North Carolina in view of his decision to join the Catholic Church. Ives was the first Anglican bishop since John Clement Gordon, Bishop of Galloway in the Scottish Episcopal Church, to convert to Catholicism. Signalling his prominence, it was Pope Pius IX who received him on December 26, 1852. Some months later, his wife also converted to Catholicism. In 1854, Ives published his apologia, The Trials of a Mind in its Progress to Catholicism. The book was met with at least one extensive, critical review by an anonymous ex-clergyman. After two years in Rome, the Iveses returned to New York. As a lay Roman Catholic, whose marriage barred him from the priesthood, Ives spent his last years as a professor of rhetoric at St. John's College (now Fordham University). He also lectured at St. Joseph's Seminary and the convents of the Sacred Heart and Sisters of Charity, as well as concerning himself in charity work. He was also one of the founders of Manhattan College (a Catholic college now located in Riverdale, New York) and served as the first chairman of its board of trustees (1863-1867). Ives was a moving force behind the establishment in 1863 of \\"The Society for the Protection of Destitute Roman Catholic Children in the City of New York\\", which founded the New York Catholic Protectory, an institution for the shelter and training of the young, designed to afford neglected or abandoned children shelter, food, raiment and the rudiments of an education in religion, morals, science and manual training or industrial pursuits.Munch, Janet Butler. \\"At Home in the Bronx: Children at the New York Catholic Protectory 1865-1938\\".

After the final demarcation of the government land, in 1840s on non-colonized by Greeks territory moved former Ukrainian Cossacks and state peasants (see state serf) from various counties of Poltava Governorate and Kharkov Governorate (Little Russia). After the partition of Poland, at the end of 18th century here were also exiled Polish people from the Kyiv and Podolia governorates who also were under a special supervision by the local administration.

As a state village, Marinka belonged to the fourth stan of Aleksandrovsk county, Yekaterinoslav Governorate. The village administration consisted of a village senior (head of village), a tax collector, a secretary, and a supervisor. The city was under German occupation between 1941 and 1943.

It is the successor to NCAA Football 2003 in the NCAA Football series. The player on the cover is former USC quarterback Carson Palmer. The game is available for play with the N-Gage. Commentators are Brad Nessler, Kirk Herbstreit and Lee Corso. The game is an EA Sports Bio game, and is compatible with other games with the feature (Madden NFL 2004 and NASCAR Thunder 2004, for example). Gameplay The game's gameplay is similar to NCAA Football 2003, but with updated player stats and rosters. Players can rename players or create their own college team. If the player named the school after one of the schools in the game, the announcers use its name and fight song in the game. The game features new on-field presentation features such as players walking out of their locker room area and then onto the field behind a group of flag bearers. It also features player touchdown celebrations which can result in a penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct. Reception The game's reviews varied across consoles. According to video game review aggregator Metacritic, the PlayStation 2 release received \\"universal acclaim\\" and the GameCube and Xbox releases received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, while the N-Gage release's reviews were \\"average\\".

Program development was funded by the United States Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Serviceshttp://www.cops.usdoj.gov/Default.asp?Item=461 to train police recruits once they graduate from the police academy. It was initially developed to replace the 30-year-old Field Training Officer (FTO) program, which research surveys indicated had become incompatible with community based policing and problem solving. The PTO Program was created by a team of police experts from the United States and Canada. The team was led by Reno Police Chief Jerry Hoover and included Deputy Chief Ron Glensor, Commander Steve Pitts, Officer Dave Ponte (Reno P.D.), police educator Gerry Cleveland and researcher Gregory Saville, former Canadian police officers. Cleveland and Saville designed and wrote the program with input from the team. The program was field tested for the first time in 2000 in the Reno Police Department, Reno, Nevada. It was later expanded into five other pilot police academies, through assistance of the Police Executive Research Forum and the COPS Office. Those agencies include Charlotte-Mecklenberg (North Carolina), Colorado Springs (Colorado), Richmond (California), Lowell (Massachusetts), and Savannah (Georgia). Through the Police Society for Problem Based Learning (www.pspbl.org) the model has been developed and employed in hundreds of departments in the U.S. and Canada. As of 2017 more than 200 police agencies have now successfully adopted the PTO program using problem based learning as the basis of recruit training, and Washington, California and Kentucky, South Dakota and most Canadian Provinces have begun adopting it across those regions A version of the PTO Program was reworked in 2003 by practitioners from Reno and organizations across the United States to better reflect the use of the model by some organizations. A 2nd generation of the PTO was sponsored and written by the Police Society for Problem Based Learning and authored by the original writers, Cleveland and Saville in 2015. (http://www.pspbl.org/) The authors introduced it at the annual meeting of pspbl.org and many agencies have upgraded their model from the original versions. The latest version incorporates 15 years of learning from the original agencies. Early Modifications - known as the Reno Model and others - differ from the original COPS product and the earlier San Jose Model FTO Program. The modifications focus less on adult learning, Emotional Intelligence and Problem based learning. The 2015 upgraded version (PTO v2 - distributed through the non- profit Police Society for Problem Based Learning and reworked by other agencies since the original national PTO model was designed to allow flexible tailoring by each agency. For example, this is the case in the Charlotte- Mecklenberg police, NC, the Folsom police, CA., and the Edmonton police, Alberta, Canada. Each year a number of these models are brought to the Conference of the Police Society for Problem Based Learning and fine tuned by educational experts, police practitioners and agencies from across North America. In 2003 Gerry Cleveland and Gregory Saville, while working for the US Department of Justice, brought versions of the PTO and Police Problem-Based Learning model to the national police academy of Mozambique, Africa, in an effort to tailor it to developing countries; In 2008 Cleveland and Saville brought the model to the middle east at a national police training facility in Qatar and also to the Australian police academy in Sydney and Perth. Jerry Hover worked in Sudan and Iraq for the US government after his retirement from Reno. Due to success of the program, a subsequent certification process was developed for police instructors called Police Problem Based Learning (PBL) for Instructor Development. Also funded by the COPS Office, the program led to the creation of the non-profit, non-affiliated Police Society for Problem Based Learning, an international organization of police instructors interested in improving all aspects of police education.http://www.pspbl.com/pto.htm See also * You in Blue - Police Training Resource book for New officers.

The three main school divisions encompassing the city are the Regina Board of Education (also known as the Regina public school board; the largest school division in the province), Regina Catholic Schools, the Roman Catholic school board, and the Conseil des √âcoles Fransaskoises - also known as C√âF, the provincial Francophone school division. The public system has approximately 21,000 students enrolled across the city; the Catholic board has an enrolment number of approximately 10,000 students; and C√âF has about 500 students in this city. There are also a number of independent schools located in Regina, including Luther College High School and Regina Christian School. Historically, the publicly funded separate schools were exclusively for the children of Catholic and Francophone families, who were, by way of ensuring continued support for the separate school system and also as a matter of Catholic doctrine, discouraged from enrolling in the public schools, which were officially secular but which originally maintained a degree of de facto Protestant religious education. Latterly, with a broadly secular ethos having taken hold across Canadian society and the general school population being considerably lower than in the past, enrollment by non-Catholic children in separate schools and by Catholic children in public schools has been less discouraged. This reflects that curricula for all schools in Saskatchewan are set by the provincial department of education, known as Saskatchewan Learning. Francophone Education in Regina was inaugurated in 1980 when the city's francophone parents opened their own school. In the coming years, they would successfully seek to obtain control of their own school board through the courts, which eventually led to an amended Education Act in 1995 that effectively created a third public and legal entity of education in the province: la Division scolaire francophone No. 310. In Saskatchewan, elementary school generally takes place from Kindergarten until completion of Grade 8; education to this level has always been mandatory. Secondary school generally takes place from Grade 9 until completion of Grade 12, with the exception of some schools which offer specialized K-12 programs and alternative schools. With exception to Mother Teresa Middle School in Regina and Sion Middle School in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan has declined to introduce specialized \\"junior high schools\\". The first school opened in Regina in 1883, a year after the city was officially incorporated. It was located in the home of Miss Fanny Laidlaw.

The Latin text is from the Vulgate translation of the Book of Psalms, Psalm 113:9 in Vulgate numbering (Psalm 115:1 in Greek/Hebrew numbering): N≈çn n≈çbƒ´s, Domine, n≈çn n≈çbƒ´s, sed n≈çminƒ´ tu≈ç dƒÅ gl≈çriam (KJV: \\"Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name give the glory\\"). History Medieval As part of Psalm 113 (In exitu Israel) it was recited liturgically as part of the Paschal vigil, the celebrants kneeling in a gesture of self-abasement when this verse was reached. It was reported that the war flag of the Knights Templar, Baucent, had been inscribed with the verse. A. E. Waite, A New Encyclopedia of Freemasonry vol. 1 (1921), p. 67 Renaissance Jean Mouton (c. 1459‚Äì1522) composed a motet to a text beginning with the Non nobis to celebrate the birth of a daughter to Louis XII and Anne of Brittany in 1510. Non nobis Domine is now known in the form of a 16th-century canon derived from two passages in the motet Aspice Domine (a5) by the South Netherlandish lutenist and composer Philip van Wilder, who worked at the English court from c. 1520 until his death in 1554. Van Wilder's motet contains both the two related motifs which were apparently extracted from the motet by a later musician during the reign of Elizabeth I to form the canon subject. Although the two passages are not heard consecutively, they are linked as they both set the text phrase non est qui consoletur (\\"there is none to console [her]\\"), which was presumably the text to which the canon was originally sung. The' Non est qui consoletur' canon (reconstruction) Van Wilder's motet was widely sung in Elizabethan recusant circles, and is preserved in as many as seven Tudor manuscripts.. It provided a model for Byrd's famous Civitas sancti tui (Ne irascaris Domine Part II). One factor in its popularity was undoubtedly its text, a responsory from the Roman Breviary and Sarum Breviary which was sung during the weeks before Advent. It laments the desolation of the Holy City in language derived from Jeremiah: Texts of this type (which also feature widely in Byrd's penitential and political motets of the 1580s) were widely read by the Elizabethan recusant community in contemporary terms as expressions of Catholic nostalgia for the old religious order. The Non est qui consoletur canon was probably widely sung in recusant circles with the same connotations. Although this version has not survived in written form, the canon subject was simple enough to have been memorized and transmitted orally. Early modern period The next stage in the development of the canon was the text substitution which occurred early in the 17th century. This is clear from the earliest known notated source, the so-called Bull MS (also known as Tisdale's Virginal Book)(Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum MS 782 f. 122.) completed about 1620. There it is given with no text, but it is clear from the contour of the melody and the repeated notes that this version was designed to fit the Non nobis Domine text, which must have been in place by this time. The 'Non nobis Domine canon The new text had a liturgical significance for contemporary listeners which is not immediately obvious today. The words, which form the first verse of Psalm 115 in the Protestant translations of the Psalter, are quoted in the First Collect at Matins in the special Office of thanksgiving instituted by Act of the Parliament of Great Britain following the failure of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and added to the Book of Common Prayer. The psalm text, which forms a focus for the rest of the collect, supplies the background to the new version of the canon, which must have been sung in many loyal Protestant households on 5 November (the anniversary of the discovery of the plot) as an act of thanksgiving for deliverance and a counterblast to the Catholic version. The collect, which remained in the prayer book until 1859, would have served as a constant reminder of the patriotic associations of the Non nobis Domine canon: this does much to explain its continued popularity in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Matins service, and by association the canon, took on an additional layer of meaning in 1688, when William of Orange, with characteristic political astuteness, landed with his troops on November 5, thus creating an association in the popular imagination between William's invasion and the liberation of the realm from Popery, represented by his predecessor the Catholic King James II. A second collect, giving thanks for the Glorious Revolution, was then added to the service. Non nobis Domine appeared in print in Playford's Musical Banquet (1651), Hilton's Catch that catch can (1652) and Playford's Introduction to the Skill of Musick (1655), in all three cases anonymously. In 1715 the musician and antiquarian Thomas Tudway attributed it to Thomas Morley (Lbm Harley 7337 f. -192v). Another antiquarian, the unreliable Johann Christoph Pepusch, printed it in his Treatise on Harmony (1730) with an attribution to Byrd which, though unfounded, has gained traditional acceptance. This attribution was repeated in the earliest known Continental source, Johann Mattheson's Der vollkommene Capellmeister (1739). The canon forms the basis of the first movement of Concerto III from a set of six Concerti armonici by Count Unico Wilhelm van Wassenaer (formerly attributed to Giovanni Battista Pergolesi or Carlo Ricciotti) published in The Hague in 1739, where it is labelled Canone di Palestrina, and it is printed as an appendix to a set of concertos by Richard Mudge published by John Walsh in 1749. There are surviving copies of the Non nobis Domine canon in the hands of both Mozart and Beethoven. Shakespeare, in Henry V Act IV Scene 8, has the king proclaim the singing of both the Non nobis and the Te Deum after the victory at Agincourt. The canon is sung in the 1944 film of Henry V (starring Laurence Olivier), though we now know that the retexted version was not in existence as early as 1599, when the play was written. There is no stage direction in the play to indicate the singing of Non nobis Domine , but if Shakespeare had a specific setting in mind he was probably thinking anachronistically of a Protestant metrical psalm tune. However, in Hall's Chronicle (1542) Non nobis is sung as part of the complete psalm, presumably to plainsong or faburden. Modern history In England the canon came to form part of the repertory of glee clubs in the 18th and 19th centuries, and has traditionally been sung as a grace at public dinners. In modern times it has been quoted by Michael Tippett in his Shires Suite (1970). For the 1989 film adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry V by Kenneth Branagh, Patrick Doyle composed (and sang) a completely different setting that adapted the words slightly.  Usage  Non nobis Domine is usually sung as a three-part perpetual canon with the two following voices entering at the lower fourth and lower octave in relation to the lead melody (dux). This is the version given in most of the early sources, but many other solutions are technically possible, a fact which has perhaps contributed much to its enduring appeal. Non nobis Domine is the official school song of St. Henry's Marist College Durban, South Africa, the PREB school of textile design; Belfast High School, Foxford Comprehensive School, Coventry, Jordanstown, Northern Ireland; Coleraine High School, Coleraine, Northern Ireland; Craigholme Girls School, Glasgow; and The High School For Girls, Gloucester. It is also the school song of Richard Challoner School, London and the Covenant School of Dallas which is a classical, Christian private school in Dallas, TX. It is the song of the St. Charles Garnier College, of Qu√©bec City, the oldest comprehensive secondary school in Canada. It is also the official slogan of Guildford County School in Surrey, UK. Non nobis was also the school song of Lady Edridge Grammar School for Girls, Selhurst, Croydon, Surrey. Lady Edridge was next to the Crystal Palace Football Club ground, Clifton Road, and demolished in the 1980s. However, their version was written by Rudyard Kipling, with music by Roger Quilter (links below). This version was also the school song of Purley County Grammar School for Girls, Stoneyfield Road, Old Coulsdon, Surrey which was also demolished in the 1980s. This song was also the school song of Parklands Girls High School, Seacroft, and Cockburn High School, Beeston, Leeds, West Yorkshire. Parklands was the last remaining all girls school in Leeds and was closed in recent years, The Cockburn High School building was closed because of asbestos contamination, but the School was transferred to another area of Beeston. It was also the school hymn of Cirencester Grammar School (1461 to 1966). Mount Temple Comprehensive School in Clontarf, Dublin has it as a school song, and is sung annually at the carol service. Coleraine High School used Non nobis Domine as their school song before it was passed on to Belfast High School on 25 March 2015. In addition Bromley Technical High School, Bromley, Kent had it as the school song in the 1950s. It is currently the school song of Bishop Anstey High School in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. Non Nobis is also the name of a Portuguese hard rock/heavy metal record label founded in 1992 in Tomar, but today are based in Lisbon. References Sources *D.

History Richterswil is first mentioned in 1265 as Richtliswile. Aerial view from 200 m by Walter Mittelholzer (1919) During the 17th Century, a series of peasant revolts broke out across Switzerland. One of these revolts, the 1645/46 W√§denswiler Steueraufstand (W√§denswil tax revolt), occurred around Lake Z√ºrich and involved the village of Richterswil. The Richterswiler Weibel Rudolf Goldschmid was one of the leaders of the revolt who was executed in Z√ºrich following the failure of the revolt. During the first Villmergen war (1656) Richterswil was invaded by an army from Schwyz. During the second Villmergen war, the newly built fortifications above the city, prevented another invasion. Under the French established Helvetic Republic Richterswil was part of the District of Horgen, and had a higher tax rate than surrounding villages. As part of this higher tax, during the War of the Second Coalition (1799), it was forced to house French troops. Following the unsuccessful uprising in 1804 (Bockenkrieg) against Z√ºrich, Richterswil was punished severely. From 1803-1831 it was part of the District of W√§denswil, but since 1831 has belonged to the District of Horgen. Since 1831, Samstagern has been part of the municipality Richterswil.Forum Samstagern In 1869 the majority of citizens of Richterswil voted against the new democratic cantonal constitution.

Between 1939 and 1945 several hundred thousand POWs of 55 nations passed through the camp. Due to the bad conditions in which they were housed, thousands died there of hunger, disease, or were killed by the guards. Estimates of the number of dead range from 8,000 to 50,000. Establishment and operation Sandbostel lies 9 km south of Bremerv√∂rde, 43 km northeast of Bremen. In what was then the Province of Hanover, the Lutheran Church of the State of Hanover opened a camp for out of work singles and employed them in public works (roadworks, amelioration) in 1932, during the Great Depression. In 1933, the Reichsarbeitsdienst took over the camp and used it later as a Nazi internment camp for undesirables. In August 1939, a commission of Heeresbauamt Bremen (military construction department) decided to create a Mannschafts-Stammlager (POW camp) for the local Wehrkreis X. In September, construction of the camp began between the village of Sandbostel and the Arbeitsdienstlager in the Teufelsmoor. The latter area was now used as barracks to house the Wehrmacht guards. Beginning in September 1939, Polish POWs were used to expand the camp. Initially, huts for around 10,000 prisoners were built. Once it began operating, the camp was divided into several sub-camps: * a Stalag holding enlisted men from the occupied countries (Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Southeastern Europe and Italy after the armistice) * an officers' camp ( Oflag ) for officers from the occupied countries. In 1941, this part of the camp was merged with Oflags elsewhere * a Marinelager ( Marlag ), controlled by the Kriegsmarine, holding British sailors, marines and officers. In the fall of 1941, this part of the camp was moved to Westertimke * an Internierungslager ( Ilag ), or internment camp for civilian citizens of enemy nations, including members of the British merchant marine. This section was also moved in 1941 to Westertimke (see: Marlag und Milag Nord) POW's in Sandbostel 1941 - 1943 At first, prisoners were housed in tents, but from spring 1940 inmates constructed masonry huts. Later, prefabricated wooded huts were added. By 1941, there were over 100 huts housing prisoners as well as latrines, kitchens, buildings for punishment confinement and the commandant's office. In addition, there was a hospital (Reservelazarett X-B) and a punishment work camp of two huts inside the moor. By 1940, after the German victory over France, the camp was filled beyond capacity. Stalag X-B was then expanded to house a total of 30,000 prisoners. From the fall of 1941, sections of the camp were cleared or moved to make room for Soviet prisoners taken during \\"Operation Barbarossa\\". The camp now administered hundreds of Arbeitskommandos each made up of around 30 forced labourers. These were supplied to local farmers and industry. There was a clear hierarchy among prisoners. At the top were British and American POWs, generally treated correctly according to the Geneva Convention and receiving numerous aid packages from the International Red Cross. As a consequence, they were well-fed until the very end of the war, when transportation and supply links broke down. Prisoners from western Europe (French, Belgians) were also treated as POWs but received less outside help and were not as well-nourished. However, they were in contact with international help organisations. Serbian and Polish nationals were denied access to outside observers. Italians, who came here after September 1943, were deemed traitors by both the German guards and the other prisoners and were at the low end of the hierarchy. They were ill-fed and from the fall of 1944 forced to work with the Wehrmacht or be treated as civilian forced labour. Worst-off of all were the Soviet POWs. They were denied POW status, received no outside food, and were not allowed access to international observers. Guards had a special shoot-to-kill policy for them. Due to the ill- treatment of the Soviets and a lack of shelter, several epidemics broke out among them. Thousands of them died from disease, starvation and brutal treatment by guards. They were buried in mass graves on the camp graveyard (today's war cemetery). Among the Italian prisoners, who were mostly soldiers who did not surrender to the German army after the Cassibile armistice, was journalist and writer Giovannino Guareschi, who wrote La favola di Natale (\\"A Christmas Fable\\") there on Christmas 1944. The Canadian Neurologist Charles Miller Fisher, who served as a Lieutenant Commander in the Canadian navy, was interned in this camp after being torpedoed and rescued by a German ship. In August 1944, all POW camps were removed from Wehrmacht control and were assigned to Heinrich Himmler's Schutzstaffel (SS). Although this was without immediate consequences at Sandbostel, in January 1945 POWs were evacuated here from other camps closer to the frontline. In the final phase of the war, concentration camp prisoners were relocated to Sandbostel. Around 9,000 former inmates of Neuengamme concentration camp and its subcamps were transferred to Stalag X-B in April 1945. They were housed in the former Marlag and guarded well but otherwise left to their own devices: they received no medical help despite rampant diseases, sanitary conditions were dire and the inmates went virtually without food. On 20 April, most of the SS members guarding that section of Stalag X-B marched out of the camp with several hundred prisoners. After that, the POWs were allowed to help the remaining former concentration camp inmates with some of their own food. Liberation Letter dated 21 April 1945 about the handover of the camp, exhibited at Neuengamme concentration camp. The camp was liberated on 29 April 1945 by the British Armed Forces of XXX Corps following fighting with the German 15th Panzergrenadier-Division. The camp commandant, however, realizing that the end of the war was close, had already agreed to hand over control of the camp to the prisoners, led by the French Colonel Marcel Albert. On 21 April, the same day that the officer ordered to take control of the camp complained to his superiors about conditions there (see picture), two prisoners carried the call for assistance from the camp to the Guards Armoured Division at Zeven. Two armoured units were sent to Sandbostel but fighting delayed their arrival until 29 April. The British discovered around 15,000 surviving POWs in the camp, as well as around 8,000 KZ-inmates. The camp was divided into three sections when liberated. The first contained allied prisoners in unsatisfactory conditions, but generally in compliance with the International Red Cross Convention. Soviet prisoners, without the Convention's protection, were in substantially worse conditions. In the third section were around 8,000 civilian prisoners in appalling conditions, described in the Army medical history as \\"utterly horrifying\\"; \\"everywhere the dead and dying sprawled amid the slime of human excrement.\\"Two Weeks in May 1945, Clifford Barnard, Quaker Home Service, 1999. According to members of the British forces present at the liberation, conditions were so bad, they referred to the Stalag as \\"Little Belsen\\" in a reference to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The commander of the British Forces in north-western Germany, General Brian Horrocks, was called in and ordered local German civilians and medical orderlies to help with the clean-up, and to bury the numerous dead bodies. Like at Bergen-Belsen, despite the best efforts of the British, hundreds of inmates died every day immediately following the liberation as a result of starvation, typhus and other diseases. Estimates of the total number of people who died here in 1939-45 range between 8,000 and 50,000. There is evidence of at least 5,162 dead. Claims of up to 46,000 killed Soviets alone were made by the Soviet Union but are considered to be exaggerated. Inmates were cleaned and transferred to an improvised hospital outside the camp and thence to convalescence camps. The former Marlag was burned between 16 and 25 May to prevent a typhus epidemic and the last 350 patients left the hospital on 3 June. Other, more serviceable, huts were used by the British to house imprisoned Nazis and SS members, who were awaiting trial. Cemeteries POW camps were required by Wehrmacht regulations to have a cemetery close-by. Initially, the dead of Stalag X-B were buried in the war cemetery at Parnewinkel, where a World War I POW camp had been located previously. As the number of dead rose in 1940, a second cemetery was established near Sandbostel, about 1.2 kilometres from the camp. Non-Soviet and Soviet POWs were treated differently even in death. The former were buried with military honours in individual graves, the latter in 70 mass graves. At Sandbostel, the cemetery has two sections. Gr√§berfeld 1 includes the mass graves. In 1954-56 Gr√§berfeld 2 received the roughly 2,400 dead among the former concentration camp inmates who could not be identified. Post-war use British internment camp As early as 8 July 1945, the British military authorities established one of nine civilian internment camps in a part of the former Stalag X-B. At \\"No. 2 Civil Internment Camp\\" or \\"No. 2 CIC\\" around 5,000 males, including SS members, were interned. Soon, inmates were subject to \\"re-education\\", intended to turn Nazi supporters in democrats. To further this goal, internees were allowed to publish their own newspaper Der Windstoss. In June 1947, the trials began at the Spruchkammergericht at Stade. Internees were not charged with individual crimes but with membership in a criminal organisation, as defined by the Nuremberg trials. The court handed down 3,500 verdicts, ranging from several months to six years imprisonment. However, the time of internment was counted as time served, so many of the defendants were released immediately following the trial. After the last inmates were released on 9 March 1948, the British closed the camp on 1 August 1948. Prison In March 1948, the Justice Department of the State of Lower Saxony established the Strafgef√§ngnis Lager Sandbostel at the site of the Stalag. This prison soon housed around 600 male inmates, imprisoned for periods between two months and two years, mostly for property-related crimes, in six large huts. The prison featured a small hospital, workshops and a Protestant church. Around 110 people worked there, mostly German refugees from the eastern territories lost after WW II. In 1952, the prison was dissolved due to falling numbers of incarcerated. Camp for refugees from the GDR Beginning in 1952, parts of the camp were used as an emergency reception centre for refugees from communist Eastern Germany or GDR. On 1 April 1952, the Federal Ministry for Refugees established the Notaufnahmelager Sandbostel for young male refugees aged 15 to 24. In September 1952, a similar camp for women was established at the site of the POW camp at Westertimke. These two camps were under the supervision of the Durchgangslager Uelzen-Bohldamm and a committee decided on individuals' admission to Western Germany or to West- Berlin. Refugees also received help in finding jobs or apprenticeship positions. Most of the young people were in the camp for just one or two weeks. At Sandbostel, their number averaged around 800, at Westertimke around 300. Daily intake at Sandbostel was up to 100, with roughly the same number leaving each day. In total, around 250,000 young men and 80,000 young women passed through the camps. This use ended around 1960. Bundeswehr and business park In 1963, the German armed forces took over the remaining huts of the camp and used them to store medical supplies. Ten years later, in 1973, the Bundeswehr stopped using the facility. The Ministry of Defence for a while considered building a barracks at the site, but eventually chose Seedorf as the location. In 1974, the business park \\"Immenhain\\" was established in the area of the camp not given over to agricultural use. Businesses set up there included a horse-riding establishment, a reject shop, a militaria shop and a brothel. This use of the former camp area only ended with the establishment of the memorial in the 2000s. Memorial A Soviet memorial erected at the cemetery site in 1945 was dynamited in 1956 by orders of the Bremerv√∂rde district authorities and the Lower Saxony Ministry of the Interior, due to the memorial's excessive claims regarding the number of victims. Its inscription had read \\"Hier ruhen 46.000 russische Soldaten und Offiziere, zu Tode gequ√§lt in der Nazigefangenschaft\\" (\\"Here lie 46,000 Russian soldiers and officers, tortured to death in Nazi imprisonment\\"). The remains of most non-Soviet POWs were repatriated to their countries of origin. The Italians were reinterred at the Italian war cemetery at Hamburg-√ñjendorf. Only around 170 individual graves of POWs from Poland, Yugoslavia or of unknown nationality remain in the graveyard at Sandbostel. A private club was founded in 1992 to work for the maintenance of the camp site. Since that year, most of the huts were treated as listed or protected buildings. The creation of a memorial at the site of the former camp met with substantial local opposition. In 2004, a foundation (Stiftung Lager Sandbostel) was established. Following three years of preparations, the Gedenkst√§tte Sandbostel was opened in 2007. In April 2013, the permanent exhibition was opened. Out of a total of around 150 huts, more than 20 remain (largely in the area that used to house the Soviet prisoners). Some appear mostly as they did in the 1940s, others have been altered to serve changing needs in the post-war period.

However, he did work extensively on Talk Sport's radio commentary of the event. His first media job was covering speedway at Belle Vue in Manchester for Piccadilly Radio in 1980. He moved onto local North West football and contributed darts coverage on a weekly show called Talking Sport.http://www.dartsmad.com/darts-news/2013/07/20/gwynne-checks-out-on- double-top/ His first properly paid commentating job was covering Lancashire County Cricket Club matches for a phone line based service called Cricket Call. He did this from 1988 until 1991. In 1989 and 1990 Gwynne, with the help of darts entrepreneur, Dick Allix, set up a darts phone line service called The Darts Line where Gwynne would provide darts news and tournament updates to a paid phone number that people would call up. The Darts Line opened the doors to the darts world and before long Gwynne was commentating on darts tournaments for regional ITV television with Dave Lanning. When the darts split occurred in 1993 and Sky Sports took up coverage of WDC (later to become the PDC) tournaments, Lanning & Gwynne were the natural choices as commentators. Sid Waddell was still working with the BBC and wouldn't join Sky until the 1994 World Matchplay Championship. Gwynne and Lanning commentated on the very first WDC World Championship at the Circus Tavern in 1994. Gwynne, Lanning and Waddell commentated together for the first time on the World Matchplay at Blackpool in July 1994. He remains a regular match reporter on Sky's Gillette Soccer Saturday. From April 2014, he is also providing expert analysis on William Hill's online betting service and In_play Radio service. Other work Gwynne is an after-dinner speaker and toastmaster. He also MCs darts exhibitions and runs local darts tournaments in the Manchester area. From the start of the 2019 season he is the announcer for Lancashire County Cricket Club. He wrote a monthly column \\"The Mancunian Way\\" for Darts World Magazine (previously titled Piccadilly Line) for 31 years and at one time was responsible for 'ghost writing' Wayne Mardle's column, Wayne's World in the same magazine. He also wrote for the local North West newspapers, covering local darts, for nearly 30 years. He gave up both in 2011. He is chairman of the Manchester Superleague and Manchester Log-End Federation, which he founded in 2003 to save the log-end dartboard from extinction. He works for the International Socca Federation. He sponsors PDC youth player Shaun Griffiths. Personal life He was born in Shropshire in 1945 and moved to Manchester in 1957. He attended Chorlton Grammar School and on leaving went into teaching. He taught English and was Deputy Housemaster (Fisher) at Moston Brook High School in Manchester. His son, Andrew, is the Labour MP for Denton and Reddish in Greater Manchester. He is a lifelong fan of Manchester City F.C.

More formally, the exponential map at point , is defined on , the entire tangent space at . Equivalently, consider a maximal geodesic \\\\ell\\\\colon I\\\\to M. Here I is an open interval of , and, because geodesics are parameterized with \\"constant speed\\", it is uniquely defined up to transversality.

A manifold is geodesically complete if for any such geodesic \\\\ell, we have that I=(-\\\\infty,\\\\infty). Examples and non-examples Euclidean space , the spheres , and the tori (with their natural Riemannian metrics) are all complete manifolds. All compact Riemannian manifolds and all homogeneous manifolds are geodesically complete. Every finite-dimensional path-connected Riemannian manifold which is also a complete metric space (with respect to the Riemannian distance) is geodesically complete. In fact, geodesic completeness and metric completeness are equivalent for these spaces. This is the content of the Hopf‚ÄìRinow theorem.  Non-examples  A simple example of a non- complete manifold is given by the punctured plane (with its induced metric). Geodesics going to the origin cannot be defined on the entire real line. By the Hopf‚ÄìRinow theorem, we can alternatively observe that it is not a complete metric space: any sequence in the plane converging to the origin is a non- converging Cauchy sequence in the punctured plane. There exist non- geodesically complete compact pseudo-Riemannian (but not Riemannian) manifolds. It is the case for example of the Clifton‚ÄìPohl torus. In the theory of general relativity, which describes gravity in terms of a pseudo-Riemannian geometry, many important examples of geodesically incomplete spaces arise, e.g. non-rotating uncharged black-holes or cosmologies with a Big Bang. The fact that such incompleteness is fairly generic in general relativity is shown in the Penrose‚ÄìHawking singularity theorems.

In the book, Mooney discusses the Republican Party leadership's stance on science, and in particular that of the George W. Bush administration, with regard to issues such as climate change denialism, intelligent design, bioethics, alternative medicine, pollution, separation of church and state, and the government funding of education, research, and environmental protection. The book argues that the administration regularly distorted and/or suppressed scientific research to further its own political aims. The book was reviewed in Science and Nature Medicine as well as the popular press. It was featured on the cover of The New York Times Book Review and selected as an \\"Editors' Choice\\" by The New York Times which described it as, \\"A frankly polemical survey of scientific findings and procedures in collision with political operations.\\" Filmmaker Morgan Spurlock (of Super Size Me fame) optioned the rights for the book to create a documentary film, but in 2008 announced that he had released the option.  Reviews  In scientific journals A review in Science by Naomi Oreskes states the author recounts the 20-year campaign by \\"influential Republicans‚Äîinitially in Congress and now also in the White House‚Äîin concert with determined allies in private industry and fundamentalist Christian organizations\\" to systematically deny, disparage and misrepresent scientific information related to public policy. She gave the following list of topics, \\"acid rain, global warming, the efficacy of condoms in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, the health impacts of excess dietary sugar and fat, the alleged link between abortion and breast cancer, the status of endangered species, the efficacy of abstinence-only sex education programs, the therapeutic potential of adult stem cells, and more.\\" Oreskes goes on to detail the tactics used in the attempt to mislead both the public and politicians, \\"misrepresenting real debates, exaggerating uncertainty, interfering with the activities of expert agencies, trumpeting the views of outlier scientists whose interpretations are rarely to be found in the refereed literature, and attacking the integrity of genuine experts.\\" She states that Mooney points out that multiple misinformation campaigns have involved the same individuals and groups. Oreskes concludes, \\"Mooney's book makes it clear that when sensible people stand on the sidelines, a great deal of nonsense can be spread.\\" Michael Stebbins wrote in Nature Medicine that \\"This book should serve as a harsh wake-up call to the scientific community and the American public.\\" He stated that Mooney \\"painstakingly documents the roots of the efforts to undercut the influence of science on national policy and the relentless politicization of US science policy by conservatives working on behalf of the Republican Party.\\" He notes that the author clearly documents the \\"Bush administrations' attacks on the integrity of science information\\" listing examples that include some of those mentioned by Oreskes and \\"undercutting the Clean Air Act and the Endangered Species Act, and stacking agencies and advisory committees with unqualified ideologues.\\" Stebbins credits the book with providing context by detailing the tactics employed by \\"conservative Republicans\\" and establishing the roots of these undercutting techniques with examples from the last 40 years. He goes on to state, \\"Mooney's documentation of the willful manipulation of science on the part of conservatives to suit an agenda is well supported and nauseating.\\" Stebbins addresses two criticisms of the book, the first, that it doesn't explain the science involved, which he explains is not the purpose of the book, and the second, that it doesn't detail the misuse of science by democrats and liberals, which he dismisses as untrue. He finds issue with the last chapter, which proposes solutions, stating, \\"His suggestions are sound and well thought out, but seem more of an afterthought than a real goal of the book.\\" Daniel Sarewitz panned the book in a review in Issues in Science and Technology describing it as a, \\"tiresome polemic masquerading as a defense of scientific purity.\\" In the popular press In a positive review in Scientific American Boyce Rensenberger described the book as, \\"a well- researched, closely argued and amply referenced indictment of the right wing's assault on science and scientists.\\" Lisa Margonelli of The New York Times Book Review wrote that Mooney, \\"juggled extensive research and sharp arguments [...] with precision and a showman‚Äôs wink that made his unpromising subject fun.\\" Keay Davidson wrote in the Washington Post that \\"Mooney's political heart is in the right place\\" but says \\"Mooney is like a judge who interprets a law one way to convict his enemies and another way to acquit his friends.\\"\\"Research and the Right\\", The republican war on science reviewed by Keay Davidson, The Washington Post September 18, 2005 Writing in The New York Times, John Horgan said of the book that the prose was \\"often clunky and clich√©d\\", but explains that Mooney \\"addresses a vitally important topic and gets it basically right.\\" Horgan defends the book against another reviewer's criticism, saying \\"the journalist Keay Davidson faults Mooney for not acknowledging how hard it can be to distinguish good science from bad... But in many of the cases that [Mooney] examines, demarcation is easy, because one side has an a priori commitment to something other than the truth ‚Äî God or money, to put it bluntly.\\" Stuart Derbyshire, a senior lecturer at the University of Birmingham School of Psychology, praises Mooney and notes that he explained how Republicans had manipulated the uncertainty in science \\"to ensure that Congress rarely hears any consensus opinion that may damage a Bush policy.\\" Derbyshire agrees with Mooney's claim that there is Republican \\"flagrant twisting\\" of research findings and that it \\"violates the integrity of science.\\" Media Mooney was interviewed about the book on Science Friday.

Located at the intersection of Franklin Avenue and Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn, it is served by the: *2, 4 and Franklin Avenue Shuttle (S) trains at all times *3 train at all times except late nights *5 train weekdays only The station complex is named for its proximity to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. The free transfer between the Eastern Parkway and Franklin Avenue shuttle platforms was added in 1999 using a passageway that had existed since October 1928, when the BMT Botanic Garden station opened.

The station is named for the Brooklyn Botanic Garden two blocks away from the station. There was no station at this location until December 1926, when a new station was constructed to replace Consumers Park several blocks to the south, which was considered too close to Prospect Park to be useful. Consumers Park had been renamed Botanic Garden in 1924. The new station assumed this name upon opening on September 30, 1928 and the old station closed at the same time. The station deteriorated over the years as the New York City Transit Authority considered whether to abandon or rehabilitate the station and the line. Support in the Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights communities persuaded the city to rebuild the line from July 1998 to September 1999. A transfer to Franklin Avenue on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line was added via a passageway that connects the Franklin Avenue- bound platform to the IRT mezzanine. Prior to the rehabilitation project, only a portion of the station was in the tunnel, as the platforms were longer and continued outdoors. The station's mezzanine is above the platforms and tracks. Two staircases from each side go up to a waiting area that allows a free transfer between directions (this is needed for passengers transferring between the IRT and Prospect Park-bound trains). Outside of the turnstile bank, there is a token booth and one street stair. The rebuilt station was built in the open-cut right-of-way to the south of Eastern Parkway, and the half of the station closest to that street was roofed over in the appearance of a subway structure. The station is now located entirely inside the subway structure that was built in 1928. At street level, it features floral wrought iron fencing in recognition of its location near the Brooklyn Botanic Garden (entitled IL7/Square by Millie Burns). At track level it includes 1920s-era mosaic tiling. To the immediate north of the station, the 1878 railroad tunnel that carries the line under Eastern Parkway has been dramatically lighted. This is the oldest tunnel currently in subway use.

Both platforms have yellow i-beam columns on both sides at regular intervals with every other one having the standard black station name plate in white lettering. The platform walls have their original Dual Contracts trim line with \\"F\\" tablets for \\"Franklin\\" at regular intervals. At the extreme west (railroad north) end, the platforms were extended in the 1950s to accommodate the current standard IRT train length of 510 feet. The walls here have a blue trim line with \\"FRANKLIN AVE\\" in white sans serif lettering on two lines. The station's main entrance is a mezzanine above the platforms and tracks at their center. Two staircases from each platform go up to a waiting area that allows a free transfer between directions. Outside of the turnstile bank, there is a token booth and four street stairs to either eastern corners of Franklin Avenue and Eastern Parkway. The transfer to the Franklin Avenue Shuttle is at the west end of the station. A single staircase from each platform goes up to a mezzanine, where a passageway leads to the north end of the Franklin Avenue- bound platform. A crossover is required to reach the Prospect Park-bound platform. The station has been adopted by Clara Barton High School as part of New York City Transit's Adopt-A-Station program. Franklin Avenue, along with the President Street station on the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line, are the two closest stations to the City University of New York's Medgar Evers College. In 2019, a bill to add the college's name to both stations' names was passed in the New York state legislature and signed into law. The name of the Franklin Avenue station was officially changed to Franklin Avenue‚ÄìMedgar Evers College on October 1, 2020, both to reflect the station's proximity to the college and to honor the college's namesake, civil rights figure Medgar Evers. Rogers Junction East (railroad south) of this station is Rogers Junction, where trains can diverge to the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line or continue on Eastern Parkway. From west to east between the station and the junction, the northbound local track descends to a lower level directly below the southbound local track. Then, the northbound express track, which is still on the upper level at this point, descends to the lower level directly below the southbound express track, creating a dual level two-over-two track layout. At the junction, a switch on the upper level allows southbound 5 express trains to change to the local track, and a corresponding switch on the lower level allows 5 trains on the northbound local track to change to the express track. Directly to the east, all of the mainline tracks shift slightly to the north, and the mainline local tracks on both levels become the Nostrand Avenue Line tracks, which turn to the south. There is a closed tower at the south end of the southbound platform. This junction is a severe traffic bottleneck during rush hours, and rebuilding it would require massive construction including the tearing up of Eastern Parkway. The reconstruction of the junction in order to alleviate train congestion has been suggested several times. The plan was first unveiled in the 1967 Transportation Studies for Southeast Brooklyn, and subsequently in 1968 as part of the Program for Action. The MTA's Engineering Department Planning Division considered such a project again in 1972. In 1993, as part of the 1992‚Äì1996 Capital Program, the MTA studied seven alternatives for rebuilding the junction. The 1993 study suggested the further scrutiny of two proposals: \\"Alternative 4\\", which would simply add a switch on each level east of the Nostrand Avenue Line split, and \\"Alternative 6\\", which would reconstruct the junction entirely.

It runs for in a northeast to southwest direction from an intersection with NY 224 in the village of Odessa to a junction with NY 227 in the hamlet of Perry City within the town of Hector. NY 228 has a short overlap with NY 79 in the Hector community of Mecklenburg. The route was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, it initially ended at NY 79 in Mecklenburg, from where NY 79 went north to Perry City. NY 79 was realigned to head west from Mecklenburg in the early 1960s, at which time the NY 228 designation was extended northward over NY 79's former routing. Route description NY 228 northbound as a two-lane thoroughfare through the Cayuta Lake area NY 228 begins at an intersection with NY 224 in Odessa. It progresses northward from NY 224 as the two-lane Mecklenburg Road, crossing nearby railroad tracks and entering a more pronounced rural area north of town. The road gradually curves to the northeast, passing by brief wooded areas on its way into the hamlet of Catharine, where NY 228 intersects with County Route 10 (CR 10). At this point, NY 228 turns northward to follow CR 10's right-of-way out of the hamlet. Just outside Catharine, NY 228 begins to parallel the western shoreline of nearby Cayuta Lake, which ends about north of the community. After Cayuta Lake, the road winds its way northward along the base of a largely undeveloped valley to reach the town of Hector and its hamlet of Smith Valley. Here, the valley and NY 228 curve northeastward, following Taughannock Creek through eastern Schuyler County. The route remains on a northeast‚Äìsouthwest alignment to the hamlet of Mecklenburg, where the highway passes some residences ahead of intersections with CR 6 and NY 79\\\\. NY 79 and NY 228 overlap for one block before NY 228 splits to the northeast at the northern edge of the community. The overlap with NY 79 is the busiest section of NY 228, serving an average of 2,556 vehicles per day as of 2009. Outside of Mecklenburg, the road crosses more rural areas in the town of Hector as it heads generally northeastward along Taughannock Creek and approaches the Tompkins County line. The route pulls to within a tenth-mile (0.2 km) of the line at the hamlet of Perry City, where NY 228 ends at an intersection with NY 227\\\\. Also present at the junction is CR 3, a short route leading east to CR 142 at the Tompkins County line. NY 227 enters the intersection from the west; however, it leaves to the north on NY 228's right-of-way. History In 1911, the New York State Legislature created Route 46, an unsigned legislative route extending from Coopers Plains in Steuben County to Trumansburg in Tompkins County via Watkins Glen. East of Watkins Glen, Route 46 proceeded generally northeastward through Burdett, Reynoldsville and Mecklenburg on its way to Trumansburg. On March 1, 1921, the Route 46 designation was reassigned to another highway in Allegany and Steuben counties as part of a partial renumbering of the legislative route system. The section of pre-1921 Route 46 between Mecklenburg and Perry City went unnumbered until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, when it became part of NY 79. At Mecklenburg, NY 79 connected to NY 228, another route assigned in the renumbering that ran southwest from Mecklenburg to NY 224 in Odessa. The road that became NY 228 was state-maintained south of Cayuta Lake by 1926, while the remainder of the highway was rebuilt as a state road . NY 228 went unchanged until the early 1960s when NY 79 was rerouted to follow a previously unnumbered highway west of Mecklenburg instead. The former routing of NY 79 from Mecklenburg to Perry City became an extension of NY 228.

He is considered by many critics to be one of the leading figures of modern art in Hungary of the 20th century. After graduation from secondary school, Lossonczy began law studies, but soon afterward took an entrance examination to the Hungarian Academy of Fine Arts and was accepted. During the 1920s, he traveled frequently to Paris, where he befriended several prominent artists of the period. Upon his return to Hungary, he studied interior design at the Hungarian Academy of Applied Arts, where his interests temporarily shifted from painting to architecture. In 1934, Lossonczy became a member of the Group of Socialist Artists. In 1938, he married Ibolya, a fellow art student. The couple exhibited many of their artworks in their home, but these pieces were destroyed when the house was bombed toward the end of World War II. Lossonczy was a member of the European School, the Avant-garde Artists of the Danube Valley, and the Hungarian Group of Concrete Art. From 1957 to 1968, he taught drawing at an industrial school in Budapest. In 1970, he had a small solo show at the Adolf F√©nyes Gallery, and in 1979 an exhibition of his work was held at Kunsthalle Budapest. Lossonczy is a founding member of the Sz√©chenyi Academy of Letters and Arts, established by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1992. Among his best known works is his large-scale mosaic at the EUR-Magliana metro station in Rome, Italy, which was inaugurated in 1998. Another work, Great Storm Cleanses, is in remembrance of the 1956 Hungarian revolution. Personal life In 1994 he received the Kossuth Prize. After the death of his first wife, Lossonczy remarried. In 2003, his second wife, √âda P√°l, opened the Paris Blue Salon in Budapest, a gallery devoted to his paintings. He died in 2009, aged 105.

It has 41 locations across the United States, including twenty-one (with seven more being built) across Texas. Outside of Texas, it has 4 locations in Virginia (Winchester, Charlottesville, Woodbridge and Ashburn).\\"Alamo Drafthouse expands to D.C..\\" Bizjournals.com Retrieved on April 5, 2012.

There are individual locations in Woodbury, Minnesota, and Raleigh, North Carolina. Others are planned to be built in St. Louis, Missouri; Orlando, Florida; Detroit, Michigan; Crystal City, Virginia; Washington, D.C.; Manhattan and Staten Island, New York. History The Alamo Drafthouse Cinema was founded by Rice University alumni Tim and Karrie League at 409 Colorado St, in an Austin, Texas warehouse district building on Colorado St. (between 4th and 5th) that was being used as a parking garage. The company began as a second- run movie theater, and distinguished itself by the food and drink service offered inside the theater, including cold beers, which continues to set Alamo Drafthouse apart from many other cinemas. The seating is arranged with rows of cabaret style tables in front of each row of seats, with an aisle between each row to accommodate waiter service. Customers write their orders on slips of paper, which are picked up by black-clad waiters. Soon after opening, the original downtown theater began offering occasional unique programming such as silent movies scored by local bands playing live accompaniment, food-themed films such as Like Water for Chocolate served with a dinner matching the meals shown on screen, and retrospectives of various directors and stars. This includes location-based food options depending on the film setting. In 2001, the Leagues renovated a four-screen art-house theater at 2700 Anderson Lane in North Austin, called Village Cinema, which had recently closed, and opened it as an Alamo Drafthouse which specialized in first-run movies. With this new Alamo Drafthouse Village, the downtown location ceased showing second-run movies and began to concentrate almost exclusively on unusual programming including classics, cult classics, independents, documentaries, special guest appearances, and audience participation shows. In 2003, the Alamo Drafthouse opened on 13729 Research Boulevard in northwest Austin. The Alamo Drafthouse Lake Creek had seven screens, all dedicated to new movies. Almost simultaneously, the Alamo granted their first franchise, which opened in the West Oaks Mall in Houston, Texas. In May 2003, Travis Doss opened the first Alamo franchise location (West Oaks Mall) in Houston, Texas with six screens. In July 2004, Tim and Karrie League sold the brand, including the brand name, intellectual property and rights to all future Alamo Drafthouse expansion to the Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas CEO Terrell Braly, John Martin, and David Kennedy, but retained an irrevocable license for the Austin locations (Village, Lamar, Downtown), which includes their Rolling Roadshow.42ND STREET FOREVER VOLUME 5: ALAMO DRAFTHOUSE EDITION (DVD Review) In August 2004, the second largest Alamo (Westlakes) opened in San Antonio, Texas with eight screens. In August 2005, Entertainment Weekly named the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema \\"The #1 movie theater in the country doing it right\\". Since February 2005, the new company has purchased the original franchise unit from Doss, opened a theater in the Katy Area and in Spring, Texas and has built a new- build multi-screen theater in the Rio Grande Valley; though it was announced in 2006 to open, the building has remained unfinished since the original owner was foreclosed upon.Sean Gaffney. \\"Alamo Drafthouse expected to be sold, completed,\\" The Monitor (McAllen, Texas), May 20, 2009. Retrieved 2009-07-02. In 2006, due to rising rent in downtown Austin, theater owners took steps to hand the theater over to a non-profit group called the \\"Heroes of the Alamo\\" foundation, operating the theater as a cultural arts center. However, with the historic Ritz Theater on 6th Street offered as an alternative location, the original Alamo was closed. The final event at the original location consisted of a special triple-feature event the evening of June 27, 2007. The final movie shown was Night Warning, with star Susan Tyrrell attending. At the conclusion of the movie, audience members were allowed to disassemble their seats and take them home as mementos of the theater. Of the first seven theaters, the downtown Austin theater was unique for being the host of many important film events in Austin, such as the Quentin Tarantino Film Festival and Harry Knowles's annual Butt-numb-a-thon. After six months of construction, the Alamo Drafthouse at the Ritz opened on November 2, 2007 with a triple feature of Matango: Attack of the Mushroom People, with a five course mushroom feast; a sneak preview of No Country For Old Men; and a Terror Thursday screening of War of the Gargantuas, introduced by Quentin Tarantino who flew out from Los Angeles for the night to attend the opening. In 2009, the first outside of Texas was opened in Winchester, Virginia. ParkNorth Mall, Uptown San Antonio, Texas A second San Antonio theater opened in 2009 (Park North), with six screens. In June 2010, founder Tim League was brought back in as CEO of the franchise operations. A third San Antonio location (Stone Oak) opened November 5, 2010, with six screens. In 2013, the Lake Creek location was closed upon the opening of the brand new, larger, Lakeline location. In June 2017, the current largest Alamo opened in Springfield, Missouri with 14 screens seating 1,050 people. In March 2019, Business Insider reported that Alamo Drafthouse's movie-ticket subscription service, Alamo Season Pass, will launch nationwide at all Drafthouse theaters by the end of the year with the unlimited plan costing $20 a month in most regions of the country.Alamo Drafthouse Movie Ticket Subscription Plan Will Launch This Year by Jason Guerrasio, Business Insider, March 19, 2019. In March 2020, Alamo Drafthouse announced that all locations were closed temporarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic.. In May 2020, Alamo announced that former Starbucks Exec Shelli Taylor would become the new CEO of Alamo Drafthouse and that founder Tim League would transfer from his current role as CEO to become the Chairman of the Board of Directors. The company announced the launch of \\"Alamo on Demand\\" video streaming service on May 7, 2020.

Children under the age of two are not allowed, except for showings on specific days which are designated \\"Alamo For All\\" showings where parents are encouraged to bring young children, and rules around talking are relaxed. Unaccompanied minors are not allowed in showings, except for members of the Alamo Drafthouse's Victory Vanguard rewards program, which allows 15‚Äì17 year- olds to attend showings unattended after their application to the rewards program has been submitted and reviewed. The application involves demonstrating an understanding of the theater's policies around talking, texting, arriving to the theater late, and basic tipping etiquette. The cinema also prohibits talking and texting during the film. Anyone who violates this policy is subject to warning and potential removal from the premises. Alamo made national headlines in 2011 when the rantings of one angry customer who was ejected for texting were included in its \\"Don't Talk or Text\\" PSA shown before films. \\"When we adopted our strict no talking policy back in 1997, we knew we were going to alienate some of our patrons,\\" Tim League posted on the cinema's website. \\"That was the plan. If you can't change your behavior and be quiet (or unilluminated) during a movie, then we don't want you at our venue.\\" Fantastic Fest Every year in September, the Alamo South Lamar location in Austin hosts a week-long film festival called Fantastic Fest dedicated to the horror, sci-fi, fantasy, Asian and \\"cult\\" film genres. Alamo Lake Creek holds the annual Zombie Film Festival (Dismember the Alamo) and the Off-centered Film Festival. The Ritz and South Lamar locations also participate in the SXSW Film Festival in March. Other events include: *Action Pack - patrons are armed with cap guns in order to shoot at the screen during fun action films (often in-house pyrotechnics are performed as well) *Austin Air Guitar - each competitor has 60 seconds to perform air guitar to a song of one's own choosing *Austin Air Sex - same as the above except for sexual acts *Big Screen Classics - classic movies shown on a Cinemascope screen *Butt-Numb-A- Thon (\\"BNAT\\"), an annual 24-hour film marathon in honor of Harry Knowles's birthday in December, held from 1999 to 2016 at Drafthouse locations. Following sexual assault allegations against Knowles in September 2017, League said the Alamo had severed all ties with Knowles. *Celebrity Guests - special event where a famed film industry person or star speaks *Cinema Cocktails - bar service with at-seat waitered service during movies at the Ritz location *The Dionysium - monthly arts variety show including debate panels, lectures, forums, and socializing *Filmmaking Frenzy - ongoing filmmaking competition with annual awards *Food & Film Events - special meal service for certain movies *Foleyvision - films which replace original audio with live commentary; formerly \\"Buzz Moran's Kung Fu Masterpiece Theater\\" *Kid's Club - free children's movie screenings last Saturday each month *Master Pancake Theater - live movie mockery; a panel of comedians mock a movie as it is shown with live comedy voice-overs, real-time commentary, and some pre-selected movie editing; a successor to the former special event \\"Christmas Show\\"; content frequently Rated R.

The magazine and website provide news and commentary about films and the entertainment industry. The sale of Birth.Movies.Death to Dallas Sonier's Cinestate film studio was announced in May 2020 concurrently with the stepping down of founder Tim League as CEO of Alamo Drafthouse. Hostile workplace allegations In October 2016, Devin Faraci resigned from Birth.Movies.Death. after allegations of sexual assault surfaced. Less than a year later, Tim League re-hired Faraci to write film blurbs for the 2017 Fantastic Fest. Upon discovery of Faraci's re-hiring, Todd Brown resigned as Fantastic Fest's director of international programming in early September 2017. Faraci resigned from writing for Fantastic Fest, and League made several public apologies regarding the matter. Later in September 2017, several women accused Harry Knowles of sexual harassment and sexual assault at events sponsored by Alamo Drafthouse or in professional workplace settings. Subsequent to these revelations, Alamo Drafthouse and Fantastic Fest severed business ties with Knowles. League did not attend Fantastic Fest, opting instead to visit Alamo Drafthouse locations around the country to discuss workplace environment issues with employees. Despite these events, Alamo Drafthouse proceeded with plans to show a previously-unreleased pornographic film by Ed Wood.

She is perhaps best known for presenting the BBC's travel programme Holiday throughout the 1980s. She was one of the first people from Northern Ireland to become a national British television personality.TV star Anne Gregg dies of cancer, BBC News, 6 September 2006. Early life Gregg was born in Belfast. Her father, Kenneth, was a civil servant who worked for the Ordnance Survey; her mother, Nan, was a dressmaker. An uncle, R. H. McCandless, was an actor.Obituary, The Times, 9 September 2006 She had one brother, Ken. Gregg was educated at Strathearn Grammar School for Girls in Belfast. After leaving school, she worked for a short time as a bookkeeper in the Ministry of Finance, but quickly left to pursue a television career. Career Gregg joined Ulster Television at the age of 19 in 1959, starting as an announcer and later becoming a local news reporter and presenter of Roundabout. She was reputed to be the youngest current affairs presenter in the United Kingdom. Obituary, The Daily Telegraph, 9 September 2006. She moved to England in 1963, where worked at an advertising agency before moving to Anglia Television, in Norwich, to present a current affairs programme. She moved to London to work for the BBC, first as a continuity announcer, and later becoming a news reader on national television. She changed to print journalism in 1966,Obituary, The Independent, 9 September 2006. working as a features editor and later deputy editor on the Good Housekeeping magazine. She was editor of Woman's Journal from 1978 to 1980. Gregg returned to television broadcasting in 1980, as a presenter on the Holiday programme from 1980 to 1991. She was its main studio presenter from 1990 to 1991, attracting a weekly audience of 12 million. With a warm, personable manner, described by The Guardian as \\"unstuffy directness and warmth combined with an impish sense of fun\\",Obituary, The Guardian, 14 September 2006 she was popular with viewers. She was counted as \\"thinking man's crumpet\\", alongside Joan Bakewell, Joanna Lumley and Felicity Kendal. However, in 1991, she was replaced as the main presenter of Holiday with Anneka Rice (Rice was herself replaced one year later by Jill Dando). Rather than face demotion, Gregg resigned. The Daily Mail reported that she had been sacked, and perceptions that she had been rejected for being too old at 51 (Rice was 17¬Ω years younger) led to hundreds of viewers writing in to protest, pushing the issue of her departure to seventh on the BBC's list of viewer complaints, famously between complaints about bad language (sixth) and about a series of programmes on homosexuality on BBC2 (eighth). She, however, rejected allegations of ageism, pointing to successful older women at the BBC, such as Esther Rantzen and Sue Lawley. In retrospect, Gregg was glad to have been given a chance to explore other interests. She continued as a television presenter. She co-presented coverage of the Chelsea Flower Show for BBC Two from 1991 to 1994; presented a ten-part series on BBC Northern Ireland, Places Apart in 1996-1997; and appeared as a guest on Call My Bluff and Countdown. She presented two programmes that mixed travel with religion, Annie Across America on religion in the United States, in 1992 and Package Pilgrims in 1993; and also Folio, an arts programme produced by Anglia. Gregg also continued with the freelance interests that she had pursued while presenting Holiday. She produced videos for English Heritage; she wrote in newspapers and magazines; and she appeared on radio programmes. In 1997, she presented one series of Breakaway on BBC Radio 4. For many years, she produced magazines for the French Tourist Office in London with business partner Ken Wright. In 2003, she was awarded the M√©daille d'Or du Tourisme. She wrote several books, including The Perfect Holiday (1989), Dalton's Directory of British Holidays (1993), a series of Heritage Guides to Great Britain (1995), and Tarragon and Truffles (2006). Personal life Gregg lived in London, but also kept a house in Provence. She never married. She died in 2006 of cancer, aged 66.

It is incorporated as a city of oblast significance. Population: . History The populated place was founded in 1764 as a village Golubovka by the Russian colonel and a native of Serbia Peter Golub. Its history follows closely the history of industrial development in the Eastern Ukraine. The town grew when coal mines were set up in the area and the village was known as a settlement Golubovskiy Rudnik; reaching its peak size in the 1980s. When the area was recaptured from Nazi Germany in 1944, the settlement was renamed as Kirovsk after the Russian mayor of Leningrad. In 1962 the settlement was granted the city rights. The landscape around the town still has pyramid-shaped manmade hills, they are the by-products of the coal mine development and make the area look somewhat surreal. The best time to visit Kirovsk is August; a few national and local holiday celebrations take place during this month, such as the Independence Day and the Coal Miner Day. During the holidays the nightlife is booming; there are live concerts performed by regional, sometimes national, artists on the town stadium with many festivities in the town park. The town's population would grows noticeably during the holidays when many friends and families come to visit. Common outdoor activities include hunting in the prairies surrounding Kirovsk and fishing on the nearby lakes. Local terrain is very hilly and has many roads and paths that makes it perfect for mountain biking. The area has a few historic sites that include churches, a museum and a World War II memorial. The town swimming pool is popular among locals and has a gym. Local nightlife destinations include the small cafes and the discoth√®que in the town park that are open only during the summer. Since 2014, Kirovsk has been located on the territory of the Luhansk People's Republic and is not controlled by Ukrainian authorities. The city was renamed to Holubivka by Ukrainian authorities, however, the Luhansk People's Republic does not recognize this name.

Wilson made his debut at Northampton in August 1951, though he did not enjoy a particularly successful game, taking only one wicket (that of Frederick Jakeman) in the first innings for the cost of 56 runs and finishing with 0‚Äì20 off six overs in the second. With the bat he made 0 and 0 not out, an early pointer as to his ability ‚Äî or lack thereof ‚Äî in that department. He was not picked again that season. 1952 saw Wilson's only real run in the Worcestershire side, as he played 11 County Championship games and picking up 16 wickets, albeit at an unimpressive average of 53.18. His best performance, and indeed the best of his career, came in his first appearance of the year, against Middlesex, when he took five wickets: 2‚Äì84 in the first innings and 3‚Äì42 in the second. Unfortunately for him, he could only manage 11 more in the nine further matches he played that summer. He was to play only once more at first-class level, when he was part of the team that faced Somerset in June 1953. Worcestershire won the game by three wickets thanks largely to the efforts of Reg Perks (10‚Äì135 in the match) and George Dews (100 in the first innings), but Wilson himself was a bit-part player: he bowled 17 overs, but took only the single wicket of David Evans. Wilson's batting was abysmal: in 16 first-class innings he made a grand total of ten runs: he scored 4 once, 2 twice, 1 twice and 0 eleven times. His career batting average failed to dip below one only because seven of his innings were not out. In 1952 he produced a sequence of six visits to the crease without scoring: 0*, 0, 0, 0*, 0* and 0.

More recently other color icings have been used as well, however the vast majority still use the pink icing. It is credited to have originated at Bennett's Bakery and remains particular to the former city of Port Arthur, Ontario, Canada. The city is now known as Thunder Bay after its amalgamation with Fort William in 1970. It is sometimes confused with a Pershing or a Persian bun which are regional items in parts of the United States but are a completely different baked good made with doughnut batter as opposed to being a sweet roll. Hot Fried with butter is an alternate, sweeter way to enjoy the Persian. This is prepared by splitting the Persian (similar to how one would cut a bagel). Butter is generously applied and set in a frying pan. The icing is shared to cover the top of both pieces being fried and is allowed to melt and crystallize while the buttered side is fried to golden brown. It is served hot. History Traditional lore is that the Persian was named for U.S. general John \\"Blackjack\\" Pershing but the exact date of its inception and circumstances of its creation are no longer known, giving rise to competing claims and myths among people in the region.

According to these accounts, Umm Haram, being of very old age, had fallen from her mule and had died during a siege of Larnaca. She was later buried where she died. According to Shia belief, her grave lies within Jannatul Baqi cemetery in Madinah, Saudi Arabia. During the Ottoman administration of Cyprus, a mosque complex was built in stages around the tomb. The tomb was discovered in the 18th century by the dervish called Sheikh Hasan, who also built the first structure here. Dervish Hasan managed to convince the administrative and religious authorities of the site's sacred nature and with the permission he received, he built the shrine around the tomb in 1760 and had it decorated. The wooden fences around the tomb would have been built by the 19th-century Ottoman governor in Cyprus, Seyyid Elhac Mehmed Agha, which were replaced by fences in bronze and two doors by his successor Acem Ali Agha. In another account, Giovanni Mariti, who visited Cyprus between 1760‚Äì1767, wrote that the shrine was built by the Cyprus governor he names as Ali Agha. According to Mariti, until 1760 they used the stones of a standing church in a ruined village nearby as construction materials.Mariti, Giovanni (1792): Travels Through Cyprus, Syria, and Palestine; with a General History of the Levant. Translated from the Italian Printed for P. Byrne, Item notes: v. 1 In another source, it is mentioned that the construction of the mosque was initiated by the Cyprus governor Seyyid Mehmed Emin Efendi in classical Ottoman style, and it was completed in November 1817. The ancillary buildings have been repaired in 2004, and the mosque and the minaret are currently being restored. Both of these initiatives have been carried out with support from the Bi-communal Development Programme, which is funded from USAID and UNDP, and implemented through UNOPS.http://www.cyprustemples.com/templedetails.asp?id=71&pageno;=1 Layout thumb Above the entry gate to Tekke garden is an Ottoman inscription dated 4 March 1813. Sultan Mahmud II's monogram appears on both sides of the inscription and reads, \\"Hala Sultan Tekke was built by God's beloved great Ottoman Cyprus governor\\". The garden itself was designed by a pasha and came to be known as \\"Pasha garden\\". The complex of buildings adjacent to the Tekke was known as \\"G√ºl≈üen-Feyz\\" (the rose garden of plenitude or of enlightenment). To the north (left) of the entrance there used to be a guesthouse for men. On the right side of the entrance, there was another guesthouse of which one block was reserved for men (Selamlik) and the other for women (Haremlik). It was a custom for visitors to take the oath of dedication to serve the Hala Sultan Tekke if their wishes were realized. The domed mosque is square-shaped with a balcony and was built in yellow stone blocks. The minaret was repaired in 1959. Umm Haram's tomb is located behind the mosque wall of the qibla (in the direction of Mecca). A further inscription dated 1760 is found here. Aside her, there are four other tombs, two of them former sheikhs. Another important tomb is a two-leveled marble sarcophagus, carrying the date 12 July 1929. The tomb belongs to Adile H√ºseyin Ali, who was the Turkish wife of the Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca of the Hashemite House, himself a grandson of the Ottoman grand vizier Koca Mustafa Re≈üid Pasha and a descendant of Muhammad. At the eastern corner of the mosque and the Tekke, there is a cemetery, which was closed to burials at around 1899. A number of past Turkish administrators are buried here. Opposite the mosque, there is an octagonal fountain, which was built around 1796-1797 by the then governor of Cyprus Silahtar Kaptanba≈üƒ± Mustafa Agha. The information on the construction is recorded on the marble inscription located on the fountain. On another inscription dated 1895, which was recently discovered in the Tekke's garden, it is written that the infrastructure for bringing in the water was built upon the instructions of the Sultan Abd√ºlhamid II.

Some definitions use the term to refer to persons who immigrate to Canada, meet the residency requirement to become a naturalized citizen, and then return to live in their original home country while maintaining their Canadian citizenship. The term implies that these citizens only acquire or maintain their citizenship as a form of \\"insurance\\" so that they may call on the Canadian government for protection in the event of an emergency. The term was popularized in 2006 by Canadian politician Garth Turner in response to the evacuation of Canadian citizens from Lebanon during the 2006 Lebanon War. Statistics and analyses are unavailable on the distinction between evacuees who were long-term residents of Lebanon and those who were not and on how many of the long-term residents had returned to Lebanon immediately after acquiring their Canadian citizenship. Coining of the term Although the term was used by others (such as Peter Worthington of the Toronto Sun) earlier during the conflict in Lebanon, it was made most prominent by posts by Garth Turner, a then Conservative MP for Halton, on his official blog. Turner questioned the fairness of paying 75,000 for each evacuee (the actual cost was approximately $6,300 for each evacuee; $94 million for 15,000 people), saying, among other things, \\"that's a hell of a lot of money to donate to people who do not live here, don't pay taxes here, and may never come here again in their lives.\\" The National Post asserted later in 2006 that, of the 15,000 evacuated, about 7,000 may have returned to Lebanon within a month of being evacuated. Support of the term Turner was criticized by some for suggesting that there are two classes of Canadian citizens. Other editorials supported the use of the phrase \\"Canadians of convenience\\" and said many immigrants meet their minimum residence requirement to gain Canadian citizenship (which, since 1977, can essentially never be revoked), leave the country, and only call upon their Canadian citizenship again when in need of the publicly funded Medicare or emergency evacuation from a war zone. The Economist stated, \\"Of the 5.5 million Canadians born abroad, 560,000 declared in the most recent census that they hold passports from another country.\\" Government policy The official policy of the Government of Canada is that a dual citizen is the responsibility of the foreign government when living in the foreign country; however, in practice, Canada generally does not distinguish between Canadians with multiple citizenships and those who don't, as was the case during the 2006 evacuation from Lebanon. Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in 2006 that he planned to review the matter. Canada permits multiple citizenship. For citizens of countries like India, China, or Singapore, which do not allow multiple citizenship, those who become Canadian citizens often lose their original citizenship if the original country learns of the Canadian citizenship, and the Canadian citizens generally are required to renounce their Canadian citizenship in order to be naturalised in that country. Amendments to Citizenship Act Public displeasure over Canadian citizens evacuated from Lebanon during the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict spurred Bill C-37, to amend the Citizenship Act. A new law came into effect on April 17, 2009. One of the changes instituted by the Government of Canada, is the \\"first generation limitation.\\" Then-Minister for Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism Jason Kenney said the following in the House of Commons of Canada on June 10, 2010: \\"That's why we must protect the values of Canadian citizenship and must take steps against those who would cheapen it ... We will strengthen the new limitation on the ability to acquire citizenship for the second generation born abroad.\\" The new law would only confer Canadian citizenship to those who were born to a Canadian parent who, him/herself, was either born in Canada or became a Canadian citizen by immigrating to Canada as a permanent resident and subsequently being granted citizenship (also called naturalization). Under the old rules, it was possible for Canadian citizens to pass on their citizenship to endless generations born outside Canada. To restrict the scope of those eligible for Canadian citizenship for the future, the new law limits‚Äîwith a few exceptions‚Äîcitizenship by descent to one generation born outside Canada. =Criticism of new citizenship rules= New rules have had the consequence of denying citizenship to children of Canadian expats, if the parents were also born outside Canada. 2010s revocation of Canadian citizenship On July 19, 2011, the Canadian Government announced through Immigration Minister Jason Kenney its intention to revoke the citizenship of 1,800 people it believed obtained their status through fraudulent means. Targets of the move were predicted to hail predominantly from the Middle East, Persian Gulf and China. On September 9, 2012, the government raised this number to 3,100 and began sending letters detailing the revocation and appeal process. The following year's Immigration Minister Chris Alexander announced that 27 of the investigations had led to revoked citizenships. This represents the largest ever revocation of Canadian citizenships. In comparison, fewer than 70 citizenships were revoked between the passing of the Citizenship Act in 1947 and 2011.

The route is signed as north‚Äìsouth; however, in actuality the highway follows more of an east‚Äìwest routing across southeastern Schuyler County and northeastern Chemung County. The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 14 in the village of Montour Falls southeast of Seneca Lake and its eastern terminus is at a junction with NY 34 in the village of Van Etten. Route description NY 224 west at the Schuyler-Chemung county line in Van Etten NY 224 begins at an intersection with NY 14 (North Catharine Street) in the village of Montour Falls. NY 224 proceeds eastward along Clawson Boulevard, a two-lane commercial street through Montour Falls. After crossing a creek, the route makes a bend eastward, crossing an intersection with County Route 8 (CR 8; Skyline Valley Drive), where it turns southeast. A short distance into the bend, NY 224 leaves the village of Montour Falls for the town of Montour and drops the moniker of Clawson Boulevard. NY 224 becomes a two-lane rural roadway, crossing a valley via a long bridge before bending eastward once again near Havana Glen Road. After Havana Glen, NY 224 becomes a residential through street in Montour, intersecting with Speedway Road, where it enters the village of Odessa. In Odessa, NY 224 bends northeast near Speedway Road, gaining the West Main Street moniker. NY 224 runs along the northern end of the village, passing north of the combined buildings of H.A. Hanlon Elementary School and Odessa-Montour Junior/Senior High school, both part of the Odessa- Montour Central School, and intersecting with the village continuation of CR 15 (Church Street) at the center of town. After Church Street, NY 224 continues east through Odessa, crossing under a former railroad right-of-way and intersects with the southern terminus of NY 228 (Mecklenburg Road). After NY 228, NY 224 bends southeast and out of the village, entering the town of Catharine. Through Catherine, NY 224 parallels the railroad right-of-way as a two-lane farm road, intersecting with the southern terminus of CR 10\\\\. NY 224 continues winding southeast, intersecting with CR 11 twice, once via a spur road and once directly in the hamlet of Alpine. Through Alpine, NY 224 is a two-lane residential street, paralleling homes in both directions before leaving at the second intersection with CR 11\\\\. After departing Alpine, NY 224 bends even further to the south, crossing the railroad right-of-way once again, entering the hamlet of Alpine Junction. In Alpine Junction, NY 224 intersects with NY 13 at-grade. After Alpine Junction, NY 224 and the railroad grade continue southeast, entering the town of Cayuta. Entering the hamlet of Cayuta a short distance after, NY 224 becomes a two-lane industrial highway, intersecting with the southern terminus of CR 12 (Cayuta Road), which connects to the Tompkins County line and becomes CR 135\\\\. After the hamlet of Cayuta, NY 224 bends southward once again, remaining a two-lane forest highway. NY 224 west, signed as cardinal north, through the town of Van Etten After a bend near the railroad grade, NY 224 proceeds eastward through Cayuta, passing spurious homes as it winds through the town. NY 224 intersects with CR 13's southern terminus just before crossing the county line into Chemung County. After crossing the county line into Chemung County, NY 224 now enters of the town of Van Etten. The route continues southeast, intersecting with CR 48 (McDuffy Hollow Road)'s southern terminus. Paralleling the railroad grade further, NY 224 soon intersects with the northern terminus of CR 14 (Swartwood Drive), which connects NY 224 to the hamlet of Swartwood. NY 224 continues southeast through Van Etten, where it intersects with the eastern terminus of NY 223\\\\. Paralleling the old railroad grade, NY 224 proceeds southeast as a two-lane farm road until an intersection with the terminus of CR 3 (Wyncoop Creek Road). After this intersection, NY 224 enters the village of Van Etten, where it becomes a two-lane residential street. After intersecting with CR 62, NY 224 makes a bend to the east, where it crosses CR 13 (Langford Street) before intersecting with NY 34 (Gee Street). The intersection with NY 34 serves as the eastern terminus of NY 224, as the right-of-way continues east to the Tioga County line as NY 34. History NY 224 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. Initially, the route began at NY 14 in Montour Falls and ended at NY 223 near the hamlet of Swartwood. From there, NY 223 continued east through the village of Van Etten to the village of Candor over what was previously designated as part of NY 53 from the mid-1920s to 1930. NY 223 was truncated in the early 1950s to end at NY 224 in Swartwood. The former routing of NY 223 from Swartwood to Van Etten became an extension of NY 224.

The conflict started after the death of king Alfonso XI of Castile in March 1350. It became part of the larger conflict then raging between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of France: the Hundred Years' War. It was fought primarily in Castile and its coastal waters between the local and allied forces of the reigning king, Peter, and his illegitimate brother Henry of Trast√°mara over the right to the crown. Causes Peter was called by his supporters \\"The Just\\" and by his detractors \\"The Cruel\\". To the higher ranks of the nobility, he was a tyrant, forcing the royal will on hitherto free men. He had greatly extended the royal authority and had entered into a war with the Crown of Aragon (called \\"The War of the Two Peters\\"). His illegitimate brother Henry quickly obtained the support of not only the upper noblesse, but France, Aragon, and the Papacy. In 1366, he officially deposed his brother as king of Castile, Le√≥n, Toledo, and Seville and had himself proclaimed king in the monastery of Las Huelgas. Conflict In 1366, Henry, then living in France, assembled a large army, with both French and Aragonese components and English mercenaries, at Montpellier and invaded Castile with the support of the kings of France and Aragon (Charles V and Peter IV respectively). He successfully forced Peter to flee. Peter fled to Bayonne, a city in English-held Gascony. There, he petitioned Edward, the Black Prince, for aid and, in exchange for lands in Castile, received it. With English troops led by the prince, he returned to Castile and reasserted his royal power in 1367, forcing Henry to return to France after the successful Battle of N√°jera (Navarette). He refused, however, to make good on his dealings with the English and his allies, including the Prince of Wales himself, soon left. In 1368, Henry and Charles of France signed the Treaty of Toledo whereby the Castilians lent a fleet in the Bay of Biscay to the French in return for military aid on land. Henry entered Galicia, took some towns and then took the city of Le√≥n in April. After this, the whole province of Galicia took sides with Henry. He reentered Castile in 1369 and murdered Peter after the Battle of Campo de Montiel. He was acclaimed Henry II and immediately solidified his rule by removing Jews from high office. Castile became, at this time, a stern ally of the French in their ongoing wars. Sources *Wintle, Justin. The Rough Guide History of Spain. Penguin Group, 2003.

Thai labour leader Tanong Po-arn was President of the Labour Congress of Thailand. He played an important role in negotiating with the government of Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan to secure the creation of a comprehensive national social security system.Amnesty International, Thailand: The \\"disappearance\\" of labour leader Tanong Pho-arn, 19 June 1991 , AI Index: ASA 39/007/2001, released 18 June 2001 He was also a Thai senator and the vice- president of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions - Asia Pacific Regional Organization (ICFTU-APRO). The 1991 coup On 23 February 1991, the military National Peace Keeping Council (NPKC) overthrew the government, declared martial law, and abrogated the constitution. Soon after the coup, the NPKC abolished labour unions in state enterprises, leaving over 270,000 union members without trade union rights. Tanong was publicly critical of the NPKC. Disappearance Tanong was scheduled to appear at the International Labour Organization (ILO) annual meeting in Switzerland in June 1991 to speak about the restrictions placed on Thai trade union activity.Brown, Andrew (2004). Labour, Politics, and the State in Industrializing Thailand. London, United Kingdom: Routledge. pp. 102‚Äì104, . The NPKC denied Tanong permission to attend the conference. Tanong reported that he was followed everywhere and received numerous anonymous death threats. He told his family: \\"If for three days I don't contact you, that means I have been arrested; if it's more than seven days, that means I have already died\\". On 19 June 1991 Tanong's empty car was found near his office in Rat Burana District, Bangkok. After his disappearance his family feared for his health, as Tanong, age 55, was an insulin-dependent diabetic who did not have his medication with him when he was last seen. His wife said; \\"I sent letters to every government organization to ask for information on his disappearance, but received only silence from them.\\" Investigations and protests Two committees were established to investigate Tanong Pho-arn's whereabouts, one in the Ministry of the Interior in 1992 and the other in parliament. Reports of these investigations have never been made public. Amnesty International, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and other trade unions have called on the Thai government to make these reports public and to initiate proper investigations. In January 2003, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra allowed the Tanong Po-arn case to be included with the cases of the missing protesters of Black May, the bloody 1992 uprising that led to the downfall of the NPKC.International Confederation of Free Trade Unions - Asia Pacific Regional Organization ICFTU-APRO Labor Flash Issue No. 1084, 31 January 2003 It was hoped that Thaksin's decision would open up the possibility that more information could be found regarding Tanong's fate.

The novel sold 100,000 copies in the six months after its publication, and it became one of the most successful books of the first half of the 20th century. By 1939 its circulation had reached millions. The main theme of the novel is social progress, particularly with respect to modern technology.  Plot  Allan, an idealistic engineer, wants to build a tunnel at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean connecting North America with Europe within the space of a few years. The idealist's scheme is thwarted for financial reasons, and the tunnel construction (in particular a segment dug under a mountain) experiences several disasters. A fiasco seems inevitable, the army of workers revolt, and Allan becomes a figure of universal hatred throughout the world. After 26 years of construction, the tunnel is finally completed; however, the engineering masterpiece is outdated as soon as it opens, as aeroplanes now cross the Atlantic in a few hours.  Reception  The reception of the book and its sentiments was extremely positive, and was on its publication a success for Kellerman. The story anticipated important social events as the Great Depression, and had the charm of a parallel world history of a 1920s and 1930s in which the First World War never occurred. It also made the critical observation that technology always becomes outdated with its application.  Controversy  A controversial aspect of the book was its thinly-veiled racist overtones in the character of S. Woolf, Allan's nemesis. Woolf is a financial magnate who emigrated from Eastern Europe, and was portrayed as immoral and perverted. These were common Jewish stereotypes at the time Kellerman wrote.  Film adaptations  A scene from Der Tunnel (1933) Four films have been based on the book. First in 1915 as a silent film, directed by William Wauer. Three films were released in 1933 and 1935, one version each in German (Der Tunnel), French (Le Tunnel and English (The Tunnel, renamed Transatlantic Tunnel in the US). The French and German versions were directed by Curtis Bernhardt and the English by Maurice Elvey. At the time it was not unusual to release a film in separate versions in different languages, each using different actors or directors, but utilising the same sets and locations.

The species is endemic to Mauritius and some of its offshore islands. Etymology Both the specific name, bojerii, and the common name, Bojer's skink, are in honor of Czech naturalist Wenceslas Bojer.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Gongylomorphus bojerii, p. 31). Description G. bojerii is about in total length, including a tail. It has five digits on each extremity. Geographic range Bojer's skink occurs in patches of the Black River Gorges National Park and on some off-shore islands of Mauritius including Ilot Vacoas, Round Island, Serpent Island, Ilot Gabriel, Pigeon Rock, Flat Island, Gunner's Quoin, Ile aux Aigrettes, and Ile de la Passe. Threats The Asian house shrew (Suncus murinus) has aided in the decline of G. bojerii. Thanks to the efforts of the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation, this invasive species of mammal was eradicated from the habitat of Bojer's skink. Also, captive breeding and reintroduction efforts at the Gerald Durrell Endemic Wildlife Sanctuary have helped to increase the population of G. bojerii.

The Samogitian army of 3,000 invaded Courland and on their way back defeated the Livonian Order, killing 33 knights and many more low-rank soldiers. In terms of knights killed, it was the eighth largest defeat of the Livonian Order in the 13th century. This victory led to a Semigallian insurrection against the Livonian crusaders, which lasted from 1259 to 1272. Background In 1251, Mindaugas, pagan Grand Duke of Lithuania, concluded a peace treaty with the Livonian Order: he was to be baptized and crowned as King of Lithuania in return for portions of Samogitia, Nadruva, and Dainava. Mindaugas was crowned on 6 July 1253 and the promised lands were transferred to the Order. The Order built the Memel Castle (Klaipƒóda) on the border with Samogitia to serve as the basis for further expansion. After Samogitians unsuccessfully attacked the new castle, their nobles formed a military coalition, elected Algminas (or Almenas) as their leader, and organized offensive raids to Courland. After the Samogitians defeated the knights near Klaipƒóda and killed 12 knights in 1257, a Samogitian envoy in Riga requested a two-year truce. The truce was supported by Riga merchants, who sought to increase wax and fur trade with the Samogitians. Battle When the truce expired, Samogitians did not seek an extension, but once again organized a raid to Courland.Urban, William. The Baltic Crusade, pp. 245‚Äì246. This raid might have been prompted by Mindaugas, who granted Samogitia in its entirety to the Order on 7 August 1259 while seeking allies against the Golden Horde that plundered Lithuanian lands in the winter of 1259. However, the exact date or year of the battle is unknown. Historian Edvardas Gudaviƒçius dated the battle late summer or early fall 1258. While the Samogitians were plundering Courland, the knights from Kuldƒ´ga requested reinforcements from Klaipƒóda.Gudaviƒçius, Edvardas. Mindaugas, p. 268 The Knights pursued retreating Samogitians, who carried their loot back home and the decisive battle took place near Skuodas. The Livonian Rhymed Chronicle blamed the defeat on the cowardly Curonians, who did not withstand the Samogitian pressure and retreated from the battlefield leaving the knights exposed. Inspired by the success, the Samogitians almost immediately organized another raid into Courland. This time Livonian Grand Master Burchard von Hornhausen commanded the Knights. However, the Knights were careful to avoid an ambush while the Samogitians decided not to engage in a pitched battle.Gudaviƒçius, Edvardas. Mindaugas, pp. 270‚Äì273 Aftermath The battle inspired the Semigallians to rebel against the Order. The Knights, finding little success in an open battlefield turned to strategic warfare. They attacked Tƒìrvete (Terwerten) hoping to turn the Semigallian outpost into a Teutonic castle.Gudaviƒçius, Edvardas. Mindaugas, p. 274 When the attack failed, they built a fortress in nearby Dobele (Doblen) and Goergenburg (possibly present-day Jurbarkas) in Samogitia.Gudaviƒçius, Edvardas. Mindaugas, pp. 275‚Äì276 Both castles were soon attacked by the Semigallians and Samogitians. The following year, the Samogitians raided Courland again and provoked the Knights into the Battle of Durbe, where the Order suffered even greater defeat. After these disasters, it took some thirty years for the Livonian Order to restore its status and territory.Urban, William. The Baltic Crusade, p. 248.

History The village Hinwil from which the later municipality took its name is first mentioned in 745 as Hunichinwilari, in a donation made by Beata and Landolt to the Abbey of Saint Gall. Hinwil was part of an Alamannic colony comprising also adjoining villages and settlements that were donated during the following century by descendants of Beata and Landolt or by other members of their clan to the same abbey, such as Hadaleihinchova (Hadlikon, donated in 775), Pozinhova (Bossikon, 829), Rimolteswilare (Ringwil, donated together with a church in 837) and Werinholveshusa (Wernetshausen, 867). The Alamanni were actually preceded by Roman inhabitants, as attested by the foundation walls of a Roman Villa dating from the 1st century CE and detected under the medieval church of Hinwil which is first mentioned in the second half of the 8th century. During the High Middle Ages, the village Hinwil was part of the Landvogtei of Gr√ºningen and was then, after 1280, subordinated to the commandry of the Knights of St. John at Bubikon. In the process of the Reformation, the governance of Hinwil and other villages of the region was divided between Z√ºrich and the Order of the Knights of St. John, with the influence of the latter being limited by an agreement to use only members of the Reformed Church of Z√ºrich as their local governors. The economy of Hinwil was originally based on agriculture and rural handcraft. During the second half of the 16th century regional production of linen was introduced, from the 17th century on livestock farming and especially the early modern workshop- system of cloth production came to be dominant and, together with tourism in the wake of the railroad connection established in 1876, provided a certain prosperity in the 19th century and the years before World War I. Industrial production used to play a comparably modest role, yet came to be more important with the local establishment of B√ºhrer Traktorenwerke AG (tractor production, since 1939) and Ferag AG (materials handling namely for newspaper production, since 1957).

Early life The son of Italian immigrants, Anthony and Theresa () Petrone, emigrated from Sasso di Castalda, Petrone was raised Roman Catholic and attended the United States Military Academy at West Point. There he played defensive tackle in the 1945 national football championship winning team. Graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1946, he served in West Germany from 1947 to 1950. He also earned a master's degree in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1951, and later received an honorary doctorate from Rollins College. During two decades with the U.S. Army, Petrone took part in developing the Redstone rocket, the first U.S. ballistic missile and the vehicle used to launch America's first astronauts, Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom on their suborbital missions. He retired from the U.S. Army in 1966 with the rank of lieutenant colonel. NASA career Petrone at the Apollo 11 rollout at LC-39 on May 20, 1969 In 1960, Petrone was seconded to NASA. There, Petrone presided over the development of Saturn V launch operations, dubbing the period of preparation leading up to each launch \\"five-month marathons\\". He oversaw construction of all the launch elements of the Apollo program at Kennedy Space Center, including Launch Complex 39, the Vertical Assembly Building, and the Crawler-Transporter, all of which were later modified for Space Shuttle operations. After his retirement from the U.S. Army in 1966 he continued to work for NASA as a civilian, being promoted to director of launch operations at KSC in July 1966. In September 1969, shortly after the Apollo 11 mission, he was appointed director of the entire Apollo program at NASA Headquarters. In 1972, Petrone was assigned additional responsibilities as program director of the NASA portion of the U.S. and the Soviet Union joint Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. Petrone (l) and Wernher von Braun talk during preparations for the A-104 (SA-8) Saturn 1 launch at LC-37 From 1973 to 1974, Petrone served for one year as the first non-German administrator of the Marshall Space Flight Center, after Wernher von Braun and Eberhard Rees. At the time NASA was undergoing budget cutbacks, and his tenure was marked with many reassignments or firings.Georg von Tiesenhausen MSFC History Project Georg Von Tiesenhausen Conducted by A.

After NASA In 1975, Petrone retired from NASA and became the president and chief executive officer of the National Center for Resource Recovery, a joint industry/labor effort to develop and encourage ways to recover materials and energy from solid waste. In the 1980s, Petrone held senior posts at Rockwell International, manufacturer of the Space Shuttle Orbiter. He eventually rose to become head of Rockwell's space transportation division. On the morning that the Space Shuttle Challenger was due to launch on STS-51-L, Petrone and several of his colleagues were alarmed at the massive amount of ice that had built up overnight on the Orbiter due to unseasonably cold temperatures. Petrone feared that the ice could seriously damage the shuttle's thermal protection system when it struck the tiles during launch. He told his managers at Cape Canaveral that Rockwell could not support launching because it viewed the amount of ice on the Orbiter as a launch constraint. This was not the cause, however, of the launch failure that killed seven astronauts. Petrone died on August 24, 2006 from complications related to diabetes in Palos Verdes Estates, California, aged 80. Character Petrone was described as demanding by his NASA colleagues. Humboldt C.

They lie partly within Wrexham county borough and partly within Denbighshire. Road across Esclusham Mountain In the northern part of the moors are the areas known as Minera Mountain and Esclusham Mountain. Further south are Ruabon Mountain and Eglwyseg Mountain. In the west the moors reach their greatest height at Cyrn-y-Brain, above sea level. To the north and north- east, the moors are bounded by Minera Limeworks and the Clywedog valley. In the east they slope down to the villages of Rhosllannerchrugog and Ruabon. There are several small reservoirs in this area. At the southern edge of the moors the cliffs of Eglwyseg Rocks overlook the River Dee and the Vale of Llangollen. On the western side there are more cliffs at World's End while the Horseshoe Pass separates the moors from Llantysilio Mountain. Llandegla Forest, a large conifer plantation, covers the north-western side. Ruabon Moors are part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest and hold a wide variety of plant and animal life. Large parts of the moors are covered with heather. Where there are outcrops of limestone on the surface a number of scarce plants can be found such as prickly sedge, dark red helleborine and rigid buckler-fern. The moors are managed for red grouse shooting. Huge numbers were shot in the past (an average of 4658 per year from 1900 to 1913) but numbers have now decreased dramatically. The area is also home to black grouse and a major conservation programme has caused their population to increase in recent years. Other birds which can be seen include peregrine falcon, merlin, hen harrier, short-eared owl and ring ouzel. The area has been modified by human activity since prehistoric times when people built cairns and cleared the original forest. Mining has taken place in the area since Roman times and there are still many shafts of disused lead, zinc, silver and coal mines dotting the area. During the Second World War bombs were dropped on the moors by German planes heading to and from Liverpool and a number of bomb craters can still be seen today. The area is popular with walkers and rock- climbers and the Offa's Dyke Path crosses the region. It is rife with controversy after two satellite tagged hen harriers mysteriously disappeared here in 2018 and a raven was found poisoned in 2019. References *William M.

As of January 2009, she has released four regular studio albums, one holiday album, and thirty-four singles on Bad Boy Entertainment and Capitol Records. Newly contracted to Bad Boy Records in 1995, Evans was consulted by executive producer Sean Combs to contribute backing vocals and writing skills to Mary J. Blige's My Life (1994) and Usher's self-titled debut album (1994) prior to starting work on her debut record album Faith. Released on August 29, 1995 in North America, the album was a collaboration with Bad Boy's main producers The Hitmen, including Chucky Thompson and Combs, but it also resulted in recordings with Poke & Tone and Herb Middleton. Faith became a success based on the singles \\"You Used to Love Me\\" and \\"Soon as I Get Home\\". The album was certified platinum with 1.5 million copies sold, according to RIAA. After The Notorious B.I.G.'s murder during March 1997, Combs helped Evans produce her tribute song named \\"I'll Be Missing You\\", based on the melody of The Police's 1983 single \\"Every Breath You Take\\". The song, which featured Combs, Evans, and all-male group 112, became a worldwide number-one success and debuted on top of the Billboard Hot 100 during 1997, scoring that for eleven weeks. The next year, Evans was featured on \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", a collaboration with singers Whitney Houston and Kelly Price, that scored number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Two years in the making, Evans' second solo effort, Keep the Faith, was released during October 1998. Almost entirely written and produced by her, Evans considered the album difficult to complete as she had initially felt discouraged about the progress at first. Upon its release, however, the album garnered generally positive reviews by music critics, with Allmusic noting it \\"without a doubt a highlight of 1990s soul-pop music\\". Also enjoying commercial success, it eventually went platinum and produced the top ten singles \\"Love Like This\\" and \\"All Night Long\\" prompting Evans to start an 18-city theater tour with Dru Hill and Total the following year. Evans' third album on the Bad Boy imprint, named Faithfully (2001), involved her working with a wider range of producers, including The Neptunes, Mario Winans, Buckwild, Vada Nobles, Cory Rooney, and others. Her first project with husband Todd Russaw as executive producer and creative partner, the album scored number 14 on the Billboard 200 album chart and number two on the Top R&B;/Hip- Hop Albums chart, eventually being certified platinum, but yielded moderately successful singles, with the Jennifer Lopez-written \\"I Love You\\" becoming the only top twenty entry. Released amid Bad Boy Records' transition from distributor Arista Records to Universal, Evans felt Faithfully received minimum assistance by the company, and during 2004, she finally decided to end her business with Bad Boy as she was convinced Combs couldn't improve her career any more due to his other commitments. After ending with Bad Boy Evans contracted with Capitol Records company, becoming the first contemporary R&B; artist to do so, and started work on her fourth studio album The First Lady, named after her nickname on her former label. As opposed to having an in-house team of producers who supplied most of the previous material, she and Russaw were able to gain more creative control of the album and consulted producers such as Bryan-Michael Cox, Jermaine Dupri, Mike Caren, Pharrell Williams, and Chucky Thompson to contribute to it. Upon its release in April 2005, The First Lady scored at number two on the Billboard 200 and #1 of the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart, becoming Evans' best-charting album to date. It was eventually certified gold by the RIAA. At the end of the year, Evans released A Faithful Christmas, a holiday album of traditional Christmas songs and original tracks. The effort would become her last release on Capitol Records as the company was bought during 2007. Following a longer hiatus, Evans signed a deal with E1 Entertainment in 2010. Her fifth studio album Something About Faith was released on October 5, 2010 in the United States. In the US, the album debuted and peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard 200, number four on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number one on the Independent Albums chart, failing however to chart outside the US - making it Evans' only album since her debut Faith to chart in the US only. Something About Faith has spawned the single and music video \\"Gone Already\\"; which spent over thirty-three weeks on the US Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart, where it peaked at number twenty-two. A prominent feature, Evans has contributed guest vocals to more than sixty collaborations on other artists' albums. Her 1997 tribute single featuring Puff Daddy and 112, entitled \\"I'll Be Missing You,\\" became her biggest-selling hit to date and won her a Grammy Award in 1998.

The population was 518 at the 2000 census. The zip code for the area is 21160. The community name is taken from the Capital city of Wales. Geography Cardiff is located directly on the Mason-Dixon line, or Maryland - Pennsylvania border. It borders the incorporated town of Delta, Pennsylvania. It connects to the village of Whiteford, and is a short distance away from the areas of Street and Pylesville. Commerce All businesses are on Main Street, which runs from Whiteford to the Pennsylvania border, or Dooley Road, running from Main Street to Route 165. The town has a post office, several shops, garages, and churches, a fire hall, a general store, and a new supermarket. History The Mason's building in the Whiteford‚ÄìCardiff Historic District on Main Street Cardiff, Maryland Cardiff is located in a very slate-rich region, which created the town's early industries. Cardiff was formerly the mining center of Harford County. The mines and quarries have all but shut down now, and the town has become a farming hub. According to geologist Jeri Jones: > One cannot talk about the Delta area without including the Cardiff Marble > Company, just south of Delta in Cardiff, Maryland. The site was famous for > its own mineral resource, \\"Green Marble\\" or what geologists term a > serpentinite. The greenish rock is a metamorphic rock consisting wholly of > serpentine minerals commonly derived from the alteration of peridotite. In > turn, peridotite is a coarse-grained igneous rock formed very deep inside > the earth. The operation was originally a quarry being used for road > construction, but in 1913, a blast exposed a piece of the serpentinite. The > quarry sent the rock to Baltimore for polishing, after which it was > determined that a new resource has been discovered. After changing their > equipment to concentrate on the beautiful rock, rapid expansion of the > quarry started. At the completion of the operation in the early 1970's, the > shaft extended to a depth of over 300 feet with numerous tunnels at various > levels. Huge blocks of the serpentinite were lifted out by horst and cable, > similar to the slate operations, and removed to the saws in nearby > buildings. The rock was used for decorative stone, lamp bases, table tops, > fireplaces, and desk ornaments. The rock was used as decorative stone in the > Empire State Building in New York City, the Department of Highways Building > in Harrisburg, along with the bottom of the walls in City Hall in York, PA > and in numerous federal buildings in Washington, D.C. Formerly home of Slate Ridge Elementary School, shut down in the early 1980s, the building is now used for apartments. The town, a part of the Whiteford- Cardiff Historic District, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. The town and historic district are notable for their strong Welsh ethnic heritage, which is reflected in the name of the town as well as the local architecture, and the Welsh language choir of some renown based nearby.

In indoor volleyball Mooren started her career in 1989 at Allides Haarlem where she was part of the youth teams. The Dutch youth team called her up in 1996 and she was part of the team until 2000, winning a silver medal at the European Youth Championships. From 1997 until 2002 she played for Martinus Amstelveen in the highest Dutch league. Then she decided to switch sports to beach volleyball. She started her international beach volleyball career in 2002, teaming up with Mered de Vries. The talented team did not last long and in the following year Mooren had a new partner called Sanne Keizer. They quickly became one of the best teams in The Netherlands. They even became Dutch champions by breaking the run set by Rebekka Kadijk who was teaming up with Marrit Leenstra at that time. In 2004 they finished second behind this team, but they won the FIVB Satellite tournament in Lausanne. After the 2004 Summer Olympics Kadijk/Leenstra decided to split up. Mooren was Kadijk's next partner, while Leenstra continued with Sanne Keizer. The combination Kadijk/Mooren was nearly unbeatable in their own country. In 2005 and 2006 they became Dutch national champions. In both 2005 (Moscow) and 2006 (Scheveningen) they reached the final of the European Championships. In both occasions the final was lost and they won the silver medals twice. In 2007 they won their first European Tour Tournament, prevailing in the final of the German Masters in Hamburg.

He is the 2003 Grand Prix Final silver medalist, the 2004 European bronze medalist, the 1999 World Junior champion, and a three-time Russian national silver medalist.  Personal life  Klimkin was born on 15 August 1980 in Moscow, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union.  Career  Klimkin's grandmother introduced him to skating at the age of four because she felt it would be good for his health. He was coached by Igor Rusakov for thirteen years until Rusakov's sudden death in July 2003. He was then coached by Viktor Kudriavtsev. At the 1999 Nebelhorn Trophy, Klimkin became the first skater to land two different quadruple jumps in one program, which he did by landing a quad salchow and a quad toe loop in the free skate. Klimkin spins in both directions, and is also known for his cantilever. In the summer of 2003, Klimkin had a calf injury which became infected and required three surgeries; he returned to the ice in late September and won 2002 NHK Trophy two months later. In the fall of 2004, he underwent surgery on his Achilles tendon, keeping him off the ice for four months; after another three months, he was able to practice jumps. He did not compete in the 2004‚Äì05 season. He announced his retirement from competitive skating on 19 April 2007.  Programs  {class= style=text-align:center ! Season ! Short program ! Free skating !

The son of United States Secretary of State William H. Seward, he served as Assistant Secretary from 1861 to 1869 under both Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson and then from 1877 to 1879 in the administration of Rutherford B. Hayes. Early life Seward was born in Auburn, New York on July 8, 1830. He was the son of Frances Adeline (n√©e Miller) Seward and William H. Seward, who shortly after his birth became a New York State Senator (and later the 12th Governor of New York, a U.S. Senator and the 24th United States Secretary of State). Frederick was the younger brother of Augustus Henry Seward and the elder brother of General William H. Seward Jr. and Fanny Seward. His maternal grandfather was Judge Elijah Miller and his paternal grandfather was Judge Samuel S. Seward, who was also a physician and member of the New York State Assembly. From 1839 to 1840, while his father was Governor of New York State, Frederick attended the Pearl Street Academy in Albany, New York.Reminiscences of a Wartime Statesman and Diplomat. G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York, 1916, p. 31. He graduated from Union College in 1849, and studied law with Henry E. Davies and William Kent. In 1851, he was admitted to the bar in Rochester, New York. In 1878, Union awarded him an honorary LL.D. degree. Career After graduating from college, Seward served as a secretary to his father from 1849 to 1857, and served as associate editor of the Albany Evening Journal from 1851 to 1861. Baltimore Plot On February 21, 1861, Seward arrived at the Continental Hotel in Philadelphia carrying a letter from his father for President-elect Lincoln. The letter contained information gathered by Colonel Charles Pomeroy Stone and General Winfield Scott. Stone had stationed three detectives from the New York police department in Baltimore, Maryland to gather information about plots against Lincoln. Making his way by train from Illinois to Washington for his inauguration, Lincoln had intended to stop next at Baltimore, which was home to many secessionist sympathizers. According to information gathered by Stone's detectives, secessionists were planning to assassinate Lincoln during his stop in Baltimore. The warning Fred Seward brought would contribute to Lincoln's decision to pass through Baltimore under the cover of night, rather than stop and appear in public there. Although Allan Pinkerton also warned Lincoln of danger awaiting him in Baltimore, it was Seward's information that confirmed everyone's fears. Civil War When his father was appointed Secretary of State in 1861, Seward became Assistant Secretary of State in charge of consular service under Lincoln and Andrew Johnson. He served in the position until 1869 and \\"assisted in the negotiations to the adoption of the Burlingame Treaty,\\" which set the attitude towards China when the empire \\"accepted the principles of international law.\\" Attempt on father's life Frederick W. Seward during the Civil War On April 14, 1865, he was injured in an assassination attempt upon his father on the same night that Lincoln was murdered. Lewis Powell, also known as \\"Lewis Paine,\\" an ex-Confederate co- conspirator of John Wilkes Booth attempted to kill William Seward while the Secretary of State was convalescing at home from a carriage accident. That was Powell's part in the plot to put the government into chaos; Vice President Andrew Johnson and President Lincoln were also to be killed that same evening. After Frederick blocked Powell from gaining access to William Seward's bedroom, Powell tried to shoot Frederick in the head. However, when the gun failed to fire, Powell quickly smashed the pistol over Frederick's head, causing several skull injuries. Frederick then collapsed and fell to the floor at the top of the stairs. Powell then burst into William Seward's room and stabbed him several times in the face and neck. Powell also injured a number of other bystanders, including Frederick's sister Fanny, his brother Augustus, his father's nurse Private George F. Robinson and messenger Emerick Hansell, but no one was killed. Seward's mother was sure that he was going to die; instead, she died on June 21, 1865 of a heart attack. His sister, Fanny, died soon afterward, in October 1866. Powell was hanged on July 7, 1865, along with David Herold, George Atzerodt, and Mary Surratt, who were also involved in the conspiracy. Later life Frederick's father died on October 10, 1872. Seward was a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 7th D.) in 1875. At the New York state election, 1875, he ran on the Republican ticket for Secretary of State of New York, but was defeated by Democrat John Bigelow. He served again as Assistant Secretary of State under William M. Evarts from 1877 until his resignation in November 1879 due to illness. Seward was replaced by John Hay, the diplomat who was one of President Lincoln's former private secretaries. Seward also edited and published his father's autobiography and letters in a volume entitled Life and Letters of William H. Seward. Mostly, his life after 1881 was devoted to the practice of his legal profession and to lecturing and writing. Personal life On November 9, 1854 he married Anna Margaret Wharton (1836‚Äì1919) of Albany, New York and spent the latter part of his life in a house he built in Montrose-on-the-Hudson, near Peekskill, in New York. The estate had nearly a mile of Hudson River water- frontage. Seward died at his home in Montrose on April 25, 1915 at the age of 84. He was interred with his family in Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn, New York. Seward left an estate valued at $100,000. In 1916, a year after his death, his book Reminiscences of a War-Time Statesman and Diplomat, 1830-1915, a five- hundred page book about the Civil War and politics, was published by G.P. Putnam's Sons. Also in 1916, his widow sold their 50 acre Montrose estate.

Though the current members in CZW are Ruckus, BLK Jeez, Robbie Mireno (aka Robby Illuminati), the team also competes in companies with other members, such as Joker and Eddie Kingston. History CZW The Blackout started as a stable in CZW with Ruckus, Sabian, Joker, and Robbie Mireno. In 2004, they began a feud with Chri$ Ca$h, which saw a number of tag team matches. During this feud, Ruckus and Sabian won the CZW World Tag Team Championship from the H8 Club. In June 2004, Joker left CZW and wrestling entirely to fight in the war in Iraq. Eddie Kingston joined Blackout and continued the feud with Cash. The feud ended in a Cage of Death match at Cage of Death VI on December 11, 2004 when Blackout lost the tag titles to Team Ca$h of Chri$ Ca$h, J.C. Bailey, Nate Webb, and Sexxxy Eddie. In February 2005, Ruckus defeated Messiah for the CZW World Heavyweight Championship. Later in 2005, Blackout started feuding with The Kings of Wrestling and Super Dragon. One main feud was between Eddie Kingston and Chris Hero, during which Kingston went as far as saying he would attack Hero's girlfriend. Kingston and Hero met in a Last Man Standing match at Night of Infamy 4. Hero won the match with three consecutive low blows. Also that night, Ruckus defended his title against Claudio Castagnoli. This same night, Joker returned and attacked Zandig and the H8 Club. He had a short feud with them, and then rejoined Blackout. At Cage of Death 7, Kingston and Sabian challenged the Kings of Wrestling for the tag titles, but did not win. Later that night, Super Dragon defeated Ruckus for the World title. During the match, Dragon reinjured Robbie Mireno (who was previously injured by Dragon) with a curb stomp on the ramp. Blackout would get some revenge on the next show by defeating the Kings of Wrestling and Super Dragon in a six-man tag team match. They would get further revenge on February 11, 2006 at CZW's 7th anniversary show when Eddie Kingston and Joker won the tag titles and Ruckus regained the World title. On August 12, 2006, at Trapped, Eddie Kingston was kicked out of Blackout and his tag team title was given to Ruckus. Around this time, Sabian and Joker left Blackout and CZW. On September 9, 2006, Ricky Reyes joined Blackout and helped Eddie Kingston win the World Championship. Kingston then rejoined Blackout. Also on this day, Blackout was stripped of the tag team titles due to Joker's departure from CZW when he and Sabian joined Pro Wrestling Unplugged (PWU). On October 14 at Last Team Standing, two teams representing Blackout were entered in an 8-man tournament to crown new champions. However, Ricky Reyes couldn't be at the show, and Kingston refused to be in the tournament. Instead, Ruckus teamed with the debuting Human Tornado and Kingston brought in the Dead Presidents. The Dead Presidents lost in the first round, and Ruckus and Tornado lost in the second round to the Kings of Wrestling. After the match, Ruckus and Robbie Mireno attacked Human Tornado. Then, Sabian returned and helped with the attack. Also on this show, the original Blackout of Onyx and Rainman made their CZW debuts and started a feud with The Blackout, claiming that The Blackout has been ruining their name. On November 11, 2006, Robbie Mireno and Sabian teamed to defeat Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli, bringing the Tag Team Championships back to the Blackout a fourth time. They held the titles for one month and lost them to Onyx and Rainman at Cage of Death 8. Eddie Kingston lost the world title on the same show to Justice Pain. Sabian and Ruckus would regain the Tag Titles from Onyx and Rainman at New Year, New Opportunities on January 13. On April 21, 2007, Ruckus and Sabian captured the Maryland Championship Wrestling Tag Team Championship, defeating champions Phat Blues Inc. (Kelly Bell and Buzz Stryker) and The Best of Both Worlds (Doyle Day and Buck Chyld). On July 14, 2007, at CZW Best of the Best 7, Ruckus won the CZW World Heavyweight Championship for a third time defeating Justice Pain with help from Robby Mireno, Chrissy Rivera and Sabian. This also marked the BLKOUT's reunion with Joker who returned to CZW to take part in the Best of the Best Tournament, which he won. They congratulated him for his hard work and winning the tournament. At the October 11 CZW event entitled Decision 08, Ruckus and Sabian won the CZW World Tag Team Championship for a third time, before losing it back to 2 Girls, 1 Cup (the team of Beef Wellington and Greg Excellent). On the 11th Anaversery show, the Blackout lost a ladder match to Bruce Maxwell and TJ Cannon. When this happened, all the rights to the blackout name (kayfabe) went to former manager Robbie Marino. On May 14, 2011, at CZW Proving Grounds, Robbie Mireno, Ruckus and Chrissy Rivera came out to the ring after a match between Rich Swann and Alex Colon and offered both of them a spot in BLK OUT. Which they both accepted. Chikara Eddie Kingston and Sabian competed in Chikara's Tag World Grand Prix 2006, but were eliminated in the quarterfinals by Team F.I.S.T. Ruckus, Sabian, and Joker competed in King of Trios 2007, losing in the first round to Team TNA, the team of Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, and Sonjay Dutt. Ruckus, Eddie Kingston, and Joker then went on to compete in Chikara's 2008 King of Trios Tournament. They made it all the way to the Finals before they were defeated by Los Luchadores de Mexico (Lince Dorado, El Pantera, and Incognito). Other Although they lost rights to represent BLKOUT in CZW Sabian, Ruckus and Joker continued to perform together. Sabian and Joker under the name \\"Philly's Most Wanted\\" won CZW World tag team championship in 2011. Sabian and Ruckus had a few tag team matches in RCW, JAPW and ICW even challenging JAPW tag team championship. In Spring of 2012 Sabian and Ruckus took part in Extreme Reunion/Rising shows, losing to Los Dramaticos (better known as the S.A.T.) and to The Gangstas. They won their match on November 17 in Monaca, PA against the FBI. On July 21, 2012 it was announced that Ruckus and Sabian (as \\"Jeez\\") under the name BLKOUT would take part in an 8-team tournament to determine Ring Of Honor World tag team champions. This would be Sabian's debut in ROH and Ruckus's return to ROH after 4 years of absence.

He later worked as a cable television and sports marketing executive and media personality. Sherman was head coach of the NFL's New York Giants from 1961 to the 1969 preseason. He won three consecutive Eastern Conference titles with the Giants from 1961 to 1963, and coached in three NFL Pro Bowls. Sherman collected two NFL Coach of the Year Awards, in 1961 and 1962, the first time such an honor was awarded to the same person in consecutive years. He was the first \\"media\\" NFL head coach, producing and hosting his own shows on television and radio, and becoming a frequent on-air football analyst. After coaching, he had a long career at Warner Communications (today WarnerMedia), where he developed the first cable television sports networks, pioneered interactive and pay-per-view television and events, oversaw and marketed the New York Cosmos soccer team, and produced for ABC and worldwide syndication Pel√©'s farewell game event (with Muhammad Ali and other celebrities). Later, new New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani tapped Sherman to become president of the failing New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation (OTB), which, within two years, Sherman made profitable for the first time while revitalizing its tawdry image. Early life Sherman was Jewish, and his parents were Russian Jews who migrated from Russia to New York in 1920.Last Team Standing: How the Steelers and the Eagles‚Äî\\"The Steagles\\"‚ÄîSaved ... - Matthew Algeo Sherman was born in Brownsville in New York City's borough of Brooklyn, then lived in New Lots, East New York, and Crown Heights.There Were Giants in Those Days: The New York Giants Dynasty 1954-1963 - Gerald Eskenazi He attended P.S. 202, and for junior high school attended P.S. 149, which was also attended by actor Danny Kaye. Always playing sandlot sports, especially football, as a sophomore at 13 years old and weighing 125 pounds, he tried out for the football team at Boys High School in Brooklyn. The coach told him he was too small and should try handball instead, and because of his small size and young age his mother refused to sign the required permission slip.Leveling the Playing Field: The Story of the Syracuse Eight - David Marc Sherman became the captain of the Boys' High handball team, which won division titles. To earn spending money, on weekends he and his doubles partner would \\"cross over\\" to the tougher side of Brooklyn to hustle older players who bet big money and hopefully did not recognize them. He graduated in 1939 with a 96 average at the age of 16, and entered college. Brooklyn College Sherman entered Brooklyn College, and tried out for football again, but this time Coach Lou Oshins took him on as a quarterback, recalling, \\"His dedication to football was absolute, astonishing.\\"Former Jewish Football Coach Passes Away - Jewish Voice When Sherman's mother saw how violent the game was, however, she made him quit. He and Oshins eventually made his mother relent. During the summer before his sophomore year, while Sherman waited on tables in the Catskills, Oshins mailed Sherman weekly sections of Clark Shaughnessy's book about the new T-formation, leading Sherman to refer to himself as \\"a correspondence school quarterback\\". Sherman had also taken a football with him to the Catskills, and spent time throwing it at trees to improve his accuracy. He became the starting quarterback in 1940, and played for the team from 1940-42.NFL Head Coaches: A Biographical Dictionary, 1920‚Äì2011 - John Maxymuk One of the few colleges running the T-formation, he captained the 1941‚Äì42 Brooklyn College team that upset the favored cross-town rival City College, and completed seven straight passes in a \\"scrimmage\\" against an NFL team then called the Brooklyn Dodgers. A teammate was future longtime Boston Celtics play-by-play man Johnny Most. Sherman graduated cum laude in 1943 just have turned 20 years of age, and 5' 10\\" and 160 pounds. Sherman is a member of the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in Long Island, New York, and the Brooklyn College Hall of Fame.Former NY Giants coach Allie Sherman dead at 91 NFL playing career After he graduated in 1943 (a psychology major), the Philadelphia Eagles' future Hall of Fame coach, Earl \\"Greasy\\" Neale, took Sherman on as a \\"prospect\\" and to help the Eagles and their All-Pro quarterback Roy Zimmerman convert from a single wing offense into the T-formation. Neale commented, \\"Never have I seen a player with a greater understanding of the game. He was so dedicated, he insisted on rooming with a lineman. He wanted to absorb the way a lineman thought.\\" He called Sherman \\"the smartest man in football.\\" In his rookie season, he played with a combined Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers squad (due to manpower shortages caused by World War II). The team, called the Steagles, finished third in the NFL East with a record of 5‚Äì4‚Äì1. Playing both quarterback and defensive back, Sherman spent five seasons with the Eagles, who finished second in the NFL East from 1944 to 1946. In 1946, he completed 17 of 33 passes for 264 yards, and led the league in yards-per-passing-attempt (8.00). The following year, he helped lead the Eagles to the NFL East title with a record of 8‚Äì4‚Äì0. They tied the Pittsburgh Steelers for first, and then defeated Pittsburgh in a playoff to reach the NFL championship game, which they lost to the Chicago Cardinals, 28‚Äì21. In all, he completed 48.9% of his 135 pass attempts for nine touchdowns, while running for four more. After the 1947 season, having played in 51 NFL games, Sherman took Neale's advice and shifted to coaching. Coaching career Sherman spent the 1948 season as a rookie head coach and quarterback for the Paterson Panthers, a minor league New Jersey team, and won the championship. In 1949, upon Neale's recommendation, he became backfield coach for the New York Giants under head coach Steve Owen, and converted Charlie Conerly into a T-formation quarterback. In a 1950 preseason exhibition game against the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League, Sherman came out of retirement to play quarterback for the Giants in the first half of a game which New York won by the score of 27-6. When Owen retired as the Giants' coach after the 1953 season, and Sherman did not get his job, he became head coach of the CFL's Winnipeg Blue Bombers. The Bombers made the playoffs three years in a row; and, with the CFL's 12-man squads and broad pre-snap motion rules, Sherman gained a reputation for designing complex offensive schemes that made defenses dizzy. \\"We had so many guys moving before the snap, it looked like a damned ballet\\", Sherman said. One of his players was future Hall of Famer Minnesota Vikings coach Bud Grant. In 1957 he returned to the Giants as a scout, and then rejoined the coaching staff in 1959 as offensive coordinator, replacing Vince Lombardi when Lombardi was appointed head coach of the Green Bay Packers. Lombardi, a good friend, wanted Sherman to join him as the Packers' offensive coordinator; but Sherman wanted the Giants' head coaching position. In 1961, Sherman was promoted to head coach. He traded for a number of younger players to bolster an aging squad, such as star quarterback Y. A. Tittle, swift receiver Del Shofner, and defensive backs Erich Barnes and Allan Webb, and then led the Giants to the NFL Eastern Conference championship, which landed them in the NFL championship game. Although they lost to the Packers on the road, 37‚Äì0, Sherman was named NFL Coach of the Year because the Giants had improved from a 6‚Äì4‚Äì2 record in 1960 to 10‚Äì3‚Äì1 in 1961. The following year, with running back Frank Gifford returning from injury, Sherman led the Giants back to the NFL title game after repeating as NFL East champions with a 12‚Äì2 record. He was again named NFL Coach of the Year, the first awarded that in consecutive seasons, although his Giants again fell to Green Bay, this time 16‚Äì7 in Yankee Stadium. In 1963 the Giants won their third straight Eastern title, but lost in the championship game on the road, 14‚Äì10, to the Chicago Bears, who injured Tittle's leg, taking him out of the game. It was the Giants' last appearance in an NFL championship game until Super Bowl XXI in 1986‚Äì87. Sherman and his coaching staff coached three NFL Pro Bowl games, from 1961 to 1963. In 1965 and 1966, with the support of owner Wellington Mara, Sherman added two retired Giants to his staff, Emlen Tunnell and Rosey Brown. In addition to being future Hall of Famers, both were African American, the first black assistant coaches in the NFL. With much racial strife in the country at the time, this caused controversy in both the press and parts of the league, particularly in the still-segregated southern areas. In 1968 Sherman and his coaching staff were invited to coach the Senior Bowl's North Team, played in Mobile, Alabama. During the practice week, the Bowl organization held a big banquet at a local country club. Shortly beforehand, Sherman was told that Tunnell and Brown were not invited because of the club's segregation policy. Sherman quickly informed the Bowl committee that no Giants personnel would attend the banquet unless everyone was invited. When it was clear nothing could change his mind, the club relented. That was the first evening in the club's history that two African-Americans were seated and served in the dining room. Sherman remained close friends with both until their deaths. Sherman coached the Giants for another five seasons, but with an aging defense and retirements of Tittle, Gifford, and others, the team began rebuilding with younger players and went through up and down years. Some fans, used to a playoff club, did not like trades of favorite established players like Rosie Grier, Don Chandler, and Sam Huff. Some trades, however, authorized by Mara, occurred for unpublicized, inside-locker-room reasons. By 1966 some spectators at Yankee Stadium took to chanting \\"Goodbye Allie\\", waving banners to that effect and even putting the slogan to song. This never bothered Sherman; he told reporters that his pro philosophy was \\"They paid their money, and can do what they want,\\" and joked that he owned the rights to the banners and song and made a fortune in royalties. Despite an improved season record of 7‚Äì7 in 1967, while being the leading NFL offensive team for much of it, and 7‚Äì7 again in 1968, one game away from the playoffs, after a poor preseason performance in 1969 (including a 37‚Äì14 loss to the Super Bowl champion New York Jets, led by Joe Namath, whom Sherman wanted to draft in 1965), Sherman was dismissed in September, a week before the regular season, finishing 57‚Äì51‚Äì4 for his Giants coaching career. With a ten-year contract signed in 1965 at $50,000 ($ in current dollar terms) annually, he was on the payroll through 1974. NFL and media Friends with new NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle, a former public relations executive, Sherman saw merit in Rozelle's strategy to increase the NFL's value by increasing its television coverage, franchises, and entertainment marketing, which would expand NFL rights fees and revenues. Sherman developed himself into the first media-savvy professional coach. It was his policy to face the press regularly and answer questions with candor (but never knocking his players). He conducted never- before-done daily press conferences during training camp and, every Monday morning after a game, presented game film clips and evaluations. He held a big Christmas party for all of press, even his critics. Some critiqued Sherman as sometimes being \\"very Madison Avenue-ish.\\" Rethinking his 1963 rejection of writer George Plimpton's proposal to allow Plimpton to pose in training camp as a rookie quarterback (resulting in bestseller and movie Paper Lion), in 1966 Sherman and Mara accepted author Eliot Asinof's proposal to spend two years with the team having total freedom and unlimited access to players, coaches, and executives, even closed coaches meetings. This resulted in a never-before seen behind-the-scenes look of the inner world of the professionals, Seven Days To Sunday, published in 1968 (whose opening line is, \\"Allie Sherman's hundred-hour week began around 7am [on Monday]\\"). He produced and owned the first pro football coach's weekly television program, on independent NYC station WPIX, reviewing film of the Giants‚Äô prior game and discussing football with invited players, coaches, and guests, giving many fans their first peek inside professional football and ‚Äúup close and personal‚Äù moments with the players. He co-produced and hosted a Monday night radio program, Ask Allie, airing on the Giants‚Äô station, WNEW, where it was just him sitting in a booth, smoking a cigar, and directly taking fans‚Äô call-in questions and comments. The press respected Sherman for facing fans weekly (especially just 24 hours after a tough loss) and always treating them graciously. He also hosted the first nationally syndicated TV panel-discussion sports show called Pro Football Special, where, in reviewing touchdown plays, he would say that the runner, once in the clear, \\"goes in for the touch.\\" During the 1980s and early 1990s he became the first pre-game pro football analyst and a frequent guest on the nascent ESPN and the networks. He also helped create what became NFL Films. In 1962 Sherman's friend and Giants fan Ed Sabol asked Sherman and Mara for exclusive rights to film game and off- field footage. Sabol would rush the film reels out of Yankee Stadium in team laundry baskets, spend all night developing them, and create special content for network sports shows. This enterprise evolved into NFL Films, eventually under Sabol's son Steve, with its large NFL catalogue and unique programming. In 1985 Sabol and Sherman co-created and produced a new type of show, Monday Night Matchup, shown on ESPN just before ABC's national Monday Night game, where Sherman and co-hosts, such as Ron \\"Jaws\\" Jaworski, would break down the teams into key match-ups and use stop-action film and graphics to analyze the upcoming game. This format later became a standard feature in ESPN's and the networks‚Äô sports programming. Second career, after football After Sherman was released by the Giants, he turned down several coaching offers from around the league. Foreseeing the coming major increase in NFL revenue and franchise values, he then wanted to be involved in a team management-ownership position. He led an effort with several New York friends and other parties to purchase an NFL franchise. They came close several times, including the New York Jets in 1970, but reluctant team owners and some investors' concerns about valuation prevented a purchase. One of the disappointed investors was Sherman's close friend, Warner Communications Inc.'s CEO Steve Ross, who was building cable television franchises and had recently purchased Warner Bros. Studio for its film and TV content. Ross agreed with Sherman that sports content also had great potential value, with cable television as a delivery system. Ross asked Sherman to join WCI and use his coaching and media expertise to build good teams and develop these potential assets. While helping WCI win cable franchises in additional cities, Sherman was part of WCI's experimental QUBE system in Columbus, Ohio: the nation's first interactive cable system, enabling QUBE customers to individually order film and other content direct from home on a pay-per-view basis. Sherman recognized its marketing and revenue potential for sports programming. He created cable's first sports subscription package with Ohio State University Chancellor Gordon Gee. To provide special content for its Pittsburgh system, Sherman negotiated the purchase of minority ownership of the Pittsburgh Pirates. He managed WCI's position and built a similar Pirates subscription package for WCI cable customers. In each WCI cable system, in big cities like Dallas and Chicago, Sherman continued to acquire college and professional sports rights, and then built regional sports networks to exhibit the games and specially created related programming. Eventually they were all purchased, and are known today as the Fox Sports Networks. Sherman positioned WCI's growing cable systems as an integral part of the sales and marketing of national pay-per-view events, especially high-priced championship fights. He negotiated special rights deals with impresarios and friends Don King and Bob Arum. In the mid-1970s, Ross created a soccer team, the New York Cosmos, which acquired talent from around the world, such as Brazil's Pel√© and Germany's Franz Beckenbauer. The Cosmos became the emerging North American Soccer League's premier team and played at home in New Jersey's Meadowlands' 75,000-seat stadium (where the Giants and Jets played) to small crowds of mostly the nationality of the Cosmos's opponent. Sherman took over the team's management and marketing, to expand the fan base to bigger, broader audiences. Sherman used Pel√© and other stars to sell the game's excitement, reached out to regional youth soccer clubs, negotiated a special television deal for more exposure, and made Cosmos games into an event. The next season, Meadowlands stadium sold out every Cosmos game with broad, inclusive audiences. Sherman became close with Pel√© (who Pel√© called \\"Allie Boss\\" and later they both shared WCI office space), and Pel√© requested that ASherman produce his 1977 farewell game. Sherman put together a package of an ABC special game presentation, a worldwide syndicate of TV networks in 117 countries (including the Soviet Union), global sponsors to market it, had Frank Gifford as host with myriad celebrities and officials, ending with a special award presented by Muhammad Ali. It remains, as of 2014, was the most highly rated non-World Cup soccer event. In 1994, new New York mayor Rudy Giuliani (one of whose campaign slogans was ‚ÄúOTB is the only bookie in the world that loses money every year‚Äù), asked Sherman to become president of the New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation (OTB) and try to turn OTB into a money maker with a better image. With the mayor's support, during the next three years Sherman instituted new, multimedia marketing campaigns using NYC celebrities as spokespeople, closed a number of run-down OTB parlors around the city while cleaning up the remaining ones, opened OTB new betting facilities in upscale sports restaurants, cut costs and revamped antiquated OTB procedures, and created a phone betting system to provide customer convenience and increase volume. Also, in a private-public partnership, Sherman worked with the New York Racing Association and Warner Cable in a joint venture with OTB to create a new, low-cost daily racing channel, showing races from around the country that customers could bet on over the phone and then watch at home. The OTB Channel continued to run for over twenty years, in the black. By 1996 OTB was profitable for the first time, with a new, fresher image. Personal life Marty Glickman, former Olympian and sportscaster, introduced Allie to his future wife, Joan, in the early 1950s. Throughout the years, Sherman was involved with many charities, including children charities, especially for those with special needs, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and the Veteran's Bedside Network (where he regularly visited Veterans‚Äô hospitals, to talk football and sports with disabled veterans). On January 3, 2015, he died at the age of 91.Allie Sherman's obituary NFL player record :Physical: 5 ft 10 in, 168 pounds :Games: 51 :Passes completed: 66 :Passes attempted: 135 :Passing percentage: 48.9 :Passing yards: 823 :Passing touchdowns: 9 :Interceptions thrown: 10 :Rushes: 93 :Rushing yards: 44 :Rushing average: 0.5 :Rushing touchdowns: 4 :Fumbles: 10 :Interceptions: 2 See also * History of the New York Giants (1925‚Äì1978) * List of select Jewish football players References * The Encyclopedia of Football, by Roger Treat (New York: A.S.

Aftermath and reconstruction Members of a refugee family left homeless by the flood in Shawneetown, Illinois Media response A handful of powerhouse radio stations, including WLW and WHAS, quickly switched to non-stop news coverage, transmitting commercial-free for weeks. These broadcasts consisted mostly of messages being relayed to rescue crews, as many civil agencies had no other means of communication. The Regionalist painter Thomas Hart Benton was commissioned by The Kansas City Star and St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspapers to provide sketches depicting the miserable conditions of the flooded areas in the Missouri Bootheel region. When it became obvious that the river would cut the electric power to radio station WHAS‚Äîthus cutting the last radio voice in Louisville‚Äîthe rival clear channel station in Nashville, WSM, picked up WHAS's broadcast via telephone and broadcast emergency flood reports for three days for the lower Ohio River. Other stations across the country did much the same. Government response In January 1937, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, District Engineer, MAJ Bernard Smith dispatched an entire fleet down the Cumberland River for rescue and relief work in response to the severe flooding. The bridges were too low to allow the vessels to pass under, so the vessels were forced to steam across farmland and bridge approaches, dodging telephone and power lines. The federal government under President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent thousands of area WPA workers to the affected cities to aid in rescue and recovery. It also sent supplies for food and temporary housing, and millions of dollars in aid after the floodwaters receded. The scale of the 1937 flood was so unprecedented that civic and industrial groups lobbied national authorities to create a comprehensive plan for flood control. The plan involved creating more than seventy storage reservoirs to reduce Ohio River flood heights. Not fully completed by the Army Corps of Engineers until the early 1940s, the new facilities have drastically reduced flood damages since. In the 1930s, the Tennessee Valley Authority sought to create a continuous minimum 9-foot (2.7 m) channel along the entirety of the Tennessee River from Paducah to Knoxville. The Authority also sought to help control flooding on the lower Mississippi River, especially in the aftermath of the Ohio River flood of 1937, as research had shown that 4% of the water in the lower Mississippi River originates in the Tennessee River watershed. TVA surveyed the lower part of the river and considered the Aurora Landing site, but eventually settled on the present site at river mile 22.4. The Kentucky Dam project was authorized on May 23, 1938, and construction began July 1, 1938.Tennessee Valley Authority, The Kentucky Project: A Comprehensive Report on the Planning, Design, Construction, and Initial Operations of the Kentucky Project, Technical Report No. 13 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1951), pp. 1‚Äì12, 68, 115‚Äì116, 509. Much of the work of the Tennessee Valley Authority in the Tennessee River basin was strongly supported by the majority of the citizens in western Kentucky and their representatives in the United States Congress. U.S. Sen. Alben W. Barkley of Paducah and U.S. Rep. William Gregory from Mayfield and his brother U.S. Rep. Noble Gregory from Mayfield who succeeded him in office strongly supported the funding of TVA and its role in addressing flood control, soil conservation, family relocation, recreation, production of electricity, and economic development.Kleber, John E., ed (1992). \\"Tennessee Valley Authority\\", p.875. The Kentucky Encyclopedia. Associate editors: Thomas D. Clark, Lowell H. Harrison, and James C. Klotter. Lexington, Kentucky: The University Press of Kentucky. . States seriously affected Ohio Six to of rain fell in Ohio during January 13‚Äì25, 1937, totals never before or since equaled over such a large area of Ohio. January 1937 remains as the wettest month ever recorded in Cincinnati. One hundred thousand people in Cincinnati were left homeless, as the flood affected the city from January 18 to February 5. The river reached its peak on January 26, at , more than higher than flood stage. Ohio River levels on January 26‚Äì27 were the highest known from Gallipolis downstream past Cincinnati. Crests were 20 to above flood stage and 4 to above the previous record of 1884. of the city's area was flooded, the water supply was cut, and streetcar service was curtailed. Among the flooded structures was Crosley Field, home field of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team. Additionally, the amusement park Coney Island was submerged, causing pieces of carousel horses to float away, which were recovered as far downriver as Paducah. At Portsmouth, the rising river threatened to top the flood wall, erected above flood stage. City officials deliberately opened the flood gates and allowed river water to flood the business district 8 to deep, thus preventing a catastrophic breaching of the flood wall. The Ohio River eventually crested over the top of the flood wall. Ten people died, many fewer than the 467 killed in the floods of March 1913. Indiana An upturned farmhouse in Posey County, Indiana. The river rose to a record , which was above flood stage, and sent water over the six-month- old riverfront plaza in Evansville. The city and state declared martial law on January 24 and the federal government sent 4,000 WPA workers to the city to assist rescue operations. Residents were rapidly evacuated from river towns by train and bus in the early stages of the flood, making Indiana the only state to avoid drowning fatalities. More than 100,000 persons were left homeless by the disaster. The WPA workers led the cleanup of the city. The Evansville Merchants Retail Bureau took out newspaper ads to praise their work: > Before and during the flood these men of WPA were active in salvaging > property and saving lives, and immediately afterward they handled the > cleanup job with such efficiency that many visitors were amazed that there > was practically no evidence of the flood left throughout our entire city. > All honor and gratitude is due to the rank and file of the WPA for their > often almost super-human efforts, always giving their best in the interest > of humanity. The Red Cross and federal government spent the equivalent of $11 million in today's money in aid to the city. The Indiana State Flood Commission was created in response, and it established the Evansville-Vanderburgh Levee Authority District, which built a system of earth levees, concrete walls, and pumping stations to protect the city. Jeffersonville welcomed the 1,000 WPA workers who came to rescue that city's residents. The federal government spent $500,000 in aid there, and $70,000 in New Albany. The Pennsylvania Railroad evacuated many area residents by train from its depot in Jeffersonville. Several small riverside towns, such as Mauckport and New Amsterdam, were so devastated that they never recovered. Illinois Harrisburg suffered flooding from the Ohio River in 1883‚Äì1884 and again in 1913. Much of the city, except \\"Crusoes' Island\\", a downtown orbit that encircled the town square, was underwater. High water had reached from the river, and the city was flooded in its position among tributary lowlands of the Saline River. . Floodwaters reached nearly inland and Harrisburg was nearly destroyed. 4,000 within Harrisburg were left homeless and 80% of the city was inundated.The Pittsburgh Press, page 50. United Press, 29 January 1937. Many flooded mines were deemed condemned which left the local economy crippled. In 1938, the state of Illinois had completed one of the largest operations of its kind ever attempted in the United States, the removal of more than two and a half billion gallons of flood water from Sahara mine No. 3 near downtown Harrisburg.Chicago Daily Tribune, page 4. United Press, 9 May 1938.. By the time the flood waters had receded, 4000 were left homeless. Between Gallatin County and Harrisburg, about of Illinois Route 13 was covered by of water; motorboats navigated the entire distance to rescue marooned families. National guard boats were the means of transportation in the city, and several thousand people were transported daily from temporary island to island. According to the Sanborn Map Company, Harrisburg in October 1925 had a population of 15,000, and in a revised version by January 1937 the population had fallen to 13,000. Afterwards, the Army Corps of Engineers erected a levee north and east of the city to protect it from future floods. The levee has become the official northern and eastern border of the town. Rural Pulaski County was functionally left an island by the rising portions of the Cache River, which near its mouth flowed in reverse as the Ohio floodwaters forced their way along the Cache to the Mississippi River above Cairo.Wall, J.L. Moyers' Brief History of Pulaski County. Mound City: Pulaski Enterprise, 1944. The majority of county residents were driven from their homes, while the riverside county seat, Mound City, was entirely flooded, with the shallowest locations still lying under of water. Cairo itself was saved only by low water levels on the Mississippi River, which rose only to the highest spots on the levees without surmounting them. The historic city of Shawneetown was completely inundated and the residents were forced to move to a tent city on the outskirts. Property damages in the southern Illinois region amounted to more than $75 million ($1.2 billion in 2015). Over three hundred bridges were smashed, six schools were ruined, and twelve hundred submerged homes. Flood waters were recorded at . Damage in Shawneetown was so cataclysmic the town relocated three miles inland to higher ground. Kentucky A building in Milton, Kentucky, with high water mark of 1937 on the second story Several businesses in the Louisville area were devastated, especially the famed Rose Island amusement park (on the Indiana side of the river near Charlestown), which never rebuilt. As a result of the flood, newer development in Louisville was directed to the east out of the flood plain. The east end has since benefited by a long-term concentration of wealth among residents and businesses which located away from the older central and western areas of the city. At Paducah, the Ohio River rose above its flood stage on January 21, cresting at on February 2 and receding again to on February 15. For nearly three weeks, 27,000 residents were forced to flee to stay with friends and relatives in higher ground in McCracken County or in other counties. Some shelters were provided by the American Red Cross and local churches. Buildings in downtown Paducah bear historic plaques that note the high-water marks, and at least one historic marker indicates the farthest inland extent of flood waters in the city. With of rainfall in 16 days, along with sheets of swiftly moving ice, the '37 flood was the worst natural disaster in Paducah's history. Because Paducah's earthen levee was ineffective against this flood, the United States Army Corps of Engineers was commissioned to build the flood wall that now protects the city.

The store, known as EBT, closed in 1968, and its building, which was on the National Register of Historic Places, was torn down in 1971. The store was started by Kersey Coates and William Gillis in the 1860s in the then Town of Kansas at the corner of Missouri Avenue and Main Street. Although initially outfitting travelers on the Oregon Trail and Santa Fe Trail, it soon became more upscale. It moved to a new three-story building at Seventh and Main. The original Coates and Gillis store became Coates and Bullene when it merged with a store operated by Thomas B. Bullene. It then became the Bullene, Moore and Emery department store. The store assumed its final name in the 1890s from the investors W. E. Emery, Joseph Taylor Bird. Sr. and William B. Thayer. In the 1890s it opened a new building occupying a full block along East 11th Street from Walnut to Grand, designed by the architectural firm of Van Brunt & Howe. It soon became the prime attraction on the city's main retail thoroughfare, popularly known as \\"Petticoat Lane,\\" and became famed for its Tea Room. Although the store attempted to expand, opening a branch on the Country Club Plaza in 1925 (enlarged in 1963) and purchasing the Bundschu store on the courthouse square in Independence, it could not keep pace with changing retail fashions and settlement patterns, and in 1968 it closed, with the loss of 800 jobs. After the downtown location was demolished, UMB Financial Corporation constructed a building on the site, retaining a few architectural elements from the EBT building. Until December 2015, a restaurant called EBT, at 103d Street and State Line Road near I-435, housed memorabilia from the store.

The poem is famous for its opening line and for referring to conservative Munich as the \\"morgue between Paris and Rome.\\" Style and structure The poem is written in 13 couplets, ending with a single one-line stanza, and follows no rhyme scheme. Context In the early 1960s, the fashion models were often referred to as \\"mannequins,\\" and those from Germany enjoyed special popularity. \\"The Munich Mannequins\\" was written in little over a month before her suicide, making it one of her Ariel poems. Interpretation In \\"The Munich Mannequins\\" Plath refers to the lives of women and how they are seen by others, specifically with regard to how biological functions related to childbearing are perceived to define them. The first line of the poem, \\"Perfection is terrible, it cannot have children,\\" refers both to the appearance of the culturally ubiquitous live German models and that of inanimate mannequins. Just as mannequins cannot procreate, nor can their live counterparts risk their \\"perfection\\" by becoming pregnant. Plath suggests that perfection itself \\"tamps the womb,\\" and goes on to describe the emotions she associates with menstruation, the cycles of menstruation symbolized by the moon.Women's Studies, Vol. 7, Nos. 1‚Äì2, 1980, pp. 171‚Äì83 Literary critic Pamela J. Annas argues \\"The Munich Mannequins\\" describes \\"particularly well the social landscape within which the \\"I\\" of Sylvia Plath's poems is trapped\\". She supports this ultimately through highlighting the domination of the artificial (mannequins) over the real (women) and the male society's transformation of women into puppets, and unnatural figures, representing their \\"disgust with\\" and \\"fear of women\\". She goes on to say that the winter setting in Plath's nature-themed poems represent a period of hibernation before spring and rebirth, while in the context of this city poem, a harsher, social, male-dominated setting, the winter setting represents death instead.

In 1926 the German art historian Max Jakob Friedl√§nder attributed a group of paintings of the Virgin and Child in a landscape, in identical poses to \\"Master of the Embroidered Foliage.\\" The foliage painted in these works was likened by Friedl√§nder to the repeated pattern of stitches in embroidery, thus the unusual name for the artist. The paintings show elements of previous works by Rogier van der Weyden and Hans Memling. Of the five paintings considered by Friedl√§nder, three are in the United States, at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Minneapolis Institute of Arts, and Clark Art Institute, and the other two in Europe, at the Groeningemuseum, Bruges, and the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts, Lille. Other paintings attributed to this group of artists are in the Louvre in Paris, the Detroit Institute of Arts, and in the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh; these also show a very similar Virgin and Child, but against somewhat different backgrounds. The Clark Art Institute conclude their investigation of the \\"Virgin and Child in a Landscape\\" paintings as follows: \\"Our analysis, based on laboratory study and consideration of fifteenth- century workshop practices, demonstrates that these panels were all produced between 1482 and the early 16th century not by one but by several artists, perhaps sharing a common template for the main figures. Unless further conclusive evidence comes to light, however, we will continue to attribute the paintings to the Master of the Embroidered Foliage, while acknowledging that this is a catch-all name referring to a number of painters active in Brussels and Bruges in the late 15th century.\\"Exhibition on Master of the Embroidered Foliage at Clark Art Institute, Williamstown See also * Aert van den Bossche Gallery File:Lille Pdba Barbe et Louis.JPGPortraits de Barbe de Croesinck et Louis Quarr√© en donateurs, oil on panel, circa 1480, Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille.

Cutler (born 1962) is an American filmmaker, documentarian, television producer and theater director. His work includes the documentary films The War Room, A Perfect Candidate, Thin, The September Issue, The World According to Dick Cheney and Listen to Me Marlon; the non-fiction television series American High, Freshman Diaries and 30 Days; the prime time drama series Nashville; the scripted podcast, The Oval Office Tapes; and the feature film If I Stay. Cutler's first film, The War Room, was nominated for an Academy Award and he is the recipient of numerous awards including an Emmy, two Peabody Awards, a GLAAD Award, two Cinema Eye Awards, and two Television Academy Honor Awards. In 2009, the Museum of Television and Radio held a five- day retrospective of his work. Early life Born in 1962, R. J. Cutler grew up in a Jewish home in Great Neck, New York. He attended Great Neck North Senior High School and graduated in 1979. Cutler graduated from Harvard University in 1984. He received his AB degree magna cum laude with a Special Concentration in Dramatic Theory and Literature. He was the recipient of the prestigious Hoopes Prize. In 1991, Cutler became a faculty member of the University of Southern California School of Theatre and a student at the USC School of Cinema-Television. Cutler has been producing and directing documentary films since 1992. Early career Cutler began his career as a theater director and was the first director selected to participate in the New York Drama League's Director's Apprenticeship Program. He worked as a director and producer at the American Repertory Theater and was director James Lapine‚Äôs assistant on the original Broadway production of the Sondheim/Lapine musical Into the Woods. He also served as Resident Director at New Dramatists. In 1988, Cutler directed the workshop production of Jonathan Larson's musical Superbia at Playwrights Horizons. That workshop became one of the subjects of Larson's next musical Tick, Tick, Boom.... Productions directed by Cutler between 1988 and 1990 include the world premiere of Right Behind the Flag by Kevin Heelan at Playwrights Horizons (starring Kevin Spacey), the American premiere of Emerald City by David Williamson at the New York Theatre Workshop, and the world premiere of The Secret Garden by Marsha Norman and Lucy Simon at the Virginia Stage Company.

Other producers included future This American Life creator Ira Glass and future Radio Diaries creator Joe Richman. The show aired live five nights a week on NPR stations across the country and received a Peabody Award. In 1991, Cutler became a faculty member of the University of Southern California School of Theatre and a student at the USC School of Cinema-Television. Cutler has been producing and directing documentary films since 1992. Documentary career In 1992, Cutler and his producing partner Wendy Ettinger approached filmmakers DA Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus with the idea to produce a film about the Bill Clinton‚Äôs first presidential campaign. Filmed in classic cinema verite style, The War Room premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 1993 and went on to be screened at the New York Film Festival that same year and the Berlin Film Festival the following February. It was released theatrically by October Films on November 3, 1993. It received a 95% \\"Fresh\\" rating on rottentomatoes.com. The War Room was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1993. That same year, the film won the National Board of Review Award for Best Documentary Film. In 2008, the filmmaking team behind The War Room reunited to catch up with their subjects 16 years later. The resulting film was called The Return of the War Room and it aired on Sundance Channel. It is also included as a special feature of the Criterion Collection edition of The War Room. In 2013, The Cinema Eye Honors awarded The War Room with its Legacy Award, \\"Intended to honor classic films that inspire a new generation of filmmakers.\\" In 1994, Cutler and co-director/producer David Van Taylor spent eleven months following the U.S. Senate campaign of Lt. Col. Oliver North who was running as a Republican to take the seat occupied by Democrat Charles S. Robb. North had risen to prominence as the key figure in the Reagan-era Iran-Contra scandal. The cinema verite film they made, A Perfect Candidate, featured access to both the North and Robb campaigns and told stories about non-candidates as well, including North strategist Mark Goodin, Washington Post reporters Don Baker and Peter Baker and Richmond Times-Dispatch reporter Mike Allen. A Perfect Candidate premiered at the Los Angeles Independent Film Festival in April 1996 and was released theatrically by Seventh Art Releasing on June 19, 1996. In 2010, the Washington Post included A Perfect Candidate and The War Room on its list of Best Political Movies Ever. In 1996, Cutler became the Supervising Producer of a weekly television show on then-nascent MSNBC called, Edgewise. Hosted by John Hockenberry, the show featured interviews, essays, and short documentary films produced by Cutler. In July 1997, the Nantucket Film Festival screened a program of ten of Cutler's Edgewise shorts. The following January, the Edgewise short Monte Hellman: American Auteur (directed by George Hickenlooper) was screened in competition at the Sundance Film Festival. In 1999, Cutler set out to create the first network \\"nonfiction drama,\\" a form of documentary serial storytelling that was new to American commercial prime time television. Cutler conceived of, developed and sold a television series called American High to Fox Television's drama division. Then he and two cinema verite crews spent an entire school year filming 14 students at Highland Park High School, a public high school 40 miles northwest of Chicago. Over the course of the year, they collected more than 2800 hours of footage, 70 percent of which was shot by Cutler's crews, and the rest of which was filmed by the students themselves with digital cameras provided by the filmmakers. This footage was then edited into 14 half-hour episodes. American High premiered on Fox Television on August 2, 2000. American High was cancelled by Fox after four episodes. The series was picked up by PBS which aired all fourteen episodes in their entirety. In 2001, American High received the first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program. It was nominated for the same award in 2002. As a follow-up to American High, Showtime commissioned Cutler to spend the 2002‚Äì2003 school year with a group of freshmen at the University of Texas in Austin. As with American High Cutler and his team assembled a group of students, filmed them cinema verite style for the full school year and provided them with digital cameras so that they could contribute their own footage to the project as well. When Freshman Diaries premiered on Showtime in August, 2003, Steve Johnson wrote in the Chicago Tribune, \\"Yes, the new 'reality' genre has dominated television, too often with simple-minded tributes to hormones and humiliation. But it has also made room for some compelling new documentary work that networks likely would have never had the courage to put on TV. Case in point: Sunday's new Freshman Diaries\\". David Zurawik of the Baltimore Sun wrote, \\"This is the place where the immediacy, and edge, of reality TV meets the power of the documentary film to show us the world as seen through the eyes of others\\". In 2003, as he was filming Freshman Diaries, Cutler created and directed the third in his trilogy of video diaries-driven documentary series, The Residents. Set among young physicians at UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, it told the stories of what it was like to make the transition from medical student to full-blown physician. The Residents premiered on Discovery Health Channel on October 12, 2003 and subsequently aired on The Learning Channel. In 2005, Cutler joined forces with director/producer Kahane Corn and served as the Executive Producer of the AMC documentary Making ‚ÄòDazed‚Äô which told the story of the making of Richard Linklater's seminal 1993 film Dazed and Confused. The film premiered on AMC on September 18, 2005. Also in 2005, Cutler was invited by executive producer Joe Berlinger to contribute a film to the History Channel's documentary series, Ten Days That Unexpectedly Changed America. Cutler produced and directed Shays Rebellion: The First American Civil War, which he conceived of as an animated documentary to be illustrated by Academy Award- winning animator Bill Plympton. Ten Days That Unexpectedly Changed America received the 2006 Emmy Award for Outstanding Nonfiction Series. In 2007, Cutler spent seven months filming legendary Vogue editor Anna Wintour and her staff as they produced what was at the time the single largest single issue of a magazine that had ever been published: the September, 2007 Vogue, which weighed in at 840 pages and 4.1 pounds. The film that resulted was The September Issue, directed and produced by Cutler, and financed by A&E; IndieFilms. While The September Issue features a host of Vogue personalities, designers, models, photographers, and others, its principal subject is the conflict-laden but deeply symbiotic relationship between the powerful, influential and notoriously frosty Wintour and her passionate fire-haired Creative Director Grace Coddington. The September Issue received its World Premiere at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, where it screened in competition and won the Grand Jury Prize for Cinematography. Roadside Attractions acquired the film shortly after Sundance and released it theatrically on August 28, 2009. The September Issue received the 2010 Cinema Eye Honors Audience Choice Award. After completing The September Issue, Cutler returned to outtakes from the footage he shot with Wintour and edited a short film called The Met Ball, which told the story of the 2007 Metropolitan Museum Costume Institute Ball. In 2009, Cutler produced the feature documentary Hick Town, directed by George Hickenlooper. It was their second collaboration, after 1997's Monte Hellman: American Auteur. Hick Town tells the story of then-Denver Mayor (later Colorado Governor) John Hickenlooper, who was the director's cousin, as the city of Denver was gearing up to host the 2008 Democratic National Convention. The film received its World Premiere at the 2009 Starz Denver Film Festival. Hickenlooper's intention was to turn the film into a non-fiction series, but the director died while shooting additional footage in 2010. In 2010, Cutler made rag & bone, a short documentary that told the story of Marcus Wainwright and David Neville, the designers behind the design house rag & bone, as they prepared for 2010 Fall Fashion Week in New York City. The cinema verite film was funded by Starbucks. In 2011, Cutler directed and produced Fish a twenty- minute film that told the story of Los Angeles chef Jon Shook, who with his partner Vinnie Dotolo had recently opened the Los Angeles-based restaurant Son of A Gun. The film was made as part of the USA Character Project and was presented by Ridley Scott and Tony Scott. In Fish, Cutler follows Shook as he goes fishing for a day and then turns the day's catch into a dish at Son of a Gun. In 2012 Cutler signed a deal to make documentary films for Showtime. The first film in their partnership was 2013's The World According to Dick Cheney, which Cutler produced and co-directed with Greg Finton. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2013. On April 26, 2013 Showtime announced that they had renewed their deal with Cutler to make documentary films for the pay cable network. The next film under the agreement was reported to be about legendary actor Marlon Brando, which Cutler would produce along with John Battsek (Searching for Sugarman) and which was to be directed by Stevan Riley (Fire in Babylon.) Scripted filmmaking career In 2009 Cutler decided to focus exclusively on creative producing and directing. \\"For me, the real satisfaction of the work is in the creative,\\" he told Variety reporter Cynthia Littleton. Cutler made a deal to merge his production company's projects with Evolution Film and Tape, effectively shutting down Actual Reality Pictures. In 2010, HBO ordered a pilot of Spring/Fall, a show set in the fashion industry and executive produced by Cutler, Jimmy Miller, and writer Kate Robin. The pilot was directed by Jake Kasdan and starred Tea Leoni and Hope Davis. It was not ordered to series. In 2011, ABC ordered a pilot for Nashville, executive produced by Cutler, Callie Khouri and Steve Buchanan, president of Gaylord Entertainment (owner of the Grand Ole Opry.) Cutler and Khouri had developed the show together over several months under a deal at Lionsgate Studios. Nashville was ordered to series on May 11, 2012. Nashville premiered on ABC on October 9, 2012. Reviewing it in Entertainment Weekly, critic Ken Tucker wrote, \\"Rarely does a pilot present a world as completely as Nashville does in its first hour‚Ä¶ One of the great pleasures of Nashville is that it arrived fully formed, with a sure sense of what it wants to accomplish dramatically, and with a masterful command of atmosphere and setting. No other new show this season projects such effortless assurance, hits so many notes of emotion.\\" On May 10, 2013 Nashville was renewed for a second season by ABC. On May 9, 2014 Nashville was renewed for a third season by ABC. In 2012 Lionsgate Television announced that it had entered into a two- year first-look television deal with Cutler to develop and produce scripted programming for broadcast and cable TV. In 2013, CBS signed Cutler to direct the pilot of The Ordained, executive produced by Frank Marshall and written by Lisa Takeuchi Cullen. The show about a Kennedy-like political family starred Charlie Cox, Sam Neill, Audra McDonald, Jorge Garcia and Hope Davis. It was not ordered to series. In 2013, MGM announced that it would finance Cutler's feature film directing debut, If I Stay. Warner Bros., New Line and MGM released If I Stay in theaters on August 22, 2014. In 2014, CBS announced that it had entered into a two-year first-look television deal with Cutler to develop, produce and direct scripted projects. Style and influences Cutler has cited Jim Bouton‚Äôs book Ball Four as an early influence on his story- telling and interest in non-fiction. He listed his Best Movies Ever for Newsweek as Oliver Stone‚Äôs Wall Street, Elia Kazan‚Äôs On the Waterfront, Woody Allen‚Äôs Crimes and Misdemeanors, Preston Sturges‚Äô The Lady Eve, Bob Fosse‚Äôs All That Jazz, Terrence Malick‚Äôs Badlands, Barbara Kopple‚Äôs Harlan County, USA and Sidney Lumet‚Äôs Dog Day Afternoon. While making The September Issue Cutler was influenced by Robert Drew‚Äôs Crisis, the Maysles Brothers‚Äô Gimme Shelter, George Cukor‚Äôs Philadelphia Story and Preston Sturges‚Äô The Lady Eve.

Positive reviews There are multiple research studies and evaluations in which students using Core-Plus Mathematics performed significantly better than comparison students on assessments of conceptual understanding, problem solving, and applications, and results were mixed for performance on assessments of by-hand calculation skills.Schoen, H. L., & Hirsch, C. R. (2003). The Core-Plus Mathematics Project: Perspectives and student achievement. In S. Senk & D. Thompson (Eds.), Standards-based school mathematics curricula: What are they? What do students learn? (pp. 311‚Äì344). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.Schoen, H. L., Hirsch, C. R., & Ziebarth, S. W. (1998). An emerging profile of the mathematical achievement of students in the Core-Plus Mathematics Project. Paper presented at the 1998 Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association. San Diego, CA. Some of these studies were funded by the National Science Foundation, the same organization that funded the development of Core-Plus Mathematics program. =Large-scale comparison studies= A three-part study of Core-Plus Mathematics and more conventional curricula were reported by researchers at the University of Missouri. The research was conducted as part of the Comparing Options in Secondary Mathematics: Investigating Curricula project, supported by the National Science Foundation under REC-0532214. The research was reported in the March and July 2013 issues of the Journal for Research in Mathematics Education and in the December 2013 issue of the International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education. The three studies examined student achievement in schools in 5 geographically dispersed states. The first study involved 2,161 students in 10 schools in first-year high school mathematics courses, the second study involved 3,258 students in 11 schools in second-year mathematics courses, and the third study involved 2,242 students in 10 schools in third-year mathematics courses. Results in the first study showed that Core-Plus Mathematics students scored significantly higher on all three end- of-year outcome measures: a test of common objectives, a problem solving and reasoning test, and a standardized achievement test. Results in the second study showed that Core-Plus Mathematics students scored significantly higher on a standardized achievement test, with no differences on the other measures. Results in the third study showed that Core-Plus Mathematics students scored significantly higher on a test of common objectives, with no differences on the other measure. =Other comparison studies= A study conducted by Schoen and Hirsch, two authors of Core-Plus Mathematics, reported that students using early versions of Core-Plus Mathematics did as well as or better than those in traditional single-subject curricula on all measures except paper-and-pencil algebra skills. A study on field-test versions of Core-Plus Mathematics, supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (Award MDR 9255257) and published in 2000 in the Journal for Research in Mathematics Education, reported that students using the first field-test versions of Core-Plus Mathematics scored significantly better on tests of conceptual understanding and problem solving, while Algebra II students in conventional programs scored significantly better on a test of paper-and-pencil procedures. Other studies reported that Core-Plus Mathematics students displayed qualities such as engagement, eagerness, communication, flexibility, and curiosity to a much higher degree than did students who studied from more conventional programs. A review of research in 2008 concluded that there were modest effects for Core-Plus Mathematics on mostly standardized tests of mathematics. With regard to achievement of students in minority groups, an early peer-reviewed paper documenting the performance of students from under-represented groups using Core-Plus Mathematics reported that at the end of each of Course 1, Course 2, and Course 3, the posttest means on standardized mathematics achievement tests of Core-Plus Mathematics students in all minority groups (African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics, and Native/Alaskan Americans) were greater than those of the national norm group at the same pretest levels. Hispanics made the greatest pretest to posttest gains at the end of each course. A later comparative study reported that Hispanic high school students using Core-Plus Mathematics made modest gains compared to the performance of students with other demographic backgrounds. Regarding preparation for college, studies of SAT and ACT test results reported that Core-Plus Mathematics students performed significantly better than comparison students on the SAT and performed as well on the ACT.Schoen, H. L., Ziebarth, S. W., Hirsch, C. R., & BrckaLorenz, A. (2010). A five-year study of the first edition of the Core-Plus Mathematics curriculum. Charlotte, NC: Information Age Publishing, Inc. Several studies examined the subsequent college mathematics performance of students who used different high school textbook series. These studies did not detect any differential effect of high school curriculum on placement in college mathematics courses, in subsequent performance, or in course-taking patterns.Schoen, H. L., & Hirsch, C. R. (2003, February). Responding to calls for change in high school mathematics: Implications for collegiate mathematics. American Mathematical Monthly, pp. 109‚Äì123. =Reviews of instructional materials and programs= EdReports, an independent nonprofit, recently completed evidenced-based reviews of K-12 instructional materials. In their analysis of Core-Plus Mathematics Courses 1-3, the three-year core program was found to meet expectations for alignment to the high school Common Core State Standards for Mathematics in terms of content, focus, and coherence, and in terms of rigor and mathematical practices. The Core-Plus Mathematics instructional materials also met EdReports criteria that the materials are well designed and reflect effective lesson structure and pacing.\\"Educator-led, evidence-based reviews of K-12 instructional materials.\\" EdReports.org In an in-depth analysis by The Center for Research on Reform in Education at Johns Hopkins University, Core- Plus Mathematics was given a \\"moderate\\" evidence rating, and is the only comprehensive three-year high school mathematics program to be rated at any level (strong, moderate, or promising) for meeting federal ESSA Standards for Evidence in terms of promoting student achievement.\\"Evidence for ESSA - Math Programs.\\" evidenceforessa.org. =Other research studies= In terms of core content development, a study comparing the development of quadratic equations in the Korean national curriculum and Core-Plus Mathematics found that some quadratic equation topics are developed earlier in Korean textbooks, while Core-Plus Mathematics includes more problems requiring explanations, various representations, and higher cognitive demand. Several studies have analyzed the teacher‚Äôs role in Core-Plus Mathematics.Ziebarth, S. W., Hart, E., Marcus, R., Ritsema B., Schoen, H. L., & Walker, R. (2008). High school teachers as negotiators between curriculum intentions and enactment. In J. Remillard, G. Lloyd, & B. Herbel-Eisenmann (Eds.), Mathematics teachers at work. (pp. 171‚Äì189). New York: Routledge Falmer. Negative reviews In November 1999, David Klein, professor of mathematics at California State University, Northridge, sent an open letter to the U.S. Department of Education, in response to the U.S. Department of Education Expert Panel in Mathematics and Science designation of Core-Plus Mathematics as \\"exemplary.\\" Klein's open letter urged the Department of Education to withdraw its recommendations of the several reform mathematics programs including Core-Plus Mathematics. The letter was co-signed by more than 200 American scientists and mathematicians. Prof. Klein asserts that the mathematics programs criticized by the open letter had common features: they overemphasized data analysis and statistics, while de-emphasizing far more important areas of arithmetic and algebra. Many of the \\"higher-order thinking projects\\" turned out to be just aimless activities. The programs were obsessed with electronic calculators, and basic skills were disparaged. Specifically, Core-Plus Mathematics was criticized for exhibiting \\"too shallow a coverage of traditional algebra, and a focus on highly contextualized work\\". R. James Milgram, Professor of Mathematics at Stanford University, analyzed the program's effect on students in a top-performing high school. According to Milgram, \\"...there was no measure represented in the survey, such as ACT scores, SAT Math scores, grades in college math courses, level of college math courses attempted, where the students even met, let alone surpassed the comparison group [which used a more traditional program].\\" =Andover High School Survey= One of the first schools to pilot Core-Plus was Andover High School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, which was ranked one of America's \\"100 best\\" high schools. Andover stopped traditional mathematics in 1994 and began using Core-Plus Mathematics. A survey conducted in 1997 of Andover graduates found that 96 percent of students who returned the survey said they were placed into ‚Äúremedial math‚Äù in college. In a neighboring school, 62 percent of the students who returned the survey took remedial math in college. Activism by a group of parents caused Andover to return to offering a traditional math option. By 2000, half of students at Andover were taking Core-Plus and the other half were taking traditional math. Students commented on the survey that Core Plus was one of the worst math programs and a waste of their time. They lamented never being taught \\"any of the basics and most are suffering in college math courses\\". They found themselves \\"completely unprepared\\" for understanding college math. The survey study has been criticized for involving a self-selected sample, self-reported data, and biased survey methods. Data provided by the University of Michigan registrar at this same time indicated that in collegiate mathematics courses at the University of Michigan graduates of Core-Plus did as well as or better than graduates of a traditional mathematics curriculum. A later study (see below) found that graduates of the Core-Plus curriculum entering Michigan State University have placed into increasingly lower level mathematics courses as the implementation of the curriculum has progressed. This study and the published report have been criticized for design flaws and for drawing conclusions that are not supported by the data. =A study of Core-Plus students attending Michigan State University= In 2006, Richard O. Hill and Thomas H. Parker from Michigan State University (MSU) evaluated the effectiveness of the Core-Plus Mathematics Project in preparing the students for subsequent university mathematics. R. Hill and T. Parker analyzed the college mathematics records of students arriving at MSU from four high schools that implemented the Core-Plus Mathematics program between 1996 and 1999. They found a \\"disconnect\\" between the mathematics expectations that students encounter in K-12 education and those that they encounter in college. The effectiveness of Core-Plus and the other NSF-funded high school curricula programs became a significant issue for college mathematics faculty. Core-Plus students placed into, and enrolled in, increasingly lower level courses. The percentages of students who eventually passed a technical calculus course showed a statistically significant decline averaging 27 percent a year; this trend was accompanied by an obvious and statistically significant increase in percentages of students who placed into low-level and remedial algebra courses. Except for some top students, graduates of Core-Plus mathematics were struggling in college mathematics, earning below average grades. They were less well prepared than either graduates in the Control group (who came from a broad mix of curricula) or graduates of their own high schools before the implementation of Core-Plus mathematics. =Review by Prof. Harel= In 2009 professor of mathematics at the University of California in San Diego, Guershon Harel reviewed four high-school mathematics programs. The examined programs included Core-Plus Courses 1, 2, and 3. The examination focused on two topics in algebra and one topic in geometry, deemed by Prof. Harel central to the high school curriculum. The examination was intended \\"to ensure these topics are coherently developed, completely covered, mathematically correct, and provide students a solid foundation for further study in mathematics\\". From the outset, Prof. Harel noted that the content presentation in Core-Plus program is unusual in that its instructional units, from the start to the end, are made of word problems involving \\"real-life\\" situations. This structure is reflected in the subtitle of the Core-Plus series: Contemporary Mathematics in Context. To review the program, it was necessary to go through all the problems in the core units and their corresponding materials in the Teacher‚Äôs Edition. Despite the unconventional textbook structure, the language used by the Core-Plus program was found mathematically sound. In the algebra section, fundamental theorems on linear functions and quadratic functions were found not justified, except for the quadratic formula. Theorems are often presented without proof. Like in the algebra texts, the geometry text does not lead to a clear logical structure of the material taught. Because theoretical material is concealed within the text of the problems, \\"a teacher must identify all the critical problems and know in advance the intended structure to establish the essential mathematical progression. This task is further complicated by the fact that many critical problems appear in the homework sections. Important theorems in geometry are not justified. Moreover, with the way the material is sequenced, some of these theorems cannot be justified\\". According to Prof. Harel, the Core-Plus program \\"excels in providing ample experience in solving application problems and in ensuring that students understand the meanings of the different parts of the modeling functions. The program also excels in its mission to contextualize the mathematics taught\\". However, it fails \\"to convey critical mathematical concepts and ideas that should and can be within reach for high school students\\". =Review by Prof. Wilson= Professor W. Stephen Wilson from Johns Hopkins University evaluated the mathematical development and coherence of the Core-Plus program in 2009. In particular, he examined \\"the algebraic concepts and skills associated with linear functions because they are a critical foundation for the further study of algebra\\", and evaluated how the program presents the theorem that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees, \\"which is a fundamental theorem of Euclidean geometry and it connects many of the basics in geometry to each other\\". Prof. Wilson noted that the major theme of the algebra portion of the program seems to involve creating a table from data, graphing the points from the table; given the table students are asked to find a corresponding function. In case of linear function, \\"at no point is there an attempt to show that the equation's graph really is a line. Likewise, there is never an attempt to show that a line graph comes from the usual form of a linear equation\\". Prof. Wilson considered this approach to be \\"a significant flaw in the mathematical foundation\\". Quoting the textbook, \\"Linear functions relating two variables x and y can be represented using tables, graphs, symbolic rules, or verbal descriptions\\", Prof. Wilson laments that although this statement is true, \\"the essence of algebra involves abstraction using symbols\\". Prof. Wilson says that the Core-Plus program \\"has a multitude of good problems, but never develops the core of the mathematics of linear functions. The problems are set in contexts and mathematics itself is rarely considered as a legitimate enterprise to investigate\\". The program lacks attention to algebraic manipulation\\" to the point that \\"symbolic algebra is minimized\\". In regards to geometry portion, Prof. Wilson concludes that the program fails to build geometry up from foundations in a mathematically sound and coherent way\\". He stresses out that \\"one significant goal of a geometry course is to teach logic, and this program fails on that account\\". Overall, the \\"unacceptable nature of geometry\\" and the fashion in which the program downplays \\"algebraic structure and skills\\" make the Core-Plus program unacceptable.  Historical Controversy  Mathematics programs initially developed in the 1990s that were based on the NCTM‚Äôs Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics, like Core-Plus Mathematics, have been the subject of controversy due to their differences from more conventional mathematics programs. In the case of Core-Plus Mathematics, there has been debate about (a) the international-like integrated nature of the curriculum, whereby each year students learn algebra, geometry, statistics, probability, and discrete mathematical modeling, as opposed to conventional U.S. curricula in which just a single subject is studied each year, (b) a concern that students may not adequately develop conventional algebraic skills, (c) a concern that students may not be adequately prepared for college, and (d) a mode of instruction that relies less on teacher lecture and demonstration and more on inquiry, problem solving in contextualized settings, and collaborative work by students. For example, this debate led to some schools in Minnesota abandoning Core-Plus Mathematics in the early 2000s and returning to traditional mathematics curricula. In a master's degree research paper at the time, interviews with teachers at four schools that had dropped Core-Plus Mathematics suggested that many teachers \\"did not feel that Core-Plus emphasized mastering skills enough\\", while parents \\"felt that it did not prepare students for college\\" and some parents commented that the text was difficult to read. The author of the paper made suggestions for successful adoption of any new materials, including \\"don't rush the adoption process,\\" have \\"continued professional development for all,\\" and \\"school districts need to be proactive regarding parent questions.\\" References External links * Core-Plus Mathematics Project * McGraw-Hill Education * Common Core State Standards Initiative * Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) Category:Mathematics education Category:Education reform Category:Mathematics education reform Category:Western Michigan University ","title":"Core-Plus Mathematics Project"},{"id":"6876687","text":"Marrit Leenstra (born 18 October 1973) is a Dutch professional beach volleyball and indoor volleyball player born in Emmen, Drenthe.

Haber began his career at local side Vancouver Selects, playing four years with the youth team. In 2006, he joined FC Groningen of the Dutch Eredivisie as a youth player, and spent two years the club's U19 side. Haber returned to Canada and signed for the Vancouver Whitecaps in February 2009. Named Rookie of the Year in the USL First Division, he then joined Championship club West Bromwich Albion for an undisclosed fee in January 2010. He was soon loaned out for a month to League One club Exeter City. In April 2010, he rejoined Vancouver Whitecaps on loan to play first-team football. He returned to West Brom ahead of the 2010‚Äì11 season, but was loaned out for a third occasion, this time to Scottish Premier League team St Johnstone. Injury disrupted his time with the club, and his loan spell was ended prematurely in November 2010. In July 2011, Haber joined St Johnstone on a permanent basis, signing on a free transfer. After one year with the SPL side, he joined Stevenage on a two-year deal. Haber spent two seasons at Stevenage, also spending time on loan at Notts County during the 2013‚Äì14 campaign. He then signed for Crewe Alexandra, also of League One, in July 2014, where he spent two seasons. Haber subsequently signed for Scottish Premiership club Dundee in October 2016. He was loaned to Falkirk of the Scottish Championship for the first half of the 2018‚Äì19 season. In January 2019, he signed with Pacific FC of the newly formed Canadian Premier League. Haber has also represented the Canada men's national soccer team at U16, U17, U20, U23, and senior level. Club career Early career Haber began his soccer career by playing for Dunbar SA from 1994 to 2002. He then joined Vancouver Selects in 2002, progressing through the youth ranks, where he helped lead his local team to a national championship in early 2006. He played for the Whitecaps FC Reserves in the Pacific Coast Soccer League in 2006, before travelling to Europe, spending two seasons playing for the U19 team of FC Groningen of the Dutch Eredivisie. During his time at Groningen, he played regularly for the club's youth side, making over 20 appearances, as well as making two further appearances for the reserve team. In the summer of 2008, Haber joined English League One club Leeds United on trial, participating in their pre-season tour to Ireland ahead of the 2008‚Äì09 season. He made his first appearance for Leeds as a second-half substitute in the club's friendly win over Galway United. Haber made his first start, and scored his first goal, in a 3‚Äì2 friendly victory against Bray Wanderers, a game in which Leeds came from two goals down to win. He remained at Leeds on their return to England, with manager Simon Grayson \\"still showing interest\\" in the player. However, Leeds did not offer him a contract. After his last game for Leeds against Barnet, Haber began to search for another club. In August 2008, Haber had an unsuccessful trial with Hartlepool United, where he played in one pre-season friendly away at York City, This was followed by an unsuccessful trial at Rotherham United later that month. In September 2008, Haber spent two weeks on trial at Gillingham of England's League Two. He played in two reserve fixtures against the respective second-strings of Southampton and Crystal Palace, but was not offered a contract Vancouver Whitecaps After unsuccessfully searching for a club in Europe, Haber returned to Canada, and subsequently joined the Vancouver Whitecaps on February 11, 2009. He claimed both the 'Newcomer of the Year' and 'Fan's Favourite' awards after a successful first season with the Whitecaps. The striker was one of seven USL First Division players to appear in every regular season match for his club that year, with Whitecaps goalkeeper Jay Nolly being another player to achieve the same feat during the 2009 season. Haber scored his first goal for the club on April 18, 2009, netting in a 2‚Äì1 away defeat to the Puerto Rico Islanders. The goal earned Haber a spot in the USL-1 Team of the Week for Week Two. In the Nutrilite Canadian Championship, Haber scored the winning goal in the Whitecaps' 2‚Äì0 away win over the Montreal Impact on May 20, scoring just 33 seconds into the match. Haber set the record for the quickest goal scored in a Nutrilite Canadian Championship match. He also scored a consolation goal in a 2‚Äì1 home defeat to the Montreal Impact on June 7. Two weeks later, Haber scored his fourth goal of the season in a 2‚Äì2 away draw with the Cleveland City Stars, scoring the first goal of the match. The striker then earned a place in the Team of the Week for Week 14 after claiming a goal and an assist in a 4‚Äì0 home win over the Minnesota Thunder on July 9. At the end of the same month, he scored the first goal in a 4‚Äì2 home win over the Puerto Rico Islanders, before scoring in a 1‚Äì1 draw at Carolina RailHawks on August 18. Haber then added to his goal tally for the season when he scored the opening goal during a 1‚Äì1 away draw to Minnesota Thunder, as well as netting the equalizer in a 2‚Äì1 home win over Austin Aztex on September 13. Whitecaps finished the season in seventh place, earning a place in the play-offs. Haber scored with his head in both legs of the play-off semi-final series versus Portland Timbers as the Whitecaps advanced to the USL-1 Championship Series final courtesy of a 5‚Äì4 aggregate victory. In the first leg of the USL-1 Championship Series, Haber scored one of his best goals of the season during a 3‚Äì2 home defeat to Canadian rivals Montreal Impact on October 10. After the season had ended, Haber was named as Rookie of the Year in the USL First Division for the 2009 season. He scored 12 goals in 39 appearances during the campaign. West Bromwich Albion In November 2009, Haber spent four days training with Championship club West Bromwich Albion. After impressing during the trial, Haber signed for West Brom for an undisclosed fee, agreeing to personal terms and passing his medical on January 12, 2010. On joining the club, Haber said that \\"The club were pretty straightforward with me from day one. They said that if I was given the opportunity, they would work to improve me as a young player\\". He was given a squad number of 40. =Loan spells= Having made just two reserve appearances for West Brom due to a spate of postponements because of adverse weather conditions, Haber moved to League One club Exeter City on a month-long loan deal on February 18, 2010, to gain first-team experience. He made his debut for Exeter in the club's 1‚Äì0 home defeat to Stockport County two days after signing, coming on as a 60th-minute substitute in the match. He went on to make five appearances during the brief loan agreement, before returning to West Brom in March 2010. After just four months in England, Haber returned to Canada, rejoining Vancouver Whitecaps on April 9, 2010, on a two-month loan deal. West Brom believed the loan move would enable Haber to get more game time ‚Äî \\"Marcus joined us in January but it took around a month for international clearance to be granted and then several reserves fixtures were called off due to the bad weather. This meant he only played a game or two for us during his first two and a half months in England. That's why we've allowed Marcus to rejoin Vancouver, so he can get as much game time as possible\\". During his loan spell back in Vancouver, Haber made 15 appearances in all competitions, scoring twice. St Johnstone Ahead of the 2010‚Äì11 season, Haber was loaned out for a third time, joining Scottish Premier League side St Johnstone on a season-long loan. On signing Haber for the season, St Johnstone manager Derek McInnes stated ‚Äî \\"West Brom have high hopes for him but having stepped up a level into the Premiership they wanted him to go out on loan rather than be kicking his heels at The Hawthorns. He is young, hungry, has real pace and he's keen to learn\\". A day later, he played in Alan Main's testimonial match, against a Manchester United XI. Haber made his competitive debut for the club in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Hearts on August 14, 2010, playing the opening 72 minutes of the match. He scored his first goal for the club five weeks later, on September 21, as he ran onto Alan Maybury's pass to finish neatly as St Johnstone beat Queen of the South 3‚Äì0 in the Scottish League Cup. He quickly doubled his goal tally when he scored in the club's 2‚Äì0 home league victory over Hibernian on October 2, 2010, coming on as a late second-half substitute and doubling St Johnstone's advantage in injury- time. After making 14 appearances, and scoring twice, during the first three months of the season, Haber snapped his anterior cruciate ligament in a 3‚Äì0 home defeat to Kilmarnock on November 6, 2010, turning \\"awkwardly on the slick McDiarmid Park surface\\" in \\"an innocuous incident\\". He returned to West Brom to undergo surgery, with the injury ultimately ruling Haber out for the remainder of the season. Released by West Brom on July 4, 2011, having made no first-team appearances for the club, Haber signed a one-year deal with St Johnstone on July 22. Haber had spent two weeks on trial with the club prior to the move being made permanent. He made his first appearance of the 2011‚Äì12 campaign in the club's first match of the season, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 0‚Äì0 away draw against Aberdeen. After appearing predominantly as a substitute during the early months of the season, Haber scored his first goal in a 3‚Äì1 victory over Hibernian in November 2011, netting with a headed goal just before half-time. He went on to score one further goal during the season, scoring a late consolation strike as St Johnstone were beaten 2‚Äì1 at home to Aberdeen on December 13, 2011. During the season, Haber made 34 appearances in all competitions, scoring two goals, as St Johnstone finished the season in sixth position. Stevenage In July 2012, Haber signed for League One club Stevenage on a free transfer, and on a two-year contract. He made his debut in the club's first game of the 2012‚Äì13 season, a 3‚Äì1 home victory over AFC Wimbledon in the League Cup on August 14, 2012, assisting two goals in the game. Haber scored his first goal for the club in a televised 2‚Äì1 win against Coventry City at the Ricoh Arena, coming on as a second-half substitute and scoring the winning goal with a header fifteen minutes from time. He scored his second goal of the campaign in Stevenage's 2‚Äì2 home draw with Bury, heading in Luke Freeman's corner to draw Stevenage level. Haber then had to wait three months for his next goal, finishing from close range after his initial header had hit the post in a 2‚Äì0 away victory against Hartlepool United on December 8, 2012. He scored in another away win a month later, finishing calmly as Stevenage came from a goal down to beat Crewe Alexandra. Haber went on to score twice in February 2013, both of which were headed goals, in games against Notts County and Carlisle United respectively. Haber's seventh goal of the season came in Stevenage's important 1‚Äì0 win over Brentford on March 5, 2013, with the goal ensuring Stevenage ended a six-game losing streak. It proved to be Haber's last goal of the campaign, as he made 46 appearances in all competitions during his first season with the club. In May 2013, Haber was one of three players placed on the transfer list, with the player entering the final year of his contract at Stevenage. New manager Graham Westley felt Haber would not play regularly the following season, and therefore it was \\"better for all\\" that he \\"move on to develop his career\\". In September 2013, Haber joined divisional rivals Notts County on a three-month emergency loan deal. Crewe Alexandra He signed for Crewe Alexandra on July 31, 2014. After playing 82 games in all competitions and scoring 18 goals, he was released in May 2016. Dundee In October 2016, Haber went on trial with Dundee, and on October 24, he signed a deal to the end of the season. He made his debut for the club on October 26, 2016, in a 2‚Äì0 home defeat to Partick Thistle and scored his first goal for the club in a 2‚Äì0 home win against Motherwell on November 5, 2016. On January 19, 2017, Haber signed a new two-year contract. Haber was loaned to Scottish Championship club Falkirk in July 2018. Haber's loan would be cut short by Falkirk, and Haber would leave Dundee by mutual consent in January 2019. Pacific FC Haber signed with Canadian Premier League club Pacific FC on January 9, 2019. On April 29, 2019 he made his debut in the club's inaugural match. On May 18, 2019 he scored his first goal for Pacific in a 2‚Äì2 draw with York 9 FC. Cavalry FC In July 2020, Haber signed with Cavalry FC. He made his debut for Cavalry on August 13 in the 2020 season opener against Forge FC. He scored his first goal for his new club in the next game, netting the opener against Valour FC in an eventual 2‚Äì0 victory on August 15. International career Haber has represented Canada from the U15 through to the U23 Olympic levels. He appeared in all three games in the 2007 FIFA U20 World Cup, although he was played in an unfamiliar role as a centre-back. In March 2008, Haber made three Olympic qualification appearances in Canada's unsuccessful campaign to reach the 2008 Men's Olympic Football Tournament in Beijing. He was a member of Canada's U20 squad that did not qualify for the 2009 FIFA U20 World Cup in Egypt, finishing third in their group. As a result, Canada did not qualify for the Championship round. In March 2012, Haber was once again part of the U23 squad that would attempt to qualify for the Summer Olympics later that year. Canada qualified from the group stage, finishing in second place with five points, qualifying at the expense of the USA U23 side after securing a surprise 2‚Äì0 victory over them. Haber played in two out of the three group matches. They lost in the semi-final stage to the eventual gold medal side, going down 3‚Äì1 to their Mexican counterparts, with Haber scoring Canada's solitary goal to briefly restore parity in the match. Haber made his debut for the senior side in a 2‚Äì2 friendly against Ukraine at the Valeriy Lobanovskyi Dynamo Stadium on October 8, 2010, coming on as a 73rd-minute substitute for Olivier Occ√©an. In August 2011, he was called up for Canada's two 2014 World Cup qualifiers the following month. He appeared as a late substitute in Canada's 4‚Äì1 victory over Saint Lucia on September 3, 2011, although he was an unused substitute four days later as Canada defeated Puerto Rico 3‚Äì0, in-turn securing qualification to the third round. Haber earned his third senior cap in February 2012, when he replaced Julian de Guzman in the 82nd minute as Canada lost 3‚Äì1 in a friendly match against Armenia in Limassol. In March 2013, he was named in the 21-man senior squad for friendly fixtures against Japan and Belarus, with both games taking place in Doha, Qatar. Haber made his first start for Canada in the match against Japan on March 22, a 2‚Äì1 defeat, with Haber scoring his first senior goal courtesy of a second-half header from Will Johnson's corner, briefly restoring parity in the match. He also came on as a second-half substitute in Canada's 2‚Äì0 loss to Belarus just three days later, earning his fifth senior cap in the process. In June 2013, Haber was listed for Colin Miller's Canada squad in the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Personal life Born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, Haber is the oldest child of David and Carla Haber. He has a brother and a sister. He not only excelled in soccer, but also baseball and basketball, and attended Lord Kitchener Elementary and Lord Byng Secondary schools. Haber enjoys listening to, and producing, hip hop music in his spare time. The footballer he most enjoyed watching in his prime was Thierry Henry.

The text deals with the Geulah (Era of eschatology and salvation) and describes its signs vis-a-vis an evaluation of a proposed 999 footsteps of the Moshiach's arrival. The Vilna Gaon believed the number 999 to be intrinsically connected to the idea of Moshiach ben Yosef, he also felt that this number is alluded to in the gematria of his own name.Kol HaTor; Notes on Chapter 3 Holy Hints on the Beginning of the Redemption Publication history Kol HaTor was first published in Hebrew in 1968 by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Kasher, to whom the book was passed down over the generations. According to Rabbi Pinchas Winston, > \\"The original text of Kol HaTor was kept in the manuscript by the Rivlin > family, descendants of Rabbi Hillel Rivlin, for over 200 years.

Impact and controversy The text has become popularized amongst the adherents of Religious Zionism who perceive parallels between current and recent historical events and those forecast in the book. They maintain that we are currently in the years right prior to the full Redemption and that the indicators established in Kol HaTor are currently being manifested. However, some anti-Zionists have disputed the authenticity of Kol HaTor, particularly Rabbi Moshe Shternbuch, who is a direct descendant of the Vilna Gaon and is the rabbi of the GRA Synagogue in Jerusalem, which primarily follows the traditions taught and espoused by the Vilna Gaon. Rabbi Shternbuch argues against the work on theological grounds as well as textual grounds by drawing attention to certain words in the text that only a speaker of modern Hebrew would utilize. He first wrote against Kol HaTor in a ten page pamphlet in the year following its publication in 1968 and later expanded upon the matter in his work Teshuvos VeHanhagos.Teshuvos VeHanhagos Part 4, Chapter 328.

The lake has a length of 2,065 mt (6,884 feet) and a width of 1,701 mt (5,670 feet). Its water is shallow and the aquatic flora, like algae, rushes and another species like the myriophyllum aquaticum, commonly known in Argentina as gambarussa, overpopulates the muddy bottom. Woods of eucalyptus and pines surround the adjacent area, as well as some aboriginal shrub, like the colletia paradoxa, locally known as curro. The area also hosts the southernmost population of tala and some specimenes of sambucus. The place had been open to the public since 1946. Sport fishing is the main recreational activity, and there is a wharf for row boats in a small island linked to land by a causeway. Watercraft with internal combustion power are not permitted on the lake. Laguna de los Padres also hosted rowing competitions during the 1995 Pan American Games and 2006 South American Games. Near the main entrance there is a reconstruction of the ancient Jesuit mission of Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar, founded in 1746 and abandoned five years later under pressure from the Leuvuches, a nomadic Tehuelche tribe led by chieftain Cangapol.

Created in 1997, it was a frequently cited website in the so-called Math wars, and was actively updated until 2003. The website went offline sometime in late 2012 or early 2013 but has been preserved on the Internet Archive.  History  Although Mathematically Correct had a national scope, much of its focus was on advocating against mathematics curricula prevalent in California in the mid-1990s. When California reversed course and adopted more traditional mathematics texts (2001 - 2002), Mathematically Correct changed its focus to reviewing the new text books. Convinced that the choices were adequate, the website went largely dormant. Mathematically Correct maintained a large section of critical articles and reviews for a number of math programs. Most of the program opposed by Mathematically Correct had been developed from research projects funded by the National Science Foundation. Most of these programs also claimed to have been based on the 1989 Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics published by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. Mathematically Correct's main point of contention was that, in reform textbooks, traditional methods and concepts have been omitted or replaced by new terminology and procedures. As a result, in the case of the high-school program Core-Plus Mathematics Project, for example, some reports suggest that students may be unprepared for college level courses upon completion of the program. Other programs given poor ratings include programs aimed at elementary school students, such as Dale Seymour Publications (TERC) Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space and Everyday Learning Everyday Mathematics.

On 13 July 1260, the Samogitians soundly defeated the joint forces of the Teutonic Knights from Prussia and Livonian Order from Livonia. Some 150 knights were killed, including Livonian Master Burchard von Hornhausen and Prussian Land Marshal Henrik Botel. It was by far the largest defeat of the knights in the 13th century: in the second-largest, the Battle of Aizkraukle, 71 knights were killed. The battle inspired the Great Prussian Uprising (ended in 1274) and the rebellions of the Semigallians (surrendered in 1290), the Couronians (surrendered in 1267), and the Oeselians (surrendered in 1261). The battle undid two decades of Livonian conquests and it took some thirty years for the Livonian Order to restore its control. Background The Livonian Order had been fighting the Samogitians since 1253, when Mindaugas was crowned as King of Lithuania and transferred parts of Samogitia to the order. The Samogitians did not recognize the transfer and fought for their independence. For the knights, Samogitia was a strategically important region as it physically separated their Prussian and Livonian branches. After the Samogitians killed 12 knights in the Battle of Memel, near the newly built Memel Castle (Klaipƒóda) in 1257, a two-year truce was concluded. Once the truce expired, the Samogitians invaded Courland and defeated the knights in the Battle of Skuodas in 1259. The success encouraged the Semigallians to rebel. The knights attempted to strengthen their strategic position and attacked Tƒìrvete (Terwerten) hoping to turn the Semigallian outpost into a Teutonic castle. When the attack failed, they built a fortress in nearby Dobele (Doblen) and Georgenburg (possibly present-day Jurbarkas) in Samogitia.Gudaviƒçius, Edvardas. Mindaugas, p. 275 The Semigallians attacked Dobele, but, due to poor siege tactics, suffered heavy casualties. The Samogitians did not attack Georgenburg directly but built a fortress nearby, cutting off the castle from its supplies and continuously harassing the garrison.Gudaviƒçius, Edvardas. Mindaugas, pp. 275‚Äì276 Battle Livonian Grand Master Burchard von Hornhausen organized a large army for a campaign against the Samogitians. On 25 January 1260, the knights obtained a papal bull blessing the crusade from Pope Alexander IV and concluded a peace treaty with Siemowit I of Masovia.Gudaviƒçius, Edvardas. Mindaugas, p. 276 When the armies of the Prussian and Livonian orders and their allies met in Memel Castle, they planned to reinforce the besieged Georgenburg. However, they learned that a large Samogitian force was raiding Courland, and the knights decided to march towards present-day Latvia to stop the Samogitians. The enemies met on the southern shore of Durbe Lake. The knights were plagued by internal disagreements. For example, Danes from Estonia refused to dismount from their heavy horses, which were not well-suited for battle in swampy terrain.Gudaviƒçius, Edvardas. Mindaugas, p. 278 When the battle started, local Curonians abandoned the knights because the knights did not agree to free any captured Curonians from the Samogitian camp. Peter von Dusburg even alleged that the Curonians attacked the knights from the rear. The Estonians and other local people soon fled the battle. After this loss the knights were surrounded and suffered heavy losses. Some 150 knights perished along with hundreds of secular knights and low-ranking soldiers. Though the battle is described in the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle in detail, no contemporary sources mention who was the leader of the Samogitians. Only Simon Grunau, in his chronicle written ca. 1517‚Äì1526, mentioned that it was Treniota. In 1982, historian Edvardas Gudaviƒçius published a study arguing that Treniota was not a Samogitian and could not have commanded a Samogitian army. Inga Baranauskienƒó argued that the battle was led by Alminas, a Samogitian elder elected before 1256. Aftermath Numerous rebellions against the Teutonic Order across all Baltic lands followed, including the Great Prussian Uprising, which lasted from 1260 to 1274. Zemgale rebelled for 30 years while Courland surrendered in 1267. The Curonians, together with the Samogitians, attacked Teutonic castles west of the Venta River. On 3 February 1261, on their way back, the pagans again defeated the knights near LielvƒÅrde (Lennenwarden), killing 10. Oeselian rebellion was suppressed in 1261. These battles undid some 20 years of Livonian conquest and it took some thirty years for the Livonian Order to restore its control. In the aftermath of the defeat, Duke Treniota is alleged to have convinced his uncle Mindaugas, King of Lithuania, to deny his Christianity and break the peace with the Teutonic Order. Treniota organized military campaigns into Livonia and earned support from the Lithuanians. In 1263, Treniota assassinated Mindaugas and usurped the Lithuanian throne, and the nation reverted to paganism. Ensuing instability prevented the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from taking full advantage of the weakened orders, however, while the orders were occupied reconquering rebelling territories and did not pose a danger to Lithuania until the 1280‚Äì1285. In this sense, the battle bought time for the new Lithuanian state to mature, strengthen, and expand before facing a full-scale crusade.

It is roughly bounded by Towngate Street, Bosque Bello Cemetery, Nassau, Marine, and Ladies Streets. On January 29, 1990, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as a historic site. Lying north of the Fernandina Beach Historic District, it is accessible from North 14th Street. Prior to the arrival of Europeans on what is now Amelia Island, the Old Town site was home to Native Americans. The French, English, and Spanish all maintained a presence on Amelia Island at various times during the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, but the Spanish established Fernandina. Old Town, the original location of the town of Fernandina, has the distinction of being the last Spanish city platted in the Western Hemisphere, in 1811. The plat is based on the 1573 Law of the Indies, a document utilized by the Spanish to organize new towns established during their explorations. The area within Old Town known as Plaza San Carlos was the plaza ground in front of the Spanish Fort San Carlos, which is no longer in existence. Today the Plaza San Carlos is maintained by the State of Florida as part of the State Park System. The plaza offers a space for nature study and picnicking. David Levy Yulee, one of the first United States senators from Florida, established the first cross-state railroad running from Fernandina Beach to Cedar Key, which opened on March 1, 1861. When Yulee established the railroad, he platted \\"new\\" Fernandina, shifting the town of Fernandina from Old Town to the present location along Centre Street. As a result of this shift, Old Town has become primarily a residential neighborhood. The field work and scholarship of archeologists and historians in the last forty years has advanced understanding of the area's Native American history after European contact. The human occupation of present-day Old Town began around three thousand years ago, and some of the most colorful episodes of Florida history occurred here. Local government has come to realize the singular place Old Town has in telling the story of Fernandina's heritage, and in 1989 the city of Fernandina Beach passed a historic preservation ordinance to protect the district by establishing local boundaries. Old Town has design guidelines for rehabilitation and construction projects, reviewed by the city's Historic District Council. The Old Town preservation and development guidelines focus on lot orientation, an integral part of the process of preserving the 1811 Spanish plan; building aesthetics are also taken into account. The Old Town Historic District was last surveyed as part of the city's 1985 Historic Resources survey. Old Town celebrated the 200th anniversary of its founding on April 2, 2011. History Amelia River, viewed from old town of Fernandina site, looking toward St. Marys, Georgia Native American campsite to British garrison The original town of Fernandina was established on a bluff over the Amelia River at the northwest end of Amelia Island in northernmost Florida on the east coast of the United States. Native Americans had camped on this land above the Amelia River from 2000‚Äì1000 BC. The St. Johns People dwelt here from as early as 1000 B.C. and their Timucua descendants encamped in the same area. The naturally deep and protected harbor was known to the early European explorers of Florida. The island was called Napoyca by the Timucua and was associated with the name \\"Santa Mar√≠a\\" since the early First Spanish Period (1500‚Äì1763).Thomas 1987, p.165. Spanish Franciscan friars established the fortified mission compound of Santa Mar√≠a de Sena by 1602 near this place, which was only a league (3 miles) away from the mission of San Pedro de Mocama on present-day Cumberland Island. A Spanish sentinel house was built here in 1696. In later colonial times the site gained military importance because of its deep harbor and its strategic location near the northern boundary of Spanish Florida. During his invasion of north Florida, 1736‚Äì1742, the governor of the British colony of Georgia, James Oglethorpe, stationed a military guard of Scottish Highlanders on the site and named the island after Princess Amelia, the daughter of King George II of Great Britain. \\"New Settlement\\" Plan of Amelia Island. 1770 (1777) Oglethorpe withdrew his troops in 1742, and the area became a buffer zone between the English and Spanish colonies until the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1763, when Spain traded Florida to Great Britain for control of Havana, Cuba. During the early period of British rule, the island was known as Egmont Isle, after Lord Egmont who had a 10,000 acre estate there, almost the entire island. The so-called \\"New Settlement\\" (present-day Old Town), on the south side of the mouth of Egan's Creek adjoining the Amelia River, was presumably its headquarters. A map of the new settlement shown in charts drawn by Capt. John Fuller and mapped by cartographer Thomas Jefferys in 1770 depicts houses and streets laid out from \\"Anderson's Creek\\" (present-day Egan's Creek) south toward Morriss Bluff. Egmont had only recently begun his development of the island in 1770 when Gerard de Brahm prepared his map, the \\"Plan of Amelia, Now Egmont Island\\", which depicted most of the planned development at the north end. Egmont died in December 1770, whereupon his widow, Lady Egmont, assumed control of his vast Florida estates. She persisted in development of the plantation and made Stephen Egan her agent to manage it. He was able to grow profitable indigo crops there until it was destroyed by rebel troops from Georgia in 1776.Perceval 1812 In the late 1770s and early 1780s, British loyalists fleeing Charleston and Savannah hastily erected new buildings at the settlement, calling their impromptu town Hillsborough. When Spain regained possession of Florida in 1783, the Amelia harbor served as an embarkation point for loyalists abandoning the colony who tore down the buildings and took the lumber with them. In June 1785, former British governor Patrick Tonyn moved his command to Hillsborough town, from whence he sailed to England later that year. After the British evacuation, Mary Mattair, her children, and a farmhand were the sole occupants left on Amelia island. She had received a grant from Governor Tonyn of the property on the bluff overlooking the Amelia River. Following the exchange of flags in 1784, the Spanish Crown allowed Mattair to remain on the island. In trade for the earlier British grant, the Spanish authorities awarded her 150 acres within the present-day city limits of Fernandina Beach. The site of Mattair's initial grant is today's Old Town Fernandina. In December 1793, Mary Mattair's daughter Maria married Domingo Fernandez. Fernandez had arrived in St. Augustine from Galicia, Spain about 1786. He worked for the Spanish government as captain of a gunboat and a harbor pilot at Amelia Island until 1800, when he retired to become a full- time planter. In June 1795, American rebel marauders led by Richard Lang attacked the Spanish garrison on Amelia Island. Colonel Charles Howard, an officer in the Spanish military, discovered that the rebels had built a battery and were flying the French flag. On August 2, he raised a sizable Spanish force, sailed up Sisters Creek and the Nassau River, and attacked them. The rebels fled across the St. Marys to Georgia. The passage of the U.S. Embargo Act of 1807, which closed all United States ports to trade with Europe, and the abolition of the American slave trade, made the town a haven for smuggling slaves, liquor and foreign luxury goods. Situated on a peninsula, it was defended by two blockhouses and a detachment of soldiers surrounding the settlement. Fernandina Township platted according to the Laws of the Indies Plat of Fernandina from 1811 until 1821 On January 1, 1811, the town of Fernandina, which was about a mile from the present city, was named in honor of King Ferdinand VII of Spain by the governor of the Spanish province of East Florida, Enrique White. On May 10, 1811, White's successor and acting governor at the time, Juan Jos√© Estrada, instructed the newly appointed Surveyor General, George J. F. Clarke, to plat the township in accordance with the 1542 Spanish Laws of the Indies (Leyes de Indias). These laws regulated how the site for a Spanish settlement should be selected, and how the town should be laid out in classical grid form. Places were designated for the fort, the parade ground, the church, and the cemetery. A plaza, originally called Plaza de la Constitution, was set close to the river, one side facing westward to the parade grounds. Fernandina was the last town platted under the Laws of the Indies in the Western Hemisphere and was intended as a bulwark against U.S. territorial expansion. In the following years it was captured and recaptured by a succession of renegades and privateers. Meanwhile, saloons and bordellos proliferated in the booming new township. Patriots' War Because it was a center for smuggling and represented a threat to trade of the United States, Fernandina was invaded and seized by forces under the command of General George Mathews in 1812 with the clandestine approval of President James Madison. Mathews and Colonel John McKee were commissioned as secret agents to incite a revolution in Spanish East Florida.Cusick 2007, p. 2 A group of Americans calling themselves the \\"Patriots of Amelia Island\\" had banded together to drive out the Spanish and reported to General Mathews, who moved into a house at St. Marys, Georgia, just nine miles across Cumberland Sound. Most of the Patriots' force consisted of Georgia militiamen, and wood-choppers and boatmen from the neighborhood of St. Marys.Williams 1837, p.193 They were supported by slave-holding planters who wanted to stop raiding parties of Seminole Indians from the Alachua region and feared the presence of armed free black militias in Spanish Florida.Cusick 2003, p.49Williams 1837, p.194 East Florida Patriot Flag By March 5, Patriot leader and wealthy Florida planter John Houstoun McIntosh claimed that the Patriots had successfully subjugated the area between the St. Marys and the St. Johns Rivers, and were planning next to take Amelia Island.Writers 1940, p. 25 On March 16, nine American gunboats under the command of Commodore Hugh Campbell formed a line in the harbor and aimed their guns at the town.Congressional edition 1858, p. 45 General Mathews, still ensconced at Point Peter on the St. Marys in Georgia, ordered Colonel Lodowick Ashley to send a flag to Justo Lopez, commandant of the fort and Amelia Island, and demand his surrender. Lopez acknowledged the superior force and surrendered the port and the town. On March 17 John H. McIntosh, George J. F. Clarke, Justo Lopez, and others signed the articles of capitulation; the Patriots then raised their own standard. The next day, a detachment of 250 regular United States troops were brought over from Point Peter, and the newly constituted Patriot government surrendered the town to General Matthews, who had the stars and stripes of the U.S. flag raised immediately.Congressional edition 1858, p. 45 The Patriots had held Fernandina for only twenty-four hours before turning authority over to the U.S. military. General Mathews and President Madison had conceived a plan to annex East Florida to the United States, but Congress became alarmed at the possibility of being drawn into war with Spain, and the effort fell apart when Secretary of State James Monroe was forced to relieve Matthews of his commission. Negotiations began for the withdrawal of U.S. troops early in 1813. On May 6, the army lowered the flag at Fernandina and crossed the St. Marys River to Georgia with the remaining troops. Spain took possession of the redoubt and regained control of the island. The Spanish completed construction of the new Fort San Carlos to guard the port side of Fernandina in 1816. Fort San Carlos was built to protect the strategic harbor of the Amelia River and Spanish interests in northern Florida. The fort was made of wood and earthworks and was armed with eight or ten guns. The town contained about six hundred inhabitants, and its population was rapidly increasing. The former Indian campsite had become the fort's parade grounds fronting Estrada Street, which still exists‚Äîthe layout of the original town has been preserved to this day. Gregor MacGregor and the Republic of the Floridas General Gregor MacGregor Fernandina became increasingly vulnerable to foreign depredations as Spain's American empire disintegrated. A Scottish military adventurer and mercenary, Gregor MacGregor, claimed to be commissioned by representatives of the revolting South American countries to liberate Florida from Spanish rule. Financed by American backers, he led an army of only 150 men including recruits from Charleston and Savannah, some War of 1812 veterans, and 55 musketeers in an assault on Fort San Carlos. Through spies within the Spanish garrison, MacGregor had learned that the force there consisted of only 55 regulars and 50 militia men. He spread rumors in the town which eventually reached the ear of the garrison commander that an army of more than 1,000 men was about to attack. On June 29, 1817, he advanced on the fort, deploying his men in small groups coming from various directions to give the impression of a larger force.Owsley and Smith 1997, p.127 The commander, Francisco Morales, struck the Spanish flag and fled.Writers 1940, p.27 MacGregor raised his flag, the \\"Green Cross of Florida\\", a green cross on a white ground, over the fort and proclaimed the \\"Republic of the Floridas\\". Now in possession of the town, and seeing the need to make the appearance of a legitimate government, MacGregor quickly formed a committee to draft a constitution, and appointed Ruggles Hubbard, the former high sheriff of New York City, as unofficial civil governor, and Jared Irwin, an adventurer and former Pennsylvania Congressman, as his treasurer. MacGregor then opened a post office, ordered a printing press to publish a newspaper, and issued currency to pay his troops and to settle government debts.Owsley and Smith 1997, p.128 Expecting reinforcements for a raid against the Castillo de San Marcos in St. Augustine, MacGregor intended to subdue all of Spanish East Florida.Great Britain 1837, p.763 His plan was doomed to fail, however, as President James Monroe was in sensitive negotiations with Spain to acquire all of Florida.Niles 1818, p.303 Green Cross of Florida Flag Soon MacGregor's reserves were depleted, and the Republic needed revenue. He commissioned privateers to seize Spanish shipsGreat Britain 1837, p.769 and set up an admiralty courtAdams 1875, p. 75Niles 1818, p.339 which levied a customs duty on their sales.Miller 1819, p.89 They began selling captured prizes and their cargoes, which often included slaves. When about August 28 fellow conspirator Ruggles Hubbard sailed into the harbor aboard his own brig Morgiana, flying the flag of Buenos Ayres, but without the needed men, guns, and money, MacGregor announced his departure. On September 4, faced with the threat of a Spanish reprisal, and still lacking money and adequate reinforcements, he abandoned his plans to conquer Florida and departed Fernandina with most of his officers, leaving a small detachment of men at Fort San Carlos to defend the island. After his withdrawal, these and a force of American irregulars organized by Hubbard and Irwin repelled the Spanish attempt to reassert authority. Battle of Amelia Island On September 13 the Battle of Amelia Island commenced when the Spaniards erected a battery of four brass cannons on McLure's Hill east of the fort. With about 300 men, supported by two gunboats, they shelled Fernandina being held by Jared Irwin. His \\"Republic of Florida\\" forces included ninety-four men, the privateer ships Morgiana and St. Joseph, and the armed schooner Jupiter. Spanish gunboats began firing at 3:30 pm and the battery on the hill joined the cannonade. The guns of Fort San Carlos, on the river bluff northwest of the hill, and those of the St. Joseph defended Amelia Island. Cannonballs killed two and wounded other Spanish troops clustered below. Firing continued until dark. The Spanish commander, convinced he could not capture the island, then withdrew his forces.Owsley and Smith 1997, p.134 French corsair Louis Aury Proclamation for general election of legislature of the Republic of the Floridas, 1817 Before he left Florida, MacGregor had met with the French privateer, Louis Aury, a previous acquaintance from political intrigues in South America who had served with him in Simon Bol√≠var's army in New Granada.Adams 1875, p.75 As MacGregor was going out of the harbor of Fernandina on the privateer Freeman Johnson's vessel, Aury was coming in on his flagship, Mexican Congress. Visits were exchanged, and Aury entertained the Scotsman aboard his schooner,Foreign and Commonwealth Office 1837, p. 771 anchored outside the bar of the inlet. Aury was accompanied by two other privateering ships and held prizes valued at $60,000.Miller 1819, p.95 Thus briefed on the state of affairs in Fernandina, he sailed into the port on September 17, 1817, with a crew of 300 American recruits and Haitian ex-slaves, free blacks, and mulattoes known as \\"Aury's blacks\\". His principal lieutenant was Joseph Savary, a mulatto refugee from the Haitian revolution and veteran of the defense of New Orleans in 1815.Owsley and Smith 1997, p.138 Mexican insurgents' flag flown by privateer Louis Aury Aury marched to Hubbard's quarters with a body of armed men and demanded concessions from Hubbard and Irwin, who were short of troops and bereft of funds. They appealed for financial aid, but Aury refused, unless he have supreme command of both civil and military government. When Hubbard and Irwin protested his terms, Aury threatened to leave the island. Realizing they had nothing to gain by opposing him, a compromise was reached and they made an alliance with the Frenchman:Niles 1818, p.302 Aury would be commander-in-chief of military and naval forces, Irwin his adjutant general, and Hubbard the civil governor of Amelia.Owsley and Smith 1997, p.138. The flag of the revolutionary republic of Mexico, not yet independent, was raised over Fort San Carlos. Thus Amelia Island was dubiously annexed to Mexico on September 21, 1817.State papers, 1819, p.401 Adams-Onis Treaty transfers Florida to the United States right The new government of Fernandina was short-lived. According to Lloyd's of London, Aury's commissioned privateers captured more than $500,000 worth of Spanish goods in two months. They preyed on Spanish vessels carrying slaves, most of whom were smuggled into Georgia after being captured.Owsley and Smith 1997, p.139 These activities threatened the negotiations concerning the cession of Florida and in response President Monroe sent forces to retake Amelia on October 31. After a contentious exchange of communications with representatives of the president,Niles 1818, p.347-352 Aury realized his position was untenable and surrendered the island to Commodore J.D. Henley and Major James Bankhead on December 23, 1817.British and Foreign State Papers 1837, p.773 Aury remained over two months as an unwelcome guest; Bankhead occupied Fernandina and held it \\"in trust\\" for Spain.Congressional edition 1818, p.7 [47] Although angered by U.S. interference at Fort San Carlos, Spain did cede Florida in 1821. The proclamation of the Adams-Onis Treaty on February 22, 1821, two years after its signing, officially transferred East Florida and what remained of West Florida to the United States. The U.S. Army made little use of the fort and soon abandoned it. Town of Fernandina moves 1857 U.S. Coast Survey Map or Chart of St. Marys River and Fernandina Harbor, Florida.1857 In 1853 the town of Fernandina moved about a mile further south when David Levy Yulee chartered his Florida Railroad line, the first cross-state railroad in Florida. Fernandina was to be the eastern terminus, but Yulee declared the rails could not cross the salt-marsh to Old Town; in fact, the land area of Old Town was insufficient to support Yulee's vision of building the 'Manhattan of the South'. His company began construction in 1855, and the original site of Fernandina, the one-time smugglers' den and freebooter haven, lapsed into quiet obscurity. The original Spanish town plan and regular street grid, with many of the Spanish street names, remain. During the American Civil War, the local militia of the Confederate Army occupied Fort San Carlos. Archaeologists estimate that two-thirds of the area formerly occupied by Fort San Carlos has disappeared through erosion by the Amelia River. Traces of earthworks and the former parade grounds can be found along Estrada Street.De Quesada, p.138.

Early years Patrick Moran was born in Sydney and was the only child of Herbert Michael Moran (b. 1885 in Sydney, d. 1945 in Cambridge UK), a prominent surgeon and captain of the first Wallabies, and Eva Mann (b. 1887 in Sydney, d. 1977 in Sydney). Patrick did have five other siblings, but they all died at or shortly after birth. He completed his high school studies in Bathurst, in three and a half years instead of the normal five-year course. At age 16, in 1934, he commenced study at the University of Sydney where he studied chemistry, maths and physics, graduating with first class honours in mathematics in 1937. Following graduation he went to study at Cambridge University from 1937 to 1939, his supervisors noted that he was not a good mathematician and the outbreak of World War II interrupted his studies. He graduated with an MA (by proxy) from St John's College, Cambridge, on 22 January 1943 and continued his studies there from 1945 to 1946. He was admitted to Balliol College, Oxford University, on 3 December 1946. He was awarded an MA, from Oxford University, by incorporation in 1947. Career During the war Moran worked in rocket development in the Ministry of Supply and later at the External Ballistics Laboratory in Cambridge. In late 1943 he joined the Australian Scientific Liaison Office (ASLO), run by the CSIRO. He worked on applied physics including vision, camouflage, army signals, quality control, road research, infra-red detection, metrology, UHF radio propagation, general radar, bomb-fragmentation, rockets, ASDICs and on operational research. He also wrote some papers on the Hausdorff measure during the War. After the war, Moran returned to Cambridge where he was supervised by Frank Smithies and worked unsuccessfully on determining the nature of the set of points of divergence of Fourier integrals of functions in the class Lp, when 1 < p < 2\\\\. He gave up on this project and was employed as a senior research officer at the Institute of Statistics at Oxford University. He also gave lecture courses. Patrick Moran was appointed university lecturer in mathematics in 1951, at Oxford, without stipend, for as long as he held the post of senior research officer in the Institute of Statistics. Moran freely admitted he had difficulty with simple arithmetic and wrote that, \\"Arithmetic I could not do\\".. Originally published in Historical Records of Australian Science, vol.9, no.1, 1991. Also published in Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society of London, 1991. He married in 1946 after his appointment; he and his wife Jean Mavis Frame had three children, Louise, Michael and Hugh. At Oxford Moran wrote several papers on the nonlinear breeding cycle of the Canadian lynx. He was made a lecturer at Oxford in 1951 but left the university later that year for Australia. He never acquired a PhD, \\"a fact he would recall with some pride in later life\\" recalls Hall. On 1 January 1951, Moran was appointed foundation professor of statistics in the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University in Canberra . He worked on the stochastic study of dam theory, and on population genetics, publishing his first paper \\"Random processes in genetics\\" in the Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1958 and culminating in his 1962 book The Statistical Processes of Evolutionary Theory. He also worked on geometric probability. In 1963, he was awarded the Thomas Ranken Lyle Medal by the Australian Academy of Science.Thomas Ranken Lyle Medal , Australian Academy of Science, retrieved 2010-06-06. He retired from ANU at the end of 1982; he stayed on as Emeritus Professor and worked on statistical methods in particular epidemiological methods and their application to psychiatry. He was awarded an honorary ScD degree from Cambridge, on 29 October 1963, and a DSc from Sydney. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1975. Moran died after a stroke in 1988. The P.A.P Moran Building (Building 26B) at A.N.U. was named in his honour. It houses offices of the Mathematical Sciences Institute, tutorial rooms and the Research School of Economics. The Moran Medal, created in his honour, is awarded by the Australian Academy of Science every two years for distinguished work in statistics by an Australian statistician.

SPARQL has emerged as the standard RDF query language, and in 2008 became a W3C recommendation.  Query language properties  Properties relevant to RDF query language design include support for the RDF format: * Support for RDF data, which is a collection of triples that form the RDF graph * Support for RDF semantics and inference that allows for entailment, the reasoning about the meaning of RDF graphs * Support for schema data types, such as XML schema and for desirable language features: * Expressiveness: the power of query expression that may be constructed * Closure: data operations on an RDF graph should result in another RDF graph * Orthogonality: data operations are independent of the context in which they are used * Safety: every expression returns a finite set of results.  Query language families  RDF query languages can be grouped into language families, each family comprising a set of closely related languages. The SPARQL family of languages includes SquishQL, RDQL, SPARQL, and TriQL. These languages treat RDF data stores as triple stores that do not necessarily have ontology or schema information associated with them. Members of the SPARQL family are considered relational query languages because they have relational or pattern-based operations. SquishQL was a language constructed to be easy to use and similar in structure to SQL. RDQL, an acronym for RDF Data Query Language, was a further development of SquishQL. RDQL was intended to be a simple low level RDF language and was at one point a candidate for W3C standardization. SPARQL is an extension of RDQL that supports extraction of RDF subgraphs. In 2008, SPARQL 1.0 became a W3C recommendation and SPARQL 1.1 became a W3C recommendation in 2013. The RQL family of languages includes RQL, SeRQL, and eRQL. These languages support querying of both data and schema. RQL, an acronym for RDF Query Language, is known for using types defined in RDF schemas (RDFS) to query the schema class hierarchy and to support data querying by type. RQL is considered more expressive than the SPARQL family of languages, but has been criticized for too many features and unusual syntactic constructs. SeRQL and eRQL were developed as simplified alternatives to RQL. There is a family of RDF query languages inspired by XML query technology. XQuery for RDF uses the XML query language XQuery to query RDF data by serializing RDF into an XML format and then using XQuery on the result; this has been called the \\"syntactic web approach\\". TreeHugger and RDF Twig use XSLT to query RDF data. Versa by 4Suite is a query language that drew inspiration from XPath. There exist RDF query languages based on other principles. Metalog combines querying with reasoning and has an English like syntax. Algae is a query language developed by the W3C that adds reactive rules, also called actions, that determine for instance whether an Algae expression is a data query or a data update. Other examples of RDF Query languages include RDFDBQL.  Example  select ?uri,?name, ?lat, ?lon from where (?city, , ?name), (?city, ,?uri), (?city, , ?lat), (?city, , ?lon) using rdfs FOR , pos FOR , doilair FOR , vcard FOR  Related languages  Other languages which can query RDF data include: * DQL, XML-based, queries and results expressed in DAML+OIL * XUL has a template element in which to declare rules for matching data in RDF. XUL uses RDF extensively for databinding. * Adenine (programming language written in RDF). XQuery, or XML Query, is a standard query language for XML documents. Graph query languages, such as Cypher Query Language, GraphQL, and Gremlin, are designed to query graph databases, of which RDF data stores are an example. The Topic Map Query Language (TMQL) is a query language for topic maps, a data representation similar to but more general than RDF.

In the , Allora had a population of 1,223 people. Geography Allora is on the Darling Downs in south-eastern Queensland, Australia, south- west of the state capital, Brisbane. The town is located on the New England Highway between Warwick and Toowoomba.  History  Glengallan House, near Allora, circa 1875 Giabal (also known as Paiamba, Gomaingguru) is an Australian Aboriginal language. The Giabal language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Toowoomba Regional Council, particularly Toowoomba south to Allora and west to Millmerran. The region surrounding this small farming community was first explored by Europeans in the 1840s. In 1854 the first Presbyterian services were held in Allora. The town was surveyed in 1859. Its name is believed to derive from an Aboriginal word \\"gnarrallah\\", meaning waterhole or swampy place. Following European settlement, the history of the area is entwined with two famous pastoral homesteads in the vicinity of Allora: Glengallan and Talgai . Both properties ran sheep. The original \\"Talgai\\" run was taken up by E. E. Dalrymple in 1840. The creek that runs through Allora is named in his honour. Built in 1868 for the Clark family, Talgai Homestead stood on 300,000 acres (1,200 km¬≤). The homestead is built of sandstone and covers sixty squares. It is now a bed and breakfast. Allora Post Office opened on 31 March 1863. The Allora State School opened on 1 May 1867. On 31 December 2008, it was renamed Allora P-10 State School. From 1869, Allora had its own local government (initially Borough of Allora, from 1903 Town of Allora) then was combined with the Clifton Shire. In 1914 it separated from the Clifton Shire to become a shire in its own right as the Shire of Allora, which was administered from the Shire's offices initially on the corner of Warwick and Forde Streets Allora, and then at 78 Herbert Street in Allora. In 1994, the Shire of Allora was amalgamated into the Shire of Warwick. In 1873 a permanent Presbyterian congregation was established with the arrival of Reverend Thomas Kingsford as a permanent minister. Construction on a church building began in 1880 and was officially opened on 29 May 1881 by the Moderator, Right Reverend John Fleming McSwaine. In 1886 the first fossil evidence of early human occupation in the area, the Talgai Skull, was found on Talgai Homestead, embedded in the wall of Dalrymple Creek. Radiocarbon dating suggests the Talgai skull is between 9,000 and 11,000 years old. It is believed to be the skull of a boy of approximately 15 years of age who had been killed by a massive blow to the side of the head. From the 1870s, red cedar, pine and beech logged from the Goomburra valley were milled at Allora. St David's Anglican Church opened in 1888 and was consecrated in 1890. Methodist Church, 1932 The Methodist Church opened in 1896. The Allora Boer War Memorial was unveiled on 19 October 1904 by Colonel Henry Chauvel. Wilsonville Provisional School opened in 1906. On 1 January 1909 it became Wilsonville State School. It was amalgamated with Glengallan State School In late 1922 or early 1923 to create Mount Marshall State School. St Patrick's Catholic School was established on 24 January 1916 by the Sisters of St Joseph. The official opening ceremony was conducted by Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane, James Duhig. Great War memorial, 2010 The Allora Shire Soldiers Memorial was unveiled on 11 November 1921 by General J.C. Robertson and the mothers of those who died. St Paul's Church of England in Back Plains was dedicated on 12 February 1892 by Archbishop of Brisbane William Webber. The last service was conducted in Back Plains on 8 August 1943. In 1953 the church building was relocated to Nobby where it was re- established as St Paul's Church of England. The last service at Nobby was conducted circa 11 May 1975. In 1979 the building was relocated to 12 Jubb Street, Allora () to become the Scots Presbyterian Church for those Presbyterians in the district who did not wish to become part of the Uniting Church of Australia. The church in Allora was dedicated on 26 July 1980 by Presbyterian Moderator Rt Rev F. White. The current Allora Public Library opened in 1966 and had a minor refurbishment in 2010.

History   Bureau of Yards and Docks  On August 31, 1842, the Bureau of Navy Yards and Docks (BuDocks) was established, the forerunner to the Naval Facilities Engineering Command. In early days of BuDocks, the command originally had responsibility only for the design, construction, and maintenance of Navy yards and a few other shore stations. In 1842 there were seven Navy yards arrayed along the eastern seaboard of the United States. Captain Lewis Warrington, a line officer, and six civilian employees, were assigned to administer public works at these yards. During the second half of the 19th century, the Bureau of Yards and Docks guided the temporary expansion of the shore establishment that was necessary to fight the American Civil War. It also oversaw the development of permanent Navy yards on the Pacific Coast at Mare Island, California, and Puget Sound, Washington. In 1898, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War precipitated a great increase in the Bureau's activities. Its civilian workforce grew from seven to 22 people and the Civil Engineer Corps‚Äîwhich had been established in 1867‚Äîwas expanded from 10 to 21 commissioned officers, five of whom reported for duty at Bureau Headquarters. The treaty at the war's end led to the construction of naval stations in Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines. In the next few years the Navy yards at Boston, Norfolk, and Philadelphia were modernized and a new yard was built at Charleston, South Carolina. During the early years of the 20th century, the United States Congress expanded the Bureau's responsibilities by consolidating Navy public works under its control. The most important law was passed in 1911, when Congress placed the design and construction of all naval shore stations under BuDocks control. Previously the bureau that operated each type of shore facility had performed its own design and construction; for example, the Bureau of Ordnance built naval magazines and the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery built naval hospitals. The experience gained by the Bureau during its first 75 years laid the foundation for its large growth during World War I. Between July 1916 and the armistice in November 1918, the Bureau expended $347 million for public works. That was more money than the Navy had spent on shore stations in the previous 116 years. The construction program included 35 naval training stations, in addition to submarine bases at New London, Connecticut; Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; and Coco Solo, Panama; as well as naval air stations at locations throughout the eastern United States, and in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Tunisia and France. Between WWI and WWII The period between the world wars was generally a time of retrenchment and stagnation for Navy Public Works. By 1921, more than 375 ships had been decommissioned and the shore establishment shrank accordingly. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Congress appropriated some money for a naval construction program, which made improvements in shore facilities while providing much-needed jobs for unemployed civilians. When the Second World War broke out in Europe in 1939, the Civil Engineer Corps (CEC) had fewer than 200 officers on active duty and the shore establishment was woefully unprepared for a major conflict. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Navy's military construction program amounted to global proportions, expanding far beyond the continental United States and its prewar possessions to Europe, North Africa, Asia and the far corners of the Pacific. To provide supervisors for this huge wartime effort, more than 10,000 Reserve CEC officers were recruited from civilian life between 1940 and 1945. The establishment of bases in war zones, where workers were subject to enemy attack, made the use of civilian construction men impractical at many overseas locations. Therefore, in 1942 Rear Admiral Ben Moreell, Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks, implemented a proposal mapped out by the Bureau's War Plans Section during the 1930s where experienced construction workers were recruited into the Navy to build overseas bases. Thus, the Naval Construction Force ‚Äì popularly known as the Seabees ‚Äì was born. The new Seabees received brief military training before shipping overseas to build advance bases in war zones. Led by Reserve CEC officers, the 325,000 men recruited for the Seabees during World War II built bases on six continents and at locations all over the Pacific. Without the Seabees, the Navy's huge advance-base construction program would not have been possible. WWII boom World War II presented the Bureau of Yards and Docks with the greatest challenge in its history. The value of the naval shore establishment in 1939 was estimated at less than half a billion dollars; by 1945 the shore establishment was worth at least $6.5 billion. All of this new construction was carried out under the Bureau's cognizance. At the end of the war, the Bureau faced a new problem‚Äîmaintaining a much larger shore establishment with reduced funding. The onset of the Cold War in the late 1940s led to some much-needed increases in the Bureau's budget. Then, in 1950 the Korean War, which required more men and materials than World War I, presented the Bureau with new challenges. With the help of the Seabees, it met the emergency. CEC officers and Seabees built bases throughout the Pacific to support United Nations troops. In Korea the Seabees placed landing causeways for the invasion forces and built air bases and camps. Vietnam In the mid-1960s the Vietnam War started. Although it was modest in size compared to World War II, it nonetheless created a demand for a substantial amount of military construction. In 1963 the Bureau of Yards and Docks was formally designated as the contract construction agent for Southeast Asia and became responsible for nearly all U.S. construction there, including facilities built for the United States Army, the United States Air Force, and other federal government agencies. Nearly 1.8 billion dollars‚Äô worth of construction went into Vietnam under the Military Construction Program commonly known as MILCON. Meanwhile, in May 1966, as a result of a Navy Department reorganization, the Bureau of Yards and Docks got a new name, Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), one of six systems commands under the Chief of Naval Material. This reorganization eliminated the traditional bilinear organization under which the Chief of Naval Operations and the chiefs of the various bureaus reported separately to the Secretary of the Navy. The result was a unilinear organization, under which the systems commands reported to the Chief of Naval Material, who in turn reported to the CNO. In the mid-1980s the Naval Material Command was disestablished; and NAVFAC began reporting directly to the Chief of Naval Operations. U.S. forces withdrew from Vietnam in 1973 and the end of American participation in the war brought demobilization and funding cuts to the Navy. In 1970, in anticipation of postwar reductions, NAVFAC consolidated its 13 engineering field divisions into six. The concentration of technical expertise into fewer and larger divisions led to a stronger and more efficient field organization. Within NAVFAC, in the 1970s emphasis was placed on improvements in personnel facilities to support the new all-volunteer Navy, environmental protection, and energy conservation. Peacetime The tight military budgets of the 1970s did not last long, however, for in 1980 the United States began one of the largest peacetime military buildups in its history. For fiscal year 1981, President Jimmy Carter requested an increase in the Department of Defense budget of more than 5 percent real growth. After Ronald Reagan took office the next January, the DOD budget grew even faster. In 1981 Secretary of the Navy John Lehman embarked upon a major program of shipbuilding to increase the fleet from 540 ships to 600 ships by the middle of the decade. This expansion meant that the Navy needed more shore facilities to support the new ships, which in turn led to more construction work for NAVFAC. Between fiscal years 1982 and 1985, Congress appropriated more than $5 billion for Navy MILCON projects. Post‚ÄìCold War At the end of the 1980s, the collapse of the Soviet Union brought an abrupt end to the Cold War and the Navy no longer needed as many ships, planes and bases to support them. From NAVFAC's perspective, one of the most important results was the Base Realignment and Closure Program (BRAC). Between 1988 and 1995, Congress authorized four rounds of selections for base closures and numerous installations were slated for disestablishment. Until the fall of 2004, NAVFAC managed the BRAC Program for the Navy and Marine Corps. By the end of fiscal year 2004, the Command had helped the Navy dispose of 72 unneeded bases and had an inventory of 19 closed installations remaining to be excessed. In October 2003 an important change occurred in the administration of the naval shore establishment with a new command known as Commander Naval Installations Command, (CNIC) was established. The CNIC would provide uniform program, policy and funding management for all Navy shore installations. In 2004, NAVFAC embarked upon a realignment of its organizational structure and its business lines. It made a major move towards improving and standardizing its business processes to help NAVFAC better support the Navy and Marine Corps and other federal clients. The most significant aspect of NAVFAC's transformation was the consolidation of NAVFAC field activities ‚Äì including engineering field divisions, engineering field activities, officer in charge of construction organizations, public works centers and departments ‚Äì into regional facilities engineering commands, or FECs. The FECs provide the Navy, Marine Corps, and other clients with a single center for all NAVFAC public works, engineering, and acquisition support to ensure a uniform, enterprise approach to accomplishing its mission. Closures and relocations A side effect of this realignment was the decommissioning of several NAVFAC components and displacement of hundreds of employees. Notable among the closures was Engineering Field Activity Northeast in Lester, Pennsylvania. The Navy Crane Center, which was also located in Lester, was relocated to Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia. Southern Division in Charleston, South Carolina was decommissioned on September 30, 2007 and the command was realigned in Jacksonville, Florida, to become NAVFAC Southeast. NAVFAC Midwest in North Chicago, Illinois was disestablished on September 30, 2014 and its missions were absorbed by NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic, NAVFAC Southeast and NAVFAC Northwest.NAVFAC Midwest Holds Disestablishment Ceremony.

Raga Every raga has a strict set of rules which govern the number of notes that can be used; which notes can be used; and their interplay that has to be adhered to for the composition of a tune. In the Guru Granth Sahib, there are a total of 60 raga compositions and this raga is the forty-ninth raga to appear in the series. The composition in this raga appear on a total of 29 pages from page numbers 1168 to 1170. Basant denotes the changing of the season and the newness of spring. This Raag encourages the mind to brush away its selfishness, just like spring-cleaning removes all the cobwebs and creates a fresh start. There are feelings of hope and expectation of a new beginning and the start of a new cycle. However, these emotions are not dependent on the physical change of the season, but are an encouragement of an internal effort to change. Origin Basant is Pali/Punjabi word for \\"spring\\". The word is much older than the Sikh religion and any usage of the word in relation to melody or Sikh tradition is a later rendition of the word. The variants noted in the Holy Book are Basant-Hindol and Shudh Basant which also called Desi Basant in the local language. Basant is a very old raga dating from the 8th century. Guru Nanak Dev Ji, Guru Amar Das Ji, Guru Ram Das Ji, Guru Arjan Dev Ji and Guru Tegh Bahadar Ji composed Shabads in this raga. Performed in slow tempo, this gentle melody depicts quiet joy. The descending scale is usually found at the beginning of a composition with the ascending form follows later. * Aroh: * Avroh: * Vadi: * Samvadi:  Film Songs   Language:Tamil  {  !Song !Movie !Composer !Singer - Arul Jothi Deivam Thisai Maariya Paravaigal rowspan=2M.S.Viswanathan Balamurali Krishna,Abhaya (his wife) - Om Nadam Omkara Nadam Miruthanga Chakravarthi T.

The setting is a fictional guest house named Guest House located in a posh area of Islamabad. It is run by Mr. Shameem and his wife with the help of three permanent regular employees, Naveed, Murad and Rambo. Plot Every episode starts with the arrival of new guests and the involvement of the guest house's employees in their comic and tragic situations. Almost all the episodes end with the guest's problems solved by the help of all-too-readily helpful employees and reluctant owners of the guest house. Pilot episode The pilot episode introduces the janitor of the guest house, 'John Rambo', in a very dramatic way. He is holding a janitor's wiper like a rifle or machine gun and thrilling background music is playing. The camera moves in a way that the wiper actually looks like a rifle at the beginning of the scene. Later it turns out that 'John Rambo, Cockroach Killer' is inspired by the main character of the Hollywood movie First Blood. The character of Rambo was an instant hit and played a vital role in the popularity of the series. Producers wanted to remove the character after the pilot episode, but his success made them decide otherwise. One of the producers admitted on TV that after the success of Rambo in the pilot episodes, he was the focus of every episode. Characters All the main characters associated with the guest house are shown as very simple people and, on several occasions, have been fooled by charlatans posing as PEERS (fake jogis) or film directors. They tend to get involved in personal matters of their guests and try to resolve their issues. Mr. Shameem  Mr. Sharneem (played by Khalid Hafeez) is the founder and owner of the guest house. Although he is very faithful to his wife, she always suspects him of having an affair or having another wife mostly because he likes to flirt and has been caught doing so on many occasions, especially with small-time female celebrities who stay at the guest house. He is very stingy and doesn't like his wife's occasional shopping sprees, which are the main cause of their domestic problems. Mr. Shameem is a good businessman. He is always ready to please his guests and tries to meet their often outrageous demands. He is a strict taskmaster and often deducts small amounts from the salaries of his employees in order to punish them. Unlike his employees, he does not like to get involved in his guests' personal problems. However, he often finds himself in situations where he has to get involved to bail out his employees and save the reputation of his guest house. Mrs. Shameem  Mrs. Shameem (played by Sarwat Ateeque) is the wife of Mr. Shameem and is always addressed as Mrs. Shameem, never with her first name. She is very outspoken and has no qualms expressing her opinions, even if it means disapproval of the guests. She has almost the same powers in the matters of the guest house as her husband, but she scarcely uses them. She loves shopping and complains that her husband is stingy and doesn't support her shopping. She is often nostalgic of her youth and remembers the long hair she used to have. She is compassionate and easily gets involved in the personal matters of the guests. She often takes sides with the women in huests' domestic disputes. She can easily find the reflections of her own personal life in the personal problems of others. She is very soft on the employees, often takes their side, and tries to stop her husband from punishing them. She even hid Rambo in a room when he was fired by her husband. Later she persuaded Mr. Shameem to rehire him. Murad  Murad (played by Tariq Malik) is the 'bell boy' of the guest house. He hums \\"TIP TIP karta mein kumray mein aata hoon\\" when walking around the guest house, meaning, \\"I am entering the room singing, TIP TIP\\". He drops subtle hints to the guests in order to get tips from them. He often starts a conversation with a guest asking if they know English and then proceeds to ask if they know what T-I-P stands for. His other pet phrase is \\"Easy Feel\\" which he uses in many different contexts. John Rambo  John Rambo (played by Afzal Khan) is the janitor of the guest house. He is an illiterate person and belongs to a village in the suburbs of the city. He is simple and honest and has very high self-esteem. He never accepts any tips and feels offended when they are offered. He can be easily persuaded into anything if he feels it is morally right. In one episode, he goes on a mission against pollution and is beaten when he tries to stop a pop concert to prevent noise pollution. He is obsessed with Hollywood action movies, the Rambo series in particular, and wants to be an action film hero. Many guests have tried to exploit his ambition for movies, often costing him financial losses. He wears a sleeveless black T-shirt with a skull and crossbones and a pair of loose orange pajamas. He has a butterfly tattoo on each arm. He has a strange style of introducing himself. He crosses his arms, keeping them at a small distance from his body, poses his head at an angle to his torso and says this English-language sentence in the local accent: \\"My name is Rambo Rambo, John Rambo, Silver Stallone, Cockroach Killer\\". He always mispronounces \\"Sylvester Stallone\\" as \\"Silver Stallone\\". When he is excited, he adds \\"After Kar\\" at the beginning of his signature sentence. This is a combination of \\"After All\\" and \\"Aakhir Kar\\" (Urdu: ÿ¢ÿÆÿ± ⁄©ÿßÿ±). Both of these phrases have the same meanings in English and Urdu respectively. He always wears a janitor's wiper like a rifle on his back. His well-intentioned misadventures and indulgence into the private lives of the guests often put him in trouble with Mr. Shameem, and Mrs. Shameem comes to his rescue, who has sisterly affection for him. He has a fianc√©e named Jeeran who lives in his village. He often daydreams about her, while working. Rambo, after giving his best performance in Guest House, became very popular in Pakistan and then suddenly became a Lollywood star and played many lead and supporting roles in Pakistani movies. During his successful film career, he proposed to his fellow actress Sahiba (daughter of the famous actress Nisho) and later married her. Now she is known as Sahiba Afzal in the Pakistani film industry. Bao Naveed Naveed (played by Nasir Iqbal) is the Manager of the guest house.

Her career highlights include two gold, two silver and four bronze medals on the FIVB World Tour. She is a two-time European Champion and she represented the Netherlands at the 2012 Summer Olympics, finishing ninth with Marleen van Iersel. Keizer took up indoor volleyball at the age of 11 and spent several years playing in the Dutch volleyball leagues. She competed in her first international beach volleyball event in 2002 and became the inaugural U18 World Champion the same year. Keizer debuted on the World Tour the following year. For the next eight seasons, she had limited international success competing with three different partners. Her breakthrough came at the end of 2008 when she teamed up with van Iersel. The pair entered the top ten of the world rankings the year after and medalled on the World Tour five times in total, including their first World Tour title in 2011. They continued to play together until Keizer retired from beach volleyball at the end of 2013. After a four-year hiatus, Keizer returned to full-time competition partnered with Meppelink. Having been a blocker in the first leg of her career, she came back as a defender instead. Keizer and Meppelink found success quickly, medalling on the World Tour twice in their first season together and winning the 2018 European Championships. Early life, education, and family Keizer was born on 6 February 1985 in Doetinchem, Netherlands. As a child, she was a competitive swimmer before switching to water polo because her parents felt that she should play a team sport instead. She was called to the junior national water polo team, but eventually left the sport because the chlorinated swimming pool water was tinting her blond hair green and she was afraid of going to the hairdressers. At the age of 11, she took up indoor volleyball as she wanted to continue playing a ball sport. From 1996 to 2002, Keizer played for her local club, Orion Volleybal Doetinchem, where she rose from the youth ranks to the club's first team that played in the Eerste Divisie, the third division of the Dutch volleyball league system. Keizer was scouted by the national beach volleyball team when she was 15. For the next few years, she continued to play club indoor volleyball while spending the summer off-seasons training with the junior national beach volleyball team in Dwingeloo. On the indoor side, she transferred from Orion to Longa '59 for the 2002‚Äì03 season, before moving to Amsterdam to spend one season playing for VV Martinus in the Eredivisie, the highest division of the Dutch volleyball league system. She continued to live in Amsterdam until she moved to The Hague in 2008. In 2007, Keizer obtained an HBO diploma in Commercial Economics at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. She became a member of the Police Top Sport Selection () in May 2012. The programme ensures selected athletes receive support, including employment opportunities, from the Dutch police force. During her temporary retirement from beach volleyball, Keizer earned a master's degree in criminal investigation and worked as a police detective in The Hague. She left the police force upon her return to full-time competition at the end of 2017. Keizer has two brothers and one sister. She is married to beach volleyball player-turned-coach Michiel van der Kuip, and the couple have two children, twins born in 2016. Career 2002‚Äì2004: Junior and early years Keizer made her international beach volleyball debut at the 2002 U18 European Championships in August, where she and Arjanne Stevens won the silver medal. Two weeks later, the pair became the inaugural U18 World Champions with an unbeaten tournament run in Xylokastro, Greece. Following her success on the junior circuit, Keizer debuted on the FIVB World Tour in 2003, partnering with Merel Mooren at the $150K Hellas Open in June. The duo did not progress past the qualifying rounds in Hellas or in their next four events. In their final tournament of the year at the $150K Lianyungang Open in August, Keizer and Mooren beat teams from Spain and Sweden to advance to Keizer's first main draw on the World Tour. They lost all three of their group stage matches in the main draw and did not progress further. Keizer concluded her first season on the World Tour ranked 70 in the world with Mooren. Keizer and Mooren continued to struggle to qualify for main draws on the World Tour the following year, making it out of the qualifiers twice in their first eight tournaments. They also competed in two events on the Challenger and Satellite circuit in August, winning one gold medal. Towards the end of the season, the pair had accumulated sufficient ranking points to directly enter the World Tour main draws of the $180K Milan and Rio de Janeiro Opens, finishing 25th and 17th respectively. They ended the year with an improved world ranking of No. 39. 2005‚Äì2007: Partnering with Leenstra After two seasons with Mooren, Keizer switched partners and played with Marrit Leenstra from 2005 to 2007. In the first year of their partnership, the duo did not place higher than 13th in the first ten World Tour events they entered. Seeded 11th at their next tournament, the $200K Montreal Open in August, they upset two top- ten seeds on their way to the semifinals where they lost to Brazil's third- seeded Talita Antunes and Renata Ribeiro, followed by another loss to Brazil's second-seeded Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar in the bronze-medal match. After Montreal, Keizer and Leenstra had top-ten finishes in four of their last five tournaments of 2005. They also competed in their first World Championships in June as the No. 22 seeds, posting three wins and two losses to tie for 17th place. They closed out their first season as teammates ranked 13th in the world. Over the next two years, Keizer and Leenstra had limited success on the international circuit and were relegated to the qualifiers for the majority of 2007. Their best results were top-ten finishes at the double-elimination $200K St. Petersburg and Porto Santo Opens in 2006. As the No. 20 seeds in St. Petersburg, they recorded a three-set upset over the third-seeded Tian Jia and Wang Jie of China, before falling to the eighth-seeded Nila H√•kedal and Ingrid T√∏rlen of Norway in the fourth round of the losers bracket. In Porto Santo, the pair finished in seventh place as the No. 16 seeds, scoring upsets over the higher-seeded Cuban teams of Milagros Crespo and Imara Esteves Ribalta, and Dalixia Fern√°ndez and Tamara Larrea. They were knocked out of the competition by the eighth seeds from Germany, Rieke Brink-Abeler and Hella Jurich. By the end of 2007, their world ranking had dropped to No. 44. Throughout the course of their partnership, Keizer and Leenstra were also active on the Nestea European Championship Tour, winning bronze medals at the ‚Ç¨55K German and Swiss Masters in 2006. After failing to qualify two years prior, Keizer took part in the 2006 edition of the European Championships with Leenstra; they fell short of their No. 6 seed and finished ninth. 2008: Partnering with de Vries After three seasons together, Keizer split from Leenstra and teamed up with Mered de Vries for 2008. The new pairing did not win any main draw matches in their first ten World Tour events. Their results picked up in July when they competed at the $300K Gstaad Grand Slam as the No. 26 seeds. Keizer and de Vries came through the qualifiers and upset two of the top-ten seeds on their way to the Round of 16, where they were defeated by Maria Elisa Antonelli and Vanilda Le√£o of Brazil. Later in the month, they achieved their highest finish as a team with a fifth place at the $300K Klagenfurt Grand Slam. Seeded 26th once more, they came back from a first-set loss to beat the fourth-seeded Talita and Renata of Brazil in the Round of 16, before losing to Ukraine's 27th-seeded Svitlana Baburina and Galyna Osheyko in the quarterfinals. They ended the year 31st in the world rankings. 2008‚Äì2010: Partnering with van Iersel Keizer preparing to receive a serve at the 2010 Marseille Open Towards the end of 2008, Keizer changed partners once again and paired up with Marleen van Iersel. She began to see better results on the international circuit, including her first World Tour podium at the $190K Japan Open in the spring of 2009. After losing their first match, the 13th-seeded Keizer and van Iersel won six consecutive matches to reach the final four, recording upsets over two top-five seeds along the way. They lost to Brazil's top-seeded Juliana Silva and Larissa Fran√ßa in the semifinals, then went on to beat the USA's 26th-seeded Angie Akers and Tyra Turner in the bronze-medal match. The bronze in Japan was only the second time a Dutch women's team had ever won a World Tour medal. Another bronze-medal match-up followed at the $300K Gstaad Grand Slam two months later. This time, the Dutch No. 13 seeds lost to the fourth-seeded Nicole Branagh and Elaine Youngs of the United States in two sets. Keizer and van Iersel also competed at the 2009 World and European Championships, and were stopped in the quarterfinals of both tournaments. They were the sixth-ranked team in the world at the end of the year. Keizer and van Iersel made three more World Tour semifinals appearances the next season, but did not medal. The duo entered the 2010 European Championships as the No. 6 seeds, eventually finishing fourth with a loss to the German No. 1 seeds of Sara Goller and Laura Ludwig in the semifinals, and the Finnish No. 4 seeds of Emilia and Erika Nystr√∂m in the bronze-medal match. They were ranked No. 9 in the world at the conclusion of the season. 2011: First World Tour titles The 2011 season was a breakthrough year for the pair as they became the first European women's team to win back-to-back World Tour titles. They won their first World Tour title at the $190K Shanghai Open in May. Seeded No. 7, they reached the gold-medal match with upsets over three of the top-five seeds, then capped off an undefeated tournament run with a 15‚Äì21, 26‚Äì24, 15‚Äì13 victory over Jennifer Kessy and April Ross of the United States. Later that same month at the $190K Myslowice Open, Keizer and van Iersel were sent to the losers bracket in the third round of the double-elimination competition by Italy's Greta Cicolari and Marta Menegatti. The pair then won four matches in a row to make it to the finals where they faced Cicolari and Menegatti once again. This time, the Dutch duo beat the Italians in two sets for their second World Tour title. After their success in Shanghai and Myslowice, they were temporarily set back by a back injury sustained by van Iersel that forced them to withdraw from their next tournament. By August however, they had attained another podium finish at the $300K Klagenfurt Grand Slam as the No. 8 seeds, losing only to the fourth-seeded Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings of the United States in the semifinals, before beating the third-seeded Brazilian duo of Maria Elisa and Talita to win the bronze medal. After their World Tour victories the month prior, the pair came into the 2011 World Championships as the tournament's dark horse, but found themselves eliminated by Germany's Jana K√∂hler and Julia Sude in the Round of 16. Keizer and van Iersel also entered 2011 European Championships in August as the No. 1 seeds. They progressed to the quarterfinals where they were upset by the 16th-seeded Barbara Hansel and Sara Montagnolli of Austria, a team that they had beaten earlier in the group stage. The duo wrapped up the year ranked No. 7 in the world. 2012: European Champions, London Olympics In the lead up to the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Keizer and van Iersel competed at seven World Tour events. They medalled in two of them, winning bronze at the $300K Beijing Grand Slam, followed by silver at the $300K Gstaad Grand Slam. They notched victories against top-ranked teams including the Chinese team of Xue Chen and Zhang Xi, and the American team of Kessy and Ross. The pair also competed at the European Championships in The Hague at the end of May. Coming in as the No. 3 seeds, Keizer and van Iersel advanced to the finals undefeated. In their quarterfinal match against Belgium's seventh-seeded Katrien Gielen and Liesbeth Mouha, the home side rallied from a set down to win 18‚Äì21, 21‚Äì15, 15‚Äì10. In the semifinals, they beat the Czech Republic's top-seeded Lenka H√°jeƒçkov√° and Hana Skaln√≠kov√°, and were subsequently crowned the new European Champions with a victory over Vassiliki Arvaniti and Maria Tsiartsiani of Greece in the championship match. Keizer and van Iersel qualified for the London Olympics on 18 June 2012 via their Olympic ranking points. They entered the tournament ranked fourth in the world and were dubbed a \\"sleeper team\\" by player-turned-commentator Kevin Wong. Seeded ninth, they lost their first two group stage matches against the 16th-seeded Elsa Baquerizo and Liliana Fern√°ndez of Spain, and the fourth-seeded Kessy and Ross of the United States. A must-win victory over Argentina's No. 21 seeds Ana Gallay and Mar√≠a Zonta ensured they advanced to the Round of 16 where they faced the USA's third- seeded May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings. The Americans defeated them in straight sets, thus ending Keizer and van Iersel's Olympic run. The Olympics was their last tournament of 2012 and they ended the year eighth in the world rankings. 2013‚Äì2017: Hiatus Keizer and van Iersel did not medal on the World Tour in 2013; their highest finish was a fifth at the $220K The Hague Grand Slam. They also took part in the European Championships, advancing to the Round of 16 where they lost the deciding set against their compatriots Jantine van der Vlist and Marloes Wesselink. After 11 years competing on the World Tour, Keizer decided to retire at the end of 2013 to focus more on her personal life and police work. Despite her retirement, Keizer continued to enter beach volleyball tournaments every now and then. She partnered with Sophie van Gestel to compete at the $500K Transavia Grand Slam mid-2014; they lost all three of their group stage matches and did not progress further. In the summer of 2017, she played at the $150K Dela Beach Open with Madelein Meppelink as a replacement for Meppelink's injured partner van Gestel. The pair advanced to the Round of 16 before they were eliminated by Brazil's Maria Elisa and Carolina \\"Carol\\" Solberg Salgado; the Brazilian duo went on to win the tournament. Playing at the 2017 Dela Beach Open prompted Keizer to consider returning to the sport on a full-time basis. Her subsequent participation in two national tour events‚Äîone with Meppelink and one with van Iersel‚Äîfurther convinced her to make a comeback. 2018‚Äìpresent: Partnering with Meppelink, European Champions Keizer at the 2018 Vienna Major At the end of 2017, Keizer committed to a full-time comeback to beach volleyball with Meppelink. Despite a slow start, Keizer and Meppelink soon found success by medalling on the World Tour twice in 2018. The first was a silver medal at the $75K Mersin Open in May. Three months later, they entered the $300K Vienna Major as the No. 16 seeds. They advanced to the final four undefeated, including a victory over Canada's top-seeded Melissa Humana-Paredes and Sarah Pavan. In the semifinals, they lost to the fourth-seeded Fernanda Alves and B√°rbara Seixas of Brazil, but came back the next day to beat Maria Elisa and Carol to claim the bronze medal. Despite starting off the season with zero ranking points, Keizer qualified for the 2018 World Tour Finals which features the top ten teams in the world rankings. The pair did not win any of their group stage matches and tied for last place. Keizer and Meppelink also took part in the 2018 European Championships in July. Seeded 15th, they posted a loss to France's 31st-seeded Aline Chamereau and Alexandra Jupiter, but made it to the finals with victories over the second-seeded Czech team of Barbora Hermannov√° and Mark√©ta Slukov√°, and the third-seeded Swiss team of Zoe and Anouk Verg√©- D√©pr√©. In the gold-medal match, Keizer and Meppelink defeated the fifth-seeded Nina Betschart and Tanja Huberli of Switzerland in straight sets for the second European Championship title of Keizer's career. Style of play Keizer is a defender and a right-handed right-side player. She had been a blocker before her retirement in 2013, but at slightly above , she had long felt unsuited and undersized for the role. As such, a condition for her return at the end of 2017 was that she got to switch roles and play as a defender instead. Olympic gold medalist Dain Blanton noted at the 2018 Vienna Major that Keizer has an aggressive and physical playing style to go along with being a well-rounded player. Her setting ability in particular has been praised by opponents. Of the 87 players who competed in a Major Series main draw on the 2018 World Tour, Keizer was ranked 34th for total points scored, averaging 6.21 points per set; 32nd for total kills, averaging 5.71 kills per set; and 35th for number of aces, with around 5.5% of her serves being aces.\\"Best players\\".

The Ikki were mobs of peasants, commoners, monks, and low-ranking samurai who revolted out of a desire to improve their social standing by threatening to overthrow the daimyo. In December 1536, Nagao Tamekage set out from the castle of Kasugayama to fight against the Ikk≈ç-ikki of Kaga Province. They met in battle at a place called Sendanno, in Etch≈´ Province. There, Tamekage was defeated and killed, along with many other Nagao clan warriors. Tamekage's son, known as Terutora, was not present at the battle, but would later become the famous Uesugi Kenshin.

The goal of this technique is to control vector-borne diseases. The first step is to identify proteins that prevent the vector species from transmitting the pathogen. The genes coding for these proteins are then introduced into the symbiont, so that they can be expressed in the vector. The final step in the strategy is to introduce these transgenic symbionts into vector populations in the wild. The first example of this technique used Rhodnius prolixus which is associated with the symbiont Rhodococcus rhodnii. R. prolixus is an important insect vector of Chagas disease that is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. The strategy was to engineer R. rhodnii to express proteins such as Cecropin A that are toxic to T. cruzi or that block the transmission of T. cruzi.Durvasula, R.V., Gumbs, A., Panackal, A., Kruglov, O., Aksoy, S., Merrifield, R.B., Richards, F.F., and Beard, C.B.

Attempts are also made in Tse-tse flies using bacteria and in malaria mosquitoes using fungi, viruses, or bacteria. In order to perform paratransgenesis, there are several requirements: *The symbiotic bacteria can be grown in vitro easily. *They can be genetically modified, such as through transformation with a plasmid containing the desired gene. *The engineered symbiont is stable and safe. *The association between vector and symbiont cannot be attenuated. *Field delivery is easily handled.

The position was one of the royal offices that gave the possessor nobility upon beginning his service. The Grand Chamberman was in charge of the King's chamber. Under the first Capetians, the Grand Chamberman managed the Royal Treasury along with the Grand Bouteiller (Grand Butler), before being supplanted of these functions by the Chamber of Accounts (, created by King Philip IV) and the position of Superintendent of Finances (, created in 1311). During its existence, the position of Grand Chamberman had greater power than that of the Grand Chamberlain. He signed charters and other important letters, preceded the Constable of France in ceremonies and assisted at the trial of peers.

Raga Bilaval is named after Veraval, Gujarat. The Indian national anthem Jana gana mana is sung in Bilaval. Bilaval had become the basic scale for North Indian music by the early part of the 19th century. Its tonal relationships are comparable to the Western music C major scale. Bilaval appears in the Ragamala as a ragini of Bhairav, but today it is the head of the Bilaval thaat. The Ragamala names Bilaval as a putra (son) of Bhairav, but no relation between these two ragas is made today. Bilaval is a morning raga to be sung with a feeling of deep devotion and repose, often performed during the hot months. The Bilaval thaat is equivalent to the Carnatic melakarta raga, Dheerasankarabharanam, as well as the Western Ionian mode (major scale) and contains the notes S R G M P D N S'. The pitches of Bilaval thaat are all shuddha, or natural. Flat () or sharp () of pitches always occurs with reference to the interval pattern in Bilaval thaat. Bilaval is one of the raags that is in the Sikh tradition from northern India, and is part of the Sikh holy scripture (Granth), the Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Every raga has a strict set of rules which govern the number of notes that can be used; which notes can be used; and their interplay that has to be adhered to for the composition of a tune. In the Sri Guru Granth Sahib, there are a total of 31 raga compositions. Bilaval is the sixteenth raga to appear in the series. The composition in this raga appear on a total of 64 pages from page numbers 795 to 859.

Although \\"Romeo's Blue Skies\\" is the literal translation of the Japanese title, the official English name given by Nippon Animation is \\"Romeo and the Black Brothers\\". It is known in Arabic as \\"ÿπŸáÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿµÿØŸÇÿßÿ°\\" (literally \\"Friends' Covenant\\") and in the Philippines as \\"Mga Munting Pangarap ni Romeo\\" (literally \\"Romeo's Simple Dreams\\"). It was first shown on April 14, 1997 on ABS-CBN. It is based on the novel Die schwarzen Br√ºder (\\"The Black Brothers\\") written in 1941 in Switzerland by author Lisa Tetzner. Plot In the second half of the 19th century, in 1875, the story begins with the titular character, Romeo, waking up and making his way to the church to ring the bell along with his pet ermine, Piccolo. The village is suffering due to a long draught, and Romeo's family is hit by it the worst, as they are also under debt. Romeo wants to compete in the pole climbing competition, as he wishes to follow his father's footsteps. Meanwhile, a mysterious man, whom the villagers refer to as \\"the god of death\\" makes his way into the village. He has his eyes on Romeo and plans to buy him from his parents. He urges Romeo's father Roberto to sell his son and in exchange he would take care of the tab for him. The fellow villagers tell the god of death to back off as Roberto would never sell his son, and besides, he still has one corn field remaining. The god of death smiles when he hears this information. During the pole climbing competition, the god of death starts a fire in the corn field, in order to force Romeo's family to sell him. Romeo's family rush to the field and manage to save two goats, but Roberto injures his head while leaping out from the flames. Roberto's injury worsens and the priest is worried, as without medical attention Roberto could end up blind for the rest of his life. The doctors fee is very expensive, as he has to come from a neighbouring village. Romeo is unable to see his father in this state, so he willingly sells himself into slavery. In exchange, the god of death takes care of the medical fee. Once Roberto has been treated, it is time for Romeo to leave, but just as he leaves he is told that none of the kids ever come back to the village, probably because they succumb to the harsh work conditions. He has no choice however as he had signed the contract and leaves the same day. Along the way he meets a boy who is unwilling to reveal anything apart from his name, which is Alfredo. They both earn each other's mutual respect after they help each other. This is also where they meet a boy named Dante. Soon they are taken into a tavern where they are thrown into the basement where the other kids were kept, Dante included. A few of them try to escape, but in vain. The god of death, or Mr. Luini decides that they must be sold as soon as possible before they try escaping again, so he and his companion decide to travel to Milan by boat, in the storm, however the boat sinks and apart from Alfredo and Romeo everyone else is presumed to be dead. They then see Mr. Luini drowning. Romeo's good values do not allow him to let the man sink and he saves him, as he believes that is what his father would do. The next day, Mr. Luini takes them both to Milan by horse cart, where they both are sold to two different people at high prices, but not before Romeo and Alfredo swear eternal friendship. The man who buys Romeo is called Marchello Rossi who is thoroughly manipulated by his wife, but is actually kind at heart. Through one of their routine cleaning days, Romeo meets professor Casera who teaches him how to read. Although Romeo is denied food by Rossi's wife, their daughter, who Romeo refers to as an angel, helps him by sharing her food with him. Soon, Anzelmo tricks Romeo into being friends so that he could steal the letter that the angel (Angeletta) had written for him, but turns out the letter was actually a page from her diary, where she detailed all the lies said by Anzelmo. When the wolf pack read it, they mercilessly beat Anzelmo up for lying to them. Anzelmo, hurt badly, swears revenge against Romeo. He blames his wounds on Romeo, knowing that his mother would believe him no matter what, and accuses Romeo of a robbery. Romeo manages to escape just in the nick of time from the police but is cornered by the wolf pack. Dante appears from nowhere and saves Romeo, who is thrilled to see that Dante is still alive. Dante however urges Romeo to leave the city as he is a wanted person. However, there is a mixup between the wagons and he ends up in the wagon of a criminal, who plans to blow up the police station to free his brother. Romeo manages to warn the police officers and Rossi just in the nick of time but ends up badly injuring himself. Rossi, moved by the act, decides to stand up to his wife and reveals that Angeletta had seen the real thief. After this, Rossi warms up to Romeo much more and greatly improves his living conditions, and learns to stand up to his wife's manipulations. Romeo finally meets Alfredo again, and they grab all the chimney sweepers to form an alliance called the black brothers to combat the wolf pack. The challenge the wolf pack to a bout and win as they pre planned and set traps. However, the leader Giovanni is no where to be seen, as he is called to fight the strongest member of the scorpion gang, who he defeats effortlessly, after which they disband and join the wolf pack. Giovanni is outraged to hear that the wolf pack lost to the black brothers. In revenge, they kidnap Michaelo and ask for Alfredo in exchange. When Alfredo refuses to kneel down in front of Giovanni, the latter proposes a battle at dawn. Initially they all fight (except Alfredo), but seeing as no one is able to gain the upper hand, Alfredo asks them to stop. Giovanni agrees and decides to make it a 1 on 1 fight. Tachioni volunteers to fight from the Wolf pack gang and Romeo from the black brothers. However, midway Tachioni draws out a blade in spite of Giovanni's instructions to use only fists, luckily the reflection from Romeo's charm blinds Tachioni and he is able to defeat him. Giovanni accepts defeat and praises Alfredo for having good friends, but tells him that they will get even some day. Angeletta's mannerism is totally different from the rest of the family, and this leads to suspicion among some members of the wolf pack, particularly Dante. He extracts part of the truth from his master(who is a close friend of Rossi). Romeo overhears the conversation between Rossi and Angeletta and decides to follow him to the Countess' mansion, where it turns out that Angeletta is in fact the granddaughter of lady Isabella, a countess. Isabella's son, Adolfo, fell in love with a poor woman named Giovanna. However, Isabella did not approve of the difference in social status and thus the young couple left after they bore a child. Sadly, the parents passed away due to an illness and Isabella passed on the child to Rossi who was her childhood friend. Isabella is unwilling to let Angeletta into the mansion as she believes the latter is only after her wealth, and Romeo is willing to wager his life to prove her otherwise. Angeletta's condition worsens and she wishes to see her grandmother once before she dies. They sneak into the mansion and Angeletta gets to see her grandmother, but she coldly tells her to go back home. Angeletta, however thanks Isabella for allowing her to meet her and goes to the church to pray. She collapses in between, and goes into a coma. Dr Casera says the only way to save her would be to go his acquaintance in Paris, who is a heart specialist. Romeo, the rest of the black brothers and Rossi try their best to convince Isabella, and she finally agrees after being moved by Romeo's devotion and friendship. She meets Angeletta and promises to take care of her in whatever way possible, and the next day, after a farewell, they leave for Paris by train. They following days, Romeo notices a huge crowd gathering outside a palace, and it turns out it is the grand wedding of the Duke of Milan. Romeo is called to clean the chimney of the hotel where all the invited nobles and royalties are staying, where he finds Alfredo's younger sister, Bianca, staying along with her uncle and aunt. She escapes and Romeo along with Alfredo begin to search for her, as the same with her uncle and aunt. Alfredo is visibly unwell, this could be attributed to the abuse he regularly went through at the hands of his master Citron, a cruel, vile man who spent all his money on drinking and gambling and thus Alfredo often went hungry. Alfredo tells the story of how he and Bianca were the children of the Martini family, Vittorio and Fatricia Martini, and how their father's younger brother Mauricio was extremely jealous of his success and wealth. Along with his wife, Grazela, they burn the house which kills Alfredo and Bianca\`s parents, but not before they hand them the precious treasure of the Martini family, a medal. Alfredo and Bianca flee the burning mansion and their uncle and aunt frame them for the fire in hopes of capturing them and ultimately retrieving the medal. Alfredo and Bianca run for days until they are taken in by a couple, who they beg to let them stay. The God of Death makes his way to the village, and Alfredo willingly sells himself into slavery to provide the family with enough funds to raise Bianca. However, Bianca is captured by their relatives soon after Alfredo sold himself. Bianca meanwhile is unable find Alfredo but Mauricio captures her and takes her back to the hotel and ties her up. Luckily Nikita witnesses Bianca\`s capture and alerts Romeo and Alfredo. Then the black brothers come through, free her and tie up Bianca's aunt. Mauricio makes his way to the church as he heard that Alfredo was there, but Alfredo creates a distraction and with the help of Nikita, he escapes. Alfredo is re-united with his sister, but collapses and coughs blood. He is taken to professor Casera, who is worried that Alfredo's illness is terminal. Alfredo, however says that he cannot stay any longer and has to go back to his master as his contact was not over yet. Alfredo assures his friends that it was nothing serious and he just had a cold, and the reason he was coughing blood was because he had bit his tongue. Meanwhile, Mauricio orders for a fake medal to be made in order to be let into the dining room, while Alfredo and Bianca along with the black brothers think of a plan to sneak them inside, in order to tell the king the truth. In the background Giovanni watches them, planning to confront Alfredo once and for all. Alfredo has a talk with Romeo and heads home. He is first stopped by Nikita, who is presumably waiting for him. As they talk, though, Alfredo begins to coughs blood, while Nikita stares in horror. Alfredo begs her to keep it a secret, as he does not want to worry his friends. As he moves on, he is stopped by Giovanni, but before the latter could finish the fight, he notices Alfredo coughing and stops the fight, and Alfredo thanks him and leaves, making Giovanni uncomfortable. The rest of the wolf pack decides to capture Alfredo, unfortunately it turns out to be the day when Alfredo was supposed to meet the king. After trapping Alfredo inside a basement under the bridge, the pack run to Giovanni, who is enraged at their actions. Romeo, meanwhile is able to locate Alfredo as Mr Rossi had seen him go under the bridge. Romeo asks Alfredo to escape while he would stay back to stall the pack. When the pack reaches him, Giovanni is astonished at how dedicated and loyal Romeo is towards Alfredo. Nikita, no longer able to hold back, tells them that Alfredo is dying due to an illness, which happens to be the same illness that killed Giovanni's father, and this is not known to Romeo either. Giovanni decides to help Romeo and his group for the night. With the help of the wolf pack, they make their way through the castle, defeating the bodyguards. Meanwhile, Lady Isabella arrives and sees Michaelo, who explains everything to her. Just as Alfredo and Bianca are about to meet the king, Mauricio takes Bianca as hostage, and before he could finish her Nikita creates a distraction, due to which Alfredo and Romeo fall over, but survive. They are successfully able to make it into the mansion, however the guards capture the children. Luckily for them, Lady Isabella comes through revealing the identities of Alfredo and Bianca and asks the guards to leave the kids. As Mauricio and Grazela are about to present the medal to the king, Alfredo pronounces the medal as fake, and claims he has the real medal. The king allows both parties to narrate their stories, but Mauricio is not aware of the fact that the king's father had marked something on the real medal- the mark of benediction, for showing true bravery and saving his life in war, which was missing from Mauricio's copy, and hence Alfredo and Bianca's names are cleared and their evil relatives are taken away. The black brothers talk for a while and everyone leaves, except Alfredo and Romeo, who go to the church, where they remember the moment they first met. Romeo thanks Alfredo for bringing hope into his life. Alfredo smiles, and says it wasn't him who was the ray of hope, it was Romeo himself, and he thanks Romeo for bringing courage and hope into his life. Alfredo then reminds him of the oath they made- they would always be together, no matter how far away they were from each other, asks Romeo to fulfil the dreams he would not be able to achieve, and asks him to take care of Bianca. And with that, Alfredo peacefully passes away in Romeo's arms, leaving a heartbroken Romeo behind, crying for his dear friend. Romeo can hardly concentrate on any of his day-to-day activities or work, and this angers the rest of the black brothers and Bianca. His refusal to accept Alfredo's death puts a strain on their relations. The wolf pack gang, particularly Nikita, were also saddened by Alfredo's death. To get Romeo back into his spirits, the black brothers organise a fight, where should he lose, he would be cast out. Romeo makes his way to the fight, and after taking a few punches and after listening to Bianca and Dante, he finally snaps out of his trance, after realising what his best friend had told him. He decides to go around town asking for donations for Alfredo's funeral. At his funeral, they sing the black brothers song in honour of Alfredo. As the leader of the group, he is presented with a challenge: to gather 20 lira, as they all want to watch the new circus that is in town. Romeo found an old broken house that needed heavy fixes and repairs. Romeo volunteers to clean and repair the house, and seeing his dedication the others along with Bianca pitch in too. On the day before the circus leaves, Romeo is unable to complete cleaning the second floor, buy the woman is pleased with his efforts and pays him 20 lira anyway. However, Michaelo accidentally breaks a vase, which angers the shopkeeper and he takes Michaelo's pendent which his mother had given him. Romeo finds out, and without a moment's hesitation, trades the money for the pendent, a decision everyone agrees and praised him for. Happily, they all sit and share stories from their hometowns till the evening ends. While working one day, Romeo falls from a chimney. Dr Casera agrees to have him and Bianca at his place until his leg heals. The doctor interests them both in many subjects, and Bianca begins to see Dr Casera as a father. They help children at an orphanage as well. As a thank you present, they hold a puppet show for Dr Casera, where Bianca reveals that she wishes to stay with the doctor and become his nurse, while Romeo wishes to keep studying and become a teacher to educate and help others like Dr Casera. The time has finally come for Romeo to go back home, as his contract is over. Some of the boys have already left and some of them have a while still. Romeo takes his time to wish everyone goodbye, and although Mrs Rossi does not like to admit it, she does miss Romeo. Mr Rossi says that he would probably never get a helper like Romeo again, and Romeo thanks him and calls him his second father. As they are making their way, they see The God of Death with a new batch of kids. They visit Alfredo's grave one last time, where they make truce with the wolf pack, and Nikita promises to take care of Alfredo's grave. Dr Casera drives them halfway to their home towns along with Bianca, and they all wish each other good bye and best of luck. Romeo re-unites with his family, and 10 years later, in 1885, thanks to his hard work, he becomes a teacher and marries Bianca, and they name their child Alfredo. With that, the anime concludes.

They were survived by their children, Alfredo and Bianca. ; Maurizio Martini („Éû„Ç¶„É™„ÉÉ„ÉÑ„Ç£„Ç™„Éª„Éû„É´„ÉÜ„Ç£„Éº„Éã) : Voiced by Nakata Kazuhiro : Maurizio is the husband of Grazela. He is also the evil younger brother of Viscount Vittorio Martini and uncle of the siblings Alfredo and Bianca. Maurizio and Grazela extremely envy the viscount. They coveted all the wealth of Viscount Vittorio, especially the Martini medal. Their deep enviousness led them to burn the Martini mansion in Piedmont. Viscount Vittorio and his wife Viscountess Patrizia were killed during the incident. Alfredo and Bianca managed to escape from their burning mansion with the Martini medal. The evil couple hunted the siblings for the medal. They even put on Alfredo and Bianca's heads the blame for the tragedy in the Martini mansion. After Alfredo sold himself to work in Milan, Maurizio and Grazela captured Bianca. Knowing that Alfredo was in Milan and the Martini medal was with him, they made Bianca a hostage to forcefully get the medal from him. Romeo and the majority of the Black Brothers then saved Bianca from the evil couple. Bianca was later reunited with her brother Alfredo. Maurizio and Grazela failed to get the Martini medal from Alfredo, but they still did not give up on their evil plans. Before the evil couple went to a banquet that was attended by the King of Italy, Maurizio hired a man to create a replica of the Martini medal. The fake medal was finished and Maurizio wore it on the day of the banquet, hoping he and his wife will not get caught as impostors. Upon learning about the presence of Alfredo and Bianca in the banquet, Maurizio and his bodyguards tried to eliminate the siblings, but with the help of the Black Brothers, Wolf Pack, and Countess Isabella Montovani, the siblings were saved. Accompanied by Countess Montovani, Alfredo and Bianca met with the King of Italy and faced off with their evil relatives. While they were all in front of the king, Alfredo told the king that Maurizio's medal is a fake and that the one he holds is real. To see who is the \\"low-down skunk up to his neck in lies,\\" the King of Italy examined the two Martini medals. Later, the king found out that Maurizio's medal is truly fake because there is no \\"mark of benediction\\" in its back and that Alfredo's medal is the one with a \\"mark of benediction.\\" The evil couple were caught as impostors and taken away in disgrace. In the end, Maurizio and Grazela did not get all that they wanted, Alfredo and Bianca victoriously cleared their tarnished names and reclaimed their inheritance. ; Grazela Martini („Ç∞„É©„Çº„Éº„É©„Éª„Éû„É´„ÉÜ„Ç£„Éº„Éã) : Voiced by Soumi Yoko : Grazela is the wife of Maurizio Martini and sister-in-law of the couple Viscount Vittorio Martini and Viscountess Patrizia Martini. She is also the evil aunt of the siblings Alfredo and Bianca (and the more evil of her and Maurizio). Grazela and her husband extremely envy Viscount Vittorio Martini. They coveted all the treasures of the viscount, especially the Martini medal. Their deep enviousness led them to burn the Martini mansion in Piedmont, killing Viscount Vittorio and his wife. During this time, Alfredo and Bianca managed to escape from their burning mansion with the Martini medal. Maurizio and Grazela hunted the siblings for the medal. They even put on Alfredo and Bianca's heads the blame for the tragedy in the Martini mansion. After Alfredo sold himself to work in Milan, Grazela and Maurizio captured Bianca. Knowing that Alfredo was in Milan and that the Martini medal was with him, they took Bianca hostage to forcefully get the medal from him. Romeo and the majority of the Black Brothers then saved Bianca from the evil couple. Bianca was later reunited with her big brother Alfredo. Grazela and Maurizio failed to get the Martini medal from Alfredo, but they still did not give up on their evil deeds. Before the evil couple went to a banquet attended by the King of Italy, Grazela's husband Maurizio hired a man to create a copy of the Martini medal. The fake medal was finished and the evil couple brought it with them to the banquet, hoping they will not get caught as impostors. The siblings Alfredo and Bianca also managed to go to the banquet with the help of the Black Brothers, Wolf Pack, and Countess Isabella Montovani. Accompanied by Countess Montovani, the siblings met with the King of Italy and faced off with their evil relatives. While they were all in front of the king, Alfredo told the king that the Martini medal which was brought by Grazela and Maurizio is a fake and that the one that he holds is the real one. To know who is the liar, the King of Italy examined the two Martini medals. Later, the king found out that the evil couple's medal is really fake and that the medal from Alfredo is the real one because of the \\"mark of benediction\\" in its back. Grazela then tried one last effort to fool the king by trying to make it appear that Alfredo swapped the medals, but because she and Maurizio did not originally know about the \\"mark of benediction\\" she was unable to convince the king. The evil couple were therefore caught as impostors and taken away in disgrace. In the end, Grazela and Maurizio did not get all that they wanted, Alfredo and Bianca successfully cleared their tarnished names and reclaimed their inheritance. ; Piccolo: Romeo's pet ermine, who strangely retains its winter coat throughout the series. ; Marchelo Rossi („Éû„É´„ÉÅ„Çß„É≠„Éª„É≠„ÉÉ„Ç∑) : Voiced by Masahiro Anzai : Romeo's boss, who bought him.

He did everything that he could to make Romeo's life easier in Milan. Romeo considers Rossi as his second father. :Marchelo has one son, Anzelmo, and one foster daughter, Angeletta, the granddaughter of Countess Isabella Montovani.

However, in the last episode, Edda cried when Romeo bid the Rossi couple goodbye after finishing his working contract in Milan. She somehow realized that Romeo became a great help to the Rossi family.

When Angeletta was still a baby, she was entrusted by Lady Isabella to Marchelo Rossi. She was not accepted by her grandmother at that time, due to her dislike towards her mother and her belief that Angeletta would come after the Montovani estate. She first appeared in episode 7 when she first saw Romeo being lead by Rossi to a cell which was later destroyed and built to a bed in episode 14. Angeletta was raised by her foster parents, Marchelo and Edda. Unlike her foster parents' real child, Anzelmo, she is an extremely kind person. Angeletta is also great in drawing and writing journals. It was proven through her sketchbook and diary. She was suffering from a serious heart illness for a long time and was unable to leave her bed, and is thus usually left alone in her room. Romeo and Angeletta became very close friends. Angeletta was nicknamed by Romeo as his \\"Angel.\\" Romeo and the rest of the Black Brothers helped the \\"Angel\\" to get accepted by her grandmother. They successfully convinced the \\"Ice Queen\\" that Angeletta is not after the Montovani estate. Countess Montovani then took custody of her granddaughter.

Her son, Count Adolfo, who fell in love with a commoner named Giovanna, was Angeletta's biological father. She used to be called \\"Ice Queen\\" because she used to have a very cold personality and she had a strong dislike towards Giovanna, due to her not being nobility and would not approve of her being Adolfo\`s wife, which later forced Adolfo to leave the mansion with Giovanna and Angeletta. Following the deaths of Adolfo and Giovanna Lady Isabella entrusted the infant Angeletta to Marchelo Rossi during an unseasonable springtime snowfall. She became the benefactor of Angeletta during her entire years with Rossi's family. It took several years before the countess accepted her granddaughter. Lady Isabella would not let go of her dislike towards Angeletta\`a mother and she also used to believe that Angeletta was only after the Montovani estate, but with the help of Romeo and the rest of the members of the Black Brothers, she was enlightened. In the end, Countess Montovani took custody of Angeletta.

Because of this, Giovanni accepted the defeat of the Wolf Pack gang in their fight against the Black Brothers. He also does not fight the sick, as when he stopped himself from attacking Alfredo when he found out that the latter was ill from tuberculosis, the same that killed Giovanni's father. Later on in the series, Giovanni and his companions became more supportive for the Black Brothers.

How to Be Popular is written as a stand-alone book. It was published in July 2006 in the United States. It has since been published in 14 other countries. Plot summary Steph Landry has been the target of jokes since sixth grade when she spilt a red Super Big Gulp on Lauren Moffat's white D&G; skirt. In response, Lauren coined the phrase \\"Don't be such a Steph Landry\\" to ensure Steph never lives it down. As time has passed people have forgotten both the incident and the individual, but the phrase is widely used in the small town. This has caused Steph to feel like a social pariah. Steph has since been content to hang out with her best friends Jason and Becca, also social outcasts, but as she enters the eleventh grade, she wants more out of high school. Luckily, she finds a copy of an old book titled none other than How to be Popular while cleaning out Jason's grandmother's attic. The book is full of useful tips. She follows the book's advice and begins the school year with flat-ironed hair and a new attitude. Steph is determined to be confident and enthusiastic about school. She sits with new people at lunch and organizes a talent auction. Steph does not anticipate Lauren's anger at her sudden rise in popularity, or Jason's confusion and shock at her behaviour. As her popularity grows, Steph is forced to make difficult choices about who and what is truly important to her. A minor plot arch of the impending wedding of Jason's grandmother and Steph's grandfather. Steph's mother is against the wedding and causes familial contention. Steph's mother's sixth pregnancy also plays out as a minor plot line. Format How to Be Popular is in the form of a diary from the perspective of Steph Landry. Each diary entry begins with a time and date. The diary format means that Steph Landry is both the narrator as well as the writer for this story. Each event is told through her eyes as she reflects upon them. The reader is able to understand exactly how the character thinks and feels in the intimate form of a diary. The format, therefore, creates a connection between the reader and Steph but it also makes her an unreliable narrator. Each event is told with a view skewed towards the main character because the format is a personal retelling. Meg Cabot has written in this format for several other books including her The Princess Diaries series. Themes How to Be Popular utilizes many themes that are common among Meg Cabot's writings. The overlying theme is one of popularity and acceptance. Throughout the book many characters try to tell Steph that popularity is not as important as individuality. In the end Steph realizes this idea of individuality is far better than the popularity that she has been striving for. Many of Meg Cabot's books also try to expose the problems of conformity to achieve acceptance and popularity. The author often tries to expose the importance of staying true to yourself. Throughout the novel several characters are exposed to this idea and the main conclusion shares this message of individuality. Other themes include romance (and the idea of The One), sexuality, parental irresponsibility, friendship, and finance. These themes are hallmarks of YA literature. This book explores these themes as part of Steph's struggle to find her place and herself. Reception \\"Cabot deserves her reputation as one of teen chick lit's most entertaining authors. This endearingly funny book looks at the pain of feeling unpopular. Steph and Jason's friendship will have readers (books too) laughing and rooting for her to see what is right in front of her. Public and high school libraries will definitely want to add it to their collection.\\" - VOYA \\"A heartwarming, funny tale\\" - The Daily Telegraph\\"Pasty-skinned, kind-hearted, brainy but cross\\" - The Daily Telegraph New York Public Library Books for the Teen Age Award How To Be Popular - HarperCollins Awards *How to Be Popular spent 9 weeks on the NYT best seller list for Children's Chapter Books *It is also a Publisher's Weekly and a USA Today Best Seller *It has been a Book Sense pick *It was selected in 2007 as a \\"Book for Teen Age\\" by New York Public Library References Category:2006 American novels Category:Novels by Meg Cabot Category:American young adult novels Category:HarperCollins books ","title":"How to Be Popular"},{"id":"6877205","text":"U.S. Route 19 (US 19) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that runs from Memphis, Florida to Erie, Pennsylvania. In Virginia, the highway runs between two pairs of twin cities: Bristol, Tennessee and Bristol, Virginia, at the Virginia‚ÄìTennessee state line, and Bluefield, Virginia and Bluefield, West Virginia, at the Virginia‚ÄìWest Virginia state line. Between its endpoints, US 19 has lengthy concurrencies with US 11, US 58 Alternate, and US 460 during its course connecting Abingdon, Lebanon, and Tazewell within Washington, Russell, and Tazewell counties in Southwest Virginia. Route description Bristol to Abingdon US 19 enters Virginia concurrent with US 11E at State Street, which follows the Virginia‚ÄìTennessee state line as the main street of Bristol, Virginia to the north and Bristol, Tennessee to the south and forms the easternmost part of SR 1 west of the intersection. The two U.S. Highways and SR 381 head north along Commonwealth Avenue, a four-lane divided highway that intersects Goode Street one block north of the state line; Goode Street carries US 421 and both US 11 Truck and US 19 Truck through the Bristol Commercial Historic District. US 19, US 11E, US 421, and SR 381 meet the southern end of SR 113 at separate intersections: Cumberland Street carries northbound SR 113 east and Sycamore Street carries the westbound direction. The four highways continue north to east‚Äìwest Euclid Avenue, where US 11E has its northern terminus. SR 381 continues north along Commonwealth Avenue to the southern end of I-381, a spur south from I-81. Westbound Euclid Avenue heads west carrying northbound US 421 and southbound US 11W. US 19 turns east to join US 11 on eastbound Euclid Avenue. US 19 and US 11 head east as a two-lane divided boulevard through a residential area. The street becomes undivided shortly before the U.S. Highways reach the northern end of SR 113 (Moore Street), which heads south toward Virginia Intermont College and downtown Bristol. US 19 and US 11 continue northeast on Lee Highway, which here and in much of Virginia is a three-lane road with center turning lane. The highway meets I-81 and US 58 at a diamond interchange with a rakish angle. US 19 and US 11 pass under Norfolk Southern Railway's Pulaski District and cross Beaver Creek before leaving the city of Bristol. The two highways continue northeast through Washington County, where they pass Virginia Highlands Airport before entering the town of Abingdon. At the west end of town, US 19 and US 11 intersect SR 140 (Jonesboro Road), a connector between the U.S. Highways and I-81 that also serves Virginia Highlands Community College. The U.S. highways continue east as Main Street, which passes under the Norfolk Southern rail line before US 19 turns north onto Porterfield Highway. Abingdon to Bluefield View north along US 19 at SR 80 in Rosedale US 19 heads northwest as a four-lane divided highway that is joined by US 58 Alternate (Russell Road) before leaving the town of Abingdon. The two highways cross Walker Mountain and briefly follow the North Fork Holston River before following Moccasin Creek through Moccasin Gap between Clinch Mountain to the west and Brumley Mountain to the east. US 19 and US 58 Alternate enter Russell County at Little Moccasin Gap a short distance east of where the highways diverge at Hansonville. US 19 continues northeast by the village of Willis before reaching Lebanon. At the southwest corner of the town, the U.S. Highway has a diamond interchange with US 19 Business (Main Street) and SR 660 (Mountain Road). US 19 has a diamond interchange with SR 654 before meeting the eastern end of US 19 Business (Trail of the Lonesome Pine) east of Big Cedar Creek. US 19 continues northeast as the Trail of the Lonesome Pine, which has an intersection with SR 80 (Hayters Gap Road) at the hamlet of Smithfield. The two highways run concurrently to Rosedale, where SR 80 heads north as Red Bud Highway. At Southwest Virginia Community College at the Russell‚ÄìTazewell County line, US 19 veers north through Wardell and crosses the Little River. The U.S. Highway curves east again and meets US 460 (Governor George C. Peery Highway) at Claypool Hill. US 19 and US 460 parallel the Clinch River and Norfolk Southern Railway's Clinch Valley District through Pounding Mill and Cliffield to the hamlet of Pisgah, where US 19 Business and US 460 Business head south as Crab Orchard Road toward Frog Level. US 19 and US 460 become a freeway through the town of Tazewell that has diamond interchanges with SR 16 Alternate (Fairground Road) and SR 16 (Tazewell Avenue). The freeway crosses the railroad and the Clinch River at its partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 61 (Riverside Drive). North of Tazewell, US 19 and US 460 have a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 645 (Cauitts Creek Road) and SR 678 (Market Street) before meeting the eastern end of the U.S. Highways' business routes, named Fincastle Turnpike, at a partial interchange where the highways cross over the Clinch Valley rail line. US 19 and US 460 diverge as the local and express routes, respectively, through the twin towns of Bluefield, Virginia and Bluefield, West Virginia. US 19 heads northeast from its trumpet interchange with US 460 and crosses the rail line into the town of Bluefield, where the highway reduces to two lanes and follows Virginia Avenue. After closely paralleling the rail line, at Greever Avenue, the U.S. Highway makes a right-angle turn north to continue on Virginia Avenue, then veers east, passing under the rail line at its junction with the Pocahontas District rail line. US 19 has a pair of right-angle turns at its crossing of Beaverpond Creek just west of its intersection with SR 102 (College Avenue). The U.S. Highway passes through downtown Bluefield, Virginia before crossing the state line into Bluefield, West Virginia, where the highway continues as Bluefield Avenue. History What is now US 19 was part of the original 1918 state highway system., Proposed \\"State Highway System\\" for Virginia, as Recommended by the State Roads Committee, January, 1918 It was part of State Route 10 from Bristol to Abingdon, a spur of SR 10 (designated State Route 106 in the 1923 renumbering and State Route 110 in the 1928 renumbering) from Abingdon to Hansonville, another spur of SR 10 from Hansonville to Lebanon, and State Route 11 from Lebanon to Bluefield. The spur from Hansonville to Lebanon was initially designated State Route 10Y. In the 1923 renumbering it was renumbered State Route 112 (as a spur of SR 11), and in the 1928 renumbering it became State Route 131. US 19 was added in the late 1920s, and in the 1933 renumbering the state routes were dropped.

Willie learns his formula could have deadly side effects, and now he must discover an antidote to return his grandparents to their older but healthy bodies. Through their experience as teenagers again Gene and Cat realize they are still in love with each other but Cat is reluctant to believe Gene's feelings are genuine as she is still heartbroken that he chose to leave her for a job in Australia 20 years ago, the reason for their divorce. In Sydney's room, she and Cat finally have a long and heartfelt talk. Sydney admits she's homesick for California and her old friends. She hates Connecticut and the bullying she is subjected to by Ashley and her friends because Ashley's brother, Todd, is interested in her. During that time, Cat admits her earlier experience with Ashley. However unlike Sydney, she was able to stand up to Ashley and earn her begrudging respect. Meanwhile, Gene who has had time to reflect on his life choices realizes his mistake of leaving his family and bids farewell to his life as a teenager and the friends he has made, and goes to the dance with Ashley in hopes of reconciling with Cat. Meanwhile, at the dance, Sydney and Cat arrive and find Gene with Ashley. Gene and Cat share a dance where they reconcile, before Cat passes out due to the side effects of the soap. Willie arrives with the antidote as Gene carries Cat to the school's pool. Ashley, furious that Gene ditched her for Cat, cuts them off before they can save her. Sydney, having had enough of Ashley and her bullying, punches her in the face. As she and Willie leave to save their grandparents, everyone applauds Sydney for giving Ashley what she deserved. Willie tosses the antidote in the pool and Gene and Cat jump in. Gene asks Cat to marry him again after their crazy experience. Cat says yes, but then the happiness is interrupted by Sydney and Willie's parents, Barry and Monique (Tonya Lee Williams), coming home from a trip. The parents are surprised to see Cat and Gene reconciled and Monique tells him that they should let them babysit next time. Sydney asks Monique if she could help with the wedding plans and she agrees. A call comes in and Willie calls for Barry who tells him that he's in the shower with the soap (which they forgot to get rid of). Of course, Sydney and Willie now have to stop their father from using the soap.

The show was directed by K≈çz≈ç Kusuba, with Michiru Shimada and Mayumi Koyama writing the scripts, Masaru ≈åshima designing the characters and Katsuhisa Hattori composing the music. The story is adapted from Sans Famille, an 1878 French novel, written by Hector Malot (adapted to anime in 1977 as Nobody's Boy: Remi); this version made major changes from the book, including changing the sex of the main character and the \\"Swan\\" chapter, along with many other main events. The first broadcast was on September 1, 1996. The show was canceled by Fuji TV because of low ratings and it ended on March 23, 1997, with a low count of 23 episodes. The complete series of 26 episodes was later shown by the anime satellite television network, Animax, which translated and dubbed the series into English for broadcast across its English-language networks in Southeast Asia and South Asia under the title Remi, Nobody's Girl, as well as other languages including Arabic which was named ÿØÿ±Ÿàÿ® ÿ±ŸäŸÖŸä (Remi's road), and was dubbed in the Venus Center in 2001 and broadcast on the Spacetoon channel where it received success in the Middle East. In the Philippines, it was shown in 1999 on ABS-CBN, sometime after airing the earlier TMS (boy) version. Story Remi, Nobody's Girl tells the story of Remi, a cheerful and tender-hearted girl, who is an excellent singer and lives in the French country town of Chavanon with her mother. One day her father returns to the town after a long period working in a city. She discovers that she was a \\"foundling\\" or an abandoned child and was adopted by Mother Barberin. Her adoptive father Jerome leaves to work in Paris and expects Mother Barberin to send Remi to the workhouse. He returns 10 years later, finds that Remi is still there, and becomes furious and Remi is sold to an evil slave trader. Vitalis, a strolling entertainer, tricks the slave trader and frees Remi. Vitalis discovers her talent for singing and takes her in with his troupe. Remi starts her journey with Vitalis and his troupe of animals such as the monkey Joli-C≈ìur and the dogs Capi, Dolce, and Zerbino. She meets a variety of different people and strives to help everyone she meets, such as saving a man from a fire, and rescuing her dog with the help of a sailor. Also on her journeys with Vitalis and his company she must endure and overcome many difficulties while looking for her real family, particularly at one point where Vitalis is falsely accused of arson, loses his cart in the fire and is imprisoned. At this point, Mrs Milligan takes pity on Remi and takes her to her house, where Remi meets Mrs Milligan's son Arthur. After Vitalis is released, he is forced to sell his donkey as they are broke. He asks Mrs Milligan to take care of Remi and decided to leave her, however Remi, unable to bear the thought of leaving Mr. Vitalis alone, runs after him as she wants to provide him company. At this point it becomes clear that Vitalis is visibly unwell. During a performance, Joli-C≈ìur is hit by a chariot and nearly dies. Unfortunately the village they were currently staying in lacked the presence of a doctor, let alone a veterinarian. With Remi pleading with Mr Vitalis, he agrees and decides to brave through the snow storm to take Joli-C≈ìur to another village for treatment. Along the way, the snowstorm intensifies and they are forced to take shelter. Sadly for their troupe, they become a target for wolves. They manage to chase the wolves away, but not before Dolce and Zerbino's die trying to protect them, with only Capi, Joli-C≈ìur and Vitalis left along with Remi. The wolves also injure Vitalis. Heartbroken, Remi begins to cry, but Vitalis urges her to keep moving forward, to ensure that Dolce and Zerbino's death does not go to vain. Along the way however, Vitalis' condition worsens and he is unable to proceed. He urges Remi to rush to the city of Paris to provide treatment for Joli-C≈ìur, and luckily he survives. But Vitalis' condition has worsened and he passes away, telling a heartbroken Remi to always be cheerful and to always keep moving forward. After Vitalis' death, she tries to meet Gaspard in Paris, who is Vitalis' acquaintance. However, when she reaches Gaspard's house, she finds out that the person Mr. Vitalis was talking about was actually Gaspard's uncle, who had died due to flu. She also meets the homeless children that he treats like slaves. She became friends with all other homeless children, due to her compassionate and joyful nature, and she protects the other children from Gaspards corporate punishments. She stops Mattia from stealing money through pickpocketing and enjoys listening to him play violin. She helps improve the relationships between all the children in the house and is always the first one to take initiative while helping others, such as when one of the children fall ill. She also meets a travelling troupe who have a disobedient daughter called Cosette and manages to get her to warm up to her parents. Upon learning that Remi is the long-lost daughter of Milligan and Arthur's older sister, Gaspard's decides to kidnap her for ransom, and Mattia tries his best to protect her from him and his cohorts with the help of Capi and Joli-C≈ìur. After Gaspard is arrested and jailed, Remi reunites with her real family, and Milligan decides to adopt the homeless children. In the end, Remi decides to visit her adoptive mother in Chavanon after reuniting with her real family, while Mattia wants to study hard and become a famous violin player so that he can become a better man for Remi. The two are last seen watching the sunset, remembering Vitalis and his dogs.  Characters  Vitalis Troupe ; :* :* A bright and energetic 10-year-old girl who is an excellent singer.

This contrasts with non-traditional approaches to math education. A comparison of traditional and reform mathematics curricula in an eighth-grade classroom Education, Summer 2003 by Alsup, John K., Sprigler, Mark J. Traditional mathematics education has been challenged by several reform movements over the last several decades, notably new math, a now largely abandoned and discredited set of alternative methods, and most recently reform or standards-based mathematics based on NCTM standards, which is federally supported and has been widely adopted, but subject to ongoing criticism. Traditional methods The topics and methods of traditional mathematics are well documented in books and open source articles of many nations and languages. Major topics covered include: * Elementary arithmetic * Addition * Carry * Subtraction * Multiplication * Multiplication table * Division * Long division * Arithmetic with fractions * Lowest common denominator * Arithmetic mean * Volume In general, traditional methods are based on direct instruction where students are shown one standard method of performing a task such as decimal addition, in a standard sequence. A task is taught in isolation rather than as only a part of a more complex project. By contrast, reform books often postpone standard methods until students have the necessary background to understand the procedures. Students in modern curricula often explore their own methods for multiplying multi-digit numbers, deepening their understanding of multiplication principles before being guided to the standard algorithm. Parents sometimes misunderstand this approach to mean that the children will not be taught formulas and standard algorithms and therefore there are occasional calls for a return to traditional methods. Such calls became especially intense during the 1990s. (See Math wars.) A traditional sequence early in the 20th century would leave topics such as algebra or geometry entirely for high school, and statistics until college, but newer standards introduce the basic principles needed for understanding these topics very early. For example, most American standards now require children to learn to recognize and extend patterns in kindergarten. This very basic form of algebraic reasoning is extended in elementary school to recognize patterns in functions and arithmetic operations, such as the distributive law, a key principle for doing high school algebra. Most curricula today encourage children to reason about geometric shapes and their properties in primary school as preparation for more advanced reasoning in a high school geometry course. Current standards require children to learn basic statistical ideas such as organizing data with bar charts. More sophisticated concepts such as algebraic expressions with numbers and letters, geometric surface area and statistical means and medians occur in sixth grade in the newest standards. Criticism of traditional math Criticism of traditional mathematics instruction originates with advocates of alternative methods of instruction, such as Reform mathematics. These critics cite studies, such as The Harmful Effects of Algorithms in Grades 1‚Äì4, which found specific instances where traditional math instruction was less effective than alternative methods. Advocates of alternative methods argue that traditional methods of instruction over-emphasize memorization and repetition, and fail to promote conceptual understanding or to present math as creative or exploratory. Critics also sometimes cite the fact that history of mathematics often focuses on European advancements and methods developed by men, thus ignoring equity issues and potentially alienating minorities and women. The general consensus of large-scale studies that compare traditional mathematics with reform mathematics is that students in both curricula learn basic skills to about the same level as measured by traditional standardized tests, but the reform mathematics students do better on tasks requiring conceptual understanding and problem solving.NCTM research brief: Selecting the Right Curriculum Critics of traditional methods note that only a small percentage of students achieve the highest levels of mathematics achievement such as calculus. Some argue that too few students master even algebra. The use of calculators became common in United States math instruction in the 1980s and 1990s. Critics have argued that calculator work, when not accompanied by a strong emphasis on the importance of showing work, allows students to get the answers to many problems without understanding the math involved. However, others such as Conrad Wolfram argue for a more radical use of computer-based math in a complete departure from traditional math. Mathematics educators, such as Alan Schoenfeld, question whether traditional mathematics actually teach mathematics as understood by professional mathematicians and other experts. Instead, Schoenfeld implies, students come to perceive mathematics as a list of disconnected rules that must be memorized and parroted. Indeed, research suggests that certain approaches to traditional mathematics instruction impresses upon students an image of mathematics as closed to imagination and discovery, an image in clear opposition to how experts view the field. Traditional mathematics texts In general, math textbooks which focus on instruction in standard arithmetic methods can be categorized as a traditional math textbook. Reform math textbooks will often focus on conceptual understanding, usually avoiding immediate instruction of the standard algorithms and frequently promoting student exploration and discovery of the relevant mathematics. The following current texts are often cited as good for those wishing for a traditional approach, often also favored by homeschoolers. * Saxon math * Modern Curriculum Press  Recent trends  In the United States there has been general cooling of the \\"Math wars\\" during the first decade of the 21st century as reform organizations such as the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and national committees, such as the National Mathematics Advisory Panel convened by George W. Bush, have concluded that elements of both traditional mathematics (such as mastery of basic skills and some direct instruction) and reform mathematics (such as some student- centered instruction and an emphasis on conceptual understanding and problem- solving skills) need to be combined for best instruction. The Common Core Standards, which have been adopted by most states since 2011, adopt such a mediating position for curricula, requiring students to achieve both procedural fluency and conceptual understanding. The Common Core does not endorse any particular teaching method, but does suggest students solve word problems using a variety of representations.

Biography Spagnoli was born of a Spanish family that had settled in Mantua, the northern Italian city that gave him his most commonly used English name. He was the eldest son of Peter Spagnoli, a Spanish nobleman at the court of Mantua.Zimmerman, Benedict. \\"Blessed Baptista Mantuanus.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 24 December 2018 He studied there under the humanists Giorgio Merula and Gregorio Tifernate, and subsequently at Padua under Paolo Bagelardi, who was famous for weaving the other liberal arts into his lectures on philosophy. The bad example of his schoolfellows led him into irregularities. He fell into the hands of usurers and, returning home, was turned out of his father's house owing to some calumny. A mystically based sense of calling led Mantuan to enter a reformed branch of the Carmelite order in Ferrara in 1463. During the 1470s he studied theology and taught at the monastery of San Martino in Bologna. He was ordained at Bologna. The Duke of Mantua entrusted him with the education of his children. First elected vicar general of his congregation of reformed Carmelites in 1483, Mantuan spent most of the decade in Rome. There he acquired the monastery of San Crisogono for his branch of the order, pleaded for Carmelite reforms before Pope Sixtus IV, and preached in a sermon before Pope Innocent VIII against corruption within the Papal Curia. In 1489 Mantuan traveled to Loreto, a town on the Adriatic coast where a shrine with the reputed house of the Virgin Mary had been put under Carmelite governance. In 1493 he was appointed director of studies at the reformed Carmelite monastery in Mantua. There he participated in an informal academy founded by Isabella d' Este, Marchioness of Mantua, and overseen at times by Baldassare Castiglione and other famous humanist writers and philosophers. In an election overseen in 1513 by Sigismondo Gonzaga, Mantuan's old pupil and subsequently Cardinal Protector of the Carmelites, he was chosen as general of the whole order. Ill health bedeviled him through much of his life, however, and he died at Mantua early in 1516. Works and influence Historia ecclesiae Lauretanae, 1489 Besides his sermon preached before Innocent VIII, Mantuan's most notable works in prose include De patientia, a rambling discourse on physical and spiritual illness that includes an early allusion to Columbus' discovery of America, and De vita beata, a dialogue on the religious life that he wrote soon after entering the Carmelite order. He is also known for his Opus aureum in Thomistas, an early humanist critique of the late medieval philosophy and theology associated with Thomas Aquinas. Mantuan wrote over 55,000 lines of verse, and it is largely through his poetry that he became famous and influential on the cultures of early modern Europe. De calamitatibus temporum was widely reprinted in the early sixteenth century. A three-book attack on the waywardness of the times, the poem includes a passage on Papal corruption that Martin Luther used prominently in Against the Roman Papacy, An Institution of the Devil, his last great polemic directed against the Curia. Mantuan's Parthenice Mariana initiated a series of seven hagiographic epic poems in which he celebrated in epic language the lives of Mary as well as Catherine of Alexandria and other Roman Catholic saints. The first successful humanist attempt to do so, these poems set a precedent for epic treatments of religious subjects as diverse as Jacopo Sannazaro's De partu virginis and John Milton's Paradise Lost. It is on the basis of Mantuan‚Äôs hagiographic epics that Desiderius Erasmus made his pronouncement that as a ‚ÄúChristian Virgil\\" the Italian poet would eventually be seen as a greater writer than Virgil. Mantuan‚Äôs greatest success and most influential work was his Adulescentia. In this collection of ten Latin eclogues, he brought together the characters, situations, and themes of Virgilian pastoral with a strain of religious allegory rooted in Carmelite spirituality and a rustic realism compounded of personal observation and the conventions of medieval pastoral art. Schoolmasters commonly used the poems because of their relatively easy Latin and attractive subject matter (the opening eclogues deal with love, a topic one educator notes of interest to all young men). An attack on Papal corruption in one of the poems made Mantuan's collection an especially popular text in Protestant England. Partly because of their use in the schools, Mantuan's eclogues had a profound effect on English literature in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The collection was twice translated into English, by George Turberville in 1567 and Thomas Harvey in 1656. Early in the sixteenth century Alexander Barclay made adaptations of Mantuan's fifth and sixth eclogues, and a notorious attack on women in his fourth eclogue found numerous English translations and paraphrases during the seventeenth century. As \\"good old Mantuan\\" he was memorialized as the foolish Holofernes' favorite author in William Shakespeare's Love's Labor‚Äôs Lost.Kallendorf, Craig. \\"Battista Mantovano (Battista Spagnoli)\\", 24 May 2017 A line from his sixth eclogue is echoed in Winter's song at the end of the same play. And his rustic realism stands behind the world of Corin and William in Shakespeare's As You Like It. Unsurprisingly, Mantuan's attack on corruption within the church reverberated through English literature. Eventually it shifted from being used to attack the Papal Curia to become in John Milton's \\"Lycidas\\" a sanction for his indictment in pastoral poetry of \\"our corrupted\\" English clergy. As a dominant model for the English eclogue, Mantuan's \\"Adulescenta\\" heavily influenced Edmund Spenser's Shepheardes Calender. Overall his rustic stylistic decorum sanctioned the English poet's experiments with diction and rough rhythms. Spenser's complaint about the neglect of poets and poetry in \\"October\\" draws thematically from Mantuan's fifth eclogue. The Italian poet's condemnation of Papal corruption is used in Spenser's \\"September\\" to indict pillaging the wealth of the English Church by Elizabeth and her courtiers. The winter world of February, drawn from Mantuan's sixth eclogue, has been seen to proclaim a harsh \\"Mantuanesque\\" world that Spenser set in his poems against the softer world of Arcadian pastoral. He was beatified in 1890, and his feast day was assigned to 23 March. His relics are in Saint Peter's Cathedral, Mantua. References Sources * Baptista Spagnuoli Mantuanus.

It is a sampurna raga traditionally performed in the morning and also as the beginning piece in concerts. It is the defining raga of its own Thaat. Raga Kalingda in Hindustani and Ragam Mayamalavagowla in Carnatic music have the same scale as Raga Bhairav, although the moods they create can be quite different due to the way they are expounded. History Bhairav raga is an ancient raga that is considered to be extremely old and originated many centuries ago. The origin of Bhairav raga is disputed. According to some musicians, Bhairav raga was the first raga that originated from the mouth of Lord Shiva. While some musicians argue that Bhairav raga originated from the mouth of Lord Surya. That's why it is sung in daytime. Bhairava is one of the names of Shiva especially in his powerful form as a naked ascetic with matted locks and body smeared with ashes. The ragas too have some of these masculine and ascetic attributes in its form and compositions. The Bhairav raga itself is extremely vast and allows a huge number of note combinations and a great range of emotional qualities from valour to peace. There are many variations based on it including (but not restricted to) Ahir Bhairav, Alam Bhairav, Anand Bhairav, Bairagi Bhairav, Mohini Bhairav Beehad Bhairav, Bhavmat Bhairav, Devata Bhairav, Gauri Bhairav, Hijaz Bhairav, Shivmat Bhairav, Nat Bhairav, Bibhas, Ramkali, Gunkali, Zeelaf, Jogiya (raga), Saurashtra Bhairav, Bangal Bhairav, Komal Bhairav, Mangal Bhairav, Kaushi Bhairav, Bhatiyari Bhairav, Virat Bhairav, Kabiri Bhairav, Prabhat Bhairav, Roopkali, Bakula Bhairav, Hussaini Bhairav, Kalingda, Devaranjani, Asa Bhairav, Jaun Bhairav, and Bhairav. Theory Bhairav is grave in mood and suggests seriousness, introversion as well as devotional attitude. It shares its notes with Ahir Bhairav which has a sombre temperament.

The raga comes across as a musical entity with mood of meditation, philosophical depth and emotional richness. Samay (Time) Bhairav is an early morning (pratham prahar) raag. Seasonality Bhairav is one of few ragas that can be sung in any season. Rasa Bhairav is typically performed with a peaceful, serious, and serene mood.

One year later, the council for the new North Burnett Region expressed formal regret for the harm done and agreed to discuss with the Wakka Wakka. The springs are usually dry, but local bore irrigation has also reduced the available water.

Historically it has had three forms; the less ornamented type is described here. In the Ragmala, Devagandhari is a ragini of Malkaunsa. Today it belongs to the Asavari thata. Its mood is one of prayerful supplication presenting a heroic effect. The texts set to this raga reveal a heroic search for these qualities which lead one to the Lord.

He is perhaps more famous for the notorious nature of his death. The first episode of the second series of the British TV show Sick Note is named for him. Life and music Kotzwara was born in Prague, Bohemia and was something of a nomad. He travelled around Europe and performed with various orchestras. His mature career was based in England, where his compositions were published from 1775 onwards. These include string quartets, serenades and string trios. In London he played in the Concerts of Antient Music, in the Handel Commemoration of 1791 and in the orchestra of the King's Theatre. Cover of The Battle of Prague (Boston: Gottlieb Graupner, early 19th century) The only piece of his to have achieved renown is The Battle of Prague, a composition based on the 1757 Battle of Prague, in which the Kingdom of Prussia fought the Habsburg Monarchy. The Battle of Prague was a popular piece of music during the late 18th and 19th centuries, with Mark Twain mentioning the piece in his books Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and A Tramp Abroad, and by Thomas Hardy in A Pair Of Blue Eyes. A similar piece, The Siege of Quebec, often attributed to Kotzwara, is probably an arrangement by de Krift using assorted materials of Kotzwara. Death On September 2, 1791 while he was in London, Kotzwara visited a prostitute named Susannah Hill in Vine Street, Westminster. After dinner with her in her lodgings, Kotzwara paid her two shillings and requested that she cut off his testicles. Hill refused to do so. Kotzwara then tied a ligature around the doorknob, the other end fastened around his neck, and proceeded to have sexual intercourse with Hill. After it was over, Kotzwara was dead. His is one of the first recorded deaths from erotic asphyxiation. Susannah Hill was tried on September 16 at the Old Bailey, charged with Kotzwara's murder but was acquitted as the jury accepted her testimony about the nature of Kotzwara's death. The court records of the case were supposedly destroyed in order to avoid a public scandal, though it is likely that some kind of copy was made. It is believed that this copy was used to produce a pamphlet about the incident, including Hill's account of the event. A 2005 radio competition organised by the Radio Prague station led a listener to reveal that these court records had in fact not been destroyed, and somehow found their way to the Francis Countway Library of Medicine in Boston. In 1984 a paper about Kotzwara's death was published in the American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology, entitled \\"The sticky end of Frantisek Koczwara, composer of The Battle of Prague\\". A pamphlet, Modern Propensities, with details of the trial and an article about auto-erotic asphyxiation was published in London about 1797.

Founded in 1933, the AYF became a global Armenian organization and stands on five pillars that guide its activities: Educational, Hai Tahd, Social, Athletic and Cultural. Moreover, the AYF promotes social democratic values and a fraternal attitude of respect for ideas and individuals amongst its membership. Unity and cooperation are essential traits that allow members of the organization to work together to realize the AYF's objectives. The AYF is a full member of International Union of Socialist Youth and Young European Socialists. History Early years On January 14, 1933, which is marked as the founding date of the Armenian Youth Federation, the ARF Central Committee of America decided to create a national youth organization by combining the existing ones and setting up new chapters where such groups did not exist. After the decision was made, an invitation was sent to representatives of interested youth groups on the East Coast to join a conference on Sunday, July 16, 1933, in the old Hairenik Hall in Boston, MA. The conference was to discuss the unification of the interested youth groups. Forty youths from the Massachusetts Armenian communities of Boston, Brockton, Chelsea, Lawrence, Lynn, Watertown, Whitinsville, and Worcester were present at the conference. This conference decided to hold a convention in June 1934, at which time the elections of the first Central Executive of the AYF were to be held. They also decided the ARF should appoint a committee of seniors to assist the organization for the coming year. In the 1933-34 fiscal year many new chapters were formed across the country. It was due to the inspirational teachings of charismatic General Garegin Nzhdeh that AYF attracted thousands of members and supporters during that one year. Forty chapters were represented during the first AYF Convention that took place at the Hairenik Hall in 1934. It was decided then that the organization was to be named the ARF Tseghagrons (or \\"young pledgers\\"), which was concerned with stopping assimilation and instilling the youth with Armenian pride. But the main goal remained to work against Kemalist Turkey and the Soviet Union for the establishment of a free, independent, and united Armenia. The convention also elected the first Central Executive composed of five members. The members of the Central Executive were Hamparsoum Gelanian, John Der Hovanessian, Hagop Hagopian, Arthur Giragosian and K. Merton Bozoian. Soon after the first Convention, the Armenian Youth Federation expanded north of the border, forming its first Canadian chapter in St. Catharines, Ontario, in 1934. The Armenian Youth Federation worked to define the organization during its first years. Chapters were organizing programs such as the drum and bugle corps, theater troupes and charity service work like Boston's \\"Siamanto Santa\\". The Armenian Youth Federation, which was often playing the role of an Armenian school, gave priority to its educational program. Each of the forty chapters organized \\"educationals\\" on the chapter level. The Central Executive provided lists of educational topics, printed a songbook of Armenian patriotic songs, published the book Highlights in Armenian History, written by the first AYF executive secretary James Mandalian, and produced biographies of historical figures. Chapters would conduct examinations at the end of each fiscal year, the results of which would be sent to the AYF central office to be graded. Individual participation was encouraged by a three-point educational plan, which was conceived by Harry Sachaklian. In 1935 the AYF established a scholarship fund for worthy and needy students who were pursuing higher education. One of the centerpieces of the AYF today is the Olympics, which began in 1934 in Brockton and immediately became an annual tradition. The Worcester \\"Aram\\" Chapter won every single event at the first Olympics setting an unsurpassable record. Other aspects of the athletic program included boxing, wrestling, baseball, soccer, and basketball, for which numerous inter-chapter tournaments were organized. World War II In 1941, the organization changed its name from the ARF Tseghakrons to the Armenian Youth Federation. This change was necessary because the name \\"Tseghakrons\\" was difficult to manage among non-Armenian speakers and it was being maliciously misinterpreted in some quarters. From that point on, the organization in the United States would be known as the AYF. Life during the Great Depression and Second World War presented many new challenges for the Armenian community in America. Although faced with these additional challenges the AYF was able to continue growing, both in size and nature. The greatest effect of war on the AYF was the entrance of many AYF members into the US Armed Forces. In 1944‚Äì45, it is estimated that over 1000 AYF members were in the Armed Forces. Chapters sent letters, issues of Hairenik Weekly, local news, packages, and presents to members in uniform. Also during this time, the AYF raised a combined total of approximately three quarters of a million dollars in war bonds and stamps. This campaign funded the purchase of a B-25 Mitchell and a B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft for the Allied war effort. The AYF held a testimonial banquet in Detroit on June 29, 1946, to honor the members returning to the US from the War and to pay tribute to those forty AYF members who had been killed during the war. During 1942-1946 more than 800 youth joined the ranks of the Armenian Youth Federation. The AYF created the \\"Song of the Year\\" program, which helped members learn Armenian National and Revolutionary songs, and organized essay contests, which spurred a good deal of research. Also, the first edition of the well-known AYF \\"Blue Book\\" series was published in the 1945-46 fiscal year. With the end of the World War, AYF activity increased. Members returning from the war provided additional manpower to the organization, but this increase was short lived. The post-war years were followed by an era of declining membership due to geographic and demographic changes in the community. Despite these changes the AYF laid the foundation for another generation of youth. New programs were added to AYF's already wide array of activities, while established programs grew both in size and scope. 1950s During the 1950s the \\"Blue Book\\" educational series focused primarily on Armenian History, but also covered geography, culture and customs, the arts, and other subjects. Complete with maps and photographs, these \\"Blue Books\\" formed a sound foundation for the educational program. One of the greatest achievements of the post war years was the creation of the AYF Junior Organization in 1948. The Junior movement soon spread throughout the country and soon rivaled the Senior organization with its own \\"Blue Book\\" program, Olympics, conferences, essay and literature contests, and more. Also ranking as one of the period's outstanding accomplishments was the opening of Camp Haiastan in Franklin, Massachusetts, in 1951. Starting off slowly, and with separate boys and girls sessions, the camp grew gradually throughout the 1950s, becoming co-ed in 1957 and breaking the 50-camper mark the same year. A year later, the Armenian Youth Federation marked its 25th anniversary with celebrations great and small throughout the US and Canada. These activities helped generate enthusiasm in the ranks and revitalize the organization as a new decade approached. 1960s The 1960s were a time of great change and growth for the AYF. By this time, some of the smaller and more geographically isolated communities began to see the beginning of the end as Armenians relocated to other, larger metropolitan areas. The role of AYF forever changed from being a gathering point for local Armenian youth to serving as a substitute for an Armenian lifestyle that was no longer day-to-day. One of the single biggest changes to occur in the 1960s was the emergence of political activity in the Armenian community. During this time, there were important changes occurring on the Armenian political scene as the 50th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide ushered a new era of demonstrative political action, reiterating the demands for just reparations and the return of Turkish- occupied but historically Armenian lands. 1970s and 1980s By the early 1970s, the AYF had become even more dynamic and continued to grow. Some of the larger Junior and Senior chapters held over 100 members. In 1970, the Armenian Youth Federation Camp was established for members living on the west coast. For the first couple of years, the AYF rented different locations suitable for summer camp. The AYF Camp Committee decided to acquire its own place in the San Gabriel Mountains. The YMCA Camp Big Pines site happened to be available and very much suitable to the needs of the Armenian Youth Federation, because it was close to the Los Angeles area, and easily assessable to the San Joaquin Valley. In early 1978, negotiations were conducted for a ninety-year lease. The camp was purchased for $80,000. In earlier years, five regional structures (New England, Mid-Atlantic, Mid-West, California, and Canada) had been created to address the problems brought on by the organization's vast expanse. By the 1970s, however, the obstacles of geography had become overwhelming. The 1973-74 fiscal year saw the split of the AYF into three separate administrative entities: Western U.S., Eastern U.S., and Canada. Later, the Canadian branch dropped the AYF name altogether and became the Armenian Revolutionary Federation Youth Organization of Canada (A.R.F.Y.O.C.). During the early 1980s, the AYF had largely become a political organization that coordinated events such as hunger strikes and demonstrations to protest against the denial of the Armenian Genocide of 1915 by the Turkish Government and the rest of the world. Modern times In the late 1980s, the AYF added onto its title, and became the Armenian Youth Federation-Youth Organization Of The Armenian Revolutionary Federation (AYF-YOARF). In the early 1990s the AYF found a new challenge: Nagorno-Karabakh. In 1988 the struggle for independence in the Karabagh region started. AYF became involved in fund raising activities to supply much-needed funds to the people in Karabakh. Even after the independence of Nagorno-Karabagh in 1991 and the cease-fire in 1993, the AYF continued to help the region. In 1994 the AYF Western Region decided to create a program, called the AYF Youth Corps, that sent about ten youths that year and continues to send up to 15 each summer. The mission of the Youth Corps is to help rebuild schools, camps, churches, etc. in the various regions of Nagorno-Karabakh. At the 38th Convention of the A.R.F.Y.O.C. (Canada), a motion was passed regarding the name of the organization. While in Armenian, the name would remain the same, the motion called for an English, as well as a French name, to be added to the constitution. The Canadian organization was henceforth called AYF Canada (Armenian Youth Federation Canada) in English FJA Canada (F√©d√©ration de la Jeunesse Arm√©nienne) in French. Present Day Events The Armenian Youth Federation's calendar is constantly active with social, educational, and athletic events for both junior and senior members. Below is a breakdown of some of these events, focusing on the Eastern Region USA. Senior Olympics Senior Olympics is the Eastern Region's premier event. It takes place annually during Labor Day Weekend, rotating between host chapters in the Mid-Atlantic, New England, and Mid-West regions. Chapters compete over three days in athletic events including track and field, swimming, tennis, softball, and golf. A cumulative winning chapter is announced at the Sunday night grand ball. Canada and West Coast chapters are also invited to participate in the games. National Athletic Tournament NATs is the AYF's annual winter Olympics. Like Senior Olympics, NATs rotates between host chapters in the Mid-Atlantic, New England, and Mid-West regions. The event used to be held in March but was moved to President's Day Weekend to accommodate more games and events. Chapters compete in men's and women's basketball and coed volleyball. Junior Seminar Junior Seminar is the AYF's premier junior event. It takes place Memorial Day Weekend and hosts juniors from the Mid-Atlantic, New England, and Mid-West regions with senior members serving as counselors. The weekend consists of age appropriate Armenian themed lectures and educationals, along with night activities and free time. Senior Seminar Senior Seminar is the senior version of Junior Seminar. The event usually takes place in September and features lectures to the organization's senior membership. Convention Convention is the AYF Eastern Region's annual year end meeting and audit. Each chapter in the Eastern Region sends an allotted amount of delegates to present on their chapter's activity. The AYF Central Executive and committees also prepare year end reports to go over and discuss the successes and failures of the organization from the past year. The convention then lay the groundwork for the upcoming year's activity and goals, followed by the election of the new Central Executive. Summer Programs The AYF has a number of summer opportunities available to membership and Armenian youth in general. Camp Haiastan Camp Haiastan is the AYF's camp, founded in 1951 and located in Franklin, Massachusetts. Campers are aged 8‚Äì16 and can become counselors in training at 17 years old, followed by counselors, lifeguards, Armenian School teachers at ages 18 and older. AYF Internship in Armenia The AYF ER began the Internship in Armenia program in 1992 to encourage Armenians in the Diaspora to visit and volunteer in Armenia. Over the past 25 years, the AYF has sent over 165 participants to the Homeland. The Internship in Armenia program turns the Homeland into a reality by exposing interns to the people and culture of present-day Armenia. Interns are placed in roles specific to their interests to help advance their professional goals while lending their time to their homeland. Interns live together for the summer and tour the country during time off from work.  AYF Youth Corps Program  The AYF Youth Corps program provides a unique opportunity for Armenian youth in the Diaspora to establish and strengthen ties with the homeland. The program began in 1994 after a cease-fire agreement was signed, ending the violence in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Between 1994 and 2007 the AYF sent Youth Corps volunteers to Nagorno-Karabakh to help rebuild many of the war-torn villages in our newly liberated Arstakh. In 2008, the AYF Youth Corps program shifted from rebuilding shattered buildings to operating a summer day camp for underprivileged youth in Gyumri, Armenia's second largest city. With the establishment of the camp, Youth Corps volunteers were able to provide hundreds of children with an unforgettable and productive summer. Since 2011, the program expanded from one location Gyumri to multiple other campsites across Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. The Youth Corps program is 6 weeks long, with 5 weeks of volunteer work and 1 week of touring. During the first week of the program, Youth Corps participants spend time traveling throughout Armenia, visiting historic sites and enjoying the excitement of Yerevan. The following 5 weeks are spent working as counselors at day camps for underprivileged youth in multiple towns across Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. From its inception, Youth Corps has been empowering young Diasporans to take a hands-on approach in the nation-building process of Armenia. The summer camps continue the program's long tradition of giving young Armenians from the United States a chance to make a direct impact in the homeland and on the lives of Armenia's most impoverished children and families. Through this summer camp experience, campers learn basic English, patriotic songs, arts and crafts, as well as learning about the diversity of the Diaspora and tolerance for our differences; all of which are critical in helping them grow to become members of a healthy civil society. The camps accept hundreds of children every summer and provide a safe and fun environment for them to build new friendships and acquire new skills. The camp program is just as special for its counselors, who plan the curriculum, teach the classes, and spend six months ahead of their trip doing grassroots fundraising in their local communities to raise the money needed to run the day camp and live in Armenia. In addition to volunteering with kids, Youth Corps participants travel throughout Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh and Javakhk, experiencing historic, exciting and off the beaten path adventures. Participants can expect to visit such traditional sites as Lake Sevan, Echmiadzin, Dzidzernagapert, and Sardarabad, as well as unique destinations like the ancient Monastery at Tatev, Karahunj and sites throughout Nagorno-Karabakh and Javakhk. This combination of touring and volunteer work is perfect for both first time visitors and frequent travelers to Armenia. AYF Internship in Artsakh In 2018, AYF launched the first program in Artsakh for Armenian youth in order to give Armenian from the diaspora to live and work in Artsakh for six weeks over the summer. Chapters Each AYF chapter represents a given geographical region, corresponding to significant Armenian population centers.

The series is based on Frances Hodgson Burnett's 1886 book, Little Lord Fauntleroy. In the Philippines, it was aired by ABS-CBN in the early 1990s (with some rebroadcasts at the 21st century) under the title of Cedie, Ang Munting Prinsipe, with the spin-offs live-action film of the same title by Star Cinema. The film adaptation of Little Lord Fauntleroy starred former child actor Tom Taus Jr. as the eponymous character. Plot The story concerns an American boy named Cedric Errol (more fondly known as \\"Cedie\\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/479/479.txt Project Gutenberg etext of the novel: \\"...Cedie!\\" she cried out\\"), who at an early age finds that he is the sole heir to a British earldom and leaves New York City to take up residence in his ancestral castle. After some initial resistance, he is joined by his middle-class mother (whom Cedie calls \\"Dearest\\"), widow of heir James Errol. His grandfather, the Earl of Dorincourt, intends to teach the boy to become an aristocrat, but Cedie inadvertently teaches his grandfather compassion and social justice, and the artless simplicity and motherly love of Dearest warms the old man's heart.

It is the highest point in King and Kittitas counties. Streams on its eastern slopes form the headwaters of the Cle Elum River.  Geology  Mount Daniel's volcanic rock is composed of andesite, dacite, and rhyolite inflows, breccia, and tuff. Volcanic sandstone is interbedded. Just west of Mount Daniel is the Mount Hinman plutonic stock.  Peaks  From most vantages Mount Daniel appears to be a triple-crowned mass, but five summits can be identified. * West Summit () * Middle Summit () * East Peak () * West Pyramid () * Northwest Summit () These elevations are based on Sea Level Datum of 1929 and are taken from the Mount Daniels 7.5 minute topographic map which was published in 1965. The United States Board on Geographic Names has assigned the name Mount Daniel to the east peak even though it is not the highest.  Glaciers  North aspect of Daniel featuring Lynch Glacier. Mount Daniel supports several glaciers, the largest of which is Lynch Glacier on the northwest slope of the mountain. Lynch Glacier extends from to , where it melts into Pea Soup Lake, draining to the East Fork Foss River. The West Lynch Glacier hangs from the north slope of the Northwest Peak of Mount Daniel. West Lynch Glacier was formerly connected to Lynch Glacier. On the north side of the ridge between the Middle Summit and East Peak is another glacier with the tentative name of Daniel Glacier. It is partially connected to Lynch Glacier. Daniel Glacier is losing mass and was once much larger. Several small remnants, now just perennial snow accumulations rather than living glaciers, are located east of Daniel Glacier. On the southeast side of Mount Daniel, nested against a cirque headwall, is the Hyas Creek Glacier, an isolated and small ice mass that was once much larger. It drains to Hyas Creek and Peggy's Pond. All the glaciers on Mount Daniel are thinning and becoming stagnant. West Lynch Glacier is expected to disappear in the near future.  History  The first known ascent of Mount Daniel was by The Mountaineers 1925 outing, but it is likely that surveyors had already ascended Daniel. The 1925 party climbed via Lynch Glacier.  Climbing Route  The standard route to the summit starts at Salmon La Sac, passes Cathedral Rock, Peggy's Pond, and then is a scramble up to summit. Mt.

It was the final Slowdive album to be released before the band went on a hiatus in 1995.  Content  A departure from their previous two albums, Pygmalion incorporated a more experimental sound tilted towards ambient electronic music, with sparse, atmospheric arrangements. All compositions were by Neil Halstead. Lyrics on tracks \\"Miranda\\" and \\"Visions of LA\\" were by Rachel Goswell. The cover illustration features imagery from Rainer Wehinger's graphic notation for Gy√∂rgy Ligeti's work Artikulation (1958).  Reissue  The album was remastered and reissued on Cherry Red in 2010, with a bonus disc consisting of demo versions of Pygmalion-era tracks.  Reception  Pygmalion has been well-received by critics. AllMusic called it \\"a stylistic masterpiece\\", while BBC Music echoed similar sentiments, writing that Pygmalion \\"remains Halstead and Goswell's masterpiece\\" and comparing it to the ambient work of Brian Eno. Head Heritage wrote that with the album, \\"Slowdive distilled the expansive aural atmospheres of Souvlaki to perfection.\\" Pitchfork noted the change in style, describing the album's tracks as \\"ambient pop dreams that have more in common with post-rock like Disco Inferno than shoegazers like Ride\\". A negative review came from Trouser Press, which wrote that the album \\"completely lacks all the tension, songwriting, sounds and power of the band's work, leaving only the spatial dimensions\\", calling it \\"essentially a solo ambient recording by singer/guitarist Neil Halstead that should have been released under his own name\\".  Legacy  The song \\"Blue Skied an' Clear\\" was featured on the soundtrack of the 1995 film The Doom Generation. In 1999, critic Ned Raggett ranked Pygmalion at number 122 on his list of \\"The Top 136 or So Albums of the Nineties\\" for Freaky Trigger.

These peaks are barely 270 mt (900 feet) high, surrounded by farms in the lower lands and by an exclusive neighborhood built on their slopes. Most local landscapes have panoramic views of surrounding hills. Recreational activities include trekking, PPC, and a large Golf link. There is an annual trekking and climbing event organized by the \\"Club Andino Mar del Plata\\", with more that 300 climbers attending each October. Along the main access road there is also a Zoo. The neighbourhood has four shopping centers and many facilities for visitors. A large super market and many groceries fill local residents' need of food and beverages. The winters are a bit colder than in the coastal area and summers are not so mild. Permanent residents as of 2010 were about 4,300. Most of them are members of the upper and upper-middle class.

This term is used when the process occurs within a sovereign entity. Unbalanced growth or outward expansion of one neighbor may necessitate an administrative decision to merge (see urban sprawl). In some cases, common perception of continuity may be a factor in prompting such a process (see conurbation). Some cities (see below) that have gone through amalgamation or a similar process had several administrative sub- divisions or jurisdictions, each with a separate person in charge. Annexation is similar to amalgamation, but differs in being applied mainly to two cases: #The units joined are sovereign entities before the process, as opposed to being units of a single political entity. #A city's boundaries are expanded by adding territories not already incorporated as cities or villages. Notable municipal mergers The act of merging two or more municipalities into a single new municipality may be done for a variety of reasons, including urban growth, reducing the cost of local government and improving the efficiency of municipal service delivery. Belgium In 1977, the 2,359 municipalities of Belgium were merged to 596 new municipalities. Brazil In 1975, the state of Guanabara and the state of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil were merged. The former consisted of only the territorial limits of the city of Rio de Janeiro, formerly the Federal District as Brazilian capital until 1960, when it was moved to newly built Bras√≠lia. When merged, Guanabara became the municipality of Rio de Janeiro within the new state. In geographical terms, it would seem the state of Rio would have incorporated Guanabara; but, as the administrative and financial resources of the former capital were significant and even larger than the rest of the state, the change was more correctly referred to as a merger (fus√£o). Canada In Canada, the 1990s saw the forced amalgamation of several municipal entities in the provinces of Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec into larger new municipalities. Even in cases where a central city merged with it's suburbs, the amalgamated city was legally a new municipality, even if it was given the central city's name. The process created what was labeled a megacity by the media, although none of the created municipalities fit in the definition of a megacity in the international sense and some of them have fewer than a million inhabitants. ;New Brunswick *Municipal amalgamations in New Brunswick ;Nova Scotia * Municipal amalgamations in Nova Scotia ;Ontario In the early 1970s, the various towns, villages, and townships surrounding Metropolitan Toronto that were undergoing suburbanization were amalgamated into various new municipalities; among them Mississauga and Vaughan. Later, the provincial government of Mike Harris undertook an extensive province-wide program of municipal mergers between 1996 and 2002. The province had 815 municipalities in 1996; by 2002, this had been reduced to just 447.Municipal restructuring since 1996 . Archives of Ontario. Retrieved January 1, 2012. The list of municipalities in Ontario is updated regularly. * Toronto ‚Äì In 1967, the towns of Leaside, Mimico, New Toronto and Weston and the villages of Forest Hill, Long Branch and Swansea amalgamated into the city and various boroughs comprising Metropolitan Toronto. In 1998, the former boroughs within Metropolitan Toronto were merged into a new City of Toronto. * Cambridge ‚Äì In 1973, the provincial government created the new City of Cambridge by amalgamating the City of Galt, the towns of Preston and Hespeler. * Thunder Bay ‚Äì On January 1, 1970, the twin cities of Fort William, and Port Arthur, merged into one city. * Ottawa ‚Äì In 2001, the municipalities of Ottawa, Cumberland, Osgoode, Rideau, Goulbourn, West Carleton, Nepean, Kanata, Gloucester, Vanier and Rockcliffe Park amalgamated into a new City of Ottawa. * Greater Sudbury ‚Äì resulted from the merger of the former Regional Municipality of Sudbury in 2001; the regional municipality itself was created by a series of municipal amalgamations in 1973. * Hamilton ‚Äì In 2001, the former City of Stoney Creek and the former towns of Ancaster, Dundas, Flamborough and Glanbrook merged to create the new City of Hamilton. * Temiskaming Shores ‚Äì In 2004, the towns of New Liskeard and Haileybury, along with the township of Dymond, merged to create the new town of Temiskaming Shores. ;Quebec * Gatineau ‚Äì five municipalities in southwestern Quebec (Gatineau, Hull, Aylmer, Buckingham and Masson-Angers) were merged into a new city of Gatineau in 2002. * Longueuil * Montreal ‚Äì In the Montreal Merger on January 1, 2002, the Parti Qu√©b√©cois provincial government merged all municipalities on the Island of Montreal into a new City of Montreal.

China The two previously independent cities Hankou and Wuchang, as well as the county of Hanyang, were merged into one city by the name Wuhan in 1927. Wuhan was named China's first direct-controlled municipality, and was intended to serve as the capital of China. Denmark In 1970, mergers brought the number of municipalities of Denmark from 1,098 to 277.

Finland An ongoing series of mergers has reduced the number of municipalities of Finland from 432 in 2006 to 311 in 2017. Germany Several states of West Germany carried out municipal merger programmes in the 1960s and 1970s. In Baden-W√ºrttemberg, the number of municipalities dropped from 3,379 to 1,110 between 1968 and 1975; in Bavaria, from roughly 7,000 to roughly 2,000 between 1972 and 1978; in Hesse, from 2,642 to 421 between 1972 and 1977; in North Rhine-Westphalia, from 2,365 to 396 between 1967 and 1975; and in Saarland, from 345 to 50 in 1974. In the Bavarian town of Ermershausen, citizens occupied the town hall to resist the merger with Maroldsweisach ‚Äì unsuccessfully, although Ermershausen was reconstituted as an independent municipality in 1994 ‚Äì and Horgau, also in Bavaria, successfully appealed its merger with Zusmarshausen to the Constitutional Court of Bavaria (Bayerischer Verfassungsgerichtshof). Mergers have also taken place in the former East Germany after 1990, for example in Brandenburg in 2003. Greece The Kallikratis Plan replaced the 1033 municipalities and communities of Greece with 325 new municipalities in 2011. Hungary Budapest, the capital and largest city in Hungary, was formed from the merger of the cities of Buda and Pest across the river Danube in 1873.

Portugal Portugal was one of the first countries in the world to make an enlarged modern administrative reform, particularly during the 19th century. In early 19th century, the country was divided into more than 800 municipalities. In 1832, during Portuguese Civil War, a law from Mouzinho da Silveira, minister from the liberal government-in-exile (which then ruled only in the Azores) simplified the public administration, and reduced the number of municipalities to 796. In 1836, after the liberal victory, Passos Manuel, minister from the government of the Marquess of S√° da Bandeira made a profound administrative reform which reduced significantly the number of municipalities, fixing it to 351. Passos Manuel's reform followed a trend very decentralist, creating an elected municipal administration. In 1855, another series of mergers reduced the number of municipalities to 254. In the rest of the 19th century, some series of mergers occurred (particularly during the 1890s), meanwhile other municipalities were restored. Thereafter, the changes to the municipal map focused mainly on the restoration and creation of new municipalities, particularly in the 20th century. Nowadays, there are 308 municipalities in Portugal. The last alteration to the municipal map, occurred in 1998, with the creation of the municipalities of Odivelas (in Lisbon district), Trofa (in Porto district) and Vizela (in Braga district). In 2013, more than 1,000 parishes/freguesias were merged. Sweden Many rural municipalities of Sweden were merged in 1952; the number of them decreasing from 2,281 to 816. Another series of mergers, this time also including cities and market towns, reduced the total number of municipalities from roughly 1,000 in the early 1960s to 278 in 1974. As of 2013, Sweden has 290 municipalities.

Biography Kutty was born at Ottapalam, Kerala in 1921 to Kayarat Narayana Menon and Kottuthodi Lakshmi Amma. Kutty was educated at Ottapalam and Malabar Christian College, Kozhikode. Kutty's talent was discovered by the famous Malayalam satirist, Professor M. R. Nair (better known by his pen name \\"Sanjayan\\"). His first cartoon appeared in the Malayalam humor magazine Viswaroopam (edited by Sanjayan) in 1940. Rao Sahib V. P. Menon, a relative of Kutty's father and a senior official in the British Imperial Secretariat (New Delhi) introduced him to the famous Indian cartoonist Shankar. Shankar used to sketch cartoons for Hindustan Times and was looking for a trainee. V. P. Menon requested Shankar to train Kutty, who reached New Delhi on 3 January 1941. In those days, Jawaharlal Nehru (later India's first Prime Minister), a great admirer of Shankar's cartoons, was looking for a cartoonist for his newly started English Daily, National Herald, published from Lucknow. Shankar trained Kutty for 6 months and recommended him for Nehru's newspaper. Kutty became staff cartoonist of National Herald (Lucknow). His first cartoon to appear in a daily newspaper was published in the National Herald 15 January 1941. National Herald was shut down in 1942 due to repressive policies of the British India Government, following the start of Quit India Movement. Kutty then relocated to Madras (now Chennai), where he worked for Madras War Review from 1943 to 1945. From 1945 to 1946, he worked The Free Press Journal a Mumbai) daily newspaper. In 1946, Kutty relocated to New Delhi at behest of Shankar, who wanted him to work as a cartoonist for his planned evening newspaper. From 1946 to 1997, Kutty lived in New Delhi and worked for various publications. In 1947-48, he worked for National Call and Amar Bharat. Kutty also contributed to Shankar's Weekly, a humor magazine launched in 1948. Here he worked with other notable Indian cartoonists including Abu Abraham and O. V. Vijayan. From 1948 to 1951, he was associated with the Indian News Chronicle. In 1951, Kutty joined the Ananda Bazar Group of Calcutta (now Kolkata). His cartoons appeared in many of the group's publications such as the English daily Hindustan Standard (New Delhi, 1951‚Äì1986), the Bengali language daily Ananda Bazar Patrika (1975‚Äì1986) and Desh (Bengali literary weekly). Kutty‚Äôs work was also syndicated for publication in various newspapers such as Hindustan Times (1961‚Äì1962) and The Indian Express (1962‚Äì1969). From 1987 to 1997, Kutty worked for another Bengali daily, Aaj Kaal. He was also associated with the Bengali publication Parivarthan (Calcutta) in 1986-1987. Kutty didn't know the Bengali language, but he spent the most productive part of his career with Bengali publications. This was due to his direct and simple visual expression with which he cut across language barriers. His used to caption his cartoons in English, which were translated into Bengali. Kutty's cartoons have also appeared in many Malayalam language periodicals (Malayalam was his mother tongue). Kutty officially retired in 1997. He then moved to Madison, Wisconsin. In May 2005, rumors of Kutty's death started circulating in Kolkata. In response to this, Kutty's former colleagues at Aaj Kaal published the denial of the rumor with a new cartoon drawn by Kutty. This led to requests for more cartoons from his admirers. Kutty complied and sketched few more cartoons that were published in Aaj Kaal. However, he could not continue due to his deteriorating eyesight. Kutty wrote an English-language memoir, Years Of Laughter: Reminiscences Of A Cartoonist, released in 2009.http://cartoonacademy.blogspot.in/2009/05/years-of-laughter- reminiscences-of.html He died on 22 October 2011 in the Madison, Wisconsin.

It is based on the French novel En Famille by Hector Malot. The original aired from January 1, 1978 until December 31, 1978, spanning 53 episodes. In 2010, it was aired on QTV channel 11 (now GMA News TV) in the Philippines. En Famille The anime is based on the novel En Famille by Hector Malot, which is also translated as Nobody's Girl. Another work by the author, Sans Famille, has a very similar story. That work was used as the basis of two separate anime series: Nobody's Boy: Remi and Remi, Nobody's Girl. The latter should not be confused with The Story of Perrine. Plot Perrine Paindavoine is the daughter of an Anglo-Indian mother, Marie, and a French father, Edmond, who dies in Bosnia at the very beginning of the story. Before dying, Edmond asks his wife and Perrine to return to his hometown, Maraucourt, where Perrine's grandfather, Vulfran, owns a factory and a family mansion. Perrine and her mother run a traveling photo studio in their journey to France. Upon reaching Paris, however, Marie falls ill. Although they sell everything they have to spend on medication, Marie eventually dies. At her deathbed, she reveals that Perrine must not expect a welcome from her grandfather. Vulfran strongly opposed Edmond's marriage and as such, he detests Perrine. After the burial, Perrine embarks on arduous journey to Maraucourt, traveling almost on foot and barely surviving starvation. Once there, she assumes the identity of Aurelie to assess the situation in advance: Maraucourt is a town whose primary function is to house the workforce of its cotton mill, which Mr. Paindavoine owns. As such, the blind, stern Mr. Paindavoine is virtually the local ruler of the town and is feared by everyone, even his irresponsible nephew who expects to inherit the factory. Aurelie secures a job of pushing rail-carts in the factory. Soon, however, she is promoted to factory's interpreter, as she speaks both French and English fluently. Ultimately, through her efficiency, loyalty and (unbeknownst to many) her compassion, she becomes Vulfran's personal secretary and is invited to live in his mansion. Vulfran gradually grows fond of Aurelie, who has become his all-time companion without him asking. Coming so to close to her grandfather, Aurelie learns about his personal life: Having virtually no loving relative, Vulfran has started a search for Edmond, intent to bring him home. Aurelie translates his foreign communications but does not dare to mention that his search is in vain, because Vulfran makes no secret of his hatred for Edmond's wife and daughter, blaming them for stealing his son away, which hurts Aurelie. Eventually, Vulfran is informed of the premature death of Edmond in Bosnia. The bad news is proved almost fatal, as Vulfran is struck down by grief and only survives the ordeal through the passionate care of Aurelie, who helps him recover. Vulfran is grateful to Aurelie; during visit from the elderly \\"grandmother Fran√ßoise\\", once Edmond's nanny, he proclaims that Aurelie is an angel sent by the God to save him, because such unconditional love is unique for a total stranger. Fran√ßoise, a mutual friend of Aurelie since her arrival in Maraucourt, replies that the angel curiously resembles Edmond. Vulfran immediately sends his lawyer to investigate Aurelie's background and also acknowledges that if she is truly his granddaughter, he must make up for having said terrible things about Edmond's family in front of her. After receiving confirmation that Aurelie is indeed Perrine, Vulfran undergoes a dangerous eye surgery to see his granddaughter's face. He also orders the construction of a daycare center and healthy dormitories for the workers of the factory.
